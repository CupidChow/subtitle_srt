from the Intelligence Analysis Department.

Greetings, General Hu Zhong.

(Hu Zhong)

10
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,500

(Chief of Intelligence Analysis Department, the Shu State)
(In charge of intelligence analysis)
(Gao Tangbing)

12
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,400
I'm Gao Tangbing, Chief of the Intelligence Analysis Department.
(Chief of Intelligence Analysis Department, the Shu State)
(In charge of intelligence analysis)
(Gao Tangbing)

13
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,000
Oh, Chief Gao.

14
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:34,570
Be seated, please.

15
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,579
In the Jieting's false intelligence case,

16
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,220
you're kind of

17
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,860
a witness.

18
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,700
I serve in the military.

19
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,180
But due to my low position,

20
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,610
I didn't actually see what happened.

21
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,700
In your opinion,

22
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,220
was Baidi tricked by Wei spies

23
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,930
so that he gave the false intelligence

24
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,840
or did Baidi betray us

25
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,130
and collude with Wei spies?

26
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,240
It's hard to judge, I'm afraid.

27
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,940
Our department is mainly in charge of intelligence analysis.

28
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,980
The Operations Department

29
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,410
distinguishes the sources of intelligence.

30
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,020
Is Baidi

31
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,410
always contacted by Clerk Feng personally?

32
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,540
The lurk of Baidi

33
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,530
has been a top secret of Siwencao Intelligence.

34
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,010
I only heard about him later.

35
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,420
Have you heard

36
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,020
of Wei's Qingping Plan?

37
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,329
Yes.

38
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:42,079
It's been in operation for over a year,

39
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,500
aiming to steal the crossbow technique from our army.

40
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:46,940
Not exactly.

41
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,260
According to Chief Yin of the Operations Department,

42
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,300
Qingping Plan is a huge plan,

43
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,050
including many sub-plans

44
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,570
such as stealing our top military secrets,

45
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,160
instigating our military and political leaders,

46
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,580
and inciting civil strife in the Han Dynasty.

47
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,530
Can Baidi's betrayal

48
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,690
be part of

49
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,350
the Qingping Plan?

50
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,090
At war,

51
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,380
Wei spies have been trying desperately

52
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:12,960
to infiltrate Siwencao Intelligence.

53
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,390
It's not strange, is it?

54
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,540
Write it down.

55
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:18,490
Aye.

56
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,180
Over the years,

57
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,490
Siwencao Intelligence has been like a dilapidated house

58
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,800
with leaks in all directions.

59
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,510
No secrets can be hidden.

60
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,630
Chief Gao, you're a senior member.

61
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,790
Do you have any advice for it?

62
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,210
The rectification in Siwencao Intelligence

63
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,409
carried out by General Li

64
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,960
proves to be quite necessary.

65
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:52,040
(Tianshui, the Wei State)

66
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,000
The inn has been searched.

67
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,480
Nobody suspicious is found.

68
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,050
The murderer must be still in the old town.

69
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,260
On the wall of the backyard,

70
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,230
we found traces of grappling hooks.

71
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,370
Our men are going after him.

72
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,230
Keep hunting him.

73
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:17,290
Aye.

74
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,150
Looks like

75
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,630
you're quite lucky today.

76
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,170
I keep winning.

77
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,580
Thank you.

78
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,920
Recorder Chen, come back and have fun.

79
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,100
Coming.

80
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,420
Set the game.

81
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,460
Here.

82
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,580
Wrong. Here.

83
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:00,860
Recorder Chen, what happened out there?

84
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,910
Out there...

85
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,250
Someone died.

86
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,420
Someone died?

87
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,790
What bad luck!

88
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:46,500
(Chief Clerk of Siwencao Intelligence, the Shu State)
(Yao You)

89
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:52,340
Clerk Feng, General Hu Zhong invited you to the meeting room.

90
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,020
I've heard a lot about you.

91
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,510
Clerk Feng, it's my honor

92
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:17,690
to talk with you.

93
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:18,700
Don't flatter me.

94
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:19,920
Just get to the point.

95
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,500
Ordered by General Li Yan,

96
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:25,890
I'm having a talk with you,

97
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,730
mainly to confirm the punishment

98
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,860
of the traitor, Baidi.

99
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,250
We sent two batches of spies

100
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,060
to investigate this case.

101
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,920
The first batch of spies was killed.

102
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:38,980
For the second time,

103
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,240
Deputy Chief Xun Xu

104
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:42,610
was assigned to the Wei State for the investigation

105
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:43,790
and he would handle the traitor if necessary.

106
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,340
You decided whom to send

107
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:48,300
to Tianshui for the investigation, right?

108
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,370
Yes.

109
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,470
What's the problem?

110
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,060
Why did you send Xun Xu?

111
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:00,220
The duty of the Internal Affairs Department is to find out traitors.

112
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:03,320
Xun Xu is the Deputy Chief of the Internal Affairs Department.

113
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:06,140
He hasn't done any fieldwork before.

114
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,280
He is quite inexperienced.

115
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,230
But in this false intelligence case,

116
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,740
he turns out to be the most innocent.

117
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,590
The Military Intelligence Agency of Wei

118
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,620
doesn't have any chance

119
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,620
to approach or subvert him.

120
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,380
But he's said to be Baidi’s brother-in-law.

121
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:25,530
I've never heard about that.

122
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,030
Is it possible

123
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,260
that Xun Xu would let Baidi off?

124
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,030
We have precautions

125
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,919
against this kind of situation.

126
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:38,700
Before leaving,

127
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:40,740
Xun Xu drank the farewell tea of Siwencao Intelligence.

128
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,289
He won't get the antidote until he completes his mission?

129
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:44,370
Right.

130
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,640
It's the old rule

131
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,390
for difficult fieldwork.

132
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,080
Any other questions?

133
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:57,880
Hurry.

134
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,460
(Military Intelligence Agency of Wei)
(Tianshui, the Wei State)

135
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,020
Keep up.
(Military Intelligence Agency of Wei)
(Tianshui, the Wei State)

136
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,170
(Military Intelligence Agency of Wei)
(Tianshui, the Wei State)

137
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,980
I guess the killer realized that Gu Zheng was exposed.

138
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:06,280
He then killed him to cut off the clues.

139
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,890
Put them to torture and interrogate them.

140
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:10,850
Aye.

141
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,270
Chancellor Mi,

142
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,080
we caught a Shu soldier alive.

143
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:15,850
Where's he?

144
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,730
He's being interrogated in the prison.

145
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,780
He said nothing before passing out.

146
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,830
All Shu soldiers on Xiaolong Mountain are dead,

147
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:36,090
but him.

148
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,800
Get a physician for him.

149
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,870
Make him talk,

150
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,100
at whatever cost.

151
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,130
Gu Zheng is

152
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,080
a dead end.

153
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,100
What are we going to do next?

154
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,100
Have two of our capable henchmen

155
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,880
keep a close eye on Chen Gong day and night.

156
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,190
Record everything he does.

157
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,380
If he knows what Governor is planning,

158
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:04,570
there'll be another tempest.

159
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,030
Today, Chen Gong made a reckless move.

160
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,990
He'll give himself away soon.

161
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:42,660
Keep a close eye on him and leave everything else alone.

162
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,830
All right. I'll do it personally.

163
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,110
Jili Carriage Shop was searched.

164
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,890
Servants and shop assistants

165
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,030
were all put in prison.

166
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,090
He was used.

167
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,330
Used?

168
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,700
He said he not only contacted you,

169
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,910
but also a spy named Chidi in Tianshui.

170
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:20,070
Impossible.

171
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,600
That's impossible.

172
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,560
Feng Ying made it clear

173
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,860
that Gu Zheng was my exclusive agent

174
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,940
for safety concerns

175
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,400
and he would never get involved in any other events.

176
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,380
No way.

177
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:35,860
Right.

178
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:38,300
In Siwencao Intelligence,

179
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,870
I've never heard of Chidi, either.

180
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,670
How did they contact?

181
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,790
By shooting arrows.

182
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,290
They never met.

183
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,480
I'm afraid our deduction was right.

184
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,590
Zhulong takes a senior occupation in Siwencao Intelligence.

185
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:04,320
He made up the codename, Chidi.

186
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,620
Without knowing the truth,

187
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:08,800
Gu Zheng became his agent.

188
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,940
Now, Gu Zheng is dead.

189
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,530
We can't vindicate ourselves.

190
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,610
Looks like I have to take the blame

191
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,100
for the Jieting's false intelligence case.

192
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:24,980
Yeah.

193
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,560
Jieting was lost and the Northern Expedition failed.

194
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,390
Such a big case

195
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,620
can't be let go unless you're executed.

196
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:35,260
I'm in a desperate plight.

197
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,990
(Li Yan’s Camp)
(Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

198
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,290
General,

199
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:50,380
this is the list of upper-middle administrators of Siwencao Intelligence.

200
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,280
They're all slyboots.

201
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,000
A group of slippery fellows.

202
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,170
Did you talk to all of them?

203
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:58,690
Yes.

204
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,550
Feng Ying is kind of interesting.

205
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,060
He's always been on Yang Yi's side.

206
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:07,140
But he isn't completely loyal to Yang Yi.

207
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,780
After Baidi betrayed us,

208
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,620
Yang Yi asked Feng Ying to close the case quickly

209
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,180
and leave no loopholes for us.

210
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:16,200
Unexpectedly, he had something in reserve.

211
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:19,790
Feng Ying...

212
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:21,990
Don't do anything to him yet.

213
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:25,310
Keep him working in Siwencao Intelligence.

214
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,580
But arrange an assistant for him.

215
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,520
Have one of our men

216
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,190
work for him.

217
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,310
Not you.

218
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,190
You must stay with me.

219
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,110
General,

220
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:50,780
I have someone to recommend.

221
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:51,820
Who?

222
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,700
He's Li Miao.

223
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,540
He isn't on the list.

224
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,660
Li Miao

225
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,470
used to be

226
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:01,980
a counsellor at the Prime Minister's Mansion.

227
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,820
He was demoted to a plebeian

228
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:06,180
and he hates Yang Yi's gut.

229
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,730
It was he who told me

230
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,400
about Wei spies

231
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:11,690
inside Siwencao Intelligence.

232
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:12,540
Is he reliable?

233
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,580
Yes, I guess.

234
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,190
Where's he?

235
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,700
After being demoted by Zhuge Liang, he had nowhere to go

236
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:23,330
and he came to me for shelter. Now he's in Nanzheng County.

237
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,830
Take him to me first.

238
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,310
We've got a way out.

239
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,540
Come on.

240
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:37,240
Don't try to console me anymore.

241
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,310
I'm serious.

242
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,470
There's a man

243
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,520
who knows the existence of Zhulong.

244
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,000
As long as he testifies...

245
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,080
Guo Gang.

246
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,070
Mm.

247
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,780
How would he testify?

248
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,350
Let's get him to Nanzheng County.

249
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,240
You're insane.

250
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:58,220
Only he can prove the existence of Zhulong

251
00:14:58,730 --> 00:14:59,920
so that we can both get out of the problem.

252
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,920
This is ridiculous.

253
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,780
From Tianshui to Nanzheng County,

254
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,030
how can we avoid so many Wei soldiers?

255
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,860
With a good plan,

256
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,720
we may stand a chance.

257
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,860
Even if I fail to survive,

258
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,720
I must at least die vindicating myself.

259
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,580
You've got a plan?

260
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:17,860
We have to

261
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:20,210
take Guo Gang away secretly

262
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:21,310
and stop Wei soldiers

263
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,340
from catching up with us within a day.

264
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,900
We can't even do the second part.

265
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,650
Guo Gang is crazy

266
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,500
about newfangled craft.

267
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,060
He once ordered me

268
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:37,230
to restore Lu Ban's Bamboo Kite.

269
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,030
Bamboo Kite?

270
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,230
As recorded in history,

271
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,600
Lu Ban made a kite of bamboo.

272
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:46,470
It kept flying in the sky for three days.

273
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:48,520
But it's just a legend.

274
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,780
In the 13th year of Jian'an Period (208 A.D.), the Wei Army reached Xinye.

275
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:55,490
Liu Cong had his envoy offer a declaration of surrender and welcome Cao Cao to Jingzhou.

276
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:58,420
The Wei Army dug ancient tombs along the way.

277
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,580
In the capital of the State of Chu, they found Lu Ban's tomb

278
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:04,680
with the original Bamboo Kite in it.

279
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,000
It had only remains, considering its age.

280
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:08,900
Coincidentally, last year,

281
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,670
Guo Gang gave me

282
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,880
all the information about the Bamboo Kite he collected

283
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,680
and asked me to restore it.

284
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,070
So,

285
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,440
you have restored it?

286
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,220
The kite is made of bamboo

287
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,560
and covered with sheepskin.

288
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,500
It can fly in the wind

289
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:28,140
and carry a man for hundreds of meters.

290
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,310
Guo Gang is

291
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,530
overambitious and adventurous.

292
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,840
If we invite him to try the Bamboo Kite on Xiaolong Mountain,

293
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,750
I'm sure he'll be glad to go.

294
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,100
What do you think?

295
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,210
The bamboo joints and slices

296
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,710
can be folded like an umbrella.

297
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,300
It can be opened when used.

298
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,000
How exquisite it is!

299
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,350
Zhuge Liang made the Wooden Ox and Gliding Horse.

300
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,270
And you made the Bamboo Kite.

301
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,609
You're on a par with him.

302
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,940
You flatter me.

303
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,359
Actually,

304
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:10,310
Lu Ban is

305
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:11,369
the greatest inventor.

306
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:13,750
Can I steer it?

307
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,940
Of course. The leather ropes.

308
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:16,069
Hold them.

309
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,430
Then you can control

310
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,849
where you fly and land.

311
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:25,339
Chen Gong,

312
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,690
when we fly high,

313
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:31,010
it'll hurt if we fall, right?

314
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,380
No.

315
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,430
I fell a few times.

316
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,480
Don't worry.

317
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,000
Here we go, then.

318
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:37,910
After you.

319
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,160
Xigou Canyon of Xiaolong Mountain is a dead end.

320
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,280
Even when the Wei Army hunts us down,

321
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,520
it'll take them at least two days

322
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:52,710
to reach this place.

323
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,500
Have you tried the Kite?

324
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,030
I just made it. I had no time to try it yet.

325
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,320
No way.

326
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,450
It's too risky.

327
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,450
I don't care about Guo Gang.

328
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,780
But it's an abysmal cliff.

329
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:07,130
If anything goes wrong, you'll die.

330
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,090
Do we have

331
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,330
any other options?

332
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,040
Born in troubled times, a real man should go around

333
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,710
and make a difference regardless of his life.

334
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,360
It's what a good man should do all his life.

335
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:26,990
Stop, stop.

336
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:28,480
It's what you once told me.

337
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,860
Do you still remember?

338
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:39,550
Where should I be at that time?

339
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,480
Look.

340
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:01,480
Here.

341
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:06,000
This is where Guo Gang and I are expected to land.

342
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,450
Why do you trust Chen Gong so much?

343
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:36,070
I trust my own heart.

344
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,380
Here.

345
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,240
This is where Guo Gang and I

346
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,590
are expected to land.

347
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,240
Wait for us there

348
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,540
with two swift horses.

349
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,170
All right?

350
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,420
Fine.

351
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:56,390
I'll also take some sleeping powder

352
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:57,770
and make Guo Gang faint.

353
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:59,980
How I wish I could make you faint, too!

354
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:01,850
It's a good plan,

355
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,530
isn't it?

356
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,390
Good plan.

357
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,760
We're both insane.

358
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,070
I just hope

359
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,060
we can get through this.

360
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,180
Everything will be all right.

361
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,540
It will be all right.

362
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,280
Do you know

363
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,220
(Former adjutant subordinate to the Prime Minister of Shu)
(Li Miao)

364
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:33,800
(Li Miao)
Do you know

365
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:33,280
(Li Miao)

366
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,300
why General Li asked to see me?
(Former adjutant subordinate to the Prime Minister of Shu)
(Li Miao)

367
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:35,900
(Former adjutant subordinate to the Prime Minister of Shu)
(Li Miao)

368
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,090
Don't worry, Li Miao.
(Former adjutant subordinate to the Prime Minister of Shu)
(Li Miao)

369
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,990
General Li is courteous and broad-minded.

370
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,230
If he asks any questions, just answer honestly.

371
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:43,940
I will.

372
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,200
Thank you for recommending me, Hu Zhong.

373
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,150
This way, please.

374
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,190
Go.

375
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,690
I'm Li Miao.

376
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:17,380
Greetings, General Li.

377
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,700
He... He's Li Miao.

378
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:24,950
Oh, Li Miao.

379
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,090
You may rise.

380
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,090
Thank you, General.

381
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:30,780
Be seated, please.

382
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:32,110
Thank you, General.

383
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,790
You work at the Prime Minister's Mansion.

384
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:47,110
What brought you

385
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,680
to Nanzheng County?

386
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,120
I was fired by the Prime Minister

387
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:56,620
and demoted to a plebeian.

388
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,070
Now, I'm merely a commoner

389
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,740
without a job.

390
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,220
Fi... Fi...

391
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,730
Fired?

392
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:07,690
Why?

393
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,760
Jieting was lost

394
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,750
and the Prime Minister wanted to execute Ma Su.

395
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,950
I simply advised against it.

396
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,080
Prime Minister, please remit Ma Su's execution!

397
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,810
The world isn't in peace yet!

398
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,610
If you execute a wise minister,

399
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,290
it'll be a loss for our state!

400
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,800
The Qin State wouldn't be able to conquer more than twenty ethnic states

401
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,560
if they didn't pardon an important courtier.

402
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,460
Such an empty talk is useless!

403
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,560
The Chu State executed an important courtier

404
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:35,150
and it declined after two generations.

405
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,260
What you said was quite offensive.

406
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,350
The Prime Minister must have been annoyed.

407
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:45,480
He was.

408
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,280
Chief Yang Yi then made a slanderous talk.

409
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,680
He said I was disloyal.

410
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:59,040
Now, he and I are

411
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,910
totally incompatible.

412
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,190
Li Miao,

413
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,830
when you came here,

414
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,860
would you be helpful to me?

415
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:13,910
General, I hear you're rectifying Siwencao Intelligence.

416
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,380
I came to offer some advice.

417
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,780
Oh?

418
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:26,240
(Chengdu, the Shu State)

419
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:29,470
(Prime Minister's Mansion)

420
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,530
Prime Minister, it's quite a good essay.

421
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,770
It explains the reasons

422
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,560
and necessity of the Northern Expedition.

423
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,280
Our state is away from the center of the world.

424
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,190
We can't get a long period of stability

425
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,680
unless we go down to the Central Plains

426
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:52,330
and fight against other states.

427
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,430
Unfortunately, some people

428
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:58,290
want to dwell in the corner

429
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:00,330
and dream of a small monarchy.

430
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,980
Restoring the Han Dynasty is like sailing against the current.

431
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,030
We'll either move forward or fall behind.

432
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,060
We can't make it

433
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,380
only by maintaining a small monarchy.

434
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,400
Prime Minister,

435
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,370
will we present this essay

436
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:15,460
to His Majesty?

437
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:17,040
This is not the right time yet.

438
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,460
How's everything going in the Nanzheng County?

439
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:27,530
Prime Minister,

440
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:31,430
Li Yan is keeping a high profile

441
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,100
with the excuse of Wei spies.

442
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:35,700
I guess he'll depose Yao You

443
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,680
and punish Feng Ying.

444
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,560
Actually, he wants to plant his own men.

445
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,290
It's necessary to clear out Wei spies.

446
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,250
No matter who is in charge,

447
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,620
we should support him.

448
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:51,900
Prime Minister,

449
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:55,860
I'm afraid Li Yan has a bigger ambition.

450
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,980
It's too early to say so.

451
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:01,490
You're just guessing, aren’t you?

452
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,020
Have it delivered urgently.

453
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,010
Aye.

454
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,440
Leave Siwencao Intelligence

455
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:12,260
to Li Yan.

456
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:14,000
You needn't bother about it.

457
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:18,110
Aye.

458
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:25,020
Clerk Feng Ying of Siwencao Intelligence

459
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,450
keeps his post with a reduction of pay.

460
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:31,380
Chief Gao Tangbing of the Intelligence Analysis Department

461
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,200
keeps his post with a reduction of pay.

462
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:36,810
Chief Yin Ji of the Operations Department

463
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:40,700
is demoted to the Deputy Chief.

464
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:43,540
Officer Sun Ling of the scribe room

465
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:46,370
works hard day and night

466
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:49,650
and is promoted as the Deputy Chief of the scribe room.

467
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:54,580
As the superior of Siwencao Intelligence, Chief Clerk Yao You

468
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,540
deceives his leaders, bullies his subordinates

469
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,810
and distorts politics

470
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:05,100
so that members of Siwencao Intelligence get slack at work.

471
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,760
Cavalry General, Marquis of Suburb,

472
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:11,060
and Military Commissioner Li Yan investigated the case under the command of His Majesty.

473
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:16,770
Clerk Yao You is hereby demoted to a plebeian.

474
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,460
Congratulations on your promotion.

475

(In charge of general logistics)

476

Thank you.

I counted on myself, after all.

(In charge of general logistics)
(Sun Ling)

479
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,480
Chief Sun, we'll rely on you.

480
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:34,620
No problem.

481
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:35,750
This way, please.

482
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,020
-What on earth was that?
-Stop complaining.

483
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,710
Such a big thing happened in the Operations Department.

484
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,230
The ace spy betrayed us.

485
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,970
And you were only degraded.

486
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:44,600
Baidi?

487
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,850
Clerk Feng contacted him personally.

488
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:48,720
The case has nothing to do with our department.

489
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,360
Chief Clerk was fired.

490
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,230
The post won't always be vacant.

491
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:53,250
You want to be it?

492
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,390
Me?

493
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:55,740
I won't daydream.

494
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,380
Someone else would fill in.

495
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:00,000
And he must be General Li’s henchman.

496
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,110
Oh, no.

497
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:02,970
Seniors like us

498
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,200
will be puppets sooner or later.

499
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,340
Clerk Feng, wait.

500
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,330
The punishment is temporary.

501
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,260
If you explain it to General Li's face,

502
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:17,290
he'll no longer misunderstand you.

503
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,750
I've been busy working lately.

504
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,770
When the situation is settled,

505
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,620
I'll visit General Li.

00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:45,840
(Governor’s office)
(Tianshui, the Wei State)

508
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:58,750
Governor.

509
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,780
Chen Gong, come and have a look.

510
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:03,210
My uncle knew I loved this

511
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:06,010
and he had it transported from Chang'an.

512
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:09,060
It was made by clever craftsmen of the previous dynasty.

513
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,600
The Armillary Sphere?

514
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,510
Come on. Look.

515
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:14,490
The equatorial ring.

516
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,390
The right ascension ring.

517
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,610
Is there something missing?

518
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,460
Was it lost when the Sphere was dug out?

519
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:28,710
I don't know.

520
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:29,490
Governor,

521
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:32,340
it's marvelous.

522
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,370
Governor,

523
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:37,730
you asked me to restore Lu Ban's Bamboo Kite.

524
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,590
I'm done with it.

525
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:41,070
What?

526
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,980
Lu Ban's Bamboo Kite.

527
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,170
-You're done with it?
-Uh-huh.

528
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:48,660
Where is it?

529
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,640
In my storehouse.

530
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,380
Let me go have a look.

531
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:08,340
It can be folded during transportation

532
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,930
just like an umbrella.

533
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,680
In operation, it can be opened

534
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:14,090
and it can carry a man.

535
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,720
It's precious, Chen Gong.

536
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,350
And the rope...

537
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:24,190
It can fix the kite around your waist.

538
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:26,150
A flying kite.

539
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,430
Can I steer it?

540
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,350
Yes.

541
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:31,510
These two leather ropes

542
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:34,040
are tied to the auxiliary wings.

543
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,350
By using them,

544
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,450
you can steer the kite.

545
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,060
I made this.

546
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,260
However,

547
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,720
it can't keep flying

548
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:44,030
for three days.

549
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:47,490
Most historical records are just legends.

550
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:48,750
Chen Gong,

551
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,180
how far can we fly

552
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,240
with this kite?

553
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,030
Hundreds of meters with the help of wind.

554
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:55,090
Hundreds of meters?

555
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:56,940
Quite enough.

556
00:29:58,570 --> 00:29:59,380
Governor,

557
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:01,160
what else do you want to use it for?

558
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:06,640
Do you think I'm only crazy about newfangled craft?

559
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,000
No, I don't.

560
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:11,290
This is about the fate of our state.

561
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,030
By the way,

562
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:14,570
I've got a plan to carry out.

563
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:17,580
You're needed for it.

564
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,560
Let's get back to my mansion.

565
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,040
Mm.

566
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,930
According to the intel,

567
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:40,650
the latest types of crossbows made by Shu's Military Technology Department

568
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:43,540
can shoot twenty arrows in succession.

569
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,070
Extremely lethal.

570
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:46,690
They're available for cavalry and infantry.

571
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:50,550
The old type of crossbow could only shoot five arrows in succession.

572
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,700
Looks like the Shu Army has made great progress in weapons.

573
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:55,600
The latest types of crossbows

574
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,940
are named Shudu and Yuanrong.

575
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,350
Soon,

576
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:01,170
the Shu Army will be equipped with them.

577
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,480
It'll cause great pressure on our army.

578
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,040
It sounds quite different

579
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:07,970
from what we used to know.

580
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,790
To protect the secret,

581
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,270
the Shu Army has set up

582
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:13,510
countless fake workshops.

583
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:15,990
Thanks to Zhulong,

584
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,280
we've confirmed the head office.

585
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:22,740
It's in the west of Mount Dingjun.

586
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:26,020
There's a canyon among the cliffs.

587
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:30,140
Only one way leads to the head office.

588
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:34,660
Um...

589
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,930
With three lines of defense,

590
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:38,470
this place is strongly fortified.

591
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:39,920
How can we get in?

592
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:41,490
Before,

593
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,670
we couldn't sneak in.

594
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,690
But things are different now.

595
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:50,200
Chen Gong, why don't you tell Mi Chong

596
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:51,660
how we can get in?

597
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,820
Chancellor Mi.

598
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,340
The head office. The cliff.

599
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,110
The cliff.

600
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,240
The head office.

601
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:05,000
The cliff?

602
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,380
You can get in?

603
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,500
You'll fly over?

604
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,840
No way, unless you were a bird.

605
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,540
He could be a bird.

606
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:20,510
He could?

607
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,900
Very well, then.

608
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:41,770
With this, we can sneak into the head office

609
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,960
of Shu's Military Technology Department by surprise

610
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,810
and collaborate with Zhulong

611
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:49,530
to get the drawings of their latest crossbows.

612
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:50,980
Governor,

613
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:55,130
shouldn't we test if it can really fly?

614
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:57,150
Governor,

615
00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:00,250
I plan to try it in a day or two.

616
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,710
In other cases,

617
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:05,610
I would like to go with you.

618
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,710
But I can't go this time.

619
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,180
This is a matter of great importance.

620
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,940
Neither you nor I can take this risk.

621
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:12,560
I'll have someone else test the Bamboo Kite.

622
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,060
-You're so thought...
-Governor,

623
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:18,060
who will you send for this mission?

624
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:20,930
Someone from your agency.

625
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:23,090
How about...

626
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:25,990
How about Liang Jian?

627
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,100
He can go with Recorder Chen.

628
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:32,940
What's wrong?

629
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,720
Governor,

630
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:37,540
I'm not good at fieldwork.

631
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:38,680
I know.

632
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:40,580
So, I asked Liang Jian to go with you.

633
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,270
Chen Gong,

634
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,270
I mean to promote you.

635
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,630
If you want a promotion,

636
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,910
you have to make practical achievements.

637
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:56,020
Thank you, Governor.

638
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,050
I'll try my best.

639
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,690
All you need to care about is the Bamboo Kite.

640
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,470
As long as it can fly over the canyon,

641
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:04,290
leave the rest to Liang Jian.

642
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,200
If you have no more questions,

643
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,370
go back and get prepared.

644
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:09,340
Leave in three days...

645
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,120
Governor,

646
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:13,239
I have

647
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:14,630
a small question.

648
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:15,650
May I have a word with you?

649
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:17,429
All right.

650
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:30,270
Why are you so mistrustful of Chen Gong?

651
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:33,080
Yesterday, when we were hunting for Shu spies,

652
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:36,300
he appeared there and it was quite suspicious.

653
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,730
I know you don't trust him.

654
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,590
But only he can

655
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,770
assemble and operate the Bamboo Kite.

656
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:42,570
What do you suggest, then?

657
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:43,949
I do have a suggestion.

658
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:45,199
I'm all ears.

659
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,010
Don't let Liang Jian go.

660
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,560
Let me go instead.

661
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,429
It sounds feasible.

662
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,720
But you're a chancellor of Military Intelligence Agency

663
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:01,390
and he's a recorder in Tianshui.

664
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:03,720
If you disappear at the same time,

665
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,880
Shu spies will notice that.

666
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:07,620
Don't underestimate them.

667
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:12,340
It's not a problem.

668
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:17,000
Arrange a horse accident on the mountain route

669
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,030
and claim that Recorder Chen and I die in it.

670
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,270
What do you think?

671
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:22,760
Fine, then.

672
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:24,020
I'll let you go with him.

673
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,710
Thank you, Governor.

674
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,390
You must pay attention to two points.

675
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,350
First, Qingping Plan is

676
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,290
carried out by Commander himself.

677
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:36,820
Getting the drawings of Shu's crossbows is our big plan.

678
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,820
Don't take it personally.

679
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:40,000
And you mustn't fail the mission.

680
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,500
Second,

681
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,480
Chen Gong is a talent.

682
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,310
Keep him safe and sound.

683
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:49,840
Got it.

684
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:51,220
I'll protect him.

685
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:54,580
I mean it.

686
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,740
Guo Gang asked you to go to the Shu State?

687
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,400
It's a great opportunity.

688
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,360
We planned to kidnap Guo Gang

689
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,260
but it was quite risky.

690
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:33,020
And he might not speak for us.

691
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:35,900
In this mission,

692
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:37,900
can you see Zhulong?

693
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,120
I'm very likely to see him.

694
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:41,350
Awesome.

695
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:43,720
Guo Gang worried

696
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:47,540
that when Mi Chong and I disappeared at the same time,

697
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,070
Siwencao Intelligence would notice that.

698
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,950
Mi Chong came up with an idea.

699
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:54,430
He would arrange a horse accident

700
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:56,820
where he and I would die

701
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:57,810
for the state.

702
00:36:58,930 --> 00:36:59,920
When I “die”,

703
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,760
you can get out of trouble, too.

704
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,140
At last, I can go back to report on my mission.

705
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:10,730
Mm.

706
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,180
But our organization believes you betrayed us.

707
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:27,320
Your identity as Baidi may be exposed at any time.

708
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:30,560
If Zhulong knows you’re Baidi...

709
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:32,830
I'll kill Mi Chong halfway

710
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:35,970
and take his place.

711
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:38,730
From then on,

712
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,850
Chen Gong will no longer exist.

713
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,340
But you also have to deceive the Military Intelligence Agency.

714
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:48,300
It's in no way easy.

715
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:50,600
To cover the whole story,

716
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:52,010
you need a perfect plan.

717
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:53,700
What?

718
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:56,940
You don't trust me?

719
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:03,090
Things are finally turning around.

720
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,800
Feng Ying

721
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:10,700
gave you a poisonous dagger.

722
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,840
Leave it to me.

723
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,170
Be very careful.

724
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:20,020
Mm.

725
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,660
This time,

726
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,100
our contact person

727
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:27,620
will be Huang Yu,

728
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,510
the senior of Wuxian Sect.

729
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:40,020
Oh, Wuxian Sect.

730
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,790
Then you can see Di Yue.

731
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:47,420
That's great.

732
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,110
When you work with your wife, you'll make a difference.

733
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:55,650
Tomorrow morning,

734
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:56,780
you shall leave Tianshui, too.

735
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,150
Don't dwell in a dangerous place.

736
00:38:58,900 --> 00:38:59,740
Have a pleasant trip.

737
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:00,770
Have a pleasant trip, too.

738
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,540
What a pity!

739
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,060
We nearly got him cornered.

740
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,580
What else can we do?

741
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:30,390
Governor made his decision

742
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:32,770
and he won’t change his mind.

743
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,000
When Chen Gong reaches the Shu State,

744
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:36,820
he will do something.

745
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:38,900
It's not a bad thing.

746
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:42,740
When he's out there,

747
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,490
he'll have some space to maneuver.

748
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:48,640
But once he's in the Shu State,

749
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:50,860
it'll be hard to control him.

750
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:52,860
I'll play it by ear.

751
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:55,620
If something goes wrong,

752
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:58,190
I'll kill him there.

753
00:39:58,820 --> 00:39:59,780
It's too dangerous.

754
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:01,410
You mustn't let him see Zhulong.

755
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,830
Stop nagging.

756
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:07,880
How's the soldier

757
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,580
you captured alive on Xiaolong Mountain?

758
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:12,960
I asked the physician to use some tough medicine

759
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:14,470
and the soldier barely survived.

760
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:15,900
However,

761
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:17,280
he's still in a coma.

762
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,700
Those Shu soldiers

763
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,500
saw Baidi before.

764
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:24,560
You must wake him up and make him confess.

765
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:25,700
I see.

766
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,670
I'll count on you for business here.

767
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,300
Mm.

768
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:54,020
(Chen Gong’s wife, the Shu State)
(Di Yue)

769
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:57,870
Be serious.

770
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,270
Eat the meat from the same plate.

771
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:06,670
Hurry.

772
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,330
Drink the wine.

773
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:30,420
Eat the meat again.

774
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:36,670
Do it again.

775
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:43,310
Be serious.

776
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:52,870
Drink the wine again.

777
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:04,130
Eat the meat one more time.

778
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,550
Be serious, will you?

779
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:22,880
Drink the wine in the gourds.

780
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:45,920
The ceremony is over.

781
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:51,900
From this day on,

782
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:54,170
you're husband and wife.

783
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:16,060
(The 24 Strategies of War, The Wind Blows from Longxi)
(Intelligence Agency in Longxi)

784
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:19,290
(The Fourth Strategy)
(Covering the Dagger with a Smile)

785
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:21,610
Feng Ying,

786
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:22,610
you see?

787
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:23,900
Exactly as I predicted.

788
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,420
Once General Li Yan

789
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:27,020
took over Siwencao Intelligence,

790
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:29,410
he closed the case concerning Baidi

791
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:30,910
and planted his henchmen in every department

792
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:33,370
through a reshuffle.

793
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:35,060
Now even Hu Zhong

794
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:36,740
is on an equal footing to us.

795
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:38,020
There's more to it than what is said.

796
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:39,060
And their sneers.

797
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:39,990
How irritating!

798
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,510
The Wei plans

799
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:44,540
a field mission for Chen Gong and Mi Chong.

800
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:46,700
Guo Gang makes up a horse incident

801
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:47,900
and their death,

802
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:50,110
so the two can stay undercover

803
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:51,700
in Wuxian Sect

804
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:53,580
where they will find a way to steal

805
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:54,820
drawings of our latest crossbows.

806
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:56,900
Speaking of Guo Gang and Mi Chong,

807
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,420
Guo Gang is the governor

808
00:43:58,420 --> 00:43:59,790
of Tianshui, the Wei State

809
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:00,970
and also the nephew

810
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:02,310
of Guo Huai,

811
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:03,900
the founder of Military Intelligence Agency

812
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,100
of the Wei State.

813
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:07,160
Both Military Intelligence Agency

814
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:08,150
and Siwencao

815
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:09,580
are spy agencies

816
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:10,980
of the Wei

817
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:12,210
and the Shu States.

818
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,200
The Military Intelligence Agency

819
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,290
is the counterpart

820
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:16,390
of Siwencao.

821
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:17,650
So Chen Gong gaining

822
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:18,590
Guo Gang's trust

823
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,260
is of great significance

824
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:22,260
for Siwencao to gather internal intelligence

825
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:23,980
of the Wei State.

826
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:26,690
Mi Chong is the leader of Military Intelligence Agency.

827
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:28,680
As an ace spy,

828
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,340
he's trusted by his boss

829
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:32,130
and determined to capture

830
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:33,740
the Shu spy

831
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:35,010
in the Wei State.

832
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:37,500
He sets his eyes on Chen Gong.

833
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:38,060
So,

834
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:39,900
to learn more

835
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:40,940
about their story

836
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:42,740
on the field mission,

837
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:43,520
I suggest

838
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:45,250
you stay tuned

839
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:46,220
with us.
