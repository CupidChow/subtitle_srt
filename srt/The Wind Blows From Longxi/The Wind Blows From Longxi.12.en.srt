00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:19,970
Yes!

14

Report!

15
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:00,850
I have military intelligence

16
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:01,910
to report to Clerk Li!

Leader.

18
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,100
Thank God you had the foresight

19
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,510
to leave some secret passages.

20
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:12,730
It's just a pity

21
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,990
that the base camp you've run for years

22
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,120
will be destroyed.

Hanzhong

You are a Wei's nail

put into the heart of West Shu.

30
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,730

You two keep probing the situation ahead.

36
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:46,950
Yes!

37
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,300
You, and you. Come with me.

38
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:53,930
Go.

39
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:55,850

40

Let's go.

41
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,380
Look up.

42
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:08,170
You.

43
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,210
I didn't expect the obscure Wuxian Sect

44
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,050
to expand on such a scale.

45
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:13,420
You.

46
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,620

00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,339
be among the captives in disguise.

00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:18,970
Yes.

was assassinated by Wuxian Sect's killer in the camp.

53
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,850
What?

54
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:21,700
Move it there.

55
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:23,580

59
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:48,610
I'm deeply impressed

60
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:50,740
by your spirit.

61
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,840
I've run Wuxian Sect for more than ten years.

62
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,030
Preparations have long been made for Shu's suppression.

63
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,380
Otherwise,

64
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,020
how could we survive to this day?

65
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,090
Mm.

66
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,980
But it's still a pity.

67
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,930
If Zhulong had sent us messages ahead of time,

68
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,020
with your skillful military tactics,

69
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,390
we could have prepared an ambush,

70
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,460
and we might have been able

71
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:23,350
to gather the Shu Army together and wipe them out.

72
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,800
Zhulong did send us messages.

73
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,260
He just didn't do it at the right time.

74

75
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,300

Have some good rest.

77
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,830
Zhulong sent a message with a pigeon.

78
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,490
Put it here, put it here.

79
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,160
You can leave.

80
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,060

00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:16,710
You scared me.

84
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,180
I didn't expect you

85
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,730
to be so absorbed

86
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,980
in the ancient book of Wuxian Sect.

87
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,010
I noticed the disorderly books on the desk,

88
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,690
so I tidied them up for you.

89
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:33,940

90
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,340
Come on.

91
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,080
I think you want to know

92
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:03,480
what the secret letter says.

93
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,140
I've decoded the message.

94

Well...

98
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,730
That's how the situation is.

99
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,920
I did what I had to do.

100
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,640
There can be only one voice in the Agency.

101

I have to officiate at the funeral in order to capture Zhulong.

102
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:04,740
I know.

103
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,690
We have sacrificed too much.

104
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:14,760
If the infighting continues,

105
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,700
the Wei State will benefit in the end.

106
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:46,620
Alas!

107
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,990
Li Miao died tragically!

108
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,460
God shortened his life!

109
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,090
Our massive attack on Wuxian Sect

110
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,130
destroyed its lair,

111
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,550
but there were no tangible gains.

112
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,020
No one on the base camp's roster was caught.

113
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,340
That's not the reason

114
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:12,390
our army marched into Wuxian Sect

115
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:14,170
in the first place.

116
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,370
Anyway,

117
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:22,090
Wuxian Sect is a danger to the Shu State.

118
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:23,400
We should draw a clear line

119
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,800
between us and our enemies.

120
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,150
This is the bottom line.

121
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,720
Alas!

122
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,380
Hu Zhong just told me about the process.

123
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,110
Li Miao

124
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,980
was loyal and not afraid of death!

125
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,100
You set the fire

126
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:43,720
at Temple of God of Mountains, right?

127
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,820
Why do you say that?

128
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:51,320
Di Yue is an informer

129
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,870
you planted in Wuxian Sect three years ago.

130
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,960
You never told Li Miao about it, right?

131
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,240
That's because I don't trust him.

132
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,350
To prevent the destruction of both sides,

133
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,230
you determined

134
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,750
to warn Wuxian Sect.

135
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,170
Clerk Feng, where does your deduction leave me?

136
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:12,690
Doesn't that make me a traitor in the Agency?

137
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,540
I don't think Di Yue is important enough

138
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,110
for you to do that.

139
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,830
Once the operation is exposed,

140
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,860
you will be suspected as a Wei spy.

141
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,760
If you were only worried about Di Yue's safety,

142
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:26,940
you could tell us about her

143
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,710
to avoid hurting her.

144
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,490
Therefore, I think

145
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,380
you did that

146
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:33,940
for a reason.

147
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,660
If you must think in this way,

148
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:37,790
I'll have to take

149
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,380
what I heard as a story.

150
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:44,770
Really?

151
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,260
Baidi is not dead.

152
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,240
He assumed the identity of Mi Chong and infiltrated Wuxian Sect.

153
00:15:58,830 --> 00:15:59,620
Is that true?

154
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,260
I never sent any messages to Wuxian Sect.

155
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,750
What you said is a misunderstanding.

156
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:11,380
Then I must be overthinking.

157
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,260
Your agreement to dispose of Li Miao in this way

158
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,160
does show your consideration

159
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,020
of the big picture.

160
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,660
Xun Xu, remember this,

161
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,040
no matter what misunderstanding there is between us,

162
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,710
you still saved my life.

163
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,350
I'm not an ungrateful man.

164
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,000
Clerk Feng, please don't say that.

165
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,750
I was just doing my job.

166
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,230
I did what I should do.

167
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:52,180
Set off!

168
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,040
Over these years,

169
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,329
how much information did you send to Siwencao Intelligence?

170
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,710
I don't understand

171
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:22,300
what you want me to say.

172
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:27,800
You lied to me.

173
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:41,800
Di Yi.

174
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,500
What do you take me for?

175
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,320
Just drop the act, will you?

176
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,750
Tell me.

177
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,640
I've been serving you with my whole heart.

178
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,750
I'm not a Shu spy.

179
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:58,730
Believe me.

180
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,380
Leader.

181
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,060
I'm not a Shu spy.

182
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,540
How could I be a Shu spy?

183
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:06,460
Tell me.

184
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,580
For the sake of the time we spent together,

185
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,540
I'll spare your life.

186
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,810
Leader Huang, trust me.

187
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,340
I'm not a Shu spy.

188
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,650
Believe me.

189
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,900
That's my girl.

190
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,660
I like your stubbornness.

191
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,350
I'm not a Shu spy.

192
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,660
Leader Huang, trust me.

193
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,650
Good!

194
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,230
You have

195
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,570
a hundred ways to die in Wuxian Sect.

196
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,680
You'll find one you like.

197
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:00,830
(Siwencao Intelligence, the Shu State, Nanzheng)

198
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:01,460
Xun Xu.
(Siwencao Intelligence, the Shu State, Nanzheng)

199
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,470
(Siwencao Intelligence, the Shu State, Nanzheng)

200
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,190
Xun Xu.
(Siwencao Intelligence, the Shu State, Nanzheng)

201
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,980
(Siwencao Intelligence, the Shu State, Nanzheng)

202
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:04,990
What did
(Siwencao Intelligence, the Shu State, Nanzheng)

203
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:05,820
What did

204
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,780
Clerk Feng say to you?

205
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,700
I guess that's

206
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,380
what he is going to tell us soon.

207
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,460
Give me a tip.

208
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:18,610
He said

209
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,250
this case is closed.

210
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,770
Clerk Feng

211
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,270
is trusted by General Li Yan now.

212
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,960
Is Clerk Feng on his side now?

213
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:31,700
What about Ma Sheng and Liao Hui?

214
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,730
Just let it go like that?

215
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:35,470
What else can we do?

216
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,710
Do we not see enough of such things

217
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,410
in Siwencao Intelligence?

218
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,100
All right.

219
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,580
Let's go.

220
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,880
The Siwencao Intelligence theft case has been solved.

221
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,390
It has nothing to do with Clerk Feng and Chief Sun.

222
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:55,190
The arrest warrant of Clerk Cao issued earlier

223
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:56,690
is officially revoked.

224
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:57,940
Clerk Cao is reinstated now.

225
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,430
From now on, Siwencao Intelligence

226
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,820
will still be in Clerk Feng's charge.

227
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,800
The suppression of Wuxian Sect this time

228
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,340
destroyed their base camp and achieved a fruitful result,

229
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:13,220
but there are also oversights to reflect on.

230
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,880
Especially the unexpected fire at the Temple of God of Mountains

231
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,630
before the night attack on Wuxian Sect's base camp

232
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:21,720
which gave Wuxian Sect's leader and elders a chance to escape.

233
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,220
Whether there is anyone among us

234
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,500
tipping off Wuxian Sect

235
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,380
needs to be found out.

236
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,580
General Hu Zhong is forethoughtful.

237
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:39,180
I can't agree more.

238
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,860
About the fire at the Temple of God of Mountains,

239
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:43,920
we need to make an internal investigation

240
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,570
to guard against the infiltration of the spies of Wei and Wuxian Sect.

241
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,620
Chief Xun.

242
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,460
Is there any difficulty to finish the internal investigation

243
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:54,220
and report to us by the end of the month?

244
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,720
General Hu Zhong, Clerk Feng, don't worry.

245
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,190
The Internal Affairs Department will work on this case right away.

246
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,750
Don't hit me.

247
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,740
Sun Ling, it's me.

248
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:30,520
You've suffered a lot.

249
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:34,300
Feng Ying.

250
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,580
Feng Ying.

251
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:40,100
I didn't confess to false charges under torture.

252
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,820
I've made it through.

253
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,030
It's over.

254
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,460
It's a false accusation.

255
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,260
Chief Xun.

256
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,930
Is this case closed just like that?

257
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,920
Clerk Feng should give you an explanation at least.

258
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,300
It was just empty talk.

259
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,070
He said it was for the overall situation.

260
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,020
I didn't expect

261
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,490
Clerk Feng to be such a person.

262
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,400
All right, don't think about it.

263
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,750
Just do your job.

264
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:42,620
We will never know

265
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,220
what our superiors are thinking.

266
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:51,060
Did he mention Baidi?

267
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,940
It's Clerk Feng after all.

268
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:00,960
I guess I can no longer hide it from him.

269
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,560
But I didn't admit it anyway.

270
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,510
In this case,

271
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:10,020
distrust will grow between you two.

272
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,580
There is too much for me to care.

273
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,620
Baidi and Di Yue are in great danger now.

274
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,460
It's a lot harder for them.

275
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:24,160
But I'm sure they'll be fine.

276
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,600
We can't let her get away with it.

277
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:26,660
We must catch her.

278
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,700
(Wuxian Sect New Base Camp, Border of the Shu State)
We must catch her.

279
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,370
(Wuxian Sect New Base Camp, Border of the Shu State)

280
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:29,540
Zhulong sent a secret message.
(Wuxian Sect New Base Camp, Border of the Shu State)

281
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:29,980
(Wuxian Sect New Base Camp, Border of the Shu State)

282
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,980
The Shu spy who leaked our secrets
(Wuxian Sect New Base Camp, Border of the Shu State)

283
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,130
has been found out.

284
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,480
It's Saint Lady.

285
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:36,480
Saint Lady.

286
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,870
I can't believe she is the Shu spy.

287
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:39,880
Mister Mi.

288
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,370
It's hard to believe.

289
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,020
Is there solid evidence?

290
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,870
I wouldn't believe it

291
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,150
if I hadn't seen it.

292
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:54,450
When Leader Huang caught Saint...

293
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:56,800
Di Yue,

294
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:59,250
she was stealing the secret message sent by Zhulong.

295
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:01,520
I'll go to check it.

296
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,400
Leader Huang

297
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,390
is interrogating her in person.

298
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:10,970
I'm

299
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,460
a Chancellor of Military Intelligence Agency.

300
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,880
I'm experienced in interrogating.

301
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:48,620
Leader.

302
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,370
Leader, has she confessed?

303
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:51,430
Has she confessed?

304
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,050
Chen Gong.

305
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,340
What a misfortune.

306
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,620
I caught her stealing it,

307
00:24:58,090 --> 00:24:59,090
but she still won't admit it!

308
00:24:59,110 --> 00:24:59,750
Leader.

309
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,340
Don't torture her.

310
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:04,910
If she is wronged,

311
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,700
it will be too late to regret it.

312
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,680
A

313
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,100
carrot-and-stick approach

314
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,370
would be more effective

315
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:12,480
in such a situation.

316
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,380
You're wise.

317
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,490
You're the Chancellor of Tianshui Military Intelligence.

318
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:23,260
You know how to deal with Shu spies.

319
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:27,190
You do it.

320
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,370
Okay, I'll do it.

321
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:43,210
Tell me.

322
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,860
Are you a Shu spy?

323
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:11,950
Tell me.

324
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:16,120
Are you a Shu spy?

325
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,470
I'll get you out of here.

326
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,340
Bah!

327
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,010
You shameless Wei spy.

328
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,060
Kill me now if you are a man!

329
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:34,060
Otherwise, I'll kill you all one day!

330
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:36,180
Shameless woman!

331
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:36,970
Kill me!

332
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:37,770
You finally confessed!

333
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:38,090
Mister Mi!

334
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:38,860
Don't torture her!

335
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,380
Mister Mi!

336
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,250
Do you want to die?

337
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,560
Do you want to bite off your tongue?

338
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,860
It's not that easy.

339
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:50,410
Water!

340
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:01,010
What did you give her?

341
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,800
An elixir.

342
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,690
The elixir

343
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,100
is Wuxian Sect's secret drug.

344
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,710
It makes one feel like a fairy after taking it.

345
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:55,020
The whole body

346
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:58,250
will feel free.

347
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,940
It's like in heaven.

348
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:10,800
That shameless woman

349
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,940
took the elixir

350
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,160
and instantly went limp.

351
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:18,910
She has no strength to resist anymore.

352
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:22,770
When the drug kicks in,

353
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,980
she will get high and feel like she is in a fairyland.

354
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:28,170
At that time,

355
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,790
I'll use the carrot-and-stick approach.

356
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:34,170
With the effects of the drug,

357
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,060
the pain

358
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:37,760
will be more unbearable.

359
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,180
After a few rounds,

360
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,820
there is no way she won't tell the truth.

361
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,870
Leader, you're cruel and harsh.

362
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:49,450
I'm impressed.

363
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:54,850
Let's go.

364
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:57,490
You and I

365
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,110
should have a couple of drinks.

366
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,070
In a few hours,

367
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:04,670
we will see what will happen.

368
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:07,840
We will see what will happen.

369
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:23,540
(Siwencao Intelligence, the Shu State, Nanzheng)

370
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,180
Is it right?

371
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:43,530
Tangbing.

372
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:45,340
This time,

373
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,820
you need to help me out.

374
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:48,980
What's wrong?

375
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:51,500
Yes,

376
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,240
Clerk Feng has just returned to the Agency,

377
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,370
and you were

378
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,750
a little close with Clerk Li,

379
00:29:58,770 --> 00:29:59,810
but it's not that serious.

380
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,080
You don't know

381
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:05,970
that

382
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,020
I've embarked on a hopeless adventure.

383
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,970
I'm doomed this time.

384
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:12,020
That sounds too serious.

385
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,930
Clerk Li died of fighting the enemy.

386
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:16,530
He is Siwencao Intelligence's hero.

387
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,900
How would being close with him

388
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,920
make you hopeless?

389
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:23,150
Don't you find

390
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,220
the death of Clerk Li

391
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:28,530
a little strange?

392
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:29,690
What?

393
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,840
Chief Yin, you can't just say something like that.

394
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,260
Yes, yes. I shouldn't have said it.

395
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,460
It just slipped from my tongue.

396
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,840
We're brothers. Just cut to the chase.

397
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,350
Look,

398
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:47,830
you need my help,

399
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:49,580
but you won't tell me what happened.

400
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,520
Aren't you making it difficult for me?

401
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,320
I'll die whether I tell you or not.

402
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,190
Now Clerk Feng is back. After he investigates me,

403
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,020
he will know I did it.

404
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:05,590
You're making it crazier.

405
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:07,950
Why would he investigate you?

406
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:15,690
Ma Sheng

407
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,640
was killed by me.

408
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:26,480
What did you say?

409
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,650
Was Ma Sheng

410
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,920
killed by you?

411
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,170
Qingping Plan of Wuxian Sect is set.

412
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:46,580
It's midnight the day after tomorrow.

413
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:48,830
This day is finally coming.

414
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:50,660
I'm getting curious.

415
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,970
I want to see who Zhulong is.

416
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:00,140
I need to go to Mount Dingjun

417
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:01,650
and arrange an escape route for Baidi.

418
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,940
After Ma Sheng and Liao Hui died,

419
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:05,610
the Agency adopted shift work system.

420
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:06,900
You'll be on duty the day after tomorrow.

421
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:07,820
I know.

422
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:10,170
That's why I need you to cooperate with me.

423
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:11,960
It's not hard.

424
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,130
The hard part is how you can get into the Military Technology Department.

425
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,550
It was Li Miao who dragged me into this

426
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,460
and forced me to do it!

427
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,190
Li Miao forced me to do it!

428
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:21,930
I...

429
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:26,900
Tangbing.

430
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,610
There is still one day left.

431
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,560
Let's think about it.

432
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,310
Chief Yin.

433
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:48,620
You made a huge mistake this time.

434
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,640
You don't know what Clerk Li can do.

435
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,030
He's a ruthless and cruel man.

436
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,690
What's more,

437
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,960
he was arrogant and aggressive in front of General Li Yan at that time,

438
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,590
and the Agency was under his control.

439
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:05,620
How would I dare

440
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:07,300
to disobey him?

441
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:08,990
The bottom line.

442
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:12,370
Do you know what the bottom line is?

443
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:15,500
It's the line you can't cross.

444
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,230
Tangbing.

445
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,730
You are the chief of the Intelligence Analysis Department.

446
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:21,070
Help me come up

447
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,780
with a way out.

448
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:29,490
There is a way out of the desperate situation.

449
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:30,700
However...

450
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:33,310
Yin Ji! Yin Ji!

451
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:35,340
Don't do this! Get up!

452
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:37,250
You're my brother. Don't do this.

453
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,260
Hurry.

454
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,630
What is it?

455
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:42,250
I have an idea,

456
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:45,730
but I need you to do me a favor.

457
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:47,140
What favor?

458
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,810
Aren't you going to Mount Dingjun sometime later?

459
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,450
I hope you can let me go for you.

460
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,720
I have a good friend

461
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:58,590
whose name is Cheng Fan.

462
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,840
He is in Mount Dingjun with General Ma Dai.

463
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,540
We haven't met for a long time, and I miss him a lot.

464
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:04,440
That's it?

465
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,350
No problem.

466
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:06,320
You can go.

467
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:08,480
I'm not in the mood for a business trip

468
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,469
considering my situation right now.

469
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,250
All right. All right.

470
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,260
What's the way out?

471
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:17,270
What do you think of Clerk Feng?

472
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:19,670
Well...

473
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,210
Clerk Feng

474
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:23,960
doesn't tolerate betrayal,

475
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:26,889
and he can be a little petty sometimes,

476
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,710
but he has one weakness,

477
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:32,580
which is Siwencao Intelligence.

478
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:35,960
He founded it on his own

479
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,159
and he has run it for years.

480
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,760
It's the foundation of his life.

481
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:40,909
Here is the first point.

482
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:42,580
The second point is,

483
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,380
Chief Yin,

484
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:47,010
you're in a good position.

485
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:50,320
The Operations Department

486
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:51,420
is the most important department of Siwencao Intelligence.

487
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:54,080
You're in charge of

488
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:55,330
everything concerning the foreign intelligence,

489
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:56,580
right?

490
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:57,090
Think about this.

491
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:01,570
All the practical jobs,

492
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,750
like the training, installation, contact, dispatch, and rear support

493
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,160
of the spies in Wei and Wu,

494
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:06,260
are done by you guys.

495
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:09,740
Your position is irreplaceable.

496
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,600
My position?

497
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:16,510
What does it have to do with my situation?

498
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,290
He cherishes and protects talents

499
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:22,910
for the sake of Siwencao Intelligence.

500
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:26,300
Yes, you killed Ma Sheng,

501
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,120
and you got on Li Miao's board.

502
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,990
You can just get down from it.

503
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:32,570
How?

504
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,390
Go directly to Clerk Feng

505
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:37,180
and tell him exactly what happened

506
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:38,300
without keeping anything from him.

507
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:39,510
Well...

508
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:41,730
I...

509
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:43,580
Won't it be suicidal for me

510
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,300
to see him?

511
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:49,160
Do you want to wait for him to trace you down?

512
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,820
It will be too late by then.

513
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:55,210
Think about it.

514
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,270
Take the initiative to confess your crime

515
00:35:57,870 --> 00:36:01,070
and beg for mercy before he knows it.

516
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:04,620
Doesn't it show your determination

517
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:07,020
to get on a different board?

518
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,030
Yin Ji.

519
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:17,080
I've told you

520
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,110
the way out of the desperate situation.

521
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,170
You can decide

522
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:22,500
whether to do it or not.

523
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:41,980
(Wuxian Sect New Base Camp, Border of the Shu State)

524
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:44,340
The Shu Army attacked us today by surprise,

525
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:47,360
but we broke through successfully.

526
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,080
Although we suffered some losses,

527
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:51,570
it didn't hurt our foundation.

528
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,850
It's worth celebrating!

529
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:56,730
Come on.

530
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,880
Let's have a drink.

531
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,680
Thanks to Leader Huang's foresight of the enemy's movements

532
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,260
and wise command,

533
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,230
otherwise, we don't know what would happen to us.

534
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,530
Yeah.

535
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:10,080
Thanks to Leader Huang!

536
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,190
Here's to Leader Huang!

537
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,660
Here's to Leader Huang!

538
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,300
Come on.

539
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,380
Go ahead.

540
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,610
Here's to Leader Huang.

541
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,000
I didn't expect Saint Lady

542
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:26,270
to be a Shu spy.

543
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:35,550
Today, the Shu spy is exposed.

544
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:38,370
Isn't it another good thing?

545
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,190
Today,

546
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:42,760
another hidden danger to Wuxian Sect

547
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:45,020
has been gotten rid of.

548
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,660
Why don't we have another drink?

549
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:50,710
Yeah. Come on.

550
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:52,530
Come on. Let's have another drink.

551
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:53,440
Come on.

552
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,780
Chancellor Mi.

553
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,300
I have

554
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,380
something important to discuss with you.

555
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,100
Leader.

556
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:25,190
Your wife...

557
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,610
No, that shameless woman.

558
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,300
What are you going to do with her?

559
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:30,220
No hurry.

560
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:33,660
It will take some time for the elixir to kick in.

561
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,660
I'll interrogate her at about ten tonight.

562
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:38,960
Ten?

563
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:49,750
There is

564
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,150
one more thing.

565
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:52,090
Please go ahead.

566
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,290
Qingping Plan will be launched

567
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:58,020
the day after tomorrow at midnight,

568
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:01,160
but it's too far from our new base.

569
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:04,380
You need to leave tomorrow morning.

570
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,300
I'm always ready.

571
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,300
All you need to do is to make an order.

572
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:10,430
Mm.

573
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:12,100
At that time,

574
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:15,500
I'll lead our people to cooperate with you on the perimeter.

575
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,400
Bring an elite team with you

576
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,080
to enter the head office.

577
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:23,730
I've chosen the members.

578
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,490
I can use the Bamboo Kite

579
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,790
to escape,

580
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:30,160
but it will be a one-way trip

581
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:33,170
for the rest of them.

582
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:36,450
To die for the Qingping Plan

583
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,590
is their blessing.

584
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:46,430
I take orders from you.

585
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,940
Zhulong just sent us

586
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,140
the password of the head office,

587
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,590
which changes according to the time of day.

588
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:01,530
That's great.

589
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:03,610
With the password,

590
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,680
the chance of a successful sneak attack

591
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:07,370
has increased by 20%.

592
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,070
Mm.

593
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,320
After you get the design,

594
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:15,270
the elders and the congregants

595
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,290
will hold them back for you.

596
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,050
Mm.

597
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,220
You go straight to the backyard.

598
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,040
There is

599
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:24,840
a stone gate in the backyard,

600
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,780
but it can only be opened from the outside.

601
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:29,220
You can't go out through it.

602
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:31,810
You must go to the east side

603
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,540
of the backyard and jump off the cliff.

604
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,220
On the east side is the cliff.

605
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:38,200
The Shu Army

606
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:39,820
won't put guards there.

607
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:45,980
I'll wait for your triumphant return

608
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:47,990
in the East Valley of Mount Dingjun.

609
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,290
Just in case, though,

610
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:54,650
if something goes wrong.

611
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,850
and we can't meet,

612
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:58,860
send the design

613
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:02,150
to the big camphor tree at Gujian Xikou.

614
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,580
Zhulong will be there waiting for you.

615
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:08,180
It's 9:45 AM the next day.

616
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:10,140
Remember,

617
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:12,260
you mustn't be late.

618
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,620
I have a question.

619
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:17,150
If I risk my life

620
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:18,380
to give the design

621
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,750
to Zhulong,

622
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:21,710
at that time,

623
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:22,740
the whole mountain

624
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,060
will be surrounded by the Shu Army.

625
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:26,950
How is Zhulong going to leave Shu

626
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:27,980
with the design

627
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,720
and send it back to Tianshui?

628
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:30,910
I don't know, either.

629
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:33,850
Why should we worry about that?

630
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,300
Just assume that he is a resourceful man

631
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:40,100
and he knows how to do it.

632
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,960
I'll be there at 9:45 AM.

633
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:54,710
I'll come to you

634
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:56,810
at midnight

635
00:41:58,170 --> 00:41:59,340
and invite you to see a good show

636
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:01,750
in the jail.

637
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:06,380
Elder Guan and Elder Xie

638
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,860
will die in Mount Dingjun this time.

639
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,140
I'll go to them for another drink

640
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:13,300
as a farewell.

641
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:17,090
Alcohol is bad for health.

642
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:20,340
Leader, take good care of yourself.

643
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:28,020
Thank you.

644
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,160
I know what I'm doing.

645
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:36,470
Thank you.

646
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:08,390
(The 24 Strategies of War, The Wind Blows from Longxi)
(Intelligence Agency in Longxi)

647
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,210
(The Twelfth Strategy, Catch the Thief by Closing the Escape Route)

648
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:14,200
It was bad for Wuxian Sect this time.

649
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:16,480
The base camp was wiped out.

650
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,230
Huang Yu had to lead his big team

651
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:19,380
to head for Qingfeng Ridge.

652
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:21,470
They got a message from Zhulong

653
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,130
just as they got settled in the new base camp.

654
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:25,800
His look changed after he read it.

655
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:27,630
But Huang Yu is no fool.

656
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:29,920
He left the door open after reading the message

657
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:31,950
and caught Di Yue,

658
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:33,140
using the strategy of catching the thief by closing the escape route.

659
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:34,240
See for yourself.

660
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:35,950
The decoded message says

661
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:38,620
that the spy in Wuxian Sect is a woman.

662
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:40,140
Well, well, Di Yue.

663
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,400
You were in too much of a hurry.

664
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:45,010
Huang Yu is a bad guy indeed.

665
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:46,820
He actually tortured Di Yue

666
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:50,000
and gave her an elixir.

667
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:51,300
I think it's highly possible

668
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:54,580
that Huang Yu wanted to use Di Yue as bait.

669
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,320
Chen Gong.

670
00:43:55,410 --> 00:43:56,540
You know how to deal with Shu spies.

671
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:57,700
You do it.

672
00:43:58,230 --> 00:43:59,710
He wanted Chen Gong to be exposed,

673
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:01,380
then he would win the game.

674
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,910
How shrewd he is.

675
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:04,660
There is a reason you're the leader.

676
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:06,540
Can Chen Gong

677
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:08,430
carry out Qingping Plan successfully

678
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:10,680
and steal the design of the crossbow?

679
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,660
Will Zhulong

680
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:13,800
show up in the end?

681
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:14,710
Can Chen Gong

682
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:16,290
save Di Yue?

683
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,920
What changes will there be

00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:21,140
after Feng Ying took over Siwencao Intelligence again?

685
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:26,180
I just got out of jail,

686
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,470
and my wounds are still healing.

687
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:29,830
Now I'm going to poke around.
