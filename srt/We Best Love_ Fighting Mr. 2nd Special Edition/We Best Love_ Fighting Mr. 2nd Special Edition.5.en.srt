Pei Shou Yi!

25
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,050
What are you looking at, Yi?

26
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,550
Nothing.

27
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:43,450
Nothing?

28
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,290
Okay, I understand.

29
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,420
I've been asked to go to the police station.

30
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,630
I'm gonna take care of this.

31
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,470
Do you think Yu Zhen Xuan stole it?

32
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,170
No.

33
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,910
With his abilities,

34
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,110
he wouldn't get caught.

35
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:11,850
Multiple IP addresses were traced back to him.

36
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,750
It's just so...

Thank you

40
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,520
for the specific and graphic description.

41
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,230
What do you think?

42
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,230
Although...

43
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,570
hacking into our system

44
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,640
can be done remotely,

45
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,010
our security system

46
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:40,580
shows no sign of being attacked by any virus.

47
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,050
The only possibility is

48
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,080
that someone set a back door

49
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,720
on purpose when writing Alpha

50
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,890
and stole it that way.

51
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:56,620
So you're saying

52
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,630
the thief is in our...

53
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,970
I'll definitely restore Alpha.

54
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,160
Not only should we restore it,

55
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,160
but we should also make it clear
whether there is a leakage of it.

56
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,860
I hope it's not sold yet.

57
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,580
Otherwise...

58
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,800
Don't worry.

59
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,800
We already reported it to the police.

60
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,480
The company is now investigating it as well.

61
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,390
The evildoer might not take
further action these days.

62
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:26,850
Then it would be safe.

63
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,660
Don't work till it's too late.

64
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,230
Rest early.

65
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,200
Nighty-night.

66
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:44,240
Are you going to watch over me?

67
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,480
Are you tempting me, Vice President Zhou?

68
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,650
Then, Chief Executive Officer Gao,

69
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,790
will you be tempted by me?

70
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:58,780
Mr. Liu.

71
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,850
Yu Zhen Xuan is just a suspect for now.

72
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:02,920
You're free to go.

73
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,290
But consultant crime

74
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,520
is quite complicated.

75
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,260
We're gonna need your further cooperation.

76
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,460
No problem.

77
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,160
Here are some documents.

78
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,460
I need you to sign these.

79
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,330
What's he doing?

80
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,130
Sir...

81
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:19,130
Yu Zhen Xuan.

82
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:20,300
You're free to go.

83
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,540
(Culprits area)

84
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,970
This is a police station, not a restaurant!

85
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,410
Mr. Yu.

86
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,210
Can you hear me?

87
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,510
Please don't trouble us, okay?

88
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,010
I'm sorry. I'll take care of it.

89
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:31,550
OK. Thank you.

90
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,490
What do you want?

91
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,060
How much longer do you want to stay here?

92
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,600
I know everyone is upset

93
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,000
as Alpha has been stolen.

94
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,070
But I'll never say dumb things

95
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,740
like "what can't defeat us makes us stronger."

96
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:58,810
You just did.

97
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,610
We're not in a desperate situation yet.

98
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,950
The good news is

99
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,220
the stolen part

100
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,650
is just a basic system.

101
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,990
The real key core code...

102
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:16,890
is here.

103
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,830
I know it's hard to recover all the codes.

104
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,900
But I believe

105
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,900
everyone in this room

106
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,500
is good enough.

107
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,570
We can absolutely make it by the due day

108
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:32,970
and go through this obstacle.

109
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,640
We have worked so hard on it

110
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,980
and now it got stolen.

111
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,510
I can't let it go like that.

112
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,620
Sir,

113
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,220
I'll do whatever you say.

114
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:44,620
Yeah.

115
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,290
Right.

116
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:48,160
We'll all follow your orders.

117
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,560
I'd like to thank you all

118
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,930
on behalf of the company.

119
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,960
I'll pay double for the overtime.

120
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,600
Additional bonus

121
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,640
for each team's progress.

122
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:08,110
You heard him?

123
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,110
There's a bonus!

124
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,810
So we're gonna have to work harder

125
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:11,910
to make up for it.

126
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,850
Lin, Shan Zhi, Lu.

127
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,520
Get your team reassigned.

128
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,720
We're already a little behind.

129
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,960
OK, go to tell Joanne.

130
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,430
Thank you.

131
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:33,400
Lu.

132
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,100
Give me the compatibility file.

133
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,710
Yu Chen, did Lin tell you?

134
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:45,480
The statistics are different.

135
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,110
I'll check on it.

136
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,020
Okay.

137
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,990
That's what we have done so far for Alpha's repairs.

138
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,520
Even though we've been working overtime

139
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:57,930
and we're ahead of schedule,

140
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,560
we can't slack.

141
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,630
OK, let's

142
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,760
summarize the situation now

143
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,030
for tomorrow's transition.

144
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,600
Yi Mian's team should be all right, right?

145
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,870
Yes, it's fine.

146
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,970
Then the problem is in Lin's group.

147
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,670
Did you write down the problems today?

148
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,210
Yeah.

149
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:14,940
All of them.

150
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,140
Here.

151
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,310
Let me see.

152
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,550
Late-night snacks!

153
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,120
Thank you.

154
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,920
Eat something first.

155
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,490
Bing Wei, what takes you so long?

156
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,620
I almost fell asleep, waiting for you.

157
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,490
Remember

158
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,020
to tell Shan Zhi tomorrow.

159
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:28,620
Yeah, sure.

160
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,260
Those we talked about.

161
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,630
This one is for Shu Yi.

162
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:35,560
Yi Mian, you are always the first
when there is food.

163
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,660
I'm hungry.

164
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,500
Did you write everything down?

165
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,430
Do you want some?

166
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,470
You have it first.

167
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,540
Let's eat together.

168
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:46,210
One minute.

169
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,440
Or should I feed you?

170
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,310
Go and hide.

171
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,250
Come on, you idiot.

172
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,790
I've managed to explain to the head office.

173
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,520
But some directors are still
keeping an eye on Hua Cing.

174
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,560
Make some trouble
for the company they're in charge of

175
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,230
to distract them.

176
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:23,800
What?

177
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,470
Bing Wei.

178
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:25,810
Come to help me.

179
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,410
But I don't know anything about finance.

180
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:30,680
What can I do to help?

181
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:38,890
Okay.

182
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:39,790
Let's call it a day.

183
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:40,990
Go home and have some rest.

184
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,720
It's okay. I'm fine.

185
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,090
I'm gonna hang in there for a bit.

186
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,360
You guys have worked at it for days.

187
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,390
Get some rest.

188
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,060
This is the part I'm in charge of.

189
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,030
All right, well, then, go get them yourself.

190
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,800
Go home now.

191
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,800
Go.

192
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,290
What are you doing back here?

193
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:48,590
To be your company.

194
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:53,260
How was dinner?

195
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,130
Full of food and tricks.

196
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,870
I lost my appetite at the sight of them.

197
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,010
The point of a meal

198
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:11,950
is not the food

199
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,650
but the person you're with.

200
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,660
This isn't the last time.

201
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,960
There will be more banquets like this

202
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:28,030
until next year's reelection
of the board of directors.

203
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,000
I can help you prepare midnight snacks.

204
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,940
I have to be the chairman of Cheng Yi Group!

205
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,620
Not just for my dad,

206
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,220
but also for myself.

207
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,690
I know.

208
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,090
You've always wanted to be number one

209
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,860
just to prove you can take over the company.

210
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,930
But you ruined it.

211
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,100
But you'll have me as your man.

212
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,840
After we transfer everything...

213
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,370
I don't want to hold you up.

214
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,910
You can do whatever you want.

215
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,620
Whatever I want?

216
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,450
All I want is to

217
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:30,720
be there for you.

218
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,260
No matter how high your position will be,

219
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,530
I'll be there by your side.

220
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,570
I'm fine with that.

221
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,540
But do you have to be this close?

222
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,680
You turned yourself around.

223
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:51,950
Did I?

224
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,230
It's okay.

225
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,300
You're putting too much pressure on yourself.

226
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:17,840
You know?

227
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,440
I am here.

228
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,050
OK.

229
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,170
Yi.

230
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,080
We've got so much food here.

231
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,410
Why are you having instant noodles?

232
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,010
I like it.

233
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:10,060
Yi, that Mr. Yu

234
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,390
hasn't come here in days.

235
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,360
Yeah.

236
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,660
Is he busy?

237
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,700
Why do you care?

238
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,400
Well...

239
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,170
It would be nice to have extra help.

240
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:22,100
Yeah, and he's so hardworking.

241
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,600
He shares the workload whenever he's here.

242
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:30,780
Yi.

243
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,180
Clean the table when you're done.

244
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,210
Make sure you turn off the lights.

245
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,150
I'm full. I'll leave it to you.

246
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,200
Okay, fine.

247
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:20,960
Welcome home.

248
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,900
Shu Yi, you're back.

249
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,270
Who stole Alpha exactly?

250
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,100
Be careful.

251
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:06,960
I'm sorry.

252
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:09,730
I broke our agreement

253
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:11,630
and met Shu Yi earlier.

254
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,480
These are my corporate records
in the United States.

255
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,480
Real estates.

256
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,610
Personal property.

257
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:30,420
Bank statements.

258
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,450
And will.

259
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:37,060
In addition to what's for the legal obligation,

260
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,060
the rest will be Shu Yi's.

261
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,330
I know

262
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,530
these are not up to your standards.

263
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,440
But they are all I've got.

264
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,670
Are those the betrothal presents?

265
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,310
It's fine.

266
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,080
You may consider this my dowry.

267
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:05,150
There's no way you're getting into my family.

268
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:08,520
It's all right.

269
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,560
I can let Shu Yi get into mine.

270
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:14,290
Both my mom and my stepdad

271
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:15,630
welcome him.

272
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:25,770
Brat!

273
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,850
Five years ago, I gave in

274
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,610
because I didn't want to put Shu Yi in a dilemma.

275
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:36,450
But I didn't expect it to hurt him even more.

276
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:38,720
This time,

277
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,150
I'll face you together with Shu Yi.

278
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:44,560
You think you can do that?

279
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,260
Yes.

280
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,430
Actually...

281
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,100
Uncle.

282
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,560
I'm more concerned about you right now

283
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,000
because that means

284
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,770
you'll be on his opposite side.

285
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:57,940
Shu Yi may,

286
00:22:58,570 --> 00:22:59,770
possibly,

287
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:02,340
probably

288
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:04,580
hate you.

289
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:09,920
Are you threatening me?

290
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,120
No.

291
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,260
I'm just telling the truth.

292
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,360
You played weak before.

293
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,000
Oh.

294
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:23,830
I didn't.

295
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,300
I haven't

296
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,330
asked you about the emails yet.

297
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,100
But if it can make Shu Yi happy,

298
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,540
I wouldn't mind playing weak a few more times.

299
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,450
You ungrateful creature!

300
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:39,580
So you're

301
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,950
admitting it?

302
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,360
Dad.

303
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,730
Don't call me that!

304
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:55,130
I'm not admitting anything.

305
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,360
Absolutely not!

306
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:03,070
I know what happened to Hua Cing Technology.

307
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,110
If it isn't handled properly,

308
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:09,410
you won't stand any chance with Shu Yi.

309
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:13,280
Thank you.

310
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:16,280
I won't let you down.

311
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,490
Shu Yi likes this.

312
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:42,580
I've finished adjusting the table. It's fine.

313
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,480
Great.

314
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,480
How about you, Lin?

315
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:45,750
All done.

316
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,710
Lu?

317
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:47,780
No problem.

318
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,580
Yi Mian?

319
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,820
That's about it. No problem.

320
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,690
I want to thank you all for your support.

321
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:56,790
We've finally finished Alpha in time,

322
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:59,290
including the most difficult part,
program integration.

323
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:01,430
We are the best!

324
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:09,800
The bonus will be paid next month

325
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,310
along with your salary.

326
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:15,040
Thank you for saving Hua Cing Technology.

327
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,410
Cool.

328
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:24,620
Bonus!

329
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,550
To celebrate,

330
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:27,420
I'll treat you to lunch!

331
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:28,960
Really?

332
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,460
Go.

333
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,730
Great!

334
00:25:34,716 --> 00:25:54,770
(Hua Cing Technology)

335
00:26:00,542 --> 00:26:05,247
(Hua Cing Technology)

336
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,000
Is it downloaded?

337
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:26,680
Why are you doing this?

338
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,820
I take you as one of us.

339
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,750
Is it worth it?

340
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:41,090
I really didn't think it would be Lin.

341
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,700
Well.

342
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:47,070
I knew it was her.

343
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,040
Why didn't you tell us then?

344
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,400
Yeah.

345
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:55,640
Sir.

346
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,410
Sorry.

347
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,480
I'm sorry. We didn't know it.

348
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,450
Sorry, it is our fault.

349
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,050
I thought you said no downsizing.

350
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,320
Why did she still do that?

351
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,460
Maybe somebody paid good money.

352
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,600
Money makes the mare go.

353
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,500
Right.

354
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,700
Bing Wei hasn't brought Yu Zhen Xuan back yet?

355
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:25,170
I just contacted him.

356
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:28,010
He said Yu Zhen Xuan didn't want to leave.

357
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,810
Looks like we're gonna have to
call in reinforcements.

358
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:02,840
Yu Zhen Xuan.

359
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,740
The real culprit has been found

360
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,950
yet you're still handcuffing yourself.

361
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,510
It's considered interference
with public function.

362
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:08,650
Sue me then.

363
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,890
You can't keep doing this.

364
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,220
Are you listening?

365
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,090
Hello.

366
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:18,860
May I help you?

367
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:19,930
I'm looking for Yu Zhen Xuan.

368
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,260
Mr. Liu.

369
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,260
Someone is here for you.

370
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,200
Please.

371
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,540
Talk some sense into him.

372
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,740
The police station is not a restaurant.

373
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:31,600
You can't stay as long as you want.

374
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,740
I understand.

375
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,240
(Culprits area)
Sorry.

376
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:34,310
Thank you.

377
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,060
(Next episode)
My heart is empty.

378
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,630
There's nothing in it.

379
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:58,400
And nothing will be in there.

380
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,570
Pei Shou Yi.

381
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:03,200
Not even a little bit?

382
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:07,110
Are you happy now?
