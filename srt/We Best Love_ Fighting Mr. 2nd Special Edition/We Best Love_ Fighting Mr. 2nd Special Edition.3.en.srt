I...

89
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:20,240
Shu Yi has decided to break up with you.

90
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,240
Don't come looking for him again.

91
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,350
Impossible.

92
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,590
He wouldn't do that.

93
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,130
There must be some misunderstanding.

94
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,230
Let me see him.

95
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,700
Just once.

96
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,800
If he hadn't decided to break up,

97
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,700
why would he have given me his phone

98
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,540
and got a new phone number?

99
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,810
Give up.

100
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:58,610
That's the end of young people's love game.

101
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:01,320
There's still a long way to go.

102
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,950
Go to find a girl and live a normal life.

103
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,460
You can disagree.

104
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,790
But you have no right

105
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:13,260
to judge
whether our relationship is normal or not.

106
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,660
I just like him.

107
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,100
I don't care if he's a boy or girl.

108
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:21,600
You dare to talk to me like that?

109
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,110
I like Shu Yi.

110
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,580
It's not a game.

111
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,310
I've wanted to stay with him forever

112
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,150
since we got together.

113
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,490
He can leave me.

114
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:40,860
But I won't give up.

115
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:50,000
Shu Yi is going to take over my company.

116
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,270
Have you considered

117
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,500
how he's going to face his relatives
who are also the shareholders

118
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,140
if he's with you?

119
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,210
How can he manage them?

120
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,180
You know how shallow

121
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,650
your "forever" means now?

122
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,020
Young man.

123
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,790
I

124
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,520
started from scratch

125
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,990
and got everything.

126
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,330
I've seen everything.

127
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,000
Look.

128
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,640
This is my collection.

129
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,540
You wouldn't understand

130
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,640
its meaning or price.

131
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,550
Simply put.

132
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,590
You and Shu Yi are

133
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,420
from different worlds.

134
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,690
How can I

135
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,760
get your approval?

136
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,270
Five years.

137
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:06,570
I'll give you five years.

138
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,080
In these five years,

139
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,510
don't contact Shu Yi

140
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,710
or anyone close to him.

141
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:15,950
Get a career and win my approval.

142
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,920
Then I'll stay out of your business.

143
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,460
If Shu Yi has a girlfriend

144
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,690
in these five years,

145
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,430
you have to give him up unconditionally.

146
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,100
And

147
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,630
Shu Yi can't know

148
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,040
about the deal.

149
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,300
Can you do it?

150
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,740
Uncle.

151
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,250
You're just trying to trap me.

152
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,750
Approval is subjective.

153
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,820
You just have to keep saying no,

154
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,620
and I'll never get it.

155
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,160
You aren't qualified to bargain with me.

156
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,600
I know.

157
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,070
So I have to accept it.

158
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,170
Because I know

159
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,140
Shu Yi looks up to you.

160
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:13,170
Without your approval,

161
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,110
he won't be happy.

162
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,520
Excuse me.

163
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:41,600
This is...

164
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:44,840
how it was.

165
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,350
Shu Yi.

166
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,290
Why are you like this?

167
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,630
It's all your fault.

168
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,930
Go.

169
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:11,800
Or I'll beat you up.

170
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,770
Yeah.

171
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,040
If you don't go back, I'll beat you.

172
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,200
I mean, you.

173
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:21,340
Why would you say that?

174
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,680
I only want what's best for you.

175
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,380
Every time you said that,

176
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,180
it ended up hurting me a lot.

177
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,680
When I was ten,

178
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,150
you took me skydiving.

179
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,020
I almost fell into a ravine.

180
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:32,990
When I was 11,

181
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:35,020
you told me to go scuba diving and learn to swim.

182
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,490
Luckily, I didn't drown.

183
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,360
When I was 12,

184
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,690
you said a man had to climb a mountain.

185
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,230
I almost died up there.

186
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,960
When I was 13,

187
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,870
you said I'd get taller if I played basketball.

188
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,170
And I broke my bones.

189
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,670
Do I need to say more?

190
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,310
It's all my fault.

191
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,150
Really.

192
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,920
Shu Yi.

193
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,320
What can I do

194
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,690
to calm you down?

195
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,860
You go back.

196
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,530
I'll be calm.

197
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,030
Really?

198
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,100
Then I'm going.

199
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,370
I'm going.

200
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:29,440
I'm really going.

201
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,080
Don't try to stop me.

202
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:39,850
Did you call me?

203
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,640
I'm going.

204
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,980
I'm really going.

205
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,780
I'm really leaving.

206
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,300
You go, too.

207
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,100
I don't want to see you right now.

208
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,070
Well, Shu Yi.

209
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,070
Listen.

210
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,640
Do you think I was just hanging out with you,

211
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,940
or we would stay together forever?

212
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:39,980
Of course, we'd be together forever.

213
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,580
If that's the case,

214
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,680
why did you make that deal with my dad?

215
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:52,590
You think you can solve
all the problems by yourself?

216
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,830
Or you think I'm not serious

217
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,360
and I won't stand by you

218
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,700
to face my dad together?

219
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:04,310
You wanted us to be together forever,

220
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,510
but you didn't believe in my "forever".

221
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,510
I'm sorry. Shu Yi.

222
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,110
Get out!

223
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:54,143
(Old Town West)
(For food and drinks)

224
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:21,950
If Shu Yi doesn't talk to me anymore,

225
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,220
what should I do?

226
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,060
He might ignore you,

227
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,860
but you're still his father.

228
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,590
You two remain father and son.

229
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,530
Unlike me...

230
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:38,730
I didn't know you owned Hua Cing Technology.

231
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,710
I deceived you with the deal,

232
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,880
and separated you two.

233
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,640
In the end,

234
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,610
I made you two meet again.

235
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,720
You lied to me?

236
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:57,890
Can't I?

237
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:03,390
I was waiting for him to graduate,
get married, and give me grandchildren.

238
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,230
But after he graduated,

239
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,790
he came to me and told me

240
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,830
he liked a boy, you!

241
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,500
He threatened me and said

242
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:17,400
he'd leave me if I didn't accept it.

243
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,610
You think you can solve
all the problems by yourself?

244
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,510
Or you think I'm not serious

245
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,110
and I won't stand by you

246
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,480
to face my dad together?

247
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:27,650
No wonder.

248
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:36,490
It's not easy to be a dad.

249
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:42,160
I thought only married daughters
would leave the parents.

250
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,260
But sons are the same.

251
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:48,040
Why does he even care

252
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,770
about you, who went for blondes in the US?

253
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:53,710
Blondes?

254
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:00,850
Why do you think he didn't want you?

255
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,450
You heartless brat.

256
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:05,290
You went overseas and disappeared.

257
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:06,850
You didn't come back

258
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:09,320
or talk to him much.

259
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:13,190
He didn't hear anything from you
for almost six months.

260
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,200
Oh, my poor son.

261
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,870
After he finished
the Substitute Military Service,

262
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,540
he asked for leave to see you
before entering the company.

263
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,870
And then he saw

264
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:28,210
that you were enjoying yourself with a blonde.

265
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:30,210
He cried so much.

266
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:31,310
Wait a minute. He...

267
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,580
Did he go to the US to see me?

268
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:36,020
What was wrong with my son?

269
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,720
Why did you betray him?

270
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,260
I didn't betray him!

271
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,230
Uncle.

272
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:55,500
Do you approve now or not?

273
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,900
No!

274
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,010
I disapprove!

275
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,710
Only Shu Yi can dump you.

276
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:06,280
You can't dump him!

277
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,220
It's all your fault.

278
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,120
Your fault!

279
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:24,100
Yeah.

280
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:26,770
It's all my fault.

281
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:30,140
Uncle.

282
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,610
I'm sorry.

283
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:33,770
I won't give in again.

284
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,080
Excuse me.

285
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,280
What?

286
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:45,820
Hey, Gao Shi De!

287
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,960
Make it clear!

288
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,160
What do you mean?

289
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,390
(Why didn't you come to work overtime last night?)

290
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:55,600
(It was just me and Zhe Yu there
working on those contracts.)

291
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,430
(You ruined our date.)

292
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:59,100
(You'd better have a good explanation.)

293
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:02,300
I didn't go because I had a stomachache.

294
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,770
Send over the contracts.

295
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:05,570
(Exaggeration.)

296
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,270
(I sent them. Take a look.)

297
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,140
I was just about to check.

298
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,180
(There are a few additional provisions.)

299
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,350
(Check them out.)

300
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:14,850
I'll get back to you.

301
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:17,120
(Zhe Yu says he needs Monday off
as he didn't get enough sleep.)

302
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,020
Tell him to stop whining.

303
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,260
I'll pay you double for your overtime.

304
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,260
To compensate you for your date.

305
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:28,030
Bye.

306
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,660
(You take care of yourself.)

307
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,260
(Bye.)

308
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:18,410
(Shu Yi.)

309
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:19,850
(I need to talk to you.)

310
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:20,610
Shut up.

311
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,550
(Call an ambulance for me.)

312
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:35,930
I'll take care of it.

313
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,040
Brother.

314
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,170
What is your friend doing here?

315
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:44,670
Looking for a job?

316
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,870
Ignore him.

317
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,380
Do your thing.

318
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,410
But there's no...

319
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:50,040
Nothing to do.

320
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,620
Troublesome.

321
00:21:29,271 --> 00:21:32,941
(Diagnosis)

322
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,240
Give me the pills.

323
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,680
You're free to go.

324
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,720
I'll stay and take care of you.

325
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,190
Hello.

326
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,720
Bing Wei, listen.

327
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,720
That contract...

328
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:19,430
Give me my phone.

329
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:26,230
What are you doing, Gao Shi De?

330
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:27,570
Hey!

331
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,100
The patient has to rest.

332
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:37,740
Gao Shi De.

333
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,680
Take a break.

334
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,850
I'm going to cook something.

335
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:44,020
I don't need your help.

336
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,900
If I came back that year

337
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:59,530
and didn't meet with your dad,

338
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:01,300
but came straight to you,

339
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,540
would you go with me?

340
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,570
Would you?

341
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,480
You once said

342
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:46,610
that not everything could be undone.

343
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,520
I haven't been a doctor for years.

344
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,350
I can't give good advice.

345
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:24,020
(Right.)

346
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:29,360
I'm really curious about what you bought.

347
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:33,730
Chinese yam, lotus root and okra,

348
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:35,360
cabbage and eggs.

349
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,870
If I put them all together and make congee,

350
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,130
will it help with the stomachache?

351
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:44,040
But he

352
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,640
will kick me out when he's fine.

353
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,380
(I don't want to be here)

354
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,640
(only when he's sick.)

355
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:55,050
Display affection through the phone.

356
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,180
You're good, Gao Shi De.

357
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,760
You really

358
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,360
are cute.

359
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,560
Come by when you are free.

360
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,860
I will be nice to you.

361
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:11,100
Bye.

362
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:20,770
Can I help you?

363
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:25,610
Nothing.

364
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,780
Shu Yi.

365
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,120
Get up and eat something.

366
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,260
Take your medicine and go back to sleep.

367
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,300
Shu Yi, get up.

368
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:28,010
My page boy.

369
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:29,610
Get up.

370
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,490
My page boy.

371
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:45,790
You're going to be late. Get up.

372
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:49,160
Today's professor is Yang Yu Teng.

373
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,860
He loves failing students.

374
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,670
Whatever.

375
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:57,140
I need more sleep.

376
00:27:58,870 --> 00:27:59,810
So naughty.

377
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,480
Come on, get up.

378
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,640
I got breakfast.

379
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,380
All right.

380
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,050
Get some more sleep.

381
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,890
It's okay to be late.

382
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,540
You want to go back to that time.

383
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,570
Right?

384
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:02,670
Here.

385
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:05,740
Here you go.

386
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:08,840
Brother. Your friend is fighting our guests.

387
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:10,840
What to do?

388
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,550
Rick, call the cops.

389
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:14,350
Okay.

390
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,620
What did you just say?

391
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,860
I said the wine was really bad.

392
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,190
You don't have to drink it then.

393
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:24,420
Okay, don't drink. What do you want?

394
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,130
-Causing trouble here?
-What are you doing?

395
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:27,430
You want to cause trouble?

396
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,440
Come on!

397
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:41,910
Are you done?

398
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:45,150
Aren't you going to get lost?

399
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,450
Do you want to be beaten?

400
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:47,250
Wait and see!

401
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:58,560
Are you okay?

402
00:29:58,790 --> 00:29:59,460
Six, you go back first.

403
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:00,660
Okay.

404
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,260
There's nothing to see. Go back.

405
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:41,656
Don't run, you little thief.

406
00:30:41,656 --> 00:30:43,158
Stop running.

407
