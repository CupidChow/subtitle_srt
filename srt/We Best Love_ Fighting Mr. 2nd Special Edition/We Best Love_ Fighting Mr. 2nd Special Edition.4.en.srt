I'm sorry.

14
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,910
I didn't believe your "forever".

15
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,650
It took me ten years

16
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,990
to decide who I want to spend my life with.

17
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,430
Yet you knew it long ago.

18
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,470
I thought

19
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,780
it was the emotions and atmosphere back then

20
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,250
that made you say that.

21
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,400
I came back that year

22
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:51,930
and met your dad.

23
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,280
He said a lot of things.

24
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,210
You know, I used to think about

25
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,950
your reasons to leave me.

26
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,160
And he got your phone.

27
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:17,660
I thought

28
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,500
it was over.

29
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,680
But I hated to let everything go like that.

30
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:40,920
You know, actually...

31
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:42,550
actually, your dad...

32
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,350
He's right about everything.

33
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,460
I was in such low self-esteem.

34
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,390
I was afraid you'd leave me.

35
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,460
But I was also afraid that I'd hold you up.

36
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,930
So...

37
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:01,100
So I took your dad's offer.

38
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,370
To prove that I'm qualified to stand next to you

39
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,280
in five years.

40
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:20,190
It's good.

41
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,290
If I fail,

42
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,460
maybe...

43
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,670
you'd find someone better for you than me.

44
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,270
What's better?

45
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,680
It's my call.

46
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,110
Not yours, my dad's, or anybody else's.

I said the one you liked was a lucky guy.

55
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,300
When I was asleep, you said

56
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,110
the lucky one had always been me.

57
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,210

No?

Why are you crying?

You're a pain in the ass!

Why was it designed to be like this?

87
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,360
When we were doing this,

88
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,660
there was a bug.

89
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,200
You know what a bug is?

90
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,370
I do.

91
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:53,000
You do?

92
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,100
Yeah.

93
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,470
OK.

94
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,310
So there was this bug

95
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,310
causing problems with our data collection.

96
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,710
And it may seem

97
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,280
not that much of a difference

98
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,850
-but for data collection, even a 0.02 difference...
-Coffee's here.

99
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,350
Thank you.

100
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:10,790
No worries.

101
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:13,860
What are you talking about?

102
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,120
Bug.

103
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,690
Worms?

104
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:20,860
Huh?

105
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,730
Why are you looking at me?

106
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:22,760
I just happen to be wearing green.

107
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,600
Are they talking about downsizing?

108
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,370
Must be!

109
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,740
I mean, look at CEO and Vice President Zhou.

110
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,610
He's trying everything he can.

111
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,240
Chief Technical Officer!

112
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,680
Is it good that Hua Cing Technology
is merged just like this?

113
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,120
Could you really bear to

114
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,750
hand Alpha to others?

115
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,430
About our brand being custom-made,

116
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,600
there are some pros and cons

117
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,230
I need to discuss this with you.

118
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,330
Okay, I'll get back to you.

119
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:01,370
Zhen Xuan.

120
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,940
Good news.

121
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,280
The company's not downsizing.

122
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,610
Really?

123
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:11,550
Yeah.

124
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,180
I did an actuarial check with Vice President Zhou.

125
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,680
All the R&D is up to date,

126
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,950
which increases the overall value of the company.

127
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,960
I'll be honest with you.

128
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,660
The layoff

129
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,430
was Vice President Zhou's bluff.

130
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,900
So you're just trying to give them some pressure

131
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:33,630
and improve the progress.

132
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:36,000
And test their abilities, too.

133
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,810
But I do need to talk to some of them.

134
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,180
Even though it's all on schedule,

135
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,750
it's still far from

136
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,280
what we expect.

137
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,690
In this critical time,

138
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,850
every single person

139
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,590
-has to perform...
-Do you know Pei Shou Yi?

140
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,460
What's the relationship between you and Pei Shou Yi?

141
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,300
How do you know each other?

142
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,930
Where did you meet?

143
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,700
Did Pei Shou Yi ever tell you about me?

144
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,100
If you want to know, ask him yourself.

145
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,000
He'll tell you if he wants to.

146
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,410
Does he know about you and the prideful VP?

147
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,950
What on earth is it with you and Pei Shou Yi?

148
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:27,560
Zhen Xuan.

149
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,360
You're a senior at the company.

150
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,430
We do value your talent.

151
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:35,660
I respect you.

152
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,630
But that doesn't mean

153
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,300
you can meddle in my personal affairs.

154
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,440
Don't forget...

155
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,070
I'm still the CEO.

156
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,680
Remember to read it.

157
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,580
Mama's boy!

158
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,350
Dry yourself.

159
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:09,378
(Yu Zhen Xuan)

160
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,450
Do you have any food?

161
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,180
Put your legs down first.

162
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,120
Right.

163
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,070
X minus H, right.

164
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:34,170
Then, the square root of Y minus.

165
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:37,400
And...

166
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,210
yes.

167
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:42,140
Four...

168
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,350
minus three, right.

169
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,520
Can you do this one?

170
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,550
You can, right?

171
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,390
Let's do another one.

172
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,190
This one is similar.

173
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,890
Solve the parabolic equations.

174
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,590
To make X equal 0.

175
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,230
Then X equals 3.

176
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,100
Try to figure out Y and K.

177
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,410
Y and K.

178
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,750
Y.

179
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,380
Why am I wrong on this one?

180
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,750
Because there was the word "be",

181
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,390
so it has to a gerund ending with "ing".

182
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,290
OK.

183
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,690
Hello, headmaster.

184
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,390
Hello, headmaster.

185
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,130
Yu Zhen Xuan, you've made a lot of progress lately.

186
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,030
Keep it up.

187
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,540
Shen Wei Nian, you did
so much worse in your study lately.

188
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,200
Learn from Zhen Xuan. OK?

211
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,120
So you've known Yu Zhen Xuan

212
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,190
since he was in high school?

213
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,360
Yeah.

214
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:22,900
That's Zhou Shu Yi's.

215
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,070
What about mine?

216
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,370
No.

217
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,200
Why?

218
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:33,670
If it wasn't for you,

219
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,640
he wouldn't have found me.

220
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,310
What do you mean?

221
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,350
He followed you to me.

222
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,250
Yu Zhen Xuan followed me?

223
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,380
Yeah.

224
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,420
He thought you and Zhou Shu Yi
were having secret trades.

225
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,920
So he had watched you for a while.

226
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,430
I didn't realize

227
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,070
you are so stupid.

228
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,470
You didn't even notice
that you were being followed.

229
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,370
No wonder he looks at me like

230
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,740
I owe him something.

231
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,510
Well...

232
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,410
Is Yu Zhen Xuan

233
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:12,980
a little...?

234
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,050
Filial imprinting.

235
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,920
Paranoia. Asperger syndrome.

236
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,620
Mildly depressed and prone to autotomy.

237
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,120
Which one do you want to know first?

238
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,230
Forget it.

239
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:27,630
How do you know so much about him?

240
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,600
I watched him for a year in his senior year.

241
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,200
Oh.

242
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,910
So, you

243
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:41,580
quit that high school

244
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,310
because...

245
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,810
What would you want to drink?

246
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,050
You made up with Gao Shi De?

247
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:56,090
I don't get it.

248
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,890
He explained from where he stood.

249
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,160
And you just forgive him?

250
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:02,160
It's too easy to persuade you.

251
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,970
Don't you remember what he did to you?

252
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,610
If it weren't for me and Bing Wei,

253
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:14,840
you wouldn't make it.

254
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,680
And what about your revenge plan?

255
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,050
We haven't even helped much,

256
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,080
and you forgive him already?

257
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,550
I mean, if Shu Yi has already decided,

258
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,080
we should support him.

259
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,750
Instead of tangling,

260
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,390
it's better to be honest with each other.

261
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,360
The past is the past.

262
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,290
That's broad-minded.

263
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,460
You were also like that, right?

264
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:36,160
So you're saying I'm not broad-minded

265
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,130
and hold on to petty things?

266
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:38,830
No.

267
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,800
What I'm saying is

268
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,640
relationships are personal.

269
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,470
Don't haggle over it.

270
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,710
So now you're saying I always haggle over things?

271
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:54,410
You're almost out of wine.

272
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:55,720
I'll get you more.

273
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:00,590
Dummy.

274
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,620
Don't torture him.

275
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:06,090
He's been pursuing you since after college.

276
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,660
If you keep testing him,

277
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,260
you'll be doomed if he gives up.

278
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,730
I'm doomed if I say "yes."

279
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,100
Have you heard of the story of "donkey and carrot"?

280
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,970
As long as you hang a carrot
in front of a donkey,

281
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:20,140
it'll keep going.

282
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:21,780
So you're a donkey.

283
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,240
I'm the carrot!

284
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,780
Got it?

285
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,410
Yes.

286
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,950
A lot of people only want to conquer,

287
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:29,950
but they don't appreciate what they have.

288
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:35,560
Don't make quick judgments.

289
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:40,490
Thank you.

290
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,210
That's enough.

291
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:58,450
Would you like some?

292
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:58,980
Sure.

293
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:06,975
You're taking it away from me.

294
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,143
We can share.

295
00:22:09,712 --> 00:22:10,946
I mean your mouth.

296
00:22:11,647 --> 00:22:12,881
I'm talking to the french fries.

297
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,100
Where are you going?

298
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,070
Get the wine.

299
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,570
We've waited for you for long.

300
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:28,840
Don't you ever disappear again.

301
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,880
Do you have any idea how hard it was for him?

302
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,450
What do you mean?

303
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,520
You know, back then,

304
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,360
you were distracted
when you two were contacting online.

305
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:47,630
And then when he went to the US to look for you,

306
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:49,560
he saw you holding an American girl.

307
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:54,130
Again?

308
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:55,670
Which girl was it exactly?

309
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,970
How am I supposed to know?
You were the one holding her!

310
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,740
I didn't do anything like that!

311
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,740
No matter how many were there...

312
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,140
I didn't!

313
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,650
Okay, well, leave it.

314
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,650
Don't ever break his heart.

315
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,150
When Shu Yi came back from the US,

316
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:14,450
he was devastated.

317
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:16,660
He was in bad shape and went to bars all day.

318
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:31,927
One more.

319
00:23:31,927 --> 00:23:32,970
Same?

320
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:46,650
No wonder I've never received any letters.

321
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,340
It's OK. He's drunk.

322
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:06,195
What are you looking at?

323
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:07,863
Are you an idiot?

324
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:08,680
Sir.

325
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,090
Sir, are you alright?

326
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:21,090
Shall I call you a cab?

327
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,190
What's wrong with you lately?

328
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,800
Nothing.

329
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:06,770
It doesn't seem like it.

330
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,140
You've been acting strange
ever since you came back from the US.

331
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,740
I said everything's fine.

332
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,365
You've got a lot to learn these days.

333
00:25:16,365 --> 00:25:17,866
It's a critical period.

334
00:25:17,866 --> 00:25:19,568
I've done my part well.

335
00:25:19,568 --> 00:25:20,680
No, you haven't.

336
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,339
What's this about, huh?

337
00:25:24,339 --> 00:25:27,042
What are you going to do? Keep wasting yourself?

338
00:25:27,042 --> 00:25:28,277
Nothing happened.

339
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:29,160
I don't think so.

340
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,930
Don't beat around the bush.

341
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:37,286
Is it something you can't tell me?

342
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:38,654
I said everything's fine!

343
00:25:38,654 --> 00:25:39,755
It's not.

344
00:25:39,755 --> 00:25:41,670
-No!
-You're being strange.

345
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,727
You know nothing!

346
00:25:45,727 --> 00:25:47,062
I know everything.

347
00:25:47,062 --> 00:25:47,896
You better do!

348
00:25:47,896 --> 00:25:50,410
Don't give me a pep talk only at a time like this!

349
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:55,837
You'll always be a child to me.

350
00:25:55,837 --> 00:25:56,672
You know nothing!

351
00:25:56,672 --> 00:25:57,940
I know everything.

352
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:58,974
Master.

353
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,720
Who the heck is he?

354
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,520
It doesn't matter.

355
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,860
Move immediately!

356
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,590
Alright.

357
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,060
But I'm gonna live alone.

358
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:06,590
No way.

359
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:07,760
Absolutely not.

360
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,100
Whatever,

361
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,800
I'm gonna live alone!

362
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,000
His phone was confiscated.

363
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,540
And he had to change the number.

364
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,770
His phone was confiscated?

365
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,080
He lied to me!

366
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:26,680
Huh?

367
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:27,910
It's nothing.

368
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,420
And then?

369
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,720
And then...

370
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,920
there was an equity dispute inside Cheng Yi Group.

371
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,590
Shu Yi's relatives were at each other's throats.

372
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,100
To stabilize it,

373
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,430
he didn't say anything about you

374
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,330
just to help his dad.

375
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:50,600
Even though it looked like he was over you,

376
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,610
you had always been in his heart.

377
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,710
That's why he insists on living alone.

378
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:01,210
He really loves you.

379
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:05,290
One time when Zhe Yu and I went to the bar
to pick him up,

380
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:08,020
he was crying there alone with a broken phone.

381
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:08,960
Welcome.

382
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,820
Gentlemen.

383
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:10,860
He cried for you.

384
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:11,830
We're looking for...

385
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:13,660
Him.

386
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,360
He's drunk.

387
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:14,960
Shu Yi.

388
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:16,830
Shu Yi.

389
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:18,670
Don't be like this.

390
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:21,840
-Let's go home.
-Sorry.

391
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,700
He's drunk.

392
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,310
Sir, his...

393
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,110
His cell phone.

394
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,520
I can assure you.

395
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,720
You can find no one else in the world

396
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,690
who loves you as much as he does.

397
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,040
You want some?

398
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,150
Gao Shi De.

399
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:10,380
Do you remember this place?

400
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:16,760
Of course I do.

401
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,460
There was this idiot...

402
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:19,930
That's enough.

403
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,770
Why don't you ask me

404
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:35,110
why I stopped contacting you?

405
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,610
And that American girl
that I don't even know about.

406
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:47,820
You knew my dad was tricking you

407
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,820
and you were stupid enough to agree.

408
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,620
You'd rather be mistaken than explain to me.

409
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:55,130
You have become so stupid for me.

410
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,760
How can I suspect you?

411
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:00,970
Idiot.

412
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,870
Who's the idiot?

413
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,000
You are.

414
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:09,580
Who was here doing that?

415
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,010
Hey!

416
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:11,850
I'm leaving.

417
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,580
OK, go.

418
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:16,480
My name is Zhou Shu Yi!

419
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,750
I'm a fool.

420
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:22,060
-I...
-Okay!

421
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:23,890
No more...

422
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:26,460
-I like you, Gao Shi De.
-That's enough.

423
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,030
A lot!

424
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:30,960
My favorite.

425
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,700
I wonder

426
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,530
who was drunk and came to my house

427
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,400
with some late-night snacks.

428
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,640
"I'm not drunk."

429
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,940
You're gonna bring this up, huh?

430
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:40,340
What are you doing?

431
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,540
You're gonna bring this up, huh?

432
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,180
"I'm not drunk."

433
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,550
"Hi, auntie."

434
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:47,480
"I'm Zhou Shu Yi."

435
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,120
"Hello."

436
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:51,350
"I'm Zhou Shu Yi."

437
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:56,220
Bro, I'm leaving.

438
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:58,460
Bye.

439
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:25,150
What are you doing here?

440
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:26,850
For you.

441
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:32,130
Don't mess with Shi De.

442
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,830
Mama's boy told on me?

443
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:37,900
No.

444
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:39,900
Just in case.

445
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,470
And

446
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,070
don't come here tomorrow.

447
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:46,140
You're not welcomed here.

448
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:49,180
Why?

449
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,420
I would have left

450
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,750
because I didn't want to see you again.

451
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:00,550
You

452
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:02,920
make me feel so...

453
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:09,230
annoyed.

454
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,140
This is my friend's psychological clinic.

455
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:21,270
Just go and find...

456
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,180
I'm not sick!

457
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,140
You're not sick?

458
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,510
All these years, you've been looking for me.

459
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,620
When you found me, you keep coming to me

460
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,580
just like before.

461
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:33,850
Are you going to

462
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,560
find ways to soften me?

463
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,960
It was fine when you were young.

464
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,330
If this goes on,

465
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,900
you're getting close to being crazy.

466
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,740
I'm not crazy!

467
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,070
Then don't let me see you again.

468
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:42,620
It's time for a meal.

469
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:47,160
I just read your report.

470
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,660
There are mistakes on page 3 and 5.

471
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:49,700
Take a look.

472
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:57,770
Have lunch first. We'll do it later.

473
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:58,870
OK. Thank you.

474
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:13,420
Does my handsomeness daze you?

475
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,250
Yeah.

476
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,820
I'm just kidding.

477
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:17,690
I'm serious.

478
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:20,690
What are you doing?

479
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,860
Dealing with emails from the manufacturers.

480
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,370
Why are you smiling?

481
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:31,670
Nothing.

482
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,770
I remember when I asked you to write to me
once a week.

483
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:36,310
That was stupid.

484
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,610
Thank god that you didn't.

485
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,110
I did, OK?

486
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,320
I didn't get any!

487
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,820
Check this out.

488
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:50,560
["All Emails" empty]
It's empty.

489
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:53,590
But I've got them all here.

490
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,160
-Come check them out.
-No way.

491
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:58,300
They were all sent.

492
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,270
[Email sent]

493
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,130
[Email sent]
You were right!

494
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,670
-Your dad!
-My dad!

495
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,310
What did you write?

496
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,672
(Shu Yi, how have you been?)

497
00:34:17,672 --> 00:34:20,842
(This is the 67th letter from me.)

498
00:34:20,842 --> 00:34:25,060
This is the 67th letter from me.

499
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,830
You wrote a lot indeed.

500
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,080
Shu Yi.

501
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,320
You know what?

502
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:01,890
You're really brave.

503
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,230
What did you say?

504
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,770
If you hadn't told me you loved me
on the pedestrian bridge,

505
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,610
I would have given up long go.

506
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,365
So many things happened

507
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,033
after I went to the US.

508
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:20,810
I thought

509
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:25,690
I was the one who had been fighting for our love.

510
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:29,460
But I neglected your feelings.

511
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,660
Later, I realized

512
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:40,200
that you had been waiting for me here

513
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:44,800
every day.

514
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,280
Not until now did I know

515
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,680
the one waiting is the one that suffers.

516
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,860
Thank you.

517
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:13,000
My courage comes from you.

518
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,370
You let me know

519
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,270
I'm right to love you.

520
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,980
Why do you like me?

521
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:29,450
Actually, I hated you a lot

522
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:31,720
when we met in childhood.

523
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:36,160
You were always in my way.

524
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:40,460
I kept wondering
why you were always around every day.

525
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,420
I was born and raised in a rich family.

526
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,730
I got whatever I wanted.

527
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:50,425
But love, which I needed the most,

528
00:36:50,425 --> 00:36:52,310
was always beyond my reach.

529
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:58,540
And you.

530
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,906
I'm so self-willed, proud, and annoying.

531
00:37:04,906 --> 00:37:06,820
You just let me be and never complain.

532
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:14,130
Your love proves my love.

533
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,300
Thank you.

534
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,834
Are you crying?

535
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:34,202
I'm not.

536
00:37:34,202 --> 00:37:34,969
No?

537
00:37:34,969 --> 00:37:35,920
No!

538
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:37,120
Let me see.

539
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,350
I'm not.

540
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,120
Let me see.

541
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:40,750
Don't mess around, please.

Can you access the system?

No.

Shan Zhi, can you?

547
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,010
No.

548
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:42,620
It blocks me out all the time.

Can you access it?

Chief Technical Officer!

552
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:56,160
There was an unusual intrusion
into the server yesterday.

553
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:59,100
Someone hacked into the company computer
and stole Alpha.

554
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:02,640
I've called the police and asked them to process.

555
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,000
We'd find the IP soon.

To avoid any potential trouble,

557
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:10,540
please don't divulge any information.

558
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,380
We'll send each of you
a confidentiality agreement.

559
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,310
Please sign it.

560
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,320
Hey!

561
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,780
Yes. I am.

562
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:22,120
Got it?

563
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,290
Someone set a back door

564
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:02,660
on purpose when programming Alpha.

565
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,100
So you're saying

566
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,500
the thief is in our...

567
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,770
This isn't the last time.

568
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:09,300
Five years ago, I gave in.

569
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,200
This time,

570
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,510
I'll face you with Shu Yi.

Mr. Yu hasn't come here in days.

572
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:16,380
It would be nice to have extra help here.

573
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,680
It's none of your business.
