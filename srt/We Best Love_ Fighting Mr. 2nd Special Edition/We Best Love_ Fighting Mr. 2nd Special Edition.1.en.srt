Right!

The CEO just parachuted
from the United States last week

to handle the merger and acquisition
on behalf of the chairman.

Not even one!

When we signed the acquisition contract,

34
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,480
we made a deal with Cheng Yi Group

35
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,880
that no one would be fired
to protect the employees' rights.

For what?

55
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:18,890
For making you wait for so long.

Call me Vice President Zhou, please!

I'm here on behalf of Cheng Yi Group

00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,080
to handle the M&A of Hua Cing Technology.

65
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,280
Please hand over the information we requested

66
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,290

67
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:54,960
I have my reasons.

You and I...

69
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,460
What?

70
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,370
Don't say anything about old time's sake.

71
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,200
It's all about business.

72
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:11,270
And

73
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:12,810
tell your HR

74
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,440
to collect the employee evaluations
for the last three years.

75
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,010
I'll see who needs to be fired.

76
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,860
It's written in the contract

77
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,530
that you will protect employees' rights.

78
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:34,860
But there are conditions.

79
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,330
Personnel changes can be made properly

80
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,230
for the development of the company.

81
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:05,730
What's the matter?

82
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,200
What are you looking at?

83
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,540
Don't take your anger on Gao Shi De

84
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,670
out on someone else.

85
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:16,940
I didn't.

86
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,080
Do you know him?

87
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,040
Who?

88
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:30,420
You can't do that!

89
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,060
Half of you.

90
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,630
I'll fire half of you.

91
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,530
And you're on the top of the list.

92
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,970
Bing Wei.

93
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:49,800
Get the car ready.

94
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,710
OK.

95
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,410
I didn't expect Gao Shi De to be the CEO
of Hua Cing Technology.

96
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,640
Are you okay

97
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,140
seeing this bastard again?

98
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,350
I should ask you the same question.

99
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,020
I'm okay.

100
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,850
I was rejected by him a long time ago.

101
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,350
I'm not like someone

102
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,120
who got him

103
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,360
but was disqualified later.

104
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,090
I'm fine!

105
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,130
I couldn't be better.

106
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,030
Really?

107
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:47,460
If so, you wouldn't tell
in front of everyone

108
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,960
that you would fire half of them.

109
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:51,800
Those senior guys at the Head Office

110
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,870
are waiting to see how you'll handle the case.

111
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,470
Don't get emotional

112
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,640
or the shareholders won't approve of you.

113
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,870
Then you won't be able to
take your father's position.

114
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,740
I know what I'm doing.

115
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,450
It better be.

116
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,470
He said

117
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,470
he wanted to fire the employees because of you, right?

118
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,370
I won't let it happen.

119
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,810
You two have a grudge.

120
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,710
You have a grudge!

121
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,850
It's personal.

122
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,590
But it's affecting our company.

123
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,020
Your mother sent you back here,

124
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,590
but it doesn't mean you can do whatever you want.

125
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,000
Mama's boy.

126
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,570
Yu Zhen Xuan.

127
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,780
I don't care what you think of me.

128
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,540
But what I do know

129
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,550
is that I developed Project Alpha

130
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,520
and I'm also in charge of the acquisition.

131
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,550
Unfortunately,

132
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,350
this company

133
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,750
belongs to my family.

134
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,460
Oh.

135
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,130
Well, then stop him from downsizing.

136
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,960
I didn't know you care about
the welfare of your employees so much.

137
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,700
I didn't know

138
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,910
that you know me so well.

139
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,320
Thank you.

140
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:56,620
It'd be good if someone understands
that cocky Vice President.

141
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,760
Anyway, he'll fire you first.

142
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,570
Shu Yi.

143
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,910
What are you doing here?

144
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,910
Give me ten minutes!

145
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:27,660
Let's talk.

146
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,490
I've got nothing to say to you except business.

147
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:31,630
Get out!

148
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,130
So angry?

149
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:41,770
Did you skip the meal again?

150
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,000
It's none of your business.

151
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,310
What are you doing?

152
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:50,810
What are you doing in the kitchen?

153
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,120
What now?

154
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,490
Don't touch the fridge!

155
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:04,530
What do you want from me?

156
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:05,790
What now?

157
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,790
Why don't you say anrthing?

158
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,200
Answer me!

159
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,000
Fried rice,

160
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,800
OK?

161
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,840
We'll talk when you feel better after the meal.

162
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,950
A few chilies.

163
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,620
No, you have a stomach problem.

164
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,120
Just a few.

165
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,360
I said no.

166
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,560
Come on!

167
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,560
Alright, be good.

168
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,860
Why don't you go sit down and wait?

169
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:20,900
No carrots.

170
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,770
Carrots are good for your eyes.

171
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:24,910
I don't like it.

172
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,540
Come on, don't be picky.

173
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,040
No chilies, no carrots.

174
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,820
Oops.

175
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:41,620
I'm not gonna eat it.

176
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,560
Don't act like that.

177
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,060
You need to finish whatever I cook.

178
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,430
Then...

179
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,170
I'll cook for you after you

180
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,600
come back from the US.

181
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,670
Will that be edible?

182
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,610
You have to eat it.

183
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,440
What will you cook then?

184
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:06,150
Fried rice without carrots.

185
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:09,120
With all these in it?

186
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,250
Zhou Shu Yi, you gotta be kidding me.

187
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:13,750
Dinner's ready.

188
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,790
Have some soup first, it's good for your stomach.

189
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,430
Don't take my girlfriend's job.

190
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,330
Girlfriend?

191
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,470
I started dating Li Jia Jing

192
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:29,470
not long after you left.

193
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,510
The girl Yu Xin introduced to me.

194
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,810
Are you kidding?

195
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,180
Kidding?

196
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,050
Girls are surely better.

197
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,320
They're soft and comfy.

198
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,130
Even the kisses are like...

199
00:13:59,230 --> 00:13:59,800
That's enough!

200
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,800
You can be mad at me.

201
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,370
But you don't have to do it this way.

202
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:06,570
I know I owe you.

203
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:07,810
I made you wait for five years.

204
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,210
Five years?

205
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,350
What makes you think
that I waited for you?

206
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:15,480
Things are going really well with her.

207
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:18,150
I'm gonna introduce her to my dad.

208
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,090
Zhou Shu Yi.

209
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:20,390
Who do you think you are?

210
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,820
I ain't no bitch.

211
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,330
I won't waste five years on a bastard!

212
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,870
It seems like you and your girlfriend

213
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,600
aren't close.

214
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,770
You forgot her last name is He, not Li.

215
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,380
I'm done with you.

216
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,020
Then I'll go after you again.

217
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,220
I'm not giving up,

218
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:53,550
no matter how angry you are at me.

219
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:55,890
Angry?

220
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:57,420
I'm not.

221
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,930
There's only hatred.

222
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:04,900
Get out!

223
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:06,600
Or I'll call the police

224
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:08,070
and sue you for trespassing.

225
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,320
(I'm to blame.)

226
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,690
(Not the food.)

227
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,490
(At least have some.)

228
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,760
(Take care of yourself, so you can hate me.)

229
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,930
(I'll see you at work tomorrow.)

230
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,770
I've received the files from HR
and the Accounting Department.

231
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,670
What about R&D?

232
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,500
I've turned in all the data of the developed ones.

233
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,110
I want all the data,

234
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,640
including the ones under development.

235
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:38,510
(Alpha)
Where's your common sense?

236
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:42,180
I'm not turning it in until it's done.

237
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,420
That's how I do things.

238
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,320
I want up-to-date progress reports.

239
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,490
That's how I do things.

240
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:50,690
Cocky.

241
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,690
Yu Zhen Xuan.

242
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:53,660
As the Chief Technical Officer,

243
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,830
it's your responsibility.

244
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,470
Send it to me tomorrow.

245
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:08,540
You have to do it our way.

246
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:09,340
Clear?

247
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,650
Bing Wei, go on.

248
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:18,290
According to the information we get,
it looks like...

249
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,690
What do you dislike

250
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:21,560
about the company?

251
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:22,960
No.

252
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,160
You may leave.

253
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,530
Thank you.

254
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,830
Bing Wei.

255
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,800
Get me some water.

256
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,310
It's warm.

257
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,510
Bing Wei...

258
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:06,930
Shu Yi.

259
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,840
The chairman wants to see
Project Alpha's progress.

260
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,570
You should explain to the staff

261
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,270
why you would fire them...

262
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,540
Enough.

263
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,210
We're outsiders to them.

264
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,950
Do you have any problems with that?

265
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:23,880
Mind your shoelaces.

266
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,720
None of your business.

267
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:29,760
Oh, my!

268
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,590
Oh my God, the CEO is now an assistant!

269
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,760
Only boys do that for their girlfriends.

270
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,630
Yeah.

271
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,200
There.

272
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,300
Shu Yi.

273
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,580
He wasn't there when Shu Yi needed him.

274
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,140
What the hell does he want?

275
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,610
Do you think he'll do bad things to Shu Yi?

276
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,250
I don't think so.

277
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,790
I can help you with the shoelaces, too.

278
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:01,660
Good.

279
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,290
There aren't shoelaces of the shoes I'm wearing today.

280
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:06,060
Well, wear the shoes with shoelaces then.

281
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,090
I'll do it for you tomorrow.

282
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:08,830
I just wanted to...

283
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,070
Are you trying to embarrass me
in front of the employees?

284
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,740
I told you I'd go after you again.

285
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,570
I'm trying.

286
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:29,650
What can I do to get you back to me?

287
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,650
Just tell me. Whatever it is.

288
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,940
Want me back?

289
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,450
All right.

290
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:07,490
Let's do it.

291
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:22,170
You said whatever it takes.

292
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,570
Then let's do it.

293
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:35,850
Dare not?

294
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,430
OK.

295
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,050
As long as you can understand

296
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,880
that I'm serious,

297
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,290
I can do anything for you.

298
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,250
(Next Episode)
(Don't expect you could make it a real thing)

299
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,110
(and go back to the old days.)

300
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,320
(I'm gonna dump him
just when he thinks we are back together again.)

301
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,150
(I want him to know how it feels to be betrayed.)

302
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,920
I find you at last.

303
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,120
(You didn't contact him)

304
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,490
(not because you dumped him,)

305
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:51,990
(but that you couldn't find him.)

306
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:54,730
