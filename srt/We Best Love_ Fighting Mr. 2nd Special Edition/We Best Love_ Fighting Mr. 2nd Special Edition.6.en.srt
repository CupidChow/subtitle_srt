00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,280

00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,310
the real culprit had been found.

16
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:24,450
Why don't you leave?

17
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:25,810
I'm not leaving.

18
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:27,120
I'm gonna stay here.

Are you leaving or not?

22
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,260
No!

23
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,260
Seriously?

24
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,100

OK.

28
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,180
Thank you.

29
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,260
What?

30
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,460
No.

31

Hey!

32
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,160
Let go!

33
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,030
Really?

34
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:22,470
OK.

35
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,170
Okay, I get it.

36
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:25,610
Yes.

37
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,080
Thanks a lot, Bing Wei.

38
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,780
Okay, that's it.

39
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,420
OK. Bye-bye.

40
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,250
So?

41
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,320
Yu Zhen Xuan...

42
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,290
Shou Yi carried him away.

43
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:40,760
Good.

44
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,460
The two of them need to talk.

45
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,390
Pei Shou Yi's got a problem.

46
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,300
He has an affective disorder.

47
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,300
How can they talk?

48
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,030
No idea.

49
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,700
They both have problems.

50
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,300
But it's not like anyone else can help.

51
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,710
Let's

52
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,810
just do what we need to do now.

53
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,050
What the hell is this?

54
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,550
Rest.

55
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,390
Do you seriously mean this?

56
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:16,720
Yeah.

57
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,060
Can't I?

58
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:20,200
Get up.

59
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:21,730
No.

60
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,000
I've been working late.

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,400
I lack sleep.

62
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,900
And I have to spend the night with someone.

63
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,270
I'm exhausted.

64
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,710
Go sleep in the room!

65
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,150
I fainted.

66
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,480
Little kid.

67
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,700
I'm done.

68
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:32,670
Come here.

69
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,340
Sit down.

70
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,120
Give me your left hand.

71
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,400
I told you in high school

72
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,410
that even if you died right in front of me,

73
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,970
I wouldn't feel anything.

74
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,980
This isn't about you.

75
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:22,580
It's me.

76
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,390
I have an affective disorder.

77
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,460
I don't react to anything

78
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,200
emotional.

79
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:41,070
I can't connect with others emotionally.

80
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,510
Any kind of emotion or feeling

81
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,540
is just a name

82
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,380
for me.

83
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,050
I'll never feel it.

84
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,820
You're lying.

85
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,050
I've seen you smile.

86
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:59,450
You and that mama's boy...

87
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,160
You smiled when you were talking to Gao Shi De.

88
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,070
I can react according to their

89
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,570
behaviors and words.

90
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,170
So my smile

91
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,640
doesn't mean I'm happy.

92
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:19,510
My anger

93
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,910
doesn't mean I'm angry.

94
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,880
It's just

95
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,180
my social skill.

96
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,180
I don't get it.

97
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,320
You spent 12 years looking for me.

98
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,460
From your point of view,

99
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,230
maybe it's 12 years of longing,

100
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,930
feelings,

101
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,000
giving,

102
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:47,500
pain,

103
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,500
and anxiety.

104
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,710
Normal people

105
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,780
would feel surprised,

106
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,310
moved,

107
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,220
and even respond to you.

108
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:03,920
For me, it's

109
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,790
just 12 years.

110
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,830
I totally can't understand

111
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,760
what it's like looking for someone

112
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,860
for 12 years.

113
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,170
Your feelings on me

114
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,870
will be a waste.

115
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,470
You'll never get any reply.

116
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,180
No.

117
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,950
You can spend another 12 years,

118
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,820
but it won't change anything.

119
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,920
That's not gonna happen!

120
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,120
I...

121
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,920
My heart is empty.

122
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:19,790
There's nothing in it.

123
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,470
And nothing can get in.

124
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,570
So I can assume

125
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:35,540
that you're yelling at me only to get rid of me.

126
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,780
But you picked me up from the police station.

127
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,390
That means you're worried about me.

128
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,490
Shi De asked for my help.

129
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,240

00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,500
Please forgive me.

174
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,800
I was

175
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,240
too careless with my body.

176
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,640
I didn't even know I was pregnant.

177
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,880
When I got off the plane,
I went straight to the hospital.

178
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,180
Everything was a mess.

179
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,280
Then the baby came early

180
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,650
and I couldn't take care of the company.

181
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,980
Shi De was there for me

182
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,750
so you were neglected because of this.

183
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,090
I'm so sorry.

184
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:06,450
Auntie.

185
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,690
Don't say that.

186
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:14,030
You and your son's safety and well-being
are the most important.

187
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,800
But I don't think you forgive me for real.

188
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,070
You still have a problem with it.

189
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,300
No.

190
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,100
You do.

191
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,600
Yes, you do.

192
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:26,440
Or else, why do you keep calling me auntie?

193
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,580
You should call me mom.

194
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,280
Mom?

195
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,310
Yeah.

196
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:33,850
Yeah.

197
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,220
I'd like you to meet Brandon.

198
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,250
Just give me a second.

199
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,220
Just give me a second. I'll get him.

200
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:37,850
Brandon!

201
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,920
Brandon.

202
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,190
We need you.

203
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,490
Who's Brandon?

204
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:45,630
My stepfather.

205
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,860
Get ready to meet your parents-in-law online.

206
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,270
Oh.

207
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:56,870
What?

208
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:01,640
Isn't that great?

209
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,750
Why didn't you tell me in the first place?

210
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,880
So many things happened after you went to the US.

211
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,250
If I had told you,

212
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,650
you wouldn't be mad at me, would you?

213
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:12,450
Of course not.

214
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,690
And then the next question is,

215
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,530
"Why didn't you come to me when things were done?"

216
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,160
Sure!

217
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:22,960
You were there for five years.

218
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,430
Anyone would...

219
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,440
Because of the deal you made with my dad?

220
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,410
I know how much you value your father.

221
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,940
Just like I do to my mother.

222
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:40,110
I don't want you guys fighting over this.

223
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,020
You'll be sad.

224
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,290
Now I know

225
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,720
my dad's stupid.

226
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,490
You can't be picky.

227
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,930
Your dad brought you

228
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:01,100
your favorite breakfast the next day

229
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,770
when we were...in the office.

230
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,610
I don't know that.

231
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:08,110
You don't?

232
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:13,510
You were too tired.

233
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,780
You slept all the way

234
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,620
and didn't wake up even
when I brought you to your room.

235
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,190
Sorry.

236
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:20,890
My bad.

237
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:22,060
I'll work on that.

238
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:22,720
I won't wear you out.

239
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,820
Shut up!

240
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:28,130
Yummy!

241
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,160
Who made that?

242
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,340
This weekend,

243
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,100
invite your dad over for dinner.

244
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,500
I'll cook.

245
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,370
As you wish.

246
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,140
But you do the dishes.

247
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,650
Like you ever did once.

248
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:46,980
All right.

249
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,220
We'll do this together next time.

250
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:50,450
Do what?

251
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:51,750
Take a shower?

252
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,250
Do the dishes!

253
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,230
You don't want to take a shower with me?

254
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:07,370
All right.

255
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,600
I won't ask you to do the dishes.

256
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,610
But you must eat carrots.

257
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:12,710
You can't be picky.

258
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:15,710
Never.

259
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,310
Take a bite.

260
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:19,910
Please.

261
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:41,740
Dad.

262
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:45,310
I bought your favorite soy milk
and deep-fried dough sticks.

263
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,580
It's been a long time
since we last had a meal together.

264
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,750
I thought

265
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,750
they were your favorite.

266
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:57,550
Actually,

267
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,450
I knew you love them since I was a kid.

268
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,220
So

269
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,560
I was just trying to make you happy

270
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,660
by pretending that I liked them.

271
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:11,300
No.

272
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:14,540
Deep-fried dough sticks

273
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,670
were the food I had with your mom
on our first date.

274
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,480
Back then,

275
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,710
I came here and worked on my own.

276
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:31,090
I was penniless.

277
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,790
I didn't know anybody.

278
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,420
Your mom stayed with me anyway.

279
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,230
But I couldn't take her anywhere.

280
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,200
Despite the hardship,

281
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,470
she was always there for me.

282
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,210
Always.

283
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,680
She always watched over me gently.

284
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:07,650
Very gently.

285
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,130
Dad.

286
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,300
You still love mom until today.

287
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,900
She must feel happy to have you.

288
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,640
And what about you?

289
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,220
Are you happy now?

290
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:48,360
I'm not a good father.

291
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,630
But I hope

292
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,370
my son

293
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,800
can be happy.

294
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,250
Are you free this weekend?

295
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,520
Shi De

296
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,730
wants to cook for you.

297
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,070
Can he make sushi?

298
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,710
I don't know

299
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:35,380
but I can ask him to try.

300
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,580
What else do you want to eat?

301
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,120
Anything will do.

302
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:44,720
But still,

303
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,560
I want something nice.

304
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,290
I'll tell him.

305
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,130
He's quite a good cook.

306
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,270
You know what to order, don't you?

307
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:13,450
Come on.

308
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,120
This is yours.

309
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,090
It's my favorite, too.

310
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,120
OK?

311
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:20,820

By the way, I'm taking the day off tomorrow.

358
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:41,360
Boss, we're leaving.

359
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,130
Boss. Bye-bye.

360

Why do you take the day off?

361
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:44,330
Then I'll take a break the day after that.

362
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:45,830
No, I said it first.

363
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,010

364

Don't be mad.

365
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,980
I'm here to return your things.

366
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,650
I was wondering

367
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:43,790
whether I could stay by your side

368
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:46,060
without getting any response from you

369
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,000
and you don't have to

370
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,000
like me

371
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,840
but then I figured it out.

372
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:02,510
I shouldn't have caused you so much trouble.

373
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:05,680
You're right.

374
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,520
It's time for me to grow up.

375
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,920
The things in this box

376
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:16,360
have been with me for 12 years.

377
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:21,090
They are very precious to me.

378
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,370
Well, they are yours, actually.

379
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,210
Though you probably don't even remember.

380
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,380
That jacket

381
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,180
you put on me when we first met.

382
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,320
And the bandage you gave me

383
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,590
when I got hurt.

384
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,600
The towel you gave me

385
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,640
and the slippers

386
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,570
in the infirmary.

387
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:10,180
And the toothbrush

388
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:14,210
and toothpaste

389
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:15,150
you prepared for me

390
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,320
the next morning.

391
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,320
The bowls of my favorite instant noodles

392
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:27,190
you left for me in the closet.

393
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:42,940
(Get lost when you wake up)
The stickers you left me.

394
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:45,810
You taught me my homework.

395
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:47,650
All those answers.

396
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,890
And the letter you wrote me

397
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:54,550
before you left.

398
00:24:55,511 --> 00:24:57,220
(Hey, kid. I'm leaving so there is
no reason for you to be with me here anymore. )

399
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,430
And the cup you forgot to take with you.

400
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,190
Pei Shou Yi.

401
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:16,010
You know, the minute I found that you left suddenly,

402
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,480
I started looking for you.

403
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:25,190
I look at these things every day.

404
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,090
I thought,

405
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,430
maybe,

406
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:35,660
you would

407
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,070
let me stay with you

408
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,570
if I become more mature.

409
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,220
But you don't have to worry.

410
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,000
Here's your stuff.

411
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,640
It's time that I let myself go.

412
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:27,180
If there's anything you want to keep,

413
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,280
please keep it.

414
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:34,220
You can throw them away if you want.

415
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:41,260
Anyway, Pei Shou Yi,

416
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:44,230
although you probably

417
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:47,670
regret so much

418
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,940
that you got yourself involved in my business,

419
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,010
I still want to thank you.

420
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:02,380
You're the first person who asked me

421
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,250
whether I was painful.

422
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,930
My world becomes better

423
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,530
than I expected

424
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,240
because of you.

425
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:34,050
How come every time I see you I talk so much?

426
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:48,400
Pei Shou Yi.

427
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:52,230
One last thing.

428
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:00,470
Bless you.

429
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,750
I hope you will find the one

430
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:11,690
whom you want to be there for you.

431
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:14,520
I wish you happiness.

433
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,210
Shouldn't you be

434
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,790
dealing with these things yourself?

435
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:05,570
Test.

436
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,170
Test.

437
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,670
Hello, Mr. Distinguished Alumni.

438
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:13,040
What's it like to come back and give a speech
at your alma mater?

439
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,240
Fantastic!

440
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,280
I won this time.

441
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,210
I come to deliver a speech earlier than you.

442
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:25,020
Get ready to throw in the towel.

We have graduated for long,

446
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,060
you're still thinking about those silly things.

447
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:36,560
Does it matter who's number one?

448
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,630
I've lost

449
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,970
my whole life to you

450
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,640

It's nice to be back.

455
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:53,250
Let's take a tour around.

456
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:55,420
Where are you going?

457
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,120
Don't ask.

458
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:10,560

How do you know?

559
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,670
Because last week he left the ring at my house

560
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:07,630
and I found it.

561
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:09,570
I put it back in his car.

562
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:11,070
And

563
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:12,770
with his personality,

564
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,970
he can't wait for more than a weak.

565
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:16,510
And you want to make a bet with me?

566
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,950
Will you say yes?

567
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,410
Why not?

568
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,580
Anyway,

569
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:25,850
