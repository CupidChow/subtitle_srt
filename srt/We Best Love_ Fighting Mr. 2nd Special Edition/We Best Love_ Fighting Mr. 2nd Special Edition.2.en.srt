You said whatever it takes.

Then let's do it.

16
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:29,350
Dare not?

00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,030
OK.

As long as you can understand

19
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,790
I'm serious,

00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,820
I can do anything for you.

Stop it! Maniac!

Shu Yi.

24
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,000
How did it go in the office with Gao Shi De?

25
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,160
Yeah, how did it go?

26
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,500
Why not just leave it

28

I'm afraid if you keep doing this,

29
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,710
the whole company's gonna know about your old...

30
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:36,510
affair.

31
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:37,810
I didn't have an affair with him!

32
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,810
I thought you had already decided to move on.

33
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,050
Why are you guys being so coy now?

34
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,350
Do you still have feelings for him?

35
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,520
No!

36
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,850
Are you an expert of love?

37
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,360
Don't act as if you know me well.

38
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,420
So annoying!

39
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:50,830
You, too.

40
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,260
Mind your own business.

41
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,540
Told you.

42
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,870
Don't worry about anyone else.

43
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,710
You consider him as your friend,

44
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,840
but he might not appreciate it.

45
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,510
If you are so kind,

46
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,520
do some charity work.

47
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,590
I...

48
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,120
Tell you what.

49
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,290
At least, there's a receipt for your donation.

50
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:25,890
But now,

51
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,260
you are having egg on your face.

52
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,400
So embarrassed.

53
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:29,800
You get nothing from it.

54
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,970
I'm not asking for anything.

55
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,740
At work,

56
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,970
I am the Legal Specialist of the company,

57
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,470
and in private,

58
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:37,940
we are Shu Yi's friends, right?

59
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,540
Even so, you don't need to care too much.

60
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:42,140
Nosy.

61
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,810
Come on.

62
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,610
Don't say that.

63
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,720
Mind your own business.

64
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,780
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,390
I shouldn't have vented it out on you guys.

66
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,260
It's alright.

67
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:06,070
I'm glad you feel better now.

68
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,100
It's not alright.

69
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,110
You need to buy us ten meals

70
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,140
in Michelin three-star restaurants.

71
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,920
What are we going to do now?

72
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,190
System security comes first.

73
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,530
That's right.

74
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,030
But the overprotective measures

75
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,370
have caused the system to close.

76
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,470
That's the problem.

77
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,530
What could possibly go wrong?

78
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,170
We talked about this last time, okay?

79
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,470
And we did...

80
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,140
Hey.

81
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:43,810
What...

82
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:44,870
I'll be right back.

83
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,010
Chief Technical Officer, look at him...

84
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,380
Chief Technical Officer.

85
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,210
Tech...

86
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:58,920
Good morning.

87
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:00,420
There you are.

88
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,490
Are we invisible?

89
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:07,900
Good morning, guys.

90
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,530
Have you had breakfast?

91
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:12,500
No.

92
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,470
Can you get it for me?

93
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:15,900
Seriously?

94
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,040
Of course.

95
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,910
Or what?

96
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,140
OK.

97
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,480
What would you like to have?

98
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,380
You know my taste.

99
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,710
Just decide for me.

100
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:25,980
Sure.

101
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:27,680
Congee.

102
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,550
It's good for the stomach.

103
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,490
By the way, Bing Wei.

104
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,750
He can't drink coffee with an empty stomach.

105
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,420
Keep an eye on him.

106
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:35,420
And he asked if he wanted coffee.

107
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,660
What the hell? That's crazy.

108
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,710
What are you looking at?

109
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,450
Don't you need to work?

110
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:06,950
Bing Wei.

111
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:08,520
I want to drink coffee.

112
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,420
Go get me some.

113
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:18,630
Shu Yi.

114
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:20,840
I need to talk to you.

115
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,060
Did you see that?

116
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:44,730
What did I just see?

117
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:45,760
Are we doomed?

118
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,090
I'll tell you what,

119
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,600
the CEO is already on Cheng Yi Group's side.

120
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,260
You know?

121
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,660
That means they will surely fire people.

122
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,970
What am I supposed to tell my wife?

123
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,170
Would I be the first one to go?

124
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,330
How to apply for the unemployment compensation?

125
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,140
Can we apply?

126
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,300
You wish! It isn't that easy.

127
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,000
Do you think it's that easy to get it?

128
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:01,610
What are you looking at?

129
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:02,740
Don't you have work?

130
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,510
We are not here for the scenery, are we?

131
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,180
Say something.

132
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:42,780
Are you out of your mind?

133
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,790
So just after one night,

134
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:49,020
you've decided to get back together with him?

135
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,160
And...

136
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:53,560
Go ahead.

137
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,630
What the hell are you thinking?

138
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,640
You're just my special assistant.

139
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,240
It's not your business.

140
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,240
I know it's not my business.

141
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,710
But you are being too emotional at work.

142
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,840
If anything goes wrong during the transition,

143
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,680
Bing Wei and I will have to
take the responsibility.

144
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,010
We'll be fired.

145
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,180
I'll take the responsibility.

146
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,180
How?

147
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,650
You might get fired, too!

148
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:20,690
Tell me.

149
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,420
What do you want?

150
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,760
Fine.

151
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,070
If you refuse to tell me,

152
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:34,700
I'll go to Gao Shi De and
tell him you want him back.

153
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,770
I'll dump him
when he thinks we are together again.

154
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,840
I want him to know I've never forgiven him.

155
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,110
It's just a lie.

156
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:45,410
I want him to feel the pain of being betrayed.

157
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,220
Do you have to go that far?

158
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,860
I know it since I was a kid

159
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,960
that people around me

160
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,530
are trying to impress me...

161
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,370
because of my dad.

162
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:06,970
Not me.

163
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,870
Not me or Bing Wei.

164
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,270
I'm not talking about you guys.

165
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:14,210
For me,

166
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,640
I can pretend to be someone's buddy.

167
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,380
But it's hard to trust someone

168
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,150
with all my heart.

169
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:26,750
Gao Shi De was the first person.

170
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,500
But he betrayed my trust.

171
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,730
If it were you,

172
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,230
would you forgive him?

173
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:39,830
Forgive?

174
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,240
I'll twist his head.

175
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,010
Both heads,

176
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:53,680
you know what I mean.

177
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:28,920
Come in.

178
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,720
Where's my breakfast?

179
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,950
Did you buy it?

180
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,060
It's on the table.

181
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,060
Thank you.

182
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:01,850
Is it good?

183
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,090
It's delicious.

184
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,920
I'm glad to hear that.

185
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,700
Shu Yi.

186
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,030
What's the matter?

187
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,280
Nothing.

188
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:44,920
Rick, I'll leave it to you.

189
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:46,750
OK.

190
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:27,830
Gao Shi De.

191
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,130
So are you gonna roll with it?

192
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,470
You eat with him every day,

193
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,810
work with him

194
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,340
and even send him home.

195
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,580
He never refused.

196
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,580
He's just trying to get you indulged into it

197
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,220
and break your heart when you are the happiest.

198
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,750
It'd be a clean kill.

199
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,530
Thank you.

200
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:03,700
Don't expect to get back to the old days

201
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,500
by playing along with him.

202
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,710
You ignored him for five years.

203
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,010
The only solution is to let him know

204
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,850
you didn't contact him

205
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,120
not because you dumped him

206
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,420
but because you couldn't.

207
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:33,230
I have to keep the promise.

208
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,770
What kind of promise is that?

209
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:41,400
You're not gonna make it.

210
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,870
Who says so?

211
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:53,750
Of course, I can.

212
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:07,800
What?

213
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,130
You're so sick.

214
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:12,770
You said he hated you.

215
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:28,320
What is "hate"?

216
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,620
It means he still loves me.

217
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,450
Even if it's just a little bit.

218
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:21,870
Gao Shi De.

219
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,180
Any good midnight snack around here?

220
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,430
Pei Shou Yi!

221
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:25,700
I've finally found you.

222
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:27,730
You said

223
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:29,140
I could have a chance if I didn't give up.

224
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,940
I've been looking for you all these years.

225
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,380
Long time no see.

226
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,410
How are you?

227
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:40,310
Let me go!

228
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,820
Answer my question first.

229
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,380
How are you?

230
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:47,650
Very good.

231
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,490
Let go!

232
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,120
No!

233
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:52,490
You're not a child anymore.

234
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:53,890
-Don't act like a kid.
-No.

235
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,670
Stop avoiding me.

236
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:03,000
I've looked for you for 12 years.

237
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,410
I didn't ask you to do that.

238
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,580
I chose to leave you 12 years ago.

239
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,750
I'll still do the same

240
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,850
12 years later.

241
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:17,850
Pei Shou Yi.

242
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,690
I'm not giving up.

243
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,800
Do you hear me?

244
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,200
I'm not giving up.

245
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:45,480
You guys are really slow.

246
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,380
It's been days, and the contract isn't ready yet.

247
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:50,280
I need to see
Wei Cheng Industrial's information today.

248
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,620
Get back to the office now.

249
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,050
Today?

250
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:53,150
Yes, today.

251
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:53,890
It's the weekend!

252
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,160
So what?

253
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,060
Can't you work extra hours after work?

254
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:58,730
I can pay for your overtime.

255
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:00,960
What about my date?

256
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,130
Get Zhe Yu there, too.

257
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:04,060
I'm gonna talk to him about the meeting next week.

258
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,730
Be in the office in 30 minutes.

259
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:06,330
All right.

260
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,500
OK. Bye.

261
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,040
Gao Shi De.

262
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,650
What are you doing here?

263
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,220
Hi.

264
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,220
I've got work to do.

265
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,060
I got some midnight snacks.

266
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,400
I don't have time right now.

267
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,450
I have to go to work.

268
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,950
You're obviously drunk.

269
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,120
I'm going to work.

270
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,640
I'm leaving.

271
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:18,970
Gao Shi De.

272
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,240
What the hell are you doing?

273
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,690
Take a break.

274
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,190
I'm gonna work late.

275
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,690
Let go!

276
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:14,960
What's wrong with you?

277
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,600
Enough with the drama!

278
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,370
Gao Shi De.

279
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,540
I said stop it!

280
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,630
I'm sorry.

281
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,560
I...

282
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:55,070
I shouldn't have gone to the US.

283
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:07,810
I'm sorry.

284
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,590
Can we start all over again?

285
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:21,400
Can we start over?

286
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:33,510
What happened in the US?

287
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,920
Gao Shi De.

288
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,030
What the hell is going on?

289
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,990
Why?

290
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:27,560
Why!

291
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,330
Are you messing with me, Gao Shi De?

292
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:35,670
You're messing with me.

293
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,020
What do you mean?

294
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,690
You don't know why,

295
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:28,990
do you?

296
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:35,700
Do you know you're blessed?

297
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,200
Do you know you've always been protected?

298
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:47,710
What are you doing?

299
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:48,480
I'm going to work.

300
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,380
I thought you wanted to know.

301
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,780
No feelings anymore?

302
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,460
Enough.

303
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,970
Gao Shi De.

304
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,300
What?

305
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:52,440
Gao Shi De!

306
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:24,340
