1
00:00:15,848 --> 00:00:21,088
(Today's city is full of busy pedestrians.)

2
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:23,227
(Gangnam, Seoul)

3
00:00:23,228 --> 00:00:25,357
- Hello. - Kyoung Pyo.

4
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:27,298
- Hi, Jae Seok. - Mimi.

5
00:00:27,498 --> 00:00:29,297
(The three siblings are here first.)

6
00:00:29,298 --> 00:00:30,498
(Clapping)

7
00:00:31,728 --> 00:00:33,898
(Continuing the clapping)

8
00:00:34,098 --> 00:00:36,507
(The Blunt Siblings have good teamwork.)

9
00:00:36,508 --> 00:00:38,567
It feels nice to be in Seoul.

10
00:00:38,568 --> 00:00:39,777
- To be what? - It feels nice...

11
00:00:39,778 --> 00:00:40,978
- to be in Seoul. - Right?

12
00:00:41,278 --> 00:00:43,047
It makes you feel calm, right?

13
00:00:43,048 --> 00:00:44,448
It makes me feel very calm.

14
00:00:45,048 --> 00:00:46,977
I'm curious. Do you do your own hair?

15
00:00:46,978 --> 00:00:48,917
- No. - No, right?

16
00:00:48,918 --> 00:00:50,087
If I do, it'll be a mess.

17
00:00:50,088 --> 00:00:51,088
All frizzy.

18
00:00:51,548 --> 00:00:53,287
It's so neatly tied.

19
00:00:53,288 --> 00:00:55,187
You made your ears stand up.

20
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:56,188
How did you know?

21
00:00:57,028 --> 00:00:58,488
Look at this.

22
00:00:58,888 --> 00:01:01,327
- Mimi made her ears stand up. - Yes, it's a tape.

23
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:02,797
- You made your ears stand up? - Yes.

24
00:01:02,798 --> 00:01:04,444
(A trendy item to make your ears stand up)

25
00:01:04,468 --> 00:01:06,367
- To fix flat ears. - Like this.

26
00:01:06,368 --> 00:01:08,497
- There's such a thing? - And if you do this,

27
00:01:08,498 --> 00:01:10,108
it makes you look a bit younger.

28
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:12,137
- You can become much younger. - You're really different.

29
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:13,807
I see, Mimi,

30
00:01:13,808 --> 00:01:15,438
that you're really obsessed with youth.

31
00:01:15,808 --> 00:01:18,078
How did you know... I am really obsessed with it.

32
00:01:18,408 --> 00:01:19,547
- Each year passing makes me sad. - Mimi...

33
00:01:19,548 --> 00:01:21,417
is really chasing youth.

34
00:01:21,418 --> 00:01:22,447
You are just the age to.

35
00:01:22,448 --> 00:01:23,888
- Right. - Yes.

36
00:01:23,988 --> 00:01:25,117
You didn't even give me...

37
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:26,717
- time to put on lipstick. - CEO Song.

38
00:01:26,718 --> 00:01:28,357
- Put on your lipstick. - I was doing so,

39
00:01:28,358 --> 00:01:29,387
and then I heard you guys, so I came.

40
00:01:29,388 --> 00:01:31,287
- We weren't filming. - You weren't?

41
00:01:31,288 --> 00:01:32,848
- No. - Then why are you gathered here?

42
00:01:33,298 --> 00:01:34,298
We were waiting for you.

43
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:35,619
- You were waiting for me? - Yes.

44
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,197
Mimi...

45
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:39,367
- I made my ears stand up. - Why?

46
00:01:39,368 --> 00:01:40,537
- Like this. - It's tape.

47
00:01:40,538 --> 00:01:42,367
- Because your ears are flat? - That's right.

48
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:43,707
She's chasing youth.

49
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:46,507
This makes you look a bit younger.

50
00:01:46,508 --> 00:01:47,907
- You're chasing youth? - Yes, kind of like an elf.

51
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:50,348
Youth already passed us by.

52
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:52,648
You know what I mean, right? Oh, no.

53
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:54,578
- Oh, no! It left! - Oh, gosh.

54
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:56,247
- It already passed us by like this. - Totally.

55
00:01:56,248 --> 00:01:58,017
- It's right by Mimi now. - Like this.

56
00:01:58,018 --> 00:02:00,657
- It's right behind me. - It's really right by her.

57
00:02:00,658 --> 00:02:01,687
You have to do what you can do.

58
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:02,887
- Yes, everything I can do. - You have to.

59
00:02:02,888 --> 00:02:04,387
- Do it. - I have to do it all.

60
00:02:04,388 --> 00:02:05,627
You have to do it all so you don't regret anything.

61
00:02:05,628 --> 00:02:07,027
Right? What should I do today?

62
00:02:07,028 --> 00:02:08,427
You have to be funny today.

63
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:09,467
- Is that so? - Is that so?

64
00:02:09,468 --> 00:02:11,148
(The best anti-aging ingredient, laughter)

65
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:12,697
Kyoung Pyo looks less puffy.

66
00:02:12,698 --> 00:02:14,267
- Me? Really? - Yes.

67
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:15,637
- Compared to the last time. - That's good news.

68
00:02:15,638 --> 00:02:17,807
You look much less puffy than when we were in Busan.

69
00:02:17,808 --> 00:02:18,937
I will continue to become less puffy.

70
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:19,938
- Oh, really? - Yes.

71
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:21,977
Oh, you've set your mind on something.

72
00:02:21,978 --> 00:02:23,778
- Yes, I have. - Did you get...

73
00:02:23,908 --> 00:02:25,947
(Can we see "After Payment" Kyoung Pyo?)

74
00:02:25,948 --> 00:02:28,477
- Yes, I have. - Did you get a new role?

75
00:02:28,478 --> 00:02:30,087
No, to get a new role,

76
00:02:30,088 --> 00:02:31,717
- I need to look prepared. - I see.

77
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:33,957
- You couldn't wait anymore? - I couldn't wait anymore.

78
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:36,387
- I wasn't getting many roles. - I get how you feel.

79
00:02:36,388 --> 00:02:38,304
(Look forward to seeing a different Kyoung Pyo.)

80
00:02:38,328 --> 00:02:39,897
Where are we going today?

81
00:02:39,898 --> 00:02:41,297
Today...

82
00:02:41,298 --> 00:02:43,427
- This is our hometown. - Yes.

83
00:02:43,428 --> 00:02:45,167
- Right. - Today is Gangnam, Seoul.

84
00:02:45,168 --> 00:02:47,268
- Oh, yes. - I love it.

85
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:51,167
(Seoul)

86
00:02:51,168 --> 00:02:54,378
(Gangnam)

87
00:02:54,778 --> 00:02:57,908
(The main central area of Seoul, Gangnam)

88
00:02:58,148 --> 00:02:59,777
(Cheongdam-dong)

89
00:02:59,778 --> 00:03:01,377
(Samseong-dong)

90
00:03:01,378 --> 00:03:02,587
(Yeoksam-dong)

91
00:03:02,588 --> 00:03:03,688
(Daechi-dong)

92
00:03:03,988 --> 00:03:05,917
(And!)

93
00:03:05,918 --> 00:03:08,717
(The original hip neighborhood of Gangnam)

94
00:03:08,718 --> 00:03:13,658
(Garosu Street)

95
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:17,698
(The Sixth Sense members increase their hip gauge.)

96
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,237
(What is the fake thing...)

97
00:03:20,238 --> 00:03:22,708
(we'll encounter at today's trendy places?)

98
00:03:23,168 --> 00:03:25,037
(Today is difficult as always.)

99
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,878
(Will we be able to find the fake today?)

100
00:03:26,978 --> 00:03:29,847
I have memories at many of these places.

101
00:03:29,848 --> 00:03:31,447
This is such a trendy area.

102
00:03:31,448 --> 00:03:32,818
- Yes. - What is this?

103
00:03:33,018 --> 00:03:34,617
"Why were you in there?"

104
00:03:34,618 --> 00:03:36,317
("Why were you in there")

105
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:38,347
(They spotted today's topic on the map!)

106
00:03:38,348 --> 00:03:39,557
What is this?

107
00:03:39,558 --> 00:03:40,717
- "A secretive businessman-to-be." - Businessman-to-be.

108
00:03:40,718 --> 00:03:41,817
- "A nonsense chef." - "Chef."

109
00:03:41,818 --> 00:03:43,428
- "A god of games?" - "A god of games?"

110
00:03:43,688 --> 00:03:44,688
What could that mean?

111
00:03:44,689 --> 00:03:47,098
- Is it someone surprising? - Right.

112
00:03:47,398 --> 00:03:50,367
(Today's topic is so mysterious!)

113
00:03:50,368 --> 00:03:51,567
(1. A secretive businessman-to-be)

114
00:03:51,568 --> 00:03:53,128
(2. A nonsense chef, 3. A god of games)

115
00:03:53,668 --> 00:03:56,968
(Today's topic is people who heated up social media!)

116
00:03:57,308 --> 00:03:59,878
(Why are these people trending?)

117
00:04:00,308 --> 00:04:01,537
(There's a businessman...)

118
00:04:01,538 --> 00:04:03,208
(secretly building his business?)

119
00:04:03,848 --> 00:04:06,748
(The first person, a secretive businessman-to-be)

120
00:04:08,278 --> 00:04:11,188
(There's a chef on his 2nd life?)

(Will they be able to find the fake one today?)

126
00:04:27,138 --> 00:04:28,637
So one of them is fake, right?

127
00:04:28,638 --> 00:04:30,237
- Right. - Right, we're looking for the fake.

128
00:04:30,238 --> 00:04:31,807
- I'm just thinking of having fun. - Exactly.

129
00:04:31,808 --> 00:04:33,737
I'm just thinking of eating.

130
00:04:33,738 --> 00:04:36,047
We need to see who will be joining us today.

131
00:04:36,048 --> 00:04:37,177
Our guest.

132
00:04:37,178 --> 00:04:40,117
Anyway, we'll do a city tour of Garosu Street.

133
00:04:40,118 --> 00:04:43,047
The place we're meeting them is a trendy place.

134
00:04:43,048 --> 00:04:44,048
- I see. - Really?

135
00:04:44,048 --> 00:04:45,048
- Okay. - So we'll head over there.

136
00:04:45,049 --> 00:04:46,787
- Shall we get going? - Let's go.

137
00:04:46,788 --> 00:04:48,687
Garosu Street is...

138
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:49,987
It's not as trendy in the afternoon.

139
00:04:49,988 --> 00:04:51,527
It needs to be later in the day...

140
00:04:51,528 --> 00:04:53,757
- Right. - for the trendy places to wake up.

141
00:04:53,758 --> 00:04:56,727
These days, this place can beat Myeong-dong's butt.

142
00:04:56,728 --> 00:04:58,067
- Oh, really? - That's how much...

143
00:04:58,068 --> 00:04:59,637
- "Beat Myeong-dong's butt." - It can beat Myeong-dong's butt.

144
00:04:59,638 --> 00:05:00,837
What are you saying?

145
00:05:00,838 --> 00:05:01,838
"Beat Myeong-dong's butt."

146
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:03,338
I'm just blabbering.

147
00:05:04,368 --> 00:05:05,637
(Everywhere you go here...)

148
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:08,508
(is hip and trendy.)

149
00:05:08,738 --> 00:05:12,717
(Full of people enjoying the hip atmosphere)

150
00:05:12,718 --> 00:05:13,718
(At night, )

151
00:05:13,948 --> 00:05:17,018

(Should we start our tour of Gangnam's trendy places?)

154
00:05:26,898 --> 00:05:28,627
Do you not come here often, Kyoung Pyo?

155
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,797
I came here a lot when I was young.

156
00:05:30,798 --> 00:05:33,867
When there were clubs and lounges here.

157
00:05:33,868 --> 00:05:35,637
I was a dancing machine.

158
00:05:35,638 --> 00:05:36,667
Do they let you in...

159
00:05:36,668 --> 00:05:38,308
- if you dance like that? - Of course.

160
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,337
(The moves of a dancing machine)

161
00:05:40,338 --> 00:05:42,007
When you walk around here,

162
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,647
you often run into people you know.

163
00:05:43,648 --> 00:05:45,447
- You used to live here. - That's right.

164
00:05:45,448 --> 00:05:46,647
Right up front.

165
00:05:46,648 --> 00:05:49,217
When I went to Seoul Institute of the Arts,

166
00:05:49,218 --> 00:05:50,317
my friend lived here.

167
00:05:50,318 --> 00:05:51,787
- Oh, really? - So...

168
00:05:51,788 --> 00:05:53,687
when I came to meet her,

169
00:05:53,688 --> 00:05:55,557
I would transfer buses twice...

170
00:05:55,558 --> 00:05:57,827
and wear the best clothes that I had.

171
00:05:57,828 --> 00:05:59,497
- I see. - Back then...

172
00:05:59,498 --> 00:06:01,097
This is the street of fashion.

173
00:06:01,098 --> 00:06:03,798
I would wear the triangle question mark pants.

174
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:05,127
I would get here...

175
00:06:05,128 --> 00:06:06,168
She means Guess.

176
00:06:06,698 --> 00:06:09,608
I would get here, and she would come out in slippers.

177
00:06:09,738 --> 00:06:11,507
- That's right. - Because she lived right here.

178
00:06:11,508 --> 00:06:12,907
Because it was by her house.

179
00:06:12,908 --> 00:06:14,777
Back then,

180
00:06:14,778 --> 00:06:16,607
- that seemed cool. - That's hip.

181
00:06:16,608 --> 00:06:17,677
Living in a trendy place.

182
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:20,038
After that, I wore slippers all the way here from my house.

183
00:06:20,878 --> 00:06:23,088
You must've been quite embarrassed on the way here.

184
00:06:23,218 --> 00:06:25,547
- That's uncomfortable. - To pretend as if I lived here.

185
00:06:25,548 --> 00:06:27,388
- Oh, gosh. - It was uncomfortable.

186
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:29,528
- A celebrity... - I needed to endure that much.

187
00:06:30,788 --> 00:06:34,898
(She wanted to keep up with her cool friend, )

188
00:06:35,698 --> 00:06:37,497
(and she only ended up getting embarrassed.)

189
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:40,068
(Eyes slightly open)

190
00:06:40,468 --> 00:06:42,868
(CEO Song had days like that too.)

191
00:06:43,008 --> 00:06:45,737
I have memories in many of these places.

192
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,407
- Oh, gosh. - It's such a trendy place.

193
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:49,847
There is Jennie.

194
00:06:49,848 --> 00:06:50,877
Foreigners come and take pictures here.

195
00:06:50,878 --> 00:06:52,747
- Right, this is a trendy spot. - Oh, right.

196
00:06:52,748 --> 00:06:56,518
(Jennie's pictures on the wall)

197
00:06:56,648 --> 00:06:59,418
(It's famous among tourists as the Jennie photo spot.)

198
00:06:59,558 --> 00:07:02,258
(They even line up for pictures!)

199
00:07:05,688 --> 00:07:08,097
Jennie is in many hip places.

200
00:07:08,098 --> 00:07:09,127
- Yes. - Her pictures.

201
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:10,798
I want to become Jennie too.

202
00:07:11,528 --> 00:07:12,797
- I... - You're Mimi.

203
00:07:12,798 --> 00:07:15,237
- You're already Mimi. - I want to become Jennie too!

204
00:07:15,238 --> 00:07:17,207
- You're already Mimi. - I want to be successful too.

205
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:18,938
Your names kind of rhyme.

206
00:07:19,068 --> 00:07:20,237
- Yes. Jennie, Mimi. - Jennie, Mimi.

207
00:07:20,238 --> 00:07:21,807
- Sounds like sisters. - We're just really different.

208
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,247
- Yes. - Right.

209
00:07:23,248 --> 00:07:25,877
A while ago, I bought hand cream here.

210
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:28,047
And you know that bell they give you for waiting?

211
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:29,447
- Yes. - I brought that in my pocket.

212
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:32,018
Oh, gosh. You haven't gotten rid of your stealing habit yet.

213
00:07:33,088 --> 00:07:34,918
- Old habits are scary. - Seriously.

214
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:38,827
It was time for them to close, so in the morning...

215
00:07:38,828 --> 00:07:39,857
You took it back to them?

216
00:07:39,858 --> 00:07:42,867
I put it in a shopping bag and hung it on the door.

217
00:07:42,868 --> 00:07:44,327
Sometimes, people take...

218
00:07:44,328 --> 00:07:45,968
- the books from karaoke places. - Right?

219
00:07:46,438 --> 00:07:48,438
- The song book? - The karaoke song book.

220
00:07:48,838 --> 00:07:49,938
People get drunk...

221
00:07:50,338 --> 00:07:52,978
and think the book is their bag.

222
00:07:53,778 --> 00:07:56,177
(Gangnam made even normal people nervous.)

223
00:07:56,178 --> 00:07:58,208
This is really close to my house...

224
00:07:58,508 --> 00:07:59,678
Wait. Is this the place?

225
00:08:00,818 --> 00:08:02,617
- What is this? - Where are we going?

226
00:08:02,618 --> 00:08:03,687
(While laughing, they arrived at their destination.)

227
00:08:03,688 --> 00:08:05,248
- What is this place? - What is this?

228
00:08:05,648 --> 00:08:07,958
- "Fishing Club?" - This must be that place.

229
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:10,257
- I wanted to come here. - This place is so pretty.

230
00:08:10,258 --> 00:08:11,457
Bungeoppang.

231
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,727
- Is this a new place? - I saw it on social media.

232
00:08:13,728 --> 00:08:14,827
- Really? - Yes.

233
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:15,857
This is amazing.

234
00:08:15,858 --> 00:08:18,498
Oh, my. What is this? This lobster is so pretty.

235
00:08:18,828 --> 00:08:20,898
- Oh, my. - This is so pretty!

236
00:08:21,998 --> 00:08:23,768
(This place...)

237
00:08:24,238 --> 00:08:27,008
(is a new trendy place in Garosu Street.)

238
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:30,708
(It's full of items that you'll want to buy!)

239
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:32,208
This is so pretty.

240
00:08:32,348 --> 00:08:34,578
- It's a pen. - This is so cool.

241
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:37,247
- Key chains. - This is so...

242
00:08:37,248 --> 00:08:38,688
Oh, for when you grab something hot.

243
00:08:39,188 --> 00:08:40,257
That's so cute.

244
00:08:40,258 --> 00:08:42,387
This place is so fun.

245
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:44,127
(A pop-up store with a fishing theme)

246
00:08:44,128 --> 00:08:45,387
(It's like a fishing store.)

247
00:08:45,388 --> 00:08:46,427
(There's a lobster we can't eat.)

248
00:08:46,428 --> 00:08:51,298
(A must-visit trendy place in Garosu Street!)

249
00:08:51,668 --> 00:08:52,967
There are lots of pretty clothes.

250
00:08:52,968 --> 00:08:54,968
- This hoodie is so pretty too. - Seriously.

251
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:56,907
This is so pretty.

252
00:08:56,908 --> 00:08:58,468
(Should I buy it or not?)

253
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,937
(This green hat caught his eye.)

254
00:09:00,938 --> 00:09:02,637
- There are many products. - This brand...

255
00:09:02,638 --> 00:09:03,747
This is pretty.

256
00:09:03,748 --> 00:09:05,708
But... It's expensive.

257
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,748
- The hat... - The hat...

258
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:09,518
- A hat for 46 dollars. - Oh, my.

259
00:09:09,918 --> 00:09:11,948
This... Oh, gosh.

260
00:09:12,048 --> 00:09:14,258
- This is... - It makes me take a step back.

261
00:09:14,918 --> 00:09:17,187
- Let's not look too closely. - Right.

262
00:09:17,188 --> 00:09:18,257
Hesitating.

263
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:20,898
- This hat is 46 dollars. - Right.

264
00:09:20,998 --> 00:09:24,367
Isn't this a bungeoppang store?

265
00:09:24,368 --> 00:09:26,198
This smell...

266
00:09:26,868 --> 00:09:28,714
There are a bunch of things you like, Jae Seok.

267
00:09:28,738 --> 00:09:30,707
- Look at that hot dog. - Do you want to eat one?

268
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,708
(A trendy snack corner in the trendy place)

269
00:09:33,038 --> 00:09:34,978
(Their signature item)

270
00:09:37,478 --> 00:09:39,647
- The smell is insane. - We need to eat that hot dog.

271
00:09:39,648 --> 00:09:41,618
(American-style hot dogs...)

272
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,117
(and a popular winter snack, bungeoppang)

273
00:09:43,118 --> 00:09:44,218
It's bungeoppang.

274
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:45,587
Bungeoppang.

275
00:09:45,588 --> 00:09:47,818
(Custard cream, pizza)

276
00:09:49,788 --> 00:09:53,357
(Crispy on the outside, moist on the inside)

277
00:09:53,358 --> 00:09:56,097
- This smell is insane. - Hey, let's eat.

278
00:09:56,098 --> 00:09:57,567
- Seriously. - We need to eat that hot dog.

279
00:09:57,568 --> 00:09:59,768
I'd like a Texas chili dog.

280
00:10:00,138 --> 00:10:02,068
Already? When did you decide?

281
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:04,868
- When did you decide? - Is your blood pressure okay?

282
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:06,977
- I took my medicine. - You're okay?

283
00:10:06,978 --> 00:10:08,777
Oh, you're taking medicine. Okay.

284
00:10:08,778 --> 00:10:10,478
I'll have one hot chocolate.

285
00:10:11,908 --> 00:10:13,977
- Jae Seok. - What?

286
00:10:13,978 --> 00:10:15,977
- You're so stubborn. - Hey.

287
00:10:15,978 --> 00:10:18,047
- We need to taste the bungeoppang. - We need to taste the bungeoppang.

288
00:10:18,048 --> 00:10:20,557
We need to at least have a taste. Red bean or custard cream?

289
00:10:20,558 --> 00:10:21,587
- Custard cream. - Red bean for me.

290
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:24,127
- If so, give us one of each. - Right.

291
00:10:24,128 --> 00:10:25,157
Let's share them.

292
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:26,457
But if we're going to eat some,

293
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,327
(I want the pizza one.)

294
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:29,827
I want the pizza one...

295
00:10:29,828 --> 00:10:30,897
(Oh, Childish Yu...)

296
00:10:30,898 --> 00:10:32,837
- One each, please. - Are you saying you like it...

297
00:10:32,838 --> 00:10:34,067
- or not? - I'm saying I like it.

298
00:10:34,068 --> 00:10:37,538
- And what? Texas? - Texas chili dog.

299
00:10:37,668 --> 00:10:39,837
So we'll get the Texas chili dog.

300
00:10:39,838 --> 00:10:41,507
- CEO Song is buying for us. - No, wait.

301
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:43,807
(Chop, chop)

302
00:10:43,808 --> 00:10:44,948
(Chop)

303
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:48,548
(Who is this mysterious man quietly chopping away?)

304
00:10:49,478 --> 00:10:51,347
(He'll be revealed soon.)

305
00:10:51,348 --> 00:10:53,717
- Let's go downstairs for now. - Let's go downstairs.

306
00:10:53,718 --> 00:10:54,987
This is so...

307
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,928
- I always say this, but... - Yes?

308
00:10:57,058 --> 00:10:58,058
(Oh, my!)

309
00:10:58,059 --> 00:10:59,728
We're below the ship now.

310
00:11:00,258 --> 00:11:01,374
Look at this in front of us.

311
00:11:01,398 --> 00:11:03,627
Oh, it's captain!

312
00:11:03,628 --> 00:11:04,897
It's the ocean!

313
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:06,237
It's the ocean!

314
00:11:06,238 --> 00:11:08,137
(There's another space downstairs!)

315
00:11:08,138 --> 00:11:10,268
(Ocean scenery)

316
00:11:10,938 --> 00:11:14,738
(Decorated like the deck of a ship to let people rest in the city)

317
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,278
(Waves)

318
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:22,118
(It feels as if you're looking out from the deck!)

319
00:11:22,618 --> 00:11:27,257
(It's a famous photo spot among Generation Z.)

320
00:11:27,258 --> 00:11:28,387
Honestly,

321
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:30,287
you could take a few pictures here...

322
00:11:30,288 --> 00:11:32,488
- Act like you're abroad. - and act like you're abroad.

323
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:34,458
- Let's take some. - Nice.

324
00:11:35,058 --> 00:11:36,227
Take a few pictures. Let's see if it really looks...

325
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:38,028
- like the ocean. - I think it really does.

326
00:11:38,528 --> 00:11:40,268
The LED is quite...

327
00:11:40,498 --> 00:11:42,497
- Does it look like the ocean? - It looks like the ocean.

328
00:11:42,498 --> 00:11:44,568
- It looks quite real. - Let me see.

329
00:11:45,068 --> 00:11:46,278
- Look here, Jae Seok. - Look.

330
00:11:46,438 --> 00:11:47,438
Let's see.

331
00:11:47,439 --> 00:11:48,507
(What do you think?)

332
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:50,608
(Oh, my!)

333
00:11:51,448 --> 00:11:52,807
Oh, my.

334
00:11:52,808 --> 00:11:54,348
It looks fake.

335
00:11:55,018 --> 00:11:56,018
(Laughing)

336
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:57,717
- Green screen. - Oh, my.

337
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:00,587
(Her camera skills aren't good enough for the ocean.)

338
00:12:00,588 --> 00:12:02,087
- Take a picture instead. - A picture.

339
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:03,968
I took pictures of you, and I was so surprised.

340
00:12:04,188 --> 00:12:05,288
Why?

341
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,257
- Why? - Take a picture instead.

342
00:12:07,258 --> 00:12:08,597
This wasn't taken in a photo studio, right?

343
00:12:08,598 --> 00:12:09,598
Hey.

344
00:12:10,068 --> 00:12:12,828
- Hey. I told you it looked fake. - Photo studio.

345
00:12:13,298 --> 00:12:14,397
- That's so funny. - Photo studio.

346
00:12:14,398 --> 00:12:16,637
- It looks fake. - Oh, does it?

347
00:12:16,638 --> 00:12:19,207
- You're right. It does look fake. - It looks fake like a photo studio.

348
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:20,237
Photo studio.

349
00:12:20,238 --> 00:12:22,807
Posting, "It's so nice to see the ocean" with this picture...

350
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:24,047
Photo studio.

351
00:12:24,048 --> 00:12:25,808
- But it's a pretty picture. - Photo studio.

352
00:12:26,048 --> 00:12:27,417
It does look cool.

353
00:12:27,418 --> 00:12:28,617
- That's ours. - Thank you.

354
00:12:28,618 --> 00:12:30,118
- Thank you. - Thank you.

355
00:12:30,948 --> 00:12:32,187
- That's ours. - Thank you.

356
00:12:32,188 --> 00:12:33,318
(Staring)

357
00:12:33,788 --> 00:12:35,017
(Glancing)

358
00:12:35,018 --> 00:12:36,587
- Here are your drinks first. - He's really handsome.

359
00:12:36,588 --> 00:12:37,887
Yes, thank you.

360
00:12:37,888 --> 00:12:40,897
- I'll serve your drinks first. - Yes, thank you.

361
00:12:40,898 --> 00:12:42,297
- Thank you. - What happened to your hand?

362
00:12:42,298 --> 00:12:43,867
Working here is tough, isn't it?

363
00:12:43,868 --> 00:12:45,397
- I got hurt while cooking. - While cooking?

364
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:46,537
Are you a real cook?

365
00:12:46,538 --> 00:12:48,137
- Yes, I'm good at cooking. - I see.

366
00:12:48,138 --> 00:12:51,008
- "I'm good at cooking?" - Who ordered the iced Americano?

367
00:12:51,108 --> 00:12:53,477
(Who ordered the iced Americano?)

368
00:12:53,478 --> 00:12:54,878
Who ordered the iced Americano...

369
00:12:55,378 --> 00:12:56,448
Oh, the way he speaks...

370
00:12:58,148 --> 00:12:59,307
(Who ordered the iced Americano...)

371
00:12:59,308 --> 00:13:01,378
Oh, the way he speaks... Wait. Who are you?

372
00:13:02,118 --> 00:13:03,118
(Laughing)

373
00:13:03,119 --> 00:13:05,187
- He laughed! - Oh, you scared me!

374
00:13:05,188 --> 00:13:06,887
- Hello, Jae Seok. - Hello!

375
00:13:06,888 --> 00:13:09,487
(Oh, my. Who is this?)

376
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:11,287
- Hello, Jae Seok. - Hello!

377
00:13:11,288 --> 00:13:12,288
Hello.

378
00:13:12,289 --> 00:13:14,227
- I thought something was... - I knew by your voice.

379
00:13:14,228 --> 00:13:15,697
- Really? Oh, gosh. - Kyoung Pyo did...

380
00:13:15,698 --> 00:13:19,797
(From cross-dressing...)

381
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:22,068
(to a tough man, he has a wide acting spectrum.)

382
00:13:22,498 --> 00:13:23,607
(He even debuted as a director with his short film.)

383
00:13:23,608 --> 00:13:25,384
("7,000 Dollar Director Debut, Jang Dong Yoon")

384
00:13:25,408 --> 00:13:27,907
(Talented actor, Jang Dong Yoon)

385
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:29,377
I knew by your voice.

386
00:13:29,378 --> 00:13:31,007
- Really? Oh, gosh. - Kyoung Pyo did...

387
00:13:31,008 --> 00:13:33,117
- I tried to change it. - Oh, gosh.

388
00:13:33,118 --> 00:13:34,417
You were talking like...

389
00:13:34,418 --> 00:13:35,418
(Mumbling)

390
00:13:35,419 --> 00:13:36,587
Exactly.

391
00:13:36,588 --> 00:13:38,447
- I thought it was strange. - His voice was...

392
00:13:38,448 --> 00:13:39,647
We wouldn't have known...

393
00:13:39,648 --> 00:13:40,887
- even if he used his normal voice. - Exactly.

394
00:13:40,888 --> 00:13:43,287
You could have gotten away with it more naturally if you did that.

395
00:13:43,288 --> 00:13:45,687
- Then we would've believed you. - I shouldn't have changed my voice.

396
00:13:45,688 --> 00:13:47,657
It was brief,

397
00:13:47,658 --> 00:13:49,827
- but did you feel that silence? - Yes.

398
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:51,297
- "He's so handsome." - Oh, really?

399
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:53,067
- Right. - Right?

400
00:13:53,068 --> 00:13:55,767
He was wearing a mask, but we could feel it.

401
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:56,837
You can't hide it.

402
00:13:56,838 --> 00:13:59,337
- Oh, thank you. - Your voice really is so...

403
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,407
How are you so white?

404
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:03,347
I am pretty fair.

405
00:14:03,348 --> 00:14:04,348
- I'm jealous. - "How are you so white?"

406
00:14:04,349 --> 00:14:06,778
- I don't know what to say. - Being fair is attractive.

407
00:14:07,048 --> 00:14:08,417
It makes you look classy.

408
00:14:08,418 --> 00:14:10,318
- Oh, thank you. - Gosh.

409
00:14:10,418 --> 00:14:12,847
You must have a new film coming out.

410
00:14:12,848 --> 00:14:15,317
These days, I'm shooting a drama.

411
00:14:15,318 --> 00:14:16,357
- I see. - It's that drama.

412
00:14:16,358 --> 00:14:17,827
It's related to you.

413
00:14:17,828 --> 00:14:19,187
- What drama? - Really?

414
00:14:19,188 --> 00:14:20,558
- What drama? - Really?

415
00:14:20,598 --> 00:14:21,598
Praying Mantis.

416
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:23,328
(The enemy of insects, the praying mantis)

417
00:14:23,468 --> 00:14:25,067
Hey, what is this?

418
00:14:25,068 --> 00:14:27,368
(Offended)

419
00:14:28,038 --> 00:14:29,807
- It's not even past noon... - Right?

420
00:14:29,808 --> 00:14:32,038
The title is "The Mantis."

421
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:33,708
- I see. - Yes, that's right.

422
00:14:34,038 --> 00:14:38,748
(A crime thriller starring Ko Hyun Jung and Jang Dong Yoon)

423
00:14:38,848 --> 00:14:40,848
(Locust, it's not a drama about insects.)

424
00:14:41,218 --> 00:14:44,318
Not many people call me Locust nowadays.

425
00:14:44,518 --> 00:14:46,248
She's the only one...

426
00:14:46,558 --> 00:14:48,957
- Yes, "The Mantis." - Don't forget about Locust.

427
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:51,258
- Oh, gosh. - Locust is cute.

428
00:14:51,688 --> 00:14:55,198
- Go ahead and eat. - Thank you for the food.

429
00:14:55,398 --> 00:14:57,127
We should've ordered some more.

430
00:14:57,128 --> 00:14:58,498
- Seriously. - This looks so good.

431
00:14:58,668 --> 00:15:00,298
Oh, my.

432
00:15:01,168 --> 00:15:02,697
(Childish Yu's pizza bungeoppang)

433
00:15:02,698 --> 00:15:04,707

(Kochelin's red bean bungeoppang)

435
00:15:06,508 --> 00:15:07,977
- Should we give it a taste? - Have this hot dog.

436
00:15:07,978 --> 00:15:09,737
- Okay. - Have this hot dog. Go ahead.

437
00:15:09,738 --> 00:15:11,477
- Oh, my. - Is it good?

438
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:12,478
Let's see.

439
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:13,977
(Kochelin likes red bean bungeoppang.)

440
00:15:13,978 --> 00:15:15,417
Oh, this is good!

441
00:15:15,418 --> 00:15:16,617
- This is good. - Oh, my!

442
00:15:16,618 --> 00:15:20,087
(Dong Yoon likes chili hot dogs.)

443
00:15:20,088 --> 00:15:22,018
- This is so good too. - Oh, my.

444
00:15:22,618 --> 00:15:24,588
- It's American style. - Right?

445
00:15:24,828 --> 00:15:26,658
- Have you been to the US a lot? - No.

446
00:15:28,898 --> 00:15:30,397
Do they have bungeoppang in the US?

447
00:15:30,398 --> 00:15:31,468
Hey.

448
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:33,097
I was talking about this.

449
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,768
- It's intense. - Oh, I see.

450
00:15:35,598 --> 00:15:36,608
Okay?

451
00:15:36,638 --> 00:15:37,668
(Breathing in)

452
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:39,207
(Eating on the breath out)

453
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:40,278
Pizza.

454
00:15:40,838 --> 00:15:42,037
The pizza one is really good.

455
00:15:42,038 --> 00:15:44,478
- I want to try this one too. - The red bean one is good too.

456
00:15:44,548 --> 00:15:47,618
- Since this is a famous item. - Do you work out, Kyoung Pyo?

457
00:15:47,718 --> 00:15:49,318
- No, it's just fat. - Really?

458
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:51,288
- No, it's just fat. - Really?

459
00:15:51,748 --> 00:15:52,917
(Oh, dear...)

460
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:55,718
- But... - Saying that while eating...

461
00:15:56,058 --> 00:15:59,128
- You look very fit though. - I'm going to exercise from now on.

462
00:16:00,028 --> 00:16:02,227
- Let's go together. - Sure.

463
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:03,544
Oh, you want to work out together?

464
00:16:03,568 --> 00:16:04,697
- Oh, together? - Sure.

465
00:16:04,698 --> 00:16:05,797
(Sounds good.)

466
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:06,967
Oh, you like exercising.

467
00:16:06,968 --> 00:16:09,068
I tend to work out harder if I'm with someone.

468
00:16:10,168 --> 00:16:12,449
Kyoung Pyo agreed to work out, and soon after, he went...

469
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,938
(Taking a big bite)

470
00:16:15,178 --> 00:16:16,407
- He's just... - This is so delicious.

471
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:17,447
(He just said that he was going on a diet.)

472
00:16:17,448 --> 00:16:18,708
Kyoung Pyo is big-boned.

473
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,918
- Right. - Isn't your father a strong man?

474
00:16:21,018 --> 00:16:23,717
My father... He's a businessman.

475
00:16:23,718 --> 00:16:24,718
Oh, really?

476
00:16:25,588 --> 00:16:27,488
- Right. - A businessman.

477
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:30,228
A business magnate.

478
00:16:30,728 --> 00:16:33,257
(Business magnate Ko Kyoung Pyo)

479
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:34,698
Have you been on Sixth Sense before?

480
00:16:35,298 --> 00:16:37,067
Right at the beginning...

481
00:16:37,068 --> 00:16:38,428
- Yes. - In Season One?

482
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:41,638
- I guessed it correctly. - Really?

483
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:43,367
- Dong Yoon did. - You're really smart.

484
00:16:43,368 --> 00:16:44,368
That's right. You went...

485
00:16:44,368 --> 00:16:45,368
- to Hanyang University, right? - Yes.

486
00:16:45,368 --> 00:16:46,368
He studied economics...

487
00:16:46,369 --> 00:16:47,377
- at Hanyang University. - That's amazing.

488
00:16:47,378 --> 00:16:49,278
And he caught a mugger when he was a student.

489
00:16:49,478 --> 00:16:51,177
Oh, really? Why do you know so much?

490
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:52,907
- I do. - You caught a mugger?

491
00:16:52,908 --> 00:16:54,718
- It was on the news. - Oh, that's right.

492
00:16:55,578 --> 00:16:57,324
- Dong Yoon was on the news. - You're right.

493
00:16:57,348 --> 00:16:58,618
(Right!)

494
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:01,587
- You're right. - I remember.

495
00:17:01,588 --> 00:17:02,887
- I remember now. - I didn't know...

496
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:04,188
your reactions were so big.

497
00:17:04,688 --> 00:17:06,857
They'll get even bigger. Look forward to it.

498
00:17:06,858 --> 00:17:09,258
Oh, gosh. These kids are ambitious.

499
00:17:10,868 --> 00:17:12,697
She's making facial expressions she doesn't usually make.

500
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,668
She didn't react like that...

501
00:17:14,768 --> 00:17:16,368
when Hye Lyun and Kyeong Hwan were here.

502
00:17:17,908 --> 00:17:21,408
Since he caught a mugger, he'll be able to catch the lies.

503
00:17:21,738 --> 00:17:23,677
- I'll show you a new side of me. - That sounds good.

504
00:17:23,678 --> 00:17:25,154
- That sounds good. Shall we go? - Let's go.

505
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:26,178
- Okay. - Let's go.

506
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:27,754
(Will Dong Yoon guess correctly again today?)

507
00:17:27,778 --> 00:17:30,848
(Time to start their tour of Gangnam's trendy places!)

508
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:34,257
- Thank you. - It's nothing at all.

509
00:17:34,258 --> 00:17:36,287
- What is that? You bought it? - I saw you touching it.

510
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:37,828
Oh, gosh.

511
00:17:37,928 --> 00:17:39,287
He's normally not materialistic.

512
00:17:39,288 --> 00:17:41,828
CEO Song. Thank you for this.

513
00:17:42,098 --> 00:17:43,928
This fishing hat is pretty.

514
00:17:44,468 --> 00:17:45,867
- It's perfect for you. - Right?

515
00:17:45,868 --> 00:17:46,938
Yes, it's perfect.

516
00:17:48,038 --> 00:17:50,307
(Eun I came to buy the hat during their short break.)

517
00:17:50,308 --> 00:17:51,708
I'm going to buy this for Jae Seok.

518
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,478
He kept touching it. I want to give it to him as a gift.

519
00:17:54,878 --> 00:17:56,707
- Yes, that's big enough. Thank you. - Thank you.

520
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,068
(They may bicker, but Eun I always takes care of Jae Seok.)

521
00:18:01,818 --> 00:18:03,417
I had never seen him touch something like that...

522
00:18:03,418 --> 00:18:04,988
(Oh, my!)

523
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:07,857
- This Fishing Club hat is perfect. - It really fits your outfit today.

524
00:18:07,858 --> 00:18:08,858
It really does.

525
00:18:09,618 --> 00:18:10,728
Oh, it's perfect.

526
00:18:10,888 --> 00:18:12,008
- It's perfect. - It's cute.

527
00:18:12,788 --> 00:18:14,897
You look younger now. Let's take a picture here.

528
00:18:14,898 --> 00:18:17,218
- I didn't even adjust it. - Here, in front of the mirror.

529
00:18:17,468 --> 00:18:20,297
One, two, three. Snap.

530
00:18:20,298 --> 00:18:22,568
- Okay. - Nice.

531
00:18:22,838 --> 00:18:24,637
It's good to have Mimi here to take pictures like this.

532
00:18:24,638 --> 00:18:26,478
(The Sixth Sense members made another memory.)

533
00:18:26,678 --> 00:18:28,477
(1. A secretive businessman-to-be)

534
00:18:28,478 --> 00:18:30,807
We're going to meet a secretive businessman-to-be.

535
00:18:30,832 --> 00:18:33,512
- "A secretive businessman-to-be?" - A secretive businessman-to-be.

536
00:18:35,566 --> 00:18:36,566
The way...

537
00:18:36,936 --> 00:18:39,766
that this is slightly see-through reminds me of the Saemaul hats.

538
00:18:40,206 --> 00:18:42,935
- It suits you. Village chief. - It suits me, right?

539
00:18:42,936 --> 00:18:44,175
- Village chief. - Are you going to the field?

540
00:18:44,176 --> 00:18:46,746
It's like a village chief look.

541
00:18:47,606 --> 00:18:50,475
Seriously. Oh, gosh. I should wear slippers here next time.

542
00:18:50,476 --> 00:18:51,545
(Like people who live in Gangnam)

543
00:18:51,546 --> 00:18:53,466
- As if you live here. - Yes, as if I live here.

544
00:18:53,546 --> 00:18:55,586
Then I should come here in underwear in the summer.

545
00:18:55,786 --> 00:18:56,786
That...

546
00:18:57,116 --> 00:18:59,356
Don't you already have a few pictures in underwear?

547
00:18:59,986 --> 00:19:01,385
That's my thing.

548
00:19:01,386 --> 00:19:03,156
(That's my thing.)

549
00:19:03,656 --> 00:19:05,526
Why did you wear those shorts?

550
00:19:05,796 --> 00:19:07,526
I'm confident about my legs.

551
00:19:09,526 --> 00:19:11,665
Oh, there are many trendy places in alleys like this.

552
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:14,666
- Wait. What is even here? - I've never been to this part.

553
00:19:15,206 --> 00:19:17,835
This is the entrance to Garosu Street.

554
00:19:17,836 --> 00:19:20,005
Right. If you got that way, there's Hangang Park.

555
00:19:20,006 --> 00:19:21,045
- Right. - Right.

556
00:19:21,046 --> 00:19:22,046
What?

557
00:19:22,047 --> 00:19:23,416
- Right. - What?

558
00:19:24,346 --> 00:19:25,752
- Wait. Is it here? - I think it's here.

559
00:19:25,776 --> 00:19:26,786
Here?

560
00:19:27,486 --> 00:19:29,385
"Kim Buk Soon's Keunnambijip."

561
00:19:29,386 --> 00:19:30,615
(They arrived at the first trendy place.)

562
00:19:30,616 --> 00:19:32,715
- This must be it. - This is a famous place.

563
00:19:32,716 --> 00:19:34,076
A really famous kimchi stew place.

564
00:19:34,556 --> 00:19:36,185
Sook is a regular here.

565
00:19:36,186 --> 00:19:38,126
- Really? - Yes.

566
00:19:38,396 --> 00:19:40,526
Their kimchi stew and omelets are really good.

567
00:19:41,566 --> 00:19:43,165
(The first place is a famous kimchi stew restaurant...)

568
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,736
(that even CEO Song knows about?)

569
00:19:45,036 --> 00:19:46,766
There are many autographs too.

570
00:19:47,566 --> 00:19:49,506
Really famous celebrities...

571
00:19:49,806 --> 00:19:51,776
get take out here a lot.

572
00:19:52,276 --> 00:19:55,005
- Amazing. - There are so many autographs.

573
00:19:55,006 --> 00:19:58,646
(All of the walls are filled with autographs from famous people.)

574
00:19:58,876 --> 00:20:01,446
(When you think of kimchi stew in Sinsa-dong, )

575
00:20:01,586 --> 00:20:04,216
(this place comes to mind right away.)

576
00:20:04,656 --> 00:20:06,626
(Decades of history)

577
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:09,156
(Hundreds of customers come here every day.)

578
00:20:10,096 --> 00:20:12,525
(The most popular kimchi stew restaurant...)

579
00:20:12,526 --> 00:20:14,896
(in Korea)

580
00:20:15,826 --> 00:20:17,065
(In the middle of Gangnam, )

581
00:20:17,066 --> 00:20:18,772
(with many entertainment agencies and expensive land, )

582
00:20:18,796 --> 00:20:22,565
(this trendy kimchi stew restaurant...)

583
00:20:22,566 --> 00:20:25,036
(has kept its spot for a whole 25 years.)

584
00:20:25,576 --> 00:20:27,545
(Someone here...)

585
00:20:27,546 --> 00:20:31,276
(went viral on social media?)

586
00:20:31,546 --> 00:20:34,286
(Who is this secretive businessman-to-be?)

587
00:20:34,546 --> 00:20:36,315
- Really? - Yes.

588
00:20:36,316 --> 00:20:37,415
(Who could it be?)

589
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:38,615
The kimchi stew must be so delicious.

590
00:20:38,616 --> 00:20:39,885
(Kyoung Pyo is just happy at the thought of eating.)

591
00:20:39,886 --> 00:20:41,486
- It must be so delicious. - Hello.

592
00:20:42,356 --> 00:20:43,855
Welcome.

593
00:20:43,856 --> 00:20:44,856
- Hello. - Oh, my.

594
00:20:46,596 --> 00:20:47,626
Hello... Oh, my!

595
00:20:51,276 --> 00:20:52,276
- Hello. - Oh, my.

596
00:20:54,106 --> 00:20:55,206
Hello... Oh, my!

597
00:20:59,276 --> 00:21:00,315
Hello... Oh, my!

598
00:21:00,316 --> 00:21:03,486
(Freezing right away)

599
00:21:03,756 --> 00:21:04,816
- Wait! - Hello.

600
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,125
- Wait. - Hello.

601
00:21:07,126 --> 00:21:08,186
There...

602
00:21:08,486 --> 00:21:09,855
Please sit where you'd like.

603
00:21:09,856 --> 00:21:12,056
(Who is this person that surprised everyone?)

604
00:21:12,326 --> 00:21:14,565
- Oh, wait. - You can sit where you'd like.

605
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:15,625
Welcome.

606
00:21:15,626 --> 00:21:17,196
- Wait. - Hello. Wait.

607
00:21:17,466 --> 00:21:19,095
- That secret... - Yes.

608
00:21:19,096 --> 00:21:20,166
That secret...

609
00:21:20,636 --> 00:21:21,966
A party of five, right?

610
00:21:22,436 --> 00:21:23,506
Hello.

611
00:21:24,306 --> 00:21:26,276
- Wait, that's... - That's ZINGER.

612
00:21:27,206 --> 00:21:28,246
ZINGER...

613
00:21:28,906 --> 00:21:30,675
- ZINGER. - ZINGER.

614
00:21:30,676 --> 00:21:31,776
(Is it really ZINGER?)

615
00:21:32,216 --> 00:21:33,746
Why are you here?

616
00:21:35,246 --> 00:21:37,815
Oh my magic

617
00:21:37,816 --> 00:21:38,886
My magic

618
00:21:40,326 --> 00:21:42,225
(Secret's ZINGER is magically before them?)

619
00:21:42,226 --> 00:21:43,226
Oh, gosh.

620
00:21:44,056 --> 00:21:45,396
(You all remember, right?)

621
00:21:45,796 --> 00:21:47,796
(Popular idol group, Secret)

622
00:21:48,526 --> 00:21:50,966
(Secret, a popular idol group that dominated the 2010s)

623
00:21:51,336 --> 00:21:53,295
(Even among all of the girl groups, )

624
00:21:53,296 --> 00:21:55,776
(they gathered a big fan base with their fun moves and songs.)

625
00:21:56,366 --> 00:21:59,736
(A member of Secret, ZINGER)

626
00:22:00,106 --> 00:22:02,406
(Why is she at a kimchi stew store?)

627
00:22:02,746 --> 00:22:04,815
- It's been so long... - Seriously. It's been ten years.

628
00:22:04,816 --> 00:22:06,376
It's really been so long.

629
00:22:06,476 --> 00:22:07,715
Seriously. It's been a while.

630
00:22:07,716 --> 00:22:09,016
- Yes, I know ZINGER. - Yes.

631
00:22:09,486 --> 00:22:10,586
Why are you here, ZINGER?

632
00:22:11,086 --> 00:22:13,386
Me? I've been working hard here.

633
00:22:15,286 --> 00:22:17,255
I'm studying to open my own business.

634
00:22:17,256 --> 00:22:18,776
- To open your own business? - Really?

635
00:22:19,396 --> 00:22:20,796
I want to open another location.

636
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:22,946
I'm getting on the owner's good side.

637
00:22:24,296 --> 00:22:26,906
Oh, that's why it said... Was it "businessman-to-be?"

638
00:22:27,236 --> 00:22:28,705
- A secretive businessman-to-be. - Yes, businessman-to-be.

639
00:22:28,706 --> 00:22:30,235
- Businessman-to-be. - Businessman-to-be.

640
00:22:30,236 --> 00:22:31,605
(Secretive, Secret, Businessman-to-be, ZINGER)

641
00:22:31,606 --> 00:22:32,906
Really?

642
00:22:33,876 --> 00:22:36,676
- This is a really famous... - You're right.

643
00:22:36,776 --> 00:22:38,776
It's a really famous restaurant.

644
00:22:38,976 --> 00:22:41,416
It's so famous. You can see all of the autographs.

645
00:22:42,646 --> 00:22:45,986
(Fitting of a trendy kimchi stew place in Sinsa-dong, )

646
00:22:46,186 --> 00:22:48,585
(this restaurant is always busy.)

647
00:22:48,586 --> 00:22:51,626
(She used to be a popular idol.)

648
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:53,636
(Now, she's an entrepreneur in training.)

649
00:22:54,396 --> 00:22:57,035
(ZINGER is living a new life at this kimchi stew restaurant.)

650
00:22:57,036 --> 00:22:58,295
Enjoy.

651
00:22:58,296 --> 00:22:59,872
(ZINGER is living a new life at this kimchi stew restaurant.)

652
00:22:59,896 --> 00:23:02,035
Hello. I'm Jeong Ha Na, a part-time worker...

653
00:23:02,036 --> 00:23:03,776
at this kimchi stew restaurant.

654
00:23:04,876 --> 00:23:07,246
I was sleeping while shooting a variety show.

655
00:23:07,346 --> 00:23:09,675
I was sleeping while doing a photo shoot.

656
00:23:09,676 --> 00:23:11,246
That's how busy I was.

657
00:23:11,576 --> 00:23:15,146
After my idol activities were over, I was thinking of what to do,

658
00:23:15,286 --> 00:23:17,585
and I looked for things I liked and was good at.

659
00:23:17,586 --> 00:23:19,685
I wanted to try being a content creator.

660
00:23:19,686 --> 00:23:21,085
(She became a beauty content creator, )

661
00:23:21,086 --> 00:23:22,686
(something she enjoyed and was good at.)

662
00:23:22,926 --> 00:23:25,096
But it didn't work out.

663
00:23:25,826 --> 00:23:27,395
Because my income wasn't stable,

664
00:23:27,396 --> 00:23:29,366
I couldn't continue doing what I wanted to do.

665
00:23:30,226 --> 00:23:32,665
I was lost trying to figure out...

666
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:34,936
what I was good at and what I should do.

667
00:23:35,806 --> 00:23:37,975
Other former female idols...

668
00:23:37,976 --> 00:23:39,876
who are in the restaurant business...

669
00:23:39,976 --> 00:23:42,405
told me they felt a lot of love...

670
00:23:42,406 --> 00:23:44,646
from their fans who visited their stores.

671
00:23:45,116 --> 00:23:46,716
"I should just give it a shot."

672
00:23:46,816 --> 00:23:50,246
"Nothing is difficult." I started with that mindset.

673
00:23:51,216 --> 00:23:53,055
The reason I chose kimchi stew...

674
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:56,025
I often ate at Korean restaurants near our agency...

675
00:23:56,026 --> 00:23:58,856
before I debuted and even after I debuted.

676
00:23:58,956 --> 00:24:00,366
"What was Jeong Ha Na like then?"

677
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:02,625
"I should work hard again." I had that mindset.

678
00:24:02,626 --> 00:24:03,696
(This energizing dish...)

679
00:24:04,396 --> 00:24:07,866
(reminds her of how she felt when she first debuted with Secret.)

680
00:24:08,466 --> 00:24:12,036
(ZINGER's favorite food, kimchi stew)

681
00:24:12,436 --> 00:24:15,476
But since I was new to business,

682
00:24:15,946 --> 00:24:18,015
I thought I should first learn...

683
00:24:18,016 --> 00:24:20,946
how things worked in the hall.

684
00:24:21,016 --> 00:24:22,862
(After working there for a year, there were posts...)

685
00:24:22,886 --> 00:24:23,985
(of seeing ZINGER everywhere on the internet.)

686
00:24:23,986 --> 00:24:26,585
After I had worked here for a year...

687
00:24:26,586 --> 00:24:27,755
(She went viral for working at this trendy kimchi stew place.)

688
00:24:27,756 --> 00:24:31,296
The old-time fans come to see me after seeing my social media.

689
00:24:32,856 --> 00:24:35,025
(Thanks to them, ZINGER is enjoying her new life.)

690
00:24:35,026 --> 00:24:39,236
Then I give them a wink, buy them a soda, and stuff like that.

691
00:24:39,636 --> 00:24:42,106
Sixth Sense members, am I real?

692
00:24:42,736 --> 00:24:45,276
(Is the prospective entrepreneur, ZINGER, real?)

693
00:24:45,736 --> 00:24:47,905
- Hold on a second. - So whether or not it's true...

694
00:24:47,906 --> 00:24:49,305
We have to guess...

695
00:24:49,306 --> 00:24:50,715
- whether ZINGER is real or not. - That's right.

696
00:24:50,716 --> 00:24:51,976
Please sit here.

697
00:24:52,246 --> 00:24:53,246
Shall we sit for now?

698
00:24:53,247 --> 00:24:54,415
- Let's sit down for now. - But...

699
00:24:54,416 --> 00:24:56,045
- You can sit over there. - Shall I sit on that side?

700
00:24:56,046 --> 00:24:57,556
- I think this is fake. - Why?

701
00:24:58,386 --> 00:24:59,386
But...

702
00:25:00,286 --> 00:25:01,456
What's going on? I mean...

703
00:25:01,786 --> 00:25:02,985
- She's going to start a business? - Why would ZINGER be here...

704
00:25:02,986 --> 00:25:04,095
(She gets ready to receive their order right away.)

705
00:25:04,096 --> 00:25:05,925
How long have you been working here?

706
00:25:05,926 --> 00:25:08,565
I started working here last February or March.

707
00:25:08,566 --> 00:25:10,065
- It's been almost a year. - Then it's been a year...

708
00:25:10,066 --> 00:25:11,135
That's a long time.

709
00:25:11,136 --> 00:25:12,295
It's been quite a long time.

710
00:25:12,296 --> 00:25:13,395
Were you a regular here?

711
00:25:13,396 --> 00:25:15,135
- Did you know people here? - It wasn't me who was a regular.

712
00:25:15,136 --> 00:25:17,675
My aunt on my mother's side has a very sensitive palate.

713
00:25:17,676 --> 00:25:19,075
So I came here and tried the food.

714
00:25:19,076 --> 00:25:20,805
I fell in love with it immediately.

715
00:25:20,806 --> 00:25:22,275
On the very day, I made the offer to the owner.

716
00:25:22,276 --> 00:25:23,645
- What did you say to the owner? - On the day you tried the food?

717
00:25:23,646 --> 00:25:24,646
Yes, on the very day.

718
00:25:25,416 --> 00:25:27,896
(It mesmerized the palate of ZINGER, who likes kimchi stew...)

719
00:25:28,116 --> 00:25:30,186
(when she first tried it with its rich flavor!)

720
00:25:30,556 --> 00:25:35,156
(Over 300 servings are sold per day. It will be revealed shortly.)

721
00:25:35,286 --> 00:25:38,055
The owner contemplated at first. But after some time,

722
00:25:38,056 --> 00:25:40,565
she saw how badly I wanted this...

723
00:25:40,566 --> 00:25:42,695
and agreed to let me work here.

724
00:25:42,696 --> 00:25:43,895
It's already been one year ever since.

725
00:25:43,896 --> 00:25:46,112
(It's been 1 year since she saw ZINGER's desperation and hired her.)

726
00:25:46,136 --> 00:25:47,235
Are you the owner?

727
00:25:47,236 --> 00:25:48,305
Yes, I am.

728
00:25:48,306 --> 00:25:50,035
- Oh, I see. Hello. - Hello.

729
00:25:50,036 --> 00:25:52,475
Does ZINGER really work here as a part-timer?

730
00:25:52,476 --> 00:25:55,175
Yes, she works here to learn before starting a new location.

731
00:25:55,176 --> 00:25:56,345
- Oh, really? - Yes.

732
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:58,245
When she made the offer,

733
00:25:58,246 --> 00:25:59,315
did you know she was an idol singer?

734
00:25:59,316 --> 00:26:03,546
No, I didn't know she was an idol singer at first.

735
00:26:03,716 --> 00:26:04,955
- To be honest... Yes. - That's understandable.

736
00:26:04,956 --> 00:26:07,055
I told her to try working here as a part-timer...

737
00:26:07,056 --> 00:26:09,525
before we made our decisions. Then I realized...

738
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:10,826
that she was so good at it.

739
00:26:11,226 --> 00:26:13,865
After a few times, I realized she was so great at this job.

740
00:26:13,866 --> 00:26:16,865
She has cheery energy, and she's good with customers.

741
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:18,835
So she's still learning about the business.

742
00:26:18,836 --> 00:26:20,066
- Oh, really? - I see.

743
00:26:20,906 --> 00:26:22,535
The owner sounds so real.

744
00:26:22,536 --> 00:26:23,536
- Right. - Pardon?

745
00:26:23,736 --> 00:26:26,136
- She's the real owner. - I told you the truth.

746
00:26:27,006 --> 00:26:28,646
She's the real owner.

747
00:26:29,446 --> 00:26:32,116
Which 1 of those 4 children is you?

748
00:26:32,346 --> 00:26:34,986
(Which 1 of those 4 children is you?)

749
00:26:35,416 --> 00:26:36,486
No, none of them is.

750
00:26:37,186 --> 00:26:38,186
(Stop Kyoung Pyo.)

751
00:26:38,187 --> 00:26:39,255
Among those children?

752
00:26:39,256 --> 00:26:40,656
Isn't it obvious...

753
00:26:41,026 --> 00:26:42,455
that all four of them are boys?

754
00:26:42,456 --> 00:26:44,026
- Exactly. - None of them...

755
00:26:44,156 --> 00:26:45,525
I thought the two on the right side...

756
00:26:45,526 --> 00:26:46,955
- were girls. - Kyoung Pyo.

757
00:26:46,956 --> 00:26:48,295
- Gosh, I can't believe you. - That was funny.

758
00:26:48,296 --> 00:26:50,395
That's a photo from the 1960s.

759
00:26:50,396 --> 00:26:52,566
- An acquaintance got it for me. - Oh, no. They...

760
00:26:52,766 --> 00:26:55,466
Is that person the owner?

761
00:26:56,336 --> 00:26:58,606
Is the one in pink the owner?

762
00:26:58,976 --> 00:27:00,922
- No, that's not me. - I think she's the show's host.

763
00:27:00,946 --> 00:27:02,006
Oh, I see.

764
00:27:03,816 --> 00:27:05,816
(Blunt Siblings are the same as always.)

765
00:27:06,076 --> 00:27:07,545
Kim Sook comes here often, doesn't she?

766
00:27:07,546 --> 00:27:08,546
Yes, she comes here often.

767
00:27:08,547 --> 00:27:10,062
- She comes... - I saw her not long ago.

768
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:11,086
What?

769
00:27:11,116 --> 00:27:12,356
- You met Sook? - Yes.

770
00:27:12,816 --> 00:27:14,725
I talked to her just briefly since we were so busy.

771
00:27:14,726 --> 00:27:16,556
I barely got to say hello to her.

772
00:27:17,256 --> 00:27:18,856
(Thinking)

773
00:27:19,256 --> 00:27:20,865
My, it sounds so plausible...

774
00:27:20,866 --> 00:27:23,065
- I mean, her story... - If she made up this story too...

775
00:27:23,066 --> 00:27:24,435
- has a lot of details. - It's completely...

776
00:27:24,436 --> 00:27:25,765
- But it's possible... - This is...

777
00:27:25,766 --> 00:27:27,635
that she's been working here for a month for this show.

778
00:27:27,636 --> 00:27:29,306
Right. That's what our staff would do.

779
00:27:29,466 --> 00:27:31,226
- Really? - They always prepare for a month.

780
00:27:31,336 --> 00:27:33,335
- Right. They always do that. - Yes.

781
00:27:33,336 --> 00:27:34,345
(Could she be a fake part-timer planted by the staff?)

782
00:27:34,346 --> 00:27:35,375
- If that's true... - Shall we order food for now?

783
00:27:35,376 --> 00:27:36,776
- We'll order food now. - Okay.

784
00:27:37,416 --> 00:27:38,745
We have to order rolled omelet no matter what.

785
00:27:38,746 --> 00:27:40,015
- Rolled omelet. - What shall we order?

786
00:27:40,016 --> 00:27:41,285
- We need stew. - Which one?

787
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:42,915
- Which stew... - Pork, tuna, or ham?

788
00:27:42,916 --> 00:27:45,786
Pork kimchi stew is the best-selling dish here.

789
00:27:46,256 --> 00:27:48,176
- I'll have pork. - It's most popular, she says.

790
00:27:48,426 --> 00:27:49,955
Because I don't want to have ham in the morning.

791
00:27:49,956 --> 00:27:50,956
All right. I understand.

792
00:27:51,626 --> 00:27:52,825
Then 1 pork and 1 tuna.

793
00:27:52,826 --> 00:27:54,195
One pork and one tuna.

794
00:27:54,196 --> 00:27:55,725
- You'll have tuna? - Yes, tuna kimchi stew.

795
00:27:55,726 --> 00:27:58,136
(Childish Yu is firm about what suits his palate.)

796
00:27:59,036 --> 00:28:01,035
- What about you, Dong Yoon? - Anything would be fine for me.

797
00:28:01,036 --> 00:28:02,556
Seafood soft tofu stew is popular too.

798
00:28:03,806 --> 00:28:05,735
- How about seafood soft tofu stew? - You can add ingredients as well.

799
00:28:05,736 --> 00:28:06,736
Sounds great.

800
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:08,876
Then I'll try seafood soft tofu stew.

801
00:28:09,406 --> 00:28:11,416
- First egg in earthen pot is good. - Right.

802
00:28:11,576 --> 00:28:13,075
She says first egg in earthen pot is good.

803
00:28:13,076 --> 00:28:14,186
(Swallowing saliva)

804
00:28:14,286 --> 00:28:16,185
- We'll have that too, please. - That's all, then.

805
00:28:16,186 --> 00:28:17,256
We'll try it.

806
00:28:17,656 --> 00:28:18,656
Okay. Then...

807
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:21,002
You'll have 1 pork kimchi stew, 1 seafood soft tofu stew,

808
00:28:21,026 --> 00:28:23,185
one first egg in earthen pot, and one rolled omelet, right?

809
00:28:23,186 --> 00:28:24,195
- Correct. - Coming right up.

810
00:28:24,196 --> 00:28:26,772
(She confirms the order thoroughly before sending it to the kitchen.)

811
00:28:26,796 --> 00:28:28,195
- We got an order, sir. - Okay.

812
00:28:28,196 --> 00:28:30,595
One pork kimchi stew, one seafood soft tofu stew,

813
00:28:30,596 --> 00:28:32,676
one first egg in earthen pot, and one rolled omelet.

814
00:28:32,796 --> 00:28:34,765
I didn't expect we'd have to figure out like this.

815
00:28:34,766 --> 00:28:36,866
I must say, this is difficult.

816
00:28:37,506 --> 00:28:40,745
There's something I find suspicious.

817
00:28:40,746 --> 00:28:42,805
My father used to be an office worker,

818
00:28:42,806 --> 00:28:44,845
- but he runs a makguksu place now. - I see.

819
00:28:44,846 --> 00:28:47,445
He worked at the first location of the franchise he wanted to open...

820
00:28:47,446 --> 00:28:48,945
- just as ZINGER does now. - He worked at the restaurant.

821
00:28:48,946 --> 00:28:49,946
Oh, really?

822
00:28:49,947 --> 00:28:51,186
And it seems to me...

823
00:28:51,616 --> 00:28:53,925
that one year is a little too long.

824
00:28:53,926 --> 00:28:55,356
(Convinced)

825
00:28:55,586 --> 00:28:56,886
(Glancing)

826
00:28:57,056 --> 00:28:58,756
You're too loud. She's right behind you.

827
00:28:59,426 --> 00:29:01,626
(Oh, I forgot that.)

828
00:29:01,966 --> 00:29:03,095
Can I interrupt?

829
00:29:03,096 --> 00:29:05,695
- Of course. - I don't work here every day,

830
00:29:05,696 --> 00:29:08,112
which is why I set the time period to one year, although it's long.

831
00:29:08,136 --> 00:29:09,665
Also, I need to save up to fund my own business.

832
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:12,135
That's another reason I've been working here for over a year.

833
00:29:12,136 --> 00:29:13,136
- I see. - I see.

834
00:29:13,137 --> 00:29:15,175
- That's another reason. - Yes.

835
00:29:15,176 --> 00:29:16,705
I'll quit working here when the owner says...

836
00:29:16,706 --> 00:29:17,875
- I'm ready to leave. - I see.

837
00:29:17,876 --> 00:29:19,275
- Oh, really? - Yes.

838
00:29:19,276 --> 00:29:20,685
- Yes. - Ma'am, do you think...

839
00:29:20,686 --> 00:29:21,945
that she'll be ready soon?

840
00:29:21,946 --> 00:29:24,655
She needs to learn how to make the dishes as well.

841
00:29:24,656 --> 00:29:26,815
But she still lacks a bit of skills required in the kitchen.

842
00:29:26,816 --> 00:29:28,585
So she needs to keep working here until she masters it.

843
00:29:28,586 --> 00:29:29,755
- I see. - Oh, I see.

844
00:29:29,756 --> 00:29:31,036
(She gets convinced right away.)

845
00:29:32,056 --> 00:29:33,295
Here's rolled omelet.

846
00:29:33,296 --> 00:29:34,796
- Oh, nice. - Thank you.

847
00:29:34,996 --> 00:29:36,325
(Their food came at the perfect time.)

848
00:29:36,326 --> 00:29:38,235
- Thank you. - Rolled omelet is rather...

849
00:29:38,236 --> 00:29:39,365
Dishes like this are hard to make, actually.

850
00:29:39,366 --> 00:29:42,836
But the taste of it is always guaranteed.

851
00:29:43,436 --> 00:29:47,175
Rolled omelet is as popular as kimchi stew at our restaurant.

852
00:29:47,176 --> 00:29:48,305
(The special rolled omelet of the 25-year-old kimchi stew place)

853
00:29:48,306 --> 00:29:50,475
Our secret ingredient is milk.

854
00:29:50,476 --> 00:29:53,946
(The secret ingredient is milk.)

855
00:29:56,216 --> 00:29:57,216
(They add milk to the egg mixture.)

856
00:29:57,217 --> 00:30:00,115
We use a handsome amount of fresh eggs and milk,

857
00:30:00,116 --> 00:30:03,525
which gives our rolled omelet a very smooth and plump texture.

858
00:30:03,526 --> 00:30:05,126
(It has a smoother and plumper texture.)

859
00:30:05,396 --> 00:30:06,925
As you know, rolled omelet is an essential dish...

860
00:30:06,926 --> 00:30:08,595
to have with kimchi stew.

861
00:30:08,596 --> 00:30:11,295
(This popular dish in Sinsa-dong...)

862
00:30:11,296 --> 00:30:14,005
(sells 100 servings per day in average.)

863
00:30:14,006 --> 00:30:17,165
It's the most popular side dish at our restaurant.

864
00:30:17,166 --> 00:30:19,476
(How does kimchi stew's partner rolled omelet taste?)

865
00:30:20,076 --> 00:30:21,875
(Dip it in ketchup.)

866
00:30:21,876 --> 00:30:22,975
(And blow on it before eating.)

867
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:24,616
It goes well with stew and cooked rice.

868
00:30:27,446 --> 00:30:29,486
- Is it good? - Yes, it's really tasty.

869
00:30:30,856 --> 00:30:32,285
(He really enjoys rolled omelet.)

870
00:30:32,286 --> 00:30:34,255
(Kyoung Pyo who is not William)

871
00:30:34,256 --> 00:30:35,985
- It's good, you know. - This is tasty.

872
00:30:35,986 --> 00:30:37,495
It's savorier and nuttier when you eat them together.

873
00:30:37,496 --> 00:30:38,496
It's good.

874
00:30:38,556 --> 00:30:40,095
- Is it? - It's so good.

875
00:30:40,096 --> 00:30:41,096
(Gobbling down)

876
00:30:41,097 --> 00:30:42,402
(While everyone is savoring the rolled omelet...)

877
00:30:42,426 --> 00:30:44,536
Here's seafood soft tofu stew.

878
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:47,035
- It's hot. Do not touch it. - Okay.

879
00:30:47,036 --> 00:30:48,365
- Be careful and enjoy. - Thank you.

880
00:30:48,366 --> 00:30:49,466
Thank you.

881
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:51,606
She seems overly cheery.

882
00:30:53,776 --> 00:30:55,576
(Turning her head slowly)

883
00:30:55,746 --> 00:30:57,186
- Isn't she overly cheery? - Is she?

884
00:30:57,646 --> 00:30:59,515
- Like she's worried about us. - She's serving food to that table.

885
00:30:59,516 --> 00:31:01,362
We should see how she behaves at another table.

886
00:31:01,386 --> 00:31:02,915
Take a look and order, please.

887
00:31:02,916 --> 00:31:03,945
Can I have kimchi stew?

888
00:31:03,946 --> 00:31:05,616
- Pork kimchi stew? Okay. - Yes, please.

889
00:31:06,516 --> 00:31:08,425
From what I just saw, I think she exaggerates...

890
00:31:08,426 --> 00:31:10,025
only when she waits our table.

891
00:31:10,026 --> 00:31:11,746
That's not true. She's always over the top.

892
00:31:12,856 --> 00:31:15,225
(She's always over the top.)

893
00:31:15,226 --> 00:31:16,865
She treats all the customers that way.

894
00:31:16,866 --> 00:31:19,365
I like that very much since our customers like it.

895
00:31:19,366 --> 00:31:21,065
- Oh, really? - I see.

896
00:31:21,066 --> 00:31:23,605
- You should smile at customers. - That's right.

897
00:31:23,606 --> 00:31:24,975
She seems so natural.

898
00:31:24,976 --> 00:31:27,476
Seafood soft tofu stew is amazing.

899
00:31:27,876 --> 00:31:30,245
(She's amazed by the food, without caring about if it's real.)

900
00:31:30,246 --> 00:31:32,086
- Seafood soft tofu stew is so good. - Indeed.

901
00:31:32,876 --> 00:31:35,646
Seafood sure is better for breakfast, just as I thought.

902
00:31:35,886 --> 00:31:38,686
(Seafood soft tofu stew)

903
00:31:39,156 --> 00:31:41,286
(Mix it with cooked rice and slurp it all together.)

904
00:31:41,756 --> 00:31:44,096
(It's so tasty that you become angry.)

905
00:31:44,226 --> 00:31:46,325
It's simply clean and refreshing, right?

906
00:31:46,326 --> 00:31:48,246
(Dong Yoon gets angry too because it's so good.)

907
00:31:48,396 --> 00:31:49,895
Seafood is refreshing, you know.

908
00:31:49,896 --> 00:31:51,535
(Childish Yu, who likes seafood, mixes the stew with rice.)

909
00:31:51,536 --> 00:31:53,465
Soft tofu is good for health,

910
00:31:53,466 --> 00:31:54,865
- and it makes you feel full. - Right.

911
00:31:54,866 --> 00:31:56,306
(He's emptying his bowl.)

912
00:31:56,536 --> 00:31:58,305
My, this seafood soft tofu stew is fantastic.

913
00:31:58,306 --> 00:31:59,375
- It's good, right? - Yes.

914
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:01,546
(Kyoung Pyo is happy.)

915
00:32:01,646 --> 00:32:03,545
Here's first egg in earthen pot.

916
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:04,646
Oh, it's here.

917
00:32:04,846 --> 00:32:07,076
(Bubbling first egg in earthen pot)

918
00:32:07,946 --> 00:32:09,485
Here's another dish we're proud of.

919
00:32:09,486 --> 00:32:11,756
First egg in earthen pot is steamed eggs.

920
00:32:12,656 --> 00:32:15,155
We have our own secret recipe of first egg in earthen pot.

921
00:32:15,156 --> 00:32:17,455
We add a large amount of seafood to the vegetable broth...

922
00:32:17,456 --> 00:32:19,555
and use only fresh first eggs that chickens lay.

923
00:32:19,556 --> 00:32:21,596
(They use only fresh first eggs that chickens lay!)

924
00:32:22,666 --> 00:32:24,065
Unlike other restaurants,

925
00:32:24,066 --> 00:32:26,035
we boil it in a large earthen pot,

926
00:32:26,036 --> 00:32:27,806
which helps steamed eggs even fluffier.

927
00:32:28,136 --> 00:32:30,366
It's really soft and delicious.

928
00:32:30,566 --> 00:32:34,106
(Steamed eggs that is as soft as cotton candy is done.)

929
00:32:34,406 --> 00:32:38,046
(He has a bite while it's hot.)

930
00:32:38,416 --> 00:32:39,775
This is the taste I wanted.

931
00:32:39,776 --> 00:32:40,885
(It warms you up inside.)

932
00:32:40,886 --> 00:32:42,386
It's so great as expected.

933
00:32:43,386 --> 00:32:45,655
- What ingredients are in here? - It has shrimp roe...

934
00:32:45,656 --> 00:32:47,855
and flying fish roe...

935
00:32:47,856 --> 00:32:49,155
- Stuff like that. - Shrimp roe?

936
00:32:49,156 --> 00:32:51,295
No, not shrimp roe. Shrimp... What is it called?

937
00:32:51,296 --> 00:32:52,625
It's a type of shrimp. And there's squid too.

938
00:32:52,626 --> 00:32:54,595
- You mean, frozen peeled shrimp? - Yes, correct.

939
00:32:54,596 --> 00:32:57,065
- Not shrimp roe. - She does have poor kitchen skills.

940
00:32:57,066 --> 00:32:58,365
- I see that. - So it's a little...

941
00:32:58,366 --> 00:33:00,446
I have a poor Korean vocabulary, not kitchen skills.

942
00:33:01,206 --> 00:33:03,012
(I have a poor Korean vocabulary, not kitchen skills!)

943
00:33:03,036 --> 00:33:04,135
(They burst into laughter.)

944
00:33:04,136 --> 00:33:05,835
She has a poor Korean vocabulary as well.

945
00:33:05,836 --> 00:33:07,505
I know how you feel, ZINGER.

946
00:33:07,506 --> 00:33:10,345
- Rappers have a poor vocabulary. - Right.

947
00:33:10,346 --> 00:33:12,646
That doesn't mean my English is good, though.

948
00:33:14,516 --> 00:33:17,446
- My Korean is not so good either. - Both of them are rappers.

949
00:33:18,156 --> 00:33:20,256
(At the same time, in the kitchen...)

950
00:33:20,616 --> 00:33:23,286
(The restaurant's signature dish is boiling up.)

951
00:33:23,386 --> 00:33:25,396
Our representative dish, kimchi stew...

952
00:33:26,326 --> 00:33:28,496
sells over 300 servings per day.

953
00:33:29,266 --> 00:33:32,266
The monthly sales have been maintained above 80,000 dollars.

954
00:33:32,536 --> 00:33:33,935
It's famous for its consistent taste...

955
00:33:33,936 --> 00:33:35,416
that hasn't changed in over 20 years.

956
00:33:36,836 --> 00:33:39,205
The secret to the taste is the kimchi we use.

957
00:33:39,206 --> 00:33:40,806
(The secret ingredient is fresh kimchi!)

958
00:33:40,946 --> 00:33:44,376
Every morning, boxes of kimchi from Gangwon Province are delivered.

959
00:33:44,716 --> 00:33:46,875
Gangwon Province style kimchi has a refreshing taste.

960
00:33:46,876 --> 00:33:48,815
In order to deepen the kimchi flavor in the broth,

961
00:33:48,816 --> 00:33:51,386
we stir-fry kimchi first, which is the key point.

962
00:33:51,956 --> 00:33:53,855
Also, we don't use raw pork either.

963
00:33:53,856 --> 00:33:55,485
We season pork and then stir-fry it in advance.

964
00:33:55,486 --> 00:33:57,446
This is our own secret way of making kimchi stew.

965
00:33:58,326 --> 00:34:00,025
We make broth with a variety of fresh ingredients,

966
00:34:00,026 --> 00:34:01,966
and we make new broth every day.

967
00:34:02,566 --> 00:34:03,925
(Put kimchi and pork in nickel-silver pots.)

968
00:34:03,926 --> 00:34:06,766
We put stir-fried kimchi and pork in nickel-silver pots.

969
00:34:07,806 --> 00:34:09,135
Then we pour broth and boil it.

970
00:34:09,136 --> 00:34:10,835
This process deepens the flavor.

971
00:34:10,836 --> 00:34:12,036
(Pour hot broth on top of it.)

972
00:34:12,506 --> 00:34:15,876
(When the color of the broth turns red...)

973
00:34:16,006 --> 00:34:18,576
We also add large pieces of tofu.

974
00:34:19,046 --> 00:34:20,315
(It dominates social media.)

975
00:34:20,316 --> 00:34:22,315
Since it's very famous as a great restaurant in Gangnam,

976
00:34:22,316 --> 00:34:24,516
many foreign tourists visit our restaurant as well.

977
00:34:24,716 --> 00:34:28,586
I guarantee that it's the best place in the country to have kimchi stew.

978
00:34:30,686 --> 00:34:32,425
Here's pork kimchi stew.

979
00:34:32,426 --> 00:34:33,825
Oh, this one looks so good.

980
00:34:33,826 --> 00:34:36,366
- I'll try pork kimchi stew. - Pork kimchi stew.

981
00:34:37,196 --> 00:34:39,996
(She scoops some pork kimchi stew into her bowl first.)

982
00:34:41,266 --> 00:34:43,236
(She slurps the broth.)

983
00:34:43,766 --> 00:34:45,076
This is the taste I like.

984
00:34:45,476 --> 00:34:46,806
It's so good as expected.

985
00:34:48,106 --> 00:34:49,175
(Exclaiming in amazement)

986
00:34:49,176 --> 00:34:50,246
It's really tasty.

987
00:34:50,746 --> 00:34:53,045
- Soup sure is good for breakfast. - Right. It's so good.

988
00:34:53,046 --> 00:34:55,045
Right? You can't resist hot soup.

989
00:34:55,046 --> 00:34:56,246
(Satisfied)

990
00:34:57,756 --> 00:35:00,216
I didn't know it was this good. It's amazing.

991
00:35:00,756 --> 00:35:02,186
(Sigh of satisfaction)

992
00:35:02,456 --> 00:35:04,455
- The fat in the stew is amazing. - Right.

993
00:35:04,456 --> 00:35:05,672
(He drinks the broth from the bowl.)

994
00:35:05,696 --> 00:35:07,095
- It's incredible, isn't it? - It's good.

995
00:35:07,096 --> 00:35:09,165
(She jumps in for the 2nd time.)

996
00:35:09,166 --> 00:35:10,595
- Oh, my. Seriously... - Yes, it is.

997
00:35:10,596 --> 00:35:11,765
(Staring)

998
00:35:11,766 --> 00:35:13,286
- It's so good, right? - It's so good.

999
00:35:13,666 --> 00:35:15,235
This is really amazing.

1000
00:35:15,236 --> 00:35:16,865
(Prowling)

1001
00:35:16,866 --> 00:35:17,875
Well, it's a little...

1002
00:35:17,876 --> 00:35:18,906
(Chuckling)

1003
00:35:19,306 --> 00:35:20,306
Why?

1004
00:35:21,176 --> 00:35:23,576
ZINGER, why are you staying here, roaming around?

1005
00:35:24,076 --> 00:35:25,915
I have to keep my eyes on the customers...

1006
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:27,646
- to see if they need anything. - I see.

1007
00:35:28,186 --> 00:35:29,186
Oh, I see.

1008
00:35:29,546 --> 00:35:31,255
(Even so, she's roaming around only us.)

1009
00:35:31,256 --> 00:35:32,336
But you keep watching us...

1010
00:35:32,516 --> 00:35:34,836
It's just hard to believe that you, Yu Jae Seok, are here.

1011
00:35:35,126 --> 00:35:37,825
(ZINGER is so cheery.)

1012
00:35:37,826 --> 00:35:39,996
- Welcome. - Welcome.

1013
00:35:42,366 --> 00:35:43,526
I think I can guess right.

1014
00:35:43,796 --> 00:35:44,996
- Really? - Yes.

1015
00:35:45,636 --> 00:35:46,866
This place...

1016
00:35:47,836 --> 00:35:49,336
seems to be real. I'm sure of it.

1017
00:35:49,466 --> 00:35:51,476
- Why? - Her story has a lot of details.

1018
00:35:51,836 --> 00:35:55,046
And she reacts to the customers right away.

1019
00:35:55,476 --> 00:35:56,476
(Nodding)

1020
00:35:56,476 --> 00:35:57,476
It's so good.

1021
00:35:57,477 --> 00:35:58,615
- It's good? - Yes.

1022
00:35:58,616 --> 00:36:01,316
(Did she just say, "It's so good?")

1023
00:36:01,586 --> 00:36:03,986
(Bluntie is busy eating, forgetting about deduction.)

1024
00:36:04,246 --> 00:36:05,615
We just can't communicate with each other.

1025
00:36:05,616 --> 00:36:08,426
Then how can we approach the right answer?

1026
00:36:09,156 --> 00:36:10,425
It's so tasty.

1027
00:36:10,426 --> 00:36:11,632
(But it's so good, and I can't help it.)

1028
00:36:11,656 --> 00:36:12,796
My, it's really good.

1029
00:36:17,226 --> 00:36:18,466
It's so strange...

1030
00:36:19,066 --> 00:36:22,166
that it's just right where I can see from my seat.

1031
00:36:22,436 --> 00:36:25,275
It says, "My dear ZINGER, go for it. From Secret."

1032
00:36:25,276 --> 00:36:27,382
- And there's an autograph there. - What? Oh, you're right.

1033
00:36:27,406 --> 00:36:28,886
- There's an autograph there. - What?

1034
00:36:29,076 --> 00:36:30,156
- Oh, you're right. - What?

1035
00:36:30,446 --> 00:36:32,575
- He's right. - It's directly in front of me.

1036
00:36:32,576 --> 00:36:35,285
- "My dear ZINGER, go for it." - That's right.

1037
00:36:35,286 --> 00:36:37,345
- It was signed last September. - Right.

1038
00:36:37,346 --> 00:36:38,585
- Is the date written there? - Yes.

1039
00:36:38,586 --> 00:36:39,885
It was last September.

1040
00:36:39,886 --> 00:36:41,326
That makes her story right.

1041
00:36:41,586 --> 00:36:43,326
But isn't it suspiciously accurate?

1042
00:36:43,556 --> 00:36:45,995
Who signed that one?

1043
00:36:45,996 --> 00:36:47,842
- I think it was a member of Secret. - That one, over there.

1044
00:36:47,866 --> 00:36:50,825
The only member who has visited here is Hyo Seong.

1045
00:36:50,826 --> 00:36:54,135
- So that's Hyo Seong's autograph? - Yes, correct.

1046
00:36:54,136 --> 00:36:55,335
(The star of the autograph is...)

1047
00:36:55,336 --> 00:36:58,206
(Jun Hyo Seong, one of the members of Secret.)

1048
00:36:58,606 --> 00:37:01,946
We need to compare it with her handwriting.

1049
00:37:02,676 --> 00:37:04,105
Are we allowed to look up Hyo Seong's autograph?

1050
00:37:04,106 --> 00:37:06,145
Well... Okay, we'll allow it, and no further.

1051
00:37:06,146 --> 00:37:07,426
No further than that is allowed.

1052
00:37:07,576 --> 00:37:09,715
- Because it might not be hers? - Right.

1053
00:37:09,716 --> 00:37:11,092
Maybe it's different from her handwriting.

1054
00:37:11,116 --> 00:37:12,156
It's hers.

1055
00:37:12,456 --> 00:37:13,856
- Is it? - Yes.

1056
00:37:14,686 --> 00:37:16,455
- Oh, it's hers. - Show me.

1057
00:37:16,456 --> 00:37:19,125
- Right. There's a star in both. - Yes, I see that it's hers.

1058
00:37:19,126 --> 00:37:20,526
It really is Hyo Seong's autograph.

1059
00:37:20,726 --> 00:37:21,795
It's Hyo Seong's autograph.

1060
00:37:21,796 --> 00:37:23,272
(As Hyo Seong's autograph appears, it's shrouded deeper in mystery.)

1061
00:37:23,296 --> 00:37:24,325
But you see...

1062
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:26,565
(The handwriting is hers, but why is it where Kyoung Pyo can see?)

1063
00:37:26,566 --> 00:37:28,165
(Is it perhaps a trap set by the staff?)

1064
00:37:28,166 --> 00:37:29,666
(So could it be fake?)

1065
00:37:29,736 --> 00:37:30,835
- Number 18. - Okay.

1066
00:37:30,836 --> 00:37:32,035
(Perking up his ears)

1067
00:37:32,036 --> 00:37:34,135
The staff in the kitchen...

1068
00:37:34,136 --> 00:37:37,006
seem to be working so naturally with ZINGER.

1069
00:37:37,146 --> 00:37:39,916
If he felt awkward around her, he would've spoken formally.

1070
00:37:40,046 --> 00:37:42,385
But he casually said, "Number 18."

1071
00:37:42,386 --> 00:37:43,386
(Number 18!)

1072
00:37:43,387 --> 00:37:44,415
(Okay!)

1073
00:37:44,416 --> 00:37:46,586
It feels like she's used to working here.

1074
00:37:47,716 --> 00:37:50,525
- She identifies her tasks fast... - Exactly.

1075
00:37:50,526 --> 00:37:52,256
- Even while chatting. - Right.

1076
00:37:52,456 --> 00:37:55,066
(Even while chatting, in this large place...)

1077
00:37:55,266 --> 00:37:56,766
Number 18.

1078
00:37:56,966 --> 00:37:59,235
- Here's your food. Please enjoy. - Thank you.

1079
00:37:59,236 --> 00:38:01,312
(She serves food to the right table without any mistakes.)

1080
00:38:01,336 --> 00:38:03,465
(Even the first person is difficult to figure out.)

1081
00:38:03,466 --> 00:38:05,236
It seems like she's real, but then again...

1082
00:38:05,536 --> 00:38:06,705
(ZINGER, the aspiring entrepreneur: 1. A detailed story behind her plan)

1083
00:38:06,706 --> 00:38:07,975
(2. Overly cheery for a part-timer, 3. Equipped with good server skills)

1084
00:38:07,976 --> 00:38:09,776
Gosh. Today's mission is difficult as always.

1085
00:38:11,146 --> 00:38:12,575
- Oh, boy. It's difficult. - Even the first place is difficult.

1086
00:38:12,576 --> 00:38:13,946
My, this is difficult.

1087
00:38:14,276 --> 00:38:15,846
Oh, wait. I'll cash you out.

1088
00:38:16,646 --> 00:38:19,885
Jae Seok, I have something to tell you.

1089
00:38:19,886 --> 00:38:21,355
Ten years ago, I received...

1090
00:38:21,356 --> 00:38:23,525
- your autograph. Do you remember? - What? Look at this.

1091
00:38:23,526 --> 00:38:24,696
Oh, my.

1092
00:38:24,826 --> 00:38:26,896
- You said you'd see me again. - What is it?

1093
00:38:27,356 --> 00:38:29,165
- Goodness. It was ten years ago. - Yes.

1094
00:38:29,166 --> 00:38:30,465
My goodness.

1095
00:38:30,466 --> 00:38:32,135
I gave this to her on May 1.

1096
00:38:32,136 --> 00:38:33,642
(10 years ago, Jae Seok wrote that he hoped to see her again.)

1097
00:38:33,666 --> 00:38:35,235
(Ha Na, I wish all your wishes come true this year!)

1098
00:38:35,236 --> 00:38:36,735
(Thank you! I hope to see you again!)

1099
00:38:36,736 --> 00:38:39,135
I laminated it and put it up on my dressing table...

1100
00:38:39,136 --> 00:38:40,535
so that I could receive...

1101
00:38:40,536 --> 00:38:42,345
- Almighty Yu's energy. - It was 2016.

1102
00:38:42,346 --> 00:38:43,605
And I finally met you again.

1103
00:38:43,606 --> 00:38:44,752
(ZINGER cherished it until she actually met him again.)

1104
00:38:44,776 --> 00:38:46,345
- He met her again as he said. - Exactly.

1105
00:38:46,346 --> 00:38:47,576
- We met again. - Yes.

1106
00:38:47,676 --> 00:38:50,086
- ZINGER, we met again here... - I'm tearing up.

1107
00:38:50,516 --> 00:38:52,085
Can all of you leave your autographs for us...

1108
00:38:52,086 --> 00:38:54,255
- since you came in 2025? - Of course.

1109
00:38:54,256 --> 00:38:56,355
- It's for the restaurant. - It feels like she's real.

1110
00:38:56,356 --> 00:38:59,117
- Of course, I can sign it for you. - Exactly. She acts so naturally.

1111
00:38:59,726 --> 00:39:00,755
(Hissing)

1112
00:39:00,756 --> 00:39:02,696
- Oh, gosh. - Here. Oh, it's stuck.

1113
00:39:03,066 --> 00:39:04,735
I'll write, "Go, ZINGER."

1114
00:39:04,736 --> 00:39:05,736
(Happy)

1115
00:39:05,736 --> 00:39:06,736
What?

1116
00:39:07,436 --> 00:39:08,735
I wrote, "Go, ZINGER."

1117
00:39:08,736 --> 00:39:11,305
If ZINGER were fake, this would be pointless.

1118
00:39:11,306 --> 00:39:12,476
That's right.

1119
00:39:12,606 --> 00:39:14,436
Since you wrote, "Go, ZINGER..."

1120
00:39:14,976 --> 00:39:17,246
Is ZINGER real? Could this place...

1121
00:39:17,916 --> 00:39:19,516
- Why? What's the matter? - I mean...

1122
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:21,586
- We'll meet again, right? - Absolutely.

1123
00:39:21,686 --> 00:39:22,885
Please visit my restaurant when I open up a new location.

1124
00:39:22,886 --> 00:39:24,886
I'll do that. I'll be sure to visit you in Yangju.

1125
00:39:25,556 --> 00:39:28,685
- My gosh. This is so difficult. - It's difficult, right?

1126
00:39:28,686 --> 00:39:29,862
(ZINGER acted naturally to the end. Could she be real?)

1127
00:39:29,886 --> 00:39:32,696
The next person we'll visit is a nonsense chef.

1128
00:39:33,356 --> 00:39:34,495
- A nonsense chef? - A nonsense chef?

1129
00:39:34,496 --> 00:39:36,195
- Yes. A nonsense chef... - What does that mean?

1130
00:39:36,196 --> 00:39:38,465
- Why would he be nonsense? - Where is the place?

1131
00:39:38,466 --> 00:39:41,235
The address is Hakdong-ro...

1132
00:39:41,236 --> 00:39:42,736
Garosu Street? It's that way.

1133
00:39:43,466 --> 00:39:44,466
This way, everyone.

1134
00:39:44,467 --> 00:39:48,046
(The members set off to meet the second trendy person.)

1135
00:39:48,546 --> 00:39:51,445
Oh, my. This car looks so cool.

1136
00:39:51,446 --> 00:39:53,475
Oh, this is a Brabus.

1137
00:39:53,476 --> 00:39:55,346
- Vroom. - It's a G-Class, right?

1138
00:39:55,446 --> 00:39:57,685
It's a G-Class with Brabus' tuning.

1139
00:39:57,686 --> 00:39:59,162
(G-Class with B company's tuning, between 200,000 and 300,000 dollars)

1140
00:39:59,186 --> 00:40:00,355
How do you know so much about cars?

1141
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:01,455
- It's basic. - You know everything. I see.

1142
00:40:01,456 --> 00:40:03,185
There's nothing our village chief doesn't know.

1143
00:40:03,186 --> 00:40:05,306
- He's a walking encyclopedia. - He knows everything.

1144
00:40:05,356 --> 00:40:07,555
- I get to see such a cool car here. - I know, right?

1145
00:40:07,556 --> 00:40:09,142
(I get to see a fancy car now that I'm in Gangnam.)

1146
00:40:09,166 --> 00:40:11,396
They make great ramen at this place.

1147
00:40:11,636 --> 00:40:12,666
You'll eat again?

1148
00:40:13,866 --> 00:40:16,436
Hey, we've only walked ten steps since we left.

1149
00:40:16,566 --> 00:40:18,336
- We only walked ten steps. - I mean...

1150
00:40:18,706 --> 00:40:21,076
I really enjoyed shoyu ramen here.

1151
00:40:21,236 --> 00:40:22,275
It does look tasty.

1152
00:40:22,276 --> 00:40:23,845
(He's sad, so he strikes a V pose for the customers inside.)

1153
00:40:23,846 --> 00:40:24,876
The food looks tasty.

1154
00:40:25,746 --> 00:40:27,645
I guess you come here often.

1155
00:40:27,646 --> 00:40:29,385
I came here after quite a long time.

1156
00:40:29,386 --> 00:40:30,885
But the places I used to visit are still here.

1157
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:32,785
- It's been a very long time. - Famous restaurants...

1158
00:40:32,786 --> 00:40:34,356
- usually make steady sales. - Right.

1159
00:40:34,656 --> 00:40:36,756
Oh, this is an optical store too.

1160
00:40:37,586 --> 00:40:39,855
(As they walk down the street, they see a fashion eyewear store...)

1161
00:40:39,856 --> 00:40:42,425
I didn't know that there were so many trendy places.

1162
00:40:42,426 --> 00:40:46,696
(and various types of boutique that have many unusual items.)

1163
00:40:47,166 --> 00:40:49,666
(Garosu Street, the sacred area with trendy places)

1164
00:40:50,066 --> 00:40:51,666
(Warning: You may spend too much money.)

1165
00:40:51,876 --> 00:40:53,575
Mimi, you must be interested in fashion eyewear.

1166
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:56,176
- I like glasses and sunglasses. - As a fashion item?

1167
00:40:56,376 --> 00:40:59,346
That's why I spend all my money every time I make money.

1168
00:40:59,846 --> 00:41:02,145
(Mimi is cute.)

1169
00:41:02,146 --> 00:41:03,685
Dong Yoon, do you have any siblings?

1170
00:41:03,686 --> 00:41:05,015
I have an older brother.

1171
00:41:05,016 --> 00:41:06,115
- An older brother? - Yes.

1172
00:41:06,116 --> 00:41:07,585
How is your relationship with him?

1173
00:41:07,586 --> 00:41:09,256
Well, brothers usually...

1174
00:41:09,656 --> 00:41:12,125
- don't talk much... Right. - With each other.

1175
00:41:12,126 --> 00:41:13,555
Besides, I'm from Gyeongsang Province.

1176
00:41:13,556 --> 00:41:14,556
(Jang Dong Yoon, age 32, a man from Gyeongsang Province)

1177
00:41:14,557 --> 00:41:17,596
We went to Busan last week, didn't we?

1178
00:41:17,896 --> 00:41:19,635
Kyoung Pyo, where did you learn the dialect?

1179
00:41:19,636 --> 00:41:20,636
(Where did you learn the dialect?)

1180
00:41:20,637 --> 00:41:21,865
- It's weird, right? - Yes, a little bit.

1181
00:41:21,866 --> 00:41:23,805
It's obvious that he's fake.

1182
00:41:23,806 --> 00:41:26,035
Those who speak the dialect say...

1183
00:41:26,036 --> 00:41:28,245
- They say they don't talk that way. - Right. That's not how they speak.

1184
00:41:28,246 --> 00:41:29,622
(People in Busan want you to stop speak in that dialect.)

1185
00:41:29,646 --> 00:41:31,045
- Wait. I know this place. - What?

1186
00:41:31,046 --> 00:41:33,575
- This is a fun place to visit. - Indeed.

1187
00:41:33,576 --> 00:41:35,045
This place has fun things...

1188
00:41:35,046 --> 00:41:36,646
Isn't this the N store?

1189
00:41:36,916 --> 00:41:39,355
- Shall we not go inside? Oh, boy. - This place is...

1190
00:41:39,356 --> 00:41:42,086
- I can't believe we're here. - Look at that.

1191
00:41:42,386 --> 00:41:43,925
I'll be dazzled again.

1192
00:41:43,926 --> 00:41:45,126
- Yes. - Oh, my. Hello.

1193
00:41:46,196 --> 00:41:48,566
- It's filled with sentiments. - Right?

1194
00:41:48,726 --> 00:41:50,265
(Including various fashion items...)

1195
00:41:50,266 --> 00:41:52,536
- The clothes here are so nice. - They're really nice.

1196
00:41:54,036 --> 00:41:57,706
(The store is filled with many items in different shapes and colors.)

1197
00:41:58,106 --> 00:41:59,835
(They have a unique concept.)

1198
00:41:59,836 --> 00:42:01,545
They look like lollipops,

1199
00:42:01,546 --> 00:42:02,905
but they're actually golf balls...

1200
00:42:02,906 --> 00:42:04,245
- Those are pins. - Pins that are placed on a green.

1201
00:42:04,246 --> 00:42:06,116
Hey, this keyring is really nice.

1202
00:42:06,446 --> 00:42:08,645
My, they have all sorts of items.

1203
00:42:08,646 --> 00:42:12,116
(It's a boutique filled with unique item designs.)

1204
00:42:12,456 --> 00:42:16,856
(It's a trendy place in Gangnam that's seen on social media often.)

1205
00:42:17,856 --> 00:42:21,055
It's themed as a convenience store, apparently.

1206
00:42:21,056 --> 00:42:23,142
(The new type of department store themed as a convenience store)

1207
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:24,935
So those trendy items I see on the streets...

1208
00:42:24,936 --> 00:42:26,935
- are from places like this. - That's right.

1209
00:42:26,936 --> 00:42:28,535
- All trendy things are here. - Yes.

1210
00:42:28,536 --> 00:42:30,105
Which one is your favorite?

1211
00:42:30,106 --> 00:42:32,226
- Well... I think... - Locust likes a pom-pom beanie.

1212
00:42:33,236 --> 00:42:35,876
(Locust likes a pom-pom beanie.)

1213
00:42:36,106 --> 00:42:38,475
- "Locust likes a pom-pom beanie?" - You do like it.

1214
00:42:38,476 --> 00:42:39,545
(How could you say such a thing?)

1215
00:42:39,546 --> 00:42:41,816
- There are insects here. - I see. Where?

1216
00:42:41,916 --> 00:42:44,445
- Oh, he's right. - There are insects on the hat.

1217
00:42:44,446 --> 00:42:45,755
- Right. - Oh, that's right.

1218
00:42:45,756 --> 00:42:48,685
- It looks like a longhorn beetle. - This is a little too much.

1219
00:42:48,686 --> 00:42:49,825
- It's a little too much. - Is it?

1220
00:42:49,826 --> 00:42:51,795
I really like the cap I'm wearing.

1221
00:42:51,796 --> 00:42:52,825
(Jae Seok met his friend?)

1222
00:42:52,826 --> 00:42:54,395
Jae Seok, what do you think of this one?

1223
00:42:54,396 --> 00:42:57,166
- Hey. - It looks a bit like Jae Seok.

1224
00:42:57,266 --> 00:42:58,935
Well, it does look a little bit like me.

1225
00:42:58,936 --> 00:43:01,035
- His glasses and... - Hey, Jae Seok.

1226
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:03,105
- It looks like you. - You two look alike.

1227
00:43:03,106 --> 00:43:05,775
- I don't like bizarre things. - "Bizarre?"

1228
00:43:05,776 --> 00:43:07,106
- "Bizarre?" - Bizarre stuff.

1229
00:43:08,206 --> 00:43:09,576
(Hold on a second.)

1230
00:43:10,476 --> 00:43:11,546
Kyoung Pyo...

1231
00:43:12,246 --> 00:43:13,875
What is Mimi doing? Oh, that's perfect for Kyoung Pyo.

1232
00:43:13,876 --> 00:43:15,685
- It's perfect for him. Indeed. - It's perfect for Kyoung Pyo.

1233
00:43:15,686 --> 00:43:18,515
- Those shorts... - Your shorts are here, Kyoung Pyo.

1234
00:43:18,516 --> 00:43:19,876
Kyoung Pyo, you should have those.

1235
00:43:19,956 --> 00:43:22,085
- I like shorts above the knee. - It's perfect.

1236
00:43:22,086 --> 00:43:23,925
- This is it. - Kyoung Pyo, you should have it.

1237
00:43:23,926 --> 00:43:26,155
- It barely covers your butt. - Now, whenever I see vivid shorts,

1238
00:43:26,156 --> 00:43:27,236
I'm reminded of Kyoung Pyo.

1239
00:43:27,826 --> 00:43:29,626
- That's perfect for Kyoung Pyo. - Right.

1240
00:43:30,126 --> 00:43:31,536
This is it.

1241
00:43:31,836 --> 00:43:33,665
(She's genuinely happy.)

1242
00:43:33,666 --> 00:43:35,912
Kyoung Pyo, how about you wear shorts that are a little bit longer?

1243
00:43:35,936 --> 00:43:37,266
Gosh. It's hard to decide.

1244
00:43:37,436 --> 00:43:38,935
Oh, my. I want to buy this one.

1245
00:43:38,936 --> 00:43:40,775
- Can we try this on? - We can, right?

1246
00:43:40,776 --> 00:43:42,205
Nice. I like things like this so much.

1247
00:43:42,206 --> 00:43:43,775
- I have a collection at home. - Try it on.

1248
00:43:43,776 --> 00:43:44,845
(He tries it on right away.)

1249
00:43:44,846 --> 00:43:46,715
- I really like stuff like this. - That's nice.

1250
00:43:46,716 --> 00:43:47,876
Kyoung Pyo looks pretty now.

1251
00:43:48,886 --> 00:43:50,816
Kyoung Pyo, you look better in this.

1252
00:43:51,186 --> 00:43:53,456
(Laughing)

1253
00:43:53,616 --> 00:43:56,786
- Kyoung Pyo is one bizarre man. - He's unusual.

1254
00:43:58,256 --> 00:43:59,455
These are vintage.

1255
00:43:59,456 --> 00:44:01,595
- They're second-hand clothes. - Yes.

1256
00:44:01,596 --> 00:44:04,365
- Items from many brands are here. - Oh, really?

1257
00:44:04,366 --> 00:44:06,136
So this is how they display vintage clothes.

1258
00:44:06,236 --> 00:44:07,265
It's from the H brand, indeed.

1259
00:44:07,266 --> 00:44:08,335
(Vintage: Retro clothing that's used, but still valuable.)

1260
00:44:08,336 --> 00:44:09,766
Are there any designer goods there?

1261
00:44:10,866 --> 00:44:12,275
This isn't from R brand, is it?

1262
00:44:12,276 --> 00:44:13,375
- No, it isn't. - I think...

1263
00:44:13,376 --> 00:44:15,105
By the way, Mimi, I see that...

1264
00:44:15,106 --> 00:44:16,376
you care so much about brands.

1265
00:44:16,706 --> 00:44:18,715
- She likes designer goods. - She cares a lot about brands.

1266
00:44:18,716 --> 00:44:21,016
- That's all I care about. - Dong Yoon is...

1267
00:44:21,616 --> 00:44:22,985
Oh, this cap is from S brand.

1268
00:44:22,986 --> 00:44:24,615
That one is used.

1269
00:44:24,616 --> 00:44:26,655
It's pretty. I like the orange color.

1270
00:44:26,656 --> 00:44:27,786
(It looks nice.)

1271
00:44:27,886 --> 00:44:29,125
Jae Seok, how do I look?

1272
00:44:29,126 --> 00:44:30,286
It's from S brand.

1273
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:32,502
- It's from S brand. - You don't look good in it.

1274
00:44:32,526 --> 00:44:34,232
- But it's from S brand. - You don't look good in it.

1275
00:44:34,256 --> 00:44:35,265
You're trying to mooch off of Jae Seok again, right?

1276
00:44:35,266 --> 00:44:36,426
Why do you only ask Jae Seok?

1277
00:44:36,966 --> 00:44:39,095
- This one is Supreme! - It doesn't fit you.

1278
00:44:39,096 --> 00:44:40,436
(I won't buy it for you!)

1279
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:42,966
- I failed. - You know...

1280
00:44:43,706 --> 00:44:45,106
What a bummer. I almost made it.

1281
00:44:45,836 --> 00:44:48,976
(Failed to get Jae Seok to pay)

1282
00:44:49,376 --> 00:44:50,376
(While all are enjoying shopping, )

1283
00:44:50,377 --> 00:44:51,576
This section is cool!

1284
00:44:52,646 --> 00:44:55,046
(Dong Yoon has been all quiet since the beginning.)

1285
00:44:55,346 --> 00:44:56,845
You aren't interested at all!

1286
00:44:56,846 --> 00:44:59,685
- I am not... - You are not really into it, no?

1287
00:44:59,686 --> 00:45:01,016
No, actually.

1288
00:45:03,556 --> 00:45:05,956
(By the way, )

1289
00:45:07,026 --> 00:45:08,055
I want to buy this one.

1290
00:45:08,056 --> 00:45:10,196
(what has he found?)

1291
00:45:10,796 --> 00:45:11,796
What's that?

1292
00:45:12,996 --> 00:45:14,036
This is pretty strange.

1293
00:45:14,596 --> 00:45:15,605
I need to buy this one.

1294
00:45:15,606 --> 00:45:16,606
(I need to buy a cereal.)

1295
00:45:16,607 --> 00:45:18,236
Oh, the only thing he picked up is...

1296
00:45:19,206 --> 00:45:21,726
- I didn't know you liked it. - I always like something to eat.

1297
00:45:21,846 --> 00:45:24,345
- I'll buy this for you. - No, please.

1298
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:25,506
Don't refuse it! I'll buy it.

1299
00:45:25,916 --> 00:45:28,245
- Stay there. - I didn't mean it.

1300
00:45:28,246 --> 00:45:29,446
I know.

1301
00:45:29,816 --> 00:45:32,386
(Thankful)

1302
00:45:33,916 --> 00:45:35,655
I can definitely buy that for you.

1303
00:45:35,656 --> 00:45:36,802
(He's embarrassed by his surprise.)

1304
00:45:36,826 --> 00:45:37,985
Did he buy something for you?

1305
00:45:37,986 --> 00:45:40,856
I just wanted to try later.

1306
00:45:40,956 --> 00:45:43,826
He wasn't interested in anything, but after seeing this cereal...

1307
00:45:43,996 --> 00:45:45,565
(He suddenly became enthusiastic.)

1308
00:45:45,566 --> 00:45:47,695
Actually, since I entered the store...

1309
00:45:47,696 --> 00:45:49,366
- Oh, really? - Take it!

1310
00:45:50,506 --> 00:45:53,175
- Jae Seok opened his wallet. - He did.

1311
00:45:53,176 --> 00:45:54,205
Thank you.

1312
00:45:54,206 --> 00:45:55,946
Jae Seok, what about my Supreme?

1313
00:45:56,176 --> 00:45:58,616
Oh, it's closed now. Sorry.

1314
00:45:58,916 --> 00:45:59,946
(Laughing)

1315
00:46:00,516 --> 00:46:01,615
(Failed to get Jae Seok to pay again)

1316
00:46:01,616 --> 00:46:02,616
Thank you.

1317
00:46:02,986 --> 00:46:05,086
Dong Yoon made me laugh a lot.

1318
00:46:05,386 --> 00:46:07,716
- He has his own preferences. - Indeed.

1319
00:46:07,816 --> 00:46:10,686
Mimi, don't start with the expensive ones.

1320
00:46:10,926 --> 00:46:13,225
- Build up with small ones. - Yes. With small ones.

1321
00:46:13,226 --> 00:46:14,595
- She saw only that one. - Right.

1322
00:46:14,596 --> 00:46:15,926
"This is so pretty!"

1323
00:46:16,026 --> 00:46:17,226
"Oh, this brand..."

1324
00:46:17,726 --> 00:46:19,836
- Was it a voice imitation of her? - Yes, it was.

1325
00:46:20,896 --> 00:46:23,435
- "This is pretty! Oh, this one..." - "Oh, Supreme!"

1326
00:46:23,436 --> 00:46:24,876
(The endless voice imitation of her)

1327
00:46:25,136 --> 00:46:26,206
I feel so ashamed.

1328
00:46:27,706 --> 00:46:30,605
But I know that feeling. When I was her age, I loved the brand items.

1329
00:46:30,606 --> 00:46:32,876
Yes, the time when we only bought expensive ones.

1330
00:46:33,216 --> 00:46:35,345
- This place is very popular too. - This is...

1331
00:46:35,346 --> 00:46:36,985
This place is also a franchise.

1332
00:46:36,986 --> 00:46:39,516
- Oh, then let's go here. - Let's go inside. We can't miss it.

1333
00:46:39,956 --> 00:46:42,426
We can't simply pass it.

1334
00:46:42,526 --> 00:46:43,825
Welcome.

1335
00:46:43,826 --> 00:46:44,886
(Welcome.)

1336
00:46:46,126 --> 00:46:48,596
I really want to try something in here.

1337
00:46:49,219 --> 00:46:52,519
We can't simply pass it.

1338
00:46:52,649 --> 00:46:53,988
Welcome.

1339
00:46:53,989 --> 00:46:55,019
(Welcome.)

1340
00:46:56,289 --> 00:46:58,789
I really want to try something in here.

1341
00:46:59,289 --> 00:47:01,289
(As soon as entering, )

1342
00:47:02,199 --> 00:47:03,199
(they see the unique concept of croissants.)

1343
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,799
This place is so popular, isn't it?

1344
00:47:05,699 --> 00:47:06,699
(A gigantic croissant)

1345
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:07,699
It's amazing.

1346
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:08,938
(This dessert shop is established...)

1347
00:47:08,939 --> 00:47:09,998
Everything looks so yummy.

1348
00:47:09,999 --> 00:47:12,369
(by a fashion company.)

1349
00:47:13,109 --> 00:47:15,578
(The unique design is its signature.)

1350
00:47:15,579 --> 00:47:17,339
This one is so good, you know?

1351
00:47:17,579 --> 00:47:19,309
(It paid homage to the contemporary art.)

1352
00:47:19,749 --> 00:47:22,779
(The place grafted visual arts into its concept.)

1353
00:47:23,679 --> 00:47:25,348
I should often come to places like this.

1354
00:47:25,349 --> 00:47:26,849
(He still wants to feel hip.)

1355
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:29,418
- My house is not far from here. - That's right.

1356
00:47:29,419 --> 00:47:30,739
Then, let's go to your place now.

1357
00:47:31,059 --> 00:47:32,759
(In a pickle)

1358
00:47:32,929 --> 00:47:35,159
Do you want to see branded items in his place?

1359
00:47:35,859 --> 00:47:37,359
It must be fun.

1360
00:47:37,829 --> 00:47:40,199
(Let's finish the City Tour first.)

1361
00:47:40,499 --> 00:47:41,619
What would you like to have?

1362
00:47:42,069 --> 00:47:44,099
I want to try a lot of things.

1363
00:47:44,299 --> 00:47:46,339
First, let's try the most popular one over there.

1364
00:47:46,439 --> 00:47:47,469
- This one? - Yes.

1365
00:47:47,509 --> 00:47:50,939
(The signature menu of this place, the black bread full of cream)

1366
00:47:51,309 --> 00:47:56,679
(Peak Cake, filled with ink pastry cream)

1367
00:47:57,579 --> 00:48:00,179
(With its unique design, it became very popular on social media.)

1368
00:48:00,649 --> 00:48:02,118
This is the most popular one.

1369
00:48:02,119 --> 00:48:04,259
I think I've seen this a lot. I've seen this...

1370
00:48:04,919 --> 00:48:07,429
Oh, I can't take it off?

1371
00:48:07,529 --> 00:48:08,898
(It's not moving)

1372
00:48:08,899 --> 00:48:10,758
- Seriously. - It's a model.

1373
00:48:10,759 --> 00:48:11,799
Oh, this one...

1374
00:48:12,399 --> 00:48:13,428
It's a model?

1375
00:48:13,429 --> 00:48:14,429
(It's a model?)

1376
00:48:14,669 --> 00:48:16,109
He didn't know that and continued...

1377
00:48:16,439 --> 00:48:17,439
(It tricked him.)

1378
00:48:18,909 --> 00:48:21,008
- What do we do? - Then we don't need to use this.

1379
00:48:21,009 --> 00:48:23,339
Oh, it says "Ask at the checkout if you want to buy."

1380
00:48:23,679 --> 00:48:25,079
"Only the items written as models."

1381
00:48:25,209 --> 00:48:26,679
This is the signature menu, right?

1382
00:48:27,209 --> 00:48:29,118
"This is the signature menu, right?"

1383
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:30,319
(Another voice imitation)

1384
00:48:31,479 --> 00:48:33,648
Maybe she doesn't want to talk anymore.

1385
00:48:33,649 --> 00:48:36,258
- I'm not good at it. You know? - I know.

1386
00:48:36,259 --> 00:48:38,688
- But I can. At least Mimi's. - Yes, you're pretty good now.

1387
00:48:38,689 --> 00:48:40,659
- It means he's taking care of you. - I know.

1388
00:48:40,859 --> 00:48:42,458
"This is the signature menu, right?"

1389
00:48:42,459 --> 00:48:44,099
(She lost her head due to his imitation.)

1390
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:45,598
Oh, thanks.

1391
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:48,799
(The coffee you ordered is ready.)

1392
00:48:49,499 --> 00:48:50,938
Let's have a cup of coffee and croissant...

1393
00:48:50,939 --> 00:48:52,438
- like a New Yorker. - Let's do that!

1394
00:48:52,439 --> 00:48:53,608
- That's nice. What do you think? - Okay.

1395
00:48:53,609 --> 00:48:55,329
- Yes, on the street! - Sounds good, right?

1396
00:48:55,879 --> 00:48:58,239
(The matcha scented cream is overflowing like a waterfall.)

1397
00:48:58,579 --> 00:49:01,779
(Shall we enjoy the sweetness together?)

1398
00:49:02,849 --> 00:49:04,879
(Crunching)

1399
00:49:06,389 --> 00:49:07,449
(Amazed)

1400
00:49:07,649 --> 00:49:08,688
Try it.

1401
00:49:08,689 --> 00:49:11,558
(She sips the Cro-choco latte.)

1402
00:49:11,559 --> 00:49:12,559
It's nice, isn't it?

1403
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,459
They poured Nutella on it.

1404
00:49:14,959 --> 00:49:16,459
Oh, it's so good!

1405
00:49:17,559 --> 00:49:18,829
It's like a chocolate soup.

1406
00:49:19,169 --> 00:49:21,169
This is so deep!

1407
00:49:21,529 --> 00:49:23,268
- Shall we move now? - Let's go!

1408
00:49:23,269 --> 00:49:24,769
(Now it's time to move out.)

1409
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:27,538
Where are we supposed to go next?

1410
00:49:27,539 --> 00:49:30,039
- It's "nonsense chef." - "Nonsense chef?"

1411
00:49:30,309 --> 00:49:31,509
Why is he called nonsense?

1412
00:49:32,449 --> 00:49:33,809
That's what I wonder.

1413
00:49:36,949 --> 00:49:38,279
You speak in a strange way.

1414
00:49:38,789 --> 00:49:40,349
- "That's what I wonder." - "I wonder."

1415
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,719
I wanted to say I wonder about that too.

1416
00:49:43,059 --> 00:49:44,488
- I just said it that way. - "I wonder too."

1417
00:49:44,489 --> 00:49:45,788
That's what you wanted, right?

1418
00:49:45,789 --> 00:49:47,159
Oh, that's right!

1419
00:49:47,659 --> 00:49:49,129
(He never yields.)

1420
00:49:49,699 --> 00:49:50,829
ZINGER was...

1421
00:49:52,229 --> 00:49:54,569
It was not natural.

1422
00:49:54,669 --> 00:49:56,569
We can't say ZINGER is not real.

1423
00:49:57,139 --> 00:49:58,419
- Oh, gosh. - Was it your rhyme?

1424
00:49:58,909 --> 00:50:01,109
(We thought it was the lyrics of a rap song.)

1425
00:50:01,269 --> 00:50:03,739
- He's good at dad jokes. - We can't just one by its look.

1426
00:50:03,879 --> 00:50:05,908
Mimi suddenly lost her interest in him.

1427
00:50:05,909 --> 00:50:06,948
It dropped drastically.

1428
00:50:06,949 --> 00:50:07,978
(Mimi lost her interest in him.)

1429
00:50:07,979 --> 00:50:10,319
Mimi's somewhat old-school.

1430
00:50:10,419 --> 00:50:12,318
(Mimi's somewhat old-school.)

1431
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:13,748
Are you in the same group...

1432
00:50:13,749 --> 00:50:14,789
- with Seunghee? - Yes.

1433
00:50:14,889 --> 00:50:16,388
- Right? - Yes. Oh My Girl.

1434
00:50:16,389 --> 00:50:17,488
I filmed with her.

1435
00:50:17,489 --> 00:50:19,058
- Oh, really? - Yes, I did.

1436
00:50:19,059 --> 00:50:21,859
- She's filming "Oasis." - That's right.

1437
00:50:22,229 --> 00:50:23,958
What about you?

1438
00:50:23,959 --> 00:50:26,299
I really want to. But no one has given me a chance yet.

1439
00:50:26,529 --> 00:50:29,268
- What kind of role do you want? - Me?

1440
00:50:29,269 --> 00:50:30,349
Whatever they want from me.

1441
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:33,139
- Even historical dramas? - Sure. Why not?

1442
00:50:33,569 --> 00:50:36,738
- Even a court lady in a palace? - You mean a maid?

1443
00:50:36,739 --> 00:50:37,779
Sure!

1444
00:50:37,979 --> 00:50:40,809
With short and quick steps. "Yes, Your Majesty."

1445
00:50:41,209 --> 00:50:44,318
When we think of historical dramas,

1446
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:46,419
I don't think she'll have a high status.

1447
00:50:48,089 --> 00:50:49,958
Honestly, let's be realistic.

1448
00:50:49,959 --> 00:50:51,679
You may wear straw shoes, not leather ones.

1449
00:50:52,329 --> 00:50:54,728
She should endure coldness when it's cold.

1450
00:50:54,729 --> 00:50:55,999
Then, she should layer up!

1451
00:50:56,459 --> 00:50:59,329
(Please give me a chance to act, directors!)

1452
00:50:59,729 --> 00:51:00,829
How about that?

1453
00:51:00,929 --> 00:51:03,368
An envoy from a foreign country, with a high status.

1454
00:51:03,369 --> 00:51:06,038
- That sounds not bad! - I think you can do that!

1455
00:51:06,039 --> 00:51:08,408
- You look a bit exotic. - Yes.

1456
00:51:08,409 --> 00:51:10,308
Back then, merchants traded a lot internationally.

1457
00:51:10,309 --> 00:51:13,108
That sounds cool. "It's my pleasure to see you."

1458
00:51:13,109 --> 00:51:15,448
You sound like Dong Yeob.

1459
00:51:15,449 --> 00:51:17,955
- "It's my pleasure to see you." - "It's my pleasure to see you."

1460
00:51:17,979 --> 00:51:19,465
What kind of songs do you like to sing?

1461
00:51:19,489 --> 00:51:21,218
- Me? I like... - Like ballads?

1462
00:51:21,219 --> 00:51:22,859
I'm a rapper.

1463
00:51:23,219 --> 00:51:25,159
(Oh, I see.)

1464
00:51:25,659 --> 00:51:26,929
He seems a bit flustered.

1465
00:51:27,229 --> 00:51:28,529
- No. - As I see...

1466
00:51:28,759 --> 00:51:31,158
He didn't get anything right. He mentioned a ballad.

1467
00:51:31,159 --> 00:51:32,728
He only knows me as a friend of Seunghee.

1468
00:51:32,729 --> 00:51:34,968
He failed to guess you were a rapper too.

1469
00:51:34,969 --> 00:51:37,199
You two stop talking until we arrive.

1470
00:51:38,469 --> 00:51:40,209
- That's better, right? - Yes.

1471
00:51:40,509 --> 00:51:42,638
They shouldn't chat anymore.

1472
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:44,038
(The distance between them drifted apart even further.)

1473
00:51:44,039 --> 00:51:46,678
- Is this our destination? - I see many office buildings.

1474
00:51:46,679 --> 00:51:47,708
Thank you.

1475
00:51:47,709 --> 00:51:49,449
(They soon arrived at the next hot place.)

1476
00:51:49,819 --> 00:51:51,848
- Oh, this place is... - It's an office place!

1477
00:51:51,849 --> 00:51:54,819
I feel the vibe. It's like a town for banks.

1478
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:56,619
"A town for banks?"

1479
00:51:57,819 --> 00:51:59,829
There are many banks and real estate dealers.

1480
00:51:59,929 --> 00:52:01,228
(This is Cheongdam-dong where many skyscrapers are.)

1481
00:52:01,229 --> 00:52:02,499
They're just office buildings.

1482
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:05,968
(Then, where is "nonsense chef?")

1483
00:52:05,969 --> 00:52:07,029
This is not real.

1484
00:52:07,569 --> 00:52:08,598
This is not real.

1485
00:52:08,599 --> 00:52:10,599
(This is not real?)

1486
00:52:10,769 --> 00:52:11,769
Based on what...

1487
00:52:12,239 --> 00:52:13,838
- I just felt it. - Oh, you did?

1488
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:15,159
(The sense of an experienced one)

1489
00:52:15,409 --> 00:52:16,809
This may be it.

1490
00:52:17,709 --> 00:52:19,949
- There's something underground? - This is it, isn't it?

1491
00:52:19,979 --> 00:52:21,225
(They found the second trending place.)

1492
00:52:21,249 --> 00:52:23,948
- On the basement floor. - This may be it!

1493
00:52:23,949 --> 00:52:24,979
Oh, there's an entrance.

1494
00:52:26,349 --> 00:52:28,149
This is it. We should enter the password.

1495
00:52:29,589 --> 00:52:32,489
(A mysterious guy is waiting...)

1496
00:52:32,959 --> 00:52:34,829
- Shall we go in? - Oh, it's opening.

1497
00:52:36,799 --> 00:52:37,799
- Welcome! - Hello!

1498
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,398
(for the members of Sixth Sense.)

1499
00:52:39,399 --> 00:52:40,969
- Hello. - Hello.

1500
00:52:41,399 --> 00:52:42,539
- Oh, that is... - No way.

1501
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:46,709
- Why? You know him? - He's one of our comedian juniors.

1502
00:52:47,209 --> 00:52:48,209
No?

1503
00:52:49,879 --> 00:52:52,549
(We've never seen him before.)

1504
00:52:53,279 --> 00:52:55,749
(Does Jae Seok know him?)

1505
00:52:55,979 --> 00:52:58,719
- The one who does nonsense gags. - Oh, my!

1506
00:53:01,089 --> 00:53:02,149
Yes.

1507
00:53:03,719 --> 00:53:06,059
- It's Jin Hwan! - Oh, my.

1508
00:53:06,159 --> 00:53:07,289
- Oh, my. - Yes, it's me.

1509
00:53:07,389 --> 00:53:09,299
- It's you, right? - Yes.

1510
00:53:09,499 --> 00:53:11,099
- Oh, my. - Jin Hwan. What are you...

1511
00:53:11,659 --> 00:53:12,729
Why are you...

1512
00:53:13,529 --> 00:53:14,898
- It's him! - Yes, Eun I.

1513
00:53:14,899 --> 00:53:17,039
- Long time no see. - That nonsense gag...

1514
00:53:17,739 --> 00:53:19,438
- Hello. - He was with Hun Su.

1515
00:53:19,439 --> 00:53:22,208
- The nonsense gag with Hun Su. - That's right.

1516
00:53:22,209 --> 00:53:24,779
(The one who did nonsense gag with Son Hun Su)

1517
00:53:25,479 --> 00:53:27,278
(He debuted...)

1518
00:53:27,279 --> 00:53:29,119
(as an open-recruit comedian at MBC.)

1519
00:53:29,379 --> 00:53:30,949
(- Does that make sense? - Yes!)

1520
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:34,088
(- Who do you like the most? - My mom.)

1521
00:53:34,089 --> 00:53:35,118
(Oh, I see.)

1522
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:37,489
I worked as a comedian for about six years.

1523
00:53:38,459 --> 00:53:40,088
(2001 Baeksang Arts Awards for Most Popular Talent...)

1524
00:53:40,089 --> 00:53:41,659
("Nonsense Comedy Team")

1525
00:53:41,859 --> 00:53:43,139
(From a natural-born comedian, )

1526
00:53:43,199 --> 00:53:44,528
(he has returned as a chef.)

1527
00:53:44,529 --> 00:53:46,298
I have given up being a comedian...

1528
00:53:46,299 --> 00:53:49,069
and I run a high-end omakase restaurant now.

1529
00:53:49,639 --> 00:53:52,738
(High-end Omakase: A compound word of the high-end...)

1530
00:53:52,739 --> 00:53:54,338
(and entrusted service, a restaurant where the best ingredients are...)

1531
00:53:54,339 --> 00:53:55,939
(cooked by a highly skilled chef)

1532
00:53:56,339 --> 00:54:00,278
I've been running an omakase restaurant for 15 years.

1533
00:54:00,279 --> 00:54:02,525
(Chef with 15 years of experience in running a Japanese omakase)

1534
00:54:02,549 --> 00:54:03,918
As it is high-end,

1535
00:54:03,919 --> 00:54:06,918
in order to serve the best meals,

1536
00:54:06,919 --> 00:54:09,359
we operate on a 100 percent reservation system.

1537
00:54:09,619 --> 00:54:13,758
Noryangjin Fisheries Wholesale Market opens at 3am every day.

1538
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:15,558
I came to Noryangjin...

1539
00:54:15,559 --> 00:54:17,929
for tomorrow's business.

1540
00:54:18,459 --> 00:54:19,529
How much is this?

1541
00:54:19,629 --> 00:54:21,669
- It's 35 dollars. - It's 35 dollars?

1542
00:54:22,669 --> 00:54:25,339
You have to do a lot of legwork in Noryangjin.

1543
00:54:25,499 --> 00:54:28,168
I personally go and select the best ingredients...

1544
00:54:28,169 --> 00:54:29,639
and run the restaurant.

1545
00:54:30,039 --> 00:54:32,879
I think water is very important as well.

1546
00:54:33,279 --> 00:54:35,879
It is one of the world's top three mineral waters,

1547
00:54:36,279 --> 00:54:38,919
Chojeong mineral water.

1548
00:54:39,289 --> 00:54:41,688
I get a supply of water...

1549
00:54:41,689 --> 00:54:43,819
from Chojeong Haenggung Palace every ten days.

1550
00:54:45,189 --> 00:54:49,128
(From water to ingredients...)

1551
00:54:49,129 --> 00:54:51,099
(they are the best quality.)

1552
00:54:51,399 --> 00:54:55,869
Now, our monthly sales are at 18,000 to 20,000 dollars.

1553
00:54:55,939 --> 00:54:57,338
(Average rating from 35 reviews)

1554
00:54:57,339 --> 00:54:59,569
(4.9 points out of 5)

1555
00:55:00,369 --> 00:55:02,208
(With all kinds of precious ingredients from the sea...)

1556
00:55:02,209 --> 00:55:04,079
Our customers really enjoy it.

1557
00:55:04,479 --> 00:55:06,349
And their responses are quite good.

1558
00:55:07,579 --> 00:55:08,949
Sixth Sense members,

1559
00:55:09,349 --> 00:55:11,248
am I real?

1560
00:55:11,249 --> 00:55:13,549
(Sixth Sense members, am I real?)

1561
00:55:13,949 --> 00:55:15,858
- Yes, that's right. - Jin Hwan.

1562
00:55:15,859 --> 00:55:16,859
Yes.

1563
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:18,188
You recognized me right away.

1564
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:19,658
Of course.

1565
00:55:19,659 --> 00:55:21,358
- I gained a lot of weight. - That's right.

1566
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,428
But you look the same.

1567
00:55:23,429 --> 00:55:26,298
Wait. It's Jin Hwan.

1568
00:55:26,299 --> 00:55:28,498
Seriously. It's been a while.

1569
00:55:28,499 --> 00:55:29,998
Yes. How have you been?

1570
00:55:29,999 --> 00:55:31,839
I've been really well.

1571
00:55:32,909 --> 00:55:34,238
First, it was ZINGER.

1572
00:55:34,239 --> 00:55:36,409
- This time, it's Jin Hwan. - Exactly.

1573
00:55:36,779 --> 00:55:39,109
Seriously. Why are you here?

1574
00:55:39,849 --> 00:55:41,148
It's been a long time. Really.

1575
00:55:41,149 --> 00:55:42,678
It's been really long.

1576
00:55:42,679 --> 00:55:44,048
- I think it's been about 17 years. - Exactly.

1577
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:45,578
It's been almost 20 years.

1578
00:55:45,579 --> 00:55:47,748
Do you know nonsense comedy?

1579
00:55:47,749 --> 00:55:49,518
Yes, I do. It was on MBC before.

1580
00:55:49,519 --> 00:55:51,088
- Yes, it was. - That's it.

1581
00:55:51,089 --> 00:55:52,288
What is it?

1582
00:55:52,289 --> 00:55:54,228
- Mimi, you don't know it, right? - No.

1583
00:55:54,229 --> 00:55:56,628
It was really popular back then.

1584
00:55:56,629 --> 00:55:58,028
(Embarrassed)

1585
00:55:58,029 --> 00:56:00,899
Then, since when did you do this? Are you running this restaurant now?

1586
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:04,939
Yes, it's been about 15 to 16 years since I ran the restaurant.

1587
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:06,939
He's been doing this long.

1588
00:56:07,139 --> 00:56:10,408
Then, did you change your career to become a chef?

1589
00:56:10,409 --> 00:56:11,838
Yes, I have.

1590
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:13,278
The reason I started a restaurant...

1591
00:56:13,279 --> 00:56:15,249
after being on TV was...

1592
00:56:15,409 --> 00:56:18,449
because there was no place that would call me.

1593
00:56:18,649 --> 00:56:20,389
- Right. - And then...

1594
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:23,859
(After six years of working as a comedian)

1595
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:28,189
Work on TV got cut off at some point.

1596
00:56:28,489 --> 00:56:30,898
So I took all the money I had...

1597
00:56:30,899 --> 00:56:33,598
and opened a small street stall.

1598
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:35,839
And as for Japanese cuisine, my hobby was fishing.

1599
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:38,868
But rather than showing a clumsy side,

1600
00:56:38,869 --> 00:56:41,669
I wanted to show people a great side.

1601
00:56:41,969 --> 00:56:44,408
Since then, my cooking skills have improved a lot.

1602
00:56:44,409 --> 00:56:45,409
(Cooking skills gained from running a street stall)

1603
00:56:45,410 --> 00:56:47,449
I started off with a street stall first...

1604
00:56:47,709 --> 00:56:49,549
then moved up as a mid-level omakase...

1605
00:56:49,649 --> 00:56:51,578
and now I've moved up to a high-end omakase restaurant.

1606
00:56:51,579 --> 00:56:52,588
Right.

1607
00:56:52,589 --> 00:56:55,248
I think I've heard that you ran a street stall.

1608
00:56:55,249 --> 00:56:56,319
Right.

1609
00:56:56,389 --> 00:56:57,688
We talked about visiting to eat there...

1610
00:56:57,689 --> 00:56:59,829
but that was a long time ago.

1611
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:02,699
But I haven't heard that you were running this recently.

1612
00:57:03,059 --> 00:57:05,558
(From a street stall to omakase restaurant, is this real?)

1613
00:57:05,559 --> 00:57:08,268
Then how much is it for one person?

1614
00:57:08,269 --> 00:57:10,868
It is 270 dollars per person.

1615
00:57:10,869 --> 00:57:13,339
(Their dinner is 270 dollars per person.)

1616
00:57:13,739 --> 00:57:15,909
- What? - It's really high-end.

1617
00:57:16,709 --> 00:57:20,749
The course usually runs for 2 to 3 hours.

1618
00:57:21,879 --> 00:57:23,218
(Salmon roe and sea urchin rice bowl)

1619
00:57:23,219 --> 00:57:25,318
Since it is high-end,

1620
00:57:25,319 --> 00:57:27,348
I usually use seasonal ingredients.

1621
00:57:27,349 --> 00:57:28,788
Spring, summer, fall, and winter,

1622
00:57:28,789 --> 00:57:31,258
fish, vegetables, and then grains.

1623
00:57:31,259 --> 00:57:32,929
I usually go with seasonal ingredients.

1624
00:57:34,759 --> 00:57:38,899
(Sliced Raw Puffer Fish)

1625
00:57:42,029 --> 00:57:44,839
(Course meal made with 20 different seasonal seafood)

1626
00:57:45,139 --> 00:57:46,938
- If you use good materials... - Right.

1627
00:57:46,939 --> 00:57:48,368
- and make high-quality products, - Right.

1628
00:57:48,369 --> 00:57:50,708
You will have to price it a bit higher.

1629
00:57:50,709 --> 00:57:54,809
(High-quality course meal that changes every day)

1630
00:57:54,909 --> 00:57:56,878
And if it looks like it's not enough,

1631
00:57:56,879 --> 00:57:59,149
I give everything. Anything.

1632
00:57:59,449 --> 00:58:01,248
(Additional portion for all foods is available.)

1633
00:58:01,249 --> 00:58:04,419
I usually open around 6:30pm.

1634
00:58:04,589 --> 00:58:07,158
I had a customer who left at 2am.

1635
00:58:07,159 --> 00:58:08,359
- At 2am? - What?

1636
00:58:08,529 --> 00:58:10,299
You can eat until the end.

1637
00:58:10,859 --> 00:58:13,368
That must be a lot of food, then.

1638
00:58:13,369 --> 00:58:14,898
- But it's an office area. - Then you can understand...

1639
00:58:14,899 --> 00:58:16,398
- why it is 270 dollars. - Right.

1640
00:58:16,399 --> 00:58:18,098
- Today, I'll serve compactly. - Yes.

1641
00:58:18,099 --> 00:58:20,409
- And serve simply. - Yes.

1642
00:58:20,709 --> 00:58:22,108
I think it's my first time trying an omakase meal.

1643
00:58:22,109 --> 00:58:23,379
- Really? - Yes.

1644
00:58:23,639 --> 00:58:25,808
- Can we ask you to serve us then? - Yes.

1645
00:58:25,809 --> 00:58:27,649
Yes. Let me start.

1646
00:58:28,579 --> 00:58:29,648
First...

1647
00:58:29,649 --> 00:58:30,849
(To start off the course meal)

1648
00:58:31,249 --> 00:58:32,748
It is hot. Please be careful.

1649
00:58:32,749 --> 00:58:36,088
(What is the hot appetizer taken out from the steamer?)

1650
00:58:36,089 --> 00:58:38,618
- It's warm. - It is.

1651
00:58:38,619 --> 00:58:40,189
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1652
00:58:40,789 --> 00:58:41,789
(What is this food?)

1653
00:58:41,790 --> 00:58:43,059
It is steamed eggs.

1654
00:58:43,499 --> 00:58:44,558
It looks like a pudding.

1655
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:46,269
(It is the steamed eggs.)

1656
00:58:46,869 --> 00:58:50,199
For eggs, I use free-range eggs.

1657
00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:54,338
I use these eggs because I want to...

1658
00:58:54,339 --> 00:58:56,079
provide eggs that are nutritious.

1659
00:58:57,939 --> 00:58:59,648
The point of this steamed eggs is...

1660
00:58:59,649 --> 00:59:03,119
that it disappears as soon as you put it in your mouth.

1661
00:59:03,379 --> 00:59:05,578
I strain the eggs more than twice through a sieve...

1662
00:59:05,579 --> 00:59:09,189
and try to keep the softest texture as much as possible.

1663
00:59:09,589 --> 00:59:11,388
And I add in seasonal seafood...

1664
00:59:11,389 --> 00:59:13,159
to make the taste and texture better.

1665
00:59:13,889 --> 00:59:17,799
I finish it by steaming it in the steamer for 13 minutes.

1666
00:59:18,029 --> 00:59:19,228
(Even the appetizer is different.)

1667
00:59:19,229 --> 00:59:20,368
This is steamed eggs.

1668
00:59:20,369 --> 00:59:22,398
And there is shrimp inside.

1669
00:59:22,399 --> 00:59:24,299
(Shrimp steamed eggs to raise the appetite)

1670
00:59:24,539 --> 00:59:25,639
It looks good.

1671
00:59:26,109 --> 00:59:27,869
Something that's served in expensive places.

1672
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:31,079
(Exclaiming)

1673
00:59:31,179 --> 00:59:32,209
It's good.

1674
00:59:32,909 --> 00:59:35,009
(It disappears as soon as you put it in the mouth.)

1675
00:59:35,979 --> 00:59:37,119
It's delicious.

1676
00:59:39,689 --> 00:59:40,888
Experience.

1677
00:59:40,889 --> 00:59:41,925
(First omakase experience)

1678
00:59:41,949 --> 00:59:43,158
(Gazing)

1679
00:59:43,159 --> 00:59:44,388
What fish is it?

1680
00:59:44,389 --> 00:59:47,088
This fish is called spotted parrot fish.

1681
00:59:47,089 --> 00:59:48,788
- Gosh. - A sea bream.

1682
00:59:48,789 --> 00:59:51,398
The spotted parrot fish belongs to the rock bream family...

1683
00:59:51,399 --> 00:59:52,928
and has a leopard print.

1684
00:59:52,929 --> 00:59:54,345
(Spotted parrot fish: A high-quality fish in the rock bream family)

1685
00:59:54,369 --> 00:59:56,799
It is not an easy fish to get a hold of.

1686
00:59:57,899 --> 00:59:59,938
So, because this is high-end,

1687
00:59:59,939 --> 01:00:03,738
I try my best to use fish that are as special and unique as possible.

1688
01:00:03,739 --> 01:00:05,438
(Tasty as it feeds on high-quality seafood like abalone and sea urchin)

1689
01:00:05,439 --> 01:00:07,109
(Has chewy texture)

1690
01:00:07,409 --> 01:00:09,448
I use it after maturing it.

1691
01:00:09,449 --> 01:00:11,919
You can feel a lot of softness.

1692
01:00:12,619 --> 01:00:14,388
- But the skin is... - Yes.

1693
01:00:14,389 --> 01:00:15,488
- amazing. - Isn't that neat?

1694
01:00:15,489 --> 01:00:17,059
Isn't he doing it really neatly?

1695
01:00:18,059 --> 01:00:20,228
To talk about skinning skills,

1696
01:00:20,229 --> 01:00:23,329
I have more than 15 years of experience.

1697
01:00:23,699 --> 01:00:26,398
So I don't fall behind others.

1698
01:00:26,399 --> 01:00:27,745
(Perfect separation of skin and meat)

1699
01:00:27,769 --> 01:00:30,668
There is no meat on the skin.

1700
01:00:30,669 --> 01:00:32,198
If it's that level of detail,

1701
01:00:32,199 --> 01:00:35,709
- that's quite professional. - Right.

1702
01:00:35,939 --> 01:00:38,478
Among people who enjoy fishing,

1703
01:00:38,479 --> 01:00:41,008
are there those who can prepare fish that well?

1704
01:00:41,009 --> 01:00:43,218
There are, but they can't skin it that well.

1705
01:00:43,219 --> 01:00:45,218
It won't separate that neatly.

1706
01:00:45,219 --> 01:00:47,288
Recently, I saw KCM, who enjoys fishing...

1707
01:00:47,289 --> 01:00:48,948
- and can prepare raw fish. - That's right.

1708
01:00:48,949 --> 01:00:51,319
- His skills aren't at this level. - Right.

1709
01:00:52,159 --> 01:00:54,458
(Is this the skill of a Japanese cuisine master?)

1710
01:00:54,459 --> 01:00:58,259
It means that he has some level of skill and experience.

1711
01:01:00,629 --> 01:01:02,799
(First course meal)

1712
01:01:03,469 --> 01:01:05,368
(Aged raw spotted parrot fish)

1713
01:01:05,369 --> 01:01:06,369
It looks delicious.

1714
01:01:06,909 --> 01:01:09,539
(Fixing the gaze on the chef's hands)

1715
01:01:09,639 --> 01:01:11,138
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1716
01:01:11,139 --> 01:01:14,279
The most important is the natural taste of the food.

1717
01:01:14,579 --> 01:01:16,395
So you should have the first bite with salt only.

1718
01:01:16,419 --> 01:01:18,578
- Right. - To taste the natural taste...

1719
01:01:18,579 --> 01:01:21,518
try with salt only and chew carefully.

1720
01:01:21,519 --> 01:01:23,418
Jae Seok wanted to dip it in soy sauce.

1721
01:01:23,419 --> 01:01:25,219
I always go with this, no matter what.

1722
01:01:25,859 --> 01:01:27,488
(Dipping in salt as per the chef's recommendation)

1723
01:01:27,489 --> 01:01:28,928
If you chew it a little bit,

1724
01:01:28,929 --> 01:01:31,358
you can taste the savory taste...

1725
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:33,768
or the sweetness of the fish.

1726
01:01:33,769 --> 01:01:35,028
It's delicious.

1727
01:01:35,029 --> 01:01:36,039
It's good.

1728
01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:38,869
Aged raw fish is always good.

1729
01:01:39,669 --> 01:01:41,208
(It raised the savory taste and flavor of the organic fish.)

1730
01:01:41,209 --> 01:01:42,209
It's nice.

1731
01:01:42,369 --> 01:01:43,609
The raw fish is really good.

1732
01:01:45,009 --> 01:01:48,009
The sauce is good too. This thick kelp sauce is good.

1733
01:01:48,509 --> 01:01:49,848
(What does Kochelin Kyoung Pyo think?)

1734
01:01:49,849 --> 01:01:50,849
It's good.

1735
01:01:51,179 --> 01:01:53,339
(He expresses the deliciousness with his entire body.)

1736
01:01:54,389 --> 01:01:55,748
(The perfect taste of aged spotted parrot fish)

1737
01:01:55,749 --> 01:01:56,888
The fish is really good.

1738
01:01:56,889 --> 01:01:58,119
It's good.

1739
01:01:58,689 --> 01:01:59,689
It's delicious.

1740
01:01:59,690 --> 01:02:03,599
(The aged raw fish tastes perfect. Then is this place real?)

1741
01:02:03,929 --> 01:02:05,858
Does everyone like raw fish?

1742
01:02:05,859 --> 01:02:08,568
- Yes, I eat raw fish well. - Yes.

1743
01:02:08,569 --> 01:02:11,598
Do you know how good the fish is?

1744
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:14,038
No, I can't tell.

1745
01:02:14,039 --> 01:02:16,839
But I like putting them in my mouth.

1746
01:02:17,539 --> 01:02:19,108
(Of course it's about eating.)

1747
01:02:19,109 --> 01:02:20,478
He's just good at eating.

1748
01:02:20,479 --> 01:02:22,048
Kyoung Pyo really likes eating.

1749
01:02:22,049 --> 01:02:23,418
He likes anything he can eat.

1750
01:02:23,419 --> 01:02:25,248
- My body isn't big from exercising. - Right.

1751
01:02:25,249 --> 01:02:26,589
(Bulked up from eating)

1752
01:02:26,849 --> 01:02:28,618
I only have bones and fat.

1753
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:30,139
(I only have bones and fat like fish.)

1754
01:02:30,259 --> 01:02:32,589
(What did he take out this time?)

1755
01:02:32,889 --> 01:02:34,328
The oysters are great.

1756
01:02:34,329 --> 01:02:36,559
(The oysters are great.)

1757
01:02:36,929 --> 01:02:38,929
This is called triploid oyster.

1758
01:02:39,529 --> 01:02:41,929
These are rare oysters...

1759
01:02:42,329 --> 01:02:43,869
that are only farmed in the South Sea.

1760
01:02:44,499 --> 01:02:49,039
The size of the triploid oysters is 3 to 5 times bigger than normal.

1761
01:02:49,639 --> 01:02:53,279
The price is 20 to 30 times more expensive.

1762
01:02:54,249 --> 01:02:55,508
As the oyster is big,

1763
01:02:55,509 --> 01:02:56,978
the flavor is strong,

1764
01:02:56,979 --> 01:02:58,778
and there is a difference in the sweetness.

1765
01:02:58,779 --> 01:03:00,718
(The flavor is deeper and sweeter.)

1766
01:03:00,719 --> 01:03:03,095
(It is rich in zinc and taurine, which helps increase male stamina.)

1767
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:04,958
To add a refreshing taste,

1768
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:09,129
I added Cheongyang chili peppers, basil, and shallots.

1769
01:03:09,729 --> 01:03:12,458
And I removed the stems and seeds from the tomatoes...

1770
01:03:12,459 --> 01:03:13,968
and simmered them for about two hours.

1771
01:03:13,969 --> 01:03:15,298
(Special oysters meet special sauce)

1772
01:03:15,299 --> 01:03:18,468
I sprinkle it lightly on top and serve it to the customers.

1773
01:03:18,469 --> 01:03:19,709
(Triploid Oyster)

1774
01:03:20,239 --> 01:03:22,309
(Enjoying the scent)

1775
01:03:22,809 --> 01:03:23,809
(Surprised)

1776
01:03:24,009 --> 01:03:25,108
(How does the triploid oyster taste?)

1777
01:03:25,109 --> 01:03:27,308
This is so good. It's really good.

1778
01:03:27,309 --> 01:03:29,408
- This raw fish is real. - Yes.

1779
01:03:29,409 --> 01:03:30,978
(Right up his alley)

1780
01:03:30,979 --> 01:03:32,918
- This is really delicious. - Yes, it is good.

1781
01:03:32,919 --> 01:03:34,388
- It's sour. - I only want to eat this.

1782
01:03:34,389 --> 01:03:36,218
I aimed for...

1783
01:03:36,219 --> 01:03:38,219
- It's like the tangy tomato sauce. - Right.

1784
01:03:38,489 --> 01:03:40,558
- It's tasty. - What?

1785
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:42,479
It tastes a bit like the pickled Japanese plums.

1786
01:03:42,759 --> 01:03:44,898
(Taking another bite)

1787
01:03:44,899 --> 01:03:46,269
It's so refreshing.

1788
01:03:47,369 --> 01:03:49,169
It tastes like cold pasta.

1789
01:03:49,899 --> 01:03:52,168
You successfully made the flavor.

1790
01:03:52,169 --> 01:03:54,038
- It doesn't taste fishy at all. - It's moderate.

1791
01:03:54,039 --> 01:03:55,208
It's just right.

1792
01:03:55,209 --> 01:03:58,039
Did you study in Japan?

1793
01:03:58,309 --> 01:03:59,478
(I was self-taught.)

1794
01:03:59,479 --> 01:04:01,948
I was self-taught.

1795
01:04:01,949 --> 01:04:05,579
I usually went to Japan to eat.

1796
01:04:06,019 --> 01:04:07,618
(Thinking)

1797
01:04:07,619 --> 01:04:09,449
(Right. To eat?)

1798
01:04:09,559 --> 01:04:12,119
- You went for sightseeing in Japan. - Yes.

1799
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:14,929
(It wasn't to study abroad but to go sightseeing.)

1800
01:04:15,029 --> 01:04:18,059
You beat around the bush.

1801
01:04:18,199 --> 01:04:21,069
You went sightseeing in Japan. And you didn't study there.

1802
01:04:21,269 --> 01:04:23,339
It feels like that one fact...

1803
01:04:23,469 --> 01:04:25,299
changes everything.

1804
01:04:26,209 --> 01:04:28,468
But to a chef, eating is studying.

1805
01:04:28,469 --> 01:04:30,439
- That's right. - You did study abroad, then.

1806
01:04:31,379 --> 01:04:33,849
(He suddenly works with the fire.)

1807
01:04:36,219 --> 01:04:38,919
(Is that rice straw that is burning?)

1808
01:04:41,619 --> 01:04:43,759
I see. It's eel grilled over rice straw.

1809
01:04:44,159 --> 01:04:46,929
(Right before your eyes, )

1810
01:04:47,489 --> 01:04:49,389
(an eel-grilling performance unfolds.)

1811
01:04:49,529 --> 01:04:51,529
Did you research about things like this too?

1812
01:04:51,899 --> 01:04:53,928
- I ate it and studied it. - Gosh.

1813
01:04:53,929 --> 01:04:55,298
How could you self-teach such a thing?

1814
01:04:55,299 --> 01:04:56,859
(The grilled eel he learned by himself)

1815
01:04:57,039 --> 01:05:02,769
(The eel is delivered from Lake Soyang and Chungju.)

1816
01:05:03,379 --> 01:05:08,778
(He prepares it while it's still alive for freshness.)

1817
01:05:08,779 --> 01:05:11,849
When I grill it for the first time, if the fire is strong,

1818
01:05:11,949 --> 01:05:14,649
I try to cover it with smoke as much as possible.

1819
01:05:15,149 --> 01:05:19,119
I put our special sauce on the eel...

1820
01:05:19,289 --> 01:05:20,429
while I grill it.

1821
01:05:20,589 --> 01:05:23,659
I grill it again to get the smoked flavor,

1822
01:05:23,899 --> 01:05:25,359
maximizing its flavors.

1823
01:05:26,059 --> 01:05:31,138
(Juicy grilled eel is ready.)

1824
01:05:31,139 --> 01:05:32,169
Here is the eel.

1825
01:05:32,269 --> 01:05:33,409
Thank you.

1826
01:05:35,109 --> 01:05:36,479
(Putting it in his mouth)

1827
01:05:37,379 --> 01:05:38,879
- Enjoy. - Gosh. It's so good.

1828
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:41,349
- Gosh. It's good. - Gosh. It's really good.

1829
01:05:41,849 --> 01:05:43,818
(Savoring...)

1830
01:05:43,819 --> 01:05:45,619
(the flavors)

1831
01:05:45,749 --> 01:05:48,018
(This is it.)

1832
01:05:48,019 --> 01:05:50,558
- It's gooey, chewy, and tasty. - It's so good.

1833
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:52,788
- It's crunchy. - Yet tender.

1834
01:05:52,789 --> 01:05:54,028
- Yes. It's tender. - Yes.

1835
01:05:54,029 --> 01:05:55,588
There's a reason why he put so much effort into it.

1836
01:05:55,589 --> 01:05:56,659
- Yes. - That's right.

1837
01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:59,205
One can't run an omakase restaurant unless they're confident.

1838
01:05:59,229 --> 01:06:03,338
Does it make the fish tastier when you use the rice straw?

1839
01:06:03,339 --> 01:06:04,638
Yes. The rice straw...

1840
01:06:04,639 --> 01:06:06,709
The freshwater eel has a unique smell to it.

1841
01:06:06,969 --> 01:06:08,109
The rice straw removes it.

1842
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:10,379
It also makes the texture as soft as possible.

1843
01:06:10,539 --> 01:06:13,349
That's why I go through the hard process.

1844
01:06:14,579 --> 01:06:20,349
(He has chosen the hard way for the best flavors.)

1845
01:06:20,619 --> 01:06:22,188
It just can't be fake.

1846
01:06:22,189 --> 01:06:24,519
- In fact, I... - Right. This can't be fake.

1847
01:06:24,889 --> 01:06:28,658
I'm not suspicious of Chef Jin Hwan's skills.

1848
01:06:28,659 --> 01:06:31,359
- No. You're right. - He's a pro.

1849
01:06:31,929 --> 01:06:34,469
- It is... - It can be someone else's kitchen.

1850
01:06:35,129 --> 01:06:36,868
- He might have learned it... - That's possible.

1851
01:06:36,869 --> 01:06:39,639
And acted as if it was what he did.

1852
01:06:39,809 --> 01:06:41,868
If that's the case, he's doing a great job.

1853
01:06:41,869 --> 01:06:43,339
- If... - In other words,

1854
01:06:43,639 --> 01:06:46,678
he doesn't do omakase if he's the fake one.

1855
01:06:46,679 --> 01:06:48,085
(He doesn't do omakase if he's the fake one.)

1856
01:06:48,109 --> 01:06:49,479
I think he's real.

1857
01:06:50,279 --> 01:06:51,779
I think he's a real chef.

1858
01:06:52,319 --> 01:06:55,848
There was something I felt sorry for Eun I.

1859
01:06:55,849 --> 01:06:57,659
- Do you remember it? - Why?

1860
01:06:57,789 --> 01:06:58,958
Why? What was it?

1861
01:06:58,959 --> 01:07:02,129
- With you, I was... - Did you have a crush on me?

1862
01:07:02,329 --> 01:07:03,628
(Did you have a crush on me?)

1863
01:07:03,629 --> 01:07:04,899
(Flustered)

1864
01:07:05,029 --> 01:07:06,909
- There's nothing to be sorry about. - A crush.

1865
01:07:07,199 --> 01:07:08,228
Without me knowing.

1866
01:07:08,229 --> 01:07:09,598
(The sin of having a crush on her without her knowing?)

1867
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:12,569
- Actually, I was a rookie. - I see.

1868
01:07:12,669 --> 01:07:14,868
It was a show I was on...

1869
01:07:14,869 --> 01:07:17,808
- together with Eun I. - I see.

1870
01:07:17,809 --> 01:07:19,339
I didn't show up.

1871
01:07:20,309 --> 01:07:21,309
I didn't show up.

1872
01:07:21,310 --> 01:07:22,708
(A rookie didn't show up to a shooting?)

1873
01:07:22,709 --> 01:07:23,879
Why did you do that?

1874
01:07:24,319 --> 01:07:25,549
I slept through it.

1875
01:07:25,949 --> 01:07:28,789
(I slept through it.)

1876
01:07:28,889 --> 01:07:30,618
(Excuse me?)

1877
01:07:30,619 --> 01:07:33,088
I don't know what I was thinking.

1878
01:07:33,089 --> 01:07:34,359
I just slept.

1879
01:07:34,659 --> 01:07:38,429
So, I still feel sorry for Eun I about it.

1880
01:07:38,599 --> 01:07:40,869
I hold such a feeling in me.

1881
01:07:41,229 --> 01:07:45,498
And I met her to shoot...

1882
01:07:45,499 --> 01:07:46,708
- the next episode. - Yes.

1883
01:07:46,709 --> 01:07:48,708
There was something you told me.

1884
01:07:48,709 --> 01:07:50,038
I still remember it.

1885
01:07:50,039 --> 01:07:52,938
"Liar." That was what you said.

1886
01:07:52,939 --> 01:07:54,579
Did I want to speak in English?

1887
01:07:56,419 --> 01:07:58,678
Liar.

1888
01:07:58,679 --> 01:08:00,788
Don't tell me you left the showbiz because she called you a liar.

1889
01:08:00,789 --> 01:08:01,889
No.

1890
01:08:02,389 --> 01:08:05,589
(Is he still a liar?)

1891
01:08:05,659 --> 01:08:08,188
Omakase is nice. I feel like I'm treated well.

1892
01:08:08,189 --> 01:08:09,228
- Right? - Yes.

1893
01:08:09,229 --> 01:08:11,599
- That's why we have omakase. - That's the charm.

1894
01:08:12,359 --> 01:08:14,098
If we knew we were having it,

1895
01:08:14,099 --> 01:08:16,229
- we should have eaten less. - Exactly.

1896
01:08:16,569 --> 01:08:18,598
We had a load of hot dogs and bungeoppang.

1897
01:08:18,599 --> 01:08:20,368
We also had a lot of hot chocolate too.

1898
01:08:20,369 --> 01:08:21,689
(I was happy because I was full.)

1899
01:08:22,009 --> 01:08:25,079
(A high-end omakase that captivated the members)

1900
01:08:26,549 --> 01:08:27,909
(And...)

1901
01:08:29,509 --> 01:08:32,449
(this place satisfies every customer that visits it.)

1902
01:08:32,949 --> 01:08:34,548
(The reviews overflows the N Search Engine.)

1903
01:08:34,549 --> 01:08:35,588
(I was shocked by the flavors and its freshness.)

1904
01:08:35,589 --> 01:08:36,688
(A private premium omakase my five senses love)

1905
01:08:36,689 --> 01:08:37,759
(The best omakase I had)

1906
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:41,029
(It gives the best satisfaction with 4.9 stars out of 5.)

(The finest ingredients that one can't easily see...)

1908
01:08:45,029 --> 01:08:47,629
(meet the best skills.)

1909
01:08:48,329 --> 01:08:51,239
(Will this high-end omakase be real?)

1910
01:08:52,369 --> 01:08:56,139
(Check the rest of the course on the unreleased video.)

1911
01:08:56,809 --> 01:08:58,338
(Thinking)

1912
01:08:58,339 --> 01:09:01,148
Everything here, including the taste of the food,

1913
01:09:01,149 --> 01:09:02,609
is flawless.

1914
01:09:03,449 --> 01:09:05,049
As for me,

1915
01:09:05,979 --> 01:09:08,148
- I'm a bit suspicious. - I see.

1916
01:09:08,149 --> 01:09:10,458
- There was a story he told us... - Yes.

1917
01:09:10,459 --> 01:09:12,958
About being a self-taught.

1918
01:09:12,959 --> 01:09:14,958
I think it could be a bluff.

1919
01:09:14,959 --> 01:09:16,498
- So I think... - The story was a bluff.

1920
01:09:16,499 --> 01:09:19,329
His story might not add up.

1921
01:09:19,529 --> 01:09:21,469
You're right. What do you think, Mimi?

1922
01:09:21,929 --> 01:09:23,469
Gosh. It's real.

1923
01:09:23,639 --> 01:09:24,998
(Gosh. It's real.)

1924
01:09:24,999 --> 01:09:26,168
It has to be real.

1925
01:09:26,169 --> 01:09:27,338
I think Mimi thinks...

1926
01:09:27,339 --> 01:09:29,008
everything is real if they serve something sweet.

1927
01:09:29,009 --> 01:09:30,238
(Mimi is having green tea icecream with honeycomb right now.)

1928
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:31,638
- If it's sweet... - Well...

1929
01:09:31,639 --> 01:09:32,679
- Gosh. - Goodness.

1930
01:09:33,349 --> 01:09:36,848
It's harder to find what's fake about it.

1931
01:09:36,849 --> 01:09:39,278
Gosh. It's hard. It's a tough one again today.

1932
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:40,888
(@Nonsense Chef Lee Jin Hwan, Self-taught the high-end skills?)

1933
01:09:40,889 --> 01:09:43,148
I should fix my makeup since I'm done eating.

1934
01:09:43,149 --> 01:09:44,159
(Should I fix my makeup?)

1935
01:09:44,259 --> 01:09:45,789
(She's ready.)

1936
01:09:47,529 --> 01:09:48,889
Gosh.

1937
01:09:49,029 --> 01:09:50,498
It looks like a gift wrap.

1938
01:09:50,499 --> 01:09:51,999
This is for the lips.

1939
01:09:52,229 --> 01:09:53,829
I have to put it on a lot.

1940
01:09:54,699 --> 01:09:55,868
It shows as soon as I put it on.

1941
01:09:55,869 --> 01:09:56,869
(Getting prettier)

1942
01:09:56,870 --> 01:09:57,939
It stings.

1943
01:09:58,169 --> 01:09:59,238
My lips are getting plumped.

1944
01:09:59,239 --> 01:10:01,169
Gosh. My lips are getting bigger.

1945
01:10:01,309 --> 01:10:02,608
(Here come Kim Kardashian's lips.)

1946
01:10:02,609 --> 01:10:04,179
My lips are pretty like Song Hye Kyo's.

1947
01:10:04,779 --> 01:10:07,309
Highlighters are in trend these days.

1948
01:10:08,049 --> 01:10:09,149
Put it on like this.

1949
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:12,079
My nose looks even more three-dimensional.

1950
01:10:12,949 --> 01:10:14,648
It's like magic.

1951
01:10:14,649 --> 01:10:15,689
(She's totally satisfied.)

1952
01:10:15,989 --> 01:10:17,559
I'm all set with these products.

(3. Deity of Games)

1956
01:10:25,599 --> 01:10:27,329
Wait. It's the street Mimi loves.

1957
01:10:27,799 --> 01:10:29,728
- The luxury brand street. - The luxury brand street.

1958
01:10:29,729 --> 01:10:31,299
- I'm happy now. - Yes.

1959
01:10:32,269 --> 01:10:33,338
It's nice, though.

1960
01:10:33,339 --> 01:10:35,468
- It makes you happy by looking. - Nice.

1961
01:10:35,469 --> 01:10:39,479
(Luxury brand shops along the street of Cheongdam-dong)

1962
01:10:40,779 --> 01:10:42,148
I love looking at them.

1963
01:10:42,149 --> 01:10:43,848
- I can't buy them as much. - By the way,

1964
01:10:43,849 --> 01:10:46,849
when I look around stuff in a department store,

1965
01:10:46,989 --> 01:10:48,549
- it makes me feel good. - Right.

1966
01:10:48,589 --> 01:10:49,648
I knew it.

1967
01:10:49,649 --> 01:10:51,188
This is what I was most dumbfounded by.

1968
01:10:51,189 --> 01:10:54,728
It was when we got paid about 150 dollars per show.

1969
01:10:54,729 --> 01:10:56,858
And an older guy who was a manager told him,

1970
01:10:56,859 --> 01:10:59,198
- Right, he did say that. - "You have to dress up well."

1971
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:00,568
- Yes. It was because... - "Wear something nice."

1972
01:11:00,569 --> 01:11:03,568
a person shouldn't look daunted.

1973
01:11:03,569 --> 01:11:04,968
- That's true. - Yes.

1974
01:11:04,969 --> 01:11:06,938
- He was well-dressed too. - That's right.

1975
01:11:06,939 --> 01:11:07,968
But...

1976
01:11:07,969 --> 01:11:09,308
(Laughing)

1977
01:11:09,309 --> 01:11:11,378
Jae Seok bought...

1978
01:11:11,379 --> 01:11:13,378
- a really impressive suit. - That's right.

1979
01:11:13,379 --> 01:11:14,548
It was Dolce and Gabbana.

1980
01:11:14,549 --> 01:11:15,908
- Gosh. - It was Dolce and Gabbana.

1981
01:11:15,909 --> 01:11:17,619
In "The Greatest Showman,"

1982
01:11:17,819 --> 01:11:20,688
the leader would wear something like that.

1983
01:11:20,689 --> 01:11:23,359
- He bought such a set of suits. - You're right.

1984
01:11:23,959 --> 01:11:27,289
(It probably looked like this.)

1985
01:11:27,489 --> 01:11:29,329
I bought it with a ten-month installment plan.

1986
01:11:29,359 --> 01:11:31,929
An installment plan is important.

1987
01:11:32,059 --> 01:11:33,158
It matters a lot.

1988
01:11:33,159 --> 01:11:35,428
If he knew anything about fashion, he wouldn't have bought it.

1989
01:11:35,429 --> 01:11:36,838
- Right? - Right.

1990
01:11:36,839 --> 01:11:40,338
When I think about the reason why we bought such a thing,

1991
01:11:40,339 --> 01:11:42,239
the logic was that when I wear it,

1992
01:11:42,509 --> 01:11:44,478
I'd look like a better person.

1993
01:11:44,479 --> 01:11:45,779
We kept deluding ourselves.

1994
01:11:46,139 --> 01:11:47,278
You're right.

1995
01:11:47,279 --> 01:11:50,049
But it didn't work at all.

1996
01:11:50,949 --> 01:11:52,018
This too shall pass.

1997
01:11:52,019 --> 01:11:53,489
Yes. It's a phase that passes.

1998
01:11:53,619 --> 01:11:55,818
Gosh. It's so funny how Mimi made her ears stand up.

1999
01:11:55,819 --> 01:11:56,858
(Laughing)

2000
01:11:56,859 --> 01:11:58,788
- Her ears have to show. - You did it all the time, right?

2001
01:11:58,789 --> 01:12:01,628
- Yes. - I thought it was something else.

2002
01:12:01,629 --> 01:12:03,358
- What? - A bandage because you got hurt.

2003
01:12:03,359 --> 01:12:05,428
No. It's to make my ears stand up.

2004
01:12:05,429 --> 01:12:07,168
- It's a beauty product. - At first, I saw her ears...

2005
01:12:07,169 --> 01:12:08,928
and thought she was wearing the in-ear monitor.

2006
01:12:08,929 --> 01:12:10,839
It's a secret to my youthful look.

2007
01:12:11,339 --> 01:12:14,208
As for your eyes, you're wearing contacts, right?

2008
01:12:14,209 --> 01:12:15,489
Yes. I'm wearing contact lenses.

2009
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:18,978
I asked you because your eye color was pretty.

2010
01:12:18,979 --> 01:12:20,679
- Do you want my lenses? - No.

2011
01:12:20,849 --> 01:12:23,149
In short, nothing is hers.

2012
01:12:23,349 --> 01:12:25,418
Everything is fake.

2013
01:12:25,419 --> 01:12:27,388
- She is fake. - It's all lies.

2014
01:12:27,389 --> 01:12:30,288
- It's like an AI. - My whole life is a fake.

2015
01:12:30,289 --> 01:12:31,319
(Mimi's face is fake.)

2016
01:12:31,959 --> 01:12:33,288
Everything is fake.

2017
01:12:33,289 --> 01:12:35,028
She says something like this,

2018
01:12:35,029 --> 01:12:36,929
but she's very charismatic when she performs.

2019
01:12:37,029 --> 01:12:38,898
Mimi looks different on stage.

2020
01:12:38,899 --> 01:12:40,329
- That's right. - Yes.

2021
01:12:40,369 --> 01:12:41,369
That's right.

2022
01:12:42,099 --> 01:12:43,639
- It's her music video. - Yes.

2023
01:12:43,669 --> 01:12:45,138
(Grooving)

2024
01:12:45,139 --> 01:12:46,568
It's embarrassing.

2025
01:12:46,569 --> 01:12:47,769
I was a baby back then.

2026
01:12:48,109 --> 01:12:49,839
- It was right after my debut. - Right.

2027
01:12:50,009 --> 01:12:54,009
(She has been so charismatic on stage since 10 years ago.)

2028
01:12:58,749 --> 01:13:00,618
(Trying to seize the phone)

2029
01:13:00,619 --> 01:13:02,448
- Why are you doing that? - She's embarrassed.

2030
01:13:02,449 --> 01:13:04,019
I can't really watch my stuff.

2031
01:13:05,019 --> 01:13:06,958
(Terrified)

2032
01:13:06,959 --> 01:13:08,859
- Come on, Jae Seok. - Okay.

2033
01:13:09,029 --> 01:13:10,098
- Why? - Why does it keep playing...

2034
01:13:10,099 --> 01:13:11,129
when it's shut?

2035
01:13:12,029 --> 01:13:13,498
(It's fun to tease Mimi.)

2036
01:13:13,499 --> 01:13:15,498
I've never seen her like that.

2037
01:13:15,499 --> 01:13:16,698
- Mimi, why? - Gosh.

2038
01:13:16,699 --> 01:13:18,299
My face almost exploded.

2039
01:13:20,069 --> 01:13:21,869
What would the Deity of Games be?

2040
01:13:22,569 --> 01:13:24,009
Would it be the claw machine?

2041
01:13:25,279 --> 01:13:26,948
- What? I think it's here. - It's here.

2042
01:13:26,949 --> 01:13:28,609
We're here.

2043
01:13:29,579 --> 01:13:30,818
(But...)

2044
01:13:30,819 --> 01:13:33,278
- It's a normal neighborhood. - I know.

2045
01:13:33,279 --> 01:13:35,419
I don't think it's a commercial street.

2046
01:13:36,819 --> 01:13:37,858
Wait. This is just...

2047
01:13:37,859 --> 01:13:39,088
(Unlike before, )

2048
01:13:39,089 --> 01:13:40,728
- Will it be in a house? - Right.

2049
01:13:40,729 --> 01:13:42,365
(they've arrived in a normal residential area.)

2050
01:13:42,389 --> 01:13:44,398
Gosh. We can't help but be suspicious of this place...

2051
01:13:44,399 --> 01:13:46,599
- since it has to be a trendy place. - Right?

2052
01:13:47,269 --> 01:13:49,468
It has nothing to do with an arcade.

2053
01:13:49,469 --> 01:13:50,969
It's a residential area.

2054
01:13:52,239 --> 01:13:53,298
It's a house.

2055
01:13:53,299 --> 01:13:54,868
(Confused)

2056
01:13:54,869 --> 01:13:57,479
There's no signage. It's a house.

2057
01:13:58,579 --> 01:14:01,308
Who will it be? The Deity of Games?

2058
01:14:01,309 --> 01:14:03,285
(What kind of deity of games will be at such an ordinary place?)

2059
01:14:03,309 --> 01:14:04,348
There is a bicycle.

2060
01:14:04,349 --> 01:14:06,678
What? I smell incense.

2061
01:14:06,679 --> 01:14:07,689
Why?

2062
01:14:07,949 --> 01:14:10,559
(The stong incense comes out from the entrance.)

2063
01:14:11,089 --> 01:14:12,658
It looks folksy.

2064
01:14:12,659 --> 01:14:14,139
(A folksy decoration is on the door.)

2065
01:14:14,329 --> 01:14:15,428
It's very different.

2066
01:14:15,429 --> 01:14:16,429
(From the entrance, it already feels unique.)

2067
01:14:16,430 --> 01:14:18,230
Gosh. A folk painting is hanging on the wall.

2068
01:14:18,899 --> 01:14:19,928
It's a folk painting of a tiger.

2069
01:14:19,929 --> 01:14:21,889
(They see a folk painting as soon as they enter.)

2070
01:14:22,569 --> 01:14:25,438
- There are knives. - Gosh. It's like that thing.

2071
01:14:25,439 --> 01:14:28,239
(Are there knives placed at the entrance?)

2072
01:14:29,539 --> 01:14:32,109
- It's a fortuneteller's house. - Is it a shrine?

2073
01:14:33,549 --> 01:14:34,649
What? He's playing a game.

2074
01:14:36,579 --> 01:14:39,049
(A game? Fortuneteller's house? What do you mean?)

2075
01:14:44,789 --> 01:14:47,528
(In a small room, )

2076
01:14:47,529 --> 01:14:49,659
(there is a shrine.)

2077
01:14:50,699 --> 01:14:53,059
(Colorful paintings fill up the walls.)

2078
01:14:54,699 --> 01:14:58,499
(The tools with the energy from the deity)

2079
01:15:00,309 --> 01:15:02,469
(In a place filled with incense...)

2080
01:15:04,079 --> 01:15:05,478
- He's playing a game. - Goodness.

2081
01:15:05,479 --> 01:15:06,479
- What? What is it? - Gosh.

2082
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:07,560
(Someone's playing a game?)

2083
01:15:07,849 --> 01:15:11,579
(Focused on the game in a sacred place, )

2084
01:15:12,049 --> 01:15:14,119
(who is this person?)

2085
01:15:14,449 --> 01:15:16,688
- He's really playing a game. - He's there with a topknot.

2086
01:15:16,689 --> 01:15:17,689
(Murmuring)

2087
01:15:18,259 --> 01:15:19,359
Who is he?

2088
01:15:20,759 --> 01:15:22,659
- Excuse me. - Hello.

2089
01:15:24,199 --> 01:15:25,998
- Excuse me. - Hello.

2090
01:15:25,999 --> 01:15:27,029
- Hello. - Hello.

2091
01:15:28,499 --> 01:15:29,569
- Are you... - Yes.

2092
01:15:29,969 --> 01:15:32,869
- Come in. It's cold. - Hello.

2093
01:15:33,869 --> 01:15:36,239
- Is this a shrine? - Yes. This is jeonan.

2094
01:15:37,139 --> 01:15:38,209
What's jeonan?

2095
01:15:38,479 --> 01:15:41,349
It's a shrine in shamanism.

2096
01:15:41,809 --> 01:15:44,449
- You serve the deity, right? - Right.

2097
01:15:44,549 --> 01:15:45,778
But you like to play games,

2098
01:15:45,779 --> 01:15:47,018
- so you're the Deity of Games. - Deity of Games.

2099
01:15:47,019 --> 01:15:49,319
- Yes. - That's why you're Deity of Games.

2100
01:15:50,689 --> 01:15:52,858
(A shaman's...)

2101
01:15:52,859 --> 01:15:54,789
(double life)

2102
01:15:56,089 --> 01:15:58,359
Hello. I'm a shaman with 13 years of experience.

2103
01:15:58,459 --> 01:16:01,129
I'm also a professional gamer, Kang Seong Ho.

2104
01:16:01,229 --> 01:16:02,768
(The Deity of Games, Shaman Kang Seong Ho)

2105
01:16:02,769 --> 01:16:05,268
When my mother was four months pregnant,

2106
01:16:05,269 --> 01:16:06,969
an old shaman lady lived next door.

2107
01:16:07,439 --> 01:16:09,838
She told my mother all of a sudden,

2108
01:16:09,839 --> 01:16:12,319
"Your baby is going to be a shaman, so don't get an abortion."

2109
01:16:12,509 --> 01:16:14,709
When I was young, there were times...

2110
01:16:14,809 --> 01:16:17,419
when what I said came true.

2111
01:16:17,749 --> 01:16:19,819
I dreamed about it many times.

2112
01:16:19,919 --> 01:16:22,588
When I turned 26 years old,

2113
01:16:22,589 --> 01:16:24,189
I suffered from possession.

2114
01:16:24,789 --> 01:16:28,089
My bones ached, and I had a fever.

2115
01:16:28,429 --> 01:16:31,199
But the doctors couldn't diagnose it.

2116
01:16:31,399 --> 01:16:34,299
So, I knew it instinctively that it was from possession.

2117
01:16:35,769 --> 01:16:39,098
(His life as a shaman started when he was 26 years old.)

2118
01:16:39,099 --> 01:16:41,709
There's another talent the deity gave me.

2119
01:16:41,909 --> 01:16:43,208
I'm a professional Tekken player.

2120
01:16:43,209 --> 01:16:45,339
(His other life is a professional Tekken player.)

2121
01:16:45,809 --> 01:16:49,209
I've started playing it as a pro since 2017.

2122
01:16:49,779 --> 01:16:53,149
I participated in a contest in 2017, and I was good at it.

2123
01:16:53,479 --> 01:16:56,548
I got a great result, which grabbed people's attention.

2124
01:16:56,549 --> 01:16:59,389
(His life as a professional gamer has started like that.)

2125
01:16:59,619 --> 01:17:02,959
I won the first place in Tekken at a world competition in Australia.

2126
01:17:03,259 --> 01:17:06,199
In 2016, I won the second place.

2127
01:17:06,699 --> 01:17:09,005
(He maintains 13th place in the world rankings as of now.)

2128
01:17:09,029 --> 01:17:11,669
When I greet the deity in the morning, I get a feeling.

2129
01:17:12,199 --> 01:17:14,838
"I won't do well in this competition."

2130
01:17:14,839 --> 01:17:16,485
(He gets a hint about the game from the deity.)

2131
01:17:16,509 --> 01:17:18,678
(But his main job is being a shaman.)

2132
01:17:18,679 --> 01:17:21,279
Have famous people visited you?

2133
01:17:22,249 --> 01:17:25,318
The presidents of construction companies.

2134
01:17:25,319 --> 01:17:28,689
Many politicians and celebrities visit me too.

2135
01:17:29,019 --> 01:17:30,299
How many people visit you a day?

2136
01:17:30,859 --> 01:17:33,459
About 270 people a month at the most.

2137
01:17:33,959 --> 01:17:36,688
When it becomes midnight,

2138
01:17:36,689 --> 01:17:39,359
the reservation starts flooding in up to 140 people.

2139
01:17:39,559 --> 01:17:41,698
They send reservation messages.

2140
01:17:41,699 --> 01:17:43,869
(As of today, he is a trendy shaman on social media.)

2141
01:17:44,299 --> 01:17:47,569
(He'll tell the members' chilling fortune in a bit too.)

2142
01:17:47,839 --> 01:17:49,139
(I'm not lying.)

2143
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:50,685
(Will he guess Dong Yoon's future correctly?)

2144
01:17:50,709 --> 01:17:52,138
(Kyoung Pyo is in danger of losing his job...)

2145
01:17:52,139 --> 01:17:53,539
(because of what the shaman says.)

2146
01:17:54,109 --> 01:17:56,349
(A very skillful professional gamer and shaman)

2147
01:17:56,679 --> 01:17:58,618
Everyone, am I real?

2148
01:17:58,619 --> 01:18:00,579
(Will the professional gamer and shaman be real?)

2149
01:18:01,149 --> 01:18:02,249
I see. This is...

2150
01:18:02,919 --> 01:18:05,058
He's really the Deity of Games.

2151
01:18:05,059 --> 01:18:06,719
They are trophies.

2152
01:18:07,029 --> 01:18:08,629
- Tekken. - These are trophies.

2153
01:18:09,489 --> 01:18:10,528
Are these all trophies?

2154
01:18:10,529 --> 01:18:12,769
(They found so many trophies in the corner of the room.)

2155
01:18:13,459 --> 01:18:14,498
The Chairman of the National Assembly Cup.

2156
01:18:14,499 --> 01:18:16,145
(An award from the Chairman of the National Assembly)

2157
01:18:16,169 --> 01:18:19,338
You're currently an e-sport athlete.

2158
01:18:19,339 --> 01:18:20,568
Yes.

2159
01:18:20,569 --> 01:18:23,108
My main job is being a shaman, but my side job is a pro gamer.

2160
01:18:23,109 --> 01:18:24,309
Gosh. That's crazy.

2161
01:18:24,979 --> 01:18:27,079
One can have such two jobs.

2162
01:18:27,279 --> 01:18:30,719
The theme of today's show is...

2163
01:18:31,179 --> 01:18:32,778
"What are you doing here?"

2164
01:18:32,779 --> 01:18:33,788
(He's the "you" in this part.)

2165
01:18:33,789 --> 01:18:36,619
- Each keyword fits each person. - Exactly.

2166
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:39,858
For how many people a year do you read the fortunes?

2167
01:18:39,859 --> 01:18:42,658
When I'm busy,

2168
01:18:42,659 --> 01:18:44,940
I read 200 people's fortune, aside from playing the game.

2169
01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:46,598
- A month? - Yes. I do more...

2170
01:18:46,599 --> 01:18:48,305
if I don't participate in the game competitions.

2171
01:18:48,329 --> 01:18:50,568
- A year? - A month.

2172
01:18:50,569 --> 01:18:52,038
- A month. - It's 200 people a month.

2173
01:18:52,039 --> 01:18:54,069
- You must be fully booked. - Yes.

2174
01:18:54,669 --> 01:18:57,308
Some get angry because they have to wait for a long time.

2175
01:18:57,309 --> 01:18:58,579
(It's just so interesting.)

2176
01:18:59,139 --> 01:19:01,178
Can you read our fortune too?

2177
01:19:01,179 --> 01:19:02,909
Yes. If anyone's curious.

2178
01:19:03,849 --> 01:19:04,889
How about you, Kyoung Pyo?

2179
01:19:05,179 --> 01:19:06,819
Me? Well, personally,

2180
01:19:07,489 --> 01:19:10,559
- I don't see a fortuneteller. - Right.

2181
01:19:11,119 --> 01:19:14,329
If they say a good thing, I would get comfortable.

2182
01:19:14,959 --> 01:19:16,689
If they say a bad thing,

2183
01:19:16,789 --> 01:19:18,328
- I'd think, "Why would I bother..." - Right.

2184
01:19:18,329 --> 01:19:19,935
- "when it'll turn out badly?" - You're right.

2185
01:19:19,959 --> 01:19:21,629
- It's just to keep in mind. - Right.

2186
01:19:21,769 --> 01:19:24,138
- Please do it. - When's your birthday?

2187
01:19:24,139 --> 01:19:27,508
It's June 11, 1990. Around midnight or 2am.

2188
01:19:27,509 --> 01:19:29,268
- It was the Year of the Horse. - Yes.

2189
01:19:29,269 --> 01:19:31,178
- He said he didn't want it. - You said you didn't want it.

2190
01:19:31,179 --> 01:19:33,009
- But you know the hours and all. - Hey.

2191
01:19:33,179 --> 01:19:36,648
- You sound like a professional. - You know the details. Yes

2192
01:19:36,649 --> 01:19:39,518
- You're a prepared customer. - What's up with him?

2193
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:40,599
I know. What's up with him?

2194
01:19:40,789 --> 01:19:43,089
- He came prepared. - He knows the details.

2195
01:19:43,649 --> 01:19:45,769
(While they talk, he focuses on reading the fortune.)

2196
01:19:50,089 --> 01:19:52,359
(Focused)

2197
01:19:52,999 --> 01:19:55,505
(The vibe has changed completely as he starts reading the fortune.)

2198
01:19:55,529 --> 01:19:57,169
(They get into it.)

2199
01:19:59,639 --> 01:20:01,169
Well, this year,

2200
01:20:01,709 --> 01:20:04,229
the digestive system, including the large and small intestines,

2201
01:20:04,439 --> 01:20:05,878
and the pancreas, can be vulnerable.

2202
01:20:05,879 --> 01:20:08,509
The organs that make the digestive fluid are vulnerable.

2203
01:20:09,009 --> 01:20:11,519
(What?)

2204
01:20:11,619 --> 01:20:13,218
So, you need to watch...

2205
01:20:13,219 --> 01:20:15,179
for your large and small intestines and pancreas.

2206
01:20:15,249 --> 01:20:16,688
- I see. - Be careful with those.

2207
01:20:16,689 --> 01:20:19,319
My grandmother died from pancreatic cancer.

2208
01:20:20,729 --> 01:20:21,859
Why are you surprised?

2209
01:20:22,759 --> 01:20:24,598
My grandmother died from pancreatic cancer.

2210
01:20:24,599 --> 01:20:25,898
(Shocked)

2211
01:20:25,899 --> 01:20:26,958
(He was surprised.)

2212
01:20:26,959 --> 01:20:28,069
Why are you surprised?

2213
01:20:28,969 --> 01:20:31,098
Kwon Ryeol, why are you shocked?

2214
01:20:31,099 --> 01:20:34,308
(Laughing, shy)

2215
01:20:34,309 --> 01:20:36,969
You always have that, Kyoung Pyo.

2216
01:20:37,479 --> 01:20:40,439
You have some weight in your fortune. so...

2217
01:20:41,079 --> 01:20:43,279
(You have some weight in your fortune.)

2218
01:20:43,849 --> 01:20:45,279
Do you want me to go on a diet?

2219
01:20:45,549 --> 01:20:47,349
No. It's not that weight.

2220
01:20:48,549 --> 01:20:49,748
It's the weight of ominous fortune.

2221
01:20:49,749 --> 01:20:50,889
(What's wrong with him?)

2222
01:20:51,189 --> 01:20:53,335
- It's the weight of deadly fortune. - Deadly fortune?

2223
01:20:53,359 --> 01:20:54,958
It's the weight of ominous fortune.

2224
01:20:54,959 --> 01:20:56,859
- Deadly fortune? - Yes. So,

2225
01:20:57,459 --> 01:20:59,328
when you're about to win something big,

2226
01:20:59,329 --> 01:21:01,610
something always happens, preventing you from getting it.

2227
01:21:01,669 --> 01:21:03,829
It always leaves much to be desired.

2228
01:21:04,399 --> 01:21:07,769
So, you always have to watch your mouth.

2229
01:21:08,269 --> 01:21:09,589
You have to keep your mouth shut.

2230
01:21:10,909 --> 01:21:13,078
He's finally making some appearances on variety shows, though.

2231
01:21:13,079 --> 01:21:14,559
- His job requires talking. - It's...

2232
01:21:14,849 --> 01:21:16,709
You always have to keep quiet and be still.

2233
01:21:17,079 --> 01:21:18,248
(He's keeping quiet and still.)

2234
01:21:18,249 --> 01:21:20,789
Also, this year, you might face legal difficulties.

2235
01:21:21,219 --> 01:21:23,188
You might have legal issues.

2236
01:21:23,189 --> 01:21:24,709
You might get in trouble with someone.

2237
01:21:24,759 --> 01:21:26,889
Please be careful until the end of February.

2238
01:21:27,489 --> 01:21:30,429
Until the end of February. Also,

2239
01:21:30,759 --> 01:21:33,259
don't try to go far like overseas.

2240
01:21:33,429 --> 01:21:36,398
"I'll live in an overseas country. I'll stay there for a while."

2241
01:21:36,399 --> 01:21:38,269
"I'll stay on Jeju Island." Don't consider it.

2242
01:21:38,699 --> 01:21:39,699
Have you considered it?

2243
01:21:39,939 --> 01:21:40,939
(Nodding)

2244
01:21:41,339 --> 01:21:43,538
- He's not talking already. - He's started to say less.

2245
01:21:43,539 --> 01:21:46,139
- He's already saying less. - He's believing it already.

2246
01:21:46,539 --> 01:21:48,108
He's not saying you shouldn't speak here.

2247
01:21:48,109 --> 01:21:49,178
(He already has a blind faith in it.)

2248
01:21:49,179 --> 01:21:50,249
Kyoung Pyo.

2249
01:21:50,919 --> 01:21:52,218
The good thing is that you're blessed...

2250
01:21:52,219 --> 01:21:53,518
- with good people. - That's right.

2251
01:21:53,519 --> 01:21:56,079
- Many good people are around you. - He's fortunate with people.

2252
01:21:56,489 --> 01:21:58,919
Thanks to that, you won't starve to death.

2253
01:21:59,489 --> 01:22:01,128
Also,

2254
01:22:01,129 --> 01:22:03,329
when you have a dream,

2255
01:22:03,429 --> 01:22:05,259
it suggests to you about the future.

2256
01:22:05,499 --> 01:22:07,928
When you have a dream, don't overlook it.

2257
01:22:07,929 --> 01:22:10,869
Look into it. If it's an ominous one, be careful.

2258
01:22:12,499 --> 01:22:13,698
(Kyoung Pyo's fortune in 2025)

2259
01:22:13,699 --> 01:22:16,468
(Be careful with your mouth, pancreas, and journeys)

2260
01:22:16,469 --> 01:22:18,509
(Be careful with everything.)

2261
01:22:18,879 --> 01:22:21,255
Kyoung Pyo needs to keep his mouth shut and sit still, right?

2262
01:22:21,279 --> 01:22:22,349
- That's correct. - Yes.

2263
01:22:23,949 --> 01:22:26,149
- I shouldn't have done it. - Why?

2264
01:22:26,649 --> 01:22:27,719
It's uncomfortable.

2265
01:22:28,149 --> 01:22:29,288
(He's honest.)

2266
01:22:29,289 --> 01:22:31,589
- Exactly. - It's all right.

2267
01:22:31,859 --> 01:22:33,288
You have to know it...

2268
01:22:33,289 --> 01:22:34,728
- to watch out for it. - It's for precautions.

2269
01:22:34,729 --> 01:22:36,958
- It doesn't mean it'll happen. - Right.

2270
01:22:36,959 --> 01:22:39,199
Don't get too immersed in it.

2271
01:22:39,829 --> 01:22:42,429
(Is the shaman, who got Kyoung Pyo's family history right, real?)

2272
01:22:42,469 --> 01:22:44,168
- Dong Yoon, do you want to try it? - Go for it.

2273
01:22:44,169 --> 01:22:45,499
(It's Dong Yoon's turn.)

2274
01:22:45,799 --> 01:22:48,439
- I go to church. - I see.

2275
01:22:48,609 --> 01:22:51,478
So I think I'll be able to hear it with a critical attitude.

2276
01:22:51,479 --> 01:22:52,539
- I see. Okay. - I see.

2277
01:22:53,009 --> 01:22:55,749
I was born on July 12, 1992.

2278
01:22:55,849 --> 01:22:57,419
- It was the Year of the Monkey. - Yes.

2279
01:22:59,549 --> 01:23:01,669
(He starts reading the fortune without a word again.)

2280
01:23:01,819 --> 01:23:03,448
I don't think he's acting, though.

2281
01:23:03,449 --> 01:23:04,959
- I don't think he's acting. - Right?

2282
01:23:05,259 --> 01:23:06,288
Do you think he's real?

2283
01:23:06,289 --> 01:23:07,559
(He seems so real.)

2284
01:23:07,889 --> 01:23:10,159
(Watching carefully)

2285
01:23:11,929 --> 01:23:13,099
(Thinking)

2286
01:23:13,729 --> 01:23:15,329
(What is it?)

2287
01:23:16,099 --> 01:23:18,339
Where do you live right now?

2288
01:23:18,639 --> 01:23:20,045
- Gaepo-dong. - Is that where you sleep?

2289
01:23:20,069 --> 01:23:21,568
- Yes. Gaepo-dong. - Do you live alone?

2290
01:23:21,569 --> 01:23:22,639
I do live alone.

2291
01:23:24,379 --> 01:23:26,979
(He continues to read the fortune after throwing some questions.)

2292
01:23:27,349 --> 01:23:29,509
(What will he say this time?)

2293
01:23:31,149 --> 01:23:34,918
There will be a change, regarding your house, the place you sleep.

2294
01:23:34,919 --> 01:23:36,849
- I will move? - Right. But...

2295
01:23:37,019 --> 01:23:38,688
it isn't because that house is specifically bad.

2296
01:23:38,689 --> 01:23:41,169
There will be a moment when it will be inevitable to move out.

2297
01:23:41,389 --> 01:23:44,098
- That will be this summer. - What?

2298
01:23:44,099 --> 01:23:45,129
But...

2299
01:23:46,659 --> 01:23:48,669
(What is it?)

2300
01:23:49,029 --> 01:23:50,298
I'm really not lying about this.

2301
01:23:50,299 --> 01:23:52,069
My contract ends this summer.

2302
01:23:52,339 --> 01:23:53,439
It ends in June.

2303
01:23:53,939 --> 01:23:55,039
It ends in June.

2304
01:23:57,139 --> 01:23:59,008
Why are you getting surprised?

2305
01:23:59,009 --> 01:24:01,748
- I'm serious. - You should sit here instead.

2306
01:24:01,749 --> 01:24:04,309
I don't think we can use that angle. He keeps getting surprised.

2307
01:24:04,719 --> 01:24:05,918
Gosh, Kwon Ryeol.

2308
01:24:05,919 --> 01:24:07,848
You should sit here. You look the most interested.

2309
01:24:07,849 --> 01:24:09,148
I was thinking about renewing my contract.

2310
01:24:09,149 --> 01:24:11,058
- It isn't because the house is bad. - Right.

2311
01:24:11,059 --> 01:24:14,389
This place is good to live as a family.

2312
01:24:14,959 --> 01:24:16,839
It would be good to leave to a different place.

2313
01:24:16,989 --> 01:24:18,658
It actually is a place that feels that way.

2314
01:24:18,659 --> 01:24:20,328
It's a place where a lot of families live.

2315
01:24:20,329 --> 01:24:21,928
Right. They all raise children.

2316
01:24:21,929 --> 01:24:23,729
I'm the only to live there on my own.

2317
01:24:23,999 --> 01:24:25,868
(He's very talented.)

2318
01:24:25,869 --> 01:24:26,869
And...

2319
01:24:27,869 --> 01:24:31,109
do you have other siblings in your family besides yourself?

2320
01:24:31,279 --> 01:24:32,679
- I have an older brother. - Right.

2321
01:24:32,909 --> 01:24:34,008
- I have an older brother. - Right.

2322
01:24:34,009 --> 01:24:35,178
(Why is he asking if he has siblings?)

2323
01:24:35,179 --> 01:24:36,459
This year, your older brother...

2324
01:24:36,549 --> 01:24:38,218
(This was edited out as it was too much of a personal opinion.)

2325
01:24:38,219 --> 01:24:40,648
That is why he has to be careful.

2326
01:24:40,649 --> 01:24:41,649
What?

2327
01:24:42,189 --> 01:24:43,548
He has to be really careful.

2328
01:24:43,549 --> 01:24:45,289
Something will definitely happen.

2329
01:24:46,289 --> 01:24:48,488
It runs in the family. That is why he has to be careful.

2330
01:24:48,489 --> 01:24:49,658
We do slightly have that in the family.

2331
01:24:49,659 --> 01:24:51,199
Right. He needs to watch out.

2332
01:24:51,259 --> 01:24:54,058
(Is he really a shaman that can see through anyone?)

2333
01:24:54,059 --> 01:24:56,769
All right. You may move back now, Dong Yoon.

2334
01:24:57,269 --> 01:24:59,039
The atmosphere has become really serious.

2335
01:24:59,769 --> 01:25:01,668
- Right. - Does that mean...

2336
01:25:01,669 --> 01:25:03,268
we don't have anyone healthy among us?

2337
01:25:03,269 --> 01:25:04,439
We don't.

2338
01:25:05,079 --> 01:25:06,378
(Dong Yoon's fortune in 2025)

2339
01:25:06,379 --> 01:25:08,408
(Move out in June.)

2340
01:25:08,409 --> 01:25:10,749
(Him and his family must watch out for health issues.)

2341
01:25:11,319 --> 01:25:14,489
This is what I'm most curious about.

2342
01:25:15,019 --> 01:25:16,549
You're a fortune teller.

2343
01:25:16,749 --> 01:25:19,418
How is it when...

2344
01:25:19,419 --> 01:25:22,828
you read your own fortune when you enter a game competition?

2345
01:25:22,829 --> 01:25:24,999
I can sense how things will be that day.

2346
01:25:25,129 --> 01:25:26,858
Right. I expect certain things to happen...

2347
01:25:26,859 --> 01:25:28,028
or have dreams about them.

2348
01:25:28,029 --> 01:25:30,939
Did you already know you were going to lose to him?

2349
01:25:31,299 --> 01:25:32,499
(Embarrassed)

2350
01:25:32,739 --> 01:25:34,068
(Dong Yoon and the shaman pro gamer had a Tekken match...)

2351
01:25:34,069 --> 01:25:35,368
(before the fortune telling.)

2352
01:25:35,369 --> 01:25:37,839
(The former top ranker pressures Dong Yoon from the start.)

2353
01:25:38,179 --> 01:25:40,509
(He seemed to slowly fall behind.)

2354
01:25:40,609 --> 01:25:41,609
(Dong Yoon, shaman)

2355
01:25:41,909 --> 01:25:44,518
(He fiercely gets back at him.)

2356
01:25:44,519 --> 01:25:45,748
(In the end...)

2357
01:25:45,749 --> 01:25:46,749
(Sighing)

2358
01:25:47,019 --> 01:25:48,718
(What is going on?)

2359
01:25:48,719 --> 01:25:51,519
(Dong Yoon takes the win against the pro gamer!)

2360
01:25:51,619 --> 01:25:53,889
Isn't he messing up our show?

2361
01:25:55,729 --> 01:25:58,359
- Did you really do your best? - Yes. I did do my best.

2362
01:25:58,799 --> 01:26:00,158
But he was a top ranker.

2363
01:26:00,159 --> 01:26:03,799
(A fake pro gamer or a real one who lost to him on purpose?)

2364
01:26:03,869 --> 01:26:06,869
Did you already know you were going to lose to him?

2365
01:26:07,069 --> 01:26:08,069
(Embarrassed)

2366
01:26:08,469 --> 01:26:09,469
He wouldn't have looked into that.

2367
01:26:09,470 --> 01:26:11,308
He told you to keep your mouth shut.

2368
01:26:11,309 --> 01:26:13,429
What am I supposed to do? This is part of my job too!

2369
01:26:13,539 --> 01:26:14,548
He happened to tell me that earlier.

2370
01:26:14,549 --> 01:26:16,348
How do I work now?

2371
01:26:16,349 --> 01:26:17,979
(Feeling bad for some reason)

2372
01:26:18,149 --> 01:26:20,148
But we should always be careful with what we say.

2373
01:26:20,149 --> 01:26:21,348
- Right. - Right.

2374
01:26:21,349 --> 01:26:23,848
- He said something obvious to me. - He did.

2375
01:26:23,849 --> 01:26:26,249
- He wanted you to be careful. - I should always be careful.

2376
01:26:26,459 --> 01:26:28,789
But this is what comes into mind first.

2377
01:26:28,829 --> 01:26:29,829
I'm sorry to say this...

2378
01:26:29,829 --> 01:26:30,829
- in front of you. - It's fine.

2379
01:26:30,830 --> 01:26:33,328
- We have to suspect everything. - This is what we do in our show.

2380
01:26:33,329 --> 01:26:34,998
But this comes to mind.

2381
01:26:34,999 --> 01:26:36,998
This is the perfect size for the production crew to work with.

2382
01:26:36,999 --> 01:26:39,338
Right. I strongly agree with that as well.

2383
01:26:39,339 --> 01:26:40,738
(A small space that the crew can easily work with?)

2384
01:26:40,739 --> 01:26:43,038
And the smell of incense feels too strong.

2385
01:26:43,039 --> 01:26:44,279
(The incense feels too strong?)

2386
01:26:44,409 --> 01:26:47,579
And this picture bothers me.

2387
01:26:47,779 --> 01:26:49,449
The frame...

2388
01:26:49,979 --> 01:26:52,019
feels like it was set up.

2389
01:26:52,379 --> 01:26:54,248
That picture also bothered me.

2390
01:26:54,249 --> 01:26:56,689
I'm not suspicious about the photo, but the frame feels fake.

2391
01:26:57,089 --> 01:26:59,519
When he talked about the spine earlier,

2392
01:26:59,889 --> 01:27:02,029
he said it in the order of the neck, waist and back.

2393
01:27:02,889 --> 01:27:04,329
(Earlier)

2394
01:27:04,429 --> 01:27:06,599
(Be careful with your neck, waist, and back!)

2395
01:27:07,129 --> 01:27:08,769
(What kind of clue did CEO Song spot?)

2396
01:27:09,999 --> 01:27:11,815
(He said it in the order of the neck, waist and back.)

2397
01:27:11,839 --> 01:27:12,938
It should be said in the order of the neck, back, and waist,

2398
01:27:12,939 --> 01:27:15,220
but he said it in the order of the neck, waist, and back.

2399
01:27:15,339 --> 01:27:16,738
(Disappearing from the screen because of the ridiculous reason)

2400
01:27:16,739 --> 01:27:19,008
Can't he make a mistake with that as he isn't a doctor?

2401
01:27:19,009 --> 01:27:20,009
So...

2402
01:27:20,709 --> 01:27:22,949
I wonder if he memorized the lines incorrectly.

2403
01:27:23,749 --> 01:27:26,478
He made a mistake as he memorized the lines quickly.

2404
01:27:26,479 --> 01:27:28,449
And personally,

2405
01:27:28,689 --> 01:27:31,988
I really wish for him not to be a shaman.

2406
01:27:31,989 --> 01:27:33,658
(A very personal reason)

2407
01:27:33,659 --> 01:27:35,028
That's what you just personally think.

2408
01:27:35,029 --> 01:27:37,058
I personally just wish for him to be...

2409
01:27:37,059 --> 01:27:39,928
someone who checks my shows as a fan.

2410
01:27:39,929 --> 01:27:42,469
And including my grandmother,

2411
01:27:42,869 --> 01:27:44,439
my pancreas is strong.

2412
01:27:44,699 --> 01:27:46,568
My pancreas was the cleanest part during the checkup.

2413
01:27:46,569 --> 01:27:47,768
- I can digest things well. - But...

2414
01:27:47,769 --> 01:27:49,438
aren't you believing the things he said too strongly?

2415
01:27:49,439 --> 01:27:50,439
Right.

2416
01:27:50,569 --> 01:27:52,278
- He's... - I want to deny it so much.

2417
01:27:52,279 --> 01:27:53,378
- He's... - This is why...

2418
01:27:53,379 --> 01:27:55,308
- he doesn't visit fortune tellers. - Right.

2419
01:27:55,309 --> 01:27:56,408
- He knows what he's like. - I believe everything.

2420
01:27:56,409 --> 01:27:58,089
I believe everything that gets told to me.

2421
01:27:58,449 --> 01:28:01,118
He's a lot weaker than I thought.

2422
01:28:01,119 --> 01:28:02,148
He's weak-minded.

2423
01:28:02,149 --> 01:28:04,089
- Right. He's weak-minded. - He's weak-minded.

2424
01:28:05,319 --> 01:28:06,658
Gosh, I'm not sure.

2425
01:28:06,659 --> 01:28:07,789
Wasn't that strange?

2426
01:28:08,559 --> 01:28:09,859
(Sniffing)

2427
01:28:10,829 --> 01:28:12,428
Can't you smell the incense from here?

2428
01:28:12,429 --> 01:28:13,658
- The incense is too strong. - It's from the top floor.

2429
01:28:13,659 --> 01:28:15,198
This is strong enough to receive a complaint.

2430
01:28:15,199 --> 01:28:16,399
Seriously.

2431
01:28:17,099 --> 01:28:18,339
It's way too strong right now.

2432
01:28:18,999 --> 01:28:22,909
(The shaman's place is fake as the incense was too strong?)

2433
01:28:23,239 --> 01:28:24,339
Hello.

2434
01:28:24,979 --> 01:28:26,779
- Hello. - Hello.

2435
01:28:27,479 --> 01:28:28,848
- Hello. - Does it usually...

2436
01:28:28,849 --> 01:28:30,179
smell like incense here?

2437
01:28:30,479 --> 01:28:31,578
I can smell the incense only today.

2438
01:28:31,579 --> 01:28:32,818
- Right? - Just today?

2439
01:28:32,819 --> 01:28:34,348
- What? - Just today?

2440
01:28:34,349 --> 01:28:36,288
"I can smell the incense only today."

2441
01:28:36,289 --> 01:28:37,289
Right.

2442
01:28:37,489 --> 01:28:39,618
- We got them. - This place is 100-percent fake.

2443
01:28:39,619 --> 01:28:41,628
- We got you. - We did it.

2444
01:28:41,629 --> 01:28:43,069
- We did it. - We certainly got you.

2445
01:28:43,589 --> 01:28:44,628
There's no doubt.

2446
01:28:44,629 --> 01:28:46,828
- That was an important question. - She could smell it only today.

2447
01:28:46,829 --> 01:28:47,829
- What a relief. - Right.

2448
01:28:47,830 --> 01:28:49,768
Kyoung Pyo asked a really important question.

2449
01:28:49,769 --> 01:28:50,968
"Does it usually smell like incense here?"

2450
01:28:50,969 --> 01:28:52,875
- "I can smell it..." - I'm desperate right now.

2451
01:28:52,899 --> 01:28:54,909
I don't want to get sued in February.

2452
01:28:55,639 --> 01:28:57,568
I don't want my pancreas to be in bad condition.

2453
01:28:57,569 --> 01:28:59,209
I don't want to be careful with my words.

2454
01:28:59,639 --> 01:29:01,348
You don't want to take care of your health.

2455
01:29:01,349 --> 01:29:02,349
(Desperately denying his bad fortune)

2456
01:29:02,350 --> 01:29:03,478
That was hilarious.

2457
01:29:03,479 --> 01:29:06,848
We have to suspect the previous places too.

2458
01:29:06,849 --> 01:29:07,849
Right.

2459
01:29:07,850 --> 01:29:09,618
Let's go through them again.

2460
01:29:09,619 --> 01:29:11,019
- We have to be objective. - Right.

2461
01:29:11,459 --> 01:29:13,089
What do you all think?

2462
01:29:13,719 --> 01:29:16,629
If my junior Jin Hwan turns out to be fake,

2463
01:29:17,089 --> 01:29:18,128
that would be shocking.

2464
01:29:18,129 --> 01:29:19,598
I think it'll be a great shock.

2465
01:29:19,599 --> 01:29:21,468
If I am to give up on one spot,

2466
01:29:21,469 --> 01:29:22,989
I think the second place will be real.

2467
01:29:23,329 --> 01:29:24,898
(From a comedian...)

2468
01:29:24,899 --> 01:29:26,869
- His attitude and skills felt real. - Right.

2469
01:29:27,339 --> 01:29:30,468
(Attitude and skills of an experienced chef...)

2470
01:29:30,469 --> 01:29:33,479
(that seemed to have been around for a while)

2471
01:29:34,509 --> 01:29:36,349
But with Jin Hwan,

2472
01:29:36,609 --> 01:29:38,978
I remember seeing him on TV...

2473
01:29:38,979 --> 01:29:40,618
and saying he ran a restaurant.

2474
01:29:40,619 --> 01:29:43,518
Really? I heard he ran a snack bar.

2475
01:29:43,519 --> 01:29:45,518
If he ran a snack bar,

2476
01:29:45,519 --> 01:29:48,058
he might've been able to do that...

2477
01:29:48,059 --> 01:29:50,128
with a bit of practice and preparation.

2478
01:29:50,129 --> 01:29:53,158
But wasn't ZINGER's place the easiest place to set up?

2479
01:29:53,159 --> 01:29:54,258
- Right. - Right.

2480
01:29:54,259 --> 01:29:55,268
You're right.

2481
01:29:55,269 --> 01:29:58,038
(From a Secret member...)

2482
01:29:58,039 --> 01:30:00,869
(to a future kimchi stew restaurant owner?)

2483
01:30:01,669 --> 01:30:04,408
(Can't it be ZINGER pretending to be working...)

2484
01:30:04,409 --> 01:30:07,109
(at the already popular kimchi stew restaurant?)

2485
01:30:07,409 --> 01:30:10,208
But that place felt like too much of a stretch too.

2486
01:30:10,209 --> 01:30:11,548
- Why? - To set things up there.

2487
01:30:11,549 --> 01:30:12,978
- I see. - Sook is known...

2488
01:30:12,979 --> 01:30:14,618
to be a regular there.

2489
01:30:14,619 --> 01:30:15,789
Right.

2490
01:30:16,249 --> 01:30:23,488
(ZINGER and Sook's encounter was hard to set up?)

2491
01:30:23,489 --> 01:30:24,998
Sook went there recently,

2492
01:30:24,999 --> 01:30:26,839
and I think she did tell me she met her there.

2493
01:30:27,199 --> 01:30:28,498
But I'm not sure if that was ZINGER.

2494
01:30:28,499 --> 01:30:30,599
I don't really pay attention to what she says.

2495
01:30:31,029 --> 01:30:33,839
- I'm not sure. - You should listen to her.

2496
01:30:34,739 --> 01:30:36,538
- Listen to her. - She gave me a call.

2497
01:30:36,539 --> 01:30:37,539
She said, "I'm going to get some kimchi stew to go."

2498
01:30:37,539 --> 01:30:38,539
"Do you want some too?"

2499
01:30:38,540 --> 01:30:40,839
I said, "No. I already ate." She came back...

2500
01:30:40,939 --> 01:30:41,948
to eat the food she got.

2501
01:30:41,949 --> 01:30:43,078
I went to her,

2502
01:30:43,079 --> 01:30:44,548
and she said she saw someone.

2503
01:30:44,549 --> 01:30:46,578
I'm not sure if that was ZINGER,

2504
01:30:46,579 --> 01:30:48,348
but I do remember her saying that she saw someone.

2505
01:30:48,349 --> 01:30:51,158
But if that was a month ago...

2506
01:30:51,159 --> 01:30:52,358
That could've happened a month ago for this.

2507
01:30:52,359 --> 01:30:54,258
Right. That could be the case.

2508
01:30:54,259 --> 01:30:55,388
(A situation set up beforehand to fool the members?)

2509
01:30:55,389 --> 01:30:58,198
The third place felt fake to me...

2510
01:30:58,199 --> 01:31:00,058
because he lost to me.

2511
01:31:00,059 --> 01:31:01,059
Right.

2512
01:31:01,060 --> 01:31:03,069
- He was a pro gamer but lost. - Right.

2513
01:31:03,999 --> 01:31:05,638
(Shaman...)

2514
01:31:05,639 --> 01:31:08,039
(and pro gamer with two jobs?)

2515
01:31:08,339 --> 01:31:10,939
(Dong Yoon won against the former top ranker?)

2516
01:31:11,109 --> 01:31:13,108
(He's a former top ranker, )

2517
01:31:13,109 --> 01:31:14,978
(but he lost to Dong Yoon who's an amateur?)

2518
01:31:14,979 --> 01:31:16,778
He might've lost after being easy on him...

2519
01:31:16,779 --> 01:31:18,718
- as it wasn't an actual match. - Right.

2520
01:31:18,719 --> 01:31:21,888
The production crew might've asked him to lose.

2521
01:31:21,889 --> 01:31:23,519
- To confuse us. - To confuse us.

2522
01:31:23,919 --> 01:31:25,588
He didn't feel competitive...

2523
01:31:25,589 --> 01:31:27,019
even though he was a pro gamer.

2524
01:31:27,489 --> 01:31:29,358
It felt like he was going to lose on purpose.

2525
01:31:29,359 --> 01:31:32,558
- He slightly... - But his lips did wriggle.

2526
01:31:32,559 --> 01:31:34,258
- Really? - He did seem flustered.

2527
01:31:34,259 --> 01:31:35,298
His lips went like this.

2528
01:31:35,299 --> 01:31:36,628
- When did you see that? - He did seem flustered.

2529
01:31:36,629 --> 01:31:38,398
I kept looking at him.

2530
01:31:38,399 --> 01:31:39,839
- His lips wriggled? - "It's okay."

2531
01:31:40,969 --> 01:31:42,808
(Unable to stay still)

2532
01:31:42,809 --> 01:31:44,908
(He lips looked anxious, )

2533
01:31:44,909 --> 01:31:47,079
(and Mimi saw him.)

2534
01:31:47,379 --> 01:31:48,778
Which place do you think is fake, Mimi?

2535
01:31:48,779 --> 01:31:51,419
I think it's the 1st place or 3rd place.

2536
01:31:51,979 --> 01:31:54,278
- The 1st place or 3rd place. - What about you, Kyoung Pyo?

2537
01:31:54,279 --> 01:31:56,719
Obviously, I do wish the third place to be fake.

2538
01:31:58,419 --> 01:32:01,558
- He's bothered about what he said. - He said a lot of bad things.

2539
01:32:01,559 --> 01:32:03,728
- What do we do? - This is hard.

2540
01:32:03,729 --> 01:32:05,328
You said that you were confident, Dong Yoon.

2541
01:32:05,329 --> 01:32:06,399
- Yes. - Right.

2542
01:32:06,959 --> 01:32:07,969
I will...

2543
01:32:09,029 --> 01:32:11,169
(Which place will Dong Yoon pick?)

2544
01:32:12,299 --> 01:32:13,539
go with the third place.

2545
01:32:14,339 --> 01:32:15,339
You said you got it right in the first season, right?

2546
01:32:15,339 --> 01:32:16,339
I did.

2547
01:32:16,340 --> 01:32:17,409
- Number three. - Yes.

2548
01:32:17,669 --> 01:32:19,038
He didn't feel like a gamer.

2549
01:32:19,039 --> 01:32:20,108
Was he not a gamer?

2550
01:32:20,109 --> 01:32:21,109
He didn't feel like one.

2551
01:32:22,349 --> 01:32:24,378
(EXchange, LIFEchange)

2552
01:32:24,379 --> 01:32:25,418
"LIFEchange."

2553
01:32:25,419 --> 01:32:27,549
- I think it's the 3rd or 1st place. - Right.

2554
01:32:28,519 --> 01:32:30,188
(This time, you must suspect hot figures instead of food.)

2555
01:32:30,189 --> 01:32:31,418
We have to suspect people now.

2556
01:32:31,419 --> 01:32:32,819
- Gosh. - It was really hard.

2557
01:32:33,789 --> 01:32:34,789
Gangnam.

2558
01:32:35,529 --> 01:32:38,529
(The ones who moved on to a new life from their ex-life)

2559
01:32:39,329 --> 01:32:41,629
(I wasn't sure what I was good at and what I had to do.)

2560
01:32:41,929 --> 01:32:43,629
(I was trapped in confusion.)

2561
01:32:44,669 --> 01:32:46,269
(What would people like?)

2562
01:32:47,139 --> 01:32:48,208
(I'm always concerned about that.)

2563
01:32:48,209 --> 01:32:49,649
Don't tell me it's the second place.

2564
01:32:49,869 --> 01:32:51,169
(That can't be true.)

2565
01:32:52,009 --> 01:32:54,509
(We will meet if it's our fate.)

2566
01:32:54,649 --> 01:32:56,548
(That's about it.)

2567
01:32:56,549 --> 01:32:58,318
Losing to Dong Yoon in the game...

2568
01:32:58,319 --> 01:32:59,678
- amplified our suspicion. - Right.

2569
01:32:59,679 --> 01:33:00,679
Right.

2570
01:33:01,419 --> 01:33:03,949
(Their new lives that didn't feel real)

2571
01:33:04,189 --> 01:33:06,959
(An idol star who was popular in 2010...)

2572
01:33:07,289 --> 01:33:09,559
(to a future kimchi stew restaurant owner)

2573
01:33:10,429 --> 01:33:12,299
I really have no idea.

2574
01:33:12,659 --> 01:33:14,868
(A comedian who made people laugh...)

2575
01:33:14,869 --> 01:33:17,568
I remember watching that.

2576
01:33:17,569 --> 01:33:19,239
(to a high-end omakase chef)

2577
01:33:19,569 --> 01:33:22,109
(Nonsense chef who was a former comedian)

2578
01:33:23,069 --> 01:33:24,879
- What? - What?

2579
01:33:25,109 --> 01:33:27,339
That can't be fake.

2580
01:33:27,479 --> 01:33:29,209
- That looks real. - That's real.

2581
01:33:29,809 --> 01:33:32,349
(From a pro gamer who reads the flow of the game...)

2582
01:33:32,919 --> 01:33:35,388
(to a shaman who reads lives, two different lives)

2583
01:33:35,389 --> 01:33:38,058
(Deity of Games, shaman)

2584
01:33:38,059 --> 01:33:40,458
- He might not be a shaman. - Right.

2585
01:33:40,459 --> 01:33:42,528
- It doesn't matter what it is! - Please!

2586
01:33:42,529 --> 01:33:44,689
- Let's just get it right! - Let's get it right today!

2587
01:33:44,799 --> 01:33:46,529
I have no idea.

2588
01:33:47,099 --> 01:33:49,829
(Which hot figure is the one fooling you?)

2589
01:33:50,329 --> 01:33:51,698
- Please! - Please!

2590
01:33:51,699 --> 01:33:52,699
(Please be right.)

2591
01:33:52,700 --> 01:33:53,869
Please!

2592
01:33:54,099 --> 01:33:55,908
(We want to...)

2593
01:33:55,909 --> 01:33:57,839
(get it right.)

2594
01:33:58,409 --> 01:34:01,648
(Which person has gone through the fake LIFEchange?)

2595
01:34:01,649 --> 01:34:02,849
It might be ZINGER.

2596
01:34:03,379 --> 01:34:04,978
I suddenly have a feeling it might be her.

2597
01:34:04,979 --> 01:34:05,979
(Heart pounding)

2598
01:34:05,979 --> 01:34:06,979
Is it ZINGER?

2599
01:34:06,980 --> 01:34:08,125
(Is ZINGER the one that's fake?)

2600
01:34:08,149 --> 01:34:10,789
(Or is it number 2 that no one expected to be fake?)

2601
01:34:11,189 --> 01:34:15,028
(The members chose number 3, the Deity of Games.)

2602
01:34:15,029 --> 01:34:17,715
(It will be revealed now.)

2603
01:34:17,740 --> 01:34:20,080
- What? - What?

2604
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:22,979
Enjoy your meal.

2605
01:34:22,980 --> 01:34:24,049
It's ZINGER.

2606
01:34:24,050 --> 01:34:25,849
(Future owner who was a former idol star, fake)

2607
01:34:25,850 --> 01:34:26,879
What?

2608
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:28,380
(Screaming)

2609
01:34:28,590 --> 01:34:29,650
It was ZINGER.

2610
01:34:30,020 --> 01:34:31,189
Really?

2611
01:34:31,190 --> 01:34:32,996
(Zinger, the one they trusted, was on the production crew's side.)

2612
01:34:33,020 --> 01:34:35,119
(Startled)

2613
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:36,390
This is a big shock.

2614
01:34:38,330 --> 01:34:40,560
(Shocked eyes)

2615
01:34:42,730 --> 01:34:44,400
So did Sook...

2616
01:34:44,530 --> 01:34:46,640
actually meet her?

2617
01:34:46,970 --> 01:34:48,810
That happened a while ago.

2618
01:34:50,110 --> 01:34:52,609
(Two months before the shoot in Gangnam)

2619
01:34:52,610 --> 01:34:54,910
- "Two months ago?" - This is driving me insane!

2620
01:34:54,980 --> 01:34:57,709
Why are you going this far?

2621
01:34:57,710 --> 01:34:59,620
How can it go back to two months ago?

2622
01:35:00,580 --> 01:35:03,050
(The production crew is secretly meeting with...)

2623
01:35:04,020 --> 01:35:05,960
(Secret's ZINGER.)

2624
01:35:06,460 --> 01:35:08,629
So what we expect is...

2625
01:35:08,630 --> 01:35:10,459
(Hesitating)

2626
01:35:10,460 --> 01:35:11,829
The reason why...

2627
01:35:11,830 --> 01:35:15,230
we are making this offer very carefully is because...

2628
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:17,769
we want everyone to feel...

2629
01:35:17,770 --> 01:35:19,899
that you are actually working part-time.

2630
01:35:19,900 --> 01:35:22,370
It's our goal to make people feel that through our show.

2631
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:26,539
It will be a tough challenge...

2632
01:35:26,540 --> 01:35:27,909
and offer to take.

2633
01:35:27,910 --> 01:35:30,309
We are very careful about it...

2634
01:35:30,310 --> 01:35:33,079
and wonder what you think. It's fine for you to turn it down.

2635
01:35:33,080 --> 01:35:34,296
(What will ZINGER say to the offer made carefully?)

2636
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:35,990
I love the idea.

2637
01:35:37,050 --> 01:35:39,420
I have to enjoy everything I do.

2638
01:35:39,660 --> 01:35:40,719
I'll try my best.

2639
01:35:40,720 --> 01:35:42,290
(She easily accepts the tough offer.)

2640
01:35:42,530 --> 01:35:44,130
- Awesome. - Awesome!

2641
01:35:44,690 --> 01:35:46,659
- She did that for 2 months? - She did that for 2 months?

2642
01:35:46,660 --> 01:35:48,629
She's amazing.

2643
01:35:48,630 --> 01:35:52,170
I've been having vague thoughts...

2644
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:55,240
of being able to be back on TV.

2645
01:35:55,870 --> 01:35:57,209
That was where I was at,

2646
01:35:57,210 --> 01:35:58,940
and it was such a grateful offer.

2647
01:36:00,540 --> 01:36:03,580
(The reason ZINGER accepted this offer)

2648
01:36:05,180 --> 01:36:07,380
I should do this even if I get this much screentime.

2649
01:36:07,850 --> 01:36:08,920
I can do it.

2650
01:36:09,650 --> 01:36:10,650
I'll try my best.

2651
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:13,519
- Thank you. - I should thank you.

2652
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:14,989
- This will be fun. - I see.

2653
01:36:14,990 --> 01:36:16,030
I understand her.

2654
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:18,329
She's amazing for accepting to do this.

2655
01:36:18,330 --> 01:36:20,600
- She's amazing. - Seriously.

2656
01:36:21,100 --> 01:36:22,800
You can feel her desperation.

2657
01:36:23,930 --> 01:36:26,600
(That was how ZINGER's fake LIFEchange began.)

2658
01:36:26,770 --> 01:36:29,440
- Hello. - Hello.

2659
01:36:29,670 --> 01:36:31,309
I'm here as a part-timer.

2660
01:36:31,310 --> 01:36:33,439
Gosh. Thank you for coming.

2661
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:34,639
(The experienced owner who has worked with many part-timers)

2662
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:36,079
Wasn't her acting great too?

2663
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:37,479
- Yes. - Right.

2664
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:40,079
Two types of stews. How many rice bowls are served?

2665
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:41,279
- Three. - Three.

2666
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:43,349
(Getting orders, side dish prep, menu explanation, serving)

2667
01:36:43,350 --> 01:36:45,719
(She went through the exact process of the part-timer training.)

2668
01:36:45,720 --> 01:36:48,320
Make sure the seasoning is mixed thoroughly.

2669
01:36:49,090 --> 01:36:50,359
This is a big shock.

2670
01:36:50,360 --> 01:36:51,960
(She also learned all recipes.)

2671
01:36:52,130 --> 01:36:54,199
She studied everything in the kitchen too.

2672
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:56,299
So when she was asked what was inside,

2673
01:36:56,300 --> 01:36:57,499
she was able to tell us.

2674
01:36:57,500 --> 01:36:59,199
- Right. - That's how it's calculated.

2675
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:01,500
- So 5 of them would be 55 dollars. - That's 55 dollars.

2676
01:37:02,370 --> 01:37:04,209
She's amazing for being able to go through all of that.

2677
01:37:04,210 --> 01:37:05,779
She's amazing.

2678
01:37:05,780 --> 01:37:06,956
(Ready to make her LIFEchange as a part-timer)

2679
01:37:06,980 --> 01:37:08,039
It must've been tough for her.

2680
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:10,279
- She went through so much for this. - She really went through a lot.

2681
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:11,400
She did that for two months?

2682
01:37:12,150 --> 01:37:14,349
I'm going to work right now.

2683
01:37:14,350 --> 01:37:17,650
I will make sure to do well once again today.

2684
01:37:17,750 --> 01:37:18,989
That was my second session.

2685
01:37:18,990 --> 01:37:21,160
That was my 3rd session. That was my 4th session.

2686
01:37:22,090 --> 01:37:25,399
(ZINGER worked hard for two months.)

2687
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:26,829
Where should I serve this one?

2688
01:37:26,830 --> 01:37:28,399
She worked with sincerity.

2689
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:29,899
(Diligent ZINGER worked a lot more...)

2690
01:37:29,900 --> 01:37:31,460
(than the production crew had planned.)

2691
01:37:31,530 --> 01:37:33,539
- You're doing amazing. - She's a true veteran now.

2692
01:37:33,540 --> 01:37:35,639
That's just amazing.

2693
01:37:35,640 --> 01:37:37,786
(She became a veteran part-timer after working with sincerity.)

2694
01:37:37,810 --> 01:37:39,079
(The time that ZINGER has worked)

2695
01:37:39,080 --> 01:37:41,039
(A total of 8 weeks with more than 3 days a week)

2696
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:42,349
(Around 288 hours)

2697
01:37:42,350 --> 01:37:44,849
- More than three days a week? - Really?

2698
01:37:44,850 --> 01:37:46,580
This feels quite touching.

2699
01:37:47,550 --> 01:37:48,749
- Gosh. - That's amazing.

2700
01:37:48,750 --> 01:37:50,849
We should clap for ZINGER.

2701
01:37:50,850 --> 01:37:53,219
(You're amazing, ZINGER.)

2702
01:37:53,220 --> 01:37:55,789
- She was flawless. - She was completely flawless.

2703
01:37:55,790 --> 01:37:56,959
Even with our suspicion,

2704
01:37:56,960 --> 01:37:59,259
it felt real as she did such a good job.

2705
01:37:59,260 --> 01:38:02,100
- She went through so much. - She really went through so much.

2706
01:38:03,030 --> 01:38:04,469
- Thank you. - Enjoy your meal.

2707
01:38:04,470 --> 01:38:05,999
Are you ZINGER?

2708
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,639
Oh, yes.

2709
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:10,270
(She was able to make herself known to the customers.)

2710
01:38:10,470 --> 01:38:12,239
There were a lot of customers that recognized her.

2711
01:38:12,240 --> 01:38:14,200
(There were many reports of people spotting her.)

2712
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:20,280
(She became a hot figure on social media.)

2713
01:38:20,450 --> 01:38:22,819
The viewers will be really surprised.

2714
01:38:22,820 --> 01:38:24,320
This is just amazing.

2715
01:38:24,490 --> 01:38:26,419
(Hold on! Are you ready to be even more surprised?)

2716
01:38:26,420 --> 01:38:27,760
What else is there?

2717
01:38:28,460 --> 01:38:31,290
(The reliable supporter of ZINGER and the production crew)

2718
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:34,560
Hey!

2719
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:35,829
Gosh.

2720
01:38:35,830 --> 01:38:37,669
- You even have an apron on? - I'm doing well, right?

2721
01:38:37,670 --> 01:38:39,699
Yes. It looks good on me, right? My goodness.

2722
01:38:39,700 --> 01:38:40,769
- We have a beautiful visitor. - It's Hyo Seong!

2723
01:38:40,770 --> 01:38:41,870
It's Hyo Seong.

2724
01:38:42,110 --> 01:38:44,909
(Why did Hyo Seong visit the kimchi stew restaurant?)

2725
01:38:44,910 --> 01:38:47,209
We are trying to expose her to the viewers...

2726
01:38:47,210 --> 01:38:49,649
after making posts of her on Instagram.

2727
01:38:49,650 --> 01:38:50,709
I see.

2728
01:38:50,710 --> 01:38:53,019
For us to do that, we need her best friend's help.

2729
01:38:53,020 --> 01:38:54,420
(Okay. I got it.)

2730
01:38:54,750 --> 01:38:56,949
- They even worked on that. - Gosh.

2731
01:38:56,950 --> 01:38:58,219
(What will happen if she gets posted on social media?)

2732
01:38:58,220 --> 01:39:00,419
- This was done so thoroughly. - That's amazing.

2733
01:39:00,420 --> 01:39:01,420
What should I do?

2734
01:39:01,421 --> 01:39:02,789
(Taking a fake picture right away)

2735
01:39:02,790 --> 01:39:03,790
(After getting the picture ready...)

2736
01:39:03,791 --> 01:39:05,090
- My goodness. - Gosh.

2737
01:39:05,430 --> 01:39:06,559
"Good luck, my Ha Na."

2738
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:08,030
- Something like this, right? - Yes.

2739
01:39:08,500 --> 01:39:10,169
(ZINGER's part-timer story was revealed to 710,000 people.)

2740
01:39:10,170 --> 01:39:12,800
She posted that she ate at ZINGER's kimchi stew place.

2741
01:39:13,870 --> 01:39:14,969
September 14.

2742
01:39:14,970 --> 01:39:18,340
- She did change the date. - The date was changed.

2743
01:39:18,440 --> 01:39:20,239
That felt real.

2744
01:39:20,240 --> 01:39:21,609
(The fake autograph felt real.)

2745
01:39:21,610 --> 01:39:24,109
(That wasn't it.)

2746
01:39:24,110 --> 01:39:26,079
- My goodness. - There was more?

2747
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:27,149
There was more?

2748
01:39:27,150 --> 01:39:29,319
(Out of the many autographs, )

2749
01:39:29,320 --> 01:39:31,790
(another person got into the eyes of the production crew.)

2750
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:34,660
(It was Kim Sook!)

2751
01:39:34,860 --> 01:39:36,430
- What? - Right.

2752
01:39:37,430 --> 01:39:38,959
(This place is scaring me now.)

2753
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:41,029
This was done so thoroughly.

2754
01:39:41,030 --> 01:39:43,230
(Tapping)

2755
01:39:43,430 --> 01:39:44,430
(Putting it into action after obtaining the information)

2756
01:39:44,431 --> 01:39:46,300
No way.

2757
01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:50,170
(It's time to invade CEO Song's daily life.)

2758
01:39:51,410 --> 01:39:52,909
That happened a month ago.

2759
01:39:52,910 --> 01:39:54,739
(Can you tell CEO Song that you saw...)

2760
01:39:54,740 --> 01:39:56,480
(ZINGER working at the kimchi stew place?)

2761
01:39:56,650 --> 01:39:58,509
So she did tell you about it.

2762
01:39:58,510 --> 01:40:01,150
I didn't pay attention.

2763
01:40:01,320 --> 01:40:03,419
That was why I didn't remember who she said it was.

2764
01:40:03,420 --> 01:40:06,089
- So it was ZINGER. - That's amazing.

2765
01:40:06,090 --> 01:40:08,160
You should listen to her.

2766
01:40:08,620 --> 01:40:11,030
She was talking while smacking her lips.

2767
01:40:11,430 --> 01:40:12,759
For some reason, she kept calling me...

2768
01:40:12,760 --> 01:40:14,629
and recommending the food that day.

2769
01:40:14,630 --> 01:40:17,130
- I see. - She was extra kind that day.

2770
01:40:17,730 --> 01:40:19,369
(Another reason ZINGER accepted this offer...)

2771
01:40:19,370 --> 01:40:20,800
(that was refused by a few)

2772
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:23,209
Right before my career stopped,

2773
01:40:23,210 --> 01:40:25,639
I got an autograph from Jae Seok.

2774
01:40:25,640 --> 01:40:26,940
On that autograph, he wrote,

2775
01:40:27,080 --> 01:40:29,350
"Ha Na, let's surely meet again."

2776
01:40:30,650 --> 01:40:31,679
I got the autograph laminated...

2777
01:40:31,680 --> 01:40:33,879
- and kept it on my vanity table. - Really?

2778
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:35,619
I should get that autograph...

2779
01:40:35,620 --> 01:40:37,249
and tell him,

2780
01:40:37,250 --> 01:40:38,960
"We finally met again!"

2781
01:40:39,090 --> 01:40:41,620
- Right. She showed me that earlier. - She looked emotional.

2782
01:40:42,230 --> 01:40:45,029
(Jae Seok encouraged her 10 years ago.)

2783
01:40:45,030 --> 01:40:46,159
- We met each other here. - Right.

2784
01:40:46,160 --> 01:40:50,170
(ZINGER wanted to keep the promise they made 10 years ago.)

2785
01:40:50,730 --> 01:40:53,399
After working at the kimchi stew place,

2786
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:56,270
I realized that I spent every single day to the full.

2787
01:40:56,510 --> 01:40:59,040
Welcome. Feel free to sit anywhere.

2788
01:40:59,180 --> 01:41:00,540
Will you move inside?

2789
01:41:00,940 --> 01:41:03,549
I believe I can work even harder with my own work...

2790
01:41:03,550 --> 01:41:06,120
with confidence in the future.

2791
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:09,719
Gosh, I'm free! Yes!

2792
01:41:09,720 --> 01:41:11,790
(What are your future plans?)

2793
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:14,290
I'm working hard as a beauty creator,

2794
01:41:14,460 --> 01:41:16,360
and I'm doing my best to record music.

2795
01:41:16,530 --> 01:41:18,159
I believe I might be able...

2796
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:20,460
to come back with some good news soon.

2797
01:41:21,100 --> 01:41:22,499
Look forward to it.

2798
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:25,669
This was ZINGER who lived a fake life.

2799
01:41:25,670 --> 01:41:27,099
Thank you!

2800
01:41:27,100 --> 01:41:29,440
(A successful end to the LIFEchange)

2801
01:41:29,610 --> 01:41:32,069
Sixth Sense, I was the fake one.

2802
01:41:32,070 --> 01:41:34,239
(Future owner and former idol star full of secrets, fake)

2803
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:35,539
- Gosh! - I got emotional.

2804
01:41:35,540 --> 01:41:36,709
- Right. - Right.

2805
01:41:36,710 --> 01:41:39,019
Her hard work was what fooled us.

2806
01:41:39,020 --> 01:41:40,020
- Right. - Right.

2807
01:41:40,020 --> 01:41:41,020
- Dong Yoon. - Yes?

2808
01:41:41,021 --> 01:41:42,849
It was different from the previous season, right?

2809
01:41:42,850 --> 01:41:45,249
- There was a big upgrade. - Gosh.

2810
01:41:45,250 --> 01:41:47,719
At the start, he said he was worried that he would get it right away.

2811
01:41:47,720 --> 01:41:50,260
- I really felt that way. - He really said that to us.

2812
01:41:50,630 --> 01:41:53,559
- This is a real shock to me. - It was so confusing.

2813
01:41:53,560 --> 01:41:54,859
So that guy...

2814
01:41:54,860 --> 01:41:56,199
- really was a fortune teller? - He's very famous.

2815
01:41:56,200 --> 01:41:59,070
Could you send me the things he said to me?

2816
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:00,969
There might be things I have forgotten.

2817
01:42:00,970 --> 01:42:02,769
You should remind yourself after watching the show again.

2818
01:42:02,770 --> 01:42:04,909
My gosh! It was so...

2819
01:42:04,910 --> 01:42:05,910
(He surrenders to what the fortune teller said in the end.)

2820
01:42:05,911 --> 01:42:07,839
Dong Yoon won't be able to be free from this too.

2821
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:08,879
- Right. - Right.

2822
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:10,549
- I hope it's not me. - Gosh.

2823
01:42:10,550 --> 01:42:12,779
It was so hard today.

2824
01:42:12,780 --> 01:42:13,979
It would be great if Mimi gets picked.

2825
01:42:13,980 --> 01:42:15,849
- That would be amazing. - It should be you, Dong Yoon.

2826
01:42:15,850 --> 01:42:18,020
Gosh! This time...

2827
01:42:18,490 --> 01:42:20,820
(It's Mimi again?)

2828
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:23,460
It's Jae Seok.

2829
01:42:25,530 --> 01:42:26,559
I don't have an account.

2830
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:28,729
- Jae Seok! - Jae Seok!

2831
01:42:28,730 --> 01:42:30,399
You should send a cringe message to Seok Jin or Kwang Soo...

2832
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:32,439
and don't explain about it for 24 hours.

2833
01:42:32,440 --> 01:42:35,139
- Jae Seok! - I don't send those messages.

2834
01:42:35,140 --> 01:42:37,809
- But I think Seok Jin... - I can't do this.

2835
01:42:37,810 --> 01:42:39,340
Will get touched by it.

2836
01:42:39,510 --> 01:42:41,109
(Getting a headache)

2837
01:42:41,110 --> 01:42:43,050
He might even cry.

2838
01:42:43,310 --> 01:42:46,450
Even if he calls back right away, you can't say anything.

2839
01:42:46,620 --> 01:42:49,149
(Kwang Soo isn't stupid)

2840
01:42:49,150 --> 01:42:50,919
(Kwang Soo, it felt like yesterday since we've known each other, )

2841
01:42:50,920 --> 01:42:52,919
(but so much time has passed.)

2842
01:42:52,920 --> 01:42:54,659
(Let's keep our friendship strong. I love you, Kwang Soo.)

2843
01:42:54,660 --> 01:42:57,229
(What?)

2844
01:42:57,230 --> 01:42:58,859
(Laughing)

2845
01:42:58,860 --> 01:43:00,529
(What is all this, Jae Seok?)

2846
01:43:00,554 --> 01:43:05,076
(Jae Seok didn't say anything about it for 24 hours.)

2847
01:43:05,177 --> 01:43:07,356
(Uijeongbu, Dobong-gu, Gangnam-gu)

2848
01:43:08,197 --> 01:43:09,236
(It's going down.)

2849
01:43:09,237 --> 01:43:10,397
(Down the Jungnang Stream...)

2850
01:43:10,667 --> 01:43:11,707
(for the fifth City Tour)

2851
01:43:11,907 --> 01:43:13,177
(Anything Road)

2852
01:43:13,537 --> 01:43:15,007
(Amazed)

2853
01:43:15,377 --> 01:43:16,377
(Astonished)

2854
01:43:17,307 --> 01:43:19,347
(A hot place that does this with anything for you?)

2855
01:43:19,577 --> 01:43:20,717
(There's a place like this?)

2856
01:43:21,017 --> 01:43:22,847
(It's really this place?)

2857
01:43:23,087 --> 01:43:24,747
(A feast of incredible ingredients?)

2858
01:43:26,817 --> 01:43:28,787
(Upon seeing eye-catching dishes, )

2859
01:43:29,087 --> 01:43:30,833
(Gen MZer Haewon approves of this hot place!)

2860
01:43:30,857 --> 01:43:31,857
(Spilling)

2861
01:43:34,898 --> 01:43:36,167
(Gosh, how sweet.)

2862
01:43:36,427 --> 01:43:37,427
Hey!

2863
01:43:37,727 --> 01:43:38,937
(Reacting back)

2864
01:43:39,237 --> 01:43:41,117
(Kyoung Pyo isn't used to getting compliments.)

2865
01:43:41,767 --> 01:43:42,806
Hey!

2866
01:43:42,807 --> 01:43:43,807
Hey!

2867
01:43:44,407 --> 01:43:46,007
(- Aren't your hands cold?) - I'm fine.)

2868
01:43:46,177 --> 01:43:47,707
(Kyoung Pyo and Hwasa's new chemistry)

2869
01:43:47,937 --> 01:43:49,307
(I will do an appearance check.)

2870
01:43:49,577 --> 01:43:50,747
(Appearance check!)

2871
01:43:50,947 --> 01:43:51,947
(Show me, Uncle!)

2872
01:43:52,147 --> 01:43:53,216
(Hey, Niece!)

2873
01:43:53,217 --> 01:43:54,697
(Calling him her dad all of a sudden)

2874
01:43:55,717 --> 01:43:57,217
(Excited)

2875
01:43:57,517 --> 01:43:58,763
(They forget about finding the fake place.)

2876
01:43:58,787 --> 01:43:59,817
(Hey, this is fun.)

2877
01:44:02,852 --> 01:44:04,052
(Next!)

2878
01:44:04,482 --> 01:44:05,682
(It's Jae Seok's turn.)

2879
01:44:06,622 --> 01:44:08,822
(Being one with the snow)

2880
01:44:09,292 --> 01:44:12,068
(The Anything Tour that makes anything fun when done together)
