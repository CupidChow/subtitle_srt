1
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,704
I haven't been here in so long.

2
00:00:19,305 --> 00:00:23,343
It's been a while since I've seen waves.

3
00:00:23,344 --> 00:00:25,073
Today's weather is perfect. We came on a good day.

4
00:00:25,074 --> 00:00:26,084
- Totally. - Totally.

5
00:00:26,085 --> 00:00:27,283
You're right.

6
00:00:27,284 --> 00:00:28,984
Oh, I love it!

7
00:00:30,585 --> 00:00:32,253
I'm getting a surge of dopamine.

8
00:00:32,254 --> 00:00:34,154
- I suddenly feel crazy. - Right?

9
00:00:34,155 --> 00:00:35,954
The ocean in the morning is so pretty.

10
00:00:35,955 --> 00:00:36,955
Seriously.

11
00:00:38,495 --> 00:00:40,495
(Busan)

12
00:00:41,224 --> 00:00:44,635
(A place where you can always see the brilliant ocean)

13
00:00:45,364 --> 00:00:47,904
(The city of film)

14
00:00:48,735 --> 00:00:51,574
(The city of delicious food)

15
00:00:52,644 --> 00:00:55,144
(The city of romance, Busan)

16
00:00:55,675 --> 00:00:56,675
(Oh, my!)

17
00:00:56,676 --> 00:00:58,375
(This is a bit scary for me.)

18
00:00:58,714 --> 00:01:02,114
(Out of the three trendy places in Busan, )

19
00:01:02,555 --> 00:01:05,684
(they must find one fake place.)

20
00:01:06,154 --> 00:01:07,324
(Never-before-seen dishes)

21
00:01:08,084 --> 00:01:09,525
(Never-before-seen scale)

22
00:01:10,154 --> 00:01:13,024
(Which place in Busan is fake?)

23
00:01:13,164 --> 00:01:14,794
It's been such a long time since I've come to Busan.

24
00:01:14,795 --> 00:01:15,893
Really?

25
00:01:15,894 --> 00:01:18,163
When I was in my 20s, I came here to have fun,

26
00:01:18,164 --> 00:01:19,503
not necessarily for work.

27
00:01:19,504 --> 00:01:21,033
- Because you wanted to. - Yes.

28
00:01:21,034 --> 00:01:22,473
You said it had been ten years for you, Kyoung Pyo.

29
00:01:22,474 --> 00:01:23,874
Yes, it's been ten years since I've come to Gwangalli.

30
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,143
I usually stay near Haeundae.

31
00:01:26,144 --> 00:01:27,443
- For film festivals. - Film festivals.

32
00:01:27,444 --> 00:01:29,074
Film festivals.

33
00:01:29,075 --> 00:01:30,413
Director Jang Hang Jun...

34
00:01:30,414 --> 00:01:31,773
- is in my agency. - Right.

35
00:01:31,774 --> 00:01:33,514
So whenever there's a film festival,

36
00:01:33,515 --> 00:01:36,314
everyone hosts CGV Night or Megabox Night,

37
00:01:36,315 --> 00:01:37,753
but we host Jang Hang Jun Night.

38
00:01:37,754 --> 00:01:38,883
- Oh, here? - Yes, we've been doing it...

39
00:01:38,884 --> 00:01:40,053
for three years.

40
00:01:40,054 --> 00:01:42,993
- Oh, that's cool. - This year will be the fourth year.

41
00:01:42,994 --> 00:01:46,893
- Hang Jun is in your agency, right? - Yes.

42
00:01:46,894 --> 00:01:49,435
Aren't you spending a lot for how much he has made?

43
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:51,663
Jang Hang Jun Night...

44
00:01:51,664 --> 00:01:53,003
must cost a lot of money.

45
00:01:53,004 --> 00:01:54,264
But that man...

46
00:01:54,265 --> 00:01:56,205
- "That man." - Oh, I'm sorry.

47
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:58,133
- Director Jang... - Yes.

48
00:01:58,134 --> 00:01:59,844
Is generous when he needs to be.

49
00:01:59,845 --> 00:02:00,845
- Oh, really? - Yes.

50
00:02:00,846 --> 00:02:02,613
Whenever Hang Jun starts a new project,

51
00:02:02,614 --> 00:02:04,143
- he calls me. - I know.

52
00:02:04,144 --> 00:02:06,414
"Jae Seok. Send me a coffee truck..."

53
00:02:06,815 --> 00:02:08,515
"or a snack food truck."

54
00:02:08,985 --> 00:02:10,684
(CEO Song bursts into laughter.)

55
00:02:10,685 --> 00:02:12,184
- Yes. - He asks you.

56
00:02:12,185 --> 00:02:13,383
- I know. - He wants to show off...

57
00:02:13,384 --> 00:02:17,195
the fact that he's close to cool people.

58
00:02:18,455 --> 00:02:20,523
- And Hang Jun... - "Isn't it such a good chance..."

59
00:02:20,524 --> 00:02:21,764
"with the cameras here?"

60
00:02:21,765 --> 00:02:23,393
- Mimi... - I want to show off too.

61
00:02:23,394 --> 00:02:25,294
- Show what off? - My friendship with you.

62
00:02:25,295 --> 00:02:27,204
- Show it off! - Show it off!

63
00:02:27,205 --> 00:02:29,534
- Show it off! - This isn't enough.

64
00:02:29,535 --> 00:02:31,474
- Really? What should we do? - I want something big.

65
00:02:31,475 --> 00:02:32,773
When you get a chance to show off,

66
00:02:32,774 --> 00:02:34,204
call me or...

67
00:02:34,205 --> 00:02:35,574
Or please come to see us when we make a comeback.

68
00:02:35,575 --> 00:02:37,213
- Nice. - I'll go to see you then.

69
00:02:37,214 --> 00:02:38,313
Okay.

70
00:02:38,314 --> 00:02:40,554
By the way, why did you flatten your hair so much today?

71
00:02:41,015 --> 00:02:42,583
- Because of the wind? - It's Gwangalli.

72
00:02:42,584 --> 00:02:43,653
Because it's Gwangalli.

73
00:02:43,654 --> 00:02:45,313
I wanted to match the mood,

74
00:02:45,314 --> 00:02:46,583
so I styled it like seaweed.

75
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:47,784
Like seaweed?

76
00:02:47,785 --> 00:02:49,294
- You flattened it like seaweed? - Yes, like seaweed.

77
00:02:49,295 --> 00:02:52,094
- Yes, seaweed... - Oh, look at this here.

78
00:02:52,295 --> 00:02:53,564
Our shadows...

79
00:02:54,064 --> 00:02:56,034
- look like statues. - What are we doing?

80
00:02:56,035 --> 00:02:57,734
We look like statues.

81
00:02:57,735 --> 00:02:58,794
We have to take a picture of this.

82
00:02:58,795 --> 00:03:00,333
- This is romance. - That's right.

83
00:03:00,334 --> 00:03:02,034
Why do we have to take a picture of this?

84
00:03:02,035 --> 00:03:03,833
- This is romance. - This is romance.

85
00:03:03,834 --> 00:03:05,174
The romance of the sea.

86
00:03:05,175 --> 00:03:06,844
I like your pose, Kyoung Pyo.

87
00:03:07,404 --> 00:03:09,674
I like taking pictures of our shadows.

88
00:03:09,675 --> 00:03:11,035
You can't see our age differences.

89
00:03:11,644 --> 00:03:13,004
You can't see our age differences.

90
00:03:13,584 --> 00:03:14,584
That's nice.

91
00:03:14,915 --> 00:03:16,384
Kyoung Pyo came early and stayed here last night.

92
00:03:16,385 --> 00:03:17,683
- Oh, really? - I came here...

93
00:03:17,684 --> 00:03:19,653
- and ate wheat noodles. - Oh, really?

94
00:03:19,654 --> 00:03:21,324
And I ate bungeoppang for the first time this year.

95
00:03:21,325 --> 00:03:22,553
- Was it good? - It was good.

96
00:03:22,554 --> 00:03:25,123
It wasn't too watery or too hard.

97
00:03:25,124 --> 00:03:26,393
- Oh, gosh. - I see.

98
00:03:26,394 --> 00:03:27,893
That's why you seem kind of puffy...

99
00:03:27,894 --> 00:03:29,093
- and kind of not. - I am.

100
00:03:29,094 --> 00:03:30,664
I am. I gained a lot of weight too.

101
00:03:30,665 --> 00:03:32,234
- You gained weight? - I'm becoming happier.

102
00:03:32,235 --> 00:03:33,963
Nice. That's all that matters.

103
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:35,363
- That's all that matters. - You need to live happily.

104
00:03:35,364 --> 00:03:36,833
- Yes. - Here is the map.

105
00:03:36,834 --> 00:03:37,834
Oh, the map.

106
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,844
- Okay. - Where is it?

107
00:03:41,374 --> 00:03:44,144
Today's theme is "The Legends of Busan."

108
00:03:44,915 --> 00:03:47,884
(Sixth Sense: Busan Tour)

109
00:03:47,885 --> 00:03:49,614
I guess we're going to the legend of Busan.

110
00:03:50,714 --> 00:03:52,284
(Legend, legendary figure, Suyeong-gu, )

111
00:03:52,285 --> 00:03:53,984
(Legend, Bread, Nam-gu)

112
00:03:53,985 --> 00:03:55,925
(Legend, Cave, Dong-gu)

113
00:03:56,094 --> 00:03:57,855
(Let us introduce the legends of Busan.)

114
00:03:58,624 --> 00:04:00,825
(There is a legendary figure who protects Busan?)

115
00:04:02,864 --> 00:04:05,165
(Legendary person)

116
00:04:05,364 --> 00:04:07,303
You have to go here when you're eating bread in Busan.

117
00:04:07,304 --> 00:04:08,904
(The best bakery?)

118
00:04:10,075 --> 00:04:12,844
(Legendary bread)

119
00:04:13,344 --> 00:04:16,614
(In the cave, a mysterious legend awakens!)

120
00:04:17,144 --> 00:04:20,083
(Legendary cave)

121
00:04:20,084 --> 00:04:24,014
(One of these three trendy places is fake.)

122
00:04:24,015 --> 00:04:26,554
(Which one is fake?)

123
00:04:26,884 --> 00:04:28,253
One of these is fake.

124
00:04:28,254 --> 00:04:29,724
I can't tell by the keywords.

125
00:04:29,725 --> 00:04:31,394
- I can't tell. - I can't tell at all.

126
00:04:31,395 --> 00:04:32,964
Busan is a really trendy place...

127
00:04:32,965 --> 00:04:34,493
- for bread right now. - Really?

128
00:04:34,494 --> 00:04:37,234
There are so many good bakeries in Busan.

129
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,394
Oh, in Busan?

130
00:04:38,395 --> 00:04:41,604
If they use a trick on the dessert today,

131
00:04:41,605 --> 00:04:44,303
- I'll be able to tell. - Mimi is a sweets expert.

132
00:04:44,304 --> 00:04:46,404
Mimi really likes cakes and other sweet things.

133
00:04:46,405 --> 00:04:48,145
- That's right. I really do. - Nice.

134
00:04:48,304 --> 00:04:50,814
(Her personal channel is full of dessert eating videos.)

135
00:04:51,314 --> 00:04:54,844
(Mimi can live without rice, but she can't live without bread.)

136
00:04:54,845 --> 00:04:56,013
- I really do. - Nice.

137
00:04:56,014 --> 00:04:57,683
- Did you search a lot again? - I did a lot.

138
00:04:57,684 --> 00:04:59,884
But what if they fool you again?

139
00:05:00,355 --> 00:05:03,595
That's why I can't trust myself as much.

140
00:05:03,795 --> 00:05:05,493
I can't trust myself.

141
00:05:05,494 --> 00:05:07,725
But unlike the other times,

142
00:05:08,364 --> 00:05:09,664
there's a special sign on the map.

143
00:05:09,665 --> 00:05:10,864
- What is it? - Here it is.

144
00:05:11,134 --> 00:05:13,063
"Meeting point?"

145
00:05:13,064 --> 00:05:15,035
Wait. What is Millac The Market?

146
00:05:15,235 --> 00:05:16,803
"Meeting point."

147
00:05:16,804 --> 00:05:18,534
- I know that place. - What kind of place is it?

148
00:05:18,535 --> 00:05:20,503
I got here yesterday, right?

149
00:05:20,504 --> 00:05:23,573
I walked to Millac The Market. Young people...

150
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:25,373
- Are there many of them there? - Yes, it's a trendy place.

151
00:05:25,374 --> 00:05:27,144
- It must be a real trendy place. - Oh, really?

152
00:05:27,145 --> 00:05:28,743
- At night, - Yes.

153
00:05:28,744 --> 00:05:30,953
They hit on people on the stairs.

154
00:05:30,954 --> 00:05:32,724
(Is that why it's trendy?)

155
00:05:32,725 --> 00:05:34,953
In Busan, they call that "kkadaegi."

156
00:05:34,954 --> 00:05:35,954
"Kkadaegi?"

157
00:05:35,955 --> 00:05:37,753
- Don't put it that way. - Bong Sun taught me.

158
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,524
Young people use that expression.

159
00:05:39,525 --> 00:05:42,024
They call hitting on someone "kkadaegi" in Busan.

160
00:05:42,025 --> 00:05:43,534
- "Kkaedagi?" - I saw them dance a lot...

161
00:05:43,535 --> 00:05:45,133
- in their chairs. - Oh, at this place?

162
00:05:45,134 --> 00:05:46,503
- Yes. I was so surprised. - Really?

163
00:05:46,504 --> 00:05:47,964
I should've come here last night.

164
00:05:47,965 --> 00:05:48,965
I was so surprised.

165
00:05:48,966 --> 00:05:50,433
Should we head that way?

166
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:51,873
- Should we start walking? - Let's go.

167
00:05:51,874 --> 00:05:53,644
- Since Kyoung Pyo has been there... - I went there yesterday.

168
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:55,873
We have to follow this road...

169
00:05:55,874 --> 00:05:57,214
- and go past that building. - Oh, really?

170
00:05:57,215 --> 00:05:58,943
- Nice. - Let's go.

171
00:05:58,944 --> 00:06:01,144
- The weather today... - It's warm.

172
00:06:01,145 --> 00:06:02,545
- I'm glad it's warm. - Yes.

173
00:06:02,884 --> 00:06:05,984
Your clothes don't look warm enough,

174
00:06:05,985 --> 00:06:07,154
but you dressed up for a reason, Mimi.

175
00:06:07,155 --> 00:06:09,594
Yes. We're in Gwangalli today.

176
00:06:09,595 --> 00:06:11,524
- I can tell... - I wanted to look good.

177
00:06:11,525 --> 00:06:13,794
- that Mimi is an active idol... - Yes.

178
00:06:13,795 --> 00:06:15,763
- because she doesn't dress warmly. - Right.

179
00:06:15,764 --> 00:06:18,735
Mimi. But your nose seems to be running.

180
00:06:18,864 --> 00:06:19,934
Are you okay?

181
00:06:20,665 --> 00:06:22,904
Gwangalli hosts a fireworks festival.

182
00:06:22,905 --> 00:06:25,503
In October... Or the first week of November?

183
00:06:25,504 --> 00:06:26,873
Isn't it near the bridge?

184
00:06:26,874 --> 00:06:28,704
- All across here. - Oh, my.

185
00:06:28,775 --> 00:06:29,914
(On autumn evenings...)

186
00:06:29,915 --> 00:06:31,545
(in Gwangalli, )

187
00:06:32,175 --> 00:06:34,645
(beautiful fireworks embroider the Busan sea.)

188
00:06:35,244 --> 00:06:37,154
It's such a magnificent sight.

189
00:06:37,155 --> 00:06:38,753
(Busan Fireworks Festival, Held early November in Gwangalli, )

190
00:06:38,754 --> 00:06:41,515
(Busan's biggest fireworks festival has 700,000 visitors every year.)

191
00:06:41,954 --> 00:06:44,225
(Every Saturday night, )

192
00:06:44,954 --> 00:06:49,165
(you can see a drone show with up to 2,000 drones.)

193
00:06:49,434 --> 00:06:51,133
- It's really... - People line up to see that.

194
00:06:51,134 --> 00:06:52,633
- A drone show is so cool. - So many.

195
00:06:52,634 --> 00:06:54,604
Wait. It's Zzang Arcade. I like that place.

196
00:06:54,605 --> 00:06:55,605
Should we go?

197
00:06:55,606 --> 00:06:57,174
Did you spend a lot of time there?

198
00:06:57,175 --> 00:06:59,073
I like Zzang Arcade.

199
00:06:59,074 --> 00:07:02,045
This area especially feels very different from before.

200
00:07:02,675 --> 00:07:04,674
Jae Seok is taking a trip down memory lane right now.

201
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:05,845
- Yes. - Seriously.

202
00:07:06,415 --> 00:07:07,415
(Nostalgic)

203
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:10,113
With his friends and with no money...

204
00:07:10,114 --> 00:07:12,313
- They wanted to have fun. - Oh, gosh.

205
00:07:12,314 --> 00:07:15,624
I came here with Seok Sam and Yong Man.

206
00:07:16,425 --> 00:07:18,895
I can have more fun now.

207
00:07:20,095 --> 00:07:22,394
I couldn't have fun then because I had no money.

208
00:07:22,395 --> 00:07:24,795
- You have money now. - Oh, gosh.

209
00:07:25,395 --> 00:07:26,863
(Passage of time is so cruel.)

210
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:28,564
- You're sad. - You're sad.

211
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,174
I could've had a lot of fun then.

212
00:07:31,175 --> 00:07:33,644
There isn't much to do, but when you're asked to go to Busan...

213
00:07:33,645 --> 00:07:36,274
- Do you see that silhouette? - Where?

214
00:07:36,275 --> 00:07:37,644
- I see it. - Oh, that glass thing?

215
00:07:37,645 --> 00:07:38,645
The glass thing.

216
00:07:38,646 --> 00:07:40,613
- Oh, I see it. - The roof.

217
00:07:40,614 --> 00:07:42,513
- That's the trendy place? - Yes.

218
00:07:42,514 --> 00:07:45,513
- Oh, my. - I can smell the ocean breeze.

219
00:07:45,514 --> 00:07:46,823
(A huge cultural complex of 7,400m²)

220
00:07:46,824 --> 00:07:49,724
There are three roofs. Oh, my.

221
00:07:49,725 --> 00:07:50,753
That's the market.

222
00:07:50,754 --> 00:07:52,863
- Is that kind of a dating bar? - A dating bar.

223
00:07:52,864 --> 00:07:55,224
The funny thing is... Well...

224
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,863
- "A dating bar." - A dating bar.

225
00:07:56,864 --> 00:07:58,394
- What? - You said they did "kkadaegi."

226
00:07:58,395 --> 00:07:59,734
We're in Busan, aren't we?

227
00:07:59,735 --> 00:08:00,965
Oh, gosh.

228
00:08:01,304 --> 00:08:03,275
(Exclaiming)

229
00:08:03,675 --> 00:08:05,803
- Gosh, seriously. - It's so big.

230
00:08:05,804 --> 00:08:07,504
- I didn't know about this place. - Same.

231
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:09,404
It feels like Europe all of a sudden.

232
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,113
I've never been here before.

233
00:08:11,114 --> 00:08:13,484
You sit here, looking outside.

234
00:08:13,485 --> 00:08:15,084
With the loud music.

235
00:08:15,085 --> 00:08:17,214
- With the loud music. - It's like a club.

236
00:08:17,215 --> 00:08:20,383
- There's a DJ booth. - Yes.

237
00:08:20,384 --> 00:08:22,084
I guess there's a market upstairs too.

238
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:23,123
Shall we get inside?

239
00:08:23,124 --> 00:08:24,155
- Shall we? - Yes.

240
00:08:24,954 --> 00:08:26,224
It's huge.

241
00:08:26,225 --> 00:08:27,394
Kyoung Pyo, that music means you're an old generation.

242
00:08:27,395 --> 00:08:29,123
Right.

243
00:08:29,124 --> 00:08:30,395
What's this?

244
00:08:30,895 --> 00:08:32,763
- Gosh. - Gosh.

245
00:08:32,764 --> 00:08:36,204
Gosh. This is really huge.

246
00:08:37,275 --> 00:08:40,303
(A lot of waiting in the peak season)

247
00:08:40,304 --> 00:08:41,343
(Romance in Gwangalli after the rainy season)

248
00:08:41,344 --> 00:08:44,175
(The hottest place in Busan now)

249
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,645
(The large stairs located at the entrance...)

250
00:08:48,084 --> 00:08:50,313
(shows Gwangan Bridge right in the front.)

251
00:08:50,314 --> 00:08:51,813
(The most crowded place in Busan)

252
00:08:51,814 --> 00:08:56,723
(It changes to an even hotter place at night.)

253
00:08:56,724 --> 00:08:58,053
(The hottest things to eat)

254
00:08:58,054 --> 00:08:59,895
(The hottest things to play with)

255
00:09:00,795 --> 00:09:02,525
(You can find everything here.)

256
00:09:04,094 --> 00:09:06,834
(The real hot place for people in Busan)

257
00:09:07,165 --> 00:09:09,364
It would be so exciting if people are dancing here.

258
00:09:09,365 --> 00:09:11,473
- That's really... - How nice.

259
00:09:11,474 --> 00:09:13,744
Gosh, I should have come here...

260
00:09:13,745 --> 00:09:15,304
with my friends.

261
00:09:15,844 --> 00:09:18,713
- It's a bummer. - It's a shame.

262
00:09:18,714 --> 00:09:21,014
I should have come here with them.

263
00:09:21,015 --> 00:09:22,813
You were not even a good dancer back then.

264
00:09:22,814 --> 00:09:24,014
- You don't need to regret it. - Still.

265
00:09:24,015 --> 00:09:25,785
I feel sorry, though.

266
00:09:26,385 --> 00:09:28,984
This is fun.

267
00:09:29,385 --> 00:09:31,323
- It's so much fun. - There are shops up here too.

268
00:09:31,324 --> 00:09:32,324
(Exclaiming)

269
00:09:32,525 --> 00:09:33,593
There are shops upstairs too.

270
00:09:33,594 --> 00:09:34,994
(If you go up the stairs)

271
00:09:34,995 --> 00:09:37,394
There are so many shops.

272
00:09:37,395 --> 00:09:39,635
This is amazing.

273
00:09:39,765 --> 00:09:41,034
Hello. What's this?

274
00:09:41,035 --> 00:09:43,433
This shop is famous for its pudding ice cream.

275
00:09:43,434 --> 00:09:46,244
Let's try this. Ice cream melon bread.

276
00:09:46,245 --> 00:09:48,074
Let's get this one too. It's melon bread.

277
00:09:48,344 --> 00:09:51,675
This is my first time here, but...

278
00:09:52,214 --> 00:09:53,713
It must be fun to work here.

279
00:09:53,714 --> 00:09:55,313
- It's fun. - Right?

280
00:09:55,314 --> 00:09:57,454
Every day, different people visit here.

281
00:09:58,484 --> 00:10:00,124
Has your number been asked by a lot of people?

282
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,045
(Has your number been asked by a lot of people?)

283
00:10:02,385 --> 00:10:04,905
- "Has your number been asked?" - "Has your number been asked?"

284
00:10:05,025 --> 00:10:06,264
You've never been asked this question before.

285
00:10:06,265 --> 00:10:08,894
Why would you ask that all of a sudden?

286
00:10:08,895 --> 00:10:10,164
- "Has your number been asked?" - Your working here...

287
00:10:10,165 --> 00:10:11,934
must make you popular.

288
00:10:12,265 --> 00:10:14,304
Would you like to have ice cream melon bread?

289
00:10:14,564 --> 00:10:15,635
I'd love to.

290
00:10:16,334 --> 00:10:18,405
What's real milk ice cream?

291
00:10:18,574 --> 00:10:20,904
- Ice cream pudding is famous. - This one and this one.

292
00:10:20,905 --> 00:10:22,785
- We'll get this and this. - One for each menu.

293
00:10:23,645 --> 00:10:27,943
(A generous amount of ice cream on melon bread and pudding)

294
00:10:27,944 --> 00:10:29,245
Thank you.

295
00:10:29,444 --> 00:10:30,583
Thank you.

296
00:10:30,584 --> 00:10:32,054
Thank you for the food.

297
00:10:32,314 --> 00:10:33,953
Are we getting only one pudding ice cream?

298
00:10:33,954 --> 00:10:35,584
Shall we get two pudding ice cream?

299
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,724
No, I'll have real milk ice cream.

300
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,054
Jae Seok.

301
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,894
Jae Seok, you could have said earlier...

302
00:10:40,895 --> 00:10:42,323
- that you wanted to have it. - Exactly.

303
00:10:42,324 --> 00:10:43,494
You had something in mind.

304
00:10:43,495 --> 00:10:45,794
Why did you pretend that you were asking our opinions?

305
00:10:45,795 --> 00:10:47,504
- Please try. - Let's eat it.

306
00:10:47,505 --> 00:10:48,564
Let's have a seat here.

307
00:10:48,964 --> 00:10:51,375
- Kyoung Pyo, try it. - It tastes so good.

308
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:53,473
(Having a spoonful)

309
00:10:53,474 --> 00:10:54,844
This tastes good.

310
00:10:55,304 --> 00:10:56,914
The ice cream is terrific.

311
00:10:56,915 --> 00:10:58,744
- This is so good. - It's so good.

312
00:10:58,745 --> 00:11:00,313
(Taking ice cream first)

313
00:11:00,314 --> 00:11:01,785
Actually,

314
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:04,254
- the view is great. - Right.

315
00:11:04,255 --> 00:11:07,353
I can see cars running on Gwangan Bridge...

316
00:11:07,354 --> 00:11:09,183
and fishing boats in the front.

317
00:11:09,184 --> 00:11:10,295
It's so nice.

318
00:11:11,554 --> 00:11:12,924
It's fantastic.

319
00:11:12,925 --> 00:11:14,563
(The view of the Gwangalli sea stretching out for miles)

320
00:11:14,564 --> 00:11:16,024
It's beautiful.

321
00:11:16,025 --> 00:11:18,895
(While everyone falls for the view, )

322
00:11:19,194 --> 00:11:21,905
(this one falls for the bread.)

323
00:11:22,064 --> 00:11:24,804
(Struggling)

324
00:11:25,275 --> 00:11:26,303
Kyoung Pyo, your mouth sticks out...

325
00:11:26,304 --> 00:11:27,574
- when you're focused. - Right.

326
00:11:28,275 --> 00:11:31,015
(Laughing)

327
00:11:31,214 --> 00:11:32,244
(Meanwhile)

328
00:11:32,245 --> 00:11:33,645
Do you have some coins?

329
00:11:34,115 --> 00:11:36,044
Gosh, you're so bad.

330
00:11:36,045 --> 00:11:38,053
- I'm good at the other one. - Can we try one more time?

331
00:11:38,054 --> 00:11:39,054
You can go ahead.

332
00:11:39,724 --> 00:11:41,353
You should press this.

333
00:11:41,354 --> 00:11:43,154
(Today's guests, Lee Sun Bin and Kang Tae Oh)

334
00:11:43,354 --> 00:11:44,424
I'm going to stick this...

335
00:11:44,425 --> 00:11:45,823
(She has bloody acting skills.)

336
00:11:45,824 --> 00:11:46,865
(Bad words)

337
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:48,223
(Mean words)

338
00:11:48,224 --> 00:11:49,794
(Hit, beat, split, crush, kill, )

339
00:11:49,795 --> 00:11:51,365
(shatter, and finger flick!)

340
00:11:51,964 --> 00:11:54,934
(Most competent in refreshing acting, Lee Sun Bin)

341
00:11:56,405 --> 00:12:00,245
(He creates a romantic story only with his gaze.)

342
00:12:01,844 --> 00:12:04,414
(If you don't touch me, )

343
00:12:04,415 --> 00:12:06,584
(your heart doesn't beat fast?)

344
00:12:07,084 --> 00:12:08,545
(That's disappointing.)

345
00:12:08,684 --> 00:12:10,844
(The return of the nation's romantic guy, Kang Tae Oh)

346
00:12:11,214 --> 00:12:13,554
(They're back with "The Potato Lab.")

347
00:12:13,885 --> 00:12:16,183
(Today, they're here to research Sixth Sense.)

348
00:12:16,184 --> 00:12:18,693
- I'm intimidated. - I'm too.

349
00:12:18,694 --> 00:12:21,093
- You told me I could count on you. - When did I say that?

350
00:12:21,094 --> 00:12:22,164
(The same age friends are squabbling from the start.)

351
00:12:22,165 --> 00:12:24,894
- Where should we go? - Here they are.

352
00:12:24,895 --> 00:12:26,141
(Sun Bin and Tae Oh are approaching the members.)

353
00:12:26,165 --> 00:12:27,704
I feel so nervous. Wait a minute.

354
00:12:27,964 --> 00:12:29,534
I feel so...

355
00:12:29,535 --> 00:12:31,135
I'm serious. Can't we go back?

356
00:12:32,204 --> 00:12:34,674
Hold on.

357
00:12:34,675 --> 00:12:35,745
(Hesitant)

358
00:12:35,905 --> 00:12:37,144
(We need to go now!)

359
00:12:37,145 --> 00:12:38,473
We need to go now.

360
00:12:38,474 --> 00:12:40,313
- Where should we go? - Hello.

361
00:12:40,314 --> 00:12:41,343
Hi.

362
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,553
- Oh, my. Welcome. - Hi, Tae Oh.

363
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,183
- Hello. - How are you?

364
00:12:45,184 --> 00:12:47,624
- It's been a long time. - Happy New Year.

365
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:50,093
Tae Oh, you're safely discharged from military service.

366
00:12:50,094 --> 00:12:51,193
It's been so long, Tae Oh.

367
00:12:51,194 --> 00:12:53,093
It's his first appearance after he was discharged.

368
00:12:53,094 --> 00:12:54,364
- I know. - That's right.

369
00:12:54,365 --> 00:12:55,963
Get in the middle now.

370
00:12:55,964 --> 00:12:57,294
- Hello. - He kept saying he was nervous...

371
00:12:57,295 --> 00:12:58,963
- that he couldn't come here. - Really?

372
00:12:58,964 --> 00:13:00,135
Yes. Gosh.

373
00:13:00,804 --> 00:13:02,164
(Abrupt)

374
00:13:02,165 --> 00:13:03,874
Tae Oh, you can have some bread if you feel nervous.

375
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,374
- Thank you. - Try it.

376
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:07,744
Cut it carefully. Watch out for your hand. It's ice cream.

377
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,103
- Is this ice cream? - Yes.

378
00:13:09,104 --> 00:13:10,674
This is the famous welcome food.

379
00:13:10,675 --> 00:13:12,473
- Welcome food. - We're welcoming you.

380
00:13:12,474 --> 00:13:13,843
How long has it been since you were discharged?

381
00:13:13,844 --> 00:13:16,145
I was discharged on March 19.

382
00:13:16,584 --> 00:13:17,953
- Last year. - That's right.

383
00:13:17,954 --> 00:13:19,714
- In 2024. - It's been quite a while.

384
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:21,654
(Still getting adjusted)

385
00:13:21,655 --> 00:13:24,724
- Shall we have a seat first? - Please sit down.

386
00:13:25,525 --> 00:13:26,593
(Staring)

387
00:13:26,594 --> 00:13:27,664
Why?

388
00:13:27,665 --> 00:13:29,995
(Staring)

389
00:13:30,295 --> 00:13:32,233
(Why are you staring at him?)

390
00:13:32,234 --> 00:13:34,703
He's so handsome.

391
00:13:34,704 --> 00:13:35,764
(Handsome)

392
00:13:35,765 --> 00:13:37,774
- I love my seat. - Time flies.

393
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,544
Eun I and Mimi happened to sit next to Tae Oh.

394
00:13:40,545 --> 00:13:41,865
(Watching Tae Oh's face up close)

395
00:13:42,245 --> 00:13:43,914
Is he also a Konkuk University graduate like you?

396
00:13:43,915 --> 00:13:46,483
- Yes, we're alumni. - That's right.

397
00:13:46,484 --> 00:13:48,284
- I see. - Yes.

398
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,014
Tae Oh sometimes...

399
00:13:50,015 --> 00:13:51,353
sends me a text message...

400
00:13:51,354 --> 00:13:54,054
asking how I am doing. So...

401
00:13:54,184 --> 00:13:56,353
I was glad to see him here.

402
00:13:56,354 --> 00:13:57,853
By the way,

403
00:13:57,854 --> 00:14:00,193
how come Tae Oh looks more mature than you?

404
00:14:00,194 --> 00:14:01,463
- I am... - You're older than him.

405
00:14:01,464 --> 00:14:03,294
- It's true I'm older. - How is he as a senior actor?

406
00:14:03,295 --> 00:14:04,964
He's warmhearted,

407
00:14:05,395 --> 00:14:08,404
and he likes to make jokes too.

408
00:14:08,405 --> 00:14:10,933
He makes younger actors feel comfortable.

409
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:12,303
- He's like that as a senior. - Right.

410
00:14:12,304 --> 00:14:13,744
But how come you look uncomfortable?

411
00:14:13,844 --> 00:14:16,915
I know. He looks uncomfortable when he's saying it.

412
00:14:17,214 --> 00:14:19,313
- Why do you feel uncomfortable? - He's an older alumnus.

413
00:14:19,314 --> 00:14:21,943
- You should relax. - Because he's an older alumnus.

414
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,053
We're filming this show in Busan today.

415
00:14:24,054 --> 00:14:25,154
I know.

416
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:28,525
I arrived here yesterday in advance.

417
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:30,323
I had wheat noodles.

418
00:14:30,324 --> 00:14:32,193
- As expected. - He had what noodles too.

419
00:14:32,194 --> 00:14:33,323
Really?

420
00:14:33,324 --> 00:14:34,593
- I had wheat noodles too. - Wheat noodles?

421
00:14:34,594 --> 00:14:35,723
- Did you have it around here? - No.

422
00:14:35,724 --> 00:14:37,794
I had it near Busan Station.

423
00:14:37,795 --> 00:14:40,333
- You had it at a famous one. - Yes, that one.

424
00:14:40,334 --> 00:14:41,404
(Eating)

425
00:14:41,405 --> 00:14:43,974
Are you a local bully or what?

426
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:47,303
- You are... - You're not drunk, are you?

427
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:48,304
No, I'm not.

428
00:14:49,104 --> 00:14:51,713
You're so energetic today.

429
00:14:51,714 --> 00:14:54,514
- Because I came here yesterday. - He came here yesterday.

430
00:14:54,515 --> 00:14:55,813
I'm filled with energy now.

431
00:14:55,814 --> 00:14:56,954
(With energetic Kyoung Pyo)

432
00:14:57,214 --> 00:14:59,784
- This is the map. - I heard I could have fun here.

433
00:14:59,785 --> 00:15:01,284
- Yes, just hang out with us. - Right.

434
00:15:01,285 --> 00:15:02,853
- We're visiting three places. - Yes.

435
00:15:02,854 --> 00:15:04,723
There's one fake place among these.

436
00:15:04,724 --> 00:15:05,994
That's what we need to find.

437
00:15:05,995 --> 00:15:08,424
- Tae Oh said I could count on him. - Really?

438
00:15:08,425 --> 00:15:10,034
- Yes. - I watched many episodes...

439
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:11,933
- from the previous season, - I see.

440
00:15:11,934 --> 00:15:13,264
And I guessed them correctly many times.

441
00:15:13,265 --> 00:15:15,504
- You're reliable. - Really?

442
00:15:15,505 --> 00:15:17,004
I used to think, "This is easy."

443
00:15:17,005 --> 00:15:18,433
He said it was easy.

444
00:15:18,434 --> 00:15:20,573
We came with such confidence, and in the first episode...

445
00:15:20,574 --> 00:15:22,603
We were totally ruined.

446
00:15:22,604 --> 00:15:23,745
- You were? - Yes.

447
00:15:23,915 --> 00:15:25,014
(Will Tae Oh be able to guess which one is fake?)

448
00:15:25,015 --> 00:15:27,885
Anyway, we should head to the first place.

449
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:30,155
- Shall we go? - Shall we get going?

450
00:15:30,915 --> 00:15:33,223
(A stairway outside)

451
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:35,683
We need to take a photo of this place.

452
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:36,723
All right.

453
00:15:36,724 --> 00:15:38,295
I'll take a picture for you.

454
00:15:38,895 --> 00:15:40,265
As an MZ generation.

455
00:15:40,765 --> 00:15:42,223
- Mimi, you should be here. - Mimi.

456
00:15:42,224 --> 00:15:43,464
- Come here. - Come.

457
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,193
Mimi, if we take a picture without you, it becomes a tourist picture.

458
00:15:46,194 --> 00:15:48,103
Mimi, tell us how we can take a good picture.

459
00:15:48,104 --> 00:15:50,374
- We plan to stand here. - First of all,

460
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,703
you need to sit randomly like this.

461
00:15:52,704 --> 00:15:53,774
Randomly?

462
00:15:53,775 --> 00:15:55,203
She means at random, like zig-zag.

463
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,573
- Roughly. - Freely.

464
00:15:56,574 --> 00:15:59,313
- Freely, like this. - Sit wherever you like.

465
00:15:59,314 --> 00:16:01,313
Like how we were sitting earlier.

466
00:16:01,314 --> 00:16:03,284
You know, honestly, I hate these things.

467
00:16:03,285 --> 00:16:05,154
- Jae Seok. - Just do it.

468
00:16:05,155 --> 00:16:07,654
- Where are you going? Sit here. - Jae Seok, come on.

469
00:16:07,655 --> 00:16:09,994
- Sit. - I don't like taking a picture...

470
00:16:09,995 --> 00:16:11,724
- in a hot place. - Come on, Jae Seok.

471
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:15,724
(Making a v-sign)

472
00:16:17,865 --> 00:16:21,964
(Gen MZ takes a picture randomly like this.)

473
00:16:22,905 --> 00:16:23,974
It's good now.

474
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:28,144
(Tight)

475
00:16:28,145 --> 00:16:29,374
Are you going to be all right?

476
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,343
- Me? I'm fine. - Okay.

477
00:16:31,344 --> 00:16:33,384
- You can place your arms here. - I feel fine.

478
00:16:33,385 --> 00:16:34,943
- Are you sure? - Yes.

479
00:16:34,944 --> 00:16:35,983
(The taxi is packed as Kyoung Pyo became happier.)

480
00:16:35,984 --> 00:16:38,384
It mentioned "legendary figure."

481
00:16:38,385 --> 00:16:39,853
Is the legendary figure there?

482
00:16:39,854 --> 00:16:42,255
- I'm not sure what it means. - You're not sure?

483
00:16:42,724 --> 00:16:43,795
I'm curious.

484
00:16:44,495 --> 00:16:46,095
It might turn out to be related to food.

485
00:16:46,295 --> 00:16:47,295
(Feeling sorry)

486
00:16:47,296 --> 00:16:49,193
- It might be food. - You can sit more comfortably.

487
00:16:49,194 --> 00:16:51,333
- I'm comfortable. - Right. You're good now.

488
00:16:51,334 --> 00:16:52,394
(Legendary figure, Suyeong-gu, Busan)

489
00:16:52,395 --> 00:16:53,703
We don't have enough hints.

490
00:16:53,704 --> 00:16:56,463
Is it near the cafe street in Gwangalli?

491
00:16:56,464 --> 00:16:57,473
(Gwangalli cafe street)

492
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:58,505
It might be someone...

493
00:16:59,574 --> 00:17:03,474
- related to coffee. - Someone with a wide knowledge...

494
00:17:04,145 --> 00:17:06,515
Moon Ik Hwan?

495
00:17:07,015 --> 00:17:08,044
What?

496
00:17:08,045 --> 00:17:09,813
- One who brought in cottonseed... - It's Moon Ik Jeom.

497
00:17:09,814 --> 00:17:12,384
Moon Ik Jeom. Moon Ik Hwan is my friend, I guess.

498
00:17:12,385 --> 00:17:14,085
No, it's the name of a martial artist.

499
00:17:14,254 --> 00:17:15,254
(Moon Ik Hwan, a martial artist)

500
00:17:15,255 --> 00:17:16,425
Moon Ik Jeom.

501
00:17:16,694 --> 00:17:17,954
It's a mess today.

502
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:19,993
Back then, it wasn't for filming.

503
00:17:19,994 --> 00:17:21,023
(Busan City Tour begins in earnest.)

504
00:17:21,024 --> 00:17:22,665
I like Busan.

505
00:17:23,024 --> 00:17:24,033
I love it.

506
00:17:24,034 --> 00:17:26,233
It always feels good to be in Busan.

507
00:17:26,234 --> 00:17:28,433
It has a lot of things to see,

508
00:17:28,434 --> 00:17:29,634
and it has the sea too,

509
00:17:29,635 --> 00:17:31,003
so I feel excited in Busan.

510
00:17:31,004 --> 00:17:32,973
- Right. - It has a lot of good food too.

511
00:17:32,974 --> 00:17:34,204
There's a lot of good food.

512
00:17:34,805 --> 00:17:36,144
I should have eaten pork and rice soup.

513
00:17:36,145 --> 00:17:37,344
Haven't you had it yet?

514
00:17:37,345 --> 00:17:39,914
- I haven't had it yet. - I should have had wheat noodles.

515
00:17:39,915 --> 00:17:41,743
I love wheat noodles so much.

516
00:17:41,744 --> 00:17:43,585
I really like wheat noodles too.

517
00:17:43,784 --> 00:17:46,453
Whenever I visit Busan, the first meal I have is wheat noodles.

518
00:17:46,454 --> 00:17:48,354
- Really? - Yes, when I come to Busan.

519
00:17:48,355 --> 00:17:49,483
The place I went to yesterday...

520
00:17:49,484 --> 00:17:52,924
- felt like a transport cafe. - I should visit those places.

521
00:17:52,925 --> 00:17:53,925
It was so good.

522
00:17:53,926 --> 00:17:57,595
(She even carries wheat noodles in her tumbler.)

523
00:17:57,865 --> 00:17:59,193
(Thinking carefully)

524
00:17:59,194 --> 00:18:01,503
- Where's your hometown? - I'm from Cheonan, Chungcheong.

525
00:18:01,504 --> 00:18:03,024
(There's no wheat noodles in Cheonan.)

526
00:18:03,065 --> 00:18:04,074
I'm from Cheonan, South Chungcheong Province.

527
00:18:04,075 --> 00:18:05,973
- I see. You're from Cheonan. - Yes.

528
00:18:05,974 --> 00:18:08,574
I really envy people who speak with a Busan dialect.

529
00:18:08,575 --> 00:18:10,043
I can speak a bit of it, actually.

530
00:18:10,044 --> 00:18:11,144
- Really? - Yes.

531
00:18:11,145 --> 00:18:13,443
People from Seoul don't really notice,

532
00:18:13,444 --> 00:18:16,714
but Busan people are like, "Wait, what's this guy?"

533
00:18:16,815 --> 00:18:18,655
- Where's your hometown? - Incheon.

534
00:18:21,024 --> 00:18:22,384
I learned it.

535
00:18:22,385 --> 00:18:24,325
The taxi driver is laughing.

536
00:18:24,724 --> 00:18:26,444
- The driver is laughing. - Sir, is this...

537
00:18:26,724 --> 00:18:28,865
real Busan dialect? Is it correct?

538
00:18:29,425 --> 00:18:31,345
- What Kyoung Pyo just said. - I don't think so.

539
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,234
You see?

540
00:18:34,034 --> 00:18:36,334
- Is that right? - Yes, that's right.

541
00:18:36,335 --> 00:18:38,434
- Right? - Yes, right.

542
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:41,204
- This is Busan, right? - This is Busan.

543
00:18:42,544 --> 00:18:44,345
I'm sorry about this, sir.

544
00:18:45,244 --> 00:18:47,344
- Sir, isn't that right? - No, it's not.

545
00:18:47,345 --> 00:18:49,184
- No? - It's not?

546
00:18:49,815 --> 00:18:52,355
- No way, I know this is right. - He said it's not.

547
00:18:53,115 --> 00:18:54,925
This is close to being right, though.

548
00:18:56,284 --> 00:18:59,294
- It's close to a local accent, no? - I sound local enough, right?

549
00:19:06,665 --> 00:19:10,374
(Nervous)

550
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:12,474
Why did you shake like a leaf for a variety show?

551
00:19:12,974 --> 00:19:15,203
I have a bit of a fear of this kind of thing.

552
00:19:15,204 --> 00:19:16,574
- Really? - Really? Why?

553
00:19:16,575 --> 00:19:18,943
I feel like I have to keep talking...

554
00:19:18,944 --> 00:19:21,644
like, I can't let there be any silence.

555
00:19:21,645 --> 00:19:24,183
There's this pressure to keep the audio filled.

556
00:19:24,184 --> 00:19:26,615
Your visuals already say it all.

557
00:19:27,724 --> 00:19:28,724
Please don't.

558
00:19:29,684 --> 00:19:32,453
He told me to stop and be quiet.

559
00:19:32,454 --> 00:19:34,993
- Why tell the MC to be quiet? - No, that's not what I meant.

560
00:19:34,994 --> 00:19:37,293
- Mimi is just doing her job. - I'm actually working right now.

561
00:19:37,294 --> 00:19:38,595
Thank you.

562
00:19:38,964 --> 00:19:40,334
(Glances over)

563
00:19:40,335 --> 00:19:41,964
Your hair color is so pretty.

564
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,804
Your hair color is so pretty.

565
00:19:43,805 --> 00:19:44,874
Thank you.

566
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,203
Did you match it with your eye color?

567
00:19:47,204 --> 00:19:49,304
Yes, that's right. The eyes are fake.

568
00:19:49,305 --> 00:19:50,315
My hair is real.

569
00:19:51,115 --> 00:19:52,814
- Your eyes are fake? - Yes, my eyes are fake.

570
00:19:52,815 --> 00:19:54,544
(What's going on between them?)

571
00:19:55,145 --> 00:19:56,914
- Your hair is real? - Yes, my hair.

572
00:19:56,915 --> 00:19:58,384
(Romantic vibes)

573
00:19:58,385 --> 00:20:00,723
This is so funny. I feel like I'm sitting alone,

574
00:20:00,724 --> 00:20:01,824
next to a blind date.

575
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:04,254
- That coat looks amazing on you. - goodness.

576
00:20:04,355 --> 00:20:06,354
I think you matched it really well with your glasses.

577
00:20:06,355 --> 00:20:08,825
It's okay. No need to say that to me.

578
00:20:10,395 --> 00:20:12,963
- Do you visit Busan often? Yes. - Busan?

579
00:20:12,964 --> 00:20:15,304
Back in my college days, I came for the Busan Film Festival.

580
00:20:15,305 --> 00:20:16,604
(Tae Oh visited Busan for the BIFF when he was in college.)

581
00:20:16,605 --> 00:20:17,973
- You came here with friends? - Yes.

582
00:20:17,974 --> 00:20:19,433
- Picking movies to watch? - That's right.

583
00:20:19,434 --> 00:20:21,154
- Going out at night for fun? - We had fun.

584
00:20:21,204 --> 00:20:22,574
Then, do you also go to Zzang Arcade?

585
00:20:22,575 --> 00:20:24,514
- I like Zzang Arcade. - Zzang Arcade?

586
00:20:24,615 --> 00:20:26,774
I heard Zzang Arcade is the most popular spot.

587
00:20:27,244 --> 00:20:29,184
- You mean "Earth Arcade?" - No.

588
00:20:29,744 --> 00:20:30,754
No, just an arcade.

589
00:20:31,454 --> 00:20:33,754
- "Earth Arcade!" - No. What?

590
00:20:34,325 --> 00:20:35,355
No.

591
00:20:35,754 --> 00:20:37,355
Can you help explain?

592
00:20:37,855 --> 00:20:40,395
Oh, an arcade. I know it.

593
00:20:40,794 --> 00:20:43,263
- I really like arcade games. - Do you?

594
00:20:43,264 --> 00:20:44,395
Yes, I love them.

595
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:46,865
What do you usually do when you're not working?

596
00:20:47,434 --> 00:20:49,263
I don't really go out. I barely go out.

597
00:20:49,264 --> 00:20:50,274
(Total homebody vibes)

598
00:20:50,534 --> 00:20:51,874
Then, do you do home training?

599
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,404
(Then, do you do home training?)

600
00:20:54,405 --> 00:20:56,574
Pardon? Home?

601
00:20:56,575 --> 00:20:57,644
- Home training. - Home training!

602
00:20:57,645 --> 00:21:00,145
- Do you work out by yourself? - Yes, I do.

603
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:02,345
If only my pronunciation was good...

604
00:21:02,444 --> 00:21:04,414
- Your pronunciation is excellent. - Is that so? Thank you.

605
00:21:04,415 --> 00:21:05,614
I understood everything.

606
00:21:05,615 --> 00:21:06,615
(Pronunciation issue, hearing issue)

607
00:21:06,616 --> 00:21:08,283
Stay with us. Are you okay?

608
00:21:08,284 --> 00:21:09,284
(Chaotic taxi blind date)

609
00:21:09,285 --> 00:21:10,794
- Are you okay? - You all right?

610
00:21:11,724 --> 00:21:12,724
(We are getting close to the first hot place.)

611
00:21:12,725 --> 00:21:14,994
- We are almost there. - But this place is...

612
00:21:15,294 --> 00:21:17,410
- This is a residential area. - Yes, we're going in the alleys.

613
00:21:17,434 --> 00:21:20,064
Is this about a notable figure?

614
00:21:20,065 --> 00:21:21,065
Yes.

615
00:21:21,165 --> 00:21:23,463
- We'll get off here. Thank you. - Thank you!

616
00:21:23,464 --> 00:21:24,503
(A legendary figure is here?)

617
00:21:24,504 --> 00:21:25,544
It's early in the morning.

618
00:21:26,335 --> 00:21:29,273
I see people at a cafe already. The sun is so warm and nice.

619
00:21:29,274 --> 00:21:32,013
Early in the morning

620
00:21:32,014 --> 00:21:34,043
- Waking from sleep - Where is the legendary figure?

621
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:35,944
This is a roastery cafe.

622
00:21:36,145 --> 00:21:39,253
Hey, but you... I guess...

623
00:21:39,254 --> 00:21:41,054
- we're living through the same era. - Why?

624
00:21:41,055 --> 00:21:42,654
Talking about the morning, he went,

625
00:21:42,655 --> 00:21:44,693
Early in the morning

626
00:21:44,694 --> 00:21:45,824
- He sang that naturally. - Waking from sleep

627
00:21:45,825 --> 00:21:50,294
(Reacting in the early morning with "For Love")

628
00:21:50,835 --> 00:21:52,515
They said it was about a legendary figure.

629
00:21:52,635 --> 00:21:55,104
- About the legendary figure... - Gosh, I got goosebumps.

630
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,105
- Why? - Why?

631
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,575
There's something attached here.

632
00:21:58,305 --> 00:22:00,075
No, I mean, the decor...

633
00:22:00,474 --> 00:22:02,674
Look. Seriously...

634
00:22:02,675 --> 00:22:03,743
Is that really it?

635
00:22:03,744 --> 00:22:04,814
(What is the first place that appeared in the alley?)

636
00:22:04,815 --> 00:22:06,044
(Stopping)

637
00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:07,624
There's something attached here.

638
00:22:08,483 --> 00:22:10,284
No, I mean, the decor...

639
00:22:10,654 --> 00:22:12,793
Look. Seriously...

640
00:22:12,794 --> 00:22:13,863
Is that really it?

641
00:22:13,864 --> 00:22:14,922
(What is the first place that appeared in the alley?)

642
00:22:14,923 --> 00:22:15,963
(Stopping)

643
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:19,462
(In the middle of...)

644
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:22,763
(an utterly ordinary alley, )

645
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:25,533
(the first hot place of Busan appears.)

646
00:22:25,534 --> 00:22:27,273
This must be the place.

647
00:22:29,673 --> 00:22:32,013
Oh, there is a face.

648
00:22:32,114 --> 00:22:34,113
- I think I know what this is. - Really?

649
00:22:34,114 --> 00:22:35,874
- It's the Turtle Ship. - Is that really it?

650
00:22:36,743 --> 00:22:40,253
(In front of the Sixth Sense members, )

651
00:22:41,654 --> 00:22:46,624
(a restaurant with an unusual Turtle Ship exterior appears.)

652
00:22:46,894 --> 00:22:49,463
Maybe they sell what Admiral Yi Sun Sin ate.

653
00:22:50,193 --> 00:22:51,933
- The food Admiral used to eat? - Yes.

654
00:22:52,564 --> 00:22:55,733
(They are carefully moving closer to its imposing exterior.)

655
00:22:55,933 --> 00:22:58,933
The Joseon Navy...

656
00:22:59,074 --> 00:23:00,442
(The Joseon Navy...)

657
00:23:00,443 --> 00:23:01,443
(will never be defeated!)

658
00:23:01,444 --> 00:23:04,272
With your own hands, Save this country!

659
00:23:04,273 --> 00:23:06,874
(What's going on?)

660
00:23:06,973 --> 00:23:09,483
This is fake for sure.

661
00:23:09,584 --> 00:23:12,383
So much showmanship!

662
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:14,952
I don't think this is right. Smoke's coming out!

663
00:23:14,953 --> 00:23:16,784
(Now it's starting to emit smoke.)

664
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:18,423
- Oh my. - There's smoke.

665
00:23:18,723 --> 00:23:19,794
Oh, my gosh.

666
00:23:19,894 --> 00:23:22,794
- Hey, this is... - This is too much.

667
00:23:23,294 --> 00:23:24,363
(It suddenly feels like CBR training.)

668
00:23:24,364 --> 00:23:26,193
This is fake.

669
00:23:26,493 --> 00:23:27,533
I feel like I'm at Lotte World.

670
00:23:27,534 --> 00:23:28,833
I think it's fake.

671
00:23:28,834 --> 00:23:31,002
- This is just... - It's fake.

672
00:23:31,003 --> 00:23:33,104
- But this... - This is too much.

673
00:23:33,673 --> 00:23:35,703
(Going toward the smoke as thought he's enchanted)

674
00:23:35,773 --> 00:23:38,473
- This is... - This smells like a karaoke room.

675
00:23:39,344 --> 00:23:41,242
- This is fun. - It is funny.

676
00:23:41,243 --> 00:23:42,314
It is fun.

677
00:23:43,384 --> 00:23:44,913
Does this even make sense?

678
00:23:45,384 --> 00:23:46,753
- This is so funny. - Why?

679
00:23:47,154 --> 00:23:48,584
- This is so funny. - Why?

680
00:23:48,683 --> 00:23:51,192
This... Guys, look at this.

681
00:23:51,193 --> 00:23:53,623
Gosh, the smoke! I can't see.

682
00:23:53,624 --> 00:23:55,492
- Ilja-jin. - Beef bone soup.

683
00:23:55,493 --> 00:23:56,823
- Hakik-jin. - Hakik-jin.

684
00:23:56,824 --> 00:23:58,944
(The names of the dishes are Ilja-jin and Hakik-jin?)

685
00:23:59,693 --> 00:24:01,064
The war tactics.

686
00:24:01,364 --> 00:24:04,233
The tactics from Admiral Yi Sun Sin's naval battles.

687
00:24:07,104 --> 00:24:09,804
(What is the story behind...)

688
00:24:10,713 --> 00:24:12,873
(this eye-catching Turtle Ship in an ordinary alley?)

689
00:24:12,874 --> 00:24:15,344
- Shall we go take a look? - Shall we go inside?

690
00:24:17,784 --> 00:24:20,683
- But this is... - This is Turtle Ship.

691
00:24:20,983 --> 00:24:22,153
Welcome.

692
00:24:22,154 --> 00:24:25,023
There's Admiral Yi Sun Sin.

693
00:24:25,523 --> 00:24:28,824
(As the door opens, the inside of the Turtle Ship is revealed.)

694
00:24:29,624 --> 00:24:32,733
(And Admiral Yi Sun Sin can be seen right in front of us.)

695
00:24:33,733 --> 00:24:35,462
Is the sword really that big?

696
00:24:35,463 --> 00:24:37,874
(Just looking at that massive sword is overwhelming.)

697
00:24:37,973 --> 00:24:39,672
We're inside the ship.

698
00:24:39,673 --> 00:24:42,143
- Look to the side, the windows... - You're right.

699
00:24:42,144 --> 00:24:43,813
We are floating on the sea.

700
00:24:43,814 --> 00:24:45,543
- You're right. - We really are.

701
00:24:45,544 --> 00:24:46,873
(This interior reminds us of the Turtle Ship.)

702
00:24:46,874 --> 00:24:50,114
We are now inside the Turtle Ship.

703
00:24:50,713 --> 00:24:51,783
Yes, we're in the Turtle Ship.

704
00:24:51,784 --> 00:24:54,523
(Welcome, Sixth Sense members.)

705
00:24:54,854 --> 00:24:57,854
- There's a signature too. - Hey, Grasshopper. Look.

706
00:24:58,294 --> 00:24:59,653
(Grasshopper?)

707
00:24:59,654 --> 00:25:01,064
Seriously? Grasshopper?

708
00:25:02,124 --> 00:25:04,033
- I'm sorry. - CEO Song.

709
00:25:04,034 --> 00:25:05,094
It was urgent.

710
00:25:05,294 --> 00:25:08,003
Look at this. "Those willing to die will live,"

711
00:25:08,263 --> 00:25:10,634
"and those willing to live will die."

712
00:25:11,773 --> 00:25:12,803
("Those who seek death shall live, those who seek life shall die.")

713
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:15,644
(Admiral Yi Sun Sin's famous quote is right in front of us.)

714
00:25:16,374 --> 00:25:18,443
Someone has visited here?

715
00:25:19,273 --> 00:25:20,473
"To Geum Sang."

716
00:25:21,213 --> 00:25:23,242
(The vintage items catch the eye.)

717
00:25:23,243 --> 00:25:26,012
There are things...

718
00:25:26,013 --> 00:25:27,983
that remind us of Admiral Yi Sun Sin.

719
00:25:28,084 --> 00:25:30,922
Right, even the items here are related to Admiral Yi Sun Sin.

720
00:25:30,923 --> 00:25:33,429
(Did the props team create this with an Admiral Yi Sun Sin concept?)

721
00:25:33,453 --> 00:25:35,293
And if you look over here, there is Admiral Yi Sun Sin...

722
00:25:35,294 --> 00:25:37,834
featured on the old 500-won coin.

723
00:25:38,134 --> 00:25:40,834
You know, the 500-won coin was a banknote back in the day.

724
00:25:41,064 --> 00:25:42,103
I had one of those at home.

725
00:25:42,104 --> 00:25:43,203
- Oh, you did? - Yes.

726
00:25:43,503 --> 00:25:45,510
Back in the day, the 500-won coin was actually a banknote.

727
00:25:45,534 --> 00:25:47,242
- When you were alive? - What?

728
00:25:47,243 --> 00:25:49,074
- When you were alive? - What?

729
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:50,472
When you were alive.

730
00:25:50,473 --> 00:25:52,173
He is still alive, though.

731
00:25:53,044 --> 00:25:54,044
(Unbelievable)

732
00:25:54,044 --> 00:25:55,044
Where did I disappear to?

733
00:25:55,784 --> 00:25:57,453
(Mimi sending him far away)

734
00:25:57,784 --> 00:25:59,853
- No, I mean, when you were young. - When I was young.

735
00:25:59,854 --> 00:26:01,353
When he was still alive?

736
00:26:01,354 --> 00:26:04,422
I thought Mimi was seeing things.

737
00:26:04,423 --> 00:26:05,893
That was novel.

738
00:26:05,894 --> 00:26:07,192
"When he was alive."

739
00:26:07,193 --> 00:26:09,163
Mimi is always full of surprises.

740
00:26:09,294 --> 00:26:11,763
- But I got what you said, Mimi. - Yes, right.

741
00:26:12,364 --> 00:26:14,404
- I got what you meant. - Okay.

742
00:26:15,534 --> 00:26:16,763
What's on the menu?

743
00:26:17,574 --> 00:26:19,134
There is Hakik-jin spicy beef soup.

744
00:26:19,334 --> 00:26:22,173
And there is Ilja-jin...

745
00:26:22,473 --> 00:26:24,273
Ilja-jin...

746
00:26:24,544 --> 00:26:26,013
Naju beef bone soup.

747
00:26:26,213 --> 00:26:29,283
- This is hard to pronounce. - You could've been in trouble.

748
00:26:29,284 --> 00:26:31,712
I'm an actor, but this is hard to pronounce.

749
00:26:31,713 --> 00:26:32,752
It's "jin."

750
00:26:32,753 --> 00:26:35,753
- Yes, Ilja-jin. - That was...

751
00:26:35,854 --> 00:26:37,553
- Oh, it's the owner. - Hello.

752
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:39,093
- Hello. - Hello.

753
00:26:39,094 --> 00:26:41,022
- Hello. Nice to meet you. - Hello.

754
00:26:41,023 --> 00:26:42,094
Thank you, sir.

755
00:26:42,763 --> 00:26:44,033
Hello.

756
00:26:44,034 --> 00:26:47,662
(Is this owner who looks unusual real?)

757
00:26:47,663 --> 00:26:49,903
Did you actually reenact...

758
00:26:49,904 --> 00:26:51,973
Admiral Yi Sun Sin's Turtle Ship?

759
00:26:52,074 --> 00:26:53,272
Yes, it is a Korean cuisine restaurant inspired by...

760
00:26:53,273 --> 00:26:54,703
the story of Chungmugong.

761
00:26:54,804 --> 00:26:56,202
Oh, it's a Korean cuisine place.

762
00:26:56,203 --> 00:26:58,442
May I ask why you chose this concept?

763
00:26:58,443 --> 00:26:59,512
I'm really curious.

764
00:26:59,513 --> 00:27:02,884
I used to run a bar,

765
00:27:03,013 --> 00:27:05,953
but I had to shut it down because of COVID.

766
00:27:06,354 --> 00:27:08,923
As I was closing my store,

767
00:27:09,423 --> 00:27:11,493
I saw the drama "Immortal Admiral Yi Sun Sin..."

768
00:27:11,753 --> 00:27:14,223
- on YouTube by chance. - Yes.

769
00:27:15,094 --> 00:27:17,169
(Yi Sun Sin, the hero of the sea from the Joseon dynasty)

770
00:27:17,193 --> 00:27:18,334
Ready to fire!

771
00:27:18,794 --> 00:27:21,804
("Be calm like a mountain." From "War Diary of Yi Sun Sin")

772
00:27:22,203 --> 00:27:24,604
(Chungmugong Yi Sun Sin led 12 ships and fought...)

773
00:27:25,473 --> 00:27:29,404
(against the 133 ships of the Japanese Navy.)

774
00:27:29,943 --> 00:27:32,512
On the brink of collapse of my life,

775
00:27:32,513 --> 00:27:35,584
I saw the drama by chance.

776
00:27:36,743 --> 00:27:43,324
("Do not let the enemy know about my death.")

777
00:27:43,824 --> 00:27:46,723
He fought even at his final breath...

778
00:27:46,993 --> 00:27:50,623
and left a message that went, "Don't give up the hope."

779
00:27:50,624 --> 00:27:54,433
So I thought I shouldn't give up.

780
00:27:55,503 --> 00:27:58,973
A variety of war tactics he used...

781
00:27:59,034 --> 00:28:01,143
hovered in my head as the shape of food.

782
00:28:01,144 --> 00:28:03,243
I thought, "This is my destiny."

783
00:28:05,013 --> 00:28:07,943
As I learned about the admiral,

784
00:28:08,384 --> 00:28:11,814
I also had time to see...

785
00:28:12,013 --> 00:28:13,853
how he must have felt in the battle.

786
00:28:13,854 --> 00:28:15,499
(He started learning about Admiral Yi Sun Sin.)

787
00:28:15,523 --> 00:28:18,253
(He's even seen all the related books and contents.)

788
00:28:19,394 --> 00:28:22,693
All the tactics he used were...

789
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:25,363
the formula for winning.

790
00:28:25,364 --> 00:28:27,134
I wanted to recreate those into dishes.

791
00:28:29,003 --> 00:28:32,533
I decorated it using wood to give you the impression...

792
00:28:32,534 --> 00:28:35,772
that you entered the Turtle Ship as soon as you entered our store.

793
00:28:35,773 --> 00:28:37,973
(He decorated the restaurant in the shape of the ship.)

794
00:28:38,013 --> 00:28:41,713
(With the unique concept of exterior shape and menus, )

795
00:28:41,884 --> 00:28:44,982
I sell more than 140 servings in the morning.

796
00:28:44,983 --> 00:28:46,182
(it became a hot place where 140 servings are sold a day.)

797
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:48,023
Is this place real?

798
00:28:48,854 --> 00:28:50,022
Or fake?

799
00:28:50,023 --> 00:28:51,692
(Is this place real or not?)

800
00:28:51,693 --> 00:28:53,953
By the way, where did you get all of those props?

801
00:28:54,294 --> 00:28:57,863
I got them through the online market...

802
00:28:57,864 --> 00:28:59,933
and other shops.

803
00:29:00,263 --> 00:29:03,432
- And for the Turtle Ship... - Yes.

804
00:29:03,433 --> 00:29:07,442
And the commander's stick,

805
00:29:07,443 --> 00:29:09,972
customers who visited here...

806
00:29:09,973 --> 00:29:11,473
donated them to me.

807
00:29:12,644 --> 00:29:14,482
Especially, that ship is...

808
00:29:14,483 --> 00:29:16,712
an article from a customer's father.

809
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:18,114
- Seriously? - Yes.

810
00:29:18,513 --> 00:29:21,053
- This place is real! - That one in the house...

811
00:29:21,054 --> 00:29:23,254
- I'm a bit suspicious. - No, it's about one's article.

812
00:29:23,654 --> 00:29:25,493
- That is... - They donated the article.

813
00:29:26,554 --> 00:29:27,954
You shouldn't be convinced by that.

814
00:29:28,993 --> 00:29:32,163
I feel like the interior, including the door,

815
00:29:32,534 --> 00:29:35,232
is somewhat different from the neighbor's shops.

816
00:29:35,233 --> 00:29:38,034
- The location is somewhat strange. - Yes.

817
00:29:38,404 --> 00:29:41,403
As Yi Sun Sin fought alone...

818
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:43,103
in the Battle of Myeongnyang,

819
00:29:43,104 --> 00:29:45,672
my restaurant is fighting alone here as well.

820
00:29:45,673 --> 00:29:48,482
If he puts it that way...

821
00:29:48,483 --> 00:29:50,113
- The air is somber suddenly. - This place is real!

822
00:29:50,114 --> 00:29:51,252
- Yes, it is. - Indeed.

823
00:29:51,253 --> 00:29:52,512
- I wish it was! - Yes.

824
00:29:52,513 --> 00:29:54,452
- His answer moved you, right? - Seriously.

825
00:29:54,453 --> 00:29:55,453
Yes.

826
00:29:55,753 --> 00:29:57,233
Tae Oh, do you want to ask something?

827
00:29:57,723 --> 00:29:58,893
I'm still doubtful.

828
00:29:58,894 --> 00:29:59,894
In terms of what?

829
00:30:00,523 --> 00:30:03,692
He said he was fighting alone!

830
00:30:03,693 --> 00:30:06,333
I respect that. Of course, but...

831
00:30:06,334 --> 00:30:10,232
But I think it sounds a bit exaggerated.

832
00:30:10,233 --> 00:30:13,903
As he saw all the episodes of our show...

833
00:30:13,904 --> 00:30:15,424
He became suspicious about everything.

834
00:30:15,904 --> 00:30:18,643
(His excessive love for Yi Sun Sin. Is this real?)

835
00:30:18,644 --> 00:30:21,742
As we saw outside, there was spicy beef soup on the menu.

836
00:30:21,743 --> 00:30:24,083
Yes, that's right. As now is the winter season,

837
00:30:24,084 --> 00:30:26,183
we offer Naju beef bone soup and spicy beef soup.

838
00:30:26,713 --> 00:30:29,883
Although we're in Busan now,

839
00:30:29,884 --> 00:30:32,594
Admiral Yi was based...

840
00:30:33,753 --> 00:30:35,522
- in Jeolla Province. - Yes.

841
00:30:35,523 --> 00:30:37,634
Is that why you sell Naju beef bone soup?

842
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:38,933
(Impressed)

843
00:30:39,134 --> 00:30:41,203
- That's not really related. - No?

844
00:30:42,034 --> 00:30:43,962
It was a sharp question, though.

845
00:30:43,963 --> 00:30:45,573
- He asked it... - It was really sharp.

846
00:30:45,574 --> 00:30:47,472
Because his wife is from Naju.

847
00:30:47,473 --> 00:30:49,702
- It's Gwangju! - Gwangju. I see.

848
00:30:49,703 --> 00:30:50,780
(It was a sharp question, but he failed in deduction.)

849
00:30:50,804 --> 00:30:53,373
- It's time to order. - Yes.

850
00:30:53,374 --> 00:30:54,383
What would you like to have?

851
00:30:54,384 --> 00:30:56,512
I'll go for Hakik-jin, for sure.

852
00:30:56,513 --> 00:30:58,114
As I can't eat spicy food well,

853
00:30:58,614 --> 00:31:00,252
I choose Ilja-jin.

854
00:31:00,253 --> 00:31:02,133
- Be careful when you pronounce it. - Ilja-jin!

855
00:31:02,753 --> 00:31:04,022
- Ilja-jin. - Ilja-jin.

856
00:31:04,023 --> 00:31:05,300
(Anyway, Kyoung Pyo chose Ilja-jin, the Naju beef bone soup.)

857
00:31:05,324 --> 00:31:06,992
- Please prepare them. - All right.

858
00:31:06,993 --> 00:31:08,594
- I'll do my best. - Thanks.

859
00:31:09,064 --> 00:31:10,293
I can be sure now.

860
00:31:10,294 --> 00:31:11,732
- This place is real. - I think so too.

861
00:31:11,733 --> 00:31:14,563
- It's not easy to change the menu. - It's not easy.

862
00:31:14,564 --> 00:31:17,334
But for all the places we visited, they used paper menus.

863
00:31:17,604 --> 00:31:19,873
Digital ones are way easier to change nowadays.

864
00:31:19,874 --> 00:31:21,044
- Really? - Yes.

865
00:31:21,203 --> 00:31:23,303
(Laughing awkwardly)

866
00:31:23,304 --> 00:31:25,143
- You didn't know! - I didn't!

867
00:31:25,144 --> 00:31:26,814
"I didn't know!"

868
00:31:27,114 --> 00:31:28,843
(The blunt Kyoung Pyo gives us laughter today again.)

869
00:31:28,844 --> 00:31:29,912
I didn't know.

870
00:31:29,913 --> 00:31:31,613
This place feels real.

871
00:31:31,614 --> 00:31:32,712
No, it's fake.

872
00:31:32,713 --> 00:31:34,522
- Why do you think so? - Because...

873
00:31:34,523 --> 00:31:37,452
- I was... - Why do you keep saying that?

874
00:31:37,453 --> 00:31:40,293
He kept on glancing at the bottom left side...

875
00:31:40,294 --> 00:31:41,894
- when talking. - I saw that too.

876
00:31:42,394 --> 00:31:43,993
(Glancing)

877
00:31:44,364 --> 00:31:47,133
(He continuously kept looking at the opposite side of the members.)

878
00:31:47,134 --> 00:31:50,364
Maybe there's a script written by the production team?

879
00:31:50,973 --> 00:31:53,633
They are pros, though. So they know...

880
00:31:53,634 --> 00:31:55,754
Oh, I forgot you spent too much time in the military.

881
00:31:55,844 --> 00:31:58,544
(Kang Tae Oh, the reservist, still needs time to get adjusted.)

882
00:32:00,173 --> 00:32:01,512
When I was discharged, I felt...

883
00:32:01,513 --> 00:32:03,813
- I could do everything well. - I know what it feels like.

884
00:32:03,814 --> 00:32:05,912
- Since then, I've been infected... - Oh, it's real.

885
00:32:05,913 --> 00:32:08,154
- by the "I can do it" disease. - "I can do it?"

886
00:32:08,453 --> 00:32:10,553
- What is the "I can do it" disease? - The "I can do it" disease!

887
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:11,554
I respect your confidence,

888
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:13,323
but I don't think you have a good eye.

889
00:32:13,324 --> 00:32:15,393
My eyebrows? They're a bit...

890
00:32:15,394 --> 00:32:17,162
- He said "a good eye." - A good eye.

891
00:32:17,163 --> 00:32:19,893
He has bad hearing.

892
00:32:19,894 --> 00:32:22,403
- He can't hear well. - No, he can't.

893
00:32:22,404 --> 00:32:25,673
You have been more chaotic since the discharge.

894
00:32:26,904 --> 00:32:30,243
At least, he knew how to communicate before then.

895
00:32:30,904 --> 00:32:32,813
I will serve you one by one.

896
00:32:32,814 --> 00:32:34,213
- Thanks. - Gosh.

897
00:32:34,413 --> 00:32:38,314
This is Hansan Hakik-jin spicy beef soup.

898
00:32:38,654 --> 00:32:40,783
As you see, it's the shape of Hakik-jin.

899
00:32:40,784 --> 00:32:42,923
You give that much meat?

900
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:45,554
(How could you add that much meat?)

901
00:32:45,654 --> 00:32:47,093
- It's 12 ships, so... - It's 12 ships.

902
00:32:47,094 --> 00:32:48,762
- So, 12 pieces. - Is it...

903
00:32:48,763 --> 00:32:52,493
- There are 12 pieces in total! - Is it turmeric rice?

904
00:32:52,993 --> 00:32:54,533
This is Myeongnyang Ilja-jin...

905
00:32:54,534 --> 00:32:56,202
- Naju beef bone soup. - Ilja-jin?

906
00:32:56,203 --> 00:32:57,563
Look at the amount of beef.

907
00:32:57,564 --> 00:32:59,303
This bone soup is...

908
00:32:59,304 --> 00:33:00,304
- This is crazy! - It's awesome!

909
00:33:00,305 --> 00:33:03,044
I don't think he can make any profit.

910
00:33:05,443 --> 00:33:09,983
(The signature menu of the Yi Sun Sin restaurant)

911
00:33:10,584 --> 00:33:15,584
("I still have 12 ships to fight with.")

912
00:33:16,854 --> 00:33:20,323
(Hakik-jin spicy beef soup, the shape of a crane spreading wings)

913
00:33:20,324 --> 00:33:22,692
(What is the secret of this dish?)

914
00:33:22,693 --> 00:33:26,332
For the spicy beef soup, I follow the traditional way of cooking,

915
00:33:26,333 --> 00:33:28,264
using suet oil for sauce.

916
00:33:29,003 --> 00:33:32,333
Only suet oil can create...

917
00:33:32,733 --> 00:33:36,173
the savory and rich taste.

918
00:33:37,003 --> 00:33:40,813
(He adds chili powder to the suet.)

919
00:33:42,414 --> 00:33:44,553
Spicy beef soup is red, right?

920
00:33:44,554 --> 00:33:47,153
So, I expressed it as the burning sea.

921
00:33:47,154 --> 00:33:50,383
Joseon was invaded a lot,

922
00:33:50,384 --> 00:33:53,493
and our ancestors held out and protected our land.

923
00:33:53,494 --> 00:33:56,392
To express the strong will of the people,

924
00:33:56,393 --> 00:34:00,534
I thought the spicy and hot spicy beef soup would be the best.

925
00:34:01,204 --> 00:34:05,003
(Now is the time to shape the Hakik-jin tactic.)

926
00:34:05,833 --> 00:34:08,743
For two hours, I boil beef brisket, from which the blood is taken out,

927
00:34:08,744 --> 00:34:10,503
and I cool it down.

928
00:34:12,014 --> 00:34:15,114
I cut it in the shape of Panokseon.

929
00:34:16,414 --> 00:34:19,054
I solemnly put each piece into the bowl.

930
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:27,864
(12 pieces of boiled beef are placed in the shape of Hakik-jin.)

931
00:34:30,123 --> 00:34:34,034
(Hansan Hakik-jin spicy beef soup)

932
00:34:34,463 --> 00:34:35,534
Gosh, this is...

933
00:34:36,463 --> 00:34:38,102
- It tears so easily. - Oh, my.

934
00:34:38,103 --> 00:34:39,332
- Oh, my. - It must be so tender.

935
00:34:39,333 --> 00:34:41,844
- It should be. - One ship just sank.

936
00:34:42,943 --> 00:34:44,713
One ship just sank.

937
00:34:44,873 --> 00:34:46,744
How could you put it like that?

938
00:34:47,614 --> 00:34:48,844
I can't eat now.

939
00:34:49,213 --> 00:34:51,613
- For me... - Because it's a waste?

940
00:34:51,614 --> 00:34:53,582
He's too immersed.

941
00:34:53,583 --> 00:34:55,653
- Exactly. He's too immersed. - I mean...

942
00:34:55,654 --> 00:34:57,752
He looks perfect,

943
00:34:57,753 --> 00:34:59,422
but what he says is meaningless.

944
00:34:59,423 --> 00:35:00,792
He's really clumsy.

945
00:35:00,793 --> 00:35:02,562
He really is.

946
00:35:02,563 --> 00:35:05,793
- He said 1 ship sank. - Now only 11 ships are left.

947
00:35:07,864 --> 00:35:11,002
As it's so pretty, I can't mix it.

948
00:35:11,003 --> 00:35:12,950
(What will it taste like with the 12 pieces of meat?)

949
00:35:12,974 --> 00:35:17,043
(Having a big bite)

950
00:35:17,173 --> 00:35:18,743
(Impressed)

951
00:35:18,744 --> 00:35:20,114
(Nodding in satisfaction)

952
00:35:20,313 --> 00:35:21,712
(Sun Bin takes a ship first.)

953
00:35:21,713 --> 00:35:22,813
It's so good!

954
00:35:24,813 --> 00:35:29,983
(Inhaling Hakik-jin)

955
00:35:30,224 --> 00:35:31,323
It's good.

956
00:35:31,324 --> 00:35:32,844
- It's not so spicy. - It tastes good.

957
00:35:33,393 --> 00:35:36,892
(In a trance)

958
00:35:36,893 --> 00:35:39,333
- The meat tears so easily. - Yes, it's so tender.

959
00:35:40,463 --> 00:35:42,303
- This place is real, right? - This is...

960
00:35:42,304 --> 00:35:44,304
- What? - This place seems real, right?

961
00:35:45,233 --> 00:35:46,833
I'm still doubtful.

962
00:35:47,804 --> 00:35:49,003
You're strange.

963
00:35:49,474 --> 00:35:51,243
- He keeps saying that? - Yes.

964
00:35:51,244 --> 00:35:53,372
- He's devouring, you know? - That's what I mean.

965
00:35:53,373 --> 00:35:55,942
But when I listen to his reason, it's not that...

966
00:35:55,943 --> 00:35:58,083
It's very tasty and spicy.

967
00:35:58,914 --> 00:36:03,922
It's spicy, but it's from natural ingredients.

968
00:36:03,923 --> 00:36:04,994
- It's so good. - Right?

969
00:36:05,324 --> 00:36:06,423
It's so good.

970
00:36:06,654 --> 00:36:08,323
(Suet oil upgraded...)

971
00:36:08,324 --> 00:36:10,022
How can the meat be so tender?

972
00:36:10,023 --> 00:36:11,864
(the level of savoriness.)

973
00:36:12,494 --> 00:36:14,533
Is there rice at the bottom of the bowl?

974
00:36:14,534 --> 00:36:17,732
No, we added the turmeric rice to it.

975
00:36:17,733 --> 00:36:19,203
- Oh, this is so good! - In the bone soup,

976
00:36:19,204 --> 00:36:20,703
there's rice inside.

977
00:36:20,704 --> 00:36:21,844
- Really? - Yes.

978
00:36:22,143 --> 00:36:24,474
Why does it sound like you're showing off?

979
00:36:25,273 --> 00:36:27,772
"You don't have rice, do you? I do!"

980
00:36:27,773 --> 00:36:29,643
- Are you jealous? - Yes.

981
00:36:32,284 --> 00:36:34,983
("Form Ilja-jin!")

982
00:36:36,154 --> 00:36:39,654
(Myeongnyang Ilja-jin bone soup)

983
00:36:40,324 --> 00:36:42,192
(It was the winning tactic the admiral used...)

984
00:36:42,193 --> 00:36:45,562
(during the Battle of Myeongnyang in 1597.)

985
00:36:45,563 --> 00:36:48,562
As Naju beef bone soup's broth should be clear,

986
00:36:48,563 --> 00:36:52,833
the key point is to filter well without leaving any impurities.

987
00:36:54,543 --> 00:36:57,073
It depicts the Ilja-jin presented in Uldolmok...

988
00:36:57,074 --> 00:36:59,272
during the Battle of Myeongnyang.

989
00:36:59,273 --> 00:37:01,313
(He put 12 pieces of meat in the form of Ilja-jin.)

990
00:37:02,514 --> 00:37:05,713
The green onions represent the swirling Uldolmok.

991
00:37:05,954 --> 00:37:07,353
And...

992
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:10,783
the yellow egg garnish represents the Japanese battleship.

993
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:12,499
(Yellow egg garnish means Japanese battleship.)

994
00:37:12,523 --> 00:37:15,223
- The chili powder in the center. - Yes.

995
00:37:15,224 --> 00:37:17,422
It is Kurushima...

996
00:37:17,423 --> 00:37:19,192
who jumped onto Admiral Yi Sun Sin's battleship.

997
00:37:19,193 --> 00:37:20,562
(Chili powder means Kurushima who jumped onto the Turtle ship.)

998
00:37:20,563 --> 00:37:22,863
(Uldolmok, Enemy general Kurushima)

999
00:37:22,864 --> 00:37:25,273
(Yi Sun Sin's 12 ships, Japanese Battleships)

1000
00:37:26,233 --> 00:37:30,442
(Battle of Myeongnyang in one dish)

1001
00:37:30,443 --> 00:37:31,913
How is this put in one dish?

1002
00:37:31,914 --> 00:37:34,712
(Taking a bite)

1003
00:37:34,713 --> 00:37:36,442
I've never tried Naju beef bone soup before,

1004
00:37:36,443 --> 00:37:37,883
- but is this good? - Yes, it is.

1005
00:37:37,884 --> 00:37:38,914
It is good.

1006
00:37:40,514 --> 00:37:43,482
(The cleanest soup made by...)

1007
00:37:43,483 --> 00:37:47,054
(removing impurities dozens of times.)

1008
00:37:47,994 --> 00:37:49,062
(Taking a bite)

1009
00:37:49,063 --> 00:37:50,324
In the morning, we should...

1010
00:37:51,463 --> 00:37:55,803
(Enjoying the meat)

1011
00:37:55,804 --> 00:37:57,803
It's not easy to add in this much meat.

1012
00:37:57,804 --> 00:37:59,709
(There's a lot more meat compared to regular beef bone soup.)

1013
00:37:59,733 --> 00:38:01,843
(Staring)

1014
00:38:01,844 --> 00:38:03,103
I'm eating three ships.

1015
00:38:04,503 --> 00:38:06,514
(That's disappointing.)

1016
00:38:06,914 --> 00:38:10,344
(The youngest's wit brings a round of applause.)

1017
00:38:10,583 --> 00:38:13,752
I think the owner has a lot of insight...

1018
00:38:13,753 --> 00:38:17,153
in the food business.

1019
00:38:17,154 --> 00:38:19,724
I think he did a lot of research in food.

1020
00:38:20,253 --> 00:38:21,253
It's delicious.

1021
00:38:21,254 --> 00:38:23,894
(Admiral Yi would be proud of spicy beef soup and beef bone soup.)

1022
00:38:24,793 --> 00:38:26,863
(Sun Bin)

1023
00:38:26,864 --> 00:38:28,640
- I found something suspicious. - What is it?

1024
00:38:28,664 --> 00:38:30,544
The soup isn't as hot as I thought it would be.

1025
00:38:31,404 --> 00:38:33,103
- It is hot. - Is it?

1026
00:38:33,733 --> 00:38:35,473
How much hotter should it be?

1027
00:38:35,474 --> 00:38:36,974
Are you eating lava or something?

1028
00:38:37,404 --> 00:38:38,712
- Mine isn't hot. - But...

1029
00:38:38,713 --> 00:38:41,042
it's steaming right now. How can you say it's not hot?

1030
00:38:41,043 --> 00:38:43,643
You know, people can't really feel things well if you're nervous.

1031
00:38:43,813 --> 00:38:45,653
I think his sense of taste isn't working well.

1032
00:38:46,184 --> 00:38:48,653
I wonder why he'd go through the trouble...

1033
00:38:48,654 --> 00:38:51,154
to create a concept like this if the food is this good.

1034
00:38:52,023 --> 00:38:54,692
I also think the concept is a bit much.

1035
00:38:54,693 --> 00:38:57,824
Also, this is the legendary figure...

1036
00:38:58,333 --> 00:39:00,232
who everyone in Korea respects.

1037
00:39:00,233 --> 00:39:02,233
- A legendary figure. A real one. - Right.

1038
00:39:02,503 --> 00:39:05,204
That's why it makes my heart heavy.

1039
00:39:07,204 --> 00:39:08,243
You get it, right?

1040
00:39:08,244 --> 00:39:09,872
Even the meat represents 12 ships.

1041
00:39:09,873 --> 00:39:12,114
If you think you're eating one ship at a time...

1042
00:39:12,173 --> 00:39:13,672
It makes me think...

1043
00:39:13,673 --> 00:39:15,614
that I'm committing a sin the moment I eat it.

1044
00:39:15,983 --> 00:39:18,113
What do you think about this place? As an interim check.

1045
00:39:18,114 --> 00:39:19,684
She's quite suspicious.

1046
00:39:20,114 --> 00:39:23,523
I think this store has the feeling of a fake one.

1047
00:39:23,824 --> 00:39:25,669
- Which one makes you think that? - There's a lot of it.

1048
00:39:25,693 --> 00:39:26,752
Which one?

1049
00:39:26,753 --> 00:39:29,764
Can you tell us three things that make you think this place is fake?

1050
00:39:30,023 --> 00:39:32,833
First of all, when I first walked in, my hunch told me...

1051
00:39:32,994 --> 00:39:34,733
- It was a bit... - Your hunch?

1052
00:39:34,904 --> 00:39:37,263
You know there's certain energy a place gives off.

1053
00:39:37,264 --> 00:39:38,602
The energy of the place was...

1054
00:39:38,603 --> 00:39:40,483
- Isn't this your first visit here? - Isn't it?

1055
00:39:41,034 --> 00:39:42,903
The soup was not so hot.

1056
00:39:42,904 --> 00:39:44,343
But you finished the whole bowl.

1057
00:39:44,344 --> 00:39:46,113
He finished it.

1058
00:39:46,114 --> 00:39:47,772
- He finished it. - Tae Oh, you finished it.

1059
00:39:47,773 --> 00:39:50,083
- I still have eight ships left. - Sure.

1060
00:39:50,583 --> 00:39:52,260
I think we should move on to the second place.

1061
00:39:52,284 --> 00:39:53,852
- We need something to compare to. - We need to take a look at it all.

1062
00:39:53,853 --> 00:39:55,323
Yes, we need to take a look at it all.

1063
00:39:55,324 --> 00:39:56,352
(1. Exterior of the Turtle Ship makes it look like a theme park.)

1064
00:39:56,353 --> 00:39:57,353
(2. Owner serious about Yi Sun Sin, 3. Excessive concept on menus)

1065
00:39:57,354 --> 00:39:58,922
- Shall we go? - Let's go.

1066
00:39:58,923 --> 00:40:01,392
I think the bakery is a popular place.

1067
00:40:01,393 --> 00:40:02,599
(Headed toward the second trendy spot, the legendary bread)

1068
00:40:02,623 --> 00:40:04,933
Eating rice soup for breakfast...

1069
00:40:04,934 --> 00:40:06,733
- It's filling. - It is filling.

1070
00:40:07,233 --> 00:40:09,002
I'm drowsy.

1071
00:40:09,003 --> 00:40:11,063
(Closing his eyes)

1072
00:40:11,304 --> 00:40:14,003
Eating something warm after being cold and being in a warm place...

1073
00:40:14,974 --> 00:40:16,734
Yes. Really, I feel drowsy after eating too.

1074
00:40:17,043 --> 00:40:18,713
Gosh. Sun Bin.

1075
00:40:19,273 --> 00:40:20,914
That's nice.

1076
00:40:21,074 --> 00:40:23,082
- I understood everything. - I was yawning.

1077
00:40:23,083 --> 00:40:25,313
- "I feel drowsy." - Seriously.

1078
00:40:25,884 --> 00:40:26,953
That's good.

1079
00:40:26,954 --> 00:40:29,823
(She's sleepy as well.)

1080
00:40:29,824 --> 00:40:32,292
Seriously, if you're in a warm place after eating...

1081
00:40:32,293 --> 00:40:34,693
If you are full and warm, you feel drowsy.

1082
00:40:35,193 --> 00:40:36,392
(Take a nap.)

1083
00:40:36,393 --> 00:40:38,434
- Take a nap. - No, I can't.

1084
00:40:39,063 --> 00:40:41,933
What you just said gave me the butterflies.

1085
00:40:41,934 --> 00:40:42,934
"Take a nap."

1086
00:40:42,935 --> 00:40:44,804
It made my heart flutter for no reason.

1087
00:40:45,574 --> 00:40:46,633
"Take a nap."

1088
00:40:46,634 --> 00:40:48,343
Both of you, take a nap.

1089
00:40:48,344 --> 00:40:49,903
I'll take the lead.

1090
00:40:49,904 --> 00:40:51,473
- Will you? - Yes.

1091
00:40:51,474 --> 00:40:53,974
- Then please do so. - You can nap for a while.

1092
00:40:54,273 --> 00:40:56,142
(Tae Oh TV)

1093
00:40:56,143 --> 00:40:57,384
It's been a while, everyone.

1094
00:40:58,353 --> 00:40:59,813
Next to me, they are sleeping.

1095
00:41:01,784 --> 00:41:03,383
Go to sleep, quick.

1096
00:41:03,384 --> 00:41:04,384
(Go to sleep, quick.)

1097
00:41:04,483 --> 00:41:06,224
I'm in Busan.

1098
00:41:07,023 --> 00:41:08,122
(Pausing)

1099
00:41:08,123 --> 00:41:10,563
The weather warmed up a lot.

1100
00:41:12,594 --> 00:41:14,133
(Boring)

1101
00:41:14,134 --> 00:41:15,203
That was a good nap.

1102
00:41:15,204 --> 00:41:17,209
This won't work. I think people will change the channel.

1103
00:41:17,233 --> 00:41:18,602
Can't you make it a bit faster?

1104
00:41:18,603 --> 00:41:19,603
(Sounding coy)

1105
00:41:20,074 --> 00:41:22,573
- Well, I'm a bit nervous. - Oh, that's why.

1106
00:41:22,574 --> 00:41:24,773
Why are you tapping on me when you're nervous?

1107
00:41:25,244 --> 00:41:26,642
- He's asking for help. - He keeps tapping on me.

1108
00:41:26,643 --> 00:41:27,942
He's asking for help.

1109
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:29,114
(Please help me.)

1110
00:41:30,083 --> 00:41:32,483
- I wonder who first created bread. - I know.

1111
00:41:32,713 --> 00:41:33,983
- Right? - Yes.

1112
00:41:34,213 --> 00:41:35,653
I think we should award that person.

1113
00:41:35,724 --> 00:41:37,553
- Did you take off your socks? - No.

1114
00:41:37,554 --> 00:41:38,594
Your socks earlier...

1115
00:41:39,554 --> 00:41:40,653
(Bursts out laughing)

1116
00:41:40,654 --> 00:41:42,823
Right. I...

1117
00:41:42,824 --> 00:41:44,093
They are the same color.

1118
00:41:44,094 --> 00:41:46,094
- Aren't they? - They are the same color.

1119
00:41:46,293 --> 00:41:47,633
She was fumbling.

1120
00:41:47,634 --> 00:41:49,264
I thought she took them off.

1121
00:41:49,603 --> 00:41:51,062
- I thought she was barefoot. - Well...

1122
00:41:51,063 --> 00:41:53,872
I'm not someone who would take off socks like this...

1123
00:41:53,873 --> 00:41:55,303
- in the middle of a show. - That was so funny.

1124
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:58,313
I didn't look at your feet to be considerate.

1125
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:00,744
- I didn't look. - Thank you. You're a gentleman.

1126
00:42:01,983 --> 00:42:05,114
The conversation isn't so memorable.

1127
00:42:06,014 --> 00:42:07,413
But I think it's so funny.

1128
00:42:07,414 --> 00:42:09,054
It's not memorable?

1129
00:42:09,154 --> 00:42:10,352
(Is this the second hot place?)

1130
00:42:10,353 --> 00:42:12,393
- We're here. - Gosh.

1131
00:42:12,753 --> 00:42:14,053
That looks like a different country.

1132
00:42:14,054 --> 00:42:15,563
- Isn't it so pretty? - Yes.

1133
00:42:15,764 --> 00:42:17,764
(Impressed)

1134
00:42:18,094 --> 00:42:19,664
That's also Gwangalli?

1135
00:42:20,233 --> 00:42:21,493
- It's here. - I think we're...

1136
00:42:21,494 --> 00:42:23,063
- on the opposite side. - That's right.

1137
00:42:23,634 --> 00:42:26,534
(Visiting another hot place in Busan before the next place)

1138
00:42:27,873 --> 00:42:30,443
(Igidae)

1139
00:42:30,773 --> 00:42:32,042
Gosh. It's so pretty.

1140
00:42:32,043 --> 00:42:34,372
There's a coastal road here.

1141
00:42:34,373 --> 00:42:35,843
It's pretty.

1142
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:38,013
I think there is a trail...

1143
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:40,284
- along the coastal line. - Right.

1144
00:42:41,884 --> 00:42:45,693
(What kind of view awaits them?)

1145
00:42:46,293 --> 00:42:48,122
- It's like spring here. - Yes. The weather's so nice here.

1146
00:42:48,123 --> 00:42:50,022
- It's so nice eating and walking. - Isn't this like spring?

1147
00:42:50,023 --> 00:42:52,264
- It's so pretty. - It's great today.

1148
00:42:52,793 --> 00:42:54,062
The weather feels like spring.

1149
00:42:54,063 --> 00:42:56,023
- This is unbelievable. - My heart is fluttering.

1150
00:42:56,103 --> 00:42:58,534
- My heart slightly fluttered - Slightly fluttered

1151
00:42:58,873 --> 00:43:01,843
(Here is the original singer.)

1152
00:43:01,844 --> 00:43:03,603
I should go back there again.

1153
00:43:03,773 --> 00:43:06,043
- Where? - The dating bar.

1154
00:43:06,213 --> 00:43:07,442
I should go there to hit on someone.

1155
00:43:07,443 --> 00:43:08,914
Why is that place a dating bar?

1156
00:43:09,614 --> 00:43:12,712
Just its ambiance. It just felt like one.

1157
00:43:12,713 --> 00:43:14,212
- Hello. - Hello.

1158
00:43:14,213 --> 00:43:15,723
- Hello. - Hello.

1159
00:43:15,724 --> 00:43:17,883
- Hello. - Hello.

1160
00:43:17,884 --> 00:43:20,023
- Happy New Year. - Hello.

1161
00:43:20,253 --> 00:43:21,392
(Exclaiming)

1162
00:43:21,393 --> 00:43:23,463
If you only take a look there, it looks like Dubai.

1163
00:43:23,864 --> 00:43:25,133
- Right. - It really does.

1164
00:43:25,134 --> 00:43:27,993
- It does look like Burj Khalifa. - You have to look carefully.

1165
00:43:27,994 --> 00:43:30,133
I think I get what it is.

1166
00:43:30,134 --> 00:43:31,462
The view is really great here.

1167
00:43:31,463 --> 00:43:33,434
- Exactly. - It's so great.

1168
00:43:34,833 --> 00:43:36,303
You can see Gwangan Bridge in a glance.

1169
00:43:36,304 --> 00:43:38,273
(From Diamond Bridge, the landmark of Busan)

1170
00:43:39,014 --> 00:43:40,143
It's great.

1171
00:43:40,773 --> 00:43:43,783
- The boat over there. - It's nice.

1172
00:43:43,784 --> 00:43:45,352
(The emerald coast and the waterway that is created by the boat)

1173
00:43:45,353 --> 00:43:47,113
But it's so pretty here.

1174
00:43:47,114 --> 00:43:48,783
- Yes. Look over there. - Look at the glittering ripples.

1175
00:43:48,784 --> 00:43:49,824
It's so pretty.

1176
00:43:50,023 --> 00:43:52,743
- You should look at such a thing. - You should take pictures of it.

1177
00:43:55,193 --> 00:43:59,562
(A hot place that boasts the best view)

1178
00:43:59,563 --> 00:44:00,633
(Impressed)

1179
00:44:00,634 --> 00:44:01,803
It's so pretty.

1180
00:44:01,804 --> 00:44:03,562
- It's so pretty. - Is this real?

1181
00:44:03,563 --> 00:44:05,232
Busan is really amazing.

1182
00:44:05,233 --> 00:44:06,832
Why are you putting your hands on your hip?

1183
00:44:06,833 --> 00:44:07,973
Gosh. It's pretty.

1184
00:44:07,974 --> 00:44:09,672
What are you doing all of a sudden?

1185
00:44:09,673 --> 00:44:11,473
(Suddenly, he gives off the vibe of a hiker.)

1186
00:44:12,574 --> 00:44:13,872
You can see this right away.

1187
00:44:13,873 --> 00:44:15,443
It's pretty.

1188
00:44:16,213 --> 00:44:18,653
(From Gwangan Bridge to Marine City)

1189
00:44:18,654 --> 00:44:22,284
(You can capture everything in a glance.)

1190
00:44:22,483 --> 00:44:26,393
(A popular spot for a view on the rise)

1191
00:44:26,523 --> 00:44:29,392
But Gen Z wouldn't take pictures at a place like this.

1192
00:44:29,393 --> 00:44:31,832
- Where you do take one, then? - Over here. Next to it.

1193
00:44:31,833 --> 00:44:33,133
- Where you can't see such a thing. - Where?

1194
00:44:33,134 --> 00:44:34,332
Next to things like this.

1195
00:44:34,333 --> 00:44:36,203
Rather than next to the obvious symbol?

1196
00:44:36,204 --> 00:44:37,403
They are weird.

1197
00:44:37,404 --> 00:44:40,574
They wouldn't take a picture with the thing that's made for it.

1198
00:44:40,804 --> 00:44:42,704
Gen MZ is really strange.

1199
00:44:42,804 --> 00:44:45,074
Jae Seok is definitely not Gen MZ...

1200
00:44:45,213 --> 00:44:46,913
because he's taking a picture of it when there's no one.

1201
00:44:46,914 --> 00:44:49,014
(Jae Seok's zone)

1202
00:44:49,143 --> 00:44:51,883
I reject such a thing. I reject Gen MZ.

1203
00:44:51,884 --> 00:44:52,913
(Childish Yu, A rejector of Gen MZ)

1204
00:44:52,914 --> 00:44:55,053
Your clothes look the most like Gen MZ.

1205
00:44:55,054 --> 00:44:56,752
Gen MZ also rejects you.

1206
00:44:56,753 --> 00:44:59,393
Okay. This is war!

1207
00:45:00,324 --> 00:45:01,763
(So childish)

1208
00:45:01,764 --> 00:45:03,062
- This is war. - This is war.

1209
00:45:03,063 --> 00:45:04,122
This is war.

1210
00:45:04,123 --> 00:45:05,369
(Gen MZ, please show your understanding.)

1211
00:45:05,393 --> 00:45:06,832
- Shall we take a picture? - Shall we?

1212
00:45:06,833 --> 00:45:07,893
Yes.

1213
00:45:08,094 --> 00:45:10,264
Kyoung Pyo. That's a good pose.

1214
00:45:10,434 --> 00:45:11,950
- Your hand on the thing. - It's good.

1215
00:45:11,974 --> 00:45:14,173
Kyoung Pyo is not Gen MZ either.

1216
00:45:15,043 --> 00:45:16,672
That's subtle and nice.

1217
00:45:16,673 --> 00:45:19,414
- Subtle? - Have your leg up like this too.

1218
00:45:20,014 --> 00:45:22,184
- That's good. - That's it, Kyoung Pyo.

1219
00:45:22,543 --> 00:45:24,443
- You look good. - That's it.

1220
00:45:24,614 --> 00:45:26,582
(An old hiker appears again.)

1221
00:45:26,583 --> 00:45:28,723
- This is great. - You're so good at it.

1222
00:45:28,724 --> 00:45:29,883
He looks like he failed...

1223
00:45:29,884 --> 00:45:33,023
to meet someone at the dating bar and came here.

1224
00:45:33,693 --> 00:45:35,892
Why do you keep calling that place a dating bar?

1225
00:45:35,893 --> 00:45:36,893
(Father Yu starts to enforce regulation.)

1226
00:45:36,894 --> 00:45:38,062
She wants some entertainment.

1227
00:45:38,063 --> 00:45:40,593
- I'm sorry. - This is so romantic.

1228
00:45:40,594 --> 00:45:42,062
- That's nice. I really like it. - Let's take a photo.

1229
00:45:42,063 --> 00:45:44,103
- It's so romantic. - You're good.

1230

(Picture full of Generation X's romance by photographer Song)

1231
00:45:48,443 --> 00:45:49,642
CEO Song, come here.

1232
00:45:49,643 --> 00:45:51,373
Stand over here.

1233
00:45:52,574 --> 00:45:53,744
(Cheering)

1234
00:45:57,684 --> 00:46:00,684
(This is a group picture of Generation X.)

1235
00:46:01,654 --> 00:46:03,454
This is Busan.

1236
00:46:03,923 --> 00:46:05,752
- This is pretty. - This is Busan.

1237
00:46:05,753 --> 00:46:07,122
This is Busan.

1238
00:46:07,123 --> 00:46:08,869
(After enjoying the sea view, they head for the legendary bread.)

1239
00:46:08,893 --> 00:46:09,993
(2. Bread)

1240
00:46:09,994 --> 00:46:12,462
(Nam-gu, Busan)

1241
00:46:12,463 --> 00:46:14,863
(Second place The Legends of Busan, Bread)

1242
00:46:14,864 --> 00:46:16,433
- We should go up. - It's like a city in the future.

1243
00:46:16,434 --> 00:46:17,904
It is a futuristic city.

1244
00:46:18,103 --> 00:46:20,803
(Is the second hot place here in this future city-like place?)

1245
00:46:20,804 --> 00:46:22,903
Today really feels like spring.

1246
00:46:22,904 --> 00:46:25,143
It's spring in Busan.

1247
00:46:25,313 --> 00:46:28,243
- It's spring in Busan. - It's spring in Busan.

1248
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:30,883
Tae Oh wants to hear the Busan dialect.

1249
00:46:30,884 --> 00:46:32,184
Really, Tae Oh?

1250
00:46:33,713 --> 00:46:35,122
Do you want to hear the Busan dialect?

1251
00:46:35,123 --> 00:46:36,883
- Isn't this what you wanted? - Yes, it is.

1252
00:46:36,884 --> 00:46:37,884
- Hey. - Isn't it what you wanted?

1253
00:46:37,885 --> 00:46:40,253
Yes. It is so warm and friendly.

1254
00:46:41,494 --> 00:46:43,122
- Is it warm and friendly? - Nice.

1255
00:46:43,123 --> 00:46:44,192
This is Busan.

1256
00:46:44,193 --> 00:46:47,434
- Kyoung Pyo, this is Busan. - This is Busan.

1257
00:46:47,994 --> 00:46:50,404
Sun Bin and I were talking about titles.

1258
00:46:50,804 --> 00:46:54,602
We talked about how sensitive we get about titles and such...

1259
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:58,143
- starting in our 30s and onwards. - Right.

1260
00:46:58,543 --> 00:47:01,172
- The child actors call her aunt. - The child actors...

1261
00:47:01,173 --> 00:47:03,082
- Really? - I said, "You're dead."

1262
00:47:03,083 --> 00:47:04,913
It feels worse because it became more of a reality.

1263
00:47:04,914 --> 00:47:06,654
When I turned 40,

1264
00:47:06,983 --> 00:47:08,983
I was in the elevator, and a kid asked,

1265
00:47:09,684 --> 00:47:11,454
"Are you a comedian, old lady?"

1266
00:47:12,623 --> 00:47:14,023
"Come here. Which unit are you in?"

1267
00:47:14,724 --> 00:47:16,623
- "Come here." - Oh, no.

1268
00:47:16,864 --> 00:47:18,763
- Oh, gosh. - They weren't wrong.

1269
00:47:18,764 --> 00:47:21,832
- It is true. - For that kid, I am an old lady.

1270
00:47:21,833 --> 00:47:24,103
- The bread... - We're here for bread.

1271
00:47:24,963 --> 00:47:27,803
- This is a shopping mall. - Come on. It seems like it.

1272
00:47:27,804 --> 00:47:30,904
Right. There's a famous bakery here?

1273
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:33,672
(Enter the building that looks like a futuristic city, and...)

1274
00:47:33,673 --> 00:47:37,143
But something in here couldn't be fake, right?

1275
00:47:38,244 --> 00:47:40,252
Is there some famous bread here?

1276
00:47:40,253 --> 00:47:41,614
(There's a legendary bakery here?)

1277
00:47:42,923 --> 00:47:44,483
Will bread sold in a place like this...

1278
00:47:44,753 --> 00:47:46,292
- be unique? - Right.

1279
00:47:46,293 --> 00:47:47,353
(Suspicious)

1280
00:47:47,954 --> 00:47:49,022
But it must be hard...

1281
00:47:49,023 --> 00:47:51,364
- to make a fake store here. - Right.

1282
00:47:51,463 --> 00:47:53,494
- It's in a building. - Exactly.

1283
00:47:54,534 --> 00:47:55,602
- Something here can't be fake. - It's a normal...

1284
00:47:55,603 --> 00:47:57,534
- commercial building. - Exactly.

1285
00:47:58,733 --> 00:48:00,934
- I think this is it. - This must be it.

1286
00:48:01,873 --> 00:48:03,042
- Bakery? - Is this it?

1287
00:48:03,043 --> 00:48:04,102
- This... - The door over there.

1288
00:48:04,103 --> 00:48:06,042
- This is a really famous place. - Oh, really?

1289
00:48:06,043 --> 00:48:07,413
- Yes. - OPS.

1290
00:48:07,414 --> 00:48:08,414
Oh, it's OPS?

1291
00:48:08,415 --> 00:48:10,414
(Oh, this is OPS?)

1292
00:48:10,614 --> 00:48:14,482
(Eun I, Kyoung Pyo, and Mimi already know this bakery?)

1293
00:48:14,483 --> 00:48:15,723
- Do you know this brand? - I do.

1294
00:48:15,724 --> 00:48:16,982
(Eyes widening)

1295
00:48:16,983 --> 00:48:19,353
Hello. It does look famous.

1296
00:48:19,753 --> 00:48:20,823
What is this?

1297
00:48:20,824 --> 00:48:21,853
(This bakery is...)

1298
00:48:22,523 --> 00:48:24,243
(One of the most popular bakeries in Korea)

1299
00:48:24,623 --> 00:48:26,333
(In Daejeon, there is Sungsimdang.)

1300
00:48:27,393 --> 00:48:29,404
(In Busan, there is OPS!)

1301
00:48:29,534 --> 00:48:32,473
(It's a main tourist spot...)

1302
00:48:32,474 --> 00:48:34,579
(that was even introduced in a domestic travel guide.)

1303
00:48:34,603 --> 00:48:35,963
When you come to Busan, go to OPS.

1304
00:48:36,143 --> 00:48:37,803
- OPS. - OPS, of course.

1305
00:48:37,804 --> 00:48:39,014
OPS is the best.

1306
00:48:39,713 --> 00:48:42,184
(The citizens of Busan love...)

1307
00:48:43,114 --> 00:48:45,483
(this 40-year-old bakery.)

1308
00:48:46,384 --> 00:48:48,724
(A true Busan bakery)

1309
00:48:50,724 --> 00:48:53,164
(They have 15 locations in Seoul, Gyeonggi, Ulsan, and more.)

1310
00:48:54,523 --> 00:48:56,463
(The most popular bakery in Busan)

1311
00:48:56,693 --> 00:48:58,634
(The store is always crowded...)

1312
00:48:59,094 --> 00:49:01,393
(with people who want to taste their bread.)

1313
00:49:01,904 --> 00:49:05,474
(This trendy bakery in Busan consistently maintained...)

1314
00:49:05,974 --> 00:49:07,133
(the traditional and authentic taste for 40 years.)

1315
00:49:07,134 --> 00:49:11,502
(Is there fake legendary bread here?)

1316
00:49:11,503 --> 00:49:13,643
- What is this? - Oh, this place is definitely real.

1317
00:49:14,414 --> 00:49:15,913
- This can't be fake. - This place is real.

1318
00:49:15,914 --> 00:49:16,983
Look.

1319
00:49:18,094 --> 00:49:20,174
- What is this? - Oh, this place is definitely real.

1320
00:49:20,764 --> 00:49:22,294
- This can't be fake. - This place is real.

1321
00:49:22,295 --> 00:49:23,295
Look.

1322
00:49:26,001 --> 00:49:27,481
- What is this? - Why is Dae Ho here?

1323
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,770
"Chosen by Lee Dae Ho of the Giants."

1324
00:49:29,771 --> 00:49:30,810
"Giant Bread."

1325
00:49:31,211 --> 00:49:33,180
(This is suspicious.)

1326
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:36,279
(A poster of Lee Dae Ho at the entrance. Is it real?)

1327
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:37,280
Wait.

1328
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,180
- Oh, the smell of bread! - I love it.

1329
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:42,989
(I'm so excited.)

1330
00:49:42,990 --> 00:49:44,050
It smells so nice.

1331
00:49:44,051 --> 00:49:46,759
They have so many tasty things.

1332
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,329
- Oh, I'm going crazy! - That looks good.

1333
00:49:49,330 --> 00:49:50,650
(The store is filled with bread.)

1334
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:51,829
This looks the tastiest.

1335
00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:54,231
(Their unique signature line of bread)

1336
00:49:54,631 --> 00:49:56,401
That Before School is really famous too.

1337
00:49:57,171 --> 00:49:58,670
Right. That has to be good.

1338
00:49:58,671 --> 00:50:00,270
(A must-buy souvenir from Busan)

1339
00:50:00,271 --> 00:50:01,869
(Bread we used to eat before going to cram school)

1340
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:04,571
- Look at this strawberry cake. - Oh, my goodness.

1341
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,986
- Oh, my goodness. - Seriously. Oh, my goodness.

1342
00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:08,340
I'm so excited.

1343
00:50:08,341 --> 00:50:09,910
(Our bread lover is excited.)

1344
00:50:10,211 --> 00:50:13,251
I think I can eat more. I like bread, that's why.

1345
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,119
(Jaw dropping)

1346
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,191
Hey!

1347
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,290
(Gasping)

1348
00:50:18,291 --> 00:50:19,920
Oh, my goodness!

1349
00:50:19,921 --> 00:50:20,990
This is so...

1350
00:50:21,521 --> 00:50:22,760
No way.

1351
00:50:22,961 --> 00:50:25,300
- This is too natural. - This is...

1352
00:50:25,301 --> 00:50:26,759
- How can this be fake? - This is too real.

1353
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,300
Isn't this the most famous one?

1354
00:50:29,301 --> 00:50:32,100
(This bread caught our members' eyes?)

1355
00:50:32,401 --> 00:50:34,301
(Out of the displayed breads, )

1356
00:50:35,341 --> 00:50:38,071
(these really stand out.)

1357
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:39,880
(It's 5 times as big...)

1358
00:50:39,881 --> 00:50:41,341
(as a normal loaf of bread!)

1359
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,110
(It's a whole...)

1360
00:50:43,111 --> 00:50:44,810
(50cm long!)

1361
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:47,280
(Have you heard of me?)

1362
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:51,350
(Giant Bread)

1363
00:50:51,651 --> 00:50:54,220
(And the secret hidden inside of this giant bread)

1364
00:50:54,490 --> 00:50:57,490
(The inside of the bread rocked social media.)

1365
00:50:58,591 --> 00:51:01,830
(What surprise awaits us in Giant Bread?)

1366
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:05,270
A whole family could share one of these.

1367
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:06,770
- This is their signature menu. - Yes.

1368
00:51:06,771 --> 00:51:08,239
The most popular bread in Busan.

1369
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:11,410
Maybe it's a special item you can only eat here.

1370
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:13,941
- So this could be real or fake? - Exactly.

1371
00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:15,881
But on the other hand,

1372
00:51:15,981 --> 00:51:18,480
isn't this the easiest thing to fake?

1373
00:51:18,481 --> 00:51:20,551
- I think this is fake. - Why?

1374
00:51:21,321 --> 00:51:24,420
If this is such popular bread from Busan,

1375
00:51:24,421 --> 00:51:26,090
we must've seen it at least once on social media.

1376
00:51:26,091 --> 00:51:27,889
- I saw it on social media. - You did?

1377
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:29,929
(I saw it.)

1378
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:31,259
- You saw it? - I did.

1379
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:34,059
Mimi saw it. Why did it have to be Mimi?

1380
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:35,260
I really saw it.

1381
00:51:35,571 --> 00:51:36,671
No, this is real.

1382
00:51:37,731 --> 00:51:40,671
(It's really on social media?)

1383
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:43,840
This whole bread is the most famous.

1384
00:51:43,841 --> 00:51:45,480
This is famous. This is really famous.

1385
00:51:45,481 --> 00:51:48,341
(Does this bread that Mimi saw on social media actually exist?)

1386
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:50,750
- Hello. - Hello.

1387
00:51:50,751 --> 00:51:51,980
- Hello. - Hello.

1388
00:51:51,981 --> 00:51:54,920
- Is this that famous bread? - Yes, that's correct.

1389
00:51:54,921 --> 00:51:57,920
It's a signature menu that we launched this year.

1390
00:51:57,921 --> 00:52:00,320
- So it's the trendiest item now. - This one?

1391
00:52:00,321 --> 00:52:01,960
- So it hasn't been that long. - Right.

1392
00:52:01,961 --> 00:52:04,691
- That totally makes sense then. - Oh, really?

1393
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:07,030
Is Dae Ho the model for this bread?

1394
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:08,559
Yes. Well,

1395
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:11,501
they decide that at headquarters, so we... Yes.

1396
00:52:11,771 --> 00:52:12,800
That's true.

1397
00:52:12,801 --> 00:52:14,301
(Jae Seok noticed...)

1398
00:52:14,501 --> 00:52:16,670
(former baseball player Lee Dae Ho?)

1399
00:52:16,671 --> 00:52:18,010
Why is Dae Ho there?

1400
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,711
(The most legendary 4th batter of Joseon)

1401
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,509
(Lee Dae Ho of the Giants, the representative team of Busan, )

1402
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:25,981
(is the model for Giant Bread?)

1403
00:52:26,421 --> 00:52:27,779
Right. He is the most famous...

1404
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:29,190
- baseball player from Busan. - Right.

1405
00:52:29,191 --> 00:52:31,021
He is the most famous player from the Giants.

1406
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:33,389
Is this the trendiest bread?

1407
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:34,390
Jae Seok.

1408
00:52:34,391 --> 00:52:37,059
Do you have Dae Ho's number?

1409
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:39,700
- Can you call him? - But this bread...

1410
00:52:39,801 --> 00:52:42,270
Can't we ask someone outside?

1411
00:52:42,271 --> 00:52:45,071
You're really trying to do things the easy way.

1412
00:52:45,401 --> 00:52:47,599
Oh, I mean... Is that not allowed?

1413
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:50,171
There's bulgogi, pollack roe,

1414
00:52:50,671 --> 00:52:52,071
Gijang jeotgal, kelp...

1415
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:54,910
You're right. "Made with unique ingredients from Busan."

1416
00:52:55,910 --> 00:52:57,251
(Inside this giant bread)

1417
00:52:57,510 --> 00:52:58,751
(Daejeo tomato)

1418
00:52:59,021 --> 00:53:00,079
(Salmon and Gijang spring onion)

1419
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,160
(Gwangalli Eonyang bulgogi)

1420
00:53:01,251 --> 00:53:02,321
(Busan pollack roe)

1421
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:03,450
(Gijang jeotgal)

1422
00:53:04,551 --> 00:53:06,321
(And Gijang kelp)

1423
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,321
(Five special food from Busan...)

1424
00:53:08,961 --> 00:53:10,830
(are in one loaf of bread!)

1425
00:53:11,461 --> 00:53:13,731
(Busan's legendary bread with great size and flavor)

1426
00:53:13,930 --> 00:53:17,600
(Giant Bread is coming soon.)

1427
00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:19,901
This feels like a real trip.

1428
00:53:20,301 --> 00:53:22,739
- This is really amazing. - This is so nice.

1429
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:25,480
- Oh, gosh. - It's nice and warm.

1430
00:53:25,481 --> 00:53:26,881
So that bread...

1431
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,580
- It's a bit iffy. - Really?

1432
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,110
I like bulgogi and such.

1433
00:53:31,111 --> 00:53:32,457
- But the one at the end... - Kelp.

1434
00:53:32,481 --> 00:53:33,820
- Jeotgal? - Jeotgal.

1435
00:53:33,821 --> 00:53:35,590
- Gijang jeotgal... - Exactly.

1436
00:53:35,591 --> 00:53:38,350
But there's anchovy pasta.

1437
00:53:38,490 --> 00:53:39,889
- Oh, right. - Oh, like that.

1438
00:53:39,890 --> 00:53:41,759
It's the combination of anchovies and flour.

1439
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,730
We have an expert right here.

1440
00:53:43,731 --> 00:53:45,090
We have an expert right here.

1441
00:53:45,091 --> 00:53:48,160
Be quiet! Your friend is working here!

1442
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:50,329
(A front-row seat to their bickering show)

1443
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:52,841
Here they go again.

1444
00:53:52,870 --> 00:53:55,470
- We have an expert right here. - Anchovies and flour make sense.

1445
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,410
So if it's like that, I think it'd be okay.

1446
00:53:57,810 --> 00:53:59,780
- But... - But look. I'll talk.

1447
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:03,250
Baking five ingredients at the same time...

1448
00:54:03,251 --> 00:54:04,309
- could be hard. - It must be.

1449
00:54:04,310 --> 00:54:06,279
- Because the scents mix. - For example,

1450
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,580
tomatoes, anchovies,

1451
00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:10,389
- and seaweed... - Right.

1452
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:12,490
Must have different optimal baking times.

1453
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,091
Baking them all in one dough...

1454
00:54:15,530 --> 00:54:16,860
- It's not easy. - Does it make sense?

1455
00:54:16,861 --> 00:54:18,560
I took a technical approach.

1456
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:19,731
Right.

1457
00:54:19,930 --> 00:54:23,800
(The key is how they baked all 5 ingredients together.)

1458
00:54:23,801 --> 00:54:25,199
- It's here. - Oh, but that...

1459
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,739
- Your bread is here. - Hello.

1460
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:27,780
- It's here. - Here it is.

1461
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,571
You came at the perfect time.

1462
00:54:29,671 --> 00:54:32,509
- I'm so curious about the taste. - I think it'll be good.

1463
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:34,679
- How will this taste? - I think it'll be really good.

1464
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:36,251
(Bursting into laughter)

1465
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:38,610
(I think I can eat more?)

1466
00:54:38,611 --> 00:54:40,580
- It's so interesting. - Yes.

1467
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:42,620
Oh, goodness. There are so many interesting...

1468
00:54:43,490 --> 00:54:45,191
Oh, my. The filling...

1469
00:54:45,821 --> 00:54:46,861
- Oh, my. - Oh, my!

1470
00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:49,190
- Oh, like this? - Oh, my.

1471
00:54:49,191 --> 00:54:51,430
- Oh, my! - Oh, my!

1472
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:54,001
- It must be freshly baked. - This is...

1473
00:54:54,301 --> 00:54:55,900
- Oh, my. - This looks good.

1474
00:54:55,901 --> 00:54:58,006
(The members are so excited. What does the inside look like?)

1475
00:54:58,030 --> 00:55:00,370
(A giant, 50cm-long bread)

1476
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:04,010
(When you cut the loaf in half, )

1477
00:55:05,071 --> 00:55:07,310
(you'll be amazed.)

1478
00:55:10,810 --> 00:55:13,680
(Five flavors in one loaf of bread)

1479
00:55:14,151 --> 00:55:16,989
I wanted to make OPS...

1480
00:55:16,990 --> 00:55:19,421
the most famous bakery in Busan.

1481
00:55:19,521 --> 00:55:22,559
And I wanted to make bread...

1482
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:25,160
with five special ingredients from Busan.

1483
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:27,220
That's how I came up with it.

1484
00:55:28,731 --> 00:55:30,771
The five ingredients...

1485
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,670
are five local Busan food.

1486
00:55:33,671 --> 00:55:36,171
Gijang kelp and salted hairtail guts.

1487
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:39,840
I was inspired by the kelp and salted hairtail gut dip...

1488
00:55:39,841 --> 00:55:41,480
that people here have a lot during meals.

1489
00:55:41,481 --> 00:55:42,556
(1. Gijang kelp and salted hairtail guts)

1490
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:44,779
And we were already using...

1491
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:46,881
pollack roe in other items, so I used that.

1492
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:50,219
I used seaweed and pollack roe together.

1493
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:52,591
(2. Busan pollack roe and seaweed)

1494
00:55:53,361 --> 00:55:55,691
And an ingredient from nature, Daejeo tomato.

1495
00:55:55,861 --> 00:55:58,590
I got the idea from Daejeo tomatoes...

1496
00:55:58,591 --> 00:56:00,200
being used in pasta.

1497
00:56:00,901 --> 00:56:03,400
Salmon, a famous fish from Busan.

1498
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:05,030
And I used Gijang spring onion,

1499
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:07,639
an ingredient that goes well with salmon.

1500
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:09,570
(4. Smoked salmon and spring onion)

1501
00:56:09,571 --> 00:56:12,610
Including the general Busan and South Gyeongsang Province area,

1502
00:56:12,611 --> 00:56:17,280
Eonyang bulgogi is widely sold in Gwangalli. I used that...

1503
00:56:17,810 --> 00:56:20,720
in the bread because it's a flavor everyone likes.

1504
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:23,050
Because we use many ingredients,

1505
00:56:23,051 --> 00:56:24,920
this has to be done by hand.

1506
00:56:24,921 --> 00:56:26,020
When we add the fillings,

1507
00:56:26,021 --> 00:56:28,119
the bread gets cold.

1508
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:30,759
So it's very important to let it rise.

1509
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:32,290
We have to let it rise...

1510
00:56:32,291 --> 00:56:34,360
so the bread turns out big.

1511
00:56:34,361 --> 00:56:36,529
(The huge size and colorful flavors come from letting it rise!)

1512
00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:38,900
Seeing this bread

1513
00:56:38,901 --> 00:56:43,770
makes the customers think, "How can bread be this big?"

1514
00:56:43,771 --> 00:56:45,009
Many customers told us...

1515
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:46,110
that it's tastier than they thought...

1516
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:48,841
and that they think it would be popular.

1517
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:54,619
(It became popular on social media as soon as it was launched.)

1518
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:55,989
Sixth Sense members.

1519
00:56:55,990 --> 00:56:58,421
Is this item real?

1520
00:57:00,091 --> 00:57:04,160
(Giant Bread. Is this a real item on the menu?)

1521
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:05,659
- This is unbelievable. - Seriously.

1522
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:07,529
How did you create this recipe?

1523
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:08,530
Since we are...

1524
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:11,400
a local Busan company,

1525
00:57:11,401 --> 00:57:13,440
we wanted to use special foods from Busan.

1526
00:57:13,441 --> 00:57:15,671
- I see. - And we have Lotte Giants,

1527
00:57:16,010 --> 00:57:17,909
- the baseball team, right? - Right.

1528
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:20,679
- We wanted to root for them. - I see.

1529
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:22,881
So went a huge loaf of bread over 50cm long.

1530
00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:24,449
(Giant Bread for the Giants?)

1531
00:57:24,450 --> 00:57:25,849
- Oh, that's why it's big. - Yes.

1532
00:57:25,850 --> 00:57:27,849
We made it meaningful.

1533
00:57:27,850 --> 00:57:29,849
- Since they have Lotte Giants. - Right.

1534
00:57:29,850 --> 00:57:32,250
- And they did great this year. - Right.

1535
00:57:32,251 --> 00:57:34,290
Everyone in Busan loves the Giants.

1536
00:57:34,291 --> 00:57:35,659
- They are. - Of course.

1537
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:36,889
It does make sense.

1538
00:57:36,890 --> 00:57:40,131
What did the customers think of this item, chef?

1539
00:57:40,430 --> 00:57:43,000
At first, I thought we would get complaints.

1540
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:44,030
I see.

1541
00:57:44,301 --> 00:57:46,099
Because there is jeotgal inside.

1542
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:48,620
I thought there could be parts of it that customers don't like.

1543
00:57:48,841 --> 00:57:49,940
But more than complaints,

1544
00:57:49,941 --> 00:57:51,070
we received good responses.

1545
00:57:51,071 --> 00:57:52,809
- I see. - It's really popular right now.

1546
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:54,180
- Oh, really? - Yes.

1547
00:57:55,211 --> 00:57:58,080
- There's one filling in each. - I see.

1548
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:04,591
(This bread lets you have fun guessing which filling is inside.)

1549
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,421
- I'll cut it in half for you. - Okay.

1550
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,290
- Why do I want this to be real? - Look.

1551
00:58:09,291 --> 00:58:12,929
They just baked this, right?

1552
00:58:12,930 --> 00:58:14,559
But when they sell it,

1553
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,599
it will be cold, right?

1554
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:17,969
Like the ones displayed there?

1555
00:58:17,970 --> 00:58:20,300
- But people could heat it up. - You could heat it up.

1556
00:58:20,301 --> 00:58:21,540
- Heat it up? - Of course.

1557
00:58:21,541 --> 00:58:23,369
- People usually heat up bread. - We all...

1558
00:58:23,370 --> 00:58:25,309
- You can cut it and heat it up. - heat bread up.

1559
00:58:25,310 --> 00:58:28,210
People usually put bread in the freezer...

1560
00:58:28,211 --> 00:58:30,009
- if they can't eat it right away. - Right.

1561
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:32,779
You can put this in the freezer too.

1562
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:34,980
First, let's try one each.

1563
00:58:34,981 --> 00:58:36,119
- Shall we? - Let's talk while tasting it.

1564
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:37,420
What is this?

1565
00:58:37,421 --> 00:58:40,159
- Daejeo tomato. - This smells like pasta.

1566
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,160
(The first flavor is Daejeo tomato and cheese.)

1567
00:58:41,161 --> 00:58:42,420
- That must be good. - This has to be good.

1568
00:58:42,421 --> 00:58:44,329
- Because it's tomato sauce. - This has to be good.

1569
00:58:44,330 --> 00:58:46,010
- I think it'll taste like pizza. - Right.

1570
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:47,461
- Right. - Right.

1571
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:50,630
(Kyoung Pyo, who loves bread, takes a bite too.)

1572
00:58:50,631 --> 00:58:52,130
Oh, this is...

1573
00:58:52,131 --> 00:58:53,140
(Angry at how good it is)

1574
00:58:53,171 --> 00:58:56,239
- This is like spaghetti. - Right.

1575
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,639
It tastes just like dipping bread into tomato sauce.

1576
00:58:58,640 --> 00:58:59,710
- Yes. - Yes.

1577
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:01,231
(Like dipping bread into tomato sauce)

1578
00:59:01,881 --> 00:59:03,651
- Spaghetti. - Yes.

1579
00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:05,711
(Oh, my.)

1580
00:59:06,151 --> 00:59:08,020
They're really generous with the ingredients.

1581
00:59:08,021 --> 00:59:09,021
- Seriously. - You're right.

1582
00:59:09,022 --> 00:59:10,389
There's not only tomato.

1583
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:12,220
- There are olives and... - You're right.

1584
00:59:13,361 --> 00:59:14,921
This is delicious.

1585
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:16,889
I like it.

1586
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:17,929
I like it too.

1587
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:20,001
This is tasty.

1588
00:59:20,330 --> 00:59:22,099
- This is salmon, right? - Yes.

1589
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:24,330
If this doesn't taste good,

1590
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:26,970
- that wouldn't make sense. - Right.

1591
00:59:27,301 --> 00:59:29,100
(Opening his mouth wide)

1592
00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:31,170
There is salmon inside.

1593
00:59:31,171 --> 00:59:32,509
- Yes, big chunks. - Seriously.

1594
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:34,140
Cooked salmon is just...

1595
00:59:34,341 --> 00:59:35,510
(Can't help but smile)

1596
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:42,691
(The meeting of tender salmon and savory Gijang spring onion)

1597
00:59:43,421 --> 00:59:47,719
(Bread and fish. Will they go well together?)

1598
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:49,021
- But... - Oh, my.

1599
00:59:51,091 --> 00:59:52,091
It's good.

1600
00:59:52,330 --> 00:59:53,901
It tastes like a French dish.

1601
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:56,270
- I've never had anything like this. - Also...

1602
00:59:56,271 --> 00:59:58,231
- Right? - It seems familiar, but...

1603
00:59:58,301 --> 01:00:02,200
(Flaky salmon and spring onion! It's full of exotic aromas.)

1604
01:00:03,571 --> 01:00:04,639
It's a bit salty.

1605
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:05,739
(An honest opinion)

1606
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:08,310
(Jae Seok's strict evaluation)

1607
01:00:08,541 --> 01:00:09,809
- It's a bit salty for me too. Yes. - It is?

1608
01:00:09,810 --> 01:00:11,150
Do you not like it then?

1609
01:00:11,151 --> 01:00:12,279
It does taste good.

1610
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:13,619
I think opinions could vary.

1611
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:15,020
- I like it. - I like it.

1612
01:00:15,021 --> 01:00:16,950
- I like it. - I like this salmon filling.

1613
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:19,990
- It's good. - Yes.

1614
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:23,259
- Should we try Eonyang bulgogi? - The kelp...

1615
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:24,860
Should we try Eonyang bulgogi?

1616
01:00:24,861 --> 01:00:26,600
- The kelp... - Are you afraid of the kelp?

1617
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:29,231
Honestly, kelp...

1618
01:00:30,901 --> 01:00:32,969
(Childish Yu is hesitant about trying the kelp filling.)

1619
01:00:32,970 --> 01:00:33,970
Me too.

1620
01:00:34,541 --> 01:00:35,909
- To be honest, - I can't bring myself to try it.

1621
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:37,771
I can't get myself to try the kelp one.

1622
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:39,010
Seriously.

1623
01:00:39,111 --> 01:00:41,810
This is the real face of the Almighty Yu you know.

1624
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:44,360
He couldn't trust this bread, so he bought these two.

1625
01:00:44,881 --> 01:00:46,719
- I was curious about those. - I love that.

1626
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:48,449
- I just wanted to taste them. - I...

1627
01:00:48,450 --> 01:00:49,820
Strawberry jam sandwich.

1628
01:00:49,821 --> 01:00:51,220
A safe one.

1629
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:53,889
Let's eat the seaweed last.

1630
01:00:53,890 --> 01:00:54,890
- We'll eat the seaweed last? - The seaweed?

1631
01:00:54,891 --> 01:00:55,930
- Yes. - Oh, I'm scared.

1632
01:00:56,791 --> 01:00:58,659
- The kelp... - Let's skip the kelp.

1633
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:00,699
- I got it. - Then let's cut the bulgogi part.

1634
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:02,671
- I'll do it. - I'm too scared to eat the kelp.

1635
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:07,140
(Skillfully cutting the bread)

1636
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:09,670
Let's try the chives and kelp a bit later.

1637
01:01:09,671 --> 01:01:11,010
Let's do that.

1638
01:01:11,370 --> 01:01:12,509
Oh, kelp.

1639
01:01:12,510 --> 01:01:14,640
Aren't you cold? You look like the owner here.

1640
01:01:16,111 --> 01:01:18,010
- It suits you. - It does.

1641
01:01:18,481 --> 01:01:20,450
- You're very quiet. - Yes.

1642
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:24,390
(Cutting slowly)

1643
01:01:31,131 --> 01:01:32,760
But why are you taking so long?

1644
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:36,500
(Bursting into laughter)

1645
01:01:36,501 --> 01:01:38,570
When are you going to serve us, Tae Oh?

1646
01:01:38,571 --> 01:01:40,740
When do we get our bread?

1647
01:01:41,271 --> 01:01:43,840
You're crushing it into smithereens.

1648
01:01:43,841 --> 01:01:46,739
(You're crushing it into smithereens!)

1649
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:49,909
You're really crushing this part into smithereens.

1650
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:51,980
Look at this damaged piece.

1651
01:01:51,981 --> 01:01:52,981
(Damaged)

1652
01:01:52,982 --> 01:01:55,421
We're going to end up eating some of the paper too.

1653
01:01:56,521 --> 01:01:58,591
The paper has been whooped.

1654
01:01:59,461 --> 01:02:01,020
- "Whooped." - What is that?

1655
01:02:01,021 --> 01:02:02,731
- What is that, Mimi? - I don't know.

1656
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:05,259
- I cut it into three pieces. - Three pieces.

1657
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:06,780
- Have some of this. - Let's share it.

1658
01:02:06,930 --> 01:02:09,160
Oh, this must be delicious.

1659
01:02:09,801 --> 01:02:11,121
- Bulgogi. - Go ahead and cut it.

1660
01:02:12,870 --> 01:02:14,800
(How does Gwangalli bulgogi, )

1661
01:02:14,801 --> 01:02:17,910
(a specialty of the Busan and South Gyeongsang areas taste?)

1662
01:02:18,271 --> 01:02:20,010
(Traditional recipes are always the best.)

1663
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:22,540
- I knew it. This is the best. - Do you like this one best?

1664
01:02:23,111 --> 01:02:24,310
It's like hoppang.

1665
01:02:25,810 --> 01:02:27,820
Bulgogi is the best?

1666
01:02:27,821 --> 01:02:29,250
(Gwangalli bulgogi is sweet like hoppang.)

1667
01:02:29,251 --> 01:02:31,320
- I want them to really sell this. - This is tasty.

1668
01:02:31,321 --> 01:02:32,390
Oh, this is good.

1669
01:02:33,421 --> 01:02:34,790
This is in first place.

1670
01:02:34,791 --> 01:02:35,989
- It's in first place? - Yes.

1671
01:02:35,990 --> 01:02:36,990
This is in first place.

1672
01:02:36,991 --> 01:02:38,236
(Gwangalli bulgogi took first place.)

1673
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:39,829
Tae Oh, there's paper here.

1674
01:02:39,830 --> 01:02:43,099
(Tae Oh, there's paper here.)

1675
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:45,770
- I knew it. Oh, goodness. - Isn't it like that?

1676
01:02:45,771 --> 01:02:46,870
Oh, the paper...

1677
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,770
- Sir. - Oh, goodness.

1678
01:02:48,771 --> 01:02:51,140
Isn't it like that? Like a fortune cookie.

1679
01:02:52,010 --> 01:02:53,510
Should I take a look? It's folded.

1680
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,680
Oh, this... This is hard.

1681
01:02:58,810 --> 01:02:59,821
(Oh, my...)

1682
01:02:59,921 --> 01:03:01,620
The kelp is coming.

1683
01:03:02,321 --> 01:03:03,420
It's time for the seaweed.

1684
01:03:03,421 --> 01:03:04,591
- Yes. - Yes, that's correct.

1685
01:03:05,350 --> 01:03:07,461
- I can already smell the ocean. - Tae Oh. Hold on.

1686
01:03:08,620 --> 01:03:10,690
The bread smells like the ocean.

1687
01:03:10,691 --> 01:03:11,691
- It smells like the ocean. - Yes.

1688
01:03:11,692 --> 01:03:14,130
- It really smells like the ocean. - Yes.

1689
01:03:14,131 --> 01:03:15,360
It's not just the kelp.

1690
01:03:15,361 --> 01:03:16,800
- There's jeotgal inside too. - There's jeotgal too.

1691
01:03:16,801 --> 01:03:18,761
(Bread with the ocean inside. How does it taste?)

1692
01:03:19,131 --> 01:03:21,301
To be honest, I don't have the courage.

1693
01:03:22,271 --> 01:03:24,070
- Be brave. - I'll try.

1694
01:03:24,071 --> 01:03:25,071
Be brave.

1695
01:03:25,072 --> 01:03:26,279
(Pausing)

1696
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:27,840
I think this will taste better than the pollack roe one.

1697
01:03:27,841 --> 01:03:29,009
First of all...

1698
01:03:29,010 --> 01:03:31,711
First of all... This is that typical...

1699
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:34,550
(He keeps blabbering on.)

1700
01:03:34,551 --> 01:03:36,750
(Embarrassed)

1701
01:03:36,751 --> 01:03:38,290
(He bravely took a bite. How does it taste?)

1702
01:03:38,291 --> 01:03:39,659
The smell is already...

1703
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:42,190
(He bravely took a bite. How does it taste?)

1704
01:03:42,191 --> 01:03:44,759
I can already smell the ocean.

1705
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:47,660
(Everyone tries a bite.)

1706
01:03:47,801 --> 01:03:48,900
Let's see.

1707
01:03:48,901 --> 01:03:50,100
(Oh, my.)

1708
01:03:50,530 --> 01:03:51,699
It's not bad.

1709
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:52,770
(Gijang kelp is not bad.)

1710
01:03:52,771 --> 01:03:55,000
The kelp inside is so delicious.

1711
01:03:55,001 --> 01:03:56,341
- For me. - Me too.

1712
01:03:56,571 --> 01:03:57,869
- It could taste fishy. - Right.

1713
01:03:57,870 --> 01:03:59,211
- But it doesn't. - Seriously.

1714
01:03:59,481 --> 01:04:01,680
It's kind of like seaweed stew.

1715
01:04:03,350 --> 01:04:06,280
I think it'll be better if we eat it with more bread.

1716
01:04:06,821 --> 01:04:07,949
It's kind of like cheese.

1717
01:04:07,950 --> 01:04:09,650
- It's not a scary taste. - You're right.

1718
01:04:09,651 --> 01:04:11,690
With the bread, it's kind of...

1719
01:04:11,691 --> 01:04:14,361
If they had cut the kelp into smaller pieces...

1720
01:04:14,890 --> 01:04:17,259
- so that's easier to eat, - Into smaller pieces.

1721
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:19,329
- how would that have been? - Like a kelp puree.

1722
01:04:19,330 --> 01:04:20,400
Exactly.

1723
01:04:20,401 --> 01:04:21,759
Like a spread.

1724
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:23,829
- Exactly. - How would that have been?

1725
01:04:23,830 --> 01:04:24,830
Exactly.

1726
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:26,377
(What if they used kelp puree instead of big chunks of kelp?)

1727
01:04:26,401 --> 01:04:31,510
(The chunks of kelp are hard to eat. Is this place fake?)

1728
01:04:31,841 --> 01:04:33,340
I think this place is real.

1729
01:04:33,341 --> 01:04:34,881
- Why? - They seem serious.

1730
01:04:36,381 --> 01:04:37,949
(Serious)

1731
01:04:37,950 --> 01:04:40,751
Tae Oh is really doing this with his sixth sense.

1732
01:04:41,180 --> 01:04:42,380
Feeling and intuition...

1733
01:04:42,381 --> 01:04:43,591
- over evidence. - Because...

1734
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:48,461
I think they could perfectly make the evidence.

1735
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:53,000
We eat loaves of bread for a long time.

1736
01:04:53,001 --> 01:04:55,900
- It's bigger than other breads. - Right.

1737
01:04:55,901 --> 01:04:58,670
For that, the ingredients inside...

1738
01:04:58,671 --> 01:05:00,940
You can't think too deeply about it.

1739
01:05:00,941 --> 01:05:03,510
(You can't think too deeply about it!)

1740
01:05:03,841 --> 01:05:05,410
Then what are we supposed to do?

1741
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:07,179
With our intuition...

1742
01:05:07,180 --> 01:05:09,381
- So what? - Did someone give you a mission?

1743
01:05:10,010 --> 01:05:12,480
He's saying the opposite of everything I say.

1744
01:05:12,481 --> 01:05:13,481
You're right.

1745
01:05:13,821 --> 01:05:16,080
- So what? - Did someone give you a mission?

1746
01:05:16,521 --> 01:05:18,290
- Are you a spy? - A spy!

1747
01:05:18,291 --> 01:05:19,291
- He's a spy, isn't he? - Are you a spy?

1748
01:05:19,292 --> 01:05:20,720
Is he the fake one?

1749
01:05:21,890 --> 01:05:24,861
(Kang Tae Oh, fake)

1750
01:05:25,131 --> 01:05:28,059
If we want to suspect the first place...

1751
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:31,370
For it being something inspired by Admiral Yi Sun Sin,

1752
01:05:32,001 --> 01:05:34,070
the menu seems a bit too normal.

1753
01:05:34,071 --> 01:05:37,370
(The menu is too normal for a Admiral Yi Sun Sin concept?)

1754
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,110
Maybe it's something like that.

1755
01:05:40,111 --> 01:05:42,409
People always have a reason for eating those dishes.

1756
01:05:42,410 --> 01:05:43,880
- Beef bone soup and such. - Right.

1757
01:05:43,881 --> 01:05:46,279
So they decided on the menu,

1758
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:47,550
and then chose the concept.

1759
01:05:47,551 --> 01:05:48,780
That's too weak.

1760
01:05:49,180 --> 01:05:50,489
The owner...

1761
01:05:50,490 --> 01:05:51,750
Why do you keep opposing Sun Bin?

1762
01:05:51,751 --> 01:05:53,360
- Seriously. - Why are you so cold?

1763
01:05:53,361 --> 01:05:55,059
- Hey, come here. - You're being too mean.

1764
01:05:55,060 --> 01:05:57,259
- Hey, come here. - You shot a drama together.

1765
01:05:57,260 --> 01:05:58,429
Why are you so mean to Sun Bin?

1766
01:05:58,430 --> 01:06:00,160
What happened to "The Potato Lab?"

1767
01:06:00,501 --> 01:06:02,930
Because we're so close... Yes.

1768
01:06:03,231 --> 01:06:04,791
Do you really think that place is fake?

1769
01:06:04,830 --> 01:06:06,699
It was because the owner...

1770
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:09,940
- gave meaning to everything. - Right.

1771
01:06:09,941 --> 01:06:12,710
- If I were the owner, - That part was fishy, indeed.

1772
01:06:12,711 --> 01:06:15,610
I'd make menus with special meaning.

1773
01:06:15,611 --> 01:06:16,779
- For someone like him. - It wasn't convincing enough.

1774
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:18,480
Exactly. This was what I thought.

1775
01:06:18,481 --> 01:06:21,119
There is something like Admiral Yi Sun Sin Meal.

1776
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:23,290
It's based on the Admiral Yi's diet.

1777
01:06:23,291 --> 01:06:24,891
Are they the dishes he used to eat?

1778
01:06:25,490 --> 01:06:27,689
(Does it really exist?)

1779
01:06:27,690 --> 01:06:30,190
- There's Admiral Yi's Meal. - I have no idea.

1780
01:06:30,330 --> 01:06:32,360
That was the fake place we fabricated last season.

1781
01:06:34,301 --> 01:06:36,869
- Jae Seok. - You've just lost credibility.

1782
01:06:36,870 --> 01:06:38,699
- That's not it. - In this case...

1783
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:41,170
- Keep your mouth shut. - Come on.

1784
01:06:41,171 --> 01:06:43,040
- In this case... - I really thought to myself,

1785
01:06:43,041 --> 01:06:45,141
- "Cool." Didn't you think the same? - Yes.

1786
01:06:45,270 --> 01:06:47,780
Was it a fake one?

1787
01:06:48,011 --> 01:06:49,491
(Sixth Sense Season 2, July 23, 2021)

1788
01:06:50,181 --> 01:06:52,010
(A legend's restaurant fabricated by the staff)

1789
01:06:52,011 --> 01:06:54,531
(Admiral Yi Sun Sin's Meal created through historical research)

1790
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:57,020
(Devouring the fake dish)

1791
01:06:57,251 --> 01:06:59,720
(He did enjoy it.)

1792
01:06:59,721 --> 01:07:01,689
- Come to think of it, - I'm curious.

1793
01:07:01,690 --> 01:07:03,630
Everything I liked was a fake.

1794
01:07:03,631 --> 01:07:04,966
(Fake radar, Everything I liked was a fake!)

1795
01:07:04,990 --> 01:07:06,829
They cooked it...

1796
01:07:06,830 --> 01:07:08,659
- to your liking. - I think so.

1797
01:07:08,660 --> 01:07:09,699
That's possible.

1798
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:12,029
In a way, they're making...

1799
01:07:12,030 --> 01:07:13,869
what's trendy...

1800
01:07:13,870 --> 01:07:16,000
or what's unique...

1801
01:07:16,001 --> 01:07:18,211
- like a seasonal pop-up store. - Like a pop-up store.

1802
01:07:18,740 --> 01:07:21,580
In that case, that menu makes sense.

1803
01:07:21,711 --> 01:07:24,910
Whenever we say something, they all sound plausible.

1804
01:07:25,110 --> 01:07:27,681
I wish the cave would be total nonsense.

1805
01:07:28,551 --> 01:07:30,421
This is it. This is fake.

1806
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:32,790
- It's so complicated. - It is.

1807
01:07:32,791 --> 01:07:35,319
Tae Oh, why are you smiling...

1808
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:36,690
when we say stuff like this?

1809
01:07:36,891 --> 01:07:38,530
(Smiling)

1810
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:40,761
- By the way, you look good in blue. - Yes.

1811
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:42,130
Suddenly?

1812
01:07:42,131 --> 01:07:43,300
You look good in blue.

1813
01:07:43,301 --> 01:07:44,529
(What?)

1814
01:07:44,530 --> 01:07:45,630
I've been wanting to say that.

1815
01:07:45,631 --> 01:07:47,540
Are you selling clothes or what?

1816
01:07:47,541 --> 01:07:48,970
Blue...

1817
01:07:48,971 --> 01:07:51,541
- looks especially good on you. - I'm confused.

1818
01:07:51,770 --> 01:07:53,810
He has changed a lot.

1819
01:07:53,811 --> 01:07:56,210
On our way here, he stared at Mimi and said,

1820
01:07:56,211 --> 01:07:57,979
(Your eyes are pretty.)

1821
01:07:57,980 --> 01:07:59,920
"Your eyes are pretty." It was out of the blue.

1822
01:07:59,921 --> 01:08:00,979
He flirted with her.

1823
01:08:00,980 --> 01:08:03,891
- Did you flirt with her? - He was flirty.

1824
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:05,189
(Glancing)

1825
01:08:05,190 --> 01:08:06,819
Your hair color is so pretty.

1826
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:09,791
(So pretty)

1827
01:08:09,891 --> 01:08:12,830
Then he wanted to say something to me too, so he said,

1828
01:08:13,230 --> 01:08:14,800
"That red coat looks amazing on you."

1829
01:08:14,801 --> 01:08:16,130
(A dry comment)

1830
01:08:16,131 --> 01:08:17,400
He didn't even look at my face.

1831
01:08:17,530 --> 01:08:18,900
- Hey. - What's up with you?

1832
01:08:19,171 --> 01:08:21,239
- The coat is so beautiful. - Goodness.

1833
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:23,971
- It matches your glasses well. - Don't worry about it.

1834
01:08:24,070 --> 01:08:25,569
You with the red coat...

1835
01:08:25,570 --> 01:08:27,041
- and me with the blue. - Blue.

1836
01:08:27,381 --> 01:08:29,610
- As for both of us... - He doesn't look at our faces.

1837
01:08:30,051 --> 01:08:31,810
- He won't even meet the eyes. - He sees only colors.

1838
01:08:31,811 --> 01:08:33,680
- He sees you as colors. - Don't get me wrong.

1839
01:08:33,681 --> 01:08:36,051
- Okay. I get what you're like. - I got it.

1840
01:08:36,150 --> 01:08:38,690
- I understand your style now. - It's a misunderstanding.

1841
01:08:38,791 --> 01:08:40,860
I'm so happy to see Tae Oh.

1842
01:08:41,261 --> 01:08:43,029
We need a crazy one like him on variety shows.

1843
01:08:43,030 --> 01:08:44,660
- He's crazy. - Gosh, Tae Oh is...

1844
01:08:44,730 --> 01:08:46,060
(A variety show genius that Jae Seok has his eye on)

1845
01:08:46,061 --> 01:08:47,461
For goodness' sake.

1846
01:08:48,431 --> 01:08:51,971
(Anyway, what's the truth behind the Giant Bread?)

1847
01:08:53,101 --> 01:08:56,440
Yes. Hello. Hey, you're having the bread.

1848
01:08:57,910 --> 01:08:59,471
Please enjoy. Hello.

1849
01:08:59,610 --> 01:09:01,141
They do buy the Giant Bread.

1850
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:03,410
- Hello. - They're buying it. Hello.

1851
01:09:03,551 --> 01:09:05,279
I saw them buying the Giant Bread.

1852
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:06,779
- Who? - They just bought it.

1853
01:09:06,780 --> 01:09:08,750
- It's real. - Enjoy.

1854
01:09:08,751 --> 01:09:09,819
- Enjoy. - Do you know about this bread?

1855
01:09:09,820 --> 01:09:10,890
- Is it popular? - Good luck.

1856
01:09:10,891 --> 01:09:11,891
Yes.

1857
01:09:12,150 --> 01:09:14,391
- She said, "Yes." - She said, "Yes."

1858
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:16,360
Right. She just said, "Yes."

1859
01:09:17,591 --> 01:09:19,800
(Busan's Giant Bread)

1860
01:09:19,801 --> 01:09:22,260
(1. A reasonable story behind developing the bread)

1861
01:09:22,261 --> 01:09:23,430
(2. A famous bakery with a 40-year history)

1862

(The third legend of Busan: Cave)

1866
01:09:31,910 --> 01:09:33,579
They had such a big car.

1867
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:35,239
- I love that we're going together. - I know.

1868
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:36,610
It's such a nice car.

1869
01:09:36,780 --> 01:09:37,850
(Relaxed)

1870
01:09:37,851 --> 01:09:39,451
(Tae Oh in the passenger seat is happy.)

1871
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:41,950
Tae Oh is up in the front.

1872
01:09:42,150 --> 01:09:43,596
You're lost in thought again, aren't you?

1873
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:45,050
I love a passenger seat.

1874
01:09:45,051 --> 01:09:47,620
This is driving me crazy. He's usually not like that.

1875
01:09:47,761 --> 01:09:49,060
It's so frustrating.

1876
01:09:49,061 --> 01:09:50,729
- Why? - It feels so unfair.

1877
01:09:50,730 --> 01:09:53,261
- Is he in acting mode? - It's crazy. Yes.

1878
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:54,900
It's a misunderstanding.

1879
01:09:55,061 --> 01:09:57,330
When people around you aren't normal,

1880
01:09:57,471 --> 01:09:58,899
- the only normal person, me, - He's talking to the camera.

1881
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:00,341
Looks abnormal.

1882
01:10:00,870 --> 01:10:02,470
He continues to talk alone.

1883
01:10:02,471 --> 01:10:03,940
There are people like him.

1884
01:10:04,171 --> 01:10:07,110
Those who talk to the camera by oneself.

1885
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:09,380
There's over 60 percent chance that they're crazy.

1886
01:10:09,381 --> 01:10:11,579
No. It's 100 percent.

1887
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:12,779
(Did I get busted?)

1888
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:15,149
I don't think he's nervous.

1889
01:10:15,150 --> 01:10:17,689
- Is he just enjoying the concept? - I think so.

1890
01:10:17,690 --> 01:10:19,751
We're nervous because of him.

1891
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:21,120
Seriously.

1892
01:10:21,121 --> 01:10:22,519
I'm nervous what he'll say.

1893
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:24,290
That one is a cuckoo.

1894
01:10:24,291 --> 01:10:26,067
(Tae Oh is making Almighty Yu nervous with his charms.)

1895
01:10:26,091 --> 01:10:29,061
Do you know about the place that we're going now?

1896
01:10:29,301 --> 01:10:31,729
Why does he talk to the driver all of a sudden?

1897
01:10:31,730 --> 01:10:34,841
- He's been building rapport. - They're talking friendly.

1898
01:10:34,971 --> 01:10:37,070
Sir, this is Busan, isn't it?

1899
01:10:38,311 --> 01:10:40,140
(A sudden silence)

1900
01:10:40,141 --> 01:10:41,810
- That's not it. - No?

1901
01:10:41,811 --> 01:10:44,010
Sir, aren't you from Busan?

1902
01:10:44,011 --> 01:10:45,551
- I'm from Seoul. - From Seoul.

1903
01:10:45,711 --> 01:10:47,319
(He talked with the accent to the wrong person.)

1904
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:48,880
The driver is from Seoul.

1905
01:10:48,881 --> 01:10:52,051
- He came with our staff. - The car came from Seoul.

1906
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:55,260
- We were surprised on our way out. - Why?

1907
01:10:55,261 --> 01:10:57,460
- People did buy the Giant Bread. - That's right.

1908
01:10:57,461 --> 01:10:58,689
I asked the lady.

1909
01:10:58,690 --> 01:11:00,699
"Have you had it before?"

1910
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:02,340
- And she said, "Yes." - She said, "Yes."

1911
01:11:02,530 --> 01:11:04,369
(Mimi investigated...)

1912
01:11:04,370 --> 01:11:05,970
(the customer who was buying the Bread.)

1913
01:11:06,270 --> 01:11:09,040
Gosh. It's really hard to tell.

1914
01:11:09,041 --> 01:11:11,171
- It's a real place. - Is it?

1915
01:11:11,541 --> 01:11:12,811
Should I trust you on this?

1916
01:11:12,971 --> 01:11:16,310
When you look at the owners carefully, they have weak points.

1917
01:11:16,311 --> 01:11:18,511
- The first owner had them. - I see.

1918
01:11:18,650 --> 01:11:20,680
But back in the bakery, he didn't have one.

1919
01:11:20,681 --> 01:11:21,779
(The owner of the 1st place had a weak point?)

1920
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:23,150
What kind of weak point was it?

1921
01:11:23,751 --> 01:11:25,890
- What? - What was his weak point?

1922
01:11:25,891 --> 01:11:28,261
I see a lot of weak points about you.

1923
01:11:28,421 --> 01:11:31,529
If you were right, I'd feel offended.

1924
01:11:31,530 --> 01:11:32,560
(Blunt Brother criticizes him sharply.)

1925
01:11:32,561 --> 01:11:34,899
I'll be the only one who guesses correctly.

1926
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:37,699
The one who played a critical role in getting the place right...

1927
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:39,199
will get a coffee truck.

1928
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:40,300
- Isn't it nice? - I see.

1929
01:11:40,301 --> 01:11:41,439
Or there's...

1930
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:43,269
I think that's the worst penalty.

1931
01:11:43,270 --> 01:11:44,739
Post on your social media...

1932
01:11:44,740 --> 01:11:47,010
with the Y2K vibe without any explanations.

1933
01:11:47,011 --> 01:11:49,210
- Come on. Really? - You can't explain about it.

1934
01:11:49,211 --> 01:11:51,287
You have to post a teary selfie or something like that.

1935
01:11:51,311 --> 01:11:52,380
(Mimi, do you remember the 1st penalty?)

1936
01:11:52,381 --> 01:11:53,720
(Life is about romance, not workout.)

1937
01:11:53,721 --> 01:11:55,197
(I'll try to be romantic until romance fills me up.)

1938
01:11:55,221 --> 01:11:57,819
- That's terrible. - Yes. As if you broke up today.

1939
01:11:57,820 --> 01:11:59,189
It'll be funny if Sun Bin writes,

1940
01:11:59,190 --> 01:12:00,690
"I miss him terribly tonight."

1941
01:12:02,391 --> 01:12:04,730
- Oh, no. - If she says so,

1942
01:12:05,131 --> 01:12:06,801
there will be articles on it.

1943
01:12:07,030 --> 01:12:08,359
Gosh. Please, no.

1944
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:09,560
If others get the penalty, I'll be fine.

1945
01:12:09,561 --> 01:12:12,069
- It just can't be me. - Right. It just can't be me.

1946
01:12:12,070 --> 01:12:13,870
What is the third one, the cave?

1947
01:12:14,070 --> 01:12:16,100
Is there a cave in Busan?

1948
01:12:16,101 --> 01:12:17,621
- A cave? - Exactly. Where's the cave?

1949
01:12:18,910 --> 01:12:22,010
In my opinion, it's a restaurant in a cave.

1950
01:12:22,011 --> 01:12:23,210
A restaurant in a cave.

1951
01:12:23,211 --> 01:12:25,449
You eat in a cave.

1952
01:12:25,450 --> 01:12:26,979
Will they slice the raw fish on the spot...

1953
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:28,649
- from the cave near the sea? - Raw fish?

1954
01:12:28,650 --> 01:12:29,810
(Slicing raw fish in a cave?)

1955
01:12:29,881 --> 01:12:31,050
It's a restaurant in a cave...

1956
01:12:31,051 --> 01:12:33,320
where you can dip your feet in water.

1957
01:12:33,690 --> 01:12:36,090
There might be doctor fish in it.

1958
01:12:36,091 --> 01:12:37,790
Do you know about that fish?

1959
01:12:37,791 --> 01:12:39,230
Look at him.

1960
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:40,800
His imagination has no limit.

1961
01:12:40,801 --> 01:12:42,659
Aren't you going to stay still?

1962
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:45,471
So, you exfoliate your feet while eating?

1963
01:12:45,830 --> 01:12:47,439
Gosh. That's so...

1964
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:48,699
The fish eats.

1965
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:50,470
- And I eat too. - Both of us are eating.

1966
01:12:50,471 --> 01:12:54,079
I saw many eccentric restaurants like that on social media.

1967
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:56,311
What does it have to do with a cave?

1968
01:12:56,541 --> 01:12:58,979
It's to enjoy the vibe of the cave...

1969
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:00,921
while you're eating.

1970
01:13:01,251 --> 01:13:03,390
This is not a place for a cave.

1971
01:13:03,391 --> 01:13:05,189
- They're all houses. - Exactly.

1972
01:13:05,190 --> 01:13:06,220
(A cave in the alleyway of houses?)

1973
01:13:06,221 --> 01:13:08,989
- It's a highland. - It's high in altitude, right?

1974
01:13:08,990 --> 01:13:11,931
We have to observe carefully from the way to the place.

1975
01:13:12,431 --> 01:13:13,671
I want to get the right answer.

1976
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:15,761
There's a cave here?

1977
01:13:16,671 --> 01:13:18,399
- Thank you for driving. - Let's go.

1978
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:19,671
Thank you.

1979
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:22,141
By the way, this place is pretty too.

1980
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:24,569
It's such a pretty town.

1981
01:13:24,570 --> 01:13:27,840
It's similar to Gamcheon Culture Village.

1982
01:13:27,841 --> 01:13:29,140
It feels a little like it.

1983
01:13:29,141 --> 01:13:30,850
(You can see the view of Beomil-dong, Dong-gu, Busan...)

1984
01:13:30,851 --> 01:13:32,010
(at a glance.)

1985
01:13:32,011 --> 01:13:33,551
This must be Beomil-dong.

1986
01:13:34,721 --> 01:13:38,390
(When the night comes, the lights turn on one by one.)

1987
01:13:38,391 --> 01:13:39,950
It's really pretty.

1988
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:43,490
There's an artwork by Lee Jung Seob.

1989
01:13:43,690 --> 01:13:45,761
I see. The artist Lee Jung Seob?

1990
01:13:47,330 --> 01:13:50,269
(Lee Jung Seob, Korea's well-known modern painter)

1991
01:13:50,270 --> 01:13:52,801
(During the Korean war, he lived in Beomil-dong, Busan.)

1992
01:13:53,601 --> 01:13:56,440
(To celebrate the painter who left various masterpieces, )

1993
01:13:56,740 --> 01:14:02,409
(the steps he had taken...)

1994
01:14:02,410 --> 01:14:07,921
(are kept in Lee Jung Seob Street.)

1995
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:11,689
- It's such a pretty town. - Exactly.

1996
01:14:11,690 --> 01:14:15,019
It's rare to see this kind of pretty town.

1997
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:16,060
You're right.

1998
01:14:16,061 --> 01:14:18,466
- The vibe doesn't exist anymore. - You have to look for it to see it.

1999
01:14:18,490 --> 01:14:21,600
Next to us are the paintings by Lee Jung Seob.

2000
01:14:21,601 --> 01:14:23,329
- There are his paintings. - You're right.

2001
01:14:23,330 --> 01:14:24,829
- I think it's the drawing on foil. - You're right.

2002
01:14:24,830 --> 01:14:27,800
Because he was struggling with money,

2003
01:14:27,801 --> 01:14:30,409
he drew on the foil paper of a cigarette.

2004
01:14:30,410 --> 01:14:31,810
He drew a lot on such paper.

2005
01:14:31,811 --> 01:14:34,239
- And each step has a painting. - Yes.

2006
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:35,880
- When you look back, - It's down there.

2007
01:14:35,881 --> 01:14:38,550
- That's true. - you can see a picture.

2008
01:14:38,551 --> 01:14:40,180
(When you look back while going down the stairs...)

2009
01:14:40,181 --> 01:14:41,950
Gosh. It's a person.

2010
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:44,721
- They are faces. - You're right.

2011
01:14:45,650 --> 01:14:48,290
This place is filled with Lee Jung Seob's paintings.

2012
01:14:48,291 --> 01:14:49,291
(This is the Beomil-dong's trendy spot on social media.)

2013
01:14:49,292 --> 01:14:52,329
Gosh. There are some sentences throughout out the street.

2014
01:14:52,330 --> 01:14:53,600
They are the letters from him...

2015
01:14:53,601 --> 01:14:55,230
to his children and his wife he loved.

2016
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:58,471
My sweet Nam Deok.

2017
01:14:59,070 --> 01:15:01,030
- I may look like a lazy one. - They lived apart.

2018
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:03,886
- I'm getting stronger unhurriedly. - His wife and kids lived in Japan.

2019
01:15:03,910 --> 01:15:05,471
I am confident.

2020
01:15:06,610 --> 01:15:10,311
I will show that I can make Nam Deok happy.

2021
01:15:10,811 --> 01:15:11,880
- Jae Seok. - Yes.

2022
01:15:11,881 --> 01:15:12,949
Have you written a letter...

2023
01:15:12,950 --> 01:15:14,149
- like this to your wife? - Like what?

2024
01:15:14,150 --> 01:15:16,720
Your letter is coming late.

2025
01:15:16,721 --> 01:15:19,690
Are you or the children lying in bed with a cold?

2026
01:15:20,690 --> 01:15:21,761
I can text her.

2027
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:25,030
Your message on the app...

2028
01:15:25,761 --> 01:15:27,330
He's not romantic at all.

2029
01:15:29,301 --> 01:15:30,501
This town is really...

2030
01:15:31,570 --> 01:15:33,000
- filled with good old vibes. - Right?

2031
01:15:33,001 --> 01:15:34,500
- Yes. It's so pretty. - Yes.

2032
01:15:34,501 --> 01:15:36,300
(The vibe of the alleyway in Busan they encounter by chance...)

2033
01:15:36,301 --> 01:15:37,511
(on their way to the cave)

2034
01:15:37,711 --> 01:15:40,180
It's very peaceful.

2035
01:15:40,181 --> 01:15:41,909
- Right? - It's quiet.

2036
01:15:41,910 --> 01:15:44,250
- It makes me peaceful. - Yes. You're right.

2037
01:15:44,251 --> 01:15:45,251
Right?

2038
01:15:45,711 --> 01:15:46,880
It's been a while since I walked...

2039
01:15:46,881 --> 01:15:48,351
- like this. I love it. - Right.

2040
01:15:49,721 --> 01:15:52,551
There used to be walls like this when I was young.

2041
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:55,519
It's the wall from my childhood memory.

2042
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:56,989
(The Lee Jung Seob Street in Beomil-dong...)

2043
01:15:56,990 --> 01:15:59,591
(reminds them of the memory from their childhood.)

2044
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:03,029
The father is sentimentalized.

2045
01:16:03,030 --> 01:16:05,130
(Na Eun's father got sentimental by the town's friendly vibe.)

2046
01:16:05,131 --> 01:16:06,370
Look.

2047
01:16:06,730 --> 01:16:08,370
I want to sit here.

2048
01:16:09,770 --> 01:16:13,040
I love how they placed them so cozily and nicely.

2049
01:16:13,041 --> 01:16:14,479
(You can almost hear the elders of the town chatting...)

2050
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:15,910
(from the chairs placed together.)

2051
01:16:16,110 --> 01:16:18,680
- You look so good on it. - I do, right?

2052
01:16:18,681 --> 01:16:21,450
- Are you tired? - I'd sit here and watch.

2053
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:23,551
In the past, I couldn't understand it.

2054
01:16:24,490 --> 01:16:26,119
The elders of the town sit outside like this.

2055
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:28,519
- "Aren't they bored?" - That's right.

2056
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:31,530
But now, when I sit on it, I just watch the passersby...

2057
01:16:32,030 --> 01:16:33,330
and the cars.

2058
01:16:33,801 --> 01:16:35,830
- He's Rejuvenated-ping. - Rejuvenated-ping.

2059
01:16:36,101 --> 01:16:37,671
Rejuvenated-ping.

2060
01:16:38,070 --> 01:16:40,030
Gosh. I love it. I can't help but pose like this.

2061
01:16:40,301 --> 01:16:42,540
- Why don't you two sit together? - Gosh.

2062
01:16:42,541 --> 01:16:44,341
It'll look really cute.

2063
01:16:44,410 --> 01:16:45,410
Come.

2064
01:16:45,570 --> 01:16:47,479
It'll be cute. Look at that.

2065
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:48,640
The back of your coat is wide open.

2066
01:16:48,641 --> 01:16:50,287
(The best couple, Rejuvenated-ping and Ms. Song)

2067
01:16:50,311 --> 01:16:51,350
- Don't look at my back. - One,

2068
01:16:51,351 --> 01:16:53,080
- Look forward. - two, three.

2069
01:16:53,381 --> 01:16:56,080
- Gosh. This is nice. - You're so cute.

2070
01:16:56,780 --> 01:16:57,921
You two look lovely.

2071
01:16:58,791 --> 01:16:59,791
Red and blue.

2072
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:02,390
- You're Taegeuk-ping. - "Taegeuk-ping."

2073
01:17:02,391 --> 01:17:03,421
Taegeuk-ping.

2074
01:17:04,190 --> 01:17:06,489
- "Taegeuk-ping." - Taegeuk-ping.

2075
01:17:06,490 --> 01:17:08,630
- Taegeuk-ping is so funny. - We're Taegeuk-ping.

2076
01:17:08,631 --> 01:17:09,699
You look adorable.

2077
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:10,899
- You're patriots. - Taegeuk-ping is so funny.

2078
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:11,970
(Mimi is proud.)

2079
01:17:11,971 --> 01:17:13,301
Hello.

2080
01:17:13,740 --> 01:17:15,899
- Happy New Year. - Happy New Year.

2081
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:17,440
- Hello. - Hold on.

2082
01:17:17,811 --> 01:17:20,541
- A cave should be up there. - Right.

2083
01:17:20,841 --> 01:17:22,779
- But it's down here? - Oh, my gat kimchi.

2084
01:17:22,780 --> 01:17:25,479
- Oh, my gat kimchi. - Oh, my gat kimchi.

2085
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:26,650
Oh, my gas stove.

2086
01:17:28,051 --> 01:17:29,350
(It's unbelievable!)

2087
01:17:29,351 --> 01:17:31,290
- "It's unbelievable." - "It's unbelievable."

2088
01:17:31,291 --> 01:17:34,221
Why do you say that? Please be careful.

2089
01:17:35,091 --> 01:17:36,091
- That was cute. - She almost fell.

2090
01:17:36,092 --> 01:17:38,989
The kids kept their cool,

2091
01:17:38,990 --> 01:17:41,001
- but their mother couldn't. - She was so cute.

2092
01:17:41,601 --> 01:17:42,921
Gosh. It's the last spot already.

2093
01:17:43,261 --> 01:17:44,970
(Out of the blue?)

2094
01:17:44,971 --> 01:17:47,970
- It's not the last one. - Which show are you from?

2095
01:17:47,971 --> 01:17:49,800
This isn't your video log.

2096
01:17:49,801 --> 01:17:50,870
(Laughing)

2097
01:17:50,971 --> 01:17:53,680
It breaks my heart that it'll be over after this. It's sad.

2098
01:17:53,681 --> 01:17:54,987
(It's sad that the Sixth Sense Tour is coming to an end.)

2099
01:17:55,011 --> 01:17:56,041
What is this?

2100
01:17:57,551 --> 01:17:59,380
- Is this it? - I think this is it.

2101
01:17:59,381 --> 01:18:01,120
- Here? - It seems it has nothing...

2102
01:18:01,251 --> 01:18:03,096
- This place is a little... - to do with a cave.

2103
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:05,291
- It's at a random place. - Isn't it a dragon?

2104
01:18:05,591 --> 01:18:06,791
Dragon...

2105
01:18:08,461 --> 01:18:10,961
(It looks like a normal house on the outside.)

2106
01:18:11,931 --> 01:18:13,359
- It says Dragon Dream over there. - Dragon Dream.

2107
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:15,330
- That's true. It's Dragon Dream. - Dragon Dream.

2108
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:18,730
Gosh. But the sign like this is...

2109
01:18:19,030 --> 01:18:20,569
- It's a bit fishy, isn't it? - Right?

2110
01:18:20,570 --> 01:18:21,699
- Yes. - I saw these ones a lot...

2111
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:22,840
in the past seasons.

2112
01:18:22,841 --> 01:18:23,841
- Really? - It's hard.

2113
01:18:24,910 --> 01:18:27,439
- And it's so new. - And this one spot...

2114
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:30,350
- is pinched on purpose. - It's dented on purpose.

2115
01:18:30,351 --> 01:18:31,380
(On the new, shiny signage, )

2116
01:18:31,381 --> 01:18:33,851
It doesn't have any scratches except for that dent.

2117
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:35,820
It looks real.

2118
01:18:36,620 --> 01:18:38,119
- I see. - What is it?

2119
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:39,697
(Did Clever Sun Bin find something again?)

2120
01:18:39,721 --> 01:18:40,791
It's so easy to take off.

2121
01:18:41,061 --> 01:18:42,819
- You can take it. - I'm just lifting it slightly.

2122
01:18:42,820 --> 01:18:44,090
- This is... - I can lift it off with my finger.

2123
01:18:44,091 --> 01:18:45,630
It doesn't make sense, does it?

2124
01:18:45,631 --> 01:18:48,700
Should we go inside? Why is it called Dragon Dream?

2125
01:18:49,330 --> 01:18:50,729
I don't know what's going on, though.

2126
01:18:50,730 --> 01:18:53,500
Will a whole new world unfold before us inside?

2127
01:18:53,501 --> 01:18:54,540
Is there anyone inside?

2128
01:18:54,541 --> 01:18:56,077
(They go into the third place while still feeling confused.)

2129
01:18:56,101 --> 01:18:57,981
Will a whole new world unfold before us inside?

2130
01:18:58,641 --> 01:18:59,671
- Why? - Why?

2131
01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:02,579
- Gosh. It's a real cave. - Is it a real cave?

2132
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:03,711
There's a real cave.

2133
01:19:03,811 --> 01:19:05,051
(There's a real cave.)

2134
01:19:06,381 --> 01:19:08,320
- Come on. - Look.

2135
01:19:08,580 --> 01:19:10,391
Gosh. You're right.

2136
01:19:10,551 --> 01:19:11,850
- Over there. - But it's a building.

2137
01:19:11,851 --> 01:19:13,960
- I don't understand. - Stop judging by the cover. Hurry.

2138
01:19:13,961 --> 01:19:15,020
Okay.

2139
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:17,360
Gosh. What is this?

2140
01:19:17,361 --> 01:19:18,431
(What's inside?)

2141
01:19:19,091 --> 01:19:20,461
It's a real cave.

2142
01:19:23,131 --> 01:19:26,131
(It's dark and wet inside.)

2143
01:19:27,801 --> 01:19:30,171
(What is this mysterious place...)

2144
01:19:30,610 --> 01:19:32,541
(with a mysterious vibe?)

2145
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:36,141
(Hidden deep inside it...)

2146
01:19:38,381 --> 01:19:41,450
(is a secret hideout you can't even imagine.)

2147
01:19:47,921 --> 01:19:49,690
(A cave restaurant)

2148
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:52,630
(When you look around, )

2149
01:19:52,631 --> 01:19:55,931
(there are natural rocks everywhere.)

2150
01:20:00,370 --> 01:20:02,601
(It's so deep that you won't get a signal.)

2151
01:20:03,570 --> 01:20:05,140
(In the strange cave, )

2152
01:20:05,141 --> 01:20:08,110
(a mysterious restaurant is located.)

2153
01:20:09,211 --> 01:20:11,711
(What grabs one's eye...)

2154
01:20:12,751 --> 01:20:14,311
(is the symbol of the cave restaurant.)

2155
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:18,690
(The dragon statue)

2156
01:20:19,551 --> 01:20:22,791
(Does a restaurant in a cave really exist?)

2157
01:20:23,461 --> 01:20:24,830
It's a cave.

2158
01:20:25,190 --> 01:20:26,291
Is this a real cave?

2159
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:30,061
- It's a real cave. - It's dripping with water.

2160
01:20:31,270 --> 01:20:33,431
- It's a cave. - Water does drip from up there.

2161
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:36,041
- You're right. - Your hair is wet with water.

2162
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:37,810
We've come around this, and it's a real cave.

2163
01:20:37,811 --> 01:20:40,011
That's why it had the dragon.

2164
01:20:40,610 --> 01:20:42,381
- Why? - There's a dragon here.

2165
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:44,327
- There's a dragon here. - There's more.

2166
01:20:44,351 --> 01:20:47,279
That's why it's called Dragon Dream.

2167
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:48,681
(Dragon, the spirit of the cave)

2168
01:20:49,051 --> 01:20:50,989
- There's a dragon. What? - There are more of them.

2169
01:20:50,990 --> 01:20:52,051
- There are more. - What?

2170
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:54,690
Hey. It's crazy.

2171
01:20:54,891 --> 01:20:55,891
- Hey. - Are there more?

2172
01:20:55,892 --> 01:20:57,990
- Is it not over? - It's not over.

2173
01:20:58,660 --> 01:20:59,660
Hey, everyone.

2174
01:20:59,791 --> 01:21:02,659
- That one's a bit scary, though. - What? What is it?

2175
01:21:02,660 --> 01:21:03,699
Hey.

2176
01:21:03,700 --> 01:21:04,830
(What's inside the cave?)

2177
01:21:06,101 --> 01:21:07,700
Hello!

2178
01:21:08,641 --> 01:21:12,070
(After passing the dragon statue, )

2179
01:21:12,841 --> 01:21:15,841
(it's hidden secretively inside.)

2180
01:21:17,110 --> 01:21:21,120
(It's hard to tell how deep the cave is.)

2181
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:27,490
(What is this cave filled with endless darkness?)

2182
01:21:28,091 --> 01:21:29,160
This is really...

2183
01:21:30,461 --> 01:21:32,931
- The water really drips here. - This is crazy.

2184
01:21:33,030 --> 01:21:35,061
Water drips here.

2185
01:21:35,730 --> 01:21:38,601
- What is this place? - It's real water.

2186
01:21:39,030 --> 01:21:40,471
It's a real cave.

2187
01:21:40,870 --> 01:21:42,471
It smells like one too.

2188
01:21:43,870 --> 01:21:46,269
How does this work? It was a restaurant from the outside.

2189
01:21:46,270 --> 01:21:47,841
There's a real cave in here.

2190
01:21:47,940 --> 01:21:49,579
- Is there another cave? - Really?

2191
01:21:49,580 --> 01:21:50,610
(Looking)

2192
01:21:51,580 --> 01:21:53,051
Wait. It's a real cave.

2193
01:21:55,681 --> 01:21:57,551
How far can we go?

2194
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:00,790
- It's a real rock. - What's going on?

2195
01:22:00,791 --> 01:22:02,221
This is a real rock too.

2196
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:04,189
- It's crazy. - It's crazy.

2197
01:22:04,190 --> 01:22:05,230
(Mimi checks it too.)

2198
01:22:05,591 --> 01:22:07,360
- It's a real cave. - It's real.

2199
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:09,461
(Interesting)

2200
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:12,000
- It's amazing. - You can't fabricate this.

2201
01:22:12,001 --> 01:22:14,069
You're right. They can't fabricate this.

2202
01:22:14,070 --> 01:22:15,171
It's amazing.

2203
01:22:17,370 --> 01:22:20,069
- It's crazy. - This is a real place.

2204
01:22:20,070 --> 01:22:21,310
- Gosh. It's cold. - It's strange.

2205
01:22:21,311 --> 01:22:22,410
It's spooky.

2206
01:22:22,610 --> 01:22:24,850
That's why they put a dragon statue.

2207
01:22:24,851 --> 01:22:25,979
(The dragon statue looks interesting too.)

2208
01:22:25,980 --> 01:22:28,650
It feels sticky because of the rocks.

2209
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:32,250
I think they make a wish by putting something on here.

2210
01:22:32,251 --> 01:22:33,291
I think so too.

2211
01:22:34,961 --> 01:22:36,890
You put a coin on it.

2212
01:22:36,891 --> 01:22:38,790
(When you make a wish after putting a coin on it, )

2213
01:22:38,791 --> 01:22:40,061
And you make a wish.

2214
01:22:40,091 --> 01:22:41,300
(the dragon will make it come true.)

2215
01:22:41,301 --> 01:22:43,561
What a peculiar place.

2216
01:22:43,660 --> 01:22:45,301
I didn't expect it at all.

2217
01:22:45,601 --> 01:22:47,641
When I looked at it from the outside,

2218
01:22:48,301 --> 01:22:51,041
I thought, "This isn't a cave."

2219
01:22:51,570 --> 01:22:53,511
This can't be a fake.

2220
01:22:53,910 --> 01:22:55,609
(Shaking his head)

2221
01:22:55,610 --> 01:22:56,740
Gosh. But this place is...

2222
01:22:56,841 --> 01:22:59,380
He disagrees. He's shaking his head quietly.

2223
01:22:59,381 --> 01:23:00,381
It's annoying.

2224
01:23:00,382 --> 01:23:02,027
- You think it's fake? - I think it's fake.

2225
01:23:02,051 --> 01:23:03,120
How can it be fake?

2226
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:05,650
I think this place and the real restaurant...

2227
01:23:05,851 --> 01:23:08,561
are two separate places.

2228
01:23:08,860 --> 01:23:11,829
- You mean it's not a place to eat. - It's not a restaurant.

2229
01:23:11,830 --> 01:23:12,860
That's right.

2230
01:23:13,490 --> 01:23:16,399
If they serve spicy fish stew, they need a vent...

2231
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:18,770
- to let the smoke out. - You're making sense.

2232
01:23:20,230 --> 01:23:22,540
(They don't see a ventilation system.)

2233
01:23:22,541 --> 01:23:24,510
It doesn't make sense at all.

2234
01:23:24,511 --> 01:23:27,110
I think we should ask the owner first.

2235
01:23:27,711 --> 01:23:28,880
About the menu. Right?

2236
01:23:28,881 --> 01:23:30,779
- Wait. Hello, ma'am. - Hello.

2237
01:23:30,780 --> 01:23:32,649
- Hello. - Hello.

2238
01:23:32,650 --> 01:23:34,556
We get all suspicious, but once we see the owner, we go,

2239
01:23:34,580 --> 01:23:36,150
- "Hello, ma'am." - "Hello."

2240
01:23:37,051 --> 01:23:39,391
How long has this place been around?

2241
01:23:39,690 --> 01:23:41,461
It's been about 50 years.

2242
01:23:41,660 --> 01:23:43,261
- About 50 years? - Yes.

2243
01:23:43,761 --> 01:23:45,291
(It's fake.)

2244
01:23:45,791 --> 01:23:48,430
It has been passed down from my grandfather.

2245
01:23:48,431 --> 01:23:50,100
It's been eight years since I started running it.

2246
01:23:50,101 --> 01:23:51,569
(8 years?)

2247
01:23:51,570 --> 01:23:52,971
What was this place...

2248
01:23:53,471 --> 01:23:55,769
originally that you're running a restaurant?

2249
01:23:55,770 --> 01:23:58,069
Originally,

2250
01:23:58,070 --> 01:23:59,569
the cave was dug about this much.

2251
01:23:59,570 --> 01:24:01,380
But 50 years ago,

2252
01:24:01,381 --> 01:24:03,979
my grandfather started digging it further out of curiosity.

2253
01:24:03,980 --> 01:24:05,586
(Her grandfather dug it himself 50 years ago out of curiosity.)

2254
01:24:05,610 --> 01:24:06,681
This is... Gosh.

2255
01:24:07,381 --> 01:24:09,449
It's about 83m deep.

2256
01:24:09,450 --> 01:24:11,519
- Right. It's quite deep. - Yes. You can go further in.

2257
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:14,119
It's cool during summer.

2258
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:15,460
Yes. It's warm in the winter.

2259
01:24:15,461 --> 01:24:17,791
It's constantly 17°C.

2260
01:24:17,990 --> 01:24:19,290
(I see.)

2261
01:24:19,291 --> 01:24:21,900
- It's warmer than expected. - Yes. It's hot.

2262
01:24:22,761 --> 01:24:25,200
When is it most crowded with customers?

2263
01:24:25,301 --> 01:24:27,800
- On the weekends. - The weekends...

2264
01:24:27,801 --> 01:24:30,170
- The weather. Which season? - Which season?

2265
01:24:30,171 --> 01:24:32,040
I meant which season. Sorry.

2266
01:24:32,041 --> 01:24:33,569
- How did you get it? - Well.

2267
01:24:33,570 --> 01:24:36,881
Of the season, most people come in the summer, the peak season.

2268
01:24:37,141 --> 01:24:40,110
They need to wait after getting a number ticket.

2269
01:24:40,381 --> 01:24:42,480
It'd be really cool during summer.

2270
01:24:43,580 --> 01:24:45,851
What kind of food do you serve here?

2271
01:24:45,950 --> 01:24:48,819
Our signature is the steamed monkfish and seafood.

2272
01:24:48,820 --> 01:24:51,430
- We'll get one of those. - The steamed monkfish and seafood.

2273
01:24:51,431 --> 01:24:52,490
Okay.

2274
01:24:52,690 --> 01:24:55,360
(How will the steamed monkfish and seafood taste in the cave?)

2275
01:24:56,501 --> 01:24:57,900
I think this is a real place.

2276
01:24:58,001 --> 01:25:00,670
But for her grandfather to dig the cave 50 years ago...

2277
01:25:00,671 --> 01:25:03,569
It's hard for an individual to dig a cave.

2278
01:25:03,570 --> 01:25:05,110
It can collapse.

2279
01:25:05,471 --> 01:25:08,880
Depending on the type of rocks, it can be really dangerous.

2280
01:25:08,881 --> 01:25:10,109
Could he do it because he was dexterous?

2281
01:25:10,110 --> 01:25:12,430
- She said he was dexterous. - No. It still won't be easy.

2282
01:25:12,980 --> 01:25:15,850
Anyway, you don't think it's a place for a restaurant.

2283
01:25:15,851 --> 01:25:17,221
- No. - Me neither.

2284
01:25:17,351 --> 01:25:20,290
If this place isn't for a restaurant, what would it be for?

2285
01:25:20,291 --> 01:25:21,859
Gosh. The owner is here.

2286
01:25:21,860 --> 01:25:22,891
(Sighing)

2287
01:25:22,990 --> 01:25:24,860
(Turning off the guessing mode)

2288
01:25:25,190 --> 01:25:26,961
- This is... - There are fried eggs.

2289
01:25:29,230 --> 01:25:32,269
- What are the fried eggs for? - They are a side dish.

2290
01:25:32,270 --> 01:25:33,300
(Fried eggs are a side dish.)

2291
01:25:33,301 --> 01:25:34,301
It's a side dish.

2292
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:37,760
Do you know why he asked her that?

2293
01:25:37,971 --> 01:25:38,971
It's because he likes fried eggs.

2294
01:25:38,972 --> 01:25:40,909
(He's a fan of fried eggs.)

2295
01:25:40,910 --> 01:25:42,239
Are you a guide regarding me or something?

2296
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:43,787
(With a 30-year friendship, they can read minds.)

2297
01:25:43,811 --> 01:25:45,256
Each has an interpreter of their own.

2298
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:47,881
But they serve fried eggs as a side dish?

2299
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:49,680
As a side of the steamed fish?

2300
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:52,091
Doesn't it feel like it's a real one?

2301
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:54,000
Doesn't it feel like it's a real one?

2302
01:25:54,591 --> 01:25:55,720
Why? Because they serve fried eggs?

2303
01:25:55,721 --> 01:25:58,159
- Because of the fried eggs. - Because they serve what he likes.

2304
01:25:58,160 --> 01:26:01,529
This is a distinct aspect of the restaurant.

2305
01:26:01,530 --> 01:26:03,830
- You're so biased. - No.

2306
01:26:04,900 --> 01:26:06,699
You're a lot more biased than I thought.

2307
01:26:06,700 --> 01:26:07,939
You've given away everything about you now.

2308
01:26:07,940 --> 01:26:09,199
It's a feature of this place.

2309
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:10,470
- A feature. - This place is real.

2310
01:26:10,471 --> 01:26:11,970
This place is real?

2311
01:26:11,971 --> 01:26:13,140
This place is real.

2312
01:26:13,141 --> 01:26:14,340
Just by fried egg alone.

2313
01:26:14,341 --> 01:26:16,079
- He said the fried egg is real. - The fried egg solved everything.

2314
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:19,909
(The side dish was too much of his preference to call it fake?)

2315
01:26:19,910 --> 01:26:23,421
There was grilled shrimp on the menu as well.

2316
01:26:23,681 --> 01:26:24,690
Right.

2317
01:26:25,891 --> 01:26:27,290
(Side menu, grilled shrimp)

2318
01:26:27,291 --> 01:26:29,260
(The grilled shrimp is in between the monkfish dishes.)

2319
01:26:29,261 --> 01:26:31,260
Imagine grilling things here.

2320
01:26:31,261 --> 01:26:32,261
There's no ventilation at all.

2321
01:26:32,262 --> 01:26:34,199
- It will feel even more humid. - Right.

2322
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:35,329
That makes sense.

2323
01:26:35,330 --> 01:26:38,131
However, for that...

2324
01:26:39,171 --> 01:26:40,269
(However?)

2325
01:26:40,270 --> 01:26:41,369
But...

2326
01:26:41,370 --> 01:26:43,300
- He'll be in a period drama soon. - Yes, Your Majesty.

2327
01:26:43,301 --> 01:26:44,310
Are you in a period drama?

2328
01:26:44,311 --> 01:26:45,569
(Laughing)

2329
01:26:45,570 --> 01:26:47,511
- Sir. - He's practicing it in real life.

2330
01:26:47,740 --> 01:26:49,239
- I've never seen anyone speak... - "However."

2331
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:51,380
- in old language like that. - I just...

2332
01:26:51,381 --> 01:26:52,880
- I just think that. - "Just?"

2333
01:26:52,881 --> 01:26:54,820
- I think that's possible too. - "Just."

2334
01:26:55,150 --> 01:26:56,150
- But... - I just think that.

2335
01:26:56,151 --> 01:26:57,851
But why are you holding onto this?

2336
01:26:58,891 --> 01:27:00,171
There was no place to keep this.

2337
01:27:00,820 --> 01:27:02,090
Let's put it back here.

2338
01:27:02,091 --> 01:27:03,989
- I see. - It must've bothered him.

2339
01:27:03,990 --> 01:27:06,160
You seem perplexed, sir.

2340
01:27:07,391 --> 01:27:08,699
- "However." - "However."

2341
01:27:08,700 --> 01:27:09,700
(His use of old language lingers.)

2342
01:27:09,701 --> 01:27:11,431
But the smells that we felt...

2343
01:27:11,770 --> 01:27:13,369
when we entered...

2344
01:27:13,370 --> 01:27:14,500
matched with the dishes on the menu.

2345
01:27:14,501 --> 01:27:16,069
- Right. - Right.

2346
01:27:16,070 --> 01:27:17,399
- It smelled like steamed dishes. - The mung bean sprouts.

2347
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:19,170
- It smelled like steamed dishes. - Right.

2348
01:27:19,171 --> 01:27:20,540
- This is so hard. - The mung bean sprouts.

2349
01:27:20,541 --> 01:27:22,511
- However, the steamed dishes... - "However."

2350
01:27:23,141 --> 01:27:25,449
could have been prepared in advance...

2351
01:27:25,450 --> 01:27:26,880
- "However." - and that was where it was from.

2352
01:27:26,881 --> 01:27:29,380
- "However." - That could be a possibility too.

2353
01:27:29,381 --> 01:27:31,989
Why does it feel so off though?

2354
01:27:31,990 --> 01:27:34,490
- It feels awkward. - Right. It feels awkward.

2355
01:27:34,690 --> 01:27:35,690
It's here.

2356
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:38,690
It's so big.

2357
01:27:39,190 --> 01:27:41,400
Everything looks great here.

2358
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:44,700
(Amazed)

2359
01:27:45,471 --> 01:27:47,330
(Busan is known for its sea.)

2360
01:27:47,570 --> 01:27:49,739
From Jagalchi Market,

2361
01:27:49,740 --> 01:27:52,939
I got the monkfish, octopus, shrimp, crab,

2362
01:27:52,940 --> 01:27:56,279
cod cheek, cod roe, and bean sprouts.

2363
01:27:56,280 --> 01:27:57,987
(A generous amount of seafood on the bean sprouts)

2364
01:27:58,011 --> 01:28:01,720
I stir-fry them in the sauce that has been boiled...

2365
01:28:01,721 --> 01:28:05,421
and a deep flavor comes out from that.

2366
01:28:06,921 --> 01:28:11,290
The monkfish, seafood, and bean sprouts are boiled,

2367
01:28:11,291 --> 01:28:15,961
and they are cooked until they are fully cooked.

2368
01:28:16,761 --> 01:28:18,300
(The spicy sauce...)

2369
01:28:18,301 --> 01:28:21,101
(becomes one with the monkfish and seafood.)

2370
01:28:22,301 --> 01:28:24,541
(It then gets piled up like a mountain.)

2371
01:28:26,341 --> 01:28:30,440
(The flavors of the sea on one plate)

2372
01:28:31,450 --> 01:28:32,949
(Plump seafood...)

2373
01:28:32,950 --> 01:28:37,020
(with its white flesh)

2374
01:28:39,091 --> 01:28:42,620
(Cave limited edition, steamed monkfish and seafood)

2375
01:28:42,990 --> 01:28:46,291
Sixth Sense, is this place real?

2376
01:28:48,061 --> 01:28:49,630
But if it's served like this,

2377
01:28:49,631 --> 01:28:51,269
- it's not constantly cooked. - Having it served like this...

2378
01:28:51,270 --> 01:28:52,470
- would be fine. - It would be fine.

2379
01:28:52,471 --> 01:28:55,239
- So this actually works. - Right. It works.

2380
01:28:55,240 --> 01:28:56,240
This actually works.

2381
01:28:56,241 --> 01:28:57,810
This is hard.

2382
01:28:57,811 --> 01:29:00,540
Help yourselves with your favorite parts.

2383
01:29:00,541 --> 01:29:01,716
(They each get a plate of it.)

2384
01:29:01,740 --> 01:29:03,341
This isn't easy.

2385
01:29:03,811 --> 01:29:06,180
(Jae Seok takes a bite.)

2386
01:29:06,181 --> 01:29:07,449
- The head? - This is for me?

2387
01:29:07,450 --> 01:29:08,450
Yes.

2388
01:29:08,451 --> 01:29:09,721
(Satisfied)

2389
01:29:09,950 --> 01:29:11,391
(The checks the smell.)

2390
01:29:12,351 --> 01:29:13,650
It smells savory.

2391
01:29:14,251 --> 01:29:17,490
(The scent of the seafood and savory scent of sesame oil)

2392
01:29:17,990 --> 01:29:19,960
- It's nice. - Thank you.

2393
01:29:19,961 --> 01:29:22,199
(With the sound of its crunchiness, )

2394
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:23,431
(she's satisfied.)

2395
01:29:24,160 --> 01:29:25,600
The sauce tastes great.

2396
01:29:25,601 --> 01:29:26,869
- Does the sauce taste good? - Yes.

2397
01:29:26,870 --> 01:29:28,040
- Not too big. - Really?

2398
01:29:28,041 --> 01:29:29,439
It's slightly spicy but delicious.

2399
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:31,540
(The steamed monkfish and seafood is slightly spicy with the sauce.)

2400
01:29:31,541 --> 01:29:33,781
(Tae Oh who thinks this place is fake takes a bite too.)

2401
01:29:35,511 --> 01:29:36,511
How is it?

2402
01:29:37,141 --> 01:29:38,279
It's good.

2403
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:40,881
You evaluate your food just like in "Culinary Class Wars."

2404
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:43,950
Does this chef survive?

2405
01:29:44,181 --> 01:29:45,620
"It's good."

2406
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:49,460
(The steamed monkfish was cooked evenly.)

2407
01:29:49,461 --> 01:29:50,520
I carefully say...

2408
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:53,230
that this place might be real.

2409
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:56,159
- Because of the fried egg? - The fried egg?

2410
01:29:56,160 --> 01:29:57,199
All because of the fried egg.

2411
01:29:57,200 --> 01:29:59,270
This is how important the first impression is.

2412
01:29:59,501 --> 01:30:02,769
But other than being a restaurant,

2413
01:30:02,770 --> 01:30:04,841
could this place be something else?

2414
01:30:05,541 --> 01:30:07,681
Could this place be a museum?

2415
01:30:08,011 --> 01:30:10,340
But it doesn't seem right for this place to be a museum.

2416
01:30:10,341 --> 01:30:11,909
Everything will become rusty with this humidity.

2417
01:30:11,910 --> 01:30:13,710
- Whether it be paintings and such. - Right.

2418
01:30:13,711 --> 01:30:16,920
I think this place was actually a botanical garden.

2419
01:30:16,921 --> 01:30:18,319
- A botanical garden? - Yes.

2420
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:19,649
But plants need sunlight.

2421
01:30:19,650 --> 01:30:20,650
You're right.

2422
01:30:20,921 --> 01:30:22,359
(Blunt)

2423
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:24,659
- That was good reasoning. - In a cave?

2424
01:30:24,660 --> 01:30:26,960
- I didn't think that far. - Plants in a cave?

2425
01:30:26,961 --> 01:30:29,729
But listen. We came down through the streets.

2426
01:30:29,730 --> 01:30:32,200
If a restaurant is to be found,

2427
01:30:32,530 --> 01:30:34,399
it should catch people's attention from outside.

2428
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:36,069
But when we were outside,

2429
01:30:36,070 --> 01:30:37,540
- You're right. - I wasn't sure what this place was.

2430
01:30:37,541 --> 01:30:40,069
- That was what I felt. - It just felt like someone's house.

2431
01:30:40,070 --> 01:30:42,180
Right. If it's to catch someone's attention,

2432
01:30:42,181 --> 01:30:44,310
it should be like the Turtle Ship we saw earlier.

2433
01:30:44,311 --> 01:30:46,750
There should be something that catches your attention...

2434
01:30:46,751 --> 01:30:48,980
- for people to get attracted. - Right.

2435
01:30:49,820 --> 01:30:51,619
But you said the Turtle Ship looked fake...

2436
01:30:51,620 --> 01:30:52,791
with the steam.

2437
01:30:53,251 --> 01:30:54,819
(Did I say that?)

2438
01:30:54,820 --> 01:30:56,519
But by the looks of this place...

2439
01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:57,520
"By the looks of this place?"

2440
01:30:57,521 --> 01:30:59,659
- "By the looks of this place." - Compared to that place,

2441
01:30:59,660 --> 01:31:02,300
- this place feels off. - It doesn't feel special enough.

2442
01:31:02,301 --> 01:31:03,560
The seafood ramyeon is here.

2443
01:31:03,561 --> 01:31:05,500
- The ramyeon is here. - The ramyeon.

2444
01:31:05,501 --> 01:31:07,001
We can tell by the ramyeon.

2445
01:31:07,530 --> 01:31:08,869
(Around 15 minutes ago)

2446
01:31:08,870 --> 01:31:10,040
(You can tell if this place is a restaurant...)

2447
01:31:10,041 --> 01:31:11,641
(by looking at how the ramyeon looks.)

2448
01:31:12,141 --> 01:31:13,541
(Really?)

2449
01:31:13,940 --> 01:31:17,851
(The seafood ramyeon isn't easy to make.)

2450
01:31:18,150 --> 01:31:21,520
(How will the seafood ramyeon in the cave be?)

2451
01:31:22,181 --> 01:31:23,220
The ramyeon was cooked...

2452
01:31:23,221 --> 01:31:25,820
- at around the right time. - Gosh.

2453
01:31:27,020 --> 01:31:30,290
(With the seafood ramyeon, )

2454
01:31:30,291 --> 01:31:34,899
(will they be able to find something new?)

2455
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:37,030
- Enjoy your meal. - This one looks normal.

2456
01:31:37,330 --> 01:31:38,800
(Looking intently)

2457
01:31:38,801 --> 01:31:40,869
- Owner Yu. No, Jae Seok. - It has shrimp in it.

2458
01:31:40,870 --> 01:31:42,370
"Owner Yu?"

2459
01:31:42,801 --> 01:31:46,440
(Owner Yu? All of a sudden?)

2460
01:31:46,641 --> 01:31:49,610
Doesn't it feel like she would run a flower shop?

2461
01:31:50,011 --> 01:31:52,511
It feels like the owner is unfamiliar with this place.

2462
01:31:52,811 --> 01:31:56,220
Unlike the the owners of the first two places,

2463
01:31:56,221 --> 01:31:57,250
she's really simple here.

2464
01:31:57,251 --> 01:31:58,611
Are you going to have some or not?

2465
01:32:00,851 --> 01:32:02,619
Are you not listening to him at all?

2466
01:32:02,620 --> 01:32:04,220
- Is that it? - That's not it.

2467
01:32:04,221 --> 01:32:06,091
What's important is the ramyeon right now.

2468
01:32:07,490 --> 01:32:11,631
(He picks it up with his chopsticks.)

2469
01:32:16,471 --> 01:32:18,109
(Smiling)

2470
01:32:18,110 --> 01:32:19,270
Is it that brand?

2471
01:32:19,870 --> 01:32:21,580
Yes. It's definitely that brand.

2472
01:32:21,980 --> 01:32:24,181
(The ramyeon taster takes a bite as well.)

2473
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:29,381
(When everyone is focusing on the noodles, )

2474
01:32:29,851 --> 01:32:32,520
(this man tries the soup first.)

2475
01:32:33,150 --> 01:32:35,990
(He checks the noodles next.)

2476
01:32:36,620 --> 01:32:37,620
(Sighing)

2477
01:32:37,761 --> 01:32:38,859
It's not real?

2478
01:32:38,860 --> 01:32:40,860
It has to have the flavors of seafood in the soup.

2479
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:42,600
The broth tastes a bit weak.

2480
01:32:42,601 --> 01:32:43,660
I agree.

2481
01:32:44,230 --> 01:32:46,590
(It doesn't matter what they say. He chugs down the broth.)

2482
01:32:47,870 --> 01:32:48,870
I love it.

2483
01:32:50,270 --> 01:32:52,010
He's enjoying the ramyeon so much.

2484
01:32:52,011 --> 01:32:53,011
It's amazing.

2485
01:32:53,610 --> 01:32:54,810
It feels so refreshing.

2486
01:32:54,811 --> 01:32:56,710
- It feels so refreshing. - He just loves ramyeon.

2487
01:32:56,711 --> 01:32:58,810
It doesn't matter if it's seafood ramyeon or not.

2488
01:32:58,811 --> 01:33:00,571
(It's not about what kind of ramyeon it is.)

2489
01:33:00,950 --> 01:33:04,019
Were the previous episodes this hard as well?

2490
01:33:04,020 --> 01:33:05,550
- They weren't this hard. - This one is the hardest.

2491
01:33:05,551 --> 01:33:07,596
- This one is the hardest. - This one is the hardest.

2492
01:33:07,620 --> 01:33:10,520
- Right. - We got it right last week.

2493
01:33:10,791 --> 01:33:13,890
- But this week feels different. - But...

2494
01:33:13,891 --> 01:33:15,529
- Sun Bin. - They might've changed things.

2495
01:33:15,530 --> 01:33:17,400
We're the important ones because for them,

2496
01:33:17,660 --> 01:33:19,970
they will be confused from the first and second mechanisms.

2497
01:33:19,971 --> 01:33:21,470
As it's our first time to guess...

2498
01:33:21,471 --> 01:33:23,601
Why are you trying to pretend to be so sharp?

2499
01:33:24,501 --> 01:33:25,870
That was so relieving!

2500
01:33:26,070 --> 01:33:27,841
- That was so relieving! - I'm sorry.

2501
01:33:28,341 --> 01:33:29,939
It might be a new twist...

2502
01:33:29,940 --> 01:33:31,040
- for today. - Right.

2503
01:33:31,041 --> 01:33:32,251
It's really hard today.

2504
01:33:32,450 --> 01:33:33,681
I really want to get it right.

2505
01:33:34,511 --> 01:33:36,079
It feels so fake,

2506
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:37,579
and that is what makes it feel like it might be real.

2507
01:33:37,580 --> 01:33:40,019
This cave can't be fake.

2508
01:33:40,020 --> 01:33:41,119
- Right. - Right?

2509
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:43,159
(1. Unrealistic story that this cave was personally dug out)

2510
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:45,260
(2. A sign that looks off)

2511
01:33:45,261 --> 01:33:47,537
(3. A location that doesn't seem like it's a popular spot)

2512
01:33:47,561 --> 01:33:49,859
- It's hard. - This one is really hard.

2513
01:33:49,860 --> 01:33:51,600
It feels even more confusing the more we talk about it.

2514
01:33:51,601 --> 01:33:53,899
- It's even more confusing. - I have no idea.

2515
01:33:53,900 --> 01:33:56,439
Today, each place...

2516
01:33:56,440 --> 01:33:58,540
- felt fake. - Right.

2517
01:33:58,541 --> 01:34:01,840
I'm confused between...

2518
01:34:01,841 --> 01:34:03,739
that 1st and 3rd place.

2519
01:34:03,740 --> 01:34:05,279
It's the same for me.

2520
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:07,479
The first place...

2521
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:09,279
- feels like a filming site. - Right.

2522
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:11,119
It's the perfect place...

2523
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:12,920
- To set up. - to set up.

2524
01:34:12,921 --> 01:34:16,060
It felt unique, but the steam felt excessive.

2525
01:34:16,061 --> 01:34:18,407
(Perfect spot with special effects that production crews love)

2526
01:34:18,431 --> 01:34:21,431
(The members were shocked by the unfamiliar sight.)

2527
01:34:21,931 --> 01:34:23,261
And the food...

2528
01:34:23,860 --> 01:34:25,970
was made with 12 pieces of meat...

2529
01:34:25,971 --> 01:34:27,470
to express Admiral Yi Sun Sin's...

2530
01:34:27,471 --> 01:34:28,739
His ships.

2531
01:34:28,740 --> 01:34:30,900
Didn't that feel fake?

2532
01:34:31,841 --> 01:34:33,970
(Is the 1st place that is seriously into Yi Sun Sin fake?)

2533
01:34:33,971 --> 01:34:36,480
For the second place, Dae Ho was the model.

2534
01:34:37,480 --> 01:34:39,681
That felt suspicious from the start.

2535
01:34:40,580 --> 01:34:43,479
Out of the five types, the salmon felt off.

2536
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:45,189
- Right. - I thought that...

2537
01:34:45,190 --> 01:34:46,689
it didn't suit with bread.

2538
01:34:46,690 --> 01:34:47,867
(A disappointing combination with bread)

2539
01:34:47,891 --> 01:34:49,961
(But...)

2540
01:34:50,120 --> 01:34:52,859
(Mimi saw the Giant Bread on social media?)

2541
01:34:52,860 --> 01:34:56,330
(Is the Giant Bread be real?)

2542
01:34:56,561 --> 01:34:57,830
And the third place...

2543
01:34:58,830 --> 01:35:01,900
didn't feel like a restaurant.

2544
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:04,570
(It looked like a normal house on the outside.)

2545
01:35:05,211 --> 01:35:09,681
(An unrealistic sight of a cave made into a restaurant)

2546
01:35:10,711 --> 01:35:15,251
(Tae Oh thought that this area was set up as a restaurant.)

2547
01:35:15,751 --> 01:35:19,449
(The cave restaurant with two areas put together?)

2548
01:35:19,450 --> 01:35:21,149
This is the hardest one.

2549
01:35:21,150 --> 01:35:23,019
- It's so hard. Let's do this. - Gosh!

2550
01:35:23,020 --> 01:35:24,790
Sun Bin, to be honest,

2551
01:35:24,791 --> 01:35:26,529
- I'm not certain about any place. - How can you do that?

2552
01:35:26,530 --> 01:35:28,501
There's not a single place I'm certain about.

2553
01:35:29,261 --> 01:35:31,029
- Sun Bin should decide. - You should decide.

2554
01:35:31,030 --> 01:35:32,269
- You should decide. - This is driving me crazy.

2555
01:35:32,270 --> 01:35:33,769
- You should decide. - Gosh.

2556
01:35:33,770 --> 01:35:35,070
Good luck, Anxiety.

2557
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:37,399
- Just give me 30 seconds. - She's feeling pressure.

2558
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:39,040
Hold on. It's the 1st or 3rd place for me.

2559
01:35:39,041 --> 01:35:40,069
- The 1st or 3rd place. - The 1st or 3rd place?

2560
01:35:40,070 --> 01:35:41,511
I think it's the 1st or 3rd place.

2561
01:35:42,381 --> 01:35:43,381
The third place?

2562
01:35:44,181 --> 01:35:45,279
I don't know.

2563
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:46,680
- The first place? - Why are you ignoring her?

2564
01:35:46,681 --> 01:35:48,279
That wasn't it.

2565
01:35:48,280 --> 01:35:49,550
I just have no idea today.

2566
01:35:49,551 --> 01:35:50,880
You should still look at her.

2567
01:35:50,881 --> 01:35:52,250
- Should I just go for it? - Yes.

2568
01:35:52,251 --> 01:35:53,390
- Just go with your decision. - Okay.

2569
01:35:53,391 --> 01:35:55,460
- The 3rd place! The cave! - The 3rd place.

2570
01:35:55,461 --> 01:35:57,037
It won't turn out to be the second place, would it?

2571
01:35:57,061 --> 01:35:58,189
I have no idea.

2572
01:35:58,190 --> 01:36:00,261
I don't want to take a selfie with tears.

2573
01:36:00,591 --> 01:36:02,511
(Legend of Busan, the answer will get revealed.)

2574

(Sixth Sense: City Tour, Win Rate War)

2575
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:11,670
(Episode 1, Jung-gu, Seoul)

2576
01:36:11,671 --> 01:36:13,269
(The members lost.)

2577
01:36:13,270 --> 01:36:14,630
- Why did you change it? - Really?

2578
01:36:15,681 --> 01:36:18,649
(Episode 2, Suwon)

2579
01:36:18,650 --> 01:36:19,750
We got it right.

2580
01:36:19,751 --> 01:36:22,480
- It was thrilling at that moment. - It was thrilling.

2581
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:24,890
We both have a winning rate of 50 percent.

2582
01:36:24,891 --> 01:36:26,227
(Kyoung Pyo was confident during the 2nd episode.)

2583

(Score of 1 to 1)

2584
01:36:27,891 --> 01:36:30,461
Gosh, it was so hard today.

2585
01:36:30,860 --> 01:36:32,130
(Set up even more meticulously)

2586
01:36:32,131 --> 01:36:34,761
I already feel anxious.

2587
01:36:35,501 --> 01:36:36,829
(Third Sixth Sense tour, Busan)

2588
01:36:36,830 --> 01:36:38,631
Busan was great today.

2589
01:36:39,301 --> 01:36:40,630
(The production crew did its best...)

2590
01:36:40,631 --> 01:36:43,171
(to prepare Busan's legendary hot places.)

2591
01:36:43,341 --> 01:36:44,370
What?

2592
01:36:44,770 --> 01:36:45,910
Hold on.

(Yi Sun Sin restaurant)

2594
01:36:48,811 --> 01:36:51,409
We must be wrong.

2595
01:36:51,410 --> 01:36:53,609
- No, Sun Bin. - We must be wrong.

2596
01:36:53,610 --> 01:36:55,519
(Busan's representative bakery...)

2597
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:56,880
(with Busan's representative ingredients)

2598
01:36:56,881 --> 01:37:00,020
I've seen this place. I really have.

2599
01:37:00,150 --> 01:37:01,921
I'm about to lose my breath.

2600
01:37:02,490 --> 01:37:04,119
I've seen it on social media.

2601
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:05,737
(Mimi, dessert addict, has seen the Giant Bread on social media)

2602
01:37:05,761 --> 01:37:07,659
(Steamed monkfish sold in a 80m deep cave?)

2603
01:37:07,660 --> 01:37:09,400
All places felt fake today.

2604
01:37:10,261 --> 01:37:13,500
(Cave restaurant)

2605
01:37:13,501 --> 01:37:14,501
(Which place is fake?)

2606
01:37:14,502 --> 01:37:15,841
I think we got it right.

2607
01:37:16,171 --> 01:37:18,239
- I think we got it right. - I think we got it right.

2608
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:19,439
The clip feels that way.

2609
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:21,940
- That dragon felt really off. - "Dragon."

2610
01:37:23,141 --> 01:37:25,710
(Which one is the fake legendary hot place in Busan?)

2611
01:37:25,711 --> 01:37:26,751
Which place is it?

2612
01:37:26,950 --> 01:37:28,319
Oh, please.

2613
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:29,320
(The cave that Sun Bin and Tae Oh were certain about?)

2614
01:37:29,321 --> 01:37:30,441
- Which place is it? - What?

2615
01:37:30,751 --> 01:37:31,791
Which place is it?

2616
01:37:32,690 --> 01:37:33,950
I feel like I'm about to cry.

2617
01:37:34,221 --> 01:37:35,989
(Hearts...)

2618
01:37:35,990 --> 01:37:37,619
(beating quickly)

2619
01:37:37,620 --> 01:37:39,490
(It will be revealed now.)

2620
01:37:44,030 --> 01:37:45,529
(Number 2, Giant Bread)

2621
01:37:45,530 --> 01:37:48,440
(Fake)

2622
01:37:50,101 --> 01:37:51,540
I mentioned it!

2623
01:37:51,541 --> 01:37:53,869
- I mentioned it! - It was that one.

2624
01:37:53,870 --> 01:37:56,340
(Smart Sun Bin freezes up with shock.)

2625
01:37:56,341 --> 01:37:59,109
- The 2nd place is fake? - The 2nd place is fake.

2626
01:37:59,110 --> 01:38:01,051
What happened to my social media account?

2627
01:38:01,150 --> 01:38:02,250
Your account is ruined.

2628
01:38:02,251 --> 01:38:04,890
They were only thinking about the 1st and 3rd place.

2629
01:38:04,891 --> 01:38:06,851
They didn't even consider about the second place.

2630
01:38:07,320 --> 01:38:09,319
You said the second place felt real.

2631
01:38:09,320 --> 01:38:12,591
You said scents of the chef felt different.

2632
01:38:13,160 --> 01:38:14,359
You said it was real.

2633
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:15,900
I should've trusted my taste buds.

2634
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:19,471
This is amazing, isn't it? It's really confusing.

2635
01:38:22,041 --> 01:38:23,069
(Busan Station)

2636
01:38:23,070 --> 01:38:25,171
(Which bakery represents Busan?)

2637
01:38:26,011 --> 01:38:27,910
- It's a really famous place. - Right.

2638
01:38:28,041 --> 01:38:29,810
Who knew they would've worked with this place?

2639
01:38:29,811 --> 01:38:30,881
This is so upsetting.

2640
01:38:31,610 --> 01:38:34,181
(Busan OPS headquarters, 2024 November)

2641
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:36,819
The busiest season for us throughout the year is...

2642
01:38:36,820 --> 01:38:38,689
from Christmas to Seollal.

2643
01:38:38,690 --> 01:38:40,520
- It was the chef we saw earlier. - Right.

2644
01:38:40,751 --> 01:38:43,960
(The chef who did his best to talk about the Giant Bread?)

2645
01:38:43,961 --> 01:38:46,290
- It doesn't feel like it will work. - No.

2646
01:38:46,291 --> 01:38:48,930
I think it'll be hard for us to make it work.

2647
01:38:48,931 --> 01:38:52,729
We don't make our bread based on trends.

2648
01:38:52,730 --> 01:38:54,100
We always use the traditional method.

2649
01:38:54,101 --> 01:38:56,600
- We'll give you some time to think. - An offer was made.

2650
01:38:56,601 --> 01:38:58,141
We're short on time.

2651
01:38:58,641 --> 01:39:01,780
If that wasn't the case, we could find the time to do that.

2652
01:39:02,311 --> 01:39:04,681
- It had to look special. - Right.

2653
01:39:05,881 --> 01:39:07,710
(The master of 28 years of experience has stepped up.)

2654
01:39:07,711 --> 01:39:09,950
I've created all the bread menus myself.

2655
01:39:11,620 --> 01:39:15,220
I wanted to use this opportunity to use Busan's specialties...

2656
01:39:15,221 --> 01:39:16,820
and decided to take on this challenge.

2657
01:39:17,190 --> 01:39:19,461
Why did you do something like that?

2658
01:39:19,561 --> 01:39:21,801
Your bread was already good enough.

2659
01:39:22,730 --> 01:39:24,560
I'm a terrible liar.

2660
01:39:24,561 --> 01:39:28,940
I have lived in Busan for 40 years.

2661
01:39:29,541 --> 01:39:31,810
OPS is a native company...

2662
01:39:31,811 --> 01:39:34,040
of Busan.

2663
01:39:34,041 --> 01:39:35,380
Through this place,

2664
01:39:35,381 --> 01:39:38,711
I wish to make a positive contribution to Busan.

2665
01:39:39,011 --> 01:39:42,421
I wish each person to be happy and healthy.

2666
01:39:42,580 --> 01:39:44,180
(Adding Busan...)

2667
01:39:44,181 --> 01:39:46,251
(into the bread)

2668
01:39:46,421 --> 01:39:47,891
This is amazing.

2669
01:39:48,020 --> 01:39:49,660
Is he getting the ingredients on his own?

2670
01:39:49,921 --> 01:39:52,761
He came up with his own ideas.

2671
01:39:52,860 --> 01:39:54,489
Kelp, Daejeo tomato,

2672
01:39:54,490 --> 01:39:56,300
bulgogi, and jeotgal.

2673
01:39:56,301 --> 01:39:57,760
(Find the bread that can contain 5 specialties.)

2674
01:39:57,761 --> 01:39:59,301
The 50cm bread is really long.

2675
01:40:00,070 --> 01:40:02,470
(All bread types were tested.)

2676
01:40:02,471 --> 01:40:04,041
He went this far?

2677
01:40:04,971 --> 01:40:07,041
He went through so much.

2678
01:40:07,711 --> 01:40:08,840
Absurd ideas?

2679
01:40:08,841 --> 01:40:11,280
It was my first time coming up this many strange ideas.

2680
01:40:12,181 --> 01:40:14,811
"It was his first time coming up with strange ideas."

2681
01:40:15,080 --> 01:40:16,551
"Strange ideas."

2682
01:40:16,950 --> 01:40:21,319
(Busan's representative specialties were added...)

2683
01:40:21,320 --> 01:40:22,489
(to create the bread.)

2684
01:40:22,490 --> 01:40:24,190
He really went through a lot.

2685
01:40:24,791 --> 01:40:26,229
(The 50cm Giant Bread has come to life!)

2686
01:40:26,230 --> 01:40:27,291
It could actually work.

2687
01:40:28,190 --> 01:40:29,460
(Fool the viewers too! The fake new dish was sold.)

2688
01:40:29,461 --> 01:40:32,631
The ladies we met earlier bought two of them.

2689
01:40:32,870 --> 01:40:34,301
They bought them because of us.

2690
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:35,769
Have you seen this? I've never seen this.

2691
01:40:35,770 --> 01:40:36,800
It must be new.

2692
01:40:36,801 --> 01:40:39,369
Daejeo tomato, salmon, Gijang spring onion,

2693
01:40:39,370 --> 01:40:40,370
Gwangalli bulgogi,

2694
01:40:40,371 --> 01:40:41,609
- and Busan pollack roe. - The elders love it.

2695
01:40:41,610 --> 01:40:43,540
- Gosh. - How is it?

2696
01:40:43,541 --> 01:40:45,110
It's super delicious.

2697
01:40:45,311 --> 01:40:48,211
It's good, isn't it?

2698
01:40:48,520 --> 01:40:51,950
(It was promoted on social media to fool the viewers.)

2699
01:40:52,020 --> 01:40:53,090
- Right. - Really?

2700
01:40:53,091 --> 01:40:55,989
- Gosh. - That's unbelievable.

2701
01:40:55,990 --> 01:40:58,561
That was what I watched!

2702
01:40:59,131 --> 01:41:00,960
- Gosh. - That was it!

2703
01:41:00,961 --> 01:41:03,199
You can't trust anything anymore.

2704
01:41:03,200 --> 01:41:04,560
- What do I do? - Gosh.

2705
01:41:04,561 --> 01:41:06,670
Your phone has been ruined.

2706
01:41:06,671 --> 01:41:08,740
(That wasn't it.)

2707
01:41:09,841 --> 01:41:11,540
(Busan? Giants?)

2708
01:41:11,541 --> 01:41:13,270
- This is crazy. - My gosh.

2709
01:41:14,011 --> 01:41:15,079
Gosh, Dae Ho.

2710
01:41:15,080 --> 01:41:16,080
(One person comes to mind!)

2711
01:41:16,081 --> 01:41:18,511
Hello, you are Lee Dae Ho's manager, right?

2712
01:41:18,811 --> 01:41:21,351
My gosh. He did that just for this?

2713
01:41:21,820 --> 01:41:23,556
Lee Dae Ho is a representative figure of Busan.

2714
01:41:23,580 --> 01:41:25,989
We want to really fool our members.

2715
01:41:25,990 --> 01:41:27,251
"Really fool."

2716
01:41:27,351 --> 01:41:29,489
This is so upsetting.

2717
01:41:29,490 --> 01:41:31,290
That was why I said I was going to send a direct message.

2718
01:41:31,291 --> 01:41:34,631
I said that I was going to send a direct message to Dae Ho.

2719
01:41:35,061 --> 01:41:37,130
(With the portrait rights given, everything was put together.)

2720
01:41:37,131 --> 01:41:39,729
They got his portrait rights to make those posters.

2721
01:41:39,730 --> 01:41:40,869
Gosh.

2722
01:41:40,870 --> 01:41:43,269
(The small sign was made with care as well.)

2723
01:41:43,270 --> 01:41:45,870
(Displayed as a signature product of OPS)

2724
01:41:46,011 --> 01:41:47,710
(Also...)

2725
01:41:47,711 --> 01:41:48,711
You're eating that.

2726
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:54,010
(Do you remember these people?)

2727
01:41:54,011 --> 01:41:56,150
- What? - Hold on.

2728
01:41:56,650 --> 01:41:59,350
(Another plan to fool your senses)

2729
01:41:59,351 --> 01:42:00,420
(A suspicious message sent to someone?)

2730
01:42:00,421 --> 01:42:01,489
(We're filming at 12pm. Can you have some bread at OPS?)

2731
01:42:01,490 --> 01:42:02,520
What is all this?

2732
01:42:05,291 --> 01:42:08,659
(Cousin: It's at OPS. I'll make sure to be there.)

2733
01:42:08,660 --> 01:42:09,660
(Cousin: I'll think about it. Mother-in-law: Okay.)

2734
01:42:09,661 --> 01:42:11,700
They were invited this time?

2735
01:42:12,601 --> 01:42:15,030
- What? - No way.

2736
01:42:16,001 --> 01:42:17,769
- They were invited this time? - What are you doing?

2737
01:42:17,770 --> 01:42:20,710
Are you serious? This is driving me insane.

2738
01:42:20,711 --> 01:42:22,909
Like the butter pork belly place,

2739
01:42:22,910 --> 01:42:24,409
we thought they were actual customers.

2740
01:42:24,410 --> 01:42:25,680
My gosh.

2741
01:42:25,681 --> 01:42:27,851
No way!

2742
01:42:29,020 --> 01:42:32,221
Sixth Sense, this dish is fake.

2743
01:42:32,950 --> 01:42:35,659
You did that just for today?

2744
01:42:35,660 --> 01:42:37,819
They were the relatives of the crew member in Busan.

2745
01:42:37,820 --> 01:42:40,391
- The writer's mother-in-law too. - What?

2746
01:42:41,391 --> 01:42:44,001
- They go this far? - Right.

2747
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:47,170
Now that I think about it,

2748
01:42:47,171 --> 01:42:48,971
they held the bread like this in front of us.

2749
01:42:49,301 --> 01:42:50,340
Right in front of us.

2750
01:42:50,341 --> 01:42:51,569
(Please fall for it.)

2751
01:42:51,570 --> 01:42:52,739
Enjoy your bread.

2752
01:42:52,740 --> 01:42:54,971
This was weird too.

2753
01:42:55,110 --> 01:42:57,210
There were two of them, but they were carrying...

2754
01:42:57,211 --> 01:42:59,649
a Giant Bread and a red bean bun on each tray.

2755
01:42:59,650 --> 01:43:02,150
- Right. - It was exactly the same.

2756
01:43:02,520 --> 01:43:04,251
There were so many types of bread,

2757
01:43:04,580 --> 01:43:05,949
- but they only had those two. - Right.

2758
01:43:05,950 --> 01:43:07,590
They were standing there like twins.

2759
01:43:07,591 --> 01:43:09,960
Now that I think of it, they were holding it like this.

2760
01:43:09,961 --> 01:43:13,461
(Take a look at this.)

2761
01:43:13,761 --> 01:43:17,131
(The truth of the twin set)

2762
01:43:17,230 --> 01:43:19,029
My gosh.

2763
01:43:19,030 --> 01:43:20,530
- Pick one now. - Tae Oh should pick.

2764
01:43:20,700 --> 01:43:21,729
- "However." - It will be hilarious...

2765
01:43:21,730 --> 01:43:22,769
if Tae Oh picks Sun Bin.

2766
01:43:22,770 --> 01:43:24,439
Gosh!

2767
01:43:24,440 --> 01:43:26,841
No! That can't happen!

2768
01:43:27,041 --> 01:43:29,210
Don't you dare pick me.

2769
01:43:29,211 --> 01:43:30,211
(It can be anyone but me.)

2770
01:43:30,212 --> 01:43:31,510
- I won't let it slide. - I wish your sixth sense...

2771
01:43:31,511 --> 01:43:32,851
will make it happen this time.

2772
01:43:33,080 --> 01:43:35,040
I think it's me again. That can't be true, right?

2773
01:43:35,150 --> 01:43:36,251
Okay. Who is it?

2774
01:43:37,351 --> 01:43:38,351
(Surprised)

2775
01:43:39,291 --> 01:43:40,620
(Opening his mouth)

2776
01:43:40,721 --> 01:43:41,750
It's Mimi again?

2777
01:43:41,751 --> 01:43:43,421
It's Mimi again. What's going on?

2778
01:43:43,591 --> 01:43:45,290
(Running away)

2779
01:43:45,291 --> 01:43:47,391
- Congratulations. - How was that possible?

2780
01:43:48,190 --> 01:43:50,706
- Isn't it her 3rd time in a row? - It's me for 3 weeks straight.

2781
01:43:50,730 --> 01:43:52,769
Penalty, coffee truck, and penalty.

2782
01:43:52,770 --> 01:43:53,869
What's going on?

2783
01:43:53,870 --> 01:43:56,500
Are we playing cat and mouse or what?

2784
01:43:56,501 --> 01:43:58,199
(Mimi gets chosen for the penalty. Check Mimi's social media page now!)

2785
01:43:58,200 --> 01:43:59,240
Gosh!

2786
01:44:00,413 --> 01:44:02,183
(The place loved by hot people)

2787
01:44:02,184 --> 01:44:03,854
(The number 1 hot place...)

2788
01:44:04,283 --> 01:44:08,992
(gets visited by the trendiest blunt ones.)

2789
01:44:08,993 --> 01:44:11,224
(Fourth City Tour, Gangnam, Seoul)

2790
01:44:11,753 --> 01:44:13,764
(Kyoung Pyo, your shorts are here.)

2791
01:44:13,923 --> 01:44:15,433
(Shorts)

2792
01:44:15,434 --> 01:44:16,792
(The Sixth Sense members who are trendsetters)

2793
01:44:16,793 --> 01:44:18,292
(Ko Kyoung Pyo, actor)

2794
01:44:18,293 --> 01:44:19,332
Your drinks are here.

2795
01:44:19,333 --> 01:44:20,864
(The server is so good-looking.)

2796
01:44:21,133 --> 01:44:23,403
(Has anyone ordered an iced Americano?)

2797
01:44:23,404 --> 01:44:24,404
(What?)

2798
01:44:24,405 --> 01:44:25,542
(Finding it suspicious)

2799
01:44:25,543 --> 01:44:26,573
(They all freeze.)

2800
01:44:26,574 --> 01:44:27,843
(Who are you?)

2801
01:44:28,104 --> 01:44:29,973
(It's me, Jang Dong Yoon.)

2802
01:44:29,974 --> 01:44:32,013
(Dong Yoon has experienced Sixth Sense before.)

2803
01:44:32,014 --> 01:44:34,542
I'm worried that I would get it right too easily.

2804
01:44:34,543 --> 01:44:37,583
(A deduction genius amongst the blunt ones?)

2805
01:44:38,114 --> 01:44:40,484
(He's sharp even with a single type of dessert.)

2806
01:44:40,824 --> 01:44:41,853
(What?)

2807
01:44:41,854 --> 01:44:43,224
(Does this not come off?)

2808
01:44:43,554 --> 01:44:45,093
(It's a food model.)

2809
01:44:45,253 --> 01:44:46,764
(Blunt)

2810
01:44:46,864 --> 01:44:50,133
(He turns out to be another blunt one.)

2811
01:44:50,333 --> 01:44:55,873
(They visit amazing restaurants...)

2812
01:44:56,503 --> 01:44:59,074
(and hot places in Gangnam!)

2813
01:44:59,703 --> 01:45:02,413
(But today's theme is extraordinary.)

2814
01:45:03,243 --> 01:45:04,314
- Hello. - Hello.

2815
01:45:05,583 --> 01:45:06,912
(Frozen)

2816
01:45:06,913 --> 01:45:08,242
(What? Hold on.)

2817
01:45:08,243 --> 01:45:09,453
No wonder you looked familiar.

2818
01:45:09,854 --> 01:45:11,383
- Why are you here? - Are you serious?
