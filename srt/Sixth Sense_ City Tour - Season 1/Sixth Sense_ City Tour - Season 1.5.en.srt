00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,260
Oh, so pretty! The snow looks amazing.

5
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:33,936
We don't have to go to New York.

6
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,990
(Laughing)

7
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:36,610
- This part is slippery.
- Okay.

8
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,730
This seems to be a famous place.

9
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,600
There are many big bread factories like this these days.

10
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,500
Oh, my. Look at this.

11
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,299
Oh, my. Look at this.

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,300
(A giant tree greets them.)

13
00:00:46,301 --> 00:00:49,439
- It's still Christmas here.
- Oh, my.

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,940
It looks so pretty with the snow.

15
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,839
- Oh, seriously.
- Oh, my.

16
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,080
- It's so big.
- It's so big.

17

(Singing)

18
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:01,150
- It's the biggest tree I've seen.
- It's so big.

19
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,289
- There's one in there too.
- How pretty.

20
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:04,820
(There's a tree in there too!)

21
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,690
These trees... This cafe must have a lot of money.

22
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,060
Mimi is really interested in that kind of thing.

23
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:13,930
I see a lot of bread in there too.

24
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,769
They're not open yet...

25
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,639
- They opened for us.
- Really?

26
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,240
- Oh, my.
- The staff...

27
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:23,170
must be really mad.

28
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:26,040
- So early in the morning.
- Everyone must be.

29
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,879
I'm sure the owner is providing...

30
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,456
- appropriate compensation.
- Of course, they should.

31
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,720
- "Appropriate compensation." - Of course.

32
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,920
- She's a real CEO.
- You need to be precise these days.

33
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:36,249
(First, here is the map.)

34
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,460
- The map.
- I'm so excited for today.

35
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,819
- What is this?
- We must have a lot of places...

36
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,089
to go to today.

37
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,729
Today's areas are Uijeongbu,

38
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,160
Dobong-gu, and Gangnam-gu.

39
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,569

- Exactly.

(You can even customize food?)

52
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,900
- Oh, my. What is this?
- They use this to make...

53
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,099
No way.

54
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,730

- Are you sure?
- I guess that's today's theme.

What is this? Let's go and see.

70
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:00,269
Today does have a Myers–Briggs feeling to it.

71

- Where... This way.
- We have to go that way.

72

- Kyoung Pyo, wake up.

78

How about you eat something instead of dieting?

79
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:14,849
You lost weight.

80
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,750

81
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,619

- for taking pictures.
- Look at Mimi. She's already...

96
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,459
- I'll take some pictures for you.
- This is so pretty.

(Picture at a nice bakery, Jumping Mimi)

99
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,329
You should stand there too.

100
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:58,499
Yes, you should get one.

101
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,829
- You don't have enough pictures.
- Oh, right. Your outfit...

102
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,006
- suits this place really well.
- Why don't you take pictures?

103
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,169
How did you know?

104
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:04,669
- I don't really take pictures.
- He really doesn't.

105
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:05,740
Okay. Oh, my.

106
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,170
Okay. Oh, my.

107
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,939
It's like camouflage. I can't...

108
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,310
I can't tell where you are.

109
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,380
Seriously. Hey.

110
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,909
There's no point in taking the picture.

111
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,380
- Why did you tell me to?
- Sorry. Try to find Jae Seok.

112
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,249
Where is he?

113
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,420
I really can't see him.

114
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:21,919
- I really can't.
- You're right.

115

(Locust camouflage)

116
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,060
Oh, there are so many.

117
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:26,590
You know this is really good, right?

118
00:04:26,591 --> 00:04:28,489
- Crungjis are so delicious.
- Oh, my.

119
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:29,789
- They really are.
- It's made by pressing...

120
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,459
- pastry dough.
- Insane.

121
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,460
(You can't resist the sweet, tasty pastries.)

122
00:04:32,461 --> 00:04:34,541
It says there are actual chunks of peaches in there.

123
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,250
- This strawberry one is insane.
- This is so...

124
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,539
Let's grab one of these.

125
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,239
- It's walnut. Yes.
- Nice.

126
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,510
- This...
- Hey.

127
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,809
- Just get one.
- But...

128
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:44,810
Aren't you going to eat any of the other ones?

129
00:04:44,811 --> 00:04:46,979
When I was in my 20s,

130
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,249
- I just grabbed everything.
- Of course.

131
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,079
And back then, we didn't have information...

132
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,619
- about blood sugar spikes.
- Right.

133
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,879
Right.

134
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,819
- Right.
- You know what I mean, right?

135
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,419
The more that you know...

136
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,460
This one is the best.

137
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,660
The best.

138
00:05:00,661 --> 00:05:01,960
(The best?)

139
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,160
Why are you hesitating?

140
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:04,799
- Why are you hesitating?
- Get two of each.

141
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,330
- Grab it.
- Grab it.

142
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,629
- Why are you hesitating?
- Grab it.

143
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:09,730
Okay.

144
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,940
(Standing far away)

145
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,309
- This one looks good too.
- That looks delicious.

146
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,509
- Chocolate campagne.
- Campagne.

147
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,609
Oh, that looks delicious.

148
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:18,610
Should we eat this?

149
00:05:18,611 --> 00:05:21,449
Why are you so timid today, Kyoung Pyo?

150
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,609
- Since he's not taking charge, - When we're picking food...

151
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:26,249
- it feels so quiet.
- Oh, this is...

152
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,089
Because he's dieting right now.

153
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,589
- Right.
- Oh, this is...

154
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,319
Oh, I'm in trouble.

155
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,696
(Dieting Kyoung Pyo's lonely fight)

156
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,129
(They'll stop and go to pay for Kyoung Pyo's sake.)

157
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:36,130
Should we pay?

158
00:05:36,131 --> 00:05:37,330
- Oh, of course...
- Yes.

159
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,799
(Opening is wallet)

160
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,800
Why...

161
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,800
- Can I look?
- No, you can't.

162
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,469
Can I just look...

163
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,799
- You can't.
- His wallet is fat.

164
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,139
Why is it so thick, Jae Seok?

165
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,740
What? It's not.

166
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,039
- Really? It looks quite old.
- There's not much. Just 10 dollars.

167
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,340
- Right.
- Oh, my.

168
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,779
- Just ten-dollar bills.
- It's Louis Vuitton.

169
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,750
- Hey, most people know.
- Hey, why did you say the brand...

170
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:00,049
Everyone can tell by the logo.

171
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:02,120
Please understand. Mimi likes designer brands.

172
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,619
- I really do.
- She really does.

173
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,759
I really do.

174
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,789
(Meanwhile)

175
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,689
- This is our second time to meet.
- Right?

176
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,859
- Oh, thank you.
- Of course.

177
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,259
(Who are these two holding mics?)

178
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,159
I'm not sure how we should greet them.

179
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,929
(Today's guests, Hwasa and Haewon)

180
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:19,640
(A well-known performance queen...)

181
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:24,540
(and a food-loving eating queen)

182
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,480
(A reliable all-rounder, Hwasa)

183
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,079
(NMIXX's leader...)

184
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,720
(and a human jukebox)

185
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,650
(After mastering all sorts of memes, )

186
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,549
(this meme genius became a meme herself.)

187
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,650
(Generation MZ leader, Haewon)

188
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,089
- Oh, my. What is this?
- Oh, my.

189
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,689
Is this a hot spring or what?

190
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:42,690
- I can smell water.
- A hot spring.

191
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:43,690
A hot spring.

192
00:06:43,691 --> 00:06:45,929
- It does feel like a hot spring.
- Is this a bathhouse?

193
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,359
- Oh, my.
- This is so nice.

194
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,369
- This is a hot spring or what?
- Look, they're lying down.

195
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:50,470
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my.

196
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,099
- They really are.
- This is so nice.

197
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,180
- If we sit...
- Imagine...

198
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,469
looking at the view...

199
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,109
when it's snowing.

200
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,539
Oh, gosh. How should we greet them?

201
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,980
(Please look at us too.)

202
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,250
(Here they come.)

203
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,350
Hey, who's that there?

204
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,149
You're a fool

205
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:08,150
Haewon.

206
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,049
- Look who's here.
- There's a fool here?

207
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,289
Oh, my!

208
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,920
- Hello!
- Look who's here.

209
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,006
- Oh, my. What is this?
- Oh, my. What is this?

210
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,030
What is this?

211
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,030
- What is this?
- What is this?

212
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,629
- This is new.
- There's a stage here.

213
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:21,630
You're right.

214
00:07:21,631 --> 00:07:23,630
(This is getting fun.)

215
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:27,370
("Please Please Please" by Haewon of NMIXX)

216
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:32,710
What is this?

217
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,850
(Oh, my.)

218
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:37,080
We start in a different way each time.

219
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,420
This is amazing.

220
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,390
Haewon's voice is so nice so early in the morning.

221
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,020
She's so good.

222
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,600
(Oh, gosh.)

223
00:07:53,601 --> 00:07:55,329
Her voice is so strong so early in the morning.

224
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:56,929
It's eight in the morning.

225
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:57,940
Exactly.

226
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:04,140
(Her sweet voice is melting their hearts this morning.)

227
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,540
Voice check.

228
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:07,870
Oh, is it this kind of music?

229
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,050
Is it this kind of mood?

230
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,220
(Moving to the rhythm with forks)

231
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,500
- This song is so nice.
- This song is so nice.

232
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,890
(Finishing off with a proper bow)

233
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,030
(Cheering)

234
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,169
I'll sing the next song.

235
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,429
- What is going on today?
- Yes!

236
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,930
Sixth Sense, scream.

237
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,940
(Yes!)

238
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,240
("Walk On By" by Hwasa)

239
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,680
(Oh, my.)

240
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,389
(Oh, my.)

241
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,390
I love it.

242
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:00,600
(Her voice is so warm that it could melt the snow.)

243
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,480
(Oh, my!)

244
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:19,079
- She's like a pop star.
- I love it.

245
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,549
- Exactly.
- That was so nice.

246
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,619
That was so nice.

247
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,420
- I want to shout, "Encore!" - Thank you.

248
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:25,290
- Come here.
- Okay.

249
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,259
- This is my first time with Haewon.
- Really?

250
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,689
I've seen her on TV, but this is the first time in person.

251
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,029
- Oh, really?
- I see.

252
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,599
I've met you before.

253
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,259
When? Should we sit?

254
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,869
- I said something wrong, didn't I?
- Oh, she made a mistake.

255
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:38,299
- When did you meet her, Haewon?
- There was a show...

256
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,569
where people try to find the person imitating the singer.

257
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:42,139
Oh, right.

258
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,839
- "Hidden Singer." - I was sitting right behind you.

259
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,740
Oh, I see. Right.

260
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:48,950
(Eun I and Haewon appeared on the same show 3 years ago.)

261
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,350
(They even connected by choosing the same person.)

262
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,590
(Hurriedly trying to apologize)

263
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,920
(You understand, right?)

264
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:59,159
(Of course.)

265
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,529
So Haewon saw you, but you didn't see her.

266
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:03,159
She only saw the back of my head.

267
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,729
- Just the crown of your head. Yes.
- Right?

268
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,159
It must also be your first time to meet Hae Won, right?

269
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,169
- Yes, it is.
- We've never met before.

270
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:09,569
Have you met Hwasa?

271
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,199
I'm sure we've passed by and...

272
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,599
- "Passed by." - "Passed by."

273
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,709
- Going to and from shoots?
- Yes, something like that.

274
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:19,509
Hwasa's new song is coming out soon.

275
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,779
- But it was a bit...
- You're right.

276
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,479
It was a bit postponed.

277
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,619
I love Sixth Sense so much,

278
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,249
but I came on the show...

279
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,489
- partially to promote my song.
- Right,

280
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,449
but I heard that the release date for your album was pushed back.

281
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,019
It was pushed back to autumn.

282
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,459
- Oh, no.
- It was pushed back a lot.

283
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,689
- You're promoting it way too early.
- It was pushed back too much.

284
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:38,259
How was it pushed back all the way to autumn?

285
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,800
The song isn't really a summer song.

286
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:43,099
It's not really a summer song,

287
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,139
so I made the ultimate decision.

288
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,999
- "The ultimate decision." - "The ultimate decision."

289
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,809
- It's a new type of promotion.
- Yes.

290
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:50,669
- My song is coming out in autumn.
- It's refreshing.

291
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,139
I mean, it's nice for us.

292
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,409
- We get to see Hwasa.
- Right.

293
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:55,809
You were her boss at one point.

294
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:56,810
- Of course.
- Right.

295
00:10:56,811 --> 00:10:58,619
- She's in PSY's company now.
- Right.

296
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,320
She went to PSY's company and did this.

297
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,550
Oh, that's why he kept doing this.

298
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:07,020
(We get why she didn't recognize it.)

299
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,830
You were doing this, right?

300
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,160
Oh, my.

301
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,560
(Why is his face like that?)

302
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,299
(The owner of the move is rejecting Jae Seok's version.)

303
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,769
Hwasa started laughing after seeing this.

304
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,169
That's the fastest...

305
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:18,576
and least attractive thing ever, right?

306
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,600
It's so fast...

307
00:11:19,601 --> 00:11:21,321
- but unattractive.
- Hwasa goes like this.

308
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,940
She keeps rubbing her belly.

309
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,040
(When did I do that?)

310
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,449
The bread here...

311
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,179
- We ordered some things.
- It was a good choice.

312
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,549
- So we can eat before we start.
- Right.

313
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,950
(Jae Seok takes a bite first.)

314
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,050
This is good.

315
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,066
- This really is good.
- The one with the cream...

316
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,059
- It smells amazing.
- It does.

317
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,136
(Meanwhile, this guy, who said he was dieting...)

318
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,230
I've never had this one before.

319
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:44,729
(Taking a big bite)

320
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:47,099
(Since I'm happy...)

321
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,130
(Taking another bite)

322
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:50,570
We have to eat all day today.

323
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:53,039
(Taking a big bite)

324
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,670
(I'll start dieting tomorrow.)

325
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,840
(I'll have some too!)

326
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,479
(Spilling)

327
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,910
- Oh, this is delicious.
- Oh, no.

328
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:04,779
(Getting her a tissue)

329
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,780
- How sweet.
- Oh, my.

330
00:12:05,781 --> 00:12:07,149
- Oh, your ears became red.
- Oh, the manners.

331
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,720
- Hey.
- Oh, gosh.

332
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:09,990
Oh, gosh.

333
00:12:09,991 --> 00:12:11,419
(What?)

334
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,089
(Look at this guy right here.)

335
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:14,830
- You need to be fast.
- By the way,

336
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,260
what was that "Hey?"

337
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,100
It means, "You're cool."

338
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,000
- Hey.
- Nice.

339
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,229
I can tell that this is a trendy place.

340
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,469
Right.

341
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,669
Doesn't it look like they're playing a video?

342
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,040
- Right.
- Yes.

343
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:31,839
(City Tour's healing music time)

344
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,349
(Stress-relieving music before the day begins)

345
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:37,179
What is today's topic?

346
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,279
Each day is different.

347
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,679
- Anything Tour.
- Anything Tour.

348
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,920
Unlike before,

349
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:44,149
the food could be fake,

350
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,959
or the person could be fake.

351
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,389
- It has become more detailed.
- Right.

352
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,390
- It's really hard to find.
- Right?

353
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,530
And there's a penalty.

354
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,030
There's what?

355
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,030
Should we tell them later? We don't need to tell them now.

356
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,899
Talking about it now will only ruin our moods. Right?

357
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,609
(Yes. Let's forget about it.)

358
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:02,669
If we find the fake,

359
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:03,809
they pick one person...

360
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:04,939
- and send a coffee truck.
- I see.

361
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,379
- If we succeed.
- A coffee truck? Where?

362
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,109
- Wherever you want.
- Wherever that person wants.

363
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:10,949
But I think Hwasa needs it in autumn.

364
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,720
You need to send it in autumn for me.

365
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,220
Can we keep it for later?

366
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,589
Hwasa will get it in autumn.

367
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:18,219
You're right.

368
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,660
- Shall we get going?
- Okay.

369
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,529
Today does have a slight Myers–Briggs feeling to it.

370
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:24,590
We'll have to go and see.

371
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,030
I'm sad about Hwasa.

372
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:29,170
- The song is all finished.
- I see.

373
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,499
But I actually broke a toe.

374
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,139
- Oh, no.
- That's why...

375
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,539
- It's broken?
- Yes, my toe is broken.

376
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,569
- I see.
- There's that issue.

377
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:40,839
- It's a pop ballad.
- That's nice.

378
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,249
It's something new from me.

379
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,726
(She'll make a comeback with a new concept.)

380
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,980
- Hey.
- Hey.

381
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,819
- I'm curious.
- In autumn.

382
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,889
- Please look forward to autumn.
- Oh, Hwasa.

383
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,819
Then should we broadcast this now or in autumn?

384
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,930
Please broadcast it now.

385
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:58,799
When Hwasa makes her comeback,

386
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,229
I'll know, "This year is almost over."

387
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,230
"It's autumn."

388
00:14:02,231 --> 00:14:03,869
- When you start feeling that...
- Oh, you're right.

389
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:04,870
Right.

390
00:14:04,871 --> 00:14:07,369
- Haewon is working hard too.
- Yes.

391
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:08,839
Haewon has an album coming out...

392
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,309
- in 4 days.
- Right, in 4 days.

393
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,379
Right, in 4 days. It's somehow in 4 days.

394
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,580
What is the title of the song?

395
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:15,249
It's called, "Know About Me."

396
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,309
- "Know About Me." - "Know About Me."

397
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,449
Do you know about me?

398
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:19,919
- Is that the message?
- Like, "Do you know me?"

399
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,149
Yes, kind of like that.

400
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,549
- Oh, my.
- I see.

401
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,520
NMIXX's choreographies...

402
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:27,319
- are famous for being tough.
- Are they?

403
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,429
- Yes.
- Really?

404
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:31,230
For our pre-release song, we're doing contemporary dance.

405
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,800
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my.

406
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:38,370
(NMIXX is famous for their powerful dances.)

407
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,940
(For this album, they even tried contemporary dance.)

408
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:45,640
Back in the day, choreographies were polite.

409
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:48,479
If you go 2 to the right, you go 2 to the left.

410
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,379
- You need to be symmetrical.
- But these days...

411
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,509
- That's important.
- Right to left.

412
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:54,419
You go to the right, and when you go to the left, you do something else.

413
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,589
- Exactly.
- You're right.

414
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,619
Yes.

415
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,089
People get bored so quickly.

416
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:59,419
The choreographies are so impolite.

417
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,460
Seriously.

418
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:02,829
Yes, Hwasa. That could've been better.

419
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:04,089
After touching the right side of your belly,

420
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:05,400
you should touch the left.

421
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,800
You should touch the left.

422
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,769
- Hwasa does something else too?
- Yes.

423
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:09,929
- She moves without rest.
- Yes.

424
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:11,716
- Since I kept...
- Her choreographies are busy.

425
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,169
- only using this side, - Exactly.

426
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:15,269
My hips became uneven.

427
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,369
(My hips became uneven.)

428
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:17,370
- My body became balanced.
- Unbalanced hips.

429
00:15:17,371 --> 00:15:19,379
- So after the promotion period, - Your hips...

430
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,179
I worked hard on realigning my hips.

431
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,409
- Yes, that's good.
- I got it corrected.

432
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,809
(Staring)

433
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:27,580
Kyoung Pyo, you're sitting so far to the left.

434
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,849
I need to leave space...

435
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:31,889
- for the camera to see you.
- There are cameras here.

436
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:32,890
- There are cameras here.
- Oh, really?

437
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:34,520
I'm still new to variety shows.

438
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,230
- "Oh, really?" - "Oh, really?"

439
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,359
(Laughing unnaturally)

440
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,160
(Bursting into laughter)

441
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,430
I see!

442
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,269
(Kyoung Pyo is fascinating to our variety show idol as well.)

443
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,340
"Oh, really?"

444
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,269
I think the sun is finally coming up. Look.

445
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:50,040
The snowy scenery is so pretty.

446
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:51,940
Seriously. Oh, my.

447
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:53,479
(Snow-covered Dobong Mountain stretched out before their eyes.)

448
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,950
- How cool.
- It looks so cool with the snow.

449
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,779
(Driving through the snow for the fifth City Tour)

450
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,649
There are mountains all the way over there too.

451
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:00,920
So cool.

452
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:02,420
So cool.

453
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,350
So pretty.

454
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,860
Where are we going to first?

455
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,789
- Where was the first place?
- Let's see.

456
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,930
- I have the map.
- Shall we open it up?

457
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,400
The first place we're going to...

458
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:16,629
- It's "Anything P." - P?

459
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,929
In the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator,

460
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:19,269
- P means we have no plan.
- Right.

461
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,199
- That's me.
- You're a P?

462
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,969
- I'm a P.
- I see.

463
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:25,940
I don't have plans. I never make plans.

464
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:27,840
Eun I...

465
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:29,679
- ESTJ.
- You plan things out.

466
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,649
- ESTJ.
- It's perfect for you.

467
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:33,419
- You are a TJ.
- I'm a TJ.

468
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,480
You're a TJ.

469
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,419
I've always liked Jang Hyuk's singing.

470
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,490
You're a TJ.

471
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,719
(TJ is Jang Hyuk?)

472
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,736
- That must've been why.
- You can't live without plans.

473
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,359
- I'm kind of... Yes.
- Yes.

474
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,559
You can't live without plans.

475
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,729
Do you plan everything even when you're having fun?

476
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,600
- Eun I is kind of...
- Yes, I tend to do so.

477
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,230
Eun I will say, "Okay, today, we will..."

478
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,469
She's kind of like that.

479
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,639
(Eun I, a J, the planning type, plans by the hour.)

480
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,639
(And next to her is a P, the not-planning type, Kim Sook)

481
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,909
When I travel with Sook,

482
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,409
I want to order right away...

483
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:00,610
when we enter a restaurant, but she keeps chatting.

484
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,270
She doesn't look at the menu.

485
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,749
- The time is passing by.
- "That was nice earlier."

486
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,870
She keeps talking like that.

487
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:08,419
- We're different in that way.
- TJ.

488
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,450
TJ.

489
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:10,849
When did Myers-Briggs...

490
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:12,489
- become so popular?
- Seriously.

491
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,259
This is similar to blood sugar spikes.

492
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,659
- Right.
- We didn't have it before.

493
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,929
- Before, it was blood types.
- Before, it was blood types.

494
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:19,699
There was even a movie called, "My Boyfriend Is Type B."

495
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,060
- Right.
- Oh, right.

496
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:23,669
If you think a certain amount every day, it makes you healthy.

497
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:24,829
(Give me one too.)

498
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:25,899
(I only have one for me.)

499
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,339
(Are you the only one with a mouth?)

500
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,409
(Not gentlemanly, cowardly, shameless, unreasonable)

501
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:29,469
(Inhumane)

502
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:32,640
(Back in the day, blood type Bs were considered bad guys.)

503
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,009
That movie made me think all type Bs were annoying.

504
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,110
- Right.
- I'm a type B.

505
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,450
Oh, you're so annoying.

506
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,589
- I'm a type B.
- His facial expression...

507
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,920
- His facial expression is so...
- Yes, I am...

508
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,519
I am that famous type B.

509
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,019
Wasn't the type B guy...

510
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,529
- in that movie Lee Dong Gun?
- It was.

511
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,490
Dong Gun isn't the only type B.

512
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,960
What a surprise.

513
00:17:52,961 --> 00:17:54,359
So funny.

514
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,569
(Sixth Sense: City Tour with "That famous type B guy")

515
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,469
- I think we're almost there.
- Yes, we're almost there.

516
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:00,000
There's nothing here. It's just...

517
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:02,740
- Right. There's nothing here.
- There's an auto repair shop.

518
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,709
What was the title? Anything?

519
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,210
- Anything...
- "Anything P."

520
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,990
- "Anything P?" - What could this be?

521
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,079
There's nothing here.

522
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,180
There really is nothing.

523
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,919
Wait. There's a pork belly place.

524
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,219
- "Black goat..." - "Black goat..."

525
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,560
Black goat is good for revitalizing your body.

526
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,289
There are things like pollack soup and pork belly.

527
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:22,530
Oh, you're right.

528
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,360
Pollack soup sounds nice.

529
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,529
- P? Why is it P?
- P for pig?

530
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:29,769
(Is it pig?)

531
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:30,870
Pig?

532
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,399
- Pig?
- That was clever.

533
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,369
- Oh, my.
- That was impressive.

534
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:38,109
- You're doing good today.
- I'm doing good.

535
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,679
"Pizza?" There's also pizza.

536
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,510
- There's also pizza.
- There's also pizza.

537
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,880
Pizza.

538
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,909
- What is this?
- "Pizza."

539
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:46,149
- A pizza place?
- Pizza?

540
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,319
It must really be pizza.

541
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,490
What is this?

542
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,220
- What is this?
- "Pizza."

543
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,459
- A pizza place?
- Pizza?

544
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,520
It must really be pizza.

545
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,690
What is this?

546
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,889
What is this? This is kind of strange.

547
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:59,229
There's also jjajangmyeon.

548
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,430
They have everything.

549
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,300
What is this?

550
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,929
Is this really the place? Here?

551
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:05,970
What?

552
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,740
Wait. This is...

553
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,739
It says pizza, but then... What is this?

554
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:11,770
(Various delivery food?)

555
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:15,309
(Why are there these food in front of a pizza store?)

556
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:17,809
- The display is a bit...
- It's too...

557
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:18,879
- It's too fake.
- It's too unnatural.

558
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,980
Wait. This is...

559
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,719
It says pizza, but then... What is this?

560
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,689
Does it mean they make pizza with things like this?

561
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:26,420
- No way.
- Come on.

562
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,219
(I'm getting a bad feeling.)

563
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,489
- Shall we go in?
- Okay.

564
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:30,889
I can smell the fakeness.

565
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:31,999
- Seriously.
- This is too fake.

566
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
This is too much.

567
00:19:33,001 --> 00:19:35,299
- The store itself could be fake.
- Right? Yes.

568
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,820
(What is this suspicious pizza store?)

569
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,469
- Hello.
- Hello.

570
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,069
- Hello.
- Hello.

571
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:42,410
- Oh, this is...
- Hello.

572
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,910
- This is a pizza store?
- Yes.

573
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:49,909
(A small, 26m² pizza store on the corner of the alley)

574
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,609
- They have a theme.
- Yes.

575
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:52,679
(The interior is decorated in a space theme.)

576
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,350
I want to be an earthling.

577
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:59,120
(There aren't even any tables to eat the pizza on.)

578
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,429
(Is this a real store?)

579
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,430
Now that I look at it,

580
00:20:03,431 --> 00:20:05,799
- this isn't a dine-in restaurant.
- It doesn't seem to be.

581
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,029
That's right. We mostly do takeout.

582
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,529
- Right?
- Most customers get takeout.

583
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:12,039
Oh, so you put the table here for today's shoot.

584
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,899
- You prepared it for us, right?
- I see.

585
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,169
I saw there were jjajangmyeon and other food outside.

586
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:19,479
People can bring anything to us,

587
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,080
- and we make it into a pizza.
- What?

588
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,980
(All food into pizza?)

589
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:28,950
(A unique pizza just for me?)

590
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:33,190
(Even for pizza, customization is the trend.)

591
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:37,630
(Any pizza toppings you want?)

592
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,600
(They can even make pizza out of ingredients like this?)

593
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,130
For three weeks, I didn't get a single order.

594
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:47,100
I couldn't sell anything at all.

595
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:50,609
So I thought that I should make pizzas...

596
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:53,110
you can't get anywhere else.

597
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:56,379
So since then, I uploaded a video...

598
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,110
every single day.

599
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:00,579
I got so many likes.

600
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,189
"How can I eat this?"

601
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:04,689
"Do you do reservations?" "Do you deliver?"

602
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,960
"I should try selling this."

603
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,089
(Novelty pizza popular on social media)

604
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:10,589
Since then,

605
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:12,859
people started coming from Seoul, Daegu, Busan...

606
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,236
(After that, they became known for their customizable pizzas.)

607
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:17,469
On the weekends, I normally sell...

608
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,839
about 50 pizzas.

609
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,340
Even at the lowest, I'm making about ten times more.

610
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,239
Sixth Sense members.

611
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,309
Is this dish real?

612
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:29,249
(Is this customizable Anything Pizza real?)

613
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:32,780
So I see that they have a normal pizza menu.

614
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,290
- But whatever customer requests...
- Right.

615
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:39,959
If they bring freshly cooked food,

616
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,729
we make it into pizza.

617
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,690
I think this is weird.

618
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:46,630
The customizable pizza...

619
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:49,070
is more expensive than a normal pizza.

620
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:54,040
(Even the normal pizzas are around 20 dollars.)

621
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:56,039
(Custom pizza is 20 dollars...)

622
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,469
(when you have to pay for your own toppings separately?)

623
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:59,209
- That's what it says.
- You even bring your own toppings.

624
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:00,210
Exactly.

625
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:02,009
(There's something suspicious about this place.)

626
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:04,150
Then let's bring one topping each.

627
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:07,579
I guess the staff prepared toppings since we couldn't bring them.

628
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,849
- That's correct.
- I see. No wonder.

629
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:10,889
- These are examples of toppings.
- Normally, customers bring...

630
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:13,089
- some toppings for their own pizza.
- Oh, dishes like these?

631
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:14,160
(Braised kimchi)

632
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,290
(Popular toppings for Anything Pizza have been selected.)

633
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,460
(Which ones will the Sixth Sense members pick?)

634
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,969
- I'll go with jjajangmyeon.
- Really?

635
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:25,329
Really? Are you serious?

636
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:27,339
- Yes, I mean it. I'll try it.
- I think it'll be delicious.

637
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,599
- You can order half-and-half pizza.
- Really?

638
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,909
- Yes, I'm serious.
- You know...

639
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:32,739
Kimchi and pizza work.

640
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,979
There's a dish called kim-pi-tang, you know.

641
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,779
- Right, kim-pi-tang. Exactly.
- What is kim-pi-tang?

642
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,879
- Kimchi-pizza-tangsuyuk.
- It's a dish that exists.

643
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,956
- They're all mixed up like pizza.
- It's very tasty.

644
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,619
- Really?
- Yes, kim-pi-tang is delicious.

645
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,689
- Yes, it's tasty. And it's popular.
- Shall we try braised kimchi, then?

646
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:44,749
- Is kim-pi-tang an actual dish?
- Let's do that.

647
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:45,960
I pick mango.

648
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,520
Oh, my. A fruit as a pizza topping? Hwasa's choice surprises me.

649
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:52,029
(Hwasa will try mango pizza.)

650
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,706
- Yes. I picked mango.
- Mango sounds great.

651
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:56,870
- Aren't chocolate cookies bizarre?
- We can choose one each.

652
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:59,640
Oh, I see chocolate cookies there. I'm surprised.

653
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:00,800
Would this be good?

654
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:04,110
We can't guarantee the taste of any of these toppings.

655
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:07,139
Let's take chocolate cookies too. Let's take it.

656
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,460
- I pick duck.
- That's it, then.

657
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:10,750
- Let's go now.
- Will this really work?

658
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,850
(Every member has ordered their own Anything Pizza.)

659
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:18,549
You talked about the dish that's popular with Generation MZers.

660
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:20,159
Was it called tang-pi-chi?

661
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,619
- It's kim-pi-tang.
- Kim-pi-tang?

662
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,729
Have you heard of kim-pi-tang before?

663
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:24,789
- Not only Generation MZers have it.
- Oh, I see.

664
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,750
Have you tried it before? Do you know what it is?

665
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,710
Oh, no. I feel like I'm of an older generation.

666
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,170
You're of Generation MZ, Kyoung Pyo, just like us.

667
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:34,439
It's tangsuyuk with kimchi and pizza.

668
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,669
- Really?
- All three of them are mixed up.

669
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:38,951
(Kimchi, cheese, and tangsuyuk are all in the same dish.)

670
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,239
(Jae Seok is unhappy, thinking, "You eat them all together?")

671
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,250
Look at his face. Jae Seok, you seem very angry.

672
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:46,849
I just imagined how it'd taste, and I don't think it'd be good...

673
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:47,979
- It's delicious.
- Is it?

674
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,019
Yes, it's good.

675
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,289
- Really?
- They all say it's good.

676
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:51,466
- Yes, it's good, indeed.
- It's tasty.

677
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:53,360
I'm going to try kim-pi-tang sometime.

678
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,230
- He's putting jjajangmyeon on it.
- What? Really?

679
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,490
(He's putting jjajangmyeon on pizza dough.)

680
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,190
He's putting on jjajangmyeon.

681
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:02,529
- My goodness.
- He put jjajangmyeon on the dough.

682
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:03,929
(Cutting the noodles into short pieces)

683
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:07,300
I've never seen anyone use jjajangmyeon as a pizza topping.

684
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:09,169
But I'm not sure if jjajangmyeon goes well with pizza sauce.

685
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:11,170
He already applied pizza sauce.

686
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,440
I'm worried.

687
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:16,141
- I don't think it'll taste good.
- Let's take it into consideration.

688
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:19,049
- Oh, gosh. I think you should...
- I'll eat that one.

689
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:20,250
- eat that one.
- I'll eat it.

690
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,750
He's adding a lot of cheese.

691
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:27,090
(He uses a generous amount of all ingredients.)

692
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,530
(Let me tell you something about Anything Pizza.)

693
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:33,530
(The first kick: Squid ink dough)

694
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,530
We use squid ink dough.

695
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:38,700
I think it's the best of all.

696
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:40,999
We put five basic toppings...

697
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,370
on every custom pizza.

698
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,470
This is the type of pizza...

699
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,539
that you can't have nowhere else in the world.

700
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,509
(With its ravishing appearance and great taste...)

701
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,830
(Actual food reviews of YouTubers: "This is really good.")

702
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,049
(- What a brilliant idea. - It's a reliable food combination.)

703
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:56,410
(It now receives 5-star reviews on a delivery application.)

704
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:59,160
(How does custom pizza taste?)

705
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,980
Have you ever tried adding pizza cheese on top of jjajangmyeon?

706
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,160
Never.

707
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:06,099
- I've added it to jjajang ramyeon.
- Right, people do that.

708
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,100
- Oh, you have?
- Yes.

709
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,770
(Cheese does go well with jjajang ramyeon.)

710
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:11,729
Hold on. Who picked that topping?

711
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:13,270
(Who picked that topping?)

712
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,239
- Chocolate cookies.
- Really?

713
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,770
I'm so curious about that one.

714
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,116
- Right, me too.
- How will it turn out?

715
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,210
I wonder...

716
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,910
whether it tastes as bizarre as it sounds...

717
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:25,550
or it's an unexpectedly good combination.

718
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,280
- I'm really curious.
- Right.

719
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:30,150
Sir, how long have you been running this place?

720
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:31,919
It's been six months.

721
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,120
- It hasn't been long.
- It really is not a long time.

722
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:37,659
We chose tteokbokki and jjajangmyeon.

723
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,300
- Yes.
- Have any customers brought them?

724
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:43,069
Many customers bring tteokbokki.

725
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,950
- Oh, really?
- And these days, jjajangmyeon...

726
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:46,600
- is very popular.
- Oh, I see.

727
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:50,640
Among all the toppings you've received,

728
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:53,510
what surprised you the most?

729
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,440
What was most unusual?

730
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:58,079
The toppings that surprised me were fermented skate...

731
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,280
(Fermented skate pizza?)

732
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,750
What?

733
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:04,419
And fruits, including watermelon...

734
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,919
- and melon.
- Watermelon?

735
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,990
Watermelon sounds a bit...

736
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,689
I once made pizza with stinky tofu as well.

737
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:10,159
I once made pizza with stinky tofu as well.

738
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,229
Oh, my gosh.

739
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:13,759
- What? Isn't it hard to get?
- Exactly.

740
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,229
Unless it's for creating video content...

741
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,300
Exactly. This would be...

742
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:19,700
- interesting content. Right?
- Yes.

743
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,469
But I rather think this place could be fake.

744
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:24,970
- You do?
- Here's why.

745
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,509
Pizza toppings have to harmonize...

746
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,110
- with one another.
- Yes.

747
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,880
But he seems so skillful...

748
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,550
as if he knew what toppings to add.

749
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,689
You're right. He doesn't know what kind of toppings...

750
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:37,490
- his customers may bring.
- Right.

751
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,520
(He wasn't surprised when he received the toppings.)

752
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:45,130
(And he started making pizza without hesitating.)

753
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,229
(He seems suspiciously skillful at combining ingredients.)

754
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,230
(Could he be real?)

755
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,729
He started making pizza right away.

756
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:50,769
(He seems suspiciously skillful at combining ingredients.)

757
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:51,800
(Could he be real?)

758
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,581
I have a feeling that we'll see him with a famous chef...

759
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:57,709
- at the end of the show.
- Exactly.

760
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:59,286
- That image comes to my mind too.
- I have that kind of feeling.

761
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,440
I'm very suspicious of this place.

762
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:04,709
Wouldn't it be so easy to make a fake place like this?

763
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:05,780
My point, exactly.

764
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,919
- I mean, jjajangmyeon on pizza...
- Oh, it came out.

765
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,989
It's done. The pizza is ready.

766
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:10,049
(Screaming)

767
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:11,970
It looks delicious. It looks like bulgogi pizza.

768
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:15,259
- Jjajangmyeon pizza is ready.
- It doesn't look bad.

769
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,260
It looks quite delicious.

770
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,330
(Staring at the air)

771
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:20,160
(Laughing)

772
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,700
(Now that it's time to try it, they feel nervous.)

773
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:25,010
- He seems to hate it.
- I'm afraid of trying the pizza,

774
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,399
- which has never happened to me.
- I'm so curious.

775
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,469
(Terrified)

776
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,539
Unbelievable.

777
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,370
Goodness. I wonder how it tastes.

778
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:33,479
- Hey, it's coming out.
- It looks great, though.

779
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,480
It's coming out.

780
00:27:34,481 --> 00:27:37,749
It's half jjajangmyeon, half spicy duck.

781
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:40,850
To be honest, I can't seem to get myself to try it either.

782
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:43,210
(Have you ever seen a pizza like this?)

783
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,796
(On top of basic toppings, jjajangmyeon fills half the dough.)

784
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:48,960
(Jjajangmyeon's powerful presence can't be hidden under cheese.)

785
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,829
(An entire bowl of jjajangmyeon...)

786
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,700
(is on the pizza!)

787
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,870
(How does jjajangmyeon pizza, that Jae Seok picked, taste?)

788
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:59,340
- Let's put it in front of Jae Seok.
- Here.

789
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,939
- You can have it, Jae Seok.
- It's here.

790
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,369
- It's here.
- Jae Seok.

791
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:05,569
- You didn't have to move it here.
- Jae Seok...

792
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:07,479
Jae Seok, you can have it all by yourself.

793
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,150
- My gosh.
- It smells good, though.

794
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:11,850
This part is jjajangmyeon pizza.

795
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,950
- It smells so good.
- It's just jjajangmyeon.

796
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,520
I'll smell it.

797
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:18,389
- My, it smells...
- Does it smell crazy good?

798
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:19,510
- Yes.
- Does it smell okay?

799
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,840
It smells like normal pizza.

800
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:23,660
I think it could be okay.

801
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:26,430
- I'll try the jjajangmyeon pizza.
- Okay.

802
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,659
Oh, that... I mean, it looks very delicious.

803
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,930
(Overly immersed)

804
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:34,240
(Everyone's eye is on Jae Seok.)

805
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:36,230
It seems to take some time for him to react.

806
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,280
It's not bad.

807
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,710
It's not bad.

808
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,210
- What? Really?
- Yes.

809
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:46,620
(He has another bite right away.)

810
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,650
(Exclaiming with satisfaction)

811
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:51,520
- I'll try the jjajangmyeon pizza.
- It's not bad at all.

812
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,340
The jjajang flavor is not strong.

813
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,860
(Puzzled)

814
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:00,599
- I see why he reacted a bit late.
- Right.

815
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,159
- I've never had this taste before.
- Right?

816
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,600
- Yes, exactly.
- But it's harmonious. It's good.

817
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:07,800
One of the toppings here is jjajangmyeon.

818
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,540
- It's not bad.
- It's jjajangmyeon.

819
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:11,439
(Pickled radish is better with salty jjajangmyeon pizza.)

820
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,309
- It's quite good.
- Oh, really?

821
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,380
Yes, it's good.

822
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:17,510
The jjajang flavor is not so strong.

823
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,019
- The jjajangmyeon pizza is good.
- Right. I like...

824
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,380
- the jjajangmyeon pizza.
- Right?

825
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,019
- The jjajangmyeon pizza is...
- It's unexpectedly good.

826
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,900
- Exactly. It's unexpectedly good.
- It's good.

827
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:29,559
The jjajang flavor isn't so strong. It's not bad, right?

828
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,789
(The sweet and sour pizza sauce upgraded the jjajang flavor!)

829
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:31,889
- It's not bad, right?
- It's not bad.

830
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:33,136
(The sweet and sour pizza sauce upgraded the jjajang flavor!)

831
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,759
- It's good.
- It's good.

832
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,760
Is it?

833
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:37,270
Another pizza we ordered is here.

834
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:39,439
Braised kimchi and tteokbokki.

835
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,970
- Yes.
- It looks good.

836
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:44,570
(The spicy braised kimchi that every Korean likes...)

837
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:48,240
(is put on a pizza.)

838
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:51,220
(A lot of pizza cheese is added to balance out the spiciness.)

839
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,749
- I'll try the braised kimchi pizza.
- Braised kimchi pizza.

840
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,919
(How does braised kimchi pizza taste?)

841
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,549
- It could be tasty.
- Right.

842
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:58,989
- I'm sure it's tasty. The sauce...
- This is what I think.

843
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:00,666
I'm sure it's tasty since jjajangmyeon pizza is good.

844
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:02,660
(Smiling happily)

845
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:04,929
- Tteokbokki.
- The braised kimchi pizza tastes...

846
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:06,159
just like kim-pi-tang.

847
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,160
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

848
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,430
(Hwasa tries a bite right away.)

849
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,339
- Kimchi...
- Is it good?

850
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,900
- never betrays us.
- Right. It's good.

851
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:19,509
There's a large amount of topping here. I see why it's expensive.

852
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:20,716
(A large amount of chosen topping is put on the pizza.)

853
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:23,509
- It's added to basic toppings.
- Right.

854
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:25,526
- I understand why it's expensive.
- It's understandable.

855
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:26,580
(Blowing on the pizza)

856
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,219
(Putting it into his mouth)

857
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,290
It's good.

858
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,619
- Braised kimchi goes well...
- Braised kimchi was a good choice.

859
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,566
(Everyone agrees that braised kimchi pizza is good.)

860
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:35,320
Is it because we like kimchi so much?

861
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,260
- Braised kimchi pizza is the best.
- Right?

862
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:40,600
- Braised kimchi pizza is so good.
- Yes, I really like it.

863
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,600
- A pizza hasn't come out yet.
- What is it?

864
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:47,440
- Cookies.
- Cookies and mango.

865
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Oh, is it dessert?

866
00:30:49,001 --> 00:30:50,010
(Oh, is it dessert?)

867
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,739
We'll even have dessert after pizza. It's perfect.

868
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,020
- Right.
- It was enough for me.

869
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,680
- Oh, it's coming out.
- I'm looking forward to it.

870
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:58,279
Here's the chocolate cookie and mango pizza.

871
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,249
- Nice.
- The mango is cooked, indeed.

872
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:01,280
- Yes, it is.
- Oh, my.

873
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:05,019
Many customers who like sweets...

874
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,590
order this kind of pizza.

875
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:10,390
You may wonder if such toppings that we usually have for dessert...

876
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:13,000
go well with tomato sauce and pizza cheese.

877
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,099
But when we put sweet and sour mango...

878
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,269
on top of everything...

879
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,550
and cook them all in the oven...

880
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,840
It's a consistently popular dish,

881
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,110
which is unexpected.

882
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,980
(Finally, the time has come.)

883
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,309
It seems that he mixed mango and chocolate cookies.

884
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,610
Oh, he mixed them together.

885
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:33,050
- Then we can have 1 piece each.
- We can have 1 piece each.

886
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,849
(I wanted to try a pizza with only mango.)

887
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:37,049
I can't even avoid eating it.

888
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:38,720
(I can't even avoid eating it.)

889
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,420
You can never avoid it.

890
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:44,529
- Did you want to avoid eating it?
- Let's face it head-on together.

891
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:47,159
- I should face it and try hard.
- All right.

892
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,441
("I should face it and try hard." by working idol Haewon)

893
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:51,900
This pizza has a strong scent of chocolate.

894
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:53,299
(Sniffing)

895
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,339
(Suprised)

896
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,800
It smells like a brownie.

897
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:57,709
- It smells really good, though.
- Brownie?

898
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:58,909
- Yes, brownie.
- That's right.

899
00:31:58,910 --> 00:31:59,979
It's weird that it's pizza...

900
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,740
- when it smells like this.
- I know, right?

901
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:05,879
(Mimi, the dessert lover, tastes it without hesitating.)

902
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,580
(Surprised)

903
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:09,989
(Exclaiming with surprise)

904
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:12,019
(Jae Seok exclaims with surprise.)

905
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,090
Really?

906
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,420
It's good.

907
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,120
- Really? Are you serious?
- It's good.

908
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:18,829
- No way.
- Yes.

909
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:19,830
You see...

910
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,960
I thought it'd taste weird with cookies.

911
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:23,999
- Cookies go well with pizza.
- Yes.

912
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,529
The crunchy texture is still there.

913
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:27,090
- Cookies became even tastier.
- Right.

914
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,009
- The mango became a bit sour.
- Yes, but it's good.

915
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:31,509
- It's sweet and sour.
- Indeed.

916
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:33,040
- It's really sweet and sour.
- Yes.

917
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:35,100
But I don't think I'll have this again.

918
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,480
Me neither.

919
00:32:36,481 --> 00:32:38,049
(Laughing out loud)

920
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:39,379
It's too sweet. My tongue feels weird.

921
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,549
- Me too.
- I feel the same way.

922
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:42,689
- It's so sweet my tongue is numb.
- Is it not too sweet for you?

923
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:44,789
That's why Mimi speaks weirdly. It's because she likes sweets.

924
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:46,290
Oh, I see.

925
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,130
- She failed to manage blood sugar.
- That's right.

926
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:50,889
That's true.

927
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:52,699
That's why I can't speak clearly.

928
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,100
As soon as it goes into your mouth, your body will hate you.

929
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,169
But I really like this.

930
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:58,506
(The dessert pizza suits the sweets expert Mimi's taste.)

931
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:01,270
(But be careful as it can increase your blood sugar level.)

932
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:03,710
Now, I'm going to try tteokbokki pizza.

933
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,870
- I'm sure it's good.
- Right.

934
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:09,040
(Spicy tteokbokki is used to make pizza?)

935
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:11,280
(The fantastic combination of carbs)

936
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:14,010
(Spicy tteokbokki will balance out the greasiness of pizza.)

937
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,220
(How does tteokbokki pizza taste?)

938
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:21,990
(Jae Seok puts it into his mouth without hesitating.)

939
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,029
(What?)

940
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,030
How do you like it?

941
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:27,230
(Chuckling)

942
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,800
- I think he doesn't like it.
- He doesn't seem to like it.

943
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,569
Gosh, this pizza is too spicy.

944
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:32,630
It must be spicy.

945
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,670
Those who like spicy food have this.

946
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:39,169
- This is...
- It's not so good, right?

947
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:41,210
- It's hard to say, right?
- Yes, it's hard to say.

948
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,980
Really? I like tteokbokki pizza.

949
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:46,419
- Gosh, it's so spicy.
- But it has a strong flavor...

950
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,319
- of the Y tteokbokki sauce.
- Right.

951
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,950
The flavor of the spicy sauce is strong.

952
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,459
Those who like the spicy sauce may like this.

953
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,296
(They either love it or hate it. Is the custom pizza real?)

954
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,889
I rate braised kimchi pizza number one.

955
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:59,159
- My second best is jjajangmyeon.
- Jjajangmyeon pizza was quite good.

956
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,929
- I agree.
- I enjoyed jjajangmyeon pizza.

957
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:02,029
- I didn't like tteokbokki pizza.
- I didn't like it either.

958
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:03,030
- I didn't like it either.
- Right.

959
00:34:03,031 --> 00:34:05,031
- Tteokbokki doesn't go with it.
- It's too spicy,

960
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:06,499
and I can't eat rice cakes in one bite.

961
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,500
- That's right.
- Right.

962
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,999
My, that was good.

963
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,169
(The Anything Pizza combinations recommended by the members)

964
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:13,730
(1st place: Braised kimchi pizza, 2nd place: Jjajangmyeon pizza)

965
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,010
Anyway, what's important is...

966
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:18,409
that we have to figure out...

967
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:19,919
- if this custom pizza exists.
- That's right.

968
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,450
- That's what we should do.
- Yes.

969
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,620
(Even the first place is very difficult to figure out.)

970
00:34:22,621 --> 00:34:23,649
This is difficult.

971
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:24,810
I don't think they sell this.

972
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:27,190
I have a feeling that this place is fake.

973
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,659
- Right. I, too, feel...
- That it's fake.

974
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:29,660
- I mean...
- I agree.

975
00:34:29,661 --> 00:34:31,289
- This isn't necessary.
- Exactly.

976
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:32,999
- Right.
- Just as Jae Seok said,

977
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
- it's not necessary.
- It's not necessary, right?

978
00:34:34,001 --> 00:34:35,521
- They don't have to do this.
- Right.

979
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:38,300
And I visited many places as a caterer for my show.

980
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:40,940
A pizzeria doesn't need a gas stove.

981
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,700
That's right.

982
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,070
What?

983
00:34:45,071 --> 00:34:46,916
(There's a gas stove that doesn't suit a pizzeria?)

984
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,260
- He's right.
- There's one here.

985
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:51,950
Also, as for the pizza oven,

986
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,249
it has wheels.

987
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:55,820
It tells me that it might've been put in there in a hurry.

988
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:59,820
(Did the staff set the oven in a hurry for the show?)

989
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,390
(The oven seems suspicious because it has wheels?)

990
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,229
If I had a friend who loved pizza,

991
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:08,376
I'd order a custom pizza on her birthday as a surprise.

992
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,899
It'd be good for a surprise.

993
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:10,929
- Right.
- It'd be a great idea.

994
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:12,569
I'd order seaweed pizza for a friend's birthday...

995
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:13,670
instead of seaweed soup.

996
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:16,710
- Mimi, what's your favorite?
- I ate this one.

997
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,569
Oh, my. She likes the dessert pizza?

998
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:19,679
It was so good.

999
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,639
- It was really good.
- I gave her a large slice.

1000
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,049
- And she ate it all.
- I finished it.

1001
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:24,949
- It was good.
- We'll visit other places too.

1002
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:25,950
I'll be fine.

1003
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,950
Are my hands swollen? Is my blood sugar okay?

1004
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:31,119
I think it's okay so far.

1005
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,920
- Can you tell by tapping it?
- Yes.

1006
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,066
- She checks her blood sugar...
- Blood sugar, check.

1007
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:36,989
- She checks her heart to check it.
- Blood sugar, check.

1008
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:38,229
- Check. Done.
- She checks her blood sugar...

1009
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:39,630
by tapping her heart.

1010
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,529
- Shall we go to the next place?
- Yes.

1011
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:42,899
(Anything Pizza: 1. The owner is skillful with unusual ingredients.)

1012
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,299
(2. Custom pizza is perfect for creating online content.)

1013
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,060
(3. Unnecessary gas stove, oven with wheels)

1014
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,699
(They set off to go to the second place Anything "F.")

1015
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,716
(1st floor, H supermarket Chang-dong branch, Dobong-gu, Seoul)

1016
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:54,410
Let's fix my lip makeup.

1017
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:57,809
(Dabbing)

1018
00:35:57,810 --> 00:35:59,350
(She's cute.)

1019
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:02,319
- I'll check on my looks.
- Looks, check!

1020
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,120
(Looks, check!)

1021
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:06,360
(Impressed)

1022
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,019
Not many idol stars have their own catchphrases.

1023
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,529
- She's right.
- Exactly.

1024
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:10,589
It's amazing.

1025
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:11,989
I'm proud of myself.

1026
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:14,129
- I used to be a bit embarrassed.
- Really?

1027
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,829
Why? Do you have your own catchphrase?

1028
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:17,729
- She just said it. "Looks, check!" - "Looks, check!"

1029
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,599
- I see. "Looks, check." - Yes.

1030
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,869
- Hey.
- Hey.

1031
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:23,169
That's Hwasa's catchphrase.

1032
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:24,569
- "Hey." - "Hey."

1033
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:26,010
She made her own catchphrase.

1034
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,709
By the way, the pizzeria...

1035
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:30,070
It feels like a fake place, right?

1036
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:32,549
It feels like a fake place, but places like it are real sometimes.

1037
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,679
- Exactly.
- Right.

1038
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,949
Our choices of toppings were not exactly satisfactory.

1039
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:38,589
So if you just bring the right topping...

1040
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:39,666
(Anything Pizza could be real if you choose the right topping?)

1041
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:40,690
I think it makes sense, though.

1042
00:36:40,691 --> 00:36:42,159
- It makes sense.
- It's a plausible idea.

1043
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,689
The owner told us his story.

1044
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:44,859
For the 1st 6 months,

1045
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,959
- his business didn't go well.
- Right.

1046
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,629
And custom pizza was the solution he came up with.

1047
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:50,630
That's right.

1048
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:52,429
What is our next place to visit?

1049
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:54,139
Our next place to visit is...

1050
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,800
Anything "F."

1051
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,539
The pizzeria was Anything "P," right?

1052
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,909
- Yes, "P" as in "pizza." - As in "pizza."

1053
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:00,039
Anything Pizza.

1054
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,540
The address is unusual.

1055
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:04,179
The first floor in H supermarket Chang-dong branch.

1056
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,409
What? Hold on.

1057
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:08,119
It seems to be a store in the supermarket.

1058
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,720
- Is it "fish?" - "Fish?"

1059
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,260
- Oh, meat? I mean, fish.
- Yes, fish.

1060
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:16,859
"Fish..." I won't be able to think of anything else.

1061
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,730
Food court.

1062
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:22,129
- Oh, food court.
- Impressive.

1063
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:23,630
Oh, brain.

1064
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:25,899
(After a long time, a sharp member came on the show.)

1065
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,039
- Hey.
- "Brain."

1066
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,539
- Nice.
- Hey.

1067
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,009
- Hey.
- Hey.

1068
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:31,010
Thank you.

1069
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,540
What's famous in Dobong-gu?

1070
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:37,650
- Yu Jae Seok.
- In Dobong-gu? Me.

1071
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:40,120
- Are you from Dobong-gu?
- Yes.

1072
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,480
Suyu-ri.

1073
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,289
"Suyu-ri."

1074
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:45,219
"Reply 1988" was filmed...

1075
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,460
- In Ssangmun-dong.
- It's in Dobong-gu, right?

1076
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:50,529
I heard someone asked after watching the drama,

1077
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:52,506
"Did people really share food with their neighbors..."

1078
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:54,499
"back in the days as it was depicted in the drama?"

1079
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,999
- Oh, right. Was it...
- Someone asked that.

1080
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,830
What was it really like back then?

1081
00:37:58,570 --> 00:37:59,740
(People received food.)

1082
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,370
(People gave food away.)

1083
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,760
(Kyoung Pyo acted in the drama, set in those days, in his 20s.)

1084
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:09,279
(Back then, it was common to share food with neighbors.)

1085
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,379
I miss those days.

1086
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,450
- People cared about one another.
- Right.

1087
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:16,549
These days, it doesn't feel right even to greet neighbors sometimes.

1088
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:18,219
- Right.
- That's right.

1089
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,089
Because they might not want it.

1090
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,659
- Exactly.
- Some people might not want...

1091
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:22,919
- to say hello.
- Right.

1092
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,930
You're right.

1093
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:28,400
Do Yoon Mi Rae and Tiger JK still live in Uijeongbu?

1094
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,170
Yes, they still live in Uijeongbu.

1095
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,829
They live in this area?

1096
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:34,970
Tiger JK, Kang Ho Dong, and I have the same birthday.

1097
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:36,539
- Really?
- You guys have the same birthday?

1098
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,380
Yes. I was very proud of it when I was little.

1099
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,380
I have the same birthday as Jae Seok's son.

1100
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,879
Hey, that's incredible.

1101
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,279
- I'm his heiress.
- What... "His heiress?"

1102
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,600
- She claims to be my heiress.
- Why would you inherit it?

1103
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,689
Before Ji Ho becomes an adult,

1104
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:51,919
I'll finish the game.

1105
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,560
- "Finish the game?" - "Finish the game?"

1106
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:55,159
- What are you talking about?
- You're ambitious, Mimi.

1107
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,059
(He now has an adult daughter.)

1108
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,659
- You mean, you'll end the game?
- That's so funny.

1109
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,736
(The blunt sister is very sharp at only times like this.)

1110
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,159
I'll wait for the right time.

1111
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,276
(They're leaving Uijeongbu while debating the heirship.)

1112
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,669
I'm disappointed...

1113
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:07,769
that we're leaving Uijeongbu without having army stew.

1114
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:09,099
- Uijeongbu is famous for army stew.
- Yes, Uijeongbu is famous...

1115
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,909
- for army stew.
- Oh, that's right.

1116
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:13,209
You guys know the origin of army stew, right?

1117
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:14,309
- What is it?
- With food from an army...

1118
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,749
- Hear the story-telling grandpa.
- Okay.

1119
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:19,820
Since there were many military bases in Uijeongbu and nearby areas...

1120
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:21,349
There was...

1121
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:23,990
a large US military base in Uijeongbu.

1122
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:27,330
So people used food scraps like ham from the military base...

1123
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:28,959
to make army stew.

1124
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,659
Did they make stew in the military base?

1125
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,589
- People living around the base did.
- The soldiers made it?

1126
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:34,259
(As the Western food were greasy, they added Korean food.)

1127
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:37,299
I heard that foreigners like army stew so much.

1128
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,800
- Right.
- Foreigners like it.

1129
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,869
Talking about army stew makes me crave it.

1130
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:41,870
- Me too.
- Right?

1131
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:42,870
I just swallowed saliva.

1132
00:39:42,871 --> 00:39:44,170
(Swallowing saliva)

1133
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,639
- The hot soup...
- Adding ramyeon noodles to it...

1134
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,640
Exactly.

1135
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,079
(Screaming with joy)

1136
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,080
(She finds him interesting every time she sees him like this.)

1137
00:39:52,081 --> 00:39:53,419
- Yes.
- After having some soup...

1138
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,949
It's so good when it's boiled down a little bit, right?

1139
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:57,350
It's absolutely fantastic.

1140
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:59,320
I'm hungry now.

1141
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:02,089
Even the river is frozen too.

1142
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:03,706
(The car takes them deeper into a remote road.)

1143
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:06,390
- Oh, what is this place?
- What is this?

1144
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:07,929
There are many nice places in this area.

1145
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:10,146
- I'm surprised to see such a place.
- This place looks nice too.

1146
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:11,999
(Another trendy place in Uijeongbu...)

1147
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,200
(that they will stop by before going to the next place)

1148
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,269
But it seems so hard to find the way to wherever we're going.

1149
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:18,809
It must be a trendy place, though, right?

1150
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:20,509
- I know, but these days...
- People look for places like this.

1151
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:21,756
People look for places like this.

1152
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,149
- Driving on the road...
- There could be a famous cafe.

1153
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,509
Where there doesn't seem to be any trendy places.

1154
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:25,949
That's exactly my point.

1155
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:27,956
(After going uphill along the curvy road for a while, )

1156
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:30,890
(they see the snowy kingdom in front of their eyes.)

1157
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:33,520
My goodness. How beautiful.

1158
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:34,959
It's magnificent.

1159
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,989
Shall we go?

1160
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:37,429
Let's go.

1161
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:38,959
My gosh. What is that?

1162
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,229
The snow makes it look even more beautiful.

1163
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,659
- Hey, look over there.
- Guys, there's...

1164
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:43,670
- an ice cliff over there.
- That's beautiful.

1165
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,699
- It's an ice valley.
- How was it formed that way?

1166
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,099
- Oh, my.
- How was it...

1167
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,800
- Oh, my.
- How was it formed like this?

1168
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,439
Let's go.

1169
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,969
My gosh. What is that?

1170
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:53,209
The snow makes it look even more beautiful.

1171
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:54,839
- Hey, look over there.
- Guys, there's...

1172
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,680
- an ice cliff over there.
- That's beautiful.

1173
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:58,809
- It's an ice valley.
- How was it formed that way?

1174
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:00,119
- Oh, my.
- How was it...

1175
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,879
- Oh, my.
- How was it formed like this?

1176
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,589
- What is that?
- That's insane.

1177
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:05,890
That's amazing.

1178
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:11,359
(The ice wall is enormous.)

1179
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,860
How did they make this?

1180
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:14,930
- It's amazing.
- Gosh.

1181
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:19,430
(After you pass through this normal looking cafe, )

1182
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:22,470
(you'll be face to face with this enormous ice wall.)

1183
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:27,780
(It's Mother Nature's most perfect artwork of the winter.)

1184
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:31,179
(This place is always crowded with people who come to enjoy the snow.)

1185
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,209
(Take pictures like this.)

1186
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:36,450
(This trendy place in Uijeongbu is famous for being picture-perfect.)

1187
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:39,519
Gosh, this is amazing.

1188
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,860
This is really cool.

1189
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:43,730
I think they made this for the winter.

1190
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:45,429
It's so nice.

1191
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:47,230
There's no water inside, right?

1192
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,299
- Where?
- Is there water beneath this?

1193
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,906
It would be frozen because there's water.

1194
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:53,069
(Mimi is being blunt already.)

1195
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:54,070
Mimi.

1196
00:41:54,071 --> 00:41:55,869
(Haewon got a firsthand look at the legendary bluntness.)

1197
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:57,339
Let's go down. We can get a better view.

1198
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:00,010
There are lots of cool places these days.

1199
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:02,009
What happens in the summer?

1200
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:04,210
- In the summer, this will flow.
- The water will flow.

1201
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,049
There's a natural valley...

1202
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:08,449
and a man-made waterfall.

1203
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:11,220
(In the summer, cool water flows through the valley.)

1204
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:15,590
(The ice wall is available until the end of March.)

1205
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,059
Be careful, everyone.

1206
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,530
- Watch your step.
- Right.

1207
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:20,860
- You could fall.
- "You could fall."

1208
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,199
(He's imitating Mimi again today.)

1209
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,470
"You could fall."

1210
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:27,370
"You could fall."

1211
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,570
Gosh, you're embarrassing me.

1212
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:33,339
Is this stressing you out?

1213
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:36,010
You sound just like me.

1214
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:38,610
This is really cool.

1215
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:40,980
Gosh.

1216
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:43,990
(Kyoung Pyo's point of view. Everyone, look at this!)

1217
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:46,859
Gosh, this is really amazing.

1218
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:49,160
- But how did they...
- It's beautiful.

1219
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,389
Gosh.

1220
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:51,629
Look at the sleds.

1221
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:53,500
There are sleds here.

1222
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:55,299
Gosh, isn't this so funny?

1223
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,560
They put cameras on them.

1224
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,499
Cameras?

1225
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,939
Wait, so...

1226
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:03,139
why did you put the cameras here?

1227
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:05,070
They even used tape to secure them.

1228
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:08,380
- They want us to ride these.
- They want us to ride these.

1229
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:13,379
(The sleds are another attraction of this place.)

1230
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:14,679
This is amazing. We should ride them.

1231
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,579
Yes, we really should.

1232
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:18,049
- Right.
- All right. Get on the sleds.

1233
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:19,120
Okay.

1234
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:20,789
Kyoung Pyo and I will pull.

1235
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:22,089
Really? Go ahead.

1236
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:23,590
(Gosh)

1237
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:25,629
Dad, this is so fun!

1238
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:27,230
- Are you having fun?
- Dad!

1239
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:30,729
Gosh, Dad!

1240
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:31,730
Gosh, Dad!

1241
00:43:31,731 --> 00:43:33,299
(Shaking)

1242
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:36,200
Gosh. Dad, wait.

1243
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:37,410
Gosh.

1244
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:40,379
- Gosh, Dad.
- Goodness.

1245
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:41,879
Gosh, niece.

1246
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,379
(The uncle is not that good at pulling the sled.)

1247
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:45,550
- Gosh, uncle.
- Gosh, niece. Are you okay?

1248
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,549
You have to be careful. Watch your toe.

1249
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:49,279
- You have to watch your toe.
- No, I'll...

1250
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,889
I'll hold this.

1251
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:52,690
- Watch your toe.
- Be careful.

1252
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:54,760
All right.

1253
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:58,260
- Your hand must be freezing.
- I'm okay.

1254
00:43:58,330 --> 00:43:59,389
(Gosh)

1255
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:00,500
Let's go.

1256
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,700
(He's going really fast.)

1257
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,399
(That looks fun.)

1258
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,400
Gosh.

1259
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:09,840
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

1260
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:11,910
(He suddenly turned.)

1261
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:14,579
(This sled ride is thrilling.)

1262
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:16,140
- Kyoung Pyo, be careful.
- Be careful.

1263
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:18,010
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

1264
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:19,610
They're all...

1265
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:21,319
Gosh. Kyoung Pyo.

1266
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,050
- Haewon, get on the sled.
- Okay.

1267
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:24,419
You show them, uncle.

1268
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:25,989
Okay.

1269
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:27,520
- Come on, niece.
- Yes.

1270
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,430
Come on, niece.

1271
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:32,660
(Screaming)

1272
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,370
(She feels as if she's a little kid again.)

1273
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:39,469
Who's next?

1274
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:41,340
At the camera.

1275
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:42,769
It's the best.

1276
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:44,540
Mimi, you're up next.

1277
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:47,880
(Please do a good job, uncle.)

1278
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:49,939
- I'm quite heavy.
- Let's go.

1279
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:51,010
(Gosh)

1280
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:53,880
(She looks comfortable while sitting cross-legged.)

1281
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:57,820
Go faster!

1282
00:44:58,020 --> 00:44:59,789
(Go faster.)

1283
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:01,560
- Gosh.
- We'll stop here.

1284
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:03,689
(Uncle's sled ride stopped too soon.)

1285
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:04,690
What?

1286
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:06,230
Who's next?

1287
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:08,329
- I'll give it a ride.
- You can't avoid it.

1288
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:09,399
Get on the sled.

1289
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,970
Goodness. This will take me a while.

1290
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:12,500
All right.

1291
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:14,299
- Let's go.
- You got this.

1292
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:15,740
- Yes.
- Let's go.

1293
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:17,540
Gosh, this is...

1294
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:18,540
(Shrieking)

1295
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:21,339
(This is so exciting!)

1296
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:22,680
This is fun.

1297
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:26,026
(She got into an accident as Kyoung Pyo made a quick turn.)

1298
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:27,119
This is fun.

1299
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,050
(Eun I fell off the sled.)

1300
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:30,190
Goodness.

1301
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,520
(Haewon is running to her.)

1302
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:33,590
Eun I!

1303
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:37,759
You.

1304
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,090
(Come here!)

1305
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:40,700
Gosh.

1306
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:43,059
What are you doing?

1307
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:44,530
This is how you sled.

1308
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:46,229
Sledding down this would be fun.

1309
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:47,440
Be careful.

1310
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:48,970
Hey.

1311
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,070
(He became one with the sled.)

1312
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,480
(Gosh)

1313
00:45:58,210 --> 00:46:02,920
(Childish Yu was craving attention.)

1314
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:05,889
(They burst out laughing.)

1315
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:07,220
This is how you sled.

1316
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:08,859
Down this hill.

1317
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:10,530
You should sled down this hill.

1318
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,029
It's more fun than you'd think.

1319
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:14,100
Be careful.

1320
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,969
(Ready.)

1321
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:18,900
(Go.)

1322
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:21,340
Gosh.

1323
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:25,339
- Gosh.
- The camera.

1324
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:26,979
- The camera broke.
- Kyoung Pyo.

1325
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:28,210
The camera.

1326
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:29,640
The expensive camera.

1327
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,849
(Thankfully, it's all right.)

1328
00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:37,790
This show is really chaotic.

1329
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:39,989
- I felt too lazy to ride the sled, - Go ahead.

1330
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:41,159
But it's actually fun.

1331
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,390
People would...

1332
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:44,259
definitely have fun here.

1333
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:45,689
Taking pictures here is a must.

1334
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:47,299
- We have to take a picture.
- Sounds good.

1335
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:48,499
Come on.

1336
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,870
(The Sixth Sense members make their fifth memory together.)

1337
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:59,910
(Anything Road, Frozen in Uijeongbu)

1338
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:03,140
The way I see it,

1339
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:04,879
people could have their first kiss here.

1340
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:05,880
(People could have their first kiss here.)

1341
00:47:05,881 --> 00:47:07,019
People could have their first kiss here.

1342
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:08,479
(That comment was so Gen X.)

1343
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,549
- This is a place...
- Gosh, Jae Seok.

1344
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:11,849
For people in love to...

1345
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:13,389
- No, listen.
- That's so corny.

1346
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:14,490
The ice...

1347
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,930
- That's so corny.
- That's so corny.

1348
00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:20,200
Hey, Hwasa.

1349
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:22,000
That's so harsh.

1350
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:24,370
(Jae Seok finishes off with a corny dance!)

1351
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:25,730
(What's wrong with him?)

1352
00:47:25,731 --> 00:47:27,439
- You're too harsh.
- Now do it from the other side too.

1353
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,599
The other side.

1354
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:31,120
- You'll get pelvic distortion.
- You'll get pelvic distortion.

1355
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,440
People should have their first kiss at a place like this.

1356
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,479
You haven't even had your first kiss.

1357
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,549
(With uncle's advice, )

1358
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:38,780
That's ridiculous.

1359
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:41,580
(the Sixth Sense members arrive at the second location.)

1360
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:44,290
(What could "F" mean?)

1361
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:48,219
(The second trendy place is huge and right next to Jungnang Stream.)

1362
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:49,959
- That's a real Hanaro Mart.
- It is.

1363
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:51,830
Right. What could be on the first floor here?

1364
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:53,430
Could it really be a food court?

1365
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:54,859
- Gosh.
- But this place is...

1366
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:56,830
huge even for a grocery store.

1367
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,129
- I smell something tasty.
- This is...

1368
00:47:58,130 --> 00:47:59,869
We can smell food already.

1369
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:01,799
It smells like a food court.

1370
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,040
A food court.

1371
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,740
- It would be warm here, right?
- Yes.

1372
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,880
You're wearing your gloves again.

1373
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:11,149
(Looking around)

1374
00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:13,590
Gosh, it's been a while since I've been at a store like this.

1375
00:48:13,650 --> 00:48:16,119
- There's no reason to come here.
- Right, it's been so long.

1376
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:18,389
Being at a grocery store is fun.

1377
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:20,671
Gosh, there's a lot of people here this early in the day.

1378
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:24,330
(There's a trendy place here where it's very crowded?)

1379
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:25,629
- This looks good.
- Right?

1380
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:27,000
- The jeonbyeong...
- Gosh.

1381
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:28,600
This looks good.

1382
00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:30,399
- Right in front?
- Where?

1383
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,500
Where? Is this it?

1384
00:48:31,730 --> 00:48:32,799
- What?
- What?

1385
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,139
This is...

1386
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:36,039
Wait, it was an "F."

1387
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:37,070
What's this?

1388
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:39,139
"Frying Mill?"

1389
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:41,109
(We'll fry anything for you.)

1390
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:42,380
"F" as in "fry."

1391
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:44,710
I see. The "F" stands for "fry."

1392
00:48:44,850 --> 00:48:46,450
- It's "fry." - It must be fritters.

1393
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:48,850
(Today's second trendy place)

1394
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:51,989
(We'll fry anything for you.)

1395
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:55,160
(Fry anything)

1396
00:48:55,490 --> 00:48:58,830
(These are not your ordinary fried food.)

1397
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:01,760
(Here, they fry anything.)

1398
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:05,570
(Let's see what kind of unique trendy place this is!)

1399
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:07,339
It's "fry."

1400
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:09,300
But isn't this place famous?

1401
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:12,210
- You're in the algorithm again.
- I think I saw this.

1402
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:14,139
I think this is a real place.

1403
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:16,010
- Gosh, hello.
- Yes, hello.

1404
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:17,979
Do you fry anything here?

1405
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:19,149
Yes, that's right.

1406
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:22,279
We fry whatever food you bring us.

1407
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:23,320
What?

1408
00:49:23,650 --> 00:49:25,389
So people bring you food bought from the grocery store,

1409
00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:27,460
- and you fry them here?
- Yes, that's right.

1410
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:29,559
(Everything...)

1411
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:32,830
(that's sold at the store?)

1412
00:49:33,090 --> 00:49:35,800
(We fry everything...)

1413
00:49:36,830 --> 00:49:39,100
(except shoes.)

1414
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:40,769
(We fry...)

1415
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:42,140
(the entire store.)

1416
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,309
(How?)

1417
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:49,309
We developed an ultrasonic deep fryer,

1418
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:50,779
which we can fry anything with.

1419
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:52,020
(We fry anything you bring us.)

1420
00:49:52,350 --> 00:49:56,020
(One fry coming right up!)

1421
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:57,790
The ultrasonic fryer...

1422
00:49:58,050 --> 00:50:00,389
decreases cooking fumes that are emitted...

1423
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:03,690
when deep frying by more than 70 percent.

1424
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:07,599
It was impossible for regular fried food places...

1425
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:08,729
(This technology is what made it possible...)

1426
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:11,069
to fry anything for customers.

1427
00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:13,390
(for them to fry different kinds of food in one fry tank.)

1428
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:15,599
Since we fry cool food,

1429
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:16,899
(Since we fry cool food, )

1430
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:20,310
our customers range from children to adults.

1431
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:23,579
We were fortunate enough that a lot of YouTubers...

1432
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:24,910
came and filmed here.

1433
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:28,520
(Their uniqueness made them trendy on social media.)

1434
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:29,880
(The videos went viral...)

1435
00:50:29,881 --> 00:50:31,619
(and got an explosive amount of views.)

1436
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:33,250
For our fry options,

1437
00:50:33,790 --> 00:50:35,819
we have starch, rice powder, frying mix,

1438
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:37,729
sweet rice powder, breadcrumbs, cinnamon, garlic powder,

1439
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:39,529
herb powder, curry powder,

1440
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:41,060
mustard powder, and coconut powder.

1441
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:42,799
We have a total of 13 different options.

1442
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,470
(They have 13 different fry options.)

1443
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:49,039
(The king of fries)

1444
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,910
Sixth Sense members. Am I the real king of fries?

1445
00:50:55,910 --> 00:50:58,479
What kind of food do customers bring you?

1446
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,720
They usually bring seasonal ingredients.

1447
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,819
Deep frying is hard to do at home.

1448
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:06,189
- That's right.
- That's right.

1449
00:51:06,190 --> 00:51:08,659
- This is great.
- This is so nice.

1450
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:11,330
- I think this place is real.
- This place seems real.

1451
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:13,160
Ultrasonic frying?

1452
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:14,760
Ultrasonic frying?

1453
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:17,270
- Ultrasonic as in...
- Do you not use oil, then?

1454
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:20,030
Exposing the oil to ultrasonic waves...

1455
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:23,140
solves various problems that we know of.

1456
00:51:24,110 --> 00:51:25,910
It doesn't emit cooking fumes either.

1457
00:51:26,470 --> 00:51:27,510
Ultrasonic waves?

1458
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:31,549
(They've never heard of ultrasonic frying before.)

1459
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:33,920
(Is this place real?)

1460
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:36,649
So do we go buy ingredients and get them fried here?

1461
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:37,650
Yes, that's right.

1462
00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:39,989
- Hwasa is injured.
- Right.

1463
00:51:39,990 --> 00:51:42,860
- Hwasa, you stay here.
- I'm a grocery shopping expert.

1464
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:44,980
- I've done it a lot.
- Kyoung Pyo, you go.

1465
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:46,760
- Haewon?
- Haewon, you go with him.

1466
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,429
- I'll go.
- All right.

1467
00:51:48,430 --> 00:51:49,630
(Mimi, the sweet treat expert)

1468
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,040
- Then...
- Gosh, this is nice.

1469
00:51:51,630 --> 00:51:53,470
(Wait a second.)

1470
00:51:53,730 --> 00:51:55,039
You older members should have a seat.

1471
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,309
- All right. Go ahead.
- Sit and relax.

1472
00:51:57,310 --> 00:51:59,139
Us elderlies and the injured will be here.

1473
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:00,210
Take a seat.

1474
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:02,979
Gosh, what a relief. Sit.

1475
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:05,949
Wait, I think you should tell me what you want us to buy.

1476
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:08,470
(They were laughing so much that they forgot to talk about it.)

1477
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:10,749
I want to try fried fruits.

1478
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:12,270
- Let's try fruits, then.
- All right.

1479
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:14,560
What about fried ice cream?

1480
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:16,119
- Those exist.
- Those exist.

1481
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:17,859
Fried ice cream already exists.

1482
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:19,306
- They do?
- At Japanese restaurants.

1483
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:23,530
(They have fried ice cream in foreign countries.)

1484
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,969
In the US, they have fried Oreos.

1485
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:28,269
- Really?
- Yes.

1486
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,300
They're famous.

1487
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:33,910
(Fried Oreos are actually common in the US.)

1488
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,709
- Then let's try fried Oh Yes!
- Okay.

1489
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:38,550
Let's try fried Oh Yes!

1490
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:42,180
We're each in charge of fruits, meat, and snacks.

1491
00:52:43,350 --> 00:52:45,249
(The grocery team sets off to buy the ingredients.)

1492
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:46,250
This is great.

1493
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:48,290
I'll get the ice cream.

1494
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:51,060
Ice creams are over here. I wonder if they have Excellent.

1495
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:53,260
Excellent.

1496
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:56,000
(They start off by getting vanilla ice cream.)

1497
00:52:56,530 --> 00:52:58,370
Snacks. They're over there.

1498
00:52:58,730 --> 00:53:01,200
Snack cakes are over there.

1499
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:03,140
Gosh.

1500
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:06,369
We're buying Oh Yes! and Choco Pie.

1501
00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:08,109
What else?

1502
00:53:08,110 --> 00:53:10,550
(Mimi's choices of ingredients are quite radical.)

1503
00:53:10,810 --> 00:53:13,210
Mimi, can I get Shine Muscats?

1504
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:16,550
(Haewon wants to fry grapes?)

1505
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:19,190
- Which one? Sounds good.
- Great.

1506
00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:22,460
(With Mimi's encouragement, she chooses the most radical one.)

1507
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:24,430
You stay here.

1508
00:53:24,890 --> 00:53:27,659
And then... Strawberries.

1509
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:28,830
(Haewon spots strawberries.)

1510
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:31,200
Well, I like tanghulu.

1511
00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:33,030
We'll buy the cheaper ones.

1512
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:34,639
(Haewon expects fried strawberries to be as good as tanghulu.)

1513
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,040
This is 26 percent off.

1514
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:38,840
(Can the strawberries be fried?)

1515
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:42,440
I chose the discounted strawberries. They should be fine.

1516
00:53:44,450 --> 00:53:45,609
Can I choose something expensive?

1517
00:53:45,610 --> 00:53:47,010
(Can I choose something expensive?)

1518
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:49,500
I'll get the Kingsberry strawberries.

1519
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,520
Kingsberry strawberries.

1520
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:55,790
It's not my money, anyway. We can get Kingsberry strawberries.

1521
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:58,029
This is great. At grocery stores...

1522
00:53:58,030 --> 00:53:59,989
This is definitely doable.

1523
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:02,429
And everything tastes good when fried.

1524
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:03,430
- Right.
- That's right.

1525
00:54:03,431 --> 00:54:06,470
They say even a fried table leg tastes good.

1526
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:10,539
And it feels very efficient.

1527
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:12,070
- It sounds plausible.
- Yes.

1528
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:15,139
Customers buy the ingredients, get them fried, and retrieve them.

1529
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:16,140
That's right.

1530
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:19,480
I buy so many things when I'm grocery shopping.

1531
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:20,919
(I see.)

1532
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:22,620
You lack self-control too?

1533
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,349
(Laughing)

1534
00:54:24,350 --> 00:54:26,889
I just didn't expect that about you.

1535
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:27,960
- I do.
- Of course.

1536
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:30,789
- I tend to want this and that.
- That's usually what happens.

1537
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:31,989
- We're all the same.
- Are you like that too?

1538
00:54:31,990 --> 00:54:34,360
- That makes me feel better. Yes.
- I wonder why.

1539
00:54:34,430 --> 00:54:35,500
I'm back.

1540
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:38,030
- Why did you buy so much?
- This isn't a lot.

1541
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:39,200
- Hey.
- Hey.

1542
00:54:39,530 --> 00:54:41,600
- You bought Oh Yes!
- Why did you get three boxes?

1543
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:45,609
They were on sale. Here. It's fishcake broth.

1544
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:47,139
- You've been craving this.
- Goodness.

1545
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:49,640
- You remembered from earlier?
- I did.

1546
00:54:49,810 --> 00:54:52,780
- This is nice.
- I got you.

1547
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,250
- Hello.
- She's back.

1548
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:55,379
- Haewon.
- Yes.

1549
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:56,649
(Haewon returned soon after.)

1550
00:54:56,650 --> 00:54:59,189
They don't sell individual fruits since this is a grocery store.

1551
00:54:59,190 --> 00:55:00,549
- No.
- Frying these strawberries...

1552
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:01,960
- would be a waste.
- I know.

1553
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:03,319
Kingsberry strawberries...

1554
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:04,666
- These are really good.
- are really expensive.

1555
00:55:04,690 --> 00:55:07,029
We're using the TV station's money anyway,

1556
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:09,459
- so I just bought expensive ones.
- Good.

1557
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:10,599
You're very smart.

1558
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:11,600
(Haewon, smart girl)

1559
00:55:12,130 --> 00:55:14,540
- Here you go.
- I'll fry these too.

1560
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,770
It's been a while since I shopped for groceries.

1561
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:20,370
Gosh, this place is huge.

1562
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:23,479
(Ko Kyoung Pyo, )

1563
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:25,326
(was in charge of grocery shopping on "The Backpacker Chef")

1564
00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:27,519
I see the meat corner.

1565
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:30,550
Where is the the butcher's?

1566
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:32,749
The pork section is over there.

1567
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:34,790
(What is he walking toward without any hesitation?)

1568
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:36,490
Marinated pork ribs.

1569
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,560
Marinated pork ribs.

1570
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,130
(He wants to fry marinated pork ribs?)

1571
00:55:44,830 --> 00:55:47,200
Gosh, I wonder how this would turn out.

1572
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:51,040
(Kyoung Pyo chooses marinated pork ribs.)

1573
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:54,230
(He's looking at the map of the store that the owner gave him.)

1574
00:55:56,510 --> 00:55:57,579
What?

1575
00:55:57,580 --> 00:55:59,350
(Who's calling Kyoung Pyo?)

1576
00:55:59,710 --> 00:56:01,719
- Yes, Jae Seok.
- Hey, Kyoung Pyo.

1577
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:04,220
- Yes?
- Buy some sponge cake for me.

1578
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,950
(Sponge cake all of a sudden?)

1579
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:10,020
Sponge cake? All right.

1580
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:11,660
He wants sponge cake.

1581
00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:13,760
I got an order. Sponge cake.

1582
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:14,859
He got it.

1583
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:15,830
(Childish Yu's extra order)

1584
00:56:15,831 --> 00:56:16,860
I'm relieved now.

1585
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:20,499
I think the bread section is this way.

1586
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:21,900
Will they have sponge cake, though?

1587
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,009
Yes. Sponge cake.

1588
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:26,069
(Nobody predicted that fried sponge cake will be legendary.)

1589
00:56:26,070 --> 00:56:28,480
I got one sponge cake that Jae Seok wanted.

1590
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,350
This is going to be good.

1591
00:56:35,550 --> 00:56:37,950
We're all looking forward to different things.

1592
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:39,966
Haewon, what are you curious about the most?

1593
00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:42,990
I think the marinated pork ribs will be good, so I want to try that.

1594
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:45,859
Strawberries for me. That's what I'm the most curious about.

1595
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:46,930
- The strawberries.
- Yes.

1596
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:49,659
- It's the sponge cake for me.
- The sponge cake.

1597
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:50,660
(Childish Yu is only focused on the sponge cake.)

1598
00:56:50,661 --> 00:56:53,269
I think the sponge cake will be similar to fried soboro bread.

1599
00:56:53,270 --> 00:56:54,840
It might.

1600
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:56,599
- That sounds likely.
- The one from that famous bakery.

1601
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:57,939
- Yes.
- The one in Daejeon.

1602
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:00,009
Yes. I think that's what it would taste like.

1603
00:57:00,010 --> 00:57:01,010
I don't think so.

1604
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:03,980
I'm just saying.

1605
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:06,950
(Laughing)

1606
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:09,450
(The youngest member is bold.)

1607
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:12,720
You did well. Don't let him win!

1608
00:57:12,990 --> 00:57:14,089
(Haewon is on the ball.)

1609
00:57:14,090 --> 00:57:16,520
Jae Seok, don't let the Gen Z win!

1610
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:19,160
Don't let her win!

1611
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:21,200
Why do you have that sassy look on your face?

1612
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:24,670
- He looks so sassy.
- You remind me of my uncle's wife.

1613
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,670
You remind me of my uncle's wife.

1614
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:30,369
(It's even funnier because they all get what she means.)

1615
00:57:30,370 --> 00:57:32,809
- Her uncle's wife.
- The vibe you're giving off.

1616
00:57:32,810 --> 00:57:35,280
- My uncle's wife.
- I've never met your uncle's wife.

1617
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:38,609
- Not even her aunt.
- I've never met your uncle's wife.

1618
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:39,679
Someone not as close.

1619
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,880
(They added "Uncle's Wife" to his nickname collection.)

1620
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:45,320
We put these screens here...

1621
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:47,150
to film.

1622
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:48,359
(The screens were put up to protect civilian portrait rights...)

1623
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:49,736
(and to allow them to freely walk around the store.)

1624
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,429
But they keep opening.

1625
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:52,430
(He's dying of laughter.)

1626
00:57:53,090 --> 00:57:54,130
People...

1627
00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:55,559
(Wide open)

1628
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:56,800
People keep taking peeks at us.

1629
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:58,799
As they walk past, they keep...

1630
00:57:58,800 --> 00:57:59,976
(Slightly opening the screens)

1631
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,070
They keep doing this.

1632
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:03,799
- They keep opening the screens.
- They keep doing this.

1633
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:06,809
(Peekaboo)

1634
00:58:06,810 --> 00:58:07,880
They want to see us.

1635
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,450
I was in the restroom earlier, and I heard...

1636
00:58:11,610 --> 00:58:13,609
middle-aged women asking each other, "Did you see?"

1637
00:58:13,610 --> 00:58:15,050
One woman said, "I saw Yu Jae Seok."

1638
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:18,249
"Goodness, he's so skinny."

1639
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:19,289
(She was telling the others that she saw Yu Jae Seok.)

1640
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:20,320
(Laughing)

1641
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:22,920
Someone asked her, "Really? Is he handsome?"

1642
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:24,600
And the woman just washed her hands.

1643
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:26,429
(Laughing)

1644
00:58:26,430 --> 00:58:28,399
Without responding.

1645
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:29,636
(The woman just washed her hands without saying anything.)

1646
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:30,730
(Gosh)

1647
00:58:30,930 --> 00:58:32,430
She should have told them.

1648
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:34,099
Her answer would have made the conversation perfect.

1649
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:36,400
The screens keep opening is so funny to me.

1650
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,510
People keep opening them,

1651
00:58:39,070 --> 00:58:40,739
while the staff keep closing them.

1652
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:42,909
- They keep opening and closing.
- And then,

1653
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:44,590
- Opening and closing.
- over the screens,

1654
00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:46,380
people keep filming with their phones.

1655
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:48,549
(It's Yu Jae Seok!)

1656
00:58:48,550 --> 00:58:49,980
I keep seeing phones.

1657
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:51,319
It's like a whack-a-mole game.

1658
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,089
- Phones keep moving up and down.
- Phones keep moving up and down.

1659
00:58:53,090 --> 00:58:54,489
Like a periscope.

1660
00:58:54,490 --> 00:58:56,519
(People are moving their phones like periscopes.)

1661
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:58,559
- That's funny.
- This is funny.

1662
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:01,130
(People are watching the Sixth Sense members in secret.)

1663
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:04,469
It's like they're spears and the staff are shields.

1664
00:59:04,470 --> 00:59:05,910
I keep making eye contact with them.

1665
00:59:06,670 --> 00:59:07,740
Gosh, the food is ready.

1666
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:12,710
(It looks amazing.)

1667
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:15,710
- It looks great.
- It looks great.

1668
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:18,150
The owner looks so proud.

1669
00:59:18,510 --> 00:59:20,550
(Proud)

1670
00:59:20,810 --> 00:59:22,920
(This is so cool.)

1671
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:24,820
Look at all this.

1672
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:27,190
(Mouth open wide)

1673
00:59:27,450 --> 00:59:29,189
- Are these the fried ice cream?
- The ice cream.

1674
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:30,559
Yes, these are the fried ice cream.

1675
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:32,730
- Do you want me to point them out?
- Yes, please.

1676
00:59:32,830 --> 00:59:34,060
These are the strawberries.

1677
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,259
The fried strawberries.

1678
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:37,600
(Fried strawberries)

1679
00:59:38,130 --> 00:59:39,999
- And then these are the ice cream.
- The ice cream.

1680
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,540
(Fried ice cream)

1681
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:43,269
These are the fried Choco Pies.

1682
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:44,740
(Fried Choco Pies)

1683
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:46,609
This is the sponge cake.

1684
00:59:46,610 --> 00:59:48,140
(Fried sponge cake)

1685
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:51,509
- They're perfectly golden.
- Right.

1686
00:59:51,510 --> 00:59:52,579
Right. They're so cool.

1687
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:55,049
We'll have to taste them to know if he's real.

1688
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:56,826
(Could this place that fries anything be real?)

1689
00:59:56,850 --> 00:59:57,949
Let's have the ice cream...

1690
00:59:57,950 --> 00:59:59,090
- before it melts.
- Yes.

1691
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:01,989
- You can eat an entire one, Mimi.
- This is amazing.

1692
01:00:01,990 --> 01:00:04,306
- I'll eat an entire one.
- The rest of us only want bites.

1693
01:00:04,330 --> 01:00:05,630
(Cold ice cream...)

1694
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:09,300
(meets hot deep fryer.)

1695
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:12,700
(The ultrasonic waves made this happen.)

1696
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:16,040
(What will the fried ice cream taste like?)

1697
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:18,009
- Is the ice cream still frozen?
- Yes.

1698
01:00:18,010 --> 01:00:19,439
- It's hard.
- It didn't melt.

1699
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,139
- What?
- You eat that.

1700
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:23,580
- It's hard.
- Wait. It's cold.

1701
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:26,480
- Really?
- The outside is warm, the inside...

1702
01:00:26,850 --> 01:00:27,920
How is this cold?

1703
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:30,019
It's not melting. It's staying frozen.

1704
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:31,519
- It's hard.
- Let's let Mimi have one.

1705
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:33,520
(It's warm on the outside and cold on the inside.)

1706
01:00:33,690 --> 01:00:36,690
(Haewon takes a bite of fried ice cream.)

1707
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:39,306
(The sweet treat expert takes a bite too.)

1708
01:00:39,330 --> 01:00:40,360
(Yum)

1709
01:00:41,130 --> 01:00:42,830
- This is good.
- It is?

1710
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:45,930
- They taste like cream puffs.
- Cream puffs.

1711
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:49,970
Ice cream is still good even when it's fried.

1712
01:00:50,770 --> 01:00:52,509
I'll try the fried Oh Yes!

1713
01:00:52,510 --> 01:00:53,716
Right, the chocolate-coated cake.

1714
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:55,479
(The chocolate snacks are covered in the batter for frying.)

1715
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:57,080
Is this chocolate-coated cake too?

1716
01:00:57,380 --> 01:00:59,910
(How will it taste?)

1717
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:01,220
How is the Choco Pie?

1718
01:01:02,350 --> 01:01:04,549
It's good. Yes.

1719
01:01:04,550 --> 01:01:06,619
- You'll either love it or hate it.
- Really?

1720
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:08,889
The edge of it has become chewy.

1721
01:01:08,890 --> 01:01:10,419
It has become sticky.

1722
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:12,529
(The fritter is chewy?)

1723
01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:14,429
(The chocolate snack...)

1724
01:01:14,430 --> 01:01:16,529
(as well as the ice cream before)

1725
01:01:16,530 --> 01:01:20,070
(Why haven't they melted when they were fried in hot oil?)

1726
01:01:20,770 --> 01:01:23,069
(The secret is in the rice paper.)

1727
01:01:23,070 --> 01:01:27,610
For fried ice cream, I use rice paper to fry it.

1728
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,539
(When it's coated with the frying mix after that, )

1729
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:33,410
(it doesn't melt or lose its shape tremendously.)

1730
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:36,580
(It's fried in a pretty way.)

1731
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:39,050
- Hey. It's all right.
- Yes.

1732
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:42,790
(By the way, one person is very quiet.)

1733
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:44,889
(Biting)

1734
01:01:44,890 --> 01:01:47,590
(He takes a bite of the fried strawberry carefully.)

1735
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:50,130
(Looking around)

1736
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:51,999
The bread is a bit...

1737
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,199
You're right. Try the eggplant.

1738
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:54,569
As for the fried watermelon,

1739
01:01:54,570 --> 01:01:56,839
- its inside has melted.
- I see.

1740
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:58,510
I can't eat this.

1741
01:01:59,010 --> 01:02:00,039
I had a bite,

1742
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:01,840
- but the strawberry is...
- Is it bad?

1743
01:02:01,910 --> 01:02:04,550
(Actually, Hwasa...)

1744
01:02:05,610 --> 01:02:10,420
(wanted to try the fried strawberry the most.)

1745
01:02:11,790 --> 01:02:13,619
- It's freshly out of the oil.
- I wanted to try...

1746
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:16,420
(How will it taste?)

1747
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:19,220
- Gosh. This...
- It's melt inside a little.

1748
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:21,159
It tastes like strawberry bread.

1749
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:22,476
- Strawberry bread?
- Strawberry bread.

1750
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,229
(The strawberry juice explodes.)

1751
01:02:24,230 --> 01:02:25,499
(According to Hwasa, it's like strawberry bread...)

1752
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:27,180
(that is crunchy outside and soft inside.)

1753
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:29,900
(Hwasa loves the fried strawberry.)

1754
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:33,339
- Is it okay?
- I like it very much.

1755
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:34,340
- Really?
- Yes.

1756
01:02:34,341 --> 01:02:35,509
- Is it good?
- Yes.

1757
01:02:35,510 --> 01:02:38,150
Right? But it's... Gosh.

1758
01:02:38,910 --> 01:02:41,620
- Everyone's palate is different.
- Gosh.

1759
01:02:41,950 --> 01:02:44,119
I don't understand the concept...

1760
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:46,420
- of eating heated fruit.
- Really?

1761
01:02:47,050 --> 01:02:49,159
(Kochelin Kyoung Pyo wonders why would one fry the fruits...)

1762
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:51,290
(and have them while they are warm deliberately.)

1763
01:02:51,490 --> 01:02:53,429
- I'll try the strawberry.
- Yes.

1764
01:02:53,430 --> 01:02:54,430
Try it.

1765
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:56,759
(The fried strawberry's preference is 50 to 50.)

1766
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:59,069
It's 50 to 50 for the strawberry.

1767
01:02:59,070 --> 01:03:00,999
- Hwasa liked it.
- Yes.

1768
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,639
It didn't suit my palate.

1769
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:03,640
How is it?

1770
01:03:04,070 --> 01:03:05,070
As for the strawberries,

1771
01:03:05,910 --> 01:03:07,440
we should eat them fresh.

1772
01:03:08,510 --> 01:03:09,839
(Determined)

1773
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:11,409
- Why would one...
- Why?

1774
01:03:11,410 --> 01:03:12,750
This is what it feels like.

1775
01:03:13,050 --> 01:03:14,479
I bought strawberries.

1776
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,749
I put them in the fridge but forgot about them.

1777
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:18,049
- I see.
- They became mushy.

1778
01:03:18,050 --> 01:03:19,919
"I have to eat them quickly." That's how it feels.

1779
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,359
- Because they are mushy.
- They are mushy.

1780
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:23,060
Then, I will try...

1781
01:03:23,390 --> 01:03:24,730
the one I craved.

1782
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:26,060
The sponge cake.

1783
01:03:26,190 --> 01:03:27,529
This sponge cake.

1784
01:03:27,530 --> 01:03:28,560
(Fried sponge cake)

1785
01:03:29,330 --> 01:03:30,959
(He even made an order remotely on his phone.)

1786
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,670
(His favorite fried sponge cake)

1787
01:03:33,370 --> 01:03:35,000
(To suit Childish Yu's palate, )

1788
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:37,640
(here comes the fried sponge cake.)

1789
01:03:38,470 --> 01:03:42,040
(The moist sponge cake...)

1790
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:47,509
(is fried until crispy.)

1791
01:03:47,510 --> 01:03:50,379
I think the sponge cake will be similar to fried soboro bread.

1792
01:03:50,380 --> 01:03:51,389
Right?

1793
01:03:51,390 --> 01:03:53,019
Okay. This is the sponge cake.

1794
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:55,859
(Excited)

1795
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:57,160
(How is it?)

1796
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:03,460
It's...

1797
01:04:07,070 --> 01:04:08,240
It doesn't taste good.

1798
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:10,069
(He is pouting without saying a word.)

1799
01:04:10,070 --> 01:04:11,140
It must be really bad.

1800
01:04:11,610 --> 01:04:13,340
(Cracking up)

1801
01:04:13,970 --> 01:04:15,710
(Choking)

1802
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:17,209
I know that look...

1803
01:04:17,210 --> 01:04:18,809
with the front teeth. I know it.

1804
01:04:18,810 --> 01:04:20,526
He described its taste with the look on his face.

1805
01:04:20,550 --> 01:04:22,680
Is it that bad?

1806
01:04:23,450 --> 01:04:24,620
(Is the sponge cake no good?)

1807
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:28,620
(You're right. It's no good.)

1808
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:30,390
It's bread soaked in oil.

1809
01:04:31,020 --> 01:04:32,030
- Really?
- Yes.

1810
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,460
(It has absorbed all oil.)

1811
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:37,600
(The oil is oozing out on its cross-section.)

1812
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:39,769
- Is it really bad?
- It's really bad.

1813
01:04:39,770 --> 01:04:41,076
(Childish Yu drove himself to a devastating end.)

1814
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:43,176
- Hand me the scissors, Kyoung Pyo.
- The ice cream is good.

1815
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,069
(They're even more curious about the fried sponge cake.)

1816
01:04:45,070 --> 01:04:46,070
Really?

1817
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:48,640
- How bad is it?
- Gosh.

1818
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:51,280
(Serious)

1819
01:04:52,110 --> 01:04:53,110
I told you.

1820
01:04:53,350 --> 01:04:55,719
(What did I tell you, my friend?)

1821
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:57,320
The fried sponge cake is really...

1822
01:04:58,220 --> 01:04:59,890
a bad choice.

1823
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:01,689
A bad choice.

1824
01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:03,760
It's really a bad choice.

1825
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:07,290
(They fry the ingredients that aren't guaranteed to be good.)

1826
01:05:07,390 --> 01:05:08,529
(Does this place exist for real?)

1827
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:09,860
We still have to try...

1828
01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:12,799
- galbi and a few others.
- Really?

1829
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,870
- That's right.
- We fried a lot of things.

1830
01:05:15,340 --> 01:05:18,539
(Don't worry. You can look forward to it this time.)

1831
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:20,239
(Have you only grilled the pork belly before?)

1832
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:22,116
(Have you only grilled the marinated galbi before?)

1833
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:23,679
(Remember this from now on.)

1834
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:27,080
(Meat tastes better when it's fried.)

1835
01:05:27,350 --> 01:05:28,420
It's coming.

1836
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:31,290
This time, it's fried meat.

1837
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:33,389
- That looks good.
- That...

1838
01:05:33,390 --> 01:05:34,419
That looks good.

1839
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:35,420
This makes sense.

1840
01:05:35,421 --> 01:05:38,629
The pork galbi is coated with breadcrumbs.

1841
01:05:38,630 --> 01:05:39,790
That one is pork belly.

1842
01:05:39,930 --> 01:05:41,259
(Drooling)

1843
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:42,330
Where are the scissors?

1844
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:43,929
- They are coming.
- Thank you.

1845
01:05:43,930 --> 01:05:45,799
- Isn't it the same as before?
- It's just the frying mix.

1846
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,130
This is...

1847
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:49,369
Is this your first time shooting?

1848
01:05:49,370 --> 01:05:51,100
You can't block the camera.

1849
01:05:51,610 --> 01:05:52,610
(Existing everywhere)

1850
01:05:52,611 --> 01:05:54,839
- Pardon?
- I'm learning a lot from you.

1851
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:56,980
- Are you?
- Like it's okay to do that.

1852
01:05:57,510 --> 01:05:59,909
No. It's not okay to block it like that.

1853
01:05:59,910 --> 01:06:01,349
- If you want to do it, - To do so, you have to...

1854
01:06:01,350 --> 01:06:02,679
- win the Grand Award 20 times.
- Exactly.

1855
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:03,849
(You can do it when you win the Grand Award 20 times.)

1856
01:06:03,850 --> 01:06:05,850
- Stop mentioning it.
- You can do it.

1857
01:06:06,050 --> 01:06:07,749
- Should we try them?
- Yes.

1858
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:08,889
(The first batch of fried meat cut by Yu, the Grand Award winner)

1859
01:06:08,890 --> 01:06:10,419
- This is the pork belly.
- Okay.

1860
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:11,859
Gosh. I think it'll be tasty.

1861
01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:13,689
- Try it with the sauce.
- You have to dip it in the sauce.

1862
01:06:13,690 --> 01:06:14,759
Thank you.

1863
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:15,836
(Dipping it in the special sauce with tangy mustard)

1864
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:17,830
Won't fried pork belly be greasy?

1865
01:06:18,630 --> 01:06:20,329
(Interesting)

1866
01:06:20,330 --> 01:06:22,840
It's tasty when you dip it in the mustard sauce.

1867
01:06:25,870 --> 01:06:27,910
- The fried pork belly is great.
- Gosh. This is...

1868
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:29,439
- It's so good.
- It's good.

1869
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:31,349
When the oil is hot,

1870
01:06:31,350 --> 01:06:32,749
the batter doesn't absorb it.

1871
01:06:32,750 --> 01:06:34,849
- You're right.
- The batter blocks the oil.

1872
01:06:34,850 --> 01:06:37,980
- It's perfectly cooked.
- Here.

1873
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:40,589
The fatty part is very chewy.

1874
01:06:40,590 --> 01:06:41,590
- It's just right.
- It's just right.

1875
01:06:41,591 --> 01:06:44,290
(The chewy fatty part inside the batter is exquisite!)

1876
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:45,529
Let's try it.

1877
01:06:45,530 --> 01:06:47,370
(Finally, they try the fried marinated galbi.)

1878
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:51,630
(This is it!)

1879
01:06:51,970 --> 01:06:53,706
Please put it there because it's far from them.

1880
01:06:53,730 --> 01:06:54,870
It's good.

1881
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:56,040
It's good.

1882
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:58,409
The marinated galbi is good.

1883
01:06:58,410 --> 01:06:59,509
The breadcrumbs are good.

1884
01:06:59,510 --> 01:07:01,739
Of the things I've fried,

1885
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:05,050
the marinated galbi tasted great.

1886
01:07:05,650 --> 01:07:09,680
(Highlight it. For marinated galbi, you have to use the breadcrumbs.)

1887
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:15,189
- The color of it is even.
- Yes.

1888
01:07:15,190 --> 01:07:16,359
It's like the pork cutlet.

1889
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:17,959
(It feels like they're eating pork cutlet.)

1890
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:18,960
It's really good.

1891
01:07:18,961 --> 01:07:20,189
(It feels like they're eating pork cutlet.)

1892
01:07:20,190 --> 01:07:23,060
- The marinated galbi is amazing.
- Thank you.

1893
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:24,559
The marinated galbi is good.

1894
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:26,669
It tastes like a totally different kind.

1895
01:07:26,670 --> 01:07:27,670
You're right.

1896
01:07:27,830 --> 01:07:29,199
I thought it wouldn't taste like this...

1897
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:30,999
- because it was marinated.
- The marinated galbi is tasty.

1898
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,840
- It's tasty.
- I like it.

1899
01:07:33,910 --> 01:07:35,510
It's tasty.

1900
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:38,149
The meat tastes good...

1901
01:07:38,150 --> 01:07:39,249
- when it's fried.
- Yes.

1902
01:07:39,250 --> 01:07:40,579
I think it makes sense...

1903
01:07:40,580 --> 01:07:41,879
when we fry squid.

1904
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:43,619
- It must be tasty, right?
- It's tasty.

1905
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:45,219
If we ask them to fry fish meat,

1906
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:47,489
- it'll be all right.
- Yes. It'll be all right.

1907
01:07:47,490 --> 01:07:49,260
- How was that one?
- Which one?

1908
01:07:49,490 --> 01:07:51,220
- The sponge cake.
- It was the worst.

1909
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:55,029
- The look on your face was funny.
- His front teeth said everything.

1910
01:07:55,030 --> 01:07:57,330
- He swore with his eyes.
- It was oil bread.

1911
01:07:57,630 --> 01:07:59,769
- Well, I saw him up close.
- It was oil bread.

1912
01:07:59,770 --> 01:08:01,899
He even choked once.

1913
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:02,900
- Gosh.
- Also...

1914
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:04,810
(Choking)

1915
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:07,210
I know that look with the front teeth.

1916
01:08:07,410 --> 01:08:09,039
- I couldn't eat it.
- As he chewed it,

1917
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:10,879
- he gagged. Gosh.
- Yes.

1918
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:12,249
Gosh. This is problematic.

1919
01:08:12,250 --> 01:08:14,149
For the staff, this is a place...

1920
01:08:14,150 --> 01:08:15,349
- that's easy to fabricate.
- Yes.

1921
01:08:15,350 --> 01:08:17,419
Their concept is "Anything."

1922
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:19,949
- It's their original menu.
- Yes.

1923
01:08:19,950 --> 01:08:21,860
But wouldn't the staff set it up...

1924
01:08:22,290 --> 01:08:23,719
as if it's fried food omakase?

1925
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:25,259
- When it's a normal fritter place.
- It's possible.

1926
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:27,429
They actually have...

1927
01:08:27,430 --> 01:08:29,470
- the ghost crab chicken.
- That's the actual menu.

1928
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:31,729
I think they made this part up.

1929
01:08:31,730 --> 01:08:32,730
That's right.

1930
01:08:32,731 --> 01:08:34,129
(Is it an actual fritter place...)

1931
01:08:34,130 --> 01:08:35,676
(but with a fake concept of "frying anything"?)

1932
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:39,909
At this place, the fritters fried with ultrasound...

1933
01:08:39,910 --> 01:08:42,540
- are the main dish. So, - Yes.

1934
01:08:42,940 --> 01:08:46,849
Their intention to fry anything sound plausible.

1935
01:08:46,850 --> 01:08:49,019
That they'll fry the ingredients they bought from the store.

1936
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:50,879
That whole situation makes sense.

1937
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,919
The flow makes sense.

1938
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:54,819
- Right. It's after the checkout.
- Right.

1939
01:08:54,820 --> 01:08:56,319
- It's perfect.
- Yes.

1940
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:58,266
(Is the spot where they fry anything you bought in the store real?)

1941
01:08:58,290 --> 01:09:00,290
- You can bring the ingredients.
- It makes sense.

1942
01:09:00,890 --> 01:09:03,129
It's in the logical location too.

1943
01:09:03,130 --> 01:09:04,459
This is hard.

1944
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:06,346
(Fry Anything: Can be easily made, The concept might be fake)

1945
01:09:06,370 --> 01:09:07,499
(Anything P, Anything F)

1946
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:10,799
(Anything NT)

1947
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:13,140
(They leave for the third place, Anything NT.)

1948
01:09:13,470 --> 01:09:15,409
I think it was a real place.

1949
01:09:15,410 --> 01:09:16,909
- I think it's real too.
- Really?

1950
01:09:16,910 --> 01:09:18,280
Both of them felt fake to me.

1951
01:09:19,610 --> 01:09:21,450
It's really hard.

1952
01:09:21,650 --> 01:09:23,619
Today's food combination is very heavy.

1953
01:09:23,620 --> 01:09:25,549
- We only had two meals.
- You're right.

1954
01:09:25,550 --> 01:09:26,790
(Heavy)

1955
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:29,560
- It was oil after oil.
- Right.

1956
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:32,030
- Gosh.
- Nice. Iced Americano.

1957
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:33,360
Sexy.

1958
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:35,860
- Sexy.
- Sexy.

1959
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:37,660
I saw that one with "Sexy food."

1960
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:40,529
That's right. Gosh. Sexy food.

1961
01:09:40,530 --> 01:09:41,540
What's that?

1962
01:09:41,870 --> 01:09:43,199
Is that another catchphrase?

1963
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:44,400
(That's right.)

1964
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:46,310
It's a catchphrase among the Gen MZ.

1965
01:09:47,370 --> 01:09:51,280
(Haewon introduced the Gen MZ word, "Sexy food.")

1966
01:09:53,110 --> 01:09:54,180
(It's free for you.)

1967
01:09:54,580 --> 01:09:56,019
(She's a symbol of Gen MZ, indeed.)

1968
01:09:56,020 --> 01:09:59,819
- By the way, your eyes are so big.
- Are you wearing contact lenses?

1969
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:01,820
Her eyeballs are big already.

1970
01:10:02,420 --> 01:10:04,360
Thank you. My eyeballs are big.

1971
01:10:04,790 --> 01:10:06,260
I envy your big eyeballs.

1972
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:08,160
I'm jealous.

1973
01:10:08,161 --> 01:10:09,929
- What about the eye shape?
- Your depuffed eyes look good.

1974
01:10:09,930 --> 01:10:12,330
- I know.
- Even when they aren't puffy,

1975
01:10:13,570 --> 01:10:15,039
- they are small.
- My friend's eyes are...

1976
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:17,269
- When I look at them...
- They are small in size.

1977
01:10:17,270 --> 01:10:18,739
- Actually, as for Jae Seok, - That's not true.

1978
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:20,369
- he looks okay overall.
- Right.

1979
01:10:20,370 --> 01:10:22,140
But each part looks so unattractive.

1980
01:10:22,710 --> 01:10:24,709
- That's not true.
- Especially his eyes.

1981
01:10:24,710 --> 01:10:26,709
- His nose is all right.
- Gosh.

1982
01:10:26,710 --> 01:10:28,179
- They are true friends.
- They are really close.

1983
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:29,419
I'm not even shocked.

1984
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:31,319
I've heard this...

1985
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:33,590
- since long ago.
- The eyes over the glasses...

1986
01:10:33,820 --> 01:10:35,389
look so unattractive.

1987
01:10:35,390 --> 01:10:36,789
(Sipping)

1988
01:10:36,790 --> 01:10:38,730
As a friend,

1989
01:10:39,090 --> 01:10:40,429
I thought she'd defend him.

1990
01:10:40,430 --> 01:10:41,559
Gosh. There's no such thing.

1991
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:43,260
Right. What's the point of defending him?

1992
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:45,470
That is the true friendship.

1993
01:10:45,770 --> 01:10:46,970
"That is the true friendship."

1994
01:10:47,230 --> 01:10:48,230
(Laughing)

1995
01:10:48,770 --> 01:10:49,770
(Resigned)

1996
01:10:49,771 --> 01:10:51,669
Mimi will gradually speak less.

1997
01:10:51,670 --> 01:10:54,209
- She'll be less talkative.
- I'll try to close my words.

1998
01:10:54,210 --> 01:10:57,109
She'll try to "close her words."

1999
01:10:57,110 --> 01:10:58,110
"That's the true friendship."

2000
01:10:58,110 --> 01:10:59,110
(Her words have a lingering impression.)

2001
01:10:59,111 --> 01:11:00,649
(That's who she is.)

2002
01:11:00,650 --> 01:11:01,680
She's cute.

2003
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:04,520
- Haewon, you've never dated before.
- No.

2004
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:07,819
It sounded suspicious because you answered so quickly.

2005
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:09,959
- She hasn't dated anyone.
- That's what we say.

2006
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:11,319
(Haewon, you've never dated anyone, right?)

2007
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:13,759
(I really haven't dated once.)

2008
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:18,970
(Haewon's no-boyfriend-since-birth is quite well known.)

2009
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:22,000
- She hasn't dated anyone.
- That's what we say.

2010
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:23,969
But I've never had a boyfriend.

2011
01:11:23,970 --> 01:11:25,050
(I don't have a boyfriend.)

2012
01:11:25,810 --> 01:11:26,870
Who are you talking to?

2013
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:28,609
To the camera.

2014
01:11:28,610 --> 01:11:30,140
(Embarrassed)

2015
01:11:30,340 --> 01:11:32,879
If you can't date anyone until you're 30,

2016
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:34,380
you can be on "I am Solo."

2017
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:36,880
(That's perfect.)

2018
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:39,249
It must be fun to be on that show.

2019
01:11:39,250 --> 01:11:40,390
- Right?
- Yes.

2020
01:11:40,690 --> 01:11:42,220
We can all be on the show.

2021
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:48,029
("I am Solo" in Sixth Sense: City Tour)

2022
01:11:48,030 --> 01:11:51,300
(To find love, 6 blunt members have come to the solo land.)

2023
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:54,430
Which character will I be?

2024
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:56,239
(Let me see.)

2025
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:57,899
- You're Ok Soon.
- Ok Soon.

2026
01:11:57,900 --> 01:11:59,069
- You're Ok Soon.
- Ok Soon?

2027
01:11:59,070 --> 01:12:00,769
Isn't she the pretty one?

2028
01:12:00,770 --> 01:12:02,109
Gosh.

2029
01:12:02,110 --> 01:12:03,780
(The Gen MZ's beauty, Ok Soon, Haewon)

2030
01:12:04,110 --> 01:12:07,150
Usually, Ok Soons are pretty but a bit eccentric.

2031
01:12:07,910 --> 01:12:10,519
Gosh. I don't have the confidence to be on such shows.

2032
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:12,589
On the show, you...

2033
01:12:12,590 --> 01:12:14,389
- For some reason.
- You have to express your feelings.

2034
01:12:14,390 --> 01:12:17,290
- Yes.
- I'm not that type of a person.

2035
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:19,529
You'll show off your talent.

2036
01:12:19,530 --> 01:12:20,959
(He will show off his talent when he introduces himself.)

2037
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:22,030
I hate it.

2038
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:24,559
(The one who's serious about showing off talents)

2039
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:26,070
(Young Sik, Jae Seok)

2040
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:28,400
"I'm going to sing a song."

2041
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:30,539
How did you know?

2042
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:31,839
(How did you know?)

2043
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:33,409
- Jae Seok in the past...
- Yes.

2044
01:12:33,410 --> 01:12:36,480
Would do that out of urgency.

2045
01:12:36,710 --> 01:12:37,710
I'd do something irrational.

2046
01:12:37,711 --> 01:12:39,009
When there's someone he likes,

2047
01:12:39,010 --> 01:12:40,409
he'll say, "Do you have a minute?"

2048
01:12:40,410 --> 01:12:42,619
"Can you come out?" He'd ask her to step out.

2049
01:12:42,620 --> 01:12:44,449
- He'll do something.
- It'll be a mess.

2050
01:12:44,450 --> 01:12:45,989
- It'll be a mess.
- A mess.

2051
01:12:45,990 --> 01:12:47,719
He'll dance as if he's in a club near the bonfire.

2052
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:49,019
Right.

2053
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:51,460
I'm the type people say, "What's wrong with him?" in the end.

2054
01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:53,460
(Yu Young Sik, 27 years old)

2055
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:55,759
Out of urgency.

2056
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:57,076
(Doing irrational things out of urgency)

2057
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:58,259
I'd have no presence in the show,

2058
01:12:58,260 --> 01:12:59,429
but in the end, people will go, "What's wrong with him?"

2059
01:12:59,430 --> 01:13:01,329
You'll be the most popular one at the end.

2060
01:13:01,330 --> 01:13:02,339
"What's wrong with him?"

2061
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:05,040
"Why is he going crazy all of a sudden?"

2062
01:13:05,210 --> 01:13:06,310
That's right.

2063
01:13:06,870 --> 01:13:08,939
- When you're running out of time.
- There's no time left.

2064
01:13:08,940 --> 01:13:11,780
- "I have to do something." - "I've done nothing so far."

2065
01:13:12,050 --> 01:13:13,780
"Everything seems settled already."

2066
01:13:14,210 --> 01:13:16,749
- The couples are already formed.
- "They're all couples now."

2067
01:13:16,750 --> 01:13:17,779
(Laughing)

2068
01:13:17,780 --> 01:13:19,219
The writers and producers would say,

2069
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:22,019
"Jae Seok, you should do something, shouldn't you?"

2070
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:24,689
So you do something, but it just backfires.

2071
01:13:24,690 --> 01:13:25,729
I know what it is.

2072
01:13:25,730 --> 01:13:26,959
(A total backfire)

2073
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:29,229
I can totally see what you're talking about.

2074
01:13:29,230 --> 01:13:31,129
- You know how I'd be, right?
- Yes. Totally.

2075
01:13:31,130 --> 01:13:32,269
Gosh.

2076
01:13:32,270 --> 01:13:33,406
(The final decision is clear.)

2077
01:13:33,430 --> 01:13:34,500
My stomach hurts.

2078
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:38,070
- Gosh. That was fun.
- That was hilarious.

2079
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:40,369
- We're here.
- What is this?

2080
01:13:40,370 --> 01:13:41,439
What is this place? What?

2081
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:42,440
(Samseong-dong)

2082
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:43,640
What is this?

2083
01:13:43,910 --> 01:13:45,610
- "Street food?" - Yes.

2084
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:47,910
- It's a bar.
- Yes.

2085
01:13:48,820 --> 01:13:49,879
(Is it a pub?)

2086
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:51,679
We're going to the snack bar, not the pub.

2087
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:54,020
- What?
- Is there a snack bar?

2088
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:56,389
Is this "Anything you want" again?

2089
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:58,690
(Is it "Any ramyeon you want" again?)

2090
01:13:58,930 --> 01:14:00,259
Customized ramyeon?

2091
01:14:00,260 --> 01:14:01,289
(Customized ramyeon?)

2092
01:14:01,290 --> 01:14:02,859
- It said "NT." - NT.

2093
01:14:02,860 --> 01:14:04,230
- It says, "NT." - "NT?"

2094
01:14:04,730 --> 01:14:07,199
Does tteokbokki start with a T?

2095
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:08,306
(Does the T stand for tteokbokki?)

2096
01:14:08,330 --> 01:14:09,770
It's "Anything" again.

2097
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,839
For goodness' sake.

2098
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:14,309
- Today's keyword is "Anything." - Come on.

2099
01:14:14,310 --> 01:14:15,539
It's all about doing anything today.

2100
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:17,979
Hwasa eats normal food well, but...

2101
01:14:17,980 --> 01:14:19,080
Come on.

2102
01:14:19,410 --> 01:14:21,750
- Come here.
- I want to have ready-made food.

2103
01:14:22,820 --> 01:14:24,349
- What is this?
- What?

2104
01:14:24,350 --> 01:14:25,926
(Which customizable menu will there be this time?)

2105
01:14:25,950 --> 01:14:28,289
It says "Pub,"

2106
01:14:28,290 --> 01:14:30,136
but how can there be a snack bar all of a sudden?

2107
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:31,519
I can smell ramyeon.

2108
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:32,959
- I see.
- I can smell the street food.

2109
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:34,629
- This is...
- Is it a pub?

2110
01:14:34,630 --> 01:14:36,060
I think this place is real.

2111
01:14:36,660 --> 01:14:37,999
I have a feeling that this place is real.

2112
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,069
Hello.

2113
01:14:39,070 --> 01:14:40,499
- I can smell ramyeon.
- Hello.

2114
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:41,899
- Hello.
- Hello.

2115
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:42,969
- Hello.
- Gosh. I smell ramyeon.

2116
01:14:42,970 --> 01:14:44,210
- Hello.
- Look at the ramyeon.

2117
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:45,910
- Gosh.
- It's an exhibition.

2118
01:14:46,610 --> 01:14:47,969
(An exhibition-like snack bar?)

2119
01:14:47,970 --> 01:14:49,639
- What is this?
- Hello.

2120
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:52,279
Gosh. I love this place.

2121
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:53,656
(It looks like a normal snack bar, )

2122
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:54,749
(but its decor doesn't look normal.)

2123
01:14:54,750 --> 01:14:56,779
This place has to be real.

2124
01:14:56,780 --> 01:14:58,420
- This is real.
- This is a real place.

2125

(The chronicle of ramyeon)

2126
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:03,219
(In fact, the place is dominated...)

2127
01:15:03,220 --> 01:15:04,259
It's real.

2128
01:15:04,260 --> 01:15:06,929
(by ramyeon characters.)

2129
01:15:06,930 --> 01:15:08,330
(My Own Ramyeon)

2130
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:11,999
(They sell 46 kinds of ramyeon.)

2131
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,669
This place looks like a real one.

2132
01:15:13,670 --> 01:15:16,140
(It's everything ramyeon.)

2133
01:15:16,370 --> 01:15:19,570
(What is this place?)

2134
01:15:20,210 --> 01:15:22,539
- I think it's real.
- Sir, this place is real, right?

2135
01:15:22,540 --> 01:15:23,940
Yes, of course.

2136
01:15:24,310 --> 01:15:25,779
When did you start running the place?

2137
01:15:25,780 --> 01:15:28,079
We opened last November.

2138
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:29,919
- Last November?
- This is a snack bar that sells...

2139
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:32,189
tteokbokki on the table, sundae, and ramyeon.

2140
01:15:32,190 --> 01:15:34,596
- Tteokbokki, ramyeon, and sundae.
- Tteokbooki, fries, and sundae.

2141
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:36,459
There's Uijeongbu army stew ramyeon.

2142
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:38,660
- Great. I wanted it so badly.
- Seoul-style bulgogi...

2143
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:41,230
Yes. Uijeongbu army stew ramyeon is right there.

2144
01:15:41,330 --> 01:15:43,559
There's pork gukbap ramyeon too.

2145
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:45,370
- There's bulgogi ramyeon.
- Yes.

2146
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:48,130
(Amazed)

2147
01:15:48,270 --> 01:15:50,869
Of everything we had today, this is my type.

2148
01:15:50,870 --> 01:15:52,769
- You're excited.
- Yes. This is really...

2149
01:15:52,770 --> 01:15:55,380
- You're thrilled.
- It's ramyeon.

2150
01:15:55,980 --> 01:15:58,650
- Ramyeon.
- I love it.

2151
01:15:59,250 --> 01:16:01,009
What can we customize here?

2152
01:16:01,010 --> 01:16:02,619
- Gosh.
- Do we...

2153
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:04,980
customize ramyeon here?

2154
01:16:05,050 --> 01:16:06,119
(The third place, Anything NT)

2155
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:08,760
Gosh. They meant the toppings.

2156
01:16:08,990 --> 01:16:10,759
When you go to a normal snack bar,

2157
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:13,159
you have to have ramyeon the owner chooses to make.

2158
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:15,429
If customers can choose the ingredients,

2159
01:16:15,430 --> 01:16:18,329
it will be more unique.

2160
01:16:18,330 --> 01:16:19,830
They can enjoy it more too.

(Introducing My Own Ramyeon)

2162
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:24,739
(There are even 16 toppings!)

2163
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:28,009
Of 16 toppings, one can choose 5.

2164
01:16:28,010 --> 01:16:29,409
We make cup ramyeon with them.

2165
01:16:29,410 --> 01:16:31,509
(In addition to various toppings...)

2166
01:16:31,510 --> 01:16:32,849
You can choose the seasoning too.

2167
01:16:32,850 --> 01:16:34,609
(Spicy, shrimp, beef bone soup, Neoguri)

2168
01:16:34,610 --> 01:16:36,119
(There are 4 kinds of seasonings.)

2169
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:37,649
(Thick noodles, thin noodles)

2170
01:16:37,650 --> 01:16:39,050
(There are two types of noodles.)

2171
01:16:39,290 --> 01:16:41,719
You can choose thick or thin noodles with shrimp seasoning.

2172
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:43,960
It's a new combination.

2173
01:16:44,260 --> 01:16:46,289
It's about thinking differently.

2174
01:16:46,290 --> 01:16:47,666
(The one-and-only flavor in the world)

2175

(With a special sealing machine)

2176
01:16:48,730 --> 01:16:50,500
I place it in a special sealing machine...

2177
01:16:50,700 --> 01:16:52,200
to seal it.

2178
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:54,629
Then one can print out...

2179
01:16:54,630 --> 01:16:56,000
a photo they like as a seal,

2180
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:57,699
stick it on the ramyeon cup,

2181
01:16:57,700 --> 01:17:00,209
and draw and decorate the package.

2182
01:17:00,210 --> 01:17:03,709
It's a special place to make ramyeon of one's own.

2183
01:17:03,710 --> 01:17:06,950
(Hundreds of ramyeon has been created so far.)

01:17:06,980 --> 01:17:08,049
(I can make ramyeon of my own here?)

2185
01:17:08,050 --> 01:17:11,779
(From a major influencer with 600,000 viewers...)

2187
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:14,849

(Choosing a photo was fun.)

2190
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:19,529
Couples come here the most.

2191
01:17:19,530 --> 01:17:21,429
Parents also bring their kids.

2192
01:17:21,430 --> 01:17:23,929
They draw passionately to have ramyeon of their own.

2193
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:26,629
First, we sold about ten ramyeon.

2194
01:17:26,630 --> 01:17:28,069
As it went viral,

2195
01:17:28,070 --> 01:17:30,400
we're selling out all 100 ramyeon a day.

2196
01:17:30,670 --> 01:17:33,440
Sixth Sense members, is this place real?

2197
01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:37,739
You can make ramyeon of your own.

2198
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:39,449
Goodness.

2199
01:17:39,450 --> 01:17:40,510
That's cute.

2200
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:42,379
"If we're together ramyeon."

2201
01:17:42,380 --> 01:17:44,220
- "The ramyeon I'll have." - That's right.

2202
01:17:44,550 --> 01:17:45,919
I love it.

2203
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:47,389
"If I'm KARINA ramyeon."

2204
01:17:47,390 --> 01:17:48,550

It's crazy.

2207
01:17:51,390 --> 01:17:52,560
What a place!

2208
01:17:53,290 --> 01:17:54,360
Let's try it.

2209
01:17:54,730 --> 01:17:56,760
Let's try this first.

2210
01:17:56,830 --> 01:17:58,400
We have to choose the toppings.

2211
01:17:58,930 --> 01:18:00,369
When you choose the noodles and toppings,

2212
01:18:00,370 --> 01:18:01,799
we'll package it for you.

2213
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:04,999
- I'll choose the Shin Ramyeon cup.
- Shin Ramyeon.

2214
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,069
(Haewon's own ramyeon)

2215
01:18:06,070 --> 01:18:07,070
Here. Yes.

2216
01:18:07,071 --> 01:18:08,139
(Thin noodles)

2217
01:18:08,140 --> 01:18:09,839
- I'll choose the beef bone soup.
- The beef bone soup.

2218
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:12,010
(He grabs the beef bone soup seasoning.)

2219
01:18:12,150 --> 01:18:14,309
- You can choose 5 toppings.
- Choose 5 toppings?

2220
01:18:14,310 --> 01:18:16,350
- Green onions and...
- Green onions?

2221
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:18,990
Green onions, fritters,

2222
01:18:19,150 --> 01:18:20,789
- and number 14.
- Number 14?

2223
01:18:20,790 --> 01:18:21,790
(Kimchi)

2224
01:18:21,791 --> 01:18:23,220
And 7 and 9.

2225
01:18:23,260 --> 01:18:24,459
- Did you say 7 and 9?
- Yes.

2226
01:18:24,460 --> 01:18:25,559
(As a professional idol, she chooses healthy toppings.)

2227
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:27,490
(Cabbage)

2228
01:18:27,630 --> 01:18:28,659
- Is that all?
- Yes.

2229
01:18:28,660 --> 01:18:30,306
(Green onions, fritters, kimchi, soy meat, and cabbage)

2230
01:18:30,330 --> 01:18:32,500
(The next step is packaging.)

2231
01:18:33,430 --> 01:18:34,500
This is fun.

2232
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:36,299
They seal it like that.

2233
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:39,569
- To take it home.
- It's to take it home.

2234
01:18:39,570 --> 01:18:42,140
- This place is real.
- It's awesome.

2235
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:43,839
Does a place like this exist?

2236
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:46,749
There are cup ramyeon factories and museums too.

2237
01:18:46,750 --> 01:18:47,986
(By applying heat for a moment, it is completely sealed.)

2238
01:18:48,010 --> 01:18:49,349
(Pushing buttons)

2239
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:53,249
(The ramyeon packaging process is over.)

2240
01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:56,059
- We can't make this.
- Our staff can't fabricate this.

2241
01:18:56,060 --> 01:18:58,160
How would they? It'd cost a fortune.

2242
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:01,390
- It's ready.
- Thank you.

2243
01:19:01,460 --> 01:19:03,159
- Hwasa, you should make one too.
- Yes.

2244
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:05,400
I'll choose Neoguri's noodles.

2245
01:19:06,070 --> 01:19:07,799
I'll choose Neoguri seasoning too.

2246
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:09,300
- Neoguri noodles.
- Yes.

2247
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:10,739
You're ordering in such an elegant manner.

2248
01:19:10,740 --> 01:19:11,769
(She sounds a bit too elegant to order ramyeon.)

2249
01:19:11,770 --> 01:19:13,439
- I...
- Which seasoning do you want?

2250
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:14,709
- Yes. I'll choose Neoguri.
- "I'll choose..."

2251
01:19:14,710 --> 01:19:15,790
- Neoguri seasoning.
- Yes.

2252
01:19:16,510 --> 01:19:18,710
It feels like she'd put a jacket over her shoulders.

2253
01:19:19,050 --> 01:19:21,010
- You can choose five.
- She came to buy jewelry.

2254
01:19:21,350 --> 01:19:22,679
- Green onions.
- Green onions?

2255
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:25,789
- Yes. And kelp.
- This is how it works.

2256
01:19:25,790 --> 01:19:26,820
Kelp.

2257
01:19:27,650 --> 01:19:29,759
Shiitake mushrooms and sea mustard.

2258
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:31,720
- Sea mustard?
- Sea mustard.

2259
01:19:31,820 --> 01:19:32,929
- Are they all?
- Yes.

2260
01:19:32,930 --> 01:19:34,430
(That will be enough for me.)

2261
01:19:34,990 --> 01:19:36,329
- It's ready.
- Thank you.

2262
01:19:36,330 --> 01:19:38,029
It'll be a perfect gift.

2263
01:19:38,030 --> 01:19:40,030
- It's perfect.
- Right?

2264
01:19:40,330 --> 01:19:41,669
(The next step is to Decorate Your Ramyeon.)

2265
01:19:41,670 --> 01:19:43,899
You can upload your photo by scanning the QR code.

2266
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:44,970
Then you can print it out.

2267
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:47,269
- I'll do the photo from ice valley.
- Yes.

2268
01:19:47,270 --> 01:19:48,740
- It's amazing.
- Did you make one?

2269
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:50,440
"Your photos have been uploaded."

2270
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:53,780
(Choosing the uploaded photo)

2271
01:19:54,250 --> 01:19:55,650
There it is.

2272
01:19:56,150 --> 01:19:57,179
(Amazed)

2273
01:19:57,180 --> 01:19:59,290
- That's crazy.
- It's the photo we took.

2274
01:19:59,550 --> 01:20:00,619
(After choosing a photo, )

2275
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:01,749
Print it.

2276
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:02,819
(push the print button.)

2277
01:20:02,820 --> 01:20:04,660
- Gosh. It's crazy.
- It's amazing.

2278
01:20:05,590 --> 01:20:07,229
- Goodness.
- Today's technology is...

2279
01:20:07,230 --> 01:20:09,430
It's just amazing.

2280
01:20:10,460 --> 01:20:12,300
- It's interesting.
- It's done.

2281
01:20:13,270 --> 01:20:15,099
(Ta-da)

2282
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:16,139
It's this big.

2283
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:18,299
It feels like we're in an amusement park.

2284
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:19,840
(It feels like an amusement park.)

2285
01:20:20,010 --> 01:20:22,070
By the way, this is so much fun, indeed.

2286
01:20:22,610 --> 01:20:24,309
- It's fun.
- Back in the day,

2287
01:20:24,310 --> 01:20:26,079
I would have come to this place frequently with my friends.

2288
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:28,109
- Cool.
- This is so precious.

2289
01:20:28,110 --> 01:20:29,150
I know.

2290
01:20:29,350 --> 01:20:30,379
She's cute.

2291
01:20:30,380 --> 01:20:31,919
- Seriously.
- It has suddenly become precious.

2292
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:33,419
- This is...
- Hey. The photo is done.

2293
01:20:33,420 --> 01:20:35,189
- a good place for a couple.
- Yes.

2294
01:20:35,190 --> 01:20:36,220
- Yes.
- Yes.

2295
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:39,459
(It looks more special with the photo of them on it.)

2296
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:42,229
- Write the name of your ramyeon.
- Yes.

2297
01:20:42,230 --> 01:20:43,306
- Haewon, you should write it too.
- Okay.

2298
01:20:43,330 --> 01:20:44,629
It's hard to come up with a title.

2299
01:20:44,630 --> 01:20:46,550
"If your album is coming out in autumn ramyeon."

2300
01:20:47,070 --> 01:20:48,569
"If my album had come out this time ramyeon."

2301
01:20:48,570 --> 01:20:50,970
- Yes. That's a good one.
- "If it had come out this time."

2302
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:52,869
"If my album had come out this time ramyeon."

2303
01:20:52,870 --> 01:20:54,670
"If my album had come out this time ramyeon."

2304
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:59,550
(Serious)

2305
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:01,686
Why kind of ramyeon are you thinking of, Haewon?

2306
01:21:01,710 --> 01:21:02,879
"If this place is fake ramyeon."

2307
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:05,119
("If this place is fake ramyeon")

2308
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:07,219
- Since this is Sixth Sense.
- Great.

2309
01:21:07,220 --> 01:21:09,490
- Great.
- "If this place is fake ramyeon."

2310
01:21:10,290 --> 01:21:11,496
"If this place is fake ramyeon."

2311
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:12,929
(Let's see Hwasa's.)

2312
01:21:12,930 --> 01:21:15,390
"If my album had come out this time ramyeon."

2313
01:21:16,230 --> 01:21:17,330
There are leaves falling.

2314
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:19,669
- Right.
- As it's coming out in fall.

2315
01:21:19,670 --> 01:21:20,699
- Really?
- Yes. There are leaves falling.

2316
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:22,700
- It will come out in fall.
- Right.

2317
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:24,539
- That's hilarious.
- What about you, Kyoung Pyo?

2318
01:21:24,540 --> 01:21:26,469
I made what I wanted to eat.

2319
01:21:26,470 --> 01:21:28,009
(He made it for him to eat.)

2320
01:21:28,010 --> 01:21:29,110
I got it to eat it.

2321
01:21:29,210 --> 01:21:30,279
- Was that so?
- Yes. I put together...

2322
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:31,309
a unique combination.

2323
01:21:31,310 --> 01:21:33,149
- Really?
- To have it at home?

2324
01:21:33,150 --> 01:21:34,279
- I'm going to have it here.
- You're going to have it here?

2325
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:35,280
- Yes.
- Gosh.

2326
01:21:35,780 --> 01:21:37,920
- Shall we all sit now?
- Yes.

2327
01:21:38,650 --> 01:21:39,650
Let's all sit.

2328
01:21:40,990 --> 01:21:42,689
(They have made their cup ramyeon...)

2329
01:21:42,690 --> 01:21:44,390
(filled with their memories.)

2330
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:46,800
I'll go with the Uijeongbu army stew.

2331
01:21:46,890 --> 01:21:49,300
- That is made here.
- Right.

2332
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:50,659
Here, you can...

2333
01:21:50,660 --> 01:21:52,869
- I can add them in?
- choose the ingredients you want.

2334
01:21:52,870 --> 01:21:53,900
- Got it.
- Right.

2335
01:21:54,700 --> 01:21:56,439
- Then...
- If you add in too much...

2336
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:57,440
- It will be salty, right?
- Yes.

2337
01:21:57,441 --> 01:21:59,201
That is why I don't plan to add in too much.

2338
01:21:59,810 --> 01:22:00,850
I think this will be good.

2339
01:22:01,270 --> 01:22:03,280
(What is this corner that mesmerized Childish Yu?)

2340
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:05,686
(Another My Own Ramyeon Dish of the My Own Ramyeon place)

2341
01:22:05,710 --> 01:22:07,380
(My Own Regional Ramyeon)

2342
01:22:07,780 --> 01:22:09,980
First of all, the ramyeon will become a dish.

2343
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:11,080
(Uijeongbu army stew)

2344
01:22:11,081 --> 01:22:12,220
(Seoul bulgogi)

2345
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:13,690
(Busan pork gukbap)

2346
01:22:14,150 --> 01:22:17,190
(The representative dishes of each region will become a ramyeon!)

2347
01:22:18,090 --> 01:22:21,060
(From the My Own Regional Ramyeon corner)

2348
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:24,029
When you taste the soup of the ramyeon,

2349
01:22:24,030 --> 01:22:26,430
you will taste a whole different taste.

2350
01:22:26,530 --> 01:22:27,900
That is a big plus.

2351
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:30,600
(My Own Regional Ramyeon is coming soon.)

2352
01:22:30,970 --> 01:22:33,310
We can't get it wrong again this time.

2353
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:36,400
- We should get it right this time.
- Shouldn't we get it right?

2354
01:22:36,710 --> 01:22:37,740
Earlier,

2355
01:22:38,540 --> 01:22:40,680
I just ordered...

2356
01:22:40,910 --> 01:22:42,780
- the army stew ramyeon.
- Right.

2357
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:46,389
I wasn't going to add in a lot of toppings anyway,

2358
01:22:46,390 --> 01:22:49,120
but he did say this. "Don't add in too much."

2359
01:22:50,190 --> 01:22:51,460
(Impressed)

2360
01:22:51,690 --> 01:22:52,759
It means he knows...

2361
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:53,906
- Right.
- the right balance.

2362
01:22:53,930 --> 01:22:55,959
- He has the experience.
- Right.

2363
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:57,836
- It means he knows.
- If not, he wouldn't know.

2364
01:22:57,860 --> 01:23:00,369
- He recommended the best recipe.
- Right.

2365
01:23:00,370 --> 01:23:01,429
It would be too salty if there were too many ingredients.

2366
01:23:01,430 --> 01:23:03,950
- Right. He doesn't like it salty.
- Like the tteokbokki pizza.

2367
01:23:04,070 --> 01:23:05,946
- The tteokbokki pizza.
- He's picky with salty food.

2368
01:23:05,970 --> 01:23:08,310
Right. I don't like things being salty.

2369
01:23:08,510 --> 01:23:10,409
- It was at the side.
- Right.

2370
01:23:10,410 --> 01:23:11,856
(He quietly appears with his cup ramyeon.)

2371
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:13,350
(Peekaboo)

2372
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:14,480
Kyoung Pyo.

2373
01:23:14,481 --> 01:23:16,120
- Already?
- What did you quietly make?

2374
01:23:16,820 --> 01:23:19,250
(I'll have the beef bone soup seasoning.)

2375
01:23:19,550 --> 01:23:20,589
(I am Kochelin.)

2376
01:23:20,590 --> 01:23:21,996
(The ramyeon comes first instead of the deduction.)

2377
01:23:22,020 --> 01:23:24,390
(The wait of perseverance)

2378
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:26,560
I came up with my ramyeon.

2379
01:23:28,260 --> 01:23:30,500
- It hasn't cooked yet.
- What is the soup based on?

2380
01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:32,669
It's the beef bone soup seasoning with the kimchi topping.

2381
01:23:32,670 --> 01:23:34,500
(Impressed)

2382
01:23:34,770 --> 01:23:35,770
(Satisfied)

2383
01:23:35,771 --> 01:23:37,839
- It'll be good.
- Indeed. You know how to eat.

2384
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:39,416
(How will Kochelin's My Own Ramyeon taste?)

2385
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:41,640
- Gosh.
- Can't I ask the owner this? Sir.

2386
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:44,140
Is this a pop-up store?

2387
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:47,709
Just this ramyeon zone is a pop-up.

2388
01:23:47,710 --> 01:23:50,149
It started in January.

2389
01:23:50,150 --> 01:23:51,790
- It was originally a snack bar.
- Right.

2390
01:23:52,390 --> 01:23:53,950
(What is a pop-up store?)

2391
01:23:54,420 --> 01:23:56,760
(To promote a brand, )

2392
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:02,090
(a temporary offline store is run for a short while.)

2393
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:04,360
I think it's real.

2394
01:24:04,930 --> 01:24:07,829
It feels very suspicious that it started in January.

2395
01:24:07,830 --> 01:24:10,139
- Really?
- They always work a month before.

2396
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:11,840
Right. They always work a month before.

2397
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:14,769
But compared to the other two places,

2398
01:24:14,770 --> 01:24:17,779
this place makes the most sense and feels real.

2399
01:24:17,780 --> 01:24:20,749
- That is why it feels suspicious.
- It feels suspicious.

2400
01:24:20,750 --> 01:24:22,620
- It feels rather suspicious.
- Right.

2401
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:25,150
The army stew is here. Thank you.

2402
01:24:25,950 --> 01:24:27,110
- The army stew.
- Thank you.

2403
01:24:27,190 --> 01:24:28,910
- What is that?
- It's the bulgogi ramyeon.

2404
01:24:29,490 --> 01:24:30,560
That must be delicious.

2405
01:24:31,090 --> 01:24:33,089
With the representative dishes of each region...

2406
01:24:33,090 --> 01:24:35,090
mixed with ramyeon,

2407
01:24:35,290 --> 01:24:37,859
it felt like I could come up with regional ramyeon dishes.

2408
01:24:37,860 --> 01:24:39,380
That was how I developed these dishes.

2409
01:24:40,230 --> 01:24:42,870
(The original spicy red flavor of ramyeon...)

2410
01:24:43,340 --> 01:24:45,099
(with Uijeongbu army stew's...)

2411
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:46,870
(signature sausages, bacon, and beans)

2412
01:24:47,140 --> 01:24:48,739
(Uijeongbu army stew)

2413
01:24:48,740 --> 01:24:50,680
(Uijeongbu army stew ramyeon)

2414
01:24:51,580 --> 01:24:55,880
(Plump udon noodles with sweet Seoul-style bulgogi...)

2415
01:24:57,220 --> 01:24:59,150
(topped with enoki mushrooms and green onions)

2416
01:24:59,620 --> 01:25:03,090
(Seoul-style bulgogi ramyeon)

2417
01:25:05,420 --> 01:25:07,459
(Beef bone soup ramyeon seasoning...)

2418
01:25:07,460 --> 01:25:10,400
(with pyeonyuk and chives)

2419
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:14,200
(Busan pork gukbap ramyeon)

2420
01:25:14,470 --> 01:25:16,590
(The dishes that will never betray you with taste...)

2421
01:25:16,940 --> 01:25:18,400
(and customization)

2422
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:21,340
(My Own Regional Ramyeon)

2423
01:25:22,370 --> 01:25:25,210
Gosh, this looks good.

2424
01:25:26,610 --> 01:25:29,009
So that's how it's made.

2425
01:25:29,010 --> 01:25:30,920
- That's how it is.
- Right.

2426
01:25:31,050 --> 01:25:33,889
The army stew ramyeon looks really good.

2427
01:25:33,890 --> 01:25:34,949
- Right?
- Yes.

2428
01:25:34,950 --> 01:25:37,219
We talked about army stew, and here it is.

2429
01:25:37,220 --> 01:25:38,690
- Perfect timing.
- Right.

2430
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:40,229
(Amazed)

2431
01:25:40,230 --> 01:25:42,600
(How does the Uijeongbu army stew ramyeon taste?)

2432
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:46,700
- How is it? Too good?
- It's good.

2433
01:25:49,070 --> 01:25:51,140
(Nodding out of satisfaction)

2434
01:25:51,470 --> 01:25:54,340
- And the topping... Gosh.
- It smells so good.

2435
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:56,710
- It smells great, Kyoung Pyo.
- It's amazing, isn't it?

2436
01:25:56,980 --> 01:25:58,410
It smells really nice.

2437
01:25:59,150 --> 01:26:00,249
It's good.

2438
01:26:00,250 --> 01:26:02,409
(The combination of springy noodles and army stew soup)

2439
01:26:02,410 --> 01:26:03,450
It's delicious.

2440
01:26:04,750 --> 01:26:08,920
(Ms. Song takes a bite of the army stew ramyeon too.)

2441
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:11,090
(Satisfied)

2442
01:26:11,390 --> 01:26:12,390
It's good.

2443
01:26:13,290 --> 01:26:15,460
There's no doubt about it. It's just good.

2444
01:26:17,260 --> 01:26:19,630
(Next is the Busan pork gukbap ramyeon.)

2445
01:26:20,470 --> 01:26:22,630
The pork gukbap ramyeon should be eaten with the soup.

2446
01:26:22,940 --> 01:26:24,440
It's almost like the tonkotsu ramen.

2447
01:26:24,770 --> 01:26:26,240
- You're right.
- Add the seasoning.

2448
01:26:27,070 --> 01:26:28,310
Right. Should I add it?

2449
01:26:28,870 --> 01:26:30,739
(Slurping)

2450
01:26:30,740 --> 01:26:31,740
(Impressed)

2451
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:34,210
The chef is great at cooking ramyeon.

2452
01:26:34,910 --> 01:26:37,520
It's easy for the noodles to get soggy for these types,

2453
01:26:38,420 --> 01:26:40,649
but the noodles are really springy.

2454
01:26:40,650 --> 01:26:42,770
(Soft pyeonyuk and chives exactly in the Busan style)

2455
01:26:44,190 --> 01:26:45,719
(Is the regional ramyeon place everyone was amazed of real?)

2456
01:26:45,720 --> 01:26:47,059
Indeed. It was cooked well.

2457
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:48,636
(Is the regional ramyeon place everyone was amazed of real?)

2458
01:26:48,660 --> 01:26:49,959
(Haewon who felt suspicious takes a bite of the pyeonyuk.)

2459
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:51,000
Pyeonyuk?

2460
01:26:51,530 --> 01:26:53,029
It's the pyeonyuk of the pork gukbap.

2461
01:26:53,030 --> 01:26:55,130
(This is sexy food.)

2462
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:57,040
He's amazing at cooking ramyeon.

2463
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:02,640
(Mimi chooses the Seoul-style bulgogi ramyeon.)

2464
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:05,310
(Nodding)

2465
01:27:05,580 --> 01:27:07,509
- The bulgogi is nice.
- The bulgogi seems to be good.

2466
01:27:07,510 --> 01:27:08,670
- Is the bulgogi good?
- Yes.

2467
01:27:09,180 --> 01:27:10,740
(Picking up a big piece of the bulgogi)

2468
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:14,320
(Eating elegantly)

2469
01:27:14,720 --> 01:27:17,919
(Satisfied)

2470
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:18,920
It's so good.

2471
01:27:19,190 --> 01:27:20,659
- It feels like pot bulgogi.
- Really?

2472
01:27:20,660 --> 01:27:22,800
It feels like pot bulgogi with noodles added.

2473
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:25,560
- It's really good.
- It's amazing.

2474
01:27:25,561 --> 01:27:27,206
(A subtle sweet and clean taste that anyone would love)

2475
01:27:27,230 --> 01:27:28,570
(Springy)

2476
01:27:28,930 --> 01:27:30,740
Gosh, ramyeon is just...

2477
01:27:31,470 --> 01:27:33,739
- We ate so much.
- But we're able to eat again.

2478
01:27:33,740 --> 01:27:36,509
- Right. Ramyeon is just great.
- We can still eat when we're full.

2479
01:27:36,510 --> 01:27:38,140
(Even though they've eaten all day, )

2480
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:43,920
(it feels like their first meal.)

2481
01:27:45,350 --> 01:27:46,789
You said you didn't like salty food.

2482
01:27:46,790 --> 01:27:47,949
(He would've been in trouble if he did.)

2483
01:27:47,950 --> 01:27:49,020
This is amazing.

2484
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:50,589
I have no idea.

2485
01:27:50,590 --> 01:27:53,589
Seeing the size of this place,

2486
01:27:53,590 --> 01:27:55,160
this place seems reasonable.

2487
01:27:55,490 --> 01:27:56,529
- Right.
- Right?

2488
01:27:56,530 --> 01:27:58,430
- Right.
- The lights are egg-shaped.

2489
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:01,469
- What?
- They look like eggs.

2490
01:28:01,470 --> 01:28:02,869
- They were designed that way.
- Right?

2491
01:28:02,870 --> 01:28:04,116
- You're right.
- I think you're right.

2492
01:28:04,140 --> 01:28:06,220
Being able to make that in a short amount of time...

2493
01:28:06,770 --> 01:28:09,040
- Right. That would be hard to make.
- Right.

2494
01:28:09,540 --> 01:28:12,380
(Even the lights are egg-shaped in this place. Is this place real?)

2495
01:28:13,650 --> 01:28:14,710
Is this one good?

2496
01:28:15,410 --> 01:28:17,850
- Is it good? May I try a bite?
- Of course.

2497
01:28:18,620 --> 01:28:19,620
(Focused)

2498
01:28:19,621 --> 01:28:22,181
(What will the food expert Hwasa think of Kyoung Pyo's ramyeon?)

2499
01:28:22,420 --> 01:28:23,460
(Checking the smell)

2500
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:28,490
(How does Kyoung Pyo's My Own Ramyeon taste?)

2501
01:28:28,930 --> 01:28:30,329
- It feels like pot bulgogi.
- Really?

2502
01:28:30,330 --> 01:28:31,906
It feels like pot bulgogi with noodles added.

2503
01:28:31,930 --> 01:28:33,400
This one is good too, right?

2504
01:28:33,700 --> 01:28:35,569
- This one must be good.
- This one is good.

2505
01:28:35,570 --> 01:28:37,339
- Ko Kyoung Pyo's ramyeon is good.
- It's really good.

2506
01:28:37,340 --> 01:28:39,370
- I know my ramyeon.
- Ko Kyoung Pyo's ramyeon.

2507
01:28:40,570 --> 01:28:41,669
- It's good.
- Kyoung Pyo's ramyeon.

2508
01:28:41,670 --> 01:28:43,480
(Approving)

2509
01:28:43,740 --> 01:28:46,009
The beef bone soup seasoning and kimchi topping.

2510
01:28:46,010 --> 01:28:48,710
- An egg scramble.
- Gosh, it's so good.

2511
01:28:48,810 --> 01:28:49,879
(My Own Han River Ramyeon)

2512
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:51,560
There's another one we have to try, right?

2513
01:28:52,650 --> 01:28:55,490
(A dish that makes them all let out a cheer?)

2514
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:59,019
- This is amazing.
- This looks so good.

2515
01:28:59,020 --> 01:29:01,859
The toppings look amazing too.

2516
01:29:01,860 --> 01:29:03,740
(The stunning new ramyeon makes an appearance.)

2517
01:29:04,030 --> 01:29:05,329
This is an amazing dish.

2518
01:29:05,330 --> 01:29:06,869
(It's time to try the new dish!)

2519
01:29:06,870 --> 01:29:09,470
- Gosh.
- The sauce is thick.

2520
01:29:09,570 --> 01:29:10,570
It's cream-based.

2521
01:29:11,270 --> 01:29:12,270
Try it with the shrimp.

2522
01:29:12,271 --> 01:29:13,309
(Giving it a blow...)

2523
01:29:13,310 --> 01:29:14,410
(and slurping)

2524
01:29:15,940 --> 01:29:17,010
I love it!

2525
01:29:18,310 --> 01:29:20,480
As it feels creamy,

2526
01:29:20,910 --> 01:29:22,209
- I keep wanting more.
- It's neat, isn't it?

2527
01:29:22,210 --> 01:29:23,780
- Yes.
- This has to be spicy.

2528
01:29:23,850 --> 01:29:26,389
As toppings, you could use pollack roe...

2529
01:29:26,390 --> 01:29:27,790
- That sounds great!
- or sausages.

2530
01:29:28,350 --> 01:29:30,190
- It's a new dish with the shrimp.
- Right.

2531
01:29:31,090 --> 01:29:32,560
(Taking a big bite)

2532
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:34,760
- It's neat.
- Right.

2533
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:37,399
It doesn't feel greasy.

2534
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:40,230
The recipe for this was really popular.

2535
01:29:41,470 --> 01:29:43,139
That was why this was separately released.

2536
01:29:43,140 --> 01:29:45,940
The recipe for this was really popular on social media.

2537
01:29:46,040 --> 01:29:48,160
- That is why this is so good.
- Right. It's so good.

2538
01:29:50,210 --> 01:29:52,109
(The last ramyeon gets cleared pleasantly.)

2539
01:29:52,110 --> 01:29:53,230
- It's so good.
- It's good.

2540
01:29:53,810 --> 01:29:56,220
- But this place doesn't feel fake.
- Right.

2541
01:29:57,880 --> 01:29:59,149
- Can this place be fake?
- Right.

2542
01:29:59,150 --> 01:30:00,289
(If this place is fake...)

2543
01:30:00,290 --> 01:30:01,320
This place is real.

2544
01:30:02,790 --> 01:30:04,859
- This place can't be fake.
- She's certain.

2545
01:30:04,860 --> 01:30:06,730
But this place feels fake to me.

2546
01:30:07,530 --> 01:30:08,560
Why?

2547
01:30:08,830 --> 01:30:11,200
Doesn't this place not have the feast of a snack bar?

2548
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:13,299
- You meant the traces, right?
- Right.

2549
01:30:13,300 --> 01:30:16,270
- But pop-ups are done by the brand.
- The brand takes care of things.

2550
01:30:17,140 --> 01:30:19,910
But didn't the brand take over the snack bar too much?

2551
01:30:20,140 --> 01:30:21,639
The brand paid them. They should be allowed to take over.

2552
01:30:21,640 --> 01:30:22,670
Oh, is that so?

2553
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:25,480
It's too perfect.

2554
01:30:25,740 --> 01:30:28,210
The owner also said this about the pop...

2555
01:30:29,180 --> 01:30:30,249
- What is it again?
- "Pop-up."

2556
01:30:30,250 --> 01:30:31,250
"Pop-up."

2557
01:30:31,251 --> 01:30:32,579
- Right.
- You couldn't remember one word...

2558
01:30:32,580 --> 01:30:33,950
out of two?

2559
01:30:34,490 --> 01:30:36,289
(Memory cut in half)

2560
01:30:36,290 --> 01:30:38,889
He said it was exactly a pop-up store.

2561
01:30:38,890 --> 01:30:40,259
It was meant to feel this way.

2562
01:30:40,260 --> 01:30:42,860
(Is this really a temporary pop-up store?)

2563
01:30:43,130 --> 01:30:45,300
The brand feels suspicious.

2564
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:46,870
- The brand?
- Yes.

2565
01:30:47,430 --> 01:30:49,640
It doesn't suit Samseong-dong.

2566
01:30:49,870 --> 01:30:51,199
- This area?
- Right.

2567
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:52,339
(Samseong-dong?)

2568
01:30:52,340 --> 01:30:53,739
It doesn't have that feel.

2569
01:30:53,740 --> 01:30:54,980
What has that brand done wrong?

2570
01:30:56,010 --> 01:30:58,280
Do you not like the brand or Samseong-dong?

2571
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:01,550
The brand took over this place too much.

2572
01:31:01,810 --> 01:31:03,320
That is what a pop-up is.

2573
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:05,749
- They pay to do this.
- Right.

2574
01:31:05,750 --> 01:31:07,390
A pop-up store is paid to be done.

2575
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:09,719
- Right.
- It's not just done for free.

2576
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:11,200
They don't just take over this place.

2577
01:31:12,290 --> 01:31:14,690
But the owner's signature recipes...

2578
01:31:15,230 --> 01:31:17,299
They would feel too abandoned.

2579
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:18,399
- Ms. Mimi?
- Yes?

2580
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:19,460
What is your complaint?

2581
01:31:20,930 --> 01:31:22,940
What don't you like about this place?

2582
01:31:23,370 --> 01:31:25,600
I like this place.

2583
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:27,739
I really have no idea.

2584
01:31:27,740 --> 01:31:29,140
I don't have a clue, to be honest.

2585
01:31:29,580 --> 01:31:31,140
This is so hard.

2586
01:31:31,380 --> 01:31:33,260
- I have no idea.
- I thought it'd be too easy.

2587
01:31:34,710 --> 01:31:36,949
(Anything Ramyeon: Big company taking over a snack bar, )

2588
01:31:36,950 --> 01:31:39,079
(has only started a month ago)

2589
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:41,320
(staff member natural with the regional ramyeon recipe)

2590
01:31:41,550 --> 01:31:43,460
Gosh, my belly is about to burst open.

2591
01:31:44,260 --> 01:31:45,860
In the morning...

2592
01:31:46,630 --> 01:31:50,160
In the morning, he was definitely slim.

2593
01:31:50,330 --> 01:31:51,330
(Fully charged up with happiness)

2594
01:31:51,331 --> 01:31:52,460
- Gosh!
- Gosh!

2595
01:31:54,930 --> 01:31:57,199
Usually, when celebrities come looking puffy in the morning,

2596
01:31:57,200 --> 01:31:58,739
- it gets better in the afternoon.
- Right.

2597
01:31:58,740 --> 01:32:00,500
- It's the opposite for Kyoung Pyo.
- Right.

2598
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:03,410
- It's the opposite for him.
- Right?

2599
01:32:04,610 --> 01:32:06,509
I can get rid of this whenever I want to.

2600
01:32:06,510 --> 01:32:07,849
(Paid Kyoung Pyo is coming soon.)

2601
01:32:07,850 --> 01:32:09,579
- Welcome back, Aunt Yu.
- Right.

2602
01:32:09,580 --> 01:32:11,949
(It's time to make the final decision with Aunt Yu.)

2603
01:32:11,950 --> 01:32:14,390
Well, I have no idea today.

2604
01:32:15,090 --> 01:32:16,290
Gosh!

2605
01:32:16,490 --> 01:32:18,289
- Come on.
- Oh, no.

2606
01:32:18,290 --> 01:32:20,359
We should gather our opinions through a vote.

2607
01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:21,389
- Right.
- Right.

2608
01:32:21,390 --> 01:32:22,929
- Let's hear our opinions.
- Mimi.

2609
01:32:22,930 --> 01:32:23,959
I choose the third place.

2610
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:25,129
- Why?
- Gosh.

2611
01:32:25,130 --> 01:32:27,769
I felt this while coming up the stairs.

2612
01:32:27,770 --> 01:32:30,076
The brand took over too much. It took over even the mirror.

2613
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:31,100
The brand.

2614
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,909
- I told you it was a pop-up store.
- That's how pop-up stores are run.

2615
01:32:33,910 --> 01:32:35,409
They must've paid the owner a lot.

2616
01:32:35,410 --> 01:32:37,980
Just for the My Own Ramyeon?

2617
01:32:39,780 --> 01:32:40,850
Is that how it's done?

2618
01:32:41,210 --> 01:32:42,610
- Pop-up stores...
- But instead...

2619
01:32:43,020 --> 01:32:45,580
Hold on, Ms. Mimi. Let me explain it to you.

2620
01:32:46,150 --> 01:32:47,749
- This is what a pop-up store is.
- Right.

2621
01:32:47,750 --> 01:32:50,790
A certain place is signed up...

2622
01:32:51,090 --> 01:32:52,389
and paid a certain amount of money.

2623
01:32:52,390 --> 01:32:54,989
That place is filled with the brand that paid.

2624
01:32:54,990 --> 01:32:56,400
It's for promotion...

2625
01:32:56,630 --> 01:32:58,799
and many other reasons. That's what a pop-up store is for.

2626
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:00,629
- To promote that brand?
- Right.

2627
01:33:00,630 --> 01:33:01,699
- I see.
- Right.

2628
01:33:01,700 --> 01:33:03,299
(What?)

2629
01:33:03,300 --> 01:33:04,569
- Hold on.
- Jae Seok,

2630
01:33:04,570 --> 01:33:06,139
just come back. She won't understand.

2631
01:33:06,140 --> 01:33:08,369
- She didn't listen to you.
- She's just...

2632
01:33:08,370 --> 01:33:10,639
- Gosh.
- So which place do you choose?

2633
01:33:10,640 --> 01:33:12,840
- I choose the third place.
- Gosh.

2634
01:33:13,350 --> 01:33:15,609
- I told you.
- Okay. Fine.

2635
01:33:15,610 --> 01:33:17,419
- All right.
- What about you, Haewon?

2636
01:33:17,420 --> 01:33:19,319
Just until now, I was going to choose the second place.

2637
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:20,840
But now, I think it's the first place.

2638
01:33:21,250 --> 01:33:23,259
There was something that...

2639
01:33:23,260 --> 01:33:24,836
- Mimi said toward the end.
- What did she say?

2640
01:33:24,860 --> 01:33:27,190
(Anything Pizza)

2641
01:33:27,590 --> 01:33:30,060
(The place that makes pizzas with any ingredient!)

2642
01:33:30,430 --> 01:33:31,999
(Mimi's deduction: This place usually delivers food, )

2643
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,799
(but the customers come with the food to make requests?)

2644
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:35,670
(What?)

2645
01:33:36,770 --> 01:33:39,069
The food that I wanted to eat is brought...

2646
01:33:39,070 --> 01:33:41,240
and asked to be turned into a pizza.

2647
01:33:41,970 --> 01:33:43,079
The food is usually delivered,

2648
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:44,509
but it doesn't make sense for people to bring food and make orders.

2649
01:33:44,510 --> 01:33:45,679
Right.

2650
01:33:45,680 --> 01:33:47,779
And when that pizza is served,

2651
01:33:47,780 --> 01:33:49,010
there is no space to eat it.

2652
01:33:49,820 --> 01:33:50,820
This feels off.

2653
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:55,450
(The custom pizza place is a takeout restaurant too.)

2654
01:33:55,820 --> 01:33:57,459
(Unsure)

2655
01:33:57,460 --> 01:34:01,530
(The blunt ones found the system of the restaurant to be suspicious.)

2656
01:34:01,730 --> 01:34:04,359
I remember this about the owner of the first place too.

2657
01:34:04,360 --> 01:34:08,329
"They takeout the food." As he was saying this,

2658
01:34:08,330 --> 01:34:09,800
he felt unsure about it himself.

2659
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:14,370
- He was like that?
- As he was speaking,

2660
01:34:14,810 --> 01:34:16,009
he wasn't sure if it made sense.

2661
01:34:16,010 --> 01:34:17,279
- He wasn't able to...
- Right.

2662
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:18,339
- I remember that.
- He wasn't able to...

2663
01:34:18,340 --> 01:34:19,379
understand what he said.

2664
01:34:19,380 --> 01:34:20,609
- Right.
- Right.

2665
01:34:20,610 --> 01:34:23,579
- That was weird.
- Right.

2666
01:34:23,580 --> 01:34:25,119
It's a delivery place, but why are there takeouts?

2667
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:26,449
- That does feel off.
- Right.

2668
01:34:26,450 --> 01:34:27,450
Right.

2669
01:34:27,550 --> 01:34:28,910
- That was weird.
- I will also...

2670
01:34:29,620 --> 01:34:31,036
- go with the first place.
- Really?

2671
01:34:31,060 --> 01:34:32,060
(Gullible Yu easily changes his mind.)

2672
01:34:32,061 --> 01:34:33,589
It seems like you suddenly changed your mind.

2673
01:34:33,590 --> 01:34:36,260
- He was on this side.
- But hold on.

2674
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:38,399
I'll go with the second place.

2675
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:40,369
Right. I can't forget that sponge cake.

2676
01:34:40,370 --> 01:34:42,130
That taste of the fried sponge cake.

2677
01:34:42,670 --> 01:34:46,070
(Anything Fried)

2678
01:34:46,570 --> 01:34:50,480
(All store ingredients are fried with the ultrasonic fryer?)

2679
01:34:50,610 --> 01:34:52,686
(Only Jae Seok and Eun I tried the fried sponge cake.)

2680
01:34:52,710 --> 01:34:54,556
Only the two of you tried the fried sponge cake.

2681
01:34:54,580 --> 01:34:57,649
(Childish Yu went for the fried sponge cake.)

2682
01:34:57,650 --> 01:35:00,650
(Chewing)

2683
01:35:00,950 --> 01:35:02,489
(Choking)

2684
01:35:02,490 --> 01:35:05,560
(They all witnessed Childish Yu's frown.)

2685
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:07,890
The sponge cake was drenched in oil...

2686
01:35:08,460 --> 01:35:09,629
and eaten straight away.

2687
01:35:09,630 --> 01:35:10,859
(A strong memory of the fried food he paid for)

2688
01:35:10,860 --> 01:35:11,860
Just like that.

2689
01:35:12,730 --> 01:35:13,930
That should never be eaten.

2690
01:35:14,430 --> 01:35:16,299
(Ms. Song is still torn.)

2691
01:35:16,300 --> 01:35:17,540
The fried food.

2692
01:35:20,670 --> 01:35:21,830
I'll go with the first place.

2693
01:35:22,310 --> 01:35:24,039
- Okay.
- It'll be the first place.

2694
01:35:24,040 --> 01:35:25,040
It's the first place for you too, Kyoung Pyo?

2695
01:35:25,041 --> 01:35:26,979
- Yes. It's the first place.
- Pizzas...

2696
01:35:26,980 --> 01:35:29,549
- are all about the cheese.
- The cheese.

2697
01:35:29,550 --> 01:35:31,319
- It's an important factor.
- Definitely.

2698
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:33,349
If the pizza is delivered,

2699
01:35:33,350 --> 01:35:34,989
- the cheese would be fine.
- It would get delivered quickly.

2700
01:35:34,990 --> 01:35:37,019
But it's a different issue when it has to be taken out.

2701
01:35:37,020 --> 01:35:38,689
The ones who will choose the first place should come here.

2702
01:35:38,690 --> 01:35:39,690
Number one.

2703
01:35:39,890 --> 01:35:41,930
- I'm number 2, and she's number 3.
- I'm number 3.

2704
01:35:42,330 --> 01:35:44,359
(Mimi chooses to go her own way.)

2705
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:46,100
Why are you going with the third place?

2706
01:35:46,430 --> 01:35:48,529
It just feels that way to me.

2707
01:35:48,530 --> 01:35:50,540
All right. Today,

2708
01:35:50,670 --> 01:35:52,116
- we will go with the number 1!
- Number 1!

2709
01:35:52,140 --> 01:35:53,509
We have to get it right today.

2710
01:35:53,510 --> 01:35:55,239
- Right!
- Right!

2711
01:35:55,240 --> 01:35:57,086
(Will they be able to break their losing streak?)

2712
01:35:57,110 --> 01:36:00,010
(Sixth Sense's fifth tour)

2713
01:36:00,310 --> 01:36:02,010
It's the fifth tour.

2714
01:36:03,750 --> 01:36:04,980
(Star)

2715
01:36:05,150 --> 01:36:06,220
Thank you.

2716
01:36:07,150 --> 01:36:09,620
Gosh, it was so hard today.

2717
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:11,919
- What?
- Hold on.

2718
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:13,129
(World's first Anything Tour)

2719
01:36:13,130 --> 01:36:15,229
(All of these things can become a pizza?)

2720
01:36:15,230 --> 01:36:18,129
What Mimi mentioned was crucial.

2721
01:36:18,130 --> 01:36:19,260
- Right.
- No!

2722
01:36:20,130 --> 01:36:21,130
Let's go!

2723
01:36:21,131 --> 01:36:22,870
(Anything Pizza that bakes any ingredient)

2724
01:36:22,970 --> 01:36:25,240
(The whole store can be fried?)

2725
01:36:26,440 --> 01:36:27,869
It was fried like that?

2726
01:36:27,870 --> 01:36:28,909
(Anything except a shoe will be fried!)

2727
01:36:28,910 --> 01:36:30,140
There's the Shine Muscat.

2728
01:36:31,340 --> 01:36:32,679
I think it's the second place.

2729
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:34,479
(Anything Fried in the mart)

2730
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:37,120
(Making ramyeon of your own?)

2731
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:39,720
You can do this with ramyeon.

2732
01:36:40,150 --> 01:36:41,389
It's possible to add various toppings to ramyeon.

2733
01:36:41,390 --> 01:36:42,390
That's right.

2734
01:36:42,391 --> 01:36:44,859
- Right.
- This makes sense.

2735
01:36:44,860 --> 01:36:47,360
(Anything Ramyeon, the end of customization)

2736
01:36:48,030 --> 01:36:49,030
Please.

2737
01:36:49,031 --> 01:36:50,600
- Please!
- Please!

2738
01:36:51,500 --> 01:36:52,830
Please!

2739
01:36:52,930 --> 01:36:54,069
- Please be right.
- Please!

2740
01:36:54,070 --> 01:36:55,730
- Please!
- Please!

2741
01:36:56,470 --> 01:37:01,040
(Which place is the only fake place of customization?)

2742
01:37:01,110 --> 01:37:02,639
- Please!
- Please!

2743
01:37:02,640 --> 01:37:04,140
- Please!
- Number one!

2744
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:06,379
(The one place that fooled your sixth sense)

2745
01:37:06,380 --> 01:37:08,810
- Please!
- Number one!

2746
01:37:08,910 --> 01:37:10,619
(Will their desperation be answered?)

2747
01:37:10,620 --> 01:37:11,719
Number one!

2748
01:37:11,720 --> 01:37:13,200
- Which one is it?
- Which one is it?

2749
01:37:13,650 --> 01:37:16,050
(It will be revealed now.)

2750
01:37:20,530 --> 01:37:22,189
(Anything Ramyeon)

2751
01:37:22,190 --> 01:37:23,860
(Fake)

2752
01:37:26,100 --> 01:37:27,100
See?

2753
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:29,230
(Shocked)

2754
01:37:29,370 --> 01:37:31,540
(Startled)

2755
01:37:31,670 --> 01:37:33,309
- It's fake!
- What?

2756
01:37:33,310 --> 01:37:35,739
That place is fake!

2757
01:37:35,740 --> 01:37:38,440
- What?
- How is that place fake?

2758
01:37:38,710 --> 01:37:41,650
I told you! It's fake!

2759
01:37:42,110 --> 01:37:43,950
I knew something was off!

2760
01:37:44,120 --> 01:37:46,019
- What was off?
- How is that place fake?

2761
01:37:46,020 --> 01:37:48,289
Tell us what was off, Mimi.

2762
01:37:48,290 --> 01:37:50,260
I can't tell you what was off.

2763
01:37:50,790 --> 01:37:52,489
(They got fooled again.)

2764
01:37:52,490 --> 01:37:53,660
- What's going on?
- Really?

2765
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:55,390
Are you serious?

2766
01:37:56,190 --> 01:37:58,600
- What?
- What's this about?

2767
01:37:59,300 --> 01:38:00,870
Why go this far?

2768
01:38:02,100 --> 01:38:03,870
We were told it was a pop-up store.

2769
01:38:04,140 --> 01:38:05,969
(The playground of Gen MZers)

2770
01:38:05,970 --> 01:38:07,039
(Pop-up store)

2771
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:08,909
(Pop-up stores attracting Gen MZers even take over cultural fields)

2772
01:38:08,910 --> 01:38:10,116
(Pop-up store craze for musicals spread out to small performances)

2773
01:38:10,140 --> 01:38:12,040
(Pop-up)

2774
01:38:12,380 --> 01:38:14,010
It was a pop-up store. Why was it fake?

2775
01:38:14,850 --> 01:38:16,980
(Fashion and beauty)

2776
01:38:17,380 --> 01:38:18,719
From K-pop...

2777
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:20,290
Right.

2778
01:38:21,020 --> 01:38:22,920
(Character pop-up stores)

2779
01:38:23,120 --> 01:38:25,459
(The generation that acknowledges pop-ups as a hot place)

2780
01:38:25,460 --> 01:38:26,460
(For the first time in Sixth Sense, )

2781
01:38:26,461 --> 01:38:28,629
(a pop-up store was open for two months.)

2782
01:38:28,630 --> 01:38:30,000
- What?
- What?

2783
01:38:30,430 --> 01:38:33,299
You started a pop-up store for two months to fool us?

2784
01:38:33,300 --> 01:38:35,200
What's wrong with Sixth Sense?

2785
01:38:35,900 --> 01:38:37,939
(How was a pop-up store made?)

2786
01:38:37,940 --> 01:38:42,109
(Pop-up store open to-do list)

2787
01:38:42,110 --> 01:38:43,809
- Right.
- Are you serious?

2788
01:38:43,810 --> 01:38:45,930
There's a lot of work that needs to be done for this.

2789
01:38:46,010 --> 01:38:47,709
(That is why we thought of...)

2790
01:38:47,710 --> 01:38:50,149
(the savior that could make our pop-up store come true.)

2791
01:38:50,150 --> 01:38:51,949
(That place is Nongshim.)

2792
01:38:51,950 --> 01:38:55,019
- Why go this far?
- That was how they worked together.

2793
01:38:55,020 --> 01:38:56,319
I can't believe it!

2794
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:58,089
That was what I was talking about!

2795
01:38:58,090 --> 01:38:59,789
This was what we thought about.

2796
01:38:59,790 --> 01:39:03,029
(Explaining about the pop-up store that was imagined)

2797
01:39:03,030 --> 01:39:05,460
It will be hard to fit that into our schedule.

2798
01:39:05,660 --> 01:39:08,129
We will need to discuss it.

2799
01:39:08,130 --> 01:39:09,630
(Further discussion is required.)

2800
01:39:10,100 --> 01:39:12,740
(The collaboration with the big company wasn't easy.)

2801
01:39:13,100 --> 01:39:15,286
I think we will need to listen to what the company thinks.

2802
01:39:15,310 --> 01:39:18,940
(The mediation continued as a lot of people needed to contribute.)

2803
01:39:19,140 --> 01:39:20,779
- Just to fool us, - We were told it was a pop-up.

2804
01:39:20,780 --> 01:39:22,249
A pop-up store was made from scratch...

2805
01:39:22,250 --> 01:39:23,579
- for Sixth Sense.
- Right.

2806
01:39:23,580 --> 01:39:24,649
That was what it felt like.

2807
01:39:24,650 --> 01:39:27,350
What we're thinking is why go this far for this?

2808
01:39:27,450 --> 01:39:28,919
(Let's make the pop-up store!)

2809
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:31,260
(Finally, the collaboration with Nongshim came true.)

2810
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:33,489
(We visited the Nongshim R and D center a few days later.)

2811
01:39:33,490 --> 01:39:35,259
(Restricted Area)

2812
01:39:35,260 --> 01:39:36,960
Let's lift it slightly.

2813
01:39:39,460 --> 01:39:40,999
What is that?

2814
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,706
(What is this machine coming out from the restricted area?)

2815
01:39:42,730 --> 01:39:44,010
It's the machine we saw earlier.

2816
01:39:44,070 --> 01:39:46,140
Right. That machine!

2817
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:48,540
I thought that couldn't be fake.

2818
01:39:49,070 --> 01:39:51,116
(The machine that was in the center of the pop-up stage)

2819
01:39:51,140 --> 01:39:52,979
(The main character of the pop-up store...)

2820
01:39:52,980 --> 01:39:55,610
(that seals the lid)

2821
01:39:55,810 --> 01:39:59,049
It was the first time a machine from the development center...

2822
01:39:59,050 --> 01:40:00,190
was taken out.

2823
01:40:00,290 --> 01:40:01,449
- My gosh.
- Really?

2824
01:40:01,450 --> 01:40:02,949
That was where it was from!

2825
01:40:02,950 --> 01:40:04,359
- No way!
- The development center.

2826
01:40:04,360 --> 01:40:06,120
Gosh, my head hurts!

2827
01:40:06,930 --> 01:40:08,429
That's amazing.

2828
01:40:08,430 --> 01:40:10,236
(Taken out of the development center for the first time in 60 years)

2829
01:40:10,260 --> 01:40:13,129
(A total of 6 men must get together to move it.)

2830
01:40:13,130 --> 01:40:15,970
Sixth Sense made this possible.

2831
01:40:16,700 --> 01:40:19,139
To provide joy to a lot of people,

2832
01:40:19,140 --> 01:40:21,020
a total of 6,000 servings of ramyeon was given.

2833
01:40:22,140 --> 01:40:26,110
(A great act of support that lives up to the company's name)

2834
01:40:26,380 --> 01:40:27,679
- Gosh.
- What a twist.

2835
01:40:27,680 --> 01:40:28,909
(Stunned)

2836
01:40:28,910 --> 01:40:30,379
(Having mixed feelings)

2837
01:40:30,380 --> 01:40:33,050
- They worked with the company.
- No way.

2838
01:40:33,250 --> 01:40:36,320
(The spot that will realize the pop-up store)

2839
01:40:36,790 --> 01:40:39,359
So it was actually a snack bar?

2840
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:40,360
My gosh.

2841
01:40:40,361 --> 01:40:44,200
(A regular snack bar that sold instant tteokbokki)

2842
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:48,229
So the pop-up store itself was fake.

2843
01:40:48,230 --> 01:40:49,329
(A great move of items to turn it into a pop-up store)

2844
01:40:49,330 --> 01:40:51,376
(2 types of noodles, 16 toppings, 4 types of seasoning)

2845
01:40:51,400 --> 01:40:54,239
(My Own Ramyeon set up)

2846
01:40:54,240 --> 01:40:57,240
(However, this wasn't it.)

2847
01:40:57,610 --> 01:40:59,379
(Sixth Sense has returned!)

2848
01:40:59,380 --> 01:41:00,410
Gosh.

2849
01:41:01,850 --> 01:41:03,750
- What?
- That's amazing.

2850
01:41:04,420 --> 01:41:05,479
(Pop-up character designs to match the theme)

2851
01:41:05,480 --> 01:41:07,690
- They were all designed.
- I'm getting goosebumps.

2852
01:41:08,120 --> 01:41:09,950
These could be colored.

2853
01:41:10,190 --> 01:41:12,419
(Cup ramyeon package, menu, custom design)

2854
01:41:12,420 --> 01:41:13,589
I'm getting goosebumps.

2855
01:41:13,590 --> 01:41:15,929
This is just unbelievable.

2856
01:41:15,930 --> 01:41:17,599
It felt so off.

2857
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:19,800
It felt too obvious.

2858
01:41:19,860 --> 01:41:21,899
We'll cover all of these up.

2859
01:41:21,900 --> 01:41:24,769
- Gosh, that's amazing.
- There was even the Art Team.

2860
01:41:24,770 --> 01:41:26,969
(Drilling and sawing every day)

2861
01:41:26,970 --> 01:41:28,539
(Set Team, experts of quick and precise construction)

2862
01:41:28,540 --> 01:41:29,540
The Set Team.

2863
01:41:29,740 --> 01:41:32,110
How was that made? It tasted so good.

2864
01:41:32,280 --> 01:41:33,549
(Dishes from previous seasons)

2865
01:41:33,550 --> 01:41:36,109
(The heart of taste development that fooled the members every season)

2866
01:41:36,110 --> 01:41:37,819
That was how it was able to mesmerize Jae Seok's taste.

2867
01:41:37,820 --> 01:41:40,250
- The army stew ramyeon.
- No wonder.

2868
01:41:40,820 --> 01:41:42,550
My gosh.

2869
01:41:43,020 --> 01:41:44,519
(The most teams...)

2870
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:46,789
(and the most meetings)

2871
01:41:46,790 --> 01:41:47,929
(Sixth Sense full capacity in use)

2872
01:41:47,930 --> 01:41:49,230
- No way.
- Gosh.

2873
01:41:50,090 --> 01:41:52,129
So this was prepared two months ago.

2874
01:41:52,130 --> 01:41:53,130
Right.

2875
01:41:53,730 --> 01:41:55,729
(Everyone's efforts were put together.)

2876
01:41:55,730 --> 01:41:56,799
- Gosh.
- There's nothing you can do...

2877
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:59,370
- but to fall for this.
- It was a complete change.

2878
01:41:59,570 --> 01:42:00,909
When you get to work in the morning,

2879
01:42:00,910 --> 01:42:03,109
you have to turn the machine on and heat up the water.

2880
01:42:03,110 --> 01:42:05,040
You just need to turn on the compressor.

2881
01:42:05,240 --> 01:42:07,710
Who would think that to be fake?

2882
01:42:07,810 --> 01:42:09,609
- Right.
- It doesn't matter if it's left on.

2883
01:42:09,610 --> 01:42:10,819
But if it turns off...

2884
01:42:10,820 --> 01:42:12,449
It was a new experience.

2885
01:42:12,450 --> 01:42:13,989
It was fun and fascinating.

2886
01:42:13,990 --> 01:42:15,689
They all enjoyed...

2887
01:42:15,690 --> 01:42:18,689
making their own memorable ramyeon.

2888
01:42:18,690 --> 01:42:21,660
The children that came with their parents especially loved it.

2889
01:42:21,730 --> 01:42:23,160
Even if it took 30 minutes...

2890
01:42:23,260 --> 01:42:25,229
to an hour at most,

2891
01:42:25,230 --> 01:42:27,770
they all worked hard to design their own ramyeon.

2892
01:42:28,070 --> 01:42:29,600
While getting ready for this,

2893
01:42:29,870 --> 01:42:31,970
I didn't expect it to be this tough.

2894
01:42:32,040 --> 01:42:33,569
The consumers enjoyed it...

2895
01:42:33,570 --> 01:42:36,109
and left their reviews.

2896
01:42:36,110 --> 01:42:37,939
It was fascinating to see,

2897
01:42:37,940 --> 01:42:40,950
and I enjoyed seeing how this project worked.

2898
01:42:41,550 --> 01:42:42,550
(The customers enjoyed it.)

2899
01:42:42,551 --> 01:42:44,119
It was actually open to people.

2900
01:42:44,120 --> 01:42:47,690
(Comedienne Min Kyoung also visited.)

2901
01:42:48,050 --> 01:42:49,119
(Total subscribers, 606,000)

2902
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:51,460
(Even a great influencer visited.)

2903
01:42:52,490 --> 01:42:55,989
(The fake pop-up was promoted unexpectedly.)

2904
01:42:55,990 --> 01:42:57,599
They are our models.

2905
01:42:57,600 --> 01:42:59,630
They seem to be clueless.

2906
01:43:00,230 --> 01:43:02,629
Who would be able to figure that out?

2907
01:43:02,630 --> 01:43:04,099
(Anything Ramyeon, fake)

2908
01:43:04,100 --> 01:43:05,640
My gosh!

2909
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:08,109
(Silence)

2910
01:43:08,110 --> 01:43:09,369
- Gosh.
- You did...

2911
01:43:09,370 --> 01:43:11,240
a collaboration with Nongshim.

2912
01:43:11,910 --> 01:43:13,110
Seriously.

2913
01:43:13,380 --> 01:43:15,410
You have to get it solved within tvN.

2914
01:43:15,710 --> 01:43:18,380
Why get onto the back of a big company?

2915
01:43:18,520 --> 01:43:20,450
This is really giving me goosebumps.

2916
01:43:20,890 --> 01:43:22,489
I knew something was off since the Toowoomba pasta.

2917
01:43:22,490 --> 01:43:24,530
It's not the Pumba pasta. It's the Toowoomba pasta.

2918
01:43:24,660 --> 01:43:25,660
This is what a Pumba is.

2919
01:43:25,661 --> 01:43:28,089
It's the person that dances like this.

2920
01:43:28,090 --> 01:43:30,299
- Right.
- The Toowoomba pasta.

2921
01:43:30,300 --> 01:43:32,829
- But this was impossible to guess.
- Right.

2922
01:43:32,830 --> 01:43:35,999
- How did you get it, Mimi?
- I'm curious too.

2923
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,969
It totally felt like number three.

2924
01:43:38,970 --> 01:43:40,510
This was what you said.

2925
01:43:40,740 --> 01:43:42,309
- What did I say?
- You didn't like the fact...

2926
01:43:42,310 --> 01:43:44,740
that the big company took over Samseong-dong.

2927
01:43:44,910 --> 01:43:47,379
How were we supposed to agree with you with that?

2928
01:43:47,380 --> 01:43:49,210
Right. You should've...

2929
01:43:49,310 --> 01:43:50,949
persuaded us better.

2930
01:43:50,950 --> 01:43:52,520
I'm a terrible speaker.

2931
01:43:52,820 --> 01:43:54,119
- Gosh, what has just happened?
- Seriously.

2932
01:43:54,120 --> 01:43:56,150
I'll pick since I got the penalty last week.

2933
01:43:56,290 --> 01:43:57,459
Okay.

2934
01:43:57,460 --> 01:44:00,359
- A cringy post must be put up.
- A cringy post must be written.

2935
01:44:00,360 --> 01:44:01,859
No explanations can be made for 24 hours.

2936
01:44:01,860 --> 01:44:03,130
That's just awful.

2937
01:44:03,330 --> 01:44:05,260
I just wish for it not to be me.

2938
01:44:06,130 --> 01:44:07,200
It's Hwasa.

2939
01:44:08,130 --> 01:44:09,529
(Happy)

2940

2943
01:44:17,440 --> 01:44:18,809
(It's fine if it isn't me!)

2944
01:44:18,810 --> 01:44:19,839
Gosh.

2945
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:21,249
I've never posted anything like that before.

2946
01:44:21,250 --> 01:44:22,890
Write something about the falling leaves.

2979

He's so blunt.

2981
01:45:34,790 --> 01:45:36,719
