00:00:29,426 --> 00:00:32,456
(The plants started coming alive, signaling the start of spring.)

2
00:00:33,896 --> 00:00:39,236
(A cozy and peaceful village)

3
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:42,536
(Something is set up in the middle of nowhere?)

4
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:47,046
(A coffee truck to cheer for our Sixth Sense members)

5
00:00:47,406 --> 00:00:50,346
(From tvN)

"'My favorite variety show' chosen by viewers."

7
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:54,685
- You're right. Oh, my.
- Oh, my.

8
00:00:54,686 --> 00:00:56,885
- That's amazing.
- That's amazing.

9
00:00:56,886 --> 00:00:58,785
- They don't do that these days.
- They really don't.

10
00:00:58,786 --> 00:01:00,625
- I've never seen this before.
- It's so cool.

11
00:01:00,626 --> 00:01:02,825
It's hard to get the love of so many people at once.

12
00:01:02,826 --> 00:01:03,826
Exactly.

13
00:01:03,827 --> 00:01:06,196
- Thank you, our viewers.
- Sir.

14
00:01:06,796 --> 00:01:08,096
We got first place.

15
00:01:08,566 --> 00:01:09,595
What's going on?

16
00:01:09,596 --> 00:01:11,335
- Hello.
- Hello.

17
00:01:11,336 --> 00:01:12,336
Sir.

18
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,405
Oh, "The number one variety show..."

19
00:01:14,406 --> 00:01:15,736
"on tvN in 2025."

20
00:01:16,406 --> 00:01:19,475
But sadly, today is the last day we're filming this show.

21
00:01:19,476 --> 00:01:21,975
- You're right. I'm sad.
- Why is it ending so fast?

22
00:01:21,976 --> 00:01:23,675
- Aren't eight episodes too little?
- Pardon?

23
00:01:23,676 --> 00:01:25,645
- We should do 200 episodes.
- Do 200 episodes?

24
00:01:25,646 --> 00:01:27,615
"We should do 200 episodes."

25
00:01:27,616 --> 00:01:29,215
If we knew this would happen, we would've done a bit more.

26
00:01:29,216 --> 00:01:30,216
Oh, right.

27
00:01:30,386 --> 00:01:31,755
Oh, I see.

28
00:01:31,756 --> 00:01:33,755
If the results were different,

29
00:01:33,756 --> 00:01:35,156
eight episodes would've felt like too much already.

30
00:01:35,686 --> 00:01:37,425
(A funny but sad situation)

31
00:01:37,426 --> 00:01:39,225
- Right.
- The company doesn't know either.

32
00:01:39,226 --> 00:01:41,366
- Right.
- It can cost more money.

33
00:01:41,826 --> 00:01:44,195
- "Wrap it up already." - Yes, wrap it up already.

34
00:01:44,196 --> 00:01:45,835
We wouldn't have been so happy either.

35
00:01:45,836 --> 00:01:46,935
Of course.

36
00:01:46,936 --> 00:01:48,235
That's how life is.

37
00:01:48,236 --> 00:01:49,975
- You're right.
- Thanks for teaching me that.

38
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:51,006
- Yes.
- Yes.

39
00:01:51,536 --> 00:01:54,238
(You must keep learning in life.)

40
00:01:54,293 --> 00:01:57,192
Now that I think about it, they sent this coffee truck...

41
00:01:57,193 --> 00:01:58,532
to the middle of a rice paddy.

42
00:01:58,533 --> 00:01:59,992
(Empty)

43
00:01:59,993 --> 00:02:01,332
We're City Tour.

44
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:02,333
I guess there was no other spot.

45
00:02:02,334 --> 00:02:06,232
That makes sense. I kept smelling mud.

46
00:02:06,233 --> 00:02:08,273
- A muddy smell.
- Yes.

47
00:02:08,773 --> 00:02:11,713
(Sixth Sense: City Tour's last destination)

48
00:02:13,413 --> 00:02:16,582

(Parks where you can fully enjoy nature)

55

(Which places in Jeonju will the Sixth Sense members visit?)

63
00:02:57,423 --> 00:02:59,092
The last episode, Jeonju.

64
00:02:59,093 --> 00:03:00,152
- Jeonju.
- Yes.

65
00:03:00,153 --> 00:03:01,162
- I'm excited.
- Jeonju...

66
00:03:01,163 --> 00:03:02,392
- I'm excited.
- Jeonju is really...

67
00:03:02,393 --> 00:03:03,393
warm.

68
00:03:03,394 --> 00:03:04,732
- Right. It really is warm.
- You're right.

69
00:03:04,733 --> 00:03:06,292
- Right?
- It feels like spring.

70
00:03:06,293 --> 00:03:07,263
What? What is this?

71
00:03:07,903 --> 00:03:10,063
There are four places today.

72
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:13,532
(Normally, there are three. There are four places on the list?)

73
00:03:13,533 --> 00:03:15,642
There's a twist. Today, you must figure out the real place.

74
00:03:15,643 --> 00:03:16,643
What?

75
00:03:16,644 --> 00:03:17,843
What? They're all fake?

76
00:03:18,943 --> 00:03:20,312
(Jaw-dropping)

77
00:03:20,313 --> 00:03:21,882
But this is even harder.

78
00:03:21,883 --> 00:03:23,442
- It's harder. Totally.
- It's harder.

79
00:03:23,443 --> 00:03:25,352
Are you saying one of these four places is real?

80
00:03:25,353 --> 00:03:26,483

- 100-Year-Old House?

106
00:04:53,284 --> 00:04:54,753
I think I know what 30 Million Bowls is.

107
00:04:54,754 --> 00:04:55,894
What is it?

108
00:04:56,294 --> 00:04:58,464
Jeonju is famous for bean sprout gukbap.

109
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:01,333
Right. I get it. Like 30 million bowls...

110
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,093
- of bean sprout gukbap?
- The bean sprout gukbap...

111
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,103
in the market is very famous.

112
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:06,563
I think they must've sold more than 30 million bowls.

113
00:05:06,564 --> 00:05:08,334
(Is the record of 30 million bowls referring to bean sprout gukbap?)

114
00:05:09,234 --> 00:05:10,503
- Shall we go?
- Yes, let's go.

115

Oh, yes.

Oh, it's really spring today.

- Right?
- You're right.

- Right.
- There's a lot to eat too.

127
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,903

- Right.

129

- I see.

- In 2004?
- Yes.

140

- Yes, her name is LEESEO.

00:07:19,804 --> 00:07:21,034
Hello.

177
00:07:21,904 --> 00:07:23,473
- She's been really busy.
- What?

178
00:07:23,474 --> 00:07:25,743
- That's right.
- Exactly.

179
00:07:25,744 --> 00:07:27,043
This. Runaway Guinea.

180
00:07:27,044 --> 00:07:28,144
(A guinea pig running away)

181
00:07:28,674 --> 00:07:29,773
(Runaway Mimi)

182
00:07:29,774 --> 00:07:31,143
(Only on Sixth Sense, Runaway Mimi and Runaway Guinea)

183
00:07:31,144 --> 00:07:33,313
- It was all the rage.
- Exactly.

184
00:07:33,314 --> 00:07:35,013
Are your promotional activities over now?

185
00:07:35,014 --> 00:07:37,114
- Yes, they're over.
- Really?

186
00:07:37,154 --> 00:07:39,423
- Once again, IVE was...
- It was all the rage.

187
00:07:39,424 --> 00:07:41,623
- all the rage.
- Thank you.

188
00:07:41,624 --> 00:07:42,624
(They successfully promoted yet another album.)

189
00:07:43,094 --> 00:07:44,094
(So cute.)

190
00:07:44,095 --> 00:07:45,264
How were things with this album?

191
00:07:46,024 --> 00:07:47,323
This time?

192
00:07:47,324 --> 00:07:48,894
Well, it was tough.

193
00:07:50,134 --> 00:07:51,603
(Oh, I see...)

194
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,203
- Well, we all know that.
- I was not expecting that response.

195
00:07:53,204 --> 00:07:54,833
- I thought she'd say, - I mean...

196
00:07:54,834 --> 00:07:56,604
- "It was great" after "thank you." - Everyone knows it's tough.

197
00:07:56,674 --> 00:07:58,743
- Oh, you two are enemies.
- We've met before.

198
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:01,014
We're not so much enemies. We just play off of each other well.

199
00:08:01,444 --> 00:08:03,144
- Yes, we do.
- We do.

200
00:08:03,474 --> 00:08:05,514
By that, do you mean one person always ends the conversation?

201
00:08:06,414 --> 00:08:08,213
That's not a bad dynamic.

202
00:08:08,214 --> 00:08:10,853
Tae Hyun always texts me when the show airs.

203
00:08:10,854 --> 00:08:11,923
I got it all wrong again yesterday.

204
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:13,423
- Where is it today?
- Did you get it wrong yesterday?

205
00:08:13,424 --> 00:08:16,123
He never... He got it wrong for a whole five weeks.

206
00:08:16,124 --> 00:08:17,354
What happened?

207
00:08:17,824 --> 00:08:18,893
(The Blunt Siblings can relate.)

208
00:08:18,894 --> 00:08:19,924
Also,

209
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:22,194
how can you lie for so long?

210
00:08:23,134 --> 00:08:24,403
Right? It's crazy, right?

211
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:26,903
- Exactly.
- How are we supposed to guess...

212
00:08:26,904 --> 00:08:28,334
- I know.
- when they lie for two months?

213
00:08:29,034 --> 00:08:30,943
Isn't that basically a crime?

214
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:31,973
They should be arrested.

215
00:08:31,974 --> 00:08:33,073
- Handcuffs and all.
- That's basically a crime.

216
00:08:33,074 --> 00:08:34,673
- It's impossible to guess.
- Exactly.

217
00:08:34,674 --> 00:08:36,374
Today, we have to find the one real place.

218
00:08:36,514 --> 00:08:38,584
This time, all places are fake except for one.

219
00:08:38,984 --> 00:08:40,013
(Confused)

220
00:08:40,014 --> 00:08:41,014
This time.

221
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:42,913
- The rules have changed.
- Oh, you're right.

222
00:08:42,914 --> 00:08:44,524
Before, you had to find the fake place.

223
00:08:44,654 --> 00:08:46,223
But we have to find the real place today?

224
00:08:46,224 --> 00:08:48,154
- Yes, the real place.
- The rules have changed.

225
00:08:49,854 --> 00:08:53,064
(Heading to 100-Year-Old House)

226
00:08:53,364 --> 00:08:54,793
Since we're looking for the real place...

227
00:08:54,794 --> 00:08:56,534
We'll find the 100-Year-Old House very quickly.

228
00:08:56,794 --> 00:08:58,833
(Laughing)

229
00:08:58,834 --> 00:09:00,733
You have very pretty ears, REI.

230
00:09:00,734 --> 00:09:02,373
- Are you jealous?
- REI isn't using tape,

231
00:09:02,374 --> 00:09:03,903
- but her ears are like this.
- Exactly.

232
00:09:03,904 --> 00:09:05,143
- My ears?
- If you don't,

233
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:07,303
- I have to.
- do they go right back down?

234
00:09:07,304 --> 00:09:08,514
Yes, they do.

235
00:09:08,774 --> 00:09:10,673
Oh, that trend?

236
00:09:10,674 --> 00:09:11,743
- Yes.
- Making your ears stand up?

237
00:09:11,744 --> 00:09:13,943
REI. Your ears stand up nicely.

238
00:09:13,944 --> 00:09:15,853
Yes, I have trendy ears.

239
00:09:15,854 --> 00:09:17,383
- Exactly.
- Oh, you already know it.

240
00:09:17,384 --> 00:09:19,354
- Yes.
- She's very proud.

241
00:09:19,754 --> 00:09:21,324
(Standing up)

242
00:09:21,754 --> 00:09:23,394
Oh, Naoi REI, seriously.

243
00:09:23,624 --> 00:09:25,324
She's the standard of trendy Gen Zers.

244
00:09:25,494 --> 00:09:27,293
- She's right.
- You're right. Her ears stand up.

245
00:09:27,294 --> 00:09:29,033
- The standard of Generation Z.
- Look at Kyoung Pyo.

246
00:09:29,034 --> 00:09:30,063
Mine...

247
00:09:30,064 --> 00:09:32,604
- Your ears are really lying down.
- Yes, they're really lying down.

248
00:09:33,104 --> 00:09:34,703
I get why Mimi does that.

249
00:09:34,704 --> 00:09:36,373
When your ears are standing up...

250
00:09:36,374 --> 00:09:38,643
It's pretty. It makes you look fancy.

251
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:40,573
- "Fancy." - Do you have some stickers left?

252
00:09:40,574 --> 00:09:41,673
I have a lot of stickers. Do you want some?

253
00:09:41,674 --> 00:09:44,073
Hey, give me some. I want to see what happens.

254
00:09:44,074 --> 00:09:45,313
- Right. I was curious too.
- Let's see.

255
00:09:45,314 --> 00:09:46,783
You should try it out too, Eun I. It's the last day today.

256
00:09:46,784 --> 00:09:48,654
- Should I?
- Flat ears are pretty too.

257
00:09:49,684 --> 00:09:51,383
- Is this it?
- Where?

258
00:09:51,384 --> 00:09:52,384
(They've arrived at the first place, the 100-Year-Old House.)

259
00:09:52,385 --> 00:09:54,954
- This is it.
- This is the 100-Year-Old House?

260
00:09:55,824 --> 00:09:56,824
Let's see.

261
00:09:57,424 --> 00:09:58,894
It does look old.

262
00:09:58,994 --> 00:10:00,823
It really does look very old.

263
00:10:00,824 --> 00:10:02,164
- Oh, my.
- Where?

264
00:10:02,534 --> 00:10:04,664
Oh, what? It's like a haunted house in the mountains.

265
00:10:04,964 --> 00:10:06,833
(A haunted house in the mountains?)

266
00:10:06,834 --> 00:10:08,073
Doesn't it kind of look...

267
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:09,273
- like "Howl's Moving Castle?" - Totally.

268
00:10:09,274 --> 00:10:10,733
("Howl's Moving Castle?")

269
00:10:10,734 --> 00:10:13,473
- Oh, it looks very old.
- Exactly.

270
00:10:13,474 --> 00:10:14,544
(What is this 100-Year-Old House hiding away from the road?)

271
00:10:14,674 --> 00:10:16,944
Oh, it's pretty. It has a nice vibe.

272
00:10:17,114 --> 00:10:19,643
- It is pretty.
- What a nice vibe.

273
00:10:19,644 --> 00:10:20,744
(The 100-Year-Old House finally comes into view.)

274
00:10:21,384 --> 00:10:24,283
(Far down a narrow road...)

275
00:10:24,284 --> 00:10:27,724
(is a house from the storybooks!)

276
00:10:28,654 --> 00:10:30,393
The house is very pretty.

277
00:10:30,394 --> 00:10:31,394
What a nice vibe.

278
00:10:31,395 --> 00:10:32,863
- The tinplate roof...
- Right?

279
00:10:32,864 --> 00:10:34,893
I can't tell if they painted it or if it's rusted.

280
00:10:34,894 --> 00:10:36,264
- I think it's been painted.
- Right?

281
00:10:36,864 --> 00:10:38,603
- It has a nice vibe.
- Right?

282
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:39,804
(The old wooden eaves and walls have a nice vibe.)

283
00:10:40,434 --> 00:10:43,374
(Traces of its 100-year-old history can be found all around.)

284
00:10:43,804 --> 00:10:46,274
(And there are even homely old objects.)

285
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:50,844
(This house seems to have come out of an animated movie.)

286
00:10:50,914 --> 00:10:54,043
The building... The building is like a grandpa.

287
00:10:54,044 --> 00:10:55,513
- Like what?
- The building...

288
00:10:55,514 --> 00:10:56,713
- is like a grandpa.
- The building is like a grandpa?

289
00:10:56,714 --> 00:10:58,084
(Innocent REI)

290
00:10:58,124 --> 00:10:59,453
People take a lot of pictures...

291
00:10:59,454 --> 00:11:00,853
on the roof from the attic.

292
00:11:00,854 --> 00:11:02,223
(The roof is a popular photo spot.)

293
00:11:02,224 --> 00:11:04,193
- Up there?
- A photo spot.

294
00:11:04,194 --> 00:11:05,323
I see.

295
00:11:05,324 --> 00:11:07,023
I think three people go up...

296
00:11:07,024 --> 00:11:08,063
- Oh, a picture like that.
- and take pictures...

297
00:11:08,064 --> 00:11:09,064
with each of their faces in a window.

298
00:11:09,065 --> 00:11:11,204
(Famous on social media for its fairytale-like looks)

299
00:11:11,334 --> 00:11:17,034
(This trendy place has become a must-visit spot in Jeonju.)

300
00:11:17,674 --> 00:11:21,873
(Is there something fake hiding in this famous Jeonju spot?)

301
00:11:21,874 --> 00:11:22,974
It's so cute.

302
00:11:23,274 --> 00:11:24,313
You're right.

303
00:11:24,314 --> 00:11:25,343
(They've fallen in love with the building's unique charms.)

304
00:11:25,344 --> 00:11:27,214
I wonder what they do here.

305
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:29,753
This here... What is this?

306
00:11:29,754 --> 00:11:31,553
There's an old machine.

307
00:11:31,554 --> 00:11:33,083
- Is this a mill?
- You're right.

308
00:11:33,084 --> 00:11:34,493
- Is this to bring in water?
- The thing in front...

309
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:35,854
is a mill, right?

310
00:11:36,324 --> 00:11:38,723
- Oh, a motor?
- Doesn't this bring in water?

311
00:11:38,724 --> 00:11:40,294
(Is the old machine a motor to move water?)

312
00:11:40,864 --> 00:11:43,894
(Is this a 100-year-old mill?)

313
00:11:44,134 --> 00:11:45,564
Oh, this is fake.

314
00:11:46,604 --> 00:11:49,434
They made this place like a museum.

315
00:11:49,774 --> 00:11:52,043
It does seem a bit artificial.

316
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,474
It looks kind of cool like a movie set.

317
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:56,673
- Yes, totally.
- That's how it feels. Yes.

318
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,283
- Should we go inside?
- Yes.

319
00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:59,343
(They're growing more curious about this 100-Year-Old House.)

320
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,453
Is this house made out of mud?

321
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:02,554
(Entering with curiosity)

322
00:12:03,354 --> 00:12:04,824
(I see.)

323
00:12:05,754 --> 00:12:08,324
- Oh, it's a tea house.
- Oh, it's a cafe.

324
00:12:08,554 --> 00:12:09,693
What a nice atmosphere.

325
00:12:09,694 --> 00:12:11,394
- It smells so good.
- Oh, the smell of date tea.

326
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:12,764
- Amazing.
- Isn't it so nice?

327
00:12:12,864 --> 00:12:14,534
Seriously. It's so nice.

328
00:12:15,394 --> 00:12:16,763
- The smell...
- This place must be so nice...

329
00:12:16,764 --> 00:12:18,133
and warm if you come during wintertime.

330
00:12:18,134 --> 00:12:19,164
(A warm interior that feels like an old house)

331
00:12:20,664 --> 00:12:21,733
Oh, this is so nice.

332
00:12:21,734 --> 00:12:24,904
(It feels like you've stepped into a fairytale.)

333
00:12:26,844 --> 00:12:27,874
So fun.

334
00:12:28,074 --> 00:12:30,574
You can order coffee here and then look around.

335
00:12:31,444 --> 00:12:33,443
There are these old pictures.

336
00:12:33,444 --> 00:12:36,914
I think these things could be 100 years old.

337
00:12:39,354 --> 00:12:44,624
(Is there something fake hiding in here?)

338
00:12:46,024 --> 00:12:47,564
Oh, some keys actually sound.

339
00:12:50,334 --> 00:12:51,564
Is this a working piano?

340
00:12:52,504 --> 00:12:55,134
Hey, this is a piano from the Late Period of Joseon.

341
00:12:55,404 --> 00:12:56,773
- What?
- This is a piano...

342
00:12:56,774 --> 00:12:58,143
from the Late Period of Joseon.

343
00:12:58,144 --> 00:12:59,274
Oh, really?

344
00:12:59,674 --> 00:13:01,644
It says it was manufactured in Cincinnati.

345
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:02,974
This piano was.

346
00:13:04,274 --> 00:13:10,014
(A 100-year-old piano from Daehan Empire days)

347
00:13:10,514 --> 00:13:12,924
(The first Bible published during the Joseon era)

348
00:13:13,424 --> 00:13:16,124
(The 2-tiered cabinets made in the late Joseon era)

349
00:13:16,454 --> 00:13:18,793
Is this a public phone?

350
00:13:18,794 --> 00:13:20,023
(Oh, my!)

351
00:13:20,024 --> 00:13:22,563
Do you know what this is? This is quite a pretty one.

352
00:13:22,564 --> 00:13:24,194
(A nostalgic public phone from the 70s and 80s)

353
00:13:24,294 --> 00:13:26,363
I think we had those until I was in elementary school.

354
00:13:26,364 --> 00:13:27,364
- Really?
- Yes.

355
00:13:27,365 --> 00:13:28,774
I had never seen one that looks like this.

356
00:13:29,604 --> 00:13:32,404
- It kind of feels like a museum.
- It does.

357
00:13:33,344 --> 00:13:35,874
(As if time stopped 100 years ago)

358
00:13:36,674 --> 00:13:39,213
How did they gather all of these things?

359
00:13:39,214 --> 00:13:40,544
(Displayed in the 100-Year-Old House...)

360
00:13:40,884 --> 00:13:43,454
(are beautiful antique items.)

361
00:13:43,754 --> 00:13:45,424
This heater is working.

362
00:13:45,924 --> 00:13:47,053
A fireplace.

363
00:13:47,054 --> 00:13:48,654
Oh, my. It's really nice.

364
00:13:49,224 --> 00:13:52,823
(A nostalgic tin lunchbox on top of the heater)

365
00:13:52,824 --> 00:13:54,633
Hey. Do you know what this is, Mimi?

366
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:55,894
- Oh, a lunchbox!
- This...

367
00:13:56,094 --> 00:13:58,563
- This...
- I saw it on "Black Rubber Shoes."

368
00:13:58,564 --> 00:14:00,603
- "Black Rubber Shoes." - "Black Rubber Shoes."

369
00:14:00,604 --> 00:14:02,973
(Black rubber shoes)

370
00:14:02,974 --> 00:14:03,974
Do you know what this is, REI?

371
00:14:03,975 --> 00:14:05,073
- No.
- You don't know this, right?

372
00:14:05,074 --> 00:14:07,303
Back in the way, we used to bring our own lunches to school.

373
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:08,314
In lunchboxes like this.

374
00:14:08,374 --> 00:14:09,973
- The food gets cold, right?
- Right.

375
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:13,143
So the kids used to put it on top of the heater...

376
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:14,184
- I see.
- like this.

377
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:17,824
(Nostalgic memories of sharing your lunch)

378
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,753
This spot is the best, right?

379
00:14:19,754 --> 00:14:20,924
This one gets burnt.

380
00:14:21,524 --> 00:14:23,723
So which spot does the best fighter take?

381
00:14:23,724 --> 00:14:25,594
The kids who are good at fighting don't bring their own lunches.

382
00:14:27,024 --> 00:14:28,194
Just a fork.

383
00:14:28,864 --> 00:14:29,993
- Oh, really?
- The well-mannered ones...

384
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,094
at least bring their own forks.

385
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:33,103
- I see.
- The good fighters...

386
00:14:33,104 --> 00:14:34,264
- don't bring their own lunches.
- Exactly.

387
00:14:35,434 --> 00:14:37,334
- Should we go upstairs?
- Yes.

388
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,144
(Oh, my!)

389
00:14:39,474 --> 00:14:41,474
Oh, it's totally an attic!

390
00:14:42,344 --> 00:14:43,443
(Oh, my!)

391
00:14:43,444 --> 00:14:44,514
My goodness.

392
00:14:45,144 --> 00:14:46,214
Oh, this is amazing!

393
00:14:46,684 --> 00:14:49,784
(Cozy)

394
00:14:50,714 --> 00:14:53,083
(When you go up the stairs, )

395
00:14:53,084 --> 00:14:55,823
(you find a secret room on the 2nd floor.)

396
00:14:55,824 --> 00:14:57,453
- This is amazing.
- They even have comic books.

397
00:14:57,454 --> 00:14:58,623
They have comic books.

398
00:14:58,624 --> 00:14:59,663
(From comic books to movie posters, this room is full of cool things.)

399
00:14:59,664 --> 00:15:00,864
This is fun!

400
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:05,304
Hello, everyone!

401
00:15:06,264 --> 00:15:07,764
Hello!

402
00:15:08,234 --> 00:15:11,443
This is nice. This is great for taking pictures.

403
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:12,503
Totally.

404
00:15:12,504 --> 00:15:14,874
(Imitating the pictures popular on social media)

405
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,474
Can you go up even more?

406
00:15:16,514 --> 00:15:19,014
Yes, I saw that there was one more floor above this.

407
00:15:19,144 --> 00:15:20,543
- Another one?
- Yes.

408
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:21,613
It's an attic.

409
00:15:21,614 --> 00:15:22,684
(There is an attic on the 3rd floor.)

410
00:15:23,484 --> 00:15:25,253
(Oh, my!)

411
00:15:25,254 --> 00:15:26,254
How is it?

412
00:15:26,255 --> 00:15:27,993
- Is it scary?
- This is totally that.

413
00:15:27,994 --> 00:15:29,124
Is it an attic?

414
00:15:29,454 --> 00:15:31,364
Oh, my! Come up here!

415
00:15:31,624 --> 00:15:33,763
There are erotic things here!

416
00:15:33,764 --> 00:15:35,663
- Where?
- Erotic things?

417
00:15:35,664 --> 00:15:36,694
Get out of my way!

418
00:15:37,634 --> 00:15:39,904
(Our imagination queen is in a hurry.)

419
00:15:40,164 --> 00:15:41,833
- What does "erotic" mean?
- What erotic things?

420
00:15:41,834 --> 00:15:42,904
- Suggestive?
- Oh, my!

421
00:15:42,974 --> 00:15:44,874
- Suggestive.
- This place is the best!

422
00:15:45,004 --> 00:15:46,243
(A room for adults hiding in the fairytale land)

423
00:15:46,244 --> 00:15:48,014
Oh, this is an X-rated room!

424
00:15:48,244 --> 00:15:49,373
(Don't wear lipstick on a lonely day.)

425
00:15:49,374 --> 00:15:51,843
(Full of movie posters that are sensual but old-fashioned)

426
00:15:51,844 --> 00:15:54,513
(I want her right now.)

427
00:15:54,514 --> 00:15:56,713
(Her betrayal started with "No.")

428
00:15:56,714 --> 00:15:58,654
This is an X-rated room!

429
00:15:59,324 --> 00:16:00,883
This is an X-rated room!

430
00:16:00,884 --> 00:16:02,693
Oh, this really is an X-rated room!

431
00:16:02,694 --> 00:16:04,794
(Happy?)

432
00:16:04,994 --> 00:16:06,824
It's so sensual. Hold on.

433
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:10,363
- Oh, my.
- Oh, what is this?

434
00:16:10,364 --> 00:16:11,433
This...

435
00:16:11,434 --> 00:16:13,334
(Hyper focused)

436
00:16:13,864 --> 00:16:14,934
What is it?

437
00:16:16,234 --> 00:16:17,704
- A chivalric romance story.
- I see.

438
00:16:17,904 --> 00:16:20,203
- These are old movie posters.
- You need to see them.

439
00:16:20,204 --> 00:16:21,474
This is an X-rated room.

440
00:16:21,574 --> 00:16:22,673
(Smiling widely)

441
00:16:22,674 --> 00:16:24,244
Oh, this is so fascinating.

442
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,743
- This is an X-rated room.
- An X-rated room. "Lipstick."

443
00:16:27,744 --> 00:16:28,814
An X-rated room.

444
00:16:29,584 --> 00:16:31,283
(Jae Seok and REI head down to the 1st floor first.)

445
00:16:31,284 --> 00:16:32,484
- Let's go down.
- Okay.

446
00:16:33,054 --> 00:16:34,423
What do you think, REI? Does this look 100 years old?

447
00:16:34,424 --> 00:16:37,393
- I don't think it's 100 years old.
- Really?

448
00:16:37,394 --> 00:16:38,624
Maybe 70 years old?

449
00:16:39,364 --> 00:16:40,364
Maybe 70...

450
00:16:40,724 --> 00:16:43,294
- Not 100 years?
- No. About 70?

451
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:46,203
- I think it's about 95 years old.
- Right.

452
00:16:46,204 --> 00:16:47,734
(Dumb and Dumber)

453
00:16:47,934 --> 00:16:50,674
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

454
00:16:50,834 --> 00:16:52,544
Is this place 100 years old?

455
00:16:53,204 --> 00:16:54,604
It's a 100-year-old rice mill.

456
00:16:55,074 --> 00:16:56,344
- A rice mill?
- Yes.

457
00:16:56,944 --> 00:16:59,544
They used to process rice...

458
00:16:59,944 --> 00:17:01,144
at this rice mill.

459
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:04,484
- Oh, a rice processing mill.
- That's right.

460
00:17:05,754 --> 00:17:08,194
I'm the owner of Saekjang Rice Mill,

461
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:09,924
Lee Eui Man.

462
00:17:10,724 --> 00:17:13,763
This building was built in the 1920s.

463
00:17:13,764 --> 00:17:15,594
This was a rice mill...

464
00:17:15,894 --> 00:17:17,593
where they processed rice.

465
00:17:17,594 --> 00:17:18,804
(Korean Grain Processing Association Imsil Country Branch)

466
00:17:19,264 --> 00:17:21,534
(The machine they saw out front was the rice mill motor.)

467
00:17:22,034 --> 00:17:25,574
(They used to use this motor to run the rice mill.)

468
00:17:26,404 --> 00:17:29,214
(It was used to remove the hull of the rice grains.)

469
00:17:29,814 --> 00:17:33,114
(The rice mill was always busy during harvesting season.)

470
00:17:33,284 --> 00:17:36,414
My wife came here to sketch this place,

471
00:17:36,754 --> 00:17:40,084
and we ended up buying it because it was very pretty.

472
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,353
(Inside, they display Mr. Lee's collection of items.)

473
00:17:41,354 --> 00:17:42,853
I started to collect items...

474
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:45,164
from our recent history...

475
00:17:45,894 --> 00:17:47,724
around 100 years ago,

476
00:17:47,824 --> 00:17:50,663
and I ended up with about 300 items.

477
00:17:50,664 --> 00:17:53,303
(Somewhere over 300 items)

478
00:17:53,304 --> 00:17:56,604
The people who come here say "It feels like a Ghibli movie."

479
00:17:56,904 --> 00:17:58,704
"It's like 'Howl's Moving Castle.'"

480
00:17:59,174 --> 00:18:01,203
People seem to feel that the atmosphere here...

481
00:18:01,204 --> 00:18:02,843
is like that of animated movies or fairytales.

482
00:18:02,844 --> 00:18:03,844
(It's popular as a cafe from animated movies or fairytales.)

483
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:08,214
(And the main item on the menu at this 100-Year-Old House!)

484
00:18:08,514 --> 00:18:11,254
We came up with this for the people...

485
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:14,484
who are looking for something unusual.

486
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:16,793
Most of our customers...

487
00:18:16,794 --> 00:18:19,224
are young people who are on dates.

488
00:18:19,824 --> 00:18:23,064
I think they come here a lot for that unusual atmosphere.

489
00:18:24,694 --> 00:18:28,104
(Is there something fake hiding in this trendy place?)

490
00:18:28,834 --> 00:18:31,034
So for how long have you been running this cafe?

491
00:18:31,134 --> 00:18:33,174
It's been about ten years.

492
00:18:33,844 --> 00:18:35,974
- This was almost a run-down house.
- Right.

493
00:18:36,244 --> 00:18:38,383
I worked with people who restore cultural sites...

494
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:40,884
to bring it back to its original state.

495
00:18:40,984 --> 00:18:43,353
- So it was deserted for a while?
- Yes.

496
00:18:43,354 --> 00:18:45,354
(The rice mill transformed into a trendy cafe.)

497
00:18:45,484 --> 00:18:48,753
The date tea smells really good.

498
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:49,754
Do you want a cup?

499
00:18:50,194 --> 00:18:51,194
It's a kabocha ssanghwatang.

500
00:18:52,124 --> 00:18:54,464
We should have that. Kabocha ssanghwatang, please.

501
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,204
Eun I should get this old pumpkin ssanghwatang.

502
00:18:58,564 --> 00:19:01,473
- That one?
- One warm pumpkin ssanghwatang.

503
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:04,174
(He ordered their signature item, the pumpkin ssanghwatang sets.)

504
00:19:05,104 --> 00:19:06,973
(Meanwhile, they still haven't left the 3rd floor yet.)

505
00:19:06,974 --> 00:19:08,043
- Should we go down?
- But...

506
00:19:08,044 --> 00:19:10,973
this is really sensual, right? Would they have...

507
00:19:10,974 --> 00:19:13,744
used these sensual posters just to make a fake place?

508
00:19:13,884 --> 00:19:15,884
You're right. Did they really have to...

509
00:19:16,354 --> 00:19:18,154
decorate this room this way?

510
00:19:19,184 --> 00:19:21,154
This is so sensual.

511
00:19:21,254 --> 00:19:22,824
Why do you keep obsessing over sensual things?

512
00:19:23,154 --> 00:19:25,394
- They're totally naked in this one.
- Right.

513
00:19:25,494 --> 00:19:26,524
Oh, my.

514
00:19:27,664 --> 00:19:29,433
"Don't wear lipstick on a lonely day."

515
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:30,594
That's a bit...

516
00:19:31,434 --> 00:19:33,434
That's quite intense.

517
00:19:33,604 --> 00:19:36,474
- "The woman who opens autumn." - Mimi. Let's go downstairs now.

518
00:19:36,834 --> 00:19:39,144
I think we're staying here for too long.

519
00:19:39,574 --> 00:19:41,303
I want to stay here.

520
00:19:41,304 --> 00:19:43,113
Really? Why do you want to stay here?

521
00:19:43,114 --> 00:19:44,273
I feel like I'll be introduced...

522
00:19:44,274 --> 00:19:45,444
- to a new world.
- A new world?

523
00:19:46,684 --> 00:19:48,883
- Hey, CEO Song.
- Yes?

524
00:19:48,884 --> 00:19:50,953
- I ordered a kabocha drink.
- Sounds good.

525
00:19:50,954 --> 00:19:51,954
Sounds good.

526
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:55,254
Things like this look 100 years old to me.

527
00:19:55,354 --> 00:19:58,123
- They're not.
- This...

528
00:19:58,124 --> 00:20:00,464
- Does this not look 100 years old?
- No.

529
00:20:00,764 --> 00:20:02,633
- Then how old?
- About 70 years old?

530
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:04,194
- Why do you keep saying 70?
- About 70.

531
00:20:04,834 --> 00:20:06,463
Why do you keep saying 70?

532
00:20:06,464 --> 00:20:07,904
I've become fixated on the number.

533
00:20:09,004 --> 00:20:12,003
- But I kind of felt the same way.
- Right?

534
00:20:12,004 --> 00:20:15,273
- I think it's only 80 or 90 years.
- Oh, really? Only 80 or 90 years?

535
00:20:15,274 --> 00:20:17,343
- Jae Seok.
- You think it's 80 or 90 years old?

536
00:20:17,344 --> 00:20:19,184
- Yes, I think so.
- Forget it.

537
00:20:20,984 --> 00:20:22,413
I don't think it's 100 years old.

538
00:20:22,414 --> 00:20:25,283
- Sit down for now.
- It needs to be a full 100, right?

539
00:20:25,284 --> 00:20:26,554
- Right.
- Right.

540
00:20:26,984 --> 00:20:29,654
With all due respect, are we not really eating today?

541
00:20:30,094 --> 00:20:31,493
- Why?
- I've been fasting...

542
00:20:31,494 --> 00:20:32,663
since last night.

543
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:34,624
(To eat a lot today)

544
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:36,763
- You'll eat at the next place.
- Oh, we will?

545
00:20:36,764 --> 00:20:38,763
- Seriously.
- I wanted...

546
00:20:38,764 --> 00:20:39,963
- to ask too!
- Oh, seriously.

547
00:20:39,964 --> 00:20:42,934
- I was getting hungry.
- Come on. What are you doing?

548
00:20:44,504 --> 00:20:47,143
We were all looking around trying to find something fake.

549
00:20:47,144 --> 00:20:48,573
- Oh, I'm so hungry.
- Kyoung Pyo...

550
00:20:48,574 --> 00:20:49,943
(I love food the most.)

551
00:20:49,944 --> 00:20:51,744
What time did you eat dinner last night?

552
00:20:51,944 --> 00:20:53,743
Me? Around 4.

553
00:20:53,744 --> 00:20:54,744
- Around 4?
- Yes.

554
00:20:54,745 --> 00:20:55,754
- Dinner?
- Yes.

555
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:58,053
- I only ate 1 meal yesterday.
- You've fasted for 24 hours.

556
00:20:58,054 --> 00:21:00,624
- Right.
- So you're not swollen at all.

557
00:21:03,294 --> 00:21:05,964
(The slimmest he will be today)

558
00:21:06,294 --> 00:21:07,364
Your hands are so...

559
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:11,163
Your hands... Oh, my.

560
00:21:11,164 --> 00:21:12,833
- They're chunky, aren't they?
- Seriously.

561
00:21:12,834 --> 00:21:15,103
- His ancestors were all strong.
- Seriously.

562
00:21:15,104 --> 00:21:17,273
Kyoung Pyo. Weren't there any strong men in your family?

563
00:21:17,274 --> 00:21:19,303
My father is a businessman.

564
00:21:19,304 --> 00:21:20,643
- Right?
- Yes.

565
00:21:20,644 --> 00:21:22,013
His hands are so impressive.

566
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:23,713
You said your father ran a business.

567
00:21:23,714 --> 00:21:26,743
- He runs a makguksu store.
- Right.

568
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,144
- After he retired.
- Yes.

569
00:21:28,784 --> 00:21:31,183
I think this place is 100 years old.

570
00:21:31,184 --> 00:21:33,253
But I think they were saying some part of it was fake.

571
00:21:33,254 --> 00:21:34,453
Oh, is that it?

572
00:21:34,454 --> 00:21:35,523
The menu could be fake.

573
00:21:35,524 --> 00:21:37,154
- The owner could be fake.
- Other things are fake? I see.

574
00:21:37,354 --> 00:21:39,824
So basically, all but one place has been contaminated.

575
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:41,493
- Oh, contaminated.
- Oh, all but one place.

576
00:21:41,494 --> 00:21:43,634
- They used the word "contaminated." - One place is totally original.

577
00:21:43,734 --> 00:21:45,134
"Contaminated."

578
00:21:45,634 --> 00:21:48,673
So this whole cafe could be fake.

579
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:51,403
- Right. It could not be a cafe.
- It could not be a cafe.

580
00:21:51,404 --> 00:21:54,173
- You're right.
- So those two...

581
00:21:54,174 --> 00:21:56,414
might not belong here.

582
00:21:56,814 --> 00:22:00,314
(Is the owner a fake that the crew planted?)

583
00:22:00,884 --> 00:22:03,584
- Oh, then this place is fake.
- Why?

584
00:22:03,814 --> 00:22:04,884
Just because.

585
00:22:06,724 --> 00:22:09,254
I'm confused. This is our first time being on the same show.

586
00:22:09,754 --> 00:22:10,823
This is how REI is.

587
00:22:10,824 --> 00:22:13,524
- Oh, really?
- She doesn't hide what she thinks.

588
00:22:13,964 --> 00:22:15,194
She's just like a kid.

589
00:22:17,034 --> 00:22:19,033
- We are father and daughter.
- You are.

590
00:22:19,034 --> 00:22:20,064
- You're right.
- It's so accurate.

591
00:22:20,304 --> 00:22:22,434
Because kids are always like that.

592
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:23,934
Oh, what?

593
00:22:24,434 --> 00:22:25,944
The things here... What?

594
00:22:27,074 --> 00:22:28,074
What is that?

595
00:22:28,774 --> 00:22:31,014
That's a whole... What is that?

596
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:33,344
Why is that so big?

597
00:22:34,744 --> 00:22:36,254
That could be fake.

598
00:22:38,654 --> 00:22:41,824
(What did they see?)

599
00:22:42,035 --> 00:22:43,165
Why is that so big?

600
00:22:44,605 --> 00:22:46,035
That could be fake.

601
00:22:48,545 --> 00:22:51,075
(What did they see?)

602
00:22:51,405 --> 00:22:52,474
Hello.

603
00:22:52,475 --> 00:22:54,115
(Something very huge)

604
00:22:54,475 --> 00:22:55,845
What is this, sir?

605
00:22:56,385 --> 00:22:57,715
It's the pumpkin ssanghwatang.

606
00:22:59,485 --> 00:23:01,284
- It's the pumpkin ssanghwatang.
- It's a real pumpkin.

607
00:23:01,285 --> 00:23:02,325
(A whole giant pumpkin?)

608
00:23:03,185 --> 00:23:04,855
(Oh, my!)

609
00:23:05,225 --> 00:23:06,955
- Oh, my!
- Oh, my!

610
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:09,295
- Oh, like this?
- Oh, this is the pumpkin...

611
00:23:09,895 --> 00:23:12,035
- Oh, hold on.
- Oh, my.

612
00:23:12,535 --> 00:23:13,595
Oh, this is the pumpkin...

613
00:23:13,965 --> 00:23:16,104
- It's pumpkin ssanghwatang.
- This is amazing.

614
00:23:16,105 --> 00:23:19,035
(Open the pumpkin top to find ssanghwatang inside!)

615
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:24,545
(Giant old pumpkin ssanghwatang)

616
00:23:26,575 --> 00:23:28,284
I'm always trying to think...

617
00:23:28,285 --> 00:23:30,244
of new menu items...

618
00:23:30,245 --> 00:23:32,315
that fit this cafe.

619
00:23:33,485 --> 00:23:35,455
We've always made ssanghwatang,

620
00:23:35,685 --> 00:23:36,984
but I wanted to make something a bit more unusual.

621
00:23:36,985 --> 00:23:38,054
(A special item made by Mr. Lee for the 100-Year-Old House)

622
00:23:38,055 --> 00:23:40,995
That's why I made this interesting drink.

623
00:23:41,695 --> 00:23:43,964
Old pumpkins feel familiar, right?

624
00:23:43,965 --> 00:23:46,264
It could remind you of old pumpkins...

625
00:23:46,265 --> 00:23:49,764
on top of thatched-roof houses.

626
00:23:49,765 --> 00:23:53,334
I thought it would be an item that suited this place well.

627
00:23:53,335 --> 00:23:54,975
(The familiar feeling was perfect for this space.)

628
00:23:56,405 --> 00:23:58,475
Pane pasta is popular, right?

629
00:23:58,575 --> 00:24:01,344
Pumpkin instead of pane. Ssanghwatang instead of pasta.

630
00:24:01,345 --> 00:24:02,614
That's what I used.

631
00:24:02,615 --> 00:24:06,655
(Lots of dates and chestnuts inside of the pumpkin)

632
00:24:06,955 --> 00:24:09,885
Compared to ssanghwatang made in other places,

633
00:24:09,985 --> 00:24:11,725
our ssanghwatang uses a lot more medicinal herbs.

634
00:24:12,155 --> 00:24:13,954
(They brew it for 2 to 3 hours to maximize benefits.)

635
00:24:13,955 --> 00:24:16,624
We make it with care...

636
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:18,295
to improve our customers' health.

637
00:24:18,835 --> 00:24:21,834
(A generous amount of ssanghwatang in a big pumpkin)

638
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:24,365
Next is our special recipe.

639
00:24:24,465 --> 00:24:26,804
We steam the pumpkin...

640
00:24:26,805 --> 00:24:28,344
with the ssanghwatang.

641
00:24:28,345 --> 00:24:29,345
(Steam the pumpkin and ssanghwatang together for one hour.)

642
00:24:30,045 --> 00:24:32,974
When we do that, the sweet aroma from the pumpkin...

643
00:24:32,975 --> 00:24:35,485
naturally gets infused into the ssanghwatang.

644
00:24:36,285 --> 00:24:38,245
People seem to like...

645
00:24:38,455 --> 00:24:41,885
our pumpkin ssanghwatang for its unique flavor.

646
00:24:43,055 --> 00:24:44,554
It's a unique item,

647
00:24:44,555 --> 00:24:47,295
so it's more popular than the other items on the menu.

648
00:24:48,765 --> 00:24:52,835
(And the dessert that goes perfectly with ssanghwatang)

649
00:24:52,895 --> 00:24:56,404
I wanted to invent a unique snack.

650
00:24:56,405 --> 00:24:59,174
That's why I invented this pumpkin rice cake skewer.

651
00:24:59,175 --> 00:25:00,904
(He uses icy water to accentuate the chewy texture...)

652
00:25:00,905 --> 00:25:02,605
(when making this unique dessert.)

653
00:25:02,775 --> 00:25:05,914
I use sunflower seeds to describe pumpkin stems...

654
00:25:05,915 --> 00:25:07,275
and to add another texture.

655
00:25:08,275 --> 00:25:10,984
Lastly, you can't eat rice cake without honey, right?

656
00:25:10,985 --> 00:25:12,884
I drizzle a handsome amount of grain syrup.

657
00:25:12,885 --> 00:25:14,185
And then I serve it to customers.

658
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:16,724
You can enjoy an unusual flavor...

659
00:25:16,725 --> 00:25:20,195
when eating it with ssanghwatang.

660
00:25:21,125 --> 00:25:23,864
It's an unusual, unique experience,

661
00:25:23,865 --> 00:25:25,365
which I think is why many people come to have these.

662
00:25:26,395 --> 00:25:28,864
The pair takes up about 30 to 40 percent...

663
00:25:28,865 --> 00:25:31,004
of the total sales of my cafe.

664
00:25:31,005 --> 00:25:33,934
That means they're the number one item of all on the menu.

665
00:25:33,935 --> 00:25:35,875
(100-Year-Old House's cash cow, pumpkin ssanghwatang set)

666
00:25:36,075 --> 00:25:39,015
(Could pumpkin ssanghwatang set be real?)

667
00:25:39,315 --> 00:25:43,015
(Or is it the fake thing hidden in the trendy place?)

668
00:25:43,115 --> 00:25:44,184
Oh, my. So this is how it's served.

669
00:25:44,185 --> 00:25:45,715
- I think it's fake.
- It looks like...

670
00:25:46,255 --> 00:25:47,814
How do customers react when they see this?

671
00:25:47,815 --> 00:25:49,985
They like it because it's unique and unusual.

672
00:25:50,325 --> 00:25:51,954
- We scoop out the tea?
- Correct.

673
00:25:51,955 --> 00:25:52,955
(It's been very popular thanks to its never-before-seen looks.)

674
00:25:53,255 --> 00:25:54,794
Can we eat the pumpkin as well?

675
00:25:54,795 --> 00:25:56,064
Of course, you can.

676
00:25:56,065 --> 00:25:58,864
- After finishing the ssanghwatang, - Yes.

677
00:25:58,865 --> 00:26:02,264
Scrape out the inside walls.

678
00:26:02,265 --> 00:26:03,304
(You can scrape out the inside walls of the pumpkin.)

679
00:26:03,305 --> 00:26:04,704
- Oh, like that?
- Yes.

680
00:26:04,705 --> 00:26:05,904
- REI, here's some pumpkin.
- Just as we eat...

681
00:26:05,905 --> 00:26:06,905
- Okay.
- bean sprout pot rice.

682
00:26:07,005 --> 00:26:08,304
Thank you.

683
00:26:08,305 --> 00:26:10,105
(A lot of pumpkin with ssanghwatang)

684
00:26:10,205 --> 00:26:12,274
This must be very pricey.

685
00:26:12,275 --> 00:26:13,845
- Pumpkin ssanghwatang is...
- Exactly.

686
00:26:15,785 --> 00:26:16,945
- This is the menu.
- I see.

687
00:26:17,315 --> 00:26:18,654
Oh, my. Look at the menu.

688
00:26:18,655 --> 00:26:19,915
- Here's the price.
- Okay.

689
00:26:20,355 --> 00:26:23,255
Guys, these are the drinks and food and their prices.

690
00:26:25,195 --> 00:26:26,294
It's for 10 people, and it's 50 dollars.

691
00:26:26,295 --> 00:26:27,955
- Is this for ten people, sir?
- Yes.

692
00:26:28,425 --> 00:26:29,464
So it's 50 dollars?

693
00:26:29,465 --> 00:26:32,265
(If you look at the size, 50 dollars sounds reasonable.)

694
00:26:32,335 --> 00:26:34,795
I feel like I'm at some kind of ceremony.

695
00:26:35,805 --> 00:26:38,234
Based on how it looks, it feels like...

696
00:26:38,235 --> 00:26:39,504
(It's like they're having a buffet as it's for 10 people.)

697
00:26:39,505 --> 00:26:42,704
(It's unbelievably huge. Could it be real?)

698
00:26:42,705 --> 00:26:44,344
- I'll put in a yolk.
- It looks like sukiyaki.

699
00:26:44,345 --> 00:26:45,415
(You can't miss it when you drink ssanghwatang.)

700
00:26:45,775 --> 00:26:47,344
I'll break it and then try it.

701
00:26:47,345 --> 00:26:48,515
(Adding a yolk to ssanghwatang)

702
00:26:48,715 --> 00:26:50,045
It's really dark.

703
00:26:50,315 --> 00:26:52,485
(How does pumpkin ssanghwatang taste?)

704
00:26:52,885 --> 00:26:53,955
(Amazed)

705
00:26:54,085 --> 00:26:55,655
It's good. This ssanghwatang is so tasty.

706
00:26:57,885 --> 00:26:59,794
- It's good to have hot tea.
- Right?

707
00:26:59,795 --> 00:27:01,695
(How about REI, who has never tried ssanghwatang before?)

708
00:27:01,895 --> 00:27:03,665
- It tastes healthy.
- It's not bad. I've only tried...

709
00:27:03,925 --> 00:27:05,934
- It tastes healthy?
- It tastes like herbal medicine.

710
00:27:05,935 --> 00:27:07,665
- Right, herbal medicine.
- Right?

711
00:27:07,795 --> 00:27:09,535
(Jae Seok tries a sip too.)

712
00:27:12,935 --> 00:27:14,574
- You should drink it just as it is.
- Is it bitter?

713
00:27:14,575 --> 00:27:17,275
It's so bitter. Sir, this is a bit bitter.

714
00:27:17,575 --> 00:27:18,944
There's no honey in it.

715
00:27:18,945 --> 00:27:20,075
(Jae Seok's close friends are laughing, excited.)

716
00:27:20,275 --> 00:27:21,775
- Coffee is bitter, right?
- Yes, it is.

717
00:27:22,115 --> 00:27:24,044
Ssanghwatang is supposed to be a bit bitter.

718
00:27:24,045 --> 00:27:25,584
I see. We've always had...

719
00:27:25,585 --> 00:27:27,314
- sweet ssanghwatang.
- It was sweet.

720
00:27:27,315 --> 00:27:29,554
They probably made it sweet to suit people's palate.

721
00:27:29,555 --> 00:27:30,625
This is the original ssanghwatang.

722
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:33,294
Just as coffee is supposed to have a bitter taste.

723
00:27:33,295 --> 00:27:36,195
(Rich ssanghwatang with a plenty of healthy oriental herbs)

724
00:27:36,325 --> 00:27:37,424
I'll try the rice cake.

725
00:27:37,425 --> 00:27:39,535
(That's why you need the sweet pumpkin rice cake skewer.)

726
00:27:41,265 --> 00:27:42,705
- Let's have one each.
- This is it.

727
00:27:43,005 --> 00:27:44,635
- Because it has cooled down.
- It's so good.

728
00:27:45,105 --> 00:27:47,004
- Kyoung Pyo, you need some sweets.
- Thank you.

729
00:27:47,005 --> 00:27:48,435
You haven't eaten anything since 4pm yesterday.

730
00:27:48,945 --> 00:27:50,175
My, it's really good.

731
00:27:52,475 --> 00:27:53,845
This is what I expected.

732
00:27:54,545 --> 00:27:55,645
It's so good.

733
00:27:56,285 --> 00:27:59,384
(The sweet taste of a pumpkin is absorbed in the rice cake.)

734
00:27:59,385 --> 00:28:00,815
- It's good.
- It's good, indeed.

735
00:28:01,015 --> 00:28:02,285
It's covered with a lot of grain syrup.

736
00:28:02,985 --> 00:28:05,695
(The sweet taste can get rid of the aftertaste of the tea.)

737
00:28:06,455 --> 00:28:08,454
- It must be delicious.
- Indeed.

738
00:28:08,455 --> 00:28:09,465
(Kyoung Pyo has become happy again.)

739
00:28:09,725 --> 00:28:14,165
Sir, did you get all these decorative items here?

740
00:28:14,365 --> 00:28:17,034
Yes. I received some of them...

741
00:28:17,035 --> 00:28:18,774
- and bought the others...
- Yes.

742
00:28:18,775 --> 00:28:20,474
- at antique auctions.
- I see.

743
00:28:20,475 --> 00:28:21,905
(He bought some of them at antique auctions.)

744
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24,744
Which of the items you have here...

745
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:26,214
- is worth the most?
- Which one is it?

746
00:28:26,215 --> 00:28:27,644
- It's that piano over there...
- Thank you, ma'am.

747
00:28:27,645 --> 00:28:29,114
That was brought to Korea...

748
00:28:29,115 --> 00:28:31,244
- Oh, that?
- in the late period of Joseon.

749
00:28:31,245 --> 00:28:32,984
It's a handmade piano.

750
00:28:32,985 --> 00:28:34,084
(The handmade piano turns out to be worth a lot.)

751
00:28:34,085 --> 00:28:36,824
The piano maker carved wood to make every piece of it.

752
00:28:36,825 --> 00:28:37,924
Really? It's handmade?

753
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:39,155
(Many years of history and memories remain in the piano.)

754
00:28:39,355 --> 00:28:42,025
- No wonder it seemed a bit crude.
- How much is it worth?

755
00:28:42,195 --> 00:28:43,595
How much is it worth?

756
00:28:44,095 --> 00:28:46,894
I think it's worth between 7,000 and 8,000 dollars.

757
00:28:46,895 --> 00:28:48,365
- Is it worth that much?
- Yes.

758
00:28:48,565 --> 00:28:51,335
(The piano's value increased as 100 years passed by.)

759
00:28:51,505 --> 00:28:54,774
Did you decorate the third floor with what you personally liked?

760
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:55,844
I saw that it had an X-rated vibe.

761
00:28:55,845 --> 00:28:57,474
Have you collected all those your entire life?

762
00:28:57,475 --> 00:28:58,475
Pardon me?

763
00:28:59,075 --> 00:29:01,944
- I asked if you had collected them.
- CEO Song, you're out of line.

764
00:29:01,945 --> 00:29:05,114
The third floor was decorated with that kind of theme.

765
00:29:05,115 --> 00:29:06,754
- Right.
- That's human instinct.

766
00:29:06,755 --> 00:29:08,254
Oh, my. That's a philosophical answer.

767
00:29:08,255 --> 00:29:10,224
No wonder I couldn't get myself to leave there.

768
00:29:10,225 --> 00:29:12,424
That's cool, sir. You're right.

769
00:29:12,425 --> 00:29:13,494
You mean, the instinct toward the opposite gender?

770
00:29:13,495 --> 00:29:14,495
Exactly. It's an instinct.

771
00:29:14,496 --> 00:29:15,865
- Right. No wonder...
- Impressive.

772
00:29:16,125 --> 00:29:17,595
I felt like I couldn't get out of there.

773
00:29:17,895 --> 00:29:19,294
- Exactly.
- The feeling lingers for long.

774
00:29:19,295 --> 00:29:20,665
Also, there's a photo spot...

775
00:29:20,995 --> 00:29:22,665
- on that floor.
- That's right.

776
00:29:22,835 --> 00:29:23,864
(Looking cautiously)

777
00:29:23,865 --> 00:29:24,935
I bet it's fake.

778
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:28,504
- It's fake.
- Why are you whispering?

779
00:29:28,505 --> 00:29:31,275
It's rude to say it loudly when the owner is right there.

780
00:29:31,675 --> 00:29:32,775
But I do think...

781
00:29:33,515 --> 00:29:35,784
that this is too large to sell.

782
00:29:35,785 --> 00:29:37,515
See? You're whispering too.

783
00:29:39,715 --> 00:29:41,385
It happens naturally.

784
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:45,325
(Is it fake because it's overly large to sell?)

785
00:29:45,425 --> 00:29:46,525
I think...

786
00:29:46,895 --> 00:29:49,224
that it's a little bit hard to serve to customers.

787
00:29:49,225 --> 00:29:50,225
What did you say?

788
00:29:50,895 --> 00:29:53,235
- It's hard to serve to customers?
- It's hard to serve?

789
00:29:53,835 --> 00:29:54,935
Come on.

790
00:29:56,035 --> 00:29:57,865
Sir, that's not what I meant.

791
00:29:58,335 --> 00:29:59,905
(Flustered)

792
00:30:00,135 --> 00:30:02,404
He worked so hard to invent this. How could you?

793
00:30:02,405 --> 00:30:04,344
- It takes an hour to make this.
- It's not like that.

794
00:30:04,345 --> 00:30:06,245
This is like a typical old comedy skit.

795
00:30:06,675 --> 00:30:08,444
- Gosh. Here he goes again.
- Even for the great Yu Jae Seok,

796
00:30:08,445 --> 00:30:10,714
- this is out of line.
- He's doing it again.

797
00:30:10,715 --> 00:30:12,954
The owner suddenly looks upset.

798
00:30:12,955 --> 00:30:14,354
Sir, it's just a joke.

799
00:30:14,355 --> 00:30:15,824
(He seems upset?)

800
00:30:15,825 --> 00:30:16,825
- Sir.
- Oh, poor him.

801
00:30:16,826 --> 00:30:18,184
It's a little hard to see his eyes.

802
00:30:18,185 --> 00:30:19,625
What do you mean by "Poor him?"

803
00:30:20,195 --> 00:30:21,794
- His feelings are hurt.
- Gosh, she is...

804
00:30:21,795 --> 00:30:22,824
Oh, no.

805
00:30:22,825 --> 00:30:24,594
- Gosh, seriously.
- Poor him.

806
00:30:24,595 --> 00:30:25,894
- I scooped out the tea for you.
- What will you do...

807
00:30:25,895 --> 00:30:27,365
if this turns out to be real?

808
00:30:27,765 --> 00:30:28,804
(This is the end of Jae Seok. REI does know how to annoy him.)

809
00:30:28,805 --> 00:30:30,364
What if it's real?

810
00:30:30,365 --> 00:30:32,304
- This is fake. I'm sure of it.
- I think so too.

811
00:30:32,305 --> 00:30:34,804
- Also, this is for ten people.
- Yes.

812
00:30:34,805 --> 00:30:36,544
How can ten people come here together?

813
00:30:36,545 --> 00:30:38,174
- Right. It doesn't make sense.
- At the same time?

814
00:30:38,175 --> 00:30:39,674
The table turnover rate would be low if the two of them do all the work.

815
00:30:39,675 --> 00:30:41,214
- That's right. It's a lot of work.
- Right.

816
00:30:41,215 --> 00:30:42,485
Based on the portion size and everything...

817
00:30:42,985 --> 00:30:44,444
And in the last episode,

818
00:30:44,445 --> 00:30:46,914
we saw something in the same size. It was a dumpling.

819
00:30:46,915 --> 00:30:49,224
- Right, the dumpling.
- Oh, I get it.

820
00:30:49,225 --> 00:30:51,154
- The staff want to get even?
- Yes.

821
00:30:51,155 --> 00:30:53,424
We've seen bread and dumplings in the same size as this.

822
00:30:53,425 --> 00:30:55,254
- Yes, you're right.
- The same as pumpkin ssanghwatang.

823
00:30:55,255 --> 00:30:57,065
(The fake huge dumpling soup from Episode 7)

824
00:30:57,425 --> 00:31:02,404
(Is this another huge dish created by the staff?)

825
00:31:02,405 --> 00:31:04,064
I think many people would come here to look around, though.

826
00:31:04,065 --> 00:31:05,204
It's really nice to look around.

827
00:31:05,205 --> 00:31:06,304
- I see a bus timetable there too.
- Right.

828
00:31:06,305 --> 00:31:07,305
From all the stuff I see here...

829
00:31:07,306 --> 00:31:08,674
And it has a really good vibe.

830
00:31:08,675 --> 00:31:10,144
Indeed. It has an interesting vibe.

831
00:31:10,145 --> 00:31:11,575
It feels warm and nice.

832
00:31:12,515 --> 00:31:14,714
- I'll take photos of you guys.
- That's a good idea.

833
00:31:14,715 --> 00:31:16,785
- Then let's take a photo...
- It looked so pretty up there.

834
00:31:16,985 --> 00:31:19,554
- Let's take a photo at the spot.
- Go upstairs. I'll take it.

835
00:31:19,555 --> 00:31:20,955
(Shouting)

836
00:31:21,985 --> 00:31:23,325
- What was the noise just now?
- Where is she?

837
00:31:23,755 --> 00:31:25,924
- Oh, it was Mimi's voice.
- It was Mimi's voice.

838
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:26,954
(Chuckling)

839
00:31:26,955 --> 00:31:28,525
Stick out your face.

840
00:31:29,065 --> 00:31:30,424
I asked if you could see us.

841
00:31:30,425 --> 00:31:31,665
I can see you very clearly.

842
00:31:32,535 --> 00:31:35,065
That's nice. Oh, it's so pretty.

843
00:31:36,265 --> 00:31:37,905
Are we all in the frame?

844
00:31:38,165 --> 00:31:39,275
Yes, of course.

845
00:31:40,675 --> 00:31:42,344
- That's nice.
- Okay.

846
00:31:42,345 --> 00:31:43,504
- That was nice.
- Please come down.

847
00:31:43,505 --> 00:31:44,905
- Okay.
- Oh, yes.

848
00:31:45,645 --> 00:31:47,814
- We can see the photos right away.
- Yes.

849
00:31:47,815 --> 00:31:49,645
- What? That quickly?
- Here it is.

850
00:31:50,345 --> 00:31:51,445
It's connected to the computer.

851
00:31:51,615 --> 00:31:53,484
- It's a touch screen, even.
- Oh, it's connected.

852
00:31:53,485 --> 00:31:54,485
This is awesome.

853
00:31:54,486 --> 00:31:55,954
- It's amazing.
- We can upload photos right away.

854
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:57,285
(Amazed)

855
00:31:57,725 --> 00:31:59,354
This is really amazing.

856
00:31:59,355 --> 00:32:01,595
- I know, right?
- This is really awesome.

857
00:32:04,995 --> 00:32:06,635
- That's Mimi.
- I tried to stand out.

858
00:32:06,965 --> 00:32:09,504
I just found something suspicious.

859
00:32:09,505 --> 00:32:11,034
Didn't it say "exhibition area?"

860
00:32:11,035 --> 00:32:12,035
- Yes.
- Yes.

861
00:32:12,036 --> 00:32:13,705
(They'll check the footage again.)

862
00:32:14,905 --> 00:32:17,274
- Right here.
- Oh, you can zoom in... What?

863
00:32:17,275 --> 00:32:18,474
My gosh. It's written right there.

864
00:32:18,475 --> 00:32:20,014
- It's written so clearly.
- Goodness.

865
00:32:20,015 --> 00:32:21,015
(It says the place is an exhibition area.)

866
00:32:21,115 --> 00:32:22,284
It says it's an exhibition area.

867
00:32:22,285 --> 00:32:23,685
I guess people come here just to look around.

868
00:32:24,415 --> 00:32:26,154
Perhaps, this is not a cafe...

869
00:32:26,155 --> 00:32:27,785
but an exhibition area.

870
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:30,124
Exactly. It's a lie that it's a cafe.

871
00:32:30,125 --> 00:32:31,125
We would've missed...

872
00:32:31,485 --> 00:32:32,894
what Kyoung Pyo pointed out...

873
00:32:32,895 --> 00:32:35,454
- if we had looked on a phone.
- Right.

874
00:32:35,455 --> 00:32:38,164
We can see the clue clearly since we're looking at a big screen.

875
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:39,935
- You're right.
- Yes.

876
00:32:40,395 --> 00:32:41,594
Today, we have to find the real one.

877
00:32:41,595 --> 00:32:43,135
- It's confusing.
- There's one place that's real.

878
00:32:43,505 --> 00:32:45,934
Does that mean they've been running this fake cafe...

879
00:32:45,935 --> 00:32:47,634
- for the past two months?
- That's right.

880
00:32:47,635 --> 00:32:48,774
(It's not going to be easy today, as always.)

881
00:32:48,775 --> 00:32:50,104
- This is not easy.
- It's possible.

882
00:32:50,105 --> 00:32:51,475
- It's possible.
- Yes, it's possible.

883
00:32:51,775 --> 00:32:53,514
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

884
00:32:53,515 --> 00:32:55,114
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

885
00:32:55,115 --> 00:32:56,815
(It looks 100 years old. It's a fake cafe? The serving size is too big?)

886
00:32:57,485 --> 00:32:58,954
(1.100-Year-Old House, 2.100 Minutes of Waiting, )

887
00:32:58,955 --> 00:33:00,014
(3.30 Million Bowls, 4.5-Million-Dollar Feast)

888
00:33:00,015 --> 00:33:02,225
(They're moving to the 2nd place, 100 Minutes of Waiting!)

889
00:33:02,549 --> 00:33:03,878
Hold on. "Bibimbap waffle?"

890
00:33:03,879 --> 00:33:05,249
Bibimbap in waffles?

891
00:33:05,449 --> 00:33:07,018
- This is...
- There's a large sign over there.

892
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:08,149
- Exactly. It's over there.
- Oh, right.

893
00:33:09,049 --> 00:33:11,118
(It's written on the exterior wall of a 2-story building.)

894
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:12,218
- But...
- That can't be...

895
00:33:12,219 --> 00:33:13,658
- faked.
- That can't be faked.

896
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:14,659
- Right.
- My point, exactly.

897
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,128
- It's written on the outside too.
- It's written over there. Then...

898
00:33:16,129 --> 00:33:17,828
- "Bibimbap waffle and drinks." - Exactly.

899
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,899
Unless the local government helped.

900
00:33:20,229 --> 00:33:23,498
Jae Seok hosted all three seasons of this show.

901
00:33:23,499 --> 00:33:26,139
Why would he think it's impossible?

902
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:29,069
- Gosh, seriously.
- I mean, think about it.

903
00:33:29,209 --> 00:33:31,639
- They even changed a whole place.
- Come over here.

904
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,978
This is why you never guessed the right answer at home.

905
00:33:33,979 --> 00:33:37,048
The staff even built a building like that before.

906
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:39,519
- The two of them don't hit it off.
- You're right.

907
00:33:39,719 --> 00:33:41,078
Jong Kook, who gets along with everyone,

908
00:33:41,079 --> 00:33:42,218
struggles to handle him the most.

909
00:33:42,219 --> 00:33:43,519
(The one that's hard to handle?)

910
00:33:43,619 --> 00:33:46,159
It's because Tae Hyun wouldn't stop chattering.

911
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:49,188
He just talks nonstop.

912
00:33:49,189 --> 00:33:51,499
I'm telling you, they're capable of doing unimaginable things.

913
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:53,799
- I wonder what bibimbap waffle is.
- I have no idea.

914
00:33:54,129 --> 00:33:56,969
- Bibimbap waffle sounds plausible.
- Right.

915
00:33:57,969 --> 00:33:59,099
Shall we go in for now?

916
00:33:59,299 --> 00:34:00,938
Oh, my. Hello.

917
00:34:00,939 --> 00:34:02,138
- Welcome.
- Hello.

918
00:34:02,139 --> 00:34:03,539
- Hello.
- If you eat it while it's hot...

919
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:04,839
Hello.

920
00:34:05,939 --> 00:34:09,879
(It's clean and tidy inside.)

921
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:15,189
(It looks like a cafe with pretty pictures and decorative items.)

922
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:17,888
Is this place famous for bibimbap waffles?

923
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,359
Yes, this is the very place.

924
00:34:19,819 --> 00:34:21,329
- This is the very place?
- The bibimbap waffle place. Yes.

925
00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:23,628
You two are mother and daughter, aren't you?

926
00:34:23,629 --> 00:34:24,858
- Do we look alike?
- Yes, a little.

927
00:34:24,859 --> 00:34:26,258
You could just know when we didn't tell you that.

928
00:34:26,259 --> 00:34:28,498
Yes, it's easy to tell. You're obviously her daughter.

929
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:29,569
(The mother and her daughter run the place together.)

930
00:34:29,629 --> 00:34:32,669
What does "100 Minutes of Waiting" mean?

931
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:35,738
The waffles we serve here are so famous...

932
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:37,368
that people usually wait...

933
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:39,908
for about 100 minutes before ordering.

934
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:41,138
(People wait for 100 minutes for a waffle?)

935
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:42,878
- Oh, that's what it means.
- It's the wait time for food.

936
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:44,249
- The wait time for food?
- Yes.

937
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:46,318
(The paradise of street food)

938
00:34:46,319 --> 00:34:48,149
(Jeonju)

939
00:34:48,349 --> 00:34:51,119
(People wait for 100 minutes just to have a waffle?)

940
00:34:51,259 --> 00:34:53,558
You can eat this only in Jeonju.

941
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:55,188
Since it's served only at our place,

942
00:34:55,189 --> 00:34:57,029
many people come to Jeonju just to try this.

943
00:34:57,759 --> 00:35:00,199
Jeonju is famous for bibimbap, right?

944
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,298
We wanted to make something...

945
00:35:02,299 --> 00:35:05,298
that makes it easier for people to enjoy bibimbap.

946
00:35:05,299 --> 00:35:06,399
(They make a waffle with bibimbap that's easy to eat!)

947
00:35:07,899 --> 00:35:09,909
Our signature dish, bibimbap waffle...

948
00:35:10,509 --> 00:35:13,408
has remained as the dish that you must try...

949
00:35:13,409 --> 00:35:14,709
when you visit Jeonju.

950
00:35:16,149 --> 00:35:19,279
(It's a trendy place that's already famous on social media.)

951
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:24,319
(Bibimbap waffle was featured in many TV shows.)

952
00:35:24,449 --> 00:35:26,888
When we tell our customers that we're out of ingredients...

953
00:35:26,889 --> 00:35:29,389
I think we sold about 400 waffles a day.

954
00:35:30,489 --> 00:35:34,199
Sometimes, I see too many people in the waiting line.

955
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:36,768
Some people waited 2 to 3 hours...

956
00:35:36,769 --> 00:35:38,099
to eat our food.

957
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:39,868
(- After multiple failures... - The wait time was so long, but...)

958
00:35:39,869 --> 00:35:42,769
(It's remained as a trendy place with 1 dish for 10 years.)

959
00:35:43,369 --> 00:35:45,939
(Bibimbap waffle alone has kept it as a trendy place for 10 years.)

960
00:35:46,539 --> 00:35:50,609
(Then could something fake be hidden in this trendy place?)

961
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:52,249
How long have you been running the business?

962
00:35:52,419 --> 00:35:55,088
It's been a little over ten years...

963
00:35:55,089 --> 00:35:56,988
since we started the business.

964
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:59,219
But it hasn't been long since we moved to this area.

965
00:35:59,459 --> 00:36:01,219
Oh, you moved from another area.

966
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:04,759
(They started the business in a small store in an alley.)

967
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:08,629
(Thanks to bibimbap waffle alone, they moved to a large building.)

968
00:36:08,869 --> 00:36:10,368
- Then we...
- Shall we order some food?

969
00:36:10,369 --> 00:36:11,968
- We'll order some food.
- Okay.

970
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:13,199
How should we order food here?

971
00:36:13,539 --> 00:36:15,608
If you look at the menu here,

972
00:36:15,609 --> 00:36:17,368
bibimbap waffle and chive jeon waffle...

973
00:36:17,369 --> 00:36:18,679
- are famous.
- I see.

974
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:20,209
Chive jeon waffle?

975
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:22,508
Is it real waffle...

976
00:36:22,509 --> 00:36:24,919
Chive jeon waffle is more popular than bibimbap waffle these days.

977
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:27,449
We invented a chive jeon waffle...

978
00:36:27,949 --> 00:36:31,219
when we moved to the new building.

979
00:36:32,059 --> 00:36:35,859
(People of all genders and ages enjoy chive jeon.)

980
00:36:36,859 --> 00:36:40,328
(Chive jeon must be crispy.)

981
00:36:40,329 --> 00:36:43,499
(They made a waffle with chive jeon?)

982
00:36:43,929 --> 00:36:46,568
The word started spreading.

983
00:36:46,569 --> 00:36:49,208
The number of people who come here...

984
00:36:49,209 --> 00:36:52,339
to try chive jeon waffle is increasing.

985
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:56,079
(The new type of waffle that's popular on YouTube as well)

986
00:36:56,149 --> 00:36:59,649
We sell between about 200 and 250 chive jeon waffles a day.

987
00:37:00,579 --> 00:37:03,148
We're cautiously expecting...

988
00:37:03,149 --> 00:37:05,588
that it will become another dessert...

989
00:37:05,589 --> 00:37:07,459
that outdoes bibimbap waffle.

990
00:37:07,589 --> 00:37:10,359
(Forget regular chive jeon.)

991
00:37:10,889 --> 00:37:13,959
(Chive jeon waffle is coming soon.)

992
00:37:14,229 --> 00:37:16,129
By the way, the place is very clean.

993
00:37:16,299 --> 00:37:18,268
- She said earlier...
- Yes.

994
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:20,568
That they had started the business in another area ten years ago,

995
00:37:20,569 --> 00:37:21,708
and that they had moved here not long ago...

996
00:37:21,709 --> 00:37:22,839
- as the business became successful.
- Exactly.

997
00:37:23,109 --> 00:37:25,338
Did they purchase the lot and have this building built?

998
00:37:25,339 --> 00:37:26,908
- I think that's the case.
- Right.

999
00:37:26,909 --> 00:37:28,948
- It's possible as people wait long.
- That's right.

1000
00:37:28,949 --> 00:37:30,578
It's possible that people waited for 100 minutes...

1001
00:37:30,579 --> 00:37:32,579
- before they moved here.
- That can be the case.

1002
00:37:32,779 --> 00:37:34,449
- But if you think about it...
- Yes?

1003
00:37:34,849 --> 00:37:38,819
Waiting for 100 minutes for a waffle doesn't sound...

1004
00:37:39,289 --> 00:37:41,158
I mean, bibimbap waffle wouldn't be so...

1005
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:42,488
(Chattering)

1006
00:37:42,489 --> 00:37:44,759
- popular...
- What is bothering you?

1007
00:37:45,059 --> 00:37:46,059
(What on earth is it?)

1008
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:48,399
- I mean, since you came here...
- First off...

1009
00:37:48,929 --> 00:37:51,199
That coffee truck... I mean, my show is on tvN as well.

1010
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:53,039
(The coffee caught Tae Hyun's eye.)

1011
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,168
All of you are holding coffee.

1012
00:37:55,169 --> 00:37:57,139
Since we're the children of tvN,

1013
00:37:58,069 --> 00:37:59,539
we received a gift.

1014
00:37:59,709 --> 00:38:00,779
That's nice.

1015
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:03,548
(Childish Cha, age 49, "Unexpected Business 2," "Handsome Guys")

1016
00:38:03,549 --> 00:38:06,178
- Only we got a coffee truck.
- He didn't get it.

1017
00:38:06,179 --> 00:38:08,649
- That's him. It's what he's like.
- He was upset from the beginning.

1018
00:38:08,749 --> 00:38:11,618
- He's here to ruin our show.
- I feel...

1019
00:38:11,619 --> 00:38:13,719
I just want to mess it all up.

1020
00:38:13,989 --> 00:38:16,858
(Childish Cha explodes with anger.)

1021
00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:18,628
- I knew you'd be like this.
- But...

1022
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,398
- You punk.
- REI, I'm sorry.

1023
00:38:20,399 --> 00:38:21,798
I'll clean up your mess.

1024
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:25,539
(I'll even clean up your mess, Dad.)

1025
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:27,569
- She's so mature.
- Indeed.

1026
00:38:27,869 --> 00:38:29,969
(I protect my dad.)

1027
00:38:30,369 --> 00:38:31,939
You know, bibimbap waffle...

1028
00:38:32,479 --> 00:38:34,948
I think I've seen it before. I shouldn't talk about it.

1029
00:38:34,949 --> 00:38:36,448
I can't believe anything you say.

1030
00:38:36,449 --> 00:38:39,378
I didn't say this because I knew you wouldn't believe me.

1031
00:38:39,379 --> 00:38:40,548
- They Mimi...
- Mimi...

1032
00:38:40,549 --> 00:38:41,748
- We talked about it on our way.
- It's contaminated.

1033
00:38:41,749 --> 00:38:43,248
- Her social media is...
- Her social media is contaminated.

1034
00:38:43,249 --> 00:38:44,689
Contaminated with Sixth Sense: City Tour.

1035
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:47,559
- So what did you see?
- Food wrapped with bibimbap.

1036
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:51,088
Just as you said, bibimbap was pressed in a waffle maker.

1037
00:38:51,089 --> 00:38:52,798
And some food was wrapped with it.

1038
00:38:52,799 --> 00:38:55,198
But it's possible that only chive jeon waffle is fake.

1039
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:56,768
- That's possible.
- Because bibimbap waffle...

1040
00:38:56,769 --> 00:38:58,398
is written on the sign.

1041
00:38:58,399 --> 00:38:59,539
- That's possible.
- Right.

1042
00:39:01,299 --> 00:39:02,908
I want to share my thoughts as a film major.

1043
00:39:02,909 --> 00:39:04,008
Jeonju International Film Festival...

1044
00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:05,438
- is held in Jeonju.
- That's right.

1045
00:39:05,439 --> 00:39:06,638
So I come to Jeonju every year.

1046
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:10,579
This is the 14th year I've been to Jeonju.

1047
00:39:10,709 --> 00:39:12,548
But I've never heard of chive jeon waffles.

1048
00:39:12,549 --> 00:39:14,678
That can be a hint.

1049
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:16,048
Right. I've never heard of it.

1050
00:39:16,049 --> 00:39:18,288
Kyoung Pyo travels a lot.

1051
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:20,458
- Yes.
- Mimi travels a lot too.

1052
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:22,488
She travels overseas even if she can spend only two days there.

1053
00:39:22,489 --> 00:39:23,629
- She mostly goes to a hot country.
- Yes.

1054
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:25,298
What about you, REI? Do you go home often?

1055
00:39:25,299 --> 00:39:27,759
I'm a homebody.

1056
00:39:27,859 --> 00:39:29,099
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

1057
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,198
- Which home?
- I...

1058
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:32,639
- Your home in Nagoya?
- Nagoya?

1059
00:39:32,799 --> 00:39:34,268
- Oh, I went to Nagoya recently.
- Your hometown.

1060
00:39:34,269 --> 00:39:35,469
For how many days did you stay there?

1061
00:39:35,869 --> 00:39:36,939
I beg your pardon?

1062
00:39:38,479 --> 00:39:39,479
For how many days?

1063
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,508
- For how many days?
- Oh, I see.

1064
00:39:40,509 --> 00:39:42,649
She said it like this. "I beg your pardon?"

1065
00:39:43,349 --> 00:39:44,548
It sounded as if she were saying,

1066
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:46,348
- Whenever she talks to you...
- "That's none of your business."

1067
00:39:46,349 --> 00:39:47,349
That's right.

1068
00:39:47,449 --> 00:39:49,449
- She's on edge when talking to you.
- That's right.

1069
00:39:50,019 --> 00:39:51,689
- "Why would you ask that?" - Exactly.

1070
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,388
- "I beg your pardon?" - Right.

1071
00:39:53,389 --> 00:39:54,988
- You admit it?
- She admitted it.

1072
00:39:54,989 --> 00:39:56,588
- She admitted it.
- She admitted it.

1073
00:39:56,589 --> 00:39:57,628
This is hilarious.

1074
00:39:57,629 --> 00:39:59,498
By the way, REI, your hairstyle is scary.

1075
00:39:59,499 --> 00:40:00,499
Why?

1076
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,928
This part is supposed to be the back of your head,

1077
00:40:02,929 --> 00:40:04,169
but your face is right here.

1078
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,669
- Because of her side ponytail?
- That's right.

1079
00:40:08,269 --> 00:40:09,468
She looks like a ghost.

1080
00:40:09,469 --> 00:40:10,539
(Her face is next to the back of her head?)

1081
00:40:10,709 --> 00:40:12,838
- REI...
- Jae Seok is scared.

1082
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:13,839
(Frightened)

1083
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,249
- Are you acting like a ghost?
- A female ghost.

1084
00:40:15,409 --> 00:40:17,308
It looks like the back of her head is right here.

1085
00:40:17,309 --> 00:40:20,118
- The back of her head... Okay.
- I'll keep my eye on you.

1086
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:21,278
She said she'd keep her eye on you.

1087
00:40:21,279 --> 00:40:22,619
(Laughing)

1088
00:40:22,919 --> 00:40:24,418
- Gosh, I'm going insane.
- I see what you did there.

1089
00:40:24,419 --> 00:40:25,919
Two people who drive me nuts are sitting right next to me.

1090
00:40:26,659 --> 00:40:29,188
On either side of me. They have me surrounded.

1091
00:40:29,189 --> 00:40:31,258
- That's great.
- I can't even take a breather...

1092
00:40:31,259 --> 00:40:32,458
because of Cha Tae Hyun and REI.

1093
00:40:32,459 --> 00:40:33,658
This seating arrangement is the best.

1094
00:40:33,659 --> 00:40:35,369
- Gosh.
- It's here.

1095
00:40:35,469 --> 00:40:36,599
- Gosh.
- What?

1096
00:40:37,266 --> 00:40:38,976
- Gosh.
- It's here.

1097
00:40:39,076 --> 00:40:40,276
- Gosh.
- What?

1098
00:40:40,376 --> 00:40:43,305
- Here's your order.
- Are these the same ones I saw?

1099
00:40:43,306 --> 00:40:45,346
- The waffles are...
- These look like kebabs.

1100
00:40:46,276 --> 00:40:48,315
- The waffles are thin.
- This is what I saw.

1101
00:40:48,316 --> 00:40:49,345
This is what I saw.

1102
00:40:49,346 --> 00:40:51,985
The waffles were made with bibimbap.

1103
00:40:51,986 --> 00:40:54,925
- This is a perfect bite-sized food.
- It is.

1104
00:40:54,926 --> 00:40:56,185
This looks really good.

1105
00:40:56,186 --> 00:40:58,096
(The secret to their signature dish, the bibimbap waffle)

1106
00:40:58,826 --> 00:41:01,826
I didn't stray away from the ingredients of bibimbap.

1107
00:41:02,866 --> 00:41:04,796
I wanted to try and use this sauce...

1108
00:41:05,266 --> 00:41:06,866
that is unique to Korean cuisine.

1109
00:41:11,706 --> 00:41:15,106
I wanted the crispy texture of stone pot bibimbap.

1110
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:17,105
(The bibimbap is pressed down and cooked in the waffle machine.)

1111
00:41:17,106 --> 00:41:19,876
And when the rice becomes crispy and burnt,

1112
00:41:20,076 --> 00:41:22,585
it enhances the nutty flavor of the bibimbap.

1113
00:41:22,586 --> 00:41:23,586
(Crispy and burnt bibimbap tastes much nuttier.)

1114
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:27,385
I also make amazing stir-fried pork.

1115
00:41:27,386 --> 00:41:29,026
(The 1st-generation owner's handmade stir-fried pork)

1116
00:41:29,556 --> 00:41:32,726
So I added stir-fried pork to our bibimbap waffle.

1117
00:41:33,856 --> 00:41:36,195
I incorporated the five traditional colors of Korea...

1118
00:41:36,196 --> 00:41:38,866
in the types of vegetables we use.

1119
00:41:39,036 --> 00:41:41,605
That's how I created our waffle.

1120
00:41:41,606 --> 00:41:42,666
(Stir-fried pork, carrots, cabbage, lettuce, and cheese are used.)

1121
00:41:42,936 --> 00:41:46,005
I patented our bibimbap waffle.

1122
00:41:46,006 --> 00:41:47,676
Since we're the only ones who sell them,

1123
00:41:47,976 --> 00:41:49,846
people come all the way to Jeonju to try the waffles.

1124
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:54,945
(Their waffle went viral on YouTube, )

1125
00:41:54,946 --> 00:41:57,685
(and there are countless online reviews.)

1126
00:41:57,686 --> 00:42:00,016
Our monthly sales is about 25,000 dollars,

1127
00:42:00,356 --> 00:42:02,026
and this is our unique signature dish.

1128
00:42:02,886 --> 00:42:05,395
(People wait in line for 100 minutes to try it. What does it taste like?)

1129
00:42:05,396 --> 00:42:06,526
I'll try the bibimbap part.

1130
00:42:07,326 --> 00:42:09,395
I just want a bite of the original.

1131
00:42:09,396 --> 00:42:12,766
(Taking a huge bite)

1132
00:42:14,636 --> 00:42:16,766
Gosh, it's good.

1133
00:42:17,466 --> 00:42:20,276
(Eun I takes a huge bite.)

1134
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:23,406
(She has to slurp up the ingredients.)

1135
00:42:23,776 --> 00:42:25,245
- It's good.
- Yes, it's good.

1136
00:42:25,246 --> 00:42:26,445
- This is so good.
- It's good.

1137
00:42:26,446 --> 00:42:27,446
The bibimbap waffle.

1138
00:42:27,646 --> 00:42:28,715
(Tosses the rest into her mouth)

1139
00:42:28,716 --> 00:42:29,786
It's good.

1140
00:42:33,016 --> 00:42:35,186
(The bibimbap waffle even sounds tasty.)

1141
00:42:36,286 --> 00:42:37,586
- It's good.
- The flavor is incredible.

1142
00:42:37,986 --> 00:42:39,896
I have a waffle machine at home.

1143
00:42:40,326 --> 00:42:42,695
Making something like this is a lot of hassle.

1144
00:42:42,696 --> 00:42:45,996
Making crispy burnt rice this thin is...

1145
00:42:46,636 --> 00:42:47,766
Gosh, the process is not easy.

1146
00:42:47,866 --> 00:42:49,866
That's why I think the owner is amazing.

1147
00:42:50,106 --> 00:42:51,235
I feel like the bibimbap waffle...

1148
00:42:51,236 --> 00:42:52,575
- makes sense.
- Right.

1149
00:42:52,576 --> 00:42:53,576
(The bibimbap waffle is clearly real.)

1150
00:42:54,306 --> 00:42:56,906
(The next waffle they'll be trying is their new dish.)

1151
00:42:58,546 --> 00:43:01,276
- Kyoung Pyo, this will be good.
- It looks good.

1152
00:43:02,086 --> 00:43:04,215
What led you to make this dish?

1153
00:43:04,216 --> 00:43:07,586
I took over the business as the second-generation owner,

1154
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:10,325
so I wanted to come up with my own dish.

1155
00:43:10,326 --> 00:43:11,326
(The 2nd-generation owner created her own unique dish.)

1156
00:43:12,326 --> 00:43:14,865
(The chive jeon waffle)

1157
00:43:14,866 --> 00:43:18,065
The dish had to have a part of Jeonju in it.

1158
00:43:18,066 --> 00:43:20,895
Jeonju is famous for its meal of full set of dishes with makgeolli.

1159
00:43:20,896 --> 00:43:25,476
(When you order makgeolli, it's served with dozens of dishes.)

1160
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:29,105
And jeon is one of the things that's always served with makgeolli.

1161
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,346
(Makgeolli is always paired with jeon.)

1162
00:43:31,546 --> 00:43:33,476
Chive jeon waffle is crispy,

1163
00:43:33,846 --> 00:43:35,515
and I thought it would be fun...

1164
00:43:35,516 --> 00:43:38,416
to make into a waffle, so that's how I created this.

1165
00:43:39,316 --> 00:43:41,256
To make the jeon crispy,

1166
00:43:41,526 --> 00:43:43,086
I use frying mix...

1167
00:43:44,026 --> 00:43:46,355
and pour a thin layer of batter.

1168
00:43:46,356 --> 00:43:47,356
(The batter has to be as thin as possible.)

1169
00:43:48,466 --> 00:43:50,626
(Frying)

1170
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:55,606
(In 4 minutes, the crispy jeon waffle is done.)

1171
00:43:55,836 --> 00:43:59,135
If you eat too many jeon for too long, you can get tired of it.

1172
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:01,746
So to prevent that, I wanted to put something inside.

1173
00:44:01,946 --> 00:44:03,545
That's how I ended up...

1174
00:44:03,546 --> 00:44:06,076
wrapping the waffle around spicy squid salad.

1175
00:44:07,846 --> 00:44:09,286
For the spicy squid salad,

1176
00:44:09,516 --> 00:44:13,016
I used fresh squid and minari, Jeonju's local delicacy

1177
00:44:14,056 --> 00:44:17,456
I added radish for extra texture.

1178
00:44:17,856 --> 00:44:19,926
(Spicy chili powder)

1179
00:44:20,356 --> 00:44:22,396
(A pinch of sugar)

1180
00:44:22,666 --> 00:44:24,196
(A lot of gochujang)

1181
00:44:25,366 --> 00:44:27,996
My mom's spicy squid salad is really good.

1182
00:44:28,206 --> 00:44:30,635
So I got her recipe...

1183
00:44:30,636 --> 00:44:32,136
and put it in the chive jeon waffle.

1184
00:44:32,936 --> 00:44:35,546
To make it stay in place and for a chewy texture,

1185
00:44:35,646 --> 00:44:37,806
the spicy squid salad is rolled in rice paper.

1186
00:44:38,816 --> 00:44:41,885
Then, it is wrapped in spicy chive jeon waffle.

1187
00:44:41,886 --> 00:44:42,946
(The freshly made chive jeon waffle gives makes the dish crispy!)

1188
00:44:43,816 --> 00:44:46,186
(The chive jeon waffle)

1189
00:44:46,986 --> 00:44:49,326
These days, this new dish is popular on social media...

1190
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:51,856
and is raising our sales.

1191
00:44:52,556 --> 00:44:53,996
The chive jeon waffle is the first dish...

1192
00:44:54,226 --> 00:44:57,266
that was created in ten years since the bibimbap waffle.

1193
00:44:58,126 --> 00:45:00,235
(Is this dish real?)

1194
00:45:00,236 --> 00:45:02,106
(Or fake?)

1195
00:45:03,006 --> 00:45:05,775
- Gosh, it smells like chive jeon.
- It totally smells like chive jeon.

1196
00:45:05,776 --> 00:45:07,336
- It's chive jeon.
- I smell chive jeon.

1197
00:45:08,036 --> 00:45:10,206
(Mimi takes a huge bite...)

1198
00:45:12,516 --> 00:45:14,415
(and another bite right after.)

1199
00:45:14,416 --> 00:45:15,446
It's good.

1200
00:45:16,016 --> 00:45:17,846
- Gosh, it's good.
- It's good.

1201
00:45:18,516 --> 00:45:19,986
Anyway, it's really good.

1202
00:45:20,556 --> 00:45:21,856
- It's so good.
- It's so good.

1203
00:45:22,426 --> 00:45:23,956
It's amazing.

1204
00:45:24,086 --> 00:45:25,125
(Staring)

1205
00:45:25,126 --> 00:45:26,126
Squeeze it?

1206
00:45:26,896 --> 00:45:27,896
You want us to squeeze this?

1207
00:45:28,466 --> 00:45:31,796
We have to squeeze this? They keep giving us instructions.

1208
00:45:32,136 --> 00:45:34,936
- Like this.
- With your hands.

1209
00:45:36,206 --> 00:45:39,106
(If you squeeze it, you get to taste all the ingredients at once.)

1210
00:45:39,576 --> 00:45:43,476
(Small Mouth Eun I squeezes it and takes a big bite.)

1211
00:45:44,046 --> 00:45:46,616
- There's squid inside.
- It's so good.

1212
00:45:46,916 --> 00:45:50,045
The rice paper holds the squid, kimchi, and perilla leaves together.

1213
00:45:50,046 --> 00:45:51,755
And then the chive jeon is wrapped around that.

1214
00:45:51,756 --> 00:45:52,885
(The firework of sweet, sour, and nutty flavors in their mouths...)

1215
00:45:52,886 --> 00:45:54,056
(goes perfectly with the crispy and chewy texture.)

1216
00:45:55,026 --> 00:45:57,426
(Jae Seok is in love with the texture too.)

1217
00:45:58,026 --> 00:45:59,026
Gosh.

1218
00:45:59,156 --> 00:46:00,226
It's good.

1219
00:46:00,996 --> 00:46:02,895
I don't like the perilla leaves with this.

1220
00:46:02,896 --> 00:46:04,026
Come on.

1221
00:46:04,796 --> 00:46:05,895
(Childish Yu is a picky eater.)

1222
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:07,095
- Jae Seok.
- Yes?

1223
00:46:07,096 --> 00:46:08,336
What do you do when Ji Ho is picky with his food?

1224
00:46:09,006 --> 00:46:10,836
- You tell him to eat it, right?
- No, I look the other way.

1225
00:46:10,936 --> 00:46:11,976
No, I look the other way.

1226
00:46:14,076 --> 00:46:15,145
That's so wise of you.

1227
00:46:15,146 --> 00:46:16,205
(Jae Seok, the wise father)

1228
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:19,916
(Fine, I give up.)

1229
00:46:20,176 --> 00:46:22,986
I feel like there's something wrong with this.

1230
00:46:23,446 --> 00:46:26,056
The chives don't stand out.

1231
00:46:26,486 --> 00:46:27,586
The perilla leaves do.

1232
00:46:27,786 --> 00:46:29,325
You have a point. Chive jeon means "chive pancake."

1233
00:46:29,326 --> 00:46:30,885
It should be called "perilla leaf pancake" instead.

1234
00:46:30,886 --> 00:46:32,056
(It should be perilla leaf pancake since its flavor is stronger.)

1235
00:46:32,296 --> 00:46:34,256
I feel like the flavor could be a bit confusing.

1236
00:46:34,896 --> 00:46:35,966
What do you think, REI?

1237
00:46:36,496 --> 00:46:39,396
As a dish, I think it's...

1238
00:46:39,796 --> 00:46:42,405
- Weak?
- But if I say this,

1239
00:46:42,406 --> 00:46:44,566
I'll just be like the others.

1240
00:46:44,666 --> 00:46:45,736
Like the others, how?

1241
00:46:46,906 --> 00:46:48,776
Who are you talking about? Ko Kyoung Pyo?

1242
00:46:49,246 --> 00:46:50,805
(The blunt one?)

1243
00:46:50,806 --> 00:46:53,276
I feel like the flavor of the perilla leaves is a bit strong,

1244
00:46:53,716 --> 00:46:56,115
but it could be personal preference.

1245
00:46:56,116 --> 00:46:57,985
By "the others," did you mean Jae Seok?

1246
00:46:57,986 --> 00:46:59,055
Did you mean Jae Seok?

1247
00:46:59,056 --> 00:47:01,216
(REI didn't want to be like Jae Seok.)

1248
00:47:01,416 --> 00:47:02,455
It wasn't me.

1249
00:47:02,456 --> 00:47:03,586
(She meant me?)

1250
00:47:03,786 --> 00:47:05,196
- The flavor is strong.
- This is really hard.

1251
00:47:05,526 --> 00:47:08,055
I think whether or not the chive jeon waffle is real...

1252
00:47:08,056 --> 00:47:10,866
- depends on this fact.
- Right.

1253
00:47:11,166 --> 00:47:13,466
- I recognize this jacket.
- What do you mean?

1254
00:47:13,566 --> 00:47:16,336
It's the one you wore to the wedding of Lee Hwi Jae's older sister.

1255
00:47:17,666 --> 00:47:19,335
No, it's not.

1256
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,605
- It looks similar, though.
- I just happen to...

1257
00:47:21,606 --> 00:47:24,406
- The kids don't know. The alien.
- Right, they don't know.

1258
00:47:24,906 --> 00:47:25,976
I was referring to this jacket.

1259
00:47:26,676 --> 00:47:28,245
Why would you look it up?

1260
00:47:28,246 --> 00:47:29,246
(The picture where Song Eun I looks like an alien)

1261
00:47:29,247 --> 00:47:31,485
Hey, we're filming.

1262
00:47:31,486 --> 00:47:32,885
- You look the same.
- You look very similar to that.

1263
00:47:32,886 --> 00:47:34,255
You look very similar to that.

1264
00:47:34,256 --> 00:47:36,185
These are the same pants.

1265
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:38,896
- No. Why would you chime in?
- Your pants...

1266
00:47:38,996 --> 00:47:41,426
- You look similar to that day.
- All you need are sunglasses.

1267
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:44,426
- No.
- Look at the whole picture.

1268
00:47:46,496 --> 00:47:47,995
Her outfit to this wedding was legendary.

1269
00:47:47,996 --> 00:47:49,506
People thought she was an alien.

1270
00:47:51,636 --> 00:47:52,905
A lot of people thought I was photoshopped into the picture.

1271
00:47:52,906 --> 00:47:55,046
(From alien to photoshop, it sparked lots of rumors.)

1272
00:47:55,146 --> 00:47:58,346
This one show asked people if they thought this picture was real.

1273
00:47:58,776 --> 00:48:00,016
It really looks like you were photoshopped.

1274
00:48:00,476 --> 00:48:03,445
- It really looks like it.
- Right, look at the whole picture.

1275
00:48:03,446 --> 00:48:05,416
So was that you...

1276
00:48:05,656 --> 00:48:07,085
- dressing up or...
- That was her dressing up.

1277
00:48:07,086 --> 00:48:08,956
- She dressed up like that.
- did you have a work thing?

1278
00:48:09,056 --> 00:48:10,386
I cannot not dress up for a wedding.

1279
00:48:11,726 --> 00:48:13,455
(Eun I opens up about the truth behind that wedding.)

1280
00:48:13,456 --> 00:48:14,526
She looks exactly like this picture.

1281
00:48:15,166 --> 00:48:17,125
- I couldn't wear just anything.
- This is so funny.

1282
00:48:17,126 --> 00:48:19,535
I thought you were a time traveler.

1283
00:48:19,536 --> 00:48:21,095
(Song Eun I's alien-style wedding guest outfit was real.)

1284
00:48:21,096 --> 00:48:22,736
If the chive jeon waffle is a real dish,

1285
00:48:23,106 --> 00:48:24,735
I feel like they should sell makgeolli by the cup.

1286
00:48:24,736 --> 00:48:25,775
- As a set?
- Yes.

1287
00:48:25,776 --> 00:48:27,505
Then I would definitely order it.

1288
00:48:27,506 --> 00:48:29,376
- Are you trying to stay overnight?
- No.

1289
00:48:29,876 --> 00:48:31,476
- This would be perfect for drinks.
- Why would you mention makgeolli?

1290
00:48:31,676 --> 00:48:33,715
- Yes, it would be perfect.
- The ingredients scream alcohol.

1291
00:48:33,716 --> 00:48:34,716
I've been considering that too.

1292
00:48:34,816 --> 00:48:35,846
(The owner appeared.)

1293
00:48:35,946 --> 00:48:37,645
- Alcohol like makgeoilli or moju?
- Yes.

1294
00:48:37,646 --> 00:48:38,685
It sounds like a good idea.

1295
00:48:38,686 --> 00:48:40,616
- Just a cup to go with this.
- Right.

1296
00:48:40,786 --> 00:48:42,456
Why are you giving her a solution, all of a sudden?

1297
00:48:43,186 --> 00:48:44,686
- I just got excited at the idea.
- Hey, CEO Song.

1298
00:48:45,126 --> 00:48:46,756
- I hope it's successful.
- What do you think, Mimi?

1299
00:48:46,856 --> 00:48:48,496
The chive jeon waffle is so good.

1300
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:51,596
- I think it's real.
- I think it's real too.

1301
00:48:51,796 --> 00:48:54,096
- This is hard to tell.
- It is.

1302
00:48:54,736 --> 00:48:57,965
(A new dish in 10 years, the 2nd-generation owner's...)

1303
00:48:57,966 --> 00:49:00,976
(hard work in making it, the perilla leaves are too strong?)

1304
00:49:01,575 --> 00:49:05,215
(They're on their way to 30 Million Bowls.)

1305
00:49:05,245 --> 00:49:06,245
(Shocked)

1306
00:49:06,246 --> 00:49:07,614
We're passing by a school.

1307
00:49:07,615 --> 00:49:09,054
(The students are surprised to see the Sixth Sense members in person.)

1308
00:49:09,055 --> 00:49:11,214
- This is a girls' middle school.
- Sungshin Girls' Middle School.

1309
00:49:11,215 --> 00:49:12,285
The campus is so pretty.

1310
00:49:13,355 --> 00:49:14,684
Gosh, this school is so nice.

1311
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:16,524
- Hello.
- Hello.

1312
00:49:16,525 --> 00:49:18,424
The campus is so nice.

1313
00:49:18,425 --> 00:49:20,665
- The campus is so nice.
- It's so nice.

1314
00:49:21,195 --> 00:49:22,665
Where is 30 Million Bowls?

1315
00:49:23,265 --> 00:49:24,934
I think it's over here.

1316
00:49:24,935 --> 00:49:26,335
Where? It's here.

1317
00:49:27,335 --> 00:49:29,634
- Over here.
- This is it.

1318
00:49:29,635 --> 00:49:31,574
(Is this building across the school 30 Million Bowls?)

1319
00:49:31,575 --> 00:49:33,045
I smell food.

1320
00:49:33,505 --> 00:49:35,615
- This is it.
- It's here.

1321
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:37,314
I smell food.

1322
00:49:37,315 --> 00:49:38,315
Gosh.

1323
00:49:38,615 --> 00:49:39,714
(They follow the smell of food.)

1324
00:49:39,715 --> 00:49:41,584
Hello.

1325
00:49:41,585 --> 00:49:42,815
This is it.

1326
00:49:43,085 --> 00:49:44,685
What are you eating? Gosh, this is...

1327
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:46,124
What?

1328
00:49:46,125 --> 00:49:47,925
(The restaurant is full.)

1329
00:49:50,925 --> 00:49:54,625
(This restaurant has been...)

1330
00:49:55,565 --> 00:49:57,864
(a trendy place for 48 years...)

1331
00:49:57,865 --> 00:50:01,365
(because of this bowl of kalguksu.)

1332
00:50:01,905 --> 00:50:03,934
(When you search their hashtag on Instagram, )

1333
00:50:03,935 --> 00:50:06,245
(you have to scroll down endlessly.)

1334
00:50:06,405 --> 00:50:08,074
(The food is tasty. The portion is big.)

1335
00:50:08,075 --> 00:50:12,014
(Most of the 10,000 reviews say the food is tasty!)

1336
00:50:12,015 --> 00:50:16,715
(This restaurant is recommended to people visiting Jeonju.)

1337
00:50:17,185 --> 00:50:19,825
(A must-visit in Jeonju)

1338
00:50:20,285 --> 00:50:25,795
(It's crowded with people both inside and outside.)

1339
00:50:26,125 --> 00:50:29,935
(What could be the secret of 30 Million Bowls?)

1340
00:50:30,065 --> 00:50:32,094
(Coming soon)

1341
00:50:32,095 --> 00:50:33,105
Gosh.

1342
00:50:33,165 --> 00:50:34,365
Hello.

1343
00:50:34,735 --> 00:50:35,905
Hello.

1344
00:50:36,505 --> 00:50:38,945
(Looking around)

1345
00:50:39,605 --> 00:50:41,205
What are you eating... Gosh, this is...

1346
00:50:41,745 --> 00:50:44,115
- This place must be famous.
- Right.

1347
00:50:44,245 --> 00:50:45,844
I think they really did sell 30 million bowls.

1348
00:50:45,845 --> 00:50:47,814
I think so too.

1349
00:50:47,815 --> 00:50:49,985
This place is 100 percent real. Oh, hello.

1350
00:50:50,855 --> 00:50:52,984
I think they sell kalguksu.

1351
00:50:52,985 --> 00:50:54,054
This place is...

1352
00:50:54,055 --> 00:50:55,594
- They sell noodles, my favorite.
- Noodles.

1353
00:50:55,595 --> 00:50:56,624
- Hey.
- Noodles.

1354
00:50:56,625 --> 00:50:57,854
You look so happy right now.

1355
00:50:57,855 --> 00:51:00,064
- Noodles are my favorite.
- Noodles.

1356
00:51:00,065 --> 00:51:01,365
- They sell kalguksu.
- This is...

1357
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:02,864
the perfect moment. I've been...

1358
00:51:02,865 --> 00:51:03,964
- Craving noodles?
- Yes.

1359
00:51:03,965 --> 00:51:04,965
Noodles.

1360
00:51:05,905 --> 00:51:08,304
- Today's course is great.
- I love it.

1361
00:51:08,305 --> 00:51:09,904
- Jjolmyeon sounds good.
- I've been craving it.

1362
00:51:09,905 --> 00:51:11,805
- Noodles like jjolmyeon.
- Seriously, I...

1363
00:51:12,205 --> 00:51:13,844
(Surprised)

1364
00:51:13,845 --> 00:51:14,845
(Laughing)

1365
00:51:14,846 --> 00:51:16,114
- This place is perfect.
- The food is going to be good.

1366
00:51:16,115 --> 00:51:17,314
- This place is perfect.
- Jae Seok.

1367
00:51:17,315 --> 00:51:18,944
This restaurant is obviously real.

1368
00:51:18,945 --> 00:51:20,384
It's definitely real.

1369
00:51:20,385 --> 00:51:21,885
It can't be fake.

1370
00:51:22,815 --> 00:51:24,754
This place can't be fake.

1371
00:51:24,755 --> 00:51:26,454
This restaurant sold 30 million bowls?

1372
00:51:26,455 --> 00:51:28,184
- Apparently so.
- It makes sense, though.

1373
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:30,124
Judging by the size of this dining area,

1374
00:51:30,125 --> 00:51:32,024
- thirty million bowls make sense.
- It does.

1375
00:51:32,025 --> 00:51:34,994
I feel like it's too easy today.

1376
00:51:34,995 --> 00:51:37,334
It's like they're giving us the answer.

1377
00:51:37,335 --> 00:51:38,934
Right.

1378
00:51:38,935 --> 00:51:40,435
The staff...

1379
00:51:41,005 --> 00:51:43,834
- underestimated us.
- They definitely did.

1380
00:51:43,835 --> 00:51:44,905
He's coming.

1381
00:51:45,305 --> 00:51:46,704
- Hello.
- Hello.

1382
00:51:46,705 --> 00:51:47,974
Hello.

1383
00:51:47,975 --> 00:51:49,674
How long has this restaurant been open?

1384
00:51:49,675 --> 00:51:52,344
This restaurant first opened in 1977.

1385
00:51:52,345 --> 00:51:53,414
(It's been open for 48 years.)

1386
00:51:53,415 --> 00:51:55,444
- That's the year my mom was born.
- Forty-eight years.

1387
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:56,614
- Really?
- Yes.

1388
00:51:56,615 --> 00:51:57,754
It's as old as my mom.

1389
00:51:57,755 --> 00:52:00,124
- Your mom was born in 1977?
- Yes.

1390
00:52:00,125 --> 00:52:01,824
Then I really am old enough to be your dad.

1391
00:52:01,825 --> 00:52:02,825
You really are.

1392
00:52:02,826 --> 00:52:04,695
- I was born in 1976.
- Right.

1393
00:52:05,355 --> 00:52:07,225
- REI's mom is younger than us.
- She is.

1394
00:52:08,165 --> 00:52:09,765
- She really is.
- Everything looks delicious.

1395
00:52:09,995 --> 00:52:13,004
This place was introduced to us as 30 Million Bowls.

1396
00:52:13,005 --> 00:52:16,435
Well, since we've been open for about 48 years,

1397
00:52:16,975 --> 00:52:18,334
- You sold that much?
- if we add up...

1398
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:19,704
all the bowls of noodles we sold,

1399
00:52:19,705 --> 00:52:21,674
we think the number would be at least 30 million.

1400
00:52:21,675 --> 00:52:23,344
- Of course.
- This place feels real.

1401
00:52:23,345 --> 00:52:25,075
I feel like they could have sold more than 30 million bowls.

1402
00:52:25,515 --> 00:52:26,914
What's the signature dish here?

1403
00:52:26,915 --> 00:52:28,314
- This place is definitely real.
- Here,

1404
00:52:28,315 --> 00:52:30,314
- the kalguksu is the most famous.
- The kalguksu.

1405
00:52:30,315 --> 00:52:32,184
Recently, our patrons have been loving...

1406
00:52:32,185 --> 00:52:33,324
the black soybean noodles.

1407
00:52:33,325 --> 00:52:34,655
- Black soybean noodles?
- Yes.

1408
00:52:35,955 --> 00:52:38,295
- Is it that blue one?
- That's right.

1409
00:52:40,225 --> 00:52:43,095
(Their recently-launched new dish is blue-black soybean noodles?)

1410
00:52:45,935 --> 00:52:49,104
(This restaurant sold 30 million bowls of kalguksu!)

1411
00:52:49,105 --> 00:52:52,605
About 1,500 to 2,000 people visit us a day.

1412
00:52:52,875 --> 00:52:54,404
I make 10,000 dollars in daily sales.

1413
00:52:54,405 --> 00:52:57,475
So, I make about 300,000 dollars in monthly sales.

1414
00:52:57,975 --> 00:53:02,785
(Of course, the number 1 menu is kalguksu.)

1415
00:53:03,885 --> 00:53:08,225
(Did they launch a new menu at the kalguksu place?)

1416
00:53:08,785 --> 00:53:13,095
(The visual of black soybean noodles shocks the Sixth Sense members.)

1417
00:53:14,565 --> 00:53:17,435
(The black soybean noodles, the new menu, is coming soon.)

1418
00:53:17,465 --> 00:53:18,964
Normally, the soybean noodles...

1419
00:53:18,965 --> 00:53:20,464
- are in a beige color.
- Yes.

1420
00:53:20,465 --> 00:53:22,365
But that's greenish. That must be...

1421
00:53:23,135 --> 00:53:24,904
- When you put those, - the new menu.

1422
00:53:24,905 --> 00:53:26,074
How does it taste?

1423
00:53:26,075 --> 00:53:27,844
- How is it different?
- Compared to the regular one,

1424
00:53:27,845 --> 00:53:28,974
the black soybean noodles...

1425
00:53:28,975 --> 00:53:30,074
- are more flavorful.
- It's more flavorful.

1426
00:53:30,075 --> 00:53:32,015
- So...
- When did you launch it?

1427
00:53:32,145 --> 00:53:33,914
- The black soybean one.
- About that,

1428
00:53:33,915 --> 00:53:36,555
we sold black soybean milk during the pandemic.

1429
00:53:36,955 --> 00:53:39,484
It became popular online.

1430
00:53:39,485 --> 00:53:41,354
Since last year, we started making it...

1431
00:53:41,355 --> 00:53:42,924
- by putting noodles in it.
- Noodles?

1432
00:53:42,925 --> 00:53:43,994
(The black soybean noodles were launched last year.)

1433
00:53:43,995 --> 00:53:47,364
- You've sold it since last year.
- Yes.

1434
00:53:47,365 --> 00:53:48,465
Is it selling well?

1435
00:53:48,495 --> 00:53:51,194
It's popular among the young people...

1436
00:53:51,195 --> 00:53:53,104
- because of its unique visuals.
- Really?

1437
00:53:53,105 --> 00:53:54,664
- You've sold it since last year.
- Yes.

1438
00:53:54,665 --> 00:53:55,704
(Staring)

1439
00:53:55,705 --> 00:53:57,374
- I think you're lying.
- Pardon?

1440
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:58,435
The look on your face is a bit...

1441
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:01,774
- Thank you.
- Yes. Thank you.

1442
00:54:01,775 --> 00:54:04,445
- Thank you.
- If anything is fake at this place,

1443
00:54:04,675 --> 00:54:07,145
- it's the black soybean noodles.
- It's the black soybean noodles.

1444
00:54:07,685 --> 00:54:10,085
I observed the tables on my way, but many people were eating it.

1445
00:54:10,285 --> 00:54:11,285
- Really?
- Yes.

1446
00:54:11,286 --> 00:54:13,184
- Really?
- I wondered what the green one was.

1447
00:54:13,185 --> 00:54:14,755
- Me too. On my way in...
- Many tables had it.

1448
00:54:15,025 --> 00:54:17,195
(When they were entering the place...)

1449
00:54:17,225 --> 00:54:18,625
(Watching carefully)

1450
00:54:18,955 --> 00:54:21,725
(The suspicious dish was seen all around.)

1451
00:54:21,795 --> 00:54:23,465
A lot of people were eating it.

1452
00:54:23,695 --> 00:54:25,394
It's their fake menu.

1453
00:54:25,395 --> 00:54:27,304
In fact, the menu board looks so new.

1454
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:28,905
(While others are busy guessing, Tae Hyun is on his own.)

1455
00:54:29,065 --> 00:54:30,735
- If it's 17,520...
- Right?

1456
00:54:31,175 --> 00:54:32,845
(Touching)

1457
00:54:35,305 --> 00:54:37,175
- Are you calculating something?
- Yes.

1458
00:54:37,515 --> 00:54:39,715
- Why? What?
- If they sell 30 million bowls...

1459
00:54:39,785 --> 00:54:40,785
How much will it be?

1460
00:54:40,786 --> 00:54:41,814
(Scratching)

1461
00:54:41,815 --> 00:54:43,984
- He's something.
- Gosh.

1462
00:54:43,985 --> 00:54:45,215
You act as if you're sharp.

1463
00:54:46,985 --> 00:54:48,184
- What a mathematician.
- Gosh.

1464
00:54:48,185 --> 00:54:49,994
- As if he's a mathematician.
- Is this right?

1465
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:53,025
If it's real, this program is no fun, isn't it?

1466
00:54:53,565 --> 00:54:55,364
- What?
- It can be fun.

1467
00:54:55,365 --> 00:54:56,665
Don't say that.

1468
00:54:57,535 --> 00:55:00,005
- Why are you so aggressive?
- "Handsome Guys." Gosh.

1469
00:55:00,335 --> 00:55:01,534
It's not fun at all.

1470
00:55:01,535 --> 00:55:04,005
"Handsome Guys," why do you say such a thing?

1471
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:06,405
Is this why they're so popular?

1472
00:55:07,505 --> 00:55:09,445
(Laughing)

1473
00:55:09,575 --> 00:55:11,575
(Cracking up)

1474
00:55:11,645 --> 00:55:12,684
Is this why?

1475
00:55:12,685 --> 00:55:15,344
(Pouting)

1476
00:55:15,345 --> 00:55:16,654
- You have to make wild guesses.
- I've never seen him...

1477
00:55:16,655 --> 00:55:17,955
riled up like this.

1478
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:20,324
(Taking off)

1479
00:55:20,325 --> 00:55:22,695
- What a bad timing, though.
- Gosh.

1480
00:55:22,755 --> 00:55:24,525
- This is the alien outfit.
- I can't take my jacket off.

1481
00:55:24,695 --> 00:55:26,765
Come on, Eun I. Show it to us.

1482
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:29,064
- I can't take it off.
- It's pretty.

1483
00:55:29,065 --> 00:55:30,535
- It's the alien outfit.
- This is...

1484
00:55:31,395 --> 00:55:32,934
- I just wear whatever they get me.
- Right.

1485
00:55:32,935 --> 00:55:35,605
- I don't know fashion.
- It looks like TGI Fridays.

1486
00:55:35,905 --> 00:55:37,375
Because of the checkered pattern?

1487
00:55:37,605 --> 00:55:40,345
- For the wedding...
- Choi Hwa Jeong likes plaids.

1488
00:55:40,705 --> 00:55:42,845
- The red plaids.
- It's TGI Fridays.

1489
00:55:43,115 --> 00:55:44,615
Did you wear your clothes for that wedding?

1490
00:55:44,945 --> 00:55:47,244
- That one? No, it was for a show.
- Did you own those clothes?

1491
00:55:47,245 --> 00:55:48,284
Really?

1492
00:55:48,285 --> 00:55:49,415
Does it look weirder now?

1493
00:55:50,285 --> 00:55:52,155
- Mimi, you're shocked.
- Well...

1494
00:55:52,255 --> 00:55:53,855
It caused a rumor that Eun I was an alien.

1495
00:55:54,485 --> 00:55:56,294
- You're shocked, right?
- REI, did it happen to you too?

1496
00:55:56,295 --> 00:55:58,225
- A photo that got viral or so.
- Right.

1497
00:55:58,455 --> 00:56:00,465
Recently, that one has become a meme.

1498
00:56:00,565 --> 00:56:02,565
- Charging Guinea? Yes.
- Yes. Charging Guinea.

1499
00:56:03,195 --> 00:56:04,764
(Gen Z dictionary: Charging Guinea)

1500
00:56:04,765 --> 00:56:06,734
(A coinage for dancing REI being so cute like a charging guinea pig)

1501
00:56:06,735 --> 00:56:07,764
(Guinea pigs)

1502
00:56:07,765 --> 00:56:11,375
(Do we look alike?)

1503
00:56:14,205 --> 00:56:16,075
- Yes.
- What's a guinea, though?

1504
00:56:16,315 --> 00:56:17,744
A guinea pig.

1505
00:56:17,745 --> 00:56:19,314
- I look like a charging guinea pig.
- I don't get it.

1506
00:56:19,315 --> 00:56:20,915
You're cuter than a guinea pig.

1507
00:56:21,085 --> 00:56:23,084
- Are you happy about that?
- Yes.

1508
00:56:23,085 --> 00:56:24,515
- That you look like a guinea pig?
- Yes.

1509
00:56:25,255 --> 00:56:27,084
Hold on. He responds like this...

1510
00:56:27,085 --> 00:56:29,424
because he holds a grudge against guinea pigs.

1511
00:56:29,425 --> 00:56:31,394
- No. I don't know how they look.
- To me,

1512
00:56:31,395 --> 00:56:32,594
- they are so cute.
- Guinea pigs.

1513
00:56:32,595 --> 00:56:34,094
- Really? I should look it up.
- Tae Hyun.

1514
00:56:34,095 --> 00:56:36,265
- They look adorable a bit.
- How adorable!

1515
00:56:37,795 --> 00:56:40,334
(She certainly looks like a guinea pig.)

1516
00:56:40,335 --> 00:56:42,035
Wait. It's pretty.

1517
00:56:42,405 --> 00:56:44,504
- I told you.
- Because it's a guinea pig,

1518
00:56:44,505 --> 00:56:46,104
- I only thought of a pig.
- That's possible.

1519
00:56:46,105 --> 00:56:48,145
(REI is adorable.)

1520
00:56:48,375 --> 00:56:50,215
- She's much cuter, though.
- It's here.

1521
00:56:53,285 --> 00:56:55,784
(The visual of black soybean noodles shocks the Sixth Sense members.)

1522
00:56:55,785 --> 00:56:58,085
- Hold on.
- That's how it looks.

1523
00:56:58,615 --> 00:57:02,355
(The soybean noodles we know are usually white.)

1524
00:57:03,125 --> 00:57:05,995
(But theirs are green!)

1525
00:57:06,295 --> 00:57:10,135
(A thick green soybean milk...)

1526
00:57:10,365 --> 00:57:13,065
(topped with a generous amount of a fresh green garnish)

1527
00:57:13,665 --> 00:57:16,534
(A green soybean noodles you've never seen elsewhere)

1528
00:57:16,535 --> 00:57:19,745
Since we are the noodle shop representing Jeonju,

1529
00:57:19,805 --> 00:57:22,245
our customers wanted new menus.

1530
00:57:22,305 --> 00:57:25,984
The black soybean milk was popular in our online store.

1531
00:57:25,985 --> 00:57:27,945
So we decided to make it into a menu for the restaurant.

1532
00:57:29,485 --> 00:57:31,755
The young people love unique visuals.

1533
00:57:32,455 --> 00:57:34,125
Just like Mount Moak,

1534
00:57:34,255 --> 00:57:37,295
I thought of piling the garnish up.

1535
00:57:38,195 --> 00:57:39,595
(Piling up Mount Moak again)

1536
00:57:40,225 --> 00:57:43,234
(A bold look targeting the Gen MZ)

1537
00:57:43,235 --> 00:57:45,094
I think we're the only restaurant in Korea...

1538
00:57:45,095 --> 00:57:46,965
that sells the soybean noodles that are green.

1539
00:57:47,865 --> 00:57:49,034
(It has become viral thanks to its visuals and taste.)

1540
00:57:49,035 --> 00:57:50,304
(I enjoyed it very much this summer. It's a must-visit during summer.)

1541
00:57:50,305 --> 00:57:51,704
(It's the best one I've had. It's so thick and creamy.)

1542
00:57:51,705 --> 00:57:53,105
(Hold on!)

1543
00:57:53,875 --> 00:57:56,414
(The black soybeans are black.)

1544
00:57:56,415 --> 00:57:59,785
(But how does the soymilk look green?)

1545
00:58:00,315 --> 00:58:03,755
(Did you know?)

1546
00:58:03,985 --> 00:58:06,985
(The inside of the black soybeans is green.)

1547
00:58:07,155 --> 00:58:09,125
To make its texture as soft as possible,

1548
00:58:09,425 --> 00:58:11,724
after boiling the beans,

1549
00:58:11,725 --> 00:58:14,164
we get rid of the black hulls with our hands one by one...

1550
00:58:14,165 --> 00:58:15,564
until only the kernels are left.

1551
00:58:15,565 --> 00:58:17,435
(Removing the hulls manually requires much effort.)

1552
00:58:18,335 --> 00:58:20,104
Then we grind the kernels.

1553
00:58:20,105 --> 00:58:21,205
(The soybean without hulls)

1554
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:25,405
We grind the kernels until it has a creamy texture...

1555
00:58:25,475 --> 00:58:26,605
to make the soymilk.

1556
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:30,675
(The creamy soymilk is ready.)

1557
00:58:30,775 --> 00:58:32,314
At the factory we run,

1558
00:58:32,315 --> 00:58:34,844
they make the noodles early in the morning...

1559
00:58:34,845 --> 00:58:36,255
and send them to the restaurant.

1560
00:58:36,655 --> 00:58:38,754
(To the well-cooked buckwheat noodles, )

1561
00:58:38,755 --> 00:58:40,985
We boil the buckwheat noodles and pour the soymilk.

1562
00:58:41,855 --> 00:58:46,365
(they add the thick soymilk.)

1563
00:58:46,765 --> 00:58:48,564
(Aromatic minari and crunchy bean sprouts)

1564
00:58:48,565 --> 00:58:51,494
To make it as flavorful as possible,

1565
00:58:51,495 --> 00:58:52,635
we make the garnish.

1566
00:58:56,135 --> 00:58:59,005
(The garnish is placed carefully on the black soybean noodles.)

1567
00:58:59,205 --> 00:59:02,174
(Forget about dull soybean noodles. Green soybean noodles are complete.)

1568
00:59:02,175 --> 00:59:04,874
Sixth Sense members, do you think this menu is real?

1569
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:10,085
(Sixth Sense members, do you think this menu is real?)

1570
00:59:10,185 --> 00:59:12,484
- Gosh. It's so...
- There are minari and bean sprouts.

1571
00:59:12,485 --> 00:59:14,354
It looks really good.

1572
00:59:14,355 --> 00:59:15,854
- Gosh.
- What's the topping? Spinach?

1573
00:59:15,855 --> 00:59:17,155
Does it look tasty to you?

1574
00:59:17,525 --> 00:59:19,565
I felt the same.

1575
00:59:19,695 --> 00:59:21,164
I was shocked by how it actually looks.

1576
00:59:21,165 --> 00:59:22,935
- What is this?
- If you like minari, there's more.

1577
00:59:23,895 --> 00:59:26,804
(Green soybean noodles people either love or hate)

1578
00:59:26,805 --> 00:59:29,064
Gosh. This looks like the melon ice cream bar.

1579
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:30,604
- It does.
- The Melona ice bar.

1580
00:59:30,605 --> 00:59:32,204
- That's true.
- The color is so pretty.

1581
00:59:32,205 --> 00:59:33,475
Thanks for the food.

1582
00:59:33,505 --> 00:59:34,975
Gosh. It feels like cream.

1583
00:59:35,475 --> 00:59:37,115
(Amazed)

1584
00:59:37,715 --> 00:59:41,184
(Does it suit Kochelin's palate?)

1585
00:59:41,185 --> 00:59:42,485
(Surprised)

1586
00:59:42,715 --> 00:59:44,484
This soymilk...

1587
00:59:44,485 --> 00:59:45,954
- has such a great texture.
- This soymilk...

1588
00:59:45,955 --> 00:59:47,685
is amazing. It's so good.

1589
00:59:47,955 --> 00:59:50,095
It's much softer than the regular soybean noodles.

1590
00:59:51,595 --> 00:59:54,624
(It's much softer without the rough hulls.)

1591
00:59:54,625 --> 00:59:56,635
They use buckwheat noodles.

1592
00:59:56,735 --> 00:59:58,364
- Are they buckwheat noodles?
- Yes.

1593
00:59:58,365 --> 00:59:59,604
(They try it with the noodles this time.)

1594
00:59:59,605 --> 01:00:00,635
(Savoring)

1595
01:00:00,705 --> 01:00:03,575
(Taking a bite with lots of minari)

1596
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:05,735
(Savoring)

1597
01:00:07,275 --> 01:00:09,204
(Will it suit REI's palate?)

1598
01:00:09,205 --> 01:00:11,674
- CEO Song loves minari.
- That's right.

1599
01:00:11,675 --> 01:00:12,884
(Nodding with satisfaction)

1600
01:00:12,885 --> 01:00:14,115
REI eats it well.

1601
01:00:14,185 --> 01:00:16,214
- I've never had it before, - I see.

1602
01:00:16,215 --> 01:00:17,715
- but I'm totally fine with it.
- Right?

1603
01:00:18,085 --> 01:00:19,625
- Should I stop eating?
- It's really good.

1604
01:00:19,985 --> 01:00:21,625
It's the best soybean noodles I've ever had.

1605
01:00:22,825 --> 01:00:24,995
I love minari, and it's so tasty.

1606
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:28,064
(The garnish of minari and bean sprouts...)

1607
01:00:28,065 --> 01:00:30,134
(is piled up like a mountain.)

1608
01:00:30,135 --> 01:00:31,595
CEO Song loves minari.

1609
01:00:31,765 --> 01:00:32,804
That's right.

1610
01:00:32,805 --> 01:00:33,904
(CEO Song, the minari-devouring one)

1611
01:00:33,905 --> 01:00:34,905
(A minari aficionado)

1612
01:00:34,906 --> 01:00:35,964
- Minari...
- She had a bucket of it...

1613
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:37,035
at the barbecue place.

1614
01:00:37,335 --> 01:00:39,875
(She still loves minari.)

1615
01:00:40,005 --> 01:00:41,474
Minari has a unique scent.

1616
01:00:41,475 --> 01:00:43,915
The heaviness of the noodles are complemented by minari.

1617
01:00:44,575 --> 01:00:45,845
- Right.
- It's crazy.

1618
01:00:46,445 --> 01:00:48,515
It's so good. Try it with the minari.

1619
01:00:48,945 --> 01:00:50,085
It's seasoned perfectly.

1620
01:00:50,585 --> 01:00:52,814
The minari and bean sprouts are seasoned perfectly.

1621
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:54,084
It's perfectly seasoned.

1622
01:00:54,085 --> 01:00:56,194
Also, while eating this, I feel like...

1623
01:00:56,195 --> 01:00:58,125
- I'm getting healthier.
- That's right.

1624
01:00:58,255 --> 01:00:59,894
- You're right.
- Yes. It's tasty.

1625
01:00:59,895 --> 01:01:01,494
- That's right.
- You're right.

1626
01:01:01,495 --> 01:01:02,864
(While everyone is complimenting it, )

1627
01:01:02,865 --> 01:01:04,595
(he picks at it.)

1628
01:01:04,735 --> 01:01:06,665
- Tae Hyun.
- Kalguksu is coming too.

1629
01:01:07,765 --> 01:01:10,335
You pretended to get a lot but grabbed so little.

1630
01:01:10,405 --> 01:01:11,434
(Clicking his tongue)

1631
01:01:11,435 --> 01:01:13,075
- You eat a lot.
- He's an actor.

1632
01:01:13,405 --> 01:01:14,474
He's different.

1633
01:01:14,475 --> 01:01:16,474
He hid the noodles with minari.

1634
01:01:16,475 --> 01:01:17,514
(Tae Hyun who eats like a bird)

1635
01:01:17,515 --> 01:01:19,785
He's putting on a fake eating show.

1636
01:01:20,515 --> 01:01:23,015
By the way, it's tasty, indeed.

1637
01:01:23,355 --> 01:01:24,385
- Right?
- Yes.

1638
01:01:24,485 --> 01:01:26,385
It's tasty all right.

1639
01:01:27,125 --> 01:01:29,085
But as a regular viewer of the show,

1640
01:01:29,795 --> 01:01:31,455
doesn't it look so obviously fake?

1641
01:01:32,095 --> 01:01:33,225
All of a sudden?

1642
01:01:33,425 --> 01:01:35,365
- Out of the blue?
- He has just ruined my appetite.

1643
01:01:37,195 --> 01:01:38,195
(Childish Cha is here again.)

1644
01:01:38,196 --> 01:01:39,265
- All of a sudden?
- Gosh.

1645
01:01:39,665 --> 01:01:41,835
This program has nothing to do with me, anyway.

1646
01:01:42,935 --> 01:01:44,734
In fact, he tried not to eat this.

1647
01:01:44,735 --> 01:01:46,105
Actually, it's true.

1648
01:01:46,505 --> 01:01:47,804
It's indeed tasty,

1649
01:01:47,805 --> 01:01:50,514
- but is this menu created for us?
- Exactly, Eun I.

1650
01:01:50,515 --> 01:01:52,444
- That's what I'm saying.
- When we call this fake,

1651
01:01:52,445 --> 01:01:54,085
there's one thing I'm suspicious about.

1652
01:01:54,545 --> 01:01:56,654
- It's visually too much.
- That's right.

1653
01:01:56,655 --> 01:01:58,114
- That was what I was saying.
- Our...

1654
01:01:58,115 --> 01:01:59,454
(Are the visuals of it too much?)

1655
01:01:59,455 --> 01:02:01,984
They made it with our chefs to look nice.

1656
01:02:01,985 --> 01:02:03,654
Typically, this is how you should make it...

1657
01:02:03,655 --> 01:02:06,894
- to become viral on social media.
- That's right.

1658
01:02:06,895 --> 01:02:09,394
- It feels it's for social media.
- Right.

1659
01:02:09,395 --> 01:02:10,864
Even when we eat normal soybean noodles,

1660
01:02:10,865 --> 01:02:13,104
it's hard to finish it.

1661
01:02:13,105 --> 01:02:15,335
- It has a large amount.
- Right? They're like that.

1662
01:02:15,435 --> 01:02:17,934
The two of us are sharing one, but we can't finish it at all.

1663
01:02:17,935 --> 01:02:21,105
It's because you only pretended to eat it.

1664
01:02:21,305 --> 01:02:23,114
- Gosh. Tae Hyun.
- That's why.

1665
01:02:23,115 --> 01:02:24,214
(Clearing his throat)

1666
01:02:24,215 --> 01:02:25,344
- Mimi usually...
- You only had a little.

1667
01:02:25,345 --> 01:02:26,915
Never gets angry at a guest.

1668
01:02:27,585 --> 01:02:28,585
Goodness.

1669
01:02:28,586 --> 01:02:30,455
Mimi has the ownership about the show.

1670
01:02:32,185 --> 01:02:35,525
(Protect our Sixth Sense!)

1671
01:02:36,455 --> 01:02:37,854
- Kaguksu is here.
- Thank you.

1672
01:02:37,855 --> 01:02:39,725
- Gosh.
- Put it here. We'll share it.

1673
01:02:40,065 --> 01:02:41,825
- Gosh. It looks good.
- See? Look at this.

1674
01:02:42,825 --> 01:02:44,294
(The all-time favorite menu of this place, )

1675
01:02:44,295 --> 01:02:46,264
(kalguksu)

1676
01:02:46,265 --> 01:02:47,864
We started as a street food store...

1677
01:02:47,865 --> 01:02:49,435
in front of a girls' high school in 1977.

1678
01:02:49,605 --> 01:02:50,834
Because we were close to the school,

1679
01:02:50,835 --> 01:02:53,245
we wanted to serve foods with nutritious recipes.

1680
01:02:53,445 --> 01:02:54,805
We used more nutritious eggs too.

1681
01:02:55,145 --> 01:02:58,045
And we added perilla seed powder, chili powder, and laver flakes...

1682
01:02:58,415 --> 01:03:00,914
on top of it to create the best flavors.

1683
01:03:00,915 --> 01:03:02,985
(They've made the optimized recipe that's nutritious and tasty.)

1684
01:03:05,485 --> 01:03:07,055
To make it taste clean,

1685
01:03:07,155 --> 01:03:08,784
we use soy sauce as our base.

1686
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:09,955
(They boil it after adding their special soy sauce.)

1687
01:03:10,695 --> 01:03:12,394
We have to control the heat meticulously.

1688
01:03:12,395 --> 01:03:14,024
If we're not careful,

1689
01:03:14,025 --> 01:03:15,624
the noodles are undercooked or get soggy.

1690
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:16,634
(Boiling)

1691
01:03:16,635 --> 01:03:18,494
After cooking the noodles carefully,

1692
01:03:18,495 --> 01:03:20,104
we add green onions.

1693
01:03:20,105 --> 01:03:21,434
(We add the green onions and simmer it for a while.)

1694
01:03:21,435 --> 01:03:24,134
We coat the noodles with the eggs we've prepared.

1695
01:03:24,135 --> 01:03:26,034
(They mix it with the beaten egg, )

1696
01:03:26,035 --> 01:03:27,975
(so the noodles taste more flavorful.)

1697
01:03:28,145 --> 01:03:30,615
(Coating the noodles with the eggs)

1698
01:03:31,275 --> 01:03:33,985
We take out the egg-coated noodles...

1699
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:35,185
and separate them.

1700
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:36,585
(The noodles are placed in bowls and be on standby.)

1701
01:03:37,385 --> 01:03:39,284
We add the yolks to the remaining soup.

1702
01:03:39,285 --> 01:03:44,055
(Adding the eggs to the soup to make it more flavorful)

1703
01:03:45,125 --> 01:03:47,264
We pour the soup over the noodles.

1704
01:03:47,265 --> 01:03:49,165
(Adding the thick soup with eggs to the bowls of noodles)

1705
01:03:49,795 --> 01:03:52,295
(The soup with the eggs looks thick)

1706
01:03:52,665 --> 01:03:54,434
I place the garnishes of chili powder,

1707
01:03:54,435 --> 01:03:56,205
perilla seed powder, and laver flakes.

1708
01:03:56,305 --> 01:04:00,245
(Kalguksu that people keep craving after trying it once is ready.)

1709
01:04:00,645 --> 01:04:02,805
- Okay. Kyoung Pyo, let's try it.
- Go ahead.

1710
01:04:03,175 --> 01:04:05,514
- So it begins.
- Do we need time for this?

1711
01:04:05,515 --> 01:04:06,984
(Slurping)

1712
01:04:06,985 --> 01:04:07,985
Gosh. It's amazing.

1713
01:04:08,515 --> 01:04:10,715
(Resonating deeply)

1714
01:04:10,955 --> 01:04:13,154
(Get ready.)

1715
01:04:13,155 --> 01:04:16,085
(Slurping)

1716
01:04:17,095 --> 01:04:18,455
(Exclaiming)

1717
01:04:18,955 --> 01:04:20,024
(This is it.)

1718
01:04:20,025 --> 01:04:23,065
It's so good. I've been waiting for this all day.

1719
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:27,165
(I'm coming to greet you.)

1720
01:04:27,505 --> 01:04:29,205
(Blowing)

1721
01:04:29,505 --> 01:04:30,574
Gosh. It's amazing.

1722
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:32,804
(Tae Hyun, who eats like a bird, )

1723
01:04:32,805 --> 01:04:33,874
It's so good.

1724
01:04:33,875 --> 01:04:35,204
(is satisfied with it.)

1725
01:04:35,205 --> 01:04:36,274
It's good.

1726
01:04:36,275 --> 01:04:38,675
The beaten yolk is in it. Isn't it crazy?

1727
01:04:39,175 --> 01:04:41,485
(Savoring)

1728
01:04:41,685 --> 01:04:44,355
- Gosh. It's really good.
- This is it. It's really good.

1729
01:04:45,415 --> 01:04:46,554
- This is it.
- This is it.

1730
01:04:46,555 --> 01:04:47,885
- This is it.
- This is it, indeed.

1731
01:04:48,755 --> 01:04:50,154
Gosh. Did they put perilla seeds?

1732
01:04:50,155 --> 01:04:51,524
- What is this?
- I think they did.

1733
01:04:51,525 --> 01:04:52,595
- Right?
- Gosh.

1734
01:04:52,755 --> 01:04:54,725
- It has perilla seeds in it.
- Gosh. It's so good.

1735
01:04:56,295 --> 01:04:57,664
The noodles are medium-thick,

1736
01:04:57,665 --> 01:04:59,065
- not thick.
- Here.

1737
01:04:59,805 --> 01:05:01,805
(Generally, kalguksu noodles are thick.)

1738
01:05:02,865 --> 01:05:04,374
(But the kalguksu, sold 30 million bowls, )

1739
01:05:04,375 --> 01:05:05,834
(is known for its thin noodles.)

1740
01:05:05,835 --> 01:05:08,404
- A lot of eggs are beaten into it.
- Yes.

1741
01:05:08,405 --> 01:05:11,214
There are beaten yolks. It's crazy. The soup is very thick.

1742
01:05:11,215 --> 01:05:12,244
(The egg makes the soup more flavorful and softer.)

1743
01:05:12,245 --> 01:05:13,285
Once you had it,

1744
01:05:14,185 --> 01:05:15,784
you'd keep thinking about it.

1745
01:05:15,785 --> 01:05:17,515
Seriously. That's so true.

1746
01:05:17,985 --> 01:05:19,254
You'd want it...

1747
01:05:19,255 --> 01:05:20,524
- when you lose your appetite.
- You'd keep thinking about it.

1748
01:05:20,525 --> 01:05:21,525
- You're right.
- Yes.

1749
01:05:22,225 --> 01:05:24,654
Right now, even if one slaps me across my face,

1750
01:05:24,655 --> 01:05:25,954
I can smile about it.

1751
01:05:25,955 --> 01:05:27,295
- I can smile about it.
- Really?

1752
01:05:27,495 --> 01:05:28,594
Do you want me to slap you?

1753
01:05:28,595 --> 01:05:29,625
(No. Yes. No.)

1754
01:05:30,465 --> 01:05:31,695
- I really want to try it.
- Right.

1755
01:05:32,265 --> 01:05:34,365
- Right. It's just how you like it.
- It's perfect.

1756
01:05:34,565 --> 01:05:35,664
(Me too.)

1757
01:05:35,665 --> 01:05:37,634
- It's so good.
- I've never seen this one.

1758
01:05:37,635 --> 01:05:40,204
- REI enjoys kalguksu very much.
- Yes.

1759
01:05:40,205 --> 01:05:42,105
- She likes it.
- I eat a lot.

1760
01:05:42,345 --> 01:05:44,015
I eat a lot when it's tasty.

1761
01:05:44,375 --> 01:05:47,015
- And I like this one.
- Is that so?

1762
01:05:47,115 --> 01:05:50,155
She likes this one better than the other one.

1763
01:05:51,315 --> 01:05:53,625
- Gosh. It's really good.
- I think this is the fake place.

1764
01:05:54,055 --> 01:05:56,655
- Why?
- This kalguksu is good enough.

1765
01:05:56,755 --> 01:05:58,124
- Yes.
- They don't need another menu.

1766
01:05:58,125 --> 01:06:01,094
- It's too much.
- Yes. That one seems fake.

1767
01:06:01,095 --> 01:06:03,595
- It has a well-balanced taste, - Yes.

1768
01:06:04,365 --> 01:06:06,835
But it feels like it's created by our chefs.

1769
01:06:07,235 --> 01:06:08,735
But there's always this thing.

1770
01:06:09,265 --> 01:06:11,535
They have to keep making...

1771
01:06:12,135 --> 01:06:13,705
the new menu, the next popular dish.

1772
01:06:13,975 --> 01:06:17,145
Gosh. But he already sold 30 million bowls of it.

1773
01:06:17,245 --> 01:06:19,145
I'm not done speaking!

1774
01:06:20,315 --> 01:06:22,384
Jae Seok, isn't he being so greedy, then?

1775
01:06:22,385 --> 01:06:23,955
(Tae Hyun keeps irritating Jae Seok.)

1776
01:06:24,385 --> 01:06:27,385
- Gosh. Tae Hyun, that guy.
- Isn't it being so greedy?

1777
01:06:27,685 --> 01:06:30,024
Hey. One isn't always logical because they're old.

1778
01:06:30,025 --> 01:06:31,025
Exactly.

1779
01:06:31,125 --> 01:06:32,455
I guess you already know it because you've seen it.

1780
01:06:33,125 --> 01:06:35,694
The prices of the regular soybean noodles...

1781
01:06:35,695 --> 01:06:37,765
and the black soybean noodles are the same. Is that right?

1782
01:06:37,795 --> 01:06:39,294
(They're the same price.)

1783
01:06:39,295 --> 01:06:40,834
(Soybean noodles: 10 dollars, Black soybean noodles: 10 dollars)

1784
01:06:40,835 --> 01:06:42,135
That's true.

1785
01:06:42,565 --> 01:06:43,575
You're right.

1786
01:06:44,205 --> 01:06:45,835
But it has many ingredients in it.

1787
01:06:46,135 --> 01:06:49,405
But if it's pricier than that, it's not easy to order it.

1788
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:51,115
Right. People won't eat it.

1789
01:06:51,315 --> 01:06:53,744
And only that photo alone looks brand new.

1790
01:06:53,745 --> 01:06:56,315
- There are 2 and 3 frames.
- Yes.

1791
01:06:56,655 --> 01:06:59,455
- The frames' colors are different.
- Yes.

1792
01:06:59,685 --> 01:07:00,925
That one is so new.

1793
01:07:01,225 --> 01:07:03,655
- The floor looks different too.
- Yes.

1794
01:07:04,525 --> 01:07:07,325
Hey, are all of them fake, then?

1795
01:07:07,565 --> 01:07:08,595
Are all of them fake, then?

1796
01:07:09,565 --> 01:07:11,934
- We still have one place to go.
- Why are you looking at me?

1797
01:07:11,935 --> 01:07:12,935
(That's right.)

1798
01:07:12,936 --> 01:07:14,305
I was chewing my food.

1799
01:07:14,705 --> 01:07:17,535
- I didn't say anything.
- Alien, is everything fake, then?

1800
01:07:17,635 --> 01:07:20,644
- Are you looking down on me?
- "Alien."

1801
01:07:20,645 --> 01:07:21,674
- Alien, is everything fake, then?
- Why did you yell at me...

1802
01:07:21,675 --> 01:07:22,675
when I was eating my food?

1803
01:07:22,676 --> 01:07:25,315
He no longer calls her by name. It's "Alien."

1804
01:07:25,975 --> 01:07:27,815
We have to be careful.

1805
01:07:28,445 --> 01:07:30,754
We shouldn't be trapped in the idea of fake.

1806
01:07:30,755 --> 01:07:33,825
We keep getting suspicious, but it can be real.

1807
01:07:34,425 --> 01:07:36,484
Gosh. He's making a guess now that he finished his noodles.

1808
01:07:36,485 --> 01:07:37,524
(He's making a guess now that he finished his noodles.)

1809
01:07:37,525 --> 01:07:39,055
(Clean)

1810
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:41,924
- Finally, he pretends...
- Darn it. That guy.

1811
01:07:41,925 --> 01:07:43,265
To make educated guesses.

1812
01:07:43,365 --> 01:07:45,064
- He cleared the bowl.
- I know.

1813
01:07:45,065 --> 01:07:47,604
When we were talking, he didn't even listen.

1814
01:07:47,605 --> 01:07:49,404
- Gosh.
- He just kept eating kalguksu.

1815
01:07:49,405 --> 01:07:51,735
- It was so good.
- He's finally speaking now.

1816
01:07:52,805 --> 01:07:55,004
(Annoyed)

1817
01:07:55,005 --> 01:07:56,815
- It was so tasty.
- It's so good.

1818
01:07:57,575 --> 01:08:00,244
(Sipping the last bit of the soup)

1819
01:08:00,245 --> 01:08:01,314
I'll know for sure...

1820
01:08:01,315 --> 01:08:02,415
- when I go to the next place.
- Yes.

1821
01:08:03,185 --> 01:08:04,454
Now, it starts to confuse me.

1822
01:08:04,455 --> 01:08:06,484
Why do all places feel so fake today?

1823
01:08:06,485 --> 01:08:07,685
(The visuals are for social media, too tasty, doesn't need a new menu)

1824
01:08:08,385 --> 01:08:10,254
The spring is really here.

1825
01:08:10,255 --> 01:08:12,394
- Yes. It's spring.
- It's hot now.

1826
01:08:12,395 --> 01:08:13,425
(After eating well, they go on to enjoy the spring weather.)

1827
01:08:13,825 --> 01:08:15,465
It'll be perfect when we get a foot bath.

1828
01:08:15,825 --> 01:08:17,295
I think I'll be sleepy when I get a foot bath.

1829
01:08:18,065 --> 01:08:19,165
Hello.

1830
01:08:19,565 --> 01:08:21,065
(Looking at the map while they were moving)

1831
01:08:21,335 --> 01:08:23,504
(There's a massage and foot bath place.)

1832
01:08:23,505 --> 01:08:25,675
That's great.

1833
01:08:26,175 --> 01:08:30,275
(In fact, it's right next to 30 Million Bowls.)

1834
01:08:30,715 --> 01:08:32,845
(The course the Sixth Sense members were excited about)

1835
01:08:33,385 --> 01:08:34,445
I'm so full.

1836
01:08:35,115 --> 01:08:37,554
- You finished the whole kalguksu.
- Yes. It was so...

1837
01:08:37,555 --> 01:08:38,585
Hello.

1838
01:08:39,185 --> 01:08:40,255
(Goodness.)

1839
01:08:40,555 --> 01:08:41,555
(Jae Seok.)

1840
01:08:41,556 --> 01:08:42,625
(Nice to meet you.)

1841
01:08:43,495 --> 01:08:45,095
Jae Seok, you're going for an election, right?

1842
01:08:45,325 --> 01:08:46,964
- Hello.
- Gosh. How cute!

1843
01:08:46,965 --> 01:08:48,765
(He even says hello to a dog too.)

1844
01:08:49,295 --> 01:08:51,695
At a time like this, when we follow Locust,

1845
01:08:52,135 --> 01:08:53,234
it's easier to walk.

1846
01:08:53,235 --> 01:08:54,805
(When we follow Locust, it's easier to walk.)

1847
01:08:55,105 --> 01:08:56,905
- It's great advice.
- Totally.

1848
01:08:57,775 --> 01:09:00,174
- Yes. Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

1849
01:09:00,175 --> 01:09:01,204
(The beloved MC is opening up the path for them.)

1850
01:09:01,205 --> 01:09:02,474
(Comfortable)

1851
01:09:02,475 --> 01:09:04,375
Jae Seok greets them...

1852
01:09:04,615 --> 01:09:06,685
- before us.
- And we can just relax.

1853
01:09:07,445 --> 01:09:09,044
- It's a big tip.
- What a piece of advice.

1854
01:09:09,045 --> 01:09:10,315
(Jae Seok, thank you.)

1855
01:09:10,515 --> 01:09:12,784
- That looks tasty.
- It looks good.

1856
01:09:12,785 --> 01:09:13,855
- It's crazy.
- Gosh.

1857
01:09:14,355 --> 01:09:16,225
- There is so much tasty stuff.
- Exactly.

1858
01:09:17,125 --> 01:09:18,995
Gosh. They have everything.

1859
01:09:19,395 --> 01:09:21,325
(An endless runway of food)

1860
01:09:21,665 --> 01:09:22,964
- From bread...
- Corn.

1861
01:09:22,965 --> 01:09:25,164
- They have corn too.
- Corns are delicious.

1862
01:09:25,165 --> 01:09:27,564
- Gosh. It's a honey butter flavor.
- It looks good.

1863
01:09:27,565 --> 01:09:28,565
(The grilled honey butter corn smells good.)

1864
01:09:28,566 --> 01:09:30,205
They even sell yukjeon, the beef jeon.

1865
01:09:30,535 --> 01:09:32,004
- Gosh.
- It looks good.

1866
01:09:32,005 --> 01:09:33,505
(It's hard to go past yukjeon that smells so flavorful.)

1867
01:09:33,705 --> 01:09:35,475
- It's the 1-cent bread.
- The 1-cent bread.

1868
01:09:35,945 --> 01:09:37,444
The salted butter roll with ice cream...

1869
01:09:37,445 --> 01:09:38,975
- looks so good.
- That looks nice.

1870
01:09:39,815 --> 01:09:42,284
- Now that I'm full...
- It feels different than before.

1871
01:09:42,285 --> 01:09:43,484
Right.

1872
01:09:43,485 --> 01:09:44,684
- They don't grab my attention.
- They don't.

1873
01:09:44,685 --> 01:09:45,754
- Before we said, - They're not that satisfying.

1874
01:09:45,755 --> 01:09:48,025
"This looks tasty, and that looks tasty too."

1875
01:09:48,125 --> 01:09:50,395
- I'm so full from great food.
- Exactly.

1876
01:09:51,225 --> 01:09:52,994
We'll have the 5-Million-Dollar Feast, so...

1877
01:09:52,995 --> 01:09:56,195
Right. We never know what we'll have for that.

1878
01:09:57,495 --> 01:09:58,564
- We're here.
- Hello.

1879
01:09:58,565 --> 01:10:00,665
It's here. Jae Seok, it's the foot bath cafe.

1880
01:10:01,235 --> 01:10:03,705
- Where? Gosh.
- Hey. It's the foot bath cafe.

1881
01:10:05,335 --> 01:10:06,374
(The highlight of today's city tour...)

1882
01:10:06,375 --> 01:10:07,375
(the Sixth Sense members have been waiting for)

1883
01:10:07,376 --> 01:10:09,175
Gosh. This is...

1884
01:10:09,745 --> 01:10:11,445
It has such a nice view.

1885
01:10:12,545 --> 01:10:15,145
This is nice. After walking around...

1886
01:10:15,645 --> 01:10:17,615
- You can come when your feet hurt.
- Yes. It's perfect then.

1887
01:10:18,215 --> 01:10:20,885
- How did they come up with this?
- It'll be great.

1888
01:10:22,125 --> 01:10:25,155
- Gosh. What is this place?
- Gosh. It's nice here.

1889
01:10:25,425 --> 01:10:27,765
Do we get a foot bath while looking outside, sir?

1890
01:10:28,265 --> 01:10:30,165
It's perfect for this weather.

1891
01:10:31,195 --> 01:10:34,805
(The foot bath cafe is located at the center of the Hanok Village.)

1892
01:10:35,905 --> 01:10:38,705
(When you climb up the stairs to the 2nd floor, )

1893
01:10:40,175 --> 01:10:42,475
(the view captures your eyes as soon as you enter it.)

1894
01:10:43,145 --> 01:10:45,815
(Every seat has the view of the Hanok Village.)

1895
01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:48,414
(While sitting on a comfortable chair, )

1896
01:10:48,415 --> 01:10:51,315
(you can rest your feet from walking around.)

1897
01:10:51,755 --> 01:10:54,825
- This is awesome.
- Today's course is perfect.

1898
01:10:55,525 --> 01:10:56,825
- Hello.
- I might fall asleep.

1899
01:10:57,325 --> 01:10:59,195
(You can have a real-time fanmeet too.)

1900
01:10:59,495 --> 01:11:03,195
We watch them while they watch us.

1901
01:11:03,595 --> 01:11:06,395
Do you have a foot massage too?

1902
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:09,335
- Okay. I'll tell you how it goes.
- Okay.

1903
01:11:09,605 --> 01:11:11,535
- Take off your shoes.
- Okay.

1904
01:11:11,835 --> 01:11:14,904
Place your socks behind you near your hips.

1905
01:11:14,905 --> 01:11:15,905
- Yes.
- Okay.

1906
01:11:16,445 --> 01:11:18,475
- Kyoung Pyo, you're fast.
- I...

1907
01:11:19,045 --> 01:11:20,615
- Gosh.
- He's fast.

1908
01:11:20,815 --> 01:11:22,585
These are...

1909
01:11:22,885 --> 01:11:24,484
- functional aromatic salts.
- Gosh.

1910
01:11:24,485 --> 01:11:25,915
(Choose the aromatic salts with the scent you want!)

1911
01:11:25,985 --> 01:11:28,825
- You can choose 1 of the 3.
- I'll choose lavender.

1912
01:11:28,925 --> 01:11:31,054
- First, Eun I.
- I want lavender.

1913
01:11:31,055 --> 01:11:32,125
Lavender.

1914
01:11:32,425 --> 01:11:34,565
- I'll add a generous amount.
- Thank you.

1915
01:11:35,095 --> 01:11:36,894
(He's very generous.)

1916
01:11:36,895 --> 01:11:37,895
Generally...

1917
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:41,004
He looks like he's putting the powdered cream to coffee.

1918
01:11:41,005 --> 01:11:42,404
(Adding as if he's putting the powdered cream)

1919
01:11:42,405 --> 01:11:43,974
Sir, you're doing it...

1920
01:11:43,975 --> 01:11:45,505
as if you're adding the powdered cream to a coffee.

1921
01:11:46,205 --> 01:11:47,604
- I'll add it.
- Thank you.

1922
01:11:47,605 --> 01:11:50,675
I put a generous amount. Great. Please wait.

1923
01:11:51,375 --> 01:11:53,845
I can smell it.

1924
01:11:54,085 --> 01:11:56,115
You can smell it. It's a good one. They are expensive.

1925
01:11:56,645 --> 01:11:57,985
"They are expensive."

1926
01:11:58,185 --> 01:11:59,715
He's an expert.

1927
01:12:00,485 --> 01:12:01,724
- Okay.
- Okay. Stretch your feet.

1928
01:12:01,725 --> 01:12:02,954
Please straighten your legs.

1929
01:12:02,955 --> 01:12:05,155
- I straighten them.
- They are short, aren't they?

1930
01:12:05,295 --> 01:12:08,294
- Come on. Why did you say that?
- Sorry.

1931
01:12:08,295 --> 01:12:10,165
- Come on.
- That's the concept here.

1932
01:12:10,935 --> 01:12:13,864
He has been around for a long time too.

1933
01:12:13,865 --> 01:12:15,605
(His smooth comments show he's been around for a long time.)

1934
01:12:15,905 --> 01:12:17,135
I'm a shy person, though.

1935
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:18,705
(The introvert is already worried.)

1936
01:12:18,975 --> 01:12:21,245
"Straighten your legs. They are short, aren't they?"

1937
01:12:21,705 --> 01:12:22,774
Let's pray.

1938
01:12:22,775 --> 01:12:23,815
- Please let my cafe prosper.
- Gosh.

1939
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:26,574
(A hand massage is a disguise to pray for the cafe's prosperity.)

1940
01:12:26,575 --> 01:12:29,045
(Laughing)

1941
01:12:29,645 --> 01:12:32,684
- Sir, are you having a hard time?
- Please let my cafe prosper.

1942
01:12:32,685 --> 01:12:34,425
- I think it's doing really well.
- Hold on.

1943
01:12:34,525 --> 01:12:35,554
Okay. Stretch your feet.

1944
01:12:35,555 --> 01:12:36,584
- Straighten your legs.
- Okay.

1945
01:12:36,585 --> 01:12:38,524
- Stretching.
- Put your feet inside.

1946
01:12:38,525 --> 01:12:40,424
- My goodness.
- Are you good? Okay.

1947
01:12:40,425 --> 01:12:41,425
"Are you good?"

1948
01:12:41,695 --> 01:12:43,794
- Sir. When do I put my feet in?
- Yes.

1949
01:12:43,795 --> 01:12:45,664
Okay. Stretch your feet.

1950
01:12:45,665 --> 01:12:47,264
- "Stretch your feet." - Okay.

1951
01:12:47,265 --> 01:12:48,764
- Put your feet inside.
- Okay.

1952
01:12:48,765 --> 01:12:50,064
- "Stretch your feet." - Gosh. Okay.

1953
01:12:50,065 --> 01:12:51,874
Gosh. It's a bit hot.

1954
01:12:51,875 --> 01:12:53,174
- You have to endure it.
- Endure it?

1955
01:12:53,175 --> 01:12:55,005
Rub your hands.

1956
01:12:55,645 --> 01:12:56,645
Sir!

1957
01:12:56,775 --> 01:12:58,074
It's hot!

1958
01:12:58,075 --> 01:12:59,875
(It's hot, sir!)

1959
01:12:59,975 --> 01:13:01,044
- Okay.
- This is hilarious.

1960
01:13:01,045 --> 01:13:02,514
- Okay. Great.
- Okay. Great.

1961
01:13:02,515 --> 01:13:03,784
- Okay.
- Okay.

1962
01:13:03,785 --> 01:13:05,954
- Good. Okay.
- Good? Relax.

1963
01:13:05,955 --> 01:13:07,984
- Gosh, it tickles!
- Endure it.

1964
01:13:07,985 --> 01:13:09,985
Endure it.

1965
01:13:10,225 --> 01:13:11,924
He's telling me to endure through everything.

1966
01:13:11,925 --> 01:13:13,125
(The owner leaves right away after getting his work done.)

1967
01:13:13,325 --> 01:13:14,664
Inside your feet. Put your feet inside.

1968
01:13:14,665 --> 01:13:15,694
- It's really nice.
- Gosh.

1969
01:13:15,695 --> 01:13:17,895
Your feet are inside now. Okay.

1970
01:13:18,295 --> 01:13:20,234
- It's hot though.
- Endure it.

1971
01:13:20,235 --> 01:13:21,635
(Laughing)

1972
01:13:21,835 --> 01:13:23,135
"Endure it."

1973
01:13:24,035 --> 01:13:26,135
The owner here is a gambler.

1974
01:13:26,435 --> 01:13:27,445
Right.

1975
01:13:28,245 --> 01:13:29,504
It's warm though...

1976
01:13:29,505 --> 01:13:31,044
- as I've gotten used to it.
- It's so nice.

1977
01:13:31,045 --> 01:13:33,574
- I'll have the burdock root tea.
- Put your hands inside, Kyoung Pyo.

1978
01:13:33,575 --> 01:13:35,244
- Okay.
- Push them down.

1979
01:13:35,245 --> 01:13:37,655
Bring your chin up slightly, relax, and then try.

1980
01:13:37,985 --> 01:13:39,954
(What did you just say?)

1981
01:13:39,955 --> 01:13:41,625
Bring your chin up slightly, relax, and then try.

1982
01:13:41,985 --> 01:13:44,054
(His charming Konglish has appeared again.)

1983
01:13:44,055 --> 01:13:45,654
- "Inside your feet, okay?" - My gosh.

1984
01:13:45,655 --> 01:13:47,095
- Okay!
- Gosh.

1985
01:13:47,825 --> 01:13:49,595
Is that a cast?

1986
01:13:50,395 --> 01:13:52,934
I'm just doing as I'm told.

1987
01:13:52,935 --> 01:13:54,234
- This is...
- Push them down.

1988
01:13:54,235 --> 01:13:56,434
Bring your chin up slightly, relax, and then try.

1989
01:13:56,435 --> 01:13:57,875
(It's Jae Seok's turn.)

1990
01:13:57,975 --> 01:14:00,074
"Relax, and then try."

1991
01:14:00,075 --> 01:14:01,075
Okay.

1992
01:14:01,076 --> 01:14:03,204
- Okay.
- Okay. Good.

1993
01:14:03,205 --> 01:14:04,374
(His Konglish is fun to copy.)

1994
01:14:04,375 --> 01:14:05,375
It feels nice.

1995
01:14:05,376 --> 01:14:06,874
We should get our hearts prepared too.

1996
01:14:06,875 --> 01:14:09,814
It's your turn now. Okay. Put both hands inside.

1997
01:14:09,815 --> 01:14:12,254
Bring your chin up slightly, relax, and then try.

1998
01:14:12,255 --> 01:14:13,415
(The introvert is comfortably led to relax, and then try.)

1999
01:14:13,515 --> 01:14:14,824
"Try."

2000
01:14:14,825 --> 01:14:16,424
"Relax, and then try."

2001
01:14:16,425 --> 01:14:18,254
- "Relax, and then try." - Okay.

2002
01:14:18,255 --> 01:14:19,555
That's good!

2003
01:14:20,465 --> 01:14:21,694
It will feel good now,

2004
01:14:21,695 --> 01:14:24,695
but it will be a lot more effective if you move it around slightly.

2005
01:14:24,995 --> 01:14:26,094
- Relax your arms.
- Right.

2006
01:14:26,095 --> 01:14:28,165
It will feel great to do it like this.

2007
01:14:28,905 --> 01:14:30,474
Oh, try!

2008
01:14:30,475 --> 01:14:32,274
(Satisfied 200 percent)

2009
01:14:32,275 --> 01:14:33,845
Okay. Oh, good!

2010
01:14:34,645 --> 01:14:37,015
- Oh, good!
- Just like this.

2011
01:14:37,475 --> 01:14:38,944
It will be placed on the back?

2012
01:14:38,945 --> 01:14:41,085
- But we look a bit awkward.
- Like this?

2013
01:14:42,085 --> 01:14:43,085
Gosh.

2014
01:14:43,415 --> 01:14:44,515
This is amazing.

2015
01:14:45,185 --> 01:14:46,254
Oh, good!

2016
01:14:46,255 --> 01:14:47,684
(It may look a bit awkward, but it is very effective.)

2017
01:14:47,685 --> 01:14:48,685
Oh, good!

2018
01:14:48,925 --> 01:14:50,455
My shoulder blade feels good.

2019
01:14:50,895 --> 01:14:51,995
Right.

2020
01:14:52,655 --> 01:14:54,424
- Gosh, it feels nice.
- Right.

2021
01:14:54,425 --> 01:14:55,564
You can decide.

2022
01:14:55,565 --> 01:14:57,495
- It feels nice.
- Right.

2023
01:14:58,095 --> 01:15:00,264
There are six different drinks you can choose from.

2024
01:15:00,265 --> 01:15:02,904
Americano, mint tea, peach iced tea, and lemon iced tea.

2025
01:15:02,905 --> 01:15:05,304
They are all available cold or hot.

2026
01:15:05,305 --> 01:15:06,704
- Gosh, it feels good.
- Right.

2027
01:15:06,705 --> 01:15:09,104
- Please keep that in mind.
- Gosh, it feels good!

2028
01:15:09,105 --> 01:15:10,374
(Drinks sound good, but the massage feels too good.)

2029
01:15:10,375 --> 01:15:12,015
- Please keep that in mind.
- Gosh, it feels good!

2030
01:15:13,315 --> 01:15:14,315
Calm down.

2031
01:15:14,316 --> 01:15:15,884
(Calm down.)

2032
01:15:15,885 --> 01:15:17,814
You will smell the mint from the mint tea.

2033
01:15:17,815 --> 01:15:19,884
- I'll have the mint tea.
- Iced mint tea.

2034
01:15:19,885 --> 01:15:21,154
- Mint!
- Iced.

2035
01:15:21,155 --> 01:15:23,084
- Hot burdock root tea for me.
- Hot burdock root tea.

2036
01:15:23,085 --> 01:15:25,024
- I'll have the hot mint tea.
- Hot mint tea.

2037
01:15:25,025 --> 01:15:27,425
- Iced burdock root tea.
- I'm not smart enough. Hold on.

2038
01:15:28,395 --> 01:15:30,264
(The laughter creator knows no rest.)

2039
01:15:30,265 --> 01:15:31,734
He's so funny.

2040
01:15:31,735 --> 01:15:35,135
Gosh, sir! Give it a try with your memory!

2041
01:15:36,235 --> 01:15:37,505
This is so funny!

2042
01:15:39,505 --> 01:15:41,174
- "Try!" - He's eccentric.

2043
01:15:41,175 --> 01:15:42,304
"Try!"

2044
01:15:42,305 --> 01:15:43,504
- "Try!" - "Try!"

2045
01:15:43,505 --> 01:15:46,315
- "Oh, and then try!" - "And then try."

2046
01:15:46,545 --> 01:15:49,045
- His comments are so graceful.
- Right.

2047
01:15:49,285 --> 01:15:51,885
Getting this massage is funny,

2048
01:15:52,085 --> 01:15:53,984
but it's even funnier that there are people...

2049
01:15:53,985 --> 01:15:55,085
watching us get a massage.

2050
01:15:55,325 --> 01:15:57,454
They are watching us from down there.

2051
01:15:57,455 --> 01:15:58,455
Right.

2052
01:15:58,725 --> 01:15:59,824
They are watching us live.

2053
01:15:59,825 --> 01:16:01,294
They are watching us get a massage live.

2054
01:16:01,295 --> 01:16:02,594
My goodness.

2055
01:16:02,595 --> 01:16:04,194
They're having the salted butter roll ice cream.

2056
01:16:04,195 --> 01:16:05,934
- That looks good.
- Right.

2057
01:16:05,935 --> 01:16:07,304
They are watching us.

2058
01:16:07,305 --> 01:16:08,535
(Both sides are able to watch each other.)

2059
01:16:08,965 --> 01:16:10,705
This feels so nice.

2060
01:16:11,275 --> 01:16:12,474
It's nice, isn't it, REI?

2061
01:16:12,475 --> 01:16:14,505
It's so nice that I can't speak.

2062
01:16:14,575 --> 01:16:16,705
(Finding her to be cute)

2063
01:16:17,045 --> 01:16:18,074
Try to speak.

2064
01:16:18,075 --> 01:16:19,644
- Try to make a comment.
- Try to make a comment.

2065
01:16:19,645 --> 01:16:20,815
Try to make a comment.

2066
01:16:21,515 --> 01:16:23,744
I think Tae Hyun is enjoying this moment the most.

2067
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:25,254
This is the best moment for you, Tae Hyun.

2068
01:16:25,255 --> 01:16:26,615
This place is real!

2069
01:16:27,625 --> 01:16:29,385
(He must be greatly satisfied.)

2070
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:31,254
I feel great right now.

2071
01:16:31,255 --> 01:16:33,325
- I feel great right now too.
- Right.

2072
01:16:34,395 --> 01:16:36,695
This is the happiest moment during Sixth Sense.

2073
01:16:38,095 --> 01:16:40,464
The view of the pine trees here is really nice.

2074
01:16:40,465 --> 01:16:42,864
- Right.
- It feels comforting.

2075
01:16:42,865 --> 01:16:43,904
Time would fly by when spending time here...

2076
01:16:43,905 --> 01:16:45,735
- during the weekend.
- Right.

2077
01:16:46,075 --> 01:16:47,844
Tae Hyun, with the blanket over you,

2078
01:16:47,845 --> 01:16:49,104
you look like a retired chairman.

2079
01:16:49,105 --> 01:16:50,845
(The presence of a chairman)

2080
01:16:50,945 --> 01:16:52,574
- Try retirement.
- A retired chairman.

2081
01:16:52,575 --> 01:16:54,585
- Try retirement.
- Try retirement.

2082
01:16:54,915 --> 01:16:57,384
It moves differently according to the shape.

2083
01:16:57,385 --> 01:16:58,685
- Right.
- Right.

2084
01:16:59,155 --> 01:17:00,655
Kyoung Pyo is knocked out.

2085
01:17:01,655 --> 01:17:02,785
Kyoung Pyo is sleeping again.

2086
01:17:03,925 --> 01:17:05,555
Kyoung Pyo is sleeping.

2087
01:17:06,325 --> 01:17:07,964
It's a deep sleep.

2088
01:17:07,965 --> 01:17:09,525
Kyoung Pyo is sleeping.

2089
01:17:09,765 --> 01:17:11,395
Eating and sleeping.

2090
01:17:11,865 --> 01:17:13,195
It's a blood sugar spike.

2091
01:17:13,965 --> 01:17:15,404
"Live life like Kyoung Pyo."

2092
01:17:15,405 --> 01:17:17,035
"Live life like Ko Kyoung Pyo."

2093
01:17:17,305 --> 01:17:18,405
Totally.

2094
01:17:19,205 --> 01:17:20,544
(He gets right at that moment.)

2095
01:17:20,545 --> 01:17:22,075
He's awake now.

2096
01:17:22,345 --> 01:17:23,504
Gosh.

2097
01:17:23,505 --> 01:17:24,774
- You really fell asleep, right?
- Yes.

2098
01:17:24,775 --> 01:17:26,845
(- You really fell asleep, right? - Yes.)

2099
01:17:27,945 --> 01:17:28,945
Are you all still awake?

2100
01:17:28,946 --> 01:17:30,484
(Are you all still awake?)

2101
01:17:30,485 --> 01:17:31,954
Get some sleep, Kyoung Pyo.

2102
01:17:31,955 --> 01:17:34,054
- I feel so happy.
- Right.

2103
01:17:34,055 --> 01:17:35,055
(Kyoung Pyo is the happiest man on earth again today.)

2104
01:17:35,885 --> 01:17:37,425
Gosh, that felt great.

2105
01:17:38,225 --> 01:17:39,894
That was so nice.

2106
01:17:39,895 --> 01:17:40,895
(After enjoying the massage...)

2107
01:17:41,125 --> 01:17:42,464
We've had a great time.

2108
01:17:42,465 --> 01:17:44,834
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2109
01:17:44,835 --> 01:17:46,035
"Try."

2110
01:17:46,435 --> 01:17:48,264
(They move to the fourth hot place.)

2111
01:17:48,265 --> 01:17:50,105
(The 5-Million-Dollar Feast)

2112
01:17:50,805 --> 01:17:52,675
- It's the 5-Million-Dollar Feast?
- It's the 5-Million-Dollar Feast?

2113
01:17:52,975 --> 01:17:54,375
It's the 5-Million-Dollar Feast??

2114
01:17:54,575 --> 01:17:55,575
Do you see something?

2115
01:17:55,905 --> 01:17:57,474
Hello.

2116
01:17:57,475 --> 01:17:58,714
You look handsome, Jae Seok!

2117
01:17:58,715 --> 01:18:00,515
- You look stunning!
- Thank you.

2118
01:18:01,245 --> 01:18:02,585
It's a panda.

2119
01:18:03,515 --> 01:18:04,515
What is this place?

2120
01:18:05,755 --> 01:18:07,384
(Inside the alley, )

2121
01:18:07,385 --> 01:18:09,855
(there's a suspicious building.)

2122
01:18:10,825 --> 01:18:12,425
The panda is so cute.

2123
01:18:12,955 --> 01:18:13,964
Here.

2124
01:18:13,965 --> 01:18:15,365
What on earth is this?

2125
01:18:16,725 --> 01:18:18,664
Oh, my gosh. That's meat.

2126
01:18:18,665 --> 01:18:20,635
- Isn't that pork belly?
- Right.

2127
01:18:21,705 --> 01:18:23,464
(Guinness of Jeonju)

2128
01:18:23,465 --> 01:18:25,205
(What is the 5-Million-Dollar Feast?)

2129
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:27,305
- It's this place?
- What is this place?

2130
01:18:28,375 --> 01:18:29,505
- What?
- What?

2131
01:18:30,575 --> 01:18:33,875
(What?)

2132
01:18:34,185 --> 01:18:36,285
(Generally, when a feast is thought of, )

2133
01:18:36,615 --> 01:18:41,555
(wine and fancy dishes are the first things to come to mind.)

2134
01:18:41,755 --> 01:18:46,424
(But it's worth 5 million dollars?)

2135
01:18:46,425 --> 01:18:49,095
(The 5-Million-Dollar Feast will get revealed now.)

2136
01:18:49,365 --> 01:18:51,795
(When you pass down the well-decorated hallway, )

2137
01:18:52,565 --> 01:18:54,705
(the 5-Million-Dollar Feast unfolds before your eyes.)

2138
01:18:55,005 --> 01:18:58,935
(The trail of dishes is endless.)

2139
01:18:59,535 --> 01:19:02,174
(There are...)

2140
01:19:02,175 --> 01:19:04,715
(hundreds of dishes.)

2141
01:19:04,915 --> 01:19:08,015
(Various art pieces are on the wall.)

2142
01:19:08,385 --> 01:19:12,255
(What kind of secret is there behind the 5-Million-Dollar Feast?)

2143
01:19:12,555 --> 01:19:13,855
Check this out, Kyoung Pyo.

2144
01:19:14,955 --> 01:19:16,185
These are mangoes.

2145
01:19:16,455 --> 01:19:17,994
(They look delicious.)

2146
01:19:17,995 --> 01:19:19,224
They are actual mangoes.

2147
01:19:19,225 --> 01:19:20,824
(Soft flesh and high in sweetness)

2148
01:19:20,825 --> 01:19:22,365
How were they brought in?

2149
01:19:22,495 --> 01:19:23,965
No way!

2150
01:19:24,735 --> 01:19:26,295
What do we do with this? It's the snowflake bingsu.

2151
01:19:27,835 --> 01:19:30,674
(Looking like a pile of snow)

2152
01:19:30,675 --> 01:19:31,934
That looks amazing.

2153
01:19:31,935 --> 01:19:33,975
(The snowflake bingsu that will cool down the heat in the summer)

2154
01:19:34,175 --> 01:19:36,044
This can't be true.

2155
01:19:36,045 --> 01:19:38,545
(Noticing that something is off)

2156
01:19:40,315 --> 01:19:42,514
What are all of these? These are all stones?

2157
01:19:42,515 --> 01:19:43,944
- What?
- It says they are stones.

2158
01:19:43,945 --> 01:19:45,355
These are all stones?

2159
01:19:47,255 --> 01:19:48,655
(What?)

2160
01:19:48,855 --> 01:19:50,224
That doesn't make sense.

2161
01:19:50,225 --> 01:19:51,755
- That doesn't make sense.
- Gosh.

2162
01:19:51,995 --> 01:19:53,325
Look at this.

2163
01:19:54,195 --> 01:19:55,994
It says they weren't processed at all.

2164
01:19:55,995 --> 01:19:57,595
They are natural stones.

2165
01:19:57,995 --> 01:20:00,034
It's even more fascinating that they weren't processed.

2166
01:20:00,035 --> 01:20:01,465
How are these stones?

2167
01:20:02,935 --> 01:20:09,144
(They look like food at a glance, but they are all stones.)

2168
01:20:09,145 --> 01:20:11,144
(Natural stone grapes, real grapes)

2169

01:20:19,255 --> 01:20:20,284
(The 5-Million-Dollar Feast...)

2174
01:20:20,285 --> 01:20:21,285
(is a gallery of stones that look like food.)

2175
01:20:21,985 --> 01:20:24,894
(Known as Jeonju's hot place with stones that look like food)

2176
01:20:24,895 --> 01:20:26,955
So stones are found...

2177
01:20:27,395 --> 01:20:29,625
and plated like food.

2178
01:20:29,865 --> 01:20:31,764
- How is that a stone?
- Right.

2179
01:20:31,765 --> 01:20:32,964
That's a stone too?

2180
01:20:32,965 --> 01:20:34,034
- Yes.
- They're all stones.

2181
01:20:34,035 --> 01:20:35,304
This doesn't make sense.

2182
01:20:35,305 --> 01:20:37,064
This is so fascinating.

2183
01:20:37,065 --> 01:20:38,575
Gosh! Here!

2184
01:20:38,705 --> 01:20:40,334
(Amazed)

2185
01:20:40,335 --> 01:20:42,145
It's amazing here!

2186
01:20:42,345 --> 01:20:44,244
It looks like ham.

2187
01:20:44,245 --> 01:20:45,615
- This is a stone too!
- It looks like pork belly.

2188
01:20:45,815 --> 01:20:48,015
- Which one?
- This is a stone too!

2189
01:20:48,145 --> 01:20:49,545
- What?
- No way!

2190
01:20:50,415 --> 01:20:51,854
- No way!
- No way!

2191
01:20:51,855 --> 01:20:53,155
That looks exactly like meat.

2192
01:20:54,925 --> 01:20:56,685
How is that possible?

2193
01:20:57,185 --> 01:20:58,494
Isn't that pork belly?

2194
01:20:58,495 --> 01:20:59,855
Right. It's pork belly.

2195
01:21:00,865 --> 01:21:02,864
Oh, my gosh. That looks just like meat.

2196
01:21:02,865 --> 01:21:04,494
That's a stone?

2197
01:21:04,495 --> 01:21:05,535
(Clear fat lines)

2198
01:21:05,795 --> 01:21:09,764
(These are all stones that were formed naturally?)

2199
01:21:09,765 --> 01:21:11,775
- Look at this! Look at the meat!
- Look at this!

2200
01:21:12,275 --> 01:21:14,844
How is that a stone?

2201
01:21:14,845 --> 01:21:15,875
What is that?

2202
01:21:16,405 --> 01:21:17,674
What's going on?

2203
01:21:17,675 --> 01:21:19,275
- No way!
- There are things like ribs.

2204
01:21:19,475 --> 01:21:20,784
(Gulping)

2205
01:21:20,785 --> 01:21:22,684
These are ribs.

2206
01:21:22,685 --> 01:21:23,984
How is this possible?

2207
01:21:23,985 --> 01:21:25,354
(Detailed bones)

2208
01:21:25,355 --> 01:21:27,584
It's even more fascinating that they weren't processed.

2209
01:21:27,585 --> 01:21:29,054
How are these stones?

2210
01:21:29,055 --> 01:21:31,755
- Does this even make sense?
- These are ribs!

2211
01:21:32,195 --> 01:21:34,225
- How is that a stone?
- Look at that!

2212
01:21:34,825 --> 01:21:37,434
- No way!
- These look just like ribs.

2213
01:21:37,435 --> 01:21:38,435
(Even the fat can be seen.)

2214
01:21:38,495 --> 01:21:39,495
No way!

2215
01:21:39,496 --> 01:21:41,804
Even those details were formed naturally?

2216
01:21:41,805 --> 01:21:43,064
(Sniffing)

2217
01:21:43,065 --> 01:21:44,535
It smells like a stone.

2218
01:21:44,975 --> 01:21:46,234
(Laughing)

2219
01:21:46,235 --> 01:21:47,374
Were you wondering if it would smell like pork belly?

2220
01:21:47,375 --> 01:21:49,374
- The smell?
- Yes. It smells like a stone.

2221
01:21:49,375 --> 01:21:52,475
The ones that look like meat were just amazing.

2222
01:21:53,075 --> 01:21:55,115
Where are these stones found?

2223
01:21:55,645 --> 01:21:58,215
It's creeping me out that all of these are stones.

2224
01:21:58,885 --> 01:22:00,685
(What are these?)

2225
01:22:00,885 --> 01:22:03,355
What? These are stones too?

2226
01:22:04,325 --> 01:22:05,425
What?

2227
01:22:06,355 --> 01:22:07,355
Awesome!

2228
01:22:07,695 --> 01:22:09,824
I think the stones were plated really well.

2229
01:22:09,825 --> 01:22:11,495
Right. Everything was plated nicely.

2230
01:22:12,035 --> 01:22:14,065
They all look delicious.

2231
01:22:14,735 --> 01:22:15,735
Oh, my gosh.

2232
01:22:16,335 --> 01:22:18,175
They were put together so realistically.

2233
01:22:18,575 --> 01:22:20,104
- How is this possible?
- It's made of stalagmite.

2234
01:22:20,105 --> 01:22:21,975
How were these found?

2235
01:22:22,775 --> 01:22:24,274
There's even a cake.

2236
01:22:24,275 --> 01:22:26,074
(There's even a cake.)

2237
01:22:26,075 --> 01:22:28,385
Everything was set up like this so unbelievably?

2238
01:22:29,615 --> 01:22:32,055
(Detective Cha is investigating on his own.)

2239
01:22:32,315 --> 01:22:34,824
(Everything feels suspicious to Tae Hyun.)

2240
01:22:34,825 --> 01:22:36,924
This could look like this.

2241
01:22:36,925 --> 01:22:38,955
(Sashimi stone)

2242
01:22:39,325 --> 01:22:41,865
(They were touched after getting permission.)

2243
01:22:42,025 --> 01:22:43,724
Isn't this just too much?

2244
01:22:43,725 --> 01:22:44,735
Right?

2245
01:22:45,395 --> 01:22:49,035
(The answer lies in the stone.)

2246
01:22:49,235 --> 01:22:50,665
(Unable to understand)

2247
01:22:50,735 --> 01:22:52,805
- Jae Seok, this is what I think.
- What is it?

2248
01:22:53,005 --> 01:22:55,704
The stones that look like beef or pork.

2249
01:22:55,705 --> 01:22:57,944
- Right.
- They look the fakest.

2250
01:22:57,945 --> 01:22:58,945
- Right.
- They do seem fake.

2251
01:22:58,946 --> 01:23:01,715
But if see the other ones, they feel real.

2252
01:23:01,745 --> 01:23:03,714
So most of them are real,

2253
01:23:03,715 --> 01:23:04,854
but just that section might be fake.

2254
01:23:04,855 --> 01:23:06,615
Couldn't the production crew have just added in that section?

2255
01:23:06,715 --> 01:23:07,754
That's what it seems like.

2256
01:23:07,755 --> 01:23:09,485
It doesn't make sense.

2257
01:23:10,185 --> 01:23:11,725
Does this even make sense?

2258
01:23:12,155 --> 01:23:14,894
What connection do these stones have with five million dollars?

2259
01:23:14,895 --> 01:23:15,995
(What connection do these stones have with 5 million dollars?)

2260
01:23:16,665 --> 01:23:18,064
- Hello.
- The owners are coming in.

2261
01:23:18,065 --> 01:23:19,934
- Hello.
- Hello.

2262
01:23:19,935 --> 01:23:21,004
- It's great to see you.
- Hello.

2263
01:23:21,005 --> 01:23:22,264
- It's great to see you.
- Hello.

2264
01:23:22,265 --> 01:23:24,274
- Hello.
- Hello. Please come this way.

2265
01:23:24,275 --> 01:23:25,735
My gosh. Look at this.

2266
01:23:26,735 --> 01:23:28,874
(Tae Hyun shows them the rib meat all of a sudden.)

2267
01:23:28,875 --> 01:23:30,775
Does it make sense that this wasn't processed?

2268
01:23:32,075 --> 01:23:34,514
Let's ask them to introduce themselves first.

2269
01:23:34,515 --> 01:23:36,415
(He's getting ahead of himself.)

2270
01:23:36,515 --> 01:23:38,814
Right. We all just found it to be absurd.

2271
01:23:38,815 --> 01:23:39,914
We all got flustered.

2272
01:23:39,915 --> 01:23:41,985
- Please introduce yourselves.
- I'm a family physician...

2273
01:23:42,625 --> 01:23:44,825
of a small clinic in town.

2274
01:23:44,925 --> 01:23:45,954
You're a doctor?

2275
01:23:45,955 --> 01:23:47,155
You're a doctor?

2276
01:23:47,965 --> 01:23:50,224
After being done with being a medical specialist,

2277
01:23:50,225 --> 01:23:51,865
I started collecting stones.

2278
01:23:52,065 --> 01:23:54,435
That was around 35 years ago.

2279
01:23:54,465 --> 01:23:56,634
I'm the well-known one born in 1958, the Year of the Dog.

2280
01:23:56,635 --> 01:23:57,674
(Baby boom generation)

2281
01:23:57,675 --> 01:24:00,374
My name is Kwak Byeong Chan.

2282
01:24:00,375 --> 01:24:03,875
I'm a family physician of a small clinic in town.

2283
01:24:04,575 --> 01:24:07,585
(Why did a doctor collect stones?)

2284
01:24:07,745 --> 01:24:09,315
I moved to Jeonju after opening up the clinic.

2285
01:24:09,615 --> 01:24:12,084
I followed people around Korea...

2286
01:24:12,085 --> 01:24:13,355
including places like the Namhan River.

2287
01:24:13,885 --> 01:24:15,455
Amongst the stones,

2288
01:24:15,855 --> 01:24:17,794
I could spot the ones...

2289
01:24:17,795 --> 01:24:19,195
that looked like food.

2290
01:24:19,525 --> 01:24:21,624
That was when I started to collect...

2291
01:24:21,625 --> 01:24:24,795
stones that looked like food for 35 years.

2292
01:24:24,995 --> 01:24:27,935
I spent up to five million dollars on purchasing the stones.

2293
01:24:29,005 --> 01:24:30,065
It should be around that much.

2294
01:24:30,135 --> 01:24:32,035
(His wife seemed to have heard about this just now.)

2295
01:24:32,205 --> 01:24:35,245
I collected different stones from many different countries.

2296
01:24:35,575 --> 01:24:37,875
I went to many places that were 1,000km away.

2297
01:24:38,145 --> 01:24:40,445
I even faced death.

2298
01:24:40,645 --> 01:24:42,845
I went through a lot of dangerous moments.

2299
01:24:43,185 --> 01:24:45,914
Others might think of these as just stones,

2300
01:24:45,915 --> 01:24:47,885
but to me, they are like my children.

2301
01:24:48,155 --> 01:24:51,325
There are a lot of stones here, and you'll find everything possible.

2302
01:24:51,555 --> 01:24:54,794
That one was separated while looking like a cake.

2303
01:24:54,795 --> 01:24:56,525
It was expensive.

2304
01:24:57,125 --> 01:24:58,595
These stones weren't cheap.

2305
01:24:58,765 --> 01:25:00,064
I spent a lot of money to collect them.

2306
01:25:00,065 --> 01:25:01,065
(He gave it his all to bring in the expensive food stones.)

2307
01:25:01,066 --> 01:25:02,535
I felt motivated...

2308
01:25:02,605 --> 01:25:03,805
and wanted to show everyone my collection.

2309
01:25:04,475 --> 01:25:07,674
- Sixth Sense!
- Is this place real?

2310
01:25:07,675 --> 01:25:09,845
(Is the 5-Million-Dollar Feast a real place?)

2311
01:25:10,505 --> 01:25:11,915
Where did you get this?

2312
01:25:12,115 --> 01:25:13,115
(A sudden question)

2313
01:25:13,116 --> 01:25:14,514
That one is from China.

2314
01:25:14,515 --> 01:25:16,215
These ones were originally rough on the surfaces,

2315
01:25:16,285 --> 01:25:19,214
so they were neatly polished.

2316
01:25:19,215 --> 01:25:21,254
There were many of these sort of pieces?

2317
01:25:21,255 --> 01:25:24,024
- Yes. They were...
- How do they look like meat?

2318
01:25:24,025 --> 01:25:26,255
Well, it's hard to even make these.

2319
01:25:27,455 --> 01:25:29,924
- They look like this...
- He sounds wronged.

2320
01:25:29,925 --> 01:25:31,064
Because they were formed naturally.

2321
01:25:31,065 --> 01:25:33,465
- He sounds wronged.
- Right.

2322
01:25:33,635 --> 01:25:35,705
They can't be forced to be made like this.

2323
01:25:35,735 --> 01:25:37,904
Did you stop your husband from collecting these stones?

2324
01:25:37,905 --> 01:25:40,235
- "Why collect stones?" - Well, I'll explain.

2325
01:25:40,575 --> 01:25:44,005
I didn't allow him to bring home any of these stones.

2326
01:25:44,345 --> 01:25:46,615
I just hated seeing them. But after a while,

2327
01:25:46,745 --> 01:25:50,845
he got his own warehouse and collected this many stones.

2328
01:25:51,115 --> 01:25:53,214
- He did it in secret.
- Right.

2329
01:25:53,215 --> 01:25:54,215
(Frustrated)

2330
01:25:54,216 --> 01:25:56,954
He got his own warehouse as he wasn't allowed to bring them home.

2331
01:25:56,955 --> 01:25:58,254
These weren't things that could be...

2332
01:25:58,255 --> 01:25:59,525
- kept in an apartment.
- Right.

2333
01:25:59,555 --> 01:26:02,694
I would've stopped him had I known he was going to collect this many.

2334
01:26:02,695 --> 01:26:04,024
- Well...
- I felt really frustrated.

2335
01:26:04,025 --> 01:26:05,464
- Right.
- I couldn't handle the stones.

2336
01:26:05,465 --> 01:26:06,834
The stones had to be displayed.

2337
01:26:06,835 --> 01:26:07,835
(He couldn't handle 35 years worth of his stone collection.)

2338
01:26:07,836 --> 01:26:09,535
That was why I confessed to her.

2339
01:26:09,805 --> 01:26:11,534
She helped me display them nicely like this.

2340
01:26:11,535 --> 01:26:12,535
I see.

2341
01:26:12,536 --> 01:26:14,945
It had to be clear what the stones looked like.

2342
01:26:15,375 --> 01:26:17,544
I did a lot of work...

2343
01:26:17,545 --> 01:26:18,845
to make the stones look like food.

2344
01:26:18,945 --> 01:26:21,314
To decorate this place,

2345
01:26:21,315 --> 01:26:24,384
I used the art pieces that I had.

2346
01:26:24,385 --> 01:26:27,015
(She used many of the art pieces that she had.)

2347
01:26:27,315 --> 01:26:30,354
(The stone gallery was put together by the wife's great abilities.)

2348
01:26:30,355 --> 01:26:33,854
So the husband started the mess.

2349
01:26:33,855 --> 01:26:35,864
- The wife cleared things up.
- Right.

2350
01:26:35,865 --> 01:26:38,265
These two look like an actual couple.

2351
01:26:38,465 --> 01:26:40,765
- That is what's hilarious.
- They seem like an actual couple.

2352
01:26:40,835 --> 01:26:43,804
- They seem like an actual couple.
- Right. That seems to be real.

2353
01:26:43,805 --> 01:26:46,104
It's hard to ask, but how much are these stones worth?

2354
01:26:46,105 --> 01:26:47,634
These stones...

2355
01:26:47,635 --> 01:26:49,545
are probably worth around five million dollars.

2356
01:26:49,675 --> 01:26:50,774
(Up to 5 million dollars?)

2357
01:26:50,775 --> 01:26:52,514
There are ones that cannot be bought with money.

2358
01:26:52,515 --> 01:26:54,615
There aren't any more of these that were naturally formed.

2359
01:26:55,185 --> 01:26:57,715
- None can be found now.
- Which stones are the rare ones?

2360
01:26:58,015 --> 01:27:00,754
- That is the stalactite.
- That one?

2361
01:27:00,755 --> 01:27:02,024
Those are only found in caves.

2362
01:27:02,025 --> 01:27:03,954
- Right. They are really old.
- The cake?

2363
01:27:03,955 --> 01:27:05,025
- Right.
- Right.

2364
01:27:05,125 --> 01:27:07,295
It's 360 million years old.

2365
01:27:07,895 --> 01:27:09,564
- Awesome.
- It was separated...

2366
01:27:09,565 --> 01:27:11,194
and set up like that.

2367
01:27:11,195 --> 01:27:12,964
(It costs 250,000 dollars!)

2368
01:27:12,965 --> 01:27:13,965
It's over 200,000 dollars?

2369
01:27:14,705 --> 01:27:16,005
It's a precious one.

2370
01:27:16,165 --> 01:27:18,704
(The other natural stones are worth...)

2371
01:27:18,705 --> 01:27:21,245
(over several hundred thousands of dollars.)

2372
01:27:22,545 --> 01:27:24,345
Even with those fruit stones,

2373
01:27:24,545 --> 01:27:26,574
each piece is a piece of jewelry.

2374
01:27:26,575 --> 01:27:28,344
It's hard to say how much they are all worth.

2375
01:27:28,345 --> 01:27:29,715
- The fruit stones.
- The fruit stones.

2376
01:27:29,745 --> 01:27:32,414
How are they round just like actual grapes?

2377
01:27:32,415 --> 01:27:34,014
They were formed to be that way...

2378
01:27:34,015 --> 01:27:35,625
after being in caves or deserts for a long time.

2379
01:27:36,125 --> 01:27:37,354
- They were rolled around.
- Right.

2380
01:27:37,355 --> 01:27:39,624
They were moved here and there with the wind.

2381
01:27:39,625 --> 01:27:40,954
- Inside the sand.
- They were carved like that.

2382
01:27:40,955 --> 01:27:45,294
That's why there are various colors and shapes.

2383
01:27:45,295 --> 01:27:48,234
Out of those stones, we gathered purple ones...

2384
01:27:48,235 --> 01:27:50,165
to look like grapes.

2385
01:27:50,265 --> 01:27:51,734
These were plated like potato rice cakes...

2386
01:27:51,735 --> 01:27:53,204
as they looked just like them.

2387
01:27:53,205 --> 01:27:56,844
You said you hated seeing them, but now you're very enthusiastic.

2388
01:27:56,845 --> 01:27:58,145
(Sharp)

2389
01:27:58,215 --> 01:27:59,914
(Laughing)

2390
01:27:59,915 --> 01:28:02,114
- She fell for the stones.
- Now...

2391
01:28:02,115 --> 01:28:03,945
The gallery is open now.

2392
01:28:04,015 --> 01:28:06,185
- There's an entrance fee now.
- Right.

2393
01:28:06,955 --> 01:28:08,754
- Thank you so much.
- No problem.

2394
01:28:08,755 --> 01:28:10,085
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2395
01:28:10,725 --> 01:28:13,095
It's crazy today.

2396
01:28:13,595 --> 01:28:14,695
What do we do?

2397
01:28:15,095 --> 01:28:17,164
If we are to find one real place, I think it's this one.

2398
01:28:17,165 --> 01:28:18,434
There's nothing that could be...

2399
01:28:18,435 --> 01:28:19,694
- considered fake here.
- Right.

2400
01:28:19,695 --> 01:28:20,834
There's nothing that could be...

2401
01:28:20,835 --> 01:28:21,964
- considered fake here.
- Nothing.

2402
01:28:21,965 --> 01:28:22,965
- Really?
- Yes.

2403
01:28:22,966 --> 01:28:24,804
- They all seem fake to me.
- Same here.

2404
01:28:24,805 --> 01:28:26,804
Can't they all be fake?

2405
01:28:26,805 --> 01:28:28,774
- Gosh, this place is so hard.
- Let me explain.

2406
01:28:28,775 --> 01:28:30,105
It makes sense...

2407
01:28:30,375 --> 01:28:32,544
that the wife displayed...

2408
01:28:32,545 --> 01:28:33,974
the stones that the husband collected for 35 years.

2409
01:28:33,975 --> 01:28:35,484
Take this stone and place it somewhere else like this.

2410
01:28:35,485 --> 01:28:36,744
- No one would recognize it.
- Right.

2411
01:28:36,745 --> 01:28:37,915
"Hangwa."

2412
01:28:38,115 --> 01:28:40,555
The stones look more valuable after being displayed like this.

2413
01:28:40,815 --> 01:28:42,454
I believe this surely makes sense.

2414
01:28:42,455 --> 01:28:44,055
- Right.
- Right.

2415
01:28:44,655 --> 01:28:46,525
You're actually falling for this?

2416
01:28:47,255 --> 01:28:48,964
(Even after seeing this?)

2417
01:28:48,965 --> 01:28:51,165
The fact that it was shaped like this...

2418
01:28:51,565 --> 01:28:53,935
This part is the bone, right?

2419
01:28:54,195 --> 01:28:56,664
- Isn't this just ridiculous?
- Right.

2420
01:28:56,665 --> 01:28:59,374
The meat stones look like they were shaped to be like that.

2421
01:28:59,375 --> 01:29:01,244
That is what I'm saying!

2422
01:29:01,245 --> 01:29:03,274
- Does this even make sense?
- But he said they were natural.

2423
01:29:03,275 --> 01:29:04,674
- Don't get angry!
- Right?

2424
01:29:04,675 --> 01:29:06,074
(Don't get angry, Dad!)

2425
01:29:06,075 --> 01:29:07,815
(Right?)

2426
01:29:08,045 --> 01:29:10,045
(Good job, REI.)

2427
01:29:10,245 --> 01:29:11,314
She's right.

2428
01:29:11,315 --> 01:29:12,615
(Self-reflecting)

2429
01:29:12,685 --> 01:29:15,825
- Well, these ones look real.
- Right.

2430
01:29:16,525 --> 01:29:17,724
But the meat stones...

2431
01:29:17,725 --> 01:29:19,525
You're not trying to take this home are you?

2432
01:29:19,655 --> 01:29:21,425
- He keeps holding onto it.
- This one.

2433
01:29:22,025 --> 01:29:24,995
I'm wondering how there are several pieces that look like this.

2434
01:29:25,095 --> 01:29:27,865
It's a large world we live in.

2435
01:29:28,005 --> 01:29:29,035
Could that be it?

2436
01:29:29,265 --> 01:29:30,904
- It could make sense.
- Could that be it?

2437
01:29:30,905 --> 01:29:32,004
Let's move on for now.

2438
01:29:32,005 --> 01:29:33,634
We'll have to vote for one place today.

2439
01:29:33,635 --> 01:29:35,775
Each place has a point that feels fake.

2440
01:29:35,805 --> 01:29:36,945
It's so hard.

2441
01:29:37,745 --> 01:29:39,945
(The time to decide has finally come.)

2442
01:29:40,662 --> 01:29:42,401
But it's so hard today.

2443
01:29:42,402 --> 01:29:43,532
- It's hard.
- Right.

2444
01:29:44,072 --> 01:29:45,871
We should mark out the ones that feel fake.

2445
01:29:45,872 --> 01:29:47,002
- We should do that.
- Right.

2446
01:29:47,772 --> 01:29:49,742
We just met the wife.

2447
01:29:49,912 --> 01:29:52,881
Her husband spent five million dollars on the stones.

2448
01:29:52,882 --> 01:29:54,541
Was it possible for her to look that way?

2449
01:29:54,542 --> 01:29:56,251
(Was it possible?)

2450
01:29:56,252 --> 01:29:58,682
She came out looking so calm like that?

2451
01:29:58,852 --> 01:30:02,422
(The 5-Million-Dollar Stone Feast)

2452
01:30:03,392 --> 01:30:05,452
(They are worth over 5 million dollars.)

2453
01:30:06,122 --> 01:30:08,161
(Her husband spent 5 million dollars, )

2454
01:30:08,162 --> 01:30:10,392
(but the wife looked calm. Is that why it's fake?)

2455
01:30:11,092 --> 01:30:13,562
Even after giving up on a lot after time has passed,

2456
01:30:14,202 --> 01:30:17,402
I think I would burn up with rage every time I see those stones.

2457
01:30:19,302 --> 01:30:21,501
- Gosh.
- Don't get angry.

2458
01:30:21,502 --> 01:30:22,512
Right.

2459
01:30:23,172 --> 01:30:24,471
We can certainly exclude the first place.

2460
01:30:24,472 --> 01:30:25,741
The first place should be excluded.

2461
01:30:25,742 --> 01:30:26,812
- We can do that.
- Right.

2462
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:29,512
(Pumpkin ssanghwatang...)

2463
01:30:30,282 --> 01:30:33,852
(sold at a 100-year-old house)

2464
01:30:33,922 --> 01:30:36,422
(This was for 10 people.)

2465
01:30:36,622 --> 01:30:38,752
(It's hard for 10 people to gather to come here.)

2466
01:30:39,162 --> 01:30:40,861
(Large pumpkin ssanghwatang for 10 people)

2467
01:30:40,862 --> 01:30:44,032
(It feels fake as it doesn't feel cost-effective.)

2468
01:30:44,192 --> 01:30:46,131
- The 1st place.
- Even the 2nd place.

2469
01:30:46,132 --> 01:30:47,432
- The chive jeon waffle.
- The chive jeon waffle.

2470
01:30:47,762 --> 01:30:49,832
The chive jeon waffle felt off.

2471
01:30:49,972 --> 01:30:52,271
It felt like it was made for the show.

2472
01:30:52,272 --> 01:30:53,272
(A new dish created for this week's show?)

2473
01:30:53,672 --> 01:30:55,872
(A building was raised with the bibimbap waffle)

2474
01:30:56,412 --> 01:30:59,642
(Chive jeon waffle, the new dish made after 10 years)

2475
01:31:00,382 --> 01:31:02,311
(It does taste good, )

2476
01:31:02,312 --> 01:31:04,212
(but the perilla leaf feels too strong.)

2477
01:31:05,852 --> 01:31:07,721
(It's fake because...)

2478
01:31:07,722 --> 01:31:09,951
(the perilla leaf's taste...)

2479
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:12,052
(was stronger than the chive?)

2480
01:31:12,322 --> 01:31:14,161
- It's the 3rd or 4th place.
- Right.

2481
01:31:14,162 --> 01:31:17,132
The food was great at the third place.

2482
01:31:17,932 --> 01:31:20,201
- But it felt too unreal.
- Right.

2483
01:31:20,202 --> 01:31:21,731
- It looked unreal.
- It looked unreal.

2484
01:31:21,732 --> 01:31:22,772
It strongly felt like...

2485
01:31:23,102 --> 01:31:25,201
it was made with a chef's recipe.

2486
01:31:25,202 --> 01:31:26,901
- Right.
- Right.

2487
01:31:26,902 --> 01:31:28,402
- We've been fooled a lot.
- Right.

2488
01:31:29,472 --> 01:31:32,912
(The kalguksu place that sold more than 30 million bowls)

2489
01:31:33,312 --> 01:31:35,241
(A new green dish that was released after 48 years?)

2490
01:31:35,242 --> 01:31:38,052
(The kalguksu was good enough.)

2491
01:31:38,412 --> 01:31:43,821
(The green soybean noodles were a bit too much.)

2492
01:31:43,822 --> 01:31:46,791
It felt like a dish that was made to look nice.

2493
01:31:46,792 --> 01:31:47,992
(It's fake as it looks unreal and made by a chef?)

2494
01:31:48,262 --> 01:31:49,262
What do you think, REI?

2495
01:31:49,962 --> 01:31:50,962
(Sighing)

2496
01:31:51,592 --> 01:31:53,332
Must I really decide?

2497
01:31:54,202 --> 01:31:56,531
- What?
- You still should decide.

2498
01:31:56,532 --> 01:31:58,001
- I know it's that hard.
- It won't end if I don't decide.

2499
01:31:58,002 --> 01:31:59,672
- That's how hard it is.
- Right.

2500
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:01,372
Would about you, Kyoung Pyo?

2501
01:32:01,472 --> 01:32:03,842
Me? All of the places felt fake to me.

2502
01:32:04,012 --> 01:32:06,012
If I have to choose a place that is real, it's the fourth place.

2503
01:32:06,212 --> 01:32:09,012
- The 4th place.
- It's the 4th place for me too.

2504
01:32:09,512 --> 01:32:10,582
It's the fourth place for me too.

2505
01:32:10,682 --> 01:32:12,722
Okay! We have three votes!

2506
01:32:13,452 --> 01:32:14,982
The fourth place is real?

2507
01:32:15,722 --> 01:32:16,752
- Are you serious?
- What?

2508
01:32:17,292 --> 01:32:19,062
People fell for that?

2509
01:32:19,392 --> 01:32:20,691
Which place do you think is real then?

2510
01:32:20,692 --> 01:32:22,021
It's definitely not the fourth place.

2511
01:32:22,022 --> 01:32:24,332
- Which place is real?
- I don't know which place is real,

2512
01:32:24,492 --> 01:32:25,762
but it's definitely not the fourth place.

2513
01:32:25,862 --> 01:32:28,701
The fourth place makes no sense.

2514
01:32:28,702 --> 01:32:30,401
- It doesn't make sense to me too.
- Do you think it makes sense?

2515
01:32:30,402 --> 01:32:31,501
It doesn't make sense to me too.

2516
01:32:31,502 --> 01:32:33,772
We decided to exclude the ones that definitely felt fake.

2517
01:32:33,872 --> 01:32:36,772
What are supposed to do if they think it's the fourth place?

2518
01:32:37,872 --> 01:32:40,681
We can't move together as a group of six like this.

2519
01:32:40,682 --> 01:32:42,712
- Please calm down.
- We all think differently.

2520
01:32:43,452 --> 01:32:45,612
(He got angry again.)

2521
01:32:45,882 --> 01:32:47,481
- There's nothing else we can do.
- Gosh.

2522
01:32:47,482 --> 01:32:48,751
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

2523
01:32:48,752 --> 01:32:50,122
It's so hard.

2524
01:32:50,892 --> 01:32:53,092
- Rock-paper-scissors again?
- We have no choice.

2525
01:32:53,422 --> 01:32:54,992
This is terrible!

2526
01:32:55,992 --> 01:32:58,061
(The person that wins will decide on the answer.)

2527
01:32:58,062 --> 01:32:59,101
- I must lose.
- All right.

2528
01:32:59,102 --> 01:33:00,362
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2529
01:33:00,732 --> 01:33:02,472
(Jae Seok, Tae Hyun, and Kyoung Pyo win!)

2530
01:33:02,532 --> 01:33:03,532
Rock-paper-scissors.

2531
01:33:03,533 --> 01:33:04,932
(Tae Hyun and Kyoung Pyo win in the next round!)

2532
01:33:05,132 --> 01:33:07,841
No! What's wrong with you?

2533
01:33:07,842 --> 01:33:08,972
Get to your senses. What do you think you're doing?

2534
01:33:10,412 --> 01:33:11,542
- "What's wrong with you?" - Why are you being like this?

2535
01:33:11,812 --> 01:33:12,941
Rock-paper-scissors.

2536
01:33:12,942 --> 01:33:14,642
(Win, lose)

2537
01:33:15,242 --> 01:33:16,311
(Kyoung Pyo becomes the one to make the final decision.)

2538
01:33:16,312 --> 01:33:17,381
- What a relief.
- He won.

2539
01:33:17,382 --> 01:33:19,622
- You decide, Kyoung Pyo.
- That's a relief.

2540
01:33:19,982 --> 01:33:21,052
You decide, Kyoung Pyo.

2541
01:33:21,522 --> 01:33:22,522
I think it's the second place.

2542
01:33:22,922 --> 01:33:25,152
You should've won then!

2543
01:33:25,862 --> 01:33:27,791
(Tae Hyun chose the 2nd place all of a sudden.)

2544
01:33:27,792 --> 01:33:29,761
(How will things turn out to be?)

2545
01:33:29,762 --> 01:33:32,231
I kept thinking about it.

2546
01:33:32,232 --> 01:33:33,302
Then...

2547
01:33:34,362 --> 01:33:37,101
I'll go with my 1st decision. I'll choose the 4th place.

2548
01:33:37,102 --> 01:33:38,102
(He chooses the 5-Million-Dollar Stone Feast!)

2549
01:33:38,432 --> 01:33:40,772
- The 4th place is real?
- The 4th place.

2550
01:33:41,502 --> 01:33:42,511
I won't change my mind.

2551
01:33:42,512 --> 01:33:43,711
(Is the 5-Million-Dollar Stone Feast a real place?)

2552
01:33:43,712 --> 01:33:44,771
I feel nervous.

2553
01:33:44,772 --> 01:33:48,012
(Sixth Sense: City Tour went through a big upgrade.)

2554
01:33:48,542 --> 01:33:50,551
(Kim Min Kyoung visited without knowing it was fake.)

2555
01:33:50,552 --> 01:33:52,551
(Even the viewers were fooled!)

2556
01:33:52,552 --> 01:33:55,181
(Yujeong visited without knowing it was fake.)

2557
01:33:55,182 --> 01:33:57,092
Who would think that is fake?

2558
01:33:57,522 --> 01:33:59,591
Right. That was fake.

2559
01:33:59,592 --> 01:34:00,921
(Episode 2's kimchi bomb chicken, fake)

2560
01:34:00,922 --> 01:34:02,792
- That was fake. Suwon.
- It was good.

2561
01:34:02,992 --> 01:34:04,031
(Episode 3's Giant Bread, fake)

2562
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:05,062
- Busan.
- Busan.

2563
01:34:06,702 --> 01:34:07,801
It's the eighth episode.

2564
01:34:07,802 --> 01:34:08,862
(Finding the fake place for 7 times until now)

2565

(Current score: Production crew 4, members 3)

2568
01:34:20,382 --> 01:34:22,242
- It's 4 to 3.
- Right.

2569
01:34:22,582 --> 01:34:24,311
- We should end with a draw.
- Right.

2570
01:34:24,312 --> 01:34:26,882
It's about ending the season with a draw...

2571
01:34:27,152 --> 01:34:28,522
or not.

2572
01:34:28,822 --> 01:34:30,752
(The last tour for the grand finale)

2573
01:34:31,992 --> 01:34:33,262
Gosh, I have no idea.

2574
01:34:33,722 --> 01:34:34,762
We have to get it right today.

2575
01:34:35,492 --> 01:34:36,561
(The whole city was turned to be fake this time.)

2576
01:34:36,562 --> 01:34:37,762
The whole city was turned to be fake.

(Guinness of Jeonju, Find the Real One)

2578
01:34:40,232 --> 01:34:42,261

- Please!

01:34:48,142 --> 01:34:49,212
(Which place is real?)

2583
01:34:49,772 --> 01:34:50,841
(A house that is 100 years old)

2584
01:34:50,842 --> 01:34:51,842
The first place?

2585
01:34:51,843 --> 01:34:53,811
(A unique drink sold)

2586
01:34:53,812 --> 01:34:55,112
The pumpkin ssanghwatang made no sense.

2587
01:34:55,882 --> 01:34:58,112
(Pumpkin ssanghwatang)

2588
01:34:58,512 --> 01:35:00,452
The first place can never be real.

2589
01:35:01,522 --> 01:35:04,022
(The K-waffle that mesmerized Jeonju)

2590
01:35:05,452 --> 01:35:06,522
It looks delicious.

2591
01:35:08,522 --> 01:35:10,092
- The waffle!
- The chive jeon waffle!

2592
01:35:10,862 --> 01:35:13,302
Tae Hyun said this place was real toward the end.

2593
01:35:13,432 --> 01:35:16,131
The second place was the only place that made sense.

2594
01:35:16,132 --> 01:35:18,432
- It did make sense.
- It was good though.

2595
01:35:19,502 --> 01:35:21,872
(An average of 2,000 customers a day, 48 years, 365 days)

2596

(Around 30 million bowls)

2597
01:35:24,672 --> 01:35:27,712
- The kalguksu was amazing.
- No words were needed for it.

2598
01:35:30,682 --> 01:35:32,822
- That was so good.
- That was so good.

2599
01:35:33,222 --> 01:35:34,452
It's still fake.

2600
01:35:35,082 --> 01:35:36,352
I think the third place is real.

2601
01:35:37,352 --> 01:35:39,692
I'm not sure if this place is real or not.

2602
01:35:40,892 --> 01:35:43,362
(A feast of stones that look like real food)

2603
01:35:44,492 --> 01:35:47,432
All the other sections felt real, but the meat section felt off.

2604
01:35:47,732 --> 01:35:49,772
The meat section made no sense at all.

2605
01:35:49,872 --> 01:35:51,072
The fourth place is fake.

2606
01:35:52,132 --> 01:35:54,772
(Which place is real out of these places?)

01:35:55,042 --> 01:35:56,511
The producer brought out the penalty basket.

Right.

2609
01:35:57,972 --> 01:35:59,512
- No!
- Right?

2610
01:35:59,812 --> 01:36:01,712
- It can't be the fourth place.
- That could be the case.

2611
01:36:02,782 --> 01:36:04,482
(Please!)

2612

(Is it real or fake?)

2619
01:36:15,622 --> 01:36:16,731
- All right.
- It has to be fake.

2620
01:36:16,732 --> 01:36:17,962
Please be fake!

2621
01:36:18,132 --> 01:36:19,132
It must be fake.

(Is it real or fake?)

2623
01:36:23,672 --> 01:36:24,701
What?

2624
01:36:24,702 --> 01:36:26,141
(Pumpkin ssanghwatang set at the 100-year-old house, fake)

2625
01:36:26,142 --> 01:36:27,202
- It's fake!
- Yes!

2626
01:36:28,272 --> 01:36:29,542
(It was indeed fake!)

2627
01:36:29,942 --> 01:36:32,741
- Okay. We went over 1 hurdle.
- Yes! We went over 1 hurdle.

2628
01:36:32,742 --> 01:36:34,941
We managed to get one place right.

2631
01:36:38,882 --> 01:36:39,921
(What about the chive jeon waffle?)

2632
01:36:39,922 --> 01:36:40,952
Is it this one?

2633
01:36:41,552 --> 01:36:42,951
The bibimbap waffle was real,

2634
01:36:42,952 --> 01:36:44,352
- but this dish was fake.
- Fake.

2635
01:36:44,592 --> 01:36:45,991
The second place was my pick.

2636

2641
01:36:58,402 --> 01:37:00,272
- It's fake!
- There are two places left!

2642
01:37:00,742 --> 01:37:03,042
Gosh, it's really the fourth place?

2643

- The 3rd place?

2654

- Awesome.

01:39:49,599 --> 01:39:51,598
- Right.
- This isn't easy.

2721
01:39:51,599 --> 01:39:52,968
(The Food Team and owner worked together.)

2722
01:39:52,969 --> 01:39:54,769
It was the Food Team.

2723
01:39:55,239 --> 01:39:57,579
(They came up with the pumpkin ssanghwatang.)

2724
01:39:57,809 --> 01:39:58,908
(Another expert)

2725
01:39:58,909 --> 01:40:00,149
Really?

2726
01:40:00,749 --> 01:40:01,779
It's the rice cake instructor?

2727
01:40:02,349 --> 01:40:03,679
- The rice cake was so good.
- It was delicious.

2728
01:40:04,549 --> 01:40:06,318
- The dessert.
- It was so cute.

2729
01:40:06,319 --> 01:40:08,648
- No wonder.
- It was delicious.

2730
01:40:08,649 --> 01:40:10,558
Sixth Sense,

2731
01:40:10,559 --> 01:40:12,488
this menu is fake.

2732
01:40:12,489 --> 01:40:14,159
(Pumpkin ssanghwatang set of 100-year-old house, fake)

2733
01:40:14,429 --> 01:40:16,029
- The waffle.
- The chive jeon waffle.

2734
01:40:16,759 --> 01:40:19,129
I have terrible intuition indeed.

2735
01:40:19,999 --> 01:40:22,228
(The taste that Korean's love, bibimbap waffle)

2736
01:40:22,229 --> 01:40:23,969
(The second legendary hot place, bibimbap waffle place)

2737
01:40:24,839 --> 01:40:27,769
(The chive jeon waffle that was said to be made after 10 years)

2738
01:40:28,769 --> 01:40:30,438
It's the Food Team.

2739
01:40:30,439 --> 01:40:31,508
(It's a fake dish made with the Food Team and owner.)

2740
01:40:31,509 --> 01:40:33,979
She had the skills to make it happen.

2741
01:40:34,749 --> 01:40:37,019
A lot of ideas were thought of.

2742
01:40:37,419 --> 01:40:38,448
(It was actually sold for a month.)

2743
01:40:38,449 --> 01:40:40,019
- Once again.
- Once again.

2744
01:40:40,249 --> 01:40:41,289
It was sold once again.

2745
01:40:42,389 --> 01:40:43,489
That many of them were sold?

2746
01:40:43,619 --> 01:40:45,459
It was actually really popular.

2747
01:40:45,959 --> 01:40:48,758
- Everyone, this menu is fake.
- Everyone, this menu is fake.

2748
01:40:48,759 --> 01:40:49,929
(The chive waffle was fake.)

2749
01:40:50,159 --> 01:40:52,128
(The collaboration of the kalguksu place and Sixth Sense)

2750
01:40:52,129 --> 01:40:54,168
You've heard what this is about, right?

2751
01:40:54,169 --> 01:40:56,298
We need a new menu.

2752
01:40:56,299 --> 01:40:58,699
We have to sell it to a lot of people,

2753
01:40:59,269 --> 01:41:00,939
so we can't easily add a new menu.

2754
01:41:01,269 --> 01:41:03,238
I've already said that it'd be hard...

2755
01:41:03,239 --> 01:41:05,209
because our restaurant has been around for long.

2756
01:41:05,939 --> 01:41:07,848
You sell green soybean soup.

2757
01:41:07,849 --> 01:41:09,578
How about making a new dish using that?

2758
01:41:09,579 --> 01:41:12,049
- Nothing is impossible.
- That sounds like a good idea.

2759
01:41:12,249 --> 01:41:14,019
This one was delicious.

2760
01:41:14,549 --> 01:41:16,918
Usually, I add garnish on top like this.

2761
01:41:16,919 --> 01:41:18,758
No wonder it was so good.

2762
01:41:18,759 --> 01:41:20,188
(They chose minari as a garnish for CEO Song.)

2763
01:41:20,189 --> 01:41:22,228
Really? Minari was for me?

2764
01:41:22,229 --> 01:41:23,558
(That's how they piled minari on top.)

2765
01:41:23,559 --> 01:41:24,858
- They chose that for you.
- I almost fell for it.

2766
01:41:24,859 --> 01:41:26,399
I almost fell for it.

2767
01:41:27,069 --> 01:41:30,499
(They added the dish to the menu to sell it.)

2768
01:41:31,939 --> 01:41:33,008
(They started selling black soybean noodles a month before.)

2769
01:41:33,009 --> 01:41:34,809
They really sold it for a month.

2770
01:41:35,209 --> 01:41:36,209
They actually sold it.

2771
01:41:36,210 --> 01:41:37,738
I saw many patrons eating it.

2772
01:41:37,739 --> 01:41:39,478
- Seriously.
- Yes.

2773
01:41:39,479 --> 01:41:40,678
Their mistake was that...

2774
01:41:40,679 --> 01:41:41,879
- it was too much.
- I know.

2775
01:41:42,209 --> 01:41:45,249
Sixth Sense, this menu is fake.

2776
01:41:46,619 --> 01:41:48,048
- Now that they have the recipe, - Well done.

2777
01:41:48,049 --> 01:41:49,348
They can actually sell it.

2778
01:41:49,349 --> 01:41:51,459
The staff went through a lot too.

2779
01:41:51,789 --> 01:41:53,929
(And the stones that looked faker than the fake ones)

2780
01:41:54,389 --> 01:41:55,389
(The only real ones, 5-million-dollar stones)

2781
01:41:55,390 --> 01:41:57,399
The galbi stone was real too.

2782
01:41:57,759 --> 01:41:59,328
They are real?

2783
01:41:59,329 --> 01:42:01,529
- No way.
- The galbi stone is real too?

2784
01:42:02,129 --> 01:42:05,069
I spent about five million dollars to buy them.

2785
01:42:05,969 --> 01:42:07,768
See? He spent that much on the stones.

2786
01:42:07,769 --> 01:42:09,569
How is she so... Oh, my.

2787
01:42:09,709 --> 01:42:10,909
How is it possible?

2788
01:42:11,779 --> 01:42:12,779
The doctor...

2789
01:42:13,579 --> 01:42:14,879
He spent all his life...

2790
01:42:15,349 --> 01:42:19,018
treating patients.

2791
01:42:19,019 --> 01:42:20,949
It must've been tiring.

2792
01:42:22,189 --> 01:42:25,118
He used the little free time he had to collect the stones.

2793
01:42:25,119 --> 01:42:27,159
(The husband collected the stones while treating the patients.)

2794
01:42:27,889 --> 01:42:29,289
This is really...

2795
01:42:29,799 --> 01:42:32,799
- If you don't have such passion...
- Tell me about it.

2796
01:42:32,999 --> 01:42:35,468
During this time,

2797
01:42:35,469 --> 01:42:37,598
he was really ill.

2798
01:42:37,599 --> 01:42:39,339
He had to undergo a big surgery.

2799
01:42:39,939 --> 01:42:44,409
I was diagnosed with end-stage liver cancer.

2800
01:42:44,839 --> 01:42:48,279
I thought of giving them up after I got diagnosed.

2801
01:42:49,179 --> 01:42:52,479
But I felt so bad for the stones I collected. It was a waste too.

2802
01:42:52,819 --> 01:42:55,388
Others call them stones,

2803
01:42:55,389 --> 01:42:58,719
but they feel like children to me.

2804
01:42:59,319 --> 01:43:03,129
"It's what he wanted to do all his life."

2805
01:43:03,559 --> 01:43:06,899
I had no choice but to go along with it.

2806
01:43:07,799 --> 01:43:09,428
They say nothing is complete...

2807
01:43:09,429 --> 01:43:11,269
unless you put it in final shape.

2808
01:43:11,599 --> 01:43:13,838
It's meaningless if they are not introduced to the world.

2809
01:43:13,839 --> 01:43:14,839
(The food stone gallery made with love from a 39-year-old couple)

2810
01:43:15,269 --> 01:43:16,678
It's a tiny space,

2811
01:43:16,679 --> 01:43:18,879
but it's like a gem to us.

2812
01:43:19,339 --> 01:43:22,179
I want to show it to many people.

2813
01:43:24,349 --> 01:43:27,448
(They hope their passion...)

2814
01:43:27,449 --> 01:43:31,118
(will give joy to others.)

2815
01:43:31,119 --> 01:43:32,788
Sixth Sense.

2816
01:43:32,789 --> 01:43:34,858
This place is real.

2817
01:43:34,859 --> 01:43:36,858
Nice. Gosh, I almost got fooled.

2818
01:43:36,859 --> 01:43:38,529
I hope it will do well.

2819
01:43:39,429 --> 01:43:41,568
The wife is a real fairy.

2820
01:43:41,569 --> 01:43:42,698
(Kind-hearted wife is real too.)

2821
01:43:42,699 --> 01:43:44,938
I can't believe we tied the score to 4 to 4...

2822
01:43:44,939 --> 01:43:46,198
- on Episode Eight.
- Tell me about it.

2823
01:43:46,199 --> 01:43:47,768
- It's dramatic.
- Right.

2824
01:43:47,769 --> 01:43:48,838
I know. I'm happy for you.

2825
01:43:48,839 --> 01:43:50,638
The person who gets picked will get a coffee truck.

2826
01:43:50,639 --> 01:43:51,708
It's Song Eun I.

2827
01:43:51,709 --> 01:43:52,938
(Who got the last coffee truck? It's Eun I.)

2828
01:43:52,939 --> 01:43:54,408
- Yes!
- It's her first one.

2829
01:43:54,409 --> 01:43:55,648
- Yes!
- It's her first time.

2830
01:43:55,649 --> 01:43:57,578
She was never picked up until now.

2831
01:43:57,579 --> 01:43:59,988
Everything works out for me.

2832
01:43:59,989 --> 01:44:01,288
- Eun I.
- I love you, tvN.

2833
01:44:01,289 --> 01:44:02,518
There are many places you can send it to.

2834
01:44:02,519 --> 01:44:04,858
- Me? Right. There are so many.
- Yes. The coffee truck.

2835
01:44:04,859 --> 01:44:06,259
- There are so many.
- Come here.

2836
01:44:06,529 --> 01:44:09,489
(Eun I sent the coffee truck to Tae Hyun's set.)

2837
01:44:10,059 --> 01:44:13,428
Today was the last episode...

2838
01:44:13,429 --> 01:44:15,668
- of Sixth Sense: City Tour.
- Right.

2839
01:44:15,669 --> 01:44:17,339
I'm terrible at guessing, indeed.

2840
01:44:18,269 --> 01:44:20,208
- You really are, though.
- Seriously.

2841
01:44:20,209 --> 01:44:22,868
I get why I was invited with Tae Hyun.

2842
01:44:22,869 --> 01:44:23,978
- Why?
- I cleaned up after...

2843
01:44:23,979 --> 01:44:26,609
- what he did here.
- Why would you say that?

2844
01:44:27,149 --> 01:44:29,178
- Why point that out?
- I'm really satisfied.

2845
01:44:29,179 --> 01:44:31,448
Thank you, though.

2846
01:44:31,449 --> 01:44:32,449
That's nice.

2847
01:44:32,450 --> 01:44:34,219
(Touched by their father-daughter relationship)

2848
01:44:34,419 --> 01:44:37,259
It was fun to be on a show with my close friend...

2849
01:44:37,759 --> 01:44:38,818
after a long while.

2850
01:44:38,819 --> 01:44:40,859
I'm glad I got to meet...

2851
01:44:41,259 --> 01:44:42,658
these two blunt members.

2852
01:44:42,659 --> 01:44:44,758
This isn't the end.

2853
01:44:44,759 --> 01:44:46,198
We'll return.

2854
01:44:46,199 --> 01:44:47,798
Thank you for supporting our show.

2855
01:44:47,799 --> 01:44:49,399
I'll see you in Season Two.

2856
01:44:49,939 --> 01:44:53,138
I'd like to thank the numerous chefs who helped us,

2857
01:44:53,139 --> 01:44:55,438
and the store owners...

2858
01:44:55,439 --> 01:44:58,078
who gladly joined our show.

2859
01:44:58,079 --> 01:45:01,278
I'd also like to thank all the guests who joined us.

2860
01:45:01,279 --> 01:45:03,079
(The store owners who made fake items with us...)

2861
01:45:04,179 --> 01:45:05,318
(and all the small business owners)

2862
01:45:05,319 --> 01:45:09,649
(The bitter winter is over, and the warm spring is here.)

2863
01:45:09,819 --> 01:45:11,958
(We wish everyone a peaceful and warm year.)

2864
01:45:11,959 --> 01:45:13,588
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2865
01:45:13,589 --> 01:45:15,089
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2866
01:45:15,529 --> 01:45:16,728
(Sixth Sense: City Tour's journey to find the fakes...)

2867
01:45:16,729 --> 01:45:19,969
(will continue in the next season.)
