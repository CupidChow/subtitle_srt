1
00:00:15,247 --> 00:00:17,617
It's been a while, hasn't it?

2
00:00:18,088 --> 00:00:19,858
This place has changed a lot.

3
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:21,488
Oh, gosh.

4
00:00:21,928 --> 00:00:23,157
It's a nostalgic place.

5
00:00:23,158 --> 00:00:24,297
(Seoul Institute of the Arts, Namsan Campus)

6
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,427
The theater is still here.

7
00:00:26,428 --> 00:00:27,467
(He has a lot of memories here.)

8
00:00:27,568 --> 00:00:28,797
This place has changed a lot.

9
00:00:28,798 --> 00:00:30,567
I was so surprised when I visited the other day.

10
00:00:30,568 --> 00:00:31,638
There used to be...

11
00:00:32,537 --> 00:00:33,908
Is that gone too?

12
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,806
I wish the school stayed the same.

13
00:00:36,807 --> 00:00:37,936
(Disappointed)

14
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:39,908
How long has it been since you came here last?

15
00:00:40,447 --> 00:00:43,576
As of the date of this shoot... Last July.

16
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:44,976
(He was here 6 months ago.)

17
00:00:44,977 --> 00:00:45,977
Yes.

18
00:00:46,448 --> 00:00:48,248
Yes. It hasn't been that long.

19
00:00:49,047 --> 00:00:51,086
Did you think I'd cry or something?

20
00:00:51,087 --> 00:00:52,256
(Touching moment ruined)

21
00:00:52,257 --> 00:00:53,257
It hasn't been that long.

22
00:00:54,757 --> 00:00:58,058
The building here... What is it now? National Security Planning.

23
00:00:58,397 --> 00:00:59,697
National Security Planning.

24
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:00,967
It's now called National Intelligence Service.

25
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:03,698
(National Security Planning, Seoul Institute of the Arts)

26
00:01:03,699 --> 00:01:06,296
(The scary NSP building is right next to the school.)

27
00:01:06,297 --> 00:01:08,336
Since our school was small,

28
00:01:08,337 --> 00:01:10,378
we played foot volleyball here.

29
00:01:10,678 --> 00:01:13,577
While playing foot volleyball, we'd kick the ball over there.

30
00:01:14,047 --> 00:01:15,307
To the NSP.

31
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:16,677
(Chilling)

32
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:19,817
Sometimes, if there's someone nice, they kick it back over for us.

33
00:01:20,217 --> 00:01:21,618
If there's no one, it's gone forever.

34
00:01:22,017 --> 00:01:24,817
We can't go in there. To the NSP.

35
00:01:25,017 --> 00:01:26,017
Oh, my!

36
00:01:26,018 --> 00:01:27,788
(Laughing)

37
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,058
Oh, CEO Song.

38
00:01:30,827 --> 00:01:33,156
(A big smile)

39
00:01:33,157 --> 00:01:34,167
Hi.

40
00:01:34,168 --> 00:01:35,796
- You must be cold. - You got here so early.

41
00:01:35,797 --> 00:01:37,668
You did the opening by yourself.

42
00:01:38,767 --> 00:01:40,307
You're such a busy man.

43
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:42,937
- We will... - Everyone.

44
00:01:43,138 --> 00:01:45,207
Everyone doing a show with Jae Seok.

45
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:46,877
Go to bed early.

46
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:48,977
- He starts so early. - Her voice...

47
00:01:48,978 --> 00:01:51,676
- Her voice is hoarse, isn't it? - He starts so early.

48
00:01:51,677 --> 00:01:52,977
Eun I. This is the NSP.

49
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:54,986
- Right, the NSP. - Yes.

50
00:01:54,987 --> 00:01:56,186
So when we played...

51
00:01:56,187 --> 00:01:57,816
- foot volleyball here... - I told them already.

52
00:01:57,817 --> 00:01:59,456
- You did? - When the ball goes over...

53
00:01:59,457 --> 00:02:01,358
Did you tell them how only the balls that were flat would come back?

54
00:02:01,457 --> 00:02:03,486
(I haven't told them that yet.)

55
00:02:03,487 --> 00:02:04,897
According to legend,

56
00:02:04,898 --> 00:02:08,027
some students climbed over the fence to get their ball,

57
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:09,697
- and they never came back. - They never came back.

58
00:02:09,698 --> 00:02:11,368
There are legends like that.

59
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:14,307
- CEO Song and I... - Yes.

60
00:02:14,308 --> 00:02:16,007
- were in the same class. - That's right.

61
00:02:16,008 --> 00:02:18,137
- We entered school in 1991. - We were in the same class.

62
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,407
I was a broadcasting and entertainment major.

63
00:02:19,408 --> 00:02:20,746
- She was a theater major. - A theater major.

64
00:02:20,747 --> 00:02:22,907
She was in that yard over there...

65
00:02:22,908 --> 00:02:24,478
doing the mask dance.

66
00:02:24,747 --> 00:02:27,447
- On some days, she would be... - Let's dance.

67
00:02:27,448 --> 00:02:29,417
On some days, she would be playing the guitar over there.

68
00:02:29,418 --> 00:02:31,086
"What is this person?"

69
00:02:31,087 --> 00:02:33,387
- Dance! - So...

70
00:02:33,388 --> 00:02:36,087
- Your knees are still strong. - They are, right?

71
00:02:36,388 --> 00:02:37,727
Your knees are still strong.

72
00:02:37,728 --> 00:02:38,796
My knees are completely done.

73
00:02:38,797 --> 00:02:41,097
And then Jae Seok...

74
00:02:41,098 --> 00:02:42,467
- Me. - I remember...

75
00:02:42,468 --> 00:02:43,766
There's a specific scene.

76
00:02:43,767 --> 00:02:45,296
- What is that? - A specific scene.

77
00:02:45,297 --> 00:02:46,937
I was over there then too.

78
00:02:46,938 --> 00:02:47,938
"He's the guy..."

79
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:49,866
- The guy who became a comedian. - "who got into KBS."

80
00:02:49,867 --> 00:02:51,608
"Oh, who?" I looked over.

81
00:02:51,908 --> 00:02:53,847
(Excited)

82
00:02:53,848 --> 00:02:56,047
He was puffing his chest out this much.

83
00:02:56,948 --> 00:02:58,076
Like this.

84
00:02:58,077 --> 00:02:59,576
He was wearing a deep green suit.

85
00:02:59,577 --> 00:03:01,347
You had a matching suit then.

86
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:02,646
You had one hand in your pocket.

87
00:03:02,647 --> 00:03:03,717
(It's me, Yu Jae Seok.)

88
00:03:03,718 --> 00:03:04,818
He was walking over like this.

89
00:03:05,557 --> 00:03:07,426
- He was already a star. - Hey.

90
00:03:07,427 --> 00:03:08,926
- He was already a star. - I wouldn't have...

91
00:03:08,927 --> 00:03:10,227
acted like that.

92
00:03:10,228 --> 00:03:12,097
By the looks of him, he was already a star.

93
00:03:12,098 --> 00:03:13,627
(Yu Jae Seok, University student, Job: Already a superstar)

94
00:03:13,628 --> 00:03:15,897
Then my dark period began.

95
00:03:16,668 --> 00:03:19,767
(While the two friends of 30 years take a trip down memory lane...)

96
00:03:19,968 --> 00:03:23,038
(At the same time, A cafe in Chungmuro)

97
00:03:23,438 --> 00:03:24,438
Oh, gosh.

98
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:27,948
(This person looks anxious.)

99
00:03:29,677 --> 00:03:32,577
(New member, Ko Kyung Pyo)

100
00:03:33,888 --> 00:03:35,517
(Sighing)

101
00:03:36,047 --> 00:03:38,188
(Laughing)

102
00:03:38,957 --> 00:03:40,157
Oh, gosh.

103
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:41,658
(He's waiting for someone alone.)

104
00:03:42,057 --> 00:03:43,387
Oh, gosh.

105
00:03:43,388 --> 00:03:44,597
(Kyung Pyo looks very anxious.)

106
00:03:44,598 --> 00:03:46,497
(Behind him!)

107
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:52,637
(You can already feel her bright energy.)

108
00:03:52,638 --> 00:03:53,638
- Hello. - Hi.

109
00:03:53,938 --> 00:03:56,007
- Hello. Nice to meet you. - Hello.

110
00:03:56,008 --> 00:03:57,977
- Nice to meet you. - Hello.

111
00:03:57,978 --> 00:03:59,176
Nice to meet you.

112
00:03:59,177 --> 00:04:01,176
- Nice to meet you. - What a pretty hair color.

113
00:04:01,177 --> 00:04:02,276
Thank you.

114
00:04:02,277 --> 00:04:03,947
It hasn't been long since I dyed it.

115
00:04:03,948 --> 00:04:05,917
You're right. The roots are well...

116
00:04:05,918 --> 00:04:07,388
- They're dyed well, right? - Yes.

117
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:08,717
(Laughing awkwardly)

118
00:04:08,718 --> 00:04:09,788
Hello.

119
00:04:10,188 --> 00:04:11,287
(Laughing)

120
00:04:11,288 --> 00:04:12,918
(Sighing)

121
00:04:13,258 --> 00:04:14,687
(Awkward)

122
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:17,796
Because we've never... Never... We've never met before.

123
00:04:17,797 --> 00:04:19,056
You can speak to me casually.

124
00:04:19,057 --> 00:04:20,396
- You can be informal. - Right...

125
00:04:20,397 --> 00:04:22,366
- You can be informal. - Right...

126
00:04:22,367 --> 00:04:23,367
Okay.

127
00:04:23,698 --> 00:04:25,167
(Okay.)

128
00:04:25,168 --> 00:04:26,636
- That was fast. - Here.

129
00:04:26,637 --> 00:04:27,967
- Cheers. - Cheers.

130
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:29,736
Are you going to speak informally?

131
00:04:29,737 --> 00:04:32,477
- I don't usually do so. - You don't. I see.

132
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:34,306
Would you prefer that, bro?

133
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:35,307
Well...

134
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:37,546
(Just his type of humor)

135
00:04:37,547 --> 00:04:38,547
Why?

136
00:04:38,548 --> 00:04:39,676
(Breaking the ice by speaking informally)

137
00:04:39,677 --> 00:04:40,946
That was so cute.

138
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,647
- I'll call you my brother. - Okay.

139
00:04:42,648 --> 00:04:44,218
I'll call you my brother.

140
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:47,187
What are we doing today?

141
00:04:48,127 --> 00:04:50,056
Actually, I don't really know either.

142
00:04:50,057 --> 00:04:51,727
(What will we do on the new Sixth Sense?)

143
00:04:51,728 --> 00:04:54,627
Is this the expanded version of Sixth Sense?

144
00:04:55,067 --> 00:04:57,697
- Oh, Sixth Sense: City Tour? - City Tour?

145
00:04:58,968 --> 00:05:02,837
(As they explore the various cities of Korea, )

146
00:05:02,838 --> 00:05:05,908
(they will visit trendy places.)

147
00:05:06,237 --> 00:05:08,877
(Within these trendy places in the city, )

148
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,817
(they must figure out what's fake.)

149
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,817
(What you eat)

150
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,658
(What you see)

151
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:20,887
(Who you meet)

152
00:05:21,127 --> 00:05:23,828
(Something is fake!)

153
00:05:24,228 --> 00:05:26,958
(They must take a whole new approach...)

154
00:05:27,268 --> 00:05:29,697
(to find the hidden fake things.)

155
00:05:30,637 --> 00:05:33,098
(Find the fake things in trendy places.)

156
00:05:33,497 --> 00:05:36,167
(What will be the first city for Sixth Sense: City Tour?)

157
00:05:36,168 --> 00:05:41,677
(Seoul)

158
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:45,446
(The heart of Seoul, Jung-gu)

159
00:05:45,447 --> 00:05:47,517
(Chungmuro)

160
00:05:47,518 --> 00:05:49,446
(Euljiro)

161
00:05:49,447 --> 00:05:51,387
(Myeong-dong)

162
00:05:51,658 --> 00:05:54,088
(Between the alleys that still have the taste of the past...)

163
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:57,527
(is an area full of hidden trendy places.)

164
00:05:57,528 --> 00:06:01,228
(Among the trendy places of Jung-gu, there is one fake place.)

165
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:04,597
(Can you find the fake?)

166
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:05,996
- We'll give you a map first. - Really?

167
00:06:05,997 --> 00:06:08,207
Why aren't Kyung Pyo and Mimi here yet?

168
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:10,237
- Right. I was curious to meet them. - What is this?

169
00:06:10,507 --> 00:06:13,136
This kind of looks like a map of Jung-gu.

170
00:06:13,137 --> 00:06:15,277
- Oh, the area around Jung-gu. - Oh, we're doing a city tour...

171
00:06:15,278 --> 00:06:17,107
of Jung-gu today.

172
00:06:17,108 --> 00:06:19,778
- Within this, one thing is fake? - One thing is fake?

173
00:06:20,018 --> 00:06:21,546
I always say this,

174
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,546
but I'm an old city center expert.

175
00:06:23,547 --> 00:06:24,957
- I love it so much. - Right.

176
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:26,256
- I love old city centers. - He's right.

177
00:06:26,257 --> 00:06:29,157
And I was born in Yongsan-gu.

178
00:06:29,158 --> 00:06:30,227
Right.

179
00:06:30,228 --> 00:06:32,056
My family was pretty well off back in the day.

180
00:06:32,057 --> 00:06:33,626
Yes. She's from a nice family.

181
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:35,426
Yes, it was like that then.

182
00:06:35,427 --> 00:06:37,097
- We can talk about that later. - Don't you have a younger brother?

183
00:06:37,098 --> 00:06:38,467
I do have a younger brother.

184
00:06:38,468 --> 00:06:40,636
- I've never met him, right? - You have.

185
00:06:40,637 --> 00:06:41,667
- I have? - Yes, you have.

186
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:43,137
- Oh, I have? I see. - Yes.

187
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:44,407
(The intense back and forth of two friends of 30 years)

188
00:06:44,408 --> 00:06:45,907
If she says so, it's true.

189
00:06:45,908 --> 00:06:48,377
- You have an older sister too. - My older sister lives in Canada.

190
00:06:48,677 --> 00:06:49,807
Canada. Calgary.

191
00:06:50,408 --> 00:06:52,676
- Say hello. - She's one of three.

192
00:06:52,677 --> 00:06:54,087
- Her name is Seung Yeon. - Oh, right.

193
00:06:54,088 --> 00:06:56,316
Seung Yeon. Are you doing well in Calgary?

194
00:06:56,317 --> 00:06:57,486
And I'm one of four. I have an older brother too.

195
00:06:57,487 --> 00:06:59,017
- You're one of four? - Yes.

196
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:02,056
- Hey, you're one of four? - I am. Two boys and two girls.

197
00:07:02,057 --> 00:07:04,126
- Why didn't I know that? - You didn't.

198
00:07:04,127 --> 00:07:05,256
I'm one of three kids.

199
00:07:05,257 --> 00:07:07,626
I know. I went to your younger sister's wedding.

200
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:09,697
You and your younger sister didn't seem close.

201
00:07:10,528 --> 00:07:13,136
I was so surprised. I had never seen siblings so not close to each other.

202
00:07:13,137 --> 00:07:15,707
- It was her wedding. - How did you know that?

203
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,908
I just went because it was my younger sister's wedding.

204
00:07:19,177 --> 00:07:21,278
(As a sister, she understands.)

205
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:22,777
I have to go.

206
00:07:22,778 --> 00:07:25,477
- That's all you need to know. - You're right.

207
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,287
We need to go meet Kyung Pyo.

208
00:07:27,288 --> 00:07:29,546
- They're at the meeting point. - Oh, really?

209
00:07:29,547 --> 00:07:31,986
- Okay. Let's walk. - Then let's get going.

210
00:07:31,987 --> 00:07:32,987
(Taking off to meet Kyung Pyo and Mimi!)

211
00:07:32,988 --> 00:07:35,186
Oh, it's still here. The way down to the basement.

212
00:07:35,187 --> 00:07:36,827
- It's here. - The earthen jars here.

213
00:07:36,828 --> 00:07:38,327
Down here is the broadcasting and entertainment department.

214
00:07:38,328 --> 00:07:39,328
Here is the traditional Korean music department.

215
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:41,566
In the basement here...

216
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,597
was the broadcasting and entertainment department...

217
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:43,626
and the film department.

218
00:07:43,627 --> 00:07:45,397
Back here was the dance department.

219
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:46,636
- Yes, you're right. - The Korean music department.

220
00:07:46,637 --> 00:07:47,837
The broadcasting and entertainment department.

221
00:07:47,838 --> 00:07:48,967
Here is the theater department,

222
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,136
- which uses the grand theater. - The grand theater.

223
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,777
CEO Song was in this grand theater.

224
00:07:51,778 --> 00:07:53,137
The theater department used this space.

225
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,417
(Along with Eun I, several big stars performed here.)

226
00:07:57,418 --> 00:07:59,046
(Hwang Jung Min, Ryu Seung Ryong, Shin Dong Yeob)

227
00:07:59,047 --> 00:08:00,847
This is still the same.

228
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:02,116
(He spotted another memory from their college days.)

229
00:08:02,117 --> 00:08:03,917
They used to post the admissions results here.

230
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:05,486
- You're right. - Here.

231
00:08:05,487 --> 00:08:06,788
- Here. - Right. All across here.

232
00:08:07,057 --> 00:08:09,157
- The admissions results were here. - Right.

233
00:08:09,158 --> 00:08:10,857
- The results would be posted here. - You could see them here.

234
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:12,056
- Yes, you could see them here. - Listed by department.

235
00:08:12,057 --> 00:08:13,757
- You could check by department. - Yes.

236
00:08:14,497 --> 00:08:16,967
(Back then, the list of admitted students...)

237
00:08:16,968 --> 00:08:19,437
(were listed on a large poster.)

238
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:22,506
(Where is my name?)

239
00:08:22,507 --> 00:08:23,737
I called my father.

240
00:08:23,978 --> 00:08:25,207
- To tell him I got in. - Right.

241
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:26,577
- From a phone booth. - We would call from a phone booth.

242
00:08:26,578 --> 00:08:27,907
Because we didn't have cellphones back then.

243
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:29,547
- Right. It was like that back then. - "I got in."

244
00:08:29,877 --> 00:08:30,978
Oh, gosh.

245
00:08:31,547 --> 00:08:33,278
Wait. Where are we going?

246
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:35,587
It says, "Toegye-ro 31..."

247
00:08:35,588 --> 00:08:37,187
It looks like a theater.

248
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:41,587
We didn't really walk down alleyways like this.

249
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:44,396
And you could only come here if you had some money.

250
00:08:44,397 --> 00:08:45,397
(Laughing)

251
00:08:45,398 --> 00:08:47,097
- I think this is it. - This is it.

252
00:08:47,098 --> 00:08:48,766
- Kyung Pyo and... Oh, my. - This is it.

253
00:08:48,767 --> 00:08:49,827
- Oh, my. - Oh, my.

254
00:08:49,828 --> 00:08:51,067
(Sixth Sense, assemble.)

255
00:08:51,068 --> 00:08:53,067
- Mimi is here too. Oh, my. - Hello.

256
00:08:53,068 --> 00:08:54,807
- Hello. - Fashion terrorist.

257
00:08:54,808 --> 00:08:55,808
(Fashion terrorist)

258
00:08:55,809 --> 00:08:57,036
- Hi. - Hello.

259
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,237
- Hello. - Hello.

260
00:08:58,537 --> 00:08:59,876
- Hello. - Hello.

261
00:08:59,877 --> 00:09:02,308
- What were you doing? - We were being awkward.

262
00:09:02,877 --> 00:09:05,217
- You should have something warm. - That sounds nice.

263
00:09:05,218 --> 00:09:06,616
- Excuse me. - What did you have?

264
00:09:06,617 --> 00:09:09,547
- I had peppermint tea. - Two hot teas, please.

265
00:09:09,548 --> 00:09:10,616
Hello, sir.

266
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:13,886
I'd like a mild Americano.

267
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,458
- What about you, Eun I? - Celebrities really are different.

268
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,256
Celebrities really are different.

269
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:21,496
- An Americano... - Aren't you also a celebrity?

270
00:09:21,497 --> 00:09:23,496
Aren't we all celebrities?

271
00:09:23,497 --> 00:09:24,568
- I mean... - Aren't you a celebrity?

272
00:09:25,037 --> 00:09:26,736
- If so... - I should learn from you.

273
00:09:26,737 --> 00:09:28,736
- Oh, gosh. - Are you so happy?

274
00:09:28,737 --> 00:09:30,536
- Are you so happy? - Yes.

275
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:32,136
This is refreshing and bewildering.

276
00:09:32,137 --> 00:09:33,376
- So I... - Really?

277
00:09:33,377 --> 00:09:35,447
You know, Kyung Pyo is famous for...

278
00:09:35,448 --> 00:09:38,048
- being a long-time fan of yours. - Kyung Pyo...

279
00:09:38,417 --> 00:09:39,477
("Ko Kyung Pyo, Yu Jae Seok is My Idol, 'I Like Him So Much'")

280
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:41,116
(Kyung Pyo is a really famous fan of Jae Seok's)

281
00:09:41,117 --> 00:09:42,718
("Ko Kyung Pyo is a Fan of Yu Jae Seok's")

282
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:44,116
When I hosted "Come to Play,"

283
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:45,786
Kyung Pyo was filming a sitcom in the next studio.

284
00:09:45,787 --> 00:09:46,787
You're right.

285
00:09:46,788 --> 00:09:48,227
Kyung Pyo would come sometimes...

286
00:09:48,228 --> 00:09:49,927
- You cried that day, right? - Yes, I did.

287
00:09:49,928 --> 00:09:51,828
Because I was a total newcomer,

288
00:09:51,897 --> 00:09:53,827
- and he first said, "Kyung Pyo." - Right.

289
00:09:53,828 --> 00:09:56,367
- I was so touched. - This is so cool.

290
00:09:57,497 --> 00:10:01,567
(Kyung Pyo is finally on a show with Jae Seok, his idol.)

291
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:02,708
This is so cool.

292
00:10:02,938 --> 00:10:04,437
When I was hosting "Come to Play,"

293
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:06,736
Kyung Pyo was filming a sitcom in the next studio.

294
00:10:06,737 --> 00:10:08,447
And Kwang Soo was also filming a sitcom in the next studio.

295
00:10:08,448 --> 00:10:09,608
Oh, gosh.

296
00:10:09,948 --> 00:10:11,947
The kids I like...

297
00:10:11,948 --> 00:10:14,688
- They started on sitcoms. - They all started on sitcoms.

298
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,016
So...

299
00:10:16,017 --> 00:10:17,516
(His new favorite guy after Kwang Soo)

300
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:19,357
- The connections... - So I...

301
00:10:19,358 --> 00:10:20,587
(They're oddly similar.)

302
00:10:20,588 --> 00:10:23,727
This is almost the first time he's doing something with me.

303
00:10:23,728 --> 00:10:25,496
- It's the first time, yes. - It's the first time.

304
00:10:25,497 --> 00:10:27,026
We've seen each other...

305
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:28,427
- here and there. - Right.

306
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:30,298
But it was just that.

307
00:10:30,568 --> 00:10:32,266
You're looking good, Kyung Pyo.

308
00:10:32,267 --> 00:10:33,497
Me? Really?

309
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:36,608
Kyung Pyo is looking good.

310
00:10:36,938 --> 00:10:38,236
Why do you look so good?

311
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:40,077
(Why do you look so good?)

312
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:42,047
Kyung Pyo is looking good.

313
00:10:42,048 --> 00:10:43,708
(My star told me that I was looking good.)

314
00:10:44,318 --> 00:10:45,616
(I don't know what to say.)

315
00:10:45,617 --> 00:10:46,647
You...

316
00:10:46,948 --> 00:10:47,986
(What is this drama?)

317
00:10:47,987 --> 00:10:49,948
- Oh, my gosh! - Seriously. Hey.

318
00:10:50,218 --> 00:10:51,858
You're looking good.

319
00:10:51,987 --> 00:10:53,156
Oh, thank you.

320
00:10:53,157 --> 00:10:54,188
(Shy)

321
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,656
Did something happen?

322
00:10:55,657 --> 00:10:57,698
(Please look forward to their romance.)

323
00:10:57,997 --> 00:10:58,997
Look at this.

324
00:10:58,998 --> 00:11:00,827
(Sharing the map with Kyung Pyo and Mimi)

325
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:03,967
So this is Sixth Sense: City Tour.

326
00:11:03,968 --> 00:11:07,438
We have to find the fake among trendy places in the city.

327
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,266
We're going to three places, and I guess one is fake.

328
00:11:10,267 --> 00:11:11,938
(Which trendy places in Jung-gu will they tour today?)

329
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:14,347
We're doing a city tour of Jung-gu.

330
00:11:14,348 --> 00:11:16,308
It's called, "Owners who are crazy about something."

331
00:11:18,548 --> 00:11:21,117
(Crazy about savoriness)

332
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:23,387
(Butter)

333
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:25,718
(Crazy about sweetness)

334
00:11:26,617 --> 00:11:29,458
(Ice cream)

335
00:11:32,997 --> 00:11:35,727
(Crazy about Korea)

336
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:37,798
(Korea)

337
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:40,766
An owner crazy about butter. An owner crazy about ice cream.

338
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:41,906
An owner crazy about Korea.

339
00:11:41,907 --> 00:11:43,906
(Out of the three trendy places, one of them is fake.)

340
00:11:43,907 --> 00:11:45,877
(Which of these places in Jung-gu is fake?)

341
00:11:46,838 --> 00:11:48,978
Let's go here. Toegye-ro, Jung-gu.

342
00:11:49,147 --> 00:11:51,917
(Heading to the first trendy place with butter)

343
00:11:52,448 --> 00:11:54,146
The camera does you wrong.

344
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:55,717
You're much more handsome and taller in person.

345
00:11:55,718 --> 00:11:57,286
Really? I have this thing though.

346
00:11:57,287 --> 00:11:58,386
Since my neck is long,

347
00:11:58,387 --> 00:12:00,318
my shoulders are lower than other people that are 185cm.

348
00:12:01,757 --> 00:12:03,087
(He's a funny guy.)

349
00:12:03,088 --> 00:12:04,126
Your shoulders are low.

350
00:12:04,127 --> 00:12:06,797
- I didn't notice that. - Oh, you're right.

351
00:12:06,798 --> 00:12:08,367
I thought it was weird.

352
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:12,097
- Our shoulders are similar. - My shoulders are low.

353
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:13,567
- So why is he so tall? - You're really right.

354
00:12:13,568 --> 00:12:14,937
If I push my head out,

355
00:12:14,938 --> 00:12:16,406
my neck is really long.

356
00:12:16,407 --> 00:12:17,707
It really is long.

357
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:18,708
- Oh, my. - Seriously.

358
00:12:18,709 --> 00:12:20,637
Why is your neck so long?

359
00:12:20,777 --> 00:12:22,006
- My neck is so long. - That's so funny.

360
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:23,307
Your body is a personal talent.

361
00:12:23,308 --> 00:12:25,116
I'm a bit flimsy.

362
00:12:25,117 --> 00:12:27,147
- Flimsy. - Flimsy.

363
00:12:28,218 --> 00:12:30,047
- The weather is so nice today. - Seriously.

364
00:12:30,048 --> 00:12:31,156
Not even a small cloud.

365
00:12:31,157 --> 00:12:32,188
(Their first city tour is off to a start.)

366
00:12:32,487 --> 00:12:33,817
Oh, hello.

367
00:12:33,818 --> 00:12:36,058
- On a weekend morning. - So early in the morning.

368
00:12:36,228 --> 00:12:38,798
- Hello. - There are many foreigners.

369
00:12:39,098 --> 00:12:41,397
(Stopping for a minute in front of the crosswalk)

370
00:12:41,798 --> 00:12:44,736
- This used to be Chungmuro. - Oh, my.

371
00:12:44,737 --> 00:12:47,098
This is still Chungmuro.

372
00:12:47,468 --> 00:12:49,536
Jae Seok. This is Chungmuro Station, exit seven.

373
00:12:49,537 --> 00:12:51,236
- Hey. - This is exit three.

374
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,876
- It says Chungmuro right there. - It says Chungmuro right there.

375
00:12:52,877 --> 00:12:54,377
- Chungmuro. - Hey, Kyung Pyo.

376
00:12:54,777 --> 00:12:56,107
Hey, look.

377
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,717
Listen. Listen carefully.

378
00:12:57,718 --> 00:12:58,876
Chungmuro is still here.

379
00:12:58,877 --> 00:13:00,146
- What do you mean, "It used to be?" - Okay.

380
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:02,447
- Listen carefully. - Okay.

381
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,717
The Chungmuro I'm talking about...

382
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:06,217
isn't just the name.

383
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:07,886
This used to be a movie road.

384
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,286
- Oh, right. - Oh, a movie road.

385
00:13:09,287 --> 00:13:12,996
There are still some production company offices here,

386
00:13:12,997 --> 00:13:14,057
but many of them have moved.

387
00:13:14,058 --> 00:13:15,297
- Right. - Many have moved out.

388
00:13:15,298 --> 00:13:16,997
They used to say things like that.

389
00:13:17,228 --> 00:13:19,967
- "The new star of Chungmuro." - "The new star of Chungmuro."

390
00:13:19,968 --> 00:13:21,808
- "The rising star of Chungmuro." - Right.

391
00:13:21,938 --> 00:13:24,166
Daehan Cinema is starting construction.

392
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:26,876
This place closed down.

393
00:13:26,877 --> 00:13:29,047
- You're right. They closed down. - They don't show movies anymore.

394
00:13:29,048 --> 00:13:30,677
This used to be a movie theater?

395
00:13:30,678 --> 00:13:32,577
- It was. - I see.

396
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:34,016
Back in the day, this was the first place...

397
00:13:34,017 --> 00:13:35,416
- that showed new movies. - Right.

398
00:13:35,417 --> 00:13:36,746
In middle school,

399
00:13:36,747 --> 00:13:38,357
- we came here to see a movie. - Oh, really?

400
00:13:38,358 --> 00:13:40,587
- Hello. - Hello.

401
00:13:40,588 --> 00:13:41,626
- Hello. - Hello.

402
00:13:41,627 --> 00:13:43,557
- It's so nice to meet you. - Hello.

403
00:13:43,558 --> 00:13:44,656
(A peace sign)

404
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,027
This is nice.

405
00:13:46,328 --> 00:13:47,866
It's nice being on the street.

406
00:13:47,867 --> 00:13:49,396
- Right? - It's nice.

407
00:13:49,397 --> 00:13:51,067
Outgoing people...

408
00:13:51,068 --> 00:13:53,137
always wave their hands and do this.

409
00:13:53,737 --> 00:13:56,407
Then they stop. "Take a picture of me."

410
00:13:57,068 --> 00:13:58,536
She looks so kind.

411
00:13:58,537 --> 00:13:59,838
- Yes. - She was so funny.

412
00:14:00,277 --> 00:14:01,776
This is nice.

413
00:14:01,777 --> 00:14:04,078
When else could we walk like this?

414
00:14:04,348 --> 00:14:05,376
This is nice.

415
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:07,347
There's a really good gukbap place here.

416
00:14:07,348 --> 00:14:08,646
- Oh, really? - Here, right?

417
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:10,246
- That place? - It's here.

418
00:14:10,247 --> 00:14:11,256
- Over there. - It's still the same.

419
00:14:11,257 --> 00:14:12,858
- There, right? - Yes.

420
00:14:13,757 --> 00:14:15,727
(A myriad of printing houses)

421
00:14:15,728 --> 00:14:17,126
In Chungmuro,

422
00:14:17,127 --> 00:14:20,496
when you walk through the alleys with printing houses on either side,

423
00:14:20,497 --> 00:14:21,727
you go, "Oh, my. What is this place?"

424
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:23,767
- You're right. - There are places like that.

425
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:28,067
(These stores have been around for a long time.)

426
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:29,068
You're right.

427
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:31,078
Butter in this alley?

428
00:14:31,377 --> 00:14:33,808
- It doesn't have a butter vibe. - I agree.

429
00:14:34,178 --> 00:14:37,818
(This doesn't seem like an alley that would have butter.)

430
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:39,616
I'm looking now.

431
00:14:39,617 --> 00:14:40,647
Wait. Is this the place?

432
00:14:42,017 --> 00:14:43,188
- Oh, it's here! - Wait. What is this? "Butter..."

433
00:14:43,387 --> 00:14:44,457
- What? - What?

434
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:46,087
"Butter-Aged Pork Belly."

435
00:14:46,088 --> 00:14:47,317
(Butter-Aged Pork Belly)

436
00:14:47,318 --> 00:14:50,257
(Butter-Aged Pork Belly)

437
00:14:50,558 --> 00:14:53,526
(Butter and pork belly)

438
00:14:53,527 --> 00:14:56,666
(The unpredictable meeting of two ingredients)

439
00:14:56,667 --> 00:15:00,697
(What is this trendy place that is crazy about butter?)

440
00:15:00,698 --> 00:15:02,136
Oh, this is kind of suspicious.

441
00:15:02,137 --> 00:15:04,537
- Oh, but this is too... - I see...

442
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:06,108
I can't tell at all.

443
00:15:06,537 --> 00:15:07,577
(Speechless at how real it feels)

444
00:15:07,578 --> 00:15:09,807
- Oh, this looks too real. - But...

445
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:11,747
- That looks fake... - What?

446
00:15:11,917 --> 00:15:12,917
It looks fake.

447
00:15:12,918 --> 00:15:13,947
But it looks kind of old...

448
00:15:13,948 --> 00:15:15,786
I feel like they crumpled this up on purpose...

449
00:15:15,787 --> 00:15:16,947
Kind of, right?

450
00:15:16,948 --> 00:15:19,217
- Kind of, right? The details... - Yes.

451
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:20,757
Oh, it's warm.

452
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:22,457
- Hello, sir. - Oh, it's warm.

453
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,597
- Hello. - Hello.

454
00:15:24,598 --> 00:15:26,156
Oh, "I love butter?"

455
00:15:26,157 --> 00:15:27,297
("I love butter?")

456
00:15:27,298 --> 00:15:30,497
(They spotted this as they walked in.)

457
00:15:30,667 --> 00:15:33,767
("I love butter" hat)

458
00:15:33,938 --> 00:15:36,636
- Oh, that snack too... - Right. The boxes...

459
00:15:36,637 --> 00:15:37,807
It looks as if they displayed it...

460
00:15:37,808 --> 00:15:38,977
- on purpose. - Exactly.

461
00:15:38,978 --> 00:15:40,207
- Exactly. - The snacks.

462
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,077
- The Butter Coconuts... - The Butter Coconuts...

463
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:44,616
- The hard part of this show... - Yes?

464
00:15:44,617 --> 00:15:47,448
Is that it makes you suspect everything even if it's real.

465
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:49,447
- It's just a normal store. - It's a normal store.

466
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:52,156
- But you start to suspect it. - It's just a normal store.

467
00:15:52,157 --> 00:15:54,317
- It's just a normal store. - But we don't know.

468
00:15:54,318 --> 00:15:55,928
(Decorated with butter snacks?)

469
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:58,358
(Butter pig characters...)

470
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:00,997
(and butter-related items)

471
00:16:01,667 --> 00:16:03,967
(A pork belly place covered in butter)

472
00:16:03,968 --> 00:16:06,237
(Is this place real?)

473
00:16:06,938 --> 00:16:09,567
- But the butter... - The butter...

474
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:11,277
The butter pork belly...

475
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,438
- I am curious about it. - Yes.

476
00:16:13,537 --> 00:16:15,708
- Isn't that so much fat? - It is so much fat.

477
00:16:15,907 --> 00:16:18,347
- Is it okay with so much fat? - Seriously.

478
00:16:18,348 --> 00:16:19,947
I'm curious about how it tastes.

479
00:16:19,948 --> 00:16:22,088
- We should order, then. - I guess we shake this.

480
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:23,616
Oh, yes.

481
00:16:23,617 --> 00:16:25,417
(Excuse me, sir.)

482
00:16:25,688 --> 00:16:27,257
(The bell rings.)

483
00:16:27,358 --> 00:16:29,958
- Hello. Welcome. - Hello.

484
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:33,057
- You're an actress, right? - Pardon?

485
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:34,198
I think you're an actress.

486
00:16:34,728 --> 00:16:35,828
I have good instincts.

487
00:16:36,267 --> 00:16:37,267
(The baseless interrogation by the newcomer)

488
00:16:37,268 --> 00:16:38,568
- Hey, but... - Kyung Pyo...

489
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:40,067
(Trying not to laugh)

490
00:16:40,068 --> 00:16:41,708
We're looking for a fake,

491
00:16:42,137 --> 00:16:43,707
but asking like that... Sorry.

492
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:46,337
- It's okay. - That's the nature of the show.

493
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,307
- It's because I'm hungry. - We have to suspect everything.

494
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:49,308
We're sorry.

495
00:16:49,507 --> 00:16:50,708
For how long have you been running this store?

496
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:52,718
It's been 1 year and 6 months.

497
00:16:53,777 --> 00:16:55,746
How did you start this place?

498
00:16:55,747 --> 00:16:57,857
I used to be a patissier.

499
00:16:57,858 --> 00:16:59,987
- I see. - She does have that vibe.

500
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:02,357
In other countries, they often use butter...

501
00:17:02,358 --> 00:17:04,157
to age beef.

502
00:17:05,527 --> 00:17:09,626
(Butter is often used for grilling steaks.)

503
00:17:09,627 --> 00:17:12,598
But it's not really done with pork in Korea yet.

504
00:17:12,897 --> 00:17:15,107
- What should we... - What should we eat?

505
00:17:15,108 --> 00:17:16,267
We should try...

506
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:17,637
- the butter pork belly, right? - Right, you ought to.

507
00:17:17,738 --> 00:17:18,738
- Butter. - Butter.

508
00:17:18,739 --> 00:17:21,377
- Butter. Thank you. - I'll prepare butter pork belly.

509
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,548
The "I love butter..."

510
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,518
(Doubtful)

511
00:17:29,887 --> 00:17:31,317
(From the hat to the T-shirt, there's too much love for butter?)

512
00:17:31,318 --> 00:17:34,588
(Keeping his eyes on her)

513
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:37,588
- It's too obvious. - It's obvious. And also,

514
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:40,696
the butter-aged pork belly is the only item with butter in it.

515
00:17:40,697 --> 00:17:42,297
- Exactly. - And there's butter soy sauce...

516
00:17:42,298 --> 00:17:43,866
and egg rice at the bottom.

517
00:17:43,867 --> 00:17:45,196
That's a common dish.

518
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:47,666
- Other places have this too. - Right.

519
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:48,707
- It is a basic dish. - Right?

520
00:17:49,238 --> 00:17:50,966
(They're crazy about butter, )

521
00:17:50,967 --> 00:17:52,707
(but there aren't many butter dishes?)

522
00:17:53,377 --> 00:17:56,407
Can the floor get this sticky after just a year and a half?

523
00:17:56,877 --> 00:17:59,518
(They were even doubting the floor. Right then...)

524
00:17:59,917 --> 00:18:01,047
(Oh, my goodness!)

525
00:18:01,048 --> 00:18:02,187
What is this?

526
00:18:03,788 --> 00:18:05,617
- Oh, my goodness. - What is this?

527
00:18:09,187 --> 00:18:11,298
(Oh, my goodness...)

528
00:18:12,098 --> 00:18:14,998
(Astounded)

529
00:18:15,197 --> 00:18:16,867
- Oh, my goodness. - What is this?

530
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:23,738
(The first trendy place, butter)

531
00:18:25,108 --> 00:18:27,436
I've developed our butter-aged pork belly...

532
00:18:27,437 --> 00:18:30,207
for the past four years.

533
00:18:30,548 --> 00:18:33,676
I think I used about 40kg...

534
00:18:33,677 --> 00:18:36,187
of butter every month.

535
00:18:36,447 --> 00:18:39,257
I thought pork belly and butter together...

536
00:18:39,258 --> 00:18:41,758
would really maximize the flavors.

537
00:18:42,028 --> 00:18:44,828
To make the butter even more flavorful,

538
00:18:46,098 --> 00:18:47,827
I'm going to add salt and wine.

539
00:18:47,828 --> 00:18:51,197
(Adding salt and wine to the butter based on her patissier experience)

540
00:18:51,498 --> 00:18:54,338
I take full pork belly the size of six palms,

541
00:18:55,308 --> 00:18:56,837
put butter on top...

542
00:18:56,838 --> 00:18:57,838
(A method of applying butter and aging it as is)

543
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:01,137
I'm using a wet-aging method that blocks out oxygen.

544
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:04,107
I thought that aging process...

545
00:19:04,108 --> 00:19:05,917
would maximize the flavors.

546
00:19:06,917 --> 00:19:08,588
(After 3 days of aging)

547
00:19:09,018 --> 00:19:11,387
At first, they say, "Isn't this too oily?"

548
00:19:11,588 --> 00:19:15,258
"With the butter and pork belly, I think there's too much fat."

549
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:17,186
But it's not as oily as you'd expect.

550
00:19:17,187 --> 00:19:20,197
It's very clean tasting and has a full flavor.

551
00:19:20,957 --> 00:19:22,997
Everyone. In a hidden alley of Hipjiro,

552
00:19:22,998 --> 00:19:25,197
you can find the first butter-aged pork belly in Korea.

553
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:28,067
Many people come after watching...

554
00:19:28,068 --> 00:19:30,367
famous YouTubers or TikTokers.

555
00:19:31,108 --> 00:19:32,437
An acquaintance recommended this place to me.

556
00:19:33,207 --> 00:19:35,608
(Google search, Acquaintance recommendations)

557
00:19:35,907 --> 00:19:38,446
We have monthly sales of about 80,000 dollars.

558
00:19:38,447 --> 00:19:39,947
(They reached 80,000 dollars in monthly sales.)

559
00:19:40,278 --> 00:19:42,988
Sixth Sense members, is this place real?

560
00:19:44,887 --> 00:19:47,487
When you order butter-aged pork belly,

561
00:19:47,488 --> 00:19:49,527
- we show you this... - This looks way too fatty.

562
00:19:49,528 --> 00:19:51,027
- This is... - Wait.

563
00:19:51,028 --> 00:19:53,727
- I think the arts team there... - Wait.

564
00:19:53,998 --> 00:19:56,097
I think the arts team made this tower over there.

565
00:19:56,098 --> 00:19:57,667
Can we eat this?

566
00:19:58,467 --> 00:19:59,568
Artery spike...

567
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:01,906
- If you look closely, the butter... - Yes.

568
00:20:01,907 --> 00:20:04,136
- Each chunk... - It's a little bit.

569
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:05,807
There isn't too much in here.

570
00:20:05,808 --> 00:20:07,078
- Actually... Yes. - In between.

571
00:20:07,677 --> 00:20:11,377
(The way it's piled, it looks like a chunk of butter, )

572
00:20:12,318 --> 00:20:16,117
(But if you look closely, the butter is only on the outside.)

573
00:20:16,217 --> 00:20:17,787
It's about the same amount...

574
00:20:17,788 --> 00:20:19,317
- Oh, you're right. - that's in one salt bread.

575
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:20,956
- Then it must be good. - Really?

576
00:20:20,957 --> 00:20:23,287
- It's not too fatty. - Looking at the outside,

577
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:25,027
- all of this looks like butter. - Right.

578
00:20:25,028 --> 00:20:27,858
- Oh, you're right. - Yes, there's only a little.

579
00:20:28,167 --> 00:20:30,768
Young people these days like butter.

580
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:33,396
Young people would like the look of this.

581
00:20:33,397 --> 00:20:35,706
You'd want to take a picture of it.

582
00:20:35,707 --> 00:20:37,067
- This is so surprising. - You're right.

583
00:20:37,068 --> 00:20:38,308
- Should I take a picture? - I want to try this.

584
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,778
- Yes. - We should get a picture of this.

585
00:20:40,937 --> 00:20:44,147
(City Tour, Found a trendy place, Mimi was here)

586
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:47,116
- Here it is. - There are instructions.

587
00:20:47,117 --> 00:20:48,216
There are instructions on how to eat this.

588
00:20:48,217 --> 00:20:49,347
Oh, the letters are small.

589
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:50,387
I'll read it.

590
00:20:50,988 --> 00:20:53,117
(Casually confessing her bad eyesight due to age)

591
00:20:53,358 --> 00:20:55,626
Okay. Don't be surprised.

592
00:20:55,627 --> 00:20:57,957
- Don't be surprised. - This is just for fashion.

593
00:20:58,528 --> 00:20:59,858
(Peekaboo)

594
00:21:00,397 --> 00:21:01,627
- Don't be surprised. - It has no function at all.

595
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:03,667
It's called "slow focusing."

596
00:21:03,768 --> 00:21:05,667
- It's good with grilled vegetables. - Please read it...

597
00:21:05,867 --> 00:21:07,797
- for us. - For the butter flavor,

598
00:21:07,798 --> 00:21:11,307
eat the first piece of pork belly with grilled vegetables.

599
00:21:11,308 --> 00:21:13,838
Eat the first piece of pork cheek with salt.

600
00:21:14,078 --> 00:21:16,077
- After that, eat as you want. - I'm so curious...

601
00:21:16,078 --> 00:21:17,348
- Oh, really? - about how this will taste.

602
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:20,216
It's like...

603
00:21:20,217 --> 00:21:21,686
- I'll put it on the grill now. - steam from the bath...

604
00:21:21,687 --> 00:21:23,147
early in the morning...

605
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:26,617
Steam from the bath...

606
00:21:28,657 --> 00:21:31,287
- Oh, my. - This looks...

607
00:21:31,288 --> 00:21:32,997
(Laughing happily)

608
00:21:32,998 --> 00:21:35,366
This makes me want to post on social media.

609
00:21:35,367 --> 00:21:36,827
We have to post this.

610
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:38,166
(This makes you want to make a social media account.)

611
00:21:38,167 --> 00:21:39,238
I want to eat that.

612
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:42,267
- It's like salt bread. The smell. - You're right.

613
00:21:42,268 --> 00:21:43,268
The smell is crazy.

614
00:21:44,338 --> 00:21:46,578
It smells so savory.

615
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:48,706
I think the savoriness will be maximized,

616
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:50,278
but I can't tell how much.

617
00:21:50,947 --> 00:21:52,947
- Oh, my. - This is crazy.

618
00:21:53,377 --> 00:21:55,917
- This makes you want to post. - I want to.

619
00:21:56,417 --> 00:21:58,788
If I used social media, I would definitely take a picture.

620
00:21:59,157 --> 00:22:00,587
This is strange.

621
00:22:00,588 --> 00:22:01,627
(You can't help but take a picture of this.)

622
00:22:01,828 --> 00:22:04,588
- The smell... The smell is crazy. - The smell.

623
00:22:05,397 --> 00:22:06,456
Oh, gosh.

624
00:22:06,457 --> 00:22:07,727
(Laughing)

625
00:22:08,467 --> 00:22:09,497
(Laughing at his sincere reaction)

626
00:22:09,498 --> 00:22:10,568
Are you happy?

627
00:22:11,397 --> 00:22:13,737
Kyung Pyo is happy.

628
00:22:13,738 --> 00:22:15,768
Pork belly in the morning.

629
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:19,308
- Oh, look at the oil dripping out. - Look at the oil dripping out.

630
00:22:19,578 --> 00:22:22,608
What a waste, isn't it? I want to pour it back on here.

631
00:22:23,078 --> 00:22:24,146
(The butter is draining out like a waterfall.)

632
00:22:24,147 --> 00:22:26,676
The oil dripping out here...

633
00:22:26,677 --> 00:22:28,048
It is butter.

634
00:22:28,417 --> 00:22:30,386
But when you normally grill pork belly,

635
00:22:30,387 --> 00:22:32,716
you need to grill at least two pans to get this much oil.

636
00:22:32,717 --> 00:22:34,927
- You're right. - Right?

637
00:22:35,427 --> 00:22:38,498
(It's already golden brown.)

638
00:22:40,127 --> 00:22:44,167
(Flip it over at the perfect timing.)

639
00:22:44,627 --> 00:22:47,097
- This smells so good. - Oh, the butter in the middle!

640
00:22:47,098 --> 00:22:48,738
(Surprised)

641
00:22:49,008 --> 00:22:51,307
- This smells so good. - Oh, the butter in the middle!

642
00:22:51,308 --> 00:22:52,608
(Surprised)

643
00:22:54,808 --> 00:22:56,048
I love it.

644
00:22:57,508 --> 00:22:58,976
- It's like cheese. - Yes.

645
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:00,377
(Mimi was surprised by the butter here.)

646
00:23:01,687 --> 00:23:06,387
(The butter melts and starts to look like cheese.)

647
00:23:06,687 --> 00:23:07,687
(Oh, my.)

648
00:23:08,187 --> 00:23:09,187
This looks delicious.

649
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:12,397
The outside is crispy like the outside of salt bread.

650
00:23:13,098 --> 00:23:16,196
We almost fry it on this hot cast iron pan.

651
00:23:16,197 --> 00:23:18,097
(The key is to almost fry it on a hot cast iron pan.)

652
00:23:18,098 --> 00:23:19,568
That makes it really delicious.

653
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:22,538
- I can already imagine it. - I think it'll be tasty.

654
00:23:24,568 --> 00:23:26,477
What I like about this...

655
00:23:26,677 --> 00:23:29,476
Normally, when you grill meat, the oil from the meat gets stuck.

656
00:23:29,477 --> 00:23:31,146
- But the butter melts quickly... - Oh, you're right.

657
00:23:31,147 --> 00:23:33,078
And pushes the oil down with it.

658
00:23:33,177 --> 00:23:35,887
- That's exactly it. - It's not sticking on the pan.

659
00:23:37,288 --> 00:23:38,686
Oh, that's really nice.

660
00:23:38,687 --> 00:23:40,058
(It's so neat because it doesn't get stuck on the pan.)

661
00:23:40,617 --> 00:23:44,058
(The pork belly is now crispy on both sides.)

662
00:23:44,957 --> 00:23:48,298
(Cut it into thick pieces, )

663
00:23:50,227 --> 00:23:53,897
(and coat every side with butter.)

664
00:23:54,197 --> 00:23:57,137
- Oh, my. She's really a master. - This looks delicious.

665
00:23:57,308 --> 00:23:59,177
Because the pan is so hot,

666
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:02,247
- you need to flip it quickly. - You're right.

667
00:24:02,248 --> 00:24:04,507
If you take too long while talking, you can burn it.

668
00:24:04,508 --> 00:24:05,577
- You're right. - She has the aura of a master.

669
00:24:05,578 --> 00:24:08,446
- She's so good at grilling meat. - She has the aura of a master.

670
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:09,487
The one hand behind your back...

671
00:24:09,488 --> 00:24:10,517
- Exactly. - makes me trust you.

672
00:24:10,518 --> 00:24:12,358
(The meat grilling skills of a master)

673
00:24:13,417 --> 00:24:16,328
- Oh, my. - Do you open at 5:30pm?

674
00:24:16,427 --> 00:24:18,726
- We're open from 5pm to 10pm. - To 10pm?

675
00:24:18,727 --> 00:24:20,957
- How many rounds do you do? - Until 10pm?

676
00:24:21,667 --> 00:24:23,696
When we're busy, about four rounds.

677
00:24:23,697 --> 00:24:25,337
- Four rounds? - That's a lot.

678
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:26,937
Your sales must be quite high.

679
00:24:27,137 --> 00:24:28,637
What do you exactly want to ask?

680
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:30,568
About a franchise.

681
00:24:31,907 --> 00:24:33,008
A franchise?

682
00:24:33,078 --> 00:24:35,477
- I like it. The aging method too. - Come on.

683
00:24:35,977 --> 00:24:38,818
Because she's always running businesses...

684
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:41,117
I was wondering why she was asking about that.

685
00:24:41,217 --> 00:24:42,817
With a steady stream of customers, you could make quite a lot.

686
00:24:42,818 --> 00:24:44,288
You could.

687
00:24:44,548 --> 00:24:47,157
- Can you patent this? - Yes, I actually have...

688
00:24:47,387 --> 00:24:50,058
the patent for this.

689
00:24:50,887 --> 00:24:53,227
- Really? - For this process.

690
00:24:53,498 --> 00:24:55,328
What sauces do we have here?

691
00:24:55,598 --> 00:24:57,327
That's the yakisoba sauce.

692
00:24:57,328 --> 00:24:59,667
The one next to that are breadcrumbs I cooked myself.

693
00:24:59,768 --> 00:25:01,636
- I see. - She used to be a bbatissier.

694
00:25:01,637 --> 00:25:02,707
You're right.

695
00:25:03,167 --> 00:25:04,568
- "Bbatissier." - Yes, bbatissier.

696
00:25:04,937 --> 00:25:06,337
- It's all cooked now. - I think we can eat it now.

697
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,376
- Should we eat? - Yes.

698
00:25:07,377 --> 00:25:09,147
(Pork belly with a buttery aroma, How does it taste?)

699
00:25:09,308 --> 00:25:12,216
- Have it with a bit of salt. - Okay.

700
00:25:12,217 --> 00:25:13,548
I think that'll be too salty.

701
00:25:15,387 --> 00:25:16,447
Just a little.

702
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:19,716
- Eat the way she tells you to. - I wanted the breadcrumbs.

703
00:25:19,717 --> 00:25:20,757
(Childish Yu, A very picky eater)

704
00:25:20,758 --> 00:25:22,258
- Seriously. - I wanted the breadcrumbs.

705
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:24,656
(My favorite person is cute, even when he's being picky.)

706
00:25:24,657 --> 00:25:26,157
- You're sensitive about that. - Yes.

707
00:25:26,657 --> 00:25:28,528
- Just the first piece. - Really? Ma'am.

708
00:25:29,598 --> 00:25:30,926
I don't like salt that much.

709
00:25:30,927 --> 00:25:33,467
(Will the complaining Childish Yu like it?)

710
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,867
(Truly liking it)

711
00:25:42,947 --> 00:25:43,947
(Oh, gosh)

712
00:25:44,548 --> 00:25:46,147
(Oh, my)

713
00:25:47,318 --> 00:25:48,348
(Oh, my)

714
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:51,018
- Gosh, this is so good. - Gosh.

715
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:55,088
(Mimi takes a bite too.)

716
00:25:56,558 --> 00:25:57,987
It tastes like bread.

717
00:25:57,988 --> 00:25:59,197
(The pork is so rich in flavor that it tastes like buttery bread.)

718
00:25:59,498 --> 00:26:00,498
(Sniffing)

719
00:26:00,697 --> 00:26:03,027
(Gochelin Kyung Pyo breathes in the smell first.)

720
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:05,538
(He takes a cautious bite.)

721
00:26:06,897 --> 00:26:08,098
(Gosh)

722
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,507
You're so great at grilling.

723
00:26:14,508 --> 00:26:16,108
- She really is. - Yes.

724
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:19,417
- This is so good. - It's so good that I'm speechless.

725
00:26:19,748 --> 00:26:22,147
- His reaction is genuine. - This is really good.

726
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:23,848
The flavor is very toasty,

727
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:25,887
and it's crispy on the outside while juicy on the inside.

728
00:26:26,417 --> 00:26:27,857
It's so good.

729
00:26:27,858 --> 00:26:29,087
It's not too greasy.

730
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:30,088
- It's not greasy at all. - Right?

731
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:31,857
The flavor is...

732
00:26:31,858 --> 00:26:33,057
- so toasty. - Yes.

733
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:34,058
It really is.

734
00:26:34,157 --> 00:26:36,126
The beauty is in how simple the flavor is.

735
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:37,167
It's so toasty.

736
00:26:37,427 --> 00:26:38,837
(Dipping the pork in bread crumbs)

737
00:26:38,838 --> 00:26:40,537
It's all about creativity.

738
00:26:40,538 --> 00:26:42,467
- Gosh, this is so good. - Gosh.

739
00:26:43,907 --> 00:26:44,907
This is...

740
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:47,137
(Gosh)

741
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:48,277
(Hurry up and try this.)

742
00:26:48,278 --> 00:26:50,747
Obviously, adults would love this, but kids would...

743
00:26:50,748 --> 00:26:51,748
(The flavor is so beautiful that it has Mimi pointing at thin air.)

744
00:26:51,749 --> 00:26:55,146
Please try this with breadcrumbs.

745
00:26:55,147 --> 00:26:56,717
You have to try it with the bread crumbs.

746
00:26:57,048 --> 00:26:59,186
I wanted to try the bread crumbs, but she gave me salt.

747
00:26:59,187 --> 00:27:01,116
(Annoyed)

748
00:27:01,117 --> 00:27:02,827
You're still...

749
00:27:02,828 --> 00:27:04,156
(Stop talking about the salt!)

750
00:27:04,157 --> 00:27:06,726
He's going to talk about it 100 times.

751
00:27:06,727 --> 00:27:08,767
He has 92 more times left.

752
00:27:08,768 --> 00:27:10,697
He has to talk about it 92 more times.

753
00:27:11,397 --> 00:27:12,696
- I'm going to have nightmares. - I'm sorry.

754
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:14,298
I hope you don't have any misunderstandings.

755
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,167
So this is what Kyung Eun has to deal with.

756
00:27:18,707 --> 00:27:20,376
- All the complaining. - She'll be watching this on TV...

757
00:27:20,377 --> 00:27:21,636
She'll be watching this on TV and agreeing with you.

758
00:27:21,637 --> 00:27:22,707
Right.

759
00:27:24,248 --> 00:27:26,847
(Gosh, the breadcrumbs.)

760
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,588
Dipping the pork in breadcrumbs...

761
00:27:28,917 --> 00:27:30,047
makes it taste like pork cutlet.

762
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:31,587
- Yes. - Gosh, you're right.

763
00:27:31,588 --> 00:27:34,087
This is practically a pork cutlet.

764
00:27:34,088 --> 00:27:35,186
It's so crispy.

765
00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:36,686
And it's stir-fried, not deep-fried.

766
00:27:36,687 --> 00:27:38,087
The bread crumbs aren't greasy.

767
00:27:38,088 --> 00:27:39,197
That's right.

768
00:27:39,897 --> 00:27:41,758
- This does taste like pork cutlet. - Right?

769
00:27:43,098 --> 00:27:45,538
(Taking a huge bite)

770
00:27:46,568 --> 00:27:48,437
- This is so good. - Excuse me.

771
00:27:48,738 --> 00:27:51,507
(This man is in a unique pose.)

772
00:27:51,508 --> 00:27:53,137
(Eyes wide open)

773
00:27:53,308 --> 00:27:55,347
- This is... - Gosh, what is this?

774
00:27:55,348 --> 00:27:57,906
Obviously, adults would love this, but kids would...

775
00:27:57,907 --> 00:27:58,977
(His eyes are full of love.)

776
00:27:59,518 --> 00:28:01,946
(It's hot.)

777
00:28:01,947 --> 00:28:03,186
(It's scorching.)

778
00:28:03,187 --> 00:28:04,787
(Taking an enormous bite)

779
00:28:04,788 --> 00:28:05,917
(It's so hot that he's laughing.)

780
00:28:06,957 --> 00:28:08,787
The flavor is...

781
00:28:08,788 --> 00:28:10,087
(He's eating...)

782
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:11,557
Butter is really nice.

783
00:28:11,558 --> 00:28:12,697
(and eating some more.)

784
00:28:13,098 --> 00:28:15,098
- This is unlike any other. - It's perfect.

785
00:28:15,298 --> 00:28:16,666
(He's doing his best to find out the truth.)

786
00:28:16,667 --> 00:28:18,867
The yakisoba sauce is a bit spicy.

787
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,267
- It's good. - It makes the pork...

788
00:28:20,268 --> 00:28:21,268
- Yes. - even better.

789
00:28:21,397 --> 00:28:22,936
(Mimi found a bowl of vegetables.)

790
00:28:22,937 --> 00:28:24,866
Should we put this on the pan?

791
00:28:24,867 --> 00:28:27,277
Grilling the vegetables will turn this into actual yakisoba.

792
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:28,976
- Gosh. - The vegetables will do it.

793
00:28:28,977 --> 00:28:29,977
I'll pour in the sauce.

794
00:28:30,677 --> 00:28:31,677
(This isn't her first barbecue.)

795
00:28:31,678 --> 00:28:33,348
Like this.

796
00:28:34,518 --> 00:28:36,117
- This is great. - Gosh, Mimi.

797
00:28:36,518 --> 00:28:37,518
Thank you.

798
00:28:38,187 --> 00:28:39,887
We're not filming. We're having dinner after work.

799
00:28:41,258 --> 00:28:44,626
Hey, after this, we're going to an ice cream place.

800
00:28:44,627 --> 00:28:47,757
(We're having a party!)

801
00:28:47,758 --> 00:28:50,967
- That's insane. - That's amazing.

802
00:28:51,167 --> 00:28:52,598
Any meticulousness...

803
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,837
we had in our heads is gone.

804
00:28:54,838 --> 00:28:56,008
Gosh.

805
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:59,507
It's hard to be suspicious of this place.

806
00:28:59,508 --> 00:29:00,777
- It's so good. - It's so good.

807
00:29:00,778 --> 00:29:03,777
Above all, the owner is so professional.

808
00:29:03,778 --> 00:29:04,778
Right.

809
00:29:05,377 --> 00:29:06,446
Excuse me.

810
00:29:06,447 --> 00:29:08,617
I know that not all of the dishes here have butter in them,

811
00:29:08,887 --> 00:29:10,116
but what are the dishes that do?

812
00:29:10,117 --> 00:29:12,757
The cheonggukjang with rice is also made with butter.

813
00:29:12,758 --> 00:29:14,716
- It's very smooth. - We'll have that too, then.

814
00:29:14,717 --> 00:29:15,857
- Right. - Okay.

815
00:29:15,858 --> 00:29:17,287
Here's your cheonggukjang with rice.

816
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:18,426
- Goodness. - Gosh, thank you.

817
00:29:18,427 --> 00:29:19,626
I'll add the butter now.

818
00:29:19,627 --> 00:29:20,696
You're adding in the butter here?

819
00:29:20,697 --> 00:29:21,910
(More butter?)

820
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:23,396
Here's your cheonggukjang with rice.

821
00:29:23,397 --> 00:29:24,566
- Goodness. - Gosh, thank you.

822
00:29:24,567 --> 00:29:25,695
I'll add the butter now.

823
00:29:25,696 --> 00:29:26,866
You're adding in the butter here?

824
00:29:26,867 --> 00:29:28,596
(More butter?)

825
00:29:28,597 --> 00:29:31,037
(The butter-obsessed owner has a secret dish.)

826
00:29:31,307 --> 00:29:34,236
(Cheonggukjang with rice and butter)

827
00:29:34,676 --> 00:29:38,277
(After stir-frying the end bits of pork belly, )

828
00:29:38,377 --> 00:29:39,377
(ssamjang, )

829
00:29:39,378 --> 00:29:40,475
(cheonggukjang, )

830
00:29:40,476 --> 00:29:41,816
(gochujang, )

831
00:29:41,817 --> 00:29:43,215
(chili powder, )

832
00:29:43,216 --> 00:29:45,516
(soy sauce, sugar, and MSG are added.)

833
00:29:47,156 --> 00:29:51,287
(Everything is mixed and stir-fried together.)

834
00:29:52,756 --> 00:29:55,827
(The pot is then filled with water and stirred, so nothing sticks.)

835
00:29:57,297 --> 00:29:59,965
A spoonful of butter is added...

836
00:29:59,966 --> 00:30:01,465
to make the flavor more toasty...

837
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,235
and the texture of the stew more creamy.

838
00:30:04,236 --> 00:30:08,877
(The cheonggukjang with rice and butter is toasty and creamy.)

839
00:30:09,277 --> 00:30:11,147
- Are you putting that butter in? - Yes.

840
00:30:11,377 --> 00:30:14,347
(There's one last spoonful of butter left.)

841
00:30:14,817 --> 00:30:16,716
This is butter? That's amazing.

842
00:30:17,617 --> 00:30:18,986
Gosh, what is this?

843
00:30:20,186 --> 00:30:21,886
- We have to melt the butter. - Yes.

844
00:30:21,887 --> 00:30:23,026
(They've never seen anything like...)

845
00:30:23,027 --> 00:30:24,127
(this cheonggukjang with rice and butter before.)

846
00:30:24,587 --> 00:30:25,655
Gosh, we'd have to...

847
00:30:25,656 --> 00:30:27,126
(Jae Seok thinks as he's stirring the stew.)

848
00:30:27,127 --> 00:30:29,726
be aware of fat circulating in our bloodstreams.

849
00:30:30,327 --> 00:30:32,596
We'll have to run laps after eating here.

850
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:34,265
But the food is that good.

851
00:30:34,266 --> 00:30:35,566
- Yes. - It's so good.

852
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:36,965
The food is very good.

853
00:30:36,966 --> 00:30:39,175
Butter isn't usually put in cheonggukjang, right?

854
00:30:39,176 --> 00:30:40,607
No, it's not.

855
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:43,175
- The butter went well with pork. - Try the soup.

856
00:30:43,176 --> 00:30:44,376
But what I'm currently feeling is that...

857
00:30:44,377 --> 00:30:46,716
putting butter in cheonggukjang is out of the question.

858
00:30:47,647 --> 00:30:51,347
(Is cheonggukjang with rice and butter a real dish here?)

859
00:30:51,617 --> 00:30:53,516
- I'll take the first bite. - Yes, go ahead.

860
00:30:55,216 --> 00:30:56,455
I gave you a little bit of the soup.

861
00:30:56,456 --> 00:30:59,096
(He blows on his spoon to cool it down and then takes a bite.)

862
00:30:59,097 --> 00:31:00,597
(Smacking his lips)

863
00:31:02,597 --> 00:31:04,765
- What do you think? - The butter has a strong presence.

864
00:31:04,766 --> 00:31:06,066
- Really? - It lessens...

865
00:31:06,067 --> 00:31:07,366
the flavor of the cheonggukjang.

866
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:08,465
- I see. - Gosh.

867
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:09,536
(The butter softens the flavor of cheonggukjang.)

868
00:31:09,537 --> 00:31:12,435
I can still smell the unique scent of cheonggukjang like this.

869
00:31:12,436 --> 00:31:13,436
- Yes, but the flavor. - Mimi.

870
00:31:13,436 --> 00:31:14,436
I'll eat the flavor.

871
00:31:14,437 --> 00:31:16,346
Yes. Thank you.

872
00:31:16,347 --> 00:31:17,777
"Eat the flavor?"

873
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:19,975
I did realize my mistake.

874
00:31:19,976 --> 00:31:21,576
(I caught you.)

875
00:31:21,577 --> 00:31:23,946
I kept hoping to myself that you'd let it slide.

876
00:31:24,246 --> 00:31:26,255
Gosh. You...

877
00:31:26,256 --> 00:31:28,215
- didn't let it slide, as expected. - We don't let things slide.

878
00:31:28,216 --> 00:31:29,225
I knew you'd point it out.

879
00:31:29,226 --> 00:31:30,226
Right.

880
00:31:30,227 --> 00:31:31,426
We always point out each other's mistakes.

881
00:31:32,127 --> 00:31:33,796
- There's rice on the bottom. - Yes, there's rice.

882
00:31:33,797 --> 00:31:35,396
I'll give you some rice. Here.

883
00:31:35,397 --> 00:31:36,397
(Eun I tries to taste the flavor again.)

884
00:31:38,367 --> 00:31:39,637
Mimi, I'll give you some rice.

885
00:31:40,097 --> 00:31:42,096
- Let's see. - The soup is so good.

886
00:31:42,097 --> 00:31:43,905
I can taste the strong flavor of the butter as soon as it's in...

887
00:31:43,906 --> 00:31:45,136
- my mouth. - It's strong.

888
00:31:45,137 --> 00:31:46,376
(Gosh)

889
00:31:46,377 --> 00:31:48,037
How it smells...

890
00:31:48,436 --> 00:31:49,505
- and how it tastes... - The flavor is very different.

891
00:31:49,506 --> 00:31:50,506
- are completely different. - They're completely different.

892
00:31:50,507 --> 00:31:52,715
- Younger people would love this. - Yes.

893
00:31:52,716 --> 00:31:53,716
- Right. - There are lots of people...

894
00:31:53,717 --> 00:31:54,745
who don't like cheonggukjang stew.

895
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:55,985
- That's right. - Right.

896
00:31:55,986 --> 00:31:57,316
- I thought of that too. - Like him.

897
00:31:57,317 --> 00:31:58,445
Exactly.

898
00:31:58,446 --> 00:32:00,216
Of course, there are people who love cheonggukjang.

899
00:32:00,486 --> 00:32:02,786
But to be honest, it could be hard...

900
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:04,557
- Right. - to get into at first.

901
00:32:04,827 --> 00:32:07,955
(Childish Yu has a childish palate.)

902
00:32:07,956 --> 00:32:08,965
Gosh, this is really good.

903
00:32:08,966 --> 00:32:10,596
This is really good.

904
00:32:10,597 --> 00:32:11,896
(But the soup's toasty flavor is perfect for him.)

905
00:32:11,897 --> 00:32:14,235
It's tasty.

906
00:32:14,236 --> 00:32:16,537
- Yes, it's really good. - Gosh.

907
00:32:16,666 --> 00:32:17,736
This is good.

908
00:32:18,466 --> 00:32:20,735
It's tasty, right?

909
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,736
- Yes. - Gosh.

910
00:32:22,077 --> 00:32:24,475
Shouldn't we get a new bowl?

911
00:32:24,476 --> 00:32:25,476
- For the grease? - We should.

912
00:32:25,477 --> 00:32:27,675
- Excuse me, could you... - No, don't touch it.

913
00:32:27,676 --> 00:32:29,316
- It's probably hot. - I agree.

914
00:32:29,317 --> 00:32:32,046
Let's see how she sets us up with a new bowl.

915
00:32:32,047 --> 00:32:33,056
How sharp of you.

916
00:32:33,057 --> 00:32:35,317
I'm trying to do my job somehow.

917
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,386
- It's only because I have to. - He's not doing his job at all.

918
00:32:38,387 --> 00:32:39,897
- He's just eating. - This is so good.

919
00:32:40,527 --> 00:32:42,367
- This is very tasty. - Excuse me.

920
00:32:42,926 --> 00:32:43,926
- And this is... - Yes?

921
00:32:43,927 --> 00:32:46,036
Could you give us a new bowl for the grease?

922
00:32:46,037 --> 00:32:48,465
- This is about to... - I don't think it will overflow.

923
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:49,866
You don't need a new one.

924
00:32:49,867 --> 00:32:51,536
- We don't? - Will the grease from the pork...

925
00:32:51,537 --> 00:32:52,606
fill that bowl and stop before overflowing?

926
00:32:52,607 --> 00:32:53,935
- Yes. - Gosh. I see.

927
00:32:53,936 --> 00:32:56,246
(Goodness)

928
00:32:56,577 --> 00:32:58,576
What is it? Are you offended?

929
00:32:58,577 --> 00:32:59,577
No.

930
00:33:00,976 --> 00:33:02,816
Why would I be offended?

931
00:33:02,817 --> 00:33:04,015
Why would I be offended?

932
00:33:04,016 --> 00:33:06,755
I'm working right now. I'm tuning into my sixth sense.

933
00:33:06,756 --> 00:33:08,155
You weren't tuning into the annoyance we feel with age?

934
00:33:08,156 --> 00:33:11,627
No, I wasn't. I was tuning into my sixth sense. I'm working here.

935
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,396
Your friend is working right now.

936
00:33:13,397 --> 00:33:14,857
- If you say so. - Nobody else is working.

937
00:33:15,297 --> 00:33:16,297
I'm the only one...

938
00:33:17,397 --> 00:33:18,397
I was just...

939
00:33:18,726 --> 00:33:20,336
thinking to myself.

940
00:33:20,337 --> 00:33:21,595
- This might sound far-fetched, - I get it.

941
00:33:21,596 --> 00:33:24,135
But if she had rehearsed this, she would have come to our table.

942
00:33:24,136 --> 00:33:26,305
But she just glanced over before saying we didn't need a new bowl.

943
00:33:26,306 --> 00:33:27,677
- That felt so natural. - Natural. Right.

944
00:33:28,337 --> 00:33:29,377
The way I see it,

945
00:33:30,206 --> 00:33:31,546
whether the dishes have butter in them, or not,

946
00:33:31,547 --> 00:33:33,076
this place is definitely a pork belly restaurant.

947
00:33:33,547 --> 00:33:35,015
- For sure. - Yes.

948
00:33:35,016 --> 00:33:36,615
- The vibe and the plates. - The vibe.

949
00:33:36,616 --> 00:33:39,556
- That's possible. - The butter part could be fake.

950
00:33:39,857 --> 00:33:42,225
But overall,

951
00:33:42,226 --> 00:33:43,426
- the food is good. - The food is good.

952
00:33:43,427 --> 00:33:45,055
- The food is so good. - And the place feels real.

953
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:46,426
If it is real, I want to come here again.

954
00:33:46,427 --> 00:33:47,526
- Right. - I want to come here again.

955
00:33:47,527 --> 00:33:48,527
- Yes. - Gosh.

956
00:33:48,528 --> 00:33:51,066
- This is so hard. - Yes, it's hard.

957
00:33:51,067 --> 00:33:52,067
(The butter-centered interior design is a little too much.)

958
00:33:52,068 --> 00:33:53,095
(There aren't a lot of dishes with butter.)

959
00:33:53,096 --> 00:33:54,936
(The dishes are so good that they go beyond any of their suspicions.)

960
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:58,607
(They're about to get going for their next stop.)

961
00:33:58,866 --> 00:34:00,575
Wait, are they patrons?

962
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,606
Patrons?

963
00:34:01,607 --> 00:34:03,075
This isn't their regular hours,

964
00:34:03,076 --> 00:34:04,975
but the place is open because of us.

965
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:06,076
There are patrons here.

966
00:34:06,616 --> 00:34:08,345
- Really? - Are they really patrons?

967
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:09,346
- They're eating. - They're...

968
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:10,745
- But why... - I think they're foreigners.

969
00:34:10,746 --> 00:34:12,146
But we said they couldn't.

970
00:34:12,147 --> 00:34:14,156
- She said they usually open at 5pm. - Did she just let them in?

971
00:34:14,157 --> 00:34:15,257
Are you Japanese?

972
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:16,725
No.

973
00:34:16,726 --> 00:34:18,626
- Gosh. - Kyung Pyo.

974
00:34:18,627 --> 00:34:21,156
- Gosh, I'm sorry. - We're sorry.

975
00:34:21,157 --> 00:34:22,796
- Why would you... - I'm sorry.

976
00:34:22,797 --> 00:34:24,196
- They're Koreans. - Hey,

977
00:34:24,197 --> 00:34:26,066
- on what grounds did you say that? - He said, "Are you Japanese?"

978
00:34:26,067 --> 00:34:27,435
- Well... - He said, "Are you Japanese?"

979
00:34:27,436 --> 00:34:28,797
You're so funny.

980
00:34:29,166 --> 00:34:30,865
- Is this your first time here? - Yes.

981
00:34:30,866 --> 00:34:32,435
- You came in because it was open? - Yes.

982
00:34:32,436 --> 00:34:33,906
- We were hungry. - I see.

983
00:34:33,907 --> 00:34:35,877
I apologize for the mistake I made earlier.

984
00:34:36,377 --> 00:34:37,646
- We apologize. - You both had cute outfits on.

985
00:34:37,647 --> 00:34:39,147
He's so funny.

986
00:34:39,476 --> 00:34:41,177
- Enjoy your food. - Hey, Kyung Pyo.

987
00:34:41,717 --> 00:34:43,285
You said, "Are you Japanese?"

988
00:34:43,286 --> 00:34:44,286
It wasn't intentional.

989
00:34:44,817 --> 00:34:46,716
- She said, "No." - You said, "Are you Japanese?"

990
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:48,785
For me,

991
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:51,587
the overall vibe of the place...

992
00:34:51,886 --> 00:34:53,325
feels slightly random.

993
00:34:53,326 --> 00:34:55,426
- That phrase feels so weird to me. - On top of that, when we walked...

994
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:58,127
Why does "only place in the world" suddenly sound so awkward?

995
00:34:58,697 --> 00:35:00,337
That phrase, "only place in the world."

996
00:35:00,636 --> 00:35:04,466
The dishes seemed legit, though.

997
00:35:04,467 --> 00:35:07,536
Since we have to find out which one is fake,

998
00:35:07,737 --> 00:35:09,345
- We keep feeling suspicious. - we keep feeling suspicious.

999
00:35:09,346 --> 00:35:11,206
That's right. This is awful.

1000
00:35:11,407 --> 00:35:12,546
We enjoyed the food.

1001
00:35:12,547 --> 00:35:13,615
- Now everything seems suspicious. - Everything.

1002
00:35:13,616 --> 00:35:14,677
This is bad.

1003
00:35:14,817 --> 00:35:16,046
I feel like I might get morbid jealousy.

1004
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:17,285
("I feel like I might get morbid jealousy.")

1005
00:35:17,286 --> 00:35:18,385
- Morbid jealousy? - Morbid jealousy.

1006
00:35:18,386 --> 00:35:19,955
Is that the correct term to use right now?

1007
00:35:19,956 --> 00:35:20,956
- Morbid jealousy? - You don't...

1008
00:35:20,956 --> 00:35:21,956
have anyone to be jealous of.

1009
00:35:21,957 --> 00:35:23,627
- What do you mean morbid jealousy? - She said "morbid jealousy."

1010
00:35:23,886 --> 00:35:25,357
She meant she's morbidly suspicious.

1011
00:35:25,826 --> 00:35:26,955
That's what I wanted to say.

1012
00:35:26,956 --> 00:35:28,757
- That's it, right? - Gosh.

1013
00:35:28,897 --> 00:35:30,995
- Mimi is so funny. - You understood me.

1014
00:35:30,996 --> 00:35:33,297
(He understood me well.)

1015
00:35:34,197 --> 00:35:36,166
We know where we're heading next, right?

1016
00:35:36,436 --> 00:35:38,507
To get ice cream.

1017
00:35:38,837 --> 00:35:39,837
There's a market here.

1018
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:42,177
- Hey, let's... - That's nice.

1019
00:35:42,377 --> 00:35:43,407
Look around.

1020
00:35:43,746 --> 00:35:45,576
Inhyeon Traditional Market.

1021
00:35:46,846 --> 00:35:48,216
I've never been to an alley like this.

1022
00:35:48,217 --> 00:35:49,316
- Really? - Yes.

1023
00:35:49,317 --> 00:35:50,615
(Inhyeon Traditional Market)

1024
00:35:50,616 --> 00:35:53,885
(Located in a hidden alley in Chungmuro is...)

1025
00:35:53,886 --> 00:35:56,226
(Inhyeon Traditional Market.)

1026
00:35:56,657 --> 00:36:00,027
(In the alley are hole-in-the-wall restaurants.)

1027
00:36:00,697 --> 00:36:04,797
(The places have old-fashioned vibes that feel frozen in time, )

1028
00:36:05,197 --> 00:36:08,166
(which makes the market popular among Millennials and Gen Z.)

1029
00:36:09,507 --> 00:36:10,906
(Inhyeon Traditional Market is an attraction of Jung-gu.)

1030
00:36:10,907 --> 00:36:12,236
(When you go take a seat, the owner serves you whatever she wants.)

1031
00:36:12,237 --> 00:36:13,575
(There are lots of restaurants that serve region-specific foods.)

1032
00:36:13,576 --> 00:36:15,776
These days, the younger generation...

1033
00:36:15,777 --> 00:36:17,276
come to markets like this one a lot.

1034
00:36:17,277 --> 00:36:18,346
- That's right. - That's right.

1035
00:36:18,746 --> 00:36:20,176
- Do you want coffee? - What is this?

1036
00:36:20,177 --> 00:36:21,415
They make coffee with tea leaves?

1037
00:36:21,416 --> 00:36:23,046
Jae Seok.

1038
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:24,546
(Who is it?)

1039
00:36:24,547 --> 00:36:27,185
You should buy coffee from here.

1040
00:36:27,186 --> 00:36:28,415
Gosh.

1041
00:36:28,416 --> 00:36:29,885
Go buy coffee.

1042
00:36:29,886 --> 00:36:31,426
- From here? - Yes.

1043
00:36:31,427 --> 00:36:33,156
All right. Then we'll...

1044
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:35,225
Thank you for visiting.

1045
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:36,226
Do they have good coffee?

1046
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:38,397
- Yes, buy their coffee. - Sure.

1047
00:36:38,726 --> 00:36:40,336
- Hello. - Hello.

1048
00:36:40,337 --> 00:36:42,196
- Gosh. - Gosh.

1049
00:36:42,197 --> 00:36:43,966
- This is... - This cafe is fun.

1050
00:36:43,967 --> 00:36:45,636
(Gosh!)

1051
00:36:46,277 --> 00:36:49,407
(The cozy cafe is...)

1052
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:54,416
(decorated to resemble Hong Kong films of the 1980s.)

1053
00:36:55,416 --> 00:36:57,086
This is the poster of "A Chinese Ghost Story."

1054
00:36:57,087 --> 00:36:58,316
(This is the Hong Kong of Inhyeon Market.)

1055
00:36:58,317 --> 00:37:00,415
Their popularity was incomparable.

1056
00:37:00,416 --> 00:37:01,616
- That's Bruce Lee. - Right.

1057
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:04,386
Mimi, do you know who this is?

1058
00:37:04,857 --> 00:37:06,326
It's Joey Wong.

1059
00:37:06,627 --> 00:37:08,055
She used to be really popular.

1060
00:37:08,056 --> 00:37:09,326
- Really? - Yes.

1061
00:37:09,897 --> 00:37:12,225
(Her pictures used to be on writing pads.)

1062
00:37:12,226 --> 00:37:13,666
These days,

1063
00:37:13,837 --> 00:37:15,836
we can easily get their pictures from the Internet.

1064
00:37:15,837 --> 00:37:17,305
- But they used to be hard to get. - Right.

1065
00:37:17,306 --> 00:37:19,035
- Really? - I had this one friend...

1066
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:20,676
- who went to a movie theater, - Yes.

1067
00:37:20,677 --> 00:37:23,107
Where Joey Wong's face would fill the screen.

1068
00:37:23,306 --> 00:37:25,006
He would take pictures of that with the flash on.

1069
00:37:25,007 --> 00:37:26,075
(His friend took pictures inside the theater with the flash on.)

1070
00:37:26,076 --> 00:37:27,915
Inside the dark theater?

1071
00:37:27,916 --> 00:37:29,147
You're not allowed to take pictures.

1072
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:31,745
(I'm serious!)

1073
00:37:31,746 --> 00:37:33,587
The theaters...

1074
00:37:34,016 --> 00:37:36,225
used to be filled with high school students. Male students.

1075
00:37:36,226 --> 00:37:37,986
That's amazing.

1076
00:37:37,987 --> 00:37:39,726
And when Joey Wong was on the screen... Gosh.

1077
00:37:39,897 --> 00:37:42,055
They would yell out a cheer too.

1078
00:37:42,056 --> 00:37:46,535
(They put in a lot of work to capture Joey Wong on their cameras.)

1079
00:37:46,536 --> 00:37:47,996
- That was a fun story. - What do you want to drink?

1080
00:37:48,297 --> 00:37:50,236
- What do they... - Here's the menu.

1081
00:37:50,237 --> 00:37:52,106
I think they're famous for their milk teas.

1082
00:37:52,107 --> 00:37:53,635
- Roasted hoji milk tea. - A blended drink sounds good.

1083
00:37:53,636 --> 00:37:55,075
I think so too.

1084
00:37:55,076 --> 00:37:57,376
- What's wheat malt cocoa? - This one.

1085
00:37:57,377 --> 00:37:59,216
It's less sweet than regular cocoa.

1086
00:37:59,217 --> 00:38:00,676
- Then we'll have that. - Sounds great.

1087
00:38:00,677 --> 00:38:02,415
- We'll have four wheat malt cocoa. - Why are you...

1088
00:38:02,416 --> 00:38:03,416
(Why are you deciding for us?)

1089
00:38:03,417 --> 00:38:04,785
- The wheat malt cocoa. - Why are you...

1090
00:38:04,786 --> 00:38:06,116
I want a wheat malt cocoa too.

1091
00:38:06,186 --> 00:38:07,986
- I'm curious about how it tastes. - We'll have them warm, please.

1092
00:38:07,987 --> 00:38:09,086
- Okay. - Yes.

1093
00:38:09,087 --> 00:38:10,087
We'll have four.

1094
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:11,087
There's also ten medicinal herbs coffee.

1095
00:38:11,088 --> 00:38:13,356
I should hang around Jae Seok more often.

1096
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:14,396
He's frequently the one who pays.

1097
00:38:14,397 --> 00:38:16,725
- Right. - He's frequently the one who pays.

1098
00:38:16,726 --> 00:38:19,336
In the past, he wasn't, because he didn't have money.

1099
00:38:19,337 --> 00:38:21,665
- He didn't have money back then. - I buy food for people often now.

1100
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:23,135
- He does. - That's great.

1101
00:38:23,136 --> 00:38:24,165
Thank you.

1102
00:38:24,166 --> 00:38:26,006
People used to say I looked like him when I was younger.

1103
00:38:26,007 --> 00:38:28,035
- You have similar vibes. - Takeshi Kaneshiro?

1104
00:38:28,036 --> 00:38:29,406
He used to be one of Hong Kong's four most handsome actors, right?

1105
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:30,606
- Yes. - One of the most handsome actors?

1106
00:38:30,607 --> 00:38:31,906
Gosh, you kind of look like him.

1107
00:38:31,907 --> 00:38:33,216
People used to say that when I was younger.

1108
00:38:33,217 --> 00:38:34,646
You kind of look like Takeshi Kaneshiro.

1109
00:38:34,647 --> 00:38:36,047
I admire him a lot as an actor.

1110
00:38:36,246 --> 00:38:38,515
- Kyoung Pyo really looks like... - He does.

1111
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:40,015
- Takeshi Kaneshiro. - Especially below his nose.

1112
00:38:40,016 --> 00:38:41,955
When I was younger. He's really good-looking.

1113
00:38:41,956 --> 00:38:43,026
He is.

1114
00:38:43,027 --> 00:38:45,126
Back when I was a teenager,

1115
00:38:45,127 --> 00:38:48,556
Hong Kong's culture and films...

1116
00:38:48,857 --> 00:38:50,296
were almost as huge as Korean culture now.

1117
00:38:50,297 --> 00:38:51,826
- Almost, yes. - Almost.

1118
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,336
Is our order already ready?

1119
00:38:53,337 --> 00:38:55,136
Excuse me, but we ordered them to go.

1120
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:56,366
I'm sorry.

1121
00:38:57,467 --> 00:38:59,067
Can we bring back the mugs tomorrow?

1122
00:38:59,607 --> 00:39:01,306
(Laughing)

1123
00:39:01,507 --> 00:39:03,606
(The china mug is pretty.)

1124
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:04,705
The mug is too big.

1125
00:39:04,706 --> 00:39:06,376
As long as it's okay with you...

1126
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:08,515
- We'll wash them for you. - I'll wash them and bring them...

1127
00:39:08,516 --> 00:39:10,516
- We can bring them back for you. - Right.

1128
00:39:11,087 --> 00:39:12,955
Getting a drink to go in a mug like this is...

1129
00:39:12,956 --> 00:39:15,926
(This is a new way to get a drink to go.)

1130
00:39:15,927 --> 00:39:18,055
- This is so funny. - The mug is nice and warm.

1131
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:19,495
This is funny. That mug is cute too.

1132
00:39:19,496 --> 00:39:20,926
- Right. - Yes, isn't it?

1133
00:39:20,927 --> 00:39:22,696
Let's go.

1134
00:39:22,697 --> 00:39:24,396
- Have a nice day. - Thank you.

1135
00:39:24,397 --> 00:39:25,427
Thank you.

1136
00:39:25,996 --> 00:39:28,236
Gosh, it has just the right amount of sweetness.

1137
00:39:28,237 --> 00:39:29,606
- Do you like it? - I love it.

1138
00:39:29,607 --> 00:39:31,107
- Isn't it great? - Yes, it is.

1139
00:39:31,266 --> 00:39:32,306
This is great.

1140
00:39:32,407 --> 00:39:34,237
"Eunseongsa." Is that a fortune telling house?

1141
00:39:34,407 --> 00:39:35,975
- No, it's a print shop. - A print shop.

1142
00:39:35,976 --> 00:39:38,176
- Hey, Mimi. - Yes?

1143
00:39:38,177 --> 00:39:40,516
Why did you automatically think that about "Eunseongsa?"

1144
00:39:41,016 --> 00:39:43,086
I thought the "sa" in the name meant is was a fortune telling house.

1145
00:39:43,087 --> 00:39:46,185
How did you connect "Eunseongsa" with a fortune telling house?

1146
00:39:46,186 --> 00:39:48,415
The "sa" in "Eunseongsa."

1147
00:39:48,416 --> 00:39:51,385
You thought "Eunseongsa" was a fortune telling house.

1148
00:39:51,386 --> 00:39:52,386
(Mimi's dictionary: If there's "sa," it's a fortune telling house.)

1149
00:39:52,387 --> 00:39:53,995
- That's so funny. - Goodness.

1150
00:39:53,996 --> 00:39:56,365
- It's so cold. - Hello.

1151
00:39:56,366 --> 00:39:57,865
- Goodness. - Hello.

1152
00:39:57,866 --> 00:40:00,296
- It's suddenly gotten colder. - Hello.

1153
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:02,566
- Have a nice day. - Aren't these filefish?

1154
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:05,237
- Yes, they are. - How do you have filefish here?

1155
00:40:05,467 --> 00:40:06,506
Filefish is rare.

1156
00:40:06,507 --> 00:40:08,236
Say hi to me too.

1157
00:40:08,237 --> 00:40:09,845
(Say hi to me too!)

1158
00:40:09,846 --> 00:40:11,147
Gosh, hello.

1159
00:40:11,346 --> 00:40:13,876
I'm sorry for looking at the fish only. I'm sorry.

1160
00:40:13,877 --> 00:40:15,216
- Yes. - Yes.

1161
00:40:15,217 --> 00:40:16,316
- Have a nice day. - Have a nice day.

1162
00:40:16,317 --> 00:40:18,647
It's cold out here. Stay warm.

1163
00:40:18,746 --> 00:40:20,115
- You should have said hi. - I'm sorry.

1164
00:40:20,116 --> 00:40:22,217
I had my eyes on the filefish.

1165
00:40:22,556 --> 00:40:23,785
Gosh, the chopped live octopus here sounds good.

1166
00:40:23,786 --> 00:40:25,725
- Hello. - Hello.

1167
00:40:25,726 --> 00:40:27,326
- Hello. - Nice to see you.

1168
00:40:27,527 --> 00:40:28,657
Have a nice day.

1169
00:40:29,627 --> 00:40:31,297
Gosh.

1170
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,435
- Be careful not to catch a cold. - Have a nice day.

1171
00:40:33,436 --> 00:40:35,336
- Yes, stay warm. - Have a nice day.

1172
00:40:35,337 --> 00:40:36,536
Gosh.

1173
00:40:37,036 --> 00:40:38,205
Gosh.

1174
00:40:38,206 --> 00:40:39,575
Being popular must be nice.

1175
00:40:39,576 --> 00:40:42,406
(Being popular must be nice!)

1176
00:40:42,407 --> 00:40:44,705
Another peace sign.

1177
00:40:44,706 --> 00:40:45,745
(That's the second peace sign they've received today.)

1178
00:40:45,746 --> 00:40:47,476
The elderly always hold up peace signs.

1179
00:40:47,817 --> 00:40:50,216
He said, "Being popular must be nice."

1180
00:40:50,217 --> 00:40:51,285
That's so funny.

1181
00:40:51,286 --> 00:40:53,217
- "Being popular must be nice." - "Must be nice."

1182
00:40:53,516 --> 00:40:54,816
It's so funny.

1183
00:40:54,817 --> 00:40:55,885
(It's so funny.)

1184
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:58,426
I haven't felt that kind of warmheartedness in a while.

1185
00:40:58,427 --> 00:41:00,926
- They're all so sweet. - It's so nice.

1186
00:41:00,927 --> 00:41:02,026
- You wouldn't know unless... - It's so nice.

1187
00:41:02,027 --> 00:41:03,126
- you walk around. - That's right.

1188
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,326
(You wouldn't know what it's like unless you walk around.)

1189
00:41:05,427 --> 00:41:07,635
- Gosh, it's cold. - Goodness. It's Yu Jae Seok!

1190
00:41:07,636 --> 00:41:09,635
- Hello. - Let's shake hands.

1191
00:41:09,636 --> 00:41:11,906
- Hello. Goodness. - Hello.

1192
00:41:11,907 --> 00:41:12,935
(Cheering)

1193
00:41:12,936 --> 00:41:14,277
This is Ko Kyoung Pyo, and this is Mimi.

1194
00:41:14,407 --> 00:41:15,475
Hello.

1195
00:41:15,476 --> 00:41:17,305
Did you go hiking?

1196
00:41:17,306 --> 00:41:18,407
I see.

1197
00:41:18,677 --> 00:41:19,816
Goodness. Madam Song Eun I.

1198
00:41:19,817 --> 00:41:21,575
- Hello. - Hello.

1199
00:41:21,576 --> 00:41:23,047
- Gosh. It's nice to meet you. - Yes, hello.

1200
00:41:23,217 --> 00:41:24,845
- Goodness. - Madam Song.

1201
00:41:24,846 --> 00:41:25,846
Hello.

1202
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,115
- Come over here. - What is it?

1203
00:41:28,116 --> 00:41:29,986
- What is it? What? - Do you know what he said?

1204
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,926
He said, "Goodness. Madam Song Eun I."

1205
00:41:31,927 --> 00:41:34,096
(Madam Song Eun I)

1206
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:35,757
Madam.

1207
00:41:35,996 --> 00:41:37,666
He referred to you as Madam.

1208
00:41:37,866 --> 00:41:39,995
Goodness. Madam Song Eun I.

1209
00:41:39,996 --> 00:41:41,435
Goodness, hello.

1210
00:41:41,436 --> 00:41:43,266
- Gosh. It's nice to meet you. - Yes, hello.

1211
00:41:43,407 --> 00:41:44,407
Madam...

1212
00:41:45,206 --> 00:41:47,337
(I can't believe he said, "Madam Song Eun I.")

1213
00:41:47,536 --> 00:41:49,946
- Madam Song Eun I. - Let's choose...

1214
00:41:49,947 --> 00:41:52,606
the best phrases we've heard.

1215
00:41:52,607 --> 00:41:53,947
"Being popular must be nice."

1216
00:41:54,447 --> 00:41:57,015
- And "Madam Song Eun I." - "Madam Song Eun I."

1217
00:41:57,016 --> 00:41:58,087
("Madam Song Eun I")

1218
00:41:58,317 --> 00:41:59,685
(The quotes of Chungmuro left lingering feelings among them.)

1219
00:41:59,686 --> 00:42:01,587
It's so funny how he said "Being popular must be nice."

1220
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:04,186
And since we ate pork belly for breakfast,

1221
00:42:04,527 --> 00:42:05,856
- my stomach... - I feel great.

1222
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:06,926
My stomach is...

1223
00:42:06,927 --> 00:42:08,995
- My stomach is full. - I'm bursting with energy.

1224
00:42:08,996 --> 00:42:10,165
- It's so nice. - I'm bursting with energy.

1225
00:42:10,166 --> 00:42:11,526
- Bursting with energy. - Bursting with energy.

1226
00:42:11,527 --> 00:42:12,765
- This is so nice. - With our stomachs full.

1227
00:42:12,766 --> 00:42:15,336
This is why people need to have breakfast.

1228
00:42:15,337 --> 00:42:16,506
Breakfast is essential.

1229
00:42:16,507 --> 00:42:18,336
- People shouldn't starve. - Right, breakfast is a must.

1230
00:42:18,337 --> 00:42:19,836
- Gosh. - Gosh, that's funny.

1231
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:21,177
That's funny.

1232
00:42:22,277 --> 00:42:23,745
- Sulmuro. - Where is it?

1233
00:42:23,746 --> 00:42:25,407
(The second trendy place is run by an owner obsessed with ice cream.)

1234
00:42:25,647 --> 00:42:27,447
I think I see something.

1235
00:42:28,147 --> 00:42:30,086
This is a pub. It's not an ice cream place.

1236
00:42:30,087 --> 00:42:31,116
(The Sixth Sense members have reached an alley.)

1237
00:42:31,317 --> 00:42:32,486
Wait, where's...

1238
00:42:32,487 --> 00:42:33,516
Where is it?

1239
00:42:34,157 --> 00:42:35,816
Our second stop was an ice cream place.

1240
00:42:35,817 --> 00:42:36,826
- That's right. - Yes.

1241
00:42:37,326 --> 00:42:40,697
(They followed the map's directions, )

1242
00:42:40,826 --> 00:42:43,826
(but instead of any dessert cafes that might sell ice cream, )

1243
00:42:46,136 --> 00:42:49,036
(the alley is lined with pubs.)

1244
00:42:49,337 --> 00:42:50,665
There aren't any ice cream shops.

1245
00:42:50,666 --> 00:42:53,106
There are only pubs and taverns here.

1246
00:42:53,107 --> 00:42:54,237
This must be a lie.

1247
00:42:54,737 --> 00:42:56,205
A lie?

1248
00:42:56,206 --> 00:42:57,876
- This must be a lie. - What?

1249
00:42:57,877 --> 00:43:00,476
- I don't see any ice cream chops. - That's a pub.

1250
00:43:02,217 --> 00:43:04,816
(The address belongs to a pub with red brick walls.)

1251
00:43:04,817 --> 00:43:06,216
It says "fusion pub."

1252
00:43:06,217 --> 00:43:07,555
(The place is very clearly a pub.)

1253
00:43:07,556 --> 00:43:09,216
"Dongguk University's famous restaurant."

1254
00:43:09,217 --> 00:43:10,857
- "Dongguk University's famous pub." - What?

1255
00:43:11,326 --> 00:43:14,126
- I think this is the right place. - Really? This is it?

1256
00:43:14,127 --> 00:43:16,726
- This is it on the map? - Yes, this is it on the map.

1257
00:43:16,897 --> 00:43:18,126
- If it's on the map, let's go in. - I'll open the door.

1258
00:43:18,127 --> 00:43:19,566
This is the only place that's open.

1259
00:43:19,567 --> 00:43:21,036
- You're right. - Yes.

1260
00:43:21,297 --> 00:43:22,337
I guess we're at the right place.

1261
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,935
Hello.

1262
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:27,536
(The inside of the pub looks quite old.)

1263
00:43:27,706 --> 00:43:29,236
- Hello. - Gosh, hello.

1264
00:43:29,237 --> 00:43:30,305
How many people?

1265
00:43:30,306 --> 00:43:31,345
- There are four of us. - Four.

1266
00:43:31,346 --> 00:43:32,947
We came here to eat ice cream.

1267
00:43:33,246 --> 00:43:35,816
- Yes, you can sit here. - Do you sell ice cream here?

1268
00:43:35,817 --> 00:43:37,647
Yes, we sell ice cream.

1269
00:43:40,286 --> 00:43:42,987
(Dongguk University is in an eight-minute distance on foot.)

1270
00:43:43,627 --> 00:43:46,556
(This place is full of traces of time.)

1271
00:43:47,627 --> 00:43:49,726
The place does feel old.

1272
00:43:50,067 --> 00:43:51,095
(Dongguk University, Information Communication Engineering)

1273
00:43:51,096 --> 00:43:54,737
There are doodles on the wall, and this one says "2014."

1274
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:59,107
(A pub decorated with cute pictures that's in front of a university)

1275
00:43:59,337 --> 00:44:02,076
- But this isn't an ice cream shop. - Right.

1276
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:05,407
- But the menu... - If we take a look at the menu...

1277
00:44:06,147 --> 00:44:07,745
There's tofu and kimchi.

1278
00:44:07,746 --> 00:44:09,277
And boneless chicken feet.

1279
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:13,416
(The menu looks like a normal pub menu.)

1280
00:44:14,056 --> 00:44:15,115
(Where on earth is the ice cream?)

1281
00:44:15,116 --> 00:44:16,656
The ice cream could be...

1282
00:44:16,657 --> 00:44:18,156
- their signature menu. - Here's the ice cream.

1283
00:44:18,157 --> 00:44:19,697
- Is this... - Ice cream-tteokbokki?

1284
00:44:20,996 --> 00:44:23,527
- Ice cream-tteokbokki? - Oh, my.

1285
00:44:23,927 --> 00:44:26,296
It's tteokbokki with ice cream.

1286
00:44:26,297 --> 00:44:27,736
(Tteokbokki with ice cream?)

1287
00:44:27,737 --> 00:44:29,607
- Gosh. - Goodness.

1288
00:44:29,766 --> 00:44:31,607
There's ice cream-udon too.

1289
00:44:31,737 --> 00:44:34,406
So you order that to drink alcohol with soup.

1290
00:44:34,407 --> 00:44:36,276
How did they add ice cream into udon?

1291
00:44:36,277 --> 00:44:38,075
(Udon...)

1292
00:44:38,076 --> 00:44:41,015
(with ice cream?)

1293
00:44:41,016 --> 00:44:43,845
The ice cream-salad isn't just a regular salad.

1294
00:44:43,846 --> 00:44:46,486
It's ice cream-strawberry salad.

1295
00:44:46,487 --> 00:44:47,915
(There's even a dish to refresh your palate.)

1296
00:44:47,916 --> 00:44:49,217
This is...

1297
00:44:49,456 --> 00:44:51,527
You shouldn't be playing with food!

1298
00:44:51,826 --> 00:44:52,857
The owner is behind you.

1299
00:44:54,726 --> 00:44:55,927
(Here I am!)

1300
00:44:56,927 --> 00:44:58,896
(He directly said that before the owner.)

1301
00:44:58,897 --> 00:44:59,935
(I didn't mean it.)

1302
00:44:59,936 --> 00:45:00,996
I'm sorry.

1303
00:45:01,297 --> 00:45:03,337
(That's okay.)

1304
00:45:04,266 --> 00:45:05,306
Seriously...

1305
00:45:06,806 --> 00:45:08,837
I made a lot of mistakes today.

1306
00:45:09,407 --> 00:45:10,676
Gosh...

1307
00:45:10,677 --> 00:45:12,277
(Punishing himself)

1308
00:45:12,777 --> 00:45:14,475
- Excuse me. - Yes?

1309
00:45:14,476 --> 00:45:16,586
How long have you been offering...

1310
00:45:16,587 --> 00:45:19,955
ice cream-udon, ice cream-tteokbokki?

1311
00:45:19,956 --> 00:45:21,087
- Since I added them to the menu? - Yes.

1312
00:45:21,487 --> 00:45:23,825
It was last winter. So it's been a year.

1313
00:45:23,826 --> 00:45:25,587
(He's been selling for a year since last winter.)

1314
00:45:25,886 --> 00:45:27,296
Why do you do this?

1315
00:45:27,297 --> 00:45:28,556
(Why did you do that?)

1316
00:45:29,427 --> 00:45:30,766
(Hey, stop.)

1317
00:45:30,996 --> 00:45:33,066
We ate meat for breakfast.

1318
00:45:33,067 --> 00:45:34,135
I'm just curious.

1319
00:45:34,136 --> 00:45:35,836
- We ate meat for breakfast. - I'm just curious.

1320
00:45:35,837 --> 00:45:37,636
- How do customers react to these? - I wonder.

1321
00:45:38,107 --> 00:45:39,635
They say...

1322
00:45:39,636 --> 00:45:42,106
the spiciness of tteokbokki is neutralized by ice cream.

1323
00:45:42,107 --> 00:45:43,806
I get what it's like.

1324
00:45:44,377 --> 00:45:46,245
(After listening to his explanation, they start to understand.)

1325
00:45:46,246 --> 00:45:49,146
- It tastes like cream tteokbokki! - That's what it is!

1326
00:45:49,147 --> 00:45:50,647
It has a mild taste and is good.

1327
00:45:51,516 --> 00:45:53,056
(Let's see...)

1328
00:45:55,757 --> 00:45:59,697
It's out of topic, but why are you wearing short sleeves?

1329
00:46:00,627 --> 00:46:01,756
- I mean, - That is...

1330
00:46:01,757 --> 00:46:03,825
- we have to find a fake one. - As I see,

1331
00:46:03,826 --> 00:46:05,866
he recently started going to the gym.

1332
00:46:06,496 --> 00:46:08,466
You thought cameras were filming,

1333
00:46:08,467 --> 00:46:10,407
so it could be a good chance to show off?

1334
00:46:11,407 --> 00:46:13,006
(I work out quite often.)

1335
00:46:13,007 --> 00:46:15,305
- Then, we should order these. - We should.

1336
00:46:15,306 --> 00:46:17,147
- We should order the main food. - We should.

1337
00:46:17,576 --> 00:46:19,507
(As receiving orders, he starts cooking.)

1338
00:46:20,217 --> 00:46:21,677
(He lights a fire first.)

1339
00:46:21,877 --> 00:46:24,147
(Then, he cuts the white parts of green onions...)

1340
00:46:25,047 --> 00:46:27,616
(and makes onion oil.)

1341
00:46:31,987 --> 00:46:34,896
(As the veggies are covered with fire, )

1342
00:46:34,897 --> 00:46:37,326
(broth is added.)

1343
00:46:38,127 --> 00:46:40,967
(Then, soaked rice cakes made of flour are poured.)

1344
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:45,967
(For a spicy flavor, he adds Vietnamese red pepper.)

1345
00:46:46,536 --> 00:46:47,907
(Here's the important part.)

1346
00:46:48,177 --> 00:46:51,177
(He adds the so-called onions-garlic-oil...)

1347
00:46:51,746 --> 00:46:54,846
(and pours crushed garlic into tteokbokki for a good flavor.)

1348
00:46:55,047 --> 00:46:57,186
(Finally, he adds a spoonful of corn syrup.)

1349
00:46:58,686 --> 00:47:02,087
(Stir it until it becomes thick.)

1350
00:47:03,527 --> 00:47:07,797
(Boil it until tteokbokki absorbs the spiciness.)

1351
00:47:08,726 --> 00:47:11,397
(The red tteokbokki is complete.)

1352
00:47:11,726 --> 00:47:14,197
(Then, something shows up.)

1353
00:47:15,737 --> 00:47:17,366
(Ice cream)

1354
00:47:17,866 --> 00:47:20,507
(Ice cream-tteokbokki, what kind of dish will be created?)

1355
00:47:22,206 --> 00:47:24,306
If so, there should be...

1356
00:47:24,407 --> 00:47:27,877
some menu-related scribble on the wall.

1357
00:47:28,076 --> 00:47:29,076
(He, the Sixth Sense's expert, makes a great point.)

1358
00:47:29,077 --> 00:47:30,587
- You have a sharp intelligence! - There must be something.

1359
00:47:30,686 --> 00:47:31,987
- You have a sharp intelligence! - Behind you.

1360
00:47:32,447 --> 00:47:33,516
Where?

1361
00:47:34,217 --> 00:47:36,385
- "Dad's tteokbokki!" - This is it.

1362
00:47:36,386 --> 00:47:38,455
- It seems this is recently written. - That's what I mean!

1363
00:47:38,456 --> 00:47:40,397
We found it so easily! Then...

1364
00:47:41,096 --> 00:47:43,165
Oh, it says this is a popular place for ice cream.

1365
00:47:43,166 --> 00:47:44,226
- There is? - Really?

1366
00:47:44,326 --> 00:47:45,896
- Oh, there is. "Ice cream." - Where?

1367
00:47:45,897 --> 00:47:48,337
It seems this was written not long ago.

1368
00:47:48,737 --> 00:47:51,036
I don't know if it depicts ice cream or dung. Anyway...

1369
00:47:51,136 --> 00:47:53,305
He said last winter.

1370
00:47:53,306 --> 00:47:55,236
- I get that it was added recently. - Oh, right.

1371
00:47:55,237 --> 00:47:57,147
- He started only a year ago. - But today is...

1372
00:47:57,746 --> 00:48:00,716
the first day...

1373
00:48:00,717 --> 00:48:02,547
- of the City Tour. - So?

1374
00:48:03,047 --> 00:48:04,647
In a way, I feel relieved...

1375
00:48:05,217 --> 00:48:06,657
that we have no one with sharp intelligence.

1376
00:48:07,786 --> 00:48:08,786
We're so blunt!

1377
00:48:09,556 --> 00:48:12,386
The producers selected us on purpose.

1378
00:48:12,757 --> 00:48:14,127
Someone who is way too sharp...

1379
00:48:14,326 --> 00:48:16,225
- is like this. - At least I'm trying!

1380
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:18,066
Some guys go way too deep.

1381
00:48:18,067 --> 00:48:20,336
- Until they reach the core! - Until others are irritated.

1382
00:48:20,337 --> 00:48:23,337
- We can see their eagerness. - Yes.

1383
00:48:23,436 --> 00:48:25,165
Some argue with the production team.

1384
00:48:25,166 --> 00:48:27,536
- But we are not like them! - No!

1385
00:48:28,177 --> 00:48:29,177
- We enjoy it. - So we are...

1386
00:48:29,607 --> 00:48:32,147
the enjoying type.

1387
00:48:33,217 --> 00:48:36,146
It doesn't work however hard we try.

1388
00:48:36,147 --> 00:48:37,845
- Did you hear what she said? - That's good.

1389
00:48:37,846 --> 00:48:38,916
It doesn't work.

1390
00:48:39,246 --> 00:48:41,186
I already saw through her eating pork belly.

1391
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:43,526
(While the blunt friends are enjoying themselves, )

1392
00:48:43,527 --> 00:48:44,527
That's right.

1393
00:48:44,857 --> 00:48:46,927
(the dishes are complete in the kitchen.)

1394
00:48:47,757 --> 00:48:48,926
(All focused)

1395
00:48:48,927 --> 00:48:50,265
Back in the day,

1396
00:48:50,266 --> 00:48:53,536
we couldn't easily see how dishes were made.

1397
00:48:53,837 --> 00:48:55,737
- But it's completely open now. - They didn't use to show it.

1398
00:48:56,197 --> 00:48:58,305
Anyway, I feel...

1399
00:48:58,306 --> 00:49:00,906
things changed a lot compared to last time.

1400
00:49:00,907 --> 00:49:01,907
I see that too.

1401
00:49:02,706 --> 00:49:04,706
- It's what they sell... - Isn't that Fanfare?

1402
00:49:05,777 --> 00:49:07,446
(The expert of Sixth Sense finds something.)

1403
00:49:07,447 --> 00:49:08,976
It's what they sell in a supermarket.

1404
00:49:09,677 --> 00:49:12,087
- That's what it is! - It's the same!

1405
00:49:12,246 --> 00:49:13,685
- That's it! - That's Fanfare.

1406
00:49:13,686 --> 00:49:15,416
- Right? - Why is he holding it?

1407
00:49:16,627 --> 00:49:18,627
I think they're discussing something.

1408
00:49:19,357 --> 00:49:20,595
(Pressured)

1409
00:49:20,596 --> 00:49:22,857
I'm sorry. We're just filming.

1410
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:26,226
- This is what we do for a job. - We're working.

1411
00:49:26,766 --> 00:49:27,796
- That ice cream... - That is...

1412
00:49:27,797 --> 00:49:29,266
- Oh, he actually added it. - He cut and added it.

1413
00:49:30,306 --> 00:49:32,407
- That udon... - He adds it to udon!

1414
00:49:33,777 --> 00:49:35,177
Here's your ice cream-tteokbokki.

1415
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,147
- What's this? - Here it is!

1416
00:49:40,971 --> 00:49:42,271
Here's your ice cream-tteokbokki.

1417
00:49:42,842 --> 00:49:44,282
- What's this? - Here it is!

1418
00:49:47,251 --> 00:49:49,611
This is unique. I should take a photo.

1419
00:49:49,612 --> 00:49:51,282
- Is that ice cream? - It's like a composite photograph!

1420
00:49:55,751 --> 00:49:57,021
(Year of 2025)

1421
00:49:58,092 --> 00:49:59,391
(Ice cream is...)

1422
00:50:02,831 --> 00:50:05,061
(added to tteokbokki.)

1423
00:50:06,302 --> 00:50:07,931
(Those who like ice cream and tteokbokki will be surprised.)

1424
00:50:08,931 --> 00:50:11,141
(Ice cream poured in tteokbokki)

1425
00:50:11,442 --> 00:50:12,771
During the trip to Japan,

1426
00:50:13,212 --> 00:50:16,540
I saw ice cream decorated in ramen.

1427
00:50:16,541 --> 00:50:18,842
I thought I could create a dish using that.

1428
00:50:20,212 --> 00:50:23,151
As it can be a good topic to post on SNS,

1429
00:50:23,152 --> 00:50:24,322
(A typical point that can be posted on SNS)

1430
00:50:25,621 --> 00:50:27,692
people tend to take many pictures.

1431
00:50:27,891 --> 00:50:31,322
(It has become a hot place for ice cream.)

1432
00:50:32,161 --> 00:50:34,592
As it's our main menu,

1433
00:50:34,962 --> 00:50:36,161
people like it a lot.

1434
00:50:36,362 --> 00:50:38,001
Among the ice cream set menus,

1435
00:50:38,601 --> 00:50:40,401
ice cream poured in tteokbokki, which many women like,

1436
00:50:40,402 --> 00:50:42,201
is the most popular.

1437
00:50:43,271 --> 00:50:46,041
I think we sell around 200.

1438
00:50:47,271 --> 00:50:50,212
Our highest sales record is 40,000 dollars a month.

1439
00:50:50,681 --> 00:50:53,011
I'm happy that our sales have increased a lot.

1440
00:50:53,012 --> 00:50:54,012
(I'm happy that our sales have increased a lot.)

1441
00:50:54,251 --> 00:50:57,220
- The viewers of Sixth Sense... - Are we real?

1442
00:50:57,221 --> 00:50:58,652
(The bosses who are crazy about ice cream, are they real?)

1443
00:51:00,192 --> 00:51:02,451
This is... How can we eat this?

1444
00:51:02,951 --> 00:51:05,061
You can mix it with ice cream.

1445
00:51:06,692 --> 00:51:09,032
I feel like you just added ice cream here.

1446
00:51:09,492 --> 00:51:11,132
- What do you think? - Let's mix.

1447
00:51:11,331 --> 00:51:12,561
- Should I mix it? - Mix it!

1448
00:51:13,632 --> 00:51:16,501
I wonder how the taste changes when mixed.

1449
00:51:16,871 --> 00:51:19,770
I'm not confident enough to touch that!

1450
00:51:19,771 --> 00:51:21,212
(No one has seen things like this)

1451
00:51:22,212 --> 00:51:24,512
It's like tteokbokki with soup.

1452
00:51:25,342 --> 00:51:28,351
(It feels like it has become thick.)

1453
00:51:28,712 --> 00:51:30,051
- I'll try ice cream first. - Okay.

1454
00:51:30,052 --> 00:51:31,281
(How will it taste?)

1455
00:51:31,282 --> 00:51:33,152
I can't believe this!

1456
00:51:34,121 --> 00:51:36,192
- It's like soft tofu! - Yes, look at this!

1457
00:51:37,661 --> 00:51:40,060
(Mimi who likes sweets also tries a bite.)

1458
00:51:40,061 --> 00:51:42,031
- It's like soft tofu! - Yes, look at this!

1459
00:51:42,032 --> 00:51:44,000
- It tastes good! - It really is!

1460
00:51:44,001 --> 00:51:46,100
- Seriously! - Yes!

1461
00:51:46,101 --> 00:51:47,101
- It tastes good? - Really?

1462
00:51:47,102 --> 00:51:48,871
(They can't help but applaud.)

1463
00:51:49,172 --> 00:51:50,671
- Is it? - It's good.

1464
00:51:50,672 --> 00:51:51,842
(Ms. Song stops doubting and tries it too.)

1465
00:51:52,271 --> 00:51:54,011
- It's so good! - Yes, it is!

1466
00:51:54,012 --> 00:51:55,041
This is...

1467
00:51:56,072 --> 00:51:57,080
- It's good. - Oh, this is...

1468
00:51:57,081 --> 00:51:58,081
(Kyung Pyo, who is still suspicious, tries it too.)

1469
00:51:59,612 --> 00:52:01,681
- What is this? - It's so good!

1470
00:52:02,581 --> 00:52:04,721
- It makes me speechless and smile. - It is!

1471
00:52:05,221 --> 00:52:06,552
"Why does this taste so good?"

1472
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:08,351
It's good, actually.

1473
00:52:09,221 --> 00:52:10,560
- Thanks. - It's good.

1474
00:52:10,561 --> 00:52:11,561
It's so good.

1475
00:52:11,562 --> 00:52:13,862
Like the pork belly...

1476
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:15,462
with butter,

1477
00:52:16,192 --> 00:52:19,000
- ice cream neutralizes... - Yes.

1478
00:52:19,001 --> 00:52:20,632
- the spiciness. - Right.

1479
00:52:21,302 --> 00:52:23,901
That's why he added a lot of red pepper.

1480
00:52:23,902 --> 00:52:26,072
That's why. I see his intention!

1481
00:52:26,771 --> 00:52:28,911
- It's a taste of sweet and salty. - It's so good.

1482
00:52:29,672 --> 00:52:30,841
"Why does this taste so good?" That's how I felt.

1483
00:52:30,842 --> 00:52:35,152
(Now they see why this place is so popular.)

1484
00:52:36,212 --> 00:52:37,250
It tastes so good!

1485
00:52:37,251 --> 00:52:39,851
(No one can hate tteokbokki.)

1486
00:52:40,021 --> 00:52:43,121
How important is the ice cream menu...

1487
00:52:43,692 --> 00:52:46,321
- in terms of sales? - In an early stage.

1488
00:52:46,322 --> 00:52:47,991
- Customers visit here... - They definitely want to try it!

1489
00:52:47,992 --> 00:52:50,631
And mostly order that first.

1490
00:52:50,632 --> 00:52:51,830
- Because they're curious! - Yes.

1491
00:52:51,831 --> 00:52:54,231
We run until 4am.

1492
00:52:54,232 --> 00:52:55,470
For ice cream-strawberry salad,

1493
00:52:55,471 --> 00:52:58,201
customers are already in their 2nd or 3rd round.

1494
00:52:58,672 --> 00:53:01,640
They prefer light meals.

1495
00:53:01,641 --> 00:53:02,871
- Is this it? - Yes.

1496
00:53:03,612 --> 00:53:05,310
We can eat these fruits...

1497
00:53:05,311 --> 00:53:06,511
(Ice cream-strawberry salad is the most popular set menu.)

1498
00:53:06,512 --> 00:53:09,450
- like a sharbat. - Yes, anyone can enjoy that.

1499
00:53:09,451 --> 00:53:10,482
(It's like a typical sharbat.)

1500
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:13,922
(At that moment, he brings something.)

1501
00:53:14,922 --> 00:53:17,321
- It must taste so good! - This is...

1502
00:53:17,322 --> 00:53:18,520
- Excuse me. - There are different ice creams.

1503
00:53:18,521 --> 00:53:20,461
- I'll grind ice cream on the salad. - Yes.

1504
00:53:20,462 --> 00:53:22,362
(He grinds ice cream on it.)

1505
00:53:23,132 --> 00:53:24,160
(What?)

1506
00:53:24,161 --> 00:53:25,232
- What's this? - What is that?

1507
00:53:26,201 --> 00:53:27,232
- What's this? - What is that?

1508
00:53:28,532 --> 00:53:29,571
Like how we grind cheese?

1509
00:53:29,572 --> 00:53:32,071
(As if it's grana padano cheese, the ice cream bar is ground.)

1510
00:53:32,072 --> 00:53:33,201
Oh, he grinds that sharbat ice cream?

1511
00:53:33,911 --> 00:53:34,970
(Full of fresh tangerine taste)

1512
00:53:34,971 --> 00:53:36,041
- Gosh! - Oh, my!

1513
00:53:37,411 --> 00:53:39,712
(As it's ground thinly, people can eat like a snowflake of shaved ice.)

1514
00:53:41,112 --> 00:53:43,621
(The tangerine blossoms on the bottom of vanilla ice cream.)

1515
00:53:44,382 --> 00:53:47,192
(Ice cream and strawberry salad became ice cream-strawberry salad.)

1516
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:49,790
- This performance is good. - Do you grind the ice cream...

1517
00:53:49,791 --> 00:53:50,791
- like this? - But if you do this...

1518
00:53:50,792 --> 00:53:52,660
wouldn't the wood be ground together as well?

1519
00:53:52,661 --> 00:53:55,092
There is this feeling in the end.

1520
00:53:55,431 --> 00:53:58,060
- This performance is good. - Wait. This idea is good.

1521
00:53:58,061 --> 00:54:00,930
- This is really interesting. - Yes.

1522
00:54:00,931 --> 00:54:02,970
The customers really like this these days.

1523
00:54:02,971 --> 00:54:05,271
- I think young people will like it. - Yes.

1524
00:54:06,501 --> 00:54:08,841
(Thinking carefully)

1525
00:54:08,842 --> 00:54:10,011
If this place is for real,

1526
00:54:10,012 --> 00:54:12,140
- I'll bring a lot of my friends... - This is great.

1527
00:54:12,141 --> 00:54:13,180
Do a get-together...

1528
00:54:13,181 --> 00:54:14,611
and sign an autograph here.

1529
00:54:14,612 --> 00:54:16,611
- Can you promise that? - Yes. Really. If it's real.

1530
00:54:16,612 --> 00:54:17,750
- All right. - Right.

1531
00:54:17,751 --> 00:54:19,421
If it's fake, there will be nothing.

1532
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:20,890
I think this is real.

1533
00:54:20,891 --> 00:54:22,390
I think this is real.

1534
00:54:22,391 --> 00:54:23,692
I'm a bit baffled.

1535
00:54:24,061 --> 00:54:25,421
(He's blunt.)

1536
00:54:25,422 --> 00:54:26,491
I think this is real.

1537
00:54:26,492 --> 00:54:27,790
He really knows the feeling.

1538
00:54:27,791 --> 00:54:28,861
I think a lot of people would want this.

1539
00:54:28,862 --> 00:54:29,862
- I think this will be tasty. - I think...

1540
00:54:29,863 --> 00:54:31,301
- this is really good. - Enjoy.

1541
00:54:31,302 --> 00:54:32,761
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1542
00:54:32,762 --> 00:54:33,971
This is fantastic.

1543
00:54:34,732 --> 00:54:35,930
Try it with the ice cream.

1544
00:54:35,931 --> 00:54:37,241
(How does the ice cream-strawberry salad taste like?)

1545
00:54:37,242 --> 00:54:39,242
There's some kind of oil drizzled here.

1546
00:54:39,601 --> 00:54:40,870
I looked at it earlier, and it might be olive oil.

1547
00:54:40,871 --> 00:54:42,040
I think it's olive oil.

1548
00:54:42,041 --> 00:54:43,041
(Ms. Song, hurry up and try it.)

1549
00:54:44,742 --> 00:54:47,251
(Delicious)

1550
00:54:48,152 --> 00:54:49,250
This is it.

1551
00:54:49,251 --> 00:54:50,850
- Is it good? - This is the most delicious.

1552
00:54:50,851 --> 00:54:52,152
(One strawberry with a spoonful of ice cream)

1553
00:54:52,681 --> 00:54:54,321
- People will like this a lot. - This is it.

1554
00:54:54,322 --> 00:54:56,492
Kyung Pyo, imagine.

1555
00:54:56,692 --> 00:54:58,322
- Even if you go on a third round... - This is good.

1556
00:54:59,291 --> 00:55:01,531
And ask, "Where's the fourth round?" "Let's go here to finish up."

1557
00:55:01,532 --> 00:55:03,731
- This is really refreshing. - Isn't it refreshing?

1558
00:55:03,732 --> 00:55:04,761
It's good as a last dessert...

1559
00:55:04,762 --> 00:55:06,930
- before you go home. - Yes, as a last dessert.

1560
00:55:06,931 --> 00:55:08,101
(You could take care of hangovers before going home.)

1561
00:55:09,001 --> 00:55:11,770
And ice cream menus at most bars are ready-made items...

1562
00:55:11,771 --> 00:55:14,470
- that are made in a factory. - That's right.

1563
00:55:14,471 --> 00:55:17,511
But here, the ingredients and the plating,

1564
00:55:17,512 --> 00:55:19,040
- they are all done with care. - Yes, they are.

1565
00:55:19,041 --> 00:55:21,152
- Gosh. It's good. - It's really tasty.

1566
00:55:21,552 --> 00:55:23,351
There is salt on the bottom as well.

1567
00:55:24,451 --> 00:55:26,180
- Did you sprinkle salt here? - Yes, there is Maldon salt.

1568
00:55:26,181 --> 00:55:27,251
- Yes. - It's so delicious.

1569
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:29,992
Strangely, I feel bad.

1570
00:55:30,521 --> 00:55:32,161
(Why?)

1571
00:55:32,462 --> 00:55:34,830
I keep doubting this place, and then fell relieved after eating.

1572
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:35,991
- It's because it's good. - Right.

1573
00:55:35,992 --> 00:55:37,532
- Isn't it? - That's right.

1574
00:55:38,061 --> 00:55:39,762
Sir, how much is this?

1575
00:55:40,032 --> 00:55:41,470
It's 18 dollars.

1576
00:55:41,471 --> 00:55:42,532
(Ice cream tteokbokki: 18 dollars)

1577
00:55:43,541 --> 00:55:45,902
That's pricey.

1578
00:55:46,302 --> 00:55:49,572
(That guy Ko is at it again.)

1579
00:55:50,482 --> 00:55:51,711
(His inner thoughts suddenly came out due to unexpected price.)

1580
00:55:51,712 --> 00:55:53,411
- No, it's not. - Gosh.

1581
00:55:53,751 --> 00:55:55,151
How much is the salad?

1582
00:55:55,152 --> 00:55:57,450
- It's five dollars. - This is great.

1583
00:55:57,451 --> 00:55:58,451
This one?

1584
00:55:58,922 --> 00:56:00,950
This is great. It is.

1585
00:56:00,951 --> 00:56:01,951
(Mimi's dictionary: This is great.)

1586
00:56:02,251 --> 00:56:04,492
This is great.

1587
00:56:04,721 --> 00:56:07,930
I think you should charge this for 7 to 8 dollars.

1588
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:09,890
- This is too cheap. - This is too cheap.

1589
00:56:09,891 --> 00:56:11,461
- This ice cream is too cheap. - This...

1590
00:56:11,462 --> 00:56:13,571
That's because strawberry is a seasonal fruit.

1591
00:56:13,572 --> 00:56:14,572
- That's right. - Yes, it is.

1592
00:56:14,573 --> 00:56:16,631
So it's difficult to secure this every time.

1593
00:56:16,632 --> 00:56:18,640
- You should charge more. - I think you could charge more.

1594
00:56:18,641 --> 00:56:19,641
- This is good. - But...

1595
00:56:19,642 --> 00:56:21,270
I would eat it even if it's 7 to 8 dollars.

1596
00:56:21,271 --> 00:56:23,211
Wait...

1597
00:56:23,212 --> 00:56:24,541
But who are you to decide?

1598
00:56:25,342 --> 00:56:26,481
(Isn't that right?)

1599
00:56:26,482 --> 00:56:29,511
- Since I've been to many places. - Who...

1600
00:56:29,512 --> 00:56:31,481
- Who are you? - I mean...

1601
00:56:31,482 --> 00:56:33,450
I hope that they'd do better.

1602
00:56:33,451 --> 00:56:34,451
- That's why I said it. - Right.

1603
00:56:34,452 --> 00:56:36,720
But the owner was quite convincing.

1604
00:56:36,721 --> 00:56:38,220
- To eat it in the end. - Yes. This is really great.

1605
00:56:38,221 --> 00:56:39,962
- The performance was great. - Right.

1606
00:56:40,232 --> 00:56:41,931
- And most of all, it's tasty. - It's tasty.

1607
00:56:42,492 --> 00:56:45,431
But before, bar foods around universities...

1608
00:56:45,701 --> 00:56:47,471
were five dollars at most.

1609
00:56:48,831 --> 00:56:50,072
Pork cutlet was...

1610
00:56:50,541 --> 00:56:52,941
At Casa Rosa that was below our school...

1611
00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:55,012
- It was around 2 or 3 dollars. - That's right.

1612
00:56:55,612 --> 00:56:57,842
- When we were in school... - Casa Rosa. Gosh.

1613
00:56:58,311 --> 00:56:59,382
(Gosh)

1614
00:56:59,641 --> 00:57:01,881
It's a place of business. It's the name of a cafe.

1615
00:57:01,882 --> 00:57:03,750
- Western-style cuisine. - Cafe. Casa Rosa.

1616
00:57:03,751 --> 00:57:04,821
- Casa Rosa. - Casa Rosa.

1617
00:57:04,822 --> 00:57:07,051
- That was it. - But why did you bring it up?

1618
00:57:07,052 --> 00:57:09,151
I was thinking...

1619
00:57:09,152 --> 00:57:11,461
that the food prices were expensive.

1620
00:57:11,462 --> 00:57:14,491
- Well... - I went down memory lane alone.

1621
00:57:14,492 --> 00:57:15,691
There was no logic.

1622
00:57:15,692 --> 00:57:18,231
- It used to be two dollars. - We went to...

1623
00:57:18,232 --> 00:57:19,531
- Seoul Institute of the Arts. - Yes.

1624
00:57:19,532 --> 00:57:22,200
- We talked about prices of things. - Prices of things.

1625
00:57:22,201 --> 00:57:24,200
- This is chaotic. - You know...

1626
00:57:24,201 --> 00:57:27,041
I took the exam for electrical engineering at Dongguk University.

1627
00:57:28,112 --> 00:57:30,012
- I didn't make it. - You didn't pass, did you?

1628
00:57:31,911 --> 00:57:34,052
You think that's funny?

1629
00:57:35,012 --> 00:57:37,551
Did you help me in any way when I took the test?

1630
00:57:37,552 --> 00:57:39,051
- That's why you were with me. - What did you ever do for me?

1631
00:57:39,052 --> 00:57:40,651
That's why you were with me in school.

1632
00:57:40,652 --> 00:57:43,092
That's right. I didn't pass.

1633
00:57:43,962 --> 00:57:45,262
Gosh. That's so funny.

1634
00:57:45,362 --> 00:57:47,291
(Finale of the ice cream set)

1635
00:57:47,492 --> 00:57:49,762
(Ice cream-perilla seed udon)

1636
00:57:49,992 --> 00:57:52,362
(Put in well-boiled, chewy udon noodles)

1637
00:57:52,501 --> 00:57:54,871
(Put in enough fish cask sticks.)

1638
00:57:55,431 --> 00:57:58,242
(Boil with mild seasoning in anchovy broth with tuna fish sauce.)

1639
00:57:59,371 --> 00:58:00,971
(Perilla seed on)

1640
00:58:01,612 --> 00:58:05,012
(Mix the nutty perilla seed with soft creamy udon.)

1641
00:58:06,442 --> 00:58:09,652
(Ice cream and perilla seed udon)

1642
00:58:11,121 --> 00:58:13,151
I think it's originally a perilla seed udon.

1643
00:58:13,152 --> 00:58:14,750
But I'll try it with the ice cream mixed in.

1644
00:58:14,751 --> 00:58:17,492
This is the ice cream-udon. Ice cream and perilla seed.

1645
00:58:17,922 --> 00:58:20,862
(Blunt sister takes a bite as well.)

1646
00:58:22,632 --> 00:58:23,802
(Impressed)

1647
00:58:24,201 --> 00:58:25,462
This is delicious.

1648
00:58:29,971 --> 00:58:32,040
This dish with perilla seed...

1649
00:58:32,041 --> 00:58:34,212
and ice cream...

1650
00:58:34,871 --> 00:58:37,011
I'll try eating it all together. With perilla leaves as well.

1651
00:58:37,012 --> 00:58:39,081
But perilla leaves and ice cream are...

1652
00:58:40,242 --> 00:58:41,481
- That is difficult. - That is difficult.

1653
00:58:41,482 --> 00:58:42,482
Perilla leaves.

1654
00:58:43,012 --> 00:58:44,221
Gosh.

1655
00:58:44,882 --> 00:58:45,950
That is not easy.

1656
00:58:45,951 --> 00:58:47,350
(How is the taste?)

1657
00:58:47,351 --> 00:58:48,721
- How is it? - It's good.

1658
00:58:49,451 --> 00:58:50,462
This is...

1659
00:58:50,922 --> 00:58:53,121
- Why is this good? - These together...

1660
00:58:53,692 --> 00:58:55,661
(Jae Seok tries it as well.)

1661
00:58:56,592 --> 00:58:58,061
It's perilla seed udon.

1662
00:58:58,862 --> 00:59:00,160
Did you see Jae Seok's reaction?

1663
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:01,731
This is something he doesn't like.

1664
00:59:01,732 --> 00:59:02,870
(He's caught.)

1665
00:59:02,871 --> 00:59:04,141
- I felt it. - Right?

1666
00:59:04,302 --> 00:59:05,371
Gosh.

1667
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:07,471
His reaction wasn't loud.

1668
00:59:07,672 --> 00:59:09,672
(You can't deceive your real friend.)

1669
00:59:09,911 --> 00:59:12,011
People who like sweet things would like it a lot.

1670
00:59:12,012 --> 00:59:14,310
(People who like sweet things would choose it.)

1671
00:59:14,311 --> 00:59:16,281
- As it is salty but sweet... - Is it good?

1672
00:59:16,282 --> 00:59:17,951
- It is salty and sweet. - Isn't it?

1673
00:59:18,382 --> 00:59:21,520
But since many university students come here...

1674
00:59:21,521 --> 00:59:24,060
I think they would be less resistant to new foods...

1675
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:26,461
- Yes they are. - Young people are less resistant.

1676
00:59:26,462 --> 00:59:28,961
So this is not that ridiculous.

1677
00:59:28,962 --> 00:59:30,261
Even in restaurants that are good with Korean cuisine,

1678
00:59:30,262 --> 00:59:32,861
- perilla seed isn't easy to handle. - It's not easy.

1679
00:59:32,862 --> 00:59:33,930
That's right.

1680
00:59:33,931 --> 00:59:36,631
Perilla seed is a strong ingredient.

1681
00:59:36,632 --> 00:59:38,441
- There could be likes and dislikes. - That's right.

1682
00:59:38,442 --> 00:59:41,841
The fact that they boldly used perilla seed is quite...

1683
00:59:41,842 --> 00:59:42,870
But there are a lot of places like this.

1684
00:59:42,871 --> 00:59:45,011
- They boldly try out things. - They do?

1685
00:59:45,012 --> 00:59:47,052
There's is pepper ice cream these days.

1686
00:59:47,212 --> 00:59:49,151
- Pepper ice cream? - Yes. There is.

1687
00:59:49,152 --> 00:59:51,850
There are foods like this recently.

1688
00:59:51,851 --> 00:59:53,450
This is possible.

1689
00:59:53,451 --> 00:59:55,250
- I think women would like this. - Really?

1690
00:59:55,251 --> 00:59:56,591
Young women.

1691
00:59:56,592 --> 00:59:57,721
(Is ice cream-perilla seed udon a real menu item?)

1692
00:59:57,962 --> 01:00:00,660
(The owner is crazy about ice cream: 1. Polarizing perilla seed udon)

1693
01:00:00,661 --> 01:00:01,961
(2. Formation of wide price range)

1694
01:00:01,962 --> 01:00:03,262
(3. Better than expected harmony with ice cream)

1695
01:00:03,592 --> 01:00:05,060
(They looked around the venue again before leaving.)

1696
01:00:05,061 --> 01:00:06,831
There are more pictures here.

1697
01:00:07,101 --> 01:00:08,901
There's the picture of the owner here as well. Isn't this him?

1698
01:00:08,902 --> 01:00:09,902
Yes, it is.

1699
01:00:10,771 --> 01:00:12,242
It is.

1700
01:00:13,442 --> 01:00:16,341
(It looks at least a couple of months old.)

1701
01:00:16,342 --> 01:00:19,512
Is this real or not? I'm not sure.

1702
01:00:20,512 --> 01:00:21,951
I think this place is real.

1703
01:00:22,712 --> 01:00:24,981
I think I saw this on social media.

1704
01:00:24,982 --> 01:00:27,751
(I think I saw this on social media.)

1705
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:31,790
(The owner who is crazy about ice cream, is he real?)

1706
01:00:31,791 --> 01:00:32,991
It is a cold wave.

1707
01:00:32,992 --> 01:00:34,232
It is really a cold wave.

1708
01:00:34,831 --> 01:00:38,231
- To be honest, when I'm cold... - Your chin looks cold.

1709
01:00:38,232 --> 01:00:40,261
- I think you should wear a scarf. - No. It's okay.

1710
01:00:40,262 --> 01:00:43,172
You don't have fat. If you don't, it's colder.

1711
01:00:43,532 --> 01:00:45,871
I'm sorry but will you stop analyzing?

1712
01:00:46,572 --> 01:00:49,310
- I say it as a friend. - Why are you always analyzing?

1713
01:00:49,311 --> 01:00:50,982
You really don't have fat.

1714
01:00:51,482 --> 01:00:52,680
You really don't have fat.

1715
01:00:52,681 --> 01:00:54,681
Why are you doing this to a person's face?

1716
01:00:55,112 --> 01:00:56,750
Get rid of this.

1717
01:00:56,751 --> 01:00:58,120
- You guys are... - We are real friends.

1718
01:00:58,121 --> 01:01:01,091
- Exactly. - We've been friends for 30 years.

1719
01:01:01,092 --> 01:01:02,850
I want to be friends for 30 years with you as well.

1720
01:01:02,851 --> 01:01:04,491
- You could. - So Mimi...

1721
01:01:04,492 --> 01:01:05,692
So you have to live long.

1722
01:01:06,462 --> 01:01:07,831
(Laughing)

1723
01:01:07,891 --> 01:01:09,631
- Did she just insult us? - No.

1724
01:01:09,632 --> 01:01:11,000
- Ms. Song, did she just insult us? - No. Words of blessing.

1725
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:12,131
- It's words of blessing. - Is it?

1726
01:01:12,132 --> 01:01:13,362
It's words of blessing, right?

1727
01:01:14,232 --> 01:01:15,572
Kyung Pyo.

1728
01:01:15,971 --> 01:01:17,841
- Who are you filming? - Is this for me?

1729
01:01:17,842 --> 01:01:19,701
- This is for me? - The staff are relieved now.

1730
01:01:20,101 --> 01:01:21,511
It's an extreme job.

1731
01:01:21,512 --> 01:01:23,881
Is this how you are supposed to film?

1732
01:01:23,882 --> 01:01:24,882
You...

1733
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:26,942
Were you filming the world of occupations?

1734
01:01:27,811 --> 01:01:29,681
- "Field Experience of Life." - I didn't know.

1735
01:01:31,251 --> 01:01:32,652
It's "Experience Life Scenes."

1736
01:01:33,181 --> 01:01:34,192
(Laughing)

1737
01:01:35,422 --> 01:01:37,220
(Field experience of life)

1738
01:01:37,221 --> 01:01:38,221
(Snorting)

1739
01:01:38,992 --> 01:01:43,160
(1. Butter, 2. Ice Cream)

1740
01:01:43,161 --> 01:01:46,402
(Going toward the owner who is crazy about Korea)

1741
01:01:47,431 --> 01:01:48,830
- Shall we get in? - Yes.

1742
01:01:48,831 --> 01:01:50,131
We'll sit at the back.

1743
01:01:50,132 --> 01:01:51,370
No, whoever got in first could sit at the back.

1744
01:01:51,371 --> 01:01:52,500
Get in.

1745
01:01:52,501 --> 01:01:54,641
Put on the belt, everyone.

1746
01:01:55,041 --> 01:01:57,581
As it is next to Myeongdong Cathedral...

1747
01:01:58,512 --> 01:02:00,651
I like the Jung-gu area...

1748
01:02:00,652 --> 01:02:02,450
because the old and the modern is...

1749
01:02:02,451 --> 01:02:04,181
- mixed well. - It is.

1750
01:02:05,382 --> 01:02:07,790
- And Jung-gu is next to Jongno-gu. - Yes.

1751
01:02:07,791 --> 01:02:09,891
- It is. - And...

1752
01:02:10,322 --> 01:02:12,261
there are a lot of places where you can walk together.

1753
01:02:12,262 --> 01:02:14,732
That's why the old city center is so nice.

1754
01:02:15,061 --> 01:02:16,731
There used to be an overpass here.

1755
01:02:16,732 --> 01:02:17,732
- Really? - Overpass?

1756
01:02:17,733 --> 01:02:19,361
- Now, it is just a regular road. - Yes.

1757
01:02:19,362 --> 01:02:20,531
- It used to be an overpass. - Right.

1758
01:02:20,532 --> 01:02:24,771
(The place where the first Korean overpass, "Ahyeon overpass" was)

1759
01:02:25,101 --> 01:02:27,771
(People walking on the road before it was torn down)

1760
01:02:27,911 --> 01:02:30,341
Ms. Song, you're telling them about things one by one.

1761
01:02:30,342 --> 01:02:32,310
- About this place. - Memories are popping up...

1762
01:02:32,311 --> 01:02:33,441
in my head now that I'm here.

1763
01:02:33,442 --> 01:02:35,011
Ms. Song. Do you remember Joongang Cinema over here?

1764
01:02:35,012 --> 01:02:36,611
- Joongang Cinema was there. - Really?

1765
01:02:36,612 --> 01:02:39,120
And Printemps Department Store. You don't know it, do you?

1766
01:02:39,121 --> 01:02:40,121
- I don't know. - No.

1767
01:02:41,291 --> 01:02:43,390
(Now renamed to the Ministry of Employment and Labor, )

1768
01:02:43,391 --> 01:02:47,631
(it was the nostalgic Printemps Department Store.)

1769
01:02:47,632 --> 01:02:50,262
(A luxurious department store that flew in from Paris in 1988)

1770
01:02:50,362 --> 01:02:52,830
It's really nice to go around with you guys.

1771
01:02:52,831 --> 01:02:55,031
- We tell everything, don't we? - It's really nice.

1772
01:02:55,032 --> 01:02:56,731
Long time ago in Seun Sangga,

1773
01:02:56,732 --> 01:02:57,742
(It's not over yet.)

1774
01:02:57,942 --> 01:03:00,270
there were a lot of curious teenagers...

1775
01:03:00,271 --> 01:03:01,870
coming to buy video tapes.

1776
01:03:01,871 --> 01:03:03,241
R-rated video tapes?

1777
01:03:03,242 --> 01:03:04,640
- On the outside... - Did you go?

1778
01:03:04,641 --> 01:03:05,641
I didn't go.

1779
01:03:05,642 --> 01:03:07,180
During those times... You didn't go?

1780
01:03:07,181 --> 01:03:08,411
- I didn't go. - Really?

1781
01:03:09,612 --> 01:03:13,521
On the outside, it was labeled as a documentary.

1782
01:03:13,922 --> 01:03:15,691
But was it different when you played it?

1783
01:03:15,692 --> 01:03:17,261
Was the content different?

1784
01:03:17,262 --> 01:03:18,461
- Yes. - In fact,

1785
01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:22,061
when kids went there to buy those things...

1786
01:03:22,262 --> 01:03:23,561
Since they are kids,

1787
01:03:24,462 --> 01:03:26,331
the sellers used to...

1788
01:03:27,061 --> 01:03:28,402
con those kids.

1789
01:03:28,732 --> 01:03:30,131
- Right. - They faked it?

1790
01:03:30,132 --> 01:03:33,370
No, the label said it was a documentary and it really was one.

1791
01:03:33,371 --> 01:03:35,310
(Actual content was also a documentary.)

1792
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:37,782
(Too bad)

1793
01:03:39,282 --> 01:03:40,511
Did you see his face?

1794
01:03:40,512 --> 01:03:42,781
He looked really disappointed.

1795
01:03:42,782 --> 01:03:44,051
- I think you've been there. - He can't look more disappointed...

1796
01:03:44,052 --> 01:03:45,221
- than this. - No, I'm not.

1797
01:03:45,482 --> 01:03:48,451
It was labeled a documentary, and it really was a documentary.

1798
01:03:48,822 --> 01:03:50,761
- It was until the end. - I heard that.

1799
01:03:50,762 --> 01:03:53,962
That was what he meant by conning. Goodness.

1800
01:03:54,462 --> 01:03:55,931
- Incredible. - Amazing.

1801
01:03:56,032 --> 01:03:57,231
- Is this it? - Is it here?

1802
01:03:57,232 --> 01:03:58,761
- Gosh. - That was quick.

1803
01:03:58,762 --> 01:03:59,762
That was quick.

1804
01:03:59,763 --> 01:04:02,232
(The center of Seoul tour and the 1st tourist attraction)

1805
01:04:02,532 --> 01:04:05,271
(Myeong-dong)

1806
01:04:05,672 --> 01:04:08,640
(Filled with things to see, play with, and eat)

1807
01:04:08,641 --> 01:04:10,211
(The last spot of the Jung-gu city tour)

1808
01:04:10,212 --> 01:04:12,640
- This is Myeong-dong. - Myeong-dong.

1809
01:04:12,641 --> 01:04:14,411
- That's Myeongdong Cathedral. - Yes.

1810
01:04:14,782 --> 01:04:16,051
It's huge.

1811
01:04:16,052 --> 01:04:17,111
(The Myeongdong Cathedral is the symbol of Myeong-dong.)

1812
01:04:17,112 --> 01:04:18,180
- Is it your first time here? - It's my first time.

1813
01:04:18,181 --> 01:04:20,350
- Yes. I've never been here. - You're here for the first time?

1814
01:04:20,351 --> 01:04:22,720
Actually, it's my first time visiting Myeong-dong on the weekend.

1815
01:04:22,721 --> 01:04:23,721
Right.

1816
01:04:24,322 --> 01:04:26,991
- That's Myeongdong Cathedral. - Myeongdong Cathedral.

1817
01:04:26,992 --> 01:04:28,261
(The Myeongdong Cathedral has been guarding...)

1818
01:04:28,262 --> 01:04:29,532
(the entrance to Myeong-dong for 127 years.)

1819
01:04:30,762 --> 01:04:31,962
- Gosh. The wind... - Right.

1820
01:04:32,532 --> 01:04:33,732
It's strong.

1821
01:04:34,172 --> 01:04:35,931
- Hold on. - Why?

1822
01:04:36,431 --> 01:04:38,600
First, let's buy some gloves...

1823
01:04:38,601 --> 01:04:39,641
(Gagging)

1824
01:04:40,442 --> 01:04:43,512
- This place is so... Gosh. - Gosh.

1825
01:04:44,112 --> 01:04:46,511
- Myeong-dong is surely different. - Exactly.

1826
01:04:46,512 --> 01:04:49,152
If you're in Myeong-dong, you should get tornado potatoes.

1827
01:04:50,081 --> 01:04:51,551
- They sell gloves here. - They sell gloves.

1828
01:04:51,552 --> 01:04:52,652
- Gloves. - I see gloves.

1829
01:04:53,221 --> 01:04:54,391
- Gloves. - I want the pink ones.

1830
01:04:54,721 --> 01:04:57,092
- They are cute. - They are cute.

1831
01:04:57,561 --> 01:04:58,591
Buy a pair of gloves.

1832
01:04:58,592 --> 01:04:59,961
- I want these. - Good.

1833
01:04:59,962 --> 01:05:01,461
- Yes? - Kyoung Pyo.

1834
01:05:01,462 --> 01:05:02,462
(A first gift from Jae Seok)

1835
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:04,361
(Careful)

1836
01:05:04,362 --> 01:05:05,962
- Kyoung Pyo. - I'll get these.

1837
01:05:06,201 --> 01:05:07,671
(Laughing)

1838
01:05:07,672 --> 01:05:09,000
This part is for covering.

1839
01:05:09,001 --> 01:05:11,000
- I see. - It covers the fingers.

1840
01:05:11,001 --> 01:05:12,741
- I unbutton it like this. - They're mittens.

1841
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:14,470
Yes. Then I cover my fingers with it.

1842
01:05:14,471 --> 01:05:16,211
Gosh. That's amazing. I want them too.

1843
01:05:16,212 --> 01:05:18,180
- What about your thumb? - I want white ones too.

1844
01:05:18,181 --> 01:05:19,242
(Ms. Song loves them too.)

1845
01:05:19,382 --> 01:05:20,711
Yes. Jae Seok is buying us gloves.

1846
01:05:20,712 --> 01:05:21,881
- Nice. - Yes.

1847
01:05:21,882 --> 01:05:23,111
(My friend is buying me gloves.)

1848
01:05:23,112 --> 01:05:24,652
Let's walk around...

1849
01:05:25,181 --> 01:05:27,350
- and ask Jae Seok to buy us stuff. - Right.

1850
01:05:27,351 --> 01:05:29,691
- We should take a round. - Yes.

1851
01:05:29,692 --> 01:05:30,721
I love it.

1852
01:05:31,262 --> 01:05:32,660
You're using S Pay.

1853
01:05:32,661 --> 01:05:34,461
(Paying with Jae Seok Pay)

1854
01:05:34,462 --> 01:05:36,962
- Thank you. - Jae Seok bought them for us.

1855
01:05:37,431 --> 01:05:38,461
- Aren't you jealous? - What?

1856
01:05:38,462 --> 01:05:40,131
- Why did you say that? - "Aren't you jealous?"

1857
01:05:40,132 --> 01:05:41,770
- Aren't you jealous? - "Aren't you jealous?"

1858
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:44,242
Why would he be jealous?

1859
01:05:44,402 --> 01:05:45,701
I wanted to brag about it.

1860
01:05:46,041 --> 01:05:47,640
- Good. - Thank you.

1861
01:05:47,641 --> 01:05:49,970
- Thank you. - Good. Have a good one.

1862
01:05:49,971 --> 01:05:51,112
Bye.

1863
01:05:51,411 --> 01:05:53,641
(They bought gloves while passing by it by chance.)

1864
01:05:54,251 --> 01:05:56,382
In the past, we often said such a thing.

1865
01:05:56,652 --> 01:05:59,521
"Meet me at Myeong-dong when it snows for the first time."

1866
01:06:00,721 --> 01:06:03,422
But it'd be hard to find each other due to the crowd.

1867
01:06:03,621 --> 01:06:05,290
It was so crowded.

1868
01:06:05,291 --> 01:06:07,221
(By the way, where is the CEO who is crazy about Korea?)

1869
01:06:07,762 --> 01:06:09,132
- On the left? - Yes. This way.

1870
01:06:09,962 --> 01:06:11,031
This way.

1871
01:06:11,032 --> 01:06:12,261
(This is where the address is.)

1872
01:06:12,262 --> 01:06:13,330
What is this place?

1873
01:06:13,331 --> 01:06:14,902
- What? - Let's see if it's on here.

1874
01:06:16,431 --> 01:06:19,402
- Korea... - What's related to Korea?

1875
01:06:20,771 --> 01:06:23,040
- Dermatology? - I don't see one.

1876
01:06:23,041 --> 01:06:25,481
- It's a securities firm. - It's in Myeong-dong.

1877
01:06:25,482 --> 01:06:26,810
(A dermatologist or securities that is crazy about Korea?)

1878
01:06:26,811 --> 01:06:27,880
No?

1879
01:06:27,881 --> 01:06:29,151
I think it's a real place.

1880
01:06:29,152 --> 01:06:31,081
- I see. - For it to be a fake place,

1881
01:06:31,082 --> 01:06:32,121
- Right? It's so... - its scale is too big.

1882
01:06:32,122 --> 01:06:33,151
This is the place.

1883
01:06:33,152 --> 01:06:35,652
It makes sense for this place to be in Myeong-dong.

1884
01:06:36,351 --> 01:06:39,061
- Is it not a restaurant, then? - No, I don't think so.

1885
01:06:39,362 --> 01:06:40,560
These gloves are so nice.

1886
01:06:40,561 --> 01:06:42,491
- Only one finger is out. - Aren't they perfect?

1887
01:06:42,492 --> 01:06:45,101
Kyoung Pyo, from far behind,

1888
01:06:45,461 --> 01:06:46,801
it looks like your cast is sticking out.

1889
01:06:48,702 --> 01:06:51,100
- Because he has big hands. - Hey, Kyoung Pyo.

1890
01:06:51,101 --> 01:06:52,501
When you wear them like that...

1891
01:06:52,502 --> 01:06:55,140
I didn't know, but they don't cover my thumbs.

1892
01:06:55,141 --> 01:06:57,372
- Exactly. They don't cover them. - That's why I was doing this.

1893
01:06:57,782 --> 01:06:59,441
- I have to bend my thumbs. - Like this.

1894
01:06:59,442 --> 01:07:00,640
To use phones...

1895
01:07:00,641 --> 01:07:02,551
- Gosh. Sorry. - Hello.

1896
01:07:03,482 --> 01:07:04,520
Okay.

1897
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:05,981
(Laughing)

1898
01:07:05,982 --> 01:07:07,021
It's funny.

1899
01:07:07,351 --> 01:07:10,251
It's fun to go to places with a bunch of people.

1900
01:07:10,252 --> 01:07:13,220
- Yes. - Right. We make good memories.

1901
01:07:13,221 --> 01:07:15,661
- You... - You're smart, indeed.

1902
01:07:15,662 --> 01:07:17,232
- Gosh. - Mimi.

1903
01:07:17,431 --> 01:07:18,761
- Fourth floor. - Exactly.

1904
01:07:18,902 --> 01:07:20,361
- What? - Should we get off?

1905
01:07:20,362 --> 01:07:21,470
- Do we... - Let's get off.

1906
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:23,270
It's a shop selling merchandise.

1907
01:07:23,271 --> 01:07:24,501
- K-pop. - K-pop.

1908
01:07:24,502 --> 01:07:25,541
Right. The Korean Wave.

1909
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:27,170
- Nice. - BigBang,

1910
01:07:27,171 --> 01:07:29,042
AKMU, BABYMONSTER.

1911
01:07:29,341 --> 01:07:30,442
Where's OH MY GIRL?

1912
01:07:31,511 --> 01:07:33,612
- This is not a restaurant. - It must be here.

1913
01:07:33,782 --> 01:07:36,081
- K-pop. - It looks like a real one.

1914
01:07:36,082 --> 01:07:37,251
It must be related to K-pop.

1915
01:07:37,252 --> 01:07:38,850
- Hello. - I think this place is real.

1916
01:07:38,851 --> 01:07:40,081
What is this place?

1917
01:07:40,082 --> 01:07:41,890
We've come without any information.

1918
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:44,021
It's an official shop, selling YG Entertainment's merchandise.

1919
01:07:44,152 --> 01:07:46,622
- Official YG merchandise shop. - Official YG merchandise?

1920
01:07:47,322 --> 01:07:48,691
(An entertainment merchandise shop?)

1921
01:07:48,692 --> 01:07:49,692
That's right.

1922
01:07:49,693 --> 01:07:51,701
That must be 2NE1's autographs.

1923
01:07:51,702 --> 01:07:52,930
- BABYMONSTER? - BABYMONSTER.

1924
01:07:52,931 --> 01:07:54,871
Wait. That's G-DRAGON.

1925
01:07:54,872 --> 01:07:55,930
(And there's a CEO who's crazy about Korea here?)

1926
01:07:55,931 --> 01:07:57,872
The VIP lightstick is pretty.

1927
01:07:58,502 --> 01:08:00,170
(But where's the CEO?)

1928
01:08:00,171 --> 01:08:01,810
(Looking around)

1929
01:08:01,811 --> 01:08:04,310
- They are photo books. - Gosh.

1930
01:08:04,311 --> 01:08:05,380
(The vibe inside is somewhat strange.)

1931
01:08:05,381 --> 01:08:06,411
(Amazed)

1932
01:08:06,412 --> 01:08:07,582
(It feels chilly.)

1933
01:08:08,211 --> 01:08:10,611
- They have CDs too. - Wait. They won't...

1934
01:08:10,612 --> 01:08:12,281
- sell these if it's fake. - No way.

1935
01:08:12,282 --> 01:08:14,391
This is obviously real.

1936
01:08:14,692 --> 01:08:16,952
This place is real. That's the only explanation.

1937
01:08:17,152 --> 01:08:19,460
Why would they make a fake one like this?

1938
01:08:19,461 --> 01:08:21,291
Also, it'll be so expensive...

1939
01:08:21,292 --> 01:08:23,192
- to make a fake one like this. - Exactly.

1940
01:08:23,362 --> 01:08:25,331
Have we come to the wrong place?

1941
01:08:25,332 --> 01:08:27,362
Hold on. Is this the wrong place?

1942
01:08:27,902 --> 01:08:29,471
- Wait a second. - On the map...

1943
01:08:29,832 --> 01:08:32,072
- Is it the wrong place? - The map said it was this building.

1944
01:08:32,442 --> 01:08:33,840
- It said fourth floor. - Is this not the place?

1945
01:08:33,841 --> 01:08:36,111
- This isn't it. - This isn't it?

1946
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:37,441
This wasn't the place?

1947
01:08:37,442 --> 01:08:38,941
- Excuse me. Is Sixth Sense... - Let's check the map.

1948
01:08:38,942 --> 01:08:40,952
- Right. Here. - Is this the address here?

1949
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:44,880
This is not our store.

1950
01:08:44,881 --> 01:08:46,251
Why are we here, then?

1951
01:08:46,252 --> 01:08:47,321
Why are we here?

1952
01:08:47,322 --> 01:08:49,020
We're on the right floor. It's on the fourth floor.

1953
01:08:49,021 --> 01:08:51,191
- Sorry. - Is it the building next to this?

1954
01:08:51,192 --> 01:08:53,960
You welcomed us so naturally.

1955
01:08:53,961 --> 01:08:56,090
- Sorry. - That's right.

1956
01:08:56,091 --> 01:08:57,331
- Gosh. - Sorry.

1957
01:08:57,332 --> 01:08:58,731
What a coincidence, right?

1958
01:08:58,732 --> 01:09:01,131
- But... - They seem to be crazy about Korea.

1959
01:09:01,532 --> 01:09:03,731
- K-pop is... - They're crazy about K-pop.

1960
01:09:03,732 --> 01:09:04,841
Sorry.

1961
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:06,971
It was fun to look around.

1962
01:09:07,641 --> 01:09:10,542
- But where's the place... - Where do we go now?

1963
01:09:11,042 --> 01:09:12,281
Is it the wrong building?

1964
01:09:12,282 --> 01:09:13,840
- Are we at the wrong place? - This isn't it?

1965
01:09:13,841 --> 01:09:15,911
- Gosh. Where is it? - Let's check the address carefully.

1966
01:09:15,912 --> 01:09:16,951
(They head to the 1st floor without finding the 3rd spot.)

1967
01:09:16,952 --> 01:09:18,381
We were too focused on buying the gloves.

1968
01:09:18,752 --> 01:09:19,781
The gloves.

1969
01:09:19,782 --> 01:09:21,821
Why did we go to a wrong place?

1970
01:09:21,822 --> 01:09:24,420
- Yes. - It was obviously a real place.

1971
01:09:24,421 --> 01:09:26,621
Jae Seok, it was right for you to be worried.

1972
01:09:26,622 --> 01:09:28,631
No one is keen here.

1973
01:09:28,832 --> 01:09:30,890
At least one person should be keen.

1974
01:09:30,891 --> 01:09:34,401
- That came to my mind. - These people...

1975
01:09:34,402 --> 01:09:35,601
(They are worried about the blunt ones.)

1976
01:09:35,902 --> 01:09:37,231
(They go back to the 1st floor from the 4th floor.)

1977
01:09:37,232 --> 01:09:38,971
But it says the fourth floor on here.

1978
01:09:39,572 --> 01:09:41,771
- But on the fourth floor... - We went to the real place.

1979
01:09:41,971 --> 01:09:44,381
- What is... - Hey. Look.

1980
01:09:44,582 --> 01:09:45,741
We went to this place.

1981
01:09:45,742 --> 01:09:48,380
- There's another one next to it. - There's a mother-of-pear symbol.

1982
01:09:48,381 --> 01:09:49,411
Right.

1983
01:09:49,412 --> 01:09:52,152
There must be another store on the same floor.

1984
01:09:52,681 --> 01:09:54,721
- Wasn't there one entrance, though? - Exactly.

1985
01:09:54,921 --> 01:09:55,921
- This is the fourth floor. - Hold on.

1986
01:09:59,961 --> 01:10:02,032
Goodness. Jae Seok, look at this.

1987
01:10:02,362 --> 01:10:04,961
- Here. - Hey. It's here.

1988
01:10:06,732 --> 01:10:11,071
(When they get off the elevator, they can see...)

1989
01:10:11,072 --> 01:10:12,470
(a small guide.)

1990
01:10:12,471 --> 01:10:14,710
It says the Bar is on the left.

1991
01:10:14,711 --> 01:10:16,970
- I saw it when we first came here. - And?

1992
01:10:16,971 --> 01:10:18,941
But this was bigger, so I thought that must be it.

1993
01:10:18,942 --> 01:10:20,442
(The poster next to it was bigger, so she thought that was it.)

1994
01:10:20,881 --> 01:10:22,010
It has to be big.

1995
01:10:22,011 --> 01:10:23,611
- I feel bad. - It has to be easy to see.

1996
01:10:23,612 --> 01:10:26,251
- This grabbed my attention. - The staff there...

1997
01:10:26,252 --> 01:10:28,391
welcomed us so well.

1998
01:10:28,692 --> 01:10:31,390
- As if they agreed to film this. - Look.

1999
01:10:31,391 --> 01:10:33,291
- There's an iron door here. - I know.

2000
01:10:33,292 --> 01:10:34,691
It looks like a door.

2001
01:10:34,692 --> 01:10:36,361
(An iron door without any sign)

2002
01:10:36,362 --> 01:10:38,032
(Is this the restaurant?)

2003
01:10:38,761 --> 01:10:40,331
I see.

2004
01:10:40,332 --> 01:10:41,631
How would we know that this was the place?

2005
01:10:42,332 --> 01:10:45,270
Gosh. If this is the entrance, it's hard to be real.

2006
01:10:45,271 --> 01:10:46,300
What?

2007
01:10:46,301 --> 01:10:47,741
- It's a little... - Is anybody here?

2008
01:10:47,742 --> 01:10:50,111
- The Korean vibe is... - Is this the place?

2009
01:10:50,112 --> 01:10:51,112
- I know. - A cabinet with inlaid nacre.

2010
01:10:51,681 --> 01:10:53,840
- The Korean vibe is... - Is this the place?

2011
01:10:53,841 --> 01:10:54,851
- I know. - A cabinet with inlaid nacre.

2012
01:10:55,752 --> 01:10:57,380
This must be a waiting room...

2013
01:10:57,381 --> 01:10:59,822
for people to wait when it's full.

2014
01:11:01,152 --> 01:11:06,391
(Are they able to run a restaurant in a hidden place like this?)

2015
01:11:07,292 --> 01:11:09,831
(They are confused about where the entrance is.)

2016
01:11:09,832 --> 01:11:10,960
Is there a door over there?

2017
01:11:10,961 --> 01:11:13,002
(Walking along as if they are under a spell)

2018
01:11:14,362 --> 01:11:15,571
This must be a waiting room.

2019
01:11:15,572 --> 01:11:17,531
(Hesitating)

2020
01:11:17,532 --> 01:11:19,071
I think we go inside through here.

2021
01:11:19,072 --> 01:11:20,341
Is there a door over there?

2022
01:11:22,341 --> 01:11:23,770
- What? - This is...

2023
01:11:23,771 --> 01:11:25,241
- Wait. - This is the hallway.

2024
01:11:25,242 --> 01:11:26,611
Can this be real?

2025
01:11:26,612 --> 01:11:28,252
- What? - Do we go downstairs?

2026
01:11:29,051 --> 01:11:31,351
- Where is this, though? - Where is this?

2027
01:11:32,421 --> 01:11:36,152
(This is a staircase.)

2028
01:11:36,351 --> 01:11:38,161
This is not an escape-room show.

2029
01:11:38,162 --> 01:11:39,191
(Ko Kyoung Pyo from "Great Escape")

2030
01:11:39,192 --> 01:11:41,060
- This isn't that kind of show. - Jae Seok, hold on.

2031
01:11:41,061 --> 01:11:42,131
What?

2032
01:11:42,761 --> 01:11:44,760
(She found something.)

2033
01:11:44,761 --> 01:11:46,300
- It says to push here. - What is this?

2034
01:11:46,301 --> 01:11:47,331
What?

2035
01:11:47,332 --> 01:11:48,701
- Hey. It says, "Push." - What is this?

2036
01:11:48,702 --> 01:11:49,801
It tells us to push it here.

2037
01:11:53,072 --> 01:11:54,201
It tells us to push it here.

2038
01:11:54,202 --> 01:11:56,310
(Opening)

2039
01:11:56,311 --> 01:11:57,711
Darn it. Hold on.

2040
01:11:57,982 --> 01:11:59,112
Did you almost swear?

2041
01:12:00,242 --> 01:12:02,811
- Gosh. I did almost swear. - What?

2042
01:12:03,782 --> 01:12:08,721
(The secret door opens when you push the button.)

2043
01:12:10,252 --> 01:12:12,021
- What? - What's going on?

2044
01:12:12,662 --> 01:12:14,121
- Hey. I knew it. - We have to go in quickly.

2045
01:12:14,122 --> 01:12:16,191
- This is interesting. - Yes. It's so interesting.

2046
01:12:16,192 --> 01:12:18,460
- For the last spot... - It's fun.

2047
01:12:18,461 --> 01:12:19,531
The last spot ought...

2048
01:12:19,532 --> 01:12:20,600
- to have a kick to it. - Right.

2049
01:12:20,601 --> 01:12:21,970
- It's fun. - I know, right?

2050
01:12:21,971 --> 01:12:23,531
- It opened. - This is so fun.

2051
01:12:23,532 --> 01:12:24,871
- Please push it. - I thought this would open,

2052
01:12:24,872 --> 01:12:26,170
so I was looking at this.

2053
01:12:26,171 --> 01:12:27,270
I know. I was watching that too.

2054
01:12:27,271 --> 01:12:28,970
- But this opened. - I thought "Do we go in like this?"

2055
01:12:28,971 --> 01:12:30,041
(Do we go in like this?)

2056
01:12:30,042 --> 01:12:31,311
Shall we go inside?

2057
01:12:33,482 --> 01:12:35,411
- Gosh. - Goodness.

2058
01:12:35,412 --> 01:12:37,010
- It's an automatic door. - An automatic door.

2059
01:12:37,011 --> 01:12:38,122
Gosh. Hello.

2060
01:12:40,421 --> 01:12:43,851
(After going through another secret door, )

2061
01:12:45,061 --> 01:12:48,961
(what will unfold before their eyes?)

2062
01:12:49,761 --> 01:12:51,930
- Gosh. Hello. - Hello.

2063
01:12:51,931 --> 01:12:53,800
- Hello. Welcome. - Goodness.

2064
01:12:53,801 --> 01:12:54,971
(Amazed)

2065
01:12:55,101 --> 01:12:56,771
- Hello. - Hello.

2066
01:12:57,072 --> 01:12:58,100
Gosh. It's awesome.

2067
01:12:58,101 --> 01:13:01,411
It wasn't easy to find this place.

2068
01:13:01,412 --> 01:13:03,871
I wanted to give the customers a fun experience.

2069
01:13:03,872 --> 01:13:05,840
So, I adapted the speakeasy style...

2070
01:13:05,841 --> 01:13:07,680
that was popular...

2071
01:13:07,681 --> 01:13:10,050
during the Prohibition era in the US...

2072
01:13:10,051 --> 01:13:11,752
- The Prohibition. - to the bar.

2073
01:13:11,982 --> 01:13:14,351
We don't do any promotions.

2074
01:13:14,921 --> 01:13:16,720
I thought it'd be better...

2075
01:13:16,721 --> 01:13:18,460
to rely only on word of mouth.

2076
01:13:18,461 --> 01:13:20,391
(One of the hottest bars today by word of mouth)

2077
01:13:21,061 --> 01:13:24,131
(A secret place hidden so that no one can find it)

2078
01:13:25,032 --> 01:13:29,002
(When you push a button while facing the mirror, )

2079
01:13:30,572 --> 01:13:34,072
(the place unfolds beyond the secret door.)

2080
01:13:34,671 --> 01:13:37,340
Since we're located in Myeong-dong,

2081
01:13:37,341 --> 01:13:39,441
we adapted the concept of the Geunjeongjeon Hall.

2082
01:13:39,442 --> 01:13:40,511
(It embodies the Geunjeongjeon Hall of the Gyeongbokgung Palace.)

2083
01:13:41,452 --> 01:13:44,010
We tried to bring in Korean-ness...

2084
01:13:44,011 --> 01:13:45,681
when designing the interior.

2085
01:13:46,051 --> 01:13:47,520
They look familiar.

2086
01:13:47,521 --> 01:13:49,520
But we also tried to bring the unfamiliar and fun things...

2087
01:13:49,521 --> 01:13:50,952
in a Korean way.

2088
01:13:51,322 --> 01:13:53,060
The bar gets full every day.

2089
01:13:53,061 --> 01:13:55,031
The tourists from all around the world...

2090
01:13:55,032 --> 01:13:57,060
visit us when they're in Korea.

2091
01:13:57,061 --> 01:13:59,532
The average monthly sales is about 80,000 to 90,000 dollars.

2092
01:14:00,301 --> 01:14:03,372
(This is truly a world-wide bar.)

2093
01:14:04,101 --> 01:14:05,640
(A bar in the middle of Myeong-dong that's crazy about Korea)

2094
01:14:05,641 --> 01:14:08,412
Sixth Sense members, is this place real?

2095
01:14:10,612 --> 01:14:13,181
Gosh. This place is so pretty.

2096
01:14:13,841 --> 01:14:15,550
(Splendid cabinets with inlaid mother-of-pearl...)

2097
01:14:15,551 --> 01:14:17,252
(grab one's eye.)

2098
01:14:17,381 --> 01:14:19,681
Mimi, you know what they're made of, right?

2099
01:14:19,921 --> 01:14:20,952
Jade!

2100
01:14:22,421 --> 01:14:24,251
(That's my blunt sister, indeed.)

2101
01:14:24,252 --> 01:14:26,260
- It's the abalone shell. - Really?

2102
01:14:26,261 --> 01:14:28,631
They use the abalone shell.

2103
01:14:28,862 --> 01:14:30,931
And the masters inlaid with it by hand.

2104
01:14:31,532 --> 01:14:33,931
- One by one? - That's how they made the cabinets.

2105
01:14:34,202 --> 01:14:36,101
(Let's see.)

2106
01:14:36,902 --> 01:14:39,002
But it feels like a set.

2107
01:14:39,502 --> 01:14:42,340
- Right? It does feel like it. - It does feel like a set.

2108
01:14:42,341 --> 01:14:45,782
If they were to build a set, they'd build it like this.

2109
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:49,481
But they won't set up such doors.

2110
01:14:49,482 --> 01:14:52,321
Did the tvN's set-dressing team make such a fun thing?

2111
01:14:52,322 --> 01:14:53,880
Those doors.

2112
01:14:53,881 --> 01:14:56,152
It's a real bar.

2113
01:14:56,992 --> 01:14:58,862
But originally, it didn't have this vibe.

2114
01:15:00,091 --> 01:15:01,332
I want to look around.

2115
01:15:02,362 --> 01:15:04,090
- Can we look around? - Go ahead.

2116
01:15:04,091 --> 01:15:05,202
- Okay. - Can we do that?

2117
01:15:06,131 --> 01:15:08,231
- You look a little nervous. - No, I'm not.

2118
01:15:08,232 --> 01:15:09,572
We're keen.

2119
01:15:10,232 --> 01:15:11,270
We're very sharp.

2120
01:15:11,271 --> 01:15:12,941
(They examine the space to show off their sharpness.)

2121
01:15:12,942 --> 01:15:14,471
(Touching carelessly)

2122
01:15:16,211 --> 01:15:18,281
- What? There's another space. - What is this space?

2123
01:15:18,282 --> 01:15:20,542
(Did Kyoung Pyo find a new space from the start?)

2124
01:15:20,841 --> 01:15:23,051
(Did a new space open by Kyoung Pyo's touch?)

2125
01:15:23,412 --> 01:15:25,282
- What is this space? - Wasn't it the entrance?

2126
01:15:26,082 --> 01:15:27,521
- Wasn't it the entrance? - Right.

2127
01:15:29,692 --> 01:15:32,362
(They came through it just 5 minutes ago.)

2128
01:15:32,561 --> 01:15:33,992
What is he doing?

2129
01:15:34,692 --> 01:15:36,261
Hey, you two. Don't stay together.

2130
01:15:37,131 --> 01:15:40,362
"What is this space?" We entered through it.

2131
01:15:40,631 --> 01:15:43,032
- Is this the entrance? - Yes.

2132
01:15:44,101 --> 01:15:47,141
(The automatic door was interesting 5 minutes ago too.)

2133
01:15:47,742 --> 01:15:50,072
(Ms. Song is gasping after laughing so much.)

2134
01:15:50,641 --> 01:15:52,411
(An encore in the middle of it)

2135
01:15:52,412 --> 01:15:54,680
- I want to keep pushing it. - Gosh.

2136
01:15:54,681 --> 01:15:55,710
It's hilarious.

2137
01:15:55,711 --> 01:15:58,122
You two. He said, "What is this?" and Mimi was shocked.

2138
01:15:59,252 --> 01:16:00,321
(The blunt siblings look extraordinary from day one.)

2139
01:16:00,322 --> 01:16:01,721
What are they doing?

2140
01:16:02,021 --> 01:16:04,020
Why don't you stay away from each other?

2141
01:16:04,021 --> 01:16:05,291
(For the sake of guessing)

2142
01:16:05,292 --> 01:16:06,621
I'll check the restroom.

2143
01:16:06,622 --> 01:16:08,832
There might be detail in the restroom we can check.

2144
01:16:10,032 --> 01:16:12,431
(Meanwhile, Jae Seok snoops around the inside.)

2145
01:16:12,601 --> 01:16:14,202
What is this? There's something inside.

2146
01:16:15,532 --> 01:16:17,770
These are the drawers they use in an herbal medicine shop.

2147
01:16:17,771 --> 01:16:18,841
Yes.

2148
01:16:20,341 --> 01:16:22,072
But they have something like this. Look.

2149
01:16:22,442 --> 01:16:24,811
- What? - The Bar's fourth birthday party.

2150
01:16:25,641 --> 01:16:26,680
- This is... - Fouth-year anniversary?

2151
01:16:26,681 --> 01:16:28,252
(A paper is stored inside as if it's for them to see it.)

2152
01:16:28,452 --> 01:16:31,421
(I wouldn't be in there for no reason.)

2153
01:16:32,082 --> 01:16:33,122
Hold on.

2154
01:16:34,021 --> 01:16:35,322
- It opened. - What?

2155
01:16:36,292 --> 01:16:37,890
(Something opened suddenly!)

2156
01:16:37,891 --> 01:16:39,292
- The door to the next room. - What?

2157
01:16:39,391 --> 01:16:40,421
Gosh. Darn.

2158
01:16:41,431 --> 01:16:42,532
I almost swore again.

2159
01:16:43,561 --> 01:16:44,862
My habit came out unintentionally.

2160
01:16:45,061 --> 01:16:46,832
- This... - When you pushed this,

2161
01:16:47,502 --> 01:16:48,872
- the door opened. - The door opens.

2162
01:16:49,232 --> 01:16:50,301
(Peeking)

2163
01:16:51,101 --> 01:16:53,041
There's another secret space here.

2164
01:16:53,042 --> 01:16:56,511
This must be a private room.

2165
01:16:57,141 --> 01:16:58,741
- I see. - It's a private room.

2166
01:16:58,742 --> 01:16:59,742
(A private room that appears when they push the button?)

2167
01:17:01,211 --> 01:17:05,122
(Is it a secret space that they've fabricated?)

2168
01:17:05,452 --> 01:17:06,982
- This is... - This place is interesting.

2169
01:17:07,652 --> 01:17:10,621
- It's surely a bar. - They are old bottles.

2170
01:17:10,622 --> 01:17:11,622
(The alcohols the customers kept are stored here too.)

2171
01:17:11,992 --> 01:17:14,491
If there isn't a special occasion,

2172
01:17:14,492 --> 01:17:16,630
- the staff would get changed here. - That must be it.

2173
01:17:16,631 --> 01:17:18,202
- How do we get out? - Hey.

2174
01:17:18,502 --> 01:17:20,502
- Gosh. How do we get out? - Mimi.

2175
01:17:20,601 --> 01:17:22,031
- Hey, Mimi. - Mimi.

2176
01:17:22,032 --> 01:17:23,071
How do we get out?

2177
01:17:23,072 --> 01:17:24,101
(They are locked up.)

2178
01:17:24,301 --> 01:17:26,100
(Mimi, where are you?)

2179
01:17:26,101 --> 01:17:27,171
Hey, Mimi.

2180
01:17:28,112 --> 01:17:29,741
(Find the button.)

2181
01:17:29,742 --> 01:17:30,841
(Touching)

2182
01:17:31,982 --> 01:17:33,441
(Mimi is still searching through the restroom.)

2183
01:17:33,442 --> 01:17:34,611
Me? Are they calling me?

2184
01:17:34,612 --> 01:17:35,851
(Mimi is still searching through the restroom.)

2185
01:17:36,612 --> 01:17:37,612
I don't see one.

2186
01:17:37,613 --> 01:17:38,822
(There's no button.)

2187
01:17:39,021 --> 01:17:40,782
- Mimi, push the... It worked. - Mimi.

2188
01:17:40,982 --> 01:17:42,021
We're good.

2189
01:17:42,692 --> 01:17:45,692
- Where's Mimi? - We can't open from inside.

2190
01:17:46,021 --> 01:17:48,491
- We should be able to get out. - There are many secret spaces.

2191
01:17:48,492 --> 01:17:49,531
(They are confused by the fishy secret space.)

2192
01:17:49,532 --> 01:17:51,631
It opens when we push the button.

2193
01:17:51,902 --> 01:17:53,901
This is interesting. Only this draw is marked.

2194
01:17:53,902 --> 01:17:55,131
(Is the entrance-only button real?)

2195
01:17:55,572 --> 01:17:58,270
It feels like an escape room.

2196
01:17:58,271 --> 01:17:59,542
- Yes. - Exactly.

2197
01:18:00,171 --> 01:18:01,841
They must have changed the existing escape room.

2198
01:18:02,242 --> 01:18:04,141
- What? - Right?

2199
01:18:05,011 --> 01:18:07,011
- Right? - It's too small for an escape room.

2200
01:18:07,282 --> 01:18:08,482
- Is that so? - Is it?

2201
01:18:09,311 --> 01:18:10,511
There are so many hidden spaces.

2202
01:18:10,952 --> 01:18:12,981
Why did you ruin the mood when we were excited?

2203
01:18:12,982 --> 01:18:14,452
(Did you have to ruin our mood?)

2204
01:18:15,051 --> 01:18:16,721
I didn't ruin the mood. I said the truth.

2205
01:18:17,292 --> 01:18:19,520
- They have something like this. - Is it an autograph?

2206
01:18:19,521 --> 01:18:21,122
An autograph stationery?

2207
01:18:21,931 --> 01:18:23,291
Visit...

2208
01:18:23,292 --> 01:18:24,631
Visit...

2209
01:18:24,832 --> 01:18:26,231
Visitors' book?

2210
01:18:26,232 --> 01:18:27,430
- "Stationery." - "Stationery."

2211
01:18:27,431 --> 01:18:29,630
(The blunt sister keeps making interesting comments.)

2212
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:30,770
I understood what you meant.

2213
01:18:30,771 --> 01:18:32,442
- A visitors' book. But she got it. - But I got it.

2214
01:18:33,271 --> 01:18:35,372
- Mimi, we got it. - I'm glad. Thank you.

2215
01:18:36,271 --> 01:18:37,271
(Mimi's dictionary)

2216
01:18:37,272 --> 01:18:38,340
They have one.

2217
01:18:38,341 --> 01:18:39,982
(Autograph stationery is a visitors' book.)

2218
01:18:40,641 --> 01:18:42,651
Okay. Come. We're done.

2219
01:18:42,652 --> 01:18:44,112
(Will they have special food in the extraordinary spot?)

2220
01:18:44,381 --> 01:18:47,082
I'll give 1 menu for 2 people.

2221
01:18:47,122 --> 01:18:48,122
(Staring)

2222
01:18:49,252 --> 01:18:50,351
This place also...

2223
01:18:51,521 --> 01:18:53,192
They have gochujang burrata.

2224
01:18:53,792 --> 01:18:55,031
They have mac and cheese...

2225
01:18:55,032 --> 01:18:56,260
- with aged kimchi too. - I know.

2226
01:18:56,261 --> 01:18:58,460
This is interesting too. They make risotto...

2227
01:18:58,461 --> 01:19:00,131
- with salted hairtail guts. - Exactly. I want to try it.

2228
01:19:00,702 --> 01:19:03,301
Since many foreigners visit us,

2229
01:19:03,532 --> 01:19:06,341
we add a Korean touch to the food,

2230
01:19:06,572 --> 01:19:09,011
so it would be easier for them to understand the food.

2231
01:19:10,471 --> 01:19:11,511
What is this?

2232
01:19:11,912 --> 01:19:15,011
This is our cocktail menu.

2233
01:19:15,252 --> 01:19:18,010
Even the menu...

2234
01:19:18,011 --> 01:19:19,421
- is special, right? - Yes.

2235
01:19:21,051 --> 01:19:23,822
- It's been used before. - It has a Korean vibe.

2236
01:19:24,391 --> 01:19:25,391
I'll get the pomegranate.

2237
01:19:25,692 --> 01:19:26,920
I'll try the cherry tomatoes and dates.

2238
01:19:26,921 --> 01:19:29,232
I knew you'd order it.

2239
01:19:29,332 --> 01:19:31,291
Somehow, I thought you'd choose that one.

2240
01:19:31,292 --> 01:19:33,930
I'm going to try the cherry tomatoes and dates.

2241
01:19:33,931 --> 01:19:34,970
- Gosh. - Okay.

2242
01:19:34,971 --> 01:19:36,332
He's going to show us how he makes it.

2243
01:19:37,101 --> 01:19:38,202
(Thumping)

2244
01:19:39,442 --> 01:19:40,901
(Amazed)

2245
01:19:40,902 --> 01:19:43,941
- Like this. - He does this for real, right?

2246
01:19:43,942 --> 01:19:46,042
(Does he emit a real bartender vibe with the snaps?)

2247
01:19:46,242 --> 01:19:48,710
I make cocktails using the fruits in season.

2248
01:19:48,711 --> 01:19:52,051
(Are they real skills from his long experience?)

2249
01:19:52,152 --> 01:19:54,921
This is sikhye cocktail for Kyoung Pyo.

2250
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:57,420
As you've read,

2251
01:19:57,421 --> 01:19:59,792
it uses one of the American whiskey as its base.

2252
01:20:00,061 --> 01:20:02,691
It's the corn whiskey that is high in corn.

2253
01:20:02,692 --> 01:20:03,692
(Sikhye cocktail with corn whiskey)

2254
01:20:04,591 --> 01:20:05,630
(Sipping)

2255
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:07,961
(He takes a sip as soon as he get it.)

2256
01:20:08,061 --> 01:20:09,671
- How is it? - It's good.

2257
01:20:10,032 --> 01:20:12,872
It's good. I looked carefully, and it's not a store-bought sikhye.

2258
01:20:12,942 --> 01:20:15,571
It's because I can see the additives...

2259
01:20:15,572 --> 01:20:17,541
you add when making sikhye.

2260
01:20:17,542 --> 01:20:18,612
(A hand-made sikhye with visible additives?)

2261
01:20:19,141 --> 01:20:21,311
This is the pomegranate. It looks like tea.

2262
01:20:21,681 --> 01:20:22,751
- It's pretty. - It's cold.

2263
01:20:22,752 --> 01:20:24,550
(A cocktail that adds pomegranate grains...)

2264
01:20:24,551 --> 01:20:26,351
(to black raspberry syrup, served in a teacup)

2265
01:20:29,452 --> 01:20:31,961
(The eyebrows of the truth)

2266
01:20:32,192 --> 01:20:36,591
Many think pomegranates are from overseas like the US.

2267
01:20:37,232 --> 01:20:40,130
Surprisingly, they are depicted in paintings by Shin Saimdang.

2268
01:20:40,131 --> 01:20:42,901
The pomegranates are often depicted.

2269
01:20:42,902 --> 01:20:45,901
The paintings you see...

2270
01:20:45,902 --> 01:20:47,441
are painted by my mother...

2271
01:20:47,442 --> 01:20:48,970
- as a hobby. - Is that so?

2272
01:20:48,971 --> 01:20:50,340
I displayed them.

2273
01:20:50,341 --> 01:20:52,341
- Your mother painted this? - Really?

2274
01:20:52,711 --> 01:20:54,681
It took two months for her to paint it.

2275
01:20:55,152 --> 01:20:58,180
- The coasters too. - The paintings on them?

2276
01:20:58,181 --> 01:20:59,221
Yes.

2277
01:20:59,322 --> 01:21:02,051
My mother's mother wrote the letters on the stairs.

2278
01:21:02,421 --> 01:21:03,891
She is a calligrapher.

2279
01:21:04,221 --> 01:21:05,720
She is a calligrapher.

2280
01:21:05,721 --> 01:21:07,461
(His family's love for Korea is brought up out of nowhere.)

2281
01:21:08,192 --> 01:21:09,630
(A mother who does folk paintings as a hobby...)

2282
01:21:09,631 --> 01:21:11,061
(and a caligrapher grandmother)

2283
01:21:11,431 --> 01:21:13,801
(Is his love for Korea instigated by his family?)

2284
01:21:14,832 --> 01:21:17,670
That means this place is real.

2285
01:21:17,671 --> 01:21:18,742
- I know. - Exactly.

2286
01:21:18,902 --> 01:21:21,242
His family is involved...

2287
01:21:21,641 --> 01:21:24,111
in Korean traditional culture.

2288
01:21:24,112 --> 01:21:25,441
- I know. - He's a bartender.

2289
01:21:25,442 --> 01:21:26,782
- He's influenced by his mother. - They're close to him.

2290
01:21:27,082 --> 01:21:28,612
- But on the one hand... - I know.

2291
01:21:29,181 --> 01:21:30,181
It's suspicious, right?

2292
01:21:30,182 --> 01:21:33,121
Does his family have to be involved?

2293
01:21:33,122 --> 01:21:35,621
The story behind it is a little...

2294
01:21:35,622 --> 01:21:38,020
His actions and gestures...

2295
01:21:38,021 --> 01:21:39,361
- look so real, - Right.

2296
01:21:39,362 --> 01:21:40,822
But when he speaks, it feels fake.

2297
01:21:41,521 --> 01:21:43,591
- Isn't it interesting? Right? - Right.

2298
01:21:43,692 --> 01:21:45,430
(The lengthy family story)

2299
01:21:45,431 --> 01:21:47,202
(Is the CEO real?)

2300
01:21:48,002 --> 01:21:50,002
- Excuse me. - Is this the gratin?

2301
01:21:50,101 --> 01:21:51,742
- It's the mac and cheese. - The mac and cheese.

2302
01:21:52,271 --> 01:21:53,442
- Is this the mac and cheese? - Yes.

2303
01:21:54,271 --> 01:21:56,511
The combination of cheese and kimchi...

2304
01:21:56,811 --> 01:21:58,242
is quite tasty.

2305
01:21:58,511 --> 01:22:00,541
So, I add aged kimchi to mac and cheese...

2306
01:22:00,542 --> 01:22:02,411
to give it a fresh twist.

2307
01:22:02,412 --> 01:22:03,412
(Covered in cheese, it goes straight into the oven.)

2308
01:22:03,413 --> 01:22:05,152
So, it feels familiar,

2309
01:22:05,622 --> 01:22:08,321
but also, the unfamiliar and the fun things...

2310
01:22:08,322 --> 01:22:09,550
are expressed in a Korean way.

2311
01:22:09,551 --> 01:22:10,591
(Is the mac and cheese with aged kimchi a real menu?)

2312
01:22:10,921 --> 01:22:11,921
Gosh. It is...

2313
01:22:13,261 --> 01:22:14,292
(Amazed)

2314
01:22:14,891 --> 01:22:15,891
Actually,

2315
01:22:16,761 --> 01:22:19,101
- I can smell kimchi right away. - Really?

2316
01:22:19,662 --> 01:22:21,162
It does contain kimchi.

2317
01:22:21,771 --> 01:22:22,930
(Since it's hot, he blows it to cool it down.)

2318
01:22:22,931 --> 01:22:24,401
(Biting)

2319
01:22:24,402 --> 01:22:25,402
Let's try it a little.

2320
01:22:26,171 --> 01:22:27,202
(Savoring)

2321
01:22:28,271 --> 01:22:29,310
It's so good.

2322
01:22:29,311 --> 01:22:30,311
(It's good, right?)

2323
01:22:30,971 --> 01:22:31,982
(Devouring)

2324
01:22:34,011 --> 01:22:35,611
(This is it.)

2325
01:22:35,612 --> 01:22:37,651
Gosh. The strong flavors taste better.

2326
01:22:37,652 --> 01:22:39,021
(The strong flavors taste better.)

2327
01:22:40,622 --> 01:22:41,622
- That's the way to go. - Yes.

2328
01:22:42,652 --> 01:22:43,721
Do we have risotto next?

2329
01:22:44,152 --> 01:22:45,362
The hairtail fish sauce.

2330
01:22:46,091 --> 01:22:47,822
- The salted hairtail guts. - Right. The salted hairtail guts.

2331
01:22:47,992 --> 01:22:50,891
We understood you no matter what.

2332
01:22:51,732 --> 01:22:54,761
- Right. We still can understand it. - Right?

2333
01:22:56,502 --> 01:22:57,572
I'm not that bright.

2334
01:22:57,971 --> 01:22:59,541
- I love it. - I'm a bit...

2335
01:22:59,542 --> 01:23:00,871
- Mimi, I love it. - I have many things to work on.

2336
01:23:00,872 --> 01:23:02,211
Please help me a lot.

2337
01:23:02,841 --> 01:23:05,511
- Risotto with salted hairtail guts? - Let's try it.

2338
01:23:07,942 --> 01:23:10,081
By using the Korean salted hairtail guts,

2339
01:23:10,082 --> 01:23:12,982
I add umami and Korean flavors...

2340
01:23:13,181 --> 01:23:16,792
to the Italian dish, risotto.

2341
01:23:17,521 --> 01:23:18,691
(Through mantecare, the technique to mix water and oil, )

2342
01:23:18,692 --> 01:23:19,821
(the flavors are enhanced.)

2343
01:23:19,822 --> 01:23:21,721
The foreigners visiting Korea...

2344
01:23:21,931 --> 01:23:24,731
find the familiar ingredients combined with Korean ones.

2345
01:23:24,732 --> 01:23:27,930
I made the dish using the synergy between the two.

2346
01:23:27,931 --> 01:23:29,301
(Salted hairtail guts bisque risotto)

2347
01:23:29,732 --> 01:23:31,572
(Tasting the risotto)

2348
01:23:36,211 --> 01:23:38,341
I can smell the salted hairtail guts right away.

2349
01:23:38,782 --> 01:23:39,841
Does it smell like it?

2350
01:23:40,612 --> 01:23:42,350
- It has the taste I like. - Really?

2351
01:23:42,351 --> 01:23:43,412
I like something like this.

2352
01:23:44,511 --> 01:23:45,822
It's not my cup of tea.

2353
01:23:46,622 --> 01:23:49,622
(Childish Yu returns with his appetite of a child.)

2354
01:23:50,752 --> 01:23:52,322
It doesn't really suit my taste.

2355
01:23:52,692 --> 01:23:53,821
- Sorry. - No wonder.

2356
01:23:53,822 --> 01:23:54,991
As soon as I looked at the menu,

2357
01:23:54,992 --> 01:23:56,630
- I mentioned salted hairtail guts. - Right.

2358
01:23:56,631 --> 01:23:58,292
He pretended not to hear me.

2359
01:23:59,032 --> 01:24:00,161
We have different tastes.

2360
01:24:00,162 --> 01:24:03,832
I don't eat salted hairtail guts that often.

2361
01:24:04,702 --> 01:24:05,970
I think it's delicious.

2362
01:24:05,971 --> 01:24:08,170
Right. The food is great too.

2363
01:24:08,171 --> 01:24:10,041
- It's good. - This is what I think.

2364
01:24:10,042 --> 01:24:11,310
If you are hanging out with your friends in Jung-gu...

2365
01:24:11,311 --> 01:24:12,541
for up to three rounds,

2366
01:24:12,542 --> 01:24:14,112
- this would be the perfect course. - Right.

2367
01:24:15,282 --> 01:24:16,710
- That was what it felt like. - It would be perfect.

2368
01:24:16,711 --> 01:24:18,310
Not thinking about which place is real or fake.

2369
01:24:18,311 --> 01:24:19,381
(Sixth Sense's tour recommendation: Pork belly, ice cream, Korean bar)

2370
01:24:20,322 --> 01:24:22,121
But the menu setup feels real.

2371
01:24:22,122 --> 01:24:23,591
- Right. - Right.

2372
01:24:25,122 --> 01:24:28,192
(Is the menu combination of Korean food and Western food real?)

2373
01:24:28,532 --> 01:24:30,191
(Looking intently)

2374
01:24:30,192 --> 01:24:34,060
If I want to use that room, I need to make a reservation, right?

2375
01:24:34,061 --> 01:24:35,970
Right. If you give me a call, I can save the room for you.

2376
01:24:35,971 --> 01:24:38,332
You're just thinking about hanging out with your friends.

2377
01:24:38,902 --> 01:24:40,241
(He's just thinking about hanging out with his friends...)

2378
01:24:40,242 --> 01:24:41,571
(instead of making deductions.)

2379
01:24:41,572 --> 01:24:42,871
That's filled inside of your head.

2380
01:24:42,872 --> 01:24:44,611
- What are you doing? - All he wants to do...

2381
01:24:44,612 --> 01:24:47,242
- is hang out with his friends. - What are you doing, Kyoung Pyo?

2382
01:24:47,942 --> 01:24:50,111
"I should come here." He keeps saying this.

2383
01:24:50,112 --> 01:24:51,582
(Kyoung Pyo loves eating whether it's real or fake.)

2384
01:24:51,952 --> 01:24:53,221
Based on how they looked,

2385
01:24:53,681 --> 01:24:55,551
when I entered the places,

2386
01:24:56,421 --> 01:24:58,890
there wasn't a place that felt like it was fake.

2387
01:24:58,891 --> 01:25:00,622
- Right. - Right. No place felt that way.

2388
01:25:00,921 --> 01:25:03,761
During the first two seasons,

2389
01:25:04,192 --> 01:25:06,162
- there were things set up. - Right.

2390
01:25:06,402 --> 01:25:08,300
But I didn't feel any of that today.

2391
01:25:08,301 --> 01:25:10,572
Then what's different this time?

2392
01:25:11,532 --> 01:25:13,442
There must be something fake in the details.

2393
01:25:14,171 --> 01:25:15,572
There's something fake in the details.

2394
01:25:16,042 --> 01:25:18,581
I think the second place is fake.

2395
01:25:18,582 --> 01:25:19,810
The tteokbokki and the salad were fine.

2396
01:25:19,811 --> 01:25:22,281
- Right. - Those two were fine.

2397
01:25:22,282 --> 01:25:25,151
The performance of grating the ice cream like cheese...

2398
01:25:25,152 --> 01:25:27,981
- was really nice, but the price... - Right.

2399
01:25:27,982 --> 01:25:30,321
- felt too cheap. - Right.

2400
01:25:30,322 --> 01:25:31,850
Why is that sold at five dollars?

2401
01:25:31,851 --> 01:25:33,390
- It doesn't make sense. - But I think I saw that place...

2402
01:25:33,391 --> 01:25:34,920
on social media.

2403
01:25:34,921 --> 01:25:37,161
(But I think I saw that place on social media.)

2404
01:25:37,162 --> 01:25:38,162
- Really? - I think I saw...

2405
01:25:38,162 --> 01:25:39,162
the ice cream-tteokbokki

2406
01:25:39,431 --> 01:25:40,431
- Really? - Yes.

2407
01:25:40,432 --> 01:25:43,231
I think I said, "There's something like this?"

2408
01:25:43,232 --> 01:25:46,140
- The tteokbokki seemed real. - Right.

2409
01:25:46,141 --> 01:25:47,571
Gosh, this is hard though.

2410
01:25:47,572 --> 01:25:49,611
- It's really hard. - It's really hard.

2411
01:25:49,612 --> 01:25:50,710
(Owner's long story, unique place that is like a maze, )

2412
01:25:50,711 --> 01:25:51,872
(dishes both of Korean food and Western food)

2413
01:25:52,282 --> 01:25:54,241
The real place has to be found.

2414
01:25:54,242 --> 01:25:55,680
- How do we do that? - How do we do that?

2415
01:25:55,681 --> 01:25:56,752
Gosh.

2416
01:25:57,082 --> 01:25:58,921
I didn't expect it to be this hard.

2417
01:25:59,252 --> 01:26:00,920
I have no idea.

2418
01:26:00,921 --> 01:26:02,591
Sixth Sense: City Tour.

2419
01:26:02,792 --> 01:26:04,821
It's not an individual battle. Decide on one answer together...

2420
01:26:04,822 --> 01:26:06,461
and choose one answer.

2421
01:26:06,761 --> 01:26:08,161
If you get the answer right,

2422
01:26:08,162 --> 01:26:10,531
one person out of the four will be randomly selected...

2423
01:26:10,532 --> 01:26:12,502
and be sent a coffee truck to their filming site.

2424
01:26:13,532 --> 01:26:14,960
- If you get the answer wrong, - What will happen?

2425
01:26:14,961 --> 01:26:17,231
One person out of the four will be randomly selected...

2426
01:26:17,232 --> 01:26:18,331
and a cringy sentimental post will have to be posted...

2427
01:26:18,332 --> 01:26:19,470
on their social media account...

2428
01:26:19,471 --> 01:26:20,800
without explaining about it for a day.

2429
01:26:20,801 --> 01:26:22,270
Oh, my gosh.

2430
01:26:22,271 --> 01:26:24,311
I should've brought down my Instagram account.

2431
01:26:24,572 --> 01:26:26,242
Can you give us an example of the post?

2432
01:26:26,412 --> 01:26:27,541
(The snow reminds me of you.)

2433
01:26:27,542 --> 01:26:28,710
(I think I now understand what pain is.)

2434
01:26:28,711 --> 01:26:32,351
(Cute penalties that suit the Sixth Sense concept)

2435
01:26:32,551 --> 01:26:34,521
I feel like news articles will be written based on them.

2436
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:36,220
"Teenager Syndrome."

2437
01:26:36,221 --> 01:26:37,692
"Arrival of Late Adolescence."

2438
01:26:38,192 --> 01:26:40,721
(It's time to make the final decision.)

2439
01:26:40,921 --> 01:26:41,921
I think it's the butter place.

2440
01:26:42,162 --> 01:26:43,261
- The butter place. - The butter place.

2441
01:26:43,391 --> 01:26:44,991
- The butter place feels suspicious. - Why?

2442
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:47,061
The way the owner...

2443
01:26:47,431 --> 01:26:51,100
looked and spoke...

2444
01:26:51,101 --> 01:26:53,001
- felt like she was an actress. - Really?

2445
01:26:53,002 --> 01:26:56,071
That was why I asked if she was an actress right away.

2446
01:26:56,072 --> 01:26:58,270
- She felt like an actress. - The owner of the butter place?

2447
01:26:58,271 --> 01:27:00,141
You didn't suspect anyone when you were eating.

2448
01:27:00,582 --> 01:27:02,581
(You're right.)

2449
01:27:02,582 --> 01:27:04,412
And the patrons that came all of a sudden.

2450
01:27:04,711 --> 01:27:05,920
Right. That was weird.

2451
01:27:05,921 --> 01:27:07,952
- That was weird. - That was really weird.

2452
01:27:08,082 --> 01:27:09,850
(What? There are patrons?)

2453
01:27:09,851 --> 01:27:11,721
(They even greeted each other.)

2454
01:27:11,851 --> 01:27:13,992
- Why weren't they stopped? - Right.

2455
01:27:14,622 --> 01:27:15,991
And that place opens at 5pm.

2456
01:27:15,992 --> 01:27:17,492
It wasn't the usual opening hours.

2457
01:27:18,461 --> 01:27:21,761
(The restaurant crazy for butter that brought in fake patrons?)

2458
01:27:21,902 --> 01:27:24,201
I wish the second place to be fake.

2459
01:27:24,202 --> 01:27:25,572
Me too.

2460
01:27:25,971 --> 01:27:28,270
Tteokbokki and ice cream makes sense.

2461
01:27:28,271 --> 01:27:29,571
- Right. - Right.

2462
01:27:29,572 --> 01:27:31,611
It's a restaurant in the college area,

2463
01:27:31,612 --> 01:27:35,282
but there's a dish with made with perilla seeds.

2464
01:27:35,782 --> 01:27:36,782
Would it work in that area?

2465
01:27:36,782 --> 01:27:37,782
(A dish made with perilla seeds that is uncommon in the college area)

2466
01:27:38,082 --> 01:27:39,452
But I think it will be real.

2467
01:27:40,181 --> 01:27:42,191
What about the third place we just visited?

2468
01:27:42,192 --> 01:27:43,921
I wish this place to be real.

2469
01:27:44,492 --> 01:27:46,161
That's just your personal wish.

2470
01:27:46,162 --> 01:27:47,420
He just wants to find a place to hang out with his friends.

2471
01:27:47,421 --> 01:27:48,791
That's just what you want.

2472
01:27:48,792 --> 01:27:50,431
- It's his personal wish. - It's your personal wish, right?

2473
01:27:51,761 --> 01:27:53,060
Isn't the third place impossible to create?

2474
01:27:53,061 --> 01:27:54,532
Isn't it impossible to make a place like that?

2475
01:27:55,032 --> 01:27:57,231
And the story he talked about.

2476
01:27:57,232 --> 01:27:58,300
We didn't even ask him,

2477
01:27:58,301 --> 01:27:59,971
- but he talked about it so well. - Right.

2478
01:28:00,702 --> 01:28:04,211
(The owner's story that felt like it was from a script)

2479
01:28:04,372 --> 01:28:06,741
- Why was that mentioned? - It felt unnatural.

2480
01:28:06,742 --> 01:28:07,742
Right.

2481
01:28:07,743 --> 01:28:08,752
(The owner worked hard to memorize the script?)

2482
01:28:09,051 --> 01:28:10,911
Gosh, this is hard.

2483
01:28:10,912 --> 01:28:13,020
- We have to go with one answer. - Right.

2484
01:28:13,021 --> 01:28:14,220
- Right. - Just one answer.

2485
01:28:14,221 --> 01:28:15,951
But I don't think there's anyone here...

2486
01:28:15,952 --> 01:28:17,652
that will be strong about their opinion.

2487
01:28:18,521 --> 01:28:21,420
- We will go with any answer. - You're right about that.

2488
01:28:21,421 --> 01:28:22,930
(Totally blunt)

2489
01:28:22,931 --> 01:28:23,931
We'll just decide on an answer.

2490
01:28:23,992 --> 01:28:26,832
There's no one here that will be strong about their opinion.

2491
01:28:27,131 --> 01:28:28,232
Then...

2492
01:28:29,301 --> 01:28:30,532
shall we play rock-paper-scissors to decide?

2493
01:28:30,832 --> 01:28:32,202
(Laughing)

2494
01:28:32,402 --> 01:28:33,941
- Sounds good. - Sounds good.

2495
01:28:33,942 --> 01:28:34,970
- Sounds good. - Sounds good.

2496
01:28:34,971 --> 01:28:36,670
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

2497
01:28:36,671 --> 01:28:38,510
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

2498
01:28:38,511 --> 01:28:40,411
(Kyoung Pyo becomes the one to decide.)

2499
01:28:40,412 --> 01:28:41,581
All right. It's Kyoung Pyo.

2500
01:28:41,582 --> 01:28:42,651
- This is so scary. - Make a decision.

2501
01:28:42,652 --> 01:28:43,810
- There's nothing you can do. - Right.

2502
01:28:43,811 --> 01:28:44,880
All right. Make a decision.

2503
01:28:44,881 --> 01:28:46,050
(Which place will Kyoung Pyo choose to be fake?)

2504
01:28:46,051 --> 01:28:47,481
(Torn)

2505
01:28:47,482 --> 01:28:48,482
I will...

2506
01:28:49,921 --> 01:28:52,891
(It's all up to Kyoung Pyo now!)

2507
01:28:55,322 --> 01:28:57,161
choose the 2nd place. No. I will choose the 1st place!

2508
01:28:57,162 --> 01:28:58,162
- What? - The first place.

2509
01:28:58,163 --> 01:28:59,300
- Why? - A change of mind?

2510
01:28:59,301 --> 01:29:01,531
I'm so curious about the patrons.

2511
01:29:01,532 --> 01:29:03,430
- "Are you Japanese?" - Right.

2512
01:29:03,431 --> 01:29:04,572
Are you sure?

2513
01:29:04,732 --> 01:29:05,770
You chose the 2nd place and switched to the 1st place.

2514
01:29:05,771 --> 01:29:06,800
Yes. I'll go with the first place.

2515
01:29:06,801 --> 01:29:08,671
- Right. - Go with your decision.

2516
01:29:09,242 --> 01:29:11,670
The answer will be revealed.

2517
01:29:11,671 --> 01:29:13,612
It's the 1st or 2nd place.

2518
01:29:14,242 --> 01:29:16,011
(Have you imagined to see Sixth Sense from the past?)

2519
01:29:16,452 --> 01:29:17,681
(Then...)

2520
01:29:18,181 --> 01:29:19,282
We're wrong?

2521
01:29:19,822 --> 01:29:21,752
- What is it? - What?

2522
01:29:22,021 --> 01:29:23,091
(Longest time spent)

2523
01:29:23,192 --> 01:29:24,192
(Most staff members used)

2524
01:29:25,492 --> 01:29:26,492
What's going on?

2525
01:29:28,591 --> 01:29:31,931
(A long journey of up to 100 days)

2526
01:29:32,561 --> 01:29:34,130
(Sixth Sense: City Tour)

2527
01:29:34,131 --> 01:29:35,161
(The first travel destination)

2528
01:29:35,162 --> 01:29:37,671
It will be crazy if it's the third place.

2529
01:29:38,002 --> 01:29:39,872
(Which one is fake out of Jung-gu's hot places?)

2530
01:29:40,101 --> 01:29:41,340
(Butter)

2531
01:29:41,341 --> 01:29:42,941
- The butter place. - Gosh.

2532
01:29:42,942 --> 01:29:44,371
(Butter and pork belly)

2533
01:29:44,372 --> 01:29:46,140
It was really good though.

2534
01:29:46,141 --> 01:29:48,681
(A combination of greasy butter and greasy pork belly?)

2535
01:29:48,952 --> 01:29:50,010
(Ice cream)

2536
01:29:50,011 --> 01:29:51,011
The ice cream place.

2537
01:29:51,412 --> 01:29:52,921
(Ice cream and tteokbokki)

2538
01:29:53,381 --> 01:29:54,452
The ice cream place.

2539
01:29:54,752 --> 01:29:56,191
(Ice cream and salad)

2540
01:29:56,192 --> 01:29:58,151
The salad was good from the second place.

2541
01:29:58,152 --> 01:29:59,221
It was good.

2542
01:29:59,692 --> 01:30:01,260
(Korea)

2543
01:30:01,261 --> 01:30:03,031
(Myeong-dong's hot place crazy about tradition)

2544
01:30:03,032 --> 01:30:04,032
The Korean place.

2545
01:30:04,692 --> 01:30:07,161
(Korea added to everything)

2546
01:30:07,162 --> 01:30:08,162
This is so hard.

2547
01:30:08,163 --> 01:30:09,502
(Korea added to everything)

2548
01:30:11,931 --> 01:30:14,442
(Do they all feel real?)

2549
01:30:15,002 --> 01:30:16,011
What?

2550
01:30:16,412 --> 01:30:17,612
So which place is it?

2551
01:30:18,211 --> 01:30:19,380
Which place is it?

2552
01:30:19,381 --> 01:30:21,340
(What is the unexpected answer?)

2553
01:30:21,341 --> 01:30:22,351
The answer!

2554
01:30:23,482 --> 01:30:28,321
(Sixth Sense: City Tour has returned completely new.)

2555
01:30:28,322 --> 01:30:31,091
(The butter place chosen by the blunt siblings?)

2556
01:30:31,421 --> 01:30:33,191
- Please! What? - What?

2557
01:30:33,192 --> 01:30:35,630
(The ice cream place Jae Seok and Eun I felt suspicious about?)

2558
01:30:35,631 --> 01:30:37,460
(Out of the confusing choices...)

2559
01:30:37,461 --> 01:30:38,461
Number one!

2560
01:30:39,261 --> 01:30:40,261
Number one!

2561
01:30:41,631 --> 01:30:43,271
(The answer will be revealed now.)

2562
01:30:46,502 --> 01:30:47,600
- What? - What?

2563
01:30:47,601 --> 01:30:48,941
(Number 2, the owner crazy about ice cream)

2564
01:30:48,942 --> 01:30:49,942
What?

2565
01:30:50,412 --> 01:30:51,941
- Gosh! - Gosh!

2566
01:30:51,942 --> 01:30:52,942
What?

2567
01:30:54,011 --> 01:30:56,181
(That can't be true.)

2568
01:30:57,351 --> 01:30:59,021
(It's not the butter place?)

2569
01:30:59,582 --> 01:31:00,582
Really?

2570
01:31:00,652 --> 01:31:01,720
Why did you change the answer?

2571
01:31:01,721 --> 01:31:03,420
We should've just gone with it!

2572
01:31:03,421 --> 01:31:05,550
- Gosh! - Gosh, Kyoung Pyo!

2573
01:31:05,551 --> 01:31:07,590
- It was the second place! - Kyoung Pyo!

2574
01:31:07,591 --> 01:31:09,491
The perilla seed dish didn't work with it!

2575
01:31:09,492 --> 01:31:11,231
It felt weird!

2576
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:12,430
Gosh, the perilla seed dish!

2577
01:31:12,431 --> 01:31:14,232
(Why did you do that, me of the past?)

2578
01:31:14,601 --> 01:31:15,831
Kyoung Pyo!

2579
01:31:15,832 --> 01:31:18,942
But you also said it was the first place earlier!

2580
01:31:19,402 --> 01:31:21,470
You also strongly said it was the first place!

2581
01:31:21,471 --> 01:31:22,671
- Gosh! - But...

2582
01:31:23,072 --> 01:31:25,412
it wasn't like I knew the answer.

2583
01:31:25,841 --> 01:31:26,881
- Gosh! - Gosh!

2584
01:31:27,181 --> 01:31:28,411
I should've just gone with number two.

2585
01:31:28,412 --> 01:31:29,881
- You should've just... - Gosh.

2586
01:31:30,452 --> 01:31:31,452
My gosh.

2587
01:31:31,453 --> 01:31:34,081
- I knew something was off. - But...

2588
01:31:34,082 --> 01:31:35,921
what about the two young and reliable owners?

2589
01:31:36,152 --> 01:31:37,321
- They're fake? - Those two...

2590
01:31:37,322 --> 01:31:38,492
- are fake too? - They're just liars?

2591
01:31:39,322 --> 01:31:41,221
(Viewers who are watching the show)

2592
01:31:41,391 --> 01:31:42,862
My gosh.

2593
01:31:43,461 --> 01:31:44,461
Gosh.

2594
01:31:45,061 --> 01:31:46,431
"Ice cream-tteokbokki."

2595
01:31:46,832 --> 01:31:47,901
This is actually a thing?

2596
01:31:47,902 --> 01:31:49,231
(You said it was fake.)

2597
01:31:49,232 --> 01:31:50,970
Right. I remember seeing it.

2598
01:31:50,971 --> 01:31:52,572
(Ice cream-tteokbokki)

2599
01:31:53,641 --> 01:31:54,871
- What is that? - It's an actual place!

2600
01:31:54,872 --> 01:31:56,471
- It's there! - It's there!

2601
01:31:56,572 --> 01:31:58,840
- What? - It's a place that can be searched.

2602
01:31:58,841 --> 01:32:01,211
- It's there! - I saw that place.

2603
01:32:01,282 --> 01:32:03,380
(Reviews)

2604
01:32:03,381 --> 01:32:04,381
There are reviews too!

2605
01:32:04,382 --> 01:32:05,752
- There are reviews. - It's an actual place.

2606
01:32:06,252 --> 01:32:08,251
(It's on Instagram and YouTube as well.)

2607
01:32:08,252 --> 01:32:09,992
I saw it on Instagram.

2608
01:32:10,391 --> 01:32:12,760
- It's on social media. - Right.

2609
01:32:12,761 --> 01:32:14,491
- Even those posts are fake? - No way!

2610
01:32:14,492 --> 01:32:16,332
No way! Even the Instagram posts?

2611
01:32:16,761 --> 01:32:18,662
(Sixth Sense: City Tour is completely different.)

2612
01:32:18,931 --> 01:32:22,601
(Sixth Sense that has changed not only fools the members.)

2613
01:32:23,671 --> 01:32:24,671
What?

2614
01:32:24,672 --> 01:32:25,800
(The viewers are fooled as well.)

2615
01:32:25,801 --> 01:32:27,471
- No way. - Gosh.

2616
01:32:28,471 --> 01:32:30,111
(We have worked with this person.)

2617
01:32:30,112 --> 01:32:31,112
Who is that?

2618
01:32:34,011 --> 01:32:35,011
- What? - What?

2619
01:32:35,242 --> 01:32:37,482
- He's really famous. - Right.

2620
01:32:37,752 --> 01:32:40,180
I run a bakery cafe,

2621
01:32:40,181 --> 01:32:42,420
a Namdo-style meat restaurant,

2622
01:32:42,421 --> 01:32:43,720
- Gosh. - and a restaurant...

2623
01:32:43,721 --> 01:32:45,321
- with American home meals. - I know that place!

2624
01:32:45,322 --> 01:32:46,460
My name is Kim Hoon.

2625
01:32:46,461 --> 01:32:48,220
(Yongnidan-gil's Paik Jong Won, Chef Kim Hoon)

2626
01:32:48,221 --> 01:32:49,491
("Chef Kim Hoon: It's Important to Have Good Insight")

2627
01:32:49,492 --> 01:32:51,760
(The rising chef that captured the hearts of Gen MZers)

2628
01:32:51,761 --> 01:32:53,031
(Annual sales)

2629
01:32:53,032 --> 01:32:54,032
(Around over 10 million dollars)

2630
01:32:54,033 --> 01:32:55,131
(Impressed)

2631
01:32:55,332 --> 01:32:58,130
(Chef Kim Hoon and Sixth Sense: City Tour got together.)

2632
01:32:58,131 --> 01:33:00,441
It was possible because this person created the dishes.

2633
01:33:00,442 --> 01:33:02,542
Are you serious?

2634
01:33:03,171 --> 01:33:04,340
Let's see what happened 100 days ago.

2635
01:33:04,341 --> 01:33:06,140
This was prepared for quite a long time.

2636
01:33:06,141 --> 01:33:07,710
It has to be something good that looks shocking as well.

2637
01:33:07,711 --> 01:33:10,680
Something that would certainly become viral.

2638
01:33:10,681 --> 01:33:13,621
It would be easy to just recommend restaurant dishes.

2639
01:33:13,622 --> 01:33:14,721
But the place...

2640
01:33:14,952 --> 01:33:16,951
- has to be run for real. - Right.

2641
01:33:16,952 --> 01:33:18,191
(The place has to be run for real.)

2642
01:33:18,192 --> 01:33:19,192
- It was actually open? - Gosh.

2643
01:33:19,921 --> 01:33:21,361
The place was actually open?

2644
01:33:21,362 --> 01:33:22,831
That must be why there were reviews.

2645
01:33:22,832 --> 01:33:24,231
- So what you saw was real. - Right.

2646
01:33:24,232 --> 01:33:25,561
It was real.

2647
01:33:25,961 --> 01:33:27,331
(Sixth Sense: City Tour)

2648
01:33:27,332 --> 01:33:28,731
(Changing the paradigm of what is fake)

2649
01:33:28,732 --> 01:33:29,732
(For 2 months before the shoot, )

2650
01:33:29,733 --> 01:33:32,232
(the place was actually opened to others!)

2651
01:33:32,542 --> 01:33:34,771
- Hello. - Hello.

2652
01:33:35,141 --> 01:33:38,071
I looked around the place, and it looked really old.

2653
01:33:38,072 --> 01:33:39,581
How long has it been since you've been here?

2654
01:33:39,582 --> 01:33:41,340
We were students in this area.

2655
01:33:41,341 --> 01:33:42,451
- These people are real. - This was a place...

2656
01:33:42,452 --> 01:33:43,481
we came to all the time.

2657
01:33:43,482 --> 01:33:44,880
May I ask about the sales...

2658
01:33:44,881 --> 01:33:46,822
of when you're doing well and when you're not doing well?

2659
01:33:46,952 --> 01:33:48,752
There was a time when we made no money at all.

2660
01:33:49,452 --> 01:33:51,020
During exam periods or vacation seasons,

2661
01:33:51,021 --> 01:33:53,920
there are times when we don't get any customers.

2662
01:33:53,921 --> 01:33:55,221
Right.

2663
01:33:55,992 --> 01:33:58,232
(He tries the existing dishes.)

2664
01:33:58,391 --> 01:34:01,461
There's no special kick for people to come all the way here for.

2665
01:34:01,601 --> 01:34:03,701
It should look unique...

2666
01:34:03,702 --> 01:34:06,841
or taste special for people to come for this.

2667
01:34:07,601 --> 01:34:08,970
(That was how it was created.)

2668
01:34:08,971 --> 01:34:10,670
Gosh, that's amazing.

2669
01:34:10,671 --> 01:34:12,371
Ice cream in tteokbokki can sound strange,

2670
01:34:12,372 --> 01:34:14,340
but there's a dish that we are all already used to.

2671
01:34:14,341 --> 01:34:15,380
There's the rose tteokbokki.

2672
01:34:15,381 --> 01:34:18,651
That is a dish that has cream in it.

2673
01:34:18,652 --> 01:34:20,381
(D-60, recipe taught)

2674
01:34:20,681 --> 01:34:21,720
(He taught the owners in crisis with a heart to help them.)

2675
01:34:21,721 --> 01:34:23,721
He gave them solutions to their dishes.

2676
01:34:24,051 --> 01:34:26,091
The customers love these sorts of performances.

2677
01:34:27,021 --> 01:34:28,060
(Dishes with performances that Gen MZers love)

2678
01:34:28,061 --> 01:34:29,261
We saw that!

2679
01:34:30,461 --> 01:34:31,531
Gosh.

2680
01:34:31,532 --> 01:34:33,431
That was why uncommon ingredients were used.

2681
01:34:33,902 --> 01:34:35,501
(All of the dishes have been developed.)

2682
01:34:35,502 --> 01:34:37,072
They must've felt really determined.

2683
01:34:37,171 --> 01:34:40,241
(D-30 before actual sales)

2684
01:34:40,242 --> 01:34:42,770
So the dishes were actually sold to others?

2685
01:34:42,771 --> 01:34:43,871
(From cooking to plating, )

2686
01:34:43,872 --> 01:34:44,941
(the owners began their special training.)

2687
01:34:44,942 --> 01:34:45,942
A total of 30 servings a day.

2688
01:34:45,943 --> 01:34:47,541
They became one with their dishes...

2689
01:34:47,542 --> 01:34:49,311
and that was why they sounded so natural.

2690
01:34:49,952 --> 01:34:52,211
Gosh!

2691
01:34:52,311 --> 01:34:54,282
(D-Day, start of business)

2692
01:34:54,551 --> 01:34:56,351
(Web portal)

2693
01:34:56,792 --> 01:34:58,192
It was what I saw online.

2694
01:34:58,992 --> 01:35:01,792
(They were added to the menu as well.)

2695
01:35:02,391 --> 01:35:04,060
No wonder.

2696
01:35:04,061 --> 01:35:05,090
(Pretending to have a history)

2697
01:35:05,091 --> 01:35:06,501
- Dad Tteokbokki! - Dad Tteokbokki!

2698
01:35:06,502 --> 01:35:08,260
That was on the wall.

2699
01:35:08,261 --> 01:35:09,771
(The ice cream for 100 people get prepared as well.)

2700
01:35:10,402 --> 01:35:12,640
(But...)

2701
01:35:12,641 --> 01:35:15,071
(what if the fake dishes don't get sold?)

2702
01:35:15,072 --> 01:35:16,340
Hello?

2703
01:35:16,341 --> 01:35:18,770
We want to inquire about Instagram promotion.

2704
01:35:18,771 --> 01:35:20,741
(To become a hot place, )

2705
01:35:20,742 --> 01:35:23,811
(promotion is a must.)

2706
01:35:24,082 --> 01:35:26,451
(Like other actual restaurants, )

2707
01:35:26,452 --> 01:35:29,492
(promotion content was created.)

2708
01:35:30,391 --> 01:35:31,550
- I can't believe these people. - They went this far?

2709
01:35:31,551 --> 01:35:32,992
This was what I actually saw.

2710
01:35:33,261 --> 01:35:36,090
- I saw it on Instagram. - You saw this, Mimi?

2711
01:35:36,091 --> 01:35:37,960
That was why you felt certain about this place.

2712
01:35:37,961 --> 01:35:39,761
- Right. - Gosh.

2713
01:35:40,332 --> 01:35:42,731
(With its unique looks and its spicy and sweet taste, )

2714
01:35:42,732 --> 01:35:44,770
- It was because you saw this. - Right.

2715
01:35:44,771 --> 01:35:46,401
(the dishes started getting popular through social media.)

2716
01:35:46,402 --> 01:35:48,170
I'm getting goosebumps.

2717
01:35:48,171 --> 01:35:51,170
(The customers came to try the fake dishes.)

2718
01:35:51,171 --> 01:35:52,241
What?

2719
01:35:52,242 --> 01:35:53,281
(Eating)

2720
01:35:53,282 --> 01:35:54,711
They are actual customers?

2721
01:35:55,442 --> 01:35:56,752
It was nice and savory.

2722
01:35:57,482 --> 01:35:58,810
- This is shocking. - We added more ice cream.

2723
01:35:58,811 --> 01:36:00,521
I think this is the perfect balance.

2724
01:36:01,082 --> 01:36:03,152
- You went this far? - What?

2725
01:36:03,292 --> 01:36:05,191
How was this possible?

2726
01:36:05,192 --> 01:36:06,260
(The new members get shocked.)

2727
01:36:06,261 --> 01:36:07,920
- It's "The Truman Show." - Gosh.

2728
01:36:07,921 --> 01:36:09,991
This is really making me have goosebumps.

2729
01:36:09,992 --> 01:36:11,060
Gosh.

2730
01:36:11,061 --> 01:36:13,032
(They started as fake dishes, )

2731
01:36:13,502 --> 01:36:15,971
(but actual customers came for them.)

2732
01:36:16,971 --> 01:36:19,600
(Sixth Sense and small business owners...)

2733
01:36:19,601 --> 01:36:22,641
(got together for the 100-day Mirage Menu Project.)

2734
01:36:23,211 --> 01:36:25,170
I'm getting goosebumps.

2735
01:36:25,171 --> 01:36:27,140
It's heartwarming and touching too.

2736
01:36:27,141 --> 01:36:29,282
I'm feeling a mixture of emotions.

2737
01:36:30,051 --> 01:36:31,051
Gosh.

2738
01:36:31,152 --> 01:36:33,322
So this is what this season feels like?

2739
01:36:33,921 --> 01:36:35,050
Is this what it's like?

2740
01:36:35,051 --> 01:36:38,220
So you're going to take over our daily lives too?

2741
01:36:38,221 --> 01:36:40,291
- Gosh. - That was well said.

2742
01:36:40,292 --> 01:36:41,292
- Was it okay? - It was great.

2743
01:36:41,293 --> 01:36:42,630
- They'll take over our daily lives. - How did you say...

2744
01:36:42,631 --> 01:36:43,931
that long sentence really well?

2745
01:36:45,931 --> 01:36:47,231
What's wrong?

2746
01:36:47,232 --> 01:36:48,362
What are you saying?

2747
01:36:48,631 --> 01:36:49,871
Well, Mimi...

2748
01:36:49,872 --> 01:36:52,770
- It was the longest line I said. - did a great job to sum it up.

2749
01:36:52,771 --> 01:36:55,640
But the owners can continue to sell these dishes.

2750
01:36:55,641 --> 01:36:58,170
If they wish to continue selling these dishes,

2751
01:36:58,171 --> 01:36:59,640
they will be added to their menu with further development.

2752
01:36:59,641 --> 01:37:00,911
(They will be sold with further development.)

2753
01:37:00,912 --> 01:37:02,380
It was done for a great cause.

2754
01:37:02,381 --> 01:37:03,881
- Gosh. - Gosh.

2755
01:37:04,181 --> 01:37:06,951
We just finished our first episode together.

2756
01:37:06,952 --> 01:37:08,081
I'm not sure.

2757
01:37:08,082 --> 01:37:09,951
I think the members here are nice.

2758
01:37:09,952 --> 01:37:12,961
(I think the members here are nice.)

2759
01:37:13,192 --> 01:37:14,362
I felt that too.

2760
01:37:14,761 --> 01:37:16,491
- They are really innocent. - Right.

2761
01:37:16,492 --> 01:37:18,191
They don't have any complaints.

2762
01:37:18,192 --> 01:37:19,361
- Right. - Right.

2763
01:37:19,362 --> 01:37:21,761
We were described to be blunt pencils.

2764
01:37:21,931 --> 01:37:23,401
We'll make sure to sharpen ourselves.

2765
01:37:23,402 --> 01:37:25,701
- To be sharper. - We'll become sharper.

2766
01:37:25,702 --> 01:37:26,872
(Check out Mimi's social media page for her penalty!)
