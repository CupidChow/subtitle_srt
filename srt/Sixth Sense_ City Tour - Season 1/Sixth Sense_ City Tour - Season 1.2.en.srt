1
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,229
(Where is this place we've come to early in the morning?)

2
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:25,440
(Hwaseomun Gate in Suwon, Gyeonggi Province)

3
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,408
(Good morning)

4
00:00:29,409 --> 00:00:32,780
(I send you a text)

5
00:00:33,749 --> 00:00:37,289
I brought the gloves Jae Suk bought for me.

6
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,549
Today's temperature is minus 12°C with wind chill.

7
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:42,019
But the actual temperature is 2°C.

8
00:00:42,489 --> 00:00:44,089
No, minus 2°C.

9
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:46,559
It's not accurate. Anyway,

10
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,499
that's how cold it is today.

11
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,999
(Anyway, it's very cold today.)

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,399
("The Coldest Day This Winter")

13
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,769
("The Peak of the Cold Wave")

14
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,669
Our director is only wearing a denim jacket,

15
00:00:57,839 --> 00:01:00,339
but he's still young. How old are you?

16
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,239
- I'm 43. - I see.

17
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,848
- Not that young. - I see.

18
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:05,949
(A young face)

19
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:09,220
That's a young age, 43.

20
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:11,518
I'll just keep walking.

21
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:13,319
("That's a young age, 43." by Mimi who is 29)

22
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:14,889
- Mimi is there. - Yes.

23
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,290
Mimi.

24
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:19,760
Where are you going, Mimi?

25
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:22,498
Oh, Jae Suk.

26
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:23,828
(Have you been well?)

27
00:01:23,829 --> 00:01:25,269
- Jae Suk. - Aren't you cold?

28
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:26,370
No, I'm not.

29
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,998
I wore something warm inside.

30
00:01:27,999 --> 00:01:29,198
- Oh, really? - I'm okay.

31
00:01:29,199 --> 00:01:30,769
I'll be your guide. Come here.

32
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:32,270
- Oh, up there? - Yes.

33
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,509
Oh, it's so cold today.

34
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:35,739
Oh, this is...

35
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,778
This... Where is this, Jae Suk?

36
00:01:37,779 --> 00:01:39,549
- This is Hwaseong, Suwon. - Hwaseong.

37
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:41,278
Oh, we need to be careful.

38
00:01:41,279 --> 00:01:43,179
- Be careful today. - It's so cold today.

39
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,248
Good morning.

40
00:01:44,249 --> 00:01:45,319
- Eun Yi. - Hello.

41
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,519
- Hello. - Good morning.

42
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,659
CEO Song.

43
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:50,188
- Good morning. - Good morning.

44
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:53,759
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

45
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,858
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

46
00:01:56,859 --> 00:01:59,599
- Happy birthday to Eun Yi - Happy birthday to Eun Yi

47
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,600
What is this?

48
00:02:00,601 --> 00:02:03,399
(Kyung Pyo hands her a congratulatory bouquet.)

49
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,039
It was actually last Friday.

50
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,879
- You're right. During our shoot. - Right.

51
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,009
- Right. - Oh, gosh.

52
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:11,608
- Congratulations. - It's so pretty.

53
00:02:11,609 --> 00:02:13,379
- Thank you. - Your hands must be cold.

54
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,049
- I'll hold it for you. - I got flowers from a man?

55
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,418
(Did I just get flowers from a man?)

56
00:02:16,419 --> 00:02:17,796
- How long has it been? - It's been a while.

57
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,119
- I think it might be my first time. - Really?

58
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,859
(Happy)

59
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,859
(I received my first bouquet at the age of 50.)

60
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:28,599
How did the color of our clothes end up this way?

61
00:02:29,029 --> 00:02:30,598
- You're right. - Black and white.

62
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,869
Let's stand by color.

63
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,869
- Seriously. - How did Eun Yi and I...

64
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,199
Let's stand by color.

65
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,269
How are we matching colors?

66
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,169
- Did you two call beforehand? - No.

67
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:41,378
- Because we're Generation MZ. - What did you do? Do you...

68
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:43,539
Do you two have your own group chat?

69
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,949
- That's not a group chat. - A group chat with two people.

70
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,348
A group chat isn't necessary for two people.

71
00:02:47,349 --> 00:02:48,519
If you two make a group chat,

72
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,679
- you'll be in trouble. - A group chat with two people.

73
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,295
You'll be in trouble if I catch you doing that.

74
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:53,049
(She just wants to be included in the Generation MZ room.)

75
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,159
Of course.

76
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:58,229
- So today, we've come to Suwon. - Yes.

77
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,330
Hwaseong, Suwon is very famous.

78
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,869
(Hwaseong, Suwon was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site.)

79
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,239
- King Jeongjo of Joseon... - That's right.

80
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,509
Built this Hwaseong castle.

81
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,680
(This large 5.74km castle is now a resting area for Suwon residents.)

82
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,979
- Aren't we standing on it now? - That's right.

83
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,878
We're standing on the castle walls.

84
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,879
(Our members are standing on a moment of history!)

85
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,788
- Mimi... - I just realized that.

86
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:27,920
Oh, really?

87
00:03:28,189 --> 00:03:30,318
- It wasn't the name of this area. - Pardon?

88
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,829
This is another place in Gyeonggi Province...

89
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,288
- called Hwaseong. - Oh, that's a different place.

90
00:03:33,289 --> 00:03:36,128
- Oh, I only know that place. - This is Hwaseong Castle in Suwon.

91
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:37,429
The name of this castle is Hwaseong.

92
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,129
- Right. - You know Hwaseong, right?

93
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:40,739
Not so well.

94
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,538
(Laughing)

95
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:44,469
(Hey, you too? Hey, me too.)

96
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,778
I like it.

97
00:03:47,779 --> 00:03:49,338
I like that confidence.

98
00:03:49,339 --> 00:03:51,308
- I like it. - We need to be honest.

99
00:03:51,309 --> 00:03:52,469
- You don't hold back. - Yes.

100
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,949
I like these two.

101
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:56,180
- I'm learning a lot. - I like it.

102
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,248
I'm acquiring a lot of knowledge.

103
00:03:58,249 --> 00:03:59,318
I'm sure.

104
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:01,459
You're really determined today.

105
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,558
We need to do that at least.

106
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:04,429
- We don't know much either. - We don't know much.

107
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,729
It was just in history books.

108
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:09,259
Suwon is so popular lately.

109
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,869
It's so popular among young people.

110
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,229
- For having good restaurants. - Oh, really?

111
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:14,938
Good restaurants, fun tourist attractions, and such.

112
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:16,568
(Find the fake among the trending places.)

113
00:04:16,569 --> 00:04:18,170
(What city will they explore today?)

114
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:23,009
(Suwon)

115
00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:28,079
(A city of history with the taste of the past well-preserved)

116
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:30,689
(And with trendy places that are rising in popularity, )

117
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:33,499
(Suwon has become a city of youth with many Generation MZers.)

118
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,720
(A mix of historical spots and urban areas, )

119
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:39,430
(Suwon is a charming city.)

120
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:44,399
(Among Suwon's trendy places we'll travel to today, )

121
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:49,800
(one fake place is hidden.)

122
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,239
(Will you be able to find the fake one?)

123
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,209
(Welcome.)

124
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:58,180
Oh, they filmed "Lovely Runner" here.

125
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,148
- You're right. - That's so cool.

126
00:05:00,149 --> 00:05:01,448
- The alleys. - Yes.

127
00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:02,850
- The alleys... - Sun Jae!

128
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,589
(Suddenly becoming Sol)

129
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,649
Sun Jae!

130
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,259
(I love you, Sol.)

131
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:14,099
(Sun Jae!)

132
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,558
(Shaking)

133
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:18,729
Hold on, my watch. I need to turn back time.

134
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,670
She's excited because it's a topic she knows.

135
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:23,299
I know Sun Jae. Sun Jae.

136
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,308
You're really amazing.

137
00:05:25,309 --> 00:05:26,939
(I love you, Sun Jae.)

138
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,008
Like last time, we'll give you a map for today.

139
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:30,479
- Oh, nice. - Here you are.

140
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,549
Oh, yes.

141
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,409
- We have three places today. - Yes.

142
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:34,748
- Chicken. - Dessert.

143
00:05:34,749 --> 00:05:36,078
- Skewers? - Yes.

144
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:39,990
(1. Chicken, 2. Dessert, 3. Skewers)

145
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,459
(Around Hwaseong, Suwon, )

146
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,860
(we'll try some unique foods.)

147
00:05:46,329 --> 00:05:47,859
(You can roast it, )

148
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,160
(and you can deep-fry it.)

149
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:51,730
(Chicken is always delicious.)

150
00:05:51,829 --> 00:05:54,199
(1. Chicken from Hwaseong)

151
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,069
(They draw you in with fancy looks and sweetness.)

152
00:05:57,809 --> 00:05:59,839
(Mimi's area of expertise, sweets)

153
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,240
(2. Dessert from Hwaseong)

154
00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:04,349
(People with childish tastes...)

155
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,680
(and people with mature tastes...)

156
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:09,350
(can all enjoy this snack.)

157
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:11,850
(3. Skewers from Hwaseong)

158
00:06:12,189 --> 00:06:13,318
(These three places in Suwon became trendy...)

159
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:14,458
(for their bizarre items.)

160
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:16,789
(Which one of these is fake?)

161
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,789
- There's dessert and skewers. - Yes.

162
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,429
Oh, we're eating well today.

163
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,059
- Seriously. - It must be tasty.

164
00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:23,998
On the way there,

165
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,729
I should check out Instagram a bit.

166
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:28,670
- We could get fooled again. - But we checked it last week...

167
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:29,939
and failed.

168
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,539
Oh, that's true.

169
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,768
Seriously...

170
00:06:32,769 --> 00:06:34,179
I didn't know the staff would even do that.

171
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,679
- I was so surprised. - Seriously.

172
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,479
And I didn't imagine they'd open beforehand.

173
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,909
- Seriously. - I really did not imagine that.

174
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:40,448
If it wasn't for that,

175
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:43,180
- we would've suspected that place. - Right.

176
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,789
- They fake real life. - They really do.

177
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,888
My real life. My destiny.

178
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:48,219
- Seriously. - Shall we get going?

179
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,459
- Yes. - Let's go.

180
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,359
We're walking along the castle wall.

181
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,489
- It's the path around the castle. - You're right.

182
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,198
I like that we have an open view.

183
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,429
(I like that we have an open view.)

184
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,998
- This neighborhood is so pretty. - I love it.

185
00:06:57,999 --> 00:06:59,398
- Seriously. - Isn't it nice?

186
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:02,199
It's much nicer than in the pictures or drawings.

187
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,439
The pigeons here... Why are they so...

188
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,609
(Surprised)

189
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,740
- They fly like that? - Seriously.

190
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,179
Oh, that's amazing.

191
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,480
(While they're entranced by the beautiful view, )

192
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:17,620
(behind a pole in the same space...)

193
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,818
(Sliding out)

194
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:20,819
This is so nice.

195
00:07:21,059 --> 00:07:22,589
(Hiding)

196
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,529
(Who is this suspicious silhouette?)

197
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:27,998
- My lips are freezing today. - Yes.

198
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,629
- My nose is really... - My nose...

199
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:32,698
- Right? - It feels like someone hit it.

200
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:34,939
- It's so numb. - My nose is so numb.

201
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,799
It's so nice to have you here.

202
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,808
(What is this cliche appearance?)

203
00:07:37,809 --> 00:07:38,869
- What? - What?

204
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,169
(Boo!)

205
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,610
- What? - What?

206
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,138
- Oh, my! - Oh, my!

207
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:45,309
- Oh, they found us! - Who is this?

208
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:46,979
- What? - What?

209
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,749
Oh, they found us!

210
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,948
What took you so long?

211
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:54,058
We were here for so long.

212
00:07:54,059 --> 00:07:56,758
(Hye Lyun's dance takes over Hwaseong, Suwon.)

213
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:58,729
Nice. There you go!

214
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,929
That's what I'm talking about.

215
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,128
(Wrapping up with Kyung Hwan's dance)

216
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:05,198
We have to jump around a bit. It's too cold.

217
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,498
- Oh, gosh. - Hey, Kyung Pyo.

218
00:08:06,499 --> 00:08:08,839
- Have you been well? - I have.

219
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,409
Actually, Kyung Pyo and I...

220
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:13,638
- did a cooking show together. - Right.

221
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:15,910
- With Paik Jong Won. - Then...

222
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:19,680
(These two became close while going around the country.)

223
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,119
I wanted to cheer him on and also hang out with him.

224
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,719
Oh, yes!

225
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,549
She's my CEO.

226
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,818
- Oh, right. - Yes.

227
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:30,159
- She's an artist in my agency. - Yes.

228
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,289
Did you not know?

229
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,628
- "Oh, right?" - What?

230
00:08:32,629 --> 00:08:34,758
- Oh, right. That's right! - Oh, right.

231
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:37,030
"Now that I think about it! Yes!"

232
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:39,828
- I came to cheer her on. - I see.

233
00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:41,346
(We came to hang out with our besties.)

234
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,439
- I didn't recognize you at first. - Why?

235
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,686
(But I didn't recognize you at first.)

236
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:45,839
(Hesitating)

237
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,939
I thought you were an old man.

238
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,409
(When he saw Hye Lyun from afar)

239
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:53,379
- What... - Fake.

240
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:54,979
Isn't Hye Lyun fake?

241
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,918
Say something for me.

242
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:58,049
But...

243
00:08:58,249 --> 00:09:00,289
You even emphasized that.

244
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:02,388
Sir. You're fake, aren't you?

245
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:05,060
- I'm a woman, not a man. - Oh, you're a woman.

246
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,959
You're laughing too hard.

247
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,099
- She was... - Oh, my goodness.

248
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,928
I noticed Kyung Hwan,

249
00:09:10,929 --> 00:09:12,668
but I thought she was some man at first.

250
00:09:12,669 --> 00:09:14,168
My hair looks too much like a helmet, doesn't it?

251
00:09:14,169 --> 00:09:15,316
(My hair looks too much like a helmet, doesn't it?)

252
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,440
Sir. Hold on.

253
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:19,469
(Laughing)

254
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,079
(The helmet lady is going hard right off the bat.)

255
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,439
I went to Cheongdam-dong too.

256
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,809
She went to Cheongdam-dong for hair and hamekup.

257
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:26,548
So... These two... Oh, gosh.

258
00:09:26,549 --> 00:09:28,080
I heard a chirping just now.

259
00:09:28,419 --> 00:09:29,849
- Oh, gosh. - But you...

260
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,850
Since it's cold, I'm even more sensitive.

261
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:34,288
(She makes them laugh every time she opens her mouth.)

262
00:09:34,289 --> 00:09:36,388
- Let's continue the conversation. - Oh, my goodness.

263
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:39,229
- I got it done in Cheongdam-dong. - Oh, Cheongdam-dong.

264
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,200
- At 6 in the morning. - Anyway,

265
00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:42,658
what is this?

266
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:45,028
It's my bag. I kept forgetting my phone.

267
00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:46,370
(He spotted a prey.)

268
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,199
I was wondering what was hanging from you.

269
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,999
It's like a Korean sock.

270
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,668
It's shaped like a Korean sock.

271
00:09:51,669 --> 00:09:54,638
So I sang "Anakkana" at the wedding...

272
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:57,278
- of a person who makes hanbok. - I see.

273
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,178
- She made me this phone bag. - It was a gift, I see.

274
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:02,178
- A phone bag. - The important thing...

275
00:10:02,179 --> 00:10:03,518
is that I forgot my phone.

276
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,789
(The important thing is that I forgot my phone.)

277
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,888
- Sir. - You have nice things at home.

278
00:10:08,889 --> 00:10:10,960
Why did you dress like this?

279
00:10:11,659 --> 00:10:13,590
You have many nice things.

280
00:10:13,659 --> 00:10:15,528
Oh, it's so funny!

281
00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:16,799
(Chirping)

282
00:10:19,299 --> 00:10:21,740
- Her phone. - I forgot my phone.

283
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,509
(Chirping)

284
00:10:26,909 --> 00:10:29,179
I should get my phone.

285
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:32,110
- Shall we get going? Let's go. - Okay.

286
00:10:32,249 --> 00:10:34,079
- I'll grab my phone. - Go ahead.

287
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,519
(Heading off to find the fake)

288
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,649
- Are we taking the bus? - There...

289
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,258
(The Suwon City Tour Bus was waiting for our members.)

290
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:43,060
- Hello. - What is this?

291
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,230
Oh, this...

292
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:47,189
Even the slogan is cool. "From records to memories."

293
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:50,059
(From records to memories)

294
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,599
That's the year Hwaseong Castle was built.

295
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,569
(That is when they built Hwaseong Castle.)

296
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,839
How do you know all of that?

297
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,240
- I'm so impressed. - It's nothing.

298
00:10:56,999 --> 00:10:58,070
Hello.

299
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,538
Oh, thank you.

300
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:03,509
- Check this out. - Why are the seats like this?

301
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:07,580
What is this bus for?

302
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,149
(They look around the bus.)

303
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:14,289
- What? - What?

304
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,918
- What? - What is this?

305
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:18,928
- Look next to you. - There's a screen right there.

306
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:20,998
- Oh, my! - Oh, this is so cool!

307
00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:22,528
- Amazing. - Amazing.

308
00:11:22,529 --> 00:11:23,759
What is this?

309
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:25,470
Look at this.

310
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,099
(Oh, my!)

311
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,038
It's haetae. Look.

312
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:30,299
What is this?

313
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,470
This is so cool.

314
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:34,439
- This is so cool! - Amazing.

315
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,209
(XR Bus, Extended Reality)

316
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:38,278
That's why it's called an XR bus.

317
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:39,908
- You're right. An XR bus. - Yes.

318
00:11:39,909 --> 00:11:42,629
(It uses technique that displays transparent videos on the windows.)

319
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,918
(Depending on the location)

320
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:49,989
- It feels like you're in history. - Yes.

321
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,589
(It displays various scenes of the 1795 Jeongjo Period.)

322
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,590
Look. The outside...

323
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,060
- has a 3D effect... - Really?

324
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,798
(Paldalmun Gate)

325
00:11:58,799 --> 00:11:59,870
This is so cool.

326
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,739
You can see the outside view at the same time.

327
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:06,539
(The actual view outside and the video match.)

328
00:12:06,909 --> 00:12:09,739
Seeing them together makes it feel so real.

329
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,809
It really feels like reality.

330
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:11,950
(Hwaseomun Gate)

331
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:18,518
(Hwaseong, Suwon was built starting in 1794...)

332
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:21,560
(abiding the wishes of King Jeongjo, the 22nd king.)

333
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,319
He's one of the kings that led the golden age...

334
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,759
- of the Joseon Period. - Right.

335
00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:27,369
Do you know who the father of King Jeongjo is?

336
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:29,298
(Tae, Jeong, Tae, Se, Mun, Dan, Se)

337
00:12:29,299 --> 00:12:32,869
(Using her whole brain)

338
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,316
(The 21st king, Yeongjo, The 22nd king, Jeongjo)

339
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,668
- King Yeongjo. - It's actually Crown Prince Sado.

340
00:12:35,669 --> 00:12:37,298
I see.

341
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:39,038
- Hye Lyun. - Yeongjo was his grandfather.

342
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,840
(Oh, right.)

343
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:44,038
Crown Prince Sado died locked in a rice chest.

344
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:45,279
- Right. - Right.

345
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:47,409
- Right. - That's so sad.

346
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,049
(Emotional Kyung Pyo)

347
00:12:49,419 --> 00:12:52,090
That's why King Jeongjo's tomb is near Suwon.

348
00:12:53,049 --> 00:12:55,659
His father, Crown Prince Sado's tomb is near here too.

349
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,400
They were buried next to each other.

350
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,960
(Yunggeolleung: The tombs of Crown Prince Sado and Jeongjo)

351
00:13:02,929 --> 00:13:05,569
I think these are drawings of a banquet.

352
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:06,999
- I see. - A banquet.

353
00:13:07,299 --> 00:13:09,138
They made it so that all citizens...

354
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:11,109
could come and see this parade.

355
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:13,908
It was normally a party for just the elite.

356
00:13:13,909 --> 00:13:15,979
I think he was such a good king.

357
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,679
To include all of the people.

358
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:21,249
- This is really nice. - This is so fun.

359
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,180
Why don't they have this in Seoul?

360
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:27,220
- Seriously. - They must be rushing to make it.

361
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,259
(Speechless)

362
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:33,589
- How old are you, Mimi? - I'm 29 now.

363
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:37,060
You get to enjoy all of this.

364
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:39,199
- This new technology... - Kyung Hwan. Do you not get to?

365
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,340
Aren't you enjoying it with us?

366
00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:42,899
I also...

367
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:45,769
I'm 45 now.

368
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,070
Really?

369
00:13:47,071 --> 00:13:49,080
- Kyung Hwan is already 45. - Yes.

370
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:51,209
You're 45. I'm 56.

371
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:53,249
(I, Hye Lyun, am fifty-six...)

372
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,549
I don't think I asked.

373
00:13:57,789 --> 00:13:59,149
- Sorry. - There was silence.

374
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:02,289
- Nobody... - I have nothing to say.

375
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,189
- Kyung Hwan. - Yes.

376
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,428
You should've said, "You don't look that age at all."

377
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:07,898
- You should've said it right away. - Exactly.

378
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:09,898
You called her an old man.

379
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:11,700
You should've jumped in.

380
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:13,829
(The man is stuck in the middle of their fight.)

381
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:16,268
- Are we here? - Thank you.

382
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:18,046
(Leaving the man issue behind and finishing their XR bus tour)

383
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:19,309
The first place...

384
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:20,339
(The first place we'll visit today is the chicken store.)

385
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,079
- It's a chicken store. - A chicken store?

386
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,110
- Yes. - I see.

387
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:28,549
(The first place is located in Suwon's chicken street.)

388
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:30,518
- It's a chicken store. - A chicken store?

389
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:32,220
There was a reason why Kyung Hwan came.

390
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,949
- Right. - He's a chicken expert.

391
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:37,018
I'm sorry, but I don't fry the chicken.

392
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:38,829
- Healthy chicken. - They're skewers.

393
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:39,928
(Boiled chicken expert)

394
00:14:39,929 --> 00:14:41,229
In this chicken street,

395
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:43,206
the popular thing to do is to fry it in a cast iron pot.

396
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,429
Oh, really?

397
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:46,469
The people who used to sell chicken deep-fried in cast iron pots...

398
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,446
from small stalls in the market all bought buildings.

399
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,970
- Oh, my. - Oh, my.

400
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,639
(Fried?)

401
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,009
(Yangnyeom?)

402
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,470
(The place that would resolve Korea's biggest dilemma)

403
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:58,379
(Suwon Chicken Street)

404
00:14:59,509 --> 00:15:03,049
(Fried chicken, yangnyeom chicken, )

405
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:07,049
(and old-style cast iron pot chicken)

406
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:15,460
(The jumbo galbi chicken from the movie, "Extreme Job")

407
00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:18,469
(The place where you can meet every type of chicken there is)

408
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:23,200
(Suwon Chicken Street leads the trends for chicken.)

409
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:26,109
- Oh, where could it be? - Oh, my.

410
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:28,409
- It must be packed on weekends. - You're right.

411
00:15:28,509 --> 00:15:30,409
- I see chicken there. - Right?

412
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:31,778
- Here. - Jumbo galbi chicken...

413
00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:32,809
wasn't a thing before.

414
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:34,178
- It's because of "Extreme Job." - Right.

415
00:15:34,179 --> 00:15:35,419
Oh, this place?

416
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,288
This street is really lined with chicken stores.

417
00:15:39,289 --> 00:15:40,519
It's all chicken.

418
00:15:41,419 --> 00:15:43,658
This place is famous for jumbo galbi chicken.

419
00:15:43,659 --> 00:15:45,490
This one is famous too.

420
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,658
How do you know all of that?

421
00:15:46,659 --> 00:15:47,729
This one is famous too.

422
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:49,159
(Suwon Jumbo Galbi Chicken)

423
00:15:49,259 --> 00:15:51,059
Which one are we going to?

424
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,820
Hold on. I think it's somewhere around here.

425
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,481
- It's my first time here. - It's my first time here too.

426
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:56,840
I think it's here.

427
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,340
Isn't it this the place?

428
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:00,909
You're right.

429
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,079
The important thing is something is fake.

430
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,918
- Right. - It's our first spot of the day.

431
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:09,249
We need to suspect everything.

432
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,918
This place seems new.

433
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:13,489
No, if you look here, it looks old.

434
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:14,788
(No, if you look here, it looks old!)

435
00:16:14,789 --> 00:16:16,518
- Look over here. - The sign is old.

436
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:18,128
(It seems old, )

437
00:16:18,129 --> 00:16:20,330
(and it also seems new.)

438
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:22,559
Something here could be fake.

439
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,529
Right. We need to suspect everything.

440
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:27,128
- You're right. - Hello.

441
00:16:27,129 --> 00:16:28,600
Hello.

442
00:16:28,999 --> 00:16:30,940
Doesn't this place seem real?

443
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,970
(Suwon Jumbo Galbi Chicken)

444
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:40,710
(The inside of the chicken store looks normal.)

445
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:43,918
- You were even on TV? "Today." - Yes.

446
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:44,990
Right.

447
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:48,419
(Is this a real store with no fishy parts?)

448
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:51,429
Wait. This seems a bit new.

449
00:16:52,289 --> 00:16:54,759
But... If you look here...

450
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,999
The paint seems so new.

451
00:16:58,669 --> 00:17:00,028
The paint is so new.

452
00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:02,600
- The fake place last week... - The outside is new too.

453
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,508
- was actually open for business. - Exactly.

454
00:17:05,509 --> 00:17:07,385
- They were open for business? - They actually were.

455
00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:09,809
- The food was fake. - The food was fake.

456
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:11,679
But they opened ahead of time to fool us.

457
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:12,980
No way.

458
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,580
This obviously looks real.

459
00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:18,688
- Right? - Those TV show posters.

460
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:19,749
Exactly.

461
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,750
(What kind of chicken made this a trendy place?)

462
00:17:20,751 --> 00:17:23,360
(Looking closely)

463
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,290
I found the unique item that we'll eat today.

464
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,659
- I saw it too. Kimchi bomb. - Right?

465
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,668
- Kimchi bomb... - Kimchi bomb chicken?

466
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:35,270
- What is that? - What is that?

467
00:17:36,169 --> 00:17:38,208
(One item stands out from the normal menu.)

468
00:17:38,209 --> 00:17:40,708
(Kimchi bomb chicken)

469
00:17:40,709 --> 00:17:42,079
I get everything else.

470
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,080
Old-style, fried, yangnyeom, half and half.

471
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,350
That all makes sense.

472
00:17:45,949 --> 00:17:48,350
Kimchi bomb does stand out the most.

473
00:17:48,949 --> 00:17:51,250
- It's the most expensive. - It is.

474
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:54,860
(Staring)

475
00:17:55,189 --> 00:17:57,089
I was even more surprised when I saw the clock.

476
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:59,229
(I was even more surprised when I saw the clock!)

477
00:17:59,459 --> 00:18:00,488
It's 9am.

478
00:18:00,489 --> 00:18:01,899
(It's nine in the morning.)

479
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,560
It's 9am.

480
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,500
It's not even nine.

481
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,840
I'm not joking. I've never eaten chicken at 9am before.

482
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,908
Last week, we ate pork belly at 9:30am.

483
00:18:12,909 --> 00:18:13,969
- Right. - Yes.

484
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,208
But having chicken in the morning...

485
00:18:16,209 --> 00:18:17,779
- is okay. - Yes.

486
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,549
- Hello. - Hello.

487
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,978
- Hello. Nice to meet you. - Hello.

488
00:18:20,979 --> 00:18:23,549
Thank you for opening early in the morning for us.

489
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,550
Thank you.

490
00:18:24,649 --> 00:18:26,188
For how long have you been...

491
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:28,165
- running this chicken store? - It's been 13 years.

492
00:18:28,189 --> 00:18:29,520
- Thirteen years? - Yes.

493
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,900
Do you run it with your husband?

494
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,060
- With my son. Yes. - With your son?

495
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,458
- My husband does interior design. - Oh, interior design.

496
00:18:35,459 --> 00:18:37,830
Did you repaint the store recently?

497
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,628
My husband always paints it when I'm not here,

498
00:18:39,629 --> 00:18:41,169
so we always fight about it.

499
00:18:41,969 --> 00:18:43,238
- You always fight? - Yes.

500
00:18:43,239 --> 00:18:45,310
- Because if he does it once, - Yes.

501
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:47,910
- You need to get the smell out. - it takes time to do that.

502
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,309
- That's why? - Your husband does interior design.

503
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:52,110
- It doesn't smell like paint. - It doesn't.

504
00:18:52,649 --> 00:18:54,478
What made this store a trendy place?

505
00:18:54,479 --> 00:18:56,648
We have a special menu item.

506
00:18:56,649 --> 00:18:58,689
- Kimchi bomb chicken. Yes. - I knew it.

507
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,889
- I knew it. - It really was that.

508
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:02,620
What is that? Kimchi bomb...

509
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,059
It's a unique dish that only we make here.

510
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,090
I discovered it myself.

511
00:19:08,199 --> 00:19:09,639
This is called Suwon Chicken Street,

512
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,769
but over there is the center.

513
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:13,769
- Our store is kind of outside. - I see.

514
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,199
It's a bit removed from the center.

515
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:22,010
(Chicken street)

516
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,909
(Suwon Chicken is quite far from the main street.)

517
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,019
We needed to do something to survive.

518
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,489
Right. You're right about that.

519
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,219
(That makes sense.)

520
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,419
- What is that? Kimchi bomb... - Bomb?

521
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:40,530
(Food from Hwaseong, The first dish, chicken)

522
00:19:41,899 --> 00:19:44,499
(Chicken...)

523
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,530
(and kimchi...)

524
00:19:46,169 --> 00:19:48,300
(exploding like a bomb!)

525
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:51,039
(Every day, they sell dozens...)

526
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,310
(of this fancy transformation of old-style chicken.)

527
00:19:54,439 --> 00:19:57,810
(It uses all of the ingredients Koreans like.)

528
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,250
(True K-chicken)

529
00:20:01,879 --> 00:20:03,849
(Kimchi bomb chicken, coming soon)

530
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:06,320
- We should try that. - Kimchi bomb.

531
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:08,259
Please give us that.

532
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,919
- Okay. Coming right up. - Thank you.

533
00:20:11,729 --> 00:20:13,929
(Hesitating)

534
00:20:14,389 --> 00:20:17,629
It's a bit cold. Could we get fishcake soup too?

535
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,270
- Just one? - Yes, one fishcake soup, please.

536
00:20:20,629 --> 00:20:22,138
Are you going to just eat lots of the fishcake soup?

537
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:23,438
(Are you going to just eat lots of the fishcake soup?)

538
00:20:23,439 --> 00:20:25,310
Trendy places don't mean anything to Jae Suk.

539
00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:29,010
"Let other people eat that. I'll have something else."

540
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:32,178
- "I want what suits my taste." - Fishcake soup.

541
00:20:32,179 --> 00:20:33,310
It's a bit cold.

542
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,700
- You don't like being cold, right? - I don't really.

543
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:38,049
- I don't like being cold. - I don't like being cold either.

544
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:39,688
- Same. - People from the southern coast...

545
00:20:39,689 --> 00:20:41,488
- That makes sense. - We're both from Gyeongsang.

546
00:20:41,489 --> 00:20:42,836
- Right. - We're from warm places.

547
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,289
I was born in the summer, but I hate the summer.

548
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:47,729
Does that matter? Babies aren't born outdoors.

549
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,060
What?

550
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,259
Babies are usually born indoors,

551
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,099
- so why would that matter? - It's not that.

552
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,499
(Kyung Hwan is wondering why it matters when we're born indoors.)

553
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,398
Back then, we didn't have air conditioners.

554
00:20:57,399 --> 00:20:58,638
We were all struggling.

555
00:20:58,639 --> 00:20:59,810
You didn't have them?

556
00:21:00,239 --> 00:21:01,779
No, we didn't have air conditioners.

557
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,780
I was born in the 1970s.

558
00:21:03,939 --> 00:21:04,949
I see.

559
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,779
Why is she suddenly solemn?

560
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,749
To explain the historical background,

561
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,478
not a lot of households had air conditioners in the 1970s.

562
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:11,820
- I see. - Right.

563
00:21:12,489 --> 00:21:16,219
(Back then, air conditioners were not common in houses.)

564
00:21:17,689 --> 00:21:19,459
(An entire family would share one fan.)

565
00:21:19,889 --> 00:21:25,228
(Even refrigerators were rare, so produce were kept fresh with ice.)

566
00:21:25,229 --> 00:21:26,229
- I see. - To put it simply.

567
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,898
We had the barley hump too.

568
00:21:27,899 --> 00:21:29,869
Hye Lyun, the barley hump happened...

569
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:31,769
- during the Korean War. - It did?

570
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:33,709
Then it was the rice hump.

571
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:35,079
The rice hump?

572
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,438
The rice hump.

573
00:21:36,439 --> 00:21:39,079
- My family barely afforded rice. - No, the barley hump means...

574
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,448
It means food supply was scarce, so people just ate barley.

575
00:21:40,449 --> 00:21:42,850
- Barley hump. - Right. Food was scarce.

576
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:45,249
Ramyeon was rare back then.

577
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,648
We had a total of eight siblings.

578
00:21:47,649 --> 00:21:49,559
So we boiled three packets of ramyeon,

579
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,188
added a lot of water,

580
00:21:51,189 --> 00:21:52,759
and barley...

581
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,830
We mixed in barley too.

582
00:21:55,459 --> 00:21:58,369
(The eight siblings didn't have much, )

583
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:01,270
(but their hearts were still full.)

584
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,698
(We mixed barley into our ramyeon.)

585
00:22:03,699 --> 00:22:05,309
- It must have been too bland. - What?

586
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,668
Right, and because it was bland,

587
00:22:06,669 --> 00:22:08,839
we used to throw in a whole lot of kimchi.

588
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,039
We put in so much kimchi

589
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,849
There would have been more kimchi than ramyeon.

590
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:13,948
And kimchi was practically all we had.

591
00:22:13,949 --> 00:22:17,418
We made kimchi stew, stir-fried kimchi, and kimchi...

592
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,549
- You used kimchi for everything. - Yes, for everything.

593
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:21,918
And back then, we did a lot of kimchi making.

594
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,659
We wouldn't have survived without kimchi.

595
00:22:23,989 --> 00:22:26,888
(Maybe it's fate that brought her to kimchi bomb chicken.)

596
00:22:26,889 --> 00:22:29,398
Your hair looks cool today.

597
00:22:29,399 --> 00:22:30,859
- This is... - Did you get a fresh haircut?

598
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,898
And I got a straightening perm.

599
00:22:32,899 --> 00:22:34,128
I have naturally curly hair.

600
00:22:34,129 --> 00:22:36,639
You kind of look like that character in "Star Trek."

601
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,839
(Dying from laughing)

602
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,840
What is that?

603
00:22:40,841 --> 00:22:42,438
- Can you look it up for me? - Wait, we have to do this.

604
00:22:42,439 --> 00:22:43,708
- Your hair has to... - Look it up for me.

605
00:22:43,709 --> 00:22:44,709
He's an alien.

606
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:46,109
- Yes, he's an alien. - He has pointy ears,

607
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,809
and his hair looks like yours.

608
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:49,049
Is the character weird?

609
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:50,050
They look the same.

610
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,290
I see the resemblance.

611
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,750
Goodness.

612
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,888
We really do look similar.

613
00:22:56,889 --> 00:22:58,019
Gosh, that's funny.

614
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,089
Kyung Hwan, is there anything you're trying to make popular?

615
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:01,428
I came up with something recently.

616
00:23:01,429 --> 00:23:03,129
- You did? - Yes.

617
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,398
- I feel like this is too abrupt. - No, show us.

618
00:23:05,399 --> 00:23:06,898
It's fine.

619
00:23:06,899 --> 00:23:09,398
I was wondering for a while when you'd ask me to show you.

620
00:23:09,399 --> 00:23:11,839
I'm disappointed.

621
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,139
(Rolling his body)

622
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:15,379
Gosh.

623
00:23:15,439 --> 00:23:17,310
(Pleased)

624
00:23:17,939 --> 00:23:19,448
Gosh.

625
00:23:19,449 --> 00:23:21,178
- Did you come up with it just now? - No.

626
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:23,479
Aren't you being too aggressive when you're disappointed?

627
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:26,148
Why would you do this to show that you're disappointed?

628
00:23:26,149 --> 00:23:27,688
I'm just expressing disappointment.

629
00:23:27,689 --> 00:23:28,689
"Gosh, I'm disappointed."

630
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:30,259
He doesn't have particular reasons.

631
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,628
He doesn't have particular reasons.

632
00:23:31,629 --> 00:23:33,458
Years ago, Kyung Hwan and I were PR ambassadors...

633
00:23:33,459 --> 00:23:36,129
at the Korean Customs Service for the fight against drugs.

634
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,830
We made rounds at the airport a couple of times a year...

635
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:41,428
- You were PR ambassadors. - telling people that...

636
00:23:41,429 --> 00:23:43,299
they shouldn't transport drugs.

637
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:47,208
We would shout out, "Don't transport drugs!"

638
00:23:47,209 --> 00:23:48,839
One day, someone said, "Since Kyung Hwan is new here,"

639
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,378
"he should shout out in front of us,"

640
00:23:50,379 --> 00:23:51,779
"and the rest of us will follow him."

641
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,110
So this is what Kyung Hwan did.

642
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:56,779
"Transporting drugs. No, no. No, you should not."

643
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:59,750
And the people in the back shouted, "No, no. No, you should not."

644
00:24:00,149 --> 00:24:02,259
There were about 50 Korean Customs Service employees.

645
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,519
- They had to say it too? - "No, no. No, you should not."

646
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,789
The service employees.

647
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:08,300
"Transporting drugs. No, no. No, you should not."

648
00:24:08,459 --> 00:24:10,458
- "No, no. No, you should not." - "No, no. No, you should not."

649
00:24:10,459 --> 00:24:12,968
"Doing drugs. No, no. No, you should not."

650
00:24:12,969 --> 00:24:15,175
- "No, no. No, you should not." - "No, no. No, you should not."

651
00:24:15,199 --> 00:24:18,070
People got confused later.

652
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,769
They said it was hard to follow the rhythm.

653
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:22,179
("It's too hard to follow the rhythm.")

654
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,378
They didn't contact me the next year.

655
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:25,379
(I'm disappointed.)

656
00:24:26,449 --> 00:24:27,749
- It's here. - Do you remember...

657
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:28,948
(Gosh!)

658
00:24:28,949 --> 00:24:30,649
What is that? It's here.

659
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,289
(Gosh!)

660
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:33,488
(What is that?)

661
00:24:33,489 --> 00:24:34,489
Gosh, what is that?

662
00:24:35,296 --> 00:24:36,525
- It's here. - Do you remember...

663
00:24:36,526 --> 00:24:37,795
(Gosh!)

664
00:24:37,796 --> 00:24:39,466
What is that? It's here.

665
00:24:40,036 --> 00:24:41,036
(Gosh!)

666
00:24:41,037 --> 00:24:42,305
(What is that?)

667
00:24:42,306 --> 00:24:43,306
Gosh, what is that?

668
00:24:53,776 --> 00:24:55,445
- What is that? - Oh, my.

669
00:24:55,446 --> 00:24:57,215
- The cheese... - Gosh, this is...

670
00:24:57,216 --> 00:24:58,861
(The long-awaited kimchi bomb chicken is here.)

671
00:24:58,885 --> 00:25:00,255
(Surprised)

672
00:25:00,256 --> 00:25:01,884
- This looks amazing. - The kimchi...

673
00:25:01,885 --> 00:25:03,124
Gosh, this is...

674
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:04,555
- This looks real. - This is amazing.

675
00:25:04,556 --> 00:25:05,556
It looks real.

676
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:11,266
(This is the one that made this restaurant trendy in Suwon.)

677
00:25:15,605 --> 00:25:18,904
Our best-selling dish is the kimchi bomb chicken.

678
00:25:18,905 --> 00:25:20,435
(Kimchi bomb chicken)

679
00:25:21,675 --> 00:25:23,174
At Suwon Chicken Street,

680
00:25:23,175 --> 00:25:25,815
I'm the king of frying chicken.

681
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:28,022
(Fried chicken that's been fried by the king of frying chicken)

682
00:25:28,046 --> 00:25:29,384
Something that's as important...

683
00:25:29,385 --> 00:25:31,755
as the fried chicken is our kimchi.

684
00:25:31,756 --> 00:25:33,154
(The main character of today's dish is kimchi.)

685
00:25:33,155 --> 00:25:36,184
Our secret kimchi recipe has been in the family for five generations.

686
00:25:36,185 --> 00:25:38,455
I spent a year figuring out ways to combine...

687
00:25:38,456 --> 00:25:39,996
our kimchi with fried chicken.

688
00:25:41,256 --> 00:25:44,825
We put kimchi fried rice made with our secret kimchi on the bottom...

689
00:25:46,395 --> 00:25:50,466
and put lots of mozzarella cheese that young people like around it.

690
00:25:50,635 --> 00:25:53,235
(Then comes the fried chicken made by the king of fried chicken.)

691
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:57,145
I stir-fry kimchi with my secret sauce.

692
00:25:58,006 --> 00:26:02,115
Half head of cabbage of kimchi is used per chicken.

693
00:26:03,986 --> 00:26:07,986
(Half head of cabbage of stir-fried kimchi poured on top.)

694
00:26:08,456 --> 00:26:10,956
(Fried chicken, kimchi, and cheese are perfect for Koreans.)

695
00:26:11,796 --> 00:26:14,225
It took me a year to perfect the recipe for this dish.

696
00:26:14,226 --> 00:26:16,186
(It took her a year to perfect this masterpiece.)

697
00:26:16,496 --> 00:26:19,094
We're the only restaurant that sells this dish on Suwon Chicken Street,

698
00:26:19,095 --> 00:26:20,834
so many young people come here for this.

699
00:26:20,835 --> 00:26:22,205
Their posts about it on social media...

700
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:24,065
have doubled our sales.

701
00:26:24,066 --> 00:26:26,706
We're currently maintaining monthly sales of 40,000 dollars.

702
00:26:27,935 --> 00:26:30,644
Do you think this is real?

703
00:26:30,645 --> 00:26:33,115
(Do you think the kimchi bomb chicken of Hwaseong is real?)

704
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:34,675
(Surprised)

705
00:26:35,415 --> 00:26:37,045
This is kimchi fried rice.

706
00:26:37,046 --> 00:26:38,315
Gosh, this is...

707
00:26:38,316 --> 00:26:39,785
- This is amazing. - This is huge.

708
00:26:39,786 --> 00:26:40,985
- I think this is real. - It's like a bomb indeed.

709
00:26:40,986 --> 00:26:42,154
There's rice on the bottom.

710
00:26:42,155 --> 00:26:43,324
There's rice.

711
00:26:43,325 --> 00:26:44,861
(The kimchi bomb chicken has the Sixth Sense members in shock.)

712
00:26:44,885 --> 00:26:46,654
There's a reason this is the most expensive dish.

713
00:26:46,655 --> 00:26:47,795
There's cheese, kimchi,

714
00:26:47,796 --> 00:26:48,995
- and rice on the bottom. - Yes.

715
00:26:48,996 --> 00:26:51,025
- It's like a bomb indeed. - There's rice on the bottom.

716
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,164
There's rice too.

717
00:26:52,165 --> 00:26:53,735
- How do we eat this? - Right.

718
00:26:53,736 --> 00:26:55,235
You cut the chicken in half...

719
00:26:55,236 --> 00:26:57,035
and eat it with the rice and the cheese.

720
00:26:57,036 --> 00:26:58,404
(Cut the chicken in half...)

721
00:26:58,405 --> 00:26:59,674
- That's nice. - Yes.

722
00:26:59,675 --> 00:27:02,644
(and mix it with the kimchi sauce.)

723
00:27:02,645 --> 00:27:05,945
You eat it after cutting the chicken into pieces.

724
00:27:05,946 --> 00:27:07,914
- Gosh, let's eat. - Enjoy.

725
00:27:07,915 --> 00:27:09,545
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

726
00:27:09,546 --> 00:27:10,546
Let's eat.

727
00:27:10,986 --> 00:27:12,216
Let's eat first and then talk.

728
00:27:13,056 --> 00:27:17,084
(What does the kimchi bomb chicken taste like?)

729
00:27:17,085 --> 00:27:18,085
(Exclaiming)

730
00:27:18,325 --> 00:27:20,256
Gosh, the cheese looks so tasty.

731
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:22,565
(The youngest takes a huge bite of a drumstick.)

732
00:27:22,566 --> 00:27:24,726
Gosh, this is...

733
00:27:27,066 --> 00:27:28,164
Right?

734
00:27:28,165 --> 00:27:29,305
This is so good.

735
00:27:29,306 --> 00:27:31,265
- Why is this so good? - Seriously.

736
00:27:31,266 --> 00:27:34,074
I never imagined kimchi would go so well with chicken.

737
00:27:34,075 --> 00:27:35,075
(Gosh!)

738
00:27:35,076 --> 00:27:36,356
- Isn't it good? - It's so good.

739
00:27:36,645 --> 00:27:38,245
- This is perfect. - It's incredible.

740
00:27:38,246 --> 00:27:39,914
(The Sixth Sense members are all...)

741
00:27:39,915 --> 00:27:41,074
(devouring the food.)

742
00:27:41,075 --> 00:27:42,485
This is so good.

743
00:27:42,486 --> 00:27:44,185
- This is so good. - Right?

744
00:27:45,256 --> 00:27:46,715
- This is so good. - Right?

745
00:27:46,716 --> 00:27:48,654
- It really is tasty. - It's so tasty.

746
00:27:48,655 --> 00:27:50,584
The crispy fried batter...

747
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:52,394
- is infused with the kimchi sauce. - Right.

748
00:27:52,395 --> 00:27:53,695
It's so good.

749
00:27:53,696 --> 00:27:54,895
This is amazing.

750
00:27:54,996 --> 00:27:57,095
And the mozzalella cheese...

751
00:27:57,895 --> 00:27:59,095
Did you just say "mozzalella?"

752
00:27:59,696 --> 00:28:01,696
Was that your first time saying the word out loud?

753
00:28:02,466 --> 00:28:03,735
I think it was her first time saying it out loud.

754
00:28:03,736 --> 00:28:04,904
It's "mozzalella."

755
00:28:04,905 --> 00:28:06,476
It's "mozzalella."

756
00:28:06,875 --> 00:28:08,335
It's "mozzalella."

757
00:28:09,476 --> 00:28:10,874
Everything in this dish is good.

758
00:28:10,875 --> 00:28:12,614
(The combination of fried chicken, kimchi, and cheese is perfect.)

759
00:28:12,615 --> 00:28:14,344
Gosh, this sauce is so good.

760
00:28:14,345 --> 00:28:15,715
The kimchi sauce is good.

761
00:28:15,716 --> 00:28:17,115
- Yes. - Right.

762
00:28:17,585 --> 00:28:19,684
To be honest, 25 dollars for this...

763
00:28:19,685 --> 00:28:20,985
- This is... - This is a lot of food.

764
00:28:20,986 --> 00:28:22,084
It's a lot of food.

765
00:28:22,085 --> 00:28:24,485
A plain fried chicken is 19 dollars,

766
00:28:24,486 --> 00:28:26,594
but they're selling all this for 25 dollars.

767
00:28:26,595 --> 00:28:27,725
- Right. - If I were...

768
00:28:27,726 --> 00:28:30,225
a student, I would come here a lot.

769
00:28:30,226 --> 00:28:31,424
Millennials and Gen Z would love this.

770
00:28:31,425 --> 00:28:33,394
And the price is... Right.

771
00:28:33,395 --> 00:28:34,395
Four people can come here...

772
00:28:34,396 --> 00:28:36,205
- and order this. - Then they would...

773
00:28:36,206 --> 00:28:37,265
- eat this as dinner... - Right.

774
00:28:37,266 --> 00:28:39,036
- with alcohol. - Yes.

775
00:28:39,706 --> 00:28:41,475
- This is more than enough food. - Yes.

776
00:28:41,476 --> 00:28:43,574
- I'm happy. - Me too.

777
00:28:43,575 --> 00:28:45,215
I'm here with the people I like. Jae Suk,

778
00:28:45,776 --> 00:28:47,874
Eun Yi, Mimi,

779
00:28:47,875 --> 00:28:48,884
Is this real?

780
00:28:48,885 --> 00:28:50,946
And Kyung Pyo.

781
00:28:51,746 --> 00:28:53,655
You forgot one.

782
00:28:53,855 --> 00:28:55,225
(Oh, right!)

783
00:28:55,226 --> 00:28:56,385
You forgot one.

784
00:28:56,855 --> 00:28:59,026
If you don't say my name, I'll be disappointed.

785
00:28:59,996 --> 00:29:01,594
I like "I'm disappointed."

786
00:29:01,595 --> 00:29:03,664
I'm disappointed.

787
00:29:03,665 --> 00:29:04,795
Yes, keep saying it.

788
00:29:04,796 --> 00:29:06,066
I'm disappointed.

789
00:29:06,835 --> 00:29:09,036
- That's kimchi fried rice. - Yes.

790
00:29:10,806 --> 00:29:12,574
This combination is so good.

791
00:29:12,575 --> 00:29:14,334
When we eat rice with leftover chicken,

792
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:17,246
- Right. - we usually add kimchi and cheese.

793
00:29:18,206 --> 00:29:19,844
(Taking a huge bite)

794
00:29:19,845 --> 00:29:20,976
Gosh, this is good.

795
00:29:21,476 --> 00:29:22,715
It's so good.

796
00:29:22,716 --> 00:29:25,184
- We don't have to order more rice. - Yes.

797
00:29:25,185 --> 00:29:26,414
- Right. - Yes.

798
00:29:26,415 --> 00:29:28,354
- The fried chicken. - I can tell...

799
00:29:28,355 --> 00:29:30,555
- she has a lot of experience. - I know.

800
00:29:30,556 --> 00:29:32,596
- I can't stop eating it. - I can't stop eating it.

801
00:29:33,655 --> 00:29:34,755
(He can't stop eating it.)

802
00:29:34,756 --> 00:29:36,125
This is perfect.

803
00:29:36,726 --> 00:29:38,965
The rice on the bottom will get burnt and crispy.

804
00:29:38,966 --> 00:29:39,966
Let's go.

805
00:29:40,266 --> 00:29:42,434
Gosh, the rice is perfectly burnt.

806
00:29:42,435 --> 00:29:44,206
Crispy burnt rice with cheese.

807
00:29:44,506 --> 00:29:46,435
Gosh, this is amazing.

808
00:29:47,435 --> 00:29:48,574
- This is so good. - Right?

809
00:29:48,575 --> 00:29:49,645
Isn't it amazing?

810
00:29:51,046 --> 00:29:52,315
Gosh.

811
00:29:52,316 --> 00:29:54,074
- It's so tasty. - It's perfect.

812
00:29:54,075 --> 00:29:55,344
(Scraping the rice off)

813
00:29:55,345 --> 00:29:57,815
He's drawing the attention. Yes, that's it.

814
00:29:57,816 --> 00:30:00,016
Have you been going to the gym to do that?

815
00:30:00,185 --> 00:30:01,316
Gosh.

816
00:30:02,085 --> 00:30:04,925
(Jae Suk takes a bite after scraping some off the pan.)

817
00:30:05,226 --> 00:30:06,795
(This is incredible.)

818
00:30:06,796 --> 00:30:08,056
- It's so good. - Right?

819
00:30:08,196 --> 00:30:10,725
- Gosh, this is the best part. - Yes.

820
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:12,111
The crispy burnt rice is the best part.

821
00:30:12,135 --> 00:30:14,095
The crispy burnt rice is so good with the cheese.

822
00:30:14,536 --> 00:30:16,164
- Gosh. - It's so good.

823
00:30:16,165 --> 00:30:17,165
It's good.

824
00:30:17,166 --> 00:30:19,005
I've never felt this refreshed after eating fried chicken before.

825
00:30:19,006 --> 00:30:20,104
- Right? - Yes.

826
00:30:20,105 --> 00:30:22,705
Eating fried chicken in the morning...

827
00:30:22,706 --> 00:30:24,074
could have felt too greasy,

828
00:30:24,075 --> 00:30:26,515
- but the stir-fried kimchi... - The fried rice at the end.

829
00:30:26,516 --> 00:30:27,915
Makes it not greasy at all.

830
00:30:28,885 --> 00:30:31,085
There's this thing, though.

831
00:30:31,415 --> 00:30:34,684
Seeing her give us two forks each made me think of this.

832
00:30:34,685 --> 00:30:35,685
What?

833
00:30:36,355 --> 00:30:37,884
(There are a lot of forks.)

834
00:30:37,885 --> 00:30:40,456
(The owner provided them with two forks each.)

835
00:30:40,726 --> 00:30:43,695
Unless you've been in business for a while,

836
00:30:43,696 --> 00:30:46,094
you wouldn't know why having two forks is necessary.

837
00:30:46,095 --> 00:30:47,536
- That's right. - Yes.

838
00:30:48,365 --> 00:30:51,134
But most restaurants on Suwon Chicken Street do this.

839
00:30:51,135 --> 00:30:52,276
- They do? - Yes.

840
00:30:54,105 --> 00:30:55,375
- I see. - You're being cold.

841
00:30:56,105 --> 00:30:57,605
I'm sorry to burst your bubble,

842
00:30:57,905 --> 00:30:59,591
but most restaurants here give each person two forks.

843
00:30:59,615 --> 00:31:02,414
What she said was persuasive.

844
00:31:02,415 --> 00:31:04,614
There are a lot of chicken places at the center of the area.

845
00:31:04,615 --> 00:31:06,584
But this is on the outskirts.

846
00:31:06,585 --> 00:31:08,824
- So to be competitive... - Just regular chicken...

847
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,824
wouldn't have worked, so she created this.

848
00:31:10,825 --> 00:31:12,555
- That was very persuasive. - Right.

849
00:31:12,556 --> 00:31:14,424
I have a reasonable doubt.

850
00:31:14,425 --> 00:31:15,864
Earlier, when we came in,

851
00:31:15,865 --> 00:31:18,934
I noticed the names of their dishes were written on the window.

852
00:31:18,935 --> 00:31:19,965
- Right. - Okay.

853
00:31:19,966 --> 00:31:21,966
If this is their main dish,

854
00:31:22,066 --> 00:31:23,864
"kimchi bomb chicken" should be on the window.

855
00:31:23,865 --> 00:31:25,235
- It's not? - It's not on the window.

856
00:31:25,236 --> 00:31:27,282
(Kimchi bomb chicken should be written on the window too.)

857
00:31:27,306 --> 00:31:30,475
(Out of the many different chicken dishes on the window, )

858
00:31:30,476 --> 00:31:33,946
(kimchi bomb chicken is nowhere to be found.)

859
00:31:34,046 --> 00:31:37,144
People should be able to tell that they sell kimchi bomb chicken,

860
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,085
but it's not on the window.

861
00:31:39,516 --> 00:31:41,215
Gosh, this is good, though.

862
00:31:41,216 --> 00:31:43,485
- Anyway, this is so good. - It's perfect.

863
00:31:43,486 --> 00:31:46,526
- This is good. - Right.

864
00:31:48,196 --> 00:31:49,624
(Fried chicken from Hwaseong)

865
00:31:49,625 --> 00:31:51,195
(The owner has a persuasive reason for developing this dish.)

866
00:31:51,196 --> 00:31:52,795
(Even though it's their main dish, it's not on the window.)

867
00:31:52,796 --> 00:31:54,371
(The kimchi bomb chicken tastes perfect and is good value.)

868
00:31:54,395 --> 00:31:55,904
(Fried chicken)

869
00:31:55,905 --> 00:31:57,364
(Dessert)

870
00:31:57,365 --> 00:31:59,005
- Up next is dessert. - Dessert?

871
00:31:59,006 --> 00:32:00,006
Yes.

872
00:32:01,105 --> 00:32:02,874
(They split into two teams and take taxis.)

873
00:32:02,875 --> 00:32:03,946
Let's go.

874
00:32:04,575 --> 00:32:05,614
(This somehow became the young team.)

875
00:32:05,615 --> 00:32:06,844
- Gosh. - I'm wearing underclothes.

876
00:32:06,845 --> 00:32:07,952
(Kyung Pyo, Mimi, Kyung Hwan)

877
00:32:07,976 --> 00:32:09,776
(Kyung Pyo had to fold himself into the car.)

878
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,084
- I'll sit in the middle. Of course. - Are you sure?

879
00:32:12,085 --> 00:32:13,884
- I'm the tiniest. - Hello.

880
00:32:13,885 --> 00:32:14,885
(This somehow became the old team.)

881
00:32:14,886 --> 00:32:17,124
It's so nice to film with Jae Suk and Eun Yi.

882
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:18,555
I know. It's been so long.

883
00:32:18,556 --> 00:32:20,876
(She's even happier because she's with her close friends.)

884
00:32:21,296 --> 00:32:22,425
- Goodness. - Goodness.

885
00:32:22,865 --> 00:32:23,995
(Sighing)

886
00:32:23,996 --> 00:32:25,125
(Sighing)

887
00:32:26,335 --> 00:32:27,695
(The older team is feeling drowsy...)

888
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:29,336
(in the warmth with their stomachs full.)

889
00:32:29,365 --> 00:32:32,035
Gosh, it was so cold in the morning.

890
00:32:32,036 --> 00:32:33,205
- Right? - Yes.

891
00:32:33,206 --> 00:32:34,581
- When we were filming the opening. - Yes.

892
00:32:34,605 --> 00:32:36,644
Gosh, brother.

893
00:32:36,645 --> 00:32:38,074
Why do you keep calling Hye Lyun brother?

894
00:32:38,075 --> 00:32:39,245
I've been doing that since we were younger.

895
00:32:39,246 --> 00:32:41,674
I don't know why I keep calling her brother.

896
00:32:41,675 --> 00:32:43,395
I guess I give off that older brother vibe.

897
00:32:43,685 --> 00:32:45,414
It's fine with me. You can call me brother.

898
00:32:45,415 --> 00:32:46,585
I'll allow it from only you.

899
00:32:47,115 --> 00:32:49,286
He does that quite a lot to you, right?

900
00:32:49,786 --> 00:32:53,225
Her show. What was it again? "Rooftop Room Cat?"

901
00:32:53,226 --> 00:32:54,924
- "Problem Child in House." - Right. Child.

902
00:32:54,925 --> 00:32:55,925
You said cat.

903
00:32:55,926 --> 00:32:56,995
(The KBS show is called "Problem Child in House.")

904
00:32:56,996 --> 00:32:58,725
- "Rooftop Room Cat" is a drama. - "Rooftop Room Cat" is a drama.

905
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:01,635
I appeared on that show, and that's when Eun Yi told me...

906
00:33:01,796 --> 00:33:03,664
that when I first moved to MBC...

907
00:33:03,665 --> 00:33:05,904
- without telling her... - That she was disappointed?

908
00:33:05,905 --> 00:33:07,705
But I hadn't realized.

909
00:33:07,706 --> 00:33:08,706
It's because me and Hye Lyun...

910
00:33:08,707 --> 00:33:09,844
had frequent idea meetings...

911
00:33:09,845 --> 00:33:11,005
- We were close. - and we were the closest.

912
00:33:11,006 --> 00:33:12,745
- And we hung out at her house. - Of course, she'd be disappointed.

913
00:33:12,746 --> 00:33:13,815
- Yes. - Yes.

914
00:33:13,816 --> 00:33:16,915
I just wondered why Hye Lyun didn't tell me.

915
00:33:17,016 --> 00:33:18,485
Looking back now, it was nothing.

916
00:33:18,486 --> 00:33:20,391
(At the time, Hye Lyun had kept it a secret from everyone.)

917
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:22,485
I realized that I...

918
00:33:22,486 --> 00:33:24,126
- You didn't think about Eun Yi. - Right.

919
00:33:24,256 --> 00:33:27,056
- I should have at least told her. - Everyone asked me if I had known.

920
00:33:27,096 --> 00:33:28,195
But I really hadn't.

921
00:33:28,196 --> 00:33:31,066
But looking back now, I could have felt awkward if I had.

922
00:33:31,696 --> 00:33:35,335
(They're talking about it after 30 years.)

923
00:33:35,866 --> 00:33:38,366
- You were at KBS then, right? - I...

924
00:33:38,605 --> 00:33:40,604
- No one else wanted me. - He had nowhere else to go.

925
00:33:40,605 --> 00:33:41,635
Where could he go?

926
00:33:41,636 --> 00:33:44,204
- I had nowhere else to go. - He had nowhere else to go.

927
00:33:44,205 --> 00:33:45,715
I was going to stay there no matter what.

928
00:33:45,716 --> 00:33:47,775
(Jae Suk was busy sticking to the TV station that wanted him.)

929
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,616
Looking back to that time, Soo Yong and the others...

930
00:33:50,915 --> 00:33:52,414
appearing in that MBC show...

931
00:33:52,415 --> 00:33:54,355
- The Gamjagol. - Gosh, I remember that.

932
00:33:54,915 --> 00:33:57,084
(Kim Gook Jin, Kim Yong Man, Park Soo Hong, Kim Soo Yong)

933
00:33:57,085 --> 00:33:59,454
(The Gamjagol Incident: The conflict that arose from...)

934
00:33:59,455 --> 00:34:02,366
(the members of the Gamjagol at KBS moving to its competitor, MBC)

935
00:34:02,566 --> 00:34:04,295
- The Gamjagol. - Gosh, I remember that.

936
00:34:04,296 --> 00:34:06,264
The senior comedians went after them.

937
00:34:06,265 --> 00:34:07,764
- They went there to get them. - They went there to get them.

938
00:34:07,765 --> 00:34:08,965
- They went after them. - They went there to get them.

939
00:34:08,966 --> 00:34:10,304
Whose side were you on at the time?

940
00:34:10,305 --> 00:34:12,865
I just followed the senior comedians and went there to get them.

941
00:34:13,835 --> 00:34:15,675
He had no choice but to follow them.

942
00:34:15,676 --> 00:34:17,645
- I had no choice. - Right.

943
00:34:17,875 --> 00:34:18,914
I didn't know any better.

944
00:34:18,915 --> 00:34:21,675
He still had to go with them, even though he didn't understand.

945
00:34:21,676 --> 00:34:24,015
But at the time, that's how much...

946
00:34:24,316 --> 00:34:26,715
moving from one TV station to another...

947
00:34:26,716 --> 00:34:28,485
- Right. - for work...

948
00:34:28,486 --> 00:34:30,184
was taken seriously as a betrayal...

949
00:34:30,185 --> 00:34:33,454
and as a defection. Everyone thought that way.

950
00:34:33,455 --> 00:34:34,724
That was how things were back then.

951
00:34:34,725 --> 00:34:36,224
(While the old team is lost in memories...)

952
00:34:36,225 --> 00:34:37,724
I'm so grateful we're able to take a taxi there.

953
00:34:37,725 --> 00:34:39,296
Right. It's so cold.

954
00:34:40,066 --> 00:34:41,565
Coincidentally,

955
00:34:41,566 --> 00:34:43,664
the members of this taxi are young.

956
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:47,136
The older members are in a separate taxi.

957
00:34:47,375 --> 00:34:49,704
Usually, I would belong in the team with older members.

958
00:34:49,705 --> 00:34:52,225
- But here, you're younger. - They're definitely older than me.

959
00:34:52,745 --> 00:34:54,315
- "Definitely older." - "Definitely older."

960
00:34:54,316 --> 00:34:56,744
- Are they that much older? - Of course, by ten years.

961
00:34:56,745 --> 00:34:58,216
- Ten years? - Yes.

962
00:34:58,616 --> 00:35:00,284
(Thinking)

963
00:35:00,285 --> 00:35:02,116
I really like your chicken breast products.

964
00:35:02,355 --> 00:35:03,855
I ate them a lot.

965
00:35:04,085 --> 00:35:05,805
I ate them a lot back when I was a trainee.

966
00:35:05,855 --> 00:35:07,454
- Why don't you eat them now? - Now?

967
00:35:07,455 --> 00:35:08,894
I get in trouble if I'm not on a diet.

968
00:35:08,895 --> 00:35:10,415
No. I get in trouble if I'm on a diet.

969
00:35:10,625 --> 00:35:12,495
- Do you keep losing weight? - No.

970
00:35:12,866 --> 00:35:14,034
I keep gaining weight.

971
00:35:14,035 --> 00:35:16,135
What am I saying?

972
00:35:16,136 --> 00:35:18,835
You're not really that young, are you?

973
00:35:19,375 --> 00:35:21,781
- You lose track of conversations. - Yes, I think you're right.

974
00:35:21,805 --> 00:35:24,445
I got confused about what I was trying to say.

975
00:35:24,446 --> 00:35:25,816
(So is she on a diet or not?)

976
00:35:26,046 --> 00:35:27,915
I'm lost.

977
00:35:28,176 --> 00:35:29,184
I was surprised.

978
00:35:29,185 --> 00:35:31,644
(I get it.)

979
00:35:31,645 --> 00:35:32,716
Gosh.

980
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:35,054
That chicken place...

981
00:35:35,055 --> 00:35:36,302
(The chicken breasts reminded him of the first trendy place.)

982
00:35:36,326 --> 00:35:37,885
- felt kind of suspicious to me. - Right?

983
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:39,995
There was something about it.

984
00:35:40,256 --> 00:35:43,225
Kyung Pyo thinks it's real.

985
00:35:43,426 --> 00:35:45,224
It's because, when we left,

986
00:35:45,225 --> 00:35:46,994
the owner got our autographs.

987
00:35:46,995 --> 00:35:49,566
Her behavior...

988
00:35:49,835 --> 00:35:51,705
could only be possible if the place is real.

989
00:35:51,835 --> 00:35:53,905
Like "Did you really enjoy our food?"

990
00:35:53,906 --> 00:35:55,136
Yes.

991
00:35:55,645 --> 00:35:58,375
(Did you enjoy the food?)

992
00:35:58,645 --> 00:36:00,945
(Thank you for enjoying our food.)

993
00:36:00,946 --> 00:36:02,115
(The owner was sincerely expressing her gratitude.)

994
00:36:02,116 --> 00:36:05,185
(You came here early in the morning.)

995
00:36:05,716 --> 00:36:09,256
I think the writers could have made her practice that a lot.

996
00:36:09,585 --> 00:36:11,585
- You think they went that far? - Of course.

997
00:36:13,256 --> 00:36:14,394
Let's get out here.

998
00:36:14,395 --> 00:36:15,595
- We're here, right? - Yes. Let's get out.

999
00:36:15,596 --> 00:36:16,825
We'll get out here.

1000
00:36:16,826 --> 00:36:17,971
(Is Kyung Hwan's reasoning right?)

1001
00:36:17,995 --> 00:36:20,235
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1002
00:36:20,236 --> 00:36:22,236
- Happy New Year. - Happy New Year.

1003
00:36:23,736 --> 00:36:25,565
Gosh, look.

1004
00:36:25,566 --> 00:36:26,934
Where's the trendy place?

1005
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:28,276
Where is it? Here?

1006
00:36:29,346 --> 00:36:31,874
- It's the Mural Alley - The Haenggung-dong Mural Alley.

1007
00:36:31,875 --> 00:36:33,615
- It's the Mural Alley - This is Haenggung-dong.

1008
00:36:33,616 --> 00:36:34,644
Haenggung-dong?

1009
00:36:34,645 --> 00:36:35,784
(Haenggung-dong Mural Alley)

1010
00:36:35,785 --> 00:36:37,886
- Back in 2010, - Yes.

1011
00:36:38,145 --> 00:36:40,115
Korean artists...

1012
00:36:40,116 --> 00:36:43,255
and foreign artists, about three in total...

1013
00:36:43,256 --> 00:36:44,426
I see.

1014
00:36:45,085 --> 00:36:48,225
(Haenggung-dong)

1015
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:54,966
(There are murals painted in the alleys all over the area.)

1016
00:36:55,906 --> 00:36:58,104
(To preserve Hwaseong, old houses didn't go under redevelopment.)

1017
00:36:58,105 --> 00:37:00,034
Korean artists...

1018
00:37:00,035 --> 00:37:03,104
and foreign artists, about three in total...

1019
00:37:03,105 --> 00:37:05,505
painted murals here. That's why this area is famous.

1020
00:37:05,506 --> 00:37:07,914
- You're right. Look. - Really?

1021
00:37:07,915 --> 00:37:10,015
- Look at the murals. - Gosh.

1022
00:37:11,316 --> 00:37:13,954
- Gosh. - This is amazing.

1023
00:37:13,955 --> 00:37:15,655
- This feels like Italy. - Right.

1024
00:37:15,656 --> 00:37:17,555
This mural is amazing.

1025
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,595
Each alley has beautiful murals.

1026
00:37:20,596 --> 00:37:21,826
Right.

1027
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:26,595
(You have to stop by Haengung-dong Mural Alley for pictures.)

1028
00:37:26,596 --> 00:37:30,735
People post pictures that they took here on social media.

1029
00:37:30,736 --> 00:37:32,005
This really is a trendy place.

1030
00:37:32,006 --> 00:37:33,775
Yes.

1031
00:37:33,776 --> 00:37:36,546
I want there to be Sixth Sense Alley.

1032
00:37:36,846 --> 00:37:39,374
- I see. - If our show is successful.

1033
00:37:39,375 --> 00:37:42,445
For that to happen, we'd have to be as successful as "Squid Game."

1034
00:37:42,446 --> 00:37:43,692
(We'd have to be as successful as "Squid Game.")

1035
00:37:43,716 --> 00:37:46,316
- With the world raving about us. - It was too big of a dream.

1036
00:37:47,855 --> 00:37:48,955
Gosh, I'm disappointed.

1037
00:37:49,785 --> 00:37:52,325
This neighborhood is famous for being in "Lovely Runner."

1038
00:37:52,326 --> 00:37:53,954
- This is that area? - Really?

1039
00:37:53,955 --> 00:37:56,095
- Really? - "Lovely Runner."

1040
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:58,066
- It's their route to school. - That's right.

1041
00:37:59,535 --> 00:38:04,006
(This street that goes deeper into the alley...)

1042
00:38:05,136 --> 00:38:08,576
(is the route Sol and Sun Jae took to go to school every day.)

1043
00:38:09,676 --> 00:38:12,437
(A little bit further down the alley is this house with a blue gate.)

1044
00:38:12,645 --> 00:38:14,744
(It's Sun Jae's house in "Lovely Runner,")

1045
00:38:14,745 --> 00:38:18,245
(and it feels like Sun Jae could walk out at any moment.)

1046
00:38:19,616 --> 00:38:22,886
- It's their route to school. - Actually,

1047
00:38:23,185 --> 00:38:25,285
Mimi didn't react to anything else.

1048
00:38:25,625 --> 00:38:27,655
When we mentioned famous foreign artists...

1049
00:38:27,656 --> 00:38:29,625
and Korean artists, she just said "I see."

1050
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:31,902
But she reacted right away at the mention of "Lovely Runner."

1051
00:38:31,926 --> 00:38:34,534
- This street. - Look at that.

1052
00:38:34,535 --> 00:38:35,565
Gosh.

1053
00:38:35,566 --> 00:38:37,664
- This village is fun. - It is fun.

1054
00:38:37,665 --> 00:38:39,034
It kind of feels like Jeju Island.

1055
00:38:39,035 --> 00:38:40,735
- It's pretty. - It kind of does.

1056
00:38:40,736 --> 00:38:42,135
Houses with low walls...

1057
00:38:42,136 --> 00:38:43,616
- are fun to look at. - That's right.

1058
00:38:43,906 --> 00:38:44,975
Gosh.

1059
00:38:45,276 --> 00:38:48,215
Gosh. This is cool.

1060
00:38:48,216 --> 00:38:49,561
(The alley is covered in beautiful murals.)

1061
00:38:49,585 --> 00:38:51,115
Now that I think about it, I remember seeing something...

1062
00:38:51,116 --> 00:38:53,215
- like this on "Lovely Runner." - Yes, you're right.

1063
00:38:53,216 --> 00:38:54,985
- This was in "Lovely Runner." - Where did she...

1064
00:38:54,986 --> 00:38:57,224
Where on earth is Sun Jae's house?

1065
00:38:57,225 --> 00:38:59,302
- Do you know what Kyung Hwan said? - What did he say?

1066
00:38:59,326 --> 00:39:00,954
Really? Where did she run?

1067
00:39:00,955 --> 00:39:02,725
(Really? Where did she run?)

1068
00:39:03,026 --> 00:39:06,465
(While they were in the middle of talking about "Lovely Runner")

1069
00:39:06,466 --> 00:39:09,335
(Kyung Hwan was really curious. "Where did she run?)

1070
00:39:11,035 --> 00:39:12,465
Weren't you talking about her running?

1071
00:39:12,466 --> 00:39:13,875
Yes. "Lovely Runner."

1072
00:39:13,975 --> 00:39:15,135
So did she not run, at all?

1073
00:39:15,136 --> 00:39:17,605
(So did she not run, at all?)

1074
00:39:17,875 --> 00:39:21,415
(She didn't run, but she did hug Sun Jae.)

1075
00:39:22,475 --> 00:39:23,946
It's an inn.

1076
00:39:24,316 --> 00:39:26,156
- I know what it is! - A mural painting!

1077
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:28,368
- Look at this! - It's an inn.

1078
00:39:28,937 --> 00:39:30,707
- I know what it is! - A mural painting!

1079
00:39:30,937 --> 00:39:32,107
This Geumbo Inn is...

1080
00:39:34,337 --> 00:39:35,376
(An inn located on a corner of the mural street)

1081
00:39:35,377 --> 00:39:37,007
- Oh, my. - Oh, gosh.

1082
00:39:37,178 --> 00:39:39,816
I've heard the building is 100 years old.

1083
00:39:39,817 --> 00:39:40,976
It's over 100 years?

1084
00:39:40,977 --> 00:39:42,018
(It's not open anymore.)

1085
00:39:42,687 --> 00:39:45,017
(Geumbo Inn)

1086
00:39:45,018 --> 00:39:47,138
(The painting that filled the entire wall depicts...)

1087
00:39:47,957 --> 00:39:50,657
- It's golden scales! - Which brings money!

1088
00:39:50,658 --> 00:39:52,218
(a golden fish swimming in Suwoncheon.)

1089
00:39:52,558 --> 00:39:56,027
(It's a painting of a Brazilian artist Raquel Lessa Shembri.)

1090
00:39:57,198 --> 00:40:00,638
(She was the first one who started Haenggung paintings.)

1091
00:40:01,638 --> 00:40:03,936
(This painting represents the street.)

1092
00:40:03,937 --> 00:40:06,578
(Geumbo Inn)

1093
00:40:07,808 --> 00:40:11,277
(This place became a popular spot for taking pictures.)

1094
00:40:12,107 --> 00:40:14,517
This Geumbo Inn is... You know what "Geumbo" means?

1095
00:40:14,518 --> 00:40:15,777
- Sammo Hung! - Sammo Hung!

1096
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:18,388
(Laughing)

1097
00:40:18,788 --> 00:40:19,816
(Okay, Kyung Pyo.)

1098
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:22,118
So, Sammo Hung stayed a night...

1099
00:40:22,558 --> 00:40:23,928
- Really? - No.

1100
00:40:24,527 --> 00:40:25,587
(Embarrassed)

1101
00:40:26,158 --> 00:40:27,527
A golden fish?

1102
00:40:28,297 --> 00:40:30,626
That has "bo" in it.

1103
00:40:30,627 --> 00:40:31,796
- Oh, I see. - What would it be?

1104
00:40:31,797 --> 00:40:32,867
- Geumbo! - Geumbo?

1105
00:40:32,868 --> 00:40:33,868
(Pondering)

1106
00:40:34,638 --> 00:40:36,238
- That means treasure! - That's it!

1107
00:40:36,868 --> 00:40:37,936
(I got it!)

1108
00:40:37,937 --> 00:40:39,137
- Nice! - That was the answer.

1109
00:40:39,638 --> 00:40:41,677
(Geumbo Inn)

1110
00:40:41,678 --> 00:40:44,646
- It's an old house over 100 years. - That's right!

1111
00:40:44,647 --> 00:40:46,393
(The name means this is where a lot of treasures are.)

1112
00:40:46,417 --> 00:40:49,417
- Should we take a picture here? - We should. Let's gather.

1113
00:40:49,518 --> 00:40:51,987
- We should be with this name. - In the middle!

1114
00:40:51,988 --> 00:40:53,828
Won't it look like we stayed here for a night?

1115
00:40:54,817 --> 00:40:57,226
No way. Who would think like that?

1116
00:40:57,227 --> 00:40:58,987
(Hye Lyun, please.)

1117
00:40:58,988 --> 00:41:00,027
You're a bit sensitive.

1118
00:41:00,828 --> 00:41:02,397
As she's a great celebrity...

1119
00:41:02,667 --> 00:41:04,768
Then, CEO Song!

1120
00:41:05,098 --> 00:41:06,937
You should be with us.

1121
00:41:07,238 --> 00:41:09,808
- That's right. - We won't have any more chances.

1122
00:41:10,107 --> 00:41:11,867
This would be our last moment with CEO Song.

1123
00:41:12,007 --> 00:41:13,777
(Nice!)

1124
00:41:13,977 --> 00:41:15,436
(Me too!)

1125
00:41:15,437 --> 00:41:17,646
- That's enough. - Look at this. It's not bad.

1126
00:41:17,647 --> 00:41:19,717
- Let me see. - Oh, this is nice.

1127
00:41:19,718 --> 00:41:22,276
- It's a good full shot! - This is awesome!

1128
00:41:22,277 --> 00:41:23,487
- Nice! - Yes.

1129
00:41:23,488 --> 00:41:25,186
- This is it! - This is what we expected!

1130
00:41:25,187 --> 00:41:27,218
Please, send me this picture later.

1131
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:29,557
It's so nice. We can remember this moment with it.

1132
00:41:29,558 --> 00:41:31,356
Yes, we should take some more.

1133
00:41:31,357 --> 00:41:33,197
- There's a cafe here. - Yes.

1134
00:41:33,198 --> 00:41:34,257
Is it a cafe?

1135
00:41:37,498 --> 00:41:39,497
- It has a good vibe. - Let's have coffee, then.

1136
00:41:39,498 --> 00:41:41,837
- Why not? - I'm down for it!

1137
00:41:42,238 --> 00:41:45,006
- The hot smell! - Hello!

1138
00:41:45,007 --> 00:41:47,206
- Oh, my. - Its smell is so good!

1139
00:41:47,207 --> 00:41:48,808
- It's so pretty. - Look at these cakes!

1140
00:41:49,848 --> 00:41:52,777
- Oh, scone! - This place is cool!

1141
00:41:53,848 --> 00:41:57,448
(It makes all dessert lovers' hearts flutter.)

1142
00:41:58,817 --> 00:42:00,916
Oh, the smell of scones!

1143
00:42:00,917 --> 00:42:03,487
(The sweet and savory smell of dessert fills the entire cafe.)

1144
00:42:03,488 --> 00:42:04,808
Oh, the smell of them is awesome!

1145
00:42:05,687 --> 00:42:08,627
We should order the brown cheese.

1146
00:42:09,098 --> 00:42:11,268
- Brown cheese? - Yes, and black sesame and mugwort.

1147
00:42:11,567 --> 00:42:12,598
Which one do you want?

1148
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:15,436
- This looks so good! - I want a different one.

1149
00:42:15,437 --> 00:42:16,567
You two choose.

1150
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:18,167
I'm disappointed!

1151
00:42:18,937 --> 00:42:20,977
- What would you like to have? - I'll buy, Jae Suk.

1152
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,107
I'll buy, Jae Suk.

1153
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:24,447
- I will. Please. - Wait a second.

1154
00:42:24,448 --> 00:42:26,578
- I should buy. - I will. What do you mean?

1155
00:42:26,748 --> 00:42:29,717
It's on me today as Jae Suk treated us last time.

1156
00:42:29,718 --> 00:42:30,787
- Really? - Hot chocolate!

1157
00:42:30,788 --> 00:42:32,756
- Three hot chocolates. - And three hot Americanos.

1158
00:42:32,757 --> 00:42:34,117
- Three cups! - We want scones too?

1159
00:42:34,118 --> 00:42:35,817
- You want? - Let's order them too!

1160
00:42:35,888 --> 00:42:38,503
- We should try its signature menu. - But we soon go to a dessert place.

1161
00:42:38,527 --> 00:42:40,356
- Yes, he's right. - I mean just a piece!

1162
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:42,226
- Yes, we should try one. - Yes, we need to taste each piece.

1163
00:42:42,227 --> 00:42:44,927
- Let's choose in the middle. - It's small. We won't be full.

1164
00:42:44,928 --> 00:42:46,697
- Lemon taste looks good. - The lemon is...

1165
00:42:46,698 --> 00:42:49,706
- Thanks for the treat! - Don't mention it. Thanks!

1166
00:42:49,707 --> 00:42:51,538
- Did you pay? - Yes, please take a seat.

1167
00:42:52,877 --> 00:42:55,138
- By the way, this is really pretty. - I think so.

1168
00:42:55,877 --> 00:42:58,848
- It's so cute. Mimi will like it. - Yes, that looks so cute!

1169
00:42:58,948 --> 00:42:59,977
It's way too cute!

1170
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:02,353
Oh, this cake. I've never seen things like this before!

1171
00:43:02,377 --> 00:43:03,687
It's so cute!

1172
00:43:03,848 --> 00:43:04,947
It's really cute.

1173
00:43:04,948 --> 00:43:07,388
(Turning around)

1174
00:43:07,488 --> 00:43:09,018
- Sit here. - Oh, you're so cute!

1175
00:43:10,558 --> 00:43:12,227
(The cute Hye Lyun)

1176
00:43:12,558 --> 00:43:14,657
It's so cute. Did she make all of them?

1177
00:43:14,658 --> 00:43:17,067
- Buy me one! - It's so pretty.

1178
00:43:17,167 --> 00:43:18,626
- It's so cute. - It makes me feel good too.

1179
00:43:18,627 --> 00:43:20,897
These sunglasses! I like this stylish one.

1180
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:23,006
- What would you do with that? - I want to give it to my daughter.

1181
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:24,007
To Na Eun?

1182
00:43:24,008 --> 00:43:25,088
(I will give it to Na Eun!)

1183
00:43:25,207 --> 00:43:26,336
There are a lot of beautiful things here.

1184
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:29,308
It's so pretty. Bring me the bear.

1185
00:43:29,748 --> 00:43:31,207
Bring me the bear.

1186
00:43:31,578 --> 00:43:32,847
- Which one? - "Bring me?"

1187
00:43:32,848 --> 00:43:35,477
- You just want to see it, not buy? - Buy it and bring me that.

1188
00:43:35,848 --> 00:43:38,047
(Brother Hye Lyun's direct request)

1189
00:43:39,248 --> 00:43:41,288
Hye Lyun, I'll buy you one!

1190
00:43:41,618 --> 00:43:43,658
- You wanted to have this one? - I'll take it here.

1191
00:43:44,087 --> 00:43:47,498
Oh, yes. It would be a good symbol...

1192
00:43:48,098 --> 00:43:49,328
of my husband and me.

1193
00:43:49,468 --> 00:43:52,768
(I see...)

1194
00:43:53,468 --> 00:43:55,897
You know that mechanism, right?

1195
00:43:56,107 --> 00:43:57,207
Yes, that mechanism...

1196
00:43:57,337 --> 00:43:58,367
(Yes, I should take care of Brother Hye Lyun.)

1197
00:43:58,368 --> 00:43:59,408
Yes, this one.

1198
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:02,606
- You have to give this to Na Eun. - Which one?

1199
00:44:02,607 --> 00:44:03,647
The princess!

1200
00:44:04,578 --> 00:44:06,178
- The tiara! - This one is amazing.

1201
00:44:06,277 --> 00:44:08,118
- They even sell that figure? - Yes.

1202
00:44:08,348 --> 00:44:09,377
Bring it to me.

1203
00:44:09,848 --> 00:44:12,187
Bring it to me.

1204
00:44:12,888 --> 00:44:13,956
How is it?

1205
00:44:13,957 --> 00:44:16,487
(How is it?)

1206
00:44:16,488 --> 00:44:17,648
Do I look like the King Lear?

1207
00:44:17,857 --> 00:44:19,127
(Do I look like the King Lear?)

1208
00:44:19,897 --> 00:44:21,296
(She naturally gives up the crown.)

1209
00:44:21,297 --> 00:44:22,897
- "To be or not to be." - It's so funny.

1210
00:44:24,897 --> 00:44:26,468
(Jae Suk spends some.)

1211
00:44:27,337 --> 00:44:28,367
Then, this goes to the bride and broom.

1212
00:44:28,368 --> 00:44:29,637
(He gives it to Brother Hye Lyun)

1213
00:44:29,638 --> 00:44:30,937
(Oh, gosh!)

1214
00:44:31,567 --> 00:44:32,606
They're lovebirds!

1215
00:44:32,607 --> 00:44:33,737
(Hye Lyun, you the lovebirds couple, you should be happy!)

1216
00:44:33,738 --> 00:44:35,106
- It's so cute. - Oh, the scones are here.

1217
00:44:35,107 --> 00:44:36,947
- Thanks. - Thanks a lot.

1218
00:44:36,948 --> 00:44:37,948
Thanks.

1219
00:44:37,949 --> 00:44:39,669
- Look at these beautiful pieces. - Oh, my.

1220
00:44:39,817 --> 00:44:43,147
Of course, there's a reason this place is so popular!

1221
00:44:45,348 --> 00:44:46,618
- It's so good. - It is, right?

1222
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:48,687
Oh, the smell!

1223
00:44:48,888 --> 00:44:50,788
The chocolate will taste so good!

1224
00:44:51,587 --> 00:44:52,686
(Impressed)

1225
00:44:52,687 --> 00:44:53,727
You like it?

1226
00:44:53,757 --> 00:44:55,198
It's the taste of America!

1227
00:44:55,428 --> 00:44:57,267
- The taste of America! - That's it!

1228
00:44:57,268 --> 00:44:58,296
- Is it? - It's so good.

1229
00:44:58,297 --> 00:44:59,773
(The deep taste of chocolate makes them think of America.)

1230
00:44:59,797 --> 00:45:00,877
Is it the taste of America?

1231
00:45:01,538 --> 00:45:02,796
- It's so deep! - Oh, my.

1232
00:45:02,797 --> 00:45:04,537
(They're all enjoying the taste of America.)

1233
00:45:04,538 --> 00:45:07,277
- It's not watery at all. - It's so deep!

1234
00:45:07,707 --> 00:45:08,777
Shall we slowly move out?

1235
00:45:09,678 --> 00:45:11,558
- Thanks for your service! - We've enjoyed all!

1236
00:45:12,007 --> 00:45:13,877
- Thanks! - Happy New Year!

1237
00:45:15,678 --> 00:45:18,687
Jae Suk, his beard indeed grows.

1238
00:45:18,888 --> 00:45:19,988
(Laughing)

1239
00:45:20,388 --> 00:45:22,957
It has become darker than before!

1240
00:45:23,257 --> 00:45:25,186
Even the producer's beard didn't grow that fast.

1241
00:45:25,187 --> 00:45:27,497
Everyone is looking at his beard!

1242
00:45:27,498 --> 00:45:29,474
(What is the reason everyone is looking at Kyung Hwan's beard?)

1243
00:45:29,498 --> 00:45:32,198
(At the popular chicken restaurant...)

1244
00:45:32,527 --> 00:45:34,198
(By the way...)

1245
00:45:34,468 --> 00:45:37,268
(Your beard already started to grow!)

1246
00:45:37,507 --> 00:45:39,268
(Getting thick)

1247
00:45:39,678 --> 00:45:41,506
(When I get stressed...)

1248
00:45:41,507 --> 00:45:42,537
When I feel uncomfortable...

1249
00:45:42,538 --> 00:45:43,578
(Is it really what I see?)

1250
00:45:44,707 --> 00:45:47,018
(When he was behind the pillar, he hadn't!)

1251
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:50,248
(It's getting thick as if he did makeup!)

1252
00:45:50,618 --> 00:45:53,558
(His beard got attention from all since the early morning.)

1253
00:45:54,457 --> 00:45:56,787
Everyone is looking at his beard!

1254
00:45:56,788 --> 00:45:58,457
(It grew while they were talking.)

1255
00:45:59,598 --> 00:46:00,928
Look at him.

1256
00:46:01,797 --> 00:46:04,327
(He's shy hiding his beard.)

1257
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:06,048
Kyung Hwan, I didn't want to talk about it.

1258
00:46:06,498 --> 00:46:07,697
But it's so obvious!

1259
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:09,337
What's wrong with my beard today?

1260
00:46:10,238 --> 00:46:12,207
You beard, do you want to be popular before me?

1261
00:46:12,738 --> 00:46:14,377
What's happening with it?

1262
00:46:14,908 --> 00:46:16,207
It's 10am!

1263
00:46:16,678 --> 00:46:18,948
His beard wants to be on TV!

1264
00:46:19,207 --> 00:46:20,917
- Stop it. - "Stop!"

1265
00:46:21,748 --> 00:46:24,487
- Let's stop. We're all guests here. - Guests?

1266
00:46:24,488 --> 00:46:26,687
"Let's help each other!"

1267
00:46:27,187 --> 00:46:29,487
- Do you still do jiu-jitsu? - Yes.

1268
00:46:29,488 --> 00:46:31,304
- He was in a competition... - He was in a tournament.

1269
00:46:31,328 --> 00:46:32,356
- What? - Jiu-jitsu?

1270
00:46:32,357 --> 00:46:33,357
Yes.

1271
00:46:33,358 --> 00:46:35,396
- He got a silver and bronze medal. - Kyung Hwan, sorry to interrupt.

1272
00:46:35,397 --> 00:46:36,998
But we should cross the street now.

1273
00:46:37,667 --> 00:46:39,526
- We can still talk. - Isn't he preparing...

1274
00:46:39,527 --> 00:46:40,538
for the next competition?

1275
00:46:41,038 --> 00:46:43,166
- Really? - He went to Japan for it.

1276
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:45,407
Kyung Hwan, why do you keep joining competitions?

1277
00:46:45,408 --> 00:46:46,437
Because I get angry.

1278
00:46:47,377 --> 00:46:50,277
- I just want to knock down anyone. - Because of your beard?

1279
00:46:50,377 --> 00:46:51,808
It's not about good motivation!

1280
00:46:52,308 --> 00:46:53,348
(Laughing)

1281
00:46:54,018 --> 00:46:57,288
(He started jiu-jitsu to calm down his anger.)

1282
00:46:58,518 --> 00:47:02,517
("Kyung Hwan Wins Second Place in the Global Jiu-jitsu Competition")

1283
00:47:02,518 --> 00:47:04,087
Now we enter Haengridan Street.

1284
00:47:04,187 --> 00:47:06,297
- Oh, this is it! - Haengridan Street.

1285
00:47:06,397 --> 00:47:07,397
(Oh, my!)

1286
00:47:07,398 --> 00:47:08,718
It's the beginning of the street.

1287
00:47:09,328 --> 00:47:11,997
- This is Haengridan Street. - This is Haengridan Street.

1288
00:47:11,998 --> 00:47:14,158
It looks like there are many interesting things to do.

1289
00:47:14,337 --> 00:47:15,397
It's cool.

1290
00:47:16,268 --> 00:47:18,808
- It seems there are many things. - Yes.

1291
00:47:22,977 --> 00:47:24,606
(Haengridan Street is inside the protection area...)

1292
00:47:24,607 --> 00:47:26,417
(of Cultural Properties.)

1293
00:47:27,047 --> 00:47:28,177
(It embraces traditional beauty with history and culture.)

1294
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:30,518
- It's so beautiful! - It's so nice.

1295
00:47:33,218 --> 00:47:34,686
- Haengridan Street! - It comes from the name "ridan."

1296
00:47:34,687 --> 00:47:35,917
Yes, it does.

1297
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:38,488
- There are so many good spots. - Indeed.

1298
00:47:38,988 --> 00:47:41,296
- This is like a place abroad. - Yes, I feel that too.

1299
00:47:41,297 --> 00:47:42,427
- Yes. - The vibe of the shop.

1300
00:47:42,428 --> 00:47:44,227
- It has all including Western. - Right?

1301
00:47:44,598 --> 00:47:46,098
- This street has a lot! - Yes.

1302
00:47:46,198 --> 00:47:47,867
There's even an unmanned shooting range.

1303
00:47:47,868 --> 00:47:50,336
- I've never seen that before. - There are many unmanned places.

1304
00:47:50,337 --> 00:47:53,006
It's a great spot to enjoy all.

1305
00:47:53,007 --> 00:47:55,038
- That's right. - It's so beautiful.

1306
00:47:55,678 --> 00:47:58,607
This ceramics! It's so beautiful.

1307
00:47:59,107 --> 00:48:00,453
- There's ceramics. - I like the biggest one.

1308
00:48:00,477 --> 00:48:02,317
That's nice. It seems it has light.

1309
00:48:02,848 --> 00:48:05,447
- I want to take one home. - This place is so funny!

1310
00:48:05,448 --> 00:48:08,917
(A ceramic that resembles the shape of Suwon Hwaseong)

1311
00:48:09,288 --> 00:48:10,586
I like Suwon.

1312
00:48:10,587 --> 00:48:11,627
- It's nice. - Right.

1313
00:48:11,988 --> 00:48:13,997
I've never thought Suwon would be like this.

1314
00:48:13,998 --> 00:48:15,057
Me neither.

1315
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:17,066
What have I done in my life without finding this kind of place?

1316
00:48:17,067 --> 00:48:19,367
- That's right. - We knew almost nothing.

1317
00:48:19,368 --> 00:48:20,566
Indeed.

1318
00:48:20,567 --> 00:48:22,968
It's a perfect spot for a date on a warm day.

1319
00:48:23,308 --> 00:48:25,988
(Haengridan Street's charm lures people who look for dating spots.)

1320
00:48:28,038 --> 00:48:30,046
- Did you come here before? - Isn't she Yeong Ja?

1321
00:48:30,047 --> 00:48:31,976
- Oh, you're here too! - Jae Suk was here!

1322
00:48:31,977 --> 00:48:33,217
- What's this? - It's all drawn here.

1323
00:48:33,218 --> 00:48:34,376
- Oh, Mimi! - Jae Suk!

1324
00:48:34,377 --> 00:48:35,517
They drew me.

1325
00:48:35,518 --> 00:48:37,186
Hello. It's me, isn't it?

1326
00:48:37,187 --> 00:48:38,947
It's Jae Suk. It's so obvious!

1327
00:48:38,948 --> 00:48:41,086
- There's Yeong Ja! - It's fun! Let's enter.

1328
00:48:41,087 --> 00:48:42,157
- Hello. - Even he is here.

1329
00:48:42,158 --> 00:48:43,227
- Hello! - Hello!

1330
00:48:44,127 --> 00:48:46,126
- It's awesome! - It's funny.

1331
00:48:46,127 --> 00:48:47,796
(Again they deviated into a caricature store.)

1332
00:48:47,797 --> 00:48:49,357
(Gosh)

1333
00:48:50,067 --> 00:48:51,067
Jin Sun Kyu.

1334
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:52,697
Gosh. Jin Sun Kyu is here as well.

1335
00:48:52,698 --> 00:48:53,997
It's Yeong Ja.

1336
00:48:53,998 --> 00:48:55,267
It's Shin Young.

1337
00:48:55,268 --> 00:48:56,807
- It's Shin Young. - It's Shin Young.

1338
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:58,467
- It's Shin Young. - That's Shin Young.

1339
00:48:58,468 --> 00:49:00,137
That's Gu Ra.

1340
00:49:00,138 --> 00:49:01,177
That's right.

1341
00:49:01,178 --> 00:49:03,276
Gosh. You can tell right away.

1342
00:49:03,277 --> 00:49:04,677
They're pretty.

1343
00:49:04,678 --> 00:49:07,477
Can we ask you to draw each of us?

1344
00:49:08,218 --> 00:49:09,476
Then shall we divide into three guys...

1345
00:49:09,477 --> 00:49:10,847
- and three girls? - Yes.

1346
00:49:10,848 --> 00:49:11,848
That's good.

1347
00:49:12,448 --> 00:49:13,686
- Okay. - Hye Lyun, you sit over there.

1348
00:49:13,687 --> 00:49:15,086
Am I a man?

1349
00:49:15,087 --> 00:49:16,256
No, I was joking.

1350
00:49:16,257 --> 00:49:17,757
(Am I a man?)

1351
00:49:18,488 --> 00:49:19,896
Everyone keeps calling you a mister, that's why.

1352
00:49:19,897 --> 00:49:20,957
Mister.

1353
00:49:21,328 --> 00:49:23,867
- Gosh. Today is... - Jae Suk, I'll pay this time.

1354
00:49:23,868 --> 00:49:26,066
- No. - This is all a memory.

1355
00:49:26,067 --> 00:49:27,574
- Come in, all of you. - This is all a memory.

1356
00:49:27,598 --> 00:49:29,267
- No, I'll pay. - You're so slow.

1357
00:49:29,268 --> 00:49:30,867
- Seriously. - Really, you're so slow.

1358
00:49:30,868 --> 00:49:31,868
My hands are freezing.

1359
00:49:31,869 --> 00:49:34,738
- You're so slow. - Gosh. I'm in trouble.

1360
00:49:35,408 --> 00:49:36,947
- Kyung Hwan, - He won't let me pay.

1361
00:49:36,948 --> 00:49:38,477
You're so slow.

1362
00:49:39,507 --> 00:49:40,877
I'm wearing gloves, that's why.

1363
00:49:42,777 --> 00:49:45,447
The person in the middle, can you look at me?

1364
00:49:45,448 --> 00:49:47,658
- Yes. She must be drawing me first. - Yes.

1365
00:49:48,288 --> 00:49:50,487
I think it'll only take 30 seconds to draw Hye Lyun.

1366
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:52,658
(I think it'll only take 30 seconds to draw Hye Lyun.)

1367
00:49:52,788 --> 00:49:53,998
I'm done.

1368
00:49:54,328 --> 00:49:55,627
Even I think I can draw her.

1369
00:49:56,627 --> 00:49:59,698
(Lowest level of difficulty for drawing)

1370
00:50:00,067 --> 00:50:02,498
Can you smile for me? Smile.

1371
00:50:02,598 --> 00:50:04,868
(For men, they're starting with Jae Suk.)

1372
00:50:05,268 --> 00:50:07,537
Your eyes are as small as I thought they'd be.

1373
00:50:07,538 --> 00:50:09,377
- Excuse me? - That's like...

1374
00:50:09,908 --> 00:50:11,748
That's because it's cold.

1375
00:50:13,078 --> 00:50:15,117
If it's not cold, they are bigger than this.

1376
00:50:15,118 --> 00:50:16,687
(Upset)

1377
00:50:18,248 --> 00:50:19,248
It's really cold today.

1378
00:50:19,249 --> 00:50:20,816
- It's really cold today. - I'll draw the next person.

1379
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:22,287
- Yes. This person. - What should I do?

1380
00:50:22,288 --> 00:50:23,288
Could you...

1381
00:50:23,289 --> 00:50:25,488
emphasize his growing beard?

1382
00:50:25,957 --> 00:50:29,256
Gosh. If you shave, the beard...

1383
00:50:29,257 --> 00:50:31,066
- is going in. - Is going in.

1384
00:50:31,067 --> 00:50:32,997
- It's been long since I heard this. - Yes.

1385
00:50:32,998 --> 00:50:34,097
This guy...

1386
00:50:34,098 --> 00:50:38,337
needs to be hit in the stomach.

1387
00:50:40,808 --> 00:50:44,376
(It's so much fun...)

1388
00:50:44,377 --> 00:50:46,976
(playing with Kyung Hwan.)

1389
00:50:46,977 --> 00:50:48,477
(Laughing)

1390
00:50:48,578 --> 00:50:49,847
If Jae Suk...

1391
00:50:49,848 --> 00:50:52,046
If Jae Suk didn't chat like that and stayed home,

1392
00:50:52,047 --> 00:50:53,257
he'd be depressed.

1393
00:50:55,857 --> 00:50:57,357
(Laughing)

1394
00:50:58,488 --> 00:50:59,488
It's been long since he hung out...

1395
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:02,026
with people who share the same sense of humor.

1396
00:51:02,027 --> 00:51:04,166
- Of course. It's nice. - Yes, it's nice.

1397
00:51:04,167 --> 00:51:05,697
We have good members.

1398
00:51:05,698 --> 00:51:07,767
With Kyung Pyo and Mimi.

1399
00:51:07,768 --> 00:51:09,868
(My favorite brother and sister)

1400
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,467
This is Actress Kim Tae Ri.

1401
00:51:11,468 --> 00:51:12,666
- Yes, that's right. - Isn't it?

1402
00:51:12,667 --> 00:51:13,706
That...

1403
00:51:13,707 --> 00:51:15,807
- That's right. - From that drama.

1404
00:51:15,808 --> 00:51:17,147
"Twenty-Five Twenty-One."

1405
00:51:17,547 --> 00:51:18,976
There's Actress Kim Da Mi as well.

1406
00:51:18,977 --> 00:51:21,447
That's right. From "Itaewon Class."

1407
00:51:21,448 --> 00:51:22,948
And "Our Beloved Summer."

1408
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:25,017
They filmed it here in Haenggung.

1409
00:51:25,018 --> 00:51:28,117
- Right. - Really?

1410
00:51:28,118 --> 00:51:30,086
But the street here...

1411
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:31,186
- is really nice... - It's pretty.

1412
00:51:31,187 --> 00:51:32,956
- to film such dramas. - Yes.

1413
00:51:32,957 --> 00:51:34,957
- It's perfect for youth films. - It is.

1414
00:51:35,857 --> 00:51:40,067
(Haenggung-dong is the perfect place for youth dramas.)

1415
00:51:40,738 --> 00:51:43,768
(Making our hearts melt with the excitement of first love, )

1416
00:51:44,738 --> 00:51:47,507
("Lovely Runner")

1417
00:51:49,507 --> 00:51:53,317
(And depicting the first love of fresh youth, )

1418
00:51:54,348 --> 00:51:56,848
("Our Beloved Summer")

1419
00:51:57,388 --> 00:52:00,187
(Youth dramas that depicted love in Haenggung-dong.)

1420
00:52:01,257 --> 00:52:02,887
There's NewJeans as well.

1421
00:52:02,888 --> 00:52:04,956
- Where? - Behind you. NewJeans.

1422
00:52:04,957 --> 00:52:06,058
There they are.

1423
00:52:09,198 --> 00:52:10,767
You must be on the wall here to be a star.

1424
00:52:10,768 --> 00:52:11,828
Exactly.

1425
00:52:12,198 --> 00:52:14,067
- I'm not on the wall. - Me neither.

1426
00:52:14,437 --> 00:52:16,197
It's my goal this year. To be put on the wall here.

1427
00:52:16,198 --> 00:52:18,468
(To have my caricature on the wall as a star)

1428
00:52:18,908 --> 00:52:21,578
Let's take a look. Go Kyung Pyo.

1429
00:52:22,477 --> 00:52:23,477
(Gosh)

1430
00:52:23,478 --> 00:52:24,706
He's an actor.

1431
00:52:24,707 --> 00:52:27,976
Heo Kyung Hwan is also one of the good-looking guys.

1432
00:52:27,977 --> 00:52:30,287
He was famous as a handsome comedian for a while.

1433
00:52:30,288 --> 00:52:31,448
For a while.

1434
00:52:32,147 --> 00:52:33,356
No, I'm in my prime.

1435
00:52:33,357 --> 00:52:34,387
(He's in his prime as a handsome comedian.)

1436
00:52:34,388 --> 00:52:36,157
You can't say "for a while."

1437
00:52:36,158 --> 00:52:37,158
(Joking)

1438
00:52:37,159 --> 00:52:38,527
I'm in my prime.

1439
00:52:39,257 --> 00:52:40,456
I'm so curious.

1440
00:52:40,457 --> 00:52:41,626
You'll be surprised.

1441
00:52:41,627 --> 00:52:43,347
- Since it resembles you exactly. - Really?

1442
00:52:43,627 --> 00:52:45,666
(How similar will it be with the real person?)

1443
00:52:45,667 --> 00:52:46,796
Here you go.

1444
00:52:46,797 --> 00:52:48,437
(Good gracious!)

1445
00:52:51,138 --> 00:52:52,538
- Isn't it fantastic? - Gosh.

1446
00:52:52,667 --> 00:52:53,777
Isn't it fantastic?

1447
00:52:54,707 --> 00:52:56,976
Gosh. Jae Suk looks great.

1448
00:52:56,977 --> 00:52:58,776
- Jae Suk... - Jae Suk's glasses are so big.

1449
00:52:58,777 --> 00:53:00,477
The characteristics are well portrayed.

1450
00:53:01,078 --> 00:53:02,617
She's so good.

1451
00:53:02,618 --> 00:53:03,847
(The eyes that become smaller in cold weather is the point.)

1452
00:53:03,848 --> 00:53:06,347
Look at Kyung Hwan looking all tired.

1453
00:53:06,348 --> 00:53:07,517
That's incredible.

1454
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:09,387
She drew your beard in a cute way.

1455
00:53:09,388 --> 00:53:10,956
- It's cute. - It's pretty.

1456
00:53:10,957 --> 00:53:13,227
- Kyung Pyo. - This is great.

1457
00:53:13,558 --> 00:53:15,497
I'm not an easy face to draw.

1458
00:53:15,498 --> 00:53:17,097
Kyung Pyo, it's you.

1459
00:53:17,098 --> 00:53:19,027
- It's so me. - It is you.

1460
00:53:19,968 --> 00:53:21,238
- Gosh. - It's incredible.

1461
00:53:21,437 --> 00:53:22,498
It's so good.

1462
00:53:22,897 --> 00:53:24,267
She drew it so well.

1463
00:53:24,268 --> 00:53:25,268
(A difficult face to draw Kyung Pyo is exactly alike.)

1464
00:53:25,269 --> 00:53:28,537
- The drum rolls. - Drum rolls.

1465
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:29,637
Ta-da.

1466
00:53:29,638 --> 00:53:30,647
(Gosh)

1467
00:53:31,477 --> 00:53:32,947
Why do I look so pretty?

1468
00:53:32,948 --> 00:53:34,316
- It's the pretty version of you. - That's me.

1469
00:53:34,317 --> 00:53:36,686
- Eun Yi looks exactly alike. - Goodness.

1470
00:53:36,687 --> 00:53:38,947
She drew me much prettier than I really am.

1471
00:53:38,948 --> 00:53:40,957
She drew us in a pretty way.

1472
00:53:41,257 --> 00:53:43,186
Mimi also looks the same.

1473
00:53:43,187 --> 00:53:45,456
- But it's so pretty. - It is.

1474
00:53:45,457 --> 00:53:47,856
But each characteristic is still emphasized.

1475
00:53:47,857 --> 00:53:49,296
Hye Lyun, you should take this.

1476
00:53:49,297 --> 00:53:50,698
This really is a gift.

1477
00:53:50,998 --> 00:53:52,497
It was fun. Thank you.

1478
00:53:52,498 --> 00:53:53,597
Thank you.

1479
00:53:53,598 --> 00:53:55,767
If you have time, could you draw me and put me on...

1480
00:53:55,768 --> 00:53:57,928
(If you have time, could you draw me and put me on...)

1481
00:53:58,468 --> 00:54:00,437
The second store must be here.

1482
00:54:01,107 --> 00:54:02,178
It's here.

1483
00:54:02,507 --> 00:54:04,706
It must be that place with the puppy picture.

1484
00:54:04,707 --> 00:54:05,707
What is it?

1485
00:54:05,877 --> 00:54:07,646
That's so cute. It's so big.

1486
00:54:07,647 --> 00:54:09,677
It's so pretty.

1487
00:54:09,678 --> 00:54:10,748
It's a dessert cafe.

1488
00:54:11,018 --> 00:54:13,046
But it doesn't look like it's fake.

1489
00:54:13,047 --> 00:54:14,117
(Is there a dessert from Hwaseong here?)

1490
00:54:14,118 --> 00:54:15,388
We go in from here, right?

1491
00:54:15,888 --> 00:54:17,586
It's pretty. It's really pretty.

1492
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:19,057
It is really pretty.

1493
00:54:19,058 --> 00:54:20,456
It's great.

1494
00:54:20,457 --> 00:54:21,527
Let's go in.

1495
00:54:22,058 --> 00:54:23,127
(Let's go in.)

1496
00:54:23,598 --> 00:54:24,868
(Goodness)

1497
00:54:26,468 --> 00:54:28,336
- Gosh. - What is it? It's pretty.

1498
00:54:28,337 --> 00:54:29,967
It must be a hot place.

1499
00:54:29,968 --> 00:54:31,106
- There's a waiting list. - A waiting list?

1500
00:54:31,107 --> 00:54:32,468
They really have one.

1501
00:54:33,607 --> 00:54:35,937
(They have a waiting list ready.)

1502
00:54:38,178 --> 00:54:40,147
My eyes are brightened.

1503
00:54:40,618 --> 00:54:42,047
My eyes are brightened.

1504
00:54:42,348 --> 00:54:43,348
It's pretty.

1505
00:54:43,518 --> 00:54:45,487
It's nice and cozy here.

1506
00:54:45,488 --> 00:54:47,658
(For what special dessert is this place...)

1507
00:54:48,257 --> 00:54:52,288
(full of cute teddy bears is famous for?)

1508
00:54:53,027 --> 00:54:54,397
This place must be real.

1509
00:54:54,957 --> 00:54:56,557
- It's pretty. - This must be a real hot place.

1510
00:54:56,558 --> 00:54:58,968
I can't believe they have a place like this these days.

1511
00:54:59,527 --> 00:55:02,436
- My eyes are brightened. - This cafe looks real.

1512
00:55:02,437 --> 00:55:04,337
The menu is...

1513
00:55:06,468 --> 00:55:08,237
- Hello. - Hello.

1514
00:55:08,238 --> 00:55:09,937
The menu...

1515
00:55:10,178 --> 00:55:11,647
The menu here is great.

1516
00:55:12,007 --> 00:55:14,046
They have tiramisu.

1517
00:55:14,047 --> 00:55:17,086
- Hello. - They have basque cheesecake.

1518
00:55:17,087 --> 00:55:18,387
(Everyone is looking.)

1519
00:55:18,388 --> 00:55:20,756
The cup-cakes are popular these days.

1520
00:55:20,757 --> 00:55:22,586
- They look really delicious. - They look delicious.

1521
00:55:22,587 --> 00:55:24,327
Chestnut tiramisu is popular these days.

1522
00:55:24,328 --> 00:55:26,688
Yes, that's right. They have the popular chestnut tiramisu.

1523
00:55:27,698 --> 00:55:30,567
(They have a variety of desserts.)

1524
00:55:30,968 --> 00:55:33,937
(But it seems quite ordinary. Which dessert came from Hwaseong?)

1525
00:55:34,397 --> 00:55:35,998
They have that here, Hye Lyun.

1526
00:55:36,468 --> 00:55:37,937
You can have half-and-half drinks.

1527
00:55:38,408 --> 00:55:40,336
- Right. - Like half-and-half noodles.

1528
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:41,337
Right.

1529
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:43,938
You choose that if you want to drink to different kinds of drink.

1530
00:55:44,178 --> 00:55:45,807
Like half-and-half noodles.

1531
00:55:45,808 --> 00:55:47,247
Even the cup is made that way.

1532
00:55:47,248 --> 00:55:48,617
It's divided into two.

1533
00:55:48,618 --> 00:55:50,487
Jae Suk, do you want to drink half with me?

1534
00:55:50,488 --> 00:55:51,988
- What? - Half a cup of coffee.

1535
00:55:52,748 --> 00:55:55,086
Do you want to drink half-and-half coffee with me?

1536
00:55:55,087 --> 00:55:56,657
Can't we just drink a cup each?

1537
00:55:56,658 --> 00:55:58,388
(Can't we just drink a cup each, brother?)

1538
00:55:58,857 --> 00:55:59,927
(Laughing)

1539
00:55:59,928 --> 00:56:01,197
Gosh. That's mean.

1540
00:56:01,198 --> 00:56:03,457
One drink is six dollars.

1541
00:56:03,768 --> 00:56:05,626
- For half-and-half, it's 8 for 2. - Yes, it is.

1542
00:56:05,627 --> 00:56:07,198
Yes, it is.

1543
00:56:07,968 --> 00:56:09,198
It is.

1544
00:56:09,598 --> 00:56:10,907
Yes, it is.

1545
00:56:10,908 --> 00:56:13,067
(This menu doesn't seem right.)

1546
00:56:13,408 --> 00:56:15,577
This is 75cm.

1547
00:56:15,578 --> 00:56:17,606
- What is it? - It's 45 to 75cm.

1548
00:56:17,607 --> 00:56:19,046
What is that?

1549
00:56:19,047 --> 00:56:21,347
That makes no sense.

1550
00:56:21,348 --> 00:56:23,316
- Really? - It's 75cm.

1551
00:56:23,317 --> 00:56:25,146
- That is... - It says it's 75cm.

1552
00:56:25,147 --> 00:56:27,017
(Sixth Sense members found something.)

1553
00:56:27,018 --> 00:56:29,617
It means that it is slightly less than 1m.

1554
00:56:29,618 --> 00:56:30,927
It's this big.

1555
00:56:30,928 --> 00:56:32,256
- It is. - Then how...

1556
00:56:32,257 --> 00:56:33,896
do they fix it?

1557
00:56:33,897 --> 00:56:35,198
It will collapse.

1558
00:56:36,158 --> 00:56:38,626
There's always a waiting line.

1559
00:56:38,627 --> 00:56:40,567
And it is always full.

1560
00:56:41,198 --> 00:56:44,836
If you search Haenggung-dong dessert cafes in the search engine,

1561
00:56:44,837 --> 00:56:47,437
our store is always the first in the results.

1562
00:56:47,908 --> 00:56:50,948
(What is the reason why customers are crazy about this place?)

1563
00:56:52,448 --> 00:56:54,618
(It's because of the great looks of the desserts.)

1564
00:56:54,948 --> 00:56:58,888
(And among them, the best of best is...)

1565
00:56:59,687 --> 00:57:00,687
(Goodness)

1566
00:57:00,688 --> 00:57:02,617
(the great look of the 75cm dessert.)

1567
00:57:02,618 --> 00:57:04,888
It's really big.

1568
00:57:05,158 --> 00:57:08,756
It was impressive when I saw it on social media.

1569
00:57:08,757 --> 00:57:11,428
I know that it was famous for about 1 to 2 years.

1570
00:57:12,167 --> 00:57:16,138
(The dessert from Hwaseong is?)

1571
00:57:16,368 --> 00:57:19,868
- Is the popular dessert here 75cm? - Yes.

1572
00:57:20,277 --> 00:57:21,476
- It could be too much. - Why is it so expensive?

1573
00:57:21,477 --> 00:57:22,776
But still, 75cm is...

1574
00:57:22,777 --> 00:57:25,047
- It's 49.5 dollars? - It's 49.5 dollars?

1575
00:57:25,578 --> 00:57:26,916
It's 40...

1576
00:57:26,917 --> 00:57:28,146
(40 dollars?)

1577
00:57:28,147 --> 00:57:31,947
- But there's a lot of it inside. - But...

1578
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:34,417
- That's incredible. - That's incredible.

1579
00:57:35,288 --> 00:57:38,026
- The long parfait... - We'll have that.

1580
00:57:38,027 --> 00:57:39,586
We'll take one 75cm one.

1581
00:57:39,587 --> 00:57:41,097
- The 75cm. - The 75cm one.

1582
00:57:41,098 --> 00:57:43,827
- Could you just give us that? - Order as you please.

1583
00:57:43,828 --> 00:57:45,467
If we order one each, it could be too much.

1584
00:57:45,468 --> 00:57:46,997
Shall we go upstairs and see?

1585
00:57:46,998 --> 00:57:48,937
- It's pretty. Yes. - Shall we go up together?

1586
00:57:49,698 --> 00:57:52,968
Mimi, it will be so much fun if you come with your friends.

1587
00:57:53,468 --> 00:57:54,477
Gosh.

1588
00:57:54,877 --> 00:57:57,847
This is great. It's so nice here.

1589
00:57:57,848 --> 00:57:59,408
This looks so much fun.

1590
00:58:00,047 --> 00:58:02,146
- This place is great. - It's so nice.

1591
00:58:02,147 --> 00:58:04,348
- It must be a birthday party zone. - Yes.

1592
00:58:06,187 --> 00:58:07,256
This is so nice.

1593
00:58:07,257 --> 00:58:08,357
Isn't it?

1594
00:58:09,158 --> 00:58:11,558
(Social media mood photo spot)

1595
00:58:12,788 --> 00:58:14,057
- Like an attic vibe. - Yes.

1596
00:58:14,058 --> 00:58:15,597
This is fun.

1597
00:58:15,598 --> 00:58:16,773
(2nd floor has an attic concept.)

1598
00:58:16,797 --> 00:58:18,397
I think you can take nice pictures here.

1599
00:58:19,098 --> 00:58:21,097
I think you can take nice pictures over there with the good lights.

1600
00:58:21,098 --> 00:58:23,137
The vibe here itself is for a popular place.

1601
00:58:23,138 --> 00:58:24,336
It's so pretty.

1602
00:58:24,337 --> 00:58:25,514
(The mirror next to the stairs will make you take great pictures.)

1603
00:58:25,538 --> 00:58:26,566
- Kyung Pyo. - Yes?

1604
00:58:26,567 --> 00:58:28,776
Take a picture with this here. With the mirror.

1605
00:58:28,777 --> 00:58:30,138
You look pretty in the picture.

1606
00:58:30,547 --> 00:58:33,448
Here. Take a picture of your reflection.

1607
00:58:34,147 --> 00:58:35,477
Mimi, look here.

1608
00:58:36,118 --> 00:58:38,816
- It's so kitsch here. - Yes.

1609
00:58:38,817 --> 00:58:41,256
- Photos look like a sticker photo. - Yes. It's pretty.

1610
00:58:41,257 --> 00:58:42,717
It's fun.

1611
00:58:42,718 --> 00:58:44,063
(A group shot of Sixth Sense members that will be bombarded with likes)

1612
00:58:44,087 --> 00:58:45,987
- Gosh. It's so pretty. - It's so pretty.

1613
00:58:45,988 --> 00:58:46,997
Awesome.

1614
00:58:46,998 --> 00:58:48,558
- Isn't the background pretty? - It is.

1615
00:58:48,598 --> 00:58:51,597
But why are the two guests not coming up?

1616
00:58:51,598 --> 00:58:53,074
(But why are the two guests not coming up?)

1617
00:58:53,098 --> 00:58:55,237
- This is fun. - I know.

1618
00:58:55,238 --> 00:58:57,706
It's very fun. Look at this, Kyung Hwan.

1619
00:58:57,707 --> 00:58:58,707
(It's very fun. Look at this.)

1620
00:58:58,708 --> 00:58:59,837
Lovebirds.

1621
00:58:59,937 --> 00:59:01,107
(Screaming)

1622
00:59:01,207 --> 00:59:04,147
You have to send me a photo when you get home.

1623
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,476
It's so pretty upstairs.

1624
00:59:05,477 --> 00:59:08,146
- It must be. - It's exploding with a good vibe.

1625
00:59:08,147 --> 00:59:09,977
It was fun to take photos. Yes.

1626
00:59:12,587 --> 00:59:13,857
Those lovebirds again.

1627
00:59:14,087 --> 00:59:15,257
- Gosh. - Goodness.

1628
00:59:15,357 --> 00:59:16,816
- Lovebirds. - Jae Suk bought them for me.

1629
00:59:16,817 --> 00:59:18,757
- Gosh. That one looks cool. - Yes.

1630
00:59:19,488 --> 00:59:21,698
Her husband is a friend of mine.

1631
00:59:21,828 --> 00:59:23,226
- Really? - Yes.

1632
00:59:23,227 --> 00:59:25,796
My friend from the elementary school is also a friend of her husband.

1633
00:59:25,797 --> 00:59:26,827
(He's also a friend of my elementary school friend.)

1634
00:59:26,828 --> 00:59:28,296
- So... - That friend...

1635
00:59:28,297 --> 00:59:29,797
from the elementary school,

1636
00:59:29,937 --> 00:59:32,706
- had a crush on Eun Yi. - No, I had a crush on him.

1637
00:59:32,707 --> 00:59:33,808
- Is that so? - Yes.

1638
00:59:34,707 --> 00:59:37,307
I thought that was what I heard.

1639
00:59:37,308 --> 00:59:40,447
Her husband is a friend of a guy who Eun Yi had a crush one.

1640
00:59:40,448 --> 00:59:41,877
- Is that so? - Yes.

1641
00:59:42,317 --> 00:59:44,948
By the way, if things went well with that guy...

1642
00:59:47,388 --> 00:59:49,087
- He's married, though. - Is that so?

1643
00:59:51,227 --> 00:59:54,597
(Cho Hye Lyun, Eun Yi's good friend, doesn't know much about her.)

1644
00:59:54,598 --> 00:59:56,598
She only has sparse information.

1645
00:59:57,397 --> 00:59:59,928
- I felt bad for you. - Did you?

1646
01:00:00,067 --> 01:00:03,336
Is there anyone who is nice that you want to set me up with?

1647
01:00:03,337 --> 01:00:05,207
(No, there isn't.)

1648
01:00:05,707 --> 01:00:08,106
- You weren't looking for them. - You didn't even consider it.

1649
01:00:08,107 --> 01:00:09,807
Why did you answer without thinking a bit?

1650
01:00:09,808 --> 01:00:10,847
(Adamant)

1651
01:00:10,848 --> 01:00:11,876
There's no one.

1652
01:00:11,877 --> 01:00:14,816
(It's fun to talk about his friend's dating life.)

1653
01:00:14,817 --> 01:00:17,393
By the way, this place feels real even though I didn't look around.

1654
01:00:17,417 --> 01:00:20,988
- I mean 75cm didn't come from... - Shouldn't we consider it real?

1655
01:00:21,257 --> 01:00:23,517
Actually, I can't imagine it being 75cm tall.

1656
01:00:23,518 --> 01:00:25,988
If it's 75cm, it's about this tall.

1657
01:00:26,558 --> 01:00:28,296
Gosh. I'm curious about it, indeed.

1658
01:00:28,297 --> 01:00:30,126
Kyung Hwan has a good amount of experience, so...

1659
01:00:30,127 --> 01:00:31,697
- What? It's coming. - Is it coming?

1660
01:00:31,698 --> 01:00:33,328
- What? It's coming. - Is it coming?

1661
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:35,368
- Gosh. It's so big. - What?

1662
01:00:36,238 --> 01:00:37,307
What?

1663
01:00:37,308 --> 01:00:38,567
How did they make it?

1664
01:00:39,038 --> 01:00:40,606
Gosh. Both of them are coming.

1665
01:00:40,607 --> 01:00:41,776
Gosh.

1666
01:00:41,777 --> 01:00:43,377
We won't be able to eat them all.

1667
01:00:43,408 --> 01:00:44,447
Is this for real?

1668
01:00:44,448 --> 01:00:46,208
- Ma'am, we can't finish it. - It's so much.

1669
01:00:46,277 --> 01:00:47,617
(Eccentric desserts from Hwaseong!)

1670
01:00:47,618 --> 01:00:49,118
What is that?

1671
01:00:53,917 --> 01:00:56,558
(75cm-long parfait)

1672
01:00:56,718 --> 01:00:57,987
- Gosh. - Excuse me.

1673
01:00:57,988 --> 01:00:59,227
- Goodness. - Gosh.

1674
01:00:59,457 --> 01:01:00,626
Hey, we have to film these.

1675
01:01:00,627 --> 01:01:01,827
Apart from everything,

1676
01:01:01,828 --> 01:01:04,097
- What? - there's a bear on it too.

1677
01:01:04,098 --> 01:01:06,226
I thought it was supposed to use one.

1678
01:01:06,227 --> 01:01:07,467
Gosh. What is this?

1679
01:01:07,468 --> 01:01:09,336
- It's truly amazing. - Gosh. What?

1680
01:01:09,337 --> 01:01:11,408
Gosh. It's crazy.

1681
01:01:11,738 --> 01:01:13,206
- It's huge. - Goodness.

1682
01:01:13,207 --> 01:01:15,436
You have to get a closeup to put it on social media,

1683
01:01:15,437 --> 01:01:16,714
but I can't zoom in on this one.

1684
01:01:16,738 --> 01:01:18,177
- It doesn't come in one frame. - How did they make it?

1685
01:01:18,178 --> 01:01:19,808
I'll measure the height.

1686
01:01:20,007 --> 01:01:21,247
(The manager takes out a tape measure.)

1687
01:01:21,248 --> 01:01:23,277
- This is... - Gosh.

1688
01:01:23,518 --> 01:01:25,487
If you would check the measurement,

1689
01:01:25,488 --> 01:01:26,517
She's measuring it.

1690
01:01:26,518 --> 01:01:28,518
- it's 75cm. Yes. - Did you carry it all the time?

1691
01:01:28,687 --> 01:01:30,558
Gosh. They are 75cm high, indeed.

1692
01:01:30,757 --> 01:01:32,626
It's 75cm high.

1693
01:01:32,627 --> 01:01:35,327
(Proving that it's 75cm high right before their eyes)

1694
01:01:35,328 --> 01:01:37,698
- Gosh. It's awesome. - Gosh. This is...

1695
01:01:38,998 --> 01:01:41,397
(What is the 75cm dessert that shocked everyone?)

1696
01:01:43,038 --> 01:01:45,768
(A giant fruit tower)

1697
01:01:46,607 --> 01:01:49,437
(Its height is equal to 5 cellphones stacked up.)

1698
01:01:49,707 --> 01:01:53,848
These days, you have to seize people's attention.

1699
01:01:53,948 --> 01:01:57,546
I looked into which desserts are in trend...

1700
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:58,948
in Japan,

1701
01:01:59,248 --> 01:02:01,916
and I found parfait and souffles are popular.

1702
01:02:01,917 --> 01:02:05,058
I wanted to try making parfait and made this one.

1703
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:08,557
At first, it was 45cm.

1704
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:11,126
I wondered if I could make it taller.

1705
01:02:11,127 --> 01:02:13,297
So I made a 75cm tall one.

1706
01:02:14,868 --> 01:02:18,238
We have specially made 75cm-long skewers.

1707
01:02:18,468 --> 01:02:19,936
We use three skewers,

1708
01:02:19,937 --> 01:02:22,707
so we have to pile up a total of 60 strawberries.

1709
01:02:23,738 --> 01:02:24,876
(What is the key to build 75cm-long parfait?)

1710
01:02:24,877 --> 01:02:28,018
The whipped cream is crucial in holding the fruits.

1711
01:02:28,248 --> 01:02:31,387
By using a certain ratio and skills, we've made the whipped cream...

1712
01:02:31,388 --> 01:02:34,018
that's not greasy but holds the fruits well.

1713
01:02:34,658 --> 01:02:36,586
We fill up the gaps between the fruits...

1714
01:02:36,587 --> 01:02:39,057
to hold them stably.

1715
01:02:39,058 --> 01:02:42,896
That's how we successfully made the 75cm-tall parfait.

1716
01:02:42,897 --> 01:02:45,268
(The 75cm parfait is complete.)

1717
01:02:45,368 --> 01:02:47,237
(In addition to food-eating content creators, )

1718
01:02:47,238 --> 01:02:48,638
(It tilted while I danced with it.)

1719
01:02:49,598 --> 01:02:54,737
(the photos of it are overflowing on social media and clips.)

1720
01:02:54,738 --> 01:02:56,206
Since it's visually pleasing,

1721
01:02:56,207 --> 01:02:59,078
many people come after seeing it on social media or YouTube.

1722
01:03:00,078 --> 01:03:01,876
Once they try it,

1723
01:03:01,877 --> 01:03:04,047
they revisit us, saying it's tasty.

1724
01:03:07,288 --> 01:03:09,557
It's because we use good ingredients.

1725
01:03:09,558 --> 01:03:11,103
(Highly sweet and premium Sancheong strawberries)

1726
01:03:11,127 --> 01:03:13,287
We buy the best-quality strawberries...

1727
01:03:13,288 --> 01:03:15,797
in auction every morning.

1728
01:03:16,698 --> 01:03:19,968
We usually use over ten boxes of strawberries a day.

1729
01:03:20,167 --> 01:03:22,537
Thanks to the customers coming here for the long parfait,

1730
01:03:22,538 --> 01:03:24,166
our cafe is always full.

1731
01:03:24,167 --> 01:03:25,206
(Thanks to the signature parfait, the cafe is always full!)

1732
01:03:25,207 --> 01:03:27,678
On weekdays, the sales are over 1,000 dollars.

1733
01:03:27,808 --> 01:03:30,808
On weekends, they're over 2,000 dollars a day.

1734
01:03:31,207 --> 01:03:34,377
Sixth Sense members, is this menu real?

1735
01:03:36,218 --> 01:03:37,218
- It's 75cm tall. - Wait.

1736
01:03:37,219 --> 01:03:38,987
If it's this big,

1737
01:03:38,988 --> 01:03:40,887
two people can't finish it.

1738
01:03:40,888 --> 01:03:42,316
Two people do finish it...

1739
01:03:42,317 --> 01:03:44,287
if they're YouTube content creators and big eaters.

1740
01:03:44,288 --> 01:03:46,026
Usually, 4 people finish 1.

1741
01:03:46,027 --> 01:03:47,527
- Four people. - Yes.

1742
01:03:47,797 --> 01:03:48,896
- It's crazy. - Please enjoy.

1743
01:03:48,897 --> 01:03:49,956
This place is real.

1744
01:03:49,957 --> 01:03:51,927
- It can't be fake. - It just can't be fake.

1745
01:03:51,928 --> 01:03:53,126
- Gosh. - It's worth...

1746
01:03:53,127 --> 01:03:54,296
49 dollars and 50 cents, indeed.

1747
01:03:54,297 --> 01:03:55,537
- That's right. - They have to be that expensive.

1748
01:03:55,538 --> 01:03:56,697
- Yes. - It's almost a box of strawberries.

1749
01:03:56,698 --> 01:03:58,006
- They used the whole box. - Gosh.

1750
01:03:58,007 --> 01:03:59,936
- They used more than a box. - Yes. It's more than a box.

1751
01:03:59,937 --> 01:04:02,137
These days, a box of strawberries...

1752
01:04:02,138 --> 01:04:04,277
- only have 15 of them. - There aren't many.

1753
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:05,908
Gosh. This is truly...

1754
01:04:06,607 --> 01:04:08,776
We're supposed to eat them from the top.

1755
01:04:08,777 --> 01:04:10,547
- Yes. - How?

1756
01:04:10,788 --> 01:04:12,988
- You have to pull it out. - How do we do that?

1757
01:04:13,317 --> 01:04:15,488
- This is thrilling. - Gosh.

1758
01:04:15,587 --> 01:04:17,887
- Gosh. Thank you. - Goodness.

1759
01:04:17,888 --> 01:04:19,226
The tip of it is showing now.

1760
01:04:19,227 --> 01:04:21,333
(They distribute it after pulling it out one by one.)

1761
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:22,756
- This is... - Gosh.

1762
01:04:22,757 --> 01:04:23,797
This is...

1763
01:04:25,368 --> 01:04:26,896
(Staggering)

1764
01:04:26,897 --> 01:04:28,437
- Gosh. We have to be careful. - Gosh.

1765
01:04:29,038 --> 01:04:30,836
It feels like Jenga.

1766
01:04:30,837 --> 01:04:32,307
- That's true. - Goodness.

1767
01:04:32,308 --> 01:04:34,307
- It's thrilling. - It is.

1768
01:04:34,308 --> 01:04:36,106
- It's like a challenge. - Mimi.

1769
01:04:36,107 --> 01:04:37,238
- Yes. - This is for Mimi.

1770
01:04:37,448 --> 01:04:38,677
- Okay. - Let's try it.

1771
01:04:38,678 --> 01:04:39,747
Try it now.

1772
01:04:39,748 --> 01:04:44,847
(Sweet whipped cream on strawberries and Shine Muscat)

1773
01:04:44,848 --> 01:04:47,287
The combination of whipped cream and strawberries can't go wrong.

1774
01:04:47,288 --> 01:04:50,457
(How does the visually-exciting 75cm-tall parfait taste?)

1775
01:04:50,587 --> 01:04:51,857
Gosh.

1776
01:04:52,788 --> 01:04:53,827
(Savoring)

1777
01:04:53,828 --> 01:04:54,857
It's tasty.

1778
01:04:55,357 --> 01:04:58,468
(The juicy fruits fill up their mouths.)

1779
01:05:01,638 --> 01:05:02,666
(Savoring)

1780
01:05:02,667 --> 01:05:04,167
This is how you do it.

1781
01:05:05,437 --> 01:05:06,467
- Is it good? - Come.

1782
01:05:06,468 --> 01:05:08,607
It's good. Have it with the whipped cream.

1783
01:05:09,308 --> 01:05:10,677
(How about Mimi, the dessert lover?)

1784
01:05:10,678 --> 01:05:11,747
It's good.

1785
01:05:11,748 --> 01:05:15,218
(Crunchy, chewy)

1786
01:05:15,848 --> 01:05:18,117
The cream tastes like buttercream.

1787
01:05:18,118 --> 01:05:19,186
(It tastes like flavorful and sweet buttercream.)

1788
01:05:19,187 --> 01:05:20,247
The taste of it...

1789
01:05:20,248 --> 01:05:21,888
- It's so good. - It's really tasty.

1790
01:05:24,058 --> 01:05:25,856
- It's fresh. - It's good.

1791
01:05:25,857 --> 01:05:27,857
(Happy Kyung Pyo has one bite!)

1792
01:05:28,198 --> 01:05:29,497
The whipped cream is very tasty too.

1793
01:05:29,498 --> 01:05:30,997
- Yes. - Totally.

1794
01:05:30,998 --> 01:05:32,026
- Gosh. - It's good.

1795
01:05:32,027 --> 01:05:34,637
- YCGWWI. - Right.

1796
01:05:34,638 --> 01:05:36,538
- YCGWWI? - You can't go wrong with it.

1797
01:05:36,698 --> 01:05:38,206
You can't go wrong with it.

1798
01:05:38,207 --> 01:05:40,106
(Sixth Sense Dictionary: YCGWWI, You can't go wrong with it.)

1799
01:05:40,107 --> 01:05:41,178
You can't.

1800
01:05:45,408 --> 01:05:47,007
But it's a bit cumbersome.

1801
01:05:47,718 --> 01:05:49,017
- Right? - A little.

1802
01:05:49,018 --> 01:05:50,276
- You have to stand up and down. - Yes.

1803
01:05:50,277 --> 01:05:51,487
- You stand up and sit down. - It's a little...

1804
01:05:51,488 --> 01:05:53,646
Do we have time for this? I think it's fake.

1805
01:05:53,647 --> 01:05:55,857
- I have a reasonable doubt. - Okay.

1806
01:05:56,158 --> 01:05:59,987
When they actually sell it,

1807
01:05:59,988 --> 01:06:01,626
will people put up with this inconvenience?

1808
01:06:01,627 --> 01:06:03,158
(Sighing)

1809
01:06:03,658 --> 01:06:04,796
(Is that so?)

1810
01:06:04,797 --> 01:06:06,428
(Thinking)

1811
01:06:07,127 --> 01:06:08,137
Imagine this place filled with people.

1812
01:06:08,138 --> 01:06:10,167
- They are all doing this. - Yes.

1813
01:06:10,297 --> 01:06:12,808
(Are they all on their feet to eat?)

1814
01:06:12,968 --> 01:06:15,538
But not all of them would order this.

1815
01:06:18,277 --> 01:06:20,877
Come on. I'm doing my job.

1816
01:06:21,618 --> 01:06:23,617
(Laughing)

1817
01:06:23,618 --> 01:06:25,488
My mustache is growing again.

1818
01:06:25,917 --> 01:06:27,657
It has grown so much.

1819
01:06:27,658 --> 01:06:28,987
It grows when someone attacks me.

1820
01:06:28,988 --> 01:06:30,487
(Dark)

1821
01:06:30,488 --> 01:06:33,787
Wait. We analyze it because we're here together.

1822
01:06:33,788 --> 01:06:35,297
Imagine coming here with friends.

1823
01:06:35,298 --> 01:06:36,998
- Won't it be just fun? - True.

1824
01:06:37,128 --> 01:06:38,767
It's perfect for a date.

1825
01:06:38,868 --> 01:06:40,367
- You're right. - That's right.

1826
01:06:40,368 --> 01:06:42,597
But if it's over 40 dollars,

1827
01:06:42,967 --> 01:06:44,937
the couple ought to love each other so much.

1828
01:06:45,467 --> 01:06:46,827
- Love each other so much? - Gosh.

1829
01:06:47,038 --> 01:06:48,207
- What? - What did you say?

1830
01:06:48,208 --> 01:06:50,337
- My limit is 25 dollars. - Does that mean...

1831
01:06:50,338 --> 01:06:52,247
I see. It's too expensive?

1832
01:06:52,248 --> 01:06:53,907
- Yes. If it's over 40 dollars. - Right.

1833
01:06:53,908 --> 01:06:55,816
But there's a 45cm-tall one too.

1834
01:06:55,817 --> 01:06:58,417
Right. There's a 45cm-tall one.

1835
01:06:58,418 --> 01:07:00,287
Right. There's a smaller one too.

1836
01:07:00,288 --> 01:07:01,894
(If there are 2 people, can they have the 45cm parfait?)

1837
01:07:01,918 --> 01:07:04,186
(They have the detail to have the 45cm-tall parfait.)

1838
01:07:04,187 --> 01:07:06,587
(Is this place real?)

1839
01:07:06,588 --> 01:07:09,096
Actually, when I have parfait, I love this part on the bottom.

1840
01:07:09,097 --> 01:07:10,127
Me too.

1841
01:07:10,128 --> 01:07:12,297
When do I get to eat it?

1842
01:07:12,298 --> 01:07:14,798
The ice cream will melt when we reach the bottom.

1843
01:07:14,897 --> 01:07:17,396
I want to flip it and take the fruits out quickly.

1844
01:07:17,397 --> 01:07:18,436
Yes. Me too.

1845
01:07:18,437 --> 01:07:19,606
(In that case...)

1846
01:07:19,607 --> 01:07:21,837
How about this? Why don't I pull one skewer out?

1847
01:07:21,838 --> 01:07:23,636
- It might collapse. - It might fall down.

1848
01:07:23,637 --> 01:07:25,606
I think the whipped cream acts as glue.

1849
01:07:25,607 --> 01:07:28,077
- Do you want to try it? - I'll take it out and...

1850
01:07:28,078 --> 01:07:29,917
If you want to do it so badly, you can go ahead.

1851
01:07:29,918 --> 01:07:31,488
Should I ask you to have each skewer?

1852
01:07:31,847 --> 01:07:33,618
(Pulling)

1853
01:07:34,488 --> 01:07:35,686
It worked.

1854
01:07:35,687 --> 01:07:38,287
- It came out easily. - It came out easily.

1855
01:07:38,288 --> 01:07:39,727
That's nice.

1856
01:07:39,927 --> 01:07:41,596
They want us to take them out like this.

1857
01:07:41,597 --> 01:07:43,896
- Like that. - I see.

1858
01:07:43,897 --> 01:07:45,266
Yes. That's nice.

1859
01:07:45,267 --> 01:07:47,266
After taking a photo and all...

1860
01:07:47,267 --> 01:07:49,136
Once it's done, you can eat it comfortably.

1861
01:07:49,137 --> 01:07:51,136
- It's a strawberry cake. - It's a cake now.

1862
01:07:51,137 --> 01:07:52,208
It's a strawberry cake.

1863
01:07:52,908 --> 01:07:55,937
(Let's make a Shine Muscat cake this time!)

1864
01:07:55,977 --> 01:07:57,748
- Gosh. - It's pouring.

1865
01:07:58,177 --> 01:08:00,676
The amount of it is crazy!

1866
01:08:00,677 --> 01:08:01,677
(Licking)

1867
01:08:01,678 --> 01:08:03,676
- The amount of it is crazy! - Hye Lyun.

1868
01:08:03,677 --> 01:08:05,346
But you licked your finger.

1869
01:08:05,347 --> 01:08:06,917
(That's a bit...)

1870
01:08:06,918 --> 01:08:08,718
You're not a waitress at a gukbap restaurant.

1871
01:08:08,758 --> 01:08:10,193
Didn't you dip your finger too deep?

1872
01:08:10,217 --> 01:08:12,556
(She served the whipped cream as if it's gukbap.)

1873
01:08:12,557 --> 01:08:14,998
Gosh. I'm not going to eat the last part.

1874
01:08:16,227 --> 01:08:19,167
- He won't eat the last part. - I saw it.

1875
01:08:19,168 --> 01:08:20,396
(I'm really not going to eat it.)

1876
01:08:20,397 --> 01:08:22,237
Now, we can enjoy the parfait.

1877
01:08:22,238 --> 01:08:23,397
It's vanilla.

1878
01:08:23,798 --> 01:08:25,667
The ice cream? Is it vanilla ice cream?

1879
01:08:25,668 --> 01:08:26,668
It looks good.

1880
01:08:27,067 --> 01:08:31,248
(It's time to taste the long-anticipated parfait!)

1881
01:08:31,677 --> 01:08:35,448
(Taking a bite of the parfait)

1882
01:08:35,618 --> 01:08:36,618
(Mimi, the dessert lover, takes a bite too.)

1883
01:08:36,618 --> 01:08:37,618
It's good.

1884
01:08:38,847 --> 01:08:39,887
Gosh. It's good.

1885
01:08:40,687 --> 01:08:42,458
- It tastes different. - Yes.

1886
01:08:43,357 --> 01:08:44,757
The ice cream tastes good.

1887
01:08:44,758 --> 01:08:45,857
(Biting)

1888
01:08:47,458 --> 01:08:48,896
(Clapping)

1889
01:08:48,897 --> 01:08:50,297
Mimi eats well.

1890
01:08:50,298 --> 01:08:51,298
(She's happy)

1891
01:08:52,668 --> 01:08:54,667
(Hye Lyun tries it too.)

1892
01:08:54,668 --> 01:08:55,668
Mimi, this one too.

1893
01:08:56,267 --> 01:08:57,297
The ice cream tastes good.

1894
01:08:57,298 --> 01:09:00,467
(Looking carefully)

1895
01:09:00,977 --> 01:09:02,037
Listen, everyone.

1896
01:09:02,038 --> 01:09:03,436
They give you these spoons...

1897
01:09:03,437 --> 01:09:04,846
- to use when you eat. - Yes.

1898
01:09:04,847 --> 01:09:06,207
That means it has been around.

1899
01:09:06,208 --> 01:09:07,247
(This is a real shop!)

1900
01:09:07,248 --> 01:09:09,017
They wouldn't have thought this far.

1901
01:09:09,147 --> 01:09:10,227
- They would. - They would.

1902
01:09:10,647 --> 01:09:12,216
(Really?)

1903
01:09:12,217 --> 01:09:13,917
- These are spoons for parfait. - It's...

1904
01:09:13,918 --> 01:09:15,686
It's what we can think of here.

1905
01:09:15,687 --> 01:09:19,158
Traditionally, the parfait spoons look like this.

1906
01:09:19,628 --> 01:09:20,628
You didn't have parfait...

1907
01:09:20,629 --> 01:09:21,657
- when you were in school, right? - Right.

1908
01:09:21,658 --> 01:09:23,258
I was poor.

1909
01:09:23,527 --> 01:09:25,727
- I didn't know what parfait was. - What?

1910
01:09:26,597 --> 01:09:28,368
(It's okay, Brother.)

1911
01:09:28,637 --> 01:09:29,667
I didn't know.

1912
01:09:29,668 --> 01:09:31,937
(You have your own signature move.)

1913
01:09:32,067 --> 01:09:33,067
(Laughing)

1914
01:09:34,878 --> 01:09:36,777
(That was hilarious.)

1915
01:09:37,307 --> 01:09:39,277
(Satisfied.)

1916
01:09:39,878 --> 01:09:42,117
(He's serious alone while others are laughing.)

1917
01:09:42,118 --> 01:09:43,998
- I found the con of the parfait. - What is it?

1918
01:09:44,217 --> 01:09:45,886
(What is the con that Kyung Hwan found?)

1919
01:09:45,887 --> 01:09:47,186
- Look. - Kyung Hwan.

1920
01:09:47,187 --> 01:09:49,657
We had so much ice cream that the flavors...

1921
01:09:49,658 --> 01:09:50,988
are unbalanced.

1922
01:09:51,658 --> 01:09:53,787
(I have a catchphrase too.)

1923
01:09:53,788 --> 01:09:55,396
I had to do it. Sorry.

1924
01:09:55,397 --> 01:09:56,697
Gosh. That was hilarious.

1925
01:09:56,698 --> 01:09:57,766
(Laughing)

1926
01:09:57,767 --> 01:10:00,726
He's so funny. "Unbalanced."

1927
01:10:00,727 --> 01:10:02,667
- Come on. - It's unbalanced.

1928
01:10:02,668 --> 01:10:03,668
(Proud)

1929
01:10:03,669 --> 01:10:05,306
Okay. Sure.

1930
01:10:05,307 --> 01:10:06,636
(Good job, my brother!)

1931
01:10:06,637 --> 01:10:07,677
Gosh. That was hilarious.

1932
01:10:09,977 --> 01:10:11,048
By the way, this one...

1933
01:10:12,477 --> 01:10:14,078
is also perfect as a menu.

1934
01:10:14,748 --> 01:10:18,088
- It's tasty too. - It's perfectly in harmony.

1935
01:10:18,347 --> 01:10:20,386
- Yes. - It's harder than the last time.

1936
01:10:20,387 --> 01:10:21,417
- It's hard. - It's so hard.

1937
01:10:21,418 --> 01:10:23,658
This is a real place. No doubt.

1938
01:10:23,887 --> 01:10:26,727
As for the taste, it has been perfect in both places.

1939
01:10:27,088 --> 01:10:28,557
I think this one really exists.

1940
01:10:28,727 --> 01:10:30,698
Gosh. I have no idea.

1941
01:10:31,427 --> 01:10:33,566
(It's a bit inconvenient to eat.)

1942
01:10:33,567 --> 01:10:34,966
(It's big but expensive.)

1943
01:10:34,967 --> 01:10:36,887
(The combination of flavors that has to be good)

1944
01:10:40,238 --> 01:10:41,306
(The third trendy place: Eccentric skewers from Hwaseong)

1945
01:10:41,307 --> 01:10:42,806
- The last one is... - Skewers.

1946
01:10:42,807 --> 01:10:44,647
- Skewers. - Its keyword was skewers.

1947
01:10:45,847 --> 01:10:46,908
Gosh. I'm full.

1948
01:10:47,548 --> 01:10:49,817
Are we going to eat again after having desserts?

1949
01:10:50,017 --> 01:10:52,216
We're on our way to have skewers. It's the last spot.

1950
01:10:52,217 --> 01:10:53,886
What kind of skewers will they be?

1951
01:10:53,887 --> 01:10:55,557
Right. What will they be?

1952
01:10:55,887 --> 01:10:57,387
They won't be insects, will they?

1953
01:10:57,988 --> 01:10:59,158
- Come on. - Like crickets.

1954
01:10:59,687 --> 01:11:02,458
- How can we eat insects? - I can't eat them at all.

1955
01:11:02,658 --> 01:11:03,926
Gosh. I'll quit.

1956
01:11:03,927 --> 01:11:05,396
(I'll go home, then.)

1957
01:11:05,397 --> 01:11:06,397
Then I won't go in.

1958
01:11:06,398 --> 01:11:08,896
You said you'd be here...

1959
01:11:08,897 --> 01:11:10,338
even without getting paid.

1960
01:11:10,437 --> 01:11:12,117
Gosh. But eating insects is another story.

1961
01:11:12,967 --> 01:11:15,378
- Insects like scorpions. - Right.

1962
01:11:16,078 --> 01:11:17,207
Aren't scorpions all right, though?

1963
01:11:17,208 --> 01:11:18,653
(Aren't scorpions all right, though?)

1964
01:11:18,677 --> 01:11:20,477
- Have you tried them? - How will you eat it?

1965
01:11:21,147 --> 01:11:22,617
I've never tried them,

1966
01:11:22,618 --> 01:11:24,258
but aren't they affiliated with lobsters?

1967
01:11:24,847 --> 01:11:25,918
- You... - Gosh.

1968
01:11:27,347 --> 01:11:28,488
Should never stop learning.

1969
01:11:29,717 --> 01:11:31,717
You shouldn't quit it because you're an adult now.

1970
01:11:33,527 --> 01:11:34,896
You thought a scorpion is the same kind as a lobster.

1971
01:11:34,897 --> 01:11:36,257
I've never heard such a thing.

1972
01:11:36,258 --> 01:11:37,597
Aren't they the same kind?

1973
01:11:38,168 --> 01:11:41,637
(Meanwhile, the old Sixth Sense members)

1974
01:11:42,038 --> 01:11:44,508
- When does your play end? - March 3.

1975
01:11:44,807 --> 01:11:47,937
- I heard it was extended till June. - It was, but it'll get extended.

1976
01:11:48,208 --> 01:11:51,248
- We should go watch it. - Yes. In March. No, February.

1977
01:11:51,878 --> 01:11:53,577
- Nice. - Yes. I'll go in February.

1978
01:11:53,578 --> 01:11:54,717
(Nice. Jae Suk is coming.)

1979
01:11:54,948 --> 01:11:56,977
Jae Suk, don't you want to participate in a play?

1980
01:11:57,847 --> 01:11:59,347
(Acting?)

1981
01:11:59,817 --> 01:12:01,687
He can't act.

1982
01:12:02,458 --> 01:12:03,517
Come on.

1983
01:12:03,817 --> 01:12:04,856
Why not?

1984
01:12:04,857 --> 01:12:06,827
You and acting is... Come to think of it,

1985
01:12:06,828 --> 01:12:08,327
- He can try it. - there was a play...

1986
01:12:08,328 --> 01:12:10,396
- What was it called? - Acting is...

1987
01:12:10,397 --> 01:12:12,426
There was a skit you acted in.

1988
01:12:12,427 --> 01:12:14,837
- Yes. "Reverse Drama." - "Reverse Drama."

1989
01:12:14,838 --> 01:12:16,338
- That was fun. - "Reverse Drama."

1990
01:12:17,137 --> 01:12:21,878
("Match! Reverse Drama" from "SBS Good Sunday")

1991
01:12:23,208 --> 01:12:27,346
(Jae Suk performed as hard as he could 20 years ago.)

1992
01:12:27,347 --> 01:12:29,177
(Uncomfortable)

1993
01:12:29,647 --> 01:12:30,676
(Shushing)

1994
01:12:30,677 --> 01:12:32,118
(Even more uncomfortable)

1995
01:12:32,717 --> 01:12:34,287
They upload old comedy skits...

1996
01:12:34,288 --> 01:12:35,816
- on YouTube. - Yes.

1997
01:12:35,817 --> 01:12:36,817
- Yes. - Right.

1998
01:12:36,818 --> 01:12:38,938
The clips from "Humor No. 1" are uploaded every week.

1999
01:12:39,357 --> 01:12:40,588
I watch it all the time.

2000
01:12:40,687 --> 01:12:42,827
- It was when Jae Suk was a newbie. - Yes.

2001
01:12:42,828 --> 01:12:44,668
- He was a bit... - Yes. That's the fun of it.

2002
01:12:44,927 --> 01:12:47,936
- There was "Red Couch." - What was that?

2003
01:12:47,937 --> 01:12:49,997
- It was a skit in the past. - A skit.

2004
01:12:49,998 --> 01:12:51,337
- An outdoor skit. - "Red Couch?"

2005
01:12:51,338 --> 01:12:53,368
- An outdoor one. - I did it briefly.

2006
01:12:54,807 --> 01:12:56,953
(Jae Suk's first performance when he was 24 years old.)

2007
01:12:56,977 --> 01:12:59,677
(Jae Suk is a teacher assigned to a girls' high school.)

2008
01:13:01,317 --> 01:13:03,147
(Kim Sook, 21 years old)

2009
01:13:03,878 --> 01:13:06,347
(He feels uncomfortable due to the student coming on strong.)

2010
01:13:06,887 --> 01:13:10,158
(No way.)

2011
01:13:11,118 --> 01:13:12,726
It doesn't make sense when I watch it now.

2012
01:13:12,727 --> 01:13:14,628
(Laughing)

2013
01:13:14,897 --> 01:13:15,998
Because it's not funny?

2014
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:17,298
It's not funny.

2015
01:13:18,128 --> 01:13:19,698
In hindsight, I can tell.

2016
01:13:20,298 --> 01:13:22,137
- Why it failed? - Yes.

2017
01:13:23,198 --> 01:13:24,907
(After talking and laughing about the old memories...)

2018
01:13:24,908 --> 01:13:27,207
- This is it. - We're getting out.

2019
01:13:27,208 --> 01:13:29,807
Gosh. Thanks to you, it was warm to get here.

2020
01:13:30,137 --> 01:13:31,208
Thank you.

2021
01:13:33,908 --> 01:13:35,047
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2022
01:13:35,048 --> 01:13:36,176
- Thank you. - They're here.

2023
01:13:36,177 --> 01:13:37,297
Is it because of the camera?

2024
01:13:37,517 --> 01:13:39,646
- Gosh. What is this place? - Skewers.

2025
01:13:39,647 --> 01:13:41,088
- What? "Gari?" - What is that?

2026
01:13:42,057 --> 01:13:44,317
- That one is real. - Is this it?

2027
01:13:46,328 --> 01:13:49,726
(A trendy restaurant in a quiet residential area?)

2028
01:13:49,727 --> 01:13:50,957
- Wait. It's a skewer place. - It's a skewer place.

2029
01:13:50,958 --> 01:13:51,967
(Naengmyeon, skewers)

2030
01:13:52,267 --> 01:13:54,174
- What is that? - What is that? Naengmyeon skewers?

2031
01:13:54,198 --> 01:13:56,038
Naengmyeon skewers?

2032
01:13:56,838 --> 01:13:59,136
- Naengmyeon skewers? Is it... - What's that?

2033
01:13:59,137 --> 01:14:00,137
What does it mean?

2034
01:14:01,238 --> 01:14:02,337
How can you make skewers...

2035
01:14:02,338 --> 01:14:04,338
- with naengmyeon? - Are there naengmyeon skewers?

2036
01:14:04,437 --> 01:14:06,507
- Gari. - Is there such a thing?

2037
01:14:06,508 --> 01:14:08,347
Naengmyeon skewers? Naengmyeon and...

2038
01:14:08,918 --> 01:14:09,948
Gosh. Hello.

2039
01:14:10,777 --> 01:14:11,788
- Hello. - What?

2040
01:14:12,618 --> 01:14:14,058
Bibim naengmyeon and mul naengmyeon.

2041
01:14:14,147 --> 01:14:15,816
- Hello. - Hello.

2042
01:14:15,817 --> 01:14:16,958
It smells good.

2043
01:14:18,288 --> 01:14:19,356
Do we sit here?

2044
01:14:19,357 --> 01:14:23,227
(It looks normal inside too. Which menu made them famous?)

2045
01:14:23,958 --> 01:14:25,026
Will you be able to eat?

2046
01:14:25,027 --> 01:14:26,168
Yes.

2047
01:14:26,267 --> 01:14:27,628
I love noodles.

2048
01:14:27,897 --> 01:14:30,137
What? They really are naengmyeon skewers.

2049
01:14:32,538 --> 01:14:34,367
They are really naengmyeon skewers.

2050
01:14:34,368 --> 01:14:36,276
(It's not naengmyeon with skewers in it.)

2051
01:14:36,277 --> 01:14:37,307
- What? - What is this?

2052
01:14:37,538 --> 01:14:39,276
- They make skewers with naengmyeon. - That's strange.

2053
01:14:39,277 --> 01:14:40,907
(It begins to stir inside.)

2054
01:14:40,908 --> 01:14:41,917
Through halibut?

2055
01:14:41,918 --> 01:14:43,878
(Next to the normal skewers menu...)

2056
01:14:44,078 --> 01:14:45,886
- I don't think this is real. - It's strange.

2057
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:46,948
It's so strange.

2058
01:14:47,488 --> 01:14:50,287
It's not naengmyeon with skewers on it.

2059
01:14:50,288 --> 01:14:51,758
It's naengmyeon as skewers?

2060
01:14:51,857 --> 01:14:54,958
Yes. When you look at the menu, it looks really eccentric.

2061
01:14:55,298 --> 01:14:58,226
- What? - I think it can't be right.

2062
01:14:58,227 --> 01:14:59,997
There are sushi skewers too.

2063
01:14:59,998 --> 01:15:02,837
But I wonder if we need to have sushi in skewers.

2064
01:15:02,838 --> 01:15:03,997
Sushi skewers?

2065
01:15:03,998 --> 01:15:06,567
The owner likes to put a stick into everything.

2066
01:15:07,508 --> 01:15:08,908
- He's into it. - I mean...

2067
01:15:09,137 --> 01:15:12,346
He puts sushi and noodles in a stick.

2068
01:15:12,347 --> 01:15:13,467
Was he a former dart player?

2069
01:15:13,748 --> 01:15:14,788
- A dart player. - It's...

2070
01:15:15,448 --> 01:15:17,128
He pieces almost everything with a skewer.

2071
01:15:17,817 --> 01:15:18,887
Should we order?

2072
01:15:19,317 --> 01:15:21,017
- Sir. - Sir.

2073
01:15:22,418 --> 01:15:24,117
- Gosh. - Hello. Welcome.

2074
01:15:24,118 --> 01:15:26,027
- He's charismatic. - Hello.

2075
01:15:26,557 --> 01:15:29,758
(The charismatic owner appears.)

2076
01:15:29,927 --> 01:15:32,127
Hold on. It feels different after looking at the owner.

2077
01:15:32,527 --> 01:15:34,838
Is that a Korean flag on his clothes?

2078
01:15:35,897 --> 01:15:36,897
Korea's national dish?

2079
01:15:36,898 --> 01:15:39,508
(There's a Korean logo that makes him look like a master.)

2080
01:15:39,908 --> 01:15:41,266
- It feels like... - What is this?

2081
01:15:41,267 --> 01:15:43,477
Not everyone can make these dishes.

2082
01:15:44,137 --> 01:15:47,106
- Sir, we think these menus... - Yes.

2083
01:15:47,107 --> 01:15:49,877
Are so unbalanced.

2084
01:15:49,878 --> 01:15:51,547
These menus are so unbalanced.

2085
01:15:51,548 --> 01:15:53,047
- Right. They are unbalanced. - Unbalanced.

2086
01:15:53,048 --> 01:15:54,817
Why did you come up with them?

2087
01:15:55,488 --> 01:15:58,557
Japan is known for its yakitori, the chicken skewers.

2088
01:16:00,958 --> 01:16:03,328
(The chicken is skewered and grilled in various ways.)

2089
01:16:03,698 --> 01:16:05,597
(Yakitori, Japan's national skewers)

2090
01:16:06,628 --> 01:16:08,497
In China, they have lamb skewers.

2091
01:16:08,498 --> 01:16:10,243
(The skewers roll above a stove to cook lamb.)

2092
01:16:10,267 --> 01:16:12,508
(Lamb skewers, China's national skewers)

2093
01:16:12,767 --> 01:16:15,738
But in Korea, there are no national skewers.

2094
01:16:16,078 --> 01:16:19,676
So I thought of creating the world's first noodle skewers.

2095
01:16:19,677 --> 01:16:20,748
Noodle skewers.

2096
01:16:21,618 --> 01:16:24,347
I can see a trademark registration from here.

2097
01:16:24,618 --> 01:16:26,417
- Trademark registration. - It looks like a patent.

2098
01:16:26,418 --> 01:16:29,158
- Yes. I trademark and all. - Trademark and patent.

2099
01:16:29,458 --> 01:16:31,988
As for the Korean flag shape,

2100
01:16:32,328 --> 01:16:33,827
it's the first trademark with it.

2101
01:16:33,828 --> 01:16:36,197
I'm doing it as Korea's National Skewers.

2102
01:16:36,198 --> 01:16:37,798
(Who is the owner with an unusual vibe?)

2103
01:16:38,727 --> 01:16:40,847
(He dreams of becoming the master of Korean skewers.)

2104
01:16:42,798 --> 01:16:45,337
I wanted to show that we have a various skewer culture...

2105
01:16:45,338 --> 01:16:46,936
in Korea too.

2106
01:16:46,937 --> 01:16:48,514
(Spreading various skewer culture throughout Korea)

2107
01:16:48,538 --> 01:16:50,838
I made the world's first noodle skewers..

2108
01:16:51,107 --> 01:16:53,307
To run this place, and I'm Lim Bong Hak.

2109
01:16:54,378 --> 01:16:57,117
(In a few words, he is riveted...)

2110
01:16:57,118 --> 01:17:00,548
(by the skewers.)

2111
01:17:01,048 --> 01:17:03,556
Because I trademarked...

2112
01:17:03,557 --> 01:17:05,158
Korea's National Skewers,

2113
01:17:05,458 --> 01:17:08,597
I wanted to open a restaurant that lives up to its name.

2114
01:17:09,057 --> 01:17:10,396
(The signature menu...)

2115
01:17:10,397 --> 01:17:11,974
(by the one who includes philosophy in skewers)

2116
01:17:11,998 --> 01:17:14,597
(Naengmyeon and skewers?)

2117
01:17:15,298 --> 01:17:17,258
(The restaurant in the quiet residential area...)

2118
01:17:17,738 --> 01:17:20,737
(is heated up with the eccentric skewers from Hwaseong.)

2119
01:17:20,738 --> 01:17:23,277
I've been selling skewers for 21 years.

2120
01:17:23,738 --> 01:17:25,007
I can say it with confidence...

2121
01:17:25,008 --> 01:17:27,008
that it's the skewer restaurant to go to in Suwon.

2122
01:17:27,277 --> 01:17:28,493
(The menu his customers are crazy about!)

2123
01:17:28,517 --> 01:17:29,676
(The naengmyeon skewers are coming soon.)

2124
01:17:29,677 --> 01:17:31,647
- We should try it first. - Exactly.

2125
01:17:32,088 --> 01:17:34,386
- Can we ask you to cook some? - Yes.

2126
01:17:34,387 --> 01:17:35,917
- Please get us popular ones. - Okay.

2127
01:17:35,918 --> 01:17:38,088
- Get us popular and hot ones. - I'll do that.

2128
01:17:38,727 --> 01:17:41,357
Gosh. This place is...

2129
01:17:42,057 --> 01:17:43,227
It's quite suspicious.

2130
01:17:44,027 --> 01:17:46,267
- I think this place is real. - Why?

2131
01:17:47,227 --> 01:17:48,397
You've been saying that.

2132
01:17:48,897 --> 01:17:51,038
(That every place looks real.)

2133
01:17:51,137 --> 01:17:52,237
Your boss rebukes you.

2134
01:17:52,238 --> 01:17:53,266
(Boss and employee)

2135
01:17:53,267 --> 01:17:55,276
- All of a sudden. - You have to do it sincerely.

2136
01:17:55,277 --> 01:17:56,277
What are you doing?

2137
01:17:57,408 --> 01:17:58,777
(Reading Eun Yi's mind)

2138
01:18:00,578 --> 01:18:01,747
"What are you doing?"

2139
01:18:01,748 --> 01:18:04,177
It's because the owner,

2140
01:18:04,887 --> 01:18:06,687
who has such a great presence,

2141
01:18:07,288 --> 01:18:09,258
wouldn't do this if it weren't real.

2142
01:18:09,387 --> 01:18:10,467
It's based on his presence?

2143
01:18:12,088 --> 01:18:13,588
He has that charismatic energy.

2144
01:18:13,828 --> 01:18:16,328
- Right. He has that energy. - Yes. He's big, indeed.

2145
01:18:17,458 --> 01:18:20,227
(The owner who has a big presence that cannot be fake?)

2146
01:18:20,427 --> 01:18:22,498
- I like mul naengmyeon. - Okay.

2147
01:18:22,868 --> 01:18:25,767
After slurping the noodles, I like to drink the broth.

2148
01:18:26,208 --> 01:18:27,238
(Drinking)

2149
01:18:27,508 --> 01:18:29,136
(Drinking the naengmyeon broth)

2150
01:18:29,137 --> 01:18:31,037
It's tasty when we eat...

2151
01:18:31,038 --> 01:18:32,878
- the noodles and broth together. - Yes.

2152
01:18:33,078 --> 01:18:35,047
- Does it come with the broth? - It doesn't since it's a skewer.

2153
01:18:35,048 --> 01:18:36,377
Exactly. If it's a skewer,

2154
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:37,793
- it won't come with the broth. - Will it have a bit of the broth?

2155
01:18:37,817 --> 01:18:39,417
- We have to see it to know it. - Right.

2156
01:18:39,918 --> 01:18:40,947
(Thinking)

2157
01:18:40,948 --> 01:18:42,157
(Everyone's suspicion is growing.)

2158
01:18:42,158 --> 01:18:43,216
It's strange.

2159
01:18:43,217 --> 01:18:44,287
(Staring)

2160
01:18:44,288 --> 01:18:45,356
Come to think of it,

2161
01:18:45,357 --> 01:18:47,557
Kyung Hwan didn't have any rumors about dating someone.

2162
01:18:47,927 --> 01:18:48,998
Oh, you did.

2163
01:18:50,897 --> 01:18:53,726
- Really? With who? - It was very brief.

2164
01:18:53,727 --> 01:18:55,797
(Thinking)

2165
01:18:55,798 --> 01:18:57,037
- You dated a celebrity, right? - Oh Na Mi?

2166
01:18:57,038 --> 01:18:58,838
- No. - Didn't he get married?

2167
01:19:00,168 --> 01:19:02,577
- He didn't get married. - He didn't get married?

2168
01:19:02,578 --> 01:19:03,776
- He didn't get married. - He didn't get married?

2169
01:19:03,777 --> 01:19:05,008
I thought he did.

2170
01:19:05,578 --> 01:19:07,477
(I'm single.)

2171
01:19:07,908 --> 01:19:10,146
He said that he lived alone.

2172
01:19:10,147 --> 01:19:12,016
I thought he got married in my head.

2173
01:19:12,017 --> 01:19:14,646
I thought he returned to being a single.

2174
01:19:14,647 --> 01:19:16,287
I thought he returned to being a single.

2175
01:19:16,288 --> 01:19:17,288
Watch what you say!

2176
01:19:17,289 --> 01:19:18,587
I thought that I would get in trouble for thinking about that.

2177
01:19:18,588 --> 01:19:20,226
I was thinking about inside of my head.

2178
01:19:20,227 --> 01:19:21,227
(Rumors of Heo Kyung Hwan returning to become single)

2179
01:19:21,228 --> 01:19:22,727
- Gosh. - Gosh.

2180
01:19:23,158 --> 01:19:24,158
Returning to...

2181
01:19:24,427 --> 01:19:25,466
- Actually, - Gosh.

2182
01:19:25,467 --> 01:19:28,337
Kyung Hwan is close with those who have actually become single.

2183
01:19:28,338 --> 01:19:29,667
- That was why I thought that. - Right.

2184
01:19:29,668 --> 01:19:32,136
- He does "Mom's Diary" with them. - Right.

2185
01:19:32,137 --> 01:19:34,466
You can think that way if you barely know about me.

2186
01:19:34,467 --> 01:19:36,838
There are people who think Kyung Hwan got married.

2187
01:19:37,378 --> 01:19:39,948
Everyone must be feeling full at the third place.

2188
01:19:40,908 --> 01:19:42,716
(I can't eat anymore.)

2189
01:19:42,717 --> 01:19:44,316
In this cold weather,

2190
01:19:44,317 --> 01:19:45,447
(Even the fish cake soup that can melt away the cold gets ignored.)

2191
01:19:45,448 --> 01:19:46,547
this is the perfect dish.

2192
01:19:46,548 --> 01:19:47,686
Gosh.

2193
01:19:47,687 --> 01:19:50,387
(Forcing a bite even though she is full)

2194
01:19:50,458 --> 01:19:51,458
It's good, isn't it?

2195
01:19:52,557 --> 01:19:55,828
It's being rolled! I can see it being rolled!

2196
01:19:55,897 --> 01:19:57,697
- He's rolling it. - He's rolling it.

2197
01:19:57,698 --> 01:19:59,127
- Its true. - Right.

2198
01:19:59,128 --> 01:20:00,128
The naengmyeon?

2199
01:20:00,727 --> 01:20:02,497
It's being rolled like an octopus on skewers.

2200
01:20:02,498 --> 01:20:03,997
- An octopus on skewers? - Right.

2201
01:20:03,998 --> 01:20:05,008
(The noodles are rolled?)

2202
01:20:05,168 --> 01:20:06,306
He's rolling them.

2203
01:20:06,307 --> 01:20:08,783
He must have the skills of someone who has rolled them many times.

2204
01:20:08,807 --> 01:20:10,077
His skills are amazing. I'm serious.

2205
01:20:10,078 --> 01:20:11,476
Check out his skills.

2206
01:20:11,477 --> 01:20:13,048
- He's really fast. - He's really fast.

2207
01:20:13,908 --> 01:20:18,548
(The skills of the one who made naengmyeon skewers is mesmerizing?)

2208
01:20:19,288 --> 01:20:21,048
He's really rolling the naengmyeon.

2209
01:20:22,418 --> 01:20:23,816
- I felt that right away. - It's coming.

2210
01:20:23,817 --> 01:20:25,226
- It's coming. - It's coming.

2211
01:20:25,227 --> 01:20:26,957
- Excuse me. Your dishes are here. - Gosh.

2212
01:20:26,958 --> 01:20:28,088
Gosh, look at how it looks!

2213
01:20:28,628 --> 01:20:30,057
(Amazed)

2214
01:20:31,097 --> 01:20:33,267
(Impressed)

2215
01:20:35,168 --> 01:20:36,697
- It's bibim naengmyeon. - It's bibim naengmyeon.

2216
01:20:36,698 --> 01:20:39,037
- Like this? - It's bibim naengmyeon.

2217
01:20:39,038 --> 01:20:41,398
(Korea's representative noodle skewers, naengmyeon skewers)

2218
01:20:42,637 --> 01:20:45,346
(Why were the naengmyeon skewers made?)

2219
01:20:45,347 --> 01:20:47,377
If I make it just like the others,

2220
01:20:47,378 --> 01:20:49,877
it will be less competitive.

2221
01:20:49,878 --> 01:20:51,947
I tried making different things without giving up...

2222
01:20:51,948 --> 01:20:53,386
and came up with the naengmyeon skewers.

2223
01:20:53,387 --> 01:20:56,418
The dish came to be after making many different things.

2224
01:20:57,857 --> 01:20:59,026
(How are the naengmyeon skewers made?)

2225
01:20:59,027 --> 01:21:01,526
It has been around 21 years since I've made naengmyeon.

2226
01:21:01,527 --> 01:21:03,356
I make delicious naengmyeon.

2227
01:21:03,357 --> 01:21:04,357
(The vibe of the one with 20 years of naengmyeon experience)

2228
01:21:04,358 --> 01:21:07,697
I use the broth that I have boiled for 24 hours.

2229
01:21:07,698 --> 01:21:09,437
Beef brisket and beef shank are used.

2230
01:21:09,868 --> 01:21:11,136
The broth is poured onto the noodles...

2231
01:21:11,137 --> 01:21:12,567
to cover them with the flavor.

2232
01:21:14,067 --> 01:21:16,136
The secret to the sauce is the magnolia berry.

2233
01:21:16,137 --> 01:21:18,217
The magnolia berry gives off many different flavors.

2234
01:21:19,408 --> 01:21:23,048
(When it gets mixed up with the sauce, )

2235
01:21:24,017 --> 01:21:27,048
(today's star, the skewer appears.)

2236
01:21:27,988 --> 01:21:29,886
The radish of the naengmyeon is skewered.

2237
01:21:29,887 --> 01:21:32,186
Many confuse it to be the radish served with fried chicken.

2238
01:21:32,187 --> 01:21:35,797
It's actually the radish I serve with the naengmyeon.

2239
01:21:35,798 --> 01:21:37,757
The noodles are rolled up on top of that.

2240
01:21:37,758 --> 01:21:40,698
(Rolling the bibim naengmyeon after skewering the radish)

2241
01:21:41,498 --> 01:21:43,537
It may seem easy to roll the noodles on a skewer,

2242
01:21:43,538 --> 01:21:45,936
but it's actually a very difficult process.

2243
01:21:45,937 --> 01:21:48,807
(Only the owner has the skill of rolling the noodles.)

2244
01:21:49,777 --> 01:21:52,146
Eggs usually go on top of the naengmyeon.

2245
01:21:52,147 --> 01:21:53,476
As it has to be bite-sized,

2246
01:21:53,477 --> 01:21:56,517
quail eggs are used instead of regular eggs.

2247
01:21:59,387 --> 01:22:00,987
It has the naengmyeong radish.

2248
01:22:00,988 --> 01:22:03,517
There are quail eggs instead of regular eggs.

2249
01:22:03,788 --> 01:22:06,627
It's a bowl of naengmyeon rolled into a skewer.

2250
01:22:06,628 --> 01:22:07,628
(Rolled into a skewer!)

2251
01:22:07,788 --> 01:22:11,357
(The naengmyeon skewers made with the owner's ideas are ready.)

2252
01:22:11,767 --> 01:22:14,066
The naengmyeon skewers got a great response.

2253
01:22:14,067 --> 01:22:17,237
The naengmyeon skewers became a hit as soon as they were released.

2254
01:22:17,238 --> 01:22:19,306
The young generation really enjoyed them.

2255
01:22:19,307 --> 01:22:20,566
(He came up with new noodle skewers after they became a hit.)

2256
01:22:20,567 --> 01:22:23,676
As the naengmyeon skewers became a hit,

2257
01:22:23,677 --> 01:22:26,247
I came up with various noodle skewers.

2258
01:22:26,248 --> 01:22:27,548
(Hoe naengmyeon skewers)

2259
01:22:28,777 --> 01:22:31,676
There's a reason a lot of people love our noodle skewers.

2260
01:22:31,677 --> 01:22:33,146
It's 12 dollars for 8 skewers.

2261
01:22:33,147 --> 01:22:34,788
It's 6 dollars for 4 skewers.

2262
01:22:35,387 --> 01:22:38,487
The delicious dish can be enjoyed at a reasonable price.

2263
01:22:38,488 --> 01:22:40,727
It's filling enough as a meal.

2264
01:22:41,488 --> 01:22:46,167
We get a sales of around 30,000 to 40,000 dollars a month.

2265
01:22:46,168 --> 01:22:47,804
(Around 30,000 to 40,000 dollars a month just with skewers)

2266
01:22:47,828 --> 01:22:50,867
Everyone from Sixth Sense, is this menu real?

2267
01:22:50,868 --> 01:22:52,837
(Everyone from Sixth Sense, is this menu real?)

2268
01:22:52,838 --> 01:22:54,537
(Generously served)

2269
01:22:54,538 --> 01:22:55,877
If you look at the dishes,

2270
01:22:55,878 --> 01:22:58,447
sea urchin roe can be topped instead depending on the season.

2271
01:22:58,448 --> 01:23:00,207
Do we just eat them off the skewers?

2272
01:23:00,208 --> 01:23:02,777
There's a method of eating them.

2273
01:23:03,977 --> 01:23:07,147
(A naengmyeon skewer is taken.)

2274
01:23:07,448 --> 01:23:09,017
(Looking intently)

2275
01:23:11,828 --> 01:23:14,056
Eat the quail egg first only. Just the quail egg.

2276
01:23:14,057 --> 01:23:15,557
Hold on.

2277
01:23:15,998 --> 01:23:17,797
(Opening wide)

2278
01:23:17,798 --> 01:23:18,966
(Missing it)

2279
01:23:18,967 --> 01:23:21,266
- Just the quail egg. - Just the quail egg first?

2280
01:23:21,267 --> 01:23:22,867
(The quail egg on top gets eaten first.)

2281
01:23:22,967 --> 01:23:24,167
It will be hard to get the noodles out right away.

2282
01:23:24,168 --> 01:23:26,407
They can be taken out after turning the skewers.

2283
01:23:26,408 --> 01:23:28,837
- So they can be eaten in one bite. - Okay.

2284
01:23:28,838 --> 01:23:30,337
- I see. - Okay.

2285
01:23:30,338 --> 01:23:31,408
Okay.

2286
01:23:31,977 --> 01:23:34,346
- Got it. - Is it good?

2287
01:23:34,347 --> 01:23:35,448
It's good!

2288
01:23:35,847 --> 01:23:37,748
- Is it good? - Okay.

2289
01:23:38,017 --> 01:23:40,386
- Start with the quail egg. - Start with the quail egg.

2290
01:23:40,387 --> 01:23:41,793
(How does the fun naengmyeon skewer actually taste?)

2291
01:23:41,817 --> 01:23:44,487
(The quail eggs are eaten first as they were told.)

2292
01:23:44,488 --> 01:23:45,686
It's really easy.

2293
01:23:45,687 --> 01:23:47,758
(The noodles come out as the skewers are turned.)

2294
01:23:48,698 --> 01:23:52,297
(Easily going inside his mouth)

2295
01:23:52,298 --> 01:23:53,298
Gosh.

2296
01:23:54,227 --> 01:23:55,237
It's delicious.

2297
01:23:55,238 --> 01:23:56,238
(Frown of truth)

2298
01:24:01,738 --> 01:24:03,136
- It's delicious. - It's delicious.

2299
01:24:03,137 --> 01:24:04,708
It's so delicious.

2300
01:24:07,008 --> 01:24:09,048
- It's delicious. - Right.

2301
01:24:10,418 --> 01:24:12,147
(Coming off)

2302
01:24:14,517 --> 01:24:15,657
This is driving me crazy.

2303
01:24:15,658 --> 01:24:16,987
- It's delicious. - It's delicious.

2304
01:24:16,988 --> 01:24:18,056
It's delicious.

2305
01:24:18,057 --> 01:24:19,627
- It's delicious. - It's delicious.

2306
01:24:19,628 --> 01:24:21,896
There's a reason for the owner to be confident.

2307
01:24:21,897 --> 01:24:23,057
- Right. - Right.

2308
01:24:23,597 --> 01:24:24,896
The bibim sauce is really good.

2309
01:24:24,897 --> 01:24:26,226
- Right. - Right.

2310
01:24:26,227 --> 01:24:28,266
Is it the radish inside? What is this?

2311
01:24:28,267 --> 01:24:30,766
The radish isn't salty and tastes just right.

2312
01:24:30,767 --> 01:24:33,048
It tastes like the radish that is served with naengmyeon.

2313
01:24:33,738 --> 01:24:36,077
- Naengmyeon is served with eggs. - Right.

2314
01:24:36,078 --> 01:24:37,738
That was expressed with the quail egg.

2315
01:24:38,378 --> 01:24:40,747
It wasn't too spicy as well.

2316
01:24:40,748 --> 01:24:43,017
I wasn't really sure after looking at how it looked.

2317
01:24:43,378 --> 01:24:44,378
It was delicious though.

2318
01:24:44,977 --> 01:24:46,377
You can make a toast with them too.

2319
01:24:46,548 --> 01:24:48,717
- Cheers! - Cheers!

2320
01:24:50,658 --> 01:24:52,058
It tastes just like hoe naengmyeon.

2321
01:24:52,857 --> 01:24:53,926
It's good.

2322
01:24:53,927 --> 01:24:55,727
(This place is good.)

2323
01:24:55,897 --> 01:24:59,327
(Everyone is amazed by the naengmyeon skewers.)

2324
01:24:59,328 --> 01:25:01,397
- It's so good. - I wish we could have some broth.

2325
01:25:01,937 --> 01:25:04,966
Do you have any broth, sir?

2326
01:25:04,967 --> 01:25:06,067
- Broth? - Yes.

2327
01:25:07,238 --> 01:25:08,976
He's bringing out the broth.

2328
01:25:08,977 --> 01:25:10,237
- It's the broth. - It's the broth.

2329
01:25:10,238 --> 01:25:11,408
- Gosh. - I see.

2330
01:25:11,677 --> 01:25:12,677
Really?

2331
01:25:12,677 --> 01:25:13,677
(The broth that Kyung Hwan asked for gets served right away.)

2332
01:25:13,678 --> 01:25:15,208
- What is this? - It's the broth.

2333
01:25:15,578 --> 01:25:16,578
What is this?

2334
01:25:17,147 --> 01:25:19,016
It's minus 15°C outside, and there's so much ice.

2335
01:25:19,017 --> 01:25:20,846
You were talking about the warm broth, right?

2336
01:25:20,847 --> 01:25:23,017
No. It didn't matter what kind of broth it was.

2337
01:25:23,317 --> 01:25:25,386
I think I'm right. You wanted something warm.

2338
01:25:25,387 --> 01:25:27,127
- I think you wanted something warm. - Gosh.

2339
01:25:27,128 --> 01:25:28,627
Did you ask for cold broth?

2340
01:25:28,628 --> 01:25:30,158
(What do I do?)

2341
01:25:30,557 --> 01:25:32,566
(Ice-cold broth gets served during the cold wave.)

2342
01:25:32,567 --> 01:25:34,596
(Is this place real?)

2343
01:25:34,597 --> 01:25:37,038
I'm sorry, but please have some as I asked for some.

2344
01:25:38,567 --> 01:25:41,508
You can hear the sound of the ice.

2345
01:25:41,977 --> 01:25:43,837
- What's that? - Here are the jjajamyeon skewers.

2346
01:25:43,838 --> 01:25:44,838
- What? - What?

2347
01:25:46,048 --> 01:25:49,777
(Here are the jjajangmyeon skewers.)

2348
01:25:52,288 --> 01:25:53,717
(Amazed)

2349
01:25:53,918 --> 01:25:55,488
- Jjajangmyeon skewers? - Yes.

2350
01:25:56,118 --> 01:25:57,617
(Naengmyeon skewers weren't everything?)

2351
01:25:57,618 --> 01:25:59,138
It's made with jjajangmyeon this time.

2352
01:26:00,887 --> 01:26:03,998
(Second signature noodle skewers, jjajangmyeon skewers)

2353
01:26:04,427 --> 01:26:07,567
(The world's first noodle skewer creator's...)

2354
01:26:07,828 --> 01:26:10,368
(next work of ambition)

2355
01:26:11,198 --> 01:26:12,636
As the naengmyeon skewers became a hit,

2356
01:26:12,637 --> 01:26:14,766
I wanted to make a challenge with a new dish.

2357
01:26:14,767 --> 01:26:16,007
(A generous amount of onions...)

2358
01:26:16,008 --> 01:26:18,408
(and meat)

2359
01:26:18,948 --> 01:26:21,977
(A special dish created by the master of noodle skewers)

2360
01:26:22,948 --> 01:26:25,647
(Jjajangmyeon)

2361
01:26:25,887 --> 01:26:29,757
I have been studying Chinese cuisine on my own for seven years.

2362
01:26:29,758 --> 01:26:33,157
I thought about using the skewers with jjajangmyeon...

2363
01:26:33,158 --> 01:26:34,758
and that was how that dish came to life.

2364
01:26:35,557 --> 01:26:38,896
(This time, it's the yellow pickled radish!)

2365
01:26:38,897 --> 01:26:41,227
As it's jjajangmyeon, the pickled radish is skewered.

2366
01:26:41,927 --> 01:26:43,837
The jjajangmyeon is rolled on top of that.

2367
01:26:43,838 --> 01:26:45,607
(The world of noodle skewers is endless.)

2368
01:26:46,338 --> 01:26:48,737
(The quail egg is also served.)

2369
01:26:48,738 --> 01:26:51,776
I wanted to serve a bowl of jjajangmyeon with skewers.

2370
01:26:51,777 --> 01:26:53,176
This one is a popular dish.

2371
01:26:53,177 --> 01:26:54,177
(A simple bowl of jjajangmyeon, jjajangmyeon skewers)

2372
01:26:54,178 --> 01:26:56,578
It's jjajangmyeon this time after naengmyeon.

2373
01:26:59,387 --> 01:27:02,317
(Startled)

2374
01:27:03,958 --> 01:27:04,958
(Satisfied)

2375
01:27:06,458 --> 01:27:08,457
(Touched once again)

2376
01:27:08,458 --> 01:27:10,056
(Even the jjajangmyeon...)

2377
01:27:10,057 --> 01:27:11,857
(is eaten easily with the skewers.)

2378
01:27:12,328 --> 01:27:14,298
- Kids would love this. - Right.

2379
01:27:15,597 --> 01:27:16,936
(A revolution of noodle skewers after the naengmyeon skewers)

2380
01:27:16,937 --> 01:27:17,937
It's delicious.

2381
01:27:17,938 --> 01:27:19,613
(A revolution of noodle skewers after the naengmyeon skewers)

2382
01:27:19,637 --> 01:27:22,507
It's served with pickled radish this time.

2383
01:27:22,508 --> 01:27:25,507
Quail eggs are actually served with jjajangmyeon.

2384
01:27:25,508 --> 01:27:26,877
- Kids would love this. - Right.

2385
01:27:26,878 --> 01:27:28,147
It's delicious.

2386
01:27:28,748 --> 01:27:30,748
Did we really say we were full?

2387
01:27:31,317 --> 01:27:33,147
We emptied four plates.

2388
01:27:33,618 --> 01:27:35,247
(There are only empty plates left on the table.)

2389
01:27:35,248 --> 01:27:36,556
That was so quick.

2390
01:27:36,557 --> 01:27:38,488
We're going to go broke at this rate.

2391
01:27:40,187 --> 01:27:41,957
- Seriously. - How much food are we eating?

2392
01:27:41,958 --> 01:27:43,627
We're not eating because we're hungry.

2393
01:27:43,628 --> 01:27:45,057
We're not hungry right now.

2394
01:27:45,427 --> 01:27:46,798
But it's so delicious.

2395
01:27:47,628 --> 01:27:49,548
Check out the number of skewers we had just now.

2396
01:27:49,597 --> 01:27:52,368
(Just the remains of the used skewers can be seen.)

2397
01:27:52,607 --> 01:27:54,306
(They could've been in trouble if the dishes weren't cheap.)

2398
01:27:54,307 --> 01:27:57,907
You asked earlier if there was a reason to eat them this way.

2399
01:27:57,908 --> 01:27:59,346
- But eating them like this... - It's good.

2400
01:27:59,347 --> 01:28:00,447
Makes it really nice and neat.

2401
01:28:00,448 --> 01:28:02,729
- None of them get on your lips. - It's really thrilling.

2402
01:28:03,017 --> 01:28:05,217
From a business perspective,

2403
01:28:05,687 --> 01:28:06,687
it's perfect for high turnovers.

2404
01:28:06,688 --> 01:28:08,717
- There aren't many things to wash. - Right.

2405
01:28:09,057 --> 01:28:11,316
- Right. - There are no side dishes too.

2406
01:28:11,317 --> 01:28:12,686
The side dishes are served inside the skewer.

2407
01:28:12,687 --> 01:28:14,628
- Right. - So in other words,

2408
01:28:15,057 --> 01:28:16,856
- they're made out of experience. - Right.

2409
01:28:16,857 --> 01:28:19,328
These dishes are a result of his experience.

2410
01:28:19,767 --> 01:28:21,797
(The original naengmyeon has a lot of things to clean up with.)

2411
01:28:21,798 --> 01:28:24,137
(The skewers just need to separated into the trash.)

2412
01:28:24,437 --> 01:28:28,437
(Dishes made by the experienced one to make business easier?)

2413
01:28:28,668 --> 01:28:30,577
Things became clear after coming to this place.

2414
01:28:30,578 --> 01:28:32,178
- This place isn't fake, right? - Right.

2415
01:28:32,307 --> 01:28:34,077
I think the first place is fake.

2416
01:28:34,078 --> 01:28:35,958
I see. What made you become certain about that?

2417
01:28:36,748 --> 01:28:40,917
The kimchi bomb chicken should've been promoted more outside,

2418
01:28:40,918 --> 01:28:43,118
- but it wasn't seen outside. - It wasn't seen outside.

2419
01:28:43,418 --> 01:28:46,258
(The kimchi bomb chicken was a popular dish, )

2420
01:28:46,458 --> 01:28:50,426
(but it wasn't seen at all outside the restaurant.)

2421
01:28:50,427 --> 01:28:52,674
- What do you think, Hye Lyun? - It's the second place for me.

2422
01:28:52,698 --> 01:28:54,258
- The second place? - The second place?

2423
01:28:54,498 --> 01:28:58,436
(Hye Lyun thinks the 75cm parfait place is fake?)

2424
01:28:58,437 --> 01:29:01,867
First of all, there are too many fruits.

2425
01:29:01,868 --> 01:29:03,436
(There are too many fruits.)

2426
01:29:03,437 --> 01:29:05,106
It's a good thing to have a lot of fruits.

2427
01:29:05,107 --> 01:29:06,948
It was enough to serve our family for a week.

2428
01:29:07,277 --> 01:29:09,316
(There were just too many.)

2429
01:29:09,317 --> 01:29:11,646
- There were too many strawberries. - If that's the case...

2430
01:29:11,647 --> 01:29:13,816
What kind of place serves that much fruit?

2431
01:29:13,817 --> 01:29:16,617
The Shine Muscat and strawberries could've been mixed.

2432
01:29:16,618 --> 01:29:19,087
There could've been a dish with them mixed together.

2433
01:29:19,088 --> 01:29:21,827
It was just so simple.

2434
01:29:21,828 --> 01:29:23,497
Shine!

2435
01:29:23,498 --> 01:29:24,697
Strawberry!

2436
01:29:24,698 --> 01:29:26,867
It's way up there!

2437
01:29:26,868 --> 01:29:29,497
"When will we finish this parfait?"

2438
01:29:29,498 --> 01:29:32,466
They have to be pulled out and scattered at the bottom.

2439
01:29:32,467 --> 01:29:33,467
I don't think that's right.

2440
01:29:33,468 --> 01:29:35,037
There's no reasoning to what you're saying,

2441
01:29:35,038 --> 01:29:36,814
but you're using your voice and energy to explain yourself.

2442
01:29:36,838 --> 01:29:38,537
- That's how you persuade people. - She uses her energy.

2443
01:29:38,538 --> 01:29:40,377
- Right. She uses her energy. - She uses her energy.

2444
01:29:40,378 --> 01:29:41,846
That's how she tries to persuade us.

2445
01:29:41,847 --> 01:29:44,277
But the second place really felt off.

2446
01:29:45,847 --> 01:29:47,487
(Hye Lyun thinks the 75cm parfait is fake because of all the fruit?)

2447
01:29:47,488 --> 01:29:48,568
What about you, Kyung Hwan?

2448
01:29:49,057 --> 01:29:51,287
To be honest, I think it's this place.

2449
01:29:51,288 --> 01:29:53,157
- Why? - We all have different opinions.

2450
01:29:53,158 --> 01:29:54,686
- What's going on? - All of a sudden?

2451
01:29:54,687 --> 01:29:56,807
- You ate everything though. - Why do you think that?

2452
01:29:57,158 --> 01:30:00,967
- No matter how good this is... - The owner is listening.

2453
01:30:01,698 --> 01:30:03,237
Make him look away.

2454
01:30:03,238 --> 01:30:05,338
(Make the owner look away.)

2455
01:30:07,607 --> 01:30:09,207
No matter how good this is,

2456
01:30:09,208 --> 01:30:12,007
there's a certain feel of naengmyeon with the broth.

2457
01:30:12,008 --> 01:30:13,306
You need to feel the broth.

2458
01:30:13,307 --> 01:30:16,048
There wasn't a broth that was served with it.

2459
01:30:16,177 --> 01:30:17,716
The last skewer eaten...

2460
01:30:17,717 --> 01:30:19,618
will lack moistness.

2461
01:30:20,317 --> 01:30:23,118
It's not a dish that is served with a broth or a sauce.

2462
01:30:23,357 --> 01:30:26,587
If it lacks the moistness...

2463
01:30:26,588 --> 01:30:27,988
Moistness?

2464
01:30:28,458 --> 01:30:30,657
Isn't that word used for skin products?

2465
01:30:30,658 --> 01:30:32,596
- The moistness of the noodles. - Right.

2466
01:30:32,597 --> 01:30:34,697
- The texture of the noodles. - Right.

2467
01:30:34,698 --> 01:30:36,237
With each skewer served,

2468
01:30:36,238 --> 01:30:38,667
it was hard to eat the quail eggs first.

2469
01:30:38,668 --> 01:30:39,966
- I see. - The quail eggs.

2470
01:30:39,967 --> 01:30:41,337
- It was... - It was your second time though.

2471
01:30:41,338 --> 01:30:42,408
Right.

2472
01:30:44,708 --> 01:30:47,777
You're supporting what your CEO said.

2473
01:30:47,977 --> 01:30:49,976
- She's supporting her CEO - There's one left here.

2474
01:30:49,977 --> 01:30:50,977
Thank you.

2475
01:30:51,317 --> 01:30:53,087
(Eun Yi and Kyung Hwan think it's a fake dish...)

2476
01:30:53,088 --> 01:30:54,816
(as the production crew missed its moistness?)

2477
01:30:54,817 --> 01:30:55,917
- Right now... - Mr. Yu.

2478
01:30:55,918 --> 01:30:57,457
There are 2 votes for the 1st place.

2479
01:30:57,458 --> 01:30:58,487
There are 2 votes for the 3rd place.

2480
01:30:58,488 --> 01:30:59,526
There are 2 votes for the 3rd place.

2481
01:30:59,527 --> 01:31:01,186
With the 1st and 3rd place,

2482
01:31:01,187 --> 01:31:02,596
- we will try to find the answer. - The second place is out?

2483
01:31:02,597 --> 01:31:04,027
- Yes. - Yes. It's out.

2484
01:31:04,628 --> 01:31:06,526
- The second place is out? - I'm sorry.

2485
01:31:06,527 --> 01:31:07,997
- What do I do then? - We'll just understand...

2486
01:31:07,998 --> 01:31:09,437
that we think differently.

2487
01:31:10,097 --> 01:31:12,407
This will make it really hard to decide.

2488
01:31:12,408 --> 01:31:14,208
I have no idea which one is fake.

2489
01:31:14,708 --> 01:31:16,937
- Goodbye. - Thank you.

2490
01:31:17,378 --> 01:31:19,106
- It was delicious though. - Right.

2491
01:31:19,107 --> 01:31:20,508
It was really good.

2492
01:31:21,277 --> 01:31:23,476
- "I was doing that." - "I was doing that."

2493
01:31:23,477 --> 01:31:25,317
A lot of my catchphrases are being used today.

2494
01:31:26,317 --> 01:31:27,686
A year's worth was used today.

2495
01:31:27,687 --> 01:31:28,716
(Feeling proud)

2496
01:31:28,717 --> 01:31:30,917
I love his catchphrases.

2497
01:31:30,918 --> 01:31:33,356
When I'm the host of a show...

2498
01:31:33,357 --> 01:31:36,127
and he joins as a guest, I let him use them.

2499
01:31:36,128 --> 01:31:39,998
All openings are the same when I'm in a show with him.

2500
01:31:40,227 --> 01:31:43,136
"I was going to do that."

2501
01:31:43,137 --> 01:31:45,537
"Isn't this what catchphrases are about?"

2502
01:31:45,538 --> 01:31:47,338
The opening is over after doing that.

2503
01:31:47,738 --> 01:31:48,807
It ends just with that.

2504
01:31:49,208 --> 01:31:51,378
(They are so funny.)

2505
01:31:52,277 --> 01:31:53,907
It's time to make the final decision.

2506
01:31:53,908 --> 01:31:55,377
(It's finally time to make a decision.)

2507
01:31:55,378 --> 01:31:57,846
It's hard though. It's really hard.

2508
01:31:57,847 --> 01:32:00,386
I was expecting to get it right, but we might get it wrong.

2509
01:32:00,387 --> 01:32:04,016
(Will the members be able to find the fake place?)

2510
01:32:04,017 --> 01:32:05,333
So which place do you think is fake?

2511
01:32:05,357 --> 01:32:06,488
But...

2512
01:32:06,958 --> 01:32:08,886
we should get it right as it's the second episode.

2513
01:32:08,887 --> 01:32:11,198
- Right. - We got it wrong in the first one.

2514
01:32:11,798 --> 01:32:13,026
- We got it wrong in the first one. - Right.

2515
01:32:13,027 --> 01:32:15,198
- There's something on your shirt. - Right.

2516
01:32:15,467 --> 01:32:17,237
(He got the sauce on his shirt while eating the skewer.)

2517
01:32:17,238 --> 01:32:19,907
But how did it end up here and not here?

2518
01:32:19,908 --> 01:32:20,936
Did you eat it like this?

2519
01:32:20,937 --> 01:32:22,606
(Did you eat it like this?)

2520
01:32:22,607 --> 01:32:24,437
Gosh, what are you doing?

2521
01:32:24,807 --> 01:32:27,407
- How did it end up here? - Gosh, CEO Song.

2522
01:32:27,408 --> 01:32:28,484
(Tom and Jerry are doing great together even today.)

2523
01:32:28,508 --> 01:32:30,547
- You will decide now. - Right.

2524
01:32:30,548 --> 01:32:31,976
I will explain this to the guests.

2525
01:32:31,977 --> 01:32:34,316
A coffee truck will be sent if you get the answer right.

2526
01:32:34,317 --> 01:32:35,386
(Coffee truck)

2527
01:32:35,387 --> 01:32:37,886
If you get it wrong, a random person will get picked...

2528
01:32:37,887 --> 01:32:41,087
and a cringy post will be posted on their social media page...

2529
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:42,503
and there will be no explanations about it for 24 hours.

2530
01:32:42,527 --> 01:32:44,797
It's the same penalty as last week.

2531
01:32:44,798 --> 01:32:45,827
That's amazing.

2532
01:32:45,828 --> 01:32:47,266
(The sentimental post that didn't feel like Mimi)

2533
01:32:47,267 --> 01:32:48,726
(The romance of life is more important than working out.)

2534
01:32:48,727 --> 01:32:50,466
(I will become a romantic person until I am filled with romance.)

2535
01:32:50,467 --> 01:32:51,596
(- No Instagram after drinking. - She's going to regret this.)

2536
01:32:51,597 --> 01:32:53,337
Gosh, I felt so embarrassed.

2537
01:32:53,338 --> 01:32:54,936
It was humiliating.

2538
01:32:54,937 --> 01:32:56,337
(No explanations for 24 hours)

2539
01:32:56,338 --> 01:32:57,737
(- I enjoyed your cheesy post. - What's with the sentimental post?)

2540
01:32:57,738 --> 01:32:59,507
With the result of our votes,

2541
01:32:59,508 --> 01:33:02,977
we should decide between the 1st place and 3rd place.

2542
01:33:04,717 --> 01:33:05,948
(It's so good!)

2543

(and kimchi dropped down like a bomb)

2546
01:33:13,828 --> 01:33:15,663

Let's be clear.

2560
01:33:51,027 --> 01:33:53,167
- Let's raise our hands. - Right.

2561
01:33:53,168 --> 01:33:54,426
People might have changed their opinions.

2562
01:33:54,427 --> 01:33:55,726
All right. The first place.

2563
01:33:55,727 --> 01:33:57,037
One, two, three.

2564
01:33:57,038 --> 01:33:58,698

2568

(The 1st place gets a total of 5 votes.)

2570
01:34:08,378 --> 01:34:10,676
She didn't raise her hand with everyone else.

2571
01:34:10,677 --> 01:34:12,788
- She was late. - Did you read the room first?

2572
01:34:12,918 --> 01:34:15,248
- Did you read the room? - I wanted to go with the flow.

2573
01:34:16,988 --> 01:34:18,588
I thought she was a Domino piece.

2574
01:34:19,727 --> 01:34:22,698
You can't be like that. Gosh.

2575
01:34:23,227 --> 01:34:25,657
All right then. We'll go with the first place.

2576
01:34:25,658 --> 01:34:26,926
- Let's go with the first place. - Right.

2577
01:34:26,927 --> 01:34:28,426
- Oh, no! - I want to get it right this time.

2578
01:34:28,427 --> 01:34:29,698

01:35:17,548 --> 01:35:20,117
(The noodles are rolled onto skewers.)

2596
01:35:20,118 --> 01:35:21,917
(Naengmyeon skewers from Hwaseong)

2597
01:35:21,918 --> 01:35:23,017
Is it the third place?

2598
01:35:24,357 --> 01:35:25,357
(Do they all seem fake?)

2599
01:35:25,358 --> 01:35:26,627
I have no idea.

2600
01:35:26,628 --> 01:35:27,687
Isn't it the second place?

2601
01:35:28,158 --> 01:35:30,827
- Gosh! - That would be crazy!

2602
01:35:30,828 --> 01:35:33,096
- Please! - Please!

2603
01:35:33,097 --> 01:35:35,066
- Please! - Let's get it right this time.

2604
01:35:35,067 --> 01:35:36,096
We have to get it right for our second episode.

2605
01:35:36,097 --> 01:35:37,337
All right. Which place is fake?

2606
01:35:38,097 --> 01:35:41,868
(The dishes mesmerized everyone with their tastes and looks.)

2607
01:35:43,908 --> 01:35:45,537
- The 1st place! - The 1st place!

2608
01:35:45,538 --> 01:35:48,107
(Which place is fake and is not a hot place dish in Suwon?)

2609
01:35:49,647 --> 01:35:52,078
(It will be revealed now.)

2610
01:35:52,378 --> 01:35:53,418
What is it?

2611
01:35:53,647 --> 01:35:56,887
(Kimchi bomb chicken, fake)

2612
01:35:57,317 --> 01:36:00,327
(It's the 1st place!)

2613
01:36:00,328 --> 01:36:01,328
(The members win.)

2614
01:36:01,329 --> 01:36:03,096
- We did it! - Gosh!

2615
01:36:03,097 --> 01:36:04,356
Gosh.

2616
01:36:04,357 --> 01:36:05,896
- We did it! - Gosh!

2617
01:36:05,897 --> 01:36:07,567
- We did it! - We did it!

2618
01:36:07,628 --> 01:36:09,267
This is thrilling.

2619
01:36:09,397 --> 01:36:11,297
It's really thrilling today.

2620
01:36:11,298 --> 01:36:12,937
It was really hard.

2621
01:36:13,637 --> 01:36:16,208
(Last week)

2622
01:36:16,408 --> 01:36:17,878
(The place was actually run?)

2623
01:36:18,177 --> 01:36:19,677
(For Sixth Sense: City Tour, )

2624
01:36:19,948 --> 01:36:23,147
(the fake dishes were sold for two months.)

2625
01:36:23,317 --> 01:36:24,548
(I saw this!)

2626
01:36:24,847 --> 01:36:28,248
(The fake dishes took over social media as well.)

2627
01:36:28,548 --> 01:36:30,287
(You went this far?)

2628
01:36:30,288 --> 01:36:34,328
(Sixth Sense that has changed not only fools the members.)

2629
01:36:34,527 --> 01:36:37,458
(The viewers are fooled as well.)

2630
01:36:37,958 --> 01:36:40,967
(Daily lives are taken over too.)

2631
01:36:41,298 --> 01:36:42,327
(This place was actually run again.)

2632
01:36:42,328 --> 01:36:44,396
- Really? - Gosh.

2633
01:36:44,397 --> 01:36:46,507
(Viewers that are watching right now, )

2634
01:36:46,508 --> 01:36:49,167
(did you see the kimchi bomb chicken on social media?)

2635
01:36:49,168 --> 01:36:50,806
(Why does the owner here...)

2636
01:36:50,807 --> 01:36:52,106
(keep playing with the fried chicken?)

2637
01:36:52,107 --> 01:36:55,078
(Did you want to try this after this went viral?)

2638
01:36:56,777 --> 01:36:57,878
- What? - What?

2639
01:36:58,448 --> 01:36:59,448
(The dishes were registered once again this time.)

2640
01:36:59,449 --> 01:37:00,817
- No way. - Gosh.

2641
01:37:01,288 --> 01:37:02,346
(It was prepared for two months.)

2642
01:37:02,347 --> 01:37:04,258
- Seriously? - Gosh.

2643
01:37:04,418 --> 01:37:07,128
- It was actually sold. - It was actually sold?

2644
01:37:07,288 --> 01:37:08,856
- All of that is fake? - It was all fake?

2645
01:37:08,857 --> 01:37:10,096
- Right. - What is all this?

2646
01:37:10,097 --> 01:37:11,596
Is the restaurant real?

2647
01:37:11,597 --> 01:37:12,668
(Is the restaurant real?)

2648
01:37:15,267 --> 01:37:18,766
We have been running the fried chicken place for 13 years.

2649
01:37:18,767 --> 01:37:20,407
- Gosh. - Really?

2650
01:37:20,408 --> 01:37:21,606
(Why was this place chosen?)

2651
01:37:21,607 --> 01:37:22,838
- Why? - Why?

2652
01:37:23,908 --> 01:37:25,606
(There was nothing that tasted like this before.)

2653
01:37:25,607 --> 01:37:27,508
(Is this galbi or fried chicken?)

2654
01:37:28,508 --> 01:37:30,216
Gosh, look at all the people.

2655
01:37:30,217 --> 01:37:32,477
This happened after the movie was released.

2656
01:37:33,548 --> 01:37:34,747
(However...)

2657
01:37:34,748 --> 01:37:36,258
- Gosh. - What?

2658
01:37:37,187 --> 01:37:38,457
(Consumption has lowered due to the extension of economic recession)

2659
01:37:38,458 --> 01:37:40,027
- Right. - I see.

2660
01:37:40,958 --> 01:37:44,227
The place is really empty these days.

2661
01:37:44,328 --> 01:37:46,926
It was the worst ever since I've started running the place.

2662
01:37:46,927 --> 01:37:48,644
(Park Jung Sook, fried chicken place owner for 13 years)

2663
01:37:48,668 --> 01:37:51,168
- Gosh, things are tough these days. - Right.

2664
01:37:53,567 --> 01:37:55,367
It has been prepared for a long time.

2665
01:37:55,368 --> 01:37:56,606
(The relief pitcher of the fried chicken place)

2666
01:37:56,607 --> 01:37:58,276
(The hidden card of the production crew)

2667
01:37:58,277 --> 01:37:59,347
Hello.

2668
01:38:00,807 --> 01:38:01,908
- What? - What?

2669
01:38:02,307 --> 01:38:03,677
She was on "Culinary Class Wars."

2670
01:38:03,777 --> 01:38:06,317
- She used Tongyeong vegetables. - Right.

2671
01:38:06,517 --> 01:38:07,716
I see!

2672
01:38:07,717 --> 01:38:10,418
I'm Jo Seo Hyung, a chef that cooks in Eulji-ro.

2673
01:38:10,557 --> 01:38:12,117
- The Genius Restaurateur. - Right.

2674
01:38:12,118 --> 01:38:15,657
I make Korean dishes based on seasonal ingredients.

2675
01:38:15,658 --> 01:38:16,658
- Gosh. - Gosh.

2676
01:38:16,659 --> 01:38:19,426
I try my best to serve all four seasons in my food.

2677
01:38:19,427 --> 01:38:21,096
That was why it was made into a Korean dish.

2678
01:38:21,097 --> 01:38:22,798
Right.

2679
01:38:22,897 --> 01:38:24,566
This place in Eulji-ro is really good.

2680
01:38:24,567 --> 01:38:26,407
(She's running a hot place in Eulji-ro.)

2681
01:38:26,408 --> 01:38:29,908
(Sixth Sense: City Tour and Jo Seo Hyung)

2682
01:38:30,078 --> 01:38:31,276
(Jo Seo Hyung has appeared...)

2683
01:38:31,277 --> 01:38:32,436
(to rescue the fried chicken place in crisis!)

2684
01:38:32,437 --> 01:38:34,907
I think I should try each dish first.

2685
01:38:34,908 --> 01:38:38,078
- Right. - She tried each dish?

2686
01:38:39,217 --> 01:38:40,618
(Satisfied)

2687
01:38:40,788 --> 01:38:43,657
When pictures are taken and uploaded on social media,

2688
01:38:43,658 --> 01:38:46,657
it should be a dish that gets a lot of attention.

2689
01:38:46,658 --> 01:38:47,686
(A dish that gets a lot of attention on social media is required.)

2690
01:38:47,687 --> 01:38:48,726
Right.

2691
01:38:48,727 --> 01:38:49,887
She realized that right away.

2692
01:38:50,557 --> 01:38:52,356
I thought hard about what could be done...

2693
01:38:52,357 --> 01:38:54,168
to make fried chicken different.

2694
01:38:55,128 --> 01:38:56,868
I made a combination pizza...

2695
01:38:57,137 --> 01:38:58,636
and placed the fried chicken on top.

2696
01:38:58,637 --> 01:39:00,107
She tried that as well.

2697
01:39:00,708 --> 01:39:03,007
I fried Camembert cheese and placed it on top.

2698
01:39:03,008 --> 01:39:04,378
So fried that?

2699
01:39:04,738 --> 01:39:06,447
(The result of trying many different dishes)

2700
01:39:06,448 --> 01:39:07,606
(Thinking)

2701
01:39:07,607 --> 01:39:09,346
I thought people would find it to be too hard to approach...

2702
01:39:09,347 --> 01:39:11,078
if it was a dish that was too special.

2703
01:39:11,477 --> 01:39:14,387
That was why I thought about things that work well with fried chicken.

2704
01:39:14,847 --> 01:39:18,056
I am a person that believes that kimchi runs through my veins.

2705
01:39:18,057 --> 01:39:19,357
Kimchi runs through her veins?

2706
01:39:19,758 --> 01:39:23,027
I think it would be nice to try fried chicken dishes with kimchi.

2707
01:39:23,128 --> 01:39:25,397
No wonder it was good.

2708
01:39:25,897 --> 01:39:28,998
I grilled the cheese to be crispy and added that to the dish.

2709
01:39:29,298 --> 01:39:30,498
Mozzarella cheese!

2710
01:39:31,767 --> 01:39:33,436
(Kimchi bomb chicken full of kimchi and chicken)

2711
01:39:33,437 --> 01:39:35,306
- It was great though. - It was a great idea.

2712
01:39:35,307 --> 01:39:37,636
- It was really good. - It was really good.

2713
01:39:37,637 --> 01:39:38,677
It was really good.

2714
01:39:39,107 --> 01:39:41,708
The cheese becomes crispy like crispy burnt rice.

2715
01:39:42,107 --> 01:39:44,316
That is how it gets more of a smoky flavor.

2716
01:39:44,317 --> 01:39:46,277
(She's working hard to take notes of the recipe.)

2717
01:39:46,717 --> 01:39:48,247
(She practiced at night after closing the restaurant.)

2718
01:39:48,248 --> 01:39:49,288
That's amazing.

2719
01:39:49,687 --> 01:39:52,217
(D-30, preparing to fool the Sixth Sense members)

2720
01:39:52,658 --> 01:39:54,887
(The menu gets replaced.)

2721
01:39:55,128 --> 01:39:56,896
(Kimchi bomb chicken)

2722
01:39:56,897 --> 01:39:58,674
- That dish was added. - That dish was added.

2723
01:39:58,698 --> 01:40:00,197
That was done to make it look old.

2724
01:40:00,198 --> 01:40:01,403
(Details of making it look old)

2725
01:40:01,427 --> 01:40:02,596
(And this post!)

2726
01:40:02,597 --> 01:40:03,668
What was that?

2727
01:40:04,038 --> 01:40:05,697
- Hello. - That was fake too?

2728
01:40:05,698 --> 01:40:08,436
I'm Park Jung Sook of the fried chicken place in Suwon.

2729
01:40:08,437 --> 01:40:09,507
That's amazing.

2730
01:40:09,508 --> 01:40:11,337
(Taking pictures as if it's for a morning show)

2731
01:40:11,338 --> 01:40:12,537
That's amazing.

2732
01:40:12,538 --> 01:40:13,747
They were taken as if it was for a morning show.

2733
01:40:13,748 --> 01:40:15,253
(They were taken as if it was for a morning show.)

2734
01:40:15,277 --> 01:40:16,976
- I see. - My goodness.

2735
01:40:16,977 --> 01:40:18,878
That's just amazing.

2736
01:40:18,977 --> 01:40:20,748
(This isn't it.)

2737
01:40:21,548 --> 01:40:23,757
(Around 3 weeks ago at a rest stop)

2738
01:40:23,758 --> 01:40:24,817
What's going on?

2739
01:40:24,958 --> 01:40:26,033
- What's going on? - What's going on?

2740
01:40:26,057 --> 01:40:27,128
What's this about?

2741
01:40:29,328 --> 01:40:30,498
- Hey. - Yes?

2742
01:40:31,057 --> 01:40:33,766
We arrived at the rest stop. Will you stop by the restroom?

2743
01:40:33,767 --> 01:40:34,873
Yes. I want to use the restroom.

2744
01:40:34,897 --> 01:40:35,897
- That's Mimi's voice. - What?

2745
01:40:35,897 --> 01:40:36,897
What's going on?

2746
01:40:37,137 --> 01:40:38,167
- That's Mimi's voice. - What?

2747
01:40:38,168 --> 01:40:39,197
- What? - It's Mimi!

2748
01:40:39,198 --> 01:40:40,208
(Mimi's voice)

2749
01:40:41,607 --> 01:40:42,767
It was after an event!

2750
01:40:43,238 --> 01:40:44,238
- What happened? - What happened?

2751
01:40:44,239 --> 01:40:45,277
What happened?

2752
01:40:45,378 --> 01:40:46,408
What happened?

2753
01:40:47,948 --> 01:40:50,147
- I'll be back. - See you.

2754
01:40:50,918 --> 01:40:51,918
Gosh.

2755
01:40:52,777 --> 01:40:53,788
What's going on?

2756
01:40:54,647 --> 01:40:55,647
What is this about?

2757
01:40:57,357 --> 01:40:58,958
Hello, Mimi's manager.

2758
01:40:59,317 --> 01:41:01,856
Could you call out...

2759
01:41:01,857 --> 01:41:04,798
"Suwon hot place, kimchi bomb chicken" to her phone?

2760
01:41:05,328 --> 01:41:06,827
It is known that phones listen to our voices...

2761
01:41:06,828 --> 01:41:08,298
to connect us to certain algorithms.

2762
01:41:08,727 --> 01:41:10,197
- For the algorithm? - To set up a new algorithm?

2763
01:41:10,198 --> 01:41:11,237
(Even her algorithm was worked on?)

2764
01:41:11,238 --> 01:41:12,238
Are you serious?

2765
01:41:13,567 --> 01:41:15,507
(Are you listening, Mimi's phone?)

2766
01:41:15,508 --> 01:41:17,337
(Suwon hot place, kimchi bomb chicken)

2767
01:41:17,338 --> 01:41:19,137
(Suwon hot place, kimchi bomb chicken)

2768
01:41:19,378 --> 01:41:21,447
(Stylist, could you say it too?)

2769
01:41:21,448 --> 01:41:23,816
(The Sixth Sense producer asked me to do this.)

2770
01:41:23,817 --> 01:41:24,846
What?

2771
01:41:24,847 --> 01:41:26,117
(Kimchi bomb chicken)

2772
01:41:26,118 --> 01:41:27,787
(Dropping voice bombs while Mimi has left her phone)

2773
01:41:27,788 --> 01:41:29,047
(Kimchi bomb chicken)

2774
01:41:29,048 --> 01:41:30,886
- My gosh. - Your phone listens to you.

2775
01:41:30,887 --> 01:41:33,186
That was done to plant in voice data?

2776
01:41:33,187 --> 01:41:34,187
(They went that far?)

2777
01:41:34,557 --> 01:41:36,426
- That's amazing. - Gosh.

2778
01:41:36,427 --> 01:41:38,657
Mimi didn't find it. It didn't appear on her feed.

2779
01:41:38,658 --> 01:41:40,844
- It didn't appear, right? - It didn't appear because...

2780
01:41:40,868 --> 01:41:43,168
I make a massive amount of searches for desserts.

2781
01:41:43,698 --> 01:41:44,698
She won against them.

2782
01:41:45,668 --> 01:41:47,307
"Kimchi bomb chicken."

2783
01:41:47,567 --> 01:41:50,277
Please protect my daily life!

2784
01:41:54,408 --> 01:41:57,248
(The kimchi bomb chicken that was prepared for two months)

2785
01:41:59,477 --> 01:42:02,747
(Like a miracle, customers came in one by one.)

2786
01:42:02,748 --> 01:42:04,816
They ordered that dish.

2787
01:42:04,817 --> 01:42:07,487
A lot of people came to eat it.

2788
01:42:07,488 --> 01:42:08,627
I felt very grateful.

2789
01:42:08,628 --> 01:42:10,068
This was done for such a good cause.

2790
01:42:10,427 --> 01:42:11,427
It was great.

2791
01:42:11,897 --> 01:42:13,137
It went beyond my expectations.

2792
01:42:13,967 --> 01:42:17,298
I want to sell this dish even after it gets revealed.

2793
01:42:20,307 --> 01:42:21,606
(A collaboration project...)

2794
01:42:21,607 --> 01:42:23,367
(with Sixth Sense and small business owners)

2795
01:42:23,878 --> 01:42:26,977
(We wish to help the owners.)

2796
01:42:27,677 --> 01:42:30,176
(The kimchi bomb chicken was fake.)

2797
01:42:30,177 --> 01:42:32,517
- They did a great job with this. - Right.

2798
01:42:32,777 --> 01:42:34,186
The owner looked so much better.

2799
01:42:34,187 --> 01:42:36,886
- It even made us feel better. - I wish it does well.

2800
01:42:36,887 --> 01:42:38,657
Right. That was great.

2801
01:42:38,658 --> 01:42:40,726
Will the coffee truck really be sent?

2802
01:42:40,727 --> 01:42:42,827
- We will sent the coffee truck. - Mimi should pick.

2803
01:42:42,828 --> 01:42:43,974
(Mimi will make the random pick.)

2804
01:42:43,998 --> 01:42:46,026
- I wish it's for Hye Lyun. - Should I reveal it?

2805
01:42:46,027 --> 01:42:47,067
- Yes. - One, two, three.

2806
01:42:47,267 --> 01:42:48,267
(Mimi)

2807
01:42:48,268 --> 01:42:49,327
It's Mimi!

2808
01:42:49,328 --> 01:42:50,867
(Mimi picked Mimi.)

2809
01:42:50,868 --> 01:42:52,136
The coffee truck will be sent to Mimi.

2810
01:42:52,137 --> 01:42:53,537
(Mimi got picked again after getting picked for the penalty.)

2811
01:42:53,538 --> 01:42:54,567
Thank you.

2812
01:42:55,203 --> 01:42:56,942
Gosh, this is amazing!

2813
01:42:56,943 --> 01:42:58,790
(The place where the members are feeling bursts of dopamine)

2814
01:42:58,814 --> 01:43:01,082
(Hot places, good restaurants, tours)

2815
01:43:01,083 --> 01:43:02,184
We're here in Busan.

2816
01:43:02,514 --> 01:43:03,583
(Busan)

2817
01:43:03,953 --> 01:43:05,112
(Busan syndrome)

2818
01:43:05,113 --> 01:43:07,354
(Getting too absorbed into Busan)

2819
01:43:07,623 --> 01:43:11,293
(Symptom 1: Humming)

2820
01:43:11,354 --> 01:43:12,452
(Singing)

2821
01:43:12,453 --> 01:43:14,564
(Symptom 2: Dance fever)

2822
01:43:14,894 --> 01:43:16,564
(Symptom 3: Fake Busan dialect)

2823
01:43:16,833 --> 01:43:18,263
(Kyung Pyo and I are from Busan.)

2824
01:43:18,264 --> 01:43:19,434
(From Seoul and Incheon)

2825
01:43:19,804 --> 01:43:21,964
(Today's theme for the ones who have fallen for Busan)

2826
01:43:26,274 --> 01:43:28,502
(Getting surprised...)

2827
01:43:28,503 --> 01:43:29,774
(and getting surprised again)

2828
01:43:30,113 --> 01:43:31,573
(The most shocking fake is coming.)

2829
01:43:32,073 --> 01:43:33,990
(The ones who will join the legendary Busan tour)

2830
01:43:34,014 --> 01:43:36,014
(Legendary guests, Kang Tae Oh and Lee Sun Bin)

2831
01:43:36,384 --> 01:43:38,264
(This place feels real! I am certain about it!)

2832
01:43:38,583 --> 01:43:41,099
(I don't think it's something that can be left for a long time.)

2833
01:43:41,123 --> 01:43:43,024
(You can't think too deeply about things.)

2834
01:43:45,123 --> 01:43:46,424
(What do we do then?)

2835
01:43:46,823 --> 01:43:48,964
(X-Man, spy)

2836
01:43:49,663 --> 01:43:53,433
(Unlike the first and second owners, this owner was really simple.)

2837
01:43:53,434 --> 01:43:54,874
(Are you going to have some or not?)

2838
01:43:55,104 --> 01:43:57,003
(The good-looking clumsy guy, Tae Oh)

2839
01:43:57,474 --> 01:43:59,974
(A Busan hot place tour with six blunt members)

2840
01:44:00,243 --> 01:44:02,143
- It's so pretty! - The sea is right there.

2841
01:44:02,144 --> 01:44:03,974
- Gosh! - Today's the best day!
