1
00:00:29,307 --> 00:00:32,517
(You can still feel the coldness of early spring.)

2
00:00:32,917 --> 00:00:35,787
(Dumulmeori, Yangpyeong-gun, Gyeonggi)

3
00:00:36,057 --> 00:00:37,616
Oh, it's cold.

4
00:00:37,617 --> 00:00:39,157
- Oh, my.
- It's so cold.

5
00:00:39,427 --> 00:00:41,786
It will air around April.

6
00:00:41,787 --> 00:00:43,097
- Right.
- Seriously.

7
00:00:43,427 --> 00:00:45,196
The weather doesn't match.

8
00:00:45,197 --> 00:00:47,466
You know, back in the day, we used to do two takes...

9
00:00:47,467 --> 00:00:48,826
of the opening in situations like this.

10
00:00:48,827 --> 00:00:49,966
(I see...)

11
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:52,096
We get one in this weather,

12
00:00:52,097 --> 00:00:54,666
and then a version for airing in April.

13
00:00:54,667 --> 00:00:56,176
It's a lot warmer now.

14
00:00:56,177 --> 00:00:57,537
Oh, that's nice.

15
00:00:58,437 --> 00:01:01,047
(Was he inspired by Yonsama's hair from back then too?)

16
00:01:01,207 --> 00:01:03,017
Acting as if we're not cold.

17
00:01:03,047 --> 00:01:04,247
It's not any warmer.

18
00:01:04,847 --> 00:01:06,916
- I'm wearing a long coat.
- Good job.

19
00:01:06,917 --> 00:01:08,647
But we have no choice.

20
00:01:08,917 --> 00:01:10,357
I got my hair done,

21
00:01:10,887 --> 00:01:12,556
but my hair...

22
00:01:12,557 --> 00:01:14,027
- I got my hair done.
- became like this.

23
00:01:14,457 --> 00:01:16,127
I got my hair done too,

24
00:01:16,397 --> 00:01:17,756
but I put on a beanie.

25
00:01:17,757 --> 00:01:18,996
Why is it so cold?

26
00:01:18,997 --> 00:01:20,466
(Keeping his hands in his sleeves because it's cold)

27
00:01:20,467 --> 00:01:22,066
What is with the weather?

28
00:01:22,067 --> 00:01:23,496
- Yangpyeong is normally cold.
- It is.

29
00:01:23,497 --> 00:01:25,966
- You're right.
- It's famous for being colder.

30
00:01:25,967 --> 00:01:27,066
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

31
00:01:27,067 --> 00:01:28,836
(Thanks to that, the air feels extra fresh.)

32
00:01:28,837 --> 00:01:30,907
(The air is nice.)

33
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:32,977
Yangpyeong.

34
00:01:33,447 --> 00:01:35,076
Oh, my. Where are we going today?

35
00:01:35,077 --> 00:01:36,116
Yangpyeong is so nice.

36
00:01:36,117 --> 00:01:37,716
- "I Do It All on My Own?" - It's nice. What is this?

37
00:01:37,717 --> 00:01:38,876
- "On my own?" - Oh, my.

38
00:01:38,877 --> 00:01:40,647
- "I Do It All on My Own?" - "Suspicious owner."

39
00:01:40,987 --> 00:01:42,747
I guess today's theme is "Suspicious owner."

40
00:01:44,017 --> 00:01:46,257
(Yangpyeong, Gyeonggi Province)

41
00:01:46,827 --> 00:01:48,886
(The largest area of Gyeonggi Province...)

42
00:01:48,887 --> 00:01:51,897
(and a famous vacation spot near Seoul)

43
00:01:52,197 --> 00:01:54,097
(In fall, Mount Yongmun and Mount Yumyeong)

44
00:01:54,227 --> 00:01:56,537
(In summer, Namhan River)

45
00:01:56,937 --> 00:02:00,706
(A charming city with nature and healing energy)

46
00:02:00,707 --> 00:02:02,337
(But here in Yangpyeong,)

47
00:02:02,437 --> 00:02:03,806
(there are...)

48
00:02:03,807 --> 00:02:05,307
(suspicious owners?)

49
00:02:06,277 --> 00:02:07,277
(1. I Do It All on My Own.)

50
00:02:07,277 --> 00:02:08,277
(2. Five Handsome Owners)

51
00:02:08,277 --> 00:02:09,277
(3. Steam and Eat)

52
00:02:09,377 --> 00:02:12,016
(They do everything themselves.)

53
00:02:12,017 --> 00:02:14,247
(1. Suspicious I Do It All on My Own)

54
00:02:14,587 --> 00:02:17,516
(Blessed with a beautiful face?)

55
00:02:17,517 --> 00:02:20,157
(2. Suspicious Five Handsome Owners)

56
00:02:20,357 --> 00:02:22,786
(The meeting of steam and rice?)

57
00:02:22,787 --> 00:02:25,397
(3. Suspicious Steam and Eat)

58
00:02:25,757 --> 00:02:27,567
(I see them! There!)

59
00:02:27,727 --> 00:02:28,927
(Surprised)

60
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:30,597
(They can't believe it even after seeing it.)

61
00:02:30,997 --> 00:02:34,207
(Out of the three trendy places in Yangpyeong,)

62
00:02:34,437 --> 00:02:36,176
(one fake place...)

63
00:02:36,177 --> 00:02:38,777
(will surprise you!)

64
00:02:39,207 --> 00:02:42,377
(Which of the places in Yangpyeong is fake?)

65
00:02:43,277 --> 00:02:44,916
"Five Handsome Owners?"

66
00:02:44,917 --> 00:02:46,016
So a handsome guy...

67
00:02:46,017 --> 00:02:48,246
- Or pretty.
- "Steam and Eat?" What is this?

68
00:02:48,247 --> 00:02:50,316
Does "I Live Alone" mean they do everything themselves?

69
00:02:50,317 --> 00:02:52,186
- They do everything on their own.
- Right.

70
00:02:52,187 --> 00:02:53,627
What do they do?

71
00:02:53,827 --> 00:02:55,586
There are many people...

72
00:02:55,587 --> 00:02:58,227
- Small stores.
- who run stores on their own.

73
00:02:58,327 --> 00:02:59,926
(Curious)

74
00:02:59,927 --> 00:03:01,566
Anyway, we have a meeting location.

75
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:03,197
- Let's walk.
- Let's go.

76
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:05,266
What did you do in Japan, Kyoung Pyo?

77
00:03:05,267 --> 00:03:07,266
I walked 20,000 steps every day.

78
00:03:07,267 --> 00:03:08,267
(They heard the news on "Pinggyego.")

79
00:03:08,268 --> 00:03:10,206
- To lose weight?
- It was kind of a detox...

80
00:03:10,207 --> 00:03:11,837
- and some meditation.
- I see.

81
00:03:12,337 --> 00:03:14,646
And as for the things I wanted to eat,

82
00:03:14,647 --> 00:03:16,647
I didn't have to worry because nobody was with me.

83
00:03:17,047 --> 00:03:19,646
So I freely ate what I wanted.

84
00:03:19,647 --> 00:03:21,086
What did you eat?

85
00:03:21,087 --> 00:03:24,086
- First, I like soba.
- I see.

86
00:03:24,087 --> 00:03:26,826
I like soba, ramen...

87
00:03:26,827 --> 00:03:30,696
- You like noodles.
- Yes. I like Bolognese pasta.

88
00:03:30,697 --> 00:03:33,527
- That's not exactly a detox, is it?
- Right.

89
00:03:33,697 --> 00:03:35,296
If I only eat one serving for each meal,

90
00:03:35,297 --> 00:03:36,367
that's a detox.

91
00:03:36,767 --> 00:03:37,966
- One serving for each meal?
- One serving?

92
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,396
- Yes, one serving.
- Not one meal a day?

93
00:03:39,397 --> 00:03:40,506
- Yes, one serving for each meal.
- One serving for each meal.

94
00:03:40,507 --> 00:03:41,636
I thought he was eating one meal a day.

95
00:03:41,637 --> 00:03:43,676
- One serving for each meal?
- One serving for each meal?

96
00:03:43,677 --> 00:03:45,707
- One serving for each meal. Okay.
- If I only have one serving...

97
00:03:47,107 --> 00:03:49,616
- Oh, my. Look at the ice.
- Oh, my. It's frozen.

98
00:03:49,617 --> 00:03:50,617
- Is it frozen?
- Oh, my!

99
00:03:51,417 --> 00:03:53,686
- Is that all frozen?
- It's all frozen. Oh, my.

100
00:03:53,687 --> 00:03:55,546
It's really cold these days.

101
00:03:55,547 --> 00:03:57,817
(The river is frozen solid from the extreme cold.)

102
00:03:58,487 --> 00:03:59,786
- That's so fascinating.
- Yangpyeong has...

103
00:03:59,787 --> 00:04:01,626
such great roads for cyclers.

104
00:04:01,627 --> 00:04:03,026
- That is very nice.
- They have great paths...

105
00:04:03,027 --> 00:04:06,227
for cycling and taking walks along the river.

106
00:04:07,267 --> 00:04:09,937
(A cycling course with the refreshing river breeze)

107
00:04:10,467 --> 00:04:14,407
(Namhan River and Bukhan River meet at Dumulmeori.)

108
00:04:15,237 --> 00:04:21,307
(It's a famous healing spot that is beautiful all year round.)

109
00:04:21,707 --> 00:04:23,646
- Oh, this place...
- It was popular for school trips.

110
00:04:23,647 --> 00:04:25,076
You're right. Instead of coming here on a school trip,

111
00:04:25,077 --> 00:04:26,787
- I should've bought some land here.
- Some land...

112
00:04:27,387 --> 00:04:28,916
How is Yangpyeong lately?

113
00:04:28,917 --> 00:04:30,516
- Did the land prices rise?
- Yes.

114
00:04:30,517 --> 00:04:32,686
Are you here to check out some land?

115
00:04:32,687 --> 00:04:35,126
- Mimi likes checking out land.
- You really look...

116
00:04:35,127 --> 00:04:38,156
You really look like a rich lady who came to buy land.

117
00:04:38,157 --> 00:04:39,326
- It's not bad.
- Mimi is really interested...

118
00:04:39,327 --> 00:04:40,926
- in that kind of thing lately.
- She seems to be.

119
00:04:40,927 --> 00:04:42,266
- Investments.
- It's normal for people that age...

120
00:04:42,267 --> 00:04:43,666
- to be interested in that.
- Right?

121
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:45,466
- You need to study more...
- It's normal.

122
00:04:45,467 --> 00:04:47,637
- about that as much as you can...
- Right. As much as I can.

123
00:04:47,807 --> 00:04:49,677
and plan your future.

124
00:04:49,937 --> 00:04:52,177
You two should do the things Eun I and I couldn't do.

125
00:04:53,247 --> 00:04:56,717
Why is a billionaire saying things like that?

126
00:04:56,877 --> 00:04:58,016
- You're a billionaire.
- A billionaire.

127
00:04:58,017 --> 00:04:59,717
Isn't your name Yu Billion?

128
00:04:59,987 --> 00:05:01,087
- Right?
- Yu Billion.

129
00:05:01,117 --> 00:05:02,816
- Mr. Yu Billion.
- Right?

130
00:05:02,817 --> 00:05:04,056
I wish I had a billion dollars.

131
00:05:04,057 --> 00:05:05,587
(While they make up stories about Jae Seok being a billionaire,)

132
00:05:06,017 --> 00:05:08,987
(two people are sitting by the river looking like a painting.)

133
00:05:09,157 --> 00:05:10,626
Aren't we pretty? Please take a picture for us.

134
00:05:10,627 --> 00:05:12,557
Pretty? I'm dying here.

135
00:05:13,797 --> 00:05:15,527
They don't know we're here, right?

136
00:05:16,637 --> 00:05:18,596
- They don't know we're here, right?
- They don't. We're surprise guests.

137
00:05:18,597 --> 00:05:19,837
(Original Sixth Sense members, Oh Na Ra and Jeon So Min)

138
00:05:20,207 --> 00:05:22,136
(The two sassy sisters...)

139
00:05:22,137 --> 00:05:24,537
(who always get Jae Seok choked up are here.)

140
00:05:24,837 --> 00:05:25,837
(The master of energy)

141
00:05:25,838 --> 00:05:27,177
(The queen of energy)

142
00:05:27,507 --> 00:05:29,747
(A true variety show lover)

143
00:05:30,077 --> 00:05:33,047
(Sixth Sense's forever passion queen, Oh Na Ra)

144
00:05:33,217 --> 00:05:34,817
(Scrunching her nose)

145
00:05:35,217 --> 00:05:36,217
Come here.

146
00:05:36,218 --> 00:05:38,086
(A lovely chemistry fairy)

147
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:41,687
(Also called Stone So Min)

148
00:05:41,787 --> 00:05:45,427
(Jae Seok's resident bully is back.)

149
00:05:45,757 --> 00:05:49,097
(We're here to bully Jae Seok.)

150
00:05:49,197 --> 00:05:51,537
Since we're here, we should put them in line.

151
00:05:53,337 --> 00:05:54,337
We're the originals.

152
00:05:54,707 --> 00:05:56,307
Like original gamjatang.

153
00:05:56,977 --> 00:05:58,807
Original jokbal.

154
00:05:59,507 --> 00:06:00,806
We're the originals.

155
00:06:00,807 --> 00:06:02,677
(Gamjatang and jokbal showing off about being the originals)

156
00:06:02,847 --> 00:06:04,616
We have guests today, right?

157
00:06:04,617 --> 00:06:06,046
- We do.
- I heard there were two.

158
00:06:06,047 --> 00:06:08,186
There they are. They're waving at us.

159
00:06:08,187 --> 00:06:09,987
- Where?
- Oh, my.

160
00:06:10,187 --> 00:06:12,486
- Here.
- Already...

161
00:06:12,487 --> 00:06:14,857
- They're already loud.
- They are from this distance?

162
00:06:15,227 --> 00:06:16,286
Celebrities!

163
00:06:16,287 --> 00:06:17,426
It feels like we're watching TV.

164
00:06:17,427 --> 00:06:18,427
(They can see the Blunt Siblings.)

165
00:06:18,428 --> 00:06:20,626
- Hey, run!
- Everyone!

166
00:06:20,627 --> 00:06:22,867
Today is going to be a bit tiring. Oh, goodness.

167
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:24,666
The four of us?

168
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:25,896
- Oh, gosh.
- Hello.

169
00:06:25,897 --> 00:06:27,007
I see them.

170
00:06:27,437 --> 00:06:28,466
(I see!)

171
00:06:28,467 --> 00:06:30,607
- It's So Min.
- It's So Min?

172
00:06:30,677 --> 00:06:32,736
- Eun I!
- What?

173
00:06:32,737 --> 00:06:34,077
- It's Na Ra!
- Hello.

174
00:06:34,447 --> 00:06:35,707
- Jae Seok!
- Oh, gosh.

175
00:06:35,907 --> 00:06:37,146
I'm so curious about her.

176
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:38,576
- Oh, my!
- This is too funny.

177
00:06:38,577 --> 00:06:39,746
- Hello!
- Hi.

178
00:06:39,747 --> 00:06:41,686
- This is so funny.
- It's like a drama.

179
00:06:41,687 --> 00:06:43,356
(The original Sixth Sense members and the Blunt Siblings meet.)

180
00:06:43,357 --> 00:06:44,856
It's been so long!

181
00:06:44,857 --> 00:06:46,116
(Hugging)

182
00:06:46,117 --> 00:06:47,527
- Oh, gosh.
- Hello.

183
00:06:47,887 --> 00:06:50,056
- Unfreeze me.
- I'll do it.

184
00:06:50,057 --> 00:06:51,996
- Unfreeze me.
- Here you go.

185
00:06:51,997 --> 00:06:53,867
(It's even more fun with all of them together.)

186
00:06:53,927 --> 00:06:55,567
- So Min! It's been so long.
- Hello.

187
00:06:55,597 --> 00:06:57,567
- Hello.
- Aren't you cold?

188
00:06:57,997 --> 00:06:59,166
- It's so cold, Jae Seok!
- I wanted to look pretty...

189
00:06:59,167 --> 00:07:00,306
because it's my first time going out in a while.

190
00:07:00,307 --> 00:07:01,307
You're wearing a hat.

191
00:07:01,308 --> 00:07:02,536
Let's give them some time to catch up.

192
00:07:02,537 --> 00:07:04,606
- Right, we should.
- They need time to catch up.

193
00:07:04,607 --> 00:07:07,176
- They're Yu Jae Seok's women.
- Right.

194
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:09,346
The treasure chest is open again.

195
00:07:09,347 --> 00:07:11,616
- My mouth is frozen.
- It's so cold!

196
00:07:11,617 --> 00:07:14,187
So Min. Aren't you cold?

197
00:07:14,417 --> 00:07:15,817
- I mean...
- So Min looks so cold.

198
00:07:16,047 --> 00:07:17,317
I'm so cold.

199
00:07:17,957 --> 00:07:20,056
Why are we in front of a river in this cold weather?

200
00:07:20,057 --> 00:07:22,556
- What are we doing here?
- Why are you dressed like this?

201
00:07:22,557 --> 00:07:23,557
- Jae Seok.
- What?

202
00:07:23,558 --> 00:07:24,797
My legs are bare.

203
00:07:25,127 --> 00:07:27,226
- The goosebumps...
- Oh, my!

204
00:07:27,227 --> 00:07:28,526
- The goosebumps!
- You're right.

205
00:07:28,527 --> 00:07:30,566
- Why aren't you wearing anything?
- You'll be in trouble later.

206
00:07:30,567 --> 00:07:32,296
- Sixth Sense really is so tough.
- Na Ra.

207
00:07:32,297 --> 00:07:33,836
I really dressed up for Sixth Sense.

208
00:07:33,837 --> 00:07:35,236
- Me too.
- Seriously.

209
00:07:35,237 --> 00:07:37,136
- Seriously.
- I really got dressed up.

210
00:07:37,137 --> 00:07:38,176
(Laughing)

211
00:07:38,177 --> 00:07:39,206
The hair.

212
00:07:39,207 --> 00:07:41,376
(The Blunt Siblings find everything funny.)

213
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:43,476
- But you're pretty today.
- I'm pretty?

214
00:07:43,477 --> 00:07:45,076
- Yes, you are.
- So Min became prettier, right?

215
00:07:45,077 --> 00:07:46,146
- It's red.
- What?

216
00:07:46,147 --> 00:07:47,887
- Didn't So Min get a lot prettier?
- Yes.

217
00:07:48,587 --> 00:07:50,217
- She's an actress.
- Well...

218
00:07:51,187 --> 00:07:52,617
(Laughing)

219
00:07:52,687 --> 00:07:53,687
(Laughing)

220
00:07:53,688 --> 00:07:55,157
Well... I mean...

221
00:07:55,557 --> 00:07:56,827
You just look cold.

222
00:07:57,027 --> 00:07:58,027
(Walking away)

223
00:07:58,028 --> 00:07:59,696
Doesn't she look like a pretty Japanese doll?

224
00:07:59,697 --> 00:08:01,767
- Where are you going?
- You're so pretty.

225
00:08:02,027 --> 00:08:04,497
(Turning around)

226
00:08:06,807 --> 00:08:09,467
(You still won't call me pretty?)

227
00:08:09,707 --> 00:08:11,737
Hey, what's with this cushion?

228
00:08:12,677 --> 00:08:14,806
They laid it down for us because it was too cold.

229
00:08:14,807 --> 00:08:15,906
- What is this?
- This is great!

230
00:08:15,907 --> 00:08:17,847
- It was too cold.
- What is this?

231
00:08:18,147 --> 00:08:19,546
So Min. They sell things like this these days?

232
00:08:19,547 --> 00:08:20,687
Isn't it so nice?

233
00:08:21,217 --> 00:08:23,617
It's okay. I'm fine, Jae Seok.

234
00:08:23,657 --> 00:08:25,086
- You need to be warm.
- I'm fine.

235
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,316
You need... Are you okay?

236
00:08:26,317 --> 00:08:28,487
This is what I used to see during Season One.

237
00:08:29,387 --> 00:08:31,056
(Me too.)

238
00:08:31,057 --> 00:08:34,166
Today, So Min and Na Ra...

239
00:08:34,167 --> 00:08:36,496
- have joined us on Sixth Sense.
- Yes!

240
00:08:36,497 --> 00:08:38,436
- Hello.
- Hello.

241
00:08:38,437 --> 00:08:39,866
In a way, they were a part...

242
00:08:39,867 --> 00:08:41,336
- of creating Sixth Sense.
- Right.

243
00:08:41,337 --> 00:08:43,236
- The founders.
- The founders.

244
00:08:43,237 --> 00:08:45,306
- The originals.
- The originals.

245
00:08:45,307 --> 00:08:48,046
- Like the original jokbal store.
- Like the original gamjatang store.

246
00:08:48,047 --> 00:08:49,477
- The original...
- Two original gamjatangs.

247
00:08:49,647 --> 00:08:50,647
Sounds delicious.

248
00:08:50,648 --> 00:08:52,276
Na Ra. Put this around your legs.

249
00:08:52,277 --> 00:08:53,446
- You should.
- Should I?

250
00:08:53,447 --> 00:08:55,386
- You should.
- You look so cold.

251
00:08:55,387 --> 00:08:56,556
It's okay.

252
00:08:56,557 --> 00:08:58,286
- It's okay.
- It's like a blanket.

253
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:01,227
- Anyway, we have to get going.
- Okay.

254
00:09:01,357 --> 00:09:03,056
- This place's famous for corn dogs.
- You're right.

255
00:09:03,057 --> 00:09:04,927
- That sounds yummy.
- Can we have corn dogs?

256
00:09:04,997 --> 00:09:06,727
- We need to hurry.
- Let's go.

257
00:09:07,767 --> 00:09:09,567
- It's been so long.
- Hurry.

258
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:11,996
- It's been so long.
- Kyoung Pyo.

259
00:09:11,997 --> 00:09:13,836
- Have you been well?
- Aren't we taking this camera?

260
00:09:13,837 --> 00:09:15,036
(Oh, right.)

261
00:09:15,037 --> 00:09:17,636
- Eun I.
- Why isn't anyone taking this one?

262
00:09:17,637 --> 00:09:19,036
(The camera...)

263
00:09:19,037 --> 00:09:21,607
I got it. Here, take it.

264
00:09:22,207 --> 00:09:23,976
- Hey, just leave it there.
- I mean...

265
00:09:23,977 --> 00:09:25,646
They leave a camera behind.

266
00:09:25,647 --> 00:09:27,017
- Eun I.
- I know it's cold, but...

267
00:09:28,087 --> 00:09:30,156
- You must've eaten a lot.
- You've gotten so much prettier.

268
00:09:30,157 --> 00:09:31,556
- You lost so much weight too.
- Me? No.

269
00:09:31,557 --> 00:09:32,616
Isn't it so cold?

270
00:09:32,617 --> 00:09:33,786
(They seem very close?)

271
00:09:33,787 --> 00:09:35,526
Seriously. Put these on.

272
00:09:35,527 --> 00:09:36,927
Put these on. It's too cold.

273
00:09:37,297 --> 00:09:39,426
- Thanks. I'll borrow them.
- Sure. Go ahead.

274
00:09:39,427 --> 00:09:40,467
Thanks.

275
00:09:40,567 --> 00:09:41,967
Watch your step.

276
00:09:42,997 --> 00:09:44,567
(Looking over)

277
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,196
Mimi. They used to date.

278
00:09:46,197 --> 00:09:47,507
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

279
00:09:47,607 --> 00:09:49,006
- Who?
- Kyoung Pyo and So Min.

280
00:09:49,007 --> 00:09:50,636
- So Min...
- Oh, really?

281
00:09:50,637 --> 00:09:51,836
When did you two date?

282
00:09:51,837 --> 00:09:53,377
No, there was nothing between us.

283
00:09:53,477 --> 00:09:55,576
- Is this going to be a scandal?
- Is that true, Na Ra?

284
00:09:55,577 --> 00:09:57,077
- These two?
- What are you talking about?

285
00:09:57,217 --> 00:09:58,246
What are you talking about?

286
00:09:58,247 --> 00:10:01,086
- We worked on something together.
- Yes, we did.

287
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,946
- We're really close.
- What did you do together?

288
00:10:02,947 --> 00:10:04,287
- It was called "Cross." - "Cross."

289
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:06,217
- Oh, right.
- Yes.

290
00:10:06,317 --> 00:10:07,586
(Kyoung Pyo 8 years ago, the role of a resident)

291
00:10:07,587 --> 00:10:09,787
(So Min, the role of an organ transplant coordinator)

292
00:10:10,227 --> 00:10:13,427
(They had feelings for each other in the drama.)

293
00:10:13,797 --> 00:10:14,996
Kyoung Pyo worked with me too.

294
00:10:14,997 --> 00:10:16,126
- You're right.
- What was it?

295
00:10:16,127 --> 00:10:18,566
- We did "Chicago Typewriter." - "Chicago Typewriter."

296
00:10:18,567 --> 00:10:19,567
(They met on "Chicago Typewriter," a tvN drama.)

297
00:10:19,568 --> 00:10:21,036
But back then,

298
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,306
I didn't know that Kyoung Pyo was so energetic and funny.

299
00:10:23,307 --> 00:10:25,376
- You didn't?
- He was really cool back then.

300
00:10:25,377 --> 00:10:27,046
I have a separate persona for variety shows.

301
00:10:27,047 --> 00:10:28,906
- Right.
- But one day, I saw him...

302
00:10:28,907 --> 00:10:30,177
take his shirt off,

303
00:10:30,517 --> 00:10:32,176
dancing and headbanging...

304
00:10:32,177 --> 00:10:33,916
- at an awards ceremony.
- He's so down to earth.

305
00:10:33,917 --> 00:10:36,446
- You saw the most viral videos.
- I didn't know he was so funny.

306
00:10:36,447 --> 00:10:38,617
He's an attention-seeker.

307
00:10:39,987 --> 00:10:41,086
- Kyoung Pyo is an attention-seeker.
- When I get attention,

308
00:10:41,087 --> 00:10:42,186
I get more and more happy.

309
00:10:42,187 --> 00:10:43,527
Yes, he's an attention-seeker.

310
00:10:43,927 --> 00:10:46,457
What is that? "Na Ra, So Min..." What is that?

311
00:10:46,697 --> 00:10:47,967
What is that?

312
00:10:48,027 --> 00:10:49,496
- Oh, my.
- We have a coffee truck today.

313
00:10:49,497 --> 00:10:50,996
(A surprise coffee truck next to the corn dog store)

314
00:10:50,997 --> 00:10:52,137
- Amazing.
- Oh, my gosh!

315
00:10:52,467 --> 00:10:53,667
- Oh, my!
- This is the best.

316
00:10:54,037 --> 00:10:55,837
You are the stars today.

317
00:10:56,437 --> 00:10:58,406
(Na Ra and So Min have come to Sixth Sense: City Tour.)

318
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,707
Normally, you need to guess the right answer to get this.

319
00:11:00,847 --> 00:11:02,247
You guys are getting special treatment.

320
00:11:02,847 --> 00:11:04,646
- Wait.
- Are we special?

321
00:11:04,647 --> 00:11:06,016
- What's going on?
- This is so cool.

322
00:11:06,017 --> 00:11:07,847
Why are you being so nice?

323
00:11:07,947 --> 00:11:10,187
- Hello.
- This is amazing.

324
00:11:10,387 --> 00:11:11,657
- It's the first time. Yes.
- It's the first time?

325
00:11:12,417 --> 00:11:15,486
- I'm so touched. What is this?
- The pictures.

326
00:11:15,487 --> 00:11:16,697
(Oh, my.)

327
00:11:16,827 --> 00:11:18,056
This is amazing.

328
00:11:18,057 --> 00:11:20,397
(Warm up with a warm drink.)

329
00:11:20,897 --> 00:11:22,396
- What do you want?
- Lemon tea.

330
00:11:22,397 --> 00:11:24,136
- Lemon tea?
- I'll get a lemon tea too.

331
00:11:24,137 --> 00:11:26,137
- Lemon tea.
- Three lemon teas, please.

332
00:11:26,807 --> 00:11:27,867
(Cup falling)

333
00:11:28,467 --> 00:11:29,537
(Nice catch.)

334
00:11:29,867 --> 00:11:31,106
- Nice.
- Oh, my!

335
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,506
(Suddenly showing a trick)

336
00:11:32,507 --> 00:11:34,206
Okay. Here you go.

337
00:11:34,207 --> 00:11:35,246
(Shy)

338
00:11:35,247 --> 00:11:36,247
(Laughing)

339
00:11:36,248 --> 00:11:37,747
- Why did you juggle?
- Sorry?

340
00:11:38,647 --> 00:11:40,287
So Min. Why did you...

341
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:41,986
I'm not sure.

342
00:11:41,987 --> 00:11:43,556
- I keep feeling...
- This is so fascinating.

343
00:11:43,557 --> 00:11:44,557
This is so fascinating.

344
00:11:44,558 --> 00:11:45,756
- I'm sorry, Mimi.
- It's okay.

345
00:11:45,757 --> 00:11:46,926
- I just...
- This feels like Season One.

346
00:11:46,927 --> 00:11:49,086
It's been a while since I've been in front of a camera.

347
00:11:49,087 --> 00:11:50,256
- I totally get it.
- What do you want, Na Ra?

348
00:11:50,257 --> 00:11:51,597
- Your nose is running...
- Oh, no.

349
00:11:51,957 --> 00:11:53,227
My nose is really runny.

350
00:11:53,927 --> 00:11:54,927
It's cold.

351
00:11:54,928 --> 00:11:56,497
(So cute.)

352
00:11:56,527 --> 00:11:58,696
- Lemon tea.
- Thank you.

353
00:11:58,697 --> 00:11:59,867
It's hot.

354
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:01,067
Thank you.

355
00:12:01,068 --> 00:12:02,206
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

356
00:12:02,207 --> 00:12:04,077
- Thank you for the drinks.
- Have a good day.

357
00:12:04,507 --> 00:12:06,106
They have really good corn dogs here.

358
00:12:06,107 --> 00:12:07,577
I've never had this before.

359
00:12:08,507 --> 00:12:11,277
(This famous store known for their long lines...)

360
00:12:11,477 --> 00:12:14,087
(uses lotus leaves that fill Dumulmeori in summertime...)

361
00:12:14,347 --> 00:12:16,187
(to make their special corn dogs.)

362
00:12:16,587 --> 00:12:20,957
(It's also on Yeong Ja's favorites list!)

363
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:24,797
(Yangpyeong's top-tier trendy place that took over social media)

364
00:12:25,057 --> 00:12:26,397
Hello.

365
00:12:26,727 --> 00:12:28,626
Hey, it's usually hard to eat here.

366
00:12:28,627 --> 00:12:30,836
- Really?
- It's usually hard to eat here.

367
00:12:30,837 --> 00:12:32,137
(Come and have a taste.)

368
00:12:32,437 --> 00:12:33,566
- Oh, my. This place...
- Oh, my.

369
00:12:33,567 --> 00:12:35,236
Eun I told us...

370
00:12:35,237 --> 00:12:36,777
- that it was hard to eat here.
- That it was hard to eat here.

371
00:12:36,977 --> 00:12:39,036
I saw you on another show.

372
00:12:39,037 --> 00:12:40,106
You're right.

373
00:12:40,107 --> 00:12:41,276
We haven't started yet, right?

374
00:12:41,277 --> 00:12:43,046
- This place isn't fake, right?
- No, it's not.

375
00:12:43,047 --> 00:12:44,217
This is a City Tour.

376
00:12:44,247 --> 00:12:45,347
You can relax a bit.

377
00:12:45,747 --> 00:12:47,216
She's on her toes.

378
00:12:47,217 --> 00:12:50,217
These two act really sharp,

379
00:12:50,657 --> 00:12:52,287
but they're not that good at guessing.

380
00:12:53,157 --> 00:12:54,657
I've done this with them before.

381
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:56,627
I'll find the fake place today.

382
00:12:56,757 --> 00:12:58,296
- Really? Today?
- Yes.

383
00:12:58,297 --> 00:12:59,727
- Nice.
- I'll show you.

384
00:13:00,127 --> 00:13:02,327
- How many mild ones?
- Me.

385
00:13:02,367 --> 00:13:04,496
- Four.
- So, 2 spicy ones and 4 mild ones?

386
00:13:04,497 --> 00:13:06,467
- Yes. Thank you.
- Yes. Thank you.

387
00:13:06,567 --> 00:13:07,666
It's warm in here.

388
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:09,166
(Nice.)

389
00:13:09,167 --> 00:13:10,537
Na Ra. Stay by the heat.

390
00:13:10,737 --> 00:13:11,836
(The Sixth Sense members warm up while waiting for their corn dogs.)

391
00:13:11,837 --> 00:13:13,307
It's so nice here. It's warm.

392
00:13:13,707 --> 00:13:15,577
Your jacket might get stuck. Be careful.

393
00:13:16,347 --> 00:13:19,177
(Father Yu is always making sure accidents don't happen.)

394
00:13:19,317 --> 00:13:20,347
Is it fake leather?

395
00:13:20,817 --> 00:13:22,387
If so, it could get stuck.

396
00:13:22,747 --> 00:13:23,817
Fake leather.

397
00:13:24,957 --> 00:13:25,986
Why did you...

398
00:13:25,987 --> 00:13:27,887
suddenly juggle with the disposable cups?

399
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,157
(It's still a mystery to him.)

400
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:31,726
She caught the falling cups,

401
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,867
and when we cheered, she got excited.

402
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:35,426
I feel so anxious.

403
00:13:35,427 --> 00:13:36,466
That's not what they do on variety shows these days.

404
00:13:36,467 --> 00:13:37,836
- Really?
- You need to be natural.

405
00:13:37,837 --> 00:13:38,866
(Bursting into laughter)

406
00:13:38,867 --> 00:13:41,237
(They're so funny.)

407
00:13:41,337 --> 00:13:42,967
This is so intense.

408
00:13:43,107 --> 00:13:44,977
- They're close, right?
- Yes.

409
00:13:45,677 --> 00:13:47,946
- We're really close.
- We really are.

410
00:13:47,947 --> 00:13:49,247
(We're great. We're really close.)

411
00:13:49,347 --> 00:13:51,277
"We're really close."

412
00:13:51,777 --> 00:13:53,376
- You two kind of look like...
- They're hilarious.

413
00:13:53,377 --> 00:13:54,747
you're on a trip to rediscover your youth...

414
00:13:55,917 --> 00:13:57,357
- A healing trip.
- A healing trip.

415
00:13:57,557 --> 00:13:59,186
- People do that sometimes.
- They do.

416
00:13:59,187 --> 00:14:01,327
"Girl. I have to get out of the house."

417
00:14:01,827 --> 00:14:03,186
- "Let's go out." - "Let's go somewhere."

418
00:14:03,187 --> 00:14:04,256
- "Let's go out." - Right.

419
00:14:04,257 --> 00:14:05,697
But my knees are starting to hurt.

420
00:14:06,057 --> 00:14:08,527
- I should've stayed at home.
- A trip to rediscover...

421
00:14:08,767 --> 00:14:10,767
their youth with a friend.

422
00:14:10,897 --> 00:14:12,737
It's perfect. A Dumulmeori corn dog.

423
00:14:13,237 --> 00:14:15,737
(Let's go to find Yangyeong corn dogs too.)

424
00:14:16,337 --> 00:14:20,007
(Dip it in a signature green batter made with lotus leaf...)

425
00:14:20,647 --> 00:14:24,977
(and add a generous amount of bread crumbs!)

426
00:14:25,877 --> 00:14:28,847
(Dunk it in clean oil they replace every day.)

427
00:14:29,647 --> 00:14:32,917
(Your warm, crunchy corn dogs are ready.)

428
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:35,556
- Should we get some sugar?
- Yes, we should.

429
00:14:35,557 --> 00:14:37,357
Please give me one with all of the seasonings.

430
00:14:37,527 --> 00:14:41,096
(Add a nice coating of sugar.)

431
00:14:41,097 --> 00:14:43,636
That's such a pretty coating of sugar and ketchup.

432
00:14:43,637 --> 00:14:46,296
(Squeeze on ketchup and mustard.)

433
00:14:46,297 --> 00:14:48,706
Oh, my. It's a whole performance.

434
00:14:48,707 --> 00:14:50,207
(Even the performance is perfect.)

435
00:14:50,437 --> 00:14:52,176
This looks tasty.

436
00:14:52,177 --> 00:14:54,976
Mimi looks like Daenggi Boy from the back today.

437
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:55,977
(Moving to the rhythm)

438
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,676
- Daenggi Boy.
- "Therapist Buddha."

439
00:14:57,677 --> 00:14:58,677
(Today, Mimi is Daenggi Boy.)

440
00:14:58,678 --> 00:14:59,717
So cute.

441
00:15:00,587 --> 00:15:01,647
Daenggi Boy.

442
00:15:02,517 --> 00:15:05,386
- Oh, my. The spicy one.
- The spicy one.

443
00:15:05,387 --> 00:15:06,957
- Thank you.
- Let's eat.

444
00:15:07,257 --> 00:15:08,556
(Daenggi Mimi takes a big bite.)

445
00:15:08,557 --> 00:15:09,627
This is delicious.

446
00:15:10,457 --> 00:15:11,727
(Steaming)

447
00:15:12,057 --> 00:15:14,467
- Oh, it's delicious!
- Isn't it delicious?

448
00:15:15,067 --> 00:15:16,126
Oh, my.

449
00:15:16,127 --> 00:15:18,767
(Kyoung Pyo takes a big bite too.)

450
00:15:19,637 --> 00:15:20,637
(Exclaiming)

451
00:15:22,007 --> 00:15:23,677
That's why it kind of has the color of lotus leaves.

452
00:15:23,877 --> 00:15:26,907
I can tell that they fried it two times.

453
00:15:28,047 --> 00:15:29,077
This is so delicious.

454
00:15:31,047 --> 00:15:33,546
(Getting some of the big sausage)

455
00:15:33,547 --> 00:15:35,547
- Gosh.
- The sausage is so big.

456
00:15:35,647 --> 00:15:37,787
The ones in front of schools used to be this small.

457
00:15:37,887 --> 00:15:40,056
- Right.
- They're really generous here.

458
00:15:40,057 --> 00:15:43,086
- It's crunchy and savory.
- It's really delicious.

459
00:15:43,087 --> 00:15:44,227
(This Yangpyeong corn dog is worth lining up for.)

460
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,627
- I really...
- Right.

461
00:15:46,857 --> 00:15:48,966
missed eating on Sixth Sense more than home-cooked food.

462
00:15:48,967 --> 00:15:50,366
- Me too.
- Why?

463
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:52,536
It's tasty. The food that the crew makes.

464
00:15:52,537 --> 00:15:53,866
And we eat lots of interesting things.

465
00:15:53,867 --> 00:15:54,937
A food truck?

466
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,976
No, the fake food that the crew makes.

467
00:15:56,977 --> 00:15:59,137
- Oh, the fake food?
- It's so delicious.

468
00:15:59,237 --> 00:16:02,247
- But when I was there, we ate bugs.
- What?

469
00:16:02,447 --> 00:16:04,717
- You're right. We ate ants.
- The ant food.

470
00:16:04,977 --> 00:16:07,747
(They ate ant and sikhye sorbet on Sixth Sense 3, Episode 1.)

471
00:16:07,947 --> 00:16:10,287
(It's better than I expected.)

472
00:16:10,317 --> 00:16:11,356
(Eating)

473
00:16:11,357 --> 00:16:13,927
- I actually wanted to apologize.
- Why?

474
00:16:14,187 --> 00:16:16,756
- You got COVID because of us.
- I did get it that day.

475
00:16:16,757 --> 00:16:18,126
- Oh, right.
- It's okay.

476
00:16:18,127 --> 00:16:19,326
I really felt so bad.

477
00:16:19,327 --> 00:16:20,567
Now that I think about it,

478
00:16:21,367 --> 00:16:22,996
Sang Yeob's nose was so runny,

479
00:16:22,997 --> 00:16:25,067
so I gave him a tissue and told him to wipe his nose.

480
00:16:25,437 --> 00:16:26,666
That's right.

481
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:27,936
I can say it now because it's in the past.

482
00:16:27,937 --> 00:16:28,966
- Right.
- Yes.

483
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:31,606
I felt so bad. You were our guest for the first episode,

484
00:16:31,607 --> 00:16:32,937
- and as soon as you came...
- You're right.

485
00:16:33,207 --> 00:16:35,247
- There was nothing we could do.
- Here, Eun I.

486
00:16:35,607 --> 00:16:36,677
All of us.

487
00:16:37,317 --> 00:16:38,377
Jong Kook also said,

488
00:16:39,277 --> 00:16:40,947
"Oh, gosh. Jae Seok."

489
00:16:42,047 --> 00:16:43,757
"My immune system must be great." So I asked why.

490
00:16:43,957 --> 00:16:46,656
"Someone I knew wanted to talk,"

491
00:16:46,657 --> 00:16:48,086
"so we talked in the car for 30 minutes..."

492
00:16:48,087 --> 00:16:49,327
"with the windows closed."

493
00:16:50,027 --> 00:16:51,427
"But I was totally fine."

494
00:16:52,157 --> 00:16:53,327
Then two weeks later, he got it too.

495
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:54,927
(Laughing)

496
00:16:55,197 --> 00:16:57,037
The symptoms started showing right after the incubation period.

497
00:16:57,797 --> 00:17:00,566
You shouldn't say things like, "I have a good immune system."

498
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:02,166
"When it comes to health,"

499
00:17:02,167 --> 00:17:03,737
"I don't even get colds."

500
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:05,477
People who say that get really sick once in a while.

501
00:17:06,737 --> 00:17:08,076
- They end up in the hospital...
- Right.

502
00:17:08,077 --> 00:17:09,377
- with an IV drip.
- That's right.

503
00:17:09,847 --> 00:17:10,847
It hits them really hard.

504
00:17:10,848 --> 00:17:11,916
(Today's lesson: Don't be overly confident.)

505
00:17:11,917 --> 00:17:12,917
"With an IV drip."

506
00:17:13,677 --> 00:17:15,916
Kyoung Pyo is almost done.

507
00:17:15,917 --> 00:17:17,157
I think I'll finish mine.

508
00:17:17,617 --> 00:17:18,617
(Laughing)

509
00:17:18,618 --> 00:17:21,457
(Foodie Kyoung Pyo's detox, 1 serving for 1 meal)

510
00:17:22,887 --> 00:17:24,797
- Hey...
- Why aren't you eating?

511
00:17:25,357 --> 00:17:26,897
You basically just nibbled at it.

512
00:17:27,397 --> 00:17:29,367
- She only ate the bread part.
- What are you doing?

513
00:17:29,997 --> 00:17:33,266
You just said you missed the food on Sixth Sense.

514
00:17:33,267 --> 00:17:35,506
I missed the crew's cooking.

515
00:17:35,507 --> 00:17:38,507
- The crew's cooking.
- I thought I felt her eating it.

516
00:17:38,607 --> 00:17:40,337
(Like this)

517
00:17:40,547 --> 00:17:42,576
We were shooting the inserts, pretending to eat.

518
00:17:42,577 --> 00:17:43,577
(Munching)

519
00:17:43,847 --> 00:17:46,277
Oh, Oh Na Ra is so funny.

520
00:17:46,717 --> 00:17:48,416
Oh, Mimi. You finished it. Are you going to be okay?

521
00:17:48,417 --> 00:17:49,417
- It's tasty.
- Give it to me.

522
00:17:49,517 --> 00:17:52,487
It was so tasty. We enjoyed it. Thank you.

523
00:17:53,457 --> 00:17:55,587
- Okay. Thank you.
- That was delicious.

524
00:17:55,757 --> 00:17:58,597
- That was really great. Thank you.
- Thank you.

525
00:17:59,527 --> 00:18:01,867
You two really don't change.

526
00:18:01,967 --> 00:18:03,026
- Seriously.
- You look the same.

527
00:18:03,027 --> 00:18:04,236
- I eat preservatives.
- You really look the same.

528
00:18:04,237 --> 00:18:05,396
- She does.
- You eat preservatives?

529
00:18:05,397 --> 00:18:07,906
- I really do, Eun I.
- It really seems like it.

530
00:18:07,907 --> 00:18:09,966
- I eat tons of preservatives.
- When she opens a pack of seaweed,

531
00:18:09,967 --> 00:18:11,077
she eats the preservatives first.

532
00:18:11,907 --> 00:18:13,706
You didn't know that, did you?

533
00:18:13,707 --> 00:18:15,806
- I see.
- You can hear the popping sounds.

534
00:18:15,807 --> 00:18:17,317
- Oh, goodness.
- It's only for me.

535
00:18:18,147 --> 00:18:20,216
(Jae Seok finished his business.)

536
00:18:20,217 --> 00:18:22,546
Jae Seok. You can finish putting on your shoes.

537
00:18:22,547 --> 00:18:23,547
Oh, right.

538
00:18:23,747 --> 00:18:25,787
You know. Kids who are impatient.

539
00:18:25,887 --> 00:18:28,726
- "Wait for me!" - I do that.

540
00:18:28,727 --> 00:18:29,757
- I do that.
- How did you know?

541
00:18:30,627 --> 00:18:33,226
- Oh, you have to do this.
- The impatient kids.

542
00:18:33,227 --> 00:18:36,496
If you're too in a hurry, you basically fly as you jump.

543
00:18:36,497 --> 00:18:37,967
(Fly, Locust.)

544
00:18:38,167 --> 00:18:40,536
- I know what you mean.
- Like a special talent.

545
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:41,807
- Shall we go?
- Let's go.

546
00:18:42,907 --> 00:18:46,537
(Heading to I Do It All On My Own)

547
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:50,447
It's been so long! This used to be my spot.

548
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:53,277
(They're happy to see the Sixth Sense camera.)

549
00:18:53,447 --> 00:18:55,086
It's really cold today.

550
00:18:55,087 --> 00:18:58,056
- Seriously, it's so windy.
- Yangpyeong is always cold.

551
00:18:58,057 --> 00:18:59,356
Apparently, it'll start to get hot in April.

552
00:18:59,357 --> 00:19:00,627
- In April?
- Yes.

553
00:19:01,087 --> 00:19:02,227
April is normally hot.

554
00:19:03,327 --> 00:19:05,827
- Oh, really?
- "Oh, really?"

555
00:19:05,897 --> 00:19:07,996
- So funny.
- Where are you from, Mimi?

556
00:19:07,997 --> 00:19:09,597
Me? It's a bit of a mix.

557
00:19:10,227 --> 00:19:11,796
- Jeju Island and...
- Really?

558
00:19:11,797 --> 00:19:13,736
- South Gyeongsang Province.
- Where were you born?

559
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:14,866
- She was born in Jeju.
- I was born in Jeju.

560
00:19:14,867 --> 00:19:15,867
Jeju? Gosh.

561
00:19:15,868 --> 00:19:18,836
So after living in various places, her accents got mixed up.

562
00:19:18,837 --> 00:19:21,546
- That's cool.
- So she talks like a foreigner.

563
00:19:21,547 --> 00:19:23,476
- It's all Mimi Language.
- That's right.

564
00:19:23,477 --> 00:19:24,746
(They're really mixed up.)

565
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:26,477
You're very unique.

566
00:19:26,717 --> 00:19:28,947
It's really frozen here.

567
00:19:29,617 --> 00:19:30,656
That's so cool.

568
00:19:30,657 --> 00:19:32,387
(Out of the window, they see Namhan River totally frozen.)

569
00:19:33,287 --> 00:19:37,597
(Yangpyeong has become a pure, snowy land.)

570
00:19:37,957 --> 00:19:40,627
It's freezing, then melting. The sunny parts have melted.

571
00:19:40,727 --> 00:19:44,066
Back in the day, didn't we ride sleighs on rivers like this?

572
00:19:44,067 --> 00:19:45,597
- We did.
- We all did.

573
00:19:45,837 --> 00:19:47,637
We should really ice skate here.

574
00:19:47,737 --> 00:19:48,737
That would be dangerous.

575
00:19:48,737 --> 00:19:49,737
(Super Thinking Type)

576
00:19:49,867 --> 00:19:51,876
You're 1t right now.

577
00:19:51,877 --> 00:19:54,407
- I'm 0.1t.
- You're 0.1t.

578
00:19:54,507 --> 00:19:55,846
I'm not that heavy yet.

579
00:19:55,847 --> 00:19:57,377
(Happy Kyoung Pyo has expanded by the tonne.)

580
00:19:57,777 --> 00:19:59,816
- Na Ra. Here.
- What?

581
00:19:59,817 --> 00:20:01,246
- What is this?
- You should take a look.

582
00:20:01,247 --> 00:20:02,646
It's the map they got today.

583
00:20:02,647 --> 00:20:04,487
I...

584
00:20:04,957 --> 00:20:06,786
What is it called? I have a phobia of printed letters,

585
00:20:06,787 --> 00:20:08,656
so I can't really look at this.

586
00:20:08,657 --> 00:20:10,087
A phobia of printed letters.

587
00:20:10,797 --> 00:20:12,157
Then how do you read scripts?

588
00:20:13,257 --> 00:20:15,496
A phobia of printed letters due to slow focusing.

589
00:20:15,497 --> 00:20:16,726
Yes, I have a phobia of printed letters.

590
00:20:16,727 --> 00:20:18,096
But I can kind of look at them when I get paid.

591
00:20:18,097 --> 00:20:19,496
- Oh, when you get paid?
- Oh, you can read...

592
00:20:19,497 --> 00:20:20,497
the amount that you were paid.

593
00:20:20,498 --> 00:20:21,537
- Yes.
- That's enough.

594
00:20:22,007 --> 00:20:23,736
By slow focusing,

595
00:20:23,737 --> 00:20:26,036
- we mean bad sight due to age.
- Oh, slow focusing.

596
00:20:26,037 --> 00:20:28,946
- I don't have bad sight yet.
- Oh, really?

597
00:20:28,947 --> 00:20:30,846
I can see things up close well.

598
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:33,476
- Oh, you just feel that way.
- I can see well...

599
00:20:33,477 --> 00:20:35,247
It seems you can see well but can't read well.

600
00:20:36,147 --> 00:20:37,786
That's what slow focusing is.

601
00:20:37,787 --> 00:20:39,856
So when things don't come into focus right away, that's slow focusing?

602
00:20:39,857 --> 00:20:42,457
- That's slow focusing.
- Oh, it's here. It has begun.

603
00:20:42,557 --> 00:20:43,627
Oh, goodness.

604
00:20:44,727 --> 00:20:47,867
So the fake thing we need to look for today...

605
00:20:47,967 --> 00:20:49,096
The suspicious owner.

606
00:20:49,097 --> 00:20:51,396
Tell us the keyword too. We weren't here for the opening.

607
00:20:51,397 --> 00:20:52,566
It's on the map.

608
00:20:52,567 --> 00:20:54,806
- So Min is getting started.
- Detective Jeon So Min.

609
00:20:54,807 --> 00:20:57,136
Yes. Actually,

610
00:20:57,137 --> 00:21:00,206
I'm really good at things like that.

611
00:21:00,207 --> 00:21:03,206
For example, catching someone who is having an affair.

612
00:21:03,207 --> 00:21:04,247
(Widening her eyes)

613
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:07,346
- You haven't changed at all.
- That's useless for this show.

614
00:21:07,347 --> 00:21:09,746
I have great intuition for things like that.

615
00:21:09,747 --> 00:21:10,816
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

616
00:21:10,817 --> 00:21:12,787
It's because So Min keeps casually dropping questions.

617
00:21:13,117 --> 00:21:15,627
Yes, I do interrogate a bit.

618
00:21:15,987 --> 00:21:18,756
You need to look at reflections in mirrors...

619
00:21:18,757 --> 00:21:21,127
and fingers on the edge of pictures on social media.

620
00:21:21,227 --> 00:21:23,196
- You need to look at car tires.
- Why would you look at car tires?

621
00:21:23,197 --> 00:21:26,267
If there is dirt on it or pebbles stuck in it.

622
00:21:26,467 --> 00:21:29,406
- Fruit flies on the side mirrors.
- Oh, fruit flies.

623
00:21:29,407 --> 00:21:30,976
- I see.
- Look at things like that.

624
00:21:30,977 --> 00:21:33,076
Even if you don't text a lot,

625
00:21:33,077 --> 00:21:34,476
you can communicate enough.

626
00:21:34,477 --> 00:21:35,777
If he suddenly signs up for a gym membership,

627
00:21:36,077 --> 00:21:37,877
- that means he needs his own time.
- Okay.

628
00:21:37,977 --> 00:21:39,947
Isn't that an investigation?

629
00:21:40,477 --> 00:21:42,987
You need to grow your love, but you grew something else.

630
00:21:44,217 --> 00:21:46,857
- Oh, gosh.
- You need to watch those things.

631
00:21:47,087 --> 00:21:48,087
- I see.
- Yes.

632
00:21:48,088 --> 00:21:51,057
Compared to that, Na Ra is...

633
00:21:51,857 --> 00:21:54,026
My love is so peaceful.

634
00:21:54,027 --> 00:21:55,566
Oh, my.

635
00:21:55,567 --> 00:21:57,126
- It's been a long time, right?
- It's so beautiful.

636
00:21:57,127 --> 00:21:59,396
- Very long.
- It's been almost 20 years, right?

637
00:21:59,397 --> 00:22:01,636
- Oh, my.
- It's been over 20 years.

638
00:22:01,637 --> 00:22:04,307
- It's been 25 years.
- Na Ra has done it.

639
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:07,036
When you were five, I was dating, Mimi.

640
00:22:07,037 --> 00:22:08,806
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my.

641
00:22:08,807 --> 00:22:10,546
She could've given birth to Mimi.

642
00:22:10,547 --> 00:22:11,677
- Oh, my.
- Hey!

643
00:22:12,817 --> 00:22:14,546
Mom!

644
00:22:14,547 --> 00:22:16,046
- Be quiet!
- Mom.

645
00:22:16,047 --> 00:22:17,147
- Mom?
- Mom.

646
00:22:17,917 --> 00:22:20,256
- I wish I had a daughter like you.
- That'd be so nice.

647
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:22,426
- You make a lot of money.
- I'd be so happy.

648
00:22:22,427 --> 00:22:25,356
No, because I like designer brands. I'd make us go bankrupt.

649
00:22:25,357 --> 00:22:27,997
- Mimi spends all of her money.
- She likes designer brands.

650
00:22:28,697 --> 00:22:31,536
Lately... I have a big appetite, right?

651
00:22:31,537 --> 00:22:34,037
- Do you not anymore?
- I don't really like eating.

652
00:22:34,807 --> 00:22:37,166
- It means your digestion is slow.
- That's right.

653
00:22:37,167 --> 00:22:40,006
Yes. So I can't eat because I'm always full.

654
00:22:40,007 --> 00:22:42,507
You were really nibbling at the corn dog.

655
00:22:43,307 --> 00:22:45,047
She was peeling it with her teeth.

656
00:22:45,617 --> 00:22:47,887
So Min did juggling during the opening.

657
00:22:48,287 --> 00:22:50,687
Na Ra pretended to eat her corn dog.

658
00:22:51,757 --> 00:22:53,017
You two are really great.

659
00:22:53,787 --> 00:22:54,827
You really are.

660
00:22:55,127 --> 00:22:58,957
(What funny things will our original Sixth Sense members do today?)

661
00:22:59,357 --> 00:23:00,527
We're going up a mountain.

662
00:23:00,927 --> 00:23:02,897
This feels like a bed and breakfast.

663
00:23:03,197 --> 00:23:05,637
- You're right.
- Is it kind of a campsite?

664
00:23:07,437 --> 00:23:08,536
Is it that up there?

665
00:23:08,537 --> 00:23:10,236
("I Do It All On My Own" is in this quiet place?)

666
00:23:10,237 --> 00:23:11,537
This is so high.

667
00:23:12,677 --> 00:23:14,876
- Where? It must be here.
- This is it.

668
00:23:14,877 --> 00:23:16,446
- What is this?
- How pretty.

669
00:23:16,447 --> 00:23:18,016
- Oh, it's so pretty.
- How pretty.

670
00:23:18,017 --> 00:23:20,717
Look at the view. You can see everything.

671
00:23:21,447 --> 00:23:22,917
Thank you. Oh, my.

672
00:23:25,017 --> 00:23:26,117
What is this?

673
00:23:27,187 --> 00:23:30,226
- Isn't this too big?
- Seriously. It's too big.

674
00:23:30,227 --> 00:23:31,897
- Oh, my.
- Thank you.

675
00:23:31,997 --> 00:23:33,626
- This place is too big.
- It's too big.

676
00:23:33,627 --> 00:23:35,427
- It's like a castle.
- Yes.

677
00:23:36,297 --> 00:23:39,437
(Once you drive up a narrow, bendy road)

678
00:23:40,137 --> 00:23:41,766
What is this place?

679
00:23:41,767 --> 00:23:43,036
(Hidden deep in the mountains)

680
00:23:43,037 --> 00:23:44,536
I don't think this is it.

681
00:23:44,537 --> 00:23:47,007
(There is a huge castle)

682
00:23:48,507 --> 00:23:52,447
(What did they do all on their own here?)

683
00:23:52,817 --> 00:23:54,917
- The owner is up there. Look!
- Hold on.

684
00:23:55,357 --> 00:23:56,726
The owner is up there. Look!

685
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:57,926
- Hold on.
- Oh, so this is the right place.

686
00:23:57,927 --> 00:23:59,656
- Look where?
- Up there.

687
00:23:59,657 --> 00:24:01,367
- He's doing something up there.
- Where?

688
00:24:01,727 --> 00:24:04,096
- Guys, look at that.
- He's chopping firewood.

689
00:24:04,097 --> 00:24:05,667
I bet he's faking it.

690
00:24:06,137 --> 00:24:08,706
- But I think this place is fake.
- I think...

691
00:24:08,707 --> 00:24:10,906
- that someone gave him a cue.
- Right. He's faking it.

692
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:12,936
- Someone gave him a cue.
- Someone definitely gave him a cue.

693
00:24:12,937 --> 00:24:14,476
- Oh, my.
- It's for us to see.

694
00:24:14,477 --> 00:24:16,376
- Let's go for now. It's planned.
- I'm sure he's acting.

695
00:24:16,377 --> 00:24:18,276
- My point, exactly.
- What is he chopping?

696
00:24:18,277 --> 00:24:19,676
I'm sure he was waiting for us and then started doing it.

697
00:24:19,677 --> 00:24:20,677
(Everyone is already distrustful.)

698
00:24:20,877 --> 00:24:23,186
- Seeing that he's chopping wood...
- Yes?

699
00:24:23,187 --> 00:24:24,316
It must be pizza.

700
00:24:24,317 --> 00:24:25,957
- Is wood for a wood-fired oven?
- Is it for a wood-fired oven?

701
00:24:26,857 --> 00:24:28,126
This place seems too large...

702
00:24:28,127 --> 00:24:29,927
- for him to run all by himself.
- Exactly.

703
00:24:30,457 --> 00:24:32,196
The floor size alone must be...

704
00:24:32,197 --> 00:24:33,526
- It's also very long depthwise.
- Indeed.

705
00:24:33,527 --> 00:24:34,867
- Oh, hello, sir.
- It's huge.

706
00:24:35,267 --> 00:24:36,367
- Exactly.
- Hello.

707
00:24:36,867 --> 00:24:38,066
- I mean, how...
- Oh, hello.

708
00:24:38,067 --> 00:24:39,067
Hello.

709
00:24:39,068 --> 00:24:41,006
The entrance of the restaurant is this way.

710
00:24:41,007 --> 00:24:43,207
Oh, this way? By the way, aren't you cold?

711
00:24:43,707 --> 00:24:45,406
What? He seems a little bit eccentric.

712
00:24:45,407 --> 00:24:46,637
Look at his beard.

713
00:24:46,977 --> 00:24:49,707
- Your beard looks amazing, sir.
- His beard looks so great, indeed.

714
00:24:50,007 --> 00:24:52,616
- He looks like Hercule Poirot.
- I heard...

715
00:24:52,617 --> 00:24:54,646
that people called you Almighty Yu.

716
00:24:54,647 --> 00:24:56,116
- That's true.
- My name is Yu Jae Seok.

717
00:24:56,117 --> 00:24:57,446
- I see.
- Yes.

718
00:24:57,447 --> 00:24:59,856
- Right. His name...
- Hello. I'm Jeon So Min.

719
00:24:59,857 --> 00:25:01,826
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my. Hello.

720
00:25:01,827 --> 00:25:03,486
- My goodness.
- Hello. It's nice to meet you.

721
00:25:03,487 --> 00:25:05,696
- I don't think you know our names.
- You don't know us, do you?

722
00:25:05,697 --> 00:25:06,697
- Please be honest with us.
- Of course, I know.

723
00:25:07,327 --> 00:25:08,596
- Mr. Yu Jae Seok.
- Correct.

724
00:25:08,597 --> 00:25:10,467
- Ms. Song Eun I.
- Oh, you know my name.

725
00:25:11,397 --> 00:25:14,636
- He knows the 2 oldest members.
- I don't know stars in their 30s.

726
00:25:14,637 --> 00:25:16,166
- Stars in their 30s? All right.
- I don't know any young stars.

727
00:25:16,167 --> 00:25:18,606
- He knows no stars in their 30s.
- Sir, we'll go up for now.

728
00:25:18,607 --> 00:25:19,707
- I only know older stars than that.
- I see.

729
00:25:19,877 --> 00:25:21,907
- Bless you, sir.
- Thank you.

730
00:25:22,447 --> 00:25:24,776
- This character must be the owner.
- I see the resemblance.

731
00:25:24,777 --> 00:25:26,446
- Oh, I see the resemblance.
- Oh, you're right.

732
00:25:26,447 --> 00:25:27,687
- You're right.
- It looks just like him.

733
00:25:28,387 --> 00:25:31,086
- This building...
- I don't think he built this alone.

734
00:25:31,087 --> 00:25:32,316
- There's no way he did.
- Right, this is...

735
00:25:32,317 --> 00:25:33,416
- Right?
- There's no way.

736
00:25:33,417 --> 00:25:36,526
So does it mean someone runs this huge place all by himself?

737
00:25:36,527 --> 00:25:37,527
- That's not possible.
- Is that it?

738
00:25:37,528 --> 00:25:39,327
But is it possible?

739
00:25:40,697 --> 00:25:42,997
- "Lucky Turtle Rock?" - That must be the entrance.

740
00:25:43,267 --> 00:25:44,496
"Touch the nose..."

741
00:25:44,497 --> 00:25:45,836
- "and make a wish." - Where is the nose?

742
00:25:45,837 --> 00:25:46,837
(Restaurant Entrance)

743
00:25:47,437 --> 00:25:51,307
(Walk up the long line of stairs that starts at the entrance.)

744
00:25:52,777 --> 00:25:54,976
(Then you'll see a unique, eye-catching rock.)

745
00:25:54,977 --> 00:25:56,107
(Lucky Turtle Rock, Touch the nose and make a wish.)

746
00:25:57,577 --> 00:25:58,746
- Is this the nose?
- I see.

747
00:25:58,747 --> 00:25:59,747
(This is the nose!)

748
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:01,317
Please help me make a lot of money.

749
00:26:02,087 --> 00:26:03,286
Make a wish.

750
00:26:03,287 --> 00:26:06,457
- Help me live a long, healthy life.
- "A long, healthy life?"

751
00:26:06,917 --> 00:26:08,426
Why are you touching his nose?

752
00:26:08,427 --> 00:26:09,427
(She touches Kyoung Pyo's nose instead of the turtle's nose.)

753
00:26:09,527 --> 00:26:11,457
- Jae Seok, you have a wish too?
- I'll make a wish...

754
00:26:11,557 --> 00:26:13,156
- Of course, he has a wish.
- Oh, my.

755
00:26:13,157 --> 00:26:16,096
- But he has everything.
- Good health for his family.

756
00:26:16,097 --> 00:26:17,626
- That's right.
- Love and health for your family?

757
00:26:17,627 --> 00:26:19,067
- Yes, love and good health.
- That's exactly what I wish for.

758
00:26:19,437 --> 00:26:21,136
- Please help us succeed today.
- Help us guess the right one...

759
00:26:21,137 --> 00:26:23,067
- and win a coffee truck.
- Help us succeed. Exactly.

760
00:26:23,107 --> 00:26:24,977
(After making a wish, they go up.)

761
00:26:25,407 --> 00:26:27,377
(Amazed)

762
00:26:28,347 --> 00:26:30,676
(Right above the Lucky Turtle Rock...)

763
00:26:30,677 --> 00:26:32,476
I didn't expect to see a place like this.

764
00:26:32,477 --> 00:26:34,516
- Oh, my. What is this?
- These are crocks.

765
00:26:34,517 --> 00:26:35,816
There are crocks here?

766
00:26:35,817 --> 00:26:37,247
This place is so interesting.

767
00:26:37,487 --> 00:26:39,416
- My, this is...
- This place must be real.

768
00:26:39,417 --> 00:26:41,086
- How does he do everything alone?
- But the point is...

769
00:26:41,087 --> 00:26:43,256
- that he does everything alone.
- That's what we should figure out.

770
00:26:43,257 --> 00:26:45,826
- It must be a lot of... Right.
- It must be a lot of work.

771
00:26:45,827 --> 00:26:46,996
- I don't think he can do it alone.
- It's not one man's work.

772
00:26:46,997 --> 00:26:48,496
Right. It's a lot of work.

773
00:26:48,497 --> 00:26:50,067
It's not possible.

774
00:26:50,267 --> 00:26:51,337
- It must be impossible.
- My gosh.

775
00:26:51,767 --> 00:26:53,197
- This is really interesting.
- It can't be possible.

776
00:26:53,667 --> 00:26:55,667
- This place must be famous.
- Indeed.

777
00:26:56,207 --> 00:26:57,906
The restaurant itself is plausible.

778
00:26:57,907 --> 00:26:59,737
I'm sure it's a real restaurant.

779
00:26:59,907 --> 00:27:01,876
- The place is very large.
- It's huge.

780
00:27:01,877 --> 00:27:03,306
It's impossible for one person to do all the work here alone.

781
00:27:03,307 --> 00:27:08,586
(There's even a campfire area next to the crocks.)

782
00:27:08,587 --> 00:27:10,647
- You can't do this alone.
- Right. It's hard to do it alone.

783
00:27:10,947 --> 00:27:11,957
You see...

784
00:27:12,217 --> 00:27:13,416
This is tons of work.

785
00:27:13,417 --> 00:27:14,626
- Of course.
- Absolutely.

786
00:27:14,627 --> 00:27:16,086
- I mean, this is...
- Right.

787
00:27:16,087 --> 00:27:18,356
- Perhaps, unlike how it seems...
- Is the owner perhaps...

788
00:27:18,357 --> 00:27:19,997
one of four identical twins?

789
00:27:20,457 --> 00:27:21,797
- Look at the back.
- "Four identical twins?"

790
00:27:21,867 --> 00:27:24,737
It's called "identical quadruplets," not "four identical twins."

791
00:27:26,237 --> 00:27:27,237
"Four identical twins?"

792
00:27:27,238 --> 00:27:28,836
What's "identical quadruplets?"

793
00:27:28,837 --> 00:27:31,136
- I'm embarrassed.
- Here's another person like Mimi.

794
00:27:31,137 --> 00:27:32,506
- Mimi, be nice to her.
- It's not that I know a lot.

795
00:27:32,507 --> 00:27:33,536
She's like your soul sister.

796
00:27:33,537 --> 00:27:35,106
She's your senior blunt member.

797
00:27:35,107 --> 00:27:36,677
- You must be proud of her.
- Big sis!

798
00:27:37,847 --> 00:27:40,076
- It has a nice view.
- Indeed.

799
00:27:40,077 --> 00:27:41,147
My, this place is so nice.

800
00:27:41,517 --> 00:27:43,086
- This is amazing.
- Awesome.

801
00:27:43,087 --> 00:27:44,346
It has a lot of rooms.

802
00:27:44,347 --> 00:27:46,916
- You can see it all from here.
- This place is nice.

803
00:27:46,917 --> 00:27:48,426
- My gosh. This is magnificent.
- The view is amazing.

804
00:27:48,427 --> 00:27:50,056
- It's really nice here.
- Amazing.

805
00:27:50,057 --> 00:27:51,727
- I can see the whole town.
- It's so nice here.

806
00:27:52,297 --> 00:27:54,767
(If you walk toward the terrace...)

807
00:27:56,267 --> 00:27:57,597
Look at the view.

808
00:27:58,297 --> 00:27:59,467
This is magnificent.

809
00:28:00,437 --> 00:28:02,237
We should take a picture here.

810
00:28:02,507 --> 00:28:03,936
Indeed. We should take a picture.

811
00:28:03,937 --> 00:28:05,077
- I'm so amazed.
- Gather around.

812
00:28:05,277 --> 00:28:06,807
- Look at the view.
- Let me join you guys.

813
00:28:07,337 --> 00:28:08,576
- So Min.
- Yes.

814
00:28:08,577 --> 00:28:09,846
- So Min.
- Here.

815
00:28:09,847 --> 00:28:11,317
Let's go. One, two.

816
00:28:11,777 --> 00:28:13,916
- It came out great.
- Oh, it's pretty.

817
00:28:13,917 --> 00:28:16,087
- The picture came out great.
- It came out so great.

818
00:28:16,317 --> 00:28:17,486
Nice.

819
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:18,886
- Nice.
- This place is so beautiful.

820
00:28:18,887 --> 00:28:20,456
- It's incredible.
- It's beautiful.

821
00:28:20,457 --> 00:28:21,727
(It's time to go inside to find the fake place.)

822
00:28:22,087 --> 00:28:23,327
Oh, my. Look at this.

823
00:28:24,997 --> 00:28:27,257
- The view is amazing.
- How beautiful.

824
00:28:28,067 --> 00:28:30,967
(When you go inside of the place after appreciating the view...)

825
00:28:31,737 --> 00:28:34,637
(You'll see a great number of tables that fit the building size.)

826
00:28:35,007 --> 00:28:37,607
(Behind the glass walls is a beautiful mountain.)

827
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:40,937
(There are brick walls that give off a cozy vibe and camping chairs.)

828
00:28:41,707 --> 00:28:45,547
(It's filled with a restful mood as if you were camping outside.)

829
00:28:46,417 --> 00:28:48,747
- I see camping chairs everywhere.
- Have a seat.

830
00:28:49,117 --> 00:28:50,486
The chair has wheels.

831
00:28:50,487 --> 00:28:51,916
- Right.
- Oh, you're right.

832
00:28:51,917 --> 00:28:53,486
- This is nice.
- My, this place...

833
00:28:53,487 --> 00:28:54,516
So Min, come and sit here.

834
00:28:54,517 --> 00:28:56,387
- What a brilliant idea.
- Indeed.

835
00:28:56,727 --> 00:28:58,396
- But...
- This is a really brilliant idea.

836
00:28:58,397 --> 00:29:00,056
But guys, have a look.

837
00:29:00,057 --> 00:29:01,967
- Right?
- Isn't the table a little bit low?

838
00:29:02,267 --> 00:29:03,566
- It's very low. It's uncomfortable.
- Yes.

839
00:29:03,567 --> 00:29:04,567
It's okay for me.

840
00:29:04,568 --> 00:29:06,066
- But I think it's too low for you.
- It is, indeed.

841
00:29:06,067 --> 00:29:08,236
Whereas it's a good chair to lean back,

842
00:29:08,237 --> 00:29:09,806
- it's uncomfortable to eat in it.
- It's hard to eat in it.

843
00:29:09,807 --> 00:29:11,476
- Because you have to lean forward?
- This is for camping.

844
00:29:11,477 --> 00:29:13,276
- People mostly lean back like this.
- That's right.

845
00:29:13,277 --> 00:29:15,176
And the table is too low for men to put their legs under it.

846
00:29:15,177 --> 00:29:16,506
- Right. That's true.
- I can't put my legs under it.

847
00:29:16,507 --> 00:29:17,917
We have to stay away from the table.

848
00:29:18,717 --> 00:29:20,916
(There's something suspicious about the camping-themed tables?)

849
00:29:20,917 --> 00:29:24,047
- One person can't run this alone.
- It's impossible.

850
00:29:24,317 --> 00:29:27,216
I mean, there are tens of tables here to begin with.

851
00:29:27,217 --> 00:29:28,227
It's not possible.

852
00:29:28,987 --> 00:29:29,987
It's impossible...

853
00:29:29,988 --> 00:29:32,256
unless it's run by "four identical twins."

854
00:29:32,257 --> 00:29:34,667
- It can't be run otherwise.
- Unless it's run by quadruplets.

855
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:37,597
But if you look at the reception counter...

856
00:29:37,697 --> 00:29:39,167
(The reception counter?)

857
00:29:39,267 --> 00:29:41,736
- It's built with bricks.
- Yes.

858
00:29:41,737 --> 00:29:42,966
(The reception counter is built with bricks.)

859
00:29:42,967 --> 00:29:45,376
(Uneven)

860
00:29:45,377 --> 00:29:47,176
Also, if you look at that table,

861
00:29:47,177 --> 00:29:49,076
- it's welded roughly.
- Right.

862
00:29:49,077 --> 00:29:51,716
They don't look like they're made by an expert,

863
00:29:51,717 --> 00:29:54,046
- Right. It looks a little...
- but by the owner himself.

864
00:29:54,047 --> 00:29:56,987
- It's not executed thoroughly.
- Right.

865
00:29:57,447 --> 00:29:58,787
And there's electrical wiring too.

866
00:29:58,987 --> 00:30:01,326
Any men who served in the military can do it, actually.

867
00:30:01,327 --> 00:30:03,156
- Can you do it too?
- Of course, I can.

868
00:30:03,157 --> 00:30:04,526
You can build a building?

869
00:30:04,527 --> 00:30:06,396
Of course. I can do it easily.

870
00:30:06,397 --> 00:30:07,627
I can do it easily.

871
00:30:08,197 --> 00:30:10,096
Why would you bluff like that? You weren't like this before.

872
00:30:10,097 --> 00:30:12,566
- Hey, I served in the military.
- But...

873
00:30:12,567 --> 00:30:15,336
- He wasn't like this before.
- He wasn't like this...

874
00:30:15,337 --> 00:30:17,806
- when we four were alone together.
- Why would you act so tough?

875
00:30:17,807 --> 00:30:20,107
It's easy for men who served in the military. I could...

876
00:30:20,407 --> 00:30:21,906
I mean, I could...

877
00:30:21,907 --> 00:30:23,146
- Two hours would be enough for me.
- His face turned red.

878
00:30:23,147 --> 00:30:24,506
- Two hours would be enough.
- Your face turned red.

879
00:30:24,507 --> 00:30:26,076
His face turned red.

880
00:30:26,077 --> 00:30:27,577
(Burning)

881
00:30:27,847 --> 00:30:29,817
(He's so cute.)

882
00:30:30,217 --> 00:30:31,517
But doing all this alone...

883
00:30:31,957 --> 00:30:32,957
All alone?

884
00:30:33,517 --> 00:30:35,926
It's possible that this restaurant is real,

885
00:30:35,927 --> 00:30:38,096
- but did he build this alone?
- Exactly.

886
00:30:38,097 --> 00:30:39,526
- Is the owner's story real?
- We should figure it out.

887
00:30:39,527 --> 00:30:41,156
Whether or not his story is real.

888
00:30:41,157 --> 00:30:42,897
- Oh, he's here. Hello.
- Hello.

889
00:30:43,797 --> 00:30:45,596
- Oh, hello, sir.
- Are you the same person?

890
00:30:45,597 --> 00:30:48,107
The one we met earlier, the second oldest quadruplet.

891
00:30:48,407 --> 00:30:49,407
That's correct.

892
00:30:49,507 --> 00:30:50,837
Sir, how much...

893
00:30:51,167 --> 00:30:53,206
How much of the work here do you do by yourself?

894
00:30:53,207 --> 00:30:54,576
Well... Everything.

895
00:30:54,577 --> 00:30:55,906
Everything you can see here.

896
00:30:55,907 --> 00:30:58,217
From the stairs that you stepped on.

897
00:30:58,577 --> 00:30:59,946
- Everything from the parking lot.
- Yes.

898
00:30:59,947 --> 00:31:01,486
I made everything all by myself.

899
00:31:01,487 --> 00:31:02,987
- You made all this?
- I made this table too.

900
00:31:03,387 --> 00:31:04,916
You even made the tables too?

901
00:31:04,917 --> 00:31:07,216
- You built this building?
- All by yourself?

902
00:31:07,217 --> 00:31:08,227
That's right.

903
00:31:09,887 --> 00:31:12,197
I built and made everything all by myself.

904
00:31:13,327 --> 00:31:15,327
The total area of the lot is about 6,611m².

905
00:31:15,997 --> 00:31:17,026
(Seoul World Cup Stadium's grass field size: 7,137m²)

906
00:31:17,027 --> 00:31:18,066
(The total area of the lot: Approximately 6,611m²)

907
00:31:18,067 --> 00:31:20,167
(It's as large as a soccer field.)

908
00:31:20,267 --> 00:31:22,536
I built the frame of this building by myself.

909
00:31:22,537 --> 00:31:24,407
I built all the parts of the frame.

910
00:31:24,877 --> 00:31:26,106
I also did the painting work by myself.

911
00:31:26,107 --> 00:31:27,406
I made all these tables too.

912
00:31:27,407 --> 00:31:29,977
(Building the frame, painting, making the furniture, welding)

913
00:31:30,147 --> 00:31:33,516
I drilled a hole in crocks to make them into cookers.

914
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:36,186
I even chopped the firewood by myself.

915
00:31:36,187 --> 00:31:37,686
(From A to Z)

916
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:41,287
I put these on the ground, made this fire pit, and everything.

917
00:31:41,527 --> 00:31:42,527
Everything you can see here.

918
00:31:42,727 --> 00:31:44,186
It takes a whole day...

919
00:31:44,187 --> 00:31:45,627
for one person to build a fire pit like this.

920
00:31:45,857 --> 00:31:49,197
The construction of the building began in 2007.

921
00:31:49,367 --> 00:31:52,537
(Since it's 2025 now, it's been almost 20 years.)

922
00:31:52,637 --> 00:31:54,937
But it's still a bit incomplete.

923
00:31:55,767 --> 00:31:58,936
I wanted people to feel as if they were in Europe...

924
00:31:58,937 --> 00:32:01,577
back in the medieval period.

925
00:32:02,007 --> 00:32:04,446
In order to build a beautiful brick arch wall,

926
00:32:04,447 --> 00:32:05,647
you need to calculate the ratio accurately.

927
00:32:06,117 --> 00:32:07,717
I built those brick arches by myself as well.

928
00:32:08,887 --> 00:32:10,987
(Thanks to its original vibes, on social media...)

929
00:32:11,717 --> 00:32:13,587
(It's already number 1 trendy place in Yangpyeong.)

930
00:32:13,657 --> 00:32:16,787
On a weekend, we have between 500 and 600 customers.

931
00:32:17,057 --> 00:32:18,696
Of course, we have a waitlist.

932
00:32:18,697 --> 00:32:20,026
Usually, there are 50 to 60 tables on the waitlist.

933
00:32:20,027 --> 00:32:22,126
Customers have to wait for between 3 and 4 hours.

934
00:32:22,127 --> 00:32:24,597
The usual sales on a weekend is over 10,000 dollars.

935
00:32:24,867 --> 00:32:28,207
The sales of January was 208,000 or 209,000 dollars.

936
00:32:28,707 --> 00:32:31,207
(And the special dish served only at this restaurant)

937
00:32:31,337 --> 00:32:33,707
(What could be the best-selling dish of this restaurant?)

938
00:32:33,977 --> 00:32:37,177
Sixth Sense members, am I real?

939
00:32:39,047 --> 00:32:40,516
Are you saying that you built this large building...

940
00:32:40,517 --> 00:32:42,017
- all by yourself?
- Yes, I built it by myself.

941
00:32:42,247 --> 00:32:43,587
I worked on construction sites for 30 years.

942
00:32:44,187 --> 00:32:46,386
I worked in construction for 30 years, so I know a lot.

943
00:32:46,387 --> 00:32:47,456
(Impressed)

944
00:32:47,457 --> 00:32:50,256
I worked as an engineer in Iraq for one year...

945
00:32:50,257 --> 00:32:53,426
- in 1980 and earned US dollars.
- I see.

946
00:32:53,427 --> 00:32:55,426
(Intrigued)

947
00:32:55,427 --> 00:32:57,567
Since I'd learned a lot in Iraq on top of what I already knew,

948
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,367
I decided to build this on my own.

949
00:32:59,967 --> 00:33:02,466
What about the adjacent building over there?

950
00:33:02,467 --> 00:33:03,806
I've been building that one too.

951
00:33:03,807 --> 00:33:05,837
- Oh, you're building that too?
- Yes.

952
00:33:05,907 --> 00:33:08,376
(The owner is building this building by himself.)

953
00:33:08,377 --> 00:33:11,516
I got help from some friends with building the frame,

954
00:33:11,517 --> 00:33:13,347
- and I did all the rest by myself.
- I see.

955
00:33:13,877 --> 00:33:16,086
Did you make these chairs as well?

956
00:33:16,087 --> 00:33:17,746
- I attached those wheels. Yes.
- You modified these chairs too?

957
00:33:17,747 --> 00:33:20,217
- You had to do the welding too.
- Of course.

958
00:33:20,517 --> 00:33:21,827
- Did you do it by yourself?
- Yes, I did.

959
00:33:22,127 --> 00:33:24,286
Didn't you see the chandelier over there?

960
00:33:24,287 --> 00:33:25,997
- Oh, the chandelier?
- Yes, we saw that.

961
00:33:26,527 --> 00:33:28,026
- I saw the chandelier.
- Chandelier

962
00:33:28,027 --> 00:33:29,496
The chandelier.

963
00:33:29,497 --> 00:33:31,366
(The chandelier is also designed and made by the owner.)

964
00:33:31,367 --> 00:33:33,397
But why did you do all this alone?

965
00:33:33,737 --> 00:33:36,307
- I mean, it's a large building.
- Indeed.

966
00:33:36,607 --> 00:33:38,407
That's because I didn't have enough money.

967
00:33:39,007 --> 00:33:40,477
Oh, I see.

968
00:33:41,107 --> 00:33:42,847
(Realizing)

969
00:33:43,347 --> 00:33:44,347
(Solemn)

970
00:33:44,348 --> 00:33:45,947
We all became solemn.

971
00:33:46,047 --> 00:33:48,076
- It's a very...
- Don't be solemn on a variety show.

972
00:33:48,077 --> 00:33:49,316
It's a very simple reason.

973
00:33:49,317 --> 00:33:51,556
(It's a very simple reason.)

974
00:33:51,557 --> 00:33:53,187
How long has it been since you opened this place?

975
00:33:53,817 --> 00:33:55,686
- It was originally a guest house.
- I see.

976
00:33:55,687 --> 00:33:57,386
Including that, it's been ten years.

977
00:33:57,387 --> 00:33:58,627
(Including the guest house, it's been 10 years.)

978
00:33:58,697 --> 00:34:00,827
(It was a guest house before?)

979
00:34:01,357 --> 00:34:04,397
(He used to run a guest house in this building.)

980
00:34:04,767 --> 00:34:07,897
(Then he changed it to a camping-themed restaurant?)

981
00:34:08,367 --> 00:34:11,406
(Could this place be real?)

982
00:34:11,407 --> 00:34:14,407
Since this place is famous,

983
00:34:14,577 --> 00:34:16,406
- the food must be good.
- Right.

984
00:34:16,407 --> 00:34:17,407
Shall we order some food?

985
00:34:17,408 --> 00:34:20,117
We have only one dish on the menu, which is barbecue.

986
00:34:20,477 --> 00:34:21,816
- Oh, barbecue.
- Barbecue?

987
00:34:21,817 --> 00:34:25,356
- But the way of cooking is unique.
- I see.

988
00:34:25,357 --> 00:34:29,327
In Texas, the US, they cook for ten hours... You must know well.

989
00:34:29,927 --> 00:34:30,987
I've never been to Texas.

990
00:34:32,257 --> 00:34:33,257
I don't know much about it.

991
00:34:34,527 --> 00:34:36,096
(Oh, I thought wrong!)

992
00:34:36,097 --> 00:34:37,667
- He doesn't have the Texas vibe.
- I've never been to...

993
00:34:38,067 --> 00:34:40,166
Texas... Has any of you...

994
00:34:40,167 --> 00:34:42,667
None of us looks like we've been to Texas.

995
00:34:42,737 --> 00:34:44,536
- I thought you knew their style.
- He turned his head around.

996
00:34:44,537 --> 00:34:46,436
(Ignoring Jae Seok)

997
00:34:46,437 --> 00:34:47,776
- I mean...
- Because he has no Texas vibes.

998
00:34:47,777 --> 00:34:50,306
- He realized it and turned around.
- He obviously has no Texas vibes.

999
00:34:50,307 --> 00:34:51,817
- He can't speak to Jae Seok.
- So he turned around.

1000
00:34:51,917 --> 00:34:53,476
- Texas vibes...
- He turned around right away.

1001
00:34:53,477 --> 00:34:55,387
- They have the Texas vibes.
- Yes, we do.

1002
00:34:55,717 --> 00:34:58,016
- Can we taste your food?
- Right.

1003
00:34:58,017 --> 00:34:59,417
- Of course. Please try it.
- Can we...

1004
00:34:59,957 --> 00:35:02,326
(How could the crock barbecue cooked in a crock look?)

1005
00:35:02,327 --> 00:35:03,357
But this is...

1006
00:35:03,387 --> 00:35:05,496
- Doing everything by himself...
- Right?

1007
00:35:05,497 --> 00:35:08,596
But he didn't seem like he was acting.

1008
00:35:08,597 --> 00:35:09,997
- He doesn't look like an actor.
- He seemed authentic.

1009
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:14,267
- But I have a reasonable doubt.
- He worked on construction sites.

1010
00:35:14,667 --> 00:35:17,037
(The original Sixth Sense member has a reasonable doubt?)

1011
00:35:17,537 --> 00:35:19,107
He thought I was in my 30s.

1012
00:35:20,137 --> 00:35:21,976
Can't you stop thinking about it?

1013
00:35:21,977 --> 00:35:23,176
- Yes, it's lingering in my mind.
- That comment he made?

1014
00:35:23,177 --> 00:35:25,446
So do you think this place is real or fake?

1015
00:35:25,447 --> 00:35:26,577
I hope it's real.

1016
00:35:28,687 --> 00:35:30,917
You two really came here to get your youth back.

1017
00:35:31,857 --> 00:35:33,816
Please give me silica gel as a side dish.

1018
00:35:33,817 --> 00:35:34,817
(Please give me a preservative as a side dish.)

1019
00:35:35,457 --> 00:35:36,687
"As a side dish?"

1020
00:35:38,497 --> 00:35:40,227
Oh, my. Our food is coming. Look.

1021
00:35:40,557 --> 00:35:42,166
- Oh, my. Our food is coming. Look.
- Here's your crock barbecue.

1022
00:35:42,167 --> 00:35:44,527
- He brought a whole crock in here.
- It's literally crock barbecue.

1023
00:35:45,037 --> 00:35:46,166
This is awesome.

1024
00:35:46,167 --> 00:35:48,097
(A real crock is here!)

1025
00:35:48,707 --> 00:35:50,407
(The food will be revealed now.)

1026
00:35:50,707 --> 00:35:52,437
My gosh. He brought an actual crock in here.

1027
00:35:53,077 --> 00:35:55,777
(And finally, the food will appear.)

1028
00:35:56,207 --> 00:35:57,947
(Excited to the max)

1029
00:35:58,077 --> 00:36:00,176
(Exclaiming in amazement)

1030
00:36:00,177 --> 00:36:01,716
- My, this is incredible.
- This is...

1031
00:36:01,717 --> 00:36:03,686
- It looks so tasty.
- It looks really good.

1032
00:36:03,687 --> 00:36:04,917
It's cooked so nicely.

1033
00:36:05,487 --> 00:36:07,617
(A sensational dish, Yangpyeong crock barbecue)

1034
00:36:07,687 --> 00:36:09,927
I use good quality wood charcoal, good quality meat,

1035
00:36:10,257 --> 00:36:11,526
and good quality crocks.

1036
00:36:11,527 --> 00:36:13,497
Those are all I need to make a tasty meat dish.

1037
00:36:13,957 --> 00:36:15,196
(He prepares good quality, fresh Korean pork ribs.)

1038
00:36:15,197 --> 00:36:17,497
It takes between 6 and 7 hours...

1039
00:36:17,927 --> 00:36:21,266
to cut meat into a proper size.

1040
00:36:21,267 --> 00:36:23,667
(He cuts the meat into the right size to be served.)

1041
00:36:23,867 --> 00:36:26,036
The most important element is the crock to cook the meat.

1042
00:36:26,037 --> 00:36:27,907
I put burning wood charcoal in a crock.

1043
00:36:28,977 --> 00:36:31,207
I put meat on a hook.

1044
00:36:32,647 --> 00:36:33,976
Then I hang it in the crock.

1045
00:36:33,977 --> 00:36:37,617
(He hangs the meat in the crock.)

1046
00:36:37,687 --> 00:36:41,216
Usually, people season the meat before cooking it,

1047
00:36:41,217 --> 00:36:43,587
like salting it, for example.

1048
00:36:43,987 --> 00:36:45,757
But I don't do that.

1049
00:36:46,027 --> 00:36:47,457
The original flavor of meat is good enough.

1050
00:36:47,527 --> 00:36:49,567
That's all I need to make a good meat dish.

1051
00:36:50,027 --> 00:36:51,597
There's no need to add anything to it.

1052
00:36:53,367 --> 00:36:57,267
(The barbecue made only by smoking with Yangpyeong wood charcoal)

1053
00:36:57,907 --> 00:36:58,907
(The 1st smoking time is between 90 and 120 minutes.)

1054
00:36:58,908 --> 00:37:01,207
After smoking meat for about two hours...

1055
00:37:02,677 --> 00:37:05,477
- The crocks are in an oval shape.
- Yes.

1056
00:37:05,917 --> 00:37:08,246
Therefore, when the lid is closed,

1057
00:37:08,247 --> 00:37:09,817
the heat circulates inside the crock.

1058
00:37:10,617 --> 00:37:13,256
That's how I make smoked barbecue...

1059
00:37:13,257 --> 00:37:15,486
with a strong aroma of oak.

1060
00:37:15,487 --> 00:37:17,557
(After a long time and a lot of effort...)

1061
00:37:17,687 --> 00:37:19,426
When the meat is smoked,

1062
00:37:19,427 --> 00:37:21,257
I take the meat out of the crock.

1063
00:37:22,427 --> 00:37:25,866
I rest the meat, which means I let it cool down for a while.

1064
00:37:25,867 --> 00:37:28,536
(Through the resting process, which is to let meat cool down...)

1065
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:31,807
Resting meat makes it juicier.

1066
00:37:33,237 --> 00:37:36,076
Also, since the grease is removed, it's light, clean, and savory.

1067
00:37:36,077 --> 00:37:38,477
(With the grease removed, it's lighter, cleaner, and savorier.)

1068
00:37:39,117 --> 00:37:41,117
Now, it's ready to be served.

1069
00:37:41,377 --> 00:37:45,057
(Shall we try the crock barbecue now?)

1070
00:37:46,617 --> 00:37:49,086
(Cheering)

1071
00:37:49,087 --> 00:37:50,556
- My, this is incredible.
- This is...

1072
00:37:50,557 --> 00:37:52,456
- It looks so tasty.
- It looks great.

1073
00:37:52,457 --> 00:37:53,797
It's cooked so nicely.

1074
00:37:54,527 --> 00:37:55,767
Oh, holy moly.

1075
00:37:57,367 --> 00:37:59,736
Hold it with the tongs like this.

1076
00:37:59,737 --> 00:38:00,737
(Remove meat from the bone first.)

1077
00:38:01,767 --> 00:38:03,066
It looks so amazing.

1078
00:38:03,067 --> 00:38:05,277
- It's already been smoked.
- Yes.

1079
00:38:05,737 --> 00:38:07,907
My, it looks so tasty. And it won't make me fat.

1080
00:38:08,007 --> 00:38:09,806
I guess he'll cook the meat a little more...

1081
00:38:09,807 --> 00:38:10,877
- on this stone grill pan.
- That's right.

1082
00:38:11,407 --> 00:38:12,717
And the meat...

1083
00:38:13,577 --> 00:38:15,117
- It's tender.
- Is it tender?

1084
00:38:16,547 --> 00:38:18,916
- Look. It falls off the bone.
- That's amazing.

1085
00:38:18,917 --> 00:38:20,017
My, it looks good.

1086
00:38:20,687 --> 00:38:22,527
You know how tender meat is when you cut it.

1087
00:38:23,027 --> 00:38:24,486
- Right.
- It's really tender.

1088
00:38:24,487 --> 00:38:25,497
(The meat is cut at a slight touch of scissors.)

1089
00:38:26,227 --> 00:38:27,627
- Does it feel good to cut the meat?
- Yes.

1090
00:38:28,057 --> 00:38:29,697
- It looks really good.
- There are shrimps too.

1091
00:38:30,297 --> 00:38:32,297
(Cook the smoked meat on a stone grill pan for a bit.)

1092
00:38:33,297 --> 00:38:36,737
(The meat becomes juicy and glossy.)

1093
00:38:37,567 --> 00:38:40,377
(It's being cooked to golden brown.)

1094
00:38:40,877 --> 00:38:42,846
(From minari...)

1095
00:38:42,847 --> 00:38:44,507
(to pineapple, onion, mushroom, and shishito pepper)

1096
00:38:45,517 --> 00:38:47,677
(Add some other ingredients to have as a side dish.)

1097
00:38:49,547 --> 00:38:51,617
- Shall we eat now?
- Thank you for the food.

1098
00:38:52,017 --> 00:38:53,887
- Let's dig in.
- Thank you for the food.

1099
00:38:54,857 --> 00:38:56,127
(Focused)

1100
00:38:56,957 --> 00:38:58,697
(He picks up only a piece of meat for now.)

1101
00:38:58,997 --> 00:39:00,027
- I'm trying to fill this part.
- Okay.

1102
00:39:00,997 --> 00:39:01,997
It smells so good.

1103
00:39:03,797 --> 00:39:05,297
- The piece with some fat...
- I'll try one without fat.

1104
00:39:05,337 --> 00:39:06,937
It's very clean and tender.

1105
00:39:06,997 --> 00:39:08,266
- Is it?
- Yes.

1106
00:39:08,267 --> 00:39:09,666
- Salt.
- Oh, no.

1107
00:39:09,667 --> 00:39:11,337
(Then I should try it.)

1108
00:39:11,977 --> 00:39:13,007
It's good.

1109
00:39:13,477 --> 00:39:14,477
(Amazed)

1110
00:39:15,347 --> 00:39:16,847
It's incredibly tender.

1111
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:19,046
- It melts in my mouth.
- Is it different from this?

1112
00:39:19,047 --> 00:39:21,246
(The tasty barbecue with chewy skin and a tender texture)

1113
00:39:21,247 --> 00:39:22,247
This is crazy good.

1114
00:39:23,317 --> 00:39:24,786
I'll make a vegetable wrap with it...

1115
00:39:24,787 --> 00:39:26,017
- It goes well with vegetables.
- since I'm here.

1116
00:39:26,117 --> 00:39:28,016
A vegetable wrap with the meat is good. It goes well with vegetables.

1117
00:39:28,017 --> 00:39:29,156
(Add some side dishes to the meat.)

1118
00:39:29,157 --> 00:39:30,427
- It's not greasy. It's tasty.
- Indeed.

1119
00:39:30,587 --> 00:39:31,687
It's so light and clean.

1120
00:39:32,597 --> 00:39:33,627
(Impressed)

1121
00:39:34,927 --> 00:39:37,067
It goes well with vegetables. A vegetable wrap with it is good.

1122
00:39:37,727 --> 00:39:40,337
They say in a situation like this, "Halli Galli, guacamole."

1123
00:39:40,667 --> 00:39:42,866
- It's "Holy moly, guacamole." - It's "Holy moly."

1124
00:39:42,867 --> 00:39:43,936
- Halli Galli is a game.
- Isn't it "Halli Galli?"

1125
00:39:43,937 --> 00:39:45,837
Halli Galli, guacamole.

1126
00:39:46,677 --> 00:39:48,207
She made another term following "four identical twins."

1127
00:39:49,547 --> 00:39:52,546
- So Min makes a lot of puns.
- You have a great sense of humor.

1128
00:39:52,547 --> 00:39:53,647
She claims to be young.

1129
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:55,486
- I know...
- I want to be young again.

1130
00:39:55,487 --> 00:39:56,646
I know what that feels like.

1131
00:39:56,647 --> 00:39:57,647
- I'm going to become trendy.
- Right.

1132
00:39:58,957 --> 00:39:59,957
(Exclaiming in amazement)

1133
00:40:00,557 --> 00:40:02,356
- The smoky flavor...
- Yes.

1134
00:40:02,357 --> 00:40:04,586
- and the aroma of oak...
- The smoky aroma is amazing.

1135
00:40:04,587 --> 00:40:05,957
soaked in the meat.

1136
00:40:07,227 --> 00:40:11,997
(It's smoked in a crock for over 2 hours.)

1137
00:40:12,067 --> 00:40:13,537
As it was heated,

1138
00:40:13,567 --> 00:40:14,696
the meat became more tender.

1139
00:40:14,697 --> 00:40:15,936
- Right?
- Yes.

1140
00:40:15,937 --> 00:40:17,036
It definitely makes a difference.

1141
00:40:17,037 --> 00:40:19,077
(It's so tasty that even Na Ra, who has a poor appetite, gnaws on it.)

1142
00:40:20,177 --> 00:40:21,237
It's so good.

1143
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:23,076
It's even tastier after being grilled.

1144
00:40:23,077 --> 00:40:24,447
(So Min starts making a vegetable wrap too.)

1145
00:40:24,507 --> 00:40:26,547
(She makes a nice vegetable wrap.)

1146
00:40:29,017 --> 00:40:30,187
Have a vegetable wrap, Jae Seok.

1147
00:40:30,847 --> 00:40:33,016
- So Min made me a vegetable wrap.
- Really?

1148
00:40:33,017 --> 00:40:34,487
- Yes.
- Then you should eat it.

1149
00:40:34,957 --> 00:40:36,326
(Putting it all in his mouth)

1150
00:40:36,327 --> 00:40:37,387
Now, it's...

1151
00:40:38,087 --> 00:40:39,257
It's good.

1152
00:40:39,727 --> 00:40:40,897
- As the heat rises, - Yes.

1153
00:40:41,997 --> 00:40:43,097
the meat was cooked...

1154
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,597
So Min, thank you for the vegetable wrap, but come to think of it...

1155
00:40:46,967 --> 00:40:48,297
- Did you wash your hands?
- No, I didn't.

1156
00:40:49,107 --> 00:40:50,907
(Did I mishear?)

1157
00:40:51,037 --> 00:40:52,076
(Laughing)

1158
00:40:52,077 --> 00:40:53,107
She ate a shrimp too.

1159
00:40:53,177 --> 00:40:55,447
My gosh. What do you mean you didn't?

1160
00:40:56,107 --> 00:40:58,006
- She ate a corn dog earlier.
- Right.

1161
00:40:58,007 --> 00:40:59,117
She ate a shrimp too.

1162
00:40:59,847 --> 00:41:01,517
- I had a vegetable wrap first.
- Yes.

1163
00:41:01,877 --> 00:41:03,817
And then I wiped my hands with lettuce before making yours.

1164
00:41:04,517 --> 00:41:06,516
(A new way of washing hands)

1165
00:41:06,517 --> 00:41:08,887
- Gosh, seriously.
- It makes sense. It's not bad.

1166
00:41:09,387 --> 00:41:10,727
- Gosh, seriously.
- That's hilarious.

1167
00:41:12,697 --> 00:41:14,656
- It's good.
- Indeed.

1168
00:41:14,657 --> 00:41:15,696
(They forgot about the deduction.)

1169
00:41:15,697 --> 00:41:18,937
(The Sixth Sense members are simply enjoying the food.)

1170
00:41:19,097 --> 00:41:22,267
(While everyone else is enjoying the meat...)

1171
00:41:22,437 --> 00:41:24,966
(There's one lady who is unusually quiet.)

1172
00:41:24,967 --> 00:41:26,437
Oh, no. Darn.

1173
00:41:28,177 --> 00:41:29,947
Na Ra, are you all right?

1174
00:41:30,307 --> 00:41:31,307
- Na Ra.
- Yes?

1175
00:41:31,308 --> 00:41:32,447
Wait in the car if you don't want to eat.

1176
00:41:33,017 --> 00:41:34,816
(This is bad.)

1177
00:41:34,817 --> 00:41:37,287
What is she... You know, right?

1178
00:41:38,617 --> 00:41:41,317
She has no appetite because of the diet aid.

1179
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:43,886
- I can still eat some, Jae Seok.
- Really?

1180
00:41:43,887 --> 00:41:44,957
Yes.

1181
00:41:45,327 --> 00:41:47,527
- He told her to wait in the car.
- Oh, it's so good.

1182
00:41:48,257 --> 00:41:49,527
It's really good, though.

1183
00:41:49,597 --> 00:41:52,397
(Her reaction makes Mimi feel embarrassed.)

1184
00:41:52,597 --> 00:41:54,096
It seems to me that Na Ra...

1185
00:41:54,097 --> 00:41:56,367
won't be able to guess the answer by tasting food.

1186
00:41:57,007 --> 00:41:59,407
I hope to see Na Ra enjoying food before we finish the shoot.

1187
00:41:59,577 --> 00:42:00,977
That place must be fake.

1188
00:42:01,907 --> 00:42:03,107
If Na Ra...

1189
00:42:03,577 --> 00:42:05,376
enjoys the food of only one place,

1190
00:42:05,377 --> 00:42:06,417
that place is fake.

1191
00:42:07,017 --> 00:42:08,117
That was hilarious.

1192
00:42:08,377 --> 00:42:09,947
I think this place is real.

1193
00:42:10,547 --> 00:42:12,086
You can tell if a restaurant is real or not...

1194
00:42:12,087 --> 00:42:14,016
- by tasting their kimchi.
- What do you think, Na Ra?

1195
00:42:14,017 --> 00:42:15,217
- Try some.
- What do you think?

1196
00:42:15,957 --> 00:42:17,456
(Will she overcome her poor appetite and finally get a right hunch?)

1197
00:42:17,457 --> 00:42:18,696
Eun I, are you all right?

1198
00:42:18,697 --> 00:42:19,697
I can't tell.

1199
00:42:20,357 --> 00:42:22,326
You're supposed to eat it, not pretending to chew it.

1200
00:42:22,327 --> 00:42:23,526
Come on, Na Ra.

1201
00:42:23,527 --> 00:42:24,897
(It's funny even to her.)

1202
00:42:25,097 --> 00:42:26,097
Na Ra has been...

1203
00:42:26,098 --> 00:42:27,597
chewing the same piece of meat all along.

1204
00:42:28,437 --> 00:42:30,667
- She put it in her mouth long ago.
- Why would she pretend to eat?

1205
00:42:30,867 --> 00:42:32,106
She did it when she ate the corn dog too.

1206
00:42:32,107 --> 00:42:33,276
(Her eating acting continued, starting with the corn dog.)

1207
00:42:33,277 --> 00:42:35,607
- Did you see how So Min teased her?
- Yes.

1208
00:42:35,907 --> 00:42:38,477
"Na Ra, pretend to swallow the food."

1209
00:42:39,217 --> 00:42:40,817
(Embarrassed)

1210
00:42:40,947 --> 00:42:42,417
The fake one of the day is you.

1211
00:42:42,717 --> 00:42:43,746
- She's fake.
- Today...

1212
00:42:43,747 --> 00:42:44,946
Today's fake one is Na Ra.

1213
00:42:44,947 --> 00:42:46,017
(Oh Na Ra is fake.)

1214
00:42:46,657 --> 00:42:49,257
(Meanwhile...)

1215
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:51,286
- All right.
- I did it very carefully.

1216
00:42:51,287 --> 00:42:52,757
Eun I, are you going to eat it all at once?

1217
00:42:53,127 --> 00:42:55,027
Why did she suddenly fall in love with minari?

1218
00:42:55,797 --> 00:42:56,867
This place must be famous for its minari.

1219
00:42:57,867 --> 00:42:59,697
(The minari bomb)

1220
00:43:00,537 --> 00:43:05,337
(While everyone else ate meat, Eun I ate only minari.)

1221
00:43:05,637 --> 00:43:07,477
(Addicted)

1222
00:43:08,137 --> 00:43:11,207
(She started eating minari alone with a lot of gusto.)

1223
00:43:11,607 --> 00:43:13,346
This place must be famous for its minari.

1224
00:43:13,347 --> 00:43:14,877
Why is she eating so much minari...

1225
00:43:15,017 --> 00:43:16,046
- Why...
- It's amazing.

1226
00:43:16,047 --> 00:43:17,216
- We have various types today.
- Is it good?

1227
00:43:17,217 --> 00:43:19,457
One lost her appetite, and one fell in love with minari.

1228
00:43:19,817 --> 00:43:21,257
- One made a wrap with dirty hands.
- It's so good.

1229
00:43:21,857 --> 00:43:23,787
(And this one is just eating food quietly.)

1230
00:43:24,827 --> 00:43:26,456
My, this sauce goes so well with minari.

1231
00:43:26,457 --> 00:43:27,457
(Pouring)

1232
00:43:27,457 --> 00:43:28,457
- Eun I.
- I'm serious.

1233
00:43:28,458 --> 00:43:32,027
- She's crazy about minari.
- It's no joke. It's amazing.

1234
00:43:33,397 --> 00:43:35,237
You should watch the movie "Minari" again when you go home.

1235
00:43:37,137 --> 00:43:38,536
Eun I, you can have all of it.

1236
00:43:38,537 --> 00:43:39,637
Why don't you guys eat this?

1237
00:43:40,107 --> 00:43:41,907
You finished it all. There's nothing for us to eat.

1238
00:43:43,377 --> 00:43:44,706
- Is it that good?
- You're eating everything...

1239
00:43:44,707 --> 00:43:45,946
and leaving none for us.

1240
00:43:45,947 --> 00:43:46,947
(There's nothing for us to eat.)

1241
00:43:47,047 --> 00:43:49,886
It's so good. I'm sorry. It's just so good.

1242
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:52,687
- Gosh, you guys are funny.
- This is so funny.

1243
00:43:52,957 --> 00:43:54,516
I'm full.

1244
00:43:54,517 --> 00:43:56,927
- Gosh, I'm full.
- I enjoyed the food.

1245
00:43:57,127 --> 00:43:59,127
I'll give you a hint just for this restaurant.

1246
00:43:59,497 --> 00:44:00,727
Yes, give us one.

1247
00:44:01,197 --> 00:44:02,397
Gosh, this is...

1248
00:44:04,597 --> 00:44:05,736
(Showing interest)

1249
00:44:05,737 --> 00:44:07,337
- Is this mine now?
- Can we keep it?

1250
00:44:07,997 --> 00:44:09,067
- No.
- No?

1251
00:44:09,467 --> 00:44:11,266
- I see. This is nice, though.
- But...

1252
00:44:11,267 --> 00:44:12,676
All right. Let's see.

1253
00:44:12,677 --> 00:44:14,377
- This video is the hint, right?
- Right.

1254
00:44:15,077 --> 00:44:16,647
It's on YouTube.

1255
00:44:17,647 --> 00:44:20,417
(They're playing a YouTube video of the barbecue place.)

1256
00:44:23,987 --> 00:44:25,487
You're saying we can look into this.

1257
00:44:26,517 --> 00:44:27,517
(Touch the screen on the part you want clues from.)

1258
00:44:27,518 --> 00:44:28,587
- It's a touchscreen?
- Gosh.

1259
00:44:29,387 --> 00:44:30,726
- Gosh.
- So then it gives us...

1260
00:44:30,727 --> 00:44:32,196
information about this place.

1261
00:44:32,197 --> 00:44:33,396
- It uses AI.
- That's insane.

1262
00:44:33,397 --> 00:44:34,397
Amazing, right?

1263
00:44:34,497 --> 00:44:36,127
There's already a lot of information about this place.

1264
00:44:37,467 --> 00:44:39,937
I feel like I've seen crock barbecue somewhere.

1265
00:44:40,237 --> 00:44:42,466
- There's already...
- There's information online.

1266
00:44:42,467 --> 00:44:43,906
information online.

1267
00:44:43,907 --> 00:44:45,806
We can't really trust this, though.

1268
00:44:45,807 --> 00:44:47,706
The staff could have done this.

1269
00:44:47,707 --> 00:44:48,947
(Kyoung Pyo thinks the staff put the information online.)

1270
00:44:49,007 --> 00:44:50,576
They sometimes prepare a month in advance.

1271
00:44:50,577 --> 00:44:51,806
They've done it before.

1272
00:44:51,807 --> 00:44:53,017
You can never fool me.

1273
00:44:55,277 --> 00:44:56,446
(This restaurant was supposedly built by the owner himself.)

1274
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,647
(Could this barbecue place be real?)

1275
00:44:58,087 --> 00:44:59,486
(I Do It All On My Own)

1276
00:44:59,487 --> 00:45:00,886
(1. The property is way too big for him to have built it by himself.)

1277
00:45:00,887 --> 00:45:02,286
(2. The tables and chairs are not comfortable enough to eat on.)

1278
00:45:02,287 --> 00:45:03,687
(3. There is a lot of information about the barbecue online.)

1279
00:45:04,927 --> 00:45:05,927
Let's go.

1280
00:45:06,027 --> 00:45:07,027
Let's go.

1281
00:45:07,028 --> 00:45:08,757
(Let's go and meet Five Handsome Owners!)

1282
00:45:08,797 --> 00:45:10,466
I think this place is real.

1283
00:45:10,467 --> 00:45:11,596
- I saw people going inside.
- Yes.

1284
00:45:11,597 --> 00:45:12,996
- Right.
- It's real.

1285
00:45:12,997 --> 00:45:14,996
- The key is whether or not...
- Yes.

1286
00:45:14,997 --> 00:45:16,666
the owner built the restaurant all by himself.

1287
00:45:16,667 --> 00:45:17,966
That's right.

1288
00:45:17,967 --> 00:45:19,606
There is one thing, though.

1289
00:45:19,607 --> 00:45:21,706
We're headed to the place that has five pretty-boy owners.

1290
00:45:21,707 --> 00:45:22,776
- Yes.
- Yes.

1291
00:45:22,777 --> 00:45:25,106
But it's exactly the kind of story that can be scripted by the staff.

1292
00:45:25,107 --> 00:45:26,116
You're right.

1293
00:45:26,117 --> 00:45:27,346
(While everyone is busy speculating...)

1294
00:45:27,347 --> 00:45:28,886
(Struggling)

1295
00:45:28,887 --> 00:45:29,887
Goodness.

1296
00:45:29,888 --> 00:45:31,116
(Squeezing)

1297
00:45:31,117 --> 00:45:32,356
(She doesn't know how to use her own hand cream.)

1298
00:45:32,357 --> 00:45:34,016
How do I use this?

1299
00:45:34,017 --> 00:45:36,057
- Press down here.
- I see.

1300
00:45:36,357 --> 00:45:38,126
Wasn't there a list with the order earlier?

1301
00:45:38,127 --> 00:45:39,327
- Where...
- There was.

1302
00:45:39,557 --> 00:45:41,327
There was? Can I see it?

1303
00:45:41,557 --> 00:45:42,926
(He feels too lazy.)

1304
00:45:42,927 --> 00:45:43,927
- Didn't you see it earlier?
- Jae Seok.

1305
00:45:43,928 --> 00:45:45,766
- Well, yes.
- Jae Seok.

1306
00:45:45,767 --> 00:45:46,866
- Here, go ahead.
- Thank you.

1307
00:45:46,867 --> 00:45:48,336
- Jae Seok, I'm sorry but...
- Yes?

1308
00:45:48,337 --> 00:45:50,106
- On the floor, on your left, - Why are you so cold to me?

1309
00:45:50,107 --> 00:45:51,366
- you'll see a lid.
- The lid for her hand cream.

1310
00:45:51,367 --> 00:45:54,107
- Yes, I see it.
- I was having trouble opening it.

1311
00:45:54,507 --> 00:45:56,547
I feel like you're bothering me a lot today.

1312
00:45:57,347 --> 00:45:58,446
Thank you.

1313
00:45:58,447 --> 00:46:00,576
Gosh, Jae Seok.

1314
00:46:00,577 --> 00:46:02,017
It must have been exhausting for you.

1315
00:46:02,287 --> 00:46:03,387
- There are five owners.
- There are five of them.

1316
00:46:03,687 --> 00:46:05,956
You were working with four other people like her.

1317
00:46:05,957 --> 00:46:06,957
(You were working with four other people like her.)

1318
00:46:06,958 --> 00:46:09,257
(Shuddering)

1319
00:46:09,427 --> 00:46:11,287
Gosh, I'm looking forward to seeing the five owners.

1320
00:46:11,487 --> 00:46:13,126
- There are five of them.
- Right.

1321
00:46:13,127 --> 00:46:14,196
Five good-looking guys.

1322
00:46:14,197 --> 00:46:15,627
(This is the happiest the original Sixth Sense member seemed today.)

1323
00:46:16,127 --> 00:46:17,666
What was the third place called?

1324
00:46:17,667 --> 00:46:18,796
Wrap and Eat.

1325
00:46:18,797 --> 00:46:20,796
- No. It's Steam and Eat.
- Yes. Steam and Eat.

1326
00:46:20,797 --> 00:46:22,706
She said "Wrap and Eat."

1327
00:46:22,707 --> 00:46:24,137
- Wrap.
- Excuse me.

1328
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:25,537
You do have presbyopia.

1329
00:46:27,307 --> 00:46:28,536
She's just overworked these days.

1330
00:46:28,537 --> 00:46:29,906
- I'm overworked these days.
- Why are you overworked?

1331
00:46:29,907 --> 00:46:31,606
- She's filming too much.
- Are you filming a lot?

1332
00:46:31,607 --> 00:46:33,516
Yes, I'm filming on a tight schedule.

1333
00:46:33,517 --> 00:46:35,276
You seem quite cheery today,

1334
00:46:35,277 --> 00:46:36,686
- considering how busy you are.
- Of course, she is.

1335
00:46:36,687 --> 00:46:38,917
I'm so happy right now. This is so much fun.

1336
00:46:39,517 --> 00:46:41,216
If only Na Ra...

1337
00:46:41,217 --> 00:46:43,686
were eating as much as she usually does,

1338
00:46:43,687 --> 00:46:45,227
we'd feel happy while watching her eat.

1339
00:46:45,457 --> 00:46:47,127
But she's lost her appetite.

1340
00:46:47,557 --> 00:46:48,926
I feel like you're amused by it.

1341
00:46:48,927 --> 00:46:50,066
- Yes, it's amusing for me.
- It's so funny.

1342
00:46:50,067 --> 00:46:51,197
- It's so funny.
- I mean...

1343
00:46:51,597 --> 00:46:52,597
- It's so funny...
- You're on a show...

1344
00:46:52,597 --> 00:46:53,597
- how you pretend to eat.
- where you have to eat.

1345
00:46:53,598 --> 00:46:54,836
It's so funny how you pretend to eat.

1346
00:46:54,837 --> 00:46:56,336
Even though you don't have an appetite, you still have to eat.

1347
00:46:56,337 --> 00:46:57,436
So you pretend to eat.

1348
00:46:57,437 --> 00:46:58,666
You know who I think is funnier?

1349
00:46:58,667 --> 00:47:00,806
You, Eun I. You ate a whole bunch of minari.

1350
00:47:00,807 --> 00:47:01,807
No, I didn't.

1351
00:47:01,808 --> 00:47:03,847
She ate as much minari as she did the pork.

1352
00:47:04,407 --> 00:47:05,776
No, the lettuce,

1353
00:47:05,777 --> 00:47:08,416
I mean, the sauce was so good with the minari.

1354
00:47:08,417 --> 00:47:10,486
Children would love eating there.

1355
00:47:10,487 --> 00:47:12,246
- Right. The braised pork ribs.
- Yes.

1356
00:47:12,247 --> 00:47:14,786
You're thinking about Na Eun again, aren't you?

1357
00:47:14,787 --> 00:47:16,426
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

1358
00:47:16,427 --> 00:47:18,426
I wish I were Na Eun.

1359
00:47:18,427 --> 00:47:19,656
She said, "I wish I were Na Eun."

1360
00:47:19,657 --> 00:47:22,426
If I were his kid, I would be the eldest, not Ji Ho.

1361
00:47:22,427 --> 00:47:24,426
I would be the first-born heiress.

1362
00:47:24,427 --> 00:47:27,166
Jae Seok, there's a long list of people wanting to be adopted.

1363
00:47:27,167 --> 00:47:29,006
Mimi was born on the same day as Ji Ho,

1364
00:47:29,007 --> 00:47:30,306
so she keeps saying she's the heiress.

1365
00:47:30,307 --> 00:47:31,337
Right.

1366
00:47:32,167 --> 00:47:34,676
If I were Ji Ho, I think I'd be like this.

1367
00:47:34,677 --> 00:47:36,147
"Do I remind you of anyone?"

1368
00:47:36,247 --> 00:47:37,476
- Like that.
- I see.

1369
00:47:37,477 --> 00:47:38,506
"Do I remind you of anyone?"

1370
00:47:38,507 --> 00:47:40,247
Ji Ho isn't like that, though.

1371
00:47:40,447 --> 00:47:42,617
- But So Min is.
- Right.

1372
00:47:43,117 --> 00:47:44,416
- What?
- If you were him...

1373
00:47:44,417 --> 00:47:46,016
- Well...
- So Min would be like,

1374
00:47:46,017 --> 00:47:47,186
"Do I remind you of anyone?"

1375
00:47:47,187 --> 00:47:49,127
Right.

1376
00:47:49,427 --> 00:47:51,156
"Yes, you're right. It's him."

1377
00:47:51,157 --> 00:47:52,327
(Laughing)

1378
00:47:52,827 --> 00:47:54,496
So Min would definitely say that.

1379
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:56,826
- "Yes, you're right." - "It's him."

1380
00:47:56,827 --> 00:47:58,927
"He's... That's all I can say."

1381
00:47:59,067 --> 00:48:00,166
Gosh, you're funny.

1382
00:48:00,167 --> 00:48:01,336
Her imagination is so funny.

1383
00:48:01,337 --> 00:48:02,536
- Right.
- I know.

1384
00:48:02,537 --> 00:48:04,566
I say this all the time,

1385
00:48:04,567 --> 00:48:05,637
but So Min is nuts.

1386
00:48:06,777 --> 00:48:08,977
- She's a funny kid.
- So Min is a funny kid.

1387
00:48:09,447 --> 00:48:11,646
- Gosh.
- That's just like So Min.

1388
00:48:11,647 --> 00:48:12,817
(The battle of the heiresses over Jae Seok's fortune is over.)

1389
00:48:13,017 --> 00:48:14,247
This seems like...

1390
00:48:14,977 --> 00:48:16,346
- I think it's a five-day market.
- Right.

1391
00:48:16,347 --> 00:48:19,487
It is. I think we're headed to a five-day market.

1392
00:48:19,917 --> 00:48:22,926
When I was younger, I wasn't particularly fond of markets.

1393
00:48:22,927 --> 00:48:24,156
- Right?
- Yes.

1394
00:48:24,157 --> 00:48:26,226
- It gets more exciting as you age.
- You have fun now, don't you?

1395
00:48:26,227 --> 00:48:27,657
- Right.
- It feels more human.

1396
00:48:27,897 --> 00:48:29,096
I think we're here.

1397
00:48:29,097 --> 00:48:32,197
(What trendy place is awaiting them at the Yangpyeong five-day market?)

1398
00:48:32,397 --> 00:48:34,437
I love being at markets.

1399
00:48:34,697 --> 00:48:36,607
Is the second trendy place inside the market?

1400
00:48:36,907 --> 00:48:39,206
- This market is huge.
- There are lots to buy here.

1401
00:48:39,207 --> 00:48:40,207
Let's go.

1402
00:48:41,107 --> 00:48:42,337
Gosh, what's this?

1403
00:48:43,277 --> 00:48:45,606
(The market is set up even before sunrise.)

1404
00:48:45,607 --> 00:48:46,747
Gosh, what's this?

1405
00:48:46,877 --> 00:48:48,516
- Gosh, hello.
- Hello.

1406
00:48:48,517 --> 00:48:50,917
- Hello.
- Gosh.

1407
00:48:51,117 --> 00:48:52,456
This market is full of energy.

1408
00:48:52,457 --> 00:48:53,457
(The five-day market is full of people every time.)

1409
00:48:53,458 --> 00:48:55,556
- Gosh, I love those.
- They're delicious.

1410
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:57,557
I love being at markets.

1411
00:48:58,057 --> 00:48:59,196
Those are cabbage pancakes.

1412
00:48:59,197 --> 00:49:00,256
Buckwheat cabbage pancakes.

1413
00:49:00,257 --> 00:49:02,867
- I want to eat the food here.
- Gosh.

1414
00:49:03,227 --> 00:49:05,296
People usually eat sticky donuts.

1415
00:49:05,297 --> 00:49:06,697
- I love those.
- Or twisted donuts.

1416
00:49:07,537 --> 00:49:09,236
- It's susubukkumi.
- I love susubukkumi.

1417
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:10,437
- I love those.
- Me too.

1418
00:49:10,967 --> 00:49:14,507
(This market is already famous on social media among foodies.)

1419
00:49:15,137 --> 00:49:18,677
(The Yangpyeong five-day market is a must for Yangpyeong visitors.)

1420
00:49:19,777 --> 00:49:21,946
- Hello. Gosh, you must be cold.
- Hello.

1421
00:49:21,947 --> 00:49:23,546
Gosh, spinach must be good these days.

1422
00:49:23,547 --> 00:49:26,116
Dried persimmon. I love those.

1423
00:49:26,117 --> 00:49:27,856
- Thank you.
- The five-day market.

1424
00:49:27,857 --> 00:49:28,917
(The dried persimmon caught Mimi's eyes.)

1425
00:49:30,057 --> 00:49:31,657
I won't hit you even if you don't buy it.

1426
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:34,426
- Thank you.
- He said, "I won't hit you for it."

1427
00:49:34,427 --> 00:49:35,597
"You don't have to buy any. I won't hit you for it."

1428
00:49:36,197 --> 00:49:37,796
- Goodness. Thank you.
- Thank you.

1429
00:49:37,797 --> 00:49:39,296
- Thank you.
- Thank you. It's so good.

1430
00:49:39,297 --> 00:49:40,336
Come on.

1431
00:49:40,337 --> 00:49:41,566
I see you're having lunch.

1432
00:49:41,567 --> 00:49:43,606
- Enjoy your lunch. Goodness.
- Enjoy your lunch.

1433
00:49:43,607 --> 00:49:44,607
Goodness.

1434
00:49:44,767 --> 00:49:45,767
(Shouting)

1435
00:49:46,407 --> 00:49:47,407
Enjoy your lunch.

1436
00:49:47,408 --> 00:49:49,276
She threw her chopsticks to the ground.

1437
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:50,376
- Her chopsticks.
- She said,

1438
00:49:50,377 --> 00:49:52,046
"Come on!"

1439
00:49:52,047 --> 00:49:53,246
(The Sixth Sense members feel refreshed thanks to their energy.)

1440
00:49:53,247 --> 00:49:54,516
You're able to tell...

1441
00:49:54,517 --> 00:49:56,616
how popular you are as a celebrity when you visit a market.

1442
00:49:56,617 --> 00:49:58,087
- Right, from the way people react.
- Yes.

1443
00:49:58,817 --> 00:50:01,316
- Hello.
- These are so pretty.

1444
00:50:01,317 --> 00:50:02,386
Thank you.

1445
00:50:02,387 --> 00:50:03,456
Gosh, you're Yu Jae Seok!

1446
00:50:03,457 --> 00:50:05,186
- Hello.
- Goodness. Hello.

1447
00:50:05,187 --> 00:50:07,726
I'm going to sell a lot today since I saw you.

1448
00:50:07,727 --> 00:50:08,826
Stay healthy.

1449
00:50:08,827 --> 00:50:10,026
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1450
00:50:10,027 --> 00:50:11,696
- Jae Seok is so popular.
- Jae Seok is so popular.

1451
00:50:11,697 --> 00:50:13,296
- Jae Seok is so popular.
- Almighty Yu.

1452
00:50:13,297 --> 00:50:14,437
- Jae Seok, you're so popular.
- Almighty Yu.

1453
00:50:14,897 --> 00:50:15,936
Can you come say hi?

1454
00:50:15,937 --> 00:50:17,466
- Of course, we can.
- Hello.

1455
00:50:17,467 --> 00:50:19,006
- Hello.
- I'm just saying hi.

1456
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:20,676
- Oh, hello.
- Your face is so small.

1457
00:50:20,677 --> 00:50:21,877
Nice to meet you.

1458
00:50:22,177 --> 00:50:24,006
- Eun I, please come say hi.
- Gosh, hello.

1459
00:50:24,007 --> 00:50:25,106
Your face is really small too.

1460
00:50:25,107 --> 00:50:26,246
Stay healthy.

1461
00:50:26,247 --> 00:50:27,677
- Have a nice day.
- I will.

1462
00:50:28,047 --> 00:50:31,246
Sir, are you roasting acorns?

1463
00:50:31,247 --> 00:50:32,416
Aren't you Yu Jae Seok?

1464
00:50:32,417 --> 00:50:33,557
- Yes, he is.
- Goodness.

1465
00:50:34,417 --> 00:50:36,226
- Why are you roasting acorns?
- What?

1466
00:50:36,227 --> 00:50:38,326
- The acorns.
- They're ginkgo nuts, not acorns.

1467
00:50:38,327 --> 00:50:39,626
They're ginkgo nuts?

1468
00:50:39,627 --> 00:50:41,796
- Yes.
- Are they for yourself?

1469
00:50:41,797 --> 00:50:42,966
(Ginkgo nuts are a must-needed snack for the merchants.)

1470
00:50:42,967 --> 00:50:44,826
You look much younger in person.

1471
00:50:44,827 --> 00:50:46,196
(Only at markets do people tell him that he looks young for his age.)

1472
00:50:46,197 --> 00:50:47,197
He doesn't age.

1473
00:50:47,198 --> 00:50:49,366
- I know who you are.
- She's Song Eun I.

1474
00:50:49,367 --> 00:50:51,466
- I'm Song Eun I.
- She's Song Eun I.

1475
00:50:51,467 --> 00:50:52,906
She was on "Unanswered Questions."

1476
00:50:52,907 --> 00:50:54,736
- I'm Song Eun I.
- "Unanswered Questions?"

1477
00:50:54,737 --> 00:50:55,946
You were on "Unanswered Questions?"

1478
00:50:55,947 --> 00:50:57,746
I think she's referring to "Brave Detectives."

1479
00:50:57,747 --> 00:50:59,747
(I think she's referring to "Brave Detectives.")

1480
00:50:59,877 --> 00:51:01,146
- "Brave Detectives." - I see. "Brave Detectives."

1481
00:51:01,147 --> 00:51:02,887
People get them confused.

1482
00:51:03,187 --> 00:51:04,786
Eun I is so popular at markets.

1483
00:51:04,787 --> 00:51:06,017
Of course.

1484
00:51:06,317 --> 00:51:07,656
- Aren't you Song Eun I?
- Those are hardy kiwis.

1485
00:51:07,657 --> 00:51:09,256
- I am.
- Goodness.

1486
00:51:09,257 --> 00:51:10,456
This is Yu Jae Seok.

1487
00:51:10,457 --> 00:51:11,856
- Goodness.
- Gosh.

1488
00:51:11,857 --> 00:51:12,927
Take a picture with me.

1489
00:51:13,027 --> 00:51:15,457
(Everyone here is adorable.)

1490
00:51:15,627 --> 00:51:19,126
New guests keep making special appearances.

1491
00:51:19,127 --> 00:51:20,536
- They don't hesitate at all.
- Right.

1492
00:51:20,537 --> 00:51:21,897
(The five-day market feels so human.)

1493
00:51:22,567 --> 00:51:24,006
Hello. Happy New Year.

1494
00:51:24,007 --> 00:51:25,337
- Hello.
- Hello.

1495
00:51:25,667 --> 00:51:27,707
- It's hotteok.
- Gosh, it's hotteok.

1496
00:51:28,937 --> 00:51:30,306
(They ran into a hotteok tent...)

1497
00:51:30,307 --> 00:51:31,677
(on their way to meet the Five Handsome Owners.)

1498
00:51:31,977 --> 00:51:34,117
Gosh, Kim Hye Soo was here.

1499
00:51:34,317 --> 00:51:35,546
(Kim Hye Soo, Choi Gang Hee, BLACKPINK, Red Velvet were here.)

1500
00:51:35,547 --> 00:51:36,547
That's Gang Hee.

1501
00:51:36,817 --> 00:51:38,016
- Gang Hee was here.
- You're right.

1502
00:51:38,017 --> 00:51:40,187
BLACKPINK was here too.

1503
00:51:41,157 --> 00:51:43,026
- Hello.
- This is amazing.

1504
00:51:43,027 --> 00:51:44,257
Nice to meet you.

1505
00:51:44,887 --> 00:51:46,026
- Hello.
- Kyoung Pyo!

1506
00:51:46,027 --> 00:51:47,757
- What?
- Goodness.

1507
00:51:48,112 --> 00:51:49,241
- Hello.
- Kyoung Pyo!

1508
00:51:49,242 --> 00:51:50,982
- What?
- Goodness.

1509
00:51:51,482 --> 00:51:52,482
(Kyoung Pyo!)

1510
00:51:52,582 --> 00:51:54,051
- Goodness.
- Goodness.

1511
00:51:54,052 --> 00:51:55,682
- What's going on?
- Is he an acquaintance?

1512
00:51:55,952 --> 00:51:56,952
Gosh.

1513
00:51:58,282 --> 00:51:59,322
- Who is that?
- What's going on?

1514
00:51:59,692 --> 00:52:01,551
- Is this real?
- We went to school together.

1515
00:52:01,552 --> 00:52:02,552
- Yes.
- Gosh.

1516
00:52:02,553 --> 00:52:04,062
- Really?
- That's amazing.

1517
00:52:04,422 --> 00:52:06,131
Are you the owner?

1518
00:52:06,132 --> 00:52:07,891
It's my aunt and her husband's.

1519
00:52:07,892 --> 00:52:09,262
- Really?
- Goodness.

1520
00:52:09,802 --> 00:52:11,261
- Gosh, hello.
- I'm so glad you're here.

1521
00:52:11,262 --> 00:52:13,071
Hello. Gosh, but...

1522
00:52:13,072 --> 00:52:14,402
we didn't even order anything yet.

1523
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:16,371
(A hotteok was brought to Jae Seok.)

1524
00:52:16,372 --> 00:52:17,372
He didn't even order yet.

1525
00:52:17,373 --> 00:52:19,102
She brought him that hotteok as if it's a bouquet of flowers.

1526
00:52:19,972 --> 00:52:22,141
- This looks so good.
- That's...

1527
00:52:22,142 --> 00:52:23,741
- You might pass out after a bite.
- It looks perfect.

1528
00:52:23,742 --> 00:52:25,611
- I might actually pass out.
- It's worth passing out for.

1529
00:52:25,612 --> 00:52:26,612
(The Korean dessert has conquered the Yangpyeong five-day market.)

1530
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:29,351
(The hotteok of the Yangpyeong five-day marketplace)

1531
00:52:29,352 --> 00:52:30,981
(It's full of perilla seed powder and medicinal herbs...)

1532
00:52:30,982 --> 00:52:32,581
(produced in Yangpyeong.)

1533
00:52:32,582 --> 00:52:34,352
- There are nuts in the batter.
- In the batter.

1534
00:52:35,322 --> 00:52:37,021
- It's covered in seeds.
- Yes.

1535
00:52:37,022 --> 00:52:38,522
(The hotteok looks like it's covered in seeds.)

1536
00:52:38,922 --> 00:52:42,562
(The uniqueness of this hotteok comes from its texture.)

1537
00:52:43,132 --> 00:52:46,702
(What does this hotteok sought by even celebrities taste like?)

1538
00:52:47,202 --> 00:52:49,672
- Gosh, thank you.
- That's completely...

1539
00:52:49,942 --> 00:52:51,041
- Please bring her some.
- This is...

1540
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:52,472
Yeong Ja?

1541
00:52:52,912 --> 00:52:54,671
What is it?

1542
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:56,081
What kind of secret conversation did you have?

1543
00:52:56,082 --> 00:52:58,341
She came up to me and said,

1544
00:52:58,342 --> 00:53:00,011
"I've prepared some hotteok."

1545
00:53:00,012 --> 00:53:01,982
"Please bring some to Lee Yeong Ja."

1546
00:53:02,952 --> 00:53:05,251
(Yeong Ja has taken over Yangpyeong as the food expert.)

1547
00:53:05,252 --> 00:53:07,391
I'm such a huge fan, Na Ra.

1548
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:08,392
- Really?
- Gosh, really?

1549
00:53:08,392 --> 00:53:09,392
- Thank you.
- I'm a fan.

1550
00:53:09,393 --> 00:53:10,861
- Gosh, thank you so much.
- Can I get a picture?

1551
00:53:10,862 --> 00:53:13,191
- She's lost her appetite, though.
- I know.

1552
00:53:13,192 --> 00:53:15,531
I think they're giving these out in order of popularity.

1553
00:53:15,532 --> 00:53:17,501
(What about Mimi?)

1554
00:53:17,502 --> 00:53:18,831
Gosh, thank you.

1555
00:53:18,832 --> 00:53:20,201
- Thank you.
- She was on "Princess Aurora."

1556
00:53:20,202 --> 00:53:21,701
- Thank you for the hotteok.
- You're Princess Aurora.

1557
00:53:21,702 --> 00:53:24,002
- Gosh.
- Princess Aurora!

1558
00:53:24,342 --> 00:53:26,371
- This is so good.
- This is so good.

1559
00:53:26,372 --> 00:53:29,412
(Meanwhile, Kochelin Kyoung Pyo is filming a vlog.)

1560
00:53:29,782 --> 00:53:30,912
(Yum)

1561
00:53:31,142 --> 00:53:32,882
- This is so good.
- It is so nutty.

1562
00:53:33,412 --> 00:53:35,782
The nuts make the hotteok so filling as if it's a whole meal.

1563
00:53:36,452 --> 00:53:37,452
- This is so good.
- It's so good.

1564
00:53:37,452 --> 00:53:38,452
It's really good.

1565
00:53:38,952 --> 00:53:39,952
(Gosh)

1566
00:53:40,022 --> 00:53:41,251
- This is great.
- It's so nutty.

1567
00:53:41,252 --> 00:53:42,522
- It's really nutty.
- It's nutty.

1568
00:53:43,122 --> 00:53:44,592
It's pretty to look at too.

1569
00:53:44,922 --> 00:53:47,861
It totally feels nutritious.

1570
00:53:47,862 --> 00:53:50,262
- This is really good.
- It is, right?

1571
00:53:51,162 --> 00:53:52,532
How long has it been since you last met?

1572
00:53:53,332 --> 00:53:54,432
I saw him last month.

1573
00:53:55,832 --> 00:53:57,201
But I didn't expect to see him here.

1574
00:53:57,202 --> 00:53:59,511
- But earlier, it seemed like...
- Right.

1575
00:53:59,512 --> 00:54:01,272
- he was on "Reunite on TV." - That's right.

1576
00:54:01,542 --> 00:54:03,041
As if they were reuniting for the 1st time in 20 years,

1577
00:54:03,042 --> 00:54:04,112
- he said Kyoung Pyo's name.
- He showed method acting.

1578
00:54:04,182 --> 00:54:05,312
"Kyoung Pyo!"

1579
00:54:06,152 --> 00:54:07,182
"Kyoung Pyo!"

1580
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:11,752
(My friend, Kyoung Pyo, whom I haven't seen for an entire month)

1581
00:54:12,182 --> 00:54:14,422
(My friend!)

1582
00:54:14,622 --> 00:54:16,622
(A heartfelt reunion)

1583
00:54:16,822 --> 00:54:18,961
- I thought it had been long.
- They saw each other last month.

1584
00:54:18,962 --> 00:54:21,031
I didn't think I would run into him here.

1585
00:54:21,032 --> 00:54:22,261
Really?

1586
00:54:22,262 --> 00:54:23,761
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1587
00:54:23,762 --> 00:54:25,031
- Stay healthy.
- Stay healthy.

1588
00:54:25,032 --> 00:54:26,671
- That was so good.
- That hotteok has...

1589
00:54:26,672 --> 00:54:28,102
- an addictive flavor.
- Right.

1590
00:54:28,372 --> 00:54:30,241
- This market is huge.
- There's a lot of stands.

1591
00:54:30,242 --> 00:54:32,142
I think this entire aisle is set up with food stands.

1592
00:54:34,042 --> 00:54:35,042
What's this?

1593
00:54:36,582 --> 00:54:39,011
- Gosh, I think this is it.
- What?

1594
00:54:39,012 --> 00:54:40,451
- Is this it?
- I think it is.

1595
00:54:40,452 --> 00:54:41,881
- This is it?
- It is.

1596
00:54:41,882 --> 00:54:43,451
- This is it.
- I have a feeling this is it.

1597
00:54:43,452 --> 00:54:45,382
I think this is it.

1598
00:54:45,522 --> 00:54:47,791
Look. Right.

1599
00:54:47,792 --> 00:54:50,461
I see the five good-looking owners.

1600
00:54:50,462 --> 00:54:53,132
- They look like they're idols.
- Hello.

1601
00:54:54,562 --> 00:54:56,532
(Idols at the Yangpyeong five-day market?)

1602
00:54:57,532 --> 00:54:59,201
(Because the weather is good)

1603
00:54:59,202 --> 00:55:01,372
(Because it's the day of the five-day market)

1604
00:55:02,202 --> 00:55:05,472
(They're coming, the five people who shine in every moment.)

1605
00:55:07,072 --> 00:55:11,082
(They're radiant.)

1606
00:55:11,842 --> 00:55:14,182
(The Five Handsome Owners of the Yangpyeong five-day market)

1607
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:19,222
(This special booth is only at the Yangpyeong five-day market.)

1608
00:55:20,192 --> 00:55:24,662
(Five good-looking owners came together and founded...)

1609
00:55:25,162 --> 00:55:27,792
(Young Men's Food of the World.)

1610
00:55:29,132 --> 00:55:31,832
(Their looks are even more extravagant than their food.)

1611
00:55:32,232 --> 00:55:35,202
(Who are the Five Handsome Owners?)

1612
00:55:35,432 --> 00:55:37,502
- They're very good-looking.
- Goodness.

1613
00:55:37,802 --> 00:55:40,972
- This location is perfect too.
- They're so good-looking.

1614
00:55:41,272 --> 00:55:42,571
This is obviously fake.

1615
00:55:42,572 --> 00:55:43,711
(What is he standing here for?)

1616
00:55:43,712 --> 00:55:45,311
We'll just work with what we've got.

1617
00:55:45,312 --> 00:55:46,712
Go ahead.

1618
00:55:47,252 --> 00:55:48,281
It's so obviously fake.

1619
00:55:48,282 --> 00:55:49,451
- You're just...
- It's so obviously fake.

1620
00:55:49,452 --> 00:55:50,982
You're just blatantly giving us the answer?

1621
00:55:51,252 --> 00:55:52,822
- This is fake, right?
- You made it so obvious.

1622
00:55:53,022 --> 00:55:54,221
This must have been so easy for you to come up with.

1623
00:55:54,222 --> 00:55:55,751
- It must have been very easy.
- Anyone can tell...

1624
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:56,991
this one is perfect for today's guests.

1625
00:55:56,992 --> 00:55:58,791
- This is practically...
- This is too...

1626
00:55:58,792 --> 00:55:59,931
This is obviously for...

1627
00:55:59,932 --> 00:56:01,031
- So Min and Na Ra.
- It's for them.

1628
00:56:01,032 --> 00:56:03,601
I'm not sure if it's just me, but I feel like...

1629
00:56:03,602 --> 00:56:05,632
- the female guests...
- Right.

1630
00:56:06,502 --> 00:56:09,842
- sound especially excited today.
- Anyone can tell.

1631
00:56:10,102 --> 00:56:11,542
(Jae Seok spotted something.)

1632
00:56:11,842 --> 00:56:13,142
- Gosh.
- The corners of your mouth.

1633
00:56:14,512 --> 00:56:16,041
- The corners of her mouth are...
- Say something.

1634
00:56:16,042 --> 00:56:17,612
It's been a while since I've seen the corners of her mouth like this.

1635
00:56:18,482 --> 00:56:20,281
- So Min, snap out of it.
- Gosh, So Min...

1636
00:56:20,282 --> 00:56:22,182
So Min can't keep a straight face.

1637
00:56:22,352 --> 00:56:23,452
So Min does this.

1638
00:56:23,652 --> 00:56:24,652
I know.

1639
00:56:24,652 --> 00:56:25,652
(So Min smiles while scrunching her nose.)

1640
00:56:25,653 --> 00:56:27,821
- She really does.
- Her face is just honest.

1641
00:56:27,822 --> 00:56:29,792
- Her nose scrunches.
- But really,

1642
00:56:29,992 --> 00:56:31,561
how long have you been selling here?

1643
00:56:31,562 --> 00:56:33,161
It's been three months.

1644
00:56:33,162 --> 00:56:34,831
- Three months?
- Three to four months.

1645
00:56:34,832 --> 00:56:37,461
- Three months is the time...
- It's the perfect amount of time.

1646
00:56:37,462 --> 00:56:38,931
the staff can take to set things up.

1647
00:56:38,932 --> 00:56:40,031
- Right.
- It's perfect.

1648
00:56:40,032 --> 00:56:41,901
- It definitely hasn't been long.
- Three months.

1649
00:56:41,902 --> 00:56:44,142
Is this space always vacant?

1650
00:56:45,072 --> 00:56:48,111
(The way they're particularly far away is suspicious.)

1651
00:56:48,112 --> 00:56:50,211
Is this space always vacant?

1652
00:56:50,212 --> 00:56:51,611
No, there's usually a fried chicken stand.

1653
00:56:51,612 --> 00:56:53,982
But I heard it's not opening today because the owner is sick.

1654
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:57,381
- The owner is sick?
- That one's a tent too?

1655
00:56:57,382 --> 00:56:59,051
- Yes, it's a tent.
- I see.

1656
00:56:59,052 --> 00:57:00,291
(The Five Handsome Owners, the fried chicken stand)

1657
00:57:00,292 --> 00:57:02,892
(Are the owners who are acquainted with their neighboring stand real?)

1658
00:57:04,562 --> 00:57:06,762
- What is that?
- That's paella, right?

1659
00:57:07,062 --> 00:57:08,891
Gosh, it's paella.

1660
00:57:08,892 --> 00:57:09,961
(The cauldron paella caught their eyes.)

1661
00:57:09,962 --> 00:57:12,261
- This looks really good.
- This looks amazing.

1662
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,001
Who taught you how to make paella...

1663
00:57:14,002 --> 00:57:16,201
on a cauldron like this?

1664
00:57:16,202 --> 00:57:17,772
- Why is he talking like that?
- Are you the food police?

1665
00:57:18,142 --> 00:57:19,641
Why is he talking like that?

1666
00:57:19,642 --> 00:57:21,242
Are you the food police or what?

1667
00:57:21,512 --> 00:57:22,812
Who taught you this?

1668
00:57:23,112 --> 00:57:24,741
How do the five of you know each other?

1669
00:57:24,742 --> 00:57:27,811
- Right. That's the most important.
- Two of them I met at work,

1670
00:57:27,812 --> 00:57:30,451
and one of them brought the other two.

1671
00:57:30,452 --> 00:57:32,081
What kind of work?

1672
00:57:32,082 --> 00:57:34,251
- We're actually models.
- Right?

1673
00:57:34,252 --> 00:57:35,891
- We're actually models.
- Right?

1674
00:57:35,892 --> 00:57:38,021
- You look like you are.
- That's right. Your looks...

1675
00:57:38,022 --> 00:57:40,761
Hello. We sell foods of the world at the Yangpyeong five-day market.

1676
00:57:40,762 --> 00:57:42,232
We own Young Men's Food of the World.

1677
00:57:42,662 --> 00:57:44,231
The five of us are currently models.

1678
00:57:44,232 --> 00:57:46,102
(All five owners are models.)

1679
00:57:46,972 --> 00:57:49,502
(From various TV commercials...)

1680
00:57:50,002 --> 00:57:53,912
(to fashion shows and pictorials,)

1681
00:57:54,212 --> 00:57:56,682
(they're actively working as models.)

1682
00:57:56,812 --> 00:58:01,211
Some freelance models might make a lot of money,

1683
00:58:01,212 --> 00:58:03,252
but usually,

1684
00:58:03,552 --> 00:58:06,852
it's quite difficult.

1685
00:58:07,092 --> 00:58:09,221
And models generally don't have a long career span,

1686
00:58:09,222 --> 00:58:11,592
so I'm sure there are lots of models who have other jobs in mind.

1687
00:58:11,922 --> 00:58:14,531
I actually run a dumpling place with my parents...

1688
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:16,502
as a side job while I model.

1689
00:58:17,262 --> 00:58:18,931
(He's famous on social media...)

1690
00:58:18,932 --> 00:58:20,602
(as the dumpling place owner who resembles Rowoon.)

1691
00:58:21,032 --> 00:58:23,201
I thought selling at a five-day market was a good idea,

1692
00:58:23,202 --> 00:58:24,602
so that's how we began.

1693
00:58:26,142 --> 00:58:28,771
I'm actually from Yangpyeong,

1694
00:58:28,772 --> 00:58:31,642
so the area holds a special place in my heart.

1695
00:58:32,282 --> 00:58:35,052
And markets are trending among young people these days.

1696
00:58:35,812 --> 00:58:39,752
(People wait in line to eat at restaurants located in markets!)

1697
00:58:40,122 --> 00:58:41,751
(They started off at the Yangpyeong five-day market.)

1698
00:58:41,752 --> 00:58:43,921
For now, we want to keep selling at the five-day market.

1699
00:58:43,922 --> 00:58:46,192
But our goal for the future is to open our own restaurant.

1700
00:58:47,392 --> 00:58:49,801
We're models,

1701
00:58:49,802 --> 00:58:51,201
and we're young.

1702
00:58:51,202 --> 00:58:52,801
So we didn't want to sell food that's common.

1703
00:58:52,802 --> 00:58:55,901
We wanted to make trendy food.

1704
00:58:55,902 --> 00:58:57,941
I'm in charge of making a dish called paella.

1705
00:58:57,942 --> 00:59:00,012
I use a cauldron that is 1m wide to cook it.

1706
00:59:00,372 --> 00:59:03,082
I'm in charge of making dumpling balls.

1707
00:59:03,282 --> 00:59:05,212
What's special about them is that they don't have dumpling skin.

1708
00:59:05,342 --> 00:59:07,981
The food I make is burgers.

1709
00:59:07,982 --> 00:59:10,251
I put kielbasa in them.

1710
00:59:10,252 --> 00:59:12,351
I make braised chicken ramyeon.

1711
00:59:12,352 --> 00:59:14,451
Each bowl of ramyeon gets a whole chicken leg.

1712
00:59:14,452 --> 00:59:16,521
I make takoyaki.

1713
00:59:16,522 --> 00:59:18,162
I make them Korean-style...

1714
00:59:18,622 --> 00:59:22,132
and use these.

1715
00:59:22,662 --> 00:59:25,361
(They sell never-before-seen, uniques dishes.)

1716
00:59:25,362 --> 00:59:26,471
- Will you be eating here?
- Yes.

1717
00:59:26,472 --> 00:59:27,601
Right. Follow me.

1718
00:59:27,602 --> 00:59:30,142
I'll seat you once you choose what dish you want.

1719
00:59:30,402 --> 00:59:33,002
(As a result, their tent is always full.)

1720
00:59:33,372 --> 00:59:37,582
(They're going viral on social media too.)

1721
00:59:37,712 --> 00:59:41,252
I think our daily sales revenue is about 1,500 dollars.

1722
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:43,051
I think the secret to...

1723
00:59:43,052 --> 00:59:44,452
our tent's popularity is us.

1724
00:59:45,152 --> 00:59:46,592
(Embarrassed)

1725
00:59:46,922 --> 00:59:48,121
Sixth Sense members,

1726
00:59:48,122 --> 00:59:49,891
- is this place real?
- Is this place real?

1727
00:59:49,892 --> 00:59:52,362
(Sixth Sense members, is this place real?)

1728
00:59:52,822 --> 00:59:53,992
The thing is, I...

1729
00:59:54,092 --> 00:59:55,461
- Gosh, I'm suspicious.
- You've seen them before?

1730
00:59:55,462 --> 00:59:57,461
It's not that I've seen them,

1731
00:59:57,462 --> 01:00:00,101
but I noticed that models have culinary side hustles.

1732
01:00:00,102 --> 01:00:01,102
That's right.

1733
01:00:01,602 --> 01:00:03,972
(Recently, another variety show featured and made viral...)

1734
01:00:04,442 --> 01:00:06,812
(a barbecue place owned and run by models.)

1735
01:00:06,942 --> 01:00:09,782
(The trendy place reminds people of the backstage of a fashion show.)

1736
01:00:10,642 --> 01:00:14,312
(And good-looking food stand owners are going viral on social media.)

1737
01:00:14,912 --> 01:00:16,721
(Recently, one of them gained so much popularity...)

1738
01:00:16,722 --> 01:00:18,552
(that he opened his own store inside a department store.)

1739
01:00:18,722 --> 01:00:20,991
That's what inspired me to start this.

1740
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:23,661
I saw the business owners on social media...

1741
01:00:23,662 --> 01:00:25,722
and thought it would be a good opportunity for me. For us.

1742
01:00:25,922 --> 01:00:27,731
(Eun I is suspicious.)

1743
01:00:27,732 --> 01:00:30,031
Do you get many customers?

1744
01:00:30,032 --> 01:00:31,101
We do get many customers.

1745
01:00:31,102 --> 01:00:32,401
We get a lot of young students...

1746
01:00:32,402 --> 01:00:34,131
and a lot of the elderly.

1747
01:00:34,132 --> 01:00:36,671
I feel like the students would come here to see them...

1748
01:00:36,672 --> 01:00:38,541
- Right.
- because they're so good-looking.

1749
01:00:38,542 --> 01:00:40,672
They probably don't even care about how the food tastes.

1750
01:00:41,742 --> 01:00:42,941
I think they will.

1751
01:00:42,942 --> 01:00:44,382
- What are you saying?
- Are you talking about yourself?

1752
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:46,852
Did you see her waving her hands in denial?

1753
01:00:47,252 --> 01:00:48,682
("No, I wasn't talking about myself.")

1754
01:00:49,182 --> 01:00:50,921
Their dishes...

1755
01:00:50,922 --> 01:00:52,721
Can we come inside and try your food?

1756
01:00:52,722 --> 01:00:53,821
- Yes.
- Let's go inside.

1757
01:00:53,822 --> 01:00:56,191
We'll have paella, takoyaki,

1758
01:00:56,192 --> 01:00:58,422
the kielbasa burger, and the other dishes.

1759
01:00:59,262 --> 01:01:00,991
(Empty)

1760
01:01:00,992 --> 01:01:02,591
Why are we two men sitting down...

1761
01:01:02,592 --> 01:01:03,961
while you women...

1762
01:01:03,962 --> 01:01:05,832
We just have a lot of questions.

1763
01:01:06,672 --> 01:01:08,272
They're so funny.

1764
01:01:08,902 --> 01:01:10,872
What time do you open?

1765
01:01:11,072 --> 01:01:12,971
- Yes, for business.
- We start at 7am.

1766
01:01:12,972 --> 01:01:13,972
- That early?
- At 7am?

1767
01:01:13,973 --> 01:01:15,441
All the stands here open at 5am.

1768
01:01:15,442 --> 01:01:17,041
You must be so exhausted today.

1769
01:01:17,042 --> 01:01:19,041
(You must be so exhausted today.)

1770
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:20,481
Why are they acting like that?

1771
01:01:20,482 --> 01:01:22,111
What do you mean?

1772
01:01:22,112 --> 01:01:23,722
Wait, look over there.

1773
01:01:24,022 --> 01:01:25,782
Since when did we have this many women on our staff?

1774
01:01:26,592 --> 01:01:28,791
- How did they all gather here?
- Meanwhile, the men went inside.

1775
01:01:28,792 --> 01:01:30,062
This is so funny.

1776
01:01:30,322 --> 01:01:33,021
Since when did we have this many women on our staff?

1777
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:34,731
I can't seem to walk away from them.

1778
01:01:34,732 --> 01:01:35,861
I just can't walk away.

1779
01:01:35,862 --> 01:01:37,101
We have to analyze this place.

1780
01:01:37,102 --> 01:01:38,801
- We can't do that at the table.
- We have to talk to the owners.

1781
01:01:38,802 --> 01:01:39,872
- Right.
- We have to talk to them.

1782
01:01:41,132 --> 01:01:43,002
What are you doing over there?

1783
01:01:43,172 --> 01:01:45,642
- We have to sharply analyze.
- That's right.

1784
01:01:46,042 --> 01:01:47,411
We're inferring.

1785
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:49,241
We're working right now.

1786
01:01:49,242 --> 01:01:51,682
I'm curious. How did you get the permit for your stand?

1787
01:01:51,742 --> 01:01:52,911
How did you get the permit for your stand?

1788
01:01:52,912 --> 01:01:55,481
The market has a merchants' association.

1789
01:01:55,482 --> 01:01:57,121
We called them and got our permit.

1790
01:01:57,122 --> 01:01:58,251
- You called them?
- Yes.

1791
01:01:58,252 --> 01:01:59,252
(He didn't hesitate to answer.)

1792
01:01:59,253 --> 01:02:01,091
- We had to do an interview.
- An interview?

1793
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:02,521
- You're not just given one?
- No.

1794
01:02:02,522 --> 01:02:03,991
- You're not just given one?
- No.

1795
01:02:03,992 --> 01:02:05,522
I'm sorry, but are you members of their fan club?

1796
01:02:06,562 --> 01:02:07,791
- Are you the president?
- We're working.

1797
01:02:07,792 --> 01:02:08,792
Are you the president of the fan club?

1798
01:02:08,793 --> 01:02:10,901
- We're working right now.
- It's part of work.

1799
01:02:10,902 --> 01:02:12,331
We have to find out...

1800
01:02:12,332 --> 01:02:13,632
- if this place is real or not.
- Gosh.

1801
01:02:14,532 --> 01:02:16,771
You're not trying to find out if they're fake.

1802
01:02:16,772 --> 01:02:18,271
Are you here to eat? We're here to work.

1803
01:02:18,272 --> 01:02:19,272
Gosh.

1804
01:02:19,642 --> 01:02:22,112
(Just then, he reaches out to put the takoyaki on the plate.)

1805
01:02:22,772 --> 01:02:24,082
See? This is what we're here to see.

1806
01:02:24,442 --> 01:02:25,442
See? This is what we're here to see.

1807
01:02:25,443 --> 01:02:26,851
Gosh, I want to help him.

1808
01:02:26,852 --> 01:02:28,411
- Goodness.
- It's smushed.

1809
01:02:28,412 --> 01:02:30,521
Takoyaki sellers usually have a delicate touch.

1810
01:02:30,522 --> 01:02:32,021
- It's okay even if he's clumsy.
- Their hands are...

1811
01:02:32,022 --> 01:02:34,091
(It's okay even if he's clumsy.)

1812
01:02:34,092 --> 01:02:35,092
It's okay?

1813
01:02:35,152 --> 01:02:36,352
"It's okay even if he's clumsy?"

1814
01:02:36,522 --> 01:02:38,122
- It's okay even if he's clumsy.
- It's okay even if he's clumsy.

1815
01:02:39,222 --> 01:02:41,491
She has never said such a thing before.

1816
01:02:41,492 --> 01:02:43,361
The four of them are ridiculous.

1817
01:02:43,362 --> 01:02:44,562
Gosh. Seriously.

1818
01:02:44,662 --> 01:02:45,761
We'll go there.

1819
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:46,771
(We'll go there later.)

1820
01:02:46,772 --> 01:02:48,832
- What's the most popular?
- Give us a minute.

1821
01:02:49,032 --> 01:02:51,541
- Dumplings.
- The hamburger guy looks so lonely.

1822
01:02:51,542 --> 01:02:52,871
We should talk to the burger guy too.

1823
01:02:52,872 --> 01:02:54,411
The burger guy looks so lonely.

1824
01:02:54,412 --> 01:02:57,211
- The burger guy is handsome.
- He has already sold a lot.

1825
01:02:57,212 --> 01:02:58,212
- Really?
- He sold many burgers?

1826
01:02:58,213 --> 01:03:01,012
Him being lonely has nothing to do with you.

1827
01:03:01,852 --> 01:03:02,852
Seriously.

1828
01:03:02,852 --> 01:03:03,852
(Seriously. What's wrong with them?)

1829
01:03:03,853 --> 01:03:05,681
- Let's get inside.
- This way.

1830
01:03:05,682 --> 01:03:07,621
Really? Should I do that?

1831
01:03:07,622 --> 01:03:09,691
Why are you all smiling after getting here?

1832
01:03:09,692 --> 01:03:10,722
I don't know. It's just so much fun.

1833
01:03:11,322 --> 01:03:13,862
Na Ra might even have a meal here.

1834
01:03:14,062 --> 01:03:16,701
- She'll eat for sure.
- It already looks tasty.

1835
01:03:16,702 --> 01:03:19,361
- She'll eat now.
- This place looks so fake.

1836
01:03:19,362 --> 01:03:21,101
- I know. Who would...
- It's so fake.

1837
01:03:21,102 --> 01:03:22,801
It's obviously fake.

1838
01:03:22,802 --> 01:03:24,141
- Nara said, - Yes.

1839
01:03:24,142 --> 01:03:25,272
"Even if it's fake, it's okay."

1840
01:03:26,172 --> 01:03:27,512
- "It's okay to make mistakes." - "It's okay to be clumsy."

1841
01:03:27,972 --> 01:03:29,141
- It's all good.
- "It's okay to be clumsy."

1842
01:03:29,142 --> 01:03:31,611
- "It's okay to be clumsy." - They are clumsy, and...

1843
01:03:31,612 --> 01:03:34,312
the paella looks like...

1844
01:03:34,882 --> 01:03:38,121
as if a chef cooked it and told them to place toppings.

1845
01:03:38,122 --> 01:03:40,152
It looks like it's for show.

1846
01:03:40,252 --> 01:03:42,021
They can hear you, Kyoung Pyo.

1847
01:03:42,022 --> 01:03:44,122
(Protecting the owners)

1848
01:03:44,262 --> 01:03:46,992
Kyoung Pyo, why do you talk so much when you were quiet before?

1849
01:03:47,062 --> 01:03:48,062
I...

1850
01:03:48,332 --> 01:03:49,491
- I was...
- "Why do you talk so much?"

1851
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:52,062
(He got roasted for speaking.)

1852
01:03:52,962 --> 01:03:56,272
(Staring)

1853
01:03:57,142 --> 01:03:58,241
(Glancing)

1854
01:03:58,242 --> 01:03:59,301
So Min.

1855
01:03:59,302 --> 01:04:00,441
- Stop looking.
- Say something.

1856
01:04:00,442 --> 01:04:01,471
(Stop looking at the owners and say something.)

1857
01:04:01,472 --> 01:04:03,482
- Was So Min this quiet?
- I mean...

1858
01:04:03,782 --> 01:04:06,111
Gosh, she... So Min.

1859
01:04:06,112 --> 01:04:07,381
- I'm analyzing.
- She didn't say anything...

1860
01:04:07,382 --> 01:04:08,482
- Really?
- Yes.

1861
01:04:08,982 --> 01:04:11,781
(A truly mellow analysis)

1862
01:04:11,782 --> 01:04:14,651
Isn't it funny that they're being plainly fake?

1863
01:04:14,652 --> 01:04:16,052
Right. That's true too.

1864
01:04:16,152 --> 01:04:18,161
They can be real since they're clumsy.

1865
01:04:18,162 --> 01:04:19,921
We were always fooled by how real they were.

1866
01:04:19,922 --> 01:04:21,762
Because of that,

1867
01:04:22,462 --> 01:04:25,331
they might have contacted a fake-looking place deliberately.

1868
01:04:25,332 --> 01:04:26,831
- Exactly. That's a possibility.
- As a trap.

1869
01:04:26,832 --> 01:04:29,132
- They've run it for three months.
- The timing is peculiar.

1870
01:04:29,502 --> 01:04:32,572
(It might be real because it looks so fake.)

1871
01:04:32,772 --> 01:04:34,841
- Can we serve the food now?
- Yes. Please do.

1872
01:04:34,842 --> 01:04:36,112
- Thank you.
- Here's the paella.

1873
01:04:36,172 --> 01:04:38,512
- I'm curious about this paella.
- Yes.

1874
01:04:39,712 --> 01:04:42,112
(A 1m mega-sized calUdron paella)

1875
01:04:42,612 --> 01:04:44,252
At the Chatuchak Market in Bangkok,

1876
01:04:44,352 --> 01:04:46,851
they sell paella made in a big pot.

1877
01:04:46,852 --> 01:04:48,392
(The idea was from the huge paella at the Chatuchak Market in Bangkok.)

1878
01:04:48,692 --> 01:04:51,591
I thought I could sell a lot if I made it like that.

1879
01:04:51,592 --> 01:04:52,822
That was how I selected the menu.

1880
01:04:53,532 --> 01:04:55,361
We're making it on a large scale...

1881
01:04:55,362 --> 01:04:57,732
because we want to differentiate ourselves in this market.

1882
01:04:58,162 --> 01:05:00,931
In the market, each shop is close to one another.

1883
01:05:00,932 --> 01:05:03,442
It's hard to be seen in such a situation.

1884
01:05:03,542 --> 01:05:06,342
So as a part of marketing and to make money,

1885
01:05:06,442 --> 01:05:08,811
we started making it showily in a big pan.

1886
01:05:08,812 --> 01:05:09,812
(And this visual of the paella in a 1m iron cauldron was born.)

1887
01:05:10,012 --> 01:05:13,212
(Take a look at the good-looking owner too.)

1888
01:05:13,512 --> 01:05:16,852
(Filled with fresh seafood,)

1889
01:05:17,482 --> 01:05:20,652
(the Mediterranean paella has come to Yangpyeong.)

1890
01:05:21,652 --> 01:05:23,921
(How does the paella made by a handsome chef taste?)

1891
01:05:23,922 --> 01:05:26,021
- Okay. Let's try the popular menu.
- He said it's popular.

1892
01:05:26,022 --> 01:05:27,792
- You should try it first.
- Why?

1893
01:05:28,032 --> 01:05:29,292
- Since you don't have an appetite?
- That's not it.

1894
01:05:30,632 --> 01:05:32,432
Are you doing this based purely on your hunch?

1895
01:05:33,432 --> 01:05:35,101
That's right. It's Sixth Sense, anyway.

1896
01:05:35,102 --> 01:05:37,201
- We should use our hunch.
- Just your hunch?

1897
01:05:37,202 --> 01:05:38,271
Of course.

1898
01:05:38,272 --> 01:05:39,441
So Min.

1899
01:05:39,442 --> 01:05:40,472
(So Min, you're good.)

1900
01:05:40,572 --> 01:05:42,312
- I'll try the paella.
- I'll try the burger.

1901
01:05:42,712 --> 01:05:43,712
Paella.

1902
01:05:43,713 --> 01:05:46,382
(They try the paella, the signature menu, first.)

1903
01:05:47,412 --> 01:05:49,112
(Amazed)

1904
01:05:49,212 --> 01:05:51,452
It goes well with the market's vibe.

1905
01:05:52,182 --> 01:05:53,522
- It's not too exotic.
- Really?

1906
01:05:54,592 --> 01:05:56,121
(Flavorful and savory paella absorbed in seafoods' rich flavors)

1907
01:05:56,122 --> 01:05:57,992
This paella is good.

1908
01:05:58,462 --> 01:05:59,991
(Na Ra takes a big bite too.)

1909
01:05:59,992 --> 01:06:01,162
- It's good.
- It's tasty.

1910
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:03,731
It's easy to make.

1911
01:06:03,732 --> 01:06:06,401
- With the help of a chef, - That's right.

1912
01:06:06,402 --> 01:06:07,532
- it's easy to set it up.
- Yes.

1913
01:06:08,072 --> 01:06:11,271
You tend to doubt so much.

1914
01:06:11,272 --> 01:06:12,301
(Kyoung Pyo, you tend to doubt so much.)

1915
01:06:12,302 --> 01:06:14,711
Na Ra, you have to get a grip.

1916
01:06:14,712 --> 01:06:16,041
- We're here to do so.
- Na Ra.

1917
01:06:16,042 --> 01:06:17,341
Wake up. Why don't you eat something?

1918
01:06:17,342 --> 01:06:18,412
Isn't it because you haven't been eating?

1919
01:06:19,512 --> 01:06:20,682
Na Ra is a guardian spirit right now.

1920
01:06:22,752 --> 01:06:24,822
- She just can't eat.
- "A guardian spirit."

1921
01:06:26,022 --> 01:06:28,651
- It's okay to be clumsy.
- Is it okay?

1922
01:06:28,652 --> 01:06:29,692
(I'll protect you.)

1923
01:06:29,722 --> 01:06:31,061
- Takoyaki.
- Yes.

1924
01:06:31,062 --> 01:06:32,062
- Let's try it.
- They said it's popular.

1925
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:33,861
- It's popular.
- Here are the dumplings.

1926
01:06:33,862 --> 01:06:35,132
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1927
01:06:35,162 --> 01:06:37,401
(A steady seller at the market)

1928
01:06:37,402 --> 01:06:40,231
(Dumplings and takoyaki)

1929
01:06:40,232 --> 01:06:43,872
(Shifting the conventional paradigm)

1930
01:06:44,072 --> 01:06:46,172
(What differentiates Five Handsome Owners?)

1931
01:06:46,502 --> 01:06:48,372
Dumplings are popular at markets.

1932
01:06:48,472 --> 01:06:51,382
What's interesting is that ours doesn't have dumpling wrappers.

1933
01:06:52,542 --> 01:06:56,051
Basically, we add meat, chives, glass noodles,

1934
01:06:56,052 --> 01:06:57,382
and others.

1935
01:06:57,822 --> 01:06:58,851
(Unlike the dumplings that are labor-intensive to make...)

1936
01:06:58,852 --> 01:07:01,122
It takes a long time to make and steam them.

1937
01:07:01,652 --> 01:07:03,761
As we're in a market, to serve them as fast as possible,

1938
01:07:03,762 --> 01:07:05,291
we've decided to sell dumpling balls.

1939
01:07:05,292 --> 01:07:06,422
(Without wrappers, they're rolled in starch.)

1940
01:07:06,862 --> 01:07:09,332
(Dumpling balls without wrappers)

1941
01:07:09,462 --> 01:07:10,961
(What about takoyaki?)

1942
01:07:10,962 --> 01:07:12,602
As you know,

1943
01:07:12,732 --> 01:07:14,172
takoyaki is Japanese food.

1944
01:07:14,572 --> 01:07:16,672
I wanted to reinterpret it in a Korean way.

1945
01:07:17,002 --> 01:07:18,641
(They sautee garlic scapes and dried shrimp.)

1946
01:07:18,642 --> 01:07:21,512
So we sautee garlic scapes and dried shrimp together...

1947
01:07:22,612 --> 01:07:25,011
and add them as a topping in place of bonito flakes.

1948
01:07:25,012 --> 01:07:26,982
(It is used as a topping in place of bonito flakes.)

1949
01:07:27,382 --> 01:07:30,752
(How do unconventional dumpling balls and takoyaki taste?)

1950
01:07:30,782 --> 01:07:32,452
The dumpling balls smell good.

1951
01:07:33,082 --> 01:07:34,552
(After blowing it...)

1952
01:07:36,722 --> 01:07:37,762
It's good.

1953
01:07:37,922 --> 01:07:40,392
- Kimchi dumpling ball is good.
- Yes. It's really good.

1954
01:07:41,592 --> 01:07:44,802
(Kimchi dumpling balls with ultimate umami)

1955
01:07:44,862 --> 01:07:45,901
(Pop-eyed)

1956
01:07:45,902 --> 01:07:47,002
You agree, right?

1957
01:07:47,032 --> 01:07:48,102
It's good.

1958
01:07:48,432 --> 01:07:50,842
(Taking a bite of takoyaki as well)

1959
01:07:51,342 --> 01:07:53,002
(Savoring)

1960
01:07:53,242 --> 01:07:56,641
(How does Childish Yu with a kid's taste bud like it?)

1961
01:07:56,642 --> 01:07:58,711
(Savoring)

1962
01:07:58,712 --> 01:08:01,481
Gosh. I've never seen takoyaki topped with garlic scapes.

1963
01:08:01,482 --> 01:08:02,552
And shrimp.

1964
01:08:02,652 --> 01:08:03,782
- Is there shrimp? Dried shrimp?
- Dried shrimp.

1965
01:08:04,652 --> 01:08:06,852
(Kochelin Kyoung Pyo with a sharp taste bud...)

1966
01:08:07,052 --> 01:08:08,852
(gives it a nod.)

1967
01:08:09,022 --> 01:08:11,122
It has changed from the original version.

1968
01:08:12,222 --> 01:08:16,392
(Takoyaki with a light taste and a good texture)

1969
01:08:16,492 --> 01:08:18,262
The garlic scapes make it less oily.

1970
01:08:18,632 --> 01:08:20,402
And it adds a crunchy texture.

1971
01:08:21,532 --> 01:08:23,701
After tasting it, we have to ask...

1972
01:08:23,702 --> 01:08:25,641
how they studied and came up with the menus.

1973
01:08:25,642 --> 01:08:27,442
I know. Who developed the menus?

1974
01:08:28,112 --> 01:08:29,772
- Customers are here.
- Right.

1975
01:08:30,342 --> 01:08:32,142
(Turning heads)

1976
01:08:32,242 --> 01:08:33,811
- Do you want some?
- Yes. Three, please.

1977
01:08:33,812 --> 01:08:34,881
- Okay.
- One of each.

1978
01:08:34,882 --> 01:08:36,681
We'll get you 1 of each. It's 16.6 dollars.

1979
01:08:36,682 --> 01:08:37,921
(He gets the money in a natural way.)

1980
01:08:37,922 --> 01:08:39,582
It feels like the staff has hired them.

1981
01:08:39,952 --> 01:08:41,752
They told him to buy them now.

1982
01:08:42,422 --> 01:08:43,552
Hello.

1983
01:08:43,992 --> 01:08:46,362
- Hello.
- Yes, hello.

1984
01:08:47,132 --> 01:08:48,892
Do you come here often?

1985
01:08:49,132 --> 01:08:51,631
- I've been here a couple of times.
- Really?

1986
01:08:51,632 --> 01:08:53,301
I've come a couple of times. It's really tasty.

1987
01:08:53,302 --> 01:08:54,302
Really?

1988
01:08:55,932 --> 01:08:58,102
(It's real, then.)

1989
01:08:58,272 --> 01:09:00,512
If they've been running the place for three months, it makes sense.

1990
01:09:01,342 --> 01:09:04,482
(Are they customers hired by the staff?)

1991
01:09:04,582 --> 01:09:05,682
Should I cut the burger?

1992
01:09:06,812 --> 01:09:07,852
We have to try the burger.

1993
01:09:08,152 --> 01:09:10,322
It's good-looking.

1994
01:09:11,082 --> 01:09:12,082
That's my first choice.

1995
01:09:12,882 --> 01:09:15,122
(What are you talking about?)

1996
01:09:15,592 --> 01:09:16,852
- My first choice.
- What's up with you?

1997
01:09:18,092 --> 01:09:20,361
- The burger isn't good-looking.
- "Good-looking?" What?

1998
01:09:20,362 --> 01:09:21,491
It's my first choice.

1999
01:09:21,492 --> 01:09:23,191
- Is that your first choice?
- Yes, it is.

2000
01:09:23,192 --> 01:09:25,102
You're not on a blind date right now.

2001
01:09:26,462 --> 01:09:29,172
(Mimi's first choice is the burger guy.)

2002
01:09:29,302 --> 01:09:30,541
- Of the five owners, he's the one.
- Hey.

2003
01:09:30,542 --> 01:09:32,402
The burger looks very unique.

2004
01:09:32,702 --> 01:09:33,771
- It looks good.
- Look.

2005
01:09:33,772 --> 01:09:36,242
It has a horseshoe-shaped sausage in it.

2006
01:09:36,612 --> 01:09:38,012
- Gosh. That's interesting.
- Interesting.

2007
01:09:38,312 --> 01:09:39,441
(What is his secret?)

2008
01:09:39,442 --> 01:09:42,312
It may look like an ordinary burger you see in the streets.

2009
01:09:43,782 --> 01:09:46,622
But I use a brioche bun, which is softer than a normal bun.

2010
01:09:48,992 --> 01:09:51,662
I use a horseshoe-shaped kielbasa sausage,

2011
01:09:52,122 --> 01:09:54,491
which is much juicier and has a richer flavor.

2012
01:09:54,492 --> 01:09:56,632
(Giving it richer flavors with kielbasa sausages)

2013
01:09:57,832 --> 01:10:00,001
Because I put a generous amount of the ingredients,

2014
01:10:00,002 --> 01:10:01,031
(Adding a patty on the crunchy cabbage)

2015
01:10:01,032 --> 01:10:03,671
customers order it frequently as a good-value meal.

2016
01:10:03,672 --> 01:10:05,602
(A kielbasa burger that is good for a meal)

2017
01:10:06,042 --> 01:10:09,112
(How does the juicy kielbasa burger taste?)

2018
01:10:09,512 --> 01:10:12,612
(Taking a mouthful)

2019
01:10:13,082 --> 01:10:14,082
Hey.

2020
01:10:15,682 --> 01:10:16,882
The burger tastes good.

2021
01:10:17,182 --> 01:10:18,322
We're on a show to eat.

2022
01:10:18,422 --> 01:10:19,551
The burger tastes good.

2023
01:10:19,552 --> 01:10:20,622
(Let me try it too.)

2024
01:10:21,422 --> 01:10:23,121
- Hey.
- It's good.

2025
01:10:23,122 --> 01:10:24,922
- The burger is good.
- The burger is tasty.

2026
01:10:25,262 --> 01:10:26,522
- The burger is good.
- Is it good?

2027
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:28,762
(Eye-opening)

2028
01:10:28,862 --> 01:10:31,531
- They use a really tasty bun.
- It's good.

2029
01:10:31,532 --> 01:10:33,062
- The bun tastes good.
- That's right.

2030
01:10:33,132 --> 01:10:34,502
The bun is tasty.

2031
01:10:34,572 --> 01:10:36,771
I don't think it's something young guys can make.

2032
01:10:36,772 --> 01:10:38,601
- It's not a bun from a market.
- It's not.

2033
01:10:38,602 --> 01:10:39,841
What? Why is this burger so good?

2034
01:10:39,842 --> 01:10:41,472
Why is this burger so good, right?

2035
01:10:41,572 --> 01:10:42,711
- It tastes like "Why is it good?" - It's good, right?

2036
01:10:42,712 --> 01:10:44,342
It makes you feel and think, "Why is it good?"

2037
01:10:44,482 --> 01:10:47,151
- Gosh. This is the best one today.
- Yes.

2038
01:10:47,152 --> 01:10:49,182
By the way, look at the price.

2039
01:10:49,382 --> 01:10:50,522
How much is it?

2040
01:10:50,552 --> 01:10:51,721
The burger is 5.5 dollars.

2041
01:10:51,722 --> 01:10:52,722
- For this?
- It's cheap.

2042
01:10:52,723 --> 01:10:53,752
Yes.

2043
01:10:53,852 --> 01:10:55,721
They won't make a profit if they sell it like that.

2044
01:10:55,722 --> 01:10:57,191
Selling it for 5.5 dollars...

2045
01:10:57,192 --> 01:10:58,662
- doesn't make sense...
- The pricing of it is...

2046
01:10:58,862 --> 01:10:59,862
At a market...

2047
01:10:59,863 --> 01:11:01,462
The former fake restaurants' price was...

2048
01:11:01,762 --> 01:11:02,762
- always...
- It was cheap.

2049
01:11:02,763 --> 01:11:04,032
The pricing didn't make sense.

2050
01:11:04,302 --> 01:11:06,101
We were talking about how cheap...

2051
01:11:06,102 --> 01:11:07,332
- the ice cream-tteokbokki was.
- Right.

2052
01:11:08,102 --> 01:11:09,901
- They have to prepare each of them.
- They might buy...

2053
01:11:09,902 --> 01:11:11,171
- the sausages.
- It's tasty.

2054
01:11:11,172 --> 01:11:12,442
I'll go and ask.

2055
01:11:13,812 --> 01:11:14,971
- I mean...
- So Min.

2056
01:11:14,972 --> 01:11:16,111
I'll ask...

2057
01:11:16,112 --> 01:11:17,241
- where they get the bun from.
- Okay.

2058
01:11:17,242 --> 01:11:18,841
- I have to go with her.
- She's so enthusiastic.

2059
01:11:18,842 --> 01:11:19,912
Mimi left too.

2060
01:11:20,712 --> 01:11:22,552
(The blunt brother finds it hilarious.)

2061
01:11:22,712 --> 01:11:24,252
Mimi and So Min...

2062
01:11:24,852 --> 01:11:25,922
have the same first choice.

2063
01:11:26,222 --> 01:11:27,552
- It's hilarious.
- They have the same taste.

2064
01:11:27,592 --> 01:11:28,792
- Gosh.
- It's the same.

2065
01:11:29,222 --> 01:11:32,421
I used to work at a Western food restaurant.

2066
01:11:32,422 --> 01:11:33,762
You worked at a restaurant that sold Western foods?

2067
01:11:33,832 --> 01:11:35,132
The bun itself is tasty.

2068
01:11:35,392 --> 01:11:37,231
- Which bun is it?
- It's a brioche bun.

2069
01:11:37,232 --> 01:11:38,962
- It's a brioche bun.
- Yes.

2070
01:11:39,132 --> 01:11:41,971
- It's kielbasa.
- Do you know it?

2071
01:11:41,972 --> 01:11:43,031
I know kielbasa sausages.

2072
01:11:43,032 --> 01:11:44,241
(The happy time and space of their own)

2073
01:11:44,242 --> 01:11:45,402
It gives a huge kick. Gosh.

2074
01:11:46,672 --> 01:11:48,112
- What?
- The ingredients themselves...

2075
01:11:48,442 --> 01:11:49,572
- What about them?
- Are they amazing?

2076
01:11:49,842 --> 01:11:51,042
According to my burger brother,

2077
01:11:51,582 --> 01:11:54,152
the sausage gives it a kick.

2078
01:11:54,512 --> 01:11:56,352
- "My burger brother?" - "My burger brother."

2079
01:11:56,512 --> 01:11:57,622
When did he become your brother?

2080
01:11:57,952 --> 01:11:59,222
I thought I heard it wrong.

2081
01:11:59,852 --> 01:12:01,152
- There's your burger brother here?
- "My burger brother?"

2082
01:12:01,192 --> 01:12:03,052
- He looks much younger than you.
- Right.

2083
01:12:03,592 --> 01:12:04,791
After looking at his face,

2084
01:12:04,792 --> 01:12:06,022
- he becomes your brother.
- Really?

2085
01:12:06,922 --> 01:12:09,392
(If one's handsome, they can be one's brother.)

2086
01:12:09,632 --> 01:12:11,632
- We should try the ramyeon.
- Let's have it.

2087
01:12:13,362 --> 01:12:15,732
I didn't want to sell ordinary ramyeon.

2088
01:12:16,432 --> 01:12:19,442
So I thought of putting ramyeon in braised chicken.

2089
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:23,112
I cook the rooster in boiling water for an hour.

2090
01:12:23,742 --> 01:12:26,111
I add the seasoning to the broth...

2091
01:12:26,112 --> 01:12:27,711
to make it spicy.

2092
01:12:27,712 --> 01:12:32,422
(A spicy flavor that hits the spot)

2093
01:12:33,122 --> 01:12:36,292
(The noodles are cooked to al dente.)

2094
01:12:36,752 --> 01:12:38,221
To put a cherry on my ramyeon,

2095
01:12:38,222 --> 01:12:41,162
I add a whole chicken leg with a smoky flavor from a blow torch.

2096
01:12:41,632 --> 01:12:44,002
(Diving into ramyeon)

2097
01:12:44,432 --> 01:12:45,461
(Somewhere between ramyeon and braised chicken,)

2098
01:12:45,462 --> 01:12:48,731
It's a fused ramyeon that feels like braised chicken.

2099
01:12:48,732 --> 01:12:50,072
(braised chicken ramyeon)

2100
01:12:51,102 --> 01:12:54,372
(How do the members, the ramyeon lovers, think of it?)

2101
01:12:54,742 --> 01:12:57,482
(The ramyeon expert takes a sip first.)

2102
01:12:57,742 --> 01:12:58,812
Gosh. The broth is nice.

2103
01:13:01,652 --> 01:13:02,712
It's good.

2104
01:13:03,352 --> 01:13:04,352
It tastes a bit...

2105
01:13:04,982 --> 01:13:07,322
- like the spicy braised chicken.
- Yes. This one is good.

2106
01:13:07,452 --> 01:13:09,421
- It's good.
- The broth of the ramyeon...

2107
01:13:09,422 --> 01:13:10,452
- is amazing.
- I know.

2108
01:13:12,322 --> 01:13:14,091
You can taste the chicken in the soup, right?

2109
01:13:14,092 --> 01:13:15,162
(The rich chicken broth)

2110
01:13:15,932 --> 01:13:18,202
(They securely grab the noodles.)

2111
01:13:19,432 --> 01:13:21,701
(Slurping)

2112
01:13:21,702 --> 01:13:22,772
The ramyeon is good too.

2113
01:13:22,902 --> 01:13:23,972
This one is good.

2114
01:13:24,172 --> 01:13:26,542
Gosh. It tastes just like the spicy braised chicken.

2115
01:13:27,142 --> 01:13:28,211
(Let me take a bite too.)

2116
01:13:28,212 --> 01:13:31,442
- Business is about making profits.
- Exactly.

2117
01:13:31,642 --> 01:13:33,141
They said they make 10,000 dollars a month.

2118
01:13:33,142 --> 01:13:34,712
That means this has to be over ten dollars.

2119
01:13:35,652 --> 01:13:36,711
(She gives it a try again.)

2120
01:13:36,712 --> 01:13:37,781
But as for the first restaurant,

2121
01:13:37,782 --> 01:13:39,552
one person can't create the place alone...

2122
01:13:40,182 --> 01:13:41,451
(She tastes it again.)

2123
01:13:41,452 --> 01:13:42,721
- All by himself.
- Right.

2124
01:13:42,722 --> 01:13:43,822
This broth is strange.

2125
01:13:43,922 --> 01:13:44,922
This broth is strange.

2126
01:13:44,923 --> 01:13:46,722
(This broth is strange.)

2127
01:13:47,062 --> 01:13:48,862
This broth is strange. I can't stop having it.

2128
01:13:49,392 --> 01:13:52,302
It's extraordinary. It's so...

2129
01:13:52,402 --> 01:13:54,732
I think someone else created this one too.

2130
01:13:55,232 --> 01:13:56,601
- Right?
- Yes. It's...

2131
01:13:56,602 --> 01:13:58,741
Don't you remember this flavor? When we were on Sixth Sense,

2132
01:13:58,742 --> 01:14:01,412
we had braised chicken ramyeon.

2133
01:14:01,512 --> 01:14:03,042
- Right.
- Doesn't it taste like it?

2134
01:14:03,842 --> 01:14:07,281
(During Season 1, 5 years ago,)

2135
01:14:07,282 --> 01:14:08,812
It's such a pretty place.

2136
01:14:09,652 --> 01:14:14,992
(fake braised chicken ramyeon captivated everyone.)

2137
01:14:16,122 --> 01:14:18,022
- That's right, Na Ra.
- Yes. It tastes similar to that.

2138
01:14:18,392 --> 01:14:20,261
- Will that owner come later?
- I wondered where I had it.

2139
01:14:20,262 --> 01:14:21,532
That's possible.

2140
01:14:22,032 --> 01:14:24,501
- It's a reattempt.
- "Jae Seok, do you remember them?"

2141
01:14:24,502 --> 01:14:27,162
- Hey. It sounds about right.
- Gosh. That's possible.

2142
01:14:28,172 --> 01:14:30,742
(Ramyeon dishes have always captivated us.)

2143
01:14:31,342 --> 01:14:34,272
(Is this braised chicken ramyeon fake too?)

2144
01:14:34,772 --> 01:14:37,171
But will they serve something that's so obviously fake?

2145
01:14:37,172 --> 01:14:38,482
- I know.
- That's weird too.

2146
01:14:38,882 --> 01:14:40,342
- They're confusing us.
- It's confusing.

2147
01:14:41,482 --> 01:14:43,381
But they were good. The burger was especially good.

2148
01:14:43,382 --> 01:14:45,351
When I saw the visuals, I didn't expect them to be tasty.

2149
01:14:45,352 --> 01:14:46,621
But they were good.

2150
01:14:46,622 --> 01:14:47,622
(Easy-to-fake 3 months experience, Isolated, Too fancy for the price)

2151
01:14:48,122 --> 01:14:50,521
- Hey, what was the last one?
- It was steam something.

2152
01:14:50,522 --> 01:14:51,862
- It's Steam and Eat.
- Steam and Eat.

2153
01:14:52,962 --> 01:14:54,831
- Will they steam the rice?
- Steam and Eat?

2154
01:14:54,832 --> 01:14:56,232
- Is it a steamed meal?
- Steam and Eat.

2155
01:14:56,432 --> 01:14:58,732
I've heard of ssambap but not Steam and Eat.

2156
01:14:59,302 --> 01:15:01,172
Are we going to jjimjilbang, a sauna?

2157
01:15:02,102 --> 01:15:04,242
Is it a restaurant in the sauna?

2158
01:15:04,572 --> 01:15:05,871
A restaurant in the sauna?

2159
01:15:05,872 --> 01:15:07,241
(A place to eat in a sauna?)

2160
01:15:07,242 --> 01:15:10,311
- But they do sell food in a sauna.
- Like seaweed soup and sikhye.

2161
01:15:10,312 --> 01:15:11,581
- That's right.
- What if it's something...

2162
01:15:11,582 --> 01:15:12,781
you don't get in the sauna?

2163
01:15:12,782 --> 01:15:13,782
- Something you can't have.
- Right.

2164
01:15:13,783 --> 01:15:14,811
Usually, you have seaweed soup.

2165
01:15:14,812 --> 01:15:16,451
- Right?
- Do they make steak cooked...

2166
01:15:16,452 --> 01:15:18,922
- by a Michelin-starred chef?
- A Western food?

2167
01:15:19,022 --> 01:15:21,292
Will they grill meat in the sauna?

2168
01:15:22,852 --> 01:15:25,562
- Five Handsome Owners. Gosh.
- Inside the sauna...

2169
01:15:25,762 --> 01:15:27,291
(Why does he bring up the last one suddenly?)

2170
01:15:27,292 --> 01:15:28,761
- You are displeased with it.
- Gosh.

2171
01:15:28,762 --> 01:15:29,831
(Displeased)

2172
01:15:29,832 --> 01:15:32,161
- The name of it is already...
- Jae Seok...

2173
01:15:32,162 --> 01:15:34,832
was upset because we talked to them so much.

2174
01:15:35,202 --> 01:15:37,542
He's angry because he can't be one of them.

2175
01:15:38,302 --> 01:15:40,342
- That's right.
- Come on.

2176
01:15:41,842 --> 01:15:44,941
So Min and Mimi.

2177
01:15:44,942 --> 01:15:46,041
- Yes.
- Yes.

2178
01:15:46,042 --> 01:15:49,212
When you went and asked, why did you go all the way...

2179
01:15:49,982 --> 01:15:52,352
to the guy who served us the burger?

2180
01:15:52,722 --> 01:15:54,822
- It was the most tasty one.
- It seemed to shine the most.

2181
01:15:54,922 --> 01:15:56,291
- Really?
- It was eye-catching.

2182
01:15:56,292 --> 01:15:57,662
I liked the burger the most.

2183
01:15:57,762 --> 01:15:59,561
They are so brazen.

2184
01:15:59,562 --> 01:16:01,661
If I went to the shiniest one,

2185
01:16:01,662 --> 01:16:03,292
I would have gone to the takoyaki brother.

2186
01:16:03,492 --> 01:16:06,302
Why do you keep calling them brothers? Gosh.

2187
01:16:06,402 --> 01:16:08,871
- It's hard to call them...
- Why?

2188
01:16:08,872 --> 01:16:10,941
- when I'd never met them before.
- That's why.

2189
01:16:10,942 --> 01:16:12,001
- Yes.
- That's true.

2190
01:16:12,002 --> 01:16:13,802
(While talking about the handsome ones...)

2191
01:16:13,902 --> 01:16:15,572
Wasn't Jae Seok so hot in the past?

2192
01:16:15,842 --> 01:16:16,912
- Which part?
- Yes.

2193
01:16:17,372 --> 01:16:18,611
- He's cool.
- Which part?

2194
01:16:18,612 --> 01:16:19,941
- I'm not cool.
- I'm talking about everything,

2195
01:16:19,942 --> 01:16:21,051
- including his fashion.
- He's tall too.

2196
01:16:21,052 --> 01:16:22,551
Do you know the video of him in the elevator?

2197
01:16:22,552 --> 01:16:23,982
The one where the doors open?

2198
01:16:24,382 --> 01:16:26,482
(The video of Jae Seok's heyday is coming soon.)

2199
01:16:27,852 --> 01:16:32,362
(Fatally sexy)

2200
01:16:32,562 --> 01:16:34,131
Based on his looks,

2201
01:16:34,132 --> 01:16:35,861
I can't believe he wasn't popular back then.

2202
01:16:35,862 --> 01:16:37,631
- Why not?
- He was cool.

2203
01:16:37,632 --> 01:16:40,602
You'd understand if you were with him back then.

2204
01:16:40,902 --> 01:16:42,231
Only a true friend can say that.

2205
01:16:42,232 --> 01:16:44,942
Hey, CEO Song. You're striking me with a fact.

2206
01:16:46,072 --> 01:16:47,542
You're beating me so much with the fact.

2207
01:16:48,812 --> 01:16:50,311
- Did you get beaten up?
- Yes.

2208
01:16:50,312 --> 01:16:51,481
(They're already close to the third trendy place.)

2209
01:16:51,482 --> 01:16:54,981
- This place is... Yes.
- There's nothing much around.

2210
01:16:54,982 --> 01:16:56,281
- There are just...
- It's in the middle of nowhere.

2211
01:16:56,282 --> 01:16:58,982
fields and farms everywhere.

2212
01:16:59,222 --> 01:17:01,921
- It's not a place for a restaurant.
- No.

2213
01:17:01,922 --> 01:17:03,191
- What? We're going up.
- Gosh.

2214
01:17:03,192 --> 01:17:04,921
- Are you going up?
- We're going up.

2215
01:17:04,922 --> 01:17:06,392
- This must be it.
- What is this place?

2216
01:17:07,792 --> 01:17:08,961
It's on the high ground.

2217
01:17:08,962 --> 01:17:10,901
- Yes. It's high in altitude.
- Right?

2218
01:17:10,902 --> 01:17:13,202
(They're going further upward.)

2219
01:17:14,272 --> 01:17:16,772
- Is it a campsite?
- A campsite?

2220
01:17:17,502 --> 01:17:19,471
It's normal for a campsite to be here.

2221
01:17:19,472 --> 01:17:21,112
That's right. It's possible.

2222
01:17:22,442 --> 01:17:24,942
- I think we're almost there.
- We're here.

2223
01:17:25,612 --> 01:17:27,652
- Someone's wearing sauna clothes.
- Gosh.

2224
01:17:27,882 --> 01:17:29,651
- Someone's wearing sauna clothes.
- Gosh.

2225
01:17:29,652 --> 01:17:31,121
- Really?
- They do wear it.

2226
01:17:31,122 --> 01:17:32,652
- There's one.
- Look.

2227
01:17:33,422 --> 01:17:35,752
"Steam" must have come from the steam sauna.

2228
01:17:36,192 --> 01:17:37,891
Mimi loves saunas.

2229
01:17:37,892 --> 01:17:40,091
- Yes. I love it.
- Do you love it?

2230
01:17:40,092 --> 01:17:41,892
I went to the sauna last night too.

2231
01:17:41,992 --> 01:17:43,062
- Really?
- Yes.

2232
01:17:43,362 --> 01:17:46,332
- You go there once a day.
- Yes. I go there almost every day.

2233
01:17:46,462 --> 01:17:49,731
(Is it the sauna, the place Mimi loves?)

2234
01:17:49,732 --> 01:17:51,242
What's in there...

2235
01:17:52,102 --> 01:17:54,211
- I know.
- that is fake? It can't be fake.

2236
01:17:54,212 --> 01:17:55,472
It can't be fake.

2237
01:17:56,242 --> 01:18:00,582
(After opening the doors and getting inside...)

2238
01:18:02,312 --> 01:18:04,751
I have a feeling we have to wear the clothes too.

2239
01:18:04,752 --> 01:18:06,452
- We have to wear them.
- We have to get changed.

2240
01:18:06,882 --> 01:18:08,891
- Hello.
- I love it.

2241
01:18:08,892 --> 01:18:10,891
- This can't be fake.
- I think we're going inside.

2242
01:18:10,892 --> 01:18:13,491
- Women can put the shoes in there.
- Okay.

2243
01:18:13,492 --> 01:18:15,361
- You can use the closets.
- Okay.

2244
01:18:15,362 --> 01:18:16,362
When you go to the side,

2245
01:18:16,363 --> 01:18:17,832
- you can get changed.
- Okay.

2246
01:18:18,532 --> 01:18:19,632
See you later.

2247
01:18:20,162 --> 01:18:22,132
- Yes. See you later.
- See you later.

2248
01:18:24,102 --> 01:18:26,171
- I wore the pants backward.
- Did you?

2249
01:18:26,172 --> 01:18:27,542
(Laughing)

2250
01:18:27,742 --> 01:18:29,671
The pockets faced toward the back.

2251
01:18:29,672 --> 01:18:31,712
- That's how Mimi really speaks.
- Yes.

2252
01:18:31,882 --> 01:18:34,481
- You're so charming, Mimi.
- Thank you.

2253
01:18:34,482 --> 01:18:35,482
You're adorable.

2254
01:18:35,483 --> 01:18:38,082
(They get changed while flirting with each other.)

2255
01:18:38,352 --> 01:18:39,852
The older ones are taking time.

2256
01:18:39,982 --> 01:18:41,722
That's how you wear it around your ankle.

2257
01:18:41,852 --> 01:18:43,752
- Should I do that too?
- Yes, do it.

2258
01:18:45,062 --> 01:18:47,691
- Right around our ankles.
- So Min copies the young ones.

2259
01:18:47,692 --> 01:18:49,862
(The rule of thumb in the sauna's fashion)

2260
01:18:50,362 --> 01:18:52,032
(They enter excitedly.)

2261
01:18:52,902 --> 01:18:54,002
What?

2262
01:18:54,602 --> 01:18:57,402
- Gosh. It's so nice.
- It's pretty.

2263
01:18:57,672 --> 01:18:59,471
Gosh. What is this?

2264
01:18:59,472 --> 01:19:00,672
- Look at the colors.
- Gosh. It's so pretty.

2265
01:19:00,772 --> 01:19:03,512
- Right. A foot bath.
- Gosh. It's so natural.

2266
01:19:03,612 --> 01:19:04,681
- Gosh. It's...
- Amazing.

2267
01:19:04,682 --> 01:19:05,682
I love it.

2268
01:19:06,382 --> 01:19:10,352
(A place located on the foot of Mount Bongmi in Yangpyeong)

2269
01:19:12,152 --> 01:19:14,222
(A gigantic sauna that is 277,700m² large)

2270
01:19:14,792 --> 01:19:16,952
(What is the special spot in this sauna?)

2271
01:19:20,292 --> 01:19:23,892
(A foot bath in a botanical garden)

2272
01:19:24,462 --> 01:19:27,732
(One can put their feet in a warm foot bath...)

2273
01:19:28,532 --> 01:19:31,142
(and enjoy the warm sunlight in this healing paradise.)

2274
01:19:31,602 --> 01:19:34,002
(With a unique concept, it's become Yangpyeong's trendy place.)

2275
01:19:34,472 --> 01:19:36,241
(On top of it,)

2276
01:19:36,242 --> 01:19:38,012
(the entrance is limited to only 150 people a day.)

2277
01:19:38,212 --> 01:19:40,642
(However,)

2278
01:19:41,412 --> 01:19:44,182
(a secret is hidden in this peaceful place.)

2279
01:19:44,722 --> 01:19:47,582
(At a certain time, people gather at one place.)

2280
01:19:47,922 --> 01:19:50,592
(And a person who knows about all these secrets)

2281
01:19:52,222 --> 01:19:53,391
- It's so natural.
- Hey, it's...

2282
01:19:53,392 --> 01:19:54,691
- Amazing.
- I love it.

2283
01:19:54,692 --> 01:19:57,191
- You can bathe in it.
- What is this? It's so nice.

2284
01:19:57,192 --> 01:19:58,531
- Can we go inside?
- You bathe in it, right?

2285
01:19:58,532 --> 01:19:59,862
- Yes. You lie in it.
- Gosh.

2286
01:20:00,362 --> 01:20:01,371
It must be warm.

2287
01:20:01,372 --> 01:20:03,202
(Should we warm our backs while looking at the plants?)

2288
01:20:03,402 --> 01:20:06,002
- Lovely. I should come here again.
- It's nice.

2289
01:20:06,302 --> 01:20:08,212
- It's nice.
- It's warm.

2290
01:20:08,472 --> 01:20:10,442
- It's warm.
- It's warm.

2291
01:20:10,812 --> 01:20:11,812
It's so warm.

2292
01:20:11,813 --> 01:20:13,141
(Let's get inside.)

2293
01:20:13,142 --> 01:20:15,312
Hey, So Min. You should go underneath it.

2294
01:20:15,412 --> 01:20:17,111
- It's nice.
- Underneath it?

2295
01:20:17,112 --> 01:20:18,221
- You go underneath it.
- I see.

2296
01:20:18,222 --> 01:20:19,222
(Underneath the blanket,)

2297
01:20:20,022 --> 01:20:21,022
(there are many ceramic balls that are heated up.)

2298
01:20:21,023 --> 01:20:22,352
Gosh. It's so warm.

2299
01:20:23,952 --> 01:20:25,691
- Gosh. It's warm.
- It's warm.

2300
01:20:25,692 --> 01:20:27,561
- Do I go underneath it?
- Yes.

2301
01:20:27,562 --> 01:20:28,962
- What is this?
- I love it.

2302
01:20:30,162 --> 01:20:31,231
Hey. It's nice...

2303
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:32,432
- just to have my feet in it.
- It's lovely.

2304
01:20:33,232 --> 01:20:36,272
- Gosh. It's crazy.
- These ceramic balls are nice.

2305
01:20:36,672 --> 01:20:38,902
- It deserves to be a trendy place.
- No wonder it's trendy.

2306
01:20:39,272 --> 01:20:40,672
It makes sense that it's trendy.

2307
01:20:41,342 --> 01:20:43,171
- It massages my feet too.
- It's so warm.

2308
01:20:43,172 --> 01:20:44,212
(Relaxed)

2309
01:20:44,982 --> 01:20:46,742
So Min, you look like a cocoon.

2310
01:20:47,242 --> 01:20:48,552
- Na Ra.
- Yes.

2311
01:20:48,912 --> 01:20:52,021
- You don't trust the lockers?
- Why?

2312
01:20:52,022 --> 01:20:54,551
Actually, when it comes to a purse, I have separation anxiety.

2313
01:20:54,552 --> 01:20:55,592
(Precious)

2314
01:20:56,092 --> 01:20:57,222
- Is that so?
- Yes.

2315
01:20:57,322 --> 01:20:59,462
- I got mine too.
- I can't get away from it.

2316
01:20:59,862 --> 01:21:02,361
I have nothing to say if you have separation anxiety.

2317
01:21:02,362 --> 01:21:03,432
Hold on.

2318
01:21:03,592 --> 01:21:05,062
- Gosh.
- Is it warm?

2319
01:21:05,802 --> 01:21:07,732
(It's hot.)

2320
01:21:09,202 --> 01:21:11,601
- It's an aromatic foot bath.
- The color's pretty. It's pink.

2321
01:21:11,602 --> 01:21:13,001
- Come here.
- I sweat...

2322
01:21:13,002 --> 01:21:14,102
- because of the foot bath.
- It's warm.

2323
01:21:14,202 --> 01:21:17,842
(An aromatic footbath to recover from fatigue)

2324
01:21:18,482 --> 01:21:20,282
- Gosh. I love it.
- It relaxes my body.

2325
01:21:21,252 --> 01:21:24,281
- Gosh. Goodness.
- It helps blood circulation.

2326
01:21:24,282 --> 01:21:25,321
- Gosh.
- It's detoxing.

2327
01:21:25,322 --> 01:21:27,682
(Gosh. It's lovely.)

2328
01:21:28,652 --> 01:21:30,521
Where is Kyoung Pyo? Kyoung Pyo!

2329
01:21:30,522 --> 01:21:32,222
(By the way, where is Kyoung Pyo?)

2330
01:21:32,422 --> 01:21:35,191
- You can't sleep there.
- Are you sleeping over there?

2331
01:21:35,192 --> 01:21:36,262
(Cozy)

2332
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:39,462
(Kyoung Pyo, you have to get up now.)

2333
01:21:40,632 --> 01:21:42,702
(Kyoung Pyo isn't here.)

2334
01:21:43,902 --> 01:21:46,042
(Hiding)

2335
01:21:46,302 --> 01:21:47,442
Come on out.

2336
01:21:48,612 --> 01:21:49,772
I love it here.

2337
01:21:50,612 --> 01:21:51,912
It makes you sleepy, doesn't it?

2338
01:21:52,282 --> 01:21:54,281
Yes. It's incredible.

2339
01:21:54,282 --> 01:21:55,682
Isn't it small for you?

2340
01:21:56,082 --> 01:21:58,281
- Gosh. But I can't get out...
- Gosh. Look at him.

2341
01:21:58,282 --> 01:21:59,352
I can't get out of it.

2342
01:22:00,352 --> 01:22:01,421
(Looking around)

2343
01:22:01,422 --> 01:22:03,952
- You stepped on it, right?
- By the way, it feels...

2344
01:22:04,292 --> 01:22:05,661
a little strange.

2345
01:22:05,662 --> 01:22:08,361
Everyone, including the cameramen, in the uniform makes us look...

2346
01:22:08,362 --> 01:22:09,692
- Like prisoners, right?
- It feels strange...

2347
01:22:10,262 --> 01:22:11,701
- very much.
- It's like we're in the US...

2348
01:22:11,702 --> 01:22:13,101
or in the Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp.

2349
01:22:13,102 --> 01:22:14,502
- It feels like that a little.
- Right?

2350
01:22:15,032 --> 01:22:17,772
- It's a little...
- It feels strange.

2351
01:22:18,172 --> 01:22:19,771
- Let's go to another spot.
- It's so lovely.

2352
01:22:19,772 --> 01:22:21,071
- I want to stay here longer.
- I don't want to pull my feet out.

2353
01:22:21,072 --> 01:22:22,772
- I want to stay for more.
- It's really lovely.

2354
01:22:23,112 --> 01:22:24,441
Hey, that's a bubbly foot bath.

2355
01:22:24,442 --> 01:22:25,542
(A bubbly foot bath)

2356
01:22:26,782 --> 01:22:29,052
- Gosh. It's nice and warm.
- Gosh.

2357
01:22:29,382 --> 01:22:30,611
- Hey.
- This is so nice.

2358
01:22:30,612 --> 01:22:32,952
It feels nice when you put your feet where the bubbles come from.

2359
01:22:33,052 --> 01:22:34,322
How is it? Is it warm?

2360
01:22:35,252 --> 01:22:36,322
It's so nice.

2361
01:22:37,052 --> 01:22:39,722
It would be great to film YouTube content here as well.

2362
01:22:40,262 --> 01:22:42,691
- Gosh.
- It's the perfect angle.

2363
01:22:42,692 --> 01:22:44,361
- Gosh.
- I love it.

2364
01:22:44,362 --> 01:22:47,202
Right. It's so refreshing.

2365
01:22:47,902 --> 01:22:50,572
- What's fake about this place?
- Right.

2366
01:22:51,542 --> 01:22:54,541
- This can't be fake.
- Right. It's so nice.

2367
01:22:54,542 --> 01:22:56,812
But through these bushes,

2368
01:22:57,272 --> 01:22:59,682
- the ladies are taking pictures.
- Right.

2369
01:22:59,942 --> 01:23:01,912
(Intense coverage)

2370
01:23:02,182 --> 01:23:04,312
There are a lot of people reporting on us.

2371
01:23:04,752 --> 01:23:07,282
(One person joins the scene.)

2372
01:23:07,892 --> 01:23:09,991
- Gosh, my fellow members.
- You're here.

2373
01:23:09,992 --> 01:23:11,222
She's the founder of this place.

2374
01:23:12,192 --> 01:23:14,531
Right. Are you all enjoying your rest?

2375
01:23:14,532 --> 01:23:15,932
(Song Eun I, founder of the sauna)

2376
01:23:16,162 --> 01:23:17,631
(She caught on right away.)

2377
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:19,631
- It's your first time here.
- Right.

2378
01:23:19,632 --> 01:23:20,761
- Right.
- As you know,

2379
01:23:20,762 --> 01:23:21,901
you came here under his lead.

2380
01:23:21,902 --> 01:23:22,971
- Oh, right.
- "Under his lead?"

2381
01:23:22,972 --> 01:23:24,572
She used to be on TV in the past.

2382
01:23:24,902 --> 01:23:27,871
- Right. Enjoy your time here.
- Now,

2383
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:29,712
- she has set everything down.
- Right.

2384
01:23:29,912 --> 01:23:31,441
(It's unnecessarily detailed.)

2385
01:23:31,442 --> 01:23:33,681
CEO Song, dip your feet in.

2386
01:23:33,682 --> 01:23:35,052
- Right.
- It's so nice on your feet.

2387
01:23:35,982 --> 01:23:38,122
Dip your feet in. Gosh, it's so nice.

2388
01:23:39,822 --> 01:23:41,651
- Gosh! It's so slippery!
- Gosh!

2389
01:23:41,652 --> 01:23:43,491
- Gosh! It's so slippery!
- Gosh!

2390
01:23:43,492 --> 01:23:46,391
- Hey, why is this so deep?
- It's quite deep.

2391
01:23:46,392 --> 01:23:47,392
Why is this so deep?

2392
01:23:47,393 --> 01:23:48,462
You slipped in here?

2393
01:23:49,592 --> 01:23:50,791
You actually slipped in here?

2394
01:23:50,792 --> 01:23:52,931
- Why is this so deep?
- Are you okay?

2395
01:23:52,932 --> 01:23:54,331
- I'm okay.
- It was a loud thud.

2396
01:23:54,332 --> 01:23:55,931
The water was this high up for Kyoung Pyo's legs.

2397
01:23:55,932 --> 01:23:58,972
That was why I thought the water was really shallow.

2398
01:23:59,272 --> 01:24:00,471
Now that I think of it, his legs are different from mine.

2399
01:24:00,472 --> 01:24:01,511
(Showing his gums)

2400
01:24:01,512 --> 01:24:03,542
The water goes up to my knees.

2401
01:24:04,882 --> 01:24:07,952
People might think this is 2m deep.

2402
01:24:08,112 --> 01:24:11,382
Gosh. I was so surprised.

2403
01:24:12,352 --> 01:24:15,192
You look like her pupil with your hairstyle.

2404
01:24:16,052 --> 01:24:17,292
There's an area outside as well.

2405
01:24:17,392 --> 01:24:18,491
- Is that so?
- Really?

2406
01:24:18,492 --> 01:24:20,292
- There's really an area outside?
- Really?

2407
01:24:20,892 --> 01:24:23,031
- But nobody wants to get up.
- Right.

2408
01:24:23,032 --> 01:24:24,961
- It's nice and warm here.
- It's nice here.

2409
01:24:24,962 --> 01:24:27,102
- Why are you asking us to leave?
- I love it here.

2410
01:24:27,262 --> 01:24:28,832
We'll talk here.

2411
01:24:29,232 --> 01:24:32,271
- Let's go, inmates.
- Let's get up, members.

2412
01:24:32,272 --> 01:24:33,602
It's so nice here.

2413
01:24:33,842 --> 01:24:35,141
- It's great here.
- Hello.

2414
01:24:35,142 --> 01:24:36,411
I should take pictures of the ladies too.

2415
01:24:36,412 --> 01:24:37,412
Hello.

2416
01:24:37,413 --> 01:24:39,181
It's great here.

2417
01:24:39,182 --> 01:24:40,682
These people couldn't be extras, right?

2418
01:24:41,682 --> 01:24:43,951
- Hello.
- They look real. Gosh.

2419
01:24:43,952 --> 01:24:46,922
- Check this place out.
- Hello. This place is real.

2420
01:24:47,682 --> 01:24:50,792
(Are they real guests or extras?)

2421
01:24:51,122 --> 01:24:52,821
- We're outside.
- Gosh, it's cold!

2422
01:24:52,822 --> 01:24:53,991
Put on your slippers.

2423
01:24:53,992 --> 01:24:55,162
(They head outside with suspicions.)

2424
01:24:55,392 --> 01:24:57,261
- Gosh, it's cold.
- My feet are cold!

2425
01:24:57,262 --> 01:24:58,962
- Gosh, thank you.
- It's cold!

2426
01:24:59,362 --> 01:25:01,402
What is this place? It looks amazing.

2427
01:25:02,032 --> 01:25:04,642
(As they come out of the sauna,)

2428
01:25:05,702 --> 01:25:09,511
(they find a steamy outdoor foot bath!)

2429
01:25:09,512 --> 01:25:10,941
Hello. What are you doing?

2430
01:25:10,942 --> 01:25:13,241
- It's a foot bath.
- It's so nice.

2431
01:25:13,242 --> 01:25:14,911
- There are rooms.
- It's so nice!

2432
01:25:14,912 --> 01:25:16,012
- There are rooms.
- Right.

2433
01:25:16,552 --> 01:25:18,421
- I've never seen foot bath rooms.
- Me neither.

2434
01:25:18,422 --> 01:25:19,581
- Right.
- It's so nice here.

2435
01:25:19,582 --> 01:25:20,752
I should come here again.

2436
01:25:21,252 --> 01:25:23,792
(But it's so cold outside.)

2437
01:25:24,862 --> 01:25:27,222
Thank you. You're so kind.

2438
01:25:27,822 --> 01:25:29,732
- Wait!
- What's wrong?

2439
01:25:29,892 --> 01:25:31,862
- Wait!
- What's wrong?

2440
01:25:32,262 --> 01:25:34,671
- The one in "Lady Vengeance." - I know.

2441
01:25:34,672 --> 01:25:35,702
- Who?
- The pastor.

2442
01:25:36,902 --> 01:25:37,902
- Who?
- The pastor.

2443
01:25:39,442 --> 01:25:41,412
- Kim Byeong Ok!
- Kim Byeong Ok!

2444
01:25:42,312 --> 01:25:45,041
- Gosh!
- The one that looks like Kim Sook.

2445
01:25:45,042 --> 01:25:46,042
- Kim Byeong Ok!
- The one that looks like Kim Sook.

2446
01:25:47,242 --> 01:25:48,452
You've been through a lot.

2447
01:25:49,212 --> 01:25:50,782
(Mind your own business.)

2448
01:25:53,582 --> 01:25:55,651
So Min looks a lot like Kim Byeong Ok.

2449
01:25:55,652 --> 01:25:57,522
I look a lot like him. My father gets that too.

2450
01:25:57,922 --> 01:25:59,461
- He looks like him too.
- His father too.

2451
01:25:59,462 --> 01:26:01,362
She looks a lot like Kim Byeong Ok.

2452
01:26:02,832 --> 01:26:04,492
Gosh, it's warm here.

2453
01:26:05,332 --> 01:26:08,532
- Gosh, there are a lot here. Hello.
- Hello.

2454
01:26:09,072 --> 01:26:12,472
(At that moment, one person walks toward them.)

2455
01:26:13,302 --> 01:26:15,842
- Gosh.
- He's definitely the owner.

2456
01:26:16,872 --> 01:26:19,042
- Hello.
- Hello. Nice to meet you.

2457
01:26:19,082 --> 01:26:21,582
- Hello.
- He's definitely the owner.

2458
01:26:23,012 --> 01:26:25,622
(The suspicious owner's secret gets revealed.)

2459
01:26:26,052 --> 01:26:28,352
How long has it been since you have run this place?

2460
01:26:28,652 --> 01:26:31,251
This place opened in 2014.

2461
01:26:31,252 --> 01:26:33,192
- It has been a while.
- It's now in its 12th year.

2462
01:26:33,292 --> 01:26:34,931
- In its 12th year?
- Yes.

2463
01:26:34,932 --> 01:26:37,362
Is there something special about this sauna?

2464
01:26:37,692 --> 01:26:39,962
I've worked with doctors of oriental medicine...

2465
01:26:40,102 --> 01:26:41,501
and made a healthy buffet.

2466
01:26:41,502 --> 01:26:42,571
- A buffet?
- Yes.

2467
01:26:42,572 --> 01:26:43,931
- A buffet?
- A buffet?

2468
01:26:43,932 --> 01:26:45,972
(A buffet in a sauna?)

2469
01:26:46,272 --> 01:26:49,442
(Have you only had eggs and seaweed soup in the sauna?)

2470
01:26:51,212 --> 01:26:53,612
(You will be led to a buffet now.)

2471
01:26:54,012 --> 01:26:56,882
I met 3 to 4 doctors of oriental medicine.

2472
01:26:57,082 --> 01:26:59,381
It took a year of planning,

2473
01:26:59,382 --> 01:27:00,982
and it cost around eight million dollars.

2474
01:27:01,252 --> 01:27:03,192
With the food that will be served,

2475
01:27:03,392 --> 01:27:06,122
we thought about how the food could be healthy.

2476
01:27:06,522 --> 01:27:08,362
A lot of the food that is eaten...

2477
01:27:08,462 --> 01:27:10,391
is based on instant food.

2478
01:27:10,392 --> 01:27:13,601
That is why we are running a healthy buffet.

2479
01:27:13,602 --> 01:27:15,031
(That's why he chose a healthy buffet.)

2480
01:27:15,032 --> 01:27:17,802
Without using much seasoning including sugar,

2481
01:27:18,032 --> 01:27:21,712
we try our best to provide food with natural flavors.

2482
01:27:21,842 --> 01:27:25,042
It's our mission to lead everyone to healthy lives...

2483
01:27:25,242 --> 01:27:28,412
and to help them enjoy their lives.

2484
01:27:28,782 --> 01:27:31,652
Sixth Sense, is this place real?

2485
01:27:33,052 --> 01:27:35,891
I heard there's a rule...

2486
01:27:35,892 --> 01:27:38,262
- for the sauna temperatures.
- Right.

2487
01:27:38,462 --> 01:27:40,692
All saunas are set at 42°C.

2488
01:27:41,092 --> 01:27:43,992
The foot baths and saunas are all set at 42°C.

2489
01:27:44,292 --> 01:27:46,932
Sweating at a high heat may feel relieving,

2490
01:27:47,262 --> 01:27:48,301
but it is said that it is bad for your health...

2491
01:27:48,302 --> 01:27:49,332
as you lose your bodily fluid.

2492
01:27:50,672 --> 01:27:52,672
(It is said that it is bad?)

2493
01:27:53,142 --> 01:27:55,042
(Something feels off.)

2494
01:27:55,142 --> 01:27:57,611
- When did you start the buffet?
- The buffet.

2495
01:27:57,612 --> 01:27:59,881
It started in 19...

2496
01:27:59,882 --> 01:28:01,112
No. It started in 2014.

2497
01:28:01,212 --> 01:28:02,582
It started in 2014.

2498
01:28:02,682 --> 01:28:05,651
- March 1 was when it was open.
- In 2014?

2499
01:28:05,652 --> 01:28:06,652
In 2014.

2500
01:28:06,952 --> 01:28:08,692
- In 2014.
- He just said it was the 1900s.

2501
01:28:09,622 --> 01:28:11,662
(What?)

2502
01:28:11,892 --> 01:28:13,662
What kind of dishes are there?

2503
01:28:14,192 --> 01:28:16,932
Well, first of all...

2504
01:28:17,392 --> 01:28:20,161
What was that? Seasonal vegetables...

2505
01:28:20,162 --> 01:28:23,372
- Right.
- We serve organic vegetables.

2506
01:28:23,432 --> 01:28:26,472
We serve those vegetables...

2507
01:28:26,702 --> 01:28:27,842
and protein.

2508
01:28:28,442 --> 01:28:30,642
We serve animal protein.

2509
01:28:31,072 --> 01:28:33,612
We serve salads like chicken breast salad...

2510
01:28:33,842 --> 01:28:36,582
or tuna salad. We have those types of...

2511
01:28:37,412 --> 01:28:40,221
- I'm sorry, sir.
- He must be so nervous.

2512
01:28:40,222 --> 01:28:42,852
Is it your first time on a show with so many questions?

2513
01:28:43,252 --> 01:28:46,062
Or what's going on?

2514
01:28:46,192 --> 01:28:47,321
It seems like he's fake.

2515
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:49,531
- Right.
- He feels extremely fake.

2516
01:28:49,532 --> 01:28:52,432
(He's hilarious.)

2517
01:28:52,562 --> 01:28:55,072
He must be feeling sick.

2518
01:28:56,072 --> 01:28:57,372
He keeps pressing this area.

2519
01:28:58,032 --> 01:28:59,201
(He's so cute!)

2520
01:28:59,202 --> 01:29:01,471
- Shall we try the food?
- Can we try the food?

2521
01:29:01,472 --> 01:29:04,272
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2522
01:29:04,472 --> 01:29:06,181
- He got so nervous.
- Right.

2523
01:29:06,182 --> 01:29:08,182
- What? Right.
- He got so nervous.

2524
01:29:08,282 --> 01:29:11,051
- This place feels fake to me.
- Right?

2525
01:29:11,052 --> 01:29:12,521
It suddenly feels off.

2526
01:29:12,522 --> 01:29:14,891
Why did he suddenly mention the 1900s?

2527
01:29:14,892 --> 01:29:16,291
- He made a mistake.
- Right.

2528
01:29:16,292 --> 01:29:17,651
He mentioned the 1900s and suddenly said it was 2014.

2529
01:29:17,652 --> 01:29:18,822
He felt so suspicious.

2530
01:29:19,162 --> 01:29:21,492
And he said, "It is said."

2531
01:29:23,332 --> 01:29:24,732
He was told to say things by the production crew.

2532
01:29:26,402 --> 01:29:30,502
(Explaining this place as if he memorized lines)

2533
01:29:31,402 --> 01:29:34,242
(Speaking as if he was told to say things)

2534
01:29:34,842 --> 01:29:36,942
(Endless pressing against his hands too)

2535
01:29:37,542 --> 01:29:40,742
(The owner feels suspicious. Is this place fake?)

2536
01:29:40,982 --> 01:29:42,112
What shall I eat?

2537
01:29:42,212 --> 01:29:43,481
(Shall we take a look around the buffet first?)

2538
01:29:43,482 --> 01:29:44,582
- Gosh.
- How is it?

2539
01:29:44,952 --> 01:29:47,221
- There's bulgogi.
- This is amazing.

2540
01:29:47,222 --> 01:29:48,921
- This is amazing.
- Gosh.

2541
01:29:48,922 --> 01:29:51,791
Gosh, there's minari mulkimchi, my favorite.

2542
01:29:51,792 --> 01:29:54,121
- It's minari mulkimchi.
- There's more water parsley?

2543
01:29:54,122 --> 01:29:55,732
They have minari mulkimchi.

2544
01:29:56,292 --> 01:29:58,601
- This place is amazing.
- It's a minari party.

2545
01:29:58,602 --> 01:29:59,602
(Minari mulkimchi isn't the only dish here.)

2546
01:30:00,332 --> 01:30:02,901
These are well-being dishes made with seasonal ingredients.

2547
01:30:02,902 --> 01:30:05,342
(Well-being buffet made with seasonal ingredients)

2548
01:30:05,472 --> 01:30:08,072
Spring herbs are used.

2549
01:30:08,542 --> 01:30:10,771
The dishes are changed based on the ingredients in season.

2550
01:30:10,772 --> 01:30:11,812
(Various seasonal vegetable salads full of dietary fiber)

2551
01:30:11,912 --> 01:30:14,881
The protein dishes are made with the least fat.

2552
01:30:14,882 --> 01:30:16,551
(Meat dishes high on protein and low on fat)

2553
01:30:16,552 --> 01:30:19,181
You can't miss out on eating fish.

2554
01:30:19,182 --> 01:30:20,222
(Grilled fish can't be left out.)

2555
01:30:20,322 --> 01:30:22,352
(Nutritious multigrain rice, salmon endive, pickled wood ear)

2556
01:30:23,022 --> 01:30:25,162
(Out of 30 or more dishes...)

2557
01:30:25,762 --> 01:30:26,762
(Owner's recommendation: Stir-fried soy meat)

2558
01:30:26,763 --> 01:30:29,032
Soy meat is considered to be...

2559
01:30:29,132 --> 01:30:31,762
the best protein dish for people.

2560
01:30:32,262 --> 01:30:34,832
(A healthy dish that is low in cholesterol)

2561
01:30:35,232 --> 01:30:38,672
When pineapples are pickled,

2562
01:30:38,902 --> 01:30:41,102
they will taste nice and sour,

2563
01:30:41,372 --> 01:30:43,041
and they will help with your digestion.

2564
01:30:43,042 --> 01:30:44,072
(The sweet and sour appetizer out of the pickled dishes)

2565
01:30:44,542 --> 01:30:47,382
(You still must have dessert even in a healthy meal, right?)

2566
01:30:47,812 --> 01:30:50,652
The glutinous corn harvested from Mount Seorak...

2567
01:30:51,112 --> 01:30:52,581
is served as a dessert.

2568
01:30:52,582 --> 01:30:54,751
(Chewy and sweet glutinous corn from Gangwon Province)

2569
01:30:54,752 --> 01:30:57,192
Instead of serving desserts made with a lot of sugar,

2570
01:30:57,352 --> 01:31:00,261
we serve desserts that are made of natural ingredients.

2571
01:31:00,262 --> 01:31:01,522
(The perfect healthy meal)

2572
01:31:02,392 --> 01:31:04,792
(Shall we start filling our plates?)

2573
01:31:05,062 --> 01:31:07,362
- Check out how it looks.
- The quality is amazing.

2574
01:31:07,802 --> 01:31:09,372
The food looks amazing.

2575
01:31:09,872 --> 01:31:12,372
I don't think I can head home right away after the shoot.

2576
01:31:13,472 --> 01:31:14,772
They have fried eggplants too.

2577
01:31:17,172 --> 01:31:19,382
- They have fried eggplants.
- That looks good. Hello.

2578
01:31:19,612 --> 01:31:21,652
(The highlight of this buffet)

2579
01:31:22,612 --> 01:31:25,222
(The batter is applied right away,)

2580
01:31:26,222 --> 01:31:30,392
(and the eggplants are fried on the spot.)

2581
01:31:31,662 --> 01:31:35,031
(The crunchiness is a work of art as it's just made.)

2582
01:31:35,032 --> 01:31:36,832
The fried eggplants look really good too.

2583
01:31:36,932 --> 01:31:38,501
- Hello.
- Hello.

2584
01:31:38,502 --> 01:31:41,132
- Thank you.
- This place is amazing.

2585
01:31:41,432 --> 01:31:43,131
The food is amazing here.

2586
01:31:43,132 --> 01:31:45,002
- Gosh.
- The food is amazing.

2587
01:31:45,702 --> 01:31:48,142
It looks so good.

2588
01:31:48,372 --> 01:31:50,111
- It's amazing here, isn't it?
- It really is.

2589
01:31:50,112 --> 01:31:51,172
(Everyone is busily filling up their plates.)

2590
01:31:52,012 --> 01:31:53,542
But with this kind of setup,

2591
01:31:54,712 --> 01:31:55,781
the production crew...

2592
01:31:55,782 --> 01:31:57,351
Just like the second place,

2593
01:31:57,352 --> 01:31:58,952
this place is a great place to set up for the production crew.

2594
01:31:59,022 --> 01:32:00,022
- Well...
- With buffet catering.

2595
01:32:00,022 --> 01:32:01,022
This could originally be a restaurant.

2596
01:32:01,022 --> 01:32:02,022
- Right.
- Right?

2597
01:32:02,652 --> 01:32:04,221
It's either the 2nd place or 3rd place.

2598
01:32:04,222 --> 01:32:06,061
- Right?
- This place feels suspicious too.

2599
01:32:06,062 --> 01:32:07,692
This place does feel suspicious.

2600
01:32:09,292 --> 01:32:11,431
(Is this place an actual place?)

2601
01:32:11,432 --> 01:32:13,531
- Gosh, this is amazing.
- Thank you for the food.

2602
01:32:13,532 --> 01:32:16,131
Gosh, we've been served with three meals.

2603
01:32:16,132 --> 01:32:17,171
(The plates are filled with healthy dishes.)

2604
01:32:17,172 --> 01:32:18,901
Thank you for the food.

2605
01:32:18,902 --> 01:32:20,501
The dishes are great too.

2606
01:32:20,502 --> 01:32:21,642
- Right?
- Yes.

2607
01:32:22,042 --> 01:32:24,272
(So Min starts with the pickled pineapple.)

2608
01:32:25,942 --> 01:32:28,812
Have you tried the pickled pineapple?

2609
01:32:28,912 --> 01:32:30,182
- No. Is it good?
- It's really good.

2610
01:32:30,612 --> 01:32:32,621
- I brought some.
- It's good.

2611
01:32:32,622 --> 01:32:34,282
(The pickled pineapple refreshingly whets your appetite.)

2612
01:32:34,582 --> 01:32:36,522
- It's perfect to our tastes.
- Exactly.

2613
01:32:36,752 --> 01:32:37,952
- But it's healthy too.
- It's a healthy buffet.

2614
01:32:38,252 --> 01:32:40,922
And there are so many dishes made with fresh ingredients.

2615
01:32:41,192 --> 01:32:42,262
- Gosh.
- Right.

2616
01:32:42,532 --> 01:32:43,962
- Right.
- The food is really good.

2617
01:32:44,592 --> 01:32:45,962
It's perfectly seasoned.

2618
01:32:46,362 --> 01:32:48,262
- It's so good.
- It's delicious.

2619
01:32:48,872 --> 01:32:54,641
(Na Ra who didn't have an appetite ends up eating endlessly.)

2620
01:32:54,642 --> 01:32:56,772
Jae Seok definitely has...

2621
01:32:57,042 --> 01:32:59,642
an appetite of a child.

2622
01:32:59,842 --> 01:33:01,441
He brought everything that isn't healthy.

2623
01:33:01,442 --> 01:33:02,852
(Feeling guilty)

2624
01:33:02,982 --> 01:33:06,652
He brought the kabocha salad and the crab sticks with mayo.

2625
01:33:06,782 --> 01:33:07,951
The ones that have a strong taste.

2626
01:33:07,952 --> 01:33:09,592
You brought things that have a lot of seasoning.

2627
01:33:09,792 --> 01:33:12,662
It's my first time seeing someone mix rice with the kabocha salad.

2628
01:33:12,762 --> 01:33:14,392
Really? It's your lucky day.

2629
01:33:16,792 --> 01:33:18,432
- There's a first for everything.
- Right.

2630
01:33:18,502 --> 01:33:19,502
It's your lucky day.

2631
01:33:19,503 --> 01:33:21,832
- Gosh, I feel so happy today.
- Well,

2632
01:33:22,432 --> 01:33:24,271
- this place is nice.
- It's really nice.

2633
01:33:24,272 --> 01:33:25,402
- The foot bath is really nice too.
- Right.

2634
01:33:25,702 --> 01:33:27,602
- It's the perfect place for you.
- Right.

2635
01:33:28,302 --> 01:33:30,472
- It'll be perfect to drive here.
- Right.

2636
01:33:31,012 --> 01:33:32,811
But the short-order dish...

2637
01:33:32,812 --> 01:33:34,782
happened to be the fried eggplant, and that feels suspicious to me.

2638
01:33:35,212 --> 01:33:37,211
- Why?
- I really like that dish,

2639
01:33:37,212 --> 01:33:38,751
but it's a dish...

2640
01:33:38,752 --> 01:33:41,451
that doesn't really seem to need a chef there.

2641
01:33:41,452 --> 01:33:42,652
(It doesn't seem necessary for it to be a short-order dish.)

2642
01:33:43,292 --> 01:33:44,722
It doesn't seem necessary...

2643
01:33:45,392 --> 01:33:46,861
to spend more on labor costs with that.

2644
01:33:46,862 --> 01:33:50,631
Byeong Ok has a point with that.

2645
01:33:50,632 --> 01:33:53,632
(He brings up Byeong Ok again.)

2646
01:33:55,572 --> 01:33:57,601
He made it sound so natural.

2647
01:33:57,602 --> 01:33:59,742
(She quickly tries to cover the lower part of her face.)

2648
01:34:00,372 --> 01:34:02,171
Byeong Ok has a point with that.

2649
01:34:02,172 --> 01:34:04,072
Right, Jae Seok? I have a point, don't I?

2650
01:34:04,612 --> 01:34:06,042
I have a point, Jae Seok.

2651
01:34:09,082 --> 01:34:12,622
Why is a chef there for that the whole time?

2652
01:34:12,722 --> 01:34:14,281
But fritters can't be made in advance.

2653
01:34:14,282 --> 01:34:15,992
- They have to be made on the spot.
- The fritters can be taken out.

2654
01:34:17,922 --> 01:34:20,321
Or it could be a meat dish that could be grilled for you.

2655
01:34:20,322 --> 01:34:21,722
Right. Byeong Ok is right.

2656
01:34:22,732 --> 01:34:24,261
You're right, Byeong Ok.

2657
01:34:24,262 --> 01:34:25,432
- Right?
- Byeong Ok is right.

2658
01:34:25,962 --> 01:34:27,661
(Byeong Ok is right about everything.)

2659
01:34:27,662 --> 01:34:28,671
(Crying)

2660
01:34:28,672 --> 01:34:29,772
I can't deny the things you say.

2661
01:34:30,032 --> 01:34:31,431
I've been told that I look like Noh Joo Hyun too.

2662
01:34:31,432 --> 01:34:32,542
(A sudden confession)

2663
01:34:33,542 --> 01:34:35,172
(Laughing)

2664
01:34:35,772 --> 01:34:37,541
So in conclusion, you do look like Sook.

2665
01:34:37,542 --> 01:34:38,582
Right.

2666
01:34:39,182 --> 01:34:42,051
(Faces united)

2667
01:34:42,052 --> 01:34:44,151
- I think this place is a sauna.
- Right.

2668
01:34:44,152 --> 01:34:46,652
- It's definitely a sauna.
- But this buffet feels suspicious.

2669
01:34:46,922 --> 01:34:48,921
- There were more tables there.
- Right.

2670
01:34:48,922 --> 01:34:50,822
- There were more tables.
- That TV is used for order numbers.

2671
01:34:51,152 --> 01:34:53,622
It will ring for the order numbers in a place of this size.

2672
01:34:53,792 --> 01:34:54,961
There must be order numbers given out here.

2673
01:34:54,962 --> 01:34:57,091
- That makes sense.
- It will ring for each order.

2674
01:34:57,092 --> 01:34:58,162
That seems right about the TV.

2675
01:34:58,802 --> 01:34:59,961
Other things could have been sold here...

2676
01:34:59,962 --> 01:35:01,131
instead of it being a buffet.

2677
01:35:01,132 --> 01:35:03,101
- Right.
- Things like seaweed soup.

2678
01:35:03,102 --> 01:35:04,901
Seaweed soup, ramyeon, or pork cutlet.

2679
01:35:04,902 --> 01:35:06,271
And that place was the counter.

2680
01:35:06,272 --> 01:35:07,272
- Right.
- Yes.

2681
01:35:07,273 --> 01:35:09,011
The food would be handed out there.

2682
01:35:09,012 --> 01:35:10,072
Right. That feels off.

2683
01:35:10,472 --> 01:35:13,041
But a buffet is made here just for this?

2684
01:35:13,042 --> 01:35:14,582
They could set it up at a place like this.

2685
01:35:15,182 --> 01:35:18,782
(A buffet area made just for the show?)

2686
01:35:19,152 --> 01:35:20,982
Can they quickly set up a place like this?

2687
01:35:21,152 --> 01:35:22,521
- They can.
- They definitely can.

2688
01:35:22,522 --> 01:35:23,652
- They surely can.
- Right.

2689
01:35:24,552 --> 01:35:28,292
(A healthy buffet in the sauna. Is this place real?)

2690
01:35:28,592 --> 01:35:30,431
(Suspicious owner of Steam and Eat: The owner was rather nervous.)

2691
01:35:30,432 --> 01:35:32,361
(It's a place that can be easily set up by the production crew.)

2692
01:35:32,362 --> 01:35:34,331
(The short-order corner feels suspicious.)

2693
01:35:34,332 --> 01:35:36,832
Are we doing it in the foot bath? This is great.

2694
01:35:37,002 --> 01:35:38,432
- Yes!
- This is amazing.

2695
01:35:38,502 --> 01:35:39,671
I love this detox session.

2696
01:35:39,672 --> 01:35:41,101
I should deduct the fake place for around an hour.

2697
01:35:41,102 --> 01:35:43,112
(What?)

2698
01:35:43,212 --> 01:35:44,411
I don't really care about getting the answer.

2699
01:35:44,412 --> 01:35:45,442
It just feels great here.

2700
01:35:45,482 --> 01:35:48,342
But as we're sitting here,

2701
01:35:48,482 --> 01:35:51,512
I'm wondering if a buffet would work in a place like this.

2702
01:35:51,712 --> 01:35:53,022
Right.

2703
01:35:53,852 --> 01:35:57,422
(Is a buffet necessary in sauna?)

2704
01:35:58,222 --> 01:36:02,662
(Is it a buffet catering service set up by the production crew?)

2705
01:36:02,732 --> 01:36:04,662
If it wasn't for the owner,

2706
01:36:05,032 --> 01:36:06,361
- it wouldn't have felt suspicious.
- He was shaking so much.

2707
01:36:06,362 --> 01:36:08,532
Right. It would've have felt suspicious.

2708
01:36:09,172 --> 01:36:11,671
"It is said that sweating at a high heat..."

2709
01:36:11,672 --> 01:36:13,272
"will make you lose your bodily fluid."

2710
01:36:13,342 --> 01:36:14,601
(Something feels off.)

2711
01:36:14,602 --> 01:36:16,542
- That was something he was told.
- Exactly.

2712
01:36:16,742 --> 01:36:18,072
That was how he said it.

2713
01:36:18,172 --> 01:36:19,381
But if you think about it,

2714
01:36:19,382 --> 01:36:20,541
the owner of the first place spoke like that too.

2715
01:36:20,542 --> 01:36:22,552
"It is said that something good comes out of the crock."

2716
01:36:22,752 --> 01:36:25,082
(I Do It All On My Own)

2717
01:36:25,352 --> 01:36:29,422
(From each brick to each crock)

2718
01:36:29,592 --> 01:36:32,062
(The barbecue owner makes everything himself.)

2719
01:36:32,192 --> 01:36:34,422
(It is said that something good comes out from that.)

2720
01:36:37,092 --> 01:36:38,862
(The owner spoke as if he was saying lines memorized.)

2721
01:36:39,062 --> 01:36:41,132
(Suspicious)

2722
01:36:41,432 --> 01:36:43,601
- Then is it the 1st place?
- The 1st place?

2723
01:36:43,602 --> 01:36:44,872
Is it the first place?

2724
01:36:45,102 --> 01:36:46,271
(Head hurting)

2725
01:36:46,272 --> 01:36:48,542
The first place doesn't feel realistic.

2726
01:36:48,912 --> 01:36:51,241
He covered that much space...

2727
01:36:51,242 --> 01:36:52,911
all on his own over many years?

2728
01:36:52,912 --> 01:36:54,342
(An unrealistically large area to cover on his own)

2729
01:36:54,412 --> 01:36:55,681
There's one thing that bothers me...

2730
01:36:55,682 --> 01:36:56,911
- about the first place.
- What is it?

2731
01:36:56,912 --> 01:36:58,651
After the shoot there,

2732
01:36:58,652 --> 01:37:01,281
the owner and his daughter came over...

2733
01:37:01,282 --> 01:37:02,552
- to greet us.
- Right.

2734
01:37:02,622 --> 01:37:03,851
(Seeing all of you in person,)

2735
01:37:03,852 --> 01:37:05,662
(you all look amazing.)

2736
01:37:05,822 --> 01:37:07,662
(Gosh, I can't believe I'm seeing Almighty Yu.)

2737
01:37:08,222 --> 01:37:09,591
(But...)

2738
01:37:09,592 --> 01:37:11,061
(why do they feel so awkward?)

2739
01:37:11,062 --> 01:37:12,662
(No way.)

2740
01:37:12,762 --> 01:37:15,101
They said things like, "Come and visit again."

2741
01:37:15,102 --> 01:37:17,002
All three of them had no emotion when they said those things.

2742
01:37:17,332 --> 01:37:18,531
That was how it felt to me.

2743
01:37:18,532 --> 01:37:20,242
- "Come and visit again." - It felt like...

2744
01:37:20,642 --> 01:37:22,641
- "It was great to see you." - Hold on, So Min.

2745
01:37:22,642 --> 01:37:24,542
- I think you've got it wrong.
- Really?

2746
01:37:24,672 --> 01:37:26,241
That's not making a deduction. That's what you just felt.

2747
01:37:26,242 --> 01:37:27,612
The production crew made them say those things.

2748
01:37:27,912 --> 01:37:29,652
It really felt off to me.

2749
01:37:29,782 --> 01:37:30,912
I'm serious.

2750
01:37:30,982 --> 01:37:32,382
I was really sharp to point that out.

2751
01:37:32,652 --> 01:37:33,781
(Dumbfounded)

2752
01:37:33,782 --> 01:37:34,782
Really?

2753
01:37:34,783 --> 01:37:36,721
"Seeing you in person,"

2754
01:37:36,722 --> 01:37:39,121
"you look amazing."

2755
01:37:39,122 --> 01:37:40,221
These comments...

2756
01:37:40,222 --> 01:37:42,432
So you didn't like what they said about me?

2757
01:37:42,832 --> 01:37:44,792
(That's what it is.)

2758
01:37:44,862 --> 01:37:46,402
"He doesn't look amazing,"

2759
01:37:46,832 --> 01:37:48,431
"but why did she say he looks amazing?"

2760
01:37:48,432 --> 01:37:50,101
- Hey, Byeong Ok.
- That was what bothered you.

2761
01:37:50,102 --> 01:37:51,402
Was that what bothered you?

2762
01:37:51,802 --> 01:37:54,142
"He doesn't look amazing, but did she say that?"

2763
01:37:54,272 --> 01:37:55,741
Are you saying she was lying about that?

2764
01:37:55,742 --> 01:37:57,571
(The conversations felt awkward. Is the 1st place fake?)

2765
01:37:57,572 --> 01:37:58,742
As for the second place...

2766
01:37:58,982 --> 01:38:01,181
But with the second place,

2767
01:38:01,182 --> 01:38:03,481
they had too many things on the menu to sell.

2768
01:38:03,482 --> 01:38:05,582
- Their sales don't feel realistic.
- Right.

2769
01:38:05,982 --> 01:38:09,592
(Five Handsome Owners)

2770
01:38:10,052 --> 01:38:13,021
(The 5 handsome models...)

2771
01:38:13,022 --> 01:38:15,962
(sell 5 dishes at the 5-day market.)

2772
01:38:16,632 --> 01:38:20,432
(Unrealistic prices?)

2773
01:38:20,562 --> 01:38:22,132
The second place definitely feels fake.

2774
01:38:22,332 --> 01:38:23,631
- It's fake?
- The second place is fake.

2775
01:38:23,632 --> 01:38:25,842
It felt so unrealistic.

2776
01:38:26,872 --> 01:38:28,071
- What do you think, So Min?
- It doesn't make sense.

2777
01:38:28,072 --> 01:38:29,671
(Sighing)

2778
01:38:29,672 --> 01:38:32,541
I still think it's real.

2779
01:38:32,542 --> 01:38:33,911
You wish for it to be real, right?

2780
01:38:33,912 --> 01:38:35,481
It feels so fake that it feels real instead.

2781
01:38:35,482 --> 01:38:37,052
That is what I think as well.

2782
01:38:37,382 --> 01:38:39,021
The burgers and the paella.

2783
01:38:39,022 --> 01:38:40,852
It's not easy to make paella in a cauldron.

2784
01:38:41,022 --> 01:38:42,191
- Right.
- Right.

2785
01:38:42,192 --> 01:38:43,552
I've tried making that.

2786
01:38:43,892 --> 01:38:45,221
It's hard to make with a cauldron.

2787
01:38:45,222 --> 01:38:47,161
The paella should be made on a wide pan,

2788
01:38:47,162 --> 01:38:48,761
- but cauldrons go in deep.
- Right.

2789
01:38:48,762 --> 01:38:51,731
(He struggled to make it with the pot.)

2790
01:38:51,732 --> 01:38:53,661
Because of the heat conductivity,

2791
01:38:53,662 --> 01:38:55,362
the paella can't be made with cauldrons.

2792
01:38:55,602 --> 01:38:58,532
(Is the 2nd place fake with what Kyoung Pyo mentioned?)

2793
01:38:58,802 --> 01:39:00,302
Let's vote.

2794
01:39:00,472 --> 01:39:02,642
- The first place.
- No votes.

2795
01:39:02,712 --> 01:39:03,712
The second place.

2796
01:39:03,713 --> 01:39:04,741
(Five Handsome Owners)

2797
01:39:04,742 --> 01:39:05,912
I vote for the second place.

2798
01:39:06,582 --> 01:39:07,582
The third place.

2799
01:39:07,782 --> 01:39:09,251
(Steam and Eat, 2 votes)

2800
01:39:09,252 --> 01:39:10,311
Really?

2801
01:39:10,312 --> 01:39:11,952
But Na Ra is terrible at this.

2802
01:39:12,382 --> 01:39:13,752
My gosh.

2803
01:39:14,052 --> 01:39:15,792
Bring Ms. Ma Chu Ja.

2804
01:39:16,192 --> 01:39:17,351
(Third place, two votes, second place, four votes)

2805
01:39:17,352 --> 01:39:19,892
(The new and old members have split up with their votes.)

2806
01:39:19,962 --> 01:39:21,761
But we have to go with one answer.

2807
01:39:21,762 --> 01:39:22,862
- Right.
- Right.

2808
01:39:22,892 --> 01:39:24,132
I have no idea.

2809
01:39:24,562 --> 01:39:26,332
But is this right?

2810
01:39:27,032 --> 01:39:28,971
It's hard to be certain...

2811
01:39:28,972 --> 01:39:30,002
once we're asked to decide.

2812
01:39:30,372 --> 01:39:31,671
How does this sound?

2813
01:39:31,672 --> 01:39:34,071
It's been a while for them to come, so these two should decide.

2814
01:39:34,072 --> 01:39:35,841
- We'll go with their answer.
- Sounds good.

2815
01:39:35,842 --> 01:39:38,442
But the two of us both have the same opinion.

2816
01:39:38,542 --> 01:39:39,981
- You guys have a different opinion.
- Right.

2817
01:39:39,982 --> 01:39:40,982
(Five Handsome Owners versus Steam and Eat)

2818
01:39:40,983 --> 01:39:42,212
I want to get it right.

2819
01:39:43,152 --> 01:39:46,222
- Should we just go with number 2?
- Number 2 does really feel fake.

2820
01:39:46,522 --> 01:39:48,421
One, two, three.

2821
01:39:48,422 --> 01:39:49,552
- Number 2!
- Number 2!

2822
01:39:49,622 --> 01:39:51,491
(They trust the Blunties.)

2823
01:39:51,492 --> 01:39:52,661
Then...

2824
01:39:52,662 --> 01:39:54,662
- Is it wrong? Why did he laugh?
- Why did he laugh?

2825
01:39:54,922 --> 01:39:56,261
I hate it when he laughs.

2826
01:39:56,262 --> 01:39:57,631
- Don't laugh!
- I think they got us.

2827
01:39:57,632 --> 01:39:59,601
There's nothing we can say if they fooled us.

2828
01:39:59,602 --> 01:40:00,602
Right.

2829
01:40:00,603 --> 01:40:01,961
- Right.
- They did an amazing job.

2830
01:40:01,962 --> 01:40:04,201
But the second place had so many things that felt fake.

2831
01:40:04,202 --> 01:40:05,232
- Right.
- Right.

2832
01:40:05,672 --> 01:40:08,202
- Let's see.
- Why does he look so happy?

2833
01:40:08,772 --> 01:40:10,772
- What if it's the 3rd place?
- I think it's the 3rd place.

2834
01:40:11,312 --> 01:40:13,941
(Will they be able to avoid 4 consecutive losses?)

2835
01:40:13,942 --> 01:40:15,851
(Sixth Sense Holmes)

2836
01:40:15,852 --> 01:40:17,081
(Find the suspicious owner.)

2837
01:40:17,082 --> 01:40:18,652
The owner could be fake.

2838
01:40:18,922 --> 01:40:19,922
(Today's location under investigation)

2839
01:40:19,923 --> 01:40:21,282
(Yangpyeong, Gyeonggi Province)

2840
01:40:21,482 --> 01:40:23,851
- I made all of this too.
- It sounds so fake.

2841
01:40:23,852 --> 01:40:24,991
- It sounds so fake.
- Right.

2842
01:40:24,992 --> 01:40:26,192
He sounds scary.

2843
01:40:26,922 --> 01:40:32,262
(Suspicious owners)

2844
01:40:33,332 --> 01:40:35,232
But all of them felt fake.

2845
01:40:36,232 --> 01:40:37,531
(If you wish to find the fake one,)

2846
01:40:37,532 --> 01:40:39,372
(do not trust anyone.)

2847
01:40:40,872 --> 01:40:41,902
- What?
- What?

2848
01:40:42,272 --> 01:40:44,511
I think it's the third place. Isn't that the sauna?

2849
01:40:44,512 --> 01:40:45,512
(Which one is the fake place that was set up meticulously?)

2850
01:40:46,412 --> 01:40:47,412
(I Build It All On My Own)

2851
01:40:47,413 --> 01:40:48,882
Please!

2852
01:40:49,212 --> 01:40:51,011
It can't be the first place.

2853
01:40:51,012 --> 01:40:52,012
It's the first place?

2854
01:40:52,013 --> 01:40:53,022
(I Grill It All On My Own)

2855
01:40:53,252 --> 01:40:54,652
What? That surprised me.

2856
01:40:55,352 --> 01:40:57,292
(These men appeared at the five-day market in Yangpyeong.)

2857

(The handsome ones with an average height of 185cm)

2858
01:40:58,592 --> 01:41:01,191
- This one is fake.
- Right. We should be right.

2859
01:41:01,192 --> 01:41:02,192
(Global dishes served by the handsome ones?)

2860
01:41:02,292 --> 01:41:03,661
This one doesn't make sense.

2861
01:41:03,662 --> 01:41:04,762
(Five Handsome Owners)

2862
01:41:05,192 --> 01:41:07,662
- This place has to be real.
- This place must be real.

2863
01:41:08,262 --> 01:41:09,632
But it's about the buffet.

2864
01:41:09,772 --> 01:41:12,031
- If it's real or fake.
- Right.

01:41:13,042 --> 01:41:14,202
- Please!
- "Steam and Eat."

2867
01:41:14,372 --> 01:41:15,972
"Steam and Eat?" Something feels off.

2868
01:41:16,072 --> 01:41:18,311
- Right. It feels off now.
- Something feels off now.

2869
01:41:18,312 --> 01:41:19,611
- Something does feel off.
- Right.

2870
01:41:19,612 --> 01:41:20,781
We were suspicious...

2871
01:41:20,782 --> 01:41:21,942
- about that place too.
- Right.

2872
01:41:22,482 --> 01:41:25,922
(Who is the suspicious owner hidden in Yangpyeong?)

2873
01:41:26,122 --> 01:41:28,251
Please! It will be revealed right away.

2874
01:41:28,252 --> 01:41:30,721
- Please!
- What if it's the third place?

2875
01:41:30,722 --> 01:41:31,792
Let's get it right.

2876
01:41:32,392 --> 01:41:34,292
(Which place is fake?)

2877
01:41:34,562 --> 01:41:35,761
Please!

2878
01:41:35,762 --> 01:41:37,762
(We can't lose 4 times in a row.)

2879
01:41:37,892 --> 01:41:39,401
(Gulping)

2880
01:41:39,402 --> 01:41:43,302
(It will be revealed now.)

2881
01:41:45,842 --> 01:41:47,341
(Five Handsome Owners)

2882
01:41:47,342 --> 01:41:49,912
(Fake)

2883
01:41:50,212 --> 01:41:53,012
(We got it right!)

2884
01:41:53,842 --> 01:41:55,382
- I knew it.
- I knew it.

2885
01:41:55,952 --> 01:41:57,851
Right.

2886
01:41:57,852 --> 01:41:58,852
Yes!

2887
01:41:58,853 --> 01:42:00,622
We tried to give it a twist as the two of them were here.

2888
01:42:01,482 --> 01:42:03,652
- Really?
- That was what they went for.

2889
01:42:03,792 --> 01:42:06,221
- That was what they went for.
- They went for that?

2890
01:42:06,222 --> 01:42:08,091
- The two of them fell for it.
- It felt that way.

2891
01:42:08,092 --> 01:42:09,291
That was why they chose the third place.

2892
01:42:09,292 --> 01:42:10,431
We really fell for it.

2893
01:42:10,432 --> 01:42:11,531
It felt that way.

2894
01:42:11,532 --> 01:42:13,402
It felt as if they were targeting us.

2895
01:42:13,632 --> 01:42:15,771
- That's amazing.
- That's amazing.

2896
01:42:15,772 --> 01:42:17,931
If it wasn't for the members, I would've gone with number three.

2897
01:42:17,932 --> 01:42:19,341
- Right. We both chose number three.
- Right.

2898
01:42:19,342 --> 01:42:20,342
Really?

2899
01:42:20,842 --> 01:42:23,972
(Why did the 5 models gather?)

2900
01:42:24,372 --> 01:42:25,911
(Deceive the original members.)

2901
01:42:25,912 --> 01:42:27,782
- My goodness.
- Gosh.

2902
01:42:28,442 --> 01:42:30,551
(Prepared for the original members who fall for looks easily)

2903
01:42:30,552 --> 01:42:31,652
Oh, my gosh.

2904
01:42:32,452 --> 01:42:34,351
(Good-looking owners have taken over social media!)

2905
01:42:34,352 --> 01:42:36,122
Good-looking owners are the talk of the town.

2906
01:42:37,392 --> 01:42:38,951
(The dumpling place owner who looks like Rowoon...)

2907
01:42:38,952 --> 01:42:40,362
(caught the attention of the production crew.)

2908
01:42:40,692 --> 01:42:42,222
- He's the one we saw earlier.
- Right.

2909
01:42:42,592 --> 01:42:44,392
- He made dumplings.
- He made dumpling balls earlier.

2910
01:42:44,892 --> 01:42:47,501
I have turned 30 this year. My name is Lee Gun Ho.

2911
01:42:47,502 --> 01:42:49,571
- I usually...
- He actually...

2912
01:42:49,572 --> 01:42:51,201
- sells dumplings.
- He actually sells them.

2913
01:42:51,202 --> 01:42:52,702
- Awesome.
- No wonder they were good.

2914
01:42:52,872 --> 01:42:55,142
(That was how the search for 5 models began.)

2915
01:42:55,602 --> 01:42:57,942
So he was the start of the search. The crew gathered them.

2916
01:42:58,042 --> 01:42:59,211
Isn't he the one Mimi likes?

2917
01:42:59,212 --> 01:43:00,742
- Isn't he my favorite?
- Right.

2918
01:43:00,842 --> 01:43:04,052
At the five-day market in Yangpyeong,

2919
01:43:04,352 --> 01:43:05,722
you must actually run a business.

2920
01:43:05,822 --> 01:43:08,222
- It's a real business.
- I see.

2921
01:43:08,682 --> 01:43:11,151
- I majored in hotel culinary arts.
- That's true about him.

2922
01:43:11,152 --> 01:43:12,492
I've been in the industry for around 7 to 8 years.

2923
01:43:13,692 --> 01:43:15,422
I know how to make Chinese food,

2924
01:43:15,522 --> 01:43:17,991
- Western food, and Korean food.
- They actually know how to cook.

2925
01:43:17,992 --> 01:43:19,531
- They all are experts.
- I'm planning to...

2926
01:43:19,532 --> 01:43:21,062
open a restaurant in April.

2927
01:43:21,832 --> 01:43:23,131
- Really?
- Gosh.

2928
01:43:23,132 --> 01:43:24,631
(That was how the 5 cooking models were gathered.)

2929
01:43:24,632 --> 01:43:26,841
- My gosh.
- These days, models are...

2930
01:43:26,842 --> 01:43:28,702
- in the restaurant business.
- Right.

2931
01:43:28,872 --> 01:43:31,212
(Only 30 days are given to us.)

2932
01:43:31,542 --> 01:43:32,781
(Only 5 chances to be in the 5-day market)

2933
01:43:32,782 --> 01:43:34,111
(The 18th is the day of the shoot.)

2934
01:43:34,112 --> 01:43:35,752
"There are five chances." They actually participated.

2935
01:43:37,312 --> 01:43:38,682
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

2936
01:43:39,552 --> 01:43:42,281
They only had five chances.

2937
01:43:42,282 --> 01:43:44,522
- They went through so much.
- Right.

2938
01:43:44,622 --> 01:43:46,921
- They had to be outside.
- Right.

2939
01:43:46,922 --> 01:43:48,621
They purposely used items that were already used.

2940
01:43:48,622 --> 01:43:50,032
(They set up everything for actual business use.)

2941
01:43:50,692 --> 01:43:53,132
(A perfect workplace must be created.)

2942
01:43:53,932 --> 01:43:57,331
(In the midst Yangpyeong's 5-day market)

2943
01:43:57,332 --> 01:43:58,632
They actually ran a business. Gosh.

2944
01:43:59,002 --> 01:44:01,402
Sixth Sense makes them actually run a business now.

2945
01:44:01,872 --> 01:44:04,671
- They actually ran a business.
- They ran a business there.

2946
01:44:04,672 --> 01:44:07,411
The customer that said he came twice before must be real.

2947
01:44:07,412 --> 01:44:08,482
- He must be real.
- Right.

2948
01:44:08,582 --> 01:44:11,212
- Let's do this.
- Shall we get ready now?

2949
01:44:11,482 --> 01:44:12,821
- It's my first time using this.
- It must've been hard...

2950
01:44:12,822 --> 01:44:13,922
as they'd never done that before.

2951
01:44:14,352 --> 01:44:15,822
I think all of them will burn at this speed.

2952
01:44:17,122 --> 01:44:19,261
- It smells burnt.
- Gosh.

2953
01:44:19,262 --> 01:44:21,322
They weren't able to control the fire.

2954
01:44:22,122 --> 01:44:23,132
It burns so quickly.

2955
01:44:23,632 --> 01:44:24,892
(Failing with the burger)

2956
01:44:25,262 --> 01:44:26,331
Even the burger?

2957
01:44:26,332 --> 01:44:27,532
(Feeling upset with him)

2958
01:44:28,432 --> 01:44:30,301
- No. It tastes undercooked.
- Right?

2959
01:44:30,302 --> 01:44:32,102
They all failed at first.

2960
01:44:32,302 --> 01:44:34,472
It's really different. It's tough out here.

2961
01:44:34,842 --> 01:44:36,912
It's really different being outside.

2962
01:44:37,312 --> 01:44:39,642
- It's hard to cook outside.
- Right.

2963
01:44:40,012 --> 01:44:42,752
It's tough. It's hard to work with the fire.

2964
01:44:42,852 --> 01:44:44,852
(Still, we must succeed.)

2965
01:44:45,282 --> 01:44:47,382
It's my first day of practice.

2966
01:44:47,482 --> 01:44:49,692
I'll be thinking that I'm actually running a business.

2967
01:44:50,622 --> 01:44:51,721
Gosh, it's hot.

2968
01:44:51,722 --> 01:44:53,691
- They practiced a lot.
- Gosh, it didn't work.

2969
01:44:53,692 --> 01:44:54,722
(Failing with the braised chicken ramyeon)

2970
01:44:55,062 --> 01:44:56,991
It's important to check in between.

2971
01:44:56,992 --> 01:44:59,832
Gosh, they went through so much.

2972
01:45:00,002 --> 01:45:01,661
(Practice and more practice)

2973
01:45:01,662 --> 01:45:02,732
The dumpling balls.

2974
01:45:03,602 --> 01:45:05,902
- We started a business here.
- Our seniors.

2975
01:45:06,302 --> 01:45:07,302
Hello.

2976
01:45:07,602 --> 01:45:10,372
- Gosh, they went through so much.
- Gosh, they went through so much.

2977
01:45:11,172 --> 01:45:12,542
That's amazing.

2978
01:45:13,112 --> 01:45:14,982
(The results got better with their efforts.)

2979
01:45:15,412 --> 01:45:17,452
It must be stir-fried toward the middle.

2980
01:45:18,112 --> 01:45:19,112
(With the help of the Food Team, it got eye-catching looks.)

2981
01:45:19,113 --> 01:45:20,922
- The paella was good too, right?
- Right.

2982
01:45:21,922 --> 01:45:22,992
It's a hard dish to make.

2983
01:45:26,122 --> 01:45:27,122
Gosh.

2984
01:45:28,622 --> 01:45:30,762
(From handsome models...)

2985
01:45:31,462 --> 01:45:33,802
(to 5 handsome owners)

2986
01:45:33,902 --> 01:45:35,532
Gosh, check out their physiques. That's great.

2987
01:45:36,232 --> 01:45:38,072
("Physical: 100")

2988
01:45:38,932 --> 01:45:39,972
That came out automatically.

2989
01:45:40,042 --> 01:45:41,071
(The last day in business before the shoot)

2990
01:45:41,072 --> 01:45:43,072
They participated up to 5 times in the 5-day market?

2991
01:45:43,542 --> 01:45:45,012
They actually ran a business.

2992
01:45:45,542 --> 01:45:46,982
This is how things are done now.

2993
01:45:47,612 --> 01:45:48,841
(Their cooking skills have upgraded.)

2994
01:45:48,842 --> 01:45:49,912
Gosh.

2995
01:45:50,112 --> 01:45:51,882
Who ordered the kimchi dumplings and meat dumplings?

2996
01:45:52,282 --> 01:45:53,522
Your ramyeon is here.

2997
01:45:54,122 --> 01:45:55,381
(Astonished)

2998
01:45:55,382 --> 01:45:57,852
- That isn't easy to do.
- Seriously.

2999
01:45:57,952 --> 01:46:00,822
- They had to cook and serve.
- That's amazing.

3000
01:46:01,562 --> 01:46:03,162
- That's the man we saw.
- It's him.

3001
01:46:03,932 --> 01:46:06,162
- The food is great.
- The food was really good.

3002
01:46:06,662 --> 01:46:09,372
Didn't we just have breakfast?

3003
01:46:11,032 --> 01:46:13,271
The soup of the braised chicken ramyeon was great.

3004
01:46:13,272 --> 01:46:15,042
(The best dish is the braised chicken ramyeon!)

3005
01:46:15,402 --> 01:46:16,871
- The ramyeon was good.
- The soup was great.

3006
01:46:16,872 --> 01:46:18,642
Who came up with the recipe?

3007
01:46:19,312 --> 01:46:20,312
It was made really well.

3008
01:46:20,313 --> 01:46:21,382
(The braised chicken ramyeon recipe everyone is curious about)

3009
01:46:21,942 --> 01:46:23,712
(But...)

3010
01:46:24,152 --> 01:46:26,052
(a familiar mouth is seen?)

3011
01:46:26,752 --> 01:46:27,822
- This is so good.
- What?

3012
01:46:28,422 --> 01:46:29,422
Right!

3013
01:46:30,392 --> 01:46:32,591
- It's the same one.
- Gosh.

3014
01:46:32,592 --> 01:46:33,992
- Really?
- Right?

3015
01:46:34,462 --> 01:46:35,522
My gosh!

3016
01:46:35,792 --> 01:46:37,762
We had that during Season One!

3017
01:46:38,062 --> 01:46:39,962
- Right.
- Right!

3018
01:46:40,202 --> 01:46:42,132
It's the ramyeon that I enjoyed back then.

3019
01:46:42,362 --> 01:46:44,032
(Why did that appear again?)

3020
01:46:44,732 --> 01:46:47,672
(We prepared this for you during the cold winter again.)

3021
01:46:48,672 --> 01:46:50,611
- I remembered that taste!
- My gosh.

3022
01:46:50,612 --> 01:46:52,371
- Right.
- Gosh, Jae Seok!

3023
01:46:52,372 --> 01:46:53,912
(Season 1's braised chicken ramyeon was recreated!)

3024
01:46:54,442 --> 01:46:57,351
(To the braised chicken ramyeon of Season 1...)

3025
01:46:57,352 --> 01:46:58,412
Awesome.

3026
01:46:59,252 --> 01:47:01,322
It was the same ramyeon from back then.

3027
01:47:02,692 --> 01:47:04,322
How did you remember that taste?

3028
01:47:04,752 --> 01:47:06,422
(It was the taste of a big company.)

3029
01:47:06,822 --> 01:47:09,492
(The name he mentioned often during the previous season)

3030
01:47:10,432 --> 01:47:12,701
(The taste of the big company was added as well.)

3031
01:47:12,702 --> 01:47:14,732
- Awesome.
- I can never forget that taste.

3032
01:47:15,162 --> 01:47:17,502
Indeed, I love the taste of big companies.

3033
01:47:18,872 --> 01:47:20,502
- The taste of big companies.
- I love the taste of big companies.

3034
01:47:21,142 --> 01:47:22,911
To be honest, freelancer models...

3035
01:47:22,912 --> 01:47:25,711
have irregular work schedules and irregular incomes.

3036
01:47:25,712 --> 01:47:26,941
There are many models...
