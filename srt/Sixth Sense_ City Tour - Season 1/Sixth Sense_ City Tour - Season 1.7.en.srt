00:00:15,242 --> 00:00:19,382
(It's the end of February, and winter is still in the air.)

00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:23,731
(Where have the Sixth Sense members come to today?)

3
00:00:23,831 --> 00:00:25,360
- We are... - Oh, my.

4
00:00:25,361 --> 00:00:27,600
at the Incheon Landing Operation Memorial Hall, right?

5
00:00:27,601 --> 00:00:29,241
- That's right. - Oh, my.

6
00:00:29,741 --> 00:00:30,940
It's very cold today.

7
00:00:30,941 --> 00:00:32,611
The snow is so nice.

8
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:35,410
(It snowed overnight.)

9
00:00:35,411 --> 00:00:37,281
I haven't been here in a while.

10
00:00:37,781 --> 00:00:39,710
Oh, Incheon...

11
00:00:39,711 --> 00:00:41,380
- Oh, my! - And Songdo.

12
00:00:41,381 --> 00:00:42,381
(The Sixth Sense members are looking at...)

13
00:00:42,382 --> 00:00:44,351
Oh, that wasn't there 20 years ago.

14
00:00:44,881 --> 00:00:45,890
So cool.

(Oh, my. What is this?)

24
00:01:18,651 --> 00:01:22,351
(An impressive trendy place that shocked our members)

25
00:01:22,621 --> 00:01:26,231
(Out of Incheon's trendy places, which one is fake?)

26
00:01:27,491 --> 00:01:29,760
This is Kyoung Pyo's hometown.

27
00:01:29,761 --> 00:01:30,800
- You said it was your hometown. - Yes.

28
00:01:30,801 --> 00:01:32,160
This is my 1st time being back in 20 years.

29
00:01:32,161 --> 00:01:33,400
Where in Incheon are you from?

30
00:01:33,401 --> 00:01:34,830
- Ganseok-dong. - Ganseok-dong.

31
00:01:34,831 --> 00:01:36,970
Yes. It's a bit far from here.

32
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,540
When I was young, we often came here for outings.

33
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:40,511
- Oh, this place. - Oh, for outings.

34
00:01:40,641 --> 00:01:46,981
(Kyoung Pyo lived in Incheon until he was 20 years old.)

35
00:01:48,711 --> 00:01:49,820
So cool.

36
00:01:49,821 --> 00:01:51,281
(He's finally back in his hometown, Incheon.)

37
00:01:51,381 --> 00:01:53,720
It's so cold today.

38
00:01:53,721 --> 00:01:55,250
- Seriously. - The wind.

39
00:01:55,251 --> 00:01:56,820
- Right. We're on a hill. - It's cold.

40
00:01:56,821 --> 00:01:58,720
- The wind is cold. - The wind is pretty cold.

41
00:01:58,721 --> 00:02:00,591
I think it's colder than Suwon.

42
00:02:01,361 --> 00:02:04,200
Oh, you must be really cold right now.

43
00:02:04,201 --> 00:02:05,430
- But Mimi... - No.

44
00:02:05,431 --> 00:02:07,400
- gets hot while in the car. - Right.

45
00:02:07,401 --> 00:02:09,070
It feels stuffy in the car.

46
00:02:09,071 --> 00:02:11,470
- I don't know what coldness is. - I see.

47
00:02:11,471 --> 00:02:13,241
That just sounded like an interview from the 90s.

48
00:02:14,411 --> 00:02:15,941
- The Seoul accent? - Yes.

49
00:02:16,341 --> 00:02:17,780
(90s Seoul accent, Wearing combat boots...)

50
00:02:17,781 --> 00:02:19,711

00:02:24,821 --> 00:02:27,220
- Today is a day for earmuffs. - Seriously.

54
00:02:27,221 --> 00:02:28,420
Okay. Here it is.

55

- This place must be very fast. - "Super Fast."

75
00:03:23,611 --> 00:03:24,640
And this second place...

76
00:03:24,641 --> 00:03:25,641
- sells something really big. - Right.

77
00:03:25,642 --> 00:03:27,950
The "Super Fascinating" one must have weird stuff.

78
00:03:27,951 --> 00:03:28,951
Yes, some weird stuff.

- Does it say somewhere? - How do you know that?

102
00:04:09,591 --> 00:04:11,090
That's the F-86 or something.

- What? - That. Is that an armored car?

108
00:04:19,901 --> 00:04:21,670
That's an armored car for landing operations.

109
00:04:21,671 --> 00:04:23,200
- For landing operations. - That way.

110
00:04:23,201 --> 00:04:25,600
- Then what is this? - What?

111
00:04:25,601 --> 00:04:26,871
That's an armored car. What is this?

112
00:04:27,071 --> 00:04:28,271
- This is armor. - Yes.

What is this? This looks strange.

119
00:04:38,651 --> 00:04:40,250
(Oh, gosh.)

120
00:04:40,251 --> 00:04:42,020
It already feels better down here compared to up there.

121
00:04:42,021 --> 00:04:43,090
- Seriously. - Seriously.

122
00:04:43,091 --> 00:04:44,360

- A skating zone. - Oh, no.

127
00:04:50,431 --> 00:04:52,061
- I won't slip. - You won't?

128
00:04:52,801 --> 00:04:56,141
(Skating across)

129
00:04:56,941 --> 00:04:58,300
You look like Macaulay Culkin today.

130
00:04:58,301 --> 00:04:59,311
You're right.

131
00:05:00,241 --> 00:05:02,680
(Culkin's doppelganger)

132
00:05:02,681 --> 00:05:04,310
Macaulay Culkin is dressed like that when he goes to New York.

133
00:05:04,311 --> 00:05:06,410
You know his name is Macaulay Macaulay Culkin Culkin now, right?

134
00:05:06,411 --> 00:05:08,510

- in Hollywood. The handprints. - Oh, really?

139
00:05:16,821 --> 00:05:17,920
- Yes. - Really?

140
00:05:17,921 --> 00:05:18,921

141
00:05:19,061 --> 00:05:20,360

144
00:05:23,631 --> 00:05:25,800
- Oh, my. - It's so big. What is this place?

145
00:05:25,801 --> 00:05:27,301
- It must be a cafe. - Oh, my.

146
00:05:27,831 --> 00:05:29,740
These days, there are lots of these huge...

147
00:05:29,741 --> 00:05:31,140
This is amazing.

148
00:05:31,141 --> 00:05:32,641
(They're meeting the guests at this huge place in Incheon!)

149
00:05:32,741 --> 00:05:33,940
Whenever I see things like this,

150
00:05:33,941 --> 00:05:36,110
- I think, "Are they profitable?" - Exactly.

151
00:05:36,111 --> 00:05:37,740
- This must cost so much money. - That's right.

152
00:05:37,741 --> 00:05:39,610
Your concern is so...

153
00:05:39,611 --> 00:05:41,251
Totally.

154
00:05:41,851 --> 00:05:44,221
This place is huge.

155
00:05:44,481 --> 00:05:45,581
- Oh, my. - Oh, my.

156
00:05:45,821 --> 00:05:47,220
Oh, that's a botanical garden.

157
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:48,820
- It's like a botanical garden. - Oh, my!

158
00:05:48,821 --> 00:05:49,891
(Oh, my!)

159
00:05:50,091 --> 00:05:51,091
Oh, my.

160
00:05:51,092 --> 00:05:53,030
It's so pretty.

161
00:05:53,031 --> 00:05:54,760
Oh, my. There are butterflies too.

162
00:05:54,761 --> 00:05:55,990
It feels like we came to a theme park.

163
00:05:55,991 --> 00:05:57,360
- Totally. - Totally.

164
00:05:57,361 --> 00:05:59,030
Isn't this a botanical garden?

165
00:05:59,031 --> 00:06:00,970
There are stepping stones too.

166
00:06:00,971 --> 00:06:01,971
Seriously.

167
00:06:02,231 --> 00:06:04,470
This place is so big.

168
00:06:04,471 --> 00:06:05,900
It's so nice to come here in the middle of the winter.

169
00:06:05,901 --> 00:06:07,671
- Yes. - It feels like we're traveling.

170
00:06:07,841 --> 00:06:09,170
(Spring, summer, fall, winter)

171
00:06:09,171 --> 00:06:11,041
(The concept changes with the seasons.)

172
00:06:11,681 --> 00:06:14,451
(A truly trendy place that's also famous on social media!)

173
00:06:15,811 --> 00:06:17,680
(The best photo spot)

174
00:06:17,681 --> 00:06:18,750
The butterflies are moving.

175
00:06:18,751 --> 00:06:21,121
Do you know what I think whenever I see things like this?

176
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:23,461
That I really don't know anything about the world.

177
00:06:24,821 --> 00:06:26,690
- A nice place like this... - You're right.

178
00:06:26,691 --> 00:06:28,291
- Why... - Totally.

179
00:06:28,531 --> 00:06:30,430
It's so pretty.

180
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:31,931
- Oh, my. - It's so pretty!

181
00:06:33,731 --> 00:06:35,371
- Eun I! - Oh, my.

182
00:06:35,731 --> 00:06:37,840
- That side is cool too. - Oh, my gosh.

183
00:06:37,841 --> 00:06:39,170
This is insane.

184
00:06:39,171 --> 00:06:40,440
- It's as big as a market. - Oh, my.

185
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:41,441
Oh, my!

186
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:45,141
(A huge bakery zone)

187
00:06:45,341 --> 00:06:46,481
So pretty!

188
00:06:47,151 --> 00:06:48,210
This looks good.

189
00:06:48,211 --> 00:06:49,451
- Macarons and the strawberry one. - This looks so good.

190
00:06:49,781 --> 00:06:52,450
Shall we start the day with some sweets again?

191
00:06:52,451 --> 00:06:53,650
Let's do that.

192
00:06:53,651 --> 00:06:57,991
(An endless array of pastries on display)

193
00:06:58,591 --> 00:07:00,331
I love it. This is amazing.

194
00:07:01,231 --> 00:07:02,590
This is insane.

195
00:07:02,591 --> 00:07:03,761
(Fancy pastries catch their eyes.)

196
00:07:03,861 --> 00:07:06,400
The sausage bread looks so delicious too.

197
00:07:06,401 --> 00:07:08,771
(A trendy place in Incheon bursting with sweets)

198
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:10,570
Oh, my! What should we do, Eun I?

199
00:07:10,571 --> 00:07:11,571
(Dazed by the explosion of sweets)

200
00:07:11,572 --> 00:07:12,700
Hey, it's Dubai chocolate.

201
00:07:12,701 --> 00:07:14,040
- Oh, my. - Oh, Dubai chocolate.

202
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,640
- Should we buy one? - Should we buy one?

203
00:07:15,641 --> 00:07:16,711
Should we buy one?

204
00:07:16,881 --> 00:07:18,310
- We should buy two. - Yes.

205
00:07:18,311 --> 00:07:19,811
- Let's take this. - If we want a bite each.

206
00:07:20,251 --> 00:07:21,650
It says Udo Peanut Churroisant.

207
00:07:21,651 --> 00:07:23,220
This has to be good.

208
00:07:23,221 --> 00:07:24,480
It looks pretty too.

209
00:07:24,481 --> 00:07:25,850
I think it must taste good too.

210
00:07:25,851 --> 00:07:27,950
- This blueberry one... - Go ahead.

211
00:07:27,951 --> 00:07:29,791
- It says it's a hit. - It's a hit.

212
00:07:30,321 --> 00:07:32,830
- It's a hit. No. - Why are you buying so much?

213
00:07:32,831 --> 00:07:35,330
Aren't Koreans so good?

214
00:07:35,331 --> 00:07:37,330
- Let's have a scone. - A scone.

215
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:38,331
(Childish Yu wants a scone.)

216
00:07:38,361 --> 00:07:39,400
We're just getting a taste.

217
00:07:39,401 --> 00:07:41,601
Oh, this looks delicious too.

218
00:07:41,901 --> 00:07:43,940
This? Corn croque monsieur? Do you want to try it?

219
00:07:43,941 --> 00:07:44,970
- Oh, my. - Sure.

220
00:07:44,971 --> 00:07:47,070
That was the first one Kyoung Pyo said looked good.

221
00:07:47,071 --> 00:07:48,071
Should we get a chocolate one too?

222
00:07:48,072 --> 00:07:49,681
- Let's stop here. - We have too much already.

223
00:07:49,941 --> 00:07:52,340
- Alligators look good too. - Should we order beverages?

224
00:07:52,341 --> 00:07:53,350
- Oh, my. - Oh, my.

225
00:07:53,351 --> 00:07:54,351
(The danger of an empty stomach, You grab everything you see.)

226
00:07:54,352 --> 00:07:55,450
We're really impressive.

227
00:07:55,451 --> 00:07:58,421
An avocado banana smoothie, please.

228
00:07:58,751 --> 00:08:01,450
I want to try the tangerine latte.

229
00:08:01,451 --> 00:08:03,690
You are the daughter of Jeju.

230
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:04,860
- The daughter of Jeju. - It just came to mind.

231
00:08:04,861 --> 00:08:06,560
- The thought just came up. - Okay.

232
00:08:06,561 --> 00:08:08,230
- We're all different. - You brought your card again.

233
00:08:08,231 --> 00:08:10,100
- You're the best. - He brought it.

234
00:08:10,101 --> 00:08:11,860
Is your card...

235
00:08:11,861 --> 00:08:14,170
- always automatically charged? - Samsung Pay.

236
00:08:14,171 --> 00:08:16,340
- I see. - "Automatically charged?"

237
00:08:16,341 --> 00:08:18,101
It's always fully charged.

238
00:08:18,401 --> 00:08:19,401
Yes.

239
00:08:19,611 --> 00:08:20,710
- The card system... - Hey.

240
00:08:20,711 --> 00:08:22,980
Gosh, it's 100 dollars.

241
00:08:22,981 --> 00:08:24,881
- It's 100 dollars. - It's still the morning...

242
00:08:25,211 --> 00:08:27,980
It's still the morning, and I spent so much money at a cafe.

243
00:08:27,981 --> 00:08:29,680
- It's 100 dollars. - What?

244
00:08:29,681 --> 00:08:30,681
- Wait... - It's 100 dollars.

245
00:08:31,951 --> 00:08:34,251
- It's still the morning... - It's 100 dollars.

246
00:08:34,491 --> 00:08:36,361
It's not common to spend 100 dollars on bread in the morning.

247
00:08:37,191 --> 00:08:38,390
- But... - Sorry, were we too greedy?

248
00:08:38,391 --> 00:08:39,731
- We're sorry. - Because...

249
00:08:40,131 --> 00:08:42,290
It's a lot of money for a morning snack,

250
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,401
but otherwise, they wouldn't be profitable.

251
00:08:45,001 --> 00:08:46,970
- Hello. - Hello.

252
00:08:46,971 --> 00:08:48,870
- How... - Why are you here so early?

253
00:08:48,871 --> 00:08:50,500
- Oh, the second floor. Hello. - Hello.

254
00:08:50,501 --> 00:08:52,270
Oh, my. I wonder what kind of gathering it is.

255
00:08:52,271 --> 00:08:54,410
Do you have a meeting this morning?

256
00:08:54,411 --> 00:08:56,541
(I love you.)

257
00:08:57,841 --> 00:08:58,940
It's so nice.

258
00:08:58,941 --> 00:09:00,250
(We love you too!)

259
00:09:00,251 --> 00:09:02,510
- This is a well-known place. - Yes.

260
00:09:02,511 --> 00:09:03,581
Come this way.

261
00:09:03,821 --> 00:09:05,650
- Hurry. - Hurry.

262
00:09:05,651 --> 00:09:06,921
This really is amazing.

263
00:09:07,721 --> 00:09:10,760
One of our staff members said...

264
00:09:10,761 --> 00:09:12,821
- they were coming here tomorrow. - Right.

265
00:09:13,361 --> 00:09:15,630
- With their significant other. - Right.

266
00:09:15,631 --> 00:09:16,631
They're coming here tomorrow.
Oh, how romantic.

267
00:09:17,631 --> 00:09:18,631
("Can you direct love?" by Director Song Eun I)

268
00:09:18,632 --> 00:09:19,900
Right. They'll come here.

269
00:09:19,901 --> 00:09:21,970
"Oh, how do you know so many places like this?"'

270
00:09:21,971 --> 00:09:23,971
"It's no big deal." Saying things like that.

271
00:09:24,471 --> 00:09:26,540
"Shooting here reminded me of you."

272
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:27,570
Oh, how romantic.

273
00:09:27,571 --> 00:09:31,041
- Are you acting out a date? - Yes.

274
00:09:31,841 --> 00:09:32,950
It must go like that, right?

275
00:09:32,951 --> 00:09:34,550
I was just imagining it.

276
00:09:34,551 --> 00:09:35,551
It must be that kind of mood.

277
00:09:36,651 --> 00:09:39,890
(Meanwhile, the two are really on a date.)

278
00:09:39,891 --> 00:09:41,850
(- Can we take a picture here? - Come here!)

279
00:09:41,851 --> 00:09:43,321
(Flower pose!)

280
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:44,860
(Who are these two taking pictures?)

281
00:09:44,861 --> 00:09:46,091
When will it take the picture?

282
00:09:46,531 --> 00:09:47,761
There are three seconds left.

283
00:09:48,561 --> 00:09:49,761
What should we do?

284
00:09:50,361 --> 00:09:53,730
(Suddenly grabbing him by the collar)

285
00:09:53,731 --> 00:09:55,070
Let's do that.

286
00:09:55,071 --> 00:09:56,741
- Is it over? - Oh, it's over. What?

287
00:09:57,501 --> 00:10:00,311
(They were lawyers on "Extraordinary Attorney Woo.")

288
00:10:00,911 --> 00:10:03,341
(Ha Yoon Kyung, Young Woo's coworker who is like spring sunshine)

289
00:10:03,981 --> 00:10:07,251
(Kang Ki Young, the standard of workplace bosses)

290
00:10:07,381 --> 00:10:10,481
(Today's tour friends who seem completely harmless!)

291
00:10:10,981 --> 00:10:12,681
We won't bring down the mood, right?

292
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,790
- Oh, no. - I hope it's a friendly vibe.

293
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,721
- My heart is racing. - Is it super delicious?

294
00:10:17,161 --> 00:10:18,291
Oh, they're here!

295
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:19,731
Oh, my!

296
00:10:21,261 --> 00:10:22,961
- Oh, my! - Hello.

297
00:10:23,061 --> 00:10:24,730
- Oh, Yoon Kyung. - Hello!

298
00:10:24,731 --> 00:10:26,230
- Welcome. - Hello.

299
00:10:26,231 --> 00:10:28,831
- Hello. - Hello.

300
00:10:28,832 --> 00:10:30,971
You have something on your mouth.

301
00:10:31,441 --> 00:10:33,340
Oh, my beauty salon friend. Why weren't you there today?

302
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,740
Oh, I found a new salon.

303
00:10:34,741 --> 00:10:36,481
(Cutting ties)

304
00:10:36,911 --> 00:10:38,610
- I used to go to the same one too. - Oh, beauty salon friend.

305
00:10:38,611 --> 00:10:41,650
- But I found a new one too. - Oh, really? How sad.

306
00:10:41,651 --> 00:10:43,521
It's Spring Sunshine Choi Soo Yeon.

307
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,981
Come here. It's nice to see you.

308
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:49,190
- Hello. It's nice to meet you. - Sit anywhere.

309
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:51,220
I used to live in Incheon.

310
00:10:51,221 --> 00:10:52,890
- Really? - I'm from Yeonsu-gu, Incheon.

311
00:10:52,891 --> 00:10:55,531
- Oh, you're from Incheon? - I lived here for over 20 years.

312
00:10:55,891 --> 00:10:57,501
There are many people from Incheon.

313
00:10:57,561 --> 00:10:59,260
- You're from the same place. - Yes.

314
00:10:59,261 --> 00:11:01,230
- Are you from Incheon too? - Yes, I was born in Namdong-gu.

315
00:11:01,231 --> 00:11:03,300
- I was born in Gil Hospital. - I was born in Gil Hospital too.

316
00:11:03,301 --> 00:11:04,701
- Oh, really? - Yes.

317
00:11:05,101 --> 00:11:06,510
They were born in the same hospital.

318
00:11:06,511 --> 00:11:07,911
You were born in the same hospital.

319
00:11:08,071 --> 00:11:11,310
- Founded by Ms. Lee Gil Ya... - Right.

320
00:11:11,311 --> 00:11:13,551
- She's still healthy. - She's 90 but still healthy.

321
00:11:13,781 --> 00:11:15,251
She's very healthy.

322
00:11:15,411 --> 00:11:17,420
How have you been, Ki Young?

323
00:11:17,421 --> 00:11:19,921
- I've been shooting a drama. - I see.

324
00:11:20,591 --> 00:11:22,121
It's called "Mary Kills People."

325
00:11:22,251 --> 00:11:25,461
- It will air on MBC. - I see.

326
00:11:25,691 --> 00:11:27,730
"Mary Kills People." That sounds kind of scary.

327
00:11:27,731 --> 00:11:29,130
Seriously. Is it about killers?

328
00:11:29,131 --> 00:11:30,900
It's originally a Canadian drama.

329
00:11:30,901 --> 00:11:32,100
(A remake of a Canadian drama by the same name)

330
00:11:32,101 --> 00:11:33,601
The topic is a bit unique.

331
00:11:33,871 --> 00:11:36,470
Ki Young has a different look in his eyes...

332
00:11:36,471 --> 00:11:37,501
when he's filming something.

333
00:11:38,101 --> 00:11:39,171
Yes, a bit...

334
00:11:39,271 --> 00:11:41,210
- He becomes more confident. - You're right.

335
00:11:41,211 --> 00:11:43,481
When he's not working on anything, he seems a bit down.

336
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,881
Work makes him happy.

337
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:47,610
(So happy)

338
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:48,751
Work makes him happy.

339
00:11:48,881 --> 00:11:50,881
- That's very accurate. Yes. - Right?

340
00:11:51,121 --> 00:11:52,250
How about you, Yoon Kyung?

341
00:11:52,251 --> 00:11:53,750
I'm also filming something.

342
00:11:53,751 --> 00:11:55,250
- Oh, you are? - Yes.

343
00:11:55,251 --> 00:11:57,260
It's a historical drama, but I...

344
00:11:57,261 --> 00:11:59,320
didn't come here to promote it, so I don't have to say anything.

345
00:11:59,321 --> 00:12:00,330
(So cool)

346
00:12:00,331 --> 00:12:02,691
Ki Young also isn't here to promote his drama, right?

347
00:12:02,831 --> 00:12:05,201
Well, that too...

348
00:12:05,701 --> 00:12:06,831
If I can do both...

349
00:12:06,901 --> 00:12:08,971
(What a cutie.)

350
00:12:09,001 --> 00:12:10,970
(Please watch "Mary Kills People.")

351
00:12:10,971 --> 00:12:13,510
Have you two worked together, Kyoung Pyo and Ki Young?

352
00:12:13,511 --> 00:12:15,070
I haven't worked with either of them...

353
00:12:15,071 --> 00:12:17,480
- on anything. Yes. - Oh, really?

354
00:12:17,481 --> 00:12:19,681
And it's been a few years since I filmed something.

355
00:12:20,111 --> 00:12:21,381
I'm a variety show person now.

356
00:12:21,751 --> 00:12:24,181
(Coughing)

357
00:12:24,951 --> 00:12:26,320
(Glancing over)

358
00:12:26,321 --> 00:12:27,391
So Mimi...

359
00:12:27,451 --> 00:12:29,290
ordered a tangerine latte not knowing it was coffee.

360
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:30,621
So she hasn't had even one sip of it.

361
00:12:30,921 --> 00:12:32,360
- You ordered it... - I quit coffee.

362
00:12:32,361 --> 00:12:33,630
because you liked tangerines,

363
00:12:33,631 --> 00:12:35,891
- but you forgot the latte part... - Yes, I didn't think about it.

364
00:12:36,431 --> 00:12:39,230
- I didn't think about it. - She ordered a tangerine latte...

365
00:12:39,231 --> 00:12:41,300
She ordered a tangerine latte to avoid having coffee.

366
00:12:41,301 --> 00:12:42,800
(She ordered a tangerine latte with coffee to avoid having coffee.)

367
00:12:42,801 --> 00:12:44,001
- That's what happened. - Right.

368
00:12:44,301 --> 00:12:45,871
To avoid having coffee.

369
00:12:46,001 --> 00:12:47,311
It's so unfortunate.

370
00:12:48,311 --> 00:12:49,540
- Well, then... - Shall we go?

371
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:50,680
- Let's get going. - Shall we go?

372
00:12:50,681 --> 00:12:52,910
To be honest, I don't really know what we're doing today.

373
00:12:52,911 --> 00:12:54,981
You don't need to know, Ki Young.

374
00:12:55,581 --> 00:12:56,780
- Really? - Yes.

375
00:12:56,781 --> 00:12:58,481
(Will they be able to find the fake today?)

376
00:13:00,021 --> 00:13:03,861
(Heading super fast to the first trendy place)

377
00:13:04,491 --> 00:13:06,460
Even when we're still inside, it's cold.

378
00:13:06,461 --> 00:13:08,160
(Oh, gosh.)

379
00:13:08,161 --> 00:13:10,230
- Let's go by car. - Let's get in the car.

380
00:13:10,231 --> 00:13:11,231
Please close the door.

381
00:13:11,232 --> 00:13:12,461
- We're getting in a car. - I see.

382
00:13:13,331 --> 00:13:14,770
- It's cold. - Yes.

383
00:13:14,771 --> 00:13:16,700
(They're especially happy to go by car today.)

384
00:13:16,701 --> 00:13:17,701
- Mimi. - Mimi.

385
00:13:17,702 --> 00:13:19,000
- Wear your seat belt, Mimi. - Okay.

386
00:13:19,001 --> 00:13:20,910
It doesn't feel like we're shooting anything.

387
00:13:20,911 --> 00:13:22,210
- Right? - Yes.

388
00:13:22,211 --> 00:13:23,280
You need to stay alert.

389
00:13:23,281 --> 00:13:25,240
- It's so natural. - Yes.

390
00:13:25,241 --> 00:13:26,851
We've made four wrong guesses.

391
00:13:27,781 --> 00:13:29,250
We have to get it right today.

392
00:13:29,251 --> 00:13:30,350
Right.

393
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,550
- Oh, it's really hard. - We have to do well today.

394
00:13:32,551 --> 00:13:34,190
It's really hard.

395
00:13:34,191 --> 00:13:35,621
It's seriously hard.

396
00:13:35,721 --> 00:13:36,891
Oh, really?

397
00:13:37,121 --> 00:13:38,721
They really fooled Mimi.

398
00:13:40,031 --> 00:13:42,430
Mimi's social media...

399
00:13:42,431 --> 00:13:43,531
is already polluted.

400
00:13:45,201 --> 00:13:46,671
I'm a slave of Sixth Sense.

401
00:13:48,771 --> 00:13:51,270
That pop-up store...

402
00:13:51,271 --> 00:13:52,441
Exactly.

403
00:13:53,211 --> 00:13:54,970
Back in the day, the celebrities from Incheon...

404
00:13:54,971 --> 00:13:56,581
were Gu Ra, Shinji,

405
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,780
- Sang Yeol. - and Sang Yeol.

406
00:13:58,781 --> 00:14:00,280
But these days, there are so many celebrities from Incheon.

407
00:14:00,281 --> 00:14:02,480
There are many new stars from Incheon.

408
00:14:02,481 --> 00:14:04,480
You're right. There are so many from Incheon.

409
00:14:04,481 --> 00:14:05,550
(Ki Young, a new star from Incheon)

410
00:14:05,551 --> 00:14:07,391
Kyoung Pyo was the start.

411
00:14:07,491 --> 00:14:10,160
- Oh, really? - Before... I suddenly remembered.

412
00:14:10,161 --> 00:14:12,120
Before, in Itaewon,

413
00:14:12,121 --> 00:14:14,790
several years ago, I saw you.

414
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,290
My friend said,

415
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:17,900
"Isn't that Ko Kyoung Pyo?" And I said,

416
00:14:17,901 --> 00:14:19,360
"It's definitely not him."'

417
00:14:19,361 --> 00:14:21,230
Because he was dressed so casually.

418
00:14:21,231 --> 00:14:22,271
Slippers...

419
00:14:22,871 --> 00:14:24,670
- Then it was Kyoung Pyo. - That famous outfit.

420
00:14:24,671 --> 00:14:26,000
It was on the main street.

421
00:14:26,001 --> 00:14:27,240
Oh, he went to the main street...

422
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,740
- in that famous outfit, I see. - He was just in slippers.

423
00:14:28,741 --> 00:14:29,870
Right.

424
00:14:29,871 --> 00:14:31,711
I used to go around like that a lot.

425
00:14:32,681 --> 00:14:35,581
Kyoung Pyo is an attention-seeker.

426
00:14:37,151 --> 00:14:39,380
- I pretend not to be. - Right, he pretends not to be.

427
00:14:39,381 --> 00:14:41,390
- As if it's normal for me. - That's why he's always...

428
00:14:41,391 --> 00:14:43,490
That looked really nice to me.

429
00:14:43,491 --> 00:14:44,791
(I liked how casual he was.)

430
00:14:44,891 --> 00:14:47,331
- She liked it. - Yes, I really did.

431
00:14:48,061 --> 00:14:50,000
This is my favorite thing about Kyoung Pyo.

432
00:14:50,001 --> 00:14:52,131
How he dances and has fun at award ceremonies.

433
00:14:52,501 --> 00:14:54,700
- We need actors like this. - Right.

434
00:14:54,701 --> 00:14:57,600
- I really support you. - Totally.

435
00:14:57,601 --> 00:14:58,901
- Thank you. - I'm so jealous.

436
00:14:59,701 --> 00:15:03,581
(Kyoung Pyo really made the award ceremony shine.)

437
00:15:08,251 --> 00:15:09,680
(It's Ko Kyoung Pyo's first birthday party.)

438
00:15:09,681 --> 00:15:12,520
(Ko Kyoung Pyo really made it so fun.)

439
00:15:12,521 --> 00:15:13,890
It's nice to have someone like you.

440
00:15:13,891 --> 00:15:15,921
After that day, I started feeling pressure.

441
00:15:16,391 --> 00:15:17,520
- I see. - To satisfy people's expectations?

442
00:15:17,521 --> 00:15:19,060
Because you have to be like that every time.

443
00:15:19,061 --> 00:15:20,390
- I see that. - Right.

444
00:15:20,391 --> 00:15:21,690
The next time I go to an award ceremony,

445
00:15:21,691 --> 00:15:23,300
I'm going to write on a piece of paper,

446
00:15:23,301 --> 00:15:25,261
"I'm not in the mood today."

447
00:15:25,461 --> 00:15:26,801
That's not a bad idea.

448
00:15:27,701 --> 00:15:28,901
But if it's fun, I'll dance.

449
00:15:30,371 --> 00:15:32,640
Yes. You need to live freely like that.

450
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:33,841
(Incheon's dancing machine is coming soon.)

451
00:15:34,011 --> 00:15:36,070
What was your major, Yoon Kyung?

452
00:15:36,071 --> 00:15:37,940
I majored in acting.

453
00:15:37,941 --> 00:15:39,040
Acting.

454
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,380
I enjoyed "Bulk."

455
00:15:40,381 --> 00:15:41,450
Oh, thank you.

456
00:15:41,451 --> 00:15:42,550
- "Gangnam B-Side." - "Gangnam B-Side."

457
00:15:42,551 --> 00:15:43,920
- Oh, "Gangnam B-Side." - The original title was "Bulk."

458
00:15:43,921 --> 00:15:44,981
You're right.

459
00:15:45,221 --> 00:15:46,920
- I haven't... - Have you been in a movie, Mimi?

460
00:15:46,921 --> 00:15:48,151
- Never. - Right.

461
00:15:48,351 --> 00:15:50,320
- I always have ambition. - Nice.

462
00:15:50,321 --> 00:15:51,490
- I like it. - We're all movie people...

463
00:15:51,491 --> 00:15:52,661
except Mimi.

464
00:15:53,631 --> 00:15:55,791
- So cool. - It somehow happened that way.

465
00:15:55,891 --> 00:15:58,530
CEO Song was...

466
00:15:58,531 --> 00:16:00,370
- in "Tirano's Claw," right? - Right.

467
00:16:00,371 --> 00:16:02,930
- That's amazing. - It was...

468
00:16:02,931 --> 00:16:04,700
directed by the great Director Shim Hyung Rae.

469
00:16:04,701 --> 00:16:06,841
- Yes. - Was I number 23 or 34?

470
00:16:07,211 --> 00:16:11,011
("Tirano's Claw," the Korean version of "Jurassic Park" made in 1994)

471
00:16:11,211 --> 00:16:14,051
(Where was actress Eun I?)

472
00:16:16,751 --> 00:16:17,951
(Did you find her?)

473
00:16:18,921 --> 00:16:21,091
(You really have to look closely.)

474
00:16:22,251 --> 00:16:24,721
(Song Eun I, Probably in her 20s, "Primitive person number 23")

475
00:16:24,891 --> 00:16:26,861
But I was praised in the dubbing studio.

476
00:16:28,091 --> 00:16:29,791
I had some emotional scenes.

477
00:16:30,431 --> 00:16:34,200
"Okay. You need to be happy."

478
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:35,871
(Exclaiming)

479
00:16:36,131 --> 00:16:40,441
(You are watching Actress Song's emotional acting.)

480
00:16:40,771 --> 00:16:42,741
(What is that?)

481
00:16:42,771 --> 00:16:45,211
I thought she meant she had a touching scene.

482
00:16:45,281 --> 00:16:46,310
I had no lines.

483
00:16:46,311 --> 00:16:47,510
She was a primitive person...

484
00:16:47,511 --> 00:16:48,681
- who just saw a tyrannosaurus rex. - Oh, a primitive person.

485
00:16:49,251 --> 00:16:50,920
- She was a primitive person. - Yes, exactly.

486
00:16:50,921 --> 00:16:52,420
There were subtitles too.

487
00:16:52,421 --> 00:16:53,421
(The master of acting like a primitive person)

488
00:16:53,591 --> 00:16:55,420
- I also... - "Bulgweri!"

489
00:16:55,421 --> 00:16:59,760
Yes. I was in "Young Gu and Space Monster Bulgweri."

490
00:16:59,761 --> 00:17:01,390
You weren't Bulgweri, right? Were you the class president?

491
00:17:01,391 --> 00:17:02,990
- I was the class president. - He was the class president.

492
00:17:02,991 --> 00:17:06,101
When I was in my mid-20s,

493
00:17:06,531 --> 00:17:07,870
I perfectly played the role...

494
00:17:07,871 --> 00:17:09,200
- of a child class president. - With overalls.

495
00:17:09,201 --> 00:17:10,300
(Child class president)

496
00:17:10,301 --> 00:17:12,271
He played a child when he was 25.

497
00:17:12,441 --> 00:17:14,171
In my mid-20s.

498
00:17:14,441 --> 00:17:17,341
I wore overalls, which even back then, kids didn't really wear.

499
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:22,281
(While Young Gu fought the bad guys,)

500
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:24,921
(a group of elementary schoolers rooted for him.)

501
00:17:25,721 --> 00:17:27,550
(Among them was 23-year-old Jae Seok.)

502
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,291
In my mid-20s,

503
00:17:29,621 --> 00:17:32,061
I perfectly played the role...

504
00:17:32,321 --> 00:17:34,360
of an elementary school class president.

505
00:17:34,361 --> 00:17:36,330
Were your friends elementary schoolers?

506
00:17:36,331 --> 00:17:37,400
No.

507
00:17:37,401 --> 00:17:39,561
- Were they... - They were all older than me.

508
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:41,701
Older men and women.

509
00:17:42,501 --> 00:17:46,840
(Among them, 23-year-old Jae Seok was the youngest.)

510
00:17:46,841 --> 00:17:48,640
- That is hilarious. - That is amazing.

511
00:17:48,641 --> 00:17:50,841
- That's hilarious. - Yes, in my mid-20s.

512
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:52,980
How old are you, Mimi?

513
00:17:52,981 --> 00:17:55,781
I'm from 29 to 31.

514
00:17:56,281 --> 00:17:58,350
- What is that? - She's 29 in international age.

515
00:17:58,351 --> 00:18:00,250
- Oh, your age is so flexible. - Your age...

516
00:18:00,251 --> 00:18:02,850
- I want to be as young as possible. - I like that, Mimi.

517
00:18:02,851 --> 00:18:04,660
- I like that vibe. - Right?

518
00:18:04,661 --> 00:18:06,190
- From 29 to 31. - I like that.

519
00:18:06,191 --> 00:18:07,591
Late 20s to early 30s.

520
00:18:07,931 --> 00:18:10,031
- Late 20s to early 30s. - Late 20s to early 30s.

521
00:18:10,701 --> 00:18:12,160
It's like late Koryo, early Joseon.

522
00:18:12,161 --> 00:18:13,161
- What does that mean? - End of the Koryo Dynasty...

523
00:18:13,162 --> 00:18:14,201
and the beginning of the Joseon Dynasty.

524
00:18:14,231 --> 00:18:16,901
- Oh, you're so classy. - Seriously.

525
00:18:17,371 --> 00:18:18,901
Oh, not at all.

526
00:18:19,271 --> 00:18:21,470
Didn't you study abroad?

527
00:18:21,471 --> 00:18:22,770
- Abroad? - You studied abroad, right?

528
00:18:22,771 --> 00:18:25,110
- Briefly. - You studied abroad, Ki Young?

529
00:18:25,111 --> 00:18:27,250
I briefly played hockey.

530
00:18:27,251 --> 00:18:29,180
- Oh, you used to play hockey. - Oh, you used to play hockey.

531
00:18:29,181 --> 00:18:30,980
That's so cool.

532
00:18:30,981 --> 00:18:32,850
Right, Ki Young used to play ice hockey.

533
00:18:32,851 --> 00:18:33,921
That's so cool.

534
00:18:34,891 --> 00:18:37,221
(Throughout high school, he was an ice hockey player.)

535
00:18:37,921 --> 00:18:40,431
(Here is Kang Ki Young.)

536
00:18:41,191 --> 00:18:44,160
(Like a high school movie star)

537
00:18:44,161 --> 00:18:46,870
There are always hockey players in movies too.

538
00:18:46,871 --> 00:18:48,330
They're always so cool.

539
00:18:48,331 --> 00:18:49,770
- High school movies. - Right.

540
00:18:49,771 --> 00:18:51,070
- Right. - The boyfriend...

541
00:18:51,071 --> 00:18:52,870
- always plays hockey or... - With the cheerleader.

542
00:18:52,871 --> 00:18:54,741
Yes. Hockey or...

543
00:18:55,141 --> 00:18:56,270
American football.

544
00:18:56,271 --> 00:18:57,540
- Oh, American football. - Right. In America...

545
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,480
- American football. - They're always the captain.

546
00:18:59,481 --> 00:19:00,580
Right.

547
00:19:00,581 --> 00:19:03,520
The biggest sports festival in the US is the Super Bowl, right?

548
00:19:03,521 --> 00:19:04,521
- Right. - Right.

549
00:19:04,522 --> 00:19:07,521
It's happening this Sunday. The Super Bowl finals.

550
00:19:07,621 --> 00:19:08,690
- The finals? - Oh, my.

551
00:19:08,691 --> 00:19:11,060
Taylor Swift's boyfriend...

552
00:19:11,061 --> 00:19:14,431
won last year and he's made it to the finals again.

553
00:19:14,991 --> 00:19:16,630
What don't you know?

554
00:19:16,631 --> 00:19:18,361
I like the Super Bowl.

555
00:19:19,261 --> 00:19:22,001
(America's favorite event, the Super Bowl game)

556
00:19:22,371 --> 00:19:24,741
(Taylor Swift's boyfriend's team won again.)

557
00:19:24,841 --> 00:19:26,670
After her performance...

558
00:19:26,671 --> 00:19:28,741
in Japan,

559
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,981
Taylor Swift took a private jet...

560
00:19:31,141 --> 00:19:32,341
- Oh, right. - Yes.

561
00:19:32,681 --> 00:19:34,411
- Oh, a private jet. - A private jet.

562
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,881
For us,

563
00:19:37,351 --> 00:19:39,021
that's like going in a Carnival.

564
00:19:39,551 --> 00:19:41,291
Not a private jet?

565
00:19:42,491 --> 00:19:43,920
- Do you understand? - Yes.

566
00:19:43,921 --> 00:19:44,960
Understand?

567
00:19:44,961 --> 00:19:45,991
(That was a clear explanation, right?)

568
00:19:46,091 --> 00:19:48,430
After the Cheongyang Pepper Festival...

569
00:19:48,431 --> 00:19:51,160
- You take the Carnival. - Exactly.

570
00:19:51,161 --> 00:19:52,800
- I totally understand. - You get it, right?

571
00:19:52,801 --> 00:19:53,931
I totally did.

572
00:19:54,731 --> 00:19:58,301
Since we're talking about the Super Bowl...

573
00:19:58,701 --> 00:19:59,870
(You thought it was over, right?)

574
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:02,541
- He doesn't stop here. - Oh, it's not over yet?

575
00:20:03,211 --> 00:20:05,340
It's not the Super "Ball."

576
00:20:05,341 --> 00:20:07,911
It's Bowl. B, O, W, L.

577
00:20:08,111 --> 00:20:09,111
(What?)

578
00:20:09,112 --> 00:20:10,750
- You didn't know, right? - I didn't know.

579
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:11,921
- Did you think it was Super "Ball?" - Yes.

580
00:20:12,221 --> 00:20:13,380
- Bowl. - Really?

581
00:20:13,381 --> 00:20:15,291
- Oh, really? - B, O, W, L.

582
00:20:15,991 --> 00:20:17,721
I'm suddenly curious.

583
00:20:18,161 --> 00:20:20,190
Do you not talk for a week before coming here?

584
00:20:20,191 --> 00:20:21,661
(Her honesty is refreshing.)

585
00:20:21,861 --> 00:20:25,201
Every time, he sits in this seat and doesn't stop talking.

586
00:20:25,501 --> 00:20:26,860
I talk a lot, don't I?

587
00:20:26,861 --> 00:20:28,401
I'm just sharing information.

588
00:20:29,371 --> 00:20:32,370
I was looking in the rearview mirror as I listened.

589
00:20:32,371 --> 00:20:34,811
- I could see how happy you were. - He really is.

590
00:20:35,071 --> 00:20:38,881
(He didn't stop chatting even for a minute.)

591
00:20:39,081 --> 00:20:41,381
Since we'll fail...

592
00:20:41,581 --> 00:20:42,910
at the mission anyway...

593
00:20:42,911 --> 00:20:44,350
Right.

594
00:20:44,351 --> 00:20:46,081
- Why don't we... - But we...

595
00:20:46,221 --> 00:20:48,721
Why don't we just change it to a talk show in the van?

596
00:20:48,991 --> 00:20:50,021
That sounds nice.

597
00:20:50,721 --> 00:20:52,161
- We're here. - Is this the place?

598
00:20:52,721 --> 00:20:53,860
Let's go.

599
00:20:53,861 --> 00:20:55,390
(While laughing, they arrived at the first trendy place.)

600
00:20:55,391 --> 00:20:56,391
Let's go.

601
00:20:56,392 --> 00:20:57,501
(While laughing, they arrived at the first trendy place.)

602
00:20:58,101 --> 00:20:59,101
(Oh, my.)

603
00:20:59,561 --> 00:21:01,600
- Oh, it's not that cold. - You're right.

604
00:21:01,601 --> 00:21:03,670
- Hey. - It's not cold.

605
00:21:03,671 --> 00:21:05,000
Nice!

606
00:21:05,001 --> 00:21:06,901
- That place was really cold. - It was.

607
00:21:07,511 --> 00:21:08,940
It's a total food street.

608
00:21:08,941 --> 00:21:10,781
Yes, this is a total food street.

609
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,711
Is this a dakgalbi street? What is this place?

610
00:21:14,411 --> 00:21:16,311
There are food stalls and lots of other stores too.

611
00:21:18,181 --> 00:21:20,691
(Where is this place welcoming our Sixth Sense members?)

612
00:21:20,891 --> 00:21:21,891
(Big-eyed herring)

613
00:21:21,892 --> 00:21:23,020
(Full of big-eyed herring specialty restaurants)

614
00:21:23,021 --> 00:21:24,721
Oh, something smells good.

615
00:21:24,821 --> 00:21:26,361
It smells good here.

616
00:21:27,231 --> 00:21:29,890
There are many quietly pretty stores here.

617
00:21:29,891 --> 00:21:30,901
You're right.

618
00:21:31,431 --> 00:21:33,330
(Big-eyed herring, A famous fish caught in Incheon and Ganghwado)

619
00:21:33,331 --> 00:21:35,231
(When caught, it dies right away from stress.)

620
00:21:35,631 --> 00:21:40,671
(When eating it raw, you must eat it fresh within 30 minutes.)

621
00:21:41,211 --> 00:21:44,810
(Because of these qualities, a big-eyed herring street formed...)

622
00:21:44,811 --> 00:21:46,180
(in Guwol-dong next to Yeonan Dock.)

623
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:48,381
I like that there are no tall buildings here.

624
00:21:48,651 --> 00:21:51,581
Oh, where are we, Incheon expert?

625
00:21:52,021 --> 00:21:54,091
I don't know this place very well either.

626
00:21:54,191 --> 00:21:57,020
(I don't know either.)

627
00:21:57,021 --> 00:21:58,521
- What... - I just go to my house.

628
00:21:58,621 --> 00:22:00,490
You said you lived in Incheon your whole life.

629
00:22:00,491 --> 00:22:02,560
- Seriously. - This isn't my hometown.

630
00:22:02,561 --> 00:22:03,591
Oh, gosh.

631
00:22:04,261 --> 00:22:06,531
(This other Incheon person is keeping quiet.)

632
00:22:06,961 --> 00:22:09,731
- What is so fast here? - What is so fast?

633
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,741
You normally get a sense when you're this close.

634
00:22:12,841 --> 00:22:15,640
I do think it'll be a restaurant.

635
00:22:15,641 --> 00:22:16,711
(The Super Fast place on Big-Eyed Herring Street?)

636
00:22:17,481 --> 00:22:18,541
Sashimi?

637
00:22:18,981 --> 00:22:20,651
- Hey, is this sashimi? - What?

638
00:22:21,551 --> 00:22:23,350
I think we're going to a sashimi place.

639
00:22:23,351 --> 00:22:25,081
- What? - Sashimi...

640
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:28,390
- Is this it? I think so. - Is this it?

641
00:22:28,391 --> 00:22:30,461
(It seems like a normal sashimi place...)

642
00:22:30,661 --> 00:22:33,260
The keyword was "Super Fast."

643
00:22:33,261 --> 00:22:34,431
Yes, "Super Fast."

644
00:22:35,061 --> 00:22:37,660
Is it a different meaning? Maybe it's not "Fast."

645
00:22:37,661 --> 00:22:40,161
(What secret does this place hold?)

646
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:42,000
But isn't sashimi usually served quickly?

647
00:22:42,001 --> 00:22:44,740
- Sashimi is served quickly. - Sashimi is served quickly.

648
00:22:44,741 --> 00:22:46,101
(It's simply called "Super Fast" because they serve sashimi quickly?)

649
00:22:46,501 --> 00:22:47,671
Can they slice the fish very quickly?

650
00:22:47,911 --> 00:22:49,741
- Do they slice like this? - Exactly.

651
00:22:50,611 --> 00:22:52,610
- But this... - What is fast?

652
00:22:52,611 --> 00:22:53,811
What is fast?

653
00:22:54,181 --> 00:22:55,281
Okay. Come in.

654
00:22:55,381 --> 00:22:59,221
- Hello. - Hello.

655
00:22:59,421 --> 00:23:00,921
- It's a normal sashimi place. - What?

656
00:23:02,321 --> 00:23:04,321
- What is so fast here? - I wonder.

657
00:23:05,561 --> 00:23:06,621
Wait.

658
00:23:06,891 --> 00:23:07,931
Oh, my.

659
00:23:08,361 --> 00:23:09,791
(What is that?)

660
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:11,450
Wait.

661
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:12,720
Oh, my.

662
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:15,120
(What is that?)

663
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:18,030
"Hangzhou Asian Games silver medalist..."

664
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:19,730
"Lee Seul?"

665
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:22,730
(There is a suspicious picture on the wall.)

666
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,270
"Hangzhou Asian Games..."

667
00:23:24,723 --> 00:23:28,753
(The picture of an Asian Games silver medalist in a sashimi place?)

668
00:23:29,353 --> 00:23:31,522
- Oh, my! - Her silver medal is here too.

669
00:23:31,523 --> 00:23:32,723
Her uniform is there too.

670
00:23:34,463 --> 00:23:36,933
(Next to the picture...)

671
00:23:38,133 --> 00:23:39,302
And the silver medal there.

672
00:23:39,303 --> 00:23:40,673
(A uniform and the actual silver medal from the Asian Games?)

673
00:23:41,073 --> 00:23:43,272
There are several medals over there.

674
00:23:43,273 --> 00:23:44,543
(Full of impressive medals?)

675
00:23:45,103 --> 00:23:48,213
I have no clue what kind of place this is.

676
00:23:48,673 --> 00:23:50,372
- I have no clue. - What should we...

677
00:23:50,373 --> 00:23:51,482
("Super Fast" is even more of a mystery now.)

678
00:23:51,483 --> 00:23:52,513
Seriously.

679
00:23:52,983 --> 00:23:54,313
- Oh, my! - What?

680
00:23:54,853 --> 00:23:56,053
- Oh, my! - What is it?

681
00:23:56,953 --> 00:23:57,983
Oh, my.

682
00:23:58,323 --> 00:23:59,823
- Oh, my! - What is it?

683
00:24:00,153 --> 00:24:04,023
(What did we just see?)

684
00:24:04,663 --> 00:24:08,493
(Something keeps quickly moving around the store.)

685
00:24:08,863 --> 00:24:10,033
This is a bit strange.

686
00:24:11,103 --> 00:24:14,172
(Is that "Super Fast?")

687
00:24:14,173 --> 00:24:15,233
What was it?

688
00:24:17,803 --> 00:24:18,803
Oh, what?

689
00:24:19,643 --> 00:24:20,972
(Sliding over)

690
00:24:20,973 --> 00:24:23,373
- Hello. - Welcome.

691
00:24:23,813 --> 00:24:25,783
- Hello. - Hello.

692
00:24:26,143 --> 00:24:27,812
- Welcome. - You're really riding skates.

693
00:24:27,813 --> 00:24:29,053
(She's really on rollerblades?)

694
00:24:30,353 --> 00:24:31,522
(Leisurely greeting the guests with the menus in hand)

695
00:24:31,523 --> 00:24:33,383
(Covering her mouth in shock)

696
00:24:33,483 --> 00:24:35,923
- She's really riding rollerblades. - That's right.

697
00:24:36,493 --> 00:24:38,862
- Are you the person in the picture? - Yes, that's right.

698
00:24:38,863 --> 00:24:41,463
Yes, that's right. I'm the person in that picture.

699
00:24:41,793 --> 00:24:43,692
- It's nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

700
00:24:43,693 --> 00:24:45,762
- Oh, hello. - Hello.

701
00:24:45,763 --> 00:24:46,803
(A silver medalist is serving us on rollerblades?)

702
00:24:47,673 --> 00:24:49,703
(We finally know the identity of "Super Fast.")

703
00:24:50,373 --> 00:24:53,043
I'm Lee Seul, a former member of the national rollerskating team.

704
00:24:54,573 --> 00:24:57,112
I first got on the national team in my third year of middle school,

705
00:24:57,113 --> 00:24:59,913
and I was on the national team consistently after that.

706
00:25:00,483 --> 00:25:03,052
I won the silver medal at the Hangzhou Asian Games...

707
00:25:03,053 --> 00:25:04,952
that happened two years ago.

708
00:25:04,953 --> 00:25:08,923
(A silver medalist from the Hangzhou Asian Games)

709
00:25:10,193 --> 00:25:11,693
I set a world record...

710
00:25:12,123 --> 00:25:13,123
at the World Championships.

711
00:25:13,124 --> 00:25:14,463
(She set a world record.)

712
00:25:14,663 --> 00:25:17,362
I haven't counted,

713
00:25:17,363 --> 00:25:19,033
but I probably have over 100.

714
00:25:20,263 --> 00:25:22,132
(She truly is...)

715
00:25:22,133 --> 00:25:27,273
(Super Fast.)

716
00:25:28,473 --> 00:25:32,213
(This Super Fast lady serves food on rollerblades?)

717
00:25:32,413 --> 00:25:34,653
I wanted to promote...

718
00:25:34,983 --> 00:25:37,452
my parents' restaurant more.

719
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:38,622
So I was thinking...

720
00:25:38,623 --> 00:25:41,122
of unique ideas that could set us apart.

721
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:43,453
"How about I try serving on rollerblades?"

722
00:25:43,753 --> 00:25:45,962
"That could be entertaining for the guests."

723
00:25:45,963 --> 00:25:48,492
That's how I came up with the idea...

724
00:25:48,493 --> 00:25:50,562
of serving food on rollerblades.

725
00:25:50,563 --> 00:25:52,403
(That's how her unique rollerblade serving was born.)

726
00:25:53,103 --> 00:25:59,643
(It's already famous on social media for its uniqueness.)

727
00:25:59,973 --> 00:26:01,143
I recently saw that it had 1,580,000 views.

728
00:26:01,913 --> 00:26:04,482
At first, the customers said, "Isn't it dangerous..."

729
00:26:04,483 --> 00:26:07,583
"to serve on rollerblades? I'm a bit worried." But afterward,

730
00:26:07,883 --> 00:26:09,453
they said, "Oh, you were on the national team. I'm fine."

731
00:26:10,853 --> 00:26:14,192
Most people were fascinated.

732
00:26:14,193 --> 00:26:15,923
(Customers are fascinated and entertained.)

733
00:26:16,123 --> 00:26:18,662
Some people want to see me do this consistently.

734
00:26:18,663 --> 00:26:20,762
I saw that some people were curious...

735
00:26:20,763 --> 00:26:23,093
and wanted to see me do this in person.

736
00:26:23,433 --> 00:26:25,262
It's been really helpful...

737
00:26:25,263 --> 00:26:26,933
for promoting the store.

738
00:26:28,133 --> 00:26:30,703
(Sixth Sense members. Am I real?)

739
00:26:32,143 --> 00:26:33,642
(A former member of the national team)

740
00:26:33,643 --> 00:26:36,612
A trendy place with a server riding rollerblades...

741
00:26:36,613 --> 00:26:38,213
Oh, really?

742
00:26:38,613 --> 00:26:40,412
- It's nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

743
00:26:40,413 --> 00:26:42,282
- Hello. - That's why it said, "Fast?"

744
00:26:42,283 --> 00:26:44,422
- Today, we... - It's really fast.

745
00:26:44,423 --> 00:26:46,923
That's why... We're...

746
00:26:47,183 --> 00:26:48,193
Oh, this is so cool!

747
00:26:48,953 --> 00:26:50,323
You're even cooler.

748
00:26:51,023 --> 00:26:52,093
Do you...

749
00:26:52,493 --> 00:26:54,562
- run this restaurant? - Right.

750
00:26:54,563 --> 00:26:57,393
I'm the oldest daughter of the owners.

751
00:26:57,603 --> 00:27:00,162
- Oh, the owners' oldest daughter. - Yes.

752
00:27:00,163 --> 00:27:02,802
To help promote my parents' restaurant,

753
00:27:02,803 --> 00:27:05,372
I uploaded some videos of me serving customers on rollerblades...

754
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:07,543
on my personal social media account.

755
00:27:07,873 --> 00:27:10,212
That video almost got...

756
00:27:10,213 --> 00:27:11,543
1,600,000 views.

757
00:27:11,913 --> 00:27:14,213
People became quite interested.

758
00:27:14,513 --> 00:27:16,313
(Her first video, What happens when you serve on rollerblades?)

759
00:27:17,283 --> 00:27:20,723
(Her video went viral for being unique.)

760
00:27:20,923 --> 00:27:23,722
- Really? - But what if you fall?

761
00:27:23,723 --> 00:27:26,023
Serving on rollerblades is okay. It's safe.

762
00:27:26,463 --> 00:27:27,992
They're as safe as sneakers,

763
00:27:27,993 --> 00:27:29,532
- so you don't have to worry. - Well, you are a medalist.

764
00:27:29,533 --> 00:27:32,202
- You must've worn them more... - Exactly.

765
00:27:32,203 --> 00:27:33,862
- than sneakers. - Yes, that's right.

766
00:27:33,863 --> 00:27:35,872
You're still an athlete, right?

767
00:27:35,873 --> 00:27:38,902
No, I stopped last year.

768
00:27:38,903 --> 00:27:40,172
- I see. - Yes, I retired.

769
00:27:40,173 --> 00:27:42,173
And this year, I'm helping my parents.

770
00:27:43,143 --> 00:27:45,142
I feel like she'll be on the fake video and say,

771
00:27:45,143 --> 00:27:48,013
- "I actually didn't retire." - Exactly.

772
00:27:48,313 --> 00:27:49,682
It's true that she won a silver medal...

773
00:27:49,683 --> 00:27:51,082
- in the Asian Games. - Right.

774
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:52,982
But maybe she doesn't work here.

775
00:27:52,983 --> 00:27:54,353
It may not be her real family.

776
00:27:54,823 --> 00:27:57,192
- That's true. - She may not be their daughter.

777
00:27:57,193 --> 00:27:58,322
- She might not be. - Then...

778
00:27:58,323 --> 00:28:00,392
Then where is the owner now?

779
00:28:00,393 --> 00:28:02,362
- She's in the kitchen, - In the kitchen? I see.

780
00:28:02,363 --> 00:28:04,332
- preparing the ingredients. - I see.

781
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:05,402
She's in the kitchen.

782
00:28:05,403 --> 00:28:08,133
(Her mother is preparing ingredients in the kitchen.)

783
00:28:09,033 --> 00:28:11,602
But they don't seem like a family... I mean, we will...

784
00:28:11,603 --> 00:28:13,502
- For now, we will... - They don't seem like a family?

785
00:28:13,503 --> 00:28:15,773
- Shall we order food? - Yes, we should order some food.

786
00:28:16,213 --> 00:28:17,743
Hold on a second. We should...

787
00:28:17,983 --> 00:28:19,182
The famous dish of this place is...

788
00:28:19,183 --> 00:28:20,582
- big-eyed herring triad? - Big-eyed herring triad?

789
00:28:20,583 --> 00:28:22,452
- Shall we try that? - What's in it?

790
00:28:22,453 --> 00:28:24,283
What are the three ingredients for the big-eyed herring triad?

791
00:28:24,523 --> 00:28:25,782
As written in the menu,

792
00:28:25,783 --> 00:28:28,392
we serve big-eyed herring sashimi, seasoned big-eyed herring sashimi,

793
00:28:28,393 --> 00:28:29,722
and bossam with oriental herbs.

794
00:28:29,723 --> 00:28:32,362
- You can try all three of them. - Really?

795
00:28:32,363 --> 00:28:33,392
Then please give us this dish.

796
00:28:33,393 --> 00:28:35,032
- Would you like to try this? - Big-eyed herring triad, please.

797
00:28:35,033 --> 00:28:37,063
- Yes, big-eyed herring triad. - Coming right up.

798
00:28:38,003 --> 00:28:43,132
(She leaves leisurely on the inline skates.)

799
00:28:43,133 --> 00:28:45,372
- I was going to order yeonpotang. - I don't think this place is real.

800
00:28:45,373 --> 00:28:47,442
- Don't you think it's too easy? - Exactly. It's too...

801
00:28:47,443 --> 00:28:49,372
- What do you think? - It's a little bit out of place.

802
00:28:49,373 --> 00:28:50,673
- That's how I feel. - I don't think it's real.

803
00:28:50,913 --> 00:28:53,283
- Serving on inline skates alone... - Also...

804
00:28:53,883 --> 00:28:55,713
- I've never heard of such a thing. - I think...

805
00:28:56,313 --> 00:29:00,283
- I have another reasonable doubt. - She's really fast.

806
00:29:00,753 --> 00:29:03,392
The space between tables here is very narrow.

807
00:29:03,393 --> 00:29:04,393
- It's really narrow. - That's right.

808
00:29:04,394 --> 00:29:05,822
But they left this big space empty...

809
00:29:05,823 --> 00:29:08,133
to make it easier for us to shoot, which is suspicious.

810
00:29:08,733 --> 00:29:11,002
Tile floors like this are not suitable...

811
00:29:11,003 --> 00:29:13,563
- for serving on inline skates. - Exactly.

812
00:29:14,133 --> 00:29:15,502
She serves soup too.

813
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:16,972
- Wouldn't bowls be shaking? - I think...

814
00:29:16,973 --> 00:29:18,343
(And the tile floor doesn't seem suitable for inline skating?)

815
00:29:18,703 --> 00:29:21,373
Also, it must be hard to do so because there are stairs over there.

816
00:29:21,573 --> 00:29:23,742
(The stairs to the 2nd floor)

817
00:29:23,743 --> 00:29:25,483
(Bookings for large groups available on the 2nd floor)

818
00:29:25,643 --> 00:29:30,453
(The 2-story place seems unfit for serving on inline skates.)

819
00:29:31,123 --> 00:29:33,652
- I don't think this is real. - The fact that she runs this too.

820
00:29:33,653 --> 00:29:34,753
- It's a little suspicious. - But the dining space is...

821
00:29:35,153 --> 00:29:37,692
But I don't think it's a problem for a former professional skater.

822
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:39,193
I know this because I've skated before too.

823
00:29:39,493 --> 00:29:41,393
- Oh, I see. - Professional skaters skate easily.

824
00:29:42,063 --> 00:29:43,893
(Because I've skated before too!)

825
00:29:44,263 --> 00:29:46,103
(Realizing)

826
00:29:46,333 --> 00:29:47,973
Professional skaters skate easily.

827
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:49,973
It wouldn't be a problem for her.

828
00:29:50,473 --> 00:29:51,902
So you're trying to say,

829
00:29:51,903 --> 00:29:53,702
- "What do you guys know?" - It's a little...

830
00:29:53,703 --> 00:29:55,013
- "I'm on another level." - Professional skaters...

831
00:29:56,373 --> 00:29:57,373
- Beginner skaters... - So you're saying...

832
00:29:57,374 --> 00:29:59,442
who just started learning to skate...

833
00:29:59,443 --> 00:30:00,542
are called "waddlers."

834
00:30:00,543 --> 00:30:01,682
- "Waddlers?" - Because they waddle on skates.

835
00:30:01,683 --> 00:30:03,483
- Oh, really? - "Waddlers?"

836
00:30:03,683 --> 00:30:04,722
So serving on inline skates must not be a problem.

837
00:30:04,723 --> 00:30:06,452
- Oh, really? - Something feels unfamiliar.

838
00:30:06,453 --> 00:30:08,452
I'll give you some small bowls for each of you.

839
00:30:08,453 --> 00:30:09,453
(The professional skater is working hard as a waitress.)

840
00:30:09,653 --> 00:30:11,162
- Oh, my. That was natural. - Yes.

841
00:30:11,163 --> 00:30:13,423
- Stopping on inline skates is hard. - Exactly.

842
00:30:13,623 --> 00:30:15,563
(The experienced skater watched her all along.)

843
00:30:16,063 --> 00:30:18,563
(Watching closely)

844
00:30:19,433 --> 00:30:23,133
(She skillfully stops like a professional skater.)

845
00:30:23,833 --> 00:30:25,672
(Just as the experienced Ki Young analyzed...)

846
00:30:25,673 --> 00:30:27,502
(Could this place be real?)

847
00:30:27,503 --> 00:30:28,713
- I think this place is fake. - If that's the case, it's so easy.

848
00:30:29,643 --> 00:30:31,442
- Hello. - Hello, ma'am.

849
00:30:31,443 --> 00:30:33,582
- Yes, hello. - Hello.

850
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:34,982
- Are you Seul's mother? - Yes, she is.

851
00:30:34,983 --> 00:30:35,983
- Yes, I am. - She's my mother.

852
00:30:35,984 --> 00:30:37,313
- It's nice to meet you. - Really?

853
00:30:38,483 --> 00:30:39,483
Do they look alike?

854
00:30:40,053 --> 00:30:42,493
- Their eyes do look similar. - But they don't...

855
00:30:43,123 --> 00:30:44,562
They don't look like a family.

856
00:30:44,563 --> 00:30:46,192
(They don't look so alike. Could they be mother and daughter?)

857
00:30:46,193 --> 00:30:48,263
- Is she really your daughter? - Yes.

858
00:30:48,593 --> 00:30:50,362
- Really? - Yes, she's my daughter.

859
00:30:50,363 --> 00:30:51,662
- Oh, really? - All right.

860
00:30:51,663 --> 00:30:53,032
When is your mother's birthday?

861
00:30:53,033 --> 00:30:55,533
Please answer at the same time, One, two, three.

862
00:30:55,903 --> 00:30:56,973
April 8.

863
00:30:57,533 --> 00:30:59,103
- May 8. - I mean, May 8.

864
00:31:01,113 --> 00:31:02,113
(April 8!)
(May 8)

865
00:31:03,113 --> 00:31:04,113
(She corrects her answer hurriedly. "I mean, May 8!")

866
00:31:05,943 --> 00:31:07,113
Oh, hold on.

867
00:31:07,683 --> 00:31:08,683
This is...

868
00:31:08,953 --> 00:31:10,712
- Her birth was registered early... - Oh, is it your...

869
00:31:10,713 --> 00:31:12,722
- Is it your lunar birthday? - Yes.

870
00:31:12,723 --> 00:31:14,282
- Right? - One is my registered birthday,

871
00:31:14,283 --> 00:31:16,193
and the other is my birthday on the solar calendar.

872
00:31:16,753 --> 00:31:18,522
Doesn't your resident registration number start with...

873
00:31:18,523 --> 00:31:19,523
- Correct. - Right. It's April 8.

874
00:31:19,524 --> 00:31:21,262
She revealed her mother's resident registration number.

875
00:31:21,263 --> 00:31:22,263
My point, exactly.

876
00:31:22,993 --> 00:31:24,402
I'm sorry.

877
00:31:24,403 --> 00:31:27,302
My registered birthday is different from my real birthday.

878
00:31:27,303 --> 00:31:28,633
- Oh, I see. - Yes.

879
00:31:29,203 --> 00:31:31,602
(They answered different dates. Are they real?)

880
00:31:31,603 --> 00:31:33,802
- Can you tell us how we eat this? - We'll start eating this.

881
00:31:33,803 --> 00:31:35,043
How do we eat this, ma'am?

882
00:31:35,443 --> 00:31:36,813
This big-eyed herring triad...

883
00:31:37,543 --> 00:31:41,013
This is... What was the word? I made this.

884
00:31:41,513 --> 00:31:42,613
- Of course, you did. - Yes.

885
00:31:44,623 --> 00:31:45,982
This is the only place in Korea that serves...

886
00:31:45,983 --> 00:31:48,352
- Oh, you invented the dish? - big-eyed herring triad.

887
00:31:48,353 --> 00:31:49,792
- No other places serve this. - Oh, I get it now.

888
00:31:49,793 --> 00:31:51,323
I invented big-eyed herring triad...

889
00:31:52,193 --> 00:31:54,492
while running this place for 30 years.

890
00:31:54,493 --> 00:31:55,792
This is big-eyed herring sashimi,

891
00:31:55,793 --> 00:31:57,062
and this is seasoned big-eyed herring sashimi.

892
00:31:57,063 --> 00:31:58,402
You can wrap all three of them...

893
00:31:58,403 --> 00:31:59,532
- with lettuce. - In one bite?

894
00:31:59,533 --> 00:32:01,632
- Or you can enjoy them separately. - We can eat them separately.

895
00:32:01,633 --> 00:32:02,803
Yes, you can do that too.

896
00:32:03,173 --> 00:32:06,673
(The trendiest place on Big-eyed Herring Street in Guwol-dong)

897
00:32:07,273 --> 00:32:09,313
(The place even has a 30-year history.)

898
00:32:09,813 --> 00:32:12,383
(They own a whole building now, thanks to big-eyed herring.)

899
00:32:12,843 --> 00:32:17,513
(The place's signature dish, big-eyed herring triad!)

900
00:32:17,613 --> 00:32:21,023
Big-eyed herring is delivered from Yeonan in Mokpo every morning.

901
00:32:21,323 --> 00:32:24,253
We receive over seven boxes a day when the business goes well.

902
00:32:25,093 --> 00:32:28,463
The number of fish in 7 boxes is over 7,000.

903
00:32:28,993 --> 00:32:32,503
And that proves that we sell a lot of dishes.

904
00:32:33,263 --> 00:32:36,733
Big-eyed herring is very small, so it's hard to prepare.

905
00:32:37,373 --> 00:32:40,842
You have to remove the head, the caudal fin, and the forefins.

906
00:32:40,843 --> 00:32:43,243
You also have to remove the intestines.

907
00:32:43,543 --> 00:32:46,083
Also, many people find it hard to fillet big-eyed herring.

908
00:32:46,443 --> 00:32:49,313
My mother cleans and fillets all the fish we use.

909
00:32:50,113 --> 00:32:52,523
The big-eyed herring sashimi that's made this way...

910
00:32:52,823 --> 00:32:55,623
has a clean, savory taste and a tender texture.

911
00:32:55,853 --> 00:32:57,423
Only those who have tried it knows that.

912
00:32:57,823 --> 00:33:00,362
Therefore, we have a lot of regular customers.

913
00:33:00,363 --> 00:33:01,933
And we sell a lot of dishes per day.

914
00:33:02,893 --> 00:33:04,802
After the process of making big-eyed herring sashimi,

915
00:33:04,803 --> 00:33:06,203
we start making bossam.

916
00:33:06,663 --> 00:33:08,972
We put in 13 different oriental herbs...

917
00:33:08,973 --> 00:33:10,733
and make broth with them.

918
00:33:11,443 --> 00:33:14,743
Then we put in pork in that broth and boil it.

919
00:33:15,343 --> 00:33:17,943
This process enriches the aroma of oriental herbs...

920
00:33:18,283 --> 00:33:19,943
and the flavor of pork.

921
00:33:21,713 --> 00:33:24,153
Bossam with oriental herbs, big-eyed herring sashimi,

922
00:33:24,583 --> 00:33:27,893
and big-eyed herring sashimi seasoned with chogochujang.

923
00:33:28,493 --> 00:33:29,693
They make big-eyed herring triad.

924
00:33:31,763 --> 00:33:34,293
Our customers find it fascinating and like its taste.

925
00:33:34,663 --> 00:33:36,792
Even those who don't eat big-eyed herring sashimi alone...

926
00:33:36,793 --> 00:33:38,563
enjoy the big-eyed herring triad.

927
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:42,073
It's our special dish invented by my mother that no others serve.

928
00:33:42,803 --> 00:33:45,243
We sell over 70 dishes per day.

929
00:33:46,273 --> 00:33:48,342
Our monthly sales are over 100,000 dollars.

930
00:33:48,343 --> 00:33:49,843
(The monthly sales are over 100,000 dollars.)

931
00:33:50,313 --> 00:33:54,143
It became more popular thanks to our serving style.

932
00:33:55,853 --> 00:33:58,622
My mother has been making this dish for 30 years.

933
00:33:58,623 --> 00:34:00,482
So I certainly guarantee the taste.

934
00:34:00,483 --> 00:34:02,323
(How does big-eyed herring triad taste?)

935
00:34:03,853 --> 00:34:05,392
I've never tried big-eyed herring before.

936
00:34:05,393 --> 00:34:06,622
- Really? - Really.

937
00:34:06,623 --> 00:34:07,623
Big-eyed herring?

938
00:34:08,493 --> 00:34:09,662
Have you ever heard...

939
00:34:09,663 --> 00:34:10,832
- "the mind of big-eyed herring?" - Of course, I have.

940
00:34:10,833 --> 00:34:12,802
- Yes, I have. - This is the fish in that term.

941
00:34:12,803 --> 00:34:14,973
(This is the big-eyed herring in the term!)

942
00:34:15,373 --> 00:34:17,632
- It has small intestines. - That's correct.

943
00:34:17,633 --> 00:34:20,172
- That's why the term was coined. - It has a personality...

944
00:34:20,173 --> 00:34:22,113
That's why it means to have a small mind.

945
00:34:22,473 --> 00:34:24,272
- Oh, really? - That's right.

946
00:34:24,273 --> 00:34:25,413
Yes, really.

947
00:34:27,183 --> 00:34:29,552
- He sounded just like Mimi. - Do you have soy sauce?

948
00:34:29,553 --> 00:34:30,882
- Do you have soy sauce? - That was good, right?

949
00:34:30,883 --> 00:34:31,922
- Shall I give you some? - Yes, please.

950
00:34:31,923 --> 00:34:32,923
- I'll pour some in your bowl. - Thanks.

951
00:34:32,924 --> 00:34:34,753
- Here's a wet wipe. - Oh, thank you.

952
00:34:35,023 --> 00:34:36,192
(Chuckling)

953
00:34:36,193 --> 00:34:37,923
- Here's soy sauce. - "Really?"

954
00:34:38,263 --> 00:34:40,862
Jae Seok, you're getting better at imitating me.

955
00:34:40,863 --> 00:34:42,133
- Really? - Here's soy sauce.

956
00:34:42,233 --> 00:34:45,403
(Jae Seok has gotten a taste of teasing Mimi.)

957
00:34:45,463 --> 00:34:48,003
Since I like sashimi, I'll try the sashimi first.

958
00:34:49,103 --> 00:34:50,103
I'll try the sashimi.

959
00:34:50,104 --> 00:34:51,643
(She dips big-eyed herring sashimi in chogochujang.)

960
00:34:54,613 --> 00:34:55,842
- How does it taste? - The big-eyed herring is tasty.

961
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:56,843
It's good.

962
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:58,243
Does it make you choke up?

963
00:34:58,513 --> 00:34:59,882
- I can't trust you. - Right.

964
00:34:59,883 --> 00:35:00,883
It's good.

965
00:35:01,453 --> 00:35:03,852
- I should try all of them at once. - I need soup for breakfast.

966
00:35:03,853 --> 00:35:06,152
I'll put in sashimi and white kimchi in my vegetable wrap.

967
00:35:06,153 --> 00:35:07,483
- It's really good. - The triad is good.

968
00:35:10,993 --> 00:35:13,063
(This is it!)

969
00:35:13,193 --> 00:35:14,762
I'll try it as she recommended.

970
00:35:14,763 --> 00:35:16,293
(Everyone tries sashimi, seasoned sashimi, and bossam all at once.)

971
00:35:17,393 --> 00:35:18,462
(Amazed)

972
00:35:18,463 --> 00:35:20,063
- It's so good. - It's good.

973
00:35:21,533 --> 00:35:23,303
(Brava)

974
00:35:23,403 --> 00:35:25,442
I can chew the fish on the left side of my mouth...

975
00:35:25,443 --> 00:35:26,972
and the pork on the right side.

976
00:35:26,973 --> 00:35:28,142
Oh, that's how you enjoy it.

977
00:35:28,143 --> 00:35:29,772
(You can enjoy two dishes at once.)

978
00:35:29,773 --> 00:35:33,712
It's so tasty when you chomp down on a big wrap with them all.

979
00:35:33,713 --> 00:35:36,383
(Putting it all in her mouth)

980
00:35:36,583 --> 00:35:38,383
You know how to enjoy vegetable wraps.

981
00:35:38,823 --> 00:35:40,882
I've never thought of eating pork with sashimi before.

982
00:35:40,883 --> 00:35:42,393
- Right. - But they go well with each other.

983
00:35:42,653 --> 00:35:44,823
- It's so tasty. - They strangely go well together.

984
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,193
- It's not fishy at all. - Right.

985
00:35:47,663 --> 00:35:49,893
- Pork goes well with this fish. - Indeed.

986
00:35:50,133 --> 00:35:51,133
It's good.

987
00:35:51,363 --> 00:35:52,903
It has an eye-opening taste.

988
00:35:56,173 --> 00:35:57,732
(Putting the whole thing in his mouth)

989
00:35:57,733 --> 00:36:00,403
(The big-eyed herring triad opened the sleeping mouth of Kyoung Pyo.)

990
00:36:01,103 --> 00:36:06,113
(He's gulping down food as always.)

991
00:36:06,213 --> 00:36:07,843
I shouldn't eat a lot.

992
00:36:08,013 --> 00:36:09,253
(Laughing)

993
00:36:09,883 --> 00:36:12,023
I'll eat one last piece.

994
00:36:14,553 --> 00:36:18,593
(Kyoung Pyo is happy as always.)

995
00:36:18,663 --> 00:36:19,892
If you eat too much here,

996
00:36:19,893 --> 00:36:21,192
you won't be able to eat at the next location.

997
00:36:21,193 --> 00:36:22,633
- I can eat more. - Oh, you can?

998
00:36:22,663 --> 00:36:23,732
It's a problem that she can.

999
00:36:23,733 --> 00:36:24,733
(It's a problem that she can eat a lot.)

1000
00:36:24,734 --> 00:36:26,202
- Don't you worry. - It's a problem that she can.

1001
00:36:26,203 --> 00:36:28,373
(She eats a big spoonful of seasoned sashimi.)

1002
00:36:28,703 --> 00:36:29,732
(Satisfied)

1003
00:36:29,733 --> 00:36:31,202
- We always say... - Yes?

1004
00:36:31,203 --> 00:36:32,503
that we visit three places,

1005
00:36:32,803 --> 00:36:34,203
but we eat at five places.

1006
00:36:34,713 --> 00:36:35,713
- That's right. - Really?

1007
00:36:35,714 --> 00:36:38,812
- We went to a cafe earlier. - Right.

1008
00:36:38,813 --> 00:36:40,112
- We'll have to go to another one. - Oh, my.

1009
00:36:40,113 --> 00:36:41,342
(They really eat continuously.)

1010
00:36:41,343 --> 00:36:43,382
I heard that even when they shoot "Tasty Guys,"

1011
00:36:43,383 --> 00:36:45,283
they take a break after having two meals.

1012
00:36:45,883 --> 00:36:47,552
They take a three-hour nap.

1013
00:36:47,553 --> 00:36:48,623
(Even they take a break between meals.)

1014
00:36:48,823 --> 00:36:51,022
- The sauce is really good. - It's so good.

1015
00:36:51,023 --> 00:36:52,322
(The Sixth Sense members eat more frequently than they do.)

1016
00:36:52,323 --> 00:36:53,323
It's good.

1017
00:36:54,063 --> 00:36:55,063
It's really good.

1018
00:36:55,363 --> 00:36:56,892
- I think this dish is real. - Right.

1019
00:36:56,893 --> 00:36:57,893
- Right. - Yes.

1020
00:36:58,363 --> 00:37:00,632
But I think... I have a feeling that it's fake.

1021
00:37:00,633 --> 00:37:02,102
(I think this place is fake.)

1022
00:37:02,103 --> 00:37:03,602
- It's tasty, but the place is fake? - After enjoying all the food?

1023
00:37:03,603 --> 00:37:04,603
You know...

1024
00:37:04,604 --> 00:37:06,402
It bothers me that they said different dates for her birthday.

1025
00:37:06,403 --> 00:37:07,902
- Right. - That's exactly my point.

1026
00:37:07,903 --> 00:37:09,872
- That was a sharp question, Eun I. - Indeed.

1027
00:37:09,873 --> 00:37:10,873
- Right? - Yes.

1028
00:37:12,083 --> 00:37:13,083
That's right.

1029
00:37:15,583 --> 00:37:17,413
(Another question comes to the sharp Eun I's mind.)

1030
00:37:17,913 --> 00:37:19,683
What's your MBTI type?

1031
00:37:21,723 --> 00:37:23,122
Take care of your health.

1032
00:37:23,123 --> 00:37:24,552
(She choked on the food while eating a lot at once.)

1033
00:37:24,553 --> 00:37:26,162
- "Take care of your health?" - You should take care of yourself.

1034
00:37:26,163 --> 00:37:27,792
Take good care of your health.

1035
00:37:27,793 --> 00:37:30,363
It's not the time for you to figure out what's real.

1036
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:33,302
- Shall I give you some water? - Yes, please.

1037
00:37:33,303 --> 00:37:35,273
Gluttonous people choke on food easily.

1038
00:37:35,803 --> 00:37:37,132
What's your MBTI type?

1039
00:37:37,133 --> 00:37:38,143
It's...

1040
00:37:38,903 --> 00:37:41,513
- ISFJ. - ISFJ?

1041
00:37:42,043 --> 00:37:44,742
- It's possible that an introvert... - Really? Yes.

1042
00:37:44,743 --> 00:37:45,913
does it well.

1043
00:37:47,383 --> 00:37:48,812
- Do what well? - I think...

1044
00:37:48,813 --> 00:37:50,752
that it could be hard for a shy person.

1045
00:37:50,753 --> 00:37:51,753
That's why I asked her.

1046
00:37:51,754 --> 00:37:54,823
It says that I'm an introvert who's close to an extrovert.

1047
00:37:55,493 --> 00:37:56,852
I mean, you need people skills to work as a waitress.

1048
00:37:56,853 --> 00:37:57,853
Indeed.

1049
00:37:57,854 --> 00:38:00,292
(Her MBTI type doesn't fit the job? She's fake, based on her nature?)

1050
00:38:00,293 --> 00:38:02,033
Could it be that she wasn't a national team player?

1051
00:38:02,593 --> 00:38:04,493
That's possible.

1052
00:38:04,803 --> 00:38:06,602
If she's fake, it could be a lie.

1053
00:38:06,603 --> 00:38:07,803
(Was it a lie that she was a national team player?)

1054
00:38:08,103 --> 00:38:09,803
Suddenly, those photos look fake.

1055
00:38:10,773 --> 00:38:13,003
- Really? Is that possible? - Perhaps, she used a green screen.

1056
00:38:14,143 --> 00:38:16,273
- Is that possible? - Of course, it's possible.

1057
00:38:16,343 --> 00:38:18,213
- Really? But it's... - It's certainly possible.

1058
00:38:18,513 --> 00:38:20,913
It suddenly feels suspicious now that I think that way.

1059
00:38:21,213 --> 00:38:23,883
I don't know why, but that group photo seems fake.

1060
00:38:24,113 --> 00:38:25,153
You mean, that one?

1061
00:38:26,153 --> 00:38:28,153
(No, wait...)

1062
00:38:28,693 --> 00:38:32,363
That Wi-Fi sign seems so suspicious to me. I'm serious.

1063
00:38:32,793 --> 00:38:34,592
- Isn't that suspicious? - The Wi-Fi sign?

1064
00:38:34,593 --> 00:38:37,192
- Right. I can see that. - I've never seen...

1065
00:38:37,193 --> 00:38:39,362
- such a clean sign like that. - Usually,

1066
00:38:39,363 --> 00:38:42,302
- people write their password... - Exactly.

1067
00:38:42,303 --> 00:38:43,873
- with a marker. - Right?

1068
00:38:43,903 --> 00:38:47,002
No one prints it out and laminates it like that.

1069
00:38:47,003 --> 00:38:48,273
(Come to think of it, it's really suspicious.)

1070
00:38:48,473 --> 00:38:49,872
- It's very tidy. - It's unusual.

1071
00:38:49,873 --> 00:38:52,283
- Everything here is very tidy. - They printed it out.

1072
00:38:53,183 --> 00:38:56,712
(The food is decorated in a tidy way as if the food team did it?)

1073
00:38:56,713 --> 00:38:58,012
- This place seems so fake. - It seems so fake...

1074
00:38:58,013 --> 00:38:59,622
- that I can't doubt it. - Every detail seems fake.

1075
00:38:59,623 --> 00:39:00,682
(The doubtful Yoon Kyung digs everything deeply.)

1076
00:39:00,683 --> 00:39:02,752
Forget all your doubts. Let's eat up for now.

1077
00:39:02,753 --> 00:39:04,693
- Okay. For now... - The food is good, so...

1078
00:39:05,423 --> 00:39:07,023
- My, bibimbap will be so delicious. - Put it in.

1079
00:39:07,793 --> 00:39:09,132
She said to add only seasoned sashimi.

1080
00:39:09,133 --> 00:39:10,762
It'll be better to put in a lot, right?

1081
00:39:10,763 --> 00:39:11,833
(Dessert bibimbap with seasoned sashimi)

1082
00:39:12,233 --> 00:39:15,373
(Add a lot of seasoned sashimi to rice and drizzle sesame oil.)

1083
00:39:15,803 --> 00:39:16,972
- This will be tasty. - Right, indeed.

1084
00:39:16,973 --> 00:39:20,403
(Mix everything with various vegetables.)

1085
00:39:21,503 --> 00:39:26,783
(Then the tastiest ending fairy seasoned sashimi bibimbap is done.)

1086
00:39:27,643 --> 00:39:28,653
Should we mix it all just as it is?

1087
00:39:28,853 --> 00:39:31,082
- One of you just has to mix it all. - Won't you add this?

1088
00:39:31,083 --> 00:39:32,083
Right, with a clean spoon.

1089
00:39:32,084 --> 00:39:33,652
She said to mix it with seasoned sashimi.

1090
00:39:33,653 --> 00:39:35,693
- Why don't you add sesame oil? - I already did.

1091
00:39:36,393 --> 00:39:39,122
(Staring)

1092
00:39:39,123 --> 00:39:40,123
I'll do it.

1093
00:39:42,033 --> 00:39:43,763
- I think you haven't done it much. - Use a clean spoon.

1094
00:39:44,293 --> 00:39:46,232
- Mimi, I'll do it. - Sorry.

1095
00:39:46,233 --> 00:39:47,463
It's okay. Welcome.

1096
00:39:48,203 --> 00:39:49,532
You don't seem very thorough.

1097
00:39:49,533 --> 00:39:50,573
("Welcome?")

1098
00:39:50,803 --> 00:39:52,542
(Impressed)

1099
00:39:52,543 --> 00:39:55,213
You have to separate the rice grains while mixing it.

1100
00:39:56,213 --> 00:39:57,412
I've been learning a lot from you.

1101
00:39:57,413 --> 00:39:58,413
(I learned another skill today.)

1102
00:39:58,414 --> 00:39:59,782
You have to move it lightly like this.

1103
00:39:59,783 --> 00:40:01,283
But I saw you squashing the rice.

1104
00:40:02,153 --> 00:40:04,512
I became self-conscious for some reason.

1105
00:40:04,513 --> 00:40:05,922
I thought you did.

1106
00:40:05,923 --> 00:40:07,622
- I thought Yoon Kyung might nag me. - Obviously,

1107
00:40:07,623 --> 00:40:09,493
he and Mimi haven't done it a lot.

1108
00:40:10,293 --> 00:40:15,693
(Comparing him to Jae Seok)

1109
00:40:16,293 --> 00:40:18,362
- I've been learning a lot from you. - You have to move it lightly.

1110
00:40:18,363 --> 00:40:20,003
But I saw you squashing the rice.

1111
00:40:20,563 --> 00:40:22,272
(I thought Yoon Kyung might nag me.)

1112
00:40:22,273 --> 00:40:24,032
- As he heard what you were saying, - Right.

1113
00:40:24,033 --> 00:40:25,442
he shook the spoon like this.

1114
00:40:25,443 --> 00:40:26,973
I was trying to separate all the grains of rice.

1115
00:40:27,143 --> 00:40:29,213
(Shaking)

1116
00:40:29,273 --> 00:40:30,312
He mixed it so well.

1117
00:40:30,313 --> 00:40:32,242
- I did a good job, right? - Yes.

1118
00:40:32,243 --> 00:40:33,912
- It looks delicious. - Right.

1119
00:40:33,913 --> 00:40:35,583
It's done. Try it.

1120
00:40:38,883 --> 00:40:40,223
- Is it good? - It's good.

1121
00:40:40,483 --> 00:40:41,483
It's nice.

1122
00:40:41,484 --> 00:40:42,593
(Bibimbap is the best dessert as we all think.)

1123
00:40:45,423 --> 00:40:46,423
It's good, right?

1124
00:40:47,623 --> 00:40:49,393
- The sauce really is very good. - Yes.

1125
00:40:49,963 --> 00:40:51,762
Carbs are always delicious.

1126
00:40:51,763 --> 00:40:53,133
(Adding carbs to a delicious sauce)

1127
00:40:53,203 --> 00:40:55,002
- Because seasoned sashimi is good. - Exactly.

1128
00:40:55,003 --> 00:40:56,503
It was already delicious before we mixed it with rice.

1129
00:40:57,173 --> 00:40:58,173
- It's really good. - I love it.

1130
00:40:58,174 --> 00:41:02,943
(Even the last dish bibimbap is perfect.)

1131
00:41:03,843 --> 00:41:04,843
It's good.

1132
00:41:04,844 --> 00:41:06,643
(Happy)

1133
00:41:07,043 --> 00:41:08,043
It's really good.

1134
00:41:08,044 --> 00:41:09,613
(She's mesmerized by the taste as always.)

1135
00:41:09,983 --> 00:41:11,383
This place is definitely fake.

1136
00:41:11,483 --> 00:41:14,323
This is the first place, but I have a feeling...

1137
00:41:15,023 --> 00:41:16,792
- The food is really good. - Indeed.

1138
00:41:16,793 --> 00:41:18,693
- We should suspect this place. - But the theme of this place...

1139
00:41:18,763 --> 00:41:20,022
- Right, it feels like it's fake. - I agree.

1140
00:41:20,023 --> 00:41:21,223
(Serving food on inline skates sounds fake.)

1141
00:41:23,493 --> 00:41:25,062
I can see Seul's mother from here.

1142
00:41:25,063 --> 00:41:26,233
And she keeps eating something.

1143
00:41:28,003 --> 00:41:29,673
Oh, she really is eating something.

1144
00:41:29,903 --> 00:41:31,742
She must be eating some fish while filleting them.

1145
00:41:31,743 --> 00:41:33,803
(She seems comfortable as if she were at home.)

1146
00:41:33,943 --> 00:41:35,173
Ma'am, what are you eating?

1147
00:41:35,513 --> 00:41:36,743
- Pardon? - What are you eating?

1148
00:41:37,313 --> 00:41:39,383
- Me? Food. I'm hungry. - Yes.

1149
00:41:39,513 --> 00:41:40,612
Are you hungry?

1150
00:41:40,613 --> 00:41:42,883
(It's an honest, realistic reason.)

1151
00:41:42,913 --> 00:41:44,253
She seems so natural.

1152
00:41:45,053 --> 00:41:46,153
The owner seems natural.

1153
00:41:46,323 --> 00:41:47,623
I think it's true that she runs this restaurant.

1154
00:41:48,023 --> 00:41:50,023
(The 2 of them agree.)

1155
00:41:50,123 --> 00:41:51,622
- She seems natural. - Right?

1156
00:41:51,623 --> 00:41:53,593
(The owner seems so comfortable. Could this place be real?)

1157
00:41:53,693 --> 00:41:56,392
- Is your father here as well? - Yes.

1158
00:41:56,393 --> 00:41:57,892
- Yes. - I had a glimpse of him.

1159
00:41:57,893 --> 00:41:59,663
- He's in the kitchen. - Oh, really?

1160
00:42:00,733 --> 00:42:01,832
- Her father is... - Do we mix it with this?

1161
00:42:01,833 --> 00:42:02,902
wearing a lightweight padded vest,

1162
00:42:02,903 --> 00:42:04,002
- which is so realistic. - Add some seasoned sashimi.

1163
00:42:04,003 --> 00:42:06,073
(Ki Young chuckles, thinking, "A lightweight padded vest?")

1164
00:42:06,303 --> 00:42:10,773
(She's fixated on his free outfit, following the free Wi-Fi sign.)

1165
00:42:11,113 --> 00:42:13,142
- Men around his age wear it. - Exactly.

1166
00:42:13,143 --> 00:42:14,212
(Free-minded Yoon Kyung)

1167
00:42:14,213 --> 00:42:15,913
I think it's true that they run this place.

1168
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:20,382
The food is really good, though.

1169
00:42:20,383 --> 00:42:21,422
(Super Fast, serving on inline skates: 1. It's a 2-story building.)

1170
00:42:21,423 --> 00:42:22,552
(2. The perfect taste of big-eyed herring triad)

1171
00:42:22,553 --> 00:42:24,322
Perhaps, the staff went too far.

1172
00:42:24,323 --> 00:42:26,323
(3. The owners seem authentic and natural.)

1173
00:42:26,623 --> 00:42:28,123
Oh, it's sleeting outside.

1174
00:42:29,233 --> 00:42:30,292
(It's sleeting)

1175
00:42:30,293 --> 00:42:31,593
(Outside)

1176
00:42:32,103 --> 00:42:33,702
(He's feeling so upbeat now that he's full.)

1177
00:42:33,703 --> 00:42:36,103
- Next up is Super Big, right? - It's Super Huge.

1178
00:42:36,233 --> 00:42:38,373
- Super Huge. - Next up is Super Huge.

1179
00:42:40,373 --> 00:42:42,042
(The next trendy place: Super Huge)

1180
00:42:42,043 --> 00:42:43,173
Let's get going.

1181
00:42:43,573 --> 00:42:46,142
I don't see anyone walking on the street.

1182
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:48,582
- Exactly. - The cold wave warning was issued.

1183
00:42:48,583 --> 00:42:50,353
- The street is almost empty. - You're right.

1184
00:42:51,613 --> 00:42:53,552
It's around lunchtime,

1185
00:42:53,553 --> 00:42:55,353
so there's supposed to be many people on the street.

1186
00:42:56,793 --> 00:42:57,793
(Groaning)

1187
00:42:59,623 --> 00:43:00,722
It's so cold.

1188
00:43:00,723 --> 00:43:02,093
(Ki Young pulls his coat as tightly as he can as he's cold.)

1189
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:04,532
- Don't open your mouth. - I smiled just slightly.

1190
00:43:04,533 --> 00:43:05,533
You must keep your mouth closed.

1191
00:43:05,534 --> 00:43:06,702
My gums...

1192
00:43:06,703 --> 00:43:08,502
- are so sore. - We're on a variety show.

1193
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:10,103
- The wind comes into the mouth... - My gums are sore.

1194
00:43:10,933 --> 00:43:12,572
- You must be cold. I'll hold it. - No, I'll hold it.

1195
00:43:12,573 --> 00:43:14,502
- You might... - I'm not cold.

1196
00:43:14,503 --> 00:43:15,512
Mimi, shall I give you gloves?

1197
00:43:15,513 --> 00:43:17,073
- No, I'm fine. - Are you? Okay.

1198
00:43:17,773 --> 00:43:18,913
I can overcome this!

1199
00:43:19,643 --> 00:43:20,712
I can do this!

1200
00:43:20,713 --> 00:43:22,612
- Mimi, are you all right? - Yes?

1201
00:43:22,613 --> 00:43:23,753
I can do this.

1202
00:43:23,953 --> 00:43:25,583
Mimi will probably freeze to death.

1203
00:43:26,623 --> 00:43:29,292
I'm fine. Thank you.

1204
00:43:29,293 --> 00:43:30,693
- "I'm fine. Thank you?" - And you?

1205
00:43:31,193 --> 00:43:32,923
Wait. Let's let the man on the scooter pass us by.

1206
00:43:33,563 --> 00:43:35,562
- Be safe. Oh, no. Be careful. - Get home safely.

1207
00:43:35,563 --> 00:43:37,463
- My, he's so handsome... - Be careful.

1208
00:43:37,793 --> 00:43:39,162
- It's dangerous. - Drive safely.

1209
00:43:39,163 --> 00:43:40,163
(He leaves super fast.)

1210
00:43:41,403 --> 00:43:42,733
Even that man seems fake.

1211
00:43:43,673 --> 00:43:45,002
I can't stop doubting everything I see.

1212
00:43:45,003 --> 00:43:46,542
(Here's another person who's overly immersed in the show.)

1213
00:43:46,543 --> 00:43:48,002
As he was coming toward us,

1214
00:43:48,003 --> 00:43:49,843
he tried to take a photo, saying, "He's so handsome."

1215
00:43:49,913 --> 00:43:50,943
But he didn't finish the sentence.

1216
00:43:52,883 --> 00:43:55,253
"He's so handsome. So I thought, but..."

1217
00:43:55,753 --> 00:43:57,483
"He's actually not, looking at him up close."

1218
00:43:58,313 --> 00:43:59,522
- Where is it? - Oh, dear.

1219
00:43:59,523 --> 00:44:00,883
Something smells delicious.

1220
00:44:01,153 --> 00:44:02,793
I can smell something delicious around here.

1221
00:44:03,193 --> 00:44:04,893
(They're walking, following the smell.)

1222
00:44:05,263 --> 00:44:06,393
Hey, this is so funny.

1223
00:44:07,193 --> 00:44:08,592
- This is a hair salon. - Hello.

1224
00:44:08,593 --> 00:44:10,333
Do you sell this at a hair salon?

1225
00:44:11,733 --> 00:44:13,433
- What? It's a hair salon. - It's so funny.

1226
00:44:13,533 --> 00:44:14,803
- This is a hair salon. - Hello.

1227
00:44:15,233 --> 00:44:16,602
Are you the owner of the hair salon?

1228
00:44:16,603 --> 00:44:19,073
- No, my daughter is. - Oh, I see.

1229
00:44:19,903 --> 00:44:22,372
- Her daughter runs the hair salon, - I see.

1230
00:44:22,373 --> 00:44:24,812
and she runs this fish-shaped bread place.

1231
00:44:24,813 --> 00:44:26,142
- It's a bakery. - This is so funny.

1232
00:44:26,143 --> 00:44:28,682
- Pardon? I see. She corrected me. - Her daughter runs it?

1233
00:44:28,683 --> 00:44:31,782
- She runs this "bakery." - This is a bakery.

1234
00:44:31,783 --> 00:44:33,723
- This is a bakery. - It's a small bakery.

1235
00:44:34,353 --> 00:44:36,353
- They divided the space in half? - I see.

1236
00:44:36,923 --> 00:44:39,222
- Shall we have some? - Shall we?

1237
00:44:39,223 --> 00:44:40,892
- Shall we have fish-shaped bread? - Let's do that.

1238
00:44:40,893 --> 00:44:41,963
Let's have some.

1239
00:44:42,233 --> 00:44:43,963
(She puts in the batter as soon as she gets an order.)

1240
00:44:44,593 --> 00:44:47,003
(She puts in a lot of red bean paste and custard cream.)

1241
00:44:47,463 --> 00:44:49,233
(She closes the lid.)

1242
00:44:50,103 --> 00:44:51,803
(The fish-shaped bread is cooked to golden brown already.)

1243
00:44:52,303 --> 00:44:55,072
(The best street snack, fish-shaped bread)

1244
00:44:55,073 --> 00:44:57,443
- Thank you, ma'am. - Thank you. Enjoy.

1245
00:44:58,173 --> 00:44:59,282
(How does the fish-shaped bread taste in the cold weather?)

1246
00:44:59,283 --> 00:45:00,512
Oh, this... Ma'am.

1247
00:45:00,513 --> 00:45:01,882
The bag is clean, so I think you can use it again.

1248
00:45:01,883 --> 00:45:02,883
It's good.

1249
00:45:03,713 --> 00:45:06,623
(I'll have a bite too.)

1250
00:45:08,723 --> 00:45:10,593
- Here's one with red bean paste. - Thank you.

1251
00:45:11,423 --> 00:45:12,822
(Exclaiming with joy)

1252
00:45:12,823 --> 00:45:14,193
- It's good. - Thank you.

1253
00:45:15,093 --> 00:45:16,563
- My, this is so good. - Yes.

1254
00:45:16,633 --> 00:45:18,292
- It's on the house. - Great. This is delicious.

1255
00:45:18,293 --> 00:45:19,733
The custard cream is refreshing.

1256
00:45:21,603 --> 00:45:22,603
My face...

1257
00:45:22,604 --> 00:45:25,033
(They set off to the second place again, walking in the cold.)

1258
00:45:25,403 --> 00:45:27,703
Hey, I thought you were Jun Ha.

1259
00:45:29,073 --> 00:45:31,142
(I look like Jun Ha when I'm outside in the cold.)

1260
00:45:31,143 --> 00:45:32,443
- It's so cold. Gosh. - Give it to me.

1261
00:45:33,113 --> 00:45:36,083
What? Oh, there used to be a famous restaurant here.

1262
00:45:36,953 --> 00:45:39,383
(They found a small cafe while walking on the street.)

1263
00:45:40,923 --> 00:45:44,393
(Trendy Places in Incheon: M bakery: Small, cozy cafe)

1264
00:45:44,623 --> 00:45:47,692
(But they will pass the place as they have a long way to go.)

1265
00:45:47,693 --> 00:45:49,432
- Let's go in. - Right. Let's go in.

1266
00:45:49,433 --> 00:45:50,763
- Let's go in for now. - Okay.

1267
00:45:51,233 --> 00:45:53,603
- Let's go in to warm ourselves up. - Hello.

1268
00:45:53,863 --> 00:45:55,063
- Welcome. - Ma'am, it's so cold outside.

1269
00:45:55,573 --> 00:45:56,703
It's been a while...

1270
00:46:00,003 --> 00:46:01,102
It shows how cold it is outside.

1271
00:46:01,103 --> 00:46:02,872
You see how cold it is outside, right?

1272
00:46:02,873 --> 00:46:04,872
(You see how cold it is outside, right?)

1273
00:46:04,873 --> 00:46:06,013
It's been a long while...

1274
00:46:06,713 --> 00:46:08,183
since I last saw my glasses fog up.

1275
00:46:09,413 --> 00:46:10,583
- Why don't yours fog up? - You can't see anything.

1276
00:46:11,283 --> 00:46:12,853
- Her glasses don't... - Oh, yours don't have lenses.

1277
00:46:12,953 --> 00:46:15,052
I haven't seen my glasses fog up in a long time.

1278
00:46:15,053 --> 00:46:16,623
We should call you Mr. Glasses.

1279
00:46:18,923 --> 00:46:20,693
- Oh, my. What's this? - Sweet potato...

1280
00:46:21,093 --> 00:46:22,492
- My goodness. - They're so cute.

1281
00:46:22,493 --> 00:46:23,692
Are they just shaped like this?

1282
00:46:23,693 --> 00:46:25,163
- I want to try this. - Ma'am.

1283
00:46:25,431 --> 00:46:27,301
- Oh, my. What's this? - Sweet potato...

1284
00:46:27,631 --> 00:46:28,971
- My goodness. - They're so cute.

1285
00:46:29,071 --> 00:46:30,200
Are they just shaped like this?

1286
00:46:30,201 --> 00:46:31,731
- I want to try this. - Ma'am.

(They broke the perception of vegetables.)

1289
00:46:38,511 --> 00:46:40,481
(Hardy crop bread)

1290
00:46:40,781 --> 00:46:42,951
(This bread in a mysterious, purple color is...)

1291
00:46:43,851 --> 00:46:45,421
(sweet potato.)

1292
00:46:45,721 --> 00:46:47,781

1295
00:46:51,951 --> 00:46:53,321
- It's pretty. - It's so cute.

1296
00:46:53,361 --> 00:46:54,821
- I really like this. - How cute.

1297
00:46:55,061 --> 00:46:56,460
This one looks like a real onion.

1298
00:46:56,461 --> 00:46:57,830
- Yes. - You're right.

1299
00:46:57,831 --> 00:46:59,731
(They look 99.9 percent similar to actual hardy crops.)

1300
00:47:00,531 --> 00:47:02,931

1304
00:47:14,241 --> 00:47:15,811
- Let's get the sweet potato bread. - Yes.

1305
00:47:16,211 --> 00:47:18,211
- What about the corn bread? - The corn bread looks cute.

1306
00:47:18,551 --> 00:47:20,281
- I like the corn bread. - I think it will be tasty.

1307
00:47:20,621 --> 00:47:22,420
- Then... - We have these too.

1308
00:47:22,421 --> 00:47:24,921
- We'll get the sweet potato... - Gosh, those are so cute.

1309
00:47:25,021 --> 00:47:27,561
- Did you shape them like this? - Those are so cute.

1310
00:47:28,021 --> 00:47:29,760
The details are great. There's soil.

1311
00:47:29,761 --> 00:47:31,761
- They're so cute. - The ends.

00:47:36,331 --> 00:47:37,631
(onto the flattened dough.)

(Roll the dough into a long, leek-like shape.)

1316
00:47:42,101 --> 00:47:43,740
(The key is covering the ends with cocoa powder...)

1317
00:47:43,741 --> 00:47:45,341
(to make them look like roots covered in soil.)

1318
00:47:45,841 --> 00:47:48,281
(Lastly, bake them in the oven!)

1319
00:47:49,451 --> 00:47:51,951
(Ki Young is in love with the leek bread.)

1320

- These are so cute. - This place is really trendy.

1321
00:47:54,381 --> 00:47:55,690
- Right. - They're amazing.

1322
00:47:55,691 --> 00:47:58,190
- The sweet potato bread is... - Are you packing them in a net?

1323
00:47:58,191 --> 00:48:01,160
- She's packing them in a net. - I love this place.

1324
00:48:01,161 --> 00:48:02,990
- This place is great. - That's such a cool idea.

1325

- Gosh. - An onion net.

1326
00:48:05,131 --> 00:48:07,160
- This is so fun. - Is that your mother?

1327
00:48:07,161 --> 00:48:09,100
- Yes, that's my mom. - I see.

1328
00:48:09,101 --> 00:48:11,000
- That's strange. - Mother and daughter.

1329

Families running businesses together.

1330
00:48:13,171 --> 00:48:15,610
- Mother and daughter, together. - Maybe it's an Incheon thing.

1331
00:48:15,611 --> 00:48:17,210
- Right. - Lots of family businesses.

1332
00:48:17,211 --> 00:48:19,240
The big-eyed herring sashimi place was also family-owned.

1333
00:48:19,241 --> 00:48:20,311
The fish-shaped bread stand too.

1334
00:48:20,441 --> 00:48:22,581
That was owned by a mother and daughter.

1335
00:48:22,911 --> 00:48:25,520
- This place too. - Right.

1336
00:48:25,521 --> 00:48:28,780
Are there a lot of businesses owned by mother and daughter here?

1337
00:48:28,781 --> 00:48:31,220
- Yes. - That's so heart-warming.

1338
00:48:31,221 --> 00:48:32,960
- It must be an Incheon thing. - That's cool.

1339
00:48:32,961 --> 00:48:34,291
That's cool.

1340
00:48:34,591 --> 00:48:36,590
Also, I'll have a hot chocolate.

1341
00:48:36,591 --> 00:48:37,731

1343
00:48:39,161 --> 00:48:40,231
You cheated.

1344
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:41,660
(Childish Yu wants hot chocolate.)

1345
00:48:41,661 --> 00:48:44,270
- I want to drink something too. - What do you want?

1346
00:48:44,271 --> 00:48:46,241
- I'll also have a hot chocolate. - That's so funny.

1347
00:48:46,341 --> 00:48:49,240
- I'll pay. Yes. - Are you paying, CEO Song?

1348
00:48:49,241 --> 00:48:50,410
All right.

1349
00:48:50,411 --> 00:48:52,640
- I love going to places with you. - Right?

1350
00:48:52,641 --> 00:48:53,711
- Yes. - Right.

1351
00:48:53,741 --> 00:48:55,140
- It's 28 dollars. - Here you go.

1352
00:48:55,141 --> 00:48:56,551
It's 28 dollars?

1353
00:48:56,781 --> 00:48:58,611
I spent 100 dollars.

1354
00:48:58,711 --> 00:49:00,120
Gosh, what a relief.

1355
00:49:00,121 --> 00:49:02,120
He spent 100 dollars this morning.

1356
00:49:02,121 --> 00:49:03,820
I spent more than 100 dollars this morning.

1357
00:49:03,821 --> 00:49:04,821
("I spent more than 100 dollars this morning.")

1358
00:49:05,291 --> 00:49:06,690
(Jae Seok paid at the bakery earlier this morning.)

1359
00:49:06,691 --> 00:49:08,291
(The total is 100 dollars.)

1360
00:49:08,721 --> 00:49:10,431
(It's only the beginning of the day, but I spent way too much money.)

1361
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:14,061
(This is why it's dangerous to go eat on an empty stomach.)

1362
00:49:14,401 --> 00:49:16,701
This is annoying. I spent over 100 dollars.

1363
00:49:17,471 --> 00:49:19,041
- In the morning... - That was nice of you.

1364
00:49:19,471 --> 00:49:22,040
Thanks to you, we all had a good time.

1365
00:49:22,041 --> 00:49:23,041
(As long as everyone was happy.)

1366
00:49:23,511 --> 00:49:25,410
(The bread they ordered is given to them inside an onion net.)

1367
00:49:25,411 --> 00:49:27,411
Gosh, this onion net.

1368
00:49:27,511 --> 00:49:30,210
- It's so cute. - Gosh, I love this.

1369
00:49:30,211 --> 00:49:32,780
- It's so cute. - She put a ketchup packet inside.

1370
00:49:32,781 --> 00:49:33,920
Ketchup and other sauces.

1371
00:49:33,921 --> 00:49:36,590
Business owners are so creative these days.

1372
00:49:36,591 --> 00:49:38,391
They're amazing.

1373
00:49:38,621 --> 00:49:40,661
This is so cute.

1374
00:49:40,821 --> 00:49:41,821
(It's so cute that they feel happy just from looking at it.)

1375
00:49:41,822 --> 00:49:43,330
Customers will feel so happy to get their order.

1376
00:49:43,331 --> 00:49:44,390
(It's so cute that they feel happy just from looking at it.)

1377
00:49:44,391 --> 00:49:46,761
- They're too good to eat. - Right.

1378
00:49:47,331 --> 00:49:49,371
- I'll tear off a piece to eat. - Go ahead.

1379
00:49:50,701 --> 00:49:52,901
Gosh, there's sweet potato inside.

1380
00:49:53,941 --> 00:49:55,170
Goodness.

1381
00:49:55,171 --> 00:49:56,541
There's a whole sweet potato inside?

1382
00:49:57,341 --> 00:49:59,241
(The filling is made of sweet potato,)

1383
00:50:00,281 --> 00:50:03,411
(so the bread looks and tastes exactly like a sweet potato.)

1384
00:50:04,481 --> 00:50:06,851
(The sweet potato bread looks the same as the real vegetable.)

1385
00:50:07,621 --> 00:50:09,320
The texture is totally like a roasted sweet potato.

1386
00:50:09,321 --> 00:50:11,550
(The sweet potato is especially tasty in the cold weather.)

1387
00:50:11,551 --> 00:50:12,721
Gosh, what is this?

1388
00:50:12,921 --> 00:50:14,921
(I love this.)

1389
00:50:15,261 --> 00:50:18,891
(One bite of the sweet potato bread will keep them warm from the cold.)

1390
00:50:19,101 --> 00:50:20,530
(Yum)

1391
00:50:20,531 --> 00:50:21,961
(Jae Seok's frown is showing how much he's enjoying it.)

1392
00:50:22,801 --> 00:50:24,971
- Gosh, it's so good. - It's so good.

1393
00:50:25,431 --> 00:50:26,471
Goodness.

1394
00:50:26,741 --> 00:50:27,871
(How is this possible?)

1395
00:50:27,971 --> 00:50:29,040
Roasted sweet potato.

1396
00:50:29,041 --> 00:50:30,111
(It tastes like a roasted sweet potato!)

1397
00:50:30,371 --> 00:50:32,811
- Gosh, this is good. - It's so good.

1398
00:50:33,141 --> 00:50:34,611
(Kochelin Kyoung Pyo loves it.)

1399
00:50:35,441 --> 00:50:37,311
(Yoon Kyung can't take her eyes off the bread.)

1400
00:50:37,511 --> 00:50:38,511
That's the potato bread.

1401
00:50:39,081 --> 00:50:40,581
I'm sorry, but that's the garlic bread.

1402
00:50:42,021 --> 00:50:44,291
- No matter how hip... - It's like garlic baguette.

1403
00:50:45,051 --> 00:50:47,591
(Let me try.)

1404
00:50:49,261 --> 00:50:50,291
The garlic bread is so good too.

1405
00:50:51,461 --> 00:50:52,730
(The garlic bread filling...)

1406
00:50:52,731 --> 00:50:54,361
(is made of garlic and cream cheese.)

1407
00:50:55,101 --> 00:50:59,041
(The bread is shaped like a head of garlic with six cloves.)

1408
00:50:59,741 --> 00:51:01,871
(The garlic bread tastes just like garlic.)

1409
00:51:03,371 --> 00:51:05,681
(The garlic and cheese make it very flavorful!)

1410
00:51:06,441 --> 00:51:07,740
How did they come up with this idea?

1411
00:51:07,741 --> 00:51:08,741
(Both the taste and idea are amazing.)

1412
00:51:09,381 --> 00:51:11,081
(Amazed)

1413
00:51:11,351 --> 00:51:12,650
I would have been confused...

1414
00:51:12,651 --> 00:51:13,981
if we had to find out whether this place was real or not.

1415
00:51:14,351 --> 00:51:15,821
(The bread is so good that Mimi is dazed.)

1416
00:51:16,221 --> 00:51:17,420
I'm thankful that this is real.

1417
00:51:17,421 --> 00:51:18,621
(Thankfully, the bakery is real.)

1418
00:51:18,991 --> 00:51:21,521
- I'm really in love. - These are so good.

1419
00:51:22,261 --> 00:51:24,861
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1420
00:51:25,161 --> 00:51:26,161
(Licking his lips)

1421
00:51:26,162 --> 00:51:28,261
(This guy seems reluctant to leave.)

1422
00:51:29,571 --> 00:51:30,571
(Quietly)

1423
00:51:30,572 --> 00:51:32,601
(Kyoung Pyo walks over to the counter.)

1424
00:51:33,001 --> 00:51:34,040
These are so good.

1425
00:51:34,041 --> 00:51:35,041
(His eyes are glued to the bread while praising the owner.)

1426
00:51:35,042 --> 00:51:36,111
They're so cool too.

1427
00:51:37,041 --> 00:51:38,110
(Kyoung Pyo, aren't you coming?)

1428
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:39,340
- They're good, right? - Yes.

1429
00:51:39,341 --> 00:51:40,341
(Kyoung Pyo, aren't you coming?)

1430
00:51:40,441 --> 00:51:41,610
- They're good, right? - Yes.

1431
00:51:41,611 --> 00:51:42,981
(The back of Kyoung Pyo's head is screaming reluctance.)

1432
00:51:44,381 --> 00:51:45,511
Let's go.

1433
00:51:46,181 --> 00:51:48,121
(Goodness)

1434
00:51:48,251 --> 00:51:50,190
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1435
00:51:50,191 --> 00:51:52,791
- Goodbye. - Thank you.

1436
00:51:53,491 --> 00:51:55,760
- Eating that warmed me up. - Warmed you up?

1437
00:51:55,761 --> 00:51:56,761
- Right. - We can start walking again.

1438
00:51:57,391 --> 00:52:00,060
There are lots of nice restaurants in Incheon.

1439
00:52:00,061 --> 00:52:01,760
- That's right. - Yes.

1440
00:52:01,761 --> 00:52:02,801
Your perspective only widens when you travel around.

1441
00:52:03,031 --> 00:52:04,871
- It doesn't if you don't. - You get stuck in your little pond.

1442
00:52:05,271 --> 00:52:06,600
You become a big fish in a little pond.

1443
00:52:06,601 --> 00:52:07,940
No, you're a grasshopper in a little pond.

1444
00:52:07,941 --> 00:52:09,041
A little pond...

1445
00:52:09,441 --> 00:52:11,140
No, grasshoppers can't survive in water.

1446
00:52:11,141 --> 00:52:12,311
- Can't they? - I see.

1447
00:52:12,611 --> 00:52:13,880
- Can't they? - No.

1448
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:14,911
I see.

1449
00:52:15,381 --> 00:52:17,781
(The secret to their friendship is quickly accepting what's right.)

1450
00:52:18,411 --> 00:52:20,050
I think I see something.

1451
00:52:20,051 --> 00:52:21,220
(What kind of restaurant could the super huge trendy place be?)

1452
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:22,221
- Wait. - Where is it?

1453
00:52:22,381 --> 00:52:23,751
- What's that? - Naengmyeon?

1454
00:52:25,791 --> 00:52:28,461
(Could it be a restaurant that sells super huge naengmyeon?)

1455
00:52:28,691 --> 00:52:30,130
- Is this it? - Naengmyeon. Could it be...

1456
00:52:30,131 --> 00:52:31,660
- washbowl naengmyeon? - It could be washbowl naengmyeon.

1457
00:52:31,661 --> 00:52:32,701
Gosh, is this it?

1458
00:52:33,101 --> 00:52:35,730
Gosh, I'm in trouble. We're here to eat one of my favorite food.

1459
00:52:35,731 --> 00:52:38,231
- Gosh. This is... - Seriously...

1460
00:52:39,001 --> 00:52:40,100
(They were almost sure that it was a super huge naengmyeon restaurant.)

1461
00:52:40,101 --> 00:52:41,541
- Let's go inside. - Let's go.

1462
00:52:42,441 --> 00:52:44,710
- "Dumpling?" - It says "huge dumpling soup."

1463
00:52:44,711 --> 00:52:46,040
- Huge dumpling soup? - Huge dumpling soup?

1464
00:52:46,041 --> 00:52:47,110
(Huge dumpling soup)

1465
00:52:47,111 --> 00:52:50,951
(The super huge dish of the second trendy place)

1466
00:52:51,181 --> 00:52:53,420
- I love dumpling places with steam. - I love them.

1467
00:52:53,421 --> 00:52:54,480
They're so nice.

1468
00:52:54,481 --> 00:52:55,891
(The steam from the steamer shows how serious they are.)

1469
00:52:56,851 --> 00:52:58,751
(They make dumplings by the book.)

1470
00:52:59,691 --> 00:53:01,660
(Their dumplings are famous for how tasty they are,)

1471
00:53:01,661 --> 00:53:03,631
(with thin skin and plenty of filling.)

1472
00:53:05,531 --> 00:53:07,831
(This dumpling restaurant is a must-try in Incheon.)

1473
00:53:08,161 --> 00:53:09,530
(One day, huge dumpling soup hit social media.)

1474
00:53:09,531 --> 00:53:11,331
(It went viral.)

1475
00:53:12,371 --> 00:53:14,801
(From popular mukbang YouTuber Heebab...)

1476
00:53:15,641 --> 00:53:19,111
(to mukbang YouTuber SangHyuk...)

1477
00:53:19,481 --> 00:53:20,541
This is good. Gosh.

1478
00:53:21,241 --> 00:53:23,281
(and mukbang YouTuber Mukgang,)

1479
00:53:24,181 --> 00:53:27,451
(social media is full of reviews about the huge dumpling soup.)

1480
00:53:28,051 --> 00:53:30,621
(The Incheon dumpling restaurant has become a trendy place.)

1481
00:53:31,491 --> 00:53:34,760
(What super huge dish made this place trendy?)

1482
00:53:34,761 --> 00:53:35,961
Handmade dumplings.

1483
00:53:36,731 --> 00:53:38,260
I love dumpling soup.

1484
00:53:38,261 --> 00:53:40,130
Me too. I love dumplings.

1485
00:53:40,131 --> 00:53:42,300
I love dumplings. This is going to be good.

1486
00:53:42,301 --> 00:53:43,670
I should have starved for two days before coming here.

1487
00:53:43,671 --> 00:53:45,071
Everything we're eating today is amazing.

1488
00:53:45,231 --> 00:53:46,771
Gosh, what's this?

1489
00:53:47,441 --> 00:53:49,071
- These are... - Hello.

1490
00:53:49,541 --> 00:53:51,811
(To begin with, the inside of the restaurant...)

1491
00:53:52,681 --> 00:53:55,881
(looks like a regular neighborhood restaurant.)

1492
00:53:56,551 --> 00:53:58,551
(What?)

1493
00:53:58,981 --> 00:54:00,051
What's that?

1494
00:54:00,251 --> 00:54:01,621
There's a celebrity.

1495
00:54:02,051 --> 00:54:04,891
- It's Poongja. - A celebrity introduced this place.

1496
00:54:05,351 --> 00:54:08,761
She's a foodie, so she's always going to places with good food.

1497
00:54:09,361 --> 00:54:10,430
That's the dish they serve here?

1498
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:12,390
(Why did Poongja film her YouTube variety show here?)

1499
00:54:12,391 --> 00:54:13,501
(Eyes wide open)

1500
00:54:15,331 --> 00:54:17,371
(Foodie Poongja is the host of...)

1501
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:20,001
("Repeat Restaurant.")

1502
00:54:20,341 --> 00:54:22,301
(It's a YouTube variety show with 1.17 million subscribers.)

1503
00:54:22,571 --> 00:54:24,070
(Suwon, Sokcho, Jeonju, Busan, Mokpo, Daegu, Jeju, Gwangju, Ulsan)

1504
00:54:24,071 --> 00:54:25,441
(Poongja travels to every corner of the country,)

1505
00:54:26,281 --> 00:54:30,411
(on the hunt for real local restaurants.)

1506
00:54:31,051 --> 00:54:33,951
(It seems like this restaurant was featured on Poongja's show.)

1507
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:36,591
(That's the dish they serve here?)

1508
00:54:37,791 --> 00:54:39,761
(The super huge dumpling soup will be revealed soon.)

1509
00:54:41,021 --> 00:54:43,761
(Watching carefully)

1510
00:54:44,261 --> 00:54:45,731
Has anyone watched that episode?

1511
00:54:46,331 --> 00:54:47,331
Not me.

1512
00:54:48,301 --> 00:54:50,201
I think that's the best way to fool us.

1513
00:54:50,531 --> 00:54:53,440
- They could have asked Poongja... - To film this episode.

1514
00:54:53,441 --> 00:54:55,241
- That's right. - Yes.

1515
00:54:55,701 --> 00:54:58,311
Think carefully, so we don't walk into a trap.

1516
00:54:58,411 --> 00:54:59,681
The first restaurant seemed fake, right?

1517
00:55:00,211 --> 00:55:02,881
If we decide this seems fake too, we'll start to get confused.

1518
00:55:04,211 --> 00:55:06,051
That's how it begins.

1519
00:55:06,181 --> 00:55:08,280
That's how it begins. We're already trapped.

1520
00:55:08,281 --> 00:55:10,820
They both seem so fake!

1521
00:55:10,821 --> 00:55:11,990
This is how...

1522
00:55:11,991 --> 00:55:13,160
Even those bottles of ginseng liquor seem fake.

1523
00:55:13,161 --> 00:55:14,591
(Even the smallest details seem fake to them.)

1524
00:55:14,791 --> 00:55:16,661
When we get to the final restaurant, we'll think that's fake too.

1525
00:55:17,761 --> 00:55:18,790
This is only the beginning.

1526
00:55:18,791 --> 00:55:21,561
(Welcome to the trap of fakery.)

1527
00:55:22,101 --> 00:55:24,200
- I love the idea, though. - The idea is great.

1528
00:55:24,201 --> 00:55:25,270
Huge dumpling soup.

1529
00:55:25,271 --> 00:55:27,940
Gosh, that means the dumpling skin would have to be thick.

1530
00:55:27,941 --> 00:55:30,111
- Let's see for ourselves first. - Let's see.

1531
00:55:30,371 --> 00:55:32,980
- Excuse me, we'd like to order. - Excuse me.

1532
00:55:32,981 --> 00:55:33,981
Yes.

1533
00:55:33,982 --> 00:55:36,980
- Hello. - Hello.

1534
00:55:36,981 --> 00:55:39,521
- Do you sell huge dumpling soup? - Yes.

1535
00:55:39,921 --> 00:55:41,351
The dumplings are bigger than our heads.

1536
00:55:42,381 --> 00:55:44,250
How long have you been making these?

1537
00:55:44,251 --> 00:55:45,751
We began in March last year.

1538
00:55:45,851 --> 00:55:48,020
- It's been a while, then. - It's when the restaurant reopened.

1539
00:55:48,021 --> 00:55:50,361
My son and I were watching TV for inspiration,

1540
00:55:50,831 --> 00:55:52,900
and we saw huge pork cutlets...

1541
00:55:52,901 --> 00:55:54,400
and huge ramyeon.

1542
00:55:54,401 --> 00:55:56,670
(They found out how popular huge foods were through their TV.)

1543
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:59,700
I came up with the idea to make huge-sized dumplings,

1544
00:55:59,701 --> 00:56:02,040
and my son said "Let's go for it."

1545
00:56:02,041 --> 00:56:05,040
That's when we began experimenting, and we've been selling it since May.

1546
00:56:05,041 --> 00:56:06,541
- Really? - Yes.

1547
00:56:07,681 --> 00:56:09,850
- Is that your son in the back? - Yes.

1548
00:56:09,851 --> 00:56:10,950
- I see. - Hello.

1549
00:56:10,951 --> 00:56:12,250
- Hello. - They run the restaurant together.

1550
00:56:12,251 --> 00:56:13,651
But why are there...

1551
00:56:14,081 --> 00:56:15,551
Every store is a family business here.

1552
00:56:16,321 --> 00:56:18,951
- The other places were owned by... - Mother and daughter.

1553
00:56:19,861 --> 00:56:22,061
Every place we've been to today was like that.

1554
00:56:22,461 --> 00:56:25,031
- This is owned by mother and son. - Right.

1555
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:26,200
How is this possible?

1556
00:56:26,201 --> 00:56:28,430
- They're all family businesses. - It's fascinating.

1557
00:56:28,431 --> 00:56:29,431
They must all get along with each other.

1558
00:56:29,571 --> 00:56:32,370
My son has his own naengmyeon restaurant.

1559
00:56:32,371 --> 00:56:34,671
But I got sick.

1560
00:56:35,301 --> 00:56:36,441
I got sick...

1561
00:56:36,711 --> 00:56:39,111
and received medical treatment, so I had to take some time off.

1562
00:56:39,711 --> 00:56:42,480
My son first came to help me out, and now we run it together.

1563
00:56:42,481 --> 00:56:44,111
(What a great son.)

1564
00:56:44,681 --> 00:56:48,421
(The mother was sick. During that desperate situation,)

1565
00:56:49,851 --> 00:56:52,551
(she made huge dumpling soup thanks to the help of her son.)

1566
00:56:53,891 --> 00:56:54,920
(What would it taste like?)

1567
00:56:54,921 --> 00:56:56,060
Since we have to try it,

1568
00:56:56,061 --> 00:56:57,530
- we'll order a huge dumpling soup. - Okay.

1569
00:56:57,531 --> 00:56:58,991
- Thank you. - Sure thing.

1570
00:56:59,461 --> 00:57:01,631
- Super huge dumpling soup. - It should be good.

1571
00:57:01,861 --> 00:57:03,971
But this is kind of strange too.

1572
00:57:04,601 --> 00:57:06,100
Look over there.

1573
00:57:06,101 --> 00:57:07,840
- Gosh. - A challenge board.

1574
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:09,840
They have a challenge.

1575
00:57:09,841 --> 00:57:11,670
It's for mukbang YouTubers...

1576
00:57:11,671 --> 00:57:13,041
or people who can eat large portions.

1577
00:57:14,041 --> 00:57:15,680
- Those are people who succeeded. - I'll go check.

1578
00:57:15,681 --> 00:57:17,550
(Curious Mimi gets up to check.)

1579
00:57:17,551 --> 00:57:19,820
People who succeeded. That's Heebab!

1580
00:57:19,821 --> 00:57:21,351
(That's Heebab!)

1581
00:57:22,021 --> 00:57:23,320
(She's capable of eating huge portions of food.)

1582
00:57:23,321 --> 00:57:26,921
(Mukbang YouTuber, Heebab)

1583
00:57:27,321 --> 00:57:29,830
(Has Heebab been to this huge dumpling restaurant too?)

1584
00:57:29,831 --> 00:57:31,130
Heebab is in first place.

1585
00:57:31,131 --> 00:57:32,160
- Really? - Yes.

1586
00:57:32,161 --> 00:57:33,660
That makes so much sense.

1587
00:57:33,661 --> 00:57:35,260
Her record is 12 minutes and 26 seconds.

1588
00:57:35,261 --> 00:57:37,000
It's understandable if the person was Heebab.

1589
00:57:37,001 --> 00:57:38,130
Heebab definitely could have done that.

1590
00:57:38,131 --> 00:57:40,000
Gosh. You're right.

1591
00:57:40,001 --> 00:57:41,201
Heebab...

1592
00:57:42,241 --> 00:57:43,640
- That is her. - I think so too.

1593
00:57:43,641 --> 00:57:45,740
- Let's see. - There's Poongja.

1594
00:57:45,741 --> 00:57:47,211
She was here last year in September.

1595
00:57:47,841 --> 00:57:48,911
You're right.

1596
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:50,311
September.
(New clue: Poongja ate at the restaurant in September.)

1597
00:57:52,551 --> 00:57:53,851
Let's go back to May.

1598
00:57:54,481 --> 00:57:56,251
Do you want to know what I think feels fake?

1599
00:57:57,391 --> 00:57:59,660
- What's this neighborhood called? - Guwol-dong.

1600
00:57:59,661 --> 00:58:01,460
What month did Poongja come here?

1601
00:58:01,461 --> 00:58:02,831
- September. - September.

1602
00:58:04,431 --> 00:58:05,431
You think they did that on purpose?

1603
00:58:05,432 --> 00:58:07,060
The Sixth Sense staff...

1604
00:58:07,061 --> 00:58:09,331
- They love planting clues. - They love planting clues.

1605
00:58:09,671 --> 00:58:12,401
(Guwol-dong and September)

1606
00:58:12,971 --> 00:58:16,441
(Is it a coincidence? Or code for "fake" planted by the staff?)

1607
00:58:16,671 --> 00:58:18,971
If you're right, they must be feeling anxious.

1608
00:58:19,041 --> 00:58:21,311
- It was a sharp observation, right? - I got chills.

1609
00:58:21,881 --> 00:58:24,081
(Is it that significant?)

1610
00:58:24,181 --> 00:58:26,681
- I think this place is real. - Why?

1611
00:58:27,151 --> 00:58:28,450
Only that video is fake.

1612
00:58:28,451 --> 00:58:29,451
(That's not possible.)

1613
00:58:29,452 --> 00:58:30,951
- That's not possible. - It's not?

1614
00:58:31,351 --> 00:58:32,351
Is it not possible?

1615
00:58:32,791 --> 00:58:34,321
But that can't be.

1616
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:37,591
Something feels wrong about that "Repeat Restaurant" video.

1617
00:58:38,231 --> 00:58:40,160
Because yesterday and the day before,

1618
00:58:40,161 --> 00:58:42,330
I binge-watched the entire series.

1619
00:58:42,331 --> 00:58:43,600
- Every "Repeat Restaurant" episode. - Really?

1620
00:58:43,601 --> 00:58:46,771
- But I don't think I saw that one. - Really?

1621
00:58:46,901 --> 00:58:49,300
Then the huge dumpling soup itself would be fake.

1622
00:58:49,301 --> 00:58:51,670
Right. This place could be a dumpling restaurant,

1623
00:58:51,671 --> 00:58:53,911
but the huge dumpling would not be on their menu. Gosh.

1624
00:58:54,341 --> 00:58:56,451
- Yes, it is. Look. - The food is here.

1625
00:58:56,681 --> 00:58:58,680
(Yes, it is! Look.)

1626
00:58:58,681 --> 00:58:59,681
What?

1627
00:59:00,121 --> 00:59:02,481
- It is on our menu. - This is what it looks like?

1628
00:59:04,651 --> 00:59:08,220
(The huge dumpling soup is finally revealed.)

1629
00:59:08,221 --> 00:59:10,331
Gosh. This is amazing even if it ends up being fake.

1630
00:59:10,931 --> 00:59:12,160
This is amazing.

1631
00:59:12,161 --> 00:59:13,500
Gosh, this is amazing.

1632
00:59:13,501 --> 00:59:15,301
This can't be for one person.

1633
00:59:15,731 --> 00:59:17,430
I think this would be enough food for all of us.

1634
00:59:17,431 --> 00:59:18,501
What's the portion size?

1635
00:59:18,871 --> 00:59:21,300
- It's the big version. - This really is amazing.

1636
00:59:21,301 --> 00:59:22,570
(Amazing)

1637
00:59:22,571 --> 00:59:23,641
It's really huge.

1638
00:59:24,371 --> 00:59:25,670
- What is this? - Here you go.

1639
00:59:25,671 --> 00:59:26,941
(Gosh, I have to take a picture of this.)

1640
00:59:27,141 --> 00:59:29,010
I think this could feed at least four people.

1641
00:59:29,011 --> 00:59:33,081
(Huge dumpling soup that's sold at Incheon's super huge trendy place)

1642
00:59:34,081 --> 00:59:37,251
(The dumpling is 50 times the size of a regular dumpling.)

1643
00:59:38,591 --> 00:59:39,861
We make the dumpling skin...

1644
00:59:39,961 --> 00:59:41,121
by kneading the flour with hot water.

1645
00:59:41,521 --> 00:59:43,190
My son is strong,

1646
00:59:43,191 --> 00:59:44,730
so he flattens out the dough for 30 minutes.

1647
00:59:44,731 --> 00:59:47,560
That's how it gets its chewy texture.

1648
00:59:47,561 --> 00:59:48,861
(The dumpling skin has a chewy texture.)

1649
00:59:49,901 --> 00:59:52,631
(A large amount of filling goes into the huge dumpling.)

1650
00:59:52,971 --> 00:59:54,600
Every morning, we buy fresh,

1651
00:59:54,601 --> 00:59:57,141
good-quality ingredients and make the filling.

1652
00:59:57,571 --> 01:00:00,641
We don't use machines. We prep each ingredient by hand.

1653
01:00:00,711 --> 01:00:01,711
It takes us two hours.

1654
01:00:01,712 --> 01:00:03,180
(Prepping the ingredients for the huge dumpling takes two hours.)

1655
01:00:03,181 --> 01:00:05,080
Usually, dumpling filling...

1656
01:00:05,081 --> 01:00:07,050
is made with cooked ingredients.

1657
01:00:07,051 --> 01:00:09,821
But we use raw vegetables,

1658
01:00:10,151 --> 01:00:11,520
so it has a good texture.

1659
01:00:11,521 --> 01:00:12,651
(Raw vegetables are used in the huge dumpling for crunchiness!)

1660
01:00:13,421 --> 01:00:14,690
Since the dumpling is very big,

1661
01:00:14,691 --> 01:00:17,031
we slightly stir-fry the meat.

1662
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:20,460
We use pork and beef.

1663
01:00:20,461 --> 01:00:26,171
(Three different kinds of meat are used for one dumpling.)

1664
01:00:26,801 --> 01:00:29,671
(The dumpling skin is bigger than a pizza dough.)

1665
01:00:30,041 --> 01:00:32,010
The filling weighs 1,500g,

1666
01:00:32,011 --> 01:00:34,111
including all the meat and vegetables.

1667
01:00:35,141 --> 01:00:37,811
(The mother and son put their hearts into making this huge dumpling.)

1668
01:00:38,751 --> 01:00:42,620
(The secret beef broth that's poured over the dumpling...)

1669
01:00:42,621 --> 01:00:46,191
(has a simple and clean flavor that tastes excellent!)

1670
01:00:47,221 --> 01:00:49,661
(The huge dumpling soup is the owner's ambitious masterpiece!)

1671
01:00:50,131 --> 01:00:51,190
(It encourages mukbang YouTubers to participate in their challenge.)

1672
01:00:51,191 --> 01:00:52,391
There's so much food.

1673
01:00:52,591 --> 01:00:54,931
The dumpling is great too, but the broth is insane.

1674
01:00:56,331 --> 01:00:59,171
(The trendy place went viral on social media within 6 months.)

1675
01:00:59,641 --> 01:01:02,941
(The taste, looks, and popularity of the dumpling soup are huge.)

1676
01:01:03,141 --> 01:01:04,370
("I feel like this place will be on Sixth Sense sometime soon.")

1677
01:01:04,371 --> 01:01:08,080
(Social media has been flooded with comments mentioning Sixth Sense.)

1678
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:10,510
(The huge dumpling soup is on a road to success.)

1679
01:01:10,511 --> 01:01:12,350
Our monthly sales are 20,000 dollars.

1680
01:01:12,351 --> 01:01:14,551
(Their monthly sales are 20,000 dollars just from dumplings.)

1681
01:01:15,281 --> 01:01:18,750
Sixth Sense members, is this dish real?

1682
01:01:18,751 --> 01:01:21,391
(Sixth Sense members, is the huge dumpling soup real?)

1683
01:01:21,621 --> 01:01:23,030
How do we eat this?

1684
01:01:23,031 --> 01:01:26,461
This top part is quite thick.

1685
01:01:26,901 --> 01:01:29,001
Right, for this size.

1686
01:01:29,201 --> 01:01:30,701
We cut it up and eat it with the dumpling.

1687
01:01:31,531 --> 01:01:33,240
It's like sujebi.

1688
01:01:33,241 --> 01:01:34,241
(Cut the thick edge of the dumpling and eat the pieces like sujebi.)

1689
01:01:34,341 --> 01:01:35,801
And then do this.

1690
01:01:36,441 --> 01:01:37,441
Like that.

1691
01:01:37,841 --> 01:01:41,980
(The dumpling skin is full of juicy filling.)

1692
01:01:41,981 --> 01:01:43,710
- That looks insane. - I've never seen anything like it.

1693
01:01:43,711 --> 01:01:45,050
I think this is real.

1694
01:01:45,051 --> 01:01:46,650
- I think it's real too. - You think it's real?

1695
01:01:46,651 --> 01:01:48,520
- I think it's real. - She seems proficient.

1696
01:01:48,521 --> 01:01:49,551
Gosh.

1697
01:01:50,021 --> 01:01:52,191
Gosh, we get all the filling.

1698
01:01:52,951 --> 01:01:54,261
The broth is rich.

1699
01:01:54,821 --> 01:01:57,390
(Will it taste as good as it looks?)

1700
01:01:57,391 --> 01:01:59,360
- Gosh. - It's so good.

1701
01:01:59,361 --> 01:02:00,700
- It's so good. - It's so good.

1702
01:02:00,701 --> 01:02:01,701
Is it that good?

1703
01:02:01,731 --> 01:02:03,700
It's not easy to hear such a deep sound from him.

1704
01:02:03,701 --> 01:02:04,830
- Right. - Yes.

1705
01:02:04,831 --> 01:02:06,470
- It's been a while. - He must love this.

1706
01:02:06,471 --> 01:02:07,540
This is the real thing. Try it.

1707
01:02:07,541 --> 01:02:08,641
We didn't hear that sound in the morning.

1708
01:02:11,611 --> 01:02:12,811
Gosh, what is this?

1709
01:02:13,881 --> 01:02:14,941
This is so good.

1710
01:02:15,381 --> 01:02:16,910
- It's so good, right? - Yes.

1711
01:02:16,911 --> 01:02:17,911
(Kyoung Pyo is in love with it too.)

1712
01:02:20,221 --> 01:02:21,721
(Slurping)

1713
01:02:22,821 --> 01:02:26,620
(Don't forget the dumpling skin.)

1714
01:02:26,621 --> 01:02:29,220
- The skin isn't overpowering. - Right.

1715
01:02:29,221 --> 01:02:30,760
It's not as thick as I thought it would be.

1716
01:02:30,761 --> 01:02:32,390
That's what I was worried about too.

1717
01:02:32,391 --> 01:02:34,030
- It's good. - You like it?

1718
01:02:34,031 --> 01:02:35,430
- Goodness. - It's like sujebi,

1719
01:02:35,431 --> 01:02:36,700
with its chewy texture.

1720
01:02:36,701 --> 01:02:40,400
And the dumpling skin absorbed the flavor of the broth.

1721
01:02:40,401 --> 01:02:41,401
(The chewy dumpling skin absorbed the flavor of the beef broth.)
- So it's tasty. - And...

1722
01:02:42,402 --> 01:02:43,810
the meat wasn't completely ground.

1723
01:02:43,811 --> 01:02:46,610
It feels like it was chopped for some texture.

1724
01:02:46,611 --> 01:02:49,111
I can chew on the pieces, which is fun.

1725
01:02:49,781 --> 01:02:52,110
The tofu pieces are chunky too.

1726
01:02:52,111 --> 01:02:54,780
That's right. They made sure we can chew on the ingredients.

1727
01:02:54,781 --> 01:02:56,951
- There are chunks. - The texture is great.

1728
01:02:57,291 --> 01:02:59,190
I'm amazed at how chunky the filling is.

1729
01:02:59,191 --> 01:03:00,260
(The dumpling is as good as it's huge.)

1730
01:03:00,261 --> 01:03:02,160
If this turns out to be fake...

1731
01:03:02,161 --> 01:03:03,961
- I feel like they could sell this. - Right.

1732
01:03:04,331 --> 01:03:05,691
I feel like it would be successful.

1733
01:03:06,131 --> 01:03:07,131
Seriously.

1734
01:03:08,761 --> 01:03:11,600
If we had to point out what feels fake about this,

1735
01:03:11,601 --> 01:03:12,900
the only thing would be Poongja's video.

1736
01:03:12,901 --> 01:03:15,240
(It would be Poongja's video that Yoon Kyung didn't see.)

1737
01:03:15,241 --> 01:03:16,610
- Excuse me. - Yes?

1738
01:03:16,611 --> 01:03:20,680
Where did Poongja sit when she came here to eat?

1739
01:03:20,681 --> 01:03:23,250
- Right where you're sitting. - Right here? This exact seat?

1740
01:03:23,251 --> 01:03:24,911
I think this was the background.

1741
01:03:25,751 --> 01:03:28,020
But the TV screen wasn't in the video...

1742
01:03:28,021 --> 01:03:29,080
when Poongja was eating.

1743
01:03:29,081 --> 01:03:30,550
(Did Blunt Mimi find a flaw in the video?)

1744
01:03:30,551 --> 01:03:31,950
(Look at you.)

1745
01:03:31,951 --> 01:03:33,420
- It wasn't? - The TV wasn't there.

1746
01:03:33,421 --> 01:03:35,560
I think the TV is in the picture, though.

1747
01:03:35,561 --> 01:03:36,960
- It is. - It is?

1748
01:03:36,961 --> 01:03:38,560
- He's so firm. - I tried to be sharp.

1749
01:03:38,561 --> 01:03:40,200
Your observation sounded very sharp.

1750
01:03:40,201 --> 01:03:42,560
Gosh. I thought it was genius, but it wasn't.

1751
01:03:42,561 --> 01:03:44,400
(Her beginning may seem sharp, but blunt her future will be.)

1752
01:03:44,401 --> 01:03:46,571
This could be what happened with Heebab.

1753
01:03:46,871 --> 01:03:49,000
She could have come here to see how many dumplings she could eat.

1754
01:03:49,001 --> 01:03:50,640
- I see. - Not the huge dumpling soup.

1755
01:03:50,641 --> 01:03:52,370
This could be a regular dumpling restaurant,

1756
01:03:52,371 --> 01:03:54,310
and she may have eaten 90 plates of dumplings.

1757
01:03:54,311 --> 01:03:56,041
- I see. - That could be the real challenge.

1758
01:03:56,481 --> 01:03:58,480
(Glancing over)

1759
01:03:58,481 --> 01:04:00,681
But it does say "huge dumpling soup challenge."

1760
01:04:01,281 --> 01:04:02,950
(Huge dumpling soup challenge!)

1761
01:04:02,951 --> 01:04:04,921
(It's written in plain sight.)

1762
01:04:05,421 --> 01:04:07,290
(Oops)

1763
01:04:07,291 --> 01:04:08,860
- What are you... - I was pretending to be sharp.

1764
01:04:08,861 --> 01:04:10,630
Stop getting unreasonable doubts.

1765
01:04:10,631 --> 01:04:12,590
I think the problem is in your posture.

1766
01:04:12,591 --> 01:04:14,030
This posture is the problem.

1767
01:04:14,031 --> 01:04:16,500
I'm pretending to be a master of reason.

1768
01:04:16,501 --> 01:04:19,670
Your reasoning is quite dull.

1769
01:04:19,671 --> 01:04:21,241
- It's blunt. - Right.

1770
01:04:22,101 --> 01:04:23,210
Like a stubby pencil.

1771
01:04:23,211 --> 01:04:24,570
None of them are sharp.

1772
01:04:24,571 --> 01:04:26,840
(The Blunt Siblings' reasoning is as dull as a stubby pencil.)

1773
01:04:26,841 --> 01:04:28,041
We're rounded out.

1774
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:30,180
He finally gets to drink the broth.

1775
01:04:30,181 --> 01:04:31,351
(By the way, Jae Seok finally gets to drink the broth.)

1776
01:04:32,311 --> 01:04:33,820
(Gosh)

1777
01:04:33,821 --> 01:04:35,221
(Goodness)

1778
01:04:35,421 --> 01:04:36,451
This feels like a hangover cure.

1779
01:04:37,121 --> 01:04:38,121
This is really...

1780
01:04:38,251 --> 01:04:39,960
I see radish on the bottom.

1781
01:04:39,961 --> 01:04:42,360
The freshness in the broth is from the radish.

1782
01:04:42,361 --> 01:04:43,560
Radish is great.

1783
01:04:43,561 --> 01:04:44,860
The longer you cook radish, the tastier it becomes.

1784
01:04:44,861 --> 01:04:46,730
If the broth is only made of beef,

1785
01:04:46,731 --> 01:04:48,660
you could get sick of it after a while.

1786
01:04:48,661 --> 01:04:50,331
But this broth is so fresh...

1787
01:04:50,831 --> 01:04:52,771
because there's so much radish inside.

1788
01:04:53,501 --> 01:04:54,740
Eating this after we ate the big-eyed herring sashimi...

1789
01:04:54,741 --> 01:04:56,441
makes the experience even better.

1790
01:04:57,311 --> 01:04:58,311
(Eun I is so cute.)

1791
01:04:58,312 --> 01:05:00,180
This course was perfect.

1792
01:05:00,181 --> 01:05:01,780
We even had sweet potato bread in between.

1793
01:05:01,781 --> 01:05:03,140
You're right.

1794
01:05:03,141 --> 01:05:04,651
- Everything was great about today. - Yes.

1795
01:05:05,111 --> 01:05:06,310
(Yum)

1796
01:05:06,311 --> 01:05:07,920
I need to stop eating, but I can't.

1797
01:05:07,921 --> 01:05:09,021
It's so good.

1798
01:05:09,551 --> 01:05:10,720
You're practically binge-eating today.

1799
01:05:10,721 --> 01:05:13,020
I think that was the fifth time you said that today.

1800
01:05:13,021 --> 01:05:14,621
- Hey, you... - But it's just so good.

1801
01:05:15,461 --> 01:05:16,761
This is so good!

1802
01:05:17,461 --> 01:05:20,001
(No matter how full he is, he can't say no to the huge dumpling soup.)

1803
01:05:20,061 --> 01:05:22,200
(He was eating nonstop until...)

1804
01:05:22,201 --> 01:05:23,770
(Looking to his right)

1805
01:05:23,771 --> 01:05:27,100
(Looking to his left)

1806
01:05:27,101 --> 01:05:29,300
Looking at the meat and other ingredients,

1807
01:05:29,301 --> 01:05:31,740
the price of the soup is too cheap.

1808
01:05:31,741 --> 01:05:33,480
- How much is it? - It's 25 dollars.

1809
01:05:33,481 --> 01:05:34,780
It's 25 dollars?

1810
01:05:34,781 --> 01:05:36,910
I feel like it should be more expensive.

1811
01:05:36,911 --> 01:05:38,410
A bowl of regular dumpling soup...

1812
01:05:38,411 --> 01:05:40,021
- costs about 12 dollars. - Right.

1813
01:05:40,321 --> 01:05:43,220
So this costs the same as two bowls of regular dumpling soup.

1814
01:05:43,221 --> 01:05:44,420
But this could feed about four people.

1815
01:05:44,421 --> 01:05:46,390
It's more than enough for four people.

1816
01:05:46,391 --> 01:05:47,520
It's more than enough.

1817
01:05:47,521 --> 01:05:49,960
They use so many ingredients that they probably don't make profits.

1818
01:05:49,961 --> 01:05:52,030
But that doesn't make sense because with this filling,

1819
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:54,330
we could make about 30 dumplings.

1820
01:05:54,331 --> 01:05:55,700
- The big ones. - That's right.

1821
01:05:55,701 --> 01:05:57,400
This is too cheap.

1822
01:05:57,401 --> 01:05:58,930
There's a reason why it's cheap.

1823
01:05:58,931 --> 01:06:00,570
- Where did she come from? - It's cheap for a reason.

1824
01:06:00,571 --> 01:06:03,100
- What is it? - When we didn't have customers,

1825
01:06:03,101 --> 01:06:05,370
we had to create a dish...

1826
01:06:05,371 --> 01:06:06,580
to draw them in.

1827
01:06:06,581 --> 01:06:08,240
You're saying it's a loss leader product.

1828
01:06:08,241 --> 01:06:09,510
That's right.

1829
01:06:09,511 --> 01:06:11,180
So people keep coming in.

1830
01:06:11,181 --> 01:06:13,750
That boosts our sales, and we make profits from that.

1831
01:06:13,751 --> 01:06:15,881
I see. That makes sense.

1832
01:06:22,491 --> 01:06:23,491
Wait a second.

1833
01:06:24,031 --> 01:06:25,791
A bowl of dumpling soup is ten dollars.

1834
01:06:29,031 --> 01:06:30,031
A bowl of dumpling soup is ten dollars...

1835
01:06:30,032 --> 01:06:31,471
and tteok dumpling soup is also ten dollars?

1836
01:06:32,401 --> 01:06:34,800
(That comment was such a letdown.)

1837
01:06:34,801 --> 01:06:36,000
Don't they usually cost a couple of dollars more?

1838
01:06:36,001 --> 01:06:37,740
If you're going to use that strange logic,

1839
01:06:37,741 --> 01:06:40,881
can you make your voice less sharp?

1840
01:06:41,781 --> 01:06:43,210
- It's because I'm blunt. - His voice...

1841
01:06:43,211 --> 01:06:45,480
- sounds as if he's... - Goodness.

1842
01:06:45,481 --> 01:06:46,620
He said, "Wait."

1843
01:06:46,621 --> 01:06:49,280
But look. The clam kalguksu is nine dollars.

1844
01:06:49,281 --> 01:06:50,490
- Yes. - But the clam dumpling kalguksu...

1845
01:06:50,491 --> 01:06:51,650
is ten dollars.

1846
01:06:51,651 --> 01:06:52,651
That makes sense.

1847
01:06:52,652 --> 01:06:53,760
A bowl of dumpling soup is ten dollars.

1848
01:06:53,761 --> 01:06:55,161
So how is a bowl of tteok dumpling soup also ten dollars?

1849
01:06:55,421 --> 01:06:57,060
- You're right. - What? That's true.

1850
01:06:57,061 --> 01:06:59,291
Why are dumpling kalguksu and kalguksu compatible...

1851
01:06:59,791 --> 01:07:01,631
- Exactly. - while those two don't?

1852
01:07:02,031 --> 01:07:04,831
- It sounds plausible, right? - Right.

1853
01:07:05,231 --> 01:07:06,470
I'm Detective Yunan today.

1854
01:07:06,471 --> 01:07:08,040
(My name is Detective Yunan, a Sixth Sense member.)

1855
01:07:08,041 --> 01:07:09,571
Lo-co. Locust is correct.

1856
01:07:10,911 --> 01:07:13,240
Come on. The price is...

1857
01:07:13,241 --> 01:07:15,110
- It has fewer dumplings. - The number is different.

1858
01:07:15,111 --> 01:07:16,651
It's because they have a different number of dumplings.

1859
01:07:17,711 --> 01:07:19,281
Why did the two get worked up suddenly?

1860
01:07:20,451 --> 01:07:22,081
You kept mentioning it.

1861
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:23,851
In my opinion...

1862
01:07:26,661 --> 01:07:28,190
Both of them have meat in them,

1863
01:07:28,191 --> 01:07:29,721
but meat dumplings are 7 dollars while duck dumplings are 8 dollars.

1864
01:07:30,061 --> 01:07:31,260
(Meat dumplings: 7 dollars versus duck dumplings 8 dollars)

1865
01:07:31,261 --> 01:07:34,400
Did the difference come from whether they fly or not?

1866
01:07:34,401 --> 01:07:36,131
- Mind the tone when you speak. - I mean.

1867
01:07:36,231 --> 01:07:38,201
He sounds like Kim Sang Joong,

1868
01:07:38,571 --> 01:07:39,871
- but what he says is... - Right.

1869
01:07:40,271 --> 01:07:41,701
They are really blunt, indeed.

1870
01:07:41,771 --> 01:07:42,901
Yes. That's right.

1871
01:07:44,541 --> 01:07:46,781
- We're blunt, aren't we? - I almost fell for it.

1872
01:07:47,241 --> 01:07:48,710
- I thought you were being sharp. - We're blunt right?

1873
01:07:48,711 --> 01:07:50,810
(Many are deceived by his tone.)

1874
01:07:50,811 --> 01:07:52,951
By the way, if the dumplings weren't tasty,

1875
01:07:53,851 --> 01:07:56,551
it wouldn't be this good, whether it's real or fake.

1876
01:07:56,851 --> 01:07:59,920
The way they spoke and got angry...

1877
01:07:59,921 --> 01:08:01,560
- makes them look so real. - Right.

1878
01:08:01,561 --> 01:08:03,530
And the pride about their career too.

1879
01:08:03,531 --> 01:08:04,761
- I see confidence in their eyes. - Yes.

1880
01:08:04,791 --> 01:08:08,460
What matters is whether a huge dumpling soup is on their menu.

1881
01:08:08,461 --> 01:08:10,201
(Does a huge dumpling soup actually exist?)

1882
01:08:10,231 --> 01:08:11,700
It seems so plausible.

1883
01:08:11,701 --> 01:08:13,330
- Right? There are no shady points. - Right.

1884
01:08:13,331 --> 01:08:14,341
(It's confusing because nothing seems suspicious.)

1885
01:08:15,541 --> 01:08:16,671
Wait a second.

1886
01:08:16,841 --> 01:08:19,171
Why don't we compare these dumplings with regular ones?

1887
01:08:19,271 --> 01:08:20,981
- That's nice. - That's possible.

1888
01:08:21,011 --> 01:08:22,340
- Hey. - Genius!

1889
01:08:22,341 --> 01:08:23,850
- I'm sharp, right? - Genius!

1890
01:08:23,851 --> 01:08:25,380
- Indeed. - That was very sharp.

1891
01:08:25,381 --> 01:08:26,881
- Exactly. - Let's get meat dumplings.

1892
01:08:27,151 --> 01:08:28,580
- Napa cabbage... - It's important...

1893
01:08:28,581 --> 01:08:29,980
to remove the foul smell of the meat when making meat dumplings.

1894
01:08:29,981 --> 01:08:31,051
You're right.

1895
01:08:32,121 --> 01:08:34,691
Gosh. They wouldn't have expected it.

1896
01:08:34,791 --> 01:08:36,830
- Are you so proud of yourself? - I feel great.

1897
01:08:36,831 --> 01:08:37,990
Compliment yourself.

1898
01:08:37,991 --> 01:08:38,991
Gosh. I feel good.

1899
01:08:38,992 --> 01:08:40,031
(Patting himself)

1900
01:08:40,531 --> 01:08:41,561
I feel good.

1901
01:08:42,261 --> 01:08:44,270
Then when we're making a call,

1902
01:08:44,271 --> 01:08:47,100
is it fake when the filling is the same or different?

1903
01:08:47,101 --> 01:08:48,471
(Thinking hard)

1904
01:08:48,571 --> 01:08:50,510
- When it's different? - It's fake when it's different.

1905
01:08:50,511 --> 01:08:51,771
(I see.)

1906
01:08:51,911 --> 01:08:53,011
That's right.

1907
01:08:53,041 --> 01:08:54,711
- All of you had the suspicion, - The amount...

1908
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:56,811
but you couldn't contextualize it.

1909
01:08:57,181 --> 01:08:58,480
(Laughing)

1910
01:08:58,481 --> 01:09:00,281
I was so confused when Kyoung Pyo said it.

1911
01:09:00,421 --> 01:09:03,490
I even think this won't be that meaningful.

1912
01:09:03,491 --> 01:09:05,451
What do you mean it's not meaningful?

1913
01:09:05,591 --> 01:09:08,320
After hearing what Kyoung Pyo said, I thought,

1914
01:09:08,321 --> 01:09:09,560
"Does it mean anything?"

1915
01:09:09,561 --> 01:09:10,691
(Detective Yunan's plan was poor as he is Bluntie too.)

1916
01:09:11,291 --> 01:09:12,331
- It's here. - Gosh. It's here.

1917
01:09:14,431 --> 01:09:17,601
(Will they find a big lead through the dumpling filling?)

1918
01:09:18,701 --> 01:09:21,000
The wrapper's color is similar.

1919
01:09:21,001 --> 01:09:22,370
No. It's totally different.

1920
01:09:22,371 --> 01:09:23,611
- Is it different? - Yes.

1921
01:09:24,611 --> 01:09:26,210
It's made in a different way.

1922
01:09:26,211 --> 01:09:28,481
How we make the filling is different too.

1923
01:09:28,611 --> 01:09:30,611
The filling is different? It's a problem, then.

1924
01:09:31,481 --> 01:09:34,321
(Their plan hits the fan even before they start it.)

1925
01:09:34,421 --> 01:09:36,421
What did we say? It's a fake if the filling is different, right?

1926
01:09:37,451 --> 01:09:39,150
We haven't decided it.

1927
01:09:39,151 --> 01:09:41,160
Didn't she already say that it has a different filling?

1928
01:09:41,161 --> 01:09:42,560
Yes. She already said it.

1929
01:09:42,561 --> 01:09:43,561
She revealed the filling already.

1930
01:09:43,562 --> 01:09:45,261
(It's already revealed.)

1931
01:09:45,891 --> 01:09:50,101
(What is the difference between the two dumplings?)

1932
01:09:51,531 --> 01:09:55,571
(How will the meat dumplings, with different filling, taste?)

1933
01:09:55,771 --> 01:09:57,341
It tastes... It smells similar.

1934
01:09:58,541 --> 01:10:01,110
- Should I dip it in the soup? - Really?

1935
01:10:01,111 --> 01:10:03,211
- Isn't it the same as this, then? - Isn't it this one, then?

1936
01:10:04,181 --> 01:10:05,311
What are you doing?

1937
01:10:05,481 --> 01:10:07,181
Was it a trick to have another spoonful?

1938
01:10:07,881 --> 01:10:09,151
Don't call it a trick.

1939
01:10:13,691 --> 01:10:15,561
- It tastes totally different. - It's totally different.

1940
01:10:15,821 --> 01:10:17,090
- This one is a chive dumpling. - Yes.

1941
01:10:17,091 --> 01:10:18,761
- It has lots of chives in it. - That's right.

1942
01:10:18,861 --> 01:10:19,990
- It's tasty. - It's good.

1943
01:10:19,991 --> 01:10:21,460
- It's light and simple... - Yes.

1944
01:10:21,461 --> 01:10:24,101
- because of the chives. - It's a good dumpling place...

1945
01:10:24,431 --> 01:10:26,871
- Yes. - that uses a light filling.

1946
01:10:27,241 --> 01:10:28,501
But this huge dumpling soup....

1947
01:10:28,741 --> 01:10:29,970
It tastes so different, though.

1948
01:10:29,971 --> 01:10:31,210
- It's very different. - The two are different things.

1949
01:10:31,211 --> 01:10:32,640
- They're totally different. - Yes.

1950
01:10:32,641 --> 01:10:33,980
- Are they totally different? - Yes, they are.

1951
01:10:33,981 --> 01:10:35,211
Yes. Can't you tell?

1952
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:36,481
It tastes similar.

1953
01:10:36,681 --> 01:10:37,950
- Do you know why? - Why?

1954
01:10:37,951 --> 01:10:39,381
You ate it with the soup.

1955
01:10:40,051 --> 01:10:41,351
It's because you had it with the soup.

1956
01:10:43,051 --> 01:10:45,190
We've just become the people who ordered two dishes.

1957
01:10:45,191 --> 01:10:46,221
You're right.

1958
01:10:46,991 --> 01:10:49,421
We are the ones who ordered two menus now.

1959
01:10:49,861 --> 01:10:51,261
I have no idea.

1960
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:52,961
We should have ordered a regular dumpling soup.

1961
01:10:53,761 --> 01:10:54,860
We have one more place to go.

1962
01:10:54,861 --> 01:10:55,931
(Big and tasty, but unprofitable, has a different filling)

1963
01:10:57,931 --> 01:10:59,470
(The members head to the third trendy place,)

1964
01:10:59,471 --> 01:11:00,971
(the Super Fascinating.)

1965
01:11:01,571 --> 01:11:04,541
What will they have that will be fascinating?

1966
01:11:05,611 --> 01:11:06,941
- Exactly - What will it be?

1967
01:11:07,311 --> 01:11:08,781
Something that's Super Fascinating.

1968
01:11:08,911 --> 01:11:11,311
Kyoung Pyo is... Good night.

1969
01:11:11,551 --> 01:11:13,110
- Kyoung Pyo, take a nap. - No.

1970
01:11:13,111 --> 01:11:14,581
- Get some sleep. - It's okay.

1971
01:11:14,981 --> 01:11:16,181
I dozed off a bit.

1972
01:11:16,681 --> 01:11:17,921
- Doze off. - But...

1973
01:11:18,421 --> 01:11:20,320
- He's so intuitive. - He's really...

1974
01:11:20,321 --> 01:11:21,921
He's really cool.

1975
01:11:22,061 --> 01:11:23,790
- He's cool, right? - Do you think he's cool?

1976
01:11:23,791 --> 01:11:26,560
- He's a famous actor. - Yes.

1977
01:11:26,561 --> 01:11:29,030
- He's a very experienced actor. - No.

1978
01:11:29,031 --> 01:11:30,970
He's beyond easygoing.

1979
01:11:30,971 --> 01:11:32,830
- He's not pretentious. - He's liberated.

1980
01:11:32,831 --> 01:11:34,300
(It's cool how he doesn't mind what others think of him.)

1981
01:11:34,301 --> 01:11:35,740
Even though you are sleepy,

1982
01:11:35,741 --> 01:11:37,970
- you don't sleep for many reasons. - That's true.

1983
01:11:37,971 --> 01:11:40,481
Your face might look puffy, for example.

1984
01:11:40,781 --> 01:11:41,811
But it's not the case for Kyoung Pyo.

1985
01:11:42,211 --> 01:11:43,211
(Laughing)
He's cool.

1986
01:11:45,651 --> 01:11:47,550
- Kyoung Pyo, go ahead. - He's perfect for a variety show.

1987
01:11:47,551 --> 01:11:48,620
(That's the charm of Kyoung Pyo.)

1988
01:11:48,621 --> 01:11:49,781
We love it.

1989
01:11:50,291 --> 01:11:51,451
Gosh. It's...

1990
01:11:51,521 --> 01:11:55,720
With the sunlight above my head, it's warm.

1991
01:11:55,721 --> 01:11:56,861
It's perfect.

1992
01:11:57,791 --> 01:11:59,030
I can't stay awake.

1993
01:11:59,031 --> 01:12:01,760
(He feels hazy because of the warm sunlight.)

1994
01:12:01,761 --> 01:12:03,670
One's stomach should be empty...

1995
01:12:03,671 --> 01:12:05,171
to think more sharply.

1996
01:12:05,671 --> 01:12:07,871
The blunt ones are gathered here.

1997
01:12:08,101 --> 01:12:09,571
And they feed us well.

1998
01:12:10,001 --> 01:12:11,610
- We can't think. - No.

1999
01:12:11,611 --> 01:12:14,681
- It becomes vague. - We've become less sharp.

2000
01:12:15,041 --> 01:12:17,311
- We've become positive. - I can't think of anything.

2001
01:12:17,411 --> 01:12:19,250
- It's true. I have no thoughts. - This season has a good strategy.

2002
01:12:19,251 --> 01:12:20,451
- You're right. - Yes.

2003
01:12:21,451 --> 01:12:22,980
Gosh. It's hard.

2004
01:12:22,981 --> 01:12:24,321
It's hard every week,

2005
01:12:24,391 --> 01:12:25,820
but we really have to get it right today.

2006
01:12:25,821 --> 01:12:26,821
(We can't lose 5 consecutive times!)

2007
01:12:26,822 --> 01:12:28,991
What will be the third place, the Super Fast?

2008
01:12:29,721 --> 01:12:31,130
- No. - It's Super Fascinating.

2009
01:12:31,131 --> 01:12:32,760
- Right. It's Super Fascinating. - Super Fascinating.

2010
01:12:32,761 --> 01:12:34,101
- Kyoung Pyo, think straight. - Gosh. I need to sleep.

2011
01:12:34,501 --> 01:12:35,931
We've already visited the Super Fast.

2012
01:12:36,001 --> 01:12:37,970
(The big-eyed herring place)

2013
01:12:37,971 --> 01:12:39,901
We are the Super Blunt.

2014
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:42,770
(He's the most blunt one today.)

2015
01:12:42,771 --> 01:12:43,841
Seriously.

2016
01:12:44,411 --> 01:12:47,341
Gosh. I really thought the first place was fake.

2017
01:12:47,411 --> 01:12:50,141
- Right? It keeps going like that. - The second place seemed fake too.

2018
01:12:50,551 --> 01:12:52,551
In a way, the second place...

2019
01:12:52,651 --> 01:12:55,880
If they get paid 25 dollars for the dumpling soup...

2020
01:12:55,881 --> 01:12:57,620
Right. They wouldn't get the high customer turnover ratio.

2021
01:12:57,621 --> 01:12:58,890
No, they wouldn't.

2022
01:12:58,891 --> 01:13:01,461
People would sit for a longer time because they boil it at the table.

2023
01:13:01,521 --> 01:13:03,760
The owners said it was made to lure the customers.

2024
01:13:03,761 --> 01:13:05,661
That makes sense, though, right?

2025
01:13:05,761 --> 01:13:08,330
- Right. They had different menus. - Not everyone comes to eat that.

2026
01:13:08,331 --> 01:13:09,461
- That's right. - Yes.

2027
01:13:10,001 --> 01:13:12,300
(It's so hard.)

2028
01:13:12,301 --> 01:13:13,531
Anyway, it tasted good.

2029
01:13:13,571 --> 01:13:14,970
- It was really good. - It was good.

2030
01:13:14,971 --> 01:13:16,040
I enjoyed it very much.

2031
01:13:16,041 --> 01:13:18,671
(The conclusion from the blunt reasoning: It was tasty.)

2032
01:13:19,211 --> 01:13:21,741
Magic. The Super Fascinating.

2033
01:13:21,881 --> 01:13:23,880
It might be related to magic.

2034
01:13:23,881 --> 01:13:25,911
- Magic? - It's not a tarot reading, right?

2035
01:13:26,311 --> 01:13:27,320
A tarot cafe?

2036
01:13:27,321 --> 01:13:29,081
- That sounds fun. - Yes.

2037
01:13:29,281 --> 01:13:31,150
Was it back when I was 25?

2038
01:13:31,151 --> 01:13:34,490
An old man at Pagoda Park read fortunes.

2039
01:13:34,491 --> 01:13:36,261
I went there, thinking it'd be fun.

2040
01:13:36,621 --> 01:13:38,661
He said I'd have a son when I'm 26 years old.

2041
01:13:39,361 --> 01:13:40,430
He didn't even say "marriage."

2042
01:13:40,431 --> 01:13:42,430
(It's a personal shamanic opinion.)

2043
01:13:42,431 --> 01:13:44,931
I've passed 36 years old and 46 years old.

2044
01:13:45,171 --> 01:13:46,431
Up until now,

2045
01:13:47,201 --> 01:13:49,441
I don't know where my son is.

2046
01:13:49,901 --> 01:13:51,110
He said...

2047
01:13:51,111 --> 01:13:53,311
There must be something you don't know about.

2048
01:13:53,941 --> 01:13:54,941
I've been telling you all the time.

2049
01:13:55,641 --> 01:13:57,810
They say, "There's something you don't know about."

2050
01:13:57,811 --> 01:14:00,211
I asked him, "Pardon?"

2051
01:14:00,311 --> 01:14:02,451
He was 100 percent wrong.

2052
01:14:03,321 --> 01:14:05,120
He was totally wrong.

2053
01:14:05,121 --> 01:14:06,650
- We're here. - We're here.

2054
01:14:06,651 --> 01:14:08,721
- It's a residential area, though. - Are we here?

2055
01:14:08,791 --> 01:14:09,890
Let's get out of the van.

2056
01:14:09,891 --> 01:14:11,790
- Be careful. - Okay. Thank you.

2057
01:14:11,791 --> 01:14:12,991
(What is the super fascinating one they'll see here?)

2058
01:14:13,361 --> 01:14:14,901
There's nothing much around here.

2059
01:14:15,461 --> 01:14:17,670
It feels like we're walking along the stores...

2060
01:14:17,671 --> 01:14:19,371
- in an apartment complex. - Yes.

2061
01:14:19,471 --> 01:14:20,871
It doesn't feel like a trendy place.

2062
01:14:21,541 --> 01:14:23,041
It should be "Super Fascinating."

2063
01:14:24,011 --> 01:14:25,870
What's super fascinating here?

2064
01:14:25,871 --> 01:14:27,280
- What's super fascinating here? - Exactly.

2065
01:14:27,281 --> 01:14:28,511
(What kind of trendy place exists in a quiet residential area?)

2066
01:14:28,911 --> 01:14:30,080
Don't you love how it feels...

2067
01:14:30,081 --> 01:14:31,210
- when you step on the snow? - Yes.

2068
01:14:31,211 --> 01:14:32,211
Gosh. Snow.

2069
01:14:32,251 --> 01:14:33,251
- I love the sound too. - Yes.

2070
01:14:33,252 --> 01:14:35,020
(They don't know where they're going but the snowed road feels good.)

2071
01:14:35,021 --> 01:14:36,981
I love how it snowed in March.

2072
01:14:37,051 --> 01:14:38,791
I know. It's March.

2073
01:14:39,421 --> 01:14:40,821
Are you pretending as if it's March now...

2074
01:14:40,991 --> 01:14:42,391
- when it snowed this much? - I'm pretending.

2075
01:14:43,261 --> 01:14:44,730
I love the last cold snap.

2076
01:14:44,731 --> 01:14:45,761
(For Mimi, it's the last cold snap of spring.)

2077
01:14:45,831 --> 01:14:47,601
- Where would it be? - Where is it?

2078
01:14:47,961 --> 01:14:49,761
What? I think we're here.

2079
01:14:50,871 --> 01:14:53,001
- A jokbal place? - Jokbal?

2080
01:14:54,241 --> 01:14:56,770
(An ordinary jokbal restaurant at the end of the alleyway)

2081
01:14:56,771 --> 01:14:58,170
It's the main store of the jokbal franchise.

2082
01:14:58,171 --> 01:14:59,210
(An ordinary jokbal restaurant at the end of the alleyway)

2083
01:14:59,211 --> 01:15:01,311
It was established in 2015.

2084
01:15:02,281 --> 01:15:05,111
(It doesn't look special from the outside.)

2085
01:15:05,481 --> 01:15:07,421
What's so fascinating about this?

2086
01:15:07,451 --> 01:15:09,651
It's a place where they sell jokbal made with oriental herbs.

2087
01:15:11,921 --> 01:15:13,221
I can smell jokbal.

2088
01:15:14,621 --> 01:15:17,231
What can be fascinating about a jokbal place?

2089
01:15:18,061 --> 01:15:19,830
Hello.

2090
01:15:19,831 --> 01:15:21,031
(They enter the place while feeling suspicious.)

2091
01:15:21,601 --> 01:15:23,831
(Incheon's third trendy place, the Super Fascinating)

2092
01:15:26,301 --> 01:15:29,071
(It's a perfect place to eat comfortably with a friend.)

2093
01:15:29,401 --> 01:15:32,011
(A restaurant that feels warm)

2094
01:15:32,311 --> 01:15:34,511
They must have sold jokbal for a long time.

2095
01:15:35,111 --> 01:15:36,441
They say it's a great place to eat in Cheongna.

2096
01:15:36,481 --> 01:15:38,981
- Near Seo-gu Office in Cheongna. - Right. We're in Cheongna, then.

2097
01:15:39,381 --> 01:15:41,581
(Welcome to a great place to eat in Cheongna.)

2098
01:15:41,921 --> 01:15:44,320
Can there be a fascinating menu?

2099
01:15:44,321 --> 01:15:46,021
I don't see anything special on the menu.

2100
01:15:46,651 --> 01:15:47,821
Fried jokbal?

2101
01:15:48,461 --> 01:15:49,461
(The signature fried jokbal)
(It's the most unique menu item they can find.)

2102
01:15:50,591 --> 01:15:52,061
Do they deep fry jokbal...

2103
01:15:52,261 --> 01:15:53,430
- if it's fried jokbal? - Fried jokbal?

2104
01:15:53,431 --> 01:15:56,301
- Will they put on a fire show? - What is this?

2105
01:15:56,361 --> 01:15:58,230
- Gosh. Hello. - Hello.

2106
01:15:58,231 --> 01:15:59,800
- Please come this way. Yes. - Okay.

2107
01:15:59,801 --> 01:16:02,570
- Sir, it's a jokbal place. - Yes.

2108
01:16:02,571 --> 01:16:04,370
What kind of jokbal is it that it's so fascinating?

2109
01:16:04,371 --> 01:16:07,710
We have our signature fried jokbal.

2110
01:16:07,711 --> 01:16:08,910
It's fried jokbal...

2111
01:16:08,911 --> 01:16:10,110
- with shishito pepper. - I see.

2112
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:11,111
What is that?

2113
01:16:11,112 --> 01:16:13,510
We launched a new menu last January.

2114
01:16:13,511 --> 01:16:14,851
It's spicy lobster jokbal.

2115
01:16:15,121 --> 01:16:18,391
We also have squid ink and basil fried bossam.

2116
01:16:18,551 --> 01:16:20,661
Squid ink and basil fried bossam?

2117
01:16:21,591 --> 01:16:23,390
- It's even hard to pronounce it. - Yes.

2118
01:16:23,391 --> 01:16:25,390
- Squid ink and fried basil... - Squid ink and fried basil...

2119
01:16:25,391 --> 01:16:27,701
- Squid ink bossam and fried basil? - Squid ink and fried basil bossam?

2120
01:16:28,231 --> 01:16:30,230
Basil fried bossam with squid ink...

2121
01:16:30,231 --> 01:16:31,730
(They're calling it as they like.)

2122
01:16:31,731 --> 01:16:34,441
Are the ones you just mentioned popular menus?

2123
01:16:34,571 --> 01:16:36,540
- Yes. - They are new dishes.

2124
01:16:36,541 --> 01:16:37,541
New dishes?

2125
01:16:37,542 --> 01:16:38,640
(They have 3 popular dishes.)

2126
01:16:38,641 --> 01:16:41,411
(What is the true identity of this place?)

2127
01:16:45,611 --> 01:16:47,480
Our place is considered 1 of the 3 best jokbal places...

2128
01:16:47,481 --> 01:16:49,381
in Incheon.

2129
01:16:50,151 --> 01:16:53,350
We sell about 120 pieces a day.

2130
01:16:53,351 --> 01:16:54,790
(They boil 120 pig feet every day.)

2131
01:16:54,791 --> 01:16:56,190
(All 120 pieces...)

2132
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:57,591
(get sold out in a day.)

2133
01:16:58,691 --> 01:17:00,531
(As soon as it opens, it gets filled with people.)

2134
01:17:00,961 --> 01:17:03,761
About 30 groups come on a weekday.

2135
01:17:04,201 --> 01:17:06,531
We make about 80 or 90 deliveries a day.

2136
01:17:07,201 --> 01:17:08,340
(It's already famous...)

2137
01:17:08,341 --> 01:17:09,471
(as Incheon's trendy place on social media.)

2138
01:17:10,441 --> 01:17:13,071
(The signature dish of the place that dominated Incheon with jokbal)

2139
01:17:13,711 --> 01:17:14,980
(They fry jokbal?)

2140
01:17:14,981 --> 01:17:17,980
Our most popular dish is fried jokbal.

2141
01:17:17,981 --> 01:17:20,111
(Fried jokbal is the leader in the sales board.)

2142
01:17:20,411 --> 01:17:21,951
(And the 2 new menu items)

2143
01:17:22,381 --> 01:17:23,450
(Jokbal meets a lobster.)

2144
01:17:23,451 --> 01:17:25,790
We've launched new spicy lobster jokbal...

2145
01:17:25,791 --> 01:17:28,220
and a new menu with unusual ingredients.

2146
01:17:28,221 --> 01:17:29,390
They are received very well.

2147
01:17:29,391 --> 01:17:30,831
(Basi? Squid ink? Fried bossam with unusual ingredients)

2148
01:17:31,091 --> 01:17:35,061
(A set of 3 Super Fascinating menus are coming soon.)

2149
01:17:35,501 --> 01:17:37,231
When did you start selling them?

2150
01:17:37,571 --> 01:17:39,601
We've been selling them since January.

2151
01:17:39,971 --> 01:17:41,970
- It's suspicious if it's January. - January? That means...

2152
01:17:41,971 --> 01:17:45,041
- It's the perfect time to prepare. - It sounds perfect for Sixth Sense.

2153
01:17:45,241 --> 01:17:46,540
Last time, they also said they started the pop-up store...

2154
01:17:46,541 --> 01:17:47,841
- in January. - We're just...

2155
01:17:48,441 --> 01:17:51,280
- Sir, that's a photo of you, right? - Yes.

2156
01:17:51,281 --> 01:17:53,910
- That's right. - I was 27 years old back then.

2157
01:17:53,911 --> 01:17:55,421
It's been ten years.

2158
01:17:55,651 --> 01:17:57,121
- You're 37. - Yes. I'm 37.

2159
01:17:57,291 --> 01:17:59,720
But why did you choose to sell jokbal of all things?

2160
01:17:59,721 --> 01:18:02,290
I used to be a computer instructor.

2161
01:18:02,291 --> 01:18:03,361
- I see. - Okay.

2162
01:18:03,621 --> 01:18:05,530
I went to this jokbal place and had jokbal.

2163
01:18:05,531 --> 01:18:07,230
When I had that first warm bite,

2164
01:18:07,231 --> 01:18:09,531
I thought it'd turn my whole life upside down.

2165
01:18:10,061 --> 01:18:11,501
I started working as their trainee.

2166
01:18:12,001 --> 01:18:14,340
Their monthly salary was 1,800 dollars.

2167
01:18:14,341 --> 01:18:15,570
But I told them I'd only get 1,500 dollars.

2168
01:18:15,571 --> 01:18:16,800
I saved 1,000 dollars a month.

2169
01:18:16,801 --> 01:18:20,241
I saved 24,000 dollars after 2 years and opened a small restaurant.

2170
01:18:20,611 --> 01:18:21,910
This is my third restaurant.

2171
01:18:21,911 --> 01:18:23,810
- We've moved to a bigger place. - Really?

2172
01:18:23,811 --> 01:18:25,680
- What a story. - It's real.

2173
01:18:25,681 --> 01:18:27,550
It sounds so real. It's so real.

2174
01:18:27,551 --> 01:18:30,151
- That's amazing. - Really?

2175
01:18:30,251 --> 01:18:32,891
Why did you ask to get 1,500 dollars when it was 1,800 dollars?

2176
01:18:34,421 --> 01:18:37,390
- You didn't have to do that. - Is that what you find suspicious?

2177
01:18:37,391 --> 01:18:38,661
You didn't have to do that.

2178
01:18:38,991 --> 01:18:42,130
I really wanted to work there. They didn't recruit anyone.

2179
01:18:42,131 --> 01:18:44,631
- They didn't recruit anyone. - You showed your sincerity.

2180
01:18:44,701 --> 01:18:47,001
- I was desperate. - You wanted to work there badly.

2181
01:18:47,271 --> 01:18:49,200
Which dish should we order?

2182
01:18:49,201 --> 01:18:51,640
First, it's the fried jokbal, our signature menu.

2183
01:18:51,641 --> 01:18:54,080
- Yes. - Fried jokbal with shishito pepper.

2184
01:18:54,081 --> 01:18:55,981
- Shall we take a look? - Yes. Please get us that one.

2185
01:18:56,341 --> 01:18:58,810
- I've heard of fried jokbal. - I've heard it too.

2186
01:18:58,811 --> 01:19:00,820
- Fried jokbal is... - I've never heard of it.

2187
01:19:00,821 --> 01:19:01,880
Does it exist?

2188
01:19:01,881 --> 01:19:03,120
- I've never heard of it. - Does it exist?

2189
01:19:03,121 --> 01:19:05,020
- I think I've had it before. - You've had it before?

2190
01:19:05,021 --> 01:19:06,421
Isn't it the one with the fried skin?

2191
01:19:07,621 --> 01:19:08,721
Fried jokbal?

2192
01:19:09,761 --> 01:19:11,631
(Staring)

2193
01:19:12,031 --> 01:19:13,431
You have no idea because you just got up, right?

2194
01:19:14,861 --> 01:19:16,731
Come on. You're acting as if you're thinking.

2195
01:19:17,061 --> 01:19:18,930
- You pretended... - Gosh. Seriously.

2196
01:19:18,931 --> 01:19:21,440
- You were trying to wake up. - I was so surprised.

2197
01:19:21,441 --> 01:19:23,640
- Gosh. I was thinking of nothing. - Gosh.

2198
01:19:23,641 --> 01:19:25,071
It's rare that you get a good hunch.

2199
01:19:25,171 --> 01:19:27,071
He was lying backward like Michelin Man.

2200
01:19:28,681 --> 01:19:29,880
Now, I'm totally awake.

2201
01:19:29,881 --> 01:19:31,110
(Jae Seok's comment totally woke him up.)

2202
01:19:31,111 --> 01:19:33,911
Yoon Kyung keeps saying Kyoung Pyo is cool.

2203
01:19:34,151 --> 01:19:36,320
- "He's cool." - He's cool.

2204
01:19:36,321 --> 01:19:37,321
- "He's cool." - Thanks.

2205
01:19:37,322 --> 01:19:39,320
- He's a true actor. - Right.

2206
01:19:39,321 --> 01:19:41,391
- Yes. He's a true top actor. - Yes.

2207
01:19:42,961 --> 01:19:44,460
Is this a cosplay of Chow Yun Fat?

2208
01:19:44,461 --> 01:19:46,061
(Laughing)

2209
01:19:46,231 --> 01:19:48,800
Chow Yun Fat or Keanu Reeves in America.

2210
01:19:48,801 --> 01:19:49,801
Keanu Reeves!

2211
01:19:50,001 --> 01:19:52,401
You're like Keanu Reeves.

2212
01:19:52,801 --> 01:19:56,501
(In Hollywood, Keanu Reeves is known for his free-spiritedness.)

2213
01:19:57,201 --> 01:20:00,171
(Kyoung Pyo is as free-spirited as Keanu Reeves.)

2214
01:20:00,341 --> 01:20:02,140
Kyoung Pyo does resemble Keanu Reeves a bit.

2215
01:20:02,141 --> 01:20:03,980
- He does. - It's because I have a long face.

2216
01:20:03,981 --> 01:20:05,211
You resemble him.

2217
01:20:05,611 --> 01:20:06,851
- He's my role model. - How he looks...

2218
01:20:07,581 --> 01:20:09,051
"Role model." Gosh.

2219
01:20:09,321 --> 01:20:10,420
I want to walk around...

2220
01:20:10,421 --> 01:20:11,490
- in my flip-flops too. - Ki Young...

2221
01:20:11,491 --> 01:20:13,151
Ki Young is right next to her.

2222
01:20:13,521 --> 01:20:14,720
He's too well-dressed.

2223
01:20:14,721 --> 01:20:15,920
- He dresses up so much. - He's such a celebrity.

2224
01:20:15,921 --> 01:20:18,331
- He dresses up so much. - He dresses up so much. Gosh.

2225
01:20:18,561 --> 01:20:20,591
He dresses up when there's nothing.

2226
01:20:22,261 --> 01:20:23,900
I don't get the TPO.

2227
01:20:23,901 --> 01:20:24,970
(He admits it.)

2228
01:20:24,971 --> 01:20:26,200
That's right, Ki Young.

2229
01:20:26,201 --> 01:20:28,241
- You should dress down. - Okay.

2230
01:20:28,601 --> 01:20:31,140
- "You should dress down." - You are too dressed up.

2231
01:20:31,141 --> 01:20:33,241
- She asked him to dress down. - "Dress down."

2232
01:20:33,511 --> 01:20:35,341
Dress down like him. Okay?

2233
01:20:36,241 --> 01:20:37,280
Kyoung Pyo is so funny.

2234
01:20:37,281 --> 01:20:39,011
Fried jokkal... I called it "jokkal."

2235
01:20:41,421 --> 01:20:42,421
Hey.

2236
01:20:43,651 --> 01:20:45,651
"Jokbal." I've never heard of fried jokbal.

2237
01:20:46,121 --> 01:20:47,191
Why do you fry jokbal?

2238
01:20:47,961 --> 01:20:49,461
Its chewiness will disappear.

2239
01:20:49,721 --> 01:20:51,160
- Will it? - You have jokbal...

2240
01:20:51,161 --> 01:20:52,830
to enjoy the chewiness of the outer skin.

2241
01:20:52,831 --> 01:20:54,090
It becomes tender inside...

2242
01:20:54,091 --> 01:20:55,500
- and crispy outside. - Right.

2243
01:20:55,501 --> 01:20:57,771
The inside might become chewier.

2244
01:20:57,871 --> 01:20:58,871
- I see. - Tender inside, crispy outside.

2245
01:20:59,901 --> 01:21:03,071
(To respond to their questions,)

2246
01:21:03,441 --> 01:21:05,371
(here comes the jokbal.)

2247
01:21:06,341 --> 01:21:08,381
- Gosh. Something is here. - Gosh. It's big.

2248
01:21:09,581 --> 01:21:11,981
(Amazed)

2249
01:21:12,411 --> 01:21:13,411
It's jokbal.

2250
01:21:15,281 --> 01:21:17,551
It's fried jokbal, a popular menu at our place.

2251
01:21:18,691 --> 01:21:20,050
I went to Japan once.

2252
01:21:20,051 --> 01:21:21,560
Their pork cutlet is known to be crunchy, right?

2253
01:21:21,561 --> 01:21:23,461
(Inspired by the crunchy pork cutlet)

2254
01:21:23,661 --> 01:21:25,890
I was inspired by that and thought of frying jokbal...

2255
01:21:25,891 --> 01:21:27,531
after covering it with bread crumbs.

2256
01:21:29,361 --> 01:21:31,631
(The process of making fried jokbal)

2257
01:21:32,131 --> 01:21:33,931
I poke the pork shoulder once.

2258
01:21:34,741 --> 01:21:36,371
It's to absorb the broth.

2259
01:21:36,501 --> 01:21:38,841
It becomes tastier when I boil it after poking it.

2260
01:21:39,741 --> 01:21:41,410
(After boiling it for 1 hour until the meat comes off easily...)

2261
01:21:41,411 --> 01:21:44,140
After boiling it for an hour, it's ready.

2262
01:21:44,141 --> 01:21:45,881
(Tender jokbal is complete!)

2263
01:21:46,981 --> 01:21:48,920
I let it cool down for a while.

2264
01:21:48,921 --> 01:21:49,951
(Making it chewier while removing the foul smell)

2265
01:21:50,281 --> 01:21:53,321
I put starch and bread crumbs on it to fry it.

2266
01:21:54,191 --> 01:21:56,420
(Adding jokbal in batter...)

2267
01:21:56,421 --> 01:21:58,530
(into oil)

2268
01:21:58,531 --> 01:22:01,860
I fry it for 15 minutes and let it cool down.

2269
01:22:01,861 --> 01:22:03,931
(Frying it for the 1st time to get a golden color and shape)

2270
01:22:04,431 --> 01:22:05,470
(When fried for the 2nd time,)

2271
01:22:05,471 --> 01:22:06,870
I fry it for the second time...

2272
01:22:06,871 --> 01:22:08,870
to increase its crispy texture.

2273
01:22:08,871 --> 01:22:10,371
(it becomes crispier as its oiliness is reduced.)

2274
01:22:11,841 --> 01:22:15,511
(This the secret of this place to increase its texture.)

2275
01:22:17,081 --> 01:22:19,411
(The image of a big pile)

2276
01:22:20,151 --> 01:22:22,480
I make it spicy with fried shishito pepper.

2277
01:22:22,481 --> 01:22:23,651
(The shishito pepper makes it less greasy.)

2278
01:22:24,591 --> 01:22:26,651
(A crispy batter...)

2279
01:22:27,621 --> 01:22:29,621
(and the tender meat inside of it)

2280
01:22:30,321 --> 01:22:32,160
This is the menu that contributes the most...

2281
01:22:32,161 --> 01:22:34,131
to our 100,000-dollar monthly sales.

2282
01:22:35,431 --> 01:22:39,071
(Signature menu, fried jokbal)

2283
01:22:39,231 --> 01:22:42,240
This is our signature menu, fried jokbal.

2284
01:22:42,241 --> 01:22:44,340
Gosh. It's visually amazing.

2285
01:22:44,341 --> 01:22:45,341
(Everyone is excited even before trying it.)

2286
01:22:45,342 --> 01:22:47,040
Visually, it looks so tasty.

2287
01:22:47,041 --> 01:22:48,110
(Everyone is excited even before trying it.)

2288
01:22:48,111 --> 01:22:50,910
I didn't think you'd fry it like a pork cutlet.

2289
01:22:50,911 --> 01:22:51,981
Exactly.

2290
01:22:54,451 --> 01:22:55,481
(Crunchy)

2291
01:22:57,081 --> 01:22:58,391
(Amazed)

2292
01:22:59,021 --> 01:23:01,391
(Yoon Kyung takes a bite with excitement.)

2293
01:23:01,661 --> 01:23:03,820
- Gosh. - He fried it like a pork cutlet.

2294
01:23:03,821 --> 01:23:04,891
It's like a pork cutlet.

2295
01:23:07,361 --> 01:23:09,901
(Eye-opening)

2296
01:23:10,661 --> 01:23:11,731
It's good.

2297
01:23:12,071 --> 01:23:15,240
It feels like a pork cutlet with unprocessed meat.

2298
01:23:15,241 --> 01:23:17,500
- You're right. - The meat is not grounded.

2299
01:23:17,501 --> 01:23:19,810
It's a pork cutlet with a hint of jokbal's smell.

2300
01:23:19,811 --> 01:23:21,241
(Adding a spoonful of jokbal's scent to a pork cutlet's texture)

2301
01:23:21,381 --> 01:23:23,880
Even the ones who don't like jokbal will enjoy it.

2302
01:23:23,881 --> 01:23:25,411
(Even jokbal haters will go crazy about this fantastic taste.)

2303
01:23:25,681 --> 01:23:28,050
- Everyone would like it. - It's good.

2304
01:23:28,051 --> 01:23:29,251
- It's so tasty. - Yes.

2305
01:23:29,481 --> 01:23:31,390
I think it must be selling well...

2306
01:23:31,391 --> 01:23:33,121
- Yes. It'd be popular. - if it's this good.

2307
01:23:33,521 --> 01:23:34,591
The peppers are tasty too.

2308
01:23:35,021 --> 01:23:36,421
(He takes a bite after what Mimi said.)

2309
01:23:37,391 --> 01:23:38,491
It's so good.

2310
01:23:39,231 --> 01:23:41,730
- He added shishito peppers. - Gosh. That's...

2311
01:23:41,731 --> 01:23:44,061
- The shishito pepper is tasty. - It's a great idea.

2312
01:23:44,301 --> 01:23:46,400
- He deliberately added spiciness. - Yes.

2313
01:23:46,401 --> 01:23:47,941
It makes the dish feel less oily.

2314
01:23:48,841 --> 01:23:50,541
This is on the menu for sure.

2315
01:23:51,041 --> 01:23:52,870
Yes. I wish it's really on the menu.

2316
01:23:52,871 --> 01:23:54,780
I think it's on the menu and it's, in fact, popular.

2317
01:23:54,781 --> 01:23:56,581
- Yes. It must be popular. - If it's this good.

2318
01:23:57,511 --> 01:23:59,781
Gosh. Honestly, I thought I wouldn't eat so much.

2319
01:24:00,651 --> 01:24:01,821
- But it keeps going in. - Yes.

2320
01:24:01,921 --> 01:24:03,820
Like I always said, when we arrive at the third place,

2321
01:24:03,821 --> 01:24:04,951
- we get full. - Yes.

2322
01:24:05,051 --> 01:24:06,390
If we can eat it,

2323
01:24:06,391 --> 01:24:07,690
- it means it's so good. - That's right.

2324
01:24:07,691 --> 01:24:09,221
(It tastes so good when he's full.)

2325
01:24:09,961 --> 01:24:12,260
(Is the fried jokbal, the fantastic flavor...)

2326
01:24:12,261 --> 01:24:14,601
(that has captivated the Sixth Sense members, real?)

2327
01:24:15,301 --> 01:24:17,670
- It's here. - Fried pork leg.

2328
01:24:17,671 --> 01:24:18,731
I was shocked.

2329
01:24:19,071 --> 01:24:20,071
- Now, that's... - What's that?

2330
01:24:20,072 --> 01:24:21,201
- Visually... - It's...

2331
01:24:21,301 --> 01:24:23,771
fried bossam, covered with squid ink and bread crumbs.

2332
01:24:24,301 --> 01:24:25,371
Bossam.

2333
01:24:26,011 --> 01:24:28,181
(It's bossam this time.)

2334
01:24:28,311 --> 01:24:29,580
(In fact,)

2335
01:24:29,581 --> 01:24:31,511
(it's black bossam!)

2336
01:24:31,751 --> 01:24:32,950
Since the fried jokbal has been popular,

2337
01:24:32,951 --> 01:24:34,111
I used the techniques for it...

2338
01:24:34,751 --> 01:24:37,051
to fry bossam too.

2339
01:24:37,351 --> 01:24:39,890
(Covering it in the squid ink batter)

2340
01:24:39,891 --> 01:24:42,490
Instead of normal bread crumbs, I use the ones with squid ink...

2341
01:24:42,491 --> 01:24:43,720
to amplify its light flavor.

2342
01:24:43,721 --> 01:24:45,431
(Diving into the oil)

2343
01:24:45,691 --> 01:24:48,401
(Black bossam you can't find it anywhere else)

2344
01:24:49,701 --> 01:24:52,371
(Cutting it into bite-sized pieces)

2345
01:24:53,601 --> 01:24:54,640
(Adding spicy and sweet white chili sauce)

2346
01:24:54,641 --> 01:24:56,940
By adding the white chili sauce and basil flakes,

2347
01:24:56,941 --> 01:24:58,911
I add flavors and scents to finish.

2348
01:24:59,741 --> 01:25:02,581
(The owner's ambitious new menu)

2349
01:25:02,881 --> 01:25:05,680
With its unique visuals, it has become a popular menu.

2350
01:25:05,681 --> 01:25:06,851
(A feast of flavors and juiciness)

2351
01:25:07,511 --> 01:25:11,151
(Squid ink and basil fried bossam)

2352
01:25:11,251 --> 01:25:14,191
- Where's basil? - It's sprinkled on it.

2353
01:25:14,291 --> 01:25:16,020
- I see. - It must smell like basil.

2354
01:25:16,021 --> 01:25:18,130
(After sniffing it once,)

2355
01:25:18,131 --> 01:25:21,331
(he puts it straight into his mouth.)

2356
01:25:22,161 --> 01:25:23,630
(How does the somewhat unfamiliar menu taste?)

2357
01:25:23,631 --> 01:25:25,031
It's really unique.

2358
01:25:25,971 --> 01:25:27,031
It's so fascinating.

2359
01:25:27,841 --> 01:25:28,941
The outside is very crunchy.

2360
01:25:30,141 --> 01:25:31,171
It's good.

2361
01:25:31,371 --> 01:25:33,411
(Jae Seok takes a bite too.)

2362
01:25:33,641 --> 01:25:35,311
- It's so interesting. - It's so crispy outside.

2363
01:25:35,481 --> 01:25:36,711
(Amazed)

2364
01:25:37,011 --> 01:25:38,311
- Gosh. It's... - Isn't it good?

2365
01:25:39,151 --> 01:25:41,351
- The outside is crispy. - It's here.

2366
01:25:41,681 --> 01:25:43,450
The inside is like boiled pork slices.

2367
01:25:43,451 --> 01:25:44,520
- Yes. - Yes.

2368
01:25:44,521 --> 01:25:45,551
- Really? - Yes.

2369
01:25:46,191 --> 01:25:49,061
It's the ideal version of crispy outside, tender inside.

2370
01:25:50,261 --> 01:25:52,231
It tastes good. It's so flavorful.

2371
01:25:52,561 --> 01:25:53,561
It's so good.

2372
01:25:53,562 --> 01:25:55,631
(The perfect harmony of tender bossam and crispy batter)

2373
01:25:55,961 --> 01:25:57,871
Look. It's a boiled pork slice.

2374
01:25:58,671 --> 01:26:00,201
- Is that jokbal? - It's really good.

2375
01:26:00,471 --> 01:26:01,471
- It's good, isn't it? - Yes.

2376
01:26:01,941 --> 01:26:03,240
It's suspicious...

2377
01:26:03,241 --> 01:26:04,571
- because it's so good. - Really?

2378
01:26:05,341 --> 01:26:08,011
Yes. Unless an expert is involved,

2379
01:26:08,211 --> 01:26:10,980
one can't get a taste this good.

2380
01:26:10,981 --> 01:26:12,851
- It's so... - In my opinion,

2381
01:26:14,281 --> 01:26:15,321
- the three menus... - Yes.

2382
01:26:15,581 --> 01:26:16,821
(Focused)

2383
01:26:17,651 --> 01:26:18,821
They wouldn't make three menus when this place is a fake.

2384
01:26:19,551 --> 01:26:21,291
(Listening carefully)

2385
01:26:21,591 --> 01:26:22,791
(Laughing)

2386
01:26:22,891 --> 01:26:24,961
I thought he'd say something impressive.

2387
01:26:25,131 --> 01:26:26,491
Something that's really impressive.

2388
01:26:26,791 --> 01:26:27,801
So, I was focused.

2389
01:26:28,161 --> 01:26:30,461
Her words are piercing you, Jae Seok.

2390
01:26:31,001 --> 01:26:32,231
Hey. Yoon Kyung is...

2391
01:26:32,801 --> 01:26:35,100
- As we reach the end, - She is strong.

2392
01:26:35,101 --> 01:26:38,140
she's strong. She's a smiling troll.

2393
01:26:38,141 --> 01:26:39,171
A smiling troll.

2394
01:26:39,471 --> 01:26:40,471
(The one like the spring sunshine who strikes with facts)

2395
01:26:40,472 --> 01:26:42,011
- She says everything while smiling. - Yes.

2396
01:26:42,411 --> 01:26:43,411
You were too honest.

2397
01:26:43,412 --> 01:26:44,481
(Laughing)

2398
01:26:44,611 --> 01:26:45,980
They won't make three menus for a fake place.

2399
01:26:45,981 --> 01:26:47,751
(Stubborn)

2400
01:26:48,551 --> 01:26:49,820
By the way,

2401
01:26:49,821 --> 01:26:52,551
even if it's a menu that is recently launched,

2402
01:26:52,651 --> 01:26:54,520
he would have put it up on the wall.

2403
01:26:54,521 --> 01:26:56,560
- The name of the dish. - I said that earlier.

2404
01:26:56,561 --> 01:26:59,391
(I said that earlier.)

2405
01:26:59,791 --> 01:27:01,091
I got my revenge.

2406
01:27:02,731 --> 01:27:07,000
You were someone that was straight as an arrow.

2407
01:27:07,001 --> 01:27:09,371
I got my revenge.

2408
01:27:09,641 --> 01:27:10,701
Earlier,

2409
01:27:11,211 --> 01:27:12,810
what was the dish we had at the first place?

2410
01:27:12,811 --> 01:27:15,041
- The big-eyed herring. - That's him.

2411
01:27:16,241 --> 01:27:17,810
- The mind of a big-eyed herring. - The mind of a big-eyed herring.

2412
01:27:17,811 --> 01:27:18,880
You mentioned the first place...

2413
01:27:18,881 --> 01:27:20,351
- to bring up the big-eyed herring? - Yes.

2414
01:27:21,051 --> 01:27:22,121
Wasn't that smart?

2415
01:27:22,751 --> 01:27:24,050
I dare you to say something, Yoon Kyung!

2416
01:27:24,051 --> 01:27:25,151
(I dare you to say something, Yoon Kyung!)

2417
01:27:25,351 --> 01:27:27,551
I'll attack you no matter what.

2418
01:27:27,721 --> 01:27:29,961
(Laughing)

2419
01:27:30,321 --> 01:27:32,560
- But this isn't the last dish. - Right.

2420
01:27:32,561 --> 01:27:35,760
I think it's gradually getting fascinating.

2421
01:27:35,761 --> 01:27:37,831
The last one must be the most fascinating dish.

2422
01:27:39,071 --> 01:27:42,501
(What is the last dish after the fried jokbal and squid ink bossam?)

2423
01:27:42,841 --> 01:27:44,171
- It's here. - What?

2424
01:27:44,971 --> 01:27:45,971
Gosh!

2425
01:27:46,141 --> 01:27:47,770
- Oh, my. - What?

2426
01:27:47,771 --> 01:27:48,781
What?

2427
01:27:49,181 --> 01:27:50,181
What?

2428
01:27:51,881 --> 01:27:56,221
(The last Super Fascinating dish finally appears.)

2429
01:27:56,421 --> 01:27:58,721
(Which dish surprised the members?)

2430
01:27:59,521 --> 01:28:02,220
(Spicy lobster jokbal)

2431
01:28:02,221 --> 01:28:04,760
I thought about how the jokbal could be a hit on social media,

2432
01:28:04,761 --> 01:28:06,891
and the lobster came to mind.

2433
01:28:08,161 --> 01:28:09,760
I prepare lobsters brought from Canada...

2434
01:28:09,761 --> 01:28:11,630
by boiling them every day.

2435
01:28:11,631 --> 01:28:12,801
(Lobsters put into boiling hot water)

2436
01:28:14,471 --> 01:28:17,501
(It is put on hold after cooking the insides.)

2437
01:28:19,341 --> 01:28:20,940
The jokbal is sliced into bite-sized pieces...

2438
01:28:20,941 --> 01:28:22,610
and grilled in a pan.

2439
01:28:22,611 --> 01:28:25,681
(The flavor of the jokbal is brought up with the fire.)

2440
01:28:26,311 --> 01:28:28,650
After adding and mixing the special spicy sauce...

2441
01:28:28,651 --> 01:28:29,850
that I developed,

2442
01:28:29,851 --> 01:28:34,421
(The mouth-watering jokbal seasoned with the bright red sauce)

2443
01:28:34,691 --> 01:28:36,760
it is smoked with a torch.

2444
01:28:36,761 --> 01:28:38,661
(Smoky flavor added one more time to the spiciness)

2445
01:28:38,891 --> 01:28:41,030
The cheese sauce is then sprinkled on top.

2446
01:28:41,031 --> 01:28:42,130
(Finished with the savory cheddar cheese and lobster)

2447
01:28:42,131 --> 01:28:44,631
It is complete when the lobster is placed on top.

2448
01:28:45,671 --> 01:28:49,201
(Smoky spiciness loved by Koreans)

2449
01:28:50,501 --> 01:28:52,410
It is a dish...

2450
01:28:52,411 --> 01:28:54,171
that a lot of customers take pictures of for social media.

2451
01:28:54,941 --> 01:28:58,280
(Second new dish, spicy lobster jokbal)

2452
01:28:58,281 --> 01:29:00,280
This is perfect to post on social media.

2453
01:29:00,281 --> 01:29:01,351
- Right. - How much is this?

2454
01:29:01,751 --> 01:29:04,690
This is 68 dollars.

2455
01:29:04,691 --> 01:29:06,890
- It's quite expensive. - It should cost around this much.

2456
01:29:06,891 --> 01:29:08,990
It should cost this much as it has a whole lobster.

2457
01:29:08,991 --> 01:29:10,090
It should cost this much.

2458
01:29:10,091 --> 01:29:11,161
I'm excited.

2459
01:29:11,831 --> 01:29:13,861
- This isn't fried, right? - No.

2460
01:29:14,231 --> 01:29:15,661
- Seasoned jokbal? - Right.

2461
01:29:17,401 --> 01:29:19,671
(Amazed)

2462
01:29:20,931 --> 01:29:22,670
- It's delicious. - It's clearly...

2463
01:29:22,671 --> 01:29:23,870
- Gosh, it's spicy. - Gosh.

2464
01:29:23,871 --> 01:29:25,910
This feels like fried chicken, and this feels like seasoned chicken.

2465
01:29:25,911 --> 01:29:28,510
I thought that too. This feels like seasoned chicken.

2466
01:29:28,511 --> 01:29:30,840
- They both call for beer. - Right.

2467
01:29:30,841 --> 01:29:32,150
- It's a perfect beer snack. - Right.

2468
01:29:32,151 --> 01:29:33,710
This one is quite spicy.

2469
01:29:33,711 --> 01:29:36,380
(A spicy flavor that makes you crave beer)

2470
01:29:36,381 --> 01:29:37,880
This is too spicy for me.

2471
01:29:37,881 --> 01:29:38,890
Me too.

2472
01:29:38,891 --> 01:29:39,891
(Hiccupping)
Gosh, I'm in trouble.

2473
01:29:41,961 --> 01:29:43,290
It's because I ate something spicy.

2474
01:29:43,291 --> 01:29:44,320
- Really? - Really?

2475
01:29:44,321 --> 01:29:45,961
You suddenly felt like a drunkard.

2476
01:29:46,961 --> 01:29:48,661
That hiccup felt that way.

2477
01:29:49,061 --> 01:29:51,001
Kyoung Pyo is doing all sorts of things today.

2478
01:29:51,331 --> 01:29:52,531
I can't eat spicy things.

2479
01:29:53,171 --> 01:29:54,970
Do we have to cut this up by ourselves?

2480
01:29:54,971 --> 01:29:55,971
(It's time to have the lobster that will bring down the spiciness.)

2481
01:29:56,241 --> 01:29:58,141
Oh, the meat is inside.

2482
01:29:58,411 --> 01:30:00,510
(The lobster is filled with plump meat.)

2483
01:30:00,511 --> 01:30:02,281
Is that the leek inside?

2484
01:30:02,411 --> 01:30:04,541
- No. Those are the innards. - Oh, I see.

2485
01:30:04,911 --> 01:30:05,911
(Speechless)
(Trying her best to hold her laughter)

2486
01:30:07,011 --> 01:30:08,180
She doesn't have any stereotypes.

2487
01:30:08,181 --> 01:30:09,450
- She doesn't. - Gosh.

2488
01:30:09,451 --> 01:30:12,790
Yoon Kyung said something...

2489
01:30:12,791 --> 01:30:15,020
- She criticized her. - quite elegantly. She did.

2490
01:30:15,021 --> 01:30:16,290
- She got right at me. - Right.

2491
01:30:16,291 --> 01:30:17,560
"She doesn't have any stereotypes."

2492
01:30:17,561 --> 01:30:19,661
I really love that about you.

2493
01:30:20,131 --> 01:30:21,431
I'll try to cut it.

2494
01:30:22,061 --> 01:30:23,460
- It's right here. - Right.

2495
01:30:23,461 --> 01:30:25,231
It's full of meat.

2496
01:30:25,531 --> 01:30:28,041
All right. Here's the meat from the pincer.

2497
01:30:28,641 --> 01:30:29,841
Eun I is good at this.

2498
01:30:30,101 --> 01:30:31,201
CEO Song is good at this.

2499
01:30:32,141 --> 01:30:34,941
(How does the lobster placed on the jokbal taste?)

2500
01:30:36,411 --> 01:30:38,351
(Satisfied)

2501
01:30:38,911 --> 01:30:40,580
This is really good.

2502
01:30:40,581 --> 01:30:41,620
This is crazy good.

2503
01:30:41,621 --> 01:30:42,950
(It can't taste bad, no matter how you eat it.)

2504
01:30:42,951 --> 01:30:45,051
I don't understand the lobster.

2505
01:30:45,351 --> 01:30:48,161
Why did the lobster appear out of nowhere?

2506
01:30:48,661 --> 01:30:49,860
The jokbal...

2507
01:30:49,861 --> 01:30:51,890
- is a dish that is easy to eat. - Right.

2508
01:30:51,891 --> 01:30:53,160
But the lobster...

2509
01:30:53,161 --> 01:30:54,930
- has to be cut up. - There are even people...

2510
01:30:54,931 --> 01:30:56,700
- who eat boneless jokbal. - Right.

2511
01:30:56,701 --> 01:30:58,331
Some people don't even want to deal with the bones.

2512
01:30:59,001 --> 01:31:00,630
That does make sense.

2513
01:31:00,631 --> 01:31:01,940
I wasn't able to talk for a while...

2514
01:31:01,941 --> 01:31:03,171
because I was cutting this up.

2515
01:31:03,971 --> 01:31:07,941
This is a lot of work.

2516
01:31:08,111 --> 01:31:10,611
I thought that she was really getting ahead of herself.

2517
01:31:11,111 --> 01:31:13,210
I wanted everyone to try the lobster.

2518
01:31:13,211 --> 01:31:15,520
She could've just left the lobster.

2519
01:31:15,521 --> 01:31:17,350
She just had to cut the lobster.

2520
01:31:17,351 --> 01:31:20,650
We all had to have a taste of the lobster.

2521
01:31:20,651 --> 01:31:23,560
And the owner didn't give an explanation...

2522
01:31:23,561 --> 01:31:24,790
- on how to eat it. - Right.

2523
01:31:24,791 --> 01:31:26,930
- I thought he was going to cut it. - Same here.

2524
01:31:26,931 --> 01:31:27,991
The lobster...

2525
01:31:28,761 --> 01:31:31,000
is an expensive dish.

2526
01:31:31,001 --> 01:31:34,871
Considering the people who come to have jokbal,

2527
01:31:35,171 --> 01:31:37,601
it's a casual dish. The lobster feels off.

2528
01:31:37,771 --> 01:31:39,270
There's no reason for the lobster to be on top.

2529
01:31:39,271 --> 01:31:40,311
Right.

2530
01:31:40,341 --> 01:31:42,740
The sauce itself is good enough.

2531
01:31:42,741 --> 01:31:45,580
- Right. - The lobster wasn't necessary.

2532
01:31:45,581 --> 01:31:47,051
What do you think, Ki Young?

2533
01:31:47,211 --> 01:31:50,350
- The lobster does feel off. - Right.

2534
01:31:50,351 --> 01:31:51,850
The lobster should've been fried...

2535
01:31:51,851 --> 01:31:54,250
for it to fit this theme.

2536
01:31:54,251 --> 01:31:57,360
But it would be strange to fry the shellfish.

2537
01:31:57,361 --> 01:31:58,361
Right.

2538
01:31:59,061 --> 01:32:00,591
I had a strange thought.

2539
01:32:01,861 --> 01:32:03,630
(An unexpected timidness)

2540
01:32:03,631 --> 01:32:05,330
- That's Ki Young's charm. - He was so quick.

2541
01:32:05,331 --> 01:32:07,001
He doesn't go against what the older ones say.

2542
01:32:07,301 --> 01:32:08,600
- Gosh. - The older one is right.

2543
01:32:08,601 --> 01:32:09,870
Right.

2544
01:32:09,871 --> 01:32:10,871
(What Jae Seok says is the law.)

2545
01:32:11,071 --> 01:32:13,170
Well, I mentioned this earlier.

2546
01:32:13,171 --> 01:32:15,441
It feels suspicious that there are three dishes.

2547
01:32:15,741 --> 01:32:17,880
If this place was to be fake,

2548
01:32:17,881 --> 01:32:19,450
they would've cut down on the risks.

2549
01:32:19,451 --> 01:32:20,580
- Right. - Right.

2550
01:32:20,581 --> 01:32:22,520
There might be something behind...

2551
01:32:22,521 --> 01:32:23,980
revealing three dishes.

2552
01:32:23,981 --> 01:32:25,220
This one could already be...

2553
01:32:25,221 --> 01:32:26,290
- a popular dish. - Right.

2554
01:32:26,291 --> 01:32:27,720
The owner actually came up with two new dishes,

2555
01:32:27,721 --> 01:32:30,620
and it might've been him wanting to introduce them.

2556
01:32:30,621 --> 01:32:31,630
Right.

2557
01:32:31,631 --> 01:32:33,630
- That could be the case. - That could be the case.

2558
01:32:33,631 --> 01:32:36,330
Theoretically, this place seems fake,

2559
01:32:36,331 --> 01:32:37,930
but there's a feeling that this place is real.

2560
01:32:37,931 --> 01:32:39,570
It's suspicious, but there's no concrete evidence?

2561
01:32:39,571 --> 01:32:41,431
Right. There's no concrete evidence.

2562
01:32:42,341 --> 01:32:45,671
Gosh, it's hard. Each place has a certain point.

2563
01:32:46,311 --> 01:32:48,010
(Super Fascinating Jokbal Restaurant)

2564
01:32:48,011 --> 01:32:49,610
(Three dishes shown, new dish not found on the menu,)

2565
01:32:49,611 --> 01:32:51,281
(expensive combination with lobster)

2566
01:32:51,381 --> 01:32:52,651
Gosh, it's hard.

2567
01:32:52,951 --> 01:32:54,311
It's really hard.

2568
01:32:54,481 --> 01:32:56,251
We can't get it wrong again today.

2569
01:32:56,481 --> 01:32:58,390
- We have to get it right today. - If we get it wrong today,

2570
01:32:58,391 --> 01:32:59,820
it's our fifth loss.

2571
01:32:59,821 --> 01:33:01,351
Oh, no!

2572
01:33:02,091 --> 01:33:03,220
(Eyes rolling)

2573
01:33:03,221 --> 01:33:05,431
It feels like we're standing here...

2574
01:33:05,831 --> 01:33:07,661
- for public execution. - Right.

2575
01:33:07,931 --> 01:33:09,860
We are quite known...

2576
01:33:09,861 --> 01:33:11,300
- for listening to our guests. - Right.

2577
01:33:11,301 --> 01:33:13,231
- We'll have to think together. - What do you think?

2578
01:33:14,471 --> 01:33:17,871
The last dish from the jokbal place...

2579
01:33:18,511 --> 01:33:20,640
- felt quite suspicious. - I see.

2580
01:33:20,641 --> 01:33:23,641
(There were up to three Super Fascinating jokbal dishes?)

2581
01:33:24,011 --> 01:33:29,621
(The name of the new dish wasn't on the menu?)

2582
01:33:29,881 --> 01:33:32,451
(That menu might've been changed to come up with a fake menu.)

2583
01:33:33,021 --> 01:33:38,361
(Ki Young's deduction: The staff changed an existing dish!)

2584
01:33:39,491 --> 01:33:40,891
- I have no idea. - What about you, Yoon Kyung?

2585
01:33:41,131 --> 01:33:44,460
I keep feeling bothered...

2586
01:33:44,461 --> 01:33:47,070
about the first place.

2587
01:33:47,071 --> 01:33:49,070
When we asked when the mother's birthday was,

2588
01:33:49,071 --> 01:33:50,301
the two of them said completely different dates.

2589
01:33:50,741 --> 01:33:53,870
(Serving on inline skates, Super Fast)

2590
01:33:53,871 --> 01:33:55,140
(Is she really your daughter?)

2591
01:33:55,141 --> 01:33:56,181
(Yes!)

2592
01:33:56,411 --> 01:33:58,980
(When is your mother's birthday?)

2593
01:33:58,981 --> 01:34:00,650
(April 8!)

2594
01:34:00,651 --> 01:34:01,651
(May 8)

2595
01:34:01,652 --> 01:34:02,681
(They didn't match!)

2596
01:34:03,021 --> 01:34:04,951
(The Super Fast mother and daughter are fake?)

2597
01:34:05,151 --> 01:34:08,150
They kept feeling unnatural the whole time.

2598
01:34:08,151 --> 01:34:09,561
They've split up like this.

2599
01:34:09,961 --> 01:34:11,690
- We're suspecting the second place. - Right.

2600
01:34:11,691 --> 01:34:13,360
We've gone with the second place.

2601
01:34:13,361 --> 01:34:14,390
- What do you think? - Same here.

2602
01:34:14,391 --> 01:34:15,760
I find the second place to be suspicious too.

2603
01:34:15,761 --> 01:34:16,800
It's the second place for me too.

2604
01:34:16,801 --> 01:34:18,271
Because of the unit cost?

2605
01:34:18,671 --> 01:34:19,730
(A massive size...)

2606
01:34:19,731 --> 01:34:21,901
(compared to normal dumplings)

2607
01:34:22,501 --> 01:34:26,511
(The Super Huge dumpling soup that has never been heard of)

2608
01:34:26,871 --> 01:34:28,880
(Seeing the meat and ingredients in this,)

2609
01:34:28,881 --> 01:34:31,541
(the price is too cheap.)

2610
01:34:31,881 --> 01:34:35,921
(Huge dumpling soup, 25 dollars)

2611
01:34:36,081 --> 01:34:39,550
(A bowl of dumpling soup is around 12 dollars.)

2612
01:34:39,551 --> 01:34:40,820
(The huge dumpling soup is twice the price of the regular.)

2613
01:34:40,821 --> 01:34:42,661
(This is almost 4 portions!)

2614
01:34:43,061 --> 01:34:44,520
(A dish for 4 at the price of 2)

2615
01:34:44,521 --> 01:34:47,631
(Is the huge dumpling soup too cheap?)

2616
01:34:47,691 --> 01:34:49,200
(Then...)

2617
01:34:49,201 --> 01:34:51,160
It seems like the second place...

2618
01:34:51,161 --> 01:34:53,301
- has the most votes. - Well, that is true, but...

2619
01:34:55,241 --> 01:34:57,600
I don't want to be responsible!

2620
01:34:57,601 --> 01:34:59,540
- You all are indecisive, right? - I don't want to be responsible!

2621
01:34:59,541 --> 01:35:01,070
- I don't want to be responsible! - But...

2622
01:35:01,071 --> 01:35:03,341
the other places felt strange too.

2623
01:35:03,611 --> 01:35:04,740
As you mentioned,

2624
01:35:04,741 --> 01:35:06,580
- the first place was weird too. - Right.

2625
01:35:06,581 --> 01:35:07,950
They all had strange points.

2626
01:35:07,951 --> 01:35:10,850
The two dishes of the last place were quite excessive too.

2627
01:35:10,851 --> 01:35:12,790
- Right. The lobster. - Finally!

2628
01:35:12,791 --> 01:35:15,191
- The lobster felt off. - He finally admitted it.

2629
01:35:16,161 --> 01:35:18,790
- We should do rock-paper-scissors. - Oh, my gosh.

2630
01:35:18,791 --> 01:35:19,791
You have to lose if you...

2631
01:35:19,792 --> 01:35:21,390
- don't want to be responsible. - You have to lose.

2632
01:35:21,391 --> 01:35:23,301
- Rock-paper-scissors! - Rock-paper-scissors!

2633
01:35:23,431 --> 01:35:24,460
(Paper)

2634
01:35:24,461 --> 01:35:28,371
(Scissors)

2635
01:35:29,441 --> 01:35:30,441
Gosh!

2636
01:35:32,111 --> 01:35:35,011
How did all five of us play paper?

2637
01:35:35,281 --> 01:35:36,740
Kyoung Pyo's choice!

2638
01:35:36,741 --> 01:35:39,050
It's Kyoung Pyo's choice!

2639
01:35:39,051 --> 01:35:40,680
(Kyoung Pyo feels a lot of weight on his shoulders.)

2640
01:35:40,681 --> 01:35:42,621
He looks so burdened.

2641
01:35:43,351 --> 01:35:44,950
(Excited as it's not their business)

2642
01:35:44,951 --> 01:35:46,420
This will really keep you awake.

2643
01:35:46,421 --> 01:35:48,120
(Everyone is enjoying it except for Kyoung Pyo.)

2644
01:35:48,121 --> 01:35:49,220
Well,

2645
01:35:49,221 --> 01:35:50,560
I'll go with the place with the most votes.

2646
01:35:50,561 --> 01:35:51,561
Okay.

2647
01:35:51,562 --> 01:35:53,860
I will go for the second place.

2648
01:35:53,861 --> 01:35:55,660
All right. Number two is Kyoung Pyo's choice.

2649
01:35:55,661 --> 01:35:57,130
Will number two be correct?

2650
01:35:57,131 --> 01:35:58,131
- Please! - Gosh.

2651
01:35:58,132 --> 01:35:59,730
- What if we're wrong again? - Gosh.

2652
01:35:59,731 --> 01:36:01,230
We have to get it right today.

2653
01:36:01,231 --> 01:36:02,240
Seriously.

2654
01:36:02,241 --> 01:36:03,870
We really have to get it right today.

2655
01:36:03,871 --> 01:36:05,341
(Strange Landing Operation's answer is revealed!)

2656
01:36:07,411 --> 01:36:08,411
(Incheon)

2657
01:36:08,412 --> 01:36:10,510
Oh, please. We have to get it right today.

2658
01:36:10,511 --> 01:36:11,511
Gosh, I feel so nervous!

2659
01:36:12,581 --> 01:36:13,910
(Right now,)

2660
01:36:13,911 --> 01:36:15,250
(make your landing.)

2661
01:36:15,251 --> 01:36:16,750
This would never have been imagined.

2662
01:36:16,751 --> 01:36:17,820
Gosh.

2663
01:36:17,821 --> 01:36:19,391
Did we have to go this far?

2664
01:36:20,551 --> 01:36:22,090
How will they get this right?

2665
01:36:22,091 --> 01:36:23,420
Gosh, I don't have a clue.

2666
01:36:23,421 --> 01:36:24,491
(Strange things are coming.)

2667
01:36:24,721 --> 01:36:28,500
(The Incheon Landing Operation takes place!)

2668
01:36:28,501 --> 01:36:30,130
- The place with inline skates. - The place with inline skates.

2669
01:36:30,131 --> 01:36:31,201
What?

2670
01:36:31,501 --> 01:36:33,300
The first place felt real.

2671
01:36:33,301 --> 01:36:34,371
(The silver big-eyed herring served by a medalist)

2672
01:36:34,631 --> 01:36:36,140
(Super Fast delivery, big-eyed herring skater)

2673
01:36:36,141 --> 01:36:37,441
This place is real.

2674
01:36:38,171 --> 01:36:39,171
Am I wrong?

2675
01:36:39,371 --> 01:36:40,770
(Forget about the dumplings you have known until now!)

2676
01:36:40,771 --> 01:36:42,380
(Massive size)

2677
01:36:42,381 --> 01:36:43,881
(Curious)

2678
01:36:44,581 --> 01:36:46,050
(Super Huge dumpling soup)

2679
01:36:46,051 --> 01:36:47,380
Is this place real?

2680
01:36:47,381 --> 01:36:48,381
It might be.

2681
01:36:48,841 --> 01:36:50,920
(Everything possible with jokbal is done!)

2682
01:36:50,921 --> 01:36:52,091
Is it the third place?

2683
01:36:52,421 --> 01:36:54,521
The dishes looked great too.

2684
01:36:55,821 --> 01:36:58,021
(Super Fascinating combination, variety of jokbal dishes)

2685
01:36:58,631 --> 01:36:59,890
(Which place is fake from today's Strange Landing Operation?)

2686
01:36:59,891 --> 01:37:01,091
Could it be the third place?

2687
01:37:01,961 --> 01:37:04,001
- Oh, no! - No!

2688
01:37:04,161 --> 01:37:05,730
It feels like the third place!

2689
01:37:05,731 --> 01:37:07,571
It feels like the third place for some reason!

2690
01:37:08,701 --> 01:37:12,041
(Which place is fake out of the three?)

2691
01:37:12,671 --> 01:37:15,780
- Here comes the answer! - All right.

2692
01:37:15,781 --> 01:37:17,041
(Let's get it right!)

2693
01:37:17,211 --> 01:37:18,980
(Which is the fake place that deceived you?)

2694
01:37:18,981 --> 01:37:20,511
Please! We have to get it right today!

2695
01:37:20,911 --> 01:37:21,980
Which place is it?

2696
01:37:21,981 --> 01:37:23,151
(A precious 3rd win or the most losses with the 5th?)

2697
01:37:23,221 --> 01:37:25,890
(It will be revealed now.)

2698
01:37:25,891 --> 01:37:26,891
Which place is it?

2699
01:37:28,356 --> 01:37:29,995
(Super Huge dumpling soup)

2700
01:37:29,996 --> 01:37:32,366
(Fake)

2701
01:37:32,926 --> 01:37:37,096
(We got it right!)

2702
01:37:37,366 --> 01:37:39,105
(Shouting and laughing)

2703
01:37:39,106 --> 01:37:40,106
(Screaming)

2704
01:37:41,006 --> 01:37:42,036
We got it right!

2705
01:37:42,806 --> 01:37:45,106
- Yes! - We got it!

2706
01:37:45,646 --> 01:37:47,306
We got it right today!

2707
01:37:47,646 --> 01:37:48,776
That's amazing!

2708
01:37:49,476 --> 01:37:50,986
- Right. - That's amazing!

2709
01:37:51,246 --> 01:37:53,446
- That won't meet the unit cost. - Right.

2710
01:37:53,846 --> 01:37:54,986
Yes!

2711
01:37:56,216 --> 01:37:58,785
(Sighing)

2712
01:37:58,786 --> 01:37:59,786
My legs are shaking.

2713
01:37:59,826 --> 01:38:01,026
- Your legs are shaking? - Yes.

2714
01:38:01,896 --> 01:38:04,465
- I thought we were wrong. - The third place felt fake too.

2715
01:38:04,466 --> 01:38:05,496
Same here.

2716
01:38:06,766 --> 01:38:08,295
It was hard today.

2717
01:38:08,296 --> 01:38:09,695
- Right. - Right.

2718
01:38:09,696 --> 01:38:10,796
What is that?

2719
01:38:11,106 --> 01:38:12,935
(The fake places that became actual popular places after the show)

2720
01:38:12,936 --> 01:38:14,035
Really?

2721
01:38:14,036 --> 01:38:15,475
(Kimchi bomb chicken, up to 1 hour and 30 minute-waits on weekends)

2722
01:38:15,476 --> 01:38:16,876
Look at all of those people.

2723
01:38:17,076 --> 01:38:18,545
(Five times more on sales than before the show)

2724
01:38:18,546 --> 01:38:20,545
- That was really good. - That was really good.

2725
01:38:20,546 --> 01:38:21,716
That was really good.

2726
01:38:21,816 --> 01:38:23,846
- Really? - Gosh!

2727
01:38:24,176 --> 01:38:26,016
(And...)

2728
01:38:26,316 --> 01:38:28,055
(do you remember the place that was crazy about ice cream?)

2729
01:38:28,056 --> 01:38:29,216
The ice cream tteokbokki.

2730
01:38:29,656 --> 01:38:30,686
Right.

2731
01:38:32,156 --> 01:38:33,785
That chef must've returned.

2732
01:38:33,786 --> 01:38:35,396
- Chef Kim Hoon. - Chef Kim Hoon.

2733
01:38:35,656 --> 01:38:37,025
(Chef Kim Hoon, Yongnidan-gil hot place maker,)

2734
01:38:37,026 --> 01:38:38,426
(the man with annual sales of 10 million dollars)

2735
01:38:38,596 --> 01:38:40,665
Why did you start with the dumpling place?

2736
01:38:40,666 --> 01:38:42,365
- Why dumplings? - The dumpling place?

2737
01:38:42,366 --> 01:38:44,836
The members of our family love dumplings,

2738
01:38:45,106 --> 01:38:47,606
so I came up with the idea of starting a dumpling place.

2739
01:38:47,736 --> 01:38:49,336
I then got sick...

2740
01:38:49,676 --> 01:38:51,345
and had to close the place for three months...

2741
01:38:51,346 --> 01:38:52,346
after being hospitalized.

2742
01:38:52,576 --> 01:38:55,175
May I ask what you went through to be sick?

2743
01:38:55,176 --> 01:38:57,646
I went through surgery for stomach cancer.

2744
01:38:58,416 --> 01:38:59,946
That was why.

2745
01:39:00,386 --> 01:39:02,055
My goodness, she went through a lot.

2746
01:39:02,056 --> 01:39:03,785
What she said earlier was true.

2747
01:39:03,786 --> 01:39:04,926
Right.

2748
01:39:05,156 --> 01:39:06,555
The dumpling place went well.

2749
01:39:06,556 --> 01:39:08,496
I really enjoyed running the place.

2750
01:39:08,696 --> 01:39:11,426
I was suddenly told that I had stomach cancer.

2751
01:39:11,696 --> 01:39:14,225
"I'm this healthy. What are you talking about?"

2752
01:39:14,226 --> 01:39:15,296
I just laughed it off like this.

2753
01:39:15,896 --> 01:39:16,936
I'm serious.

2754
01:39:18,336 --> 01:39:20,406
I returned after receiving my surgery,

2755
01:39:20,706 --> 01:39:23,705
but things didn't go well due to the recession.

2756
01:39:23,706 --> 01:39:26,045
(She reopened the place, but recession occurred.)

2757
01:39:26,046 --> 01:39:27,506
Gosh.

2758
01:39:28,046 --> 01:39:31,346
(The owner's winter was bitterly cold.)

2759
01:39:31,486 --> 01:39:33,285
(Help is needed to bring the place back up again!)

2760
01:39:33,286 --> 01:39:36,215
What could be something that suits Incheon?

2761
01:39:36,216 --> 01:39:37,216
(What idea did Chef Kim Hoon come up with?)

2762
01:39:37,217 --> 01:39:38,525
How does this sound?

2763
01:39:38,526 --> 01:39:40,926
This is the process of making a huge dumpling.

2764
01:39:41,226 --> 01:39:42,596
(Huge dumpling?)

2765
01:39:43,456 --> 01:39:44,525
(What is that?)

2766
01:39:44,526 --> 01:39:45,596
What is that?

2767
01:39:45,896 --> 01:39:46,965
Where is that?

2768
01:39:46,966 --> 01:39:48,295
It's an actual dumpling...

2769
01:39:48,296 --> 01:39:49,435
- made in China. - It was based on something...

2770
01:39:49,436 --> 01:39:50,596
that actually existed.

2771
01:39:50,636 --> 01:39:52,905
After making a huge dumpling,

2772
01:39:52,906 --> 01:39:55,005
I thought about making a huge dumpling soup.

2773
01:39:55,006 --> 01:39:56,436
- A dumpling soup? - That's amazing.

2774
01:39:56,476 --> 01:39:59,675
Would it be possible to cook everything inside?

2775
01:39:59,676 --> 01:40:01,415
This must be really hard for the chefs.

2776
01:40:01,416 --> 01:40:02,445
Right.

2777
01:40:02,446 --> 01:40:03,675
- It must be really tough. - Right.

2778
01:40:03,676 --> 01:40:05,316
The chefs must feel so much pressure.

2779
01:40:06,486 --> 01:40:08,186
The chef looks sexy today.

2780
01:40:08,616 --> 01:40:11,016
He has tried making everything on his own.

2781
01:40:11,386 --> 01:40:13,125
(Testing the batter with different versions)

2782
01:40:13,126 --> 01:40:15,756
- I'll test the thick skin. - The batter is important.

2783
01:40:16,126 --> 01:40:19,026
- No wonder the batter was amazing. - Right.

2784
01:40:20,066 --> 01:40:22,995
(However...)

2785
01:40:22,996 --> 01:40:24,366
It keeps getting holes.

2786
01:40:24,836 --> 01:40:26,266
Is it because the skin is too thin?

2787
01:40:26,536 --> 01:40:28,906
- The skin comes apart. - It would be hard to make it work.

2788
01:40:28,936 --> 01:40:30,236
It can't even be lifted up.

2789
01:40:30,276 --> 01:40:32,946
We have no choice but to use a stronger skin.

2790
01:40:33,506 --> 01:40:35,546
(Endless process of changing the dumpling skin)

2791
01:40:36,746 --> 01:40:38,816
He went through so much.

2792
01:40:42,756 --> 01:40:44,855
Gosh!

2793
01:40:44,856 --> 01:40:45,856
Oh, no!

2794
01:40:48,326 --> 01:40:49,995
(Chef Kim Hoon gets stuck with the huge dumpling.)

2795
01:40:49,996 --> 01:40:51,796
Why is it tearing apart? Because it's all-purpose flour?

2796
01:40:53,326 --> 01:40:55,196
(He's running out of time before sharing the recipe.)

2797
01:40:55,396 --> 01:40:58,166
(Will he be able to succeed in time with the huge dumpling?)

2798
01:40:59,366 --> 01:41:01,576
It should be pushed together like this.

2799
01:41:04,206 --> 01:41:06,806
- But that tasted really good. - Right.

2800
01:41:07,306 --> 01:41:09,416
(The huge dumpling is finally made.)

2801
01:41:10,116 --> 01:41:12,645
It's a dumpling that is 25cm long.

2802
01:41:12,646 --> 01:41:13,846
It's 2.5kg?

2803
01:41:14,916 --> 01:41:17,716
We could start a dumpling place.

2804
01:41:18,486 --> 01:41:20,086
He really went through so much.

2805
01:41:21,226 --> 01:41:22,395
- Hello. - Welcome.

2806
01:41:22,396 --> 01:41:23,496
Have you been doing well?

2807
01:41:23,956 --> 01:41:25,665
I came up with the idea of making a huge dumpling.

2808
01:41:25,666 --> 01:41:27,466
It's a dumpling that's really big.

2809
01:41:27,896 --> 01:41:29,536
- It isn't that hard. - Right.

2810
01:41:29,636 --> 01:41:32,866
The point is to spread it out thinly and widely as much as possible.

2811
01:41:33,206 --> 01:41:35,476
(How will the huge dumpling be for the owner?)

2812
01:41:36,036 --> 01:41:38,875
(The owner does it fairly easily.)

2813
01:41:38,876 --> 01:41:39,876
Gosh.

2814
01:41:39,877 --> 01:41:41,916
- She has the experience. - She's the expert.

2815
01:41:42,316 --> 01:41:44,215
She made all of it.

2816
01:41:44,216 --> 01:41:46,086
- Is this right? - She made all of it.

2817
01:41:46,746 --> 01:41:48,516
- That's a sign of her experience. - Like this?

2818
01:41:49,056 --> 01:41:50,915
(Do you remember the Huge Dumpling Challenge?)

2819
01:41:50,916 --> 01:41:52,556
Right. Heebab did the challenge.

2820
01:41:53,126 --> 01:41:54,896
Hello, Heebab.

2821
01:41:55,156 --> 01:41:57,355
This is the Sixth Sense production crew.

2822
01:41:57,356 --> 01:41:59,025
May we use your portrait rights?

2823
01:41:59,026 --> 01:42:01,065
- So that was what had happened. - Really?

2824
01:42:01,066 --> 01:42:02,566
- That's amazing. - Thank you.

2825
01:42:02,596 --> 01:42:03,866
Right.

2826
01:42:03,896 --> 01:42:06,336
We didn't look at the pictures closely.

2827
01:42:06,466 --> 01:42:07,975
That picture wasn't taken at the restaurant.

2828
01:42:07,976 --> 01:42:09,175
You're right.

2829
01:42:09,176 --> 01:42:10,736
She took the picture and sent it.

2830
01:42:11,306 --> 01:42:12,706
- That was what had happened? - Right.

2831
01:42:13,476 --> 01:42:15,775
- Hold on. Poongja appeared too. - Right.

2832
01:42:15,776 --> 01:42:17,675
The video with Poongja is definitely fake then.

2833
01:42:17,676 --> 01:42:18,686
Right.

2834
01:42:19,386 --> 01:42:21,586
(Is the "Repeat Restaurant" video with Poongja fake?)

2835
01:42:22,156 --> 01:42:23,285
(Someone bigger than the huge dumpling is coming.)

2836
01:42:23,286 --> 01:42:25,286
Someone big is coming.

2837
01:42:25,756 --> 01:42:27,326
Hello.

2838
01:42:27,456 --> 01:42:28,556
That's Poongja, right?

2839
01:42:29,126 --> 01:42:30,726
Right!

2840
01:42:31,466 --> 01:42:33,396
Right. It's Poongja.

2841
01:42:33,826 --> 01:42:34,835
(Gwangju, Daegu, Cheating Day, Mokpo, Suwon)

2842
01:42:34,836 --> 01:42:36,996
(The hottest YouTube variety show, "Repeat Restaurant")

2843
01:42:37,236 --> 01:42:39,005
I've never gotten ready four hours before...

2844
01:42:39,006 --> 01:42:40,636
to fool someone.

2845
01:42:41,206 --> 01:42:42,876
Fooling someone.

2846
01:42:43,306 --> 01:42:44,576
It's such an exciting thing.

2847
01:42:45,146 --> 01:42:47,546
- Have you checked the scenario? - Yes. I have.

2848
01:42:48,016 --> 01:42:49,945
It will be played...

2849
01:42:49,946 --> 01:42:51,715
after being edited just like "Repeat Restaurant."

2850
01:42:51,716 --> 01:42:52,716
What?

2851
01:42:52,717 --> 01:42:53,885
- They didn't go this far before, - Really?

2852
01:42:53,886 --> 01:42:54,986
but they've decided to be like this starting from this season.

2853
01:42:55,416 --> 01:42:56,785
Do you actually go this far?

2854
01:42:56,786 --> 01:42:57,786
(Of course!)

2855
01:42:57,787 --> 01:43:00,155
I was so surprised. Is this really Sixth Sense?

2856
01:43:00,156 --> 01:43:01,795
Everything feels suspicious. What is this place...

2857
01:43:01,796 --> 01:43:03,496
- and who are all of you? - That's rational suspicion.

2858
01:43:03,796 --> 01:43:05,096
This is really "Repeat Restaurant."

2859
01:43:05,666 --> 01:43:07,625
("Repeat Restaurant")

2860
01:43:07,626 --> 01:43:10,296
I've arrived at the second place in Incheon.

2861
01:43:10,936 --> 01:43:13,836
She's so good.

2862
01:43:13,966 --> 01:43:15,776
- She's definitely a star. - Right.

2863
01:43:16,536 --> 01:43:19,406
- This is one whole dumpling, right? - Yes.

2864
01:43:19,546 --> 01:43:22,375
I heard this place has the Huge Dumpling Challenge.

2865
01:43:22,376 --> 01:43:24,946
- Ma'am, I will go for it! - Okay.

2866
01:43:25,086 --> 01:43:27,446
That was nice of Poongja to help out.

2867
01:43:30,656 --> 01:43:32,785
(However...)

2868
01:43:32,786 --> 01:43:34,226
It won't disappear at all.

2869
01:43:34,856 --> 01:43:35,926
I can't carry on.

2870
01:43:37,496 --> 01:43:39,025
- I'll pay. - She failed.

2871
01:43:39,026 --> 01:43:40,026
(Poongja fails the Huge Dumpling Challenge.)

2872
01:43:40,027 --> 01:43:41,635
- It was so confusing. - We almost got fooled.

2873
01:43:41,636 --> 01:43:42,666
For a moment, I even thought...

2874
01:43:42,766 --> 01:43:45,465
- I watched that episode. - Right.

2875
01:43:45,466 --> 01:43:46,736
But Yoon Kyung pointed it out.

2876
01:43:46,806 --> 01:43:48,236
The editing was done exactly the same.

2877
01:43:48,976 --> 01:43:50,375
(Why was the editing similar?)

2878
01:43:50,376 --> 01:43:51,476
Why?

2879
01:43:52,606 --> 01:43:55,516
Hello. This is the Sixth Sense production crew.

2880
01:43:55,546 --> 01:43:57,116
You're the producer of "Repeat Restaurant," right?

2881
01:43:57,646 --> 01:43:59,285
- Well, actually... - Hold on.

2882
01:43:59,286 --> 01:44:00,385
(Trying to reach out to the "Repeat Restaurant" crew)

2883
01:44:00,386 --> 01:44:02,186
Are you serious?

2884
01:44:02,786 --> 01:44:05,685
Well, we have never shown anyone...

2885
01:44:05,686 --> 01:44:08,856
how we edit our videos.

2886
01:44:09,526 --> 01:44:10,995
Will that be too much to ask?

2887
01:44:10,996 --> 01:44:12,626
(Will they fail to reach out to them?)

2888
01:44:12,796 --> 01:44:16,496
We will show you if you come to our office.

2889
01:44:16,666 --> 01:44:17,866
That would be great.

2890
01:44:18,466 --> 01:44:19,466
(They visited the "Repeat Restaurant" office...)
(after much difficulty.)

2891
01:44:20,766 --> 01:44:23,175
- I see. - Really?

2892
01:44:23,176 --> 01:44:24,376
That's amazing!

2893
01:44:24,776 --> 01:44:26,346
No wonder.

2894
01:44:27,076 --> 01:44:28,876
It was made really carefully.

2895
01:44:29,076 --> 01:44:31,846
They must have followed their editing style.

2896
01:44:31,886 --> 01:44:34,646
- Things like the font styles. - It was exactly the same.

2897
01:44:34,956 --> 01:44:36,986
It would be great if you could take this as well.

2898
01:44:37,016 --> 01:44:38,156
Do well to fool them.

2899
01:44:38,656 --> 01:44:40,056
- Let's do this! - Let's do this!

2900
01:44:40,186 --> 01:44:41,756
That's just amazing.

2901
01:44:42,256 --> 01:44:44,195
- My goodness. - There's more?

2902
01:44:44,196 --> 01:44:45,266
There's more?

(Warm spring has finally come to the owner.)

2924
01:45:28,607 --> 01:45:30,906
- The crew did a great job. - Right.

2925
01:45:31,876 --> 01:45:33,145
Sixth Sense,

2926
01:45:33,146 --> 01:45:34,915
this dish is fake.

2927
01:45:34,916 --> 01:45:36,916
(The huge dumpling soup that fooled everyone is fake.)

2928
01:45:37,246 --> 01:45:39,385
(It's finally our 3rd win!)

2929
01:45:39,386 --> 01:45:41,555
- Let's go! - That felt thrilling!

2930
01:45:41,556 --> 01:45:42,755
We got it right after a while!

2931
01:45:42,756 --> 01:45:44,926
- That felt thrilling! - We got it right after a while!

2932
01:45:45,486 --> 01:45:46,926
It's for the coffee truck. It's something good for us.

2933
01:45:47,186 --> 01:45:48,326
(What?)

2934
01:45:49,626 --> 01:45:51,566
(The winner of the coffee truck, Kang Ki Young)

2935
01:45:51,696 --> 01:45:52,925
Ki Young is earning a lot today.

2936
01:45:52,926 --> 01:45:54,865
That's right. Gosh.

2937
01:45:54,866 --> 01:45:56,096
He's earning a lot.

2938
01:45:56,136 --> 01:45:58,166
- Thank you. - Congratulations!

2939
01:45:59,836 --> 01:46:02,035
(We would like to thank Kang Ki Young and Ha Yoon Kyung...)

2940
01:46:02,036 --> 01:46:03,982
(for joining us as guests.)

2941
01:46:04,185 --> 01:46:05,585
(I don't think I've ever visited here just on a trip.)

2942
01:46:05,885 --> 01:46:06,885
(Really?)

2943
01:46:06,886 --> 01:46:07,915
(It's great to come here on a trip.)

2944
01:46:08,385 --> 01:46:10,425
(Where is this place that the members are astonished about?)

2945
01:46:10,755 --> 01:46:12,495
(Eighth City Tour)

2946
01:46:12,955 --> 01:46:14,355
(Jeonju)

2947
01:46:14,725 --> 01:46:16,095
(Whispering)

2948
01:46:16,495 --> 01:46:17,595
(What?)

2949
01:46:18,295 --> 01:46:20,765
(It would be hard to sell to the customers?)

2950
01:46:21,135 --> 01:46:22,805
(Don't get me wrong.)

2951
01:46:23,105 --> 01:46:25,205
(We can't fall into what's fake.)

2952
01:46:25,505 --> 01:46:27,475
(He's trying to look smart again!)

2953
01:46:27,705 --> 01:46:30,175
(Tae Hyun, Jae Seok's original bully)

2954
01:46:30,445 --> 01:46:31,445
(Looking here)

2955
01:46:31,645 --> 01:46:33,145
(Looking there)

2956
01:46:33,975 --> 01:46:35,044
(I see.)

2957
01:46:35,045 --> 01:46:36,115
(This place is lying.)

2958
01:46:36,345 --> 01:46:37,385
(Why?)

2959
01:46:37,415 --> 01:46:38,415
(Just because)

2960
01:46:38,416 --> 01:46:40,515
(IVE's REI, Jae Seok's new bully)

2961
01:46:41,015 --> 01:46:43,254
(The Blunt Ones and Jae Seok's bullies)

2962
01:46:43,255 --> 01:46:46,455
(What is today's theme they will explore through together?)

2963
01:46:46,895 --> 01:46:48,725
(Guinness of Jeonju)

2964
01:46:49,165 --> 01:46:50,225
(However,)

2965
01:46:50,265 --> 01:46:51,295
(it's different today.)

2966
01:46:51,595 --> 01:46:52,665
(It's not about finding the fake place.)

2967
01:46:52,865 --> 01:46:54,665
(Find the one place that is real!)

2968
01:46:54,935 --> 01:46:56,535
(With the new rule,)

2969
01:46:56,835 --> 01:46:58,775
(they all get lost.)

2970
01:46:59,135 --> 01:47:02,275
(Today's search with the greatest difficulty!)

2971
01:47:02,905 --> 01:47:06,415
(An explosion of excitement)

2972
01:47:06,615 --> 01:47:08,485
(Gosh, you're handsome!)

2973
01:47:08,915 --> 01:47:09,915
(Who? Me?)

2974
01:47:10,185 --> 01:47:11,244
(Yes!)

2975
01:47:11,245 --> 01:47:13,255
(A tour around Jeonju's hot places!)

2976
01:47:13,685 --> 01:47:15,555
(Finding the real hot place in Jeonju with great satisfaction)

2977
01:47:15,985 --> 01:47:18,855
(Which place is real?)
