1
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,886
(Lee Dong Wook Lim Soojung)

2
00:01:14,137 --> 00:01:16,806
(E Som)

3
00:01:17,307 --> 00:01:20,185
(Jang Hyun Sung Kim Ji Young)

4
00:01:20,268 --> 00:01:24,272
(Lee Mi Do Lee Sang Yi
Ji E-Suu)

5
00:01:38,661 --> 00:01:42,082
No way. I checked twice.

6
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:44,209
Must I come and find typos?

7
00:01:45,502 --> 00:01:46,265
Twice means two people

8
00:01:46,332 --> 00:01:47,587
go through it once each!

9
00:01:48,171 --> 00:01:50,174
But Byung-su is still a trainee.

10
00:01:50,257 --> 00:01:51,967
Then train him fast.

11
00:01:52,342 --> 00:01:53,339
I told you, books...

12
00:01:53,406 --> 00:01:54,970
Aren't made alone!

13
00:01:55,928 --> 00:01:57,514
I'll check again.

14
00:01:58,098 --> 00:02:00,184
Oh, no.

15
00:02:00,267 --> 00:02:02,560
(Microdust)

16
00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:06,023
Hello, boss. I'm listening.

17
00:02:08,191 --> 00:02:09,192
What?

18
00:02:10,402 --> 00:02:11,320
Why!

19
00:02:12,404 --> 00:02:14,130
Why do unusual things happen

20
00:02:14,197 --> 00:02:15,698
to writers who sign on with us?

21
00:02:17,534 --> 00:02:19,449
The author of "Health First"
gets sick

22
00:02:19,516 --> 00:02:20,703
and stops writing.

23
00:02:21,371 --> 00:02:22,912
The lawyer who wrote "Easy Law"

24
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:23,956
gets scammed.

25
00:02:24,874 --> 00:02:26,834
The songwriter
of "Love Being Alone"

26
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:28,420
suddenly gets pregnant!

27
00:02:29,754 --> 00:02:31,673
I guess artists are like that.

28
00:02:32,132 --> 00:02:33,691
The communication expert who wrote

29
00:02:33,758 --> 00:02:35,385
"Laws of Communication"
is ghosting.

30
00:02:35,468 --> 00:02:37,427
That's why, chief editor,

31
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,598
you should've watched Choi Su-lin.

32
00:02:39,681 --> 00:02:41,308
Yes, it's all my fault.

33
00:02:41,891 --> 00:02:43,935
I should've made sure
she carried condoms.

34
00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:46,921
Watch that mouth of yours!

35
00:02:47,772 --> 00:02:48,916
What do you think?

36
00:02:49,317 --> 00:02:50,650
Should we call in a shaman?

37
00:02:51,109 --> 00:02:52,944
Good idea!

38
00:02:53,028 --> 00:02:54,071
Why you...

39
00:02:54,904 --> 00:02:56,066
How about publishing

40
00:02:56,133 --> 00:02:57,532
just "Single in Barcelona"?

41
00:02:57,615 --> 00:02:59,368
Author Hong
is our main headliner anyway.

42
00:02:59,451 --> 00:03:00,968
The Publication Promotion Agency

43
00:03:01,035 --> 00:03:01,828
funding requires a series.

44
00:03:03,121 --> 00:03:05,248
Where can we find a new writer?

45
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,127
(University Prep)

46
00:03:14,507 --> 00:03:15,592
Whoa. Hunky.

47
00:03:23,475 --> 00:03:25,060
(Park Young-ho)

48
00:03:27,687 --> 00:03:29,293
I'm Park Young-ho,

49
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,316
your new essay teacher.

50
00:03:31,399 --> 00:03:32,484
No clapping.

51
00:03:33,151 --> 00:03:35,612
You may think subjects like
Korean literature

52
00:03:35,695 --> 00:03:40,325
and essay writing
are classy and easier to prepare.

53
00:03:40,408 --> 00:03:42,619
Especially essays!

54
00:03:43,578 --> 00:03:48,083
They're difficult
in university entrance exams.

55
00:03:49,126 --> 00:03:52,337
So, let's not get too excited.

56
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,841
The girl with dark glasses,

57
00:03:53,908 --> 00:03:54,589
don't twirl your pen.

58
00:03:55,465 --> 00:03:56,550
Boy in second row.

59
00:03:56,633 --> 00:03:58,177
Spit out your gum.

60
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,511
Now,

61
00:03:59,594 --> 00:04:02,722
what must we objectively do?

62
00:04:03,681 --> 00:04:07,644
Identify the thesis.

63
00:04:07,727 --> 00:04:10,480
If you understand
the thesis in an essay?

64
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,026
You're gold!

65
00:04:17,404 --> 00:04:19,614
May I ask a question, Mr. Park?

66
00:04:20,157 --> 00:04:22,700
I'm done working. Tomorrow.

67
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,360
Mr. Park! Where are you going?

68
00:04:25,427 --> 00:04:26,580
No staff dinner?

69
00:04:26,663 --> 00:04:27,789
I have a prior engagement.

70
00:04:27,872 --> 00:04:29,041
Meeting your girlfriend?

71
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:31,478
(Single in Seoul)

72
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:39,194
He's bordering on
being sentimental and pretentious.

73
00:05:39,736 --> 00:05:41,291
Writers need to be

74
00:05:41,358 --> 00:05:42,905
sentimental and pretentious!

75
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,741
Who recommended him?

76
00:05:45,325 --> 00:05:46,493
I found him myself.

77
00:05:46,576 --> 00:05:48,245
"Searching for single men."

78
00:05:49,246 --> 00:05:51,498
He lives in Seoul
and his posts aren't bad.

79
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:53,500
His place is clean like a hotel.

80
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:56,003
Great food-for-one photos
and recipes.

81
00:05:56,086 --> 00:05:57,046
He takes good pictures.

82
00:05:57,587 --> 00:05:58,963
He has to write well.

83
00:05:59,046 --> 00:06:00,382
We're not publishing pictures.

84
00:06:00,715 --> 00:06:02,509
His writing isn't bad either.

85
00:06:02,592 --> 00:06:04,344
Though it's short, he has sense.

86
00:06:04,427 --> 00:06:06,388
Informative,
sensible, and stylish!

87
00:06:07,764 --> 00:06:10,475
He has everything it takes
to be a good writer!

88
00:06:10,558 --> 00:06:11,643
I'll meet him.

89
00:06:11,934 --> 00:06:14,479
Good decision.
I'm sure you two will get along.

90
00:06:14,562 --> 00:06:16,898
He looks like
a meticulous man

91
00:06:17,774 --> 00:06:20,986
who talks a lot,
but not what's really inside.

92
00:06:21,069 --> 00:06:24,447
He's probably excessively
narcissistic and stubborn.

93
00:06:25,615 --> 00:06:26,765
He's always alone,

94
00:06:26,832 --> 00:06:28,702
so he probably has no friends.

95
00:06:28,785 --> 00:06:30,787
Chief editor Joo...

96
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,373
I bet he's a difficult man.

97
00:06:33,956 --> 00:06:36,418
- Right?
- That's right.

98
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,468
Isn't this great?

99
00:06:44,551 --> 00:06:46,011
We're all alums here.

100
00:06:46,594 --> 00:06:47,804
Right?

101
00:06:48,305 --> 00:06:50,057
It's nice to start off
on a good note!

102
00:06:52,142 --> 00:06:53,768
Young-ho, remember Hyun-jin?

103
00:06:53,851 --> 00:06:55,187
- No.
- Of course!

104
00:06:57,005 --> 00:06:59,107
Young-ho? You don't remember?

105
00:06:59,607 --> 00:07:01,023
That's understandable.

106
00:07:01,106 --> 00:07:02,645
Hyun-jin is not the type

107
00:07:02,712 --> 00:07:05,572
to enflame men's hearts.

108
00:07:05,655 --> 00:07:07,074
What do you mean?

109
00:07:07,157 --> 00:07:09,659
I set them on fire all the time!

110
00:07:10,535 --> 00:07:11,661
You really don't remember me?

111
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,456
Joo Hyun-jin, class of '03?

112
00:07:15,332 --> 00:07:17,376
Back off.

113
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:20,837
That's bad manners.
Apologize and wear your glasses.

114
00:07:21,713 --> 00:07:22,589
Jeez.

115
00:07:22,672 --> 00:07:25,592
I don't remember.
That's why I have no friends.

116
00:07:26,884 --> 00:07:28,637
How can you not remember?

117
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,347
I guess this publishing company
isn't busy?

118
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,598
Yes, we're busy.

119
00:07:32,307 --> 00:07:33,392
I'll get to the point.

120
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:36,103
I don't know
how much you've heard,

121
00:07:36,186 --> 00:07:38,338
but we planned an essay series on

122
00:07:38,405 --> 00:07:41,233
being single in the city.

123
00:07:41,316 --> 00:07:42,341
We have writers for Barcelona,

124
00:07:42,408 --> 00:07:44,736
Seoul, and New York.

125
00:07:45,903 --> 00:07:48,727
But the writer for Seoul

126
00:07:48,794 --> 00:07:49,904
suddenly got pregnant

127
00:07:49,972 --> 00:07:51,659
and can't write
about being single, so...

128
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:54,704
So you're asking me to sub in?

129
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:56,915
No! Let me explain.

130
00:07:56,999 --> 00:07:58,042
Yes, it's a sub.

131
00:07:59,334 --> 00:08:00,919
But it's not like
we choose just anyone.

132
00:08:01,003 --> 00:08:03,003
While looking
for a suitable writer,

133
00:08:03,086 --> 00:08:05,215
Boss showed us
your social media

134
00:08:05,298 --> 00:08:06,674
and our editing team agreed.

135
00:08:07,342 --> 00:08:11,221
How about saying impressed
rather than agreed?

136
00:08:11,304 --> 00:08:14,224
Not quite impressed,
but we liked what we saw.

137
00:08:14,307 --> 00:08:15,932
We'll discuss on how to make
good use out of your social media.

138
00:08:16,016 --> 00:08:17,727
We'll discuss on how to make
good use out of your social media.

139
00:08:21,006 --> 00:08:23,233
You said
you wanted to be a writer.

140
00:08:25,402 --> 00:08:26,442
Because I don't want to deal with

141
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:28,488
people like her.

142
00:08:28,571 --> 00:08:29,656
I want to work on my own.

143
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,327
Writers don't publish books alone.

144
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:36,163
Ever seen a book
without an editor?

145
00:08:36,246 --> 00:08:38,331
Even the Bible has an editor.

146
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,672
Is there another editor?

147
00:08:45,755 --> 00:08:46,923
Listen.

148
00:08:49,634 --> 00:08:52,637
She may talk without thinking,

149
00:08:52,704 --> 00:08:54,931
but she's the best editor.

150
00:08:55,765 --> 00:08:57,976
She's really good at her job.

151
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:00,395
- Look.
- Thank you.

152
00:09:00,478 --> 00:09:04,649
- She's a smart gal.
- Oh, no! Darn it!

153
00:09:07,277 --> 00:09:08,774
She's different when she works.

154
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:10,238
I swear.

155
00:09:11,031 --> 00:09:14,201
Now, let's summarize
what we've learned so far.

156
00:09:14,284 --> 00:09:17,871
Essays aren't written with magic
but logic.

157
00:09:17,954 --> 00:09:19,414
It means there's a formula.

158
00:09:19,497 --> 00:09:21,166
Or else, it's wrong,
not different.

159
00:09:21,249 --> 00:09:23,585
Your unique style
is not respected in essays.

160
00:09:23,668 --> 00:09:26,253
Just follow my methods

161
00:09:26,336 --> 00:09:28,882
and I'll make sure
you learn the tips

162
00:09:28,966 --> 00:09:33,428
to target the best universities
in the country.

163
00:09:36,473 --> 00:09:37,724
What?

164
00:09:37,807 --> 00:09:40,227
He talks well like a show host.

165
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:43,063
He's got the tone
to keep listeners glued.

166
00:09:43,146 --> 00:09:44,898
He's not boring,
but very informative.

167
00:09:44,982 --> 00:09:47,164
He pushes and pulls

168
00:09:47,231 --> 00:09:47,985
to keep people's attention.

169
00:09:48,526 --> 00:09:49,778
He can't be boring,

170
00:09:49,845 --> 00:09:52,822
not with a face like that.

171
00:09:53,991 --> 00:09:54,992
You think?

172
00:09:55,742 --> 00:09:57,327
I guess he's good looking.

173
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:58,412
That's a warning, ma'am!

174
00:09:59,496 --> 00:10:01,581
That's judging
a book by its cover!

175
00:10:06,669 --> 00:10:08,171
I'm suddenly so bored.

176
00:10:20,892 --> 00:10:21,934
Hello?

177
00:10:25,022 --> 00:10:26,731
What is it this time?

178
00:10:27,857 --> 00:10:29,985
I was just thinking about you.

179
00:10:32,862 --> 00:10:36,283
What do you mean?
Of course people read books!

180
00:10:37,325 --> 00:10:39,327
Is he having an affair?

181
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:43,999
Who put liquor in here?

182
00:10:48,711 --> 00:10:49,787
Look through the project plan,

183
00:10:49,854 --> 00:10:51,073
then decide if you'll do it.

184
00:11:03,476 --> 00:11:06,688
(Publishing Plan)

185
00:11:14,404 --> 00:11:16,948
Isn't it great?

186
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,950
It's nice.

187
00:11:19,576 --> 00:11:21,328
The mountain is...

188
00:11:21,411 --> 00:11:23,496
Overall,
it's convincingly written.

189
00:11:26,749 --> 00:11:28,585
Are you okay
with the chapter plans?

190
00:11:28,668 --> 00:11:30,892
Things like walking, resting,

191
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,006
eating, and living alone in Seoul

192
00:11:32,089 --> 00:11:33,923
need to be shown
in an intuitive way.

193
00:11:34,341 --> 00:11:35,477
Writer Hong has agreed to write

194
00:11:35,544 --> 00:11:37,094
on Barcelona like this, too.

195
00:11:38,136 --> 00:11:40,680
It's primitive but not bad.

196
00:11:40,763 --> 00:11:42,432
Anything else you don't like?

197
00:11:43,266 --> 00:11:44,267
Lots.

198
00:11:44,934 --> 00:11:46,268
You changed
"It's good to be alone"

199
00:11:46,351 --> 00:11:48,271
to "It's okay to be alone."

200
00:11:49,064 --> 00:11:50,524
That changes the tone of my book.

201
00:11:50,607 --> 00:11:53,652
Yes. I'm asking you
to change the tone.

202
00:11:53,735 --> 00:11:56,613
I can't because
I don't agree with that.

203
00:11:57,197 --> 00:11:59,033
Even if I did,

204
00:11:59,116 --> 00:12:00,026
I won't say singles must live well

205
00:12:00,093 --> 00:12:02,202
to live well with others later.

206
00:12:02,285 --> 00:12:03,806
That's too cliche.

207
00:12:03,873 --> 00:12:04,871
You expect me to say that too?

208
00:12:04,954 --> 00:12:05,872
Why?

209
00:12:05,955 --> 00:12:08,250
There's probably a reason why
everyone says that.

210
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:09,626
No one is completely alone.

211
00:12:10,585 --> 00:12:13,172
Right.
We're not alone from birth.

212
00:12:14,631 --> 00:12:15,623
I mean

213
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:18,135
people can live
with minimal relationships.

214
00:12:19,011 --> 00:12:20,092
And "it's okay" sounds like

215
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:22,431
you're consoling.

216
00:12:22,514 --> 00:12:26,683
I think you need to be
alone to be evolved,

217
00:12:26,766 --> 00:12:27,936
especially men.

218
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,468
You know you can't add stuff

219
00:12:29,535 --> 00:12:31,856
like "especially for men", right?

220
00:12:33,066 --> 00:12:34,942
Okay. I'll watch that.

221
00:12:35,652 --> 00:12:37,154
But I'm not changing my mind.

222
00:12:37,904 --> 00:12:39,406
It's true that it's good
to be alone.

223
00:12:39,489 --> 00:12:41,658
It may be true,
but it's not a fact.

224
00:12:41,741 --> 00:12:44,369
It's more like a twisted truth
through your life.

225
00:12:47,289 --> 00:12:49,611
Twisted truth?

226
00:12:49,678 --> 00:12:50,250
Where'd you get that idea?

227
00:12:51,834 --> 00:12:52,874
You want me to change my ideas

228
00:12:52,941 --> 00:12:53,920
to yours?

229
00:12:54,837 --> 00:12:56,256
What are you, a dictator?

230
00:12:57,424 --> 00:12:59,051
Or are you power tripping?

231
00:12:59,134 --> 00:13:01,511
The writer has the upper hand
in our contracts.

232
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:03,930
(Publishing Contract)

233
00:13:06,683 --> 00:13:07,601
I have the upper hand?

234
00:13:11,521 --> 00:13:14,607
Will you stamp it or not?

235
00:13:15,733 --> 00:13:17,319
It's good to be alone, no!

236
00:13:17,402 --> 00:13:18,778
It's okay even if you're alone?

237
00:13:21,281 --> 00:13:22,699
How about it's okay to be alone?

238
00:13:23,908 --> 00:13:26,120
Fine.
We need different views.

239
00:13:26,536 --> 00:13:28,288
I'll stamp it later.

240
00:13:28,788 --> 00:13:30,290
I need more time.

241
00:13:30,373 --> 00:13:31,583
But we don't have time.

242
00:13:32,542 --> 00:13:34,128
If you don't want to...

243
00:13:34,836 --> 00:13:35,890
Who says I don't?

244
00:13:35,957 --> 00:13:37,547
Then stamp it now, please.

245
00:13:38,465 --> 00:13:41,385
If you don't have your stamp,
you can sign it.

246
00:13:49,517 --> 00:13:50,900
I thought you didn't want to,

247
00:13:50,968 --> 00:13:52,062
but you've prepared a lot.

248
00:13:57,734 --> 00:13:59,424
I can take a taxi home.

249
00:13:59,491 --> 00:14:00,820
No need to drive me.

250
00:14:00,903 --> 00:14:02,114
I don't want to impose.

251
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:04,975
It's on the way.

252
00:14:05,042 --> 00:14:06,743
I'm not the type
to beat around the bush.

253
00:14:07,494 --> 00:14:08,495
Okay.

254
00:14:08,996 --> 00:14:10,738
Going on a blind date today?

255
00:14:10,805 --> 00:14:12,207
Your makeup seems different too.

256
00:14:12,957 --> 00:14:15,252
Your heels are too high.
Be careful or you'll fall.

257
00:14:16,128 --> 00:14:16,978
For someone who likes singlehood,

258
00:14:17,045 --> 00:14:18,755
why so much interest in others?

259
00:14:18,838 --> 00:14:20,173
Just saying what I noticed.

260
00:14:20,632 --> 00:14:22,341
Your skin tone is cool,

261
00:14:22,424 --> 00:14:25,262
so instead of orange,
try pink tones.

262
00:14:26,054 --> 00:14:27,305
Nice car.

263
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:32,727
I love this car in red!

264
00:14:36,523 --> 00:14:37,482
Hop in.

265
00:14:45,448 --> 00:14:46,450
How can a girl be so...

266
00:14:46,533 --> 00:14:48,060
No derogatory remarks, remember?

267
00:14:49,952 --> 00:14:52,039
Okay. I won't!

268
00:14:52,122 --> 00:14:53,056
But no one should do this

269
00:14:53,123 --> 00:14:55,292
to a car.

270
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:56,876
Jeez.

271
00:14:58,336 --> 00:15:00,297
What are you doing?
It's bothering me.

272
00:15:02,674 --> 00:15:05,219
What about this?
This doesn't bother you?

273
00:15:05,635 --> 00:15:06,928
What's your address?

274
00:15:07,595 --> 00:15:09,089
Just drop me off

275
00:15:09,156 --> 00:15:10,182
at the nearest subway station.

276
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,895
Are you using this
as an air freshener?

277
00:15:17,314 --> 00:15:18,983
You don't live in
this car, do you?

278
00:15:19,649 --> 00:15:21,026
Please stop.

279
00:15:21,109 --> 00:15:22,235
Leave it.

280
00:15:22,302 --> 00:15:24,404
I have things organized my way.

281
00:15:24,487 --> 00:15:26,740
People who don't organize
always say that.

282
00:15:26,823 --> 00:15:29,076
You lied about
not remembering me, right?

283
00:15:31,619 --> 00:15:32,233
If not,

284
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,621
why do you talk
like you've known me?

285
00:15:36,124 --> 00:15:37,125
You remember.

286
00:15:56,186 --> 00:15:57,229
Knock-knock.

287
00:16:00,565 --> 00:16:01,774
Hello.

288
00:16:02,525 --> 00:16:04,111
Were you busy last week?

289
00:16:04,486 --> 00:16:06,238
We need you to come

290
00:16:06,321 --> 00:16:08,823
to remind us it's Wednesday.

291
00:16:09,491 --> 00:16:10,324
Since you didn't come,

292
00:16:10,391 --> 00:16:12,035
the week felt so long.

293
00:16:12,869 --> 00:16:14,121
Oh, really?

294
00:16:15,413 --> 00:16:16,743
Thanks for the review on Instagram

295
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,625
about our book, 'The Prophet'.

296
00:16:19,292 --> 00:16:20,710
We got more attention
thanks to you.

297
00:16:22,754 --> 00:16:26,258
That was your company's book?
It figures.

298
00:16:26,341 --> 00:16:27,255
The book was great.

299
00:16:27,322 --> 00:16:28,760
I couldn't help raving about it.

300
00:16:29,261 --> 00:16:30,200
How can I ever thank you

301
00:16:30,267 --> 00:16:30,971
for all your help?

302
00:16:31,554 --> 00:16:32,542
No worries.

303
00:16:32,609 --> 00:16:34,266
How about a cup of coffee?

304
00:16:35,475 --> 00:16:38,728
He's so cute.

305
00:16:39,562 --> 00:16:41,938
See? It's a greenlight, right?

306
00:16:42,022 --> 00:16:45,402
So did you go out for coffee
with him or not?

307
00:16:47,362 --> 00:16:49,031
I sent him a coffee coupon.

308
00:16:49,614 --> 00:16:50,827
Are you kidding me?

309
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:54,494
It's so obviously a greenlight.

310
00:16:55,245 --> 00:16:57,124
I thought I'd play
a little hard to get.

311
00:16:57,414 --> 00:16:59,457
Wanna change it to a redlight?

312
00:17:00,917 --> 00:17:03,345
Did he ask you out

313
00:17:03,412 --> 00:17:04,671
or go to bed with him?

314
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:08,048
He just asked for a cup of coffee.

315
00:17:08,131 --> 00:17:10,593
Why play hard to get?

316
00:17:11,053 --> 00:17:14,429
He's not completely my type,

317
00:17:14,512 --> 00:17:16,353
but he makes me curious.

318
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:19,546
But Sun-woo lives in Bundang.

319
00:17:19,613 --> 00:17:20,317
That's a bit far.

320
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,858
Don't go overboard.

321
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,650
Stop imagining things.

322
00:17:24,066 --> 00:17:25,692
Soon, you'll be naming his baby.

323
00:17:25,775 --> 00:17:28,905
You should've seen
the way Sun-woo looked at me.

324
00:17:31,614 --> 00:17:33,830
Remember that coffee shop?

325
00:17:33,913 --> 00:17:36,457
You saw
a man fold a piece of paper

326
00:17:36,524 --> 00:17:37,997
and leave it behind.

327
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,188
You got so flustered and wondered

328
00:17:40,255 --> 00:17:42,042
if you should date him or not.

329
00:17:43,293 --> 00:17:44,294
I did?

330
00:17:46,129 --> 00:17:47,884
It turned out to be the receipt.

331
00:17:49,049 --> 00:17:53,140
Why did the jerk
fold his receipt and leave it?

332
00:17:53,223 --> 00:17:54,429
Remember?

333
00:17:54,512 --> 00:17:56,257
You have a good memory.

334
00:17:56,324 --> 00:17:57,434
It was so long ago.

335
00:17:57,517 --> 00:17:58,976
It was last summer.

336
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,808
And that spinning instructor!

337
00:18:01,891 --> 00:18:04,689
He liked me!
He was just really shy.

338
00:18:04,772 --> 00:18:05,774
Hello! Go in.

339
00:18:05,857 --> 00:18:07,059
If he's so shy,

340
00:18:07,126 --> 00:18:09,402
why'd he bring 20 people
to dinner on you?

341
00:18:11,111 --> 00:18:12,029
There is more.

342
00:18:12,822 --> 00:18:13,900
That guy...

343
00:18:13,984 --> 00:18:15,662
You said he looks like
a handsome Middle Eastern man.

344
00:18:16,994 --> 00:18:19,496
You bought a jade mat from him!

345
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:22,829
That was ages ago.

346
00:18:25,752 --> 00:18:27,670
I have no luck in dating.

347
00:18:31,591 --> 00:18:33,260
You think it's luck?

348
00:18:34,386 --> 00:18:37,764
You grow apart without
ever getting close to men.

349
00:18:37,847 --> 00:18:40,637
Don't you think that's weird?

350
00:18:41,518 --> 00:18:42,894
Look at all these great books!

351
00:18:45,022 --> 00:18:48,275
How's business?
How much do you make per day?

352
00:18:48,358 --> 00:18:49,486
Is this a tax audit?

353
00:18:50,193 --> 00:18:51,361
Why do you want to know?

354
00:18:52,404 --> 00:18:54,321
Don't you want to come back
to editing?

355
00:18:54,781 --> 00:18:57,325
I hated editing so much.

356
00:18:58,994 --> 00:19:00,912
Now that I stopped doing it,
I realized

357
00:19:01,913 --> 00:19:02,960
it totally sucked.

358
00:19:04,374 --> 00:19:05,372
By the way,

359
00:19:05,455 --> 00:19:07,836
how about Young-ho,
the new writer?

360
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,087
You heard?
He signed on yesterday.

361
00:19:10,713 --> 00:19:11,798
Really?

362
00:19:11,881 --> 00:19:14,384
Was Young-ho close with the boss?

363
00:19:14,467 --> 00:19:15,759
I think they met at
alumni gatherings and such.

364
00:19:15,842 --> 00:19:16,803
I think they met at
alumni gatherings and such.

365
00:19:16,886 --> 00:19:19,766
Then why did he insist on him?

366
00:19:21,224 --> 00:19:22,389
(Publishing Plan)

367
00:19:24,061 --> 00:19:26,483
Oh my gosh! What is this?

368
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:28,049
A contract?

369
00:19:28,116 --> 00:19:30,317
- Were you scouted?
- No.

370
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,279
A publishing company?

371
00:19:33,236 --> 00:19:34,191
You're publishing a book?

372
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:38,658
- Just a short essay book.
- Wow!

373
00:19:38,741 --> 00:19:42,412
The small publishing company
begged for my help.

374
00:19:43,205 --> 00:19:45,292
But please don't mention this
to our director.

375
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,877
Of course, I won't.

376
00:19:53,323 --> 00:19:55,092
Hi, Mr. Park.

377
00:19:57,677 --> 00:19:59,723
- You're writing an essay book?
- What?

378
00:20:00,538 --> 00:20:01,808
That jerk.

379
00:20:01,891 --> 00:20:03,390
It's okay!

380
00:20:03,978 --> 00:20:06,183
It'll mention
our tutoring school, right?

381
00:20:06,769 --> 00:20:10,151
- Then you'll mention me too?
- No, don't worry.

382
00:20:10,234 --> 00:20:11,728
It's okay. You can write me in.

383
00:20:13,988 --> 00:20:15,739
Let me know
if you need my picture.

384
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:18,822
It's okay. Write it well.

385
00:20:18,905 --> 00:20:20,494
I'll root for your essay.

386
00:20:36,796 --> 00:20:38,215
Dad! What's wrong?

387
00:20:43,433 --> 00:20:45,185
Will you take a picture
of me doing planks?

388
00:20:51,271 --> 00:20:53,319
What's wrong with this screen?

389
00:20:53,402 --> 00:20:54,611
It's a photo effect.

390
00:20:55,445 --> 00:20:57,697
The pictures turn out
cute with that.

391
00:21:04,621 --> 00:21:05,705
Give me my phone.

392
00:21:08,999 --> 00:21:10,794
Your fiance likes muscular men?

393
00:21:12,587 --> 00:21:13,880
Hyun-jin.

394
00:21:14,631 --> 00:21:17,240
You don't exercise to show others.

395
00:21:17,801 --> 00:21:19,346
You do it for your health.

396
00:21:19,761 --> 00:21:21,071
Then why add photo effects

397
00:21:21,138 --> 00:21:22,389
to your pictures?

398
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,768
That's in trend these days.

399
00:21:27,057 --> 00:21:30,687
I guess late love affairs
are scary.

400
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:33,317
Love affairs are scary
early or late in life.

401
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,317
You have a lot of energy, huh?

402
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,986
Then use that to cook for me.

403
00:21:37,069 --> 00:21:38,926
People will make fun of me

404
00:21:38,994 --> 00:21:41,032
if I cook for my grown daughter.

405
00:21:41,115 --> 00:21:43,742
Says who? You'll be complimented
for being caring.

406
00:21:49,748 --> 00:21:50,832
Hello?

407
00:21:54,211 --> 00:21:55,842
I just set the table for Hyun-jin

408
00:21:55,909 --> 00:21:58,507
and started reading a book.

409
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:59,758
Oh, my.

410
00:21:59,841 --> 00:22:02,094
I just made some soup and eggs.

411
00:22:03,762 --> 00:22:04,972
A caring father? Oh, please.

412
00:22:05,639 --> 00:22:07,058
Hyun-jin!

413
00:22:07,141 --> 00:22:09,334
You're getting ready
to move out, right?

Those who don't live alone,
you're all guilty!

419
00:22:42,784 --> 00:22:43,825
Has there ever been a time

420
00:22:43,892 --> 00:22:46,388
humans have lived more well-off?

421
00:22:47,164 --> 00:22:49,065
We have great food,
clothing, shelter,

422
00:22:49,132 --> 00:22:51,101
transportation and Internet.

423
00:22:51,726 --> 00:22:53,561
Then what about
the happiness index?

424
00:22:54,771 --> 00:22:57,064
Ironically,
people are living under

425
00:22:57,147 --> 00:22:58,816
more dissatisfaction and stress.

426
00:22:59,442 --> 00:23:00,610
Why?

427
00:23:00,693 --> 00:23:03,860
Because we have less time alone.

428
00:23:03,943 --> 00:23:05,574
Yes, right here.

429
00:23:05,657 --> 00:23:08,075
We live alongside others all day

430
00:23:08,158 --> 00:23:11,413
as someone's client, co-worker,
or teacher.

431
00:23:11,496 --> 00:23:13,170
We play so many different roles.

432
00:23:13,623 --> 00:23:16,168
There is not enough time
for you to be yourself.

433
00:23:17,044 --> 00:23:19,126
Even at home, do you want to be
someone's lover,

434
00:23:19,209 --> 00:23:21,756
husband, parent, son-in-law,
or brother-in-law?

435
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:24,511
Don't change for someone else.

436
00:23:24,594 --> 00:23:26,223
If you want to be yourself,

437
00:23:27,304 --> 00:23:28,885
singlehood is the answer.

438
00:23:29,431 --> 00:23:30,347
The answer?

439
00:23:31,308 --> 00:23:33,560
This is so frustrating.

440
00:23:34,477 --> 00:23:36,521
Is there something wrong
with Mr. Park's draft?

441
00:23:36,604 --> 00:23:37,644
Way too many.

442
00:23:38,148 --> 00:23:39,939
I asked him to write intuitively,
but he's too resolute.

443
00:23:40,023 --> 00:23:41,778
I asked him to write intuitively,
but he's too resolute.

444
00:23:41,861 --> 00:23:44,031
He's an instructor all right.

445
00:23:44,114 --> 00:23:45,447
He asks questions
and gives the answers.

446
00:23:47,032 --> 00:23:48,865
- Did Ms. Hong send her draft?
- Yes.

447
00:23:55,457 --> 00:23:58,376
Things don't change much
in the city of Barcelona.

448
00:23:59,336 --> 00:24:02,755
It takes several centuries
to build a church here.

449
00:24:03,423 --> 00:24:05,924
The unchanging city gives
a sense of security

450
00:24:06,008 --> 00:24:08,428
with many passing people.

451
00:24:08,511 --> 00:24:10,146
To enjoy short relationships

452
00:24:10,213 --> 00:24:12,141
without changing myself,

453
00:24:12,224 --> 00:24:14,768
this is the most suitable city.

454
00:24:14,851 --> 00:24:16,061
I'm jealous.

455
00:24:17,562 --> 00:24:19,064
I knew it.

456
00:24:19,147 --> 00:24:21,899
Ms. Hong's draft is easy
and catchy.

457
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:25,242
That's why I chose her.

458
00:24:25,325 --> 00:24:27,447
But her tone is so different
from Young-ho's.

459
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:30,657
That's why I chose you.

460
00:24:31,534 --> 00:24:35,082
Listen. Ask him to write about his
first love too.

461
00:24:36,206 --> 00:24:37,928
He has a first love?

462
00:24:37,996 --> 00:24:39,456
Wasn't he a born single?

463
00:24:39,876 --> 00:24:43,380
Nope. He can't be a single.

464
00:24:44,381 --> 00:24:45,592
He's never been single before.

465
00:24:57,394 --> 00:25:00,814
First love? It's not fun.

466
00:25:00,897 --> 00:25:01,912
Why do people always rave

467
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,525
about first love stories?

468
00:25:03,608 --> 00:25:06,153
They've probably never been
someone's first love.

469
00:25:06,236 --> 00:25:08,197
That's why they're curious.

470
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,740
Try writing about it.
I think it'll be interesting.

471
00:25:11,408 --> 00:25:12,289
You know

472
00:25:12,372 --> 00:25:15,495
that's like telling a vegetarian
to write about having meat.

473
00:25:16,163 --> 00:25:17,600
Don't write about having meat,

474
00:25:17,667 --> 00:25:20,167
but quitting meat.

475
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:21,275
There must be a reason

476
00:25:21,342 --> 00:25:22,294
why they turned vegetarian.

477
00:25:30,218 --> 00:25:31,428
Can you step aside?

478
00:25:31,928 --> 00:25:33,930
You said you voluntarily
quit dating.

479
00:25:35,098 --> 00:25:37,684
Dating? First love?
I don't even remember.

480
00:25:42,064 --> 00:25:43,398
It works well still.

481
00:25:46,568 --> 00:25:47,850
I'll leave this

482
00:25:47,917 --> 00:25:49,654
since you bought it for me.

483
00:25:51,448 --> 00:25:53,866
No, just take it.

484
00:25:54,951 --> 00:25:56,733
Take your watch

485
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,230
and half-burned candle too.

486
00:25:59,372 --> 00:26:03,210
Take your Ugg boots
and everything else.

487
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:06,883
You should
re-wallpaper this place.

488
00:26:06,967 --> 00:26:09,132
Worry about your fiance's house!

489
00:26:10,467 --> 00:26:11,888
What's the reason?

490
00:26:11,972 --> 00:26:14,929
You're too kind.

491
00:26:17,724 --> 00:26:19,309
I'll be better.

492
00:26:20,268 --> 00:26:23,100
See? You're too kind.

493
00:26:26,733 --> 00:26:27,901
What?

494
00:26:27,985 --> 00:26:29,402
I found another man.

495
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,608
Love is like a car accident.

496
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,410
What damn car accident!

497
00:26:33,493 --> 00:26:34,661
Will you splash it on me?

498
00:26:36,576 --> 00:26:38,996
You were that bad of a loser?

499
00:26:39,704 --> 00:26:41,328
Maybe there were other reasons?

500
00:26:42,332 --> 00:26:44,671
Was it like that
with your first love, too?

501
00:26:47,629 --> 00:26:48,545
Probably not.

502
00:26:49,214 --> 00:26:50,968
Was it a traumatic first love?

503
00:26:51,508 --> 00:26:53,301
Don't get any ideas.

504
00:26:53,969 --> 00:26:55,553
There's no such thing
as my first love.

505
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,974
Move.

506
00:27:01,184 --> 00:27:03,600
- I heard there is.
- Says who?

507
00:27:04,062 --> 00:27:05,102
My boss.

508
00:27:06,606 --> 00:27:07,607
Dammit.

Park Young-ho, born in Seoul.

511
00:27:25,875 --> 00:27:27,377
You don't have any experience?

512
00:27:28,503 --> 00:27:30,587
No, it's my first job.

513
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:32,091
Are you a student?

514
00:27:32,174 --> 00:27:35,052
I'm a Korean Literature major.

515
00:27:38,388 --> 00:27:39,806
Hello.

516
00:27:40,265 --> 00:27:41,391
You're here early.

517
00:27:41,474 --> 00:27:42,618
He's here for an interview.

518
00:27:42,685 --> 00:27:43,643
He's a university student.

519
00:27:43,726 --> 00:27:44,811
Thanks.

520
00:27:47,564 --> 00:27:48,898
- You're a student?
- Yes.

521
00:27:49,566 --> 00:27:50,319
A highly educated worker

522
00:27:50,386 --> 00:27:51,734
for a laundry room job, huh?

523
00:27:53,361 --> 00:27:55,572
Who was that lady?

524
00:27:55,655 --> 00:27:57,199
Ms. Hong?

525
00:27:57,282 --> 00:27:58,865
You'll be working with her.

526
00:27:59,242 --> 00:28:00,721
She started a week ago.

527
00:28:00,788 --> 00:28:01,996
She's your senior.

528
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:03,660
What senior? It's just a week.

529
00:28:04,831 --> 00:28:05,832
How about sushi?

530
00:28:20,097 --> 00:28:21,388
That's my spot.

531
00:28:23,266 --> 00:28:25,682
- You owe me one.
- What?

532
00:28:29,189 --> 00:28:30,190
What are you reading?

533
00:28:31,108 --> 00:28:32,109
Oh, no!

534
00:28:37,317 --> 00:28:38,573
Haruki's book.

535
00:28:39,782 --> 00:28:41,498
If it's good, lend it to me?

536
00:28:41,581 --> 00:28:43,203
Sure. I will when I'm done.

537
00:28:46,164 --> 00:28:47,499
Your hands are swollen.

538
00:29:00,012 --> 00:29:01,886
Your hands can get ruined here.

539
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:02,973
Put lotion on often.

540
00:29:06,143 --> 00:29:08,103
There is lotion
all over the hotel.

544
00:29:27,127 --> 00:29:28,498
But you started a week earlier!

545
00:30:25,722 --> 00:30:26,763
Happy birthday.

546
00:30:27,724 --> 00:30:28,725
Thanks.

547
00:31:12,269 --> 00:31:15,063
So? What happened next?

548
00:31:17,524 --> 00:31:19,859
- What?
- I read your draft.

549
00:31:19,942 --> 00:31:22,071
Your first love story
is honest and interesting.

550
00:31:22,154 --> 00:31:23,991
But there's got to be more, right?

551
00:31:24,074 --> 00:31:25,240
That's it.

552
00:31:26,949 --> 00:31:29,519
This is where the readers
get more curious.

553
00:31:33,206 --> 00:31:34,666
Aren't you the one who's curious?

554
00:31:34,749 --> 00:31:36,373
Yes, I'm curious too.

555
00:31:37,377 --> 00:31:39,376
A writer who makes
an editor curious!

556
00:31:39,879 --> 00:31:40,964
Forget it. Bye.

557
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:53,230
Jeez.

558
00:31:57,272 --> 00:32:01,151
Anyway, my writing
made her curious, huh?

559
00:32:11,161 --> 00:32:13,000
Why? What part is funny?

560
00:32:13,955 --> 00:32:14,831
I just read here

561
00:32:14,898 --> 00:32:16,583
a conversation we had.

562
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:23,460
I'll read the rest tomorrow.

563
00:32:23,543 --> 00:32:26,468
Okay.

564
00:32:27,427 --> 00:32:31,268
- Is it boring?
- No. I need to rest.

565
00:32:40,857 --> 00:32:43,318
Stop feeding the cat.

566
00:32:44,236 --> 00:32:46,153
Stray cats have a lifespan
of 2 or 3 years.

567
00:32:47,489 --> 00:32:48,905
I should feed it while I can.

568
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,582
Don't eat sushi on rainy days.

569
00:32:55,665 --> 00:32:58,875
- Sushi, please!
- Meat!

570
00:33:03,505 --> 00:33:05,715
Please go ahead.
I'll be right there.

571
00:33:05,798 --> 00:33:06,841
Sure.

572
00:33:09,886 --> 00:33:10,847
Why'd you come?

573
00:33:12,055 --> 00:33:13,600
We promised to watch
a movie tonight.

574
00:33:14,474 --> 00:33:15,932
Wasn't that tomorrow?

575
00:33:16,893 --> 00:33:19,396
Sorry, I have a staff dinner now.

576
00:33:21,064 --> 00:33:22,939
Let's talk later at home.

577
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,498
Chief!

578
00:33:42,752 --> 00:33:43,750
Young-ho!

579
00:33:44,254 --> 00:33:46,213
Long time no see.
How are you?

580
00:33:46,923 --> 00:33:49,172
- Where's Joo-ok?
- Ms. Hong?

581
00:33:49,482 --> 00:33:51,008
She quit a while ago.

582
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,306
I should go.

583
00:34:05,108 --> 00:34:09,779
Foolishly, I went through several
fiery relationships

584
00:34:09,862 --> 00:34:11,568
and ended back at square one.

585
00:34:12,282 --> 00:34:14,172
I thought maybe I'm not meant

586
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:17,428
to have relationships.

587
00:34:17,495 --> 00:34:18,372
(Order completed)

588
00:34:18,455 --> 00:34:20,627
Soon, something
miraculous happened.

589
00:34:21,791 --> 00:34:23,507
The world helps those

590
00:34:23,574 --> 00:34:25,002
who spend on themselves.

591
00:34:25,712 --> 00:34:28,340
With the online shopping points
I used to buy women gifts,

592
00:34:28,423 --> 00:34:30,387
I gave a gift to myself
for the first time.

593
00:34:30,842 --> 00:34:31,864
Then,

594
00:34:31,931 --> 00:34:33,345
a whole new world
opened up before me.

595
00:34:34,471 --> 00:34:35,459
Investments in a relationship

596
00:34:35,526 --> 00:34:39,684
like money, time, and effort,

597
00:34:39,767 --> 00:34:42,062
I decided to use
on myself instead.

598
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:45,362
Have you ever
bought yourself a ring?

599
00:34:45,445 --> 00:34:47,067
How about a watch?

600
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,986
Or AAA steak just for yourself?

601
00:34:49,569 --> 00:34:50,730
Efforts for yourself

602
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:52,199
will never let you down.

603
00:34:52,282 --> 00:34:53,528
I wanted caramel popcorn.

604
00:34:53,595 --> 00:34:55,200
Why get cheese popcorn?

605
00:34:55,283 --> 00:34:57,466
You said you like cheese popcorn.

606
00:34:57,749 --> 00:34:59,038
Fine, I'll go exchange it.

607
00:34:59,121 --> 00:35:01,415
Forget it. You eat it all.

608
00:35:01,498 --> 00:35:02,470
Only when you're alone,

609
00:35:02,537 --> 00:35:03,333
you can see

610
00:35:04,251 --> 00:35:07,921
who you are, your tastes,
and your emotions.

611
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:08,990
When you're no longer judged

612
00:35:09,057 --> 00:35:11,174
by your background,

613
00:35:11,549 --> 00:35:13,383
you find out what you hate

614
00:35:13,466 --> 00:35:15,720
and what makes you happy.

615
00:35:22,812 --> 00:35:24,691
(Young-ho loves Young-ho)

616
00:35:25,272 --> 00:35:27,107
I want to ask couples out there.

617
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:29,859
When was the last time
you felt excited?

618
00:35:31,194 --> 00:35:33,863
As a single, I'm excited all day.

619
00:35:34,697 --> 00:35:35,907
Every day is a celebration!

620
00:35:56,261 --> 00:35:57,470
Hello?

621
00:35:58,596 --> 00:35:59,954
Let's push our meeting back
an hour.

622
00:36:00,022 --> 00:36:01,308
I'm house hunting now.

623
00:36:01,975 --> 00:36:03,601
Will one hour be enough for that?

624
00:36:04,436 --> 00:36:06,854
Of course.
They're pretty much the same.

625
00:36:08,148 --> 00:36:09,691
No, they are not!

626
00:36:12,402 --> 00:36:14,361
Where are you now?

627
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,324
The sunlight!

628
00:36:17,949 --> 00:36:18,905
Please take a look.

629
00:36:19,451 --> 00:36:21,618
It's cloudy today,
but this faces south.

630
00:36:22,537 --> 00:36:25,060
Imagine standing here in the sun

631
00:36:25,127 --> 00:36:27,084
with a Starbuck's coffee in hand.

632
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,256
It's nice.

633
00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:30,920
Actually...

634
00:36:31,004 --> 00:36:32,131
You can look inside.

635
00:36:32,214 --> 00:36:34,883
At a price like this,
it won't last long.

636
00:36:34,967 --> 00:36:36,843
It could be leased
in a few hours.

637
00:36:36,926 --> 00:36:38,012
It could be leased soon?

638
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:39,136
Here's the last room.

639
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,764
Ta-da!

640
00:36:43,766 --> 00:36:45,932
It's noisy.

641
00:36:46,016 --> 00:36:47,271
That's nothing.

642
00:36:47,354 --> 00:36:48,909
It's a new condo,

643
00:36:48,977 --> 00:36:51,318
so they left the window open
for fresh air.

644
00:36:51,401 --> 00:36:54,531
It's a double pane window.

645
00:36:54,614 --> 00:36:58,406
If you close it like this,
it's so quiet.

646
00:36:59,992 --> 00:37:02,119
But you need
some background noise.

647
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:04,654
White noise helps

648
00:37:04,721 --> 00:37:06,623
with sleeping.

649
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,542
How about this?

650
00:37:08,625 --> 00:37:14,297
I'll ask for a new door lock
and bidet here.

651
00:37:15,548 --> 00:37:18,927
That's a lot of money.
It's a great deal, you know.

652
00:37:19,011 --> 00:37:21,930
A door lock and bidet
sound nice,

653
00:37:22,014 --> 00:37:23,681
but we'll keep looking.

654
00:37:25,933 --> 00:37:28,265
Right.
Thank you.

655
00:37:30,105 --> 00:37:31,856
Scratch this place off.

656
00:37:31,939 --> 00:37:34,401
There are 6 units here
with hardly any parking.

657
00:37:34,484 --> 00:37:35,902
Only 3 cars will fit here.

658
00:37:35,986 --> 00:37:37,221
It's okay during the day,

659
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:38,905
but what happens after work?

660
00:37:38,989 --> 00:37:40,324
A parking war.

661
00:37:40,407 --> 00:37:42,358
And why do you need an elevator

662
00:37:42,425 --> 00:37:43,202
when you're young?

663
00:37:43,285 --> 00:37:44,138
Just take the stairs.

664
00:37:44,205 --> 00:37:45,245
It'll give you more square footage.

665
00:37:45,953 --> 00:37:47,206
See that streetlamp?

666
00:37:47,289 --> 00:37:49,957
You won't be able to sleep
at night because of that.

667
00:37:55,964 --> 00:37:56,994
You can rent a 2-bedroom unit

668
00:37:57,061 --> 00:37:59,634
without paying a realtor.

669
00:37:59,717 --> 00:38:02,191
Daylight, draft, water pressure
and transportation

670
00:38:02,258 --> 00:38:03,763
are important,

671
00:38:03,846 --> 00:38:06,808
but it'll be hard to find a place
that checks off all the boxes.

672
00:38:06,891 --> 00:38:09,066
You have to prioritize

673
00:38:09,133 --> 00:38:10,687
what is more or less important.

674
00:38:11,646 --> 00:38:13,730
Get your deliveries
using a man's name.

675
00:38:14,149 --> 00:38:17,970
Use rough sounding names
if you can.

676
00:38:18,528 --> 00:38:22,032
Like Archer or Axel.

677
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:24,534
I've decided on the third place.

678
00:38:25,493 --> 00:38:26,972
It didn't have CCTVs.

679
00:38:27,214 --> 00:38:28,580
Ask for them.

680
00:38:28,663 --> 00:38:30,832
Who cares about CCTVs?

681
00:38:30,915 --> 00:38:33,001
Stop watching crime shows.

682
00:38:33,418 --> 00:38:35,253
It's better to be safe than sorry.

683
00:38:36,046 --> 00:38:38,090
Do you know how to pay
for electricity and water?

684
00:38:38,173 --> 00:38:39,883
I'll find it on the Internet.

685
00:38:39,967 --> 00:38:41,468
Do you know
how to set that up?

686
00:38:41,551 --> 00:38:44,387
I'll find it with my cell phone.
Happy?

687
00:38:51,019 --> 00:38:52,729
Turn the car around up here.

688
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,775
That reminds me!

689
00:39:00,237 --> 00:39:01,624
Give me a pair of shoes

690
00:39:01,691 --> 00:39:03,568
- you don't wear.
- Right.

691
00:39:03,635 --> 00:39:05,200
Leaving men's shoes
in single women's homes...

692
00:39:07,369 --> 00:39:09,126
Why would I have shoes
I don't wear?

693
00:39:09,997 --> 00:39:10,998
See you.

694
00:39:13,208 --> 00:39:14,211
What?

695
00:39:15,418 --> 00:39:16,795
I don't get him.

696
00:39:16,878 --> 00:39:18,546
One minute he's thoughtful,
then he's cold.

697
00:39:29,059 --> 00:39:30,517
(Where Do You Live?)

698
00:39:31,601 --> 00:39:32,602
Really?

699
00:39:33,478 --> 00:39:34,613
Okay.

700
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,690
Then let's do it
with the design meeting.

701
00:39:36,773 --> 00:39:38,775
I'll call Young-ho to join us.

702
00:39:39,442 --> 00:39:40,443
Bye.

703
00:39:42,529 --> 00:39:43,989
Hi, Sun-woo.

704
00:39:44,072 --> 00:39:45,907
You're interested in
home decorating too?

705
00:39:47,242 --> 00:39:50,162
I've been forced
to move out soon.

706
00:39:50,245 --> 00:39:51,668
I should do some research.

707
00:39:51,751 --> 00:39:53,250
Then, it's perfect.

708
00:39:53,333 --> 00:39:55,622
It's a home welcoming gift.

709
00:39:55,705 --> 00:39:58,085
It's one of our bookstore's
latest goods.

710
00:39:58,962 --> 00:40:00,297
What is it?

711
00:40:02,049 --> 00:40:03,420
Oh! I love it!

712
00:40:03,503 --> 00:40:06,423
Since you like it,
here's one more for a set.

713
00:40:07,095 --> 00:40:09,097
They're limited-edition cups.

714
00:40:10,932 --> 00:40:13,060
The point is he gave me two cups.

715
00:40:13,143 --> 00:40:13,970
It must mean one for me

716
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:15,937
and one for him.

717
00:40:16,021 --> 00:40:17,854
How can you think that?

718
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:19,357
You normally think,

719
00:40:19,552 --> 00:40:21,568
he must've had an extra one.

720
00:40:22,944 --> 00:40:24,941
I only told him that I'm moving.

721
00:40:25,488 --> 00:40:26,994
Did he notice I'll be on my own?

722
00:40:28,433 --> 00:40:31,036
He's so obvious
about his feelings.

723
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:32,912
Don't jump the gun.

724
00:40:32,996 --> 00:40:34,748
Of course he'll congratulate
your move.

725
00:40:34,831 --> 00:40:36,708
He wouldn't say,
"Oh, that's too bad."

726
00:40:36,791 --> 00:40:38,168
Why you...

727
00:40:39,377 --> 00:40:40,420
See?

728
00:40:43,465 --> 00:40:45,842
Read the texts here.

729
00:40:51,514 --> 00:40:53,680
Okay. Build up the courage
next week to...

730
00:40:53,763 --> 00:40:55,522
Are you crazy?

731
00:40:55,605 --> 00:40:57,837
Why? Was I too straightforward?

732
00:40:57,904 --> 00:40:59,436
Still, I should drop hints.

733
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:01,483
Oh, my god!

734
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:03,610
He's just saying
see you next Wednesday.

735
00:41:03,693 --> 00:41:06,071
You always go there
on Wednesdays!

736
00:41:06,154 --> 00:41:08,615
- You're making me dizzy.
- Look at the details.

737
00:41:08,698 --> 00:41:11,535
- Do you see the smiley eyes?
- Yes.

738
00:41:11,618 --> 00:41:12,786
It's all over the place.

739
00:41:12,869 --> 00:41:15,872
Obviously, using smiley eyes
is a habit.

740
00:41:16,706 --> 00:41:18,416
You worry too much
like an old lady.

741
00:41:19,542 --> 00:41:20,547
I'm going to be straightforward.

742
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:23,338
No! You're going backwards!

743
00:41:25,423 --> 00:41:26,931
Forget it.

744
00:41:26,999 --> 00:41:29,006
She's clueless, not me.

745
00:41:30,178 --> 00:41:31,558
Did you rent a place?

746
00:41:32,139 --> 00:41:33,431
Young-ho helped me.

747
00:41:34,682 --> 00:41:36,560
He's like an expert.

748
00:41:36,643 --> 00:41:39,396
He checked everything thoroughly
and compared prices.

749
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,781
It sounds like Young-ho
may be interested in you.

750
00:41:44,864 --> 00:41:46,486
What?

751
00:41:46,569 --> 00:41:48,488
Park Young-ho? No way.

752
00:41:48,571 --> 00:41:50,077
He only likes himself.

753
00:41:50,865 --> 00:41:51,866
Really?

754
00:41:52,909 --> 00:41:54,701
We'll be using a warm color

755
00:41:54,784 --> 00:41:57,034
with a modern design
book band.

756
00:41:57,117 --> 00:41:58,359
We'll also use
a thin, colorless vellum paper

757
00:41:58,426 --> 00:41:59,796
to reduce thickness.

758
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:01,510
There aren't many pages.

759
00:42:01,577 --> 00:42:04,211
Wouldn't eLight paper be better?

760
00:42:04,294 --> 00:42:06,843
As the books size is
on the small side,

761
00:42:06,926 --> 00:42:08,805
we can expect to have more pages.

762
00:42:08,888 --> 00:42:09,884
Right.

763
00:42:09,968 --> 00:42:12,929
Let's go with vellum paper
instead of eLight paper then.

764
00:42:13,596 --> 00:42:14,764
Okay.

765
00:42:15,765 --> 00:42:19,816
By the way, do we have someone
to write the recommendation?

766
00:42:19,899 --> 00:42:20,978
How about author Na Gwang-ryeol?

767
00:42:21,521 --> 00:42:23,023
No way.

768
00:42:23,106 --> 00:42:25,108
We've used his recommendations
too much.

769
00:42:26,651 --> 00:42:28,115
Do you have anyone in mind?

770
00:42:31,948 --> 00:42:33,518
How about our junior Young-jin,

771
00:42:33,585 --> 00:42:36,620
- the YouTube star?
- Too weak.

772
00:42:36,703 --> 00:42:38,372
And it should be someone
who is single.

773
00:42:38,455 --> 00:42:40,553
I have an uncle who is single

774
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,999
and is on TV sometimes.

775
00:42:42,375 --> 00:42:44,751
Really? What does he do?

776
00:42:44,834 --> 00:42:48,215
He's a priest.
He's on Peace TV sometimes.

777
00:42:49,509 --> 00:42:51,008
He's a celebrity.

778
00:42:52,052 --> 00:42:53,350
I see.

779
00:42:55,013 --> 00:42:57,767
- Go wash your face.
- Yes, ma'am.

780
00:42:58,516 --> 00:43:01,018
Let's look for the recommendations

781
00:43:01,101 --> 00:43:02,145
and end it for today.

782
00:43:02,854 --> 00:43:04,231
How about a staff dinner out?

783
00:43:04,606 --> 00:43:05,815
Dinner?

784
00:43:06,816 --> 00:43:09,569
I'm on herbal medicine.
I can't drink alcohol now.

785
00:43:09,652 --> 00:43:11,738
I have to also avoid spicy
and flour-based food.

786
00:43:11,821 --> 00:43:14,281
Okay. Wash your face
and go home.

787
00:43:14,364 --> 00:43:15,742
It's okay, ma'am.

788
00:43:15,825 --> 00:43:18,165
I think going to staff dinners
is part of the job.

789
00:43:18,248 --> 00:43:20,247
Says who? It's okay, really!

790
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:22,499
You don't have to come.
Go home.

791
00:43:22,832 --> 00:43:24,291
No, it's okay.

792
00:43:24,374 --> 00:43:25,793
We're not okay.

793
00:43:38,515 --> 00:43:40,308
No alcohol!

794
00:43:42,102 --> 00:43:46,273
Mr. Park!
You're good at grilling meat.

795
00:43:47,607 --> 00:43:50,317
- Did Ye-ri surprise you?
- Yes.

796
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,778
We're used to this.

797
00:43:52,282 --> 00:43:55,074
Next, she'll make soju-beer,
milk-beer,

798
00:43:55,157 --> 00:43:57,154
sweet and bitter beer,
soju-coffee,

799
00:43:57,237 --> 00:44:00,327
and finally fruity-beer
for dessert.

800
00:44:01,291 --> 00:44:02,608
Ye-ri loves staff dinners,

801
00:44:02,675 --> 00:44:04,124
so she'll never quit.

802
00:44:04,207 --> 00:44:05,208
Thank you.

803
00:44:06,334 --> 00:44:07,461
How about a toast?

804
00:44:07,544 --> 00:44:09,216
Wait. That guy isn't here.

805
00:44:09,299 --> 00:44:13,133
- The priest's nephew.
- Oh, him?

806
00:44:13,216 --> 00:44:15,052
Can you warm this up for me?

807
00:44:17,012 --> 00:44:18,430
Let's toast!

808
00:44:18,513 --> 00:44:20,477
- Remember our members!
- Remem...

809
00:44:34,612 --> 00:44:35,697
What are you doing?

810
00:44:38,741 --> 00:44:40,660
There it was.

811
00:44:42,204 --> 00:44:43,396
I'm lousy at everything else

812
00:44:43,463 --> 00:44:44,751
besides publishing.

813
00:44:45,665 --> 00:44:46,666
I can see that.

814
00:44:46,749 --> 00:44:49,461
Oh, it shows, huh?

815
00:44:50,378 --> 00:44:51,838
Thanks for noticing.

816
00:44:58,095 --> 00:44:59,596
Why do you want to be a writer?

817
00:45:07,187 --> 00:45:09,272
Why the suddenly serious question?

818
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:13,692
I've always wanted to be one,

819
00:45:13,775 --> 00:45:15,322
and I think I can do it now.

820
00:45:16,446 --> 00:45:17,534
So confident!

821
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,689
New writers believe that

822
00:45:21,756 --> 00:45:25,288
their books will shock the world.

823
00:45:26,289 --> 00:45:27,477
But when it's released,

824
00:45:27,544 --> 00:45:28,085
they're the ones who are shocked.

825
00:45:29,379 --> 00:45:31,048
Because they don't sell much.

826
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:34,965
Everyone tries his or her best,

827
00:45:35,048 --> 00:45:37,464
but anything can happen
in publishing.

828
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:41,345
Then why do you work so hard

829
00:45:41,428 --> 00:45:44,099
if you don't know
what will happen?

830
00:45:44,182 --> 00:45:45,183
Me?

831
00:45:46,977 --> 00:45:48,545
I just started out in publishing

832
00:45:50,228 --> 00:45:52,440
when it was time to get a job.

833
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:56,236
At first, I thought
it was just a job.

834
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:00,318
Then I saw someone

835
00:46:00,585 --> 00:46:03,240
reading a book I published
on a subway.

836
00:46:04,954 --> 00:46:07,244
I felt so proud.

837
00:46:08,665 --> 00:46:13,503
Since then, I decided
I should make good books.

838
00:46:14,379 --> 00:46:17,094
I'm still working
towards that dream.

839
00:46:20,885 --> 00:46:22,509
What is your definition of
a good book?

840
00:46:23,513 --> 00:46:24,681
A book that sells well.

841
00:46:25,935 --> 00:46:28,226
Royalties don't grow on trees.

842
00:46:29,727 --> 00:46:30,903
We're here

843
00:46:30,971 --> 00:46:33,860
because we love making books.

844
00:46:34,899 --> 00:46:36,653
To my colleagues and myself,

845
00:46:37,152 --> 00:46:39,776
I want to give enough
to make our next book.

846
00:46:43,116 --> 00:46:44,081
Chief!

847
00:46:46,369 --> 00:46:48,062
How about talking down

848
00:46:48,129 --> 00:46:50,247
casually to each other?

849
00:46:53,751 --> 00:46:55,795
It's not the right time.
Sit down.

850
00:46:55,878 --> 00:46:56,879
Yes, ma'am.

851
00:46:58,881 --> 00:47:00,050
Not!

852
00:47:00,133 --> 00:47:02,009
Why should I?
My legs are cramped!

853
00:47:03,428 --> 00:47:04,763
Cho Ye-ri!

854
00:47:04,846 --> 00:47:05,762
Stop making bomb shots!

855
00:47:05,845 --> 00:47:07,144
You're our company's bomb!

856
00:47:08,058 --> 00:47:09,059
I am?

857
00:47:09,769 --> 00:47:10,685
Okay.

858
00:47:10,768 --> 00:47:12,980
And stop taking off your socks
when working at night!

859
00:47:14,606 --> 00:47:16,353
Byung-su.

860
00:47:17,192 --> 00:47:18,945
I think you should stop.

861
00:47:19,029 --> 00:47:20,317
Oh Yoon-jung!

862
00:47:20,945 --> 00:47:22,239
Who are you talking to?

863
00:47:22,322 --> 00:47:24,101
Look people in the eyes
when you speak,

864
00:47:24,168 --> 00:47:24,861
stupid!

865
00:47:28,203 --> 00:47:29,829
Funny, huh?

866
00:47:30,705 --> 00:47:31,956
Wanna see something
more hilarious?

867
00:47:32,662 --> 00:47:33,916
See this?

868
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:37,254
See the red blob? It's your face!

869
00:47:37,337 --> 00:47:39,339
You get red when you drink!

870
00:47:39,422 --> 00:47:40,898
So why do you keep drinking?

871
00:47:40,966 --> 00:47:41,969
Are you stupid?

872
00:47:42,052 --> 00:47:44,178
Aren't you too old
to be drinking like that?

873
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:45,387
Ow!

874
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:47,264
How many lives do you have?

875
00:47:48,056 --> 00:47:49,349
It's talking down time!

876
00:47:49,432 --> 00:47:50,613
You've said enough!

877
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:52,477
Are you drunk on your medicine?

878
00:47:53,728 --> 00:47:56,648
- I didn't drink it yet.
- Go wash your face!

879
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:04,573
- Let's toast.
- Sure.

880
00:48:04,656 --> 00:48:05,823
What's with him?

881
00:48:16,256 --> 00:48:17,714
It's cold.

882
00:48:20,961 --> 00:48:23,420
- What should we have?
- I'm starving.

883
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:44,279
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

884
00:48:50,702 --> 00:48:51,703
Jeez!

885
00:48:52,745 --> 00:48:53,746
Joo Hyun-jin!

886
00:48:54,747 --> 00:48:55,915
What are you doing in there?

887
00:48:56,916 --> 00:48:59,503
It's nothing. Just go.

888
00:48:59,586 --> 00:49:00,462
Are you drunk?

889
00:49:00,545 --> 00:49:02,339
No, I'm not. Just go!

890
00:49:02,755 --> 00:49:04,495
Fine, but you should come out.

891
00:49:04,562 --> 00:49:05,922
It's the men's bathroom.

892
00:49:06,676 --> 00:49:08,303
Just my damn luck!

893
00:49:09,221 --> 00:49:11,678
Do you know the couple
that just came in?

894
00:49:12,182 --> 00:49:13,516
I don't know the woman,

895
00:49:14,434 --> 00:49:17,734
but Sun-woo works at
the bookstore I go to.

896
00:49:19,272 --> 00:49:21,068
So? Do you owe him money?

897
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:22,525
No. I...

898
00:49:25,237 --> 00:49:28,031
I thought Sun-woo liked me.

899
00:49:29,741 --> 00:49:30,784
So?

900
00:49:30,867 --> 00:49:32,699
I texted him and said
to be brave.

901
00:49:33,203 --> 00:49:33,991
Brave for what?

902
00:49:34,074 --> 00:49:36,293
I said he could ask me out.

903
00:49:37,915 --> 00:49:40,087
Oh, you did, huh?

904
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:41,628
I also said,

905
00:49:42,212 --> 00:49:45,052
None but the brave
deserve the fair.

906
00:49:47,425 --> 00:49:50,220
Did you just laugh?

907
00:49:50,303 --> 00:49:51,388
Think this is funny?

908
00:49:52,302 --> 00:49:54,511
He even gave me two cups!

909
00:49:55,683 --> 00:49:57,144
Wait. Hold on.

910
00:50:04,859 --> 00:50:06,613
(Men's Bathroom Key)

911
00:50:12,159 --> 00:50:13,698
Hyun-jin? You're not using
the toilet, right?

912
00:50:13,765 --> 00:50:14,831
Are you dressed?

913
00:50:14,914 --> 00:50:17,084
Why would I not be dressed
inside the men's bathroom!

914
00:50:17,167 --> 00:50:18,331
I'm opening the door.

915
00:50:19,457 --> 00:50:20,542
Ready?

916
00:50:28,091 --> 00:50:30,635
Let's try to get out
without being noticed.

917
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:41,104
Hold on.

918
00:50:53,908 --> 00:50:56,828
Ma'am!
Can we buy some of your kimchi?

919
00:50:57,829 --> 00:51:00,537
My boyfriend says it's so good.
He wants to buy some.

920
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:03,961
Do you sell kimchi too?

921
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:11,948
- Jeez!
- It's Gat kimchi.

922
00:51:12,457 --> 00:51:14,141
You like this, right?

923
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:16,473
I do?

924
00:51:18,976 --> 00:51:19,977
Ah, yes.

925
00:51:20,981 --> 00:51:22,646
- Enjoy the kimchi.
- Thanks.

926
00:51:22,729 --> 00:51:23,860
You like Gat kimchi?

927
00:51:44,709 --> 00:51:47,754
But can we leave like this
without saying goodbye?

928
00:51:48,505 --> 00:51:51,348
They have the company card.

929
00:51:51,415 --> 00:51:52,376
They won't remember

930
00:51:52,443 --> 00:51:53,301
when I left.

931
00:51:55,470 --> 00:51:57,264
Wasn't that like in the movies?

932
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:01,979
Can we let go of our hands now?

933
00:52:16,616 --> 00:52:18,910
I'm so embarrassed.

934
00:52:19,869 --> 00:52:21,870
I wasn't really interested in him,

935
00:52:21,953 --> 00:52:23,498
but he was so nice to me.

936
00:52:24,249 --> 00:52:26,543
Right. He even gave you two cups.

937
00:52:26,626 --> 00:52:29,046
Right! Why give me so many?

938
00:52:30,088 --> 00:52:31,095
Meaningless kindness.

939
00:52:31,162 --> 00:52:32,549
It should be a crime.

940
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:34,426
Right. It should be a crime.

941
00:52:35,010 --> 00:52:37,345
Thanks! You're the best.

942
00:52:39,056 --> 00:52:41,326
Why do you talk
like we're friends?

943
00:52:41,409 --> 00:52:42,976
You don't seem drunk.

944
00:52:43,726 --> 00:52:45,937
It's been a long, hard day.
I could use a friend.

945
00:52:47,064 --> 00:52:48,690
You're not that much older.

946
00:52:49,316 --> 00:52:53,445
I saw your ID.
You're only a year older.

947
00:52:58,158 --> 00:52:59,201
Hello?

948
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:00,660
That's right.

949
00:53:01,494 --> 00:53:03,330
Please come to that address.

950
00:53:03,413 --> 00:53:05,415
Thank you.

951
00:53:09,002 --> 00:53:11,754
- I'll do it.
- Hold still.

952
00:53:12,589 --> 00:53:14,257
I can tie a knot
that can't be undone.

953
00:53:16,969 --> 00:53:18,053
There!

954
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:39,406
Chief!

955
00:53:41,081 --> 00:53:42,619
Give us the company card!

956
00:53:43,203 --> 00:53:46,456
- Ye-ri has it!
- Yes, ma'am!

957
00:54:00,095 --> 00:54:01,304
The taxi is here.

958
00:54:05,725 --> 00:54:08,525
(Did you get home safely?)

959
00:54:14,314 --> 00:54:16,733
(I had fun tonight)

960
00:54:24,995 --> 00:54:26,204
(Joo Hyun-jin)

961
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:42,637
To singles,
flings are mere indulgences.

962
00:54:47,017 --> 00:54:48,500
No!

963
00:54:48,567 --> 00:54:50,978
Snap to it,
Park Young-ho!

964
00:54:51,061 --> 00:54:52,522
Let's just write.

965
00:55:49,537 --> 00:55:51,789
- Hello.
- Hi.

966
00:55:52,082 --> 00:55:52,837
Chief!

967
00:55:52,904 --> 00:55:54,751
Did you see Mr. Park's draft?

968
00:55:54,834 --> 00:55:56,586
He wrote so fast.

969
00:55:59,422 --> 00:56:00,988
He must be writing day and night.

970
00:56:01,055 --> 00:56:02,342
He's almost done.

971
00:56:03,093 --> 00:56:05,720
And this is Ms. Hong's draft.

972
00:56:06,513 --> 00:56:09,936
She wasn't the type
to stick to schedule like this.

973
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:11,518
Aren't their pictures great?

974
00:56:12,432 --> 00:56:13,770
It's as if one person took them.

975
00:56:14,937 --> 00:56:15,938
Wow!

976
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:21,068
They look great.

977
00:56:23,283 --> 00:56:24,951
Were you able to reach Young-ho?

978
00:56:25,948 --> 00:56:29,997
He's been ghosting
since that staff dinner.

979
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:31,958
Wait.

980
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:33,910
The staff dinner?

981
00:56:34,332 --> 00:56:35,412
That night...

982
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:37,464
Mr. Park and you, chief...

983
00:56:38,295 --> 00:56:39,836
What?

984
00:56:42,966 --> 00:56:44,301
Didn't you two fight?

985
00:56:45,677 --> 00:56:46,883
No way!

986
00:56:52,059 --> 00:56:53,850
Mr. Park just posted on Instagram.

987
00:56:55,853 --> 00:56:59,473
"All ties can be sadly undone"

988
00:56:59,556 --> 00:57:00,650
What?

989
00:57:01,318 --> 00:57:02,990
Sadly undone...

990
00:57:04,196 --> 00:57:06,243
Maybe his writing
isn't going well.

991
00:57:07,991 --> 00:57:09,446
He must have writer's block.

992
00:57:09,951 --> 00:57:10,865
Writers get sensitive

993
00:57:10,932 --> 00:57:14,248
and get it at least once.

994
00:57:14,331 --> 00:57:16,583
That must be it.

995
00:57:17,297 --> 00:57:19,586
Then he needs some cheering up.

996
00:57:20,503 --> 00:57:21,713
Who's going?

997
00:57:56,581 --> 00:57:57,707
No! No! No!

998
00:58:04,089 --> 00:58:05,092
Hi.

999
00:58:05,548 --> 00:58:06,841
Why are you here?

1000
00:58:06,924 --> 00:58:08,112
What do you think?

1001
00:58:08,195 --> 00:58:09,506
For writer management.

1002
00:58:10,762 --> 00:58:12,264
- Are you sick?
- No.

1003
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:14,308
Are you eating well?

1004
00:58:14,391 --> 00:58:16,393
Wait! You can't come in.

1005
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:18,395
My place is a mess.

1006
00:58:18,979 --> 00:58:20,480
What? It looks clean.

1007
00:58:22,024 --> 00:58:23,318
Can't I come in?

1008
00:58:23,385 --> 00:58:24,401
Is someone here?

1009
00:58:24,817 --> 00:58:27,731
Of course not. I have to work.

1010
00:58:27,814 --> 00:58:30,367
Really? You want me to go?

1011
00:58:32,284 --> 00:58:33,120
Yes.

1012
00:58:35,287 --> 00:58:36,243
Fine.

1013
00:58:36,788 --> 00:58:37,998
Make sure you eat well.

1014
00:58:39,416 --> 00:58:41,084
- Sure you're not sick?
- I'm fine.

1015
00:59:07,694 --> 00:59:08,556
Why didn't you just say

1016
00:59:08,623 --> 00:59:10,113
you wanted me to stay?

1017
00:59:11,739 --> 00:59:13,410
Why lock yourself up
at this time of night?

1018
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:17,244
Got no chairs?

1019
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:21,833
Wanna sit?

1020
00:59:22,542 --> 00:59:23,543
It's okay.

1021
00:59:25,837 --> 00:59:27,047
Why do you have just one?

1022
00:59:30,971 --> 00:59:32,179
It smells good.

1023
00:59:38,641 --> 00:59:40,227
What? Where's mine?

1024
00:59:43,646 --> 00:59:45,362
You want some, too?

1025
00:59:58,158 --> 01:00:00,457
I only have one mug.

1026
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:05,961
No, thanks. No bowl.

1027
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:08,625
There's wine, right?

1028
01:00:11,674 --> 01:00:13,930
How'd you know I have wine?

1029
01:00:14,344 --> 01:00:16,531
You posted on drinking wine often.

1030
01:00:16,614 --> 01:00:18,015
An editor knows everything.

1031
01:00:18,848 --> 01:00:20,267
By the way...

1032
01:00:21,684 --> 01:00:22,685
What?

1033
01:00:24,104 --> 01:00:25,188
You...

1034
01:00:27,274 --> 01:00:28,275
When are you going home?

1035
01:00:30,277 --> 01:00:32,909
I'm leaving
even if you beg me to stay.

1036
01:00:33,946 --> 01:00:34,781
Wait!

1037
01:00:34,864 --> 01:00:37,742
Your cat! It's so cute.

1038
01:00:38,118 --> 01:00:42,039
Meow! Kitty! Where are you?

1039
01:00:43,873 --> 01:00:45,749
Don't name my cat, Kitty.

1040
01:00:45,832 --> 01:00:47,362
If it comes on a call like that,

1041
01:00:47,429 --> 01:00:50,130
- it wouldn't be a cat.
- Vinyl records!

1042
01:00:51,423 --> 01:00:52,967
Of course you have these.

1043
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:55,677
You collected everything
that looks cool.

1044
01:00:59,056 --> 01:01:01,558
Looks cool? They are cool!

1045
01:01:01,641 --> 01:01:03,350
Aren't vinyl records too showy?

1046
01:01:04,978 --> 01:01:07,444
Someone who makes paper books
shouldn't say that.

1047
01:01:09,524 --> 01:01:10,858
I love this album!

1048
01:01:11,611 --> 01:01:13,400
Can you play it, please?

1049
01:01:16,948 --> 01:01:18,514
It's a classic.

1050
01:01:18,581 --> 01:01:19,993
You have great taste.

1051
01:01:49,356 --> 01:01:52,400
I started liking your writing
these days.

1052
01:01:54,902 --> 01:01:56,196
What? All of a sudden?

1053
01:01:58,115 --> 01:01:59,491
Do you know that I moved?

1054
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:04,121
Why didn't you take my calls?

1055
01:02:04,997 --> 01:02:06,831
I had so many questions
on the house.

1056
01:02:08,666 --> 01:02:09,667
By chance,

1057
01:02:10,168 --> 01:02:12,170
is it because of
what happened that night?

1058
01:02:12,545 --> 01:02:16,508
Huh? Did something happen?

1059
01:02:17,384 --> 01:02:18,644
You don't remember?

1060
01:02:19,081 --> 01:02:21,096
We almost kissed.

1061
01:02:26,393 --> 01:02:27,810
I didn't know...

1062
01:02:28,811 --> 01:02:29,812
Or not?

1063
01:02:31,231 --> 01:02:33,108
Did we actually kiss?

1064
01:02:33,650 --> 01:02:34,595
No, we didn't!

1065
01:02:34,662 --> 01:02:36,823
We were just close like this.

1066
01:02:36,906 --> 01:02:40,077
Then you pushed me, and I fell.

1067
01:02:40,448 --> 01:02:41,578
You remember!

1068
01:02:44,119 --> 01:02:45,332
Do you like me?

1069
01:02:52,502 --> 01:02:54,004
Am I way off again?

1070
01:02:57,215 --> 01:02:58,885
Will you really
stay single forever?

1071
01:02:59,342 --> 01:03:01,135
Even if the perfect match
comes along?

1072
01:03:01,218 --> 01:03:03,757
I'm the only perfect match
for myself.

1073
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:05,472
How do you know?
You never tried to match.

1074
01:03:05,555 --> 01:03:07,184
Must I try to know?

1075
01:03:07,267 --> 01:03:08,643
Yes, of course.

1076
01:03:16,484 --> 01:03:17,610
Have some tea.

1077
01:03:18,236 --> 01:03:19,487
When I went to India...

1078
01:03:32,167 --> 01:03:34,962
You're not drunk, are you?

1079
01:03:36,588 --> 01:03:37,714
No.

1080
01:04:19,756 --> 01:04:21,258
May I ask why you look so happy?

1081
01:04:22,425 --> 01:04:24,261
It's nothing.

1082
01:04:26,721 --> 01:04:31,228
But I like
the non-stop greenlights.

1083
01:04:40,943 --> 01:04:42,737
Hot off the printer.

1084
01:04:43,405 --> 01:04:45,322
Done editing?
Were there many typos?

1085
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:48,115
Since Mr. Park is an instructor,

1086
01:04:48,198 --> 01:04:49,369
there were hardly any typos.

1087
01:04:49,452 --> 01:04:51,248
Ms. Hong had
some colloquial words.

1088
01:04:51,331 --> 01:04:53,748
They're stylish, so we left them.

1089
01:04:53,831 --> 01:04:54,958
The mistakes are marked off.

1090
01:04:55,042 --> 01:04:57,794
What a surprise!
You checked so thoroughly.

1091
01:04:58,628 --> 01:05:00,917
Ah, it wasn't me.

1092
01:05:01,714 --> 01:05:03,550
He did it.

1093
01:05:06,056 --> 01:05:07,387
By the way,

1094
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:09,226
do you know
author Hong Mi-na is here?

1095
01:05:10,015 --> 01:05:12,226
Really? Where is she?

1096
01:05:12,309 --> 01:05:13,893
Let's see her unveiled face.

1097
01:05:13,977 --> 01:05:15,562
She's in the cafe with the boss.

1098
01:05:15,645 --> 01:05:17,605
I'm printing the draft.
Let's go when it's done.

1099
01:05:18,523 --> 01:05:21,943
By the way,
while editing the drafts,

1100
01:05:24,362 --> 01:05:25,529
why do I see Ms. Hong
in Mr. Park's writing?

1101
01:05:25,612 --> 01:05:27,444
why do I see Ms. Hong
in Mr. Park's writing?

1102
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,579
Y was a Korean Literature major.

1103
01:05:32,662 --> 01:05:34,871
My first job was at
a business hotel.

1104
01:05:35,707 --> 01:05:37,624
I met Y there.

1105
01:05:38,210 --> 01:05:40,877
Some episodes seem similar.

1106
01:05:47,385 --> 01:05:48,386
Hi!

1107
01:05:49,346 --> 01:05:50,968
This is our chief editor
Joo Hyun-jin.

1108
01:05:51,848 --> 01:05:53,183
Hi, I'm Joo Hyun-jin.

1109
01:06:09,574 --> 01:06:10,575
Hi!

1110
01:06:27,467 --> 01:06:28,468
What are you doing?

1111
01:06:29,970 --> 01:06:32,679
Shouldn't this be
on the morning talk show?

1112
01:06:33,390 --> 01:06:34,221
Is it amusing?

1113
01:06:34,304 --> 01:06:37,854
Yes! I love stuff like this!

1114
01:06:49,281 --> 01:06:51,738
Like makeup for the first time,
we're clumsy with our first loves.

1115
01:06:52,742 --> 01:06:55,078
We're pretty, even without makeup
in our 20s.

1116
01:06:56,038 --> 01:06:58,231
But we wear
the thickest makeup then

1117
01:06:59,749 --> 01:07:02,085
because we don't know much
about ourselves.

1118
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:11,388
This is my hideout.

1119
01:07:13,763 --> 01:07:14,681
What are you reading?

1120
01:07:16,556 --> 01:07:17,724
Oh, no.

1121
01:07:21,601 --> 01:07:23,480
(Norwegian Wood)

1122
01:07:28,778 --> 01:07:30,197
Your hands are so dry.

1123
01:07:35,285 --> 01:07:36,743
Right.

1124
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:41,291
Throwing them away after once use
would be a waste.

1125
01:07:43,253 --> 01:07:44,794
It's a good idea.

1126
01:07:56,176 --> 01:07:58,117
Why go to college now?

1127
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:00,143
It's a waste of time and money.

1128
01:08:00,852 --> 01:08:02,729
Still, I want to go.

1129
01:08:04,939 --> 01:08:07,297
What do you want to major in?

1130
01:08:07,364 --> 01:08:08,901
Tell me. I'll explain everything.

1131
01:08:09,652 --> 01:08:11,446
- Creative writing.
- Really?

1132
01:08:12,197 --> 01:08:14,657
Instead of studying that,
it's better to read more books.

1133
01:08:19,037 --> 01:08:20,247
It's almost 6 o'clock.

1134
01:08:20,705 --> 01:08:22,332
Aren't you going drinking
with your peers?

1135
01:08:23,666 --> 01:08:24,501
Do you have money?

1136
01:08:48,816 --> 01:08:51,129
Stop feeding that cat.

1137
01:08:51,196 --> 01:08:52,695
It'll keep coming.

1138
01:08:53,363 --> 01:08:54,475
Let's help him eat well and rest

1139
01:08:54,542 --> 01:08:56,863
while he's alive.

1140
01:09:04,207 --> 01:09:05,208
Why didn't you take my calls?

1141
01:09:08,795 --> 01:09:10,964
Please go ahead.
I'll be right there.

1142
01:09:11,548 --> 01:09:13,550
Sure. Call me later.

1143
01:09:18,471 --> 01:09:19,639
Sorry.

1144
01:09:19,722 --> 01:09:22,309
I was too busy to even use
the bathroom today.

1145
01:09:22,392 --> 01:09:23,770
I worked at a hotel, too.

1146
01:09:24,269 --> 01:09:25,111
What kept you so busy

1147
01:09:25,178 --> 01:09:27,314
that you had no time for a break?

1148
01:09:27,397 --> 01:09:29,066
Fine. Just keep your voice down.

1149
01:09:30,608 --> 01:09:31,370
I have a staff dinner.

1150
01:09:31,437 --> 01:09:33,153
Let's talk later at home.

1151
01:09:33,236 --> 01:09:34,988
Damn staff dinners.

1152
01:09:36,406 --> 01:09:37,454
I'm coming too.

1153
01:09:38,158 --> 01:09:39,406
What's wrong with you?

1154
01:09:39,489 --> 01:09:42,079
I'll wait here
till you're finished, then!

1155
01:09:44,747 --> 01:09:47,965
In his 20s, he had no money
and no thoughtfulness.

1156
01:09:48,668 --> 01:09:51,046
He was busy
pretending that he did.

1157
01:09:51,129 --> 01:09:53,088
He always said
he did things for me,

1158
01:09:53,171 --> 01:09:55,425
but didn't know what I wanted.

1159
01:10:00,597 --> 01:10:01,558
This is wrong.

1160
01:10:02,432 --> 01:10:04,391
Were we in the same relationship?

1161
01:10:04,474 --> 01:10:07,151
There's no such thing.

1162
01:10:07,739 --> 01:10:08,775
Everything is relative.

1163
01:10:08,858 --> 01:10:10,607
This is just a novel.

1164
01:10:12,652 --> 01:10:13,776
Fine.

1165
01:10:14,861 --> 01:10:16,153
I'll edit mine, you edit yours.

1166
01:10:16,236 --> 01:10:18,575
You can't tell me
to edit my draft.

1167
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:21,986
What don't you like?

1168
01:10:22,212 --> 01:10:23,240
The part about sleeping together?

1169
01:10:23,323 --> 01:10:24,704
Are you crazy?

1170
01:10:24,787 --> 01:10:27,374
You got a long way to go
to become a writer.

1171
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,584
Mr. Park seems quite serious.

1172
01:10:30,667 --> 01:10:31,878
Would you consider editing it?

1173
01:10:32,295 --> 01:10:34,672
I wrote the hardest
on my first love.

1174
01:10:35,090 --> 01:10:36,550
Really?

1175
01:10:36,633 --> 01:10:38,345
I thought so.

1176
01:10:38,885 --> 01:10:41,428
Readers like to read about
first love.

1177
01:10:41,511 --> 01:10:42,680
What's the big deal
about first love?

1178
01:10:43,598 --> 01:10:45,142
It's just dating
when you're most awkward.

1179
01:10:45,225 --> 01:10:47,144
It's also
when you're most innocent.

1180
01:10:47,227 --> 01:10:50,978
That's why you get hurt
and hurt others the most.

1181
01:10:51,061 --> 01:10:52,857
Who doesn't have heartaches?

1182
01:10:53,816 --> 01:10:55,799
You want to hide them,

1183
01:10:56,941 --> 01:10:58,405
but want to be a writer?

1184
01:10:58,488 --> 01:11:00,032
- No!
- Wait.

1185
01:11:00,115 --> 01:11:02,325
We need to calm down here.

1186
01:11:03,326 --> 01:11:04,992
This could be
a blessing in disguise.

1187
01:11:06,329 --> 01:11:07,244
Two authors

1188
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:12,835
who broke up 11 years ago
meet as colleagues.

1189
01:11:14,087 --> 01:11:15,292
This could be a big issue!

1190
01:11:16,006 --> 01:11:17,512
Making your debut

1191
01:11:17,579 --> 01:11:18,744
with this kind of publicity is...

1192
01:11:18,811 --> 01:11:20,010
Wait.

1193
01:11:20,677 --> 01:11:25,852
How do you know
that we haven't met in 11 years?

1194
01:11:32,022 --> 01:11:35,482
It must be around 11 years, right?

1195
01:11:36,609 --> 01:11:39,612
You wrote it in here.

1196
01:11:40,197 --> 01:11:41,528
I did no such thing.

1197
01:11:46,206 --> 01:11:48,535
You remembered Joo-ok.

1198
01:11:51,041 --> 01:11:54,002
You must've known
your writer's real identity.

1199
01:12:03,971 --> 01:12:05,930
- Is it locked?
- No!

1200
01:12:09,142 --> 01:12:10,143
Did you call me?

1201
01:12:15,273 --> 01:12:16,193
What? Is it true?

1202
01:12:21,241 --> 01:12:22,489
Young-ho!

1203
01:12:23,906 --> 01:12:25,242
What are you doing?

1204
01:12:25,908 --> 01:12:26,773
What am I doing?

1205
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:28,075
What about you people?

1206
01:12:30,913 --> 01:12:32,669
Don't pretend you didn't know.

1207
01:12:32,752 --> 01:12:35,292
How can the chief editor
not know that?

1208
01:12:35,710 --> 01:12:37,174
Are you that incompetent?

1209
01:12:38,463 --> 01:12:40,632
Count me out.

1210
01:12:42,259 --> 01:12:45,137
Fine. I'm sorry I'm incompetent.

1211
01:12:45,803 --> 01:12:47,126
But I honestly didn't know

1212
01:12:47,193 --> 01:12:48,885
and I'll publish the books.

1213
01:12:48,969 --> 01:12:50,152
Is this your idea of a good book

1214
01:12:50,219 --> 01:12:51,851
that you dream of making?

1215
01:12:53,436 --> 01:12:54,053
What are books and authors

1216
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:55,105
to you?

1217
01:12:56,273 --> 01:12:57,367
What author gives up

1218
01:12:57,434 --> 01:12:59,396
because he doesn't like
what someone else wrote?

1219
01:13:01,486 --> 01:13:03,072
I'll convince Ms. Hong.

1220
01:13:03,155 --> 01:13:04,491
Joo-ok's not the problem!

1221
01:13:06,408 --> 01:13:07,617
Do you know how I feel?

1222
01:13:09,369 --> 01:13:10,787
What about me?

1223
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:42,777
(I was caught off guard
and overreacted)

1224
01:14:07,344 --> 01:14:09,137
Dad?

1225
01:14:09,721 --> 01:14:11,143
Did I leave

1226
01:14:11,210 --> 01:14:12,807
my printer cable there?

1227
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:23,485
Door opening.

1228
01:14:27,072 --> 01:14:28,573
He'll be here soon.

1229
01:14:30,117 --> 01:14:32,119
There are new books here.

1230
01:14:33,328 --> 01:14:34,704
It's expected, isn't it?

1231
01:14:35,705 --> 01:14:38,416
It's like the books married too.

1232
01:14:41,169 --> 01:14:42,629
What are these?

1233
01:14:42,712 --> 01:14:44,547
We both had these books.

1234
01:14:45,715 --> 01:14:47,842
- Here.
- Thank you.

1235
01:14:49,719 --> 01:14:51,804
You must have a lot in common.

1236
01:14:52,722 --> 01:14:53,848
I guess so.

1237
01:14:57,310 --> 01:14:58,478
How are you doing?

1238
01:14:58,936 --> 01:15:00,438
Like living alone?

1239
01:15:01,731 --> 01:15:03,103
I'm not sure yet.

1240
01:15:03,244 --> 01:15:05,943
There are so many things to do.

1241
01:15:06,278 --> 01:15:07,570
It'll get better.

1242
01:15:09,114 --> 01:15:11,241
How did you like living alone?

1243
01:15:11,324 --> 01:15:12,451
It was good.

1244
01:15:12,534 --> 01:15:15,452
I had freedom and comfort.

1245
01:15:15,535 --> 01:15:18,245
Then why'd you give up
such a good thing?

1246
01:15:19,207 --> 01:15:20,537
I didn't give up.

1247
01:15:22,252 --> 01:15:23,631
I met someone

1248
01:15:23,958 --> 01:15:25,720
that I can be free

1249
01:15:26,085 --> 01:15:27,590
and comfortable with.

1250
01:15:29,179 --> 01:15:31,761
Someone who accepts me as is.

1251
01:15:33,555 --> 01:15:34,931
As is...

1252
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:48,111
That idiot.

1253
01:15:52,865 --> 01:15:53,867
Let's just do it.

1254
01:15:53,950 --> 01:15:55,630
Ms. Hong is here.

1255
01:15:55,707 --> 01:15:56,913
We'll be fine.

1256
01:15:56,997 --> 01:15:59,956
Okay.
Let's get started.

1257
01:16:04,254 --> 01:16:07,315
Welcome to "Meeting with Authors"

1258
01:16:07,382 --> 01:16:09,924
live on the air with KANG Wook.

1259
01:16:10,968 --> 01:16:12,443
I mentioned that
the two authors of

1260
01:16:12,510 --> 01:16:14,054
the "Single in the City" series,

1261
01:16:14,137 --> 01:16:15,233
Hong Mi-na and Park Young-ho

1262
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:16,974
will be on the show today.

1263
01:16:17,057 --> 01:16:17,851
Unfortunately,

1264
01:16:17,918 --> 01:16:19,767
only Ms. Hong Mi-na
was able to come.

1265
01:16:20,352 --> 01:16:21,353
Please introduce yourself.

1266
01:16:22,232 --> 01:16:24,356
Hello, I'm Hong Mi-na.

1267
01:16:25,315 --> 01:16:28,693
Ms. Hong is known as
the queen of romance novels.

1268
01:16:28,776 --> 01:16:30,695
As you kept your face veiled,

1269
01:16:30,778 --> 01:16:33,820
there are many comments
from curious listeners.

1270
01:16:33,903 --> 01:16:35,162
Is this your first essay book?

1271
01:16:35,245 --> 01:16:36,534
Yes, it is.

1272
01:16:37,410 --> 01:16:40,247
The series consist of
Park Young-ho's book on Seoul

1273
01:16:40,330 --> 01:16:43,667
and Ms. Hong Mi-na's book
on Barcelona.

1274
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:44,946
Is there a special reason

1275
01:16:45,014 --> 01:16:46,061
why the book is set

1276
01:16:46,128 --> 01:16:48,421
in Barcelona?

1277
01:16:49,047 --> 01:16:49,964
Like the title says,

1278
01:16:50,031 --> 01:16:51,425
it's about the life of singles

1279
01:16:51,508 --> 01:16:52,884
in different cities.

1280
01:16:53,926 --> 01:16:56,972
Jane Austen once wrote,

1281
01:16:57,055 --> 01:16:58,308
"Good girls go to heaven,

1282
01:16:58,375 --> 01:17:00,808
bad girls go everywhere."

1283
01:17:01,643 --> 01:17:03,645
I'm a bit of bad girl.

1284
01:17:03,728 --> 01:17:06,731
So I've wondered around,
and now live in Barcelona.

1285
01:17:06,814 --> 01:17:08,732
Actually, I read both drafts

1286
01:17:08,799 --> 01:17:09,985
to prepare for this show.

1287
01:17:10,610 --> 01:17:12,745
The story of your first love

1288
01:17:12,812 --> 01:17:14,656
stuck out the most.

1289
01:17:14,739 --> 01:17:18,701
Could you give a sneak peak
on that to our listeners?

1290
01:17:21,121 --> 01:17:22,270
As I said,

1291
01:17:22,337 --> 01:17:25,625
our books are about
the life of singles.

1292
01:17:25,708 --> 01:17:27,085
It's just a teaser.

1293
01:17:27,377 --> 01:17:29,209
Still, if a teaser is good,

1294
01:17:29,276 --> 01:17:31,673
it could lead to more sales.

1295
01:17:32,715 --> 01:17:33,758
I guess so.

1296
01:17:36,386 --> 01:17:38,638
He was a writer like me.

1297
01:17:39,722 --> 01:17:44,061
Is he writer Park Young-ho?

1298
01:17:44,978 --> 01:17:46,183
It's him, isn't it?

1299
01:17:47,064 --> 01:17:48,531
I read both books in the series

1300
01:17:48,598 --> 01:17:50,150
and got that feeling.

1301
01:17:51,193 --> 01:17:54,863
The comments' section is on fire.

1302
01:17:54,946 --> 01:17:59,326
ID 9254 claims to be
an avid fan of yours

1303
01:17:59,409 --> 01:18:00,910
and asks why you two broke up.

1304
01:18:01,661 --> 01:18:02,745
Could you answer that?

1305
01:18:09,627 --> 01:18:10,753
I was scared.

1306
01:18:12,047 --> 01:18:15,382
He always said,
as he prepared for

1307
01:18:15,465 --> 01:18:17,344
the Annual Spring
Literary Contest,

1308
01:18:17,427 --> 01:18:21,431
he'd take responsibility
of me if he wins.

1309
01:18:22,432 --> 01:18:26,145
So you broke up because
you felt burdened?

1310
01:18:26,228 --> 01:18:27,562
Not exactly.

1311
01:18:28,355 --> 01:18:31,023
Whenever I heard that,

1312
01:18:31,106 --> 01:18:33,780
I wondered if I needed to be

1313
01:18:33,847 --> 01:18:35,653
the responsibility
of someone else.

1314
01:18:36,154 --> 01:18:38,823
It's not because
I didn't like him.

1315
01:18:38,906 --> 01:18:42,135
I left because

1316
01:18:42,202 --> 01:18:43,370
I wanted to be responsible
for myself.

1317
01:18:43,453 --> 01:18:44,288
Then

1318
01:18:44,371 --> 01:18:47,624
you met by chance again
through this book series?

1319
01:18:47,707 --> 01:18:49,834
It wasn't by chance.

1320
01:18:51,836 --> 01:18:54,756
The CEO made the suggestion.

1321
01:18:55,298 --> 01:18:59,136
I thought it would be helpful
for him, too.

1322
01:19:02,639 --> 01:19:04,021
We'll return after this song

1323
01:19:04,104 --> 01:19:06,726
to hear about her life
in Barcelona.

1324
01:19:08,645 --> 01:19:10,185
(Jin-pyo: I'm sorry)

1325
01:19:10,252 --> 01:19:11,858
(Are you sleeping?)

1326
01:19:14,854 --> 01:19:17,364
(Joo Hyun-jin)

1327
01:19:26,704 --> 01:19:28,040
Hello?

1328
01:19:29,249 --> 01:19:30,957
Do what you want.

1329
01:19:31,334 --> 01:19:32,341
Don't publish the book

1330
01:19:32,408 --> 01:19:33,086
if you don't want to.

1331
01:19:34,254 --> 01:19:35,457
I'm not working with you

1332
01:19:35,524 --> 01:19:37,007
if you're an irresponsible writer.

1333
01:19:38,883 --> 01:19:40,057
Irresponsible?

1334
01:19:40,510 --> 01:19:42,470
You heard everything
on the radio show.

1335
01:19:44,181 --> 01:19:47,514
Joo-ok decided to write the book
to help me.

1336
01:19:49,602 --> 01:19:51,108
Think I want to write it now?

1337
01:19:51,438 --> 01:19:52,920
Does it hurt your pride

1338
01:19:52,988 --> 01:19:54,191
to receive her help?

1339
01:19:54,857 --> 01:19:56,443
What about our help?

1340
01:19:56,526 --> 01:20:00,197
We worked days and nights
to make your book well.

1341
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:01,990
We edited and designed it.

1342
01:20:02,824 --> 01:20:04,367
Our help doesn't hurt your pride?

1343
01:20:05,535 --> 01:20:06,805
I'll send Ms. Hong's full draft.

1344
01:20:06,872 --> 01:20:09,036
Read it over then decide.

1345
01:20:09,872 --> 01:20:11,374
I'll do whatever you want.

1346
01:20:16,546 --> 01:20:20,467
(File received from Joo Hyun-jin)

01:20:22,682 --> 01:20:24,972
(Single in Barcelona)

1348
01:21:12,644 --> 01:21:13,728
Oh, no!

(2007 Spring Literary Contest
Entry)

(by Park Young-ho)

1352
01:22:37,812 --> 01:22:39,236
Why isn't anybody here?

1353
01:22:40,107 --> 01:22:41,938
Even the ones who applied to come
didn't show?

1354
01:22:42,525 --> 01:22:45,362
It started snowing really badly
this morning.

1355
01:22:45,653 --> 01:22:47,614
It stopped after a bit.

1356
01:22:49,699 --> 01:22:50,907
Mr. Oh is here!

1357
01:22:51,951 --> 01:22:53,953
(New Poetry by Poet Oh Man-su)

1358
01:22:54,037 --> 01:22:56,623
He's wearing a new suit, too.
Oh, no.

1359
01:22:56,706 --> 01:22:58,665
He's going to be so depressed.

1360
01:22:58,748 --> 01:23:00,377
He gets really hurt
by things like this.

1361
01:23:00,460 --> 01:23:02,549
He looks really calm.

1362
01:23:05,048 --> 01:23:06,383
Jeez...

1363
01:23:06,799 --> 01:23:08,760
- His eyes are red.
- They're teary...

1364
01:23:08,843 --> 01:23:09,844
Get to work.

1365
01:23:10,178 --> 01:23:12,222
Scatter out and
gather some people.

1366
01:23:12,889 --> 01:23:14,724
Oh, no. Is he crying?

1367
01:23:19,104 --> 01:23:20,563
Thank you for the coffee.

1368
01:23:21,231 --> 01:23:24,567
We're having a book concert there.

1369
01:23:25,068 --> 01:23:28,622
A famous poet will be reading

1370
01:23:28,689 --> 01:23:31,199
his poems here today.

1371
01:23:33,035 --> 01:23:35,162
Are you sisters
buying reference books?

1372
01:23:35,245 --> 01:23:39,332
Oh, my! No, she's my daughter!

1373
01:23:40,083 --> 01:23:42,093
Really? You look so young,

1374
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:43,295
I thought you were sisters.

1375
01:23:43,378 --> 01:23:44,754
Oh, please.

1376
01:23:44,837 --> 01:23:47,132
- Are you in high school?
- Grade 12.

1377
01:23:47,215 --> 01:23:48,798
In writing essays
or doing interviews,

1378
01:23:48,881 --> 01:23:50,718
it's good to mention
poems like this.

1379
01:23:51,636 --> 01:23:54,014
Mother and sister
buying reference books?

1380
01:23:54,097 --> 01:23:55,098
Pardon?

1381
01:23:55,348 --> 01:23:57,309
- What?
- We're friends.

1382
01:23:58,018 --> 01:23:58,993
It'll help your daughter
with essays.

1383
01:23:59,060 --> 01:24:00,103
What?

1384
01:24:00,603 --> 01:24:01,438
Let's go.

1385
01:24:01,521 --> 01:24:02,855
- Move!
- But...

1386
01:24:07,487 --> 01:24:08,362
(The Wind Brought It)

1387
01:24:08,445 --> 01:24:10,197
The wind brought it.

1388
01:24:11,031 --> 01:24:16,286
I wait for you because
I'm afraid you'd run away

1389
01:24:16,369 --> 01:24:18,246
if I approach you.

1390
01:24:19,456 --> 01:24:21,483
I wait for you

1391
01:24:22,125 --> 01:24:24,753
because it may end
like hammering a nail,

1392
01:24:24,836 --> 01:24:27,464
but I want to melt it with love.

1393
01:24:28,756 --> 01:24:31,051
I wait for you

1394
01:24:31,134 --> 01:24:33,680
because the years gone by
feel like just yesterday

1395
01:24:33,763 --> 01:24:34,688
and I flounder through

1396
01:24:34,755 --> 01:24:36,623
the swamp of chaos.

1397
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:39,726
I wait for you

1398
01:24:40,602 --> 01:24:42,809
because it is the reason
for my living.

1399
01:24:43,355 --> 01:24:45,523
I have no other choice.

1400
01:24:52,322 --> 01:24:55,032
Mr. Oh, the poem
was very touching.

1401
01:24:55,115 --> 01:24:59,454
Now, we'll take any questions
from the audience.

1402
01:24:59,537 --> 01:25:01,094
Please don't be afraid

1403
01:25:01,161 --> 01:25:02,879
and ask Mr. Oh anything.

1404
01:25:04,709 --> 01:25:05,792
Anyone?

1405
01:25:06,503 --> 01:25:07,924
Joo Hyun-jin.

1406
01:25:08,008 --> 01:25:09,130
Yes, the man at the back.

1407
01:25:09,197 --> 01:25:10,173
What is your question?

1408
01:25:12,759 --> 01:25:13,550
Me?

1409
01:25:14,344 --> 01:25:15,932
Yes, the man wearing a coat.

1410
01:25:16,346 --> 01:25:17,514
Please ask your question.

1411
01:25:18,348 --> 01:25:19,349
Okay.

1412
01:25:21,184 --> 01:25:22,727
What is your question?

1413
01:25:22,810 --> 01:25:23,730
My question...

1414
01:25:26,564 --> 01:25:30,237
You've published many books.

1415
01:25:30,693 --> 01:25:32,322
I'm curious why you wrote a book

1416
01:25:32,389 --> 01:25:33,363
for the first time.

1417
01:25:36,116 --> 01:25:39,613
I first started writing

1418
01:25:40,147 --> 01:25:43,160
to look good to a woman.

1419
01:25:44,874 --> 01:25:48,425
She loved books and I loved her.

1420
01:25:50,340 --> 01:25:53,090
Did things go well with her?

1421
01:25:54,717 --> 01:25:57,174
We got married a year later.

1422
01:25:59,431 --> 01:26:00,723
Then we got divorced.

1423
01:26:03,060 --> 01:26:04,457
Now that I think back,

1424
01:26:04,524 --> 01:26:06,813
it was the happiest time
of my life.

1425
01:26:07,730 --> 01:26:12,399
Writing a book for someone I love
and publishing it.

1426
01:26:14,237 --> 01:26:15,405
Then...

1427
01:26:15,488 --> 01:26:17,574
After some time,

1428
01:26:18,033 --> 01:26:20,097
have you ever felt embarrassed

1429
01:26:20,373 --> 01:26:22,119
or regretted what you wrote?

1430
01:26:22,996 --> 01:26:24,621
I'm always embarrassed by it.

1431
01:26:25,290 --> 01:26:26,178
What I write today

1432
01:26:26,245 --> 01:26:27,417
may be embarrassing tomorrow.

1433
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:30,753
But I never regretted it.

1434
01:26:32,589 --> 01:26:36,343
Writing is like traces of love.

1435
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:41,889
Okay.

1436
01:26:42,224 --> 01:26:43,225
Bye.

1437
01:26:43,641 --> 01:26:44,642
We have a problem.

1438
01:26:45,393 --> 01:26:47,021
Su-lin, who was supposed
to sing today,

1439
01:26:47,104 --> 01:26:49,272
suddenly got stomach pains
and can't come.

1440
01:26:50,690 --> 01:26:51,818
Oh, no!

1441
01:26:52,775 --> 01:26:53,780
Should I sing?

1442
01:26:54,444 --> 01:26:55,528
Why?

1443
01:26:56,363 --> 01:26:57,947
I was in a band in college.

1444
01:26:59,574 --> 01:27:01,408
This is no time for jokes!

1445
01:27:20,928 --> 01:27:23,013
There is a star,

1446
01:27:23,096 --> 01:27:24,851
then there is you tonight

1447
01:27:24,934 --> 01:27:27,185
What? Why is he so good?

1448
01:27:28,311 --> 01:27:30,978
Exactly. Why?

1449
01:27:31,061 --> 01:27:35,234
I hesitated to profess my love,

1450
01:27:35,317 --> 01:27:37,445
but I didn't lie

1451
01:27:40,448 --> 01:27:44,911
You were angry
and everything was quiet

1452
01:27:44,995 --> 01:27:49,626
through the long night

1453
01:27:49,709 --> 01:27:53,840
In the dark,
you couldn't sleep

1454
01:27:53,923 --> 01:27:58,008
and cried as you spoke

1455
01:27:58,091 --> 01:28:00,007
By your side

1456
01:28:01,261 --> 01:28:02,262
When did you come?

1457
01:28:03,138 --> 01:28:04,639
Earlier.

1458
01:28:06,349 --> 01:28:07,604
Thanks for your help.

1459
01:28:08,185 --> 01:28:09,977
Things could've been awkward
for Mr. Oh.

1460
01:28:10,060 --> 01:28:11,188
I appreciate it.

1461
01:28:14,857 --> 01:28:17,027
- Hyun-jin.
- Hmm?

1462
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:20,562
I want to publish it.

1463
01:28:21,474 --> 01:28:22,579
Our book...

1464
01:28:27,996 --> 01:28:31,918
Ironically, while writing about
being alone

1465
01:28:32,002 --> 01:28:33,707
I thought about relationships
more than ever.

1466
01:28:33,790 --> 01:28:34,831
(Writer's Note)

1467
01:28:35,878 --> 01:28:37,884
Being truly alone
is not being bound by

1468
01:28:38,340 --> 01:28:41,338
relationships and
not running away.

1469
01:28:42,469 --> 01:28:43,803
I realized that through this book.

1470
01:28:46,806 --> 01:28:48,558
Once again, ironically,

1471
01:28:48,641 --> 01:28:52,812
there are people who helped me
truly stand alone.

1472
01:28:52,895 --> 01:28:54,059
I'd like to thank
the publishing team

1473
01:28:54,126 --> 01:28:55,357
and chief editor Joo Hyun-jin.

1474
01:29:03,948 --> 01:29:04,949
You slept, didn't you?

1475
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:08,370
No, I didn't.

1476
01:29:10,497 --> 01:29:11,498
Wash your face?

1477
01:29:12,457 --> 01:29:14,118
I hope the readers will also be happy

1478
01:29:14,185 --> 01:29:15,961
in relationships

1479
01:29:16,044 --> 01:29:17,587
and be true singles.

Park Young-ho.

1481
01:29:22,550 --> 01:29:24,261
He majored in Korean Literature.

1482
01:29:25,095 --> 01:29:27,764
He runs "Single_Almighty"
on Instagram

1483
01:29:27,847 --> 01:29:29,448
and has been sharing know-hows

1484
01:29:29,515 --> 01:29:31,184
that apply to
those who live alone.

1485
01:29:32,102 --> 01:29:33,828
Through 18 years of
living on his own

1486
01:29:33,895 --> 01:29:35,689
and 5 years of
voluntary singlehood,

1487
01:29:35,772 --> 01:29:37,566
he has found peace
in living by himself.

1488
01:29:37,649 --> 01:29:38,605
(Even if you're alone/
Because you're alone)

1489
01:29:38,984 --> 01:29:43,738
In hopes of others
being happy alone,

1490
01:29:43,821 --> 01:29:45,532
he continues to write even today.

1491
01:29:55,125 --> 01:29:56,543
Thank you very much.

1492
01:29:58,795 --> 01:30:00,755
Is this good?
They're all the same.

1493
01:30:01,256 --> 01:30:02,382
It has to be brighter.

1494
01:30:02,465 --> 01:30:03,883
Could you print it one more time?

1495
01:30:05,468 --> 01:30:09,226
Please drink this
and try it one more time?

You came?

1507
01:31:58,362 --> 01:32:00,233
You didn't reply,
so I thought you wouldn't.

1508
01:32:01,918 --> 01:32:03,378
Do you want help?

1509
01:32:03,461 --> 01:32:05,302
No, I have to go in now.

1510
01:32:06,339 --> 01:32:08,545
Are you okay with our books
not selling well?

1511

What about you? Are you okay?

1512
01:32:12,054 --> 01:32:14,222
I'm okay because I saw you.

1513
01:32:15,348 --> 01:32:17,475
If not,
I'd wonder about you for life.

1514
01:32:20,937 --> 01:32:22,314
I wanted to apologize to you.

1515
01:32:23,481 --> 01:32:24,441
About what?

1516
01:32:25,567 --> 01:32:27,234
Just this and that.

1517
01:32:29,112 --> 01:32:30,447
You've changed a lot.

1518
01:32:31,614 --> 01:32:32,739
Just like Seoul.

1519
01:32:38,205 --> 01:32:40,747
This isn't a movie. Just go.

1520
01:32:41,291 --> 01:32:43,920
Give me a hug,
so you won't regret it later.

1521
01:32:51,884 --> 01:32:53,720
- Hey!
- Sorry.

1522
01:32:54,137 --> 01:32:55,180
It's a habit.

1523
01:32:58,891 --> 01:33:00,097
I'd better go.

1525

Here you are.

1526
01:33:29,381 --> 01:33:32,092
- Business is great.
- It's not bad.

1527
01:33:32,175 --> 01:33:34,221
Take pictures
and post them on your Instagram?

1528
01:33:35,095 --> 01:33:37,722
Why did you quit?
Is it because of my book?

1529
01:33:37,805 --> 01:33:39,266
Of course not.

1530
01:33:39,599 --> 01:33:41,434
I flopped on my share of books.

1531
01:33:42,852 --> 01:33:43,629
I realized I'm not really cut out

1532
01:33:43,696 --> 01:33:44,481
for publishing.

1533
01:33:46,356 --> 01:33:48,409
Know what's our secret to success?

1534
01:33:48,476 --> 01:33:50,193
It's the foam.

1535
01:33:51,486 --> 01:33:53,446
What are you talking about?

1536
01:33:54,031 --> 01:33:56,033
That table wants a beer now.

1537
01:33:56,116 --> 01:33:58,285
- Hurry! Hurry!
- Coming right up!

1538
01:33:58,868 --> 01:34:02,713
The secret is working hard

1539
01:34:02,780 --> 01:34:04,457
whether he quits his job or not.

1540
01:34:11,423 --> 01:34:12,465

(Village Book Publishing)

1544
01:34:37,907 --> 01:34:38,908
Boss.

1545
01:34:39,867 --> 01:34:41,244
Don't call me that.

1546
01:34:41,703 --> 01:34:42,579
Remember.

1547
01:34:43,121 --> 01:34:44,831
Interns must listen well
and talk less.

1548
01:34:44,914 --> 01:34:47,664
And never ask to have talking
down time at staff dinners.

1549
01:34:48,085 --> 01:34:49,252
Why?

1550
01:34:50,795 --> 01:34:51,964
What do you mean why?

1551
01:34:53,173 --> 01:34:54,924
Why you...

1552
01:34:55,842 --> 01:34:56,843
Yeah, why?

1553
01:34:58,971 --> 01:35:01,139
- Let's go wash our faces.
- Why?

1554
01:35:02,640 --> 01:35:06,023
Your face gets oily
when you're an intern.

1555
01:35:06,106 --> 01:35:08,025
- Why?
- They suit each other.

1556
01:35:08,688 --> 01:35:09,856
They sure do.

1557
01:35:45,142 --> 01:35:47,978
By chance,
are you author Park Young-ho?

1558
01:35:48,811 --> 01:35:49,812
Ah, yes.

1559
01:35:50,313 --> 01:35:52,609
Oh! Wait, please.

1560
01:35:53,150 --> 01:35:57,279
Could I have your autograph?

1561
01:35:57,362 --> 01:35:59,656
- Sure.
- Thank you.

1562
01:36:02,742 --> 01:36:05,245
Was this book meaningful at all?

1563
01:36:05,328 --> 01:36:08,498
Yes! I live alone in Seoul.

1564
01:36:08,581 --> 01:36:12,127
I could relate to a lot of things
in your book.

1565
01:36:13,003 --> 01:36:14,861
And I was also comforted

1566
01:36:14,928 --> 01:36:17,007
by thinking I'm not alone.

1567
01:36:17,090 --> 01:36:18,091
I see.

1568
01:36:23,055 --> 01:36:25,640
- Thank you.
- No, I'm the one who's thankful.

1569
01:36:29,978 --> 01:36:30,979
Young-ho?

1570
01:36:33,481 --> 01:36:34,816
What brings you here?

1571
01:36:35,317 --> 01:36:37,111
Just hanging out.

1572
01:36:37,194 --> 01:36:38,486
Hi, Hyun-jin.

1573
01:36:40,238 --> 01:36:42,699
Don't you come here on Wednesdays?

1574
01:36:43,033 --> 01:36:44,492
I come here on Mondays now.

1575
01:36:45,368 --> 01:36:49,956
You didn't come here every day
to wait for me, did you?

1576
01:36:51,416 --> 01:36:52,786
Of course not.

1577
01:36:52,998 --> 01:36:54,751
I know you'd never do that.

1578
01:36:59,716 --> 01:37:01,551
- Sign the book for me.
- What?

1579
01:37:05,597 --> 01:37:06,515
It's good.

1580
01:37:06,598 --> 01:37:08,766
Publishing a book about
stories of ordinary people.

1581
01:37:09,934 --> 01:37:13,297
I like the stories of
the truck driver

1582
01:37:13,380 --> 01:37:14,647
and the cook
who makes side dishes.

1583
01:37:15,940 --> 01:37:16,816
The book is just like you.

1584
01:37:16,899 --> 01:37:17,940
(Don't change for someone else,)

1585
01:37:18,008 --> 01:37:19,116
(but be yourself)

1586
01:37:21,821 --> 01:37:23,570
Some author told me this.

1587
01:37:25,408 --> 01:37:27,244
I guess it impressed you a lot?

1588
01:37:28,411 --> 01:37:30,747
Aren't you curious about
that author's latest piece?

1589
01:37:30,830 --> 01:37:33,025
I don't know
if he's still writing.

1590
01:37:36,753 --> 01:37:38,964
Oh, you're quite confident, huh?

1591
01:37:40,257 --> 01:37:41,890
I'm not. That's why I brought it.

1592
01:37:41,957 --> 01:37:43,385
Books aren't made alone.

1593
01:37:45,178 --> 01:37:46,513
You've changed a lot.

1594
01:37:48,140 --> 01:37:49,346
I should change.

1595
01:37:51,021 --> 01:37:52,889
(Hi, Bye Romance)

1596
01:37:54,562 --> 01:37:56,398
Nothing embarrassing
in here this time?

1597
01:37:57,774 --> 01:37:59,776
- It's a novel.
- Really?

1598
01:38:00,943 --> 01:38:01,898
Novels are hard.

1599
01:38:03,446 --> 01:38:06,616
I know, but I finally wrote it.

1600
01:38:10,370 --> 01:38:11,605
You came by bus, right?

1601
01:38:11,672 --> 01:38:13,356
I'll drive you to the bus stop.

1602
01:38:17,669 --> 01:38:19,779
Oh, I had something to ask you.

1603
01:38:20,670 --> 01:38:23,090
Think I need a dishwasher
though I live alone?

1604
01:38:25,635 --> 01:38:26,719
Buy one if you want.

1605
01:38:33,518 --> 01:38:34,727
What about a dryer?

1606
01:38:36,479 --> 01:38:38,065
It wasn't in your book.

1607
01:38:50,077 --> 01:38:51,078
Hyun-jin.

1608
01:38:57,125 --> 01:38:58,335
Do you want to
grab a beer together?
