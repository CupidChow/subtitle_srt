[Story of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 36]

3
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,650
You might not be able to accept
what I'm saying now in the past.

4
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,729
But now…

5
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,680
Did I hurt you?

6
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,240
Remember this.
Pain will wake you up to your senses.

7
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,550
Sister.

8
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,770
Sister,

9
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,420
you have been dreaming for years.

10
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,400
Time to wake up.

11
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,120
[You are beautiful,
outstanding and talented.]

12
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:30,970
[If you are willing to work on it,
it's still not too late for you.]

13
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,790
Your Highness!

14
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,480
[Wasn't this from my sister?]

15
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,000
[This is my personal matter.
No need to concern yourself with it.]

16
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,190
[Fu Heng!]

17
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,680
[Remember this.
Pain will wake you up to your senses.]

18
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,400
[If you don't have a child of your own,]

19
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,880
[your life in the future
will be cold and lonely.]

20
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,520
[You have been dreaming for years.]

21
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,940
[Time to wake up.]

22
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,420
Fu Heng,

23
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,170
you'll get married in three months' time.

24
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,780
Are you really not going to regret it?

25
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,550
I don't regret it.

26
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,900
Li Yu.

27
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,570
Your Majesty.

28
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:02,990
Tell me,

29
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,480
how did I treat Wei Ying Luo?

30
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,420
Well...

31
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,010
Tell me.

32
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,010
Tell me the truth.

33
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,620
If you lie, it'll be treason.

34
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:20,290
Your Majesty.

35
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,700
Well...

36
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,160
De Sheng!

37
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,360
Your Majesty.

38
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,460
He doesn't dare to say it.
So, you'll say it instead.

39
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,690
How did I treat Wei Ying Luo?

40
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,290
Your Majesty,

41
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:51,310
you treated her very well.

42
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,580
What did you say?

43
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,820
Your Majesty, in this Forbidden...

44
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,960
No.

45
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,909
You are the only master
in this entire Great Qing.

46
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,580
Everyone is your servant.

47
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,080
And all servants have to
obey their master.

48
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:08,380
How can a palace maid
talk back to the emperor?

49
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,320
Wei Ying Luo has broken the rules
so many times,

50
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,400
but she is still alive.

51
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,460
-You are indeed magnanimous.
-Enough!

52
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,440
Your Majesty, where are you going?

53
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,680
Take this.

54
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,720
How can you spout such nonsense?

55
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,320
But I'm just telling the truth.

56
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,680
That's why you shouldn't say it.
I'll punish you later!

57
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,560
Eunuch Li, what about Consort Chun?

58
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,300
You accepted her western...

59
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,690
Go to Zhongcui Palace now. Got it?

60
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,990
Okay.

61
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,900
Let's go to Changchun Palace.

62
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,159
Changchun Palace.

63
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:01,960
No.

64
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,760
I don't want to go there.

65
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,970
Your Majesty,

66
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,960
how about we take a stroll through the
Imperial Garden to get some fresh air?

67
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,350
Imperial Garden. Hurry up!

68
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,900
Your Majesty, let's find a place
to take shelter from the rain.

69
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,680
This is just a drizzle.
Why do I need to take shelter?

70
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,500
-Go away.
-Your Majesty, take care of yourself.

71
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,430
Your Majesty,

72
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,560
Greetings, Your Majesty.

73
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,490
-Rise.
-Thank you, Your Majesty.

74
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,010
It's already so chilly
but you still have a fan with you.

75
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,150
What is this?

76
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,410
This is the grand view of West Lake.

77
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,100
When I was young,

78
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,840
I resided in Hangzhou with my grandmother.

79
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:27,130
This fan is a left behind
by my late grandmother.

80
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,420
I had never heard you mention it before.

81
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,520
But Hangzhou...

82
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:35,740
does boast picturesque scenery
and is a rich land fostering talents.

83
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:39,630
No wonder you are so elegant and talented.

84
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,250
My grandmother was an open-minded woman.

85
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:50,030
We explored the hidden temple
to find cinnamon...

86
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,550
and we lied down on top of
a pavilion to look at the sea.

87
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:57,970
We led a wild and free life.

88
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:03,220
I never thought that my father
would send me into Prince Bao's mansion...

89
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,640
and got me trapped in
this Forbidden City forever.

90
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,670
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

91
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,140
I've misspoken.

92
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,450
You were just expressing
the burden in your mind.

93
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:21,050
There's nothing to forgive.

94
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:30,900
I am always frowning and in low spirit...

95
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,760
because I miss my home town.

96
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,679
I miss my late grandmother.

97
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,039
But what I miss the most...

98
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:41,320
is the happiness and freedom
that is forever lost to me.

99
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,350
Your Majesty,

100
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,810
are you still mad at me?

101
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,160
I was never mad at you.

102
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,550
But why didn't you...

103
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,450
tell me about this before?

104
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,360
I was afraid.

105
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,840
What were you afraid of?

106
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,010
There are so many talented and
beautiful ladies in the palace.

107
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,200
Even if you dote on me for a moment,

108
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,610
how long can that moment last?

109
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,640
Just like Emperor Tang's Consort Mei.

110
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,530
She was once his favourite too.

111
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,520
But after that, came Consort Yang.

112
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,840
And then, Consort Mei was just
forgotten like that.

113
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,260
That's why I...

114
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,550
didn't dare to go near you before this.

115
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,740
And I didn't dare to
fall in love with you.

116
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,500
You've already made up your mind.

117
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,350
Now, you got what you want.

118
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,680
Why are you crying then?

119
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,780
Over the past six months,

120
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,300
you had never once
visited Zhongcui Palace.

121
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,850
You never came...

122
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,140
and yet I didn't get...

123
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:04,330
the freedom and happiness
that I had imagined.

124
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:08,440
And I was left with loneliness and regret.

125
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,100
Now, I finally realised that...

126
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,070
rather than never seeing the sky,

127
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,420
I should...

128
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,520
muster up my courage...

129
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:31,130
to ask for a little bit of warmth
from you.

130
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,720
Your Majesty,

131
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,040
do you still want me?

132
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,650
Never seeing the sky?

133
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,270
You just need to...

134
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,050
raise your head and you'll see the sky.

135
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,460
You're laughing at me.

136
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,320
It's good that you're smiling.

137
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,000
Your Majesty,

138
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,030
are you still angry at me?

139
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:20,030
Let's go. I'll send you back.

140
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,720
No.

141
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:24,500
I...

142
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,710
don't want to return to Zhongcui Palace.

143
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:31,150
When did I say that
I'm taking you back to Zhongcui Palace?

144
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,740
I'll come and visit you at Zhongcui Palace
after I'm done with my work.

145
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,120
Your Majesty.

146
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:02,090
Snow fungus and lotus seed soup.

147
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,400
Li Yu,

148
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,720
Empress Dowager already gave
"A Consoling Letter" to me.

149
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,240
Find it and deliver it to Zhongcui Palace.

150
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:14,560
I'm sure that Consort Chun will
like Lu Ji's calligraphy work.

151
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,620
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Another thing.

152
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,840
Send the jade board that I always use
for a game of Go there as well.

153
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:24,000
Tell Consort Chun that I will play it with
her in the afternoon when I have a break.

154
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,060
Yes, Your Majesty.

155
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,020
-Summon Fu Heng at once.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

156
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,890
Greetings, Your Majesty.

157
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,480
Fu Heng.

158
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:56,810
I have kept you by my side
to train and polish you.

159
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:01,340
Now, you are able to
take charge on your own.

160
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,720
After your wedding,
you'll become the vice minister...

161
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,550
of the Ministry of Revenue.

162
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,330
Your Majesty, I am still young.

163
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:14,910
To take up such a high position suddenly,
I'm afraid that...

164
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:16,390
Fu Heng,

165
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,020
I expect much more from you than
being just in the Ministry of Revenue.

166
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:24,190
I know that your ambition
doesn't end there either.

167
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,540
A journey of a thousand miles
begins with the first step.

168
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,740
You have to be successful
to prove to everyone that...

169
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,880
my discernment is right.

170
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,440
And this Ministry of Revenue
is your starting point.

171
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,600
-Thank you, Your Majesty.
-Rise.

172
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,940
How's the wedding preparation?

173
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,750
It's in the process.

174
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,880
Fu Heng,

175
00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:00,050
Being promoted and
having a wedding in sight...

176
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,850
are both happy events in life.

177
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,570
Today, I...

178
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,860
promoted you...

179
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,760
and grant you a wife.

180
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:12,260
But why is there's no sign of happiness...

181
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,260
on your face at all?

182
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,690
I will never forget
about Your Majesty's kindness.

183
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:20,650
But your expression
clearly states otherwise.

184
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,100
What is it?

185
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,390
You don't even give want to
give me an explanation?

186
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:37,090
I don't want to lie to you.

187
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:42,650
Get lost.

188
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,410
I take my leave now.

189
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,570
Your Majesty, is it this board?
I will deliver it now.

190
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,120
No need to deliver it now!

191
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,540
Is everyone in the Labour House dead?

192
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,560
Your Majesty, at this time of the year,
they need to clean out the charcoal ashes.

193
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,160
There are only 25 eunuchs
in Heating Department.

194
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:23,290
When they don't have enough hands,
the servants of Labour House will do it.

195
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,140
Greetings, Your Majesty.

196
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,360
Why are you here?

197
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,550
They should send a eunuch
to do this dirty and tiring chore.

198
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,280
Why did they send a palace maid?

199
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:36,290
You've been at the Labour House
for so long.

200
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:39,040
You don't wish to return
to Changchun Palace?

201
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,770
I've committed a mistake.
I wouldn't wish for it.

202
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,100
You can come and beg me.

203
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:47,170
I am not so brazen.

204
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,370
Ying Luo, His Majesty
is giving you a chance.

205
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,370
Just give in.

206
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,120
Her Majesty is awake.

207
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:07,150
She was bedridden for too long
and she can't walk now.

208
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,010
She's in a very bad mood and
refuses to see anyone.

209
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:12,859
Wei Ying Luo.

210
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,700
You have received great mercy from her.

211
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,380
Don't you wish to return to serve her?

212
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,300
Please be merciful...

213
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:28,369
and allow me to return to Changchun Palace
to serve Her Majesty.

214
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,530
You can go back.

215
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,800
But I have to punish you
for defying me multiple times.

216
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,240
I am willing to be punished.

217
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,620
It's easier said than done.

218
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,940
I will be able to do...

219
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,020
anything you wish.

220
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,990
Brother.

221
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,260
Qian.

222
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,760
It's your wedding night.
Why are you standing here all alone?

223
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,910
I don't know.

224
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,400
Are you out of your mind with ecstasy?

225
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,930
Your bride is still waiting for you.
Go in now.

226
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,160
Go on.

227
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,790
Go on.

228
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,080
Go on.

229
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:56,030
Groom, come and unveil her now.

230
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,920
May everything go your way
and may you be successful!

231
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,080
Groom, take a seat over here.

232
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,880
Sit down please.

233
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,680
May you prosper and enjoy
both felicity and longevity!

234
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,150
May you have a child soon and
have a happy union forever.

235
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,900
May you two be blessed with
many children and be together forever.

236
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,680
Time to eat the pastry.

237
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,500
Here you go.

238
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,200
Is it raw?

239
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,750
-Yes.
-Great.

240
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,570
Here you go.

241
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:30,570
Fu Heng.

242
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:36,490
You...

243
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,780
Do you regret this?

244
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,520
[I am really worried about you.]

245
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,110
No.

246
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,720
I don't regret it.
I don't regret it either.

247
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,930
Even though I know that
you still love her,

248
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:02,920
as long as I can marry you
and be your wife,

249
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,880
I am willing to do anything.

250
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,680
I am willing to endure any hardship.

251
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,030
Er Qing,

252
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,960
from the moment I married you,

253
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:18,840
I have already made up my mind
to forget about her.

254
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,110
Really?

255
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,480
Are you really going to forget her?

256
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,000
I married you.
So, you are my responsibility now.

257
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,340
You are my wife.

258
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:34,410
The one I will grow old with.

259
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,670
From now on,
I will keep it firmly in my mind.

260
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:40,830
But,

261
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,680
she is still in my heart.

262
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:49,820
Please give me some time...

263
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,290
to slowly forget about her.

264
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,940
But...

265
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,020
I still can't do it now.

266
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,670
I understand.

267
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,560
I totally understand.

268
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,520
It's alright.

269
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,950
Now that you have given me your promise,

270
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,460
I am willing to wait.

271
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,070
No matter how long it takes.

272
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:27,530
Thank you.

273
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:45,170
I deserve death for my offence!

274
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,410
I deserve death for my offence!

275
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,360
I deserve death for my offence!

276
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,270
I deserve death for my offence!

277
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,280
I deserve death for my offence!

278
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,650
I deserve death for my offence!

279
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,530
-I deserve death for my offence!
-Eunuch De Sheng.

280
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,680
What is going on?

281
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,800
His Majesty ordered Wei Ying Luo to
go around the six palaces starting from...

282
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:25,200
Qianqing Palace during
the first snow in the Forbidden City.

283
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:29,080
If she can walk three steps with one
kowtow for 24 hours, he will pardon her...

284
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,280
and let her go back to Changchun Palace.

285
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,830
Fu Heng.

286
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,050
-Let's go.
-I deserve death for my offence!

287
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,200
Lord Fu Heng, go in.

288
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,180
It's time to thank His Majesty
for his kindness.

289
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:09,750
I deserve death for my offence!

290
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,240
Have you forgotten about your promise?

291
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,080
Have you forgotten about it?

292
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,500
Lord Fuca, time to go.

293
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:37,730
I deserve death for my offence!

294
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,750
I deserve death for my offence!

295
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,840
Is she still kowtowing?

296
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,160
Yes, Your Majesty.

297
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,380
How many hours has she walked?

298
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:11,450
Your Majesty, she has already
walked for six hours.

299
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,490
Your Majesty,

300
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,760
Wei Ying Luo is a girl.

301
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,360
It's snowing so heavily.

302
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,210
If she really manages to walk 24 hours
while making a kowtow every three steps,

303
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:29,770
I'm afraid she will be frozen by then.

304
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,040
I deserve death for my offence!

305
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,170
I gave her a choice.

306
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,140
She is the one who doesn't appreciate it.

307
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,120
[I'll give you two options.]

308
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,830
[First option, tell Fuca Fu Heng that...]

309
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:46,250
[you've never liked him sincerely.]

310
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,270
[Tell him that you did it out of
greed for wealth and status...]

311
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:52,070
[and that you had deceived him.]

312
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,950
[Second option.]

313
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,120
[During the first snowfall
in the Forbidden City,]

314
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,980
[make a kowtow every three steps
and shout out your offence...]

315
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,410
[for 24 hours.]

316
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,080
[Make your choice.]

317
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,550
I deserve death for my offence.

318
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:14,850
Your Majesty,

319
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,500
Lord Fuca and his wife, Hitara Hala,
are here to express their gratitude.

320
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,400
I deserve death for my offence.

321
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,690
Lord Fuca, His Majesty said that
he can't receive you today.

322
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,240
You can just go ahead
and visit Her Majesty.

323
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,770
Fu Heng!

324
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,360
[Fuca Fu Heng.]

325
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:17,900
[I refused to choose the first option...]

326
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,660
[because I didn't want to lie to myself.]

327
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,680
[I, Wei Ying Luo,]

328
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,550
[had once loved you with all my heart.]

329
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,000
[But from today onwards,]

330
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:32,070
[you and I...]

331
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,650
[are no longer related in any way.]

332
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,920
[We will be strangers from now on.]

333
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,620
-Greetings, Your Majesty.
-Greetings, Your Majesty.

334
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,520
Rise.

335
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,680
Er Qing, come here.

336
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,370
I wish you two a long
and harmonious life together.

337
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:37,070
Thank you, Your Majesty.

338
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,280
Er Qing,

339
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:52,240
you are a noblewoman now.
Do you still see me as your sister?

340
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,310
Ming Yu, what are you talking about?

341
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,930
We served Her Majesty together.

342
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,510
We are like sisters. Or course
I'll still see you as my sister.

343
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:03,720
Great then.
I have lots of questions for you.

344
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,800
Come with me.

345
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,380
Go on.

346
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,000
Fu Heng,

347
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,560
don't forget what you said.

348
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,960
Sister, what do you mean?

349
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,640
Since you already made your choice,

350
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,140
what is done cannot be undone.

351
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:45,430
Do not regret it.

352
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,090
Sister, I…

353
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:55,770
There are many life-changing choices
in our lives.

354
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,460
And there's no turning back
after you made your choice.

355
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:02,580
You know it is irrevocable.

356
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,450
But if you insist on yearning after her,

357
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,150
it'll be very painful for you.

358
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:10,110
Since you have already made your choice,

359
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,000
stick to it until the end.

360
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:20,640
Yes. I know.

361
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:24,860
But sister,

362
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,060
it's snowing so heavily outside.

363
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:34,090
We are not cold inside this warm palace
that is heated up by charcoal.

364
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,420
But she's all alone in the heavy snow.

365
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,770
She must be so cold.

366
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,750
So cold.

367
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:30,960
Ying Luo.

368
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,430
Ying Luo.

369
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,370
Ying Luo.

370
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,320
I know that I can't change your mind.

371
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:44,990
But it's okay.

372
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,840
I will...

373
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,370
walk with you.

374
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,990
Ying Luo.

375
00:33:58,330 --> 00:33:59,530
Here.

376
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,520
I deserve death for my offence.

377
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:27,630
I deserve death for my offence!

378
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,440
Ying Luo!

379
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,320
Take a rest.

380
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,040
The edict didn't state that
you can't drink water.

381
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:04,810
I'll get you some water.

382
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,560
Er Qing, are you happy?

383
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,840
Why do you ask me that?

384
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,280
You and I entered the palace together
to serve Her Majesty.

385
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,760
You're intelligent,
prudent and understanding.

386
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:36,570
I've always admired you.

387
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,920
-Her Majesty also said that...
-Ming Yu.

388
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,260
What are you trying to say?

389
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:47,320
When I see you today,
you like a totally different person.

390
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,820
You are acting like a noblewoman.

391
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,970
I don't even recognise you now.

392
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,100
My status has changed.

393
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:57,450
Of course I'm different from before.

394
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:00,290
But no matter what,

395
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:02,730
I will not forget about our friendship.

396
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,980
From now on, please stay with
Her Majesty and...

397
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,020
take care of her for me.

398
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,920
Er Qing,

399
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,670
are you really happy with this result?

400
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,820
Didn't you once say that...

401
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:20,230
my grandfather is the minister
of Ministry of Justice?

402
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:21,530
Now,

403
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,100
I'm married to someone I like...

404
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:26,820
and my whole family has been promoted.

405
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:30,140
My family has really become
a true official's family.

406
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,650
We are a prominent family now.

407
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:34,120
You said that...

408
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:37,890
I am the only perfect match for Fu Heng.

409
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:40,560
Didn't you?

410
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,600
I had endured being a servant

411
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,680
for six years.

412
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:49,550
Now, I'm living a great life now.

413
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,320
Aren't you happy for me?

414
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,280
Of course I am happy for you.

415
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,890
You'll always be a servant
in this palace...

416
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,090
with no dignity and status.

417
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,130
You...

418
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:09,120
should make some plans for yourself too.

419
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:11,450
No. I don't want to go anywhere.

420
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:13,280
I want to stay with Her Majesty.

421
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,200
If you are unwilling,

422
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,590
I won't force you.

423
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:25,520
In the past, I feared snowy days the most
when I was in the palace.

424
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,580
I would worry about the heavy snow...

425
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:31,240
ruining the flowers
and upsetting Her Majesty.

426
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,790
I would worry about running into
other mistresses...

427
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:36,150
whom I had to kowtow to.

428
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,870
I would chill to the bone.

429
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,330
Now,

430
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,870
I can finally appreciate the snow.

431
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,840
I deserve death for my offence.

432
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:03,100
♫ Forbidden Palace with its red walls,
it feels like a good place to live in ♫

433
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:09,760
♫ As the walls sever the setting sun
they grow old and lose their past dreams ♫

434
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:18,060
♫ The window covered by decaying leaves
remembers the cold wind of harvests ♫

435
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:24,760
♫ Knowing only how to go with
the flow and pass the years ♫

436
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,500
♫ Unmarried and hopeful,
the heavy and dark gates are locked ♫

437
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:31,800
♫ Cultivated and proud. Gem-like beauties.
Yet, somehow ♫

438
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:39,240
♫ Flowers who stay may endure breakage,
making them ask to change their karma ♫

439
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:47,000
♫ Can't they rest on
an empty, carefree branch? ♫

440
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,870
[Didn't you do it out of
your own selfish motives?]

441
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,840
[Perhaps...]

442
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:00,390
[you've taken a liking to Wei Ying Luo...]

443
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:03,770
[and wants her for yourself.]

444
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,760
Take her away and clean her up.

445
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,960
Yes, Your Majesty.

446
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:37,640
Chief Li, what does His Majesty
mean by "clean her up"?

447
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:43,390
Do you think you can easily decipher
our master's words?

448
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,830
Figure it out yourself.

449
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,280
Figure it out myself?

450
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:49,760
Chief Li,

451
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:52,790
I really don't dare to
figure it out myself this time.

452
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:55,150
I will just do as you say.

453
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,000
Send her there.

454
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:00,500
Understand?

455
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,720
Yes, I understand now.

456
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,520
What are you doing?

457
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:30,000
Miss Ying Luo, you had walked under
heavy snow for eight hours.

458
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,530
His Majesty is magnanimous
and pardoned you.

459
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,190
Really?

460
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,120
-Where are you going?
-Changchun Palace.

461
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,930
Even if you want to go back there,
you can't just go back like this.

462
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:43,860
You will give Her Majesty a fright.

463
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,640
What is the meaning of this?

464
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,500
Congratulations, Miss Ying Luo.

465
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,360
Congratulations?

466
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,690
Open the door!

467
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,200
Open this door!

468
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,040
What is going on?
