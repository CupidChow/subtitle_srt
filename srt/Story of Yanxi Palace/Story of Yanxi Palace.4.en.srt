[Story of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 4]

3
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,450
Wei Ying Luo? What are you doing?

4
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,940
I should be the one asking that.

5
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,480
All women want to pave a good path
for herself. What did I do wrong?

6
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,570
Your way of paving a good path...

7
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:13,200
is to pretend to sprain your leg to
make Fuca Fu Heng support you...

8
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,610
and use this opportunity
to climb up the social ladder?

9
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,780
Yes. Can't I do that?

10
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,000
He is from a powerful and noble family.

11
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,870
He has seen many beautiful women.

12
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,680
Do you think he'll marry just because
he might be interested in your face?

13
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,079
Even being his concubine
is better than the life I'm having now.

14
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,710
I don't mind at all.

15
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,090
Those brainless men without any sense
of shame think the same way too.

16
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,540
Where do you think we are?

17
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,930
This is Forbidden City. The palace maid
and guard are forbidden to have an affair.

18
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,270
If your affair is exposed,

19
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,450
he can get away with it easily
because he is the relative of the emperor.

20
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,790
But as for you,

21
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,200
only death awaits you.

22
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,530
I'm telling you this because
we came out together today.

23
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,530
I don't want to be dragged down with you.

24
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,150
If this were another time,

25
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,540
I wouldn't stop you from courting death.

26
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,330
You have no rights to lecture me!

27
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,270
-Say that again.
-You!

28
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,080
I'll go and deliver these clothes.
Are you happy now?

29
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,700
Brainless men?

30
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,560
No sense of shame?

31
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,130
Am I right, Wei Ying Luo?

32
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,360
Looks like you have quite
a prejudice against men, Miss Ying Luo.

33
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,640
What about me? What about His Majesty?

34
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,720
This is just a misunderstanding,
Imperial Guard Fuca.

35
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,040
In this world, there are indeed
brainless and shameless men...

36
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,740
who deceive ignorant and
gullible young women.

37
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,610
But His Majesty is the son of heaven.

38
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,910
And you are an outstanding person.

39
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,800
How can you be compared
with those shameless men?

40
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,360
Wei Ying Luo, you are
really good at sophistry.

41
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,600
Imperial Guard Fuca,
you are right for lecturing me.

42
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,400
From now on, I will speak and act
cautiously and conform to the rules.

43
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,870
Wei Ying Luo.

44
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,860
Imperial Guard Fuca,
any other further instructions?

45
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,980
No matter what prejudice you have,

46
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,160
don't look down on men.

47
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,020
All the imperial guards
in the palace are mighty warriors.

48
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,110
Yes, I will remember that.

49
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,430
Imperial Guard Fuca is here?

50
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,080
Luckily, he's serving
in the imperial court.

51
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,410
He can always visit Changchun Palace
and give Her Majesty emotional support.

52
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:35,020
Do you think that anyone
can enter the palace as they please?

53
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,730
Even if he's her younger brother,
it's still a taboo.

54
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:42,909
His Majesty allows Imperial Guard Fuca
to visit Her Majesty frequently...

55
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:45,430
because he dotes on her.

56
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,540
Fu Heng! What are you doing?

57
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,560
Fu Heng, return it to me!

58
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,200
Return it to me! Where is it?

59
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,540
Where is the longevity lock?

60
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,250
Help me look for it!

61
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,620
Don't look for it!

62
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,520
Where's my longevity lock?

63
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,320
My longevity lock.

64
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,120
My longevity lock.

65
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,600
What rights do you have to take
my things and meddle in my business?

66
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:25,250
It has been three years
since Yong Lian died.

67
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,180
For the past three years, you've been
crying and refusing to see anybody.

68
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,240
Even now, you are still
wallowing in your sorrow.

69
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:37,530
Sister, when are you going to
pull yourself together?

70
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,880
-Imperial Guard Fuca.
-Leave us!

71
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,680
Release me! This is none of your business.

72
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,180
I don't want to meddle
in your business too.

73
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:48,970
But I have to do it.

74
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,440
As long as you are still
the descendant of Fuca family,

75
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,480
the empress of the Great Qing,

76
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,000
you shouldn't wallow in personal grief
and forget about your responsibilities.

77
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,310
I have never forgotten about
my responsibilities.

78
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,120
Is that true?

79
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,960
What is the duty of an empress?

80
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,220
What does an empress need to be like?

81
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,220
Before you were married,
what did our father instil in you?

82
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,270
Once you are married into
Aisin Gioro family,

83
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,970
you have to be prepared to give up
your whole life for the nation.

84
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,760
You!

85
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,340
What rights do you have to criticise me?

86
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:28,820
What rights do you have?

87
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,630
Because I can't manage the harem well?

88
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:35,220
Because I lack the ability to do so?

89
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,280
After losing Yong Lian, I'm not only sad.

90
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,550
I'm devastated.

91
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,700
I carried him in my womb for ten months.

92
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:53,460
I was in pain for the whole day
and night to give birth to him.

93
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,590
He was the most important person
in my life. My most beloved child!

94
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,480
If I could do it,

95
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,790
I would rather give up my life for him.

96
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,480
You have never experienced
this kind of pain.

97
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,410
You don't have the rights to criticise me!

98
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,480
-Sister.
-Don't call me that.

99
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Did His Majesty ask you
to come here today?

100
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:27,920
Go and tell him this.

101
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,530
I am Yong Lian's mother.
Yong Lian has passed away.

102
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:38,760
He can be indifferent, but I can't.

103
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:44,460
You've indeed been resenting
His Majesty all the while.

104
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:49,110
Do you really think that
he's indifferent...

105
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,690
towards Yong Lian's death?

106
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,200
Only during the first five days
after Yong Lian's passing...

107
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:58,340
did he look heart-stricken.

108
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,520
But after that, he seems to have
forgotten about that child.

109
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,280
He then attends the court
and handle the state affairs...

110
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,030
as if nothing had happened. Of course...

111
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,960
Yong Lian doesn't matter to him.

112
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,860
He has so many other women
to bear his child for him.

113
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,680
He still can have many sons in the future.

114
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,900
But I can't.

115
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:31,180
I don't have any other sons.
I had only Yong Lian.

116
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,910
He is the only son I had.

117
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,210
My lock.

118
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,400
My lock.

119
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,030
My lock. Mine.

120
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,080
Go away!

121
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,720
Sister, I know that
you must resent me a lot now.

122
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:32,130
You might detest it,
but it needs to be done.

123
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,180
Because I'm your brother.

124
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:40,790
I'm the one who cares about you the most
besides father and mother.

125
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,910
Er Qing told me that
you are fine during the day.

126
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,760
But at night,
you'll sit all by yourself until daybreak.

127
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,840
Mother is very worried about you.

128
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:59,070
She can't stop crying
after her last visit here.

129
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,600
She told me that you've
turned into another person.

130
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,650
Although you still talk and smile,

131
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,840
none of your smiles are genuine.

132
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:08,810
Sister.

133
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,900
She's our mother.

134
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,450
Do you think that you can fool her?

135
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,120
She also told me that
if she had known earlier,

136
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,270
she would give up her life...

137
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,260
to fight against your marriage
to the emperor.

138
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,980
When father heard about it,
he had a huge fight with her.

139
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:35,150
He felt bad for letting
the previous emperor down,

140
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,810
He felt that he had let
the Aisin Gioro family down...

141
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:42,330
by raising such a weak daughter.

142
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,720
Back then, Gao Bin was
the Viceroy of Southern Rivers...

143
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,380
and was highly-valued
by the previous emperor.

144
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,620
He even conferred the title
"Secondary Consort" to Madam Gao.

145
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,060
Second only to you.

146
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,840
Gao family is very powerful now.

147
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,400
They are involved in the internal strife
between Zhang Ting Yu and Ortai's party.

148
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,510
We are in a delicate situation.

149
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:09,440
Sister. As the empress,
if you don't pull yourself together,

150
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:14,310
you will only make the situation
more difficult for His Majesty.

151
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,430
His Majesty asked me
to hand over this to you.

152
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:37,040
Open it when you've calmed down.

153
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,860
Consort Chun.

154
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:14,210
May I boldly ask for your help?

155
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:20,770
Mistress, Consort Chun is here.

156
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,190
Greetings, Your Majesty.

157
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,880
You may rise.

158
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,030
Are you feeling better?

159
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,480
I'm too weak.

160
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,640
Whenever the season changes,
I'll fall sick easily.

161
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,920
But I'm feeling much better now
after I take the medicine.

162
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,720
It's just an old trouble.
No need to worry about me.

163
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:01,180
That's good,
I was planning to visit you initially.

164
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:04,610
The last time I was here,

165
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,290
I noticed that your eyes
were a little bit red.

166
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,380
So, I plucked some chrysanthemums
and asked Hong Luo to blanch them.

167
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,800
You can put them under your eyes later
to let them steam your eyes.

168
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,650
You'll feel much better after that.

169
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:19,230
But be careful to not hurt your eyes.

170
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,600
You are really meticulous.
The medicinal pillow that you gave...

171
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,860
Her Majesty last time is very effective.

172
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,700
The soft rush and the peach tree branches
inside it need to be changed regularly.

173
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:36,210
When the pillow has become an old one,
I'll bring you a new one.

174
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,190
Consort Chun, you smell so good.

175
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,690
What kind of perfume powder are you using?

176
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,680
Her Highness never uses
any perfume powder.

177
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,560
I think the fragrance you meant
is from her dress.

178
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,010
Besides the smell of soap,

179
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:55,950
how can a dress smell so fragrant?

180
00:14:56,590 --> 00:15:00,250
In our palace, we'll add washing perfume
when we wash our clothes.

181
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,520
It's a powder made from
the bark of peony roots and spikenard.

182
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:08,620
If you add it in after the final wash,
it'll give you a natural fragrance.

183
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,020
She has been doing this
even before she entered the palace.

184
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:13,330
Yu Hu.

185
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,600
If you like it, I'll ask someone
to deliver it to you tomorrow.

186
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,360
Consort Chun,
you are really smart and talented.

187
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,550
If you could show His Majesty
just half of the effort...

188
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,560
that you've been spending on me,

189
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,610
it would be great.

190
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,680
Your Majesty,

191
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,200
you won't understand how I feel.

192
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,830
I'm already satisfied to be able to
spend more time with you.

193
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,560
I never hoped to be
favoured by His Majesty.

194
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:47,970
You...

195
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:55,490
I just asked you to make a pot of tea,
why are your eyes so red?

196
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,280
It's nothing, I just accidentally
hurt my eyes...

197
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,000
when I was boiling the water.

198
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,160
You were crying?

199
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,200
I didn't cry.

200
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:13,140
Your Majesty, let me speak
on behalf of Hong Luo.

201
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,620
No need to do that. Consort Chun,
I'm fine. Please don't say anything.

202
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,940
Consort Chun, continue.

203
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,040
When I entered the inner court just now,

204
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:27,130
Hong Luo was being sullen.

205
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,720
When I asked her about it,
she was faltering with her words.

206
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,280
Later on, I found out that...

207
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:36,160
she has turned 25 last year
and is qualified to leave the palace.

208
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,560
But her fiance can't wait anymore...

209
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,780
and he is going to marry someone else.

210
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,690
Hong Luo, why didn't you
talk to me about it?

211
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,080
Your Majesty, Hong Luo is indeed
qualified to leave the palace.

212
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,890
-But...
-Normally, they will inform you...

213
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,160
to let Hong Luo leave the palace
to get married.

214
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,750
But you are in a bad mood.

215
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,000
No one wants to disturb you
with such a minor matter.

216
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,880
One thing led to another and
the matter has been put off.

217
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,760
Palace maids who have reached
the qualified age to leave the palace...

218
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,440
is a small matter to me.

219
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,680
But to them, it's something that will
affect them for the rest of their lives.

220
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,760
Go to the Imperial Household Department
at once and inform them about Hong Luo.

221
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,400
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Hong Luo, I will grant you a set dowry...

222
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,839
and marry you off in style.

223
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:27,700
I will never forget about your
generosity and kindness.

224
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,020
You may rise.

225
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,640
You may leave now.

226
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,680
You are so magnanimous and
you manage the six palaces diligently.

227
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,210
There's no one better than you
as the empress.

228
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,140
Hong Luo has always been around me.

229
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,580
But I was totally in the dark.

230
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,840
Changchun Palace is right under my eyes...

231
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,290
and yet, I have let this happen.

232
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,880
Let alone entire Forbidden Palace.

233
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,650
How many mistakes are happening every day?

234
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,270
I'm an empress who has neglected her duty.

235
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,800
Consort Chun, I understand now.

236
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:23,870
What is it?

237
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,170
Fu Heng asked for your help
but you could not speak bluntly to me.

238
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,060
So, you use this kind of way
to let me see for myself...

239
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,510
the consequences of neglecting my duty.

240
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:42,440
Your Majesty,
Young Master Fuca said that...

241
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,540
you have to take a look
at the box he left you.

242
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,830
Maybe, it can make you
let go of your grudge.

243
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,580
[I am the emperor of this nation,
the son of heaven.]

244
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,000
[Yong Lian, my legitimate child,]

245
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,280
[is intelligent, precious
and extraordinary.]

246
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,930
[The name I've given him implies that
he will one day become my successor.]

247
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:34,560
[By conforming to the rules set by
my predecessors after my ascension,]

248
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:39,040
[I hereby name the successor of
Qianqing Palace in this secret edict.]

249
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,200
[He's now the Crown Prince
of this nation.]

250
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,910
[Second of July,
Qianlong first year of reign.]

251
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,480
Your Majesty, what's wrong?

252
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,060
Your Majesty.

253
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,980
He named Yong Lian...

254
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,780
as the Crown Prince.

255
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,580
When Yong Lian was still alive,

256
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,680
he was already the Crown Prince
of the Great Qing.

257
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,220
This is a good thing.

258
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:41,500
On the first day of his ascension,
he had already named his successor.

259
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:44,920
He had high hopes...

260
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:48,370
for Yong Lian.

261
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:54,680
But I had hated him and blamed him
for Yong Lian's death.

262
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,680
I wanted him to be like me.

263
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,310
But he is the emperor.

264
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,720
He's the emperor of Great Qing.

265
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,380
He is the emperor.

266
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:13,490
Your Majesty.

267
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,640
His Majesty must have been
heartbroken as well.

268
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,550
Please don't resent him any longer.

269
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,660
This is all my fault.

270
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:31,990
I couldn't protect Yong Lian well.

271
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,880
Not only he lost a son,

272
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:42,420
he also lost a successor
who he had just named.

273
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:49,100
But all these years, I've...

274
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,080
only let myself live in pain.

275
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,320
I didn't fulfil my duty as an empress.

276
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:09,910
I was wrong, Er Qing, I was wrong.

277
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,360
I was so completely wrong.

278
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,680
My father is right.

279
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,600
I'm a sinner in the Aisin Gioro family.

280
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:26,400
I'm a sinner

281
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,000
in the Aisin Gioro family.

282
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,670
No, Your Majesty. You were not wrong.

283
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,480
It's the heaven's fault for taking
the Second Prince away.

284
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,930
It's the heaven that took your life away.

285
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,150
Your Majesty.

286
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,840
Your Majesty.

287
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,920
Your Majesty, it's already midnight.

288
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,760
You should rest.

289
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

290
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,320
Er Qing, it's time for
Her Majesty to wake up.

291
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,660
Her Majesty is unwell. Let her rest more.

292
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,640
But the consorts and concubines
will come to pay respect to her soon.

293
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,670
Let's just cancel it as usual.

294
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,650
Both of you, come in.

295
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,960
Dress me up.

296
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,900
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

297
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:35,330
Usually, when I invited you for tea,
you would always reject my offer.

298
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,780
But you're quite diligent now.

299
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:42,220
It's my duty to pay my respect
to Her Majesty.

300
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,980
If Her Majesty is still not awake, there's
no point for us to wait here in vain.

301
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,000
Concubine Jia, let's go.

302
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,800
Yes, Your Highness.

303
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,350
I haven't arrived and
you are already leaving?

304
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,530
Aren't you too impatient?

305
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,350
Greetings, Your Majesty.

306
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:36,370
I thought you've forgotten about
our meeting again today.

307
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:38,260
Noble Consort Gao.

308
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,860
When you first came into the manor,

309
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:45,360
you were quite diligent at serving tea.

310
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,070
Why are you getting more and more
unruly as the years pass by?

311
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,740
Have you forgotten about
the hierarchy of status...

312
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
after entering the palace and
was conferred the title "Noble Consort"?

313
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:03,800
You may rise now, my fellow sisters.

314
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,730
-Thank you, Your Majesty.
-Thank you, Your Majesty.

315
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:17,960
Since we're all here today,

316
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,800
there are a few things that
I need to bring up.

317
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,720
Before this, I was sick.

318
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,480
Many things in the palace
have gone undone because of that.

319
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:33,070
I've fully recovered now.

320
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,340
It's time for me to tend to those matters.

321
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,400
-Noble Lady Yu.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

322
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,280
You're pregnant but you've always
suffered from weak health.

323
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,270
You need someone to take care of you.

324
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,480
Besides having the royal physician
to check your pulse daily,

325
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:56,070
the Imperial Household Department will
send someone deft to take care of you.

326
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,800
Of course, if someone continues
to be disrespectful...

327
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,560
and offensive to you,
you can come to Changchun Palace.

328
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,020
I will seek justice for you.

329
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,780
Thank you, Your Majesty.

330
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,320
You may rise.

331
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,150
And then, there's Concubine Yi.

332
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,830
She passed away at such a young age.

333
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,900
What a pity.

334
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,220
I will ask His Majesty to
give her a grand funeral.

335
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,740
Her family will be taken care of as well.

336
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,170
Your Majesty.

337
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:42,400
Concubine Yi committed suicide.

338
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,970
To be honest, if she was a palace maid
who committed this grave offence,

339
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,500
her family would either
be beheaded or exiled.

340
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,220
But you want to give her a grand funeral?

341
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,410
You wouldn't want...

342
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:05,480
everyone to follow suit, right?

343
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:11,590
I said that Concubine Yi
died from illness.

344
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,430
But you claimed that she hung herself?

345
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,140
Who is right and who is wrong here?

346
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,270
Consort Chun?

347
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,720
Of course you are right, Your Majesty.

348
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,330
Consort Xian?

349
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,680
You are right, Your Majesty.

350
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,730
What about my other sisters?

351
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,580
How can Her Majesty be wrong?
Of course she died from illness.

352
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,970
Look.

353
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:56,000
Even a Noble Lady who is new here is more
aware of the rules than Noble Consort Gao.

354
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,790
How shocking.

355
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,630
Your Majesty!

356
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:13,580
Yes. Since you said that
she died from illness, so be it.

357
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,970
I can forgive all the past misdeeds
that had happened in the palace.

358
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,840
But from now on, if anybody
stirs up troubles again,

359
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,270
I will not overlook it.

360
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:29,120
Did I make myself clear,
my fellow sisters?

361
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,040
That wench.

362
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,200
Her Majesty usually never pays attention
to the affairs in the harem.

363
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:44,240
Why was she so out of character
and showed up today?

364
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,910
Do you think I have the answer to that?

365
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,200
In my opinion, Her Majesty
has really pulled herself together,

366
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,160
A sickly cat will always be a sickly cat.

367
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,160
A rare roar doesn’t make her a tigress.

368
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:06,370
She has neglected her duties for so long.

369
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:10,050
Now, she wants to reclaim her authority?

370
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:12,300
It won't be easy for her.

371
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,240
You are right, Your Highness.

372
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:21,080
However, with Her Majesty
paying attention to the harem now,

373
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:24,410
we have to be more vigilant in the future.

374
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,100
We will see about that.

375
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,920
Let’s see how long she can last.

376
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:46,530
Your Highness, are you alright?

377
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:48,590
Please forgive me, Consort Xian!
I was wrong!

378
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:51,200
Are you blind? You bumped right into her!

379
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:53,200
You’ve ruined her dress.

380
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,600
Enough, Zhen.

381
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,600
You didn't hurt yourself, right?

382
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,300
-You may rise.
-Yes. Thank you, Your Highness.

383
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,250
Be mindful with
where you are going next time.

384
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,040
What’s wrong?

385
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:16,330
Consort Xian. My mother is gravely ill.

386
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,600
But my chief doesn't allow me
to leave the palace to visit her.

387
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,200
I am worried that I won’t be able
to see my mother for one last time.

388
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,800
That’s why I was
so absent-minded just now.

389
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,790
Which palace do you belong to?

390
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,870
I am from Ruyi Workshop.

391
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,510
If you’re telling the truth,

392
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,940
I will speak with Chief Wu
to let you go back for a visit.

393
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,140
Thank you, Your Highness!

394
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,460
I will never forget about your
generosity and kindness.

395
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,800
Sister, you are really
as virtuous as your title.

396
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,880
Everyone in the Forbidden City
knows about it.

397
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,810
After seeing it for myself today,
I realised that...

398
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,580
you've not earned the respect
of everyone in the palace...

399
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,650
for no reason.

400
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,660
It's just a simple help.
Nothing worth mentioning.

401
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,180
But your simple help...

402
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,690
is significant to everyone in the palace.

403
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,630
No wonder Noble Consort Gao
wants to be on your good side too.

404
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,200
You must be joking.

405
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:15,480
Her Majesty today is
drastically different than before.

406
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,930
It must be because of you.

407
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,380
Sister, you are overthinking it.

408
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:26,380
Her Majesty couldn't manage the affairs
before this because she was sick.

409
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:30,510
She has recovered now. So, naturally,
she has to return to her duties.

410
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,680
Among the eight of us who were
attending at the prince manor back then,

411
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,160
other than the deceased Consort Zhe,

412
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,560
as for Her Majesty,
Noble Consort Gao, Concubine Jia,

413
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,420
Noble Lady Yu and Noble Lady Wan,

414
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,600
I can actually see clearly
what each of them wants.

415
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,440
Except for you, Consort Chun.

416
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,380
I can never tell what you want.

417
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,680
What are you trying to say, Consort Xian?

418
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,300
Among the eight of us,
in terms of appearance and talent,

419
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,920
you are the most outstanding.

420
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,660
But I've never seen you
attending to His Majesty.

421
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,850
As if you're always sick.

422
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:14,240
It's because my body is too weak.

423
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,560
But whenever Her Majesty needs you,

424
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,580
you will be by her side.

425
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,800
I understand. She is
the mother of the nation.

426
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,650
She rules over the six palaces.

427
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,270
Being on her good side
will be beneficial for you.

428
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,000
But you never asked for anything.

429
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:34,810
Tell me, what is it that you really want?

430
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,760
The one who is truly aloof is you, right?

431
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,080
You don't desire for
glory, splendour, wealth or fame.

432
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:50,810
In your heart, His Majesty
is the most important person to you.

433
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,260
Look at you.
You can clearly see through everyone.

434
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,350
But what about you?
I can never see through you.

435
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,200
Since you're not attending
Noble Consort Gao's tea party,

436
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,000
will you accept my invitation
for flower viewing?

437
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,139
If it's purely
a flower viewing invitation,

438
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,250
I'll be more than happy to join you.

439
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:14,719
But if there are other reasons behind it,
forgive me for rejecting your offer then.

440
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:18,120
Sister, it's not easy to be
righteous alone...

441
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,800
in this Forbidden City.

442
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:26,540
I'm not trying to be righteous.
I just want to have a clear conscience.

443
00:34:26,969 --> 00:34:29,239
Sister, I'll be taking my leave now.

444
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,080
Sister Zhi Lan.

445
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,340
-Who are you?
-We are from the Embroidery House.

446
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,040
Madam Zhang asked us to bring
the finished spring clothes here.

447
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,620
Is there an issue?

448
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,440
Look. We are all wearing
the same palace maid outfits.

449
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,239
But you look so different from others
when you wear it.

450
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:54,699
The embroidered flowers
on your collar are beautiful too.

451
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,280
I can tell right away that
you are a skilful person.

452
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,110
You are quite a sweet talker.

453
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,720
But this perfume pouch
lacks some lustre.

454
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,320
It'll look even better if you add
an olive-coloured tassel to it.

455
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,360
Sister, I actually have some
olive-coloured threads on me.

456
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,670
If you don't mind,

457
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,150
I can add it on for you now.

458
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,840
Ling Long, we still need to rush back
to the Embroidery House.

459
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,880
What's there to be afraid of?
Go back and tell Madam Zhang that...

460
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:25,880
I want to chat with this girl for
a little longer because she looks smart.

461
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,260
Come with me.

462
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,400
An embroidery maid from
the Embroidery House is indeed skilful.

463
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,930
The colour combination
is indeed beautiful.

464
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:44,490
This is nothing. There's a girl
named Ying Luo in our Embroidery House.

465
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,760
Not only she is exceptional in her
embroidery skills, she's very intelligent.

466
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:52,960
If it wasn't because of her, we wouldn't
know so much about a loquat jelly.

467
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,790
What did you say? Loquat jelly?

468
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,720
When we were at Yong He Palace,

469
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,880
she talked about accidentally eating
a new leaf of loquat when she was young.

470
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,920
If it wasn't because of her,
we wouldn't know that...

471
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:11,050
the new leaves of loquat are poisonous
and can't be used to make a medicine.

472
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,190
Sister, did I say something wrong?

473
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,980
Of course not. We're just chatting.

474
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,680
I am relieved then.

475
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,080
Sister, I thought that you'll be annoyed
with me for chatting with you so suddenly.

476
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,640
I never thought that
you are such a nice person.

477
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:33,280
By the way, that palace maid
you mentioned...

478
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,400
is called Ying Luo?

479
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,480
Wei Ying Luo.

480
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:46,340
Not bad.

481
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,070
Ying Luo, what are you embroidering?

482
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,500
I'm embroidering clouds during sunset.

483
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,420
We can embroider all things in the world.

484
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,660
But the clouds of sunset
are hard to embroider.

485
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:06,010
When you embroider it, it'll just
look like a normal cloud. How meaningless.

486
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,660
Come and take a look at this.

487
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,360
She embroidered it so well.

488
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,010
Ying Luo, are you using the full-stitch embroidery method?

489
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,680
I think the full-stitch embroidery method
can showcase the sunset clouds the best.

490
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:37,100
Look. The red in this cloud
gradually fades into the white.

491
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,220
And then, it turns to blue.

492
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,440
By doing so, you'll be able to show
the gradation of sunset clouds.

493
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,860
Red clouds against the blue sky.
So contrasting but in harmony.

494
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,610
It's indeed beautiful.

495
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,880
Madam, I want to
embroider it on clothing next.

496
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,700
Maybe our mistresses will like it.

497
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:07,390
Miss Zhi Lan, what brings you here?

498
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,810
Is Her Highness unhappy
with her spring dresses?

499
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,040
You don't have to take the trouble
to come here in person.

500
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:17,040
You could've just sent for me and
I would go to Chuxiu Palace at once.

501
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:21,920
Her Highness is indeed unsatisfied with
the dresses. She wants a different look.

502
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:26,180
I heard that you have a very skilful
embroidery maid here, Wei Ying Luo.

503
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,580
Have her come with me.

504
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:32,080
Alright then. Let me
give her some instructions.

505
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,560
Her Highness has sent for her.
Don't cause any delay.

506
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,840
Let's go now.

507
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,920
Ying Luo!

508
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:53,640
Madam Zhang, I feel like something's off!

509
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,610
Did Wei Ying Luo commit a grave crime?

510
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:02,160
Who knows?

511
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:08,740
Looks like the good show
is about to begin.

512
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,960
What's wrong with you?

513
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,280
Greetings, Your Highnesses!

514
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:28,560
You are Wei Ying Luo?

515
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,350
Yes, Your Highness!

516
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:32,690
Why are you so loud? I'm not deaf.

517
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,740
Keep it down.

518
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:43,000
I have always been
a loud talker since young.

519
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:46,080
I was hit by Madam
for so many times already.

520
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,590
But no! I...

521
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,600
I can't change!

522
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,010
You are the one who said that
the new leaves of loquat are poisonous?

523
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,600
Yes.

524
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,470
They are poisonous. You can't eat them!

525
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:09,260
Noble Consort Gao, look.

526
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,220
It's really her.

527
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,880
Noble Consort Gao,
you want to eat loquat too?

528
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,480
Remember not to eat the pit and
don't touch the young leaves.

529
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,800
They are both poisonous.

530
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,000
When I was little, I was a glutton. Once,

531
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:34,420
I accidentally ate too many loquats.

532
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,450
I ended up vomiting and having diarrhoea.

533
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,000
I almost died. Last time,

534
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:48,340
Her Highness in Yonghe Palace
wanted to eat loquat too.

535
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:52,150
But I stopped her.

536
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,210
What a close call.

537
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,740
What nonsense is this?

538
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:59,710
You are so incoherent and unintelligible!

539
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,900
Why are you staring at me?

540
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,520
Noble Consort Gao, what are you eating?

541
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:18,020
I've never eaten
glutinous rice balls before.

542
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,450
These are sweet lotus starch balls.

543
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,560
I'm talking to you. Don't be distracted.

544
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:36,440
Noble Consort Gao, this maid
seems to be a little bit dumb.

545
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,760
Come here.

546
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,180
Have you eaten
sweet lotus starch balls before?

547
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:49,400
I will reward you with this bowl of
sweet lotus starch balls then.

548
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,600
Do you want more?

549
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,120
So delicious.
