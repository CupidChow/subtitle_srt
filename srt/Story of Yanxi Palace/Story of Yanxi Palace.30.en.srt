[Story of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 30]

3
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,560
Can you all hear that sound?

4
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,700
What sound?

5
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,420
Watch out!

6
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,670
Your Highness!

7
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,410
Get away!

8
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,850
Your Highness...

9
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,640
Your Majesty!

10
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,900
Your Majesty!

11
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,240
Your Majesty!

12
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,800
The Empress Dowager!

13
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,520
-Don't panic!
-Get the guards here! Go!

14
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,160
Protect the Empress Dowager!

15
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,620
Stop running around or you'll be punished
by the law of palace!

16
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,280
My arm!

17
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,160
Help! Help!

18
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,820
Her Majesty has fallen
off from the pavilion!

19
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,200
Your Majesty!

20
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,190
Your Majesty!

21
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,110
Your Majesty!

22
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,400
Help!

23
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,950
Save Her Majesty!

24
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,240
Your Majesty! Save Her Majesty!

25
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,750
Hurry!

26
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,120
Hurry!

27
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,600
Your Majesty, wake up.

28
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,240
Your Majesty, you've been
sitting here the entire night.

29
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,800
Perhaps some rest is needed.

30
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,400
Your Majesty, your health comes first.

31
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,120
I will be keep watch on her.

32
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,360
I will inform Your Majesty
if the Empress is awake.

33
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:26,540
Your Majesty, I can order the kitchen
to prepare some snacks for Your Majesty.

34
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,720
Enough.

35
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,680
Stop crying.

36
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,700
Leave.

37
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,240
No. I'm not going anywhere.

38
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,080
-I will keep watch here.
-Shush.

39
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,470
Thanks to your mistake,

40
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,910
Her Majesty is now unconscious.

41
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,000
Stop crying.

42
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,870
If His Majesty hears it,
you'll get the caning.

43
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,580
Quickly, go out.

44
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,610
Don't you hear me?

45
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,220
Let's go.

46
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,000
Is there any news from
the Changchun Palace?

47
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,500
Your Majesty, it's already midnight.

48
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,100
Have some rest.

49
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,640
If there is any news,
I will inform Your Majesty.

50
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,930
You shouldn't have stopped me.

51
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,340
Or else, I would be waiting
in the Changchun Palace instead.

52
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:46,270
It's better than knowing nothing
and be worried here.

53
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,970
Fu Heng!

54
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,630
Ming Yu!

55
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,330
How is my sister?

56
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,930
Her Majesty is still unconscious.

57
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,500
Imperial physicians said
she would surely lose her child.

58
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,260
-That's all we know for now.
-What is that supposed to mean?

59
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,080
-Fu Heng, where are you going?
-I'll bring Physician Ye here!

60
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,810
Miss Ming Yu,

61
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,190
-stop crying.
-It's all my fault.

62
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,810
I was too careless.

63
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,580
Had I held onto Her Majesty back then,

64
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:51,700
none of this would have happened.

65
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,560
The Yujing Pavilion was full of people.

66
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,560
Everyone was terrified by the bats,

67
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,960
people started panicking
and running around.

68
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,440
It's not like you could save
Her Majesty on your own.

69
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,550
You know nothing,
you don't know anything.

70
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,960
Ying Luo told me
no matter where we go,

71
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,060
I was to ignore all the other people.

72
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,370
My priority is to guard Her Majesty.

73
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,230
I didn't listen to her.

74
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,770
It's my fault.

75
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,650
I should have protected Her Majesty.

76
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,880
Then she wouldn't have fallen
off the Yujing Pavilion.

77
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,540
It's all my fault.

78
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,070
But what's done is done,

79
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,250
stop crying,

80
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,320
Crying will solve nothing.

81
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,039
Her Majesty is already unconscious.

82
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,400
Everything is in disarray.
If you keep crying,

83
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,280
you will bring nothing but more unrest.

84
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,180
You should think about...

85
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,940
what must be done next.

86
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,080
I must go to her.

87
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,950
I'll go to her.

88
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,900
-Miss Ming Yu!
-Let go of me!

89
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,210
Fu Heng has lost it,
so has Miss Ming Yu!

90
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,350
What's got into them?

91
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,250
Your Highness, stop worrying.

92
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,690
Her Majesty is a blessed person.
She surely will be fine.

93
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,000
His Majesty is still in
the Changchun Palace.

94
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,840
If you were there, His Majesty will be
worried for both you and the Empress.

95
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,760
It will be too much for him to handle.

96
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,360
I'm sure that there will
be good news very soon.

97
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,520
You don't usually talk much,

98
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,910
but in time of distress,

99
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,560
when all the other consorts
are in disarray,

100
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,100
even when the Empress is unconscious,

101
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,280
only you stay composed,
and put everything back in order.

102
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,620
Indeed...

103
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,600
The group of bats was everywhere,
all of us was terrified.

104
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,280
But fortunately Consort Xian was
quick to react and stayed calm,

105
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,140
she protected you, Your Majesty.

106
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,790
I too was scared at the moment.

107
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:02,110
But, Your Majesty was there,
I mustn't show any fear.

108
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,720
I forced myself to be brave,

109
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,650
should anything happened to you,
nothing I do can atone for my mistake.

110
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,160
Now,

111
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,680
the Empress is sick.

112
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,750
Noble Consort Gao got hurt.

113
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,820
But the order in the palace
must be maintained.

114
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,370
It won't be easy work for you.

115
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,200
I don't know much.

116
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,340
But Consort Chun has a sharp wit.

117
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,960
I will assist her in
managing the palace affairs,

118
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,020
I'll try to avoid making any mistake.

119
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:35,880
When the bats attacked,
Consort Chun was next to me.

120
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,140
When she saw the bats coming,
she was scared out of her wits.

121
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,400
I can't put my hopes...

122
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,470
on such a frail lady.

123
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,470
However, you...

124
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:53,730
don't act like one of
those delicate ladies,

125
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,420
you have the courage and will of a man.

126
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,330
If I entrust everything to you,

127
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,350
my mind shall be at ease.

128
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,050
I assure you, Your Majesty,

129
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,300
I will surely do my best.

130
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,970
It was supposed to be
a merry Double Ninth Festival,

131
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,200
how did everything fall apart from that?

132
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,890
Ming Yu!

133
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,650
Ying Luo!

134
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,670
What happened?

135
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,480
The Empress Dowager organized
a banquet at the Yujing Pavilion.

136
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,080
But something attracted
a large group of bats.

137
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,810
The place was in chaos.

138
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,300
Her Majesty...

139
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,640
Her Majesty fell off stone steps!

140
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,330
How is she now?

141
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,920
All physicians are
tending to her right now.

142
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,650
But Her Majesty is still unconscious.

143
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,210
Why didn't you listen to me?

144
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,040
-You must never...
-I didn't mean it!

145
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,070
There were so many people.

146
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,080
Someone pushed me and I fell.

147
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,470
Who was it?

148
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,080
Who was the first to find Her Majesty
down the stone steps?

149
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,250
[Help! Her Majesty fell off
from the pavilion!]

150
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,260
It's Noble Consort Gao.

151
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,750
She's the first one.

152
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,780
-I knew it's her.
-You suspect Noble Consort Gao?

153
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,920
No, impossible.

154
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,880
Noble Consort Gao was
holding onto Her Majesty.

155
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,480
Her arm even got dislocated.

156
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,880
If she intended to harm Her Majesty,

157
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,280
why would she save Her Majesty?

158
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,880
And did she save Her Majesty?

159
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:56,310
If she didn't, it means her action was
merely a trick to fool everyone.

160
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,930
Let's go to the Changchun Palace.

161
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,640
Are you even a physician?
Can't you tell she is in pain?

162
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,680
Your Highness, putting a dislocated arm
back in place will surely be painful.

163
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,720
Please hold on, it will be over soon.

164
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,120
There is more of this?

165
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,900
Enough!

166
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,040
You useless thing.
What was taking you so long?

167
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,040
-I will take my leave.
-I almost fainted from the pain.

168
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,900
Your Highness,

169
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,400
why have you hurt yourself?

170
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,720
-It pains me to see you get hurt.
-That's right, Your Highness.

171
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,520
Losing a hair was painful enough to you,

172
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,370
and now your whole arm is dislocated.

173
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,430
What can you possibly know?

174
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,890
I was so close to the Empress.

175
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,580
If I just watched her and did nothing,

176
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,810
won't they put all the blame...

177
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,760
on me alone?

178
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:58,950
Now,

179
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,160
I got hurt because of her.

180
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,880
Although I couldn't manage to save her,

181
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,740
I did do my best.

182
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,560
Even His Majesty can't accuse me .

183
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,100
Be gentle!

184
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,890
Yes, that was well thought.

185
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,700
I'm impressed with your resolve.

186
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,160
This plan may be too much of a cliche,

187
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,810
but it's effective.

188
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,080
Let's hurry.

189
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,120
We quickly go in, too.

190
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,040
Keep walking, Her Majesty
is still waiting for us.

191
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,150
I'm not going in.

192
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,260
Why?

193
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,820
Her Majesty banished me.

194
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,890
I no longer belong here.

195
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:05,600
Why would I go in?

196
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,260
Wei Ying Luo, I dare you
to say that again.

197
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,040
I don't belong in
the Changchun Palace anymore.

198
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,800
Why should I care if Her Majesty
is bedridden and unconscious?

199
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,360
Her Majesty was so nice to you.

200
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,690
Now she's unconscious,

201
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,250
how could you be so heartless?

202
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,600
Do you still have a conscience?

203
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,730
She's right. We've served
Her Majesty for so many years.

204
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,400
We've worked here longer than you.

205
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,320
But Her Majesty just likes you the most,

206
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,600
she favours you over Er Qing.

207
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,840
How could you be so heartless now?
Does she mean nothing to you?

208
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,760
What's wrong with visiting Her Majesty?
It's not like it will kill you!

209
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,960
You were a servant of
Changchun Palace once.

210
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,520
Have you forgotten about the bond
you once shared with your master?

211
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,510
When Her Majesty expelled me,

212
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,360
no one stood up for me.

213
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,560
I ended up being a servant
in the Labour House,

214
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,360
I suffered all kinds of hardships.

215
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,680
All of you are calling me
a heartless wretch...

216
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,740
as if you were righteous yourselves.

217
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,530
Why?

218
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,740
If I enter the room and visit Her Majesty,

219
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,130
will she wake up?

220
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,770
-You...
-If I have the time,

221
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,720
I might as well spend it working.

222
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:06,670
Otherwise I will get starved,
and you get on with your merry life.

223
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,010
-You are evil!
-Are you done now?

224
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,080
I really have works to do.

225
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,090
Unlike all of you here,

226
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,680
I am not high-ranking servant
who lives in clover.

227
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,480
I don't get food and shelter
just by asking nicely.

228
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,330
Get lost! Leave this place!

229
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,960
You're not welcome here!

230
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,640
Her Majesty is unconscious,

231
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,330
it seems like the Changchun Palace will
soon lose its grace.

232
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,770
Kneel down before me and beg,
but I don't care.

233
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,510
Get out of our sight now!

234
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,460
You scoundrel! Curse you!

235
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,680
Forget it, Ming Yu. Calm down.

236
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,810
Her Majesty's health comes first.

237
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,640
Guard Fuca!
Why are you still chasing after her?

238
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,930
Just let him be.

239
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,880
What are you doing?

240
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,839
Guard Fuca, how may I help you?

241
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,060
Ying Luo,

242
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,880
why did you do that?

243
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,660
You touched my hands just now.

244
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,560
Why don't you take a closer look?

245
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,569
Did you take a good look?

246
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,380
These were once the hands
of an embroidery maid.

247
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,860
They were once clear of
scars and callus.

248
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,410
Only a silky smooth hand is qualified
to touch the finest silks.

249
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,970
But now,

250
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,820
these hands covered in scars...

251
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,760
and open wounds.

252
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,480
Even if they heal,

253
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,250
I can't do needlework anymore.

254
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:55,770
All thanks to whom?

255
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,360
Your sister.

256
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,930
-Ying Luo…
-A few days ago, I was removing weeds.

257
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,500
Because I hoped Her Majesty
could notice me,

258
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,120
I got the caning from Madam Liu.

259
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,490
She could have scar my face for good
had she missed by an inch!

260
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,940
But right from the start,

261
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,260
Her Majesty never bothered to look at me.

262
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,750
In her eyes,

263
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,840
I'm no different from the mud...

264
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,790
on the imperial lane.

265
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,200
Since she is a heartless master,

266
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,650
why should I worry for her?

267
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,890
Ying Luo,

268
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,360
Her Majesty may have banished you
from the Changchun Palace,

269
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,520
but she did teach you how to
read and write.

270
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,080
You have all the right not
to see her as your master.

271
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,710
But she is your teacher.

272
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,960
She's now unconscious.
Is it so hard for you to visit her?

273
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,730
Why don't you see how futile that is?

274
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,000
If I go visit her,

275
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,110
will she get better?

276
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,920
I'm not an imperial physician.

277
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,440
I have no divine power either.

278
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,430
My tears won't cure any illness.

279
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,560
If I stayed here too long,

280
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,740
I'll get beaten and punished
when I get back.

281
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,770
Will any of you looking down on me
from the moral high ground...

282
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,300
take the punishment for me?

283
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,220
Do you know when the cane hits you,

284
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,980
the pain can be excruciating?

285
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,250
-Ying Luo.
-Enough!

286
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,520
From the moment Her Majesty
drove me out of her palace,

287
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:21,410
our bond as the servant and master
has been severed.

288
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,710
Fu Heng,

289
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,690
you are same as your sister.

290
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,860
You live in comfort and luxury
and adored by the people.

291
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:32,470
People like you will never
understand my pain and grievances.

292
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,630
If you keep pestering me,

293
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,920
I will just hate you even more.

294
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,740
I was told you lost your temper
at Changchun Palace last night.

295
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,480
I don't know what
you're thinking right now.

296
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,250
I thought you can read my thoughts.

297
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,240
Have a guess.

298
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,880
I guess you are up to no good right now.

299
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,280
Am I right?

300
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,450
You're wrong.

301
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,670
I'm just a lowly slave
of the Labour House.

302
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,170
The power struggle is
none of my business.

303
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,680
This time, I'll do nothing.

304
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,690
I can do nothing.

305
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:54,160
I just want to scrub my commodes
so I can get enough food for the day.

306
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,630
That's what I should do.

307
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:36,800
I've grown sick of hearing those words
from imperial physicians.

308
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:41,490
I want to know if there is any
way to make the Empress wake up.

309
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,430
I did some acupuncture treatment
on Her Majesty.

310
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:46,470
She is safe for now, however...

311
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,600
It's hard to tell when she will
regain her consciousness.

312
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,220
Even you are out of methods?

313
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,760
Her Majesty's head suffered trauma injury,
she suffers from severe haemorrhage.

314
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,640
Now, she's unconscious and
her pulse is weak.

315
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,880
Her illness is too severe
for her weak body.

316
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,940
We can only do our best and
leave the rest to fate's will.

317
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,350
May the odds be with her.

318
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,200
May she has the blessing of heaven
and regain her consciousness.

319
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,340
Your Highness.

320
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:36,410
-You...
-What did Physician Ye say?

321
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,180
When will Her Majesty wake up?

322
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,760
Not even Physician Ye can be sure.

323
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,040
He can only do his best and
leave the rest to the heaven.

324
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,010
Fu Heng!

325
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,680
Sister, why are you here?

326
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,070
Why are you teary-eyed?

327
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,930
Is Her Majesty not doing very well?

328
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,010
Her Majesty is still unconscious.

329
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,820
I was too anxious,

330
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,330
I couldn't contain myself.

331
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,020
Don't worry.

332
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,760
I know you all too well.

333
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,410
Let's go in. I accompany you
to visit Her Majesty.

334
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,160
There are still bats at the back.

335
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,340
Quick!

336
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,110
How is the investigation?

337
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,880
The Empress Dowager
emphasizes healthy diet,

338
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,520
she ordered the kitchen to prepare
deer's blood in the form of cube.

339
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,440
The stench was too much
for Her Majesty.

340
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,560
She had it removed as soon as
the food was served.

341
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,520
A handmaiden tripped herself
and spilled the blood all over the place.

342
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,840
The stench was too strong,

343
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,800
it attracted the colony of bats
from the forest nearby.

344
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,000
We indeed discover
a lot of bat's nests.

345
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:24,720
The servants here also verified that
groups of bats are seen here often.

346
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:28,840
The bats never showed up
in such a large group.

347
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,600
[There were over
a thousand bats that night.]

348
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,320
[Something is at miss.]

349
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:36,920
You mean this was planned?

350
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,920
Where's the palace maid
who spilled the blood?

351
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,200
She fell off from the railings
of the Yujing Pavilion.

352
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,710
She died on the scene.

353
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,320
So now we don't have any witness.

354
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,240
What did all the other people
on the scene say?

355
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,200
I've already sent people to
interrogate all the servants on the scene.

356
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,560
Everyone say that the bats
had knocked over the lamps.

357
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,320
[It was chaotic everywhere.]

358
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,020
[No one saw who pushed Her Majesty.]

359
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,260
What about the Chuxiu Palace?

360
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,290
You suspect Noble Consort Gao?

361
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,760
She was the closest to Her Majesty,
that makes her the major suspect.

362
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:20,890
But Noble Consort Gao dislocated her arm
while trying to save Her Majesty.

363
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:25,250
She is still recovering from the injury
after her arm has been treated.

364
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,090
We don't have any solid evidence.

365
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,360
The best way is to wait
for Her Majesty to wake up.

366
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,530
Have you heard it?

367
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,320
Her Majesty has been
unconscious for over ten days.

368
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,980
She still hasn't woken up yet.

369
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,480
Duixiu Mountain is so tall,
and the steps are so steep.

370
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,120
It's already fortunate for
Her Majesty to still be alive.

371
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,720
But with her bedridden,
what about the palace?

372
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,330
I think Consort Xian is
more generous than Her Majesty.

373
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,040
When Her Majesty took
charge of the imperial harem,

374
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,920
she always ordered us to be frugal.

375
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,800
She even ordered to
have all the expanses cut.

376
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,530
Now Consort Xian is in charge,
we can finally have decent food.

377
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,270
Her Majesty used to be your master.

378
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,570
You really are cold and heartless.

379
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:30,640
It's no wonder why people
think you are a heartless fiend.

380
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,520
If you are scared, why are you
picking a fight with me?

381
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,600
What is going on in your puny mind?

382
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,200
If you are doing this just
to feel better for yourself,

383
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,200
you might as well just save it
and get back to your work!

384
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,950
Jin Xiu, don't you have work to do?

385
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,380
Send the milk to Chuxiu Palace now.

386
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:54,550
Madam,

387
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,600
why is it always me?

388
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:00,560
The milk is so heavy and I have
to make three runs in a row.

389
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,410
-I don't want to do it.
-And who should I send then?

390
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,800
Stop nagging or you will
get the caning.

391
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,450
She can go instead.

392
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,500
Isn't it the newcomer's job to send milk
to Chuxiu Palace?

393
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,020
Madam, you set this rule yourself.

394
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,290
Fine. I'll go then.

395
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,000
Fine, you still have works to do.
Cut the weeds at the three palaces.

396
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,030
Yes.

397
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,800
Do you think sending milk
is easier than cleaning commodes?

398
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,260
Let me tell you something,

399
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:38,190
you'll have much to put up to
once you are at the Chuxiu Palace.

400
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,460
What took you so long?
Some beating could make you walk faster!

401
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,030
Oh, an old acquaintance.

402
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:18,390
Sister Zhi Lan, I'm here to deliver milk.

403
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,730
Her Highness is waiting for it.
Go on now.

404
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,870
Yes.

405
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,280
Wei Ying Luo?

406
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,710
You have fallen so far off your grace
since you left the Changchun Palace.

407
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,880
You were once so full of life before.

408
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,120
Now you are exposed
to all kinds of hardships,

409
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,920
perhaps I should offer you some aid.

410
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,330
Your Highness,

411
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,060
I've delivered you the milk.

412
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,740
I'll take my leave.

413
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,440
Her Highness gifted you milk.
That's a great grace.

414
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,440
You haven't shown your gratitude,
you are not leaving.

415
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,810
What else do you want?

416
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,330
Look at her once delicate hands.

417
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,400
They have now become
coarse and scarred.

418
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,910
Why don't I just remove them for you,

419
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,300
so they'll stop being an eyesore.

420
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Don't worry. I'll order the craftsman...

421
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,640
to make you a pair of wooden hands.

422
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:05,440
I guarantee they'll be more powerful
than what you have here.

423
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,540
What?

424
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,250
Why are you glaring at me?

425
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,770
Perhaps I should remove your eyes as well!

426
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,270
Greetings to Your Majesty.

427
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,210
Where's Noble Consort Gao?

428
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,470
Noble Consort Gao is...

429
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,290
Your Highness, His Majesty is here!

430
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,490
Your Highness, His Majesty is here!

431
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,370
Wei Ying Luo, seal your lips
if you want to live.

432
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,450
Otherwise you will leave this place
as a dead corpse.

433
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,970
Your Majesty!

434
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,900
Rise.

435
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,040
Your arm was dislocated,

436
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,640
you should be resting in bed.

437
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,560
The imperial physician
has already set my bone.

438
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,890
I feel much better.

439
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,800
I was just ordering them
to carry water for my bath,

440
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:05,850
and then I ran into this servant.

441
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,090
She was so clumsy she spilled the milk.

442
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,620
Look.

443
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,890
My dress is already wet.

444
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,200
You clumsy fool, leave.

445
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,450
Yes.

446
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,350
Your Majesty,

447
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,160
why didn't you inform me
you would be visiting?

448
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,790
I could have made some preparations.

449
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,560
Look at the water in the hall.
It's a mess.

450
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,910
I hear that you're sick,
so I come to check on you.

451
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:49,090
Since you're fine,
I'll return to Yangxin Hall now.

452
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,500
Li Yu,

453
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:52,060
leave the gift here.

454
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,360
Rest and get well.

455
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,020
Your Majesty!

456
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,210
Your Majesty!

457
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:09,350
Your Majesty, what are you searching for
in this downpour?

458
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,230
Your Majesty!

459
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:17,590
Your Majesty!

460
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,560
Your Majesty!

461
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,960
Your Majesty, that's...

462
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,500
Stop acting like a pity little thing.

463
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:55,950
I hate pretentious women like you!

464
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,670
-Get out of my sight!
-Your...

465
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,650
Quick! Your Majesty!

466
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,960
Your Majesty,

467
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,889
even if you leave
Miss Ying Luo the umbrella,

468
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,520
she wouldn't dare to use it.

469
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,360
It's an umbrella for the Emperor.

470
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,270
If she takes it back and uses it,

471
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:35,370
she will be in grave danger.

472
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,540
She's born with rebellious mind.

473
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,780
She had it coming.

474
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,590
Li Yu,

475
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:44,000
when does it become a trend to
bathe in milk in the palace?

476
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,230
Your Majesty.

477
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,980
Noble Consort Gao takes care of her skin
all because she wants to please you.

478
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,340
It's understandable.

479
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,750
The milk is supplied to
the kitchen for cooking purposes.

480
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,350
No one is allowed to waste it!

481
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,760
Starting from today,

482
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:01,050
send out my order,

483
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,920
the palaces should be supplied the milk
based on their ranks.

484
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,720
No waste of milk is to be allowed.

485
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,610
Did you get it?

486
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,700
Yes.

487
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,620
Your Majesty!

488
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,420
Stop!

489
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:54,060
Your Highness, the weeding servant
from Labour House has passed out.

490
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,490
Have the imperial physician examine her.

491
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,340
Let's go.

492
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,280
Count yourself fortunate to
have ran into Consort Xian.

493
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,940
The other consorts wouldn't care
if you were dead or alive.

494
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:31,400
That's right. Among the masters
in the whole Forbidden City,

495
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,930
only Consort Xian
has such benevolent heart.

496
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,520
Don't you ever forget her kindness,
pray for her when you pray for yourself.

497
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,050
Where am I?

498
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,170
Seeing you're sick,

499
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,560
Madam Liu moved you into the stockroom.

500
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,800
Come.

501
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,940
Get up.

502
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:56,520
Since you're sick, so stop hiding it.

503
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,550
You...

504
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,670
If they hadn't found you,

505
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:03,140
you could have died on the way here.

506
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,050
Here. Drink your medicine.

507
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,680
I am fine.

508
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,350
I was drenched in the rain,

509
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,980
I caught a cold.

510
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,890
Stop acting like you are tough.

511
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,890
You clearly had a bad history
with Chuxiu Palace.

512
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,890
You still volunteered to go there.

513
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,920
Are you crazy?

514
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,930
If I'm able to hide from it once
but not forever.

515
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,840
I can't avoid them forever.

516
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,980
Drink this first.

517
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:39,370
You can fool the others,

518
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,230
but not me.

519
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,120
Be honest with me.

520
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,040
Why did you provoke Noble Consort Gao?

521
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,640
Say it.

522
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,900
I feel a bit dizzy.

523
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,950
I'll sleep for a while.

524
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,550
You should know better.

525
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,080
You are too full of yourself.

526
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,900
Look at yourself now.

527
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,900
I'm really mad now.

528
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,480
Listen up, other than me,

529
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,440
no one else will care for you.

530
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,420
Don't risk your life again.

531
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,900
You hear me?

532
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,010
Keep that in mind.

533
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:09,840
Master Fu Heng, why are you here?

534
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,310
Just taking a walk.

535
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,500
I did see you order the eunuch...

536
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,140
to bribe the supervisor of Labour House.

537
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,950
You are mistaken.

538
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,510
I thought you have shady deals.

539
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,640
You are abandoning your code
over Wei Ying Luo?

540
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,840
Shut up!

541
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,320
I know you too well. You want the others
to take care of her for you.

542
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,230
Where are you going?
Wait for me!

543
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,520
How is your arm?

544
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:46,680
Your Majesty,
my arm is feeling much better.

545
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,510
Thank you for worrying.

546
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,660
But I wasn't able to react quicker,

547
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:55,760
I failed to save Her Majesty in the end.

548
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,140
You've tried your best.

549
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,890
It's just that misfortunes
are following the Empress,

550
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,900
hence, an accident like that happened.

551
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:10,800
These days, not only Your Majesty
has been worrying.

552
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:13,110
Even His Majesty rarely smiled.

553
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,600
In a few days, it will be your birthday.

554
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,940
I am thinking of organizing it well.

555
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:26,220
There's still six months
before my birthday.

556
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,500
You're too anxious.

557
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,880
Now,

558
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,130
It's miserably gloomy
here in Changchun Palace.

559
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,480
How can I be in the mood to celebrate?

560
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,160
Your Majesty, just because of this,

561
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,990
I invited an acrobatic troupe...

562
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,520
to perform for you and His Majesty,

563
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,440
it will make the celebration more lively.

564
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,800
It should clear the gloomy atmosphere
we've been have as of late.

565
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,940
We don't want everyone to
put on a long face and live in fear.

566
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,970
Your Highness, Consort Xian is here.

567
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,560
Let her in.

568
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,940
Greetings to the Empress Dowager.

569
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,830
You come just in time.

570
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:23,320
I've read the bookkeeping records
you've sent me yesterday.

571
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:27,730
Are you confident that you'll be able
to handle the opening of the moat?

572
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,520
Open the moat?

573
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,500
What do you mean?

574
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,320
Since the sixteenth year of
Emperor Kangxi's reign,

575
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,200
the moat had lotus roots and
water chestnuts planted in it.

576
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,050
But we only use one forth
of these for food.

577
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,000
The rest are just wasted.

578
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,520
Hence, I suggested to
the Empress Dowager to sell...

579
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,080
the lotus roots and
water chestnuts as goods.

580
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,920
Also, conducting fish farming and
breed waterfowl within the moat.

581
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,780
All the money earned would be recorded.

582
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,400
How much can we get from that?

583
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,600
Not to mention it takes quite the effort.

584
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,250
Many a little makes a Mickle,

585
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:07,320
even the small amount will
accumulate to a great number.

586
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:10,120
The easiest method
is to rent out the lotus garden.

587
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,760
I've calculated the number.

588
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:15,700
We can collect 125 teals of silver
and nine coins of rent every year.

589
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,230
It's still an income.

590
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:21,560
You start meddling with the rules of
the palace as soon as you are in charge.

591
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,960
That seems inadequate.

592
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,090
Old rules may not be always good.

593
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:28,810
The Imperial Household Department
used to run 26 pawnshops.

594
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,320
His Majesty has closed
15 of them this year.

595
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,840
All the money are loaned to businessmen.

596
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,400
The interest alone was far more lucrative
than over revenue of pawnshop.

597
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,640
There are also old rules that
couldn't be applied anymore.

598
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,240
During the reign of Emperor Kangxi,

599
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,160
there are only 57,000 mu of farmland.

600
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,160
Now, it has doubled.

601
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,290
If we keep following the old rules,

602
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,840
we can never handle
all the new properties.

603
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:53,220
Managing finances it's not
about earning more money,

604
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,120
but to let the people
in the palace see that...

605
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:59,680
Qing Dynasty is not the same as
rulers Ming Dynasty who enjoyed luxuries.

606
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:03,270
All the expenses will be
reduced by around ten percent.

607
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:06,490
The budget plans are being
implemented everywhere.

608
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,000
If everyone in the palace
follow our practices,

609
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,290
that will truly be worthy of celebrating.
