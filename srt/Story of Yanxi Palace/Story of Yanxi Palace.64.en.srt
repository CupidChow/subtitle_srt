[Story of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 64]

3
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,170
An imperial consort that's favoured...

4
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:58,130
can make people so jealous...

5
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:01,070
and mad!

6
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,780
You are really crazy!

7
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,190
Yes,

8
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,430
I'm crazy.

9
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,220
But as a crazy woman,

10
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,250
I can't leave on my own, right?

11
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,750
Your Majesty!

12
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,530
It's you!

13
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,510
It's all your fault!

14
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,130
All your fault!

15
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,750
You all deserve to die!

16
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,490
You all deserve to die!

17
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,900
Why?

18
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:53,040
Why didn't the heavens punish you?

19
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,490
Why?

20
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,540
Why?

21
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,940
Take her away...

22
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,530
and put her in custody in Lijing Hall.

23
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,920
Wei Ying Luo, come inside with me.

24
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:32,579
When...

25
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,000
did you find out?

26
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,270
When did Your Majesty know?

27
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,900
You clearly knew there was
something wrong with Concubine Shun,

28
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,160
but you deliberately fell into her trap.

29
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,070
Were you trying to make me worried?

30
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,600
You were clearly
suspecting Concubine Shun,

31
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,870
but you deliberately covered it up.

32
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,829
Were you trying to test me?

33
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,310
Why would I?

34
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,510
Why would I try to make
Your Majesty worried?

35
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,720
Wei Ying Luo,

36
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,500
you deliberately used
Concubine Shun to see...

37
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,960
if I would...

38
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,410
go crazy from being mad at you!

39
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,150
Your Majesty,

40
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,500
you used Concubine Shun...

41
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:16,970
to see if Fu Heng and I would elope.

42
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,329
Your suspicion was groundless!

43
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:23,180
Your Majesty suspected Concubine Shun...

44
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,480
and ordered Hailan Cha
to investigate her covertly.

45
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,660
After learning the secret about her,

46
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,420
you could've stopped her,

47
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,620
but you let the matter escalate.

48
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,110
If an Emperor suspects his
imperial concubine is having an affair,

49
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,840
the first thing he should do...

50
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,100
is to put her in custody and interrogate.

51
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,650
Catching her in the act
is indeed more exciting.

52
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,610
But if it gets out,

53
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,750
it will tarnish
the prestige of the royal family.

54
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,650
Your Majesty took such a big risk...

55
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,260
just because you wanted to test me.

56
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,770
Of course, I would do my best...

57
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,850
to satisfy Your Majesty.

58
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,400
Earlier, I was...

59
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,490
hiding in a corner.

60
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:14,090
I saw how pale you were.

61
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,100
You didn't even have
the courage to open the lid of the jar.

62
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,140
Rubbish!

63
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,080
I was mad...

64
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,130
about my imperial consort
having an affair!

65
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,250
Really?

66
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,460
What else could it be then?

67
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,890
I'm guessing...

68
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,820
that you favoured Concubine Shun...

69
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,690
because you wanted me to get jealous.

70
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,990
Or else, how come those frequent gifts...

71
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,940
were all jewellery?

72
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:55,230
Apparently you wanted her to wear them...

73
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,750
so I'd get jealous?

74
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:59,840
Wei Ying Luo.

75
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,390
You are too assuming!

76
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:08,990
I favoured Concubine Shun
to pacify the Niohuru clan.

77
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,680
Even if I didn't love Concubine Shun,

78
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,180
that doesn't mean I love you.

79
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:19,960
What's wrong?

80
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,680
What's wrong?

81
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,770
Li Yu!

82
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:27,760
I'm here.

83
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,410
Go and get Ye Tian Shi.

84
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,950
Yes. I'll go get him right away.

85
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,080
Hurry!

86
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,470
Your Majesty,

87
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,930
you're not worried about me at all.

88
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,320
Not at all!

89
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,990
-You!
-Your Majesty.

90
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:47,830
Your Majesty.

91
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:51,370
Empress Dowager is calling
for Her Highness Consort Ling.

92
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,700
Your Majesty.

93
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:58,240
Save me! I'm in trouble!

94
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,600
You're saying there was no reincarnation?

95
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,390
It was all my fault.

96
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,360
Empress Dowager, please forgive me.

97
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,100
Wei Ying Luo!

98
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,280
How dare you!

99
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,790
How dare you!

100
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,230
-Consort Ling!
-Empress Dowager!

101
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,590
How could you do such a thing?

102
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,190
Do you know how happy
Empress Dowager was...

103
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,110
thinking that Princess He An was back?

104
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,170
Empress Dowager,

105
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,220
I know that my sin is unforgivable.

106
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,630
I'm willing to accept
any form of punishment.

107
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,470
I just wish that you can stop being angry.

108
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,130
I can't forgive you.

109
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:38,260
I will never forgive you!

110
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,900
Servants!

111
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,810
Empress Dowager.

112
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,800
Empress Dowager.

113
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:53,440
Ying Luo was just trying
to rescue someone,

114
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,490
hence she made up this big lie...

115
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,530
out of desperation.

116
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,640
Please forgive her.

117
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,530
At this point,

118
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,800
you are still siding with her?

119
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,660
Actually, I knew...

120
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,760
about this matter too.

121
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:21,270
So, you two colluded to deceive me!

122
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,380
No.

123
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,530
Ying Luo did it...

124
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,560
to protect Concubine Shun...

125
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,310
while I...

126
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:33,270
just wanted to make you happy.

127
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,880
I've been deceived by...

128
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,490
this lie for so long.

129
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:45,910
And now,

130
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,390
you are telling me that
you did it to make me happy?

131
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,990
What a joke!

132
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,030
What a big joke!

133
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,370
Emperor,

134
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:05,580
I understand your intention to be filial.

135
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,950
But I will never forgive her!

136
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,030
Empress Dowager!

137
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,130
Empress Dowager!

138
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,210
It's all my fault.

139
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,400
Ying Luo!

140
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,840
Ying Luo!

141
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,160
Congratulations, Empress Dowager!

142
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,980
Congratulations, Your Majesty!

143
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,310
What's wrong with Consort Ling?

144
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:55,130
Your Majesty, Consort Ling is pregnant.

145
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,200
What did you say?

146
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,340
Based on her pulse,

147
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,300
it's been three months.

148
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,610
[Your Majesty!]

149
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,620
Congratulations, Your Majesty!

150
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:38,980
This is a serious matter!

151
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:41,770
Why didn't you tell me...

152
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,070
such great news?

153
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,020
I'm quite weak...

154
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,830
and have irregular periods.

155
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,940
I couldn't even be sure myself.

156
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,860
How could I tell you?

157
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,310
Consort Ling.

158
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,110
Empress Dowager, please ask.

159
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,630
He An really didn't come back?

160
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,280
Empress Dowager,

161
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,450
Concubine Shun isn't He An.

162
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,070
The Princess is dead.

163
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,560
You're good.

164
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,370
Very good.

165
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,240
Your Majesty,

166
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,490
I was so scared earlier.

167
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,570
Empress Dowager looked so frightening.

168
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,810
If I didn't come,

169
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:49,110
Empress Dowager would
really have killed you.

170
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,740
She wouldn't.

171
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:58,790
I'm pregnant with your child.

172
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,190
She wouldn't kill me.

173
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,890
And you still claim that you didn't know?

174
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,290
I knew about it...

175
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,930
when I was locked up in my Palace.

176
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,150
But Your Majesty,

177
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,460
when I was locked up,

178
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:21,130
those servants wanted
to starve me to death.

179
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:22,330
No.

180
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,640
They wanted to starve
Your Majesty's son to death.

181
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,950
They even said Your Majesty ordered it.

182
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,440
These scoundrels!

183
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,770
They should be sliced into pieces.

184
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,400
When have I said those words?

185
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,730
But it was you...

186
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,920
who locked me up in Yanxi Palace.

187
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,300
Back then,

188
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,890
if I didn't do that,

189
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:44,830
Empress Dowager would
surely have killed you.

190
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:50,420
Your Majesty said that
you didn't care about me.

191
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,860
I almost believed it.

192
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,070
Don't flatter yourself.

193
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,130
I'm not concerned about you.

194
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,240
I'm concerned...

195
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,910
about the child in your womb.

196
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:09,000
Your Majesty,

197
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,350
I hope that this is a prince.

198
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,060
Why?

199
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,490
If it's a princess,

200
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,840
she'll also bear children in the future.

201
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,230
That is a gate to hell.

202
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,280
Ying Luo,

203
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,080
Thank you for doing this!

204
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:43,900
Regardless of others,

205
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,630
I'm risking my life...

206
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,070
just for you.

207
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,220
Yet you still treat me like this.

208
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:55,230
I...

209
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,700
treated you coldly...

210
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,610
and kept testing you...

211
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,850
because I wanted to find out...

212
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,970
if you truly have placed me...

213
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,430
in your heart.

214
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,430
Your Majesty,

215
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,010
a woman...

216
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,420
will only be willing to bear children
for the man she loves.

217
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,320
Supervisor Li.

218
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:37,830
Greetings, Your Majesty.

219
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,080
Supervisor Li, what brings you here?

220
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,120
Arrest him.

221
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,030
Supervisor Li!

222
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,510
What are you doing?

223
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:51,040
Yuan Chun Wang, you haven't forgotten...

224
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,750
what you've done to Consort Ling, right?

225
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,730
I only followed the imperial decree.

226
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:57,330
Supervisor Li. Did I do anything wrong?

227
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,970
Did His Majesty tell you to stop
the food supply of Yanxi Palace?

228
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:04,090
Supervisor Li, you should know that...

229
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:07,070
Consort Ling has a stomach problem.

230
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,100
Providing her congee every day...

231
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,070
was for the good of her health.

232
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,830
What stomach problem?

233
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:15,500
Consort Ling is pregnant!

234
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,370
Impossible!

235
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:21,970
This is impossible!

236
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:25,200
Consort Ling has been locked up
in her palace for so long!

237
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,400
How could she have the chance…

238
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,950
Consort Ling has been pregnant
for more than three months,

239
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:31,550
which is consistent with
the chamber records.

240
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,030
Even the imperial physician...

241
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,580
on duty can't escape punishment,

242
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,540
let alone you!

243
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:38,070
If you want to explain,

244
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,210
just save it for
the Bureau of Internal Affair.

245
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,590
Take him away!

246
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,440
-No!
-Get lost.

247
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:54,010
Your Majesty, I'll take my leave now.

248
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,410
Consort Ling, good for you!

249
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,200
Your Majesty,
I beg you to save Yuan Chun Wang.

250
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,330
He has spared no effort to serve you.

251
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:07,440
He has always been loyal.

252
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,450
Idiot!

253
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,790
Why didn't Li Yu wait for
Yuan Chun Wang...

254
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:13,190
to leave this palace before arresting him?

255
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,780
His Majesty is venting his anger on me...

256
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,840
for Consort Ling's suffering.

257
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,920
He wanted to arrest
Yuan Chun Wang in front of me...

258
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,700
to show his rage against me.

259
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,370
That is Yuan Chun Wang's fate.

260
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,690
He has to accept it!

261
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,550
Your Majesty!

262
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,760
Your Majesty!

263
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,200
Greetings, Consort Ling.

264
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:50,980
What are you doing?

265
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:54,200
His Majesty ordered to lock Lijing Hall.

266
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,630
Your Highness, don't pity Concubine Shun.

267
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:01,820
She's so vicious.

268
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,560
I even got caned 30 times...

269
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,050
and was bedridden
in Anle Hall for a month.

270
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,010
I almost didn't make it.

271
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:37,540
You are quite good at
pretending to be a crazy woman...

272
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,180
so that you can be alive.

273
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,360
You're here.

274
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,640
Right.

275
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,010
I'm here.

276
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,210
Why are you here?

277
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:55,330
I came to tell you that...

278
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:58,220
because of your assassination attempt,

279
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,950
your three older brothers
have been implicated.

280
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,960
They have either been executed...

281
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:04,700
or exiled.

282
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:20,960
You don't need to act...

283
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,020
in front of me.

284
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,460
Chen Bi.

285
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,470
at the start, I didn't understand.

286
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,560
You had so many chances
to kill His Majesty.

287
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:45,200
Why did you have to attempt
to assassinate him in public?

288
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,470
You clearly knew that...

289
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,830
if you do such a thing,

290
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:49,830
your clan would be affected.

291
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,970
Now, I understand.

292
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,080
What you've always wanted is...

293
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,990
for them to be punished.

294
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,080
Is that so?

295
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,650
You did everything to harm me.

296
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,250
You would even sacrifice yourself!

297
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:16,460
Everything you did
was so extreme and crazy.

298
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:19,110
Can you tell me why?

299
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,370
Aibida...

300
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:30,060
has always remembered the defeat and
death of his biological brother, Ne Qin.

301
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,740
He feared that he had
no more chance to be promoted,

302
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:38,170
so he searched for
beautiful women in the nation...

303
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,980
to present to the Emperor of Great Qing.

304
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,430
He then chose me.

305
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,030
I already...

306
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:48,910
know that.

307
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,650
But do you know that...

308
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,700
he got me drunk...

309
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,690
and delivered me into a horse carriage?

310
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,550
When I woke up,

311
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,300
he threatened me...

312
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:08,160
with my son's life!

313
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,550
Left with no choice,

314
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,360
I could only agree to his demands.

315
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,360
Since you'd already agreed,

316
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,110
why did you still stir up troubles?

317
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:23,850
On the way over,

318
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,260
the servant couldn't help...

319
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:31,290
but tell me...

320
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,040
that Xia snuck out.

321
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,850
He said that he wanted to find his mother.

322
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,560
However, Aibida found out about this...

323
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:46,230
and chased after him throughout the night.

324
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,180
He accidentally...

325
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:55,370
fell down into...

326
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,880
a trap set up to hunt animals.

327
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:05,460
I wanted to follow Xia
and leave this world,

328
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,670
but Fu Heng meddled...

329
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,340
and saved me.

330
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:14,970
Just like that,

331
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,630
I arrived in the Forbidden City.

332
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:21,190
I understand now.

333
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:25,430
You wanted to force His Majesty...

334
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,190
to kill Fu Heng and I.

335
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:34,450
Getting betrayed by his imperial consort
and favoured official...

336
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,930
would also deliver
a fatal blow to the Emperor.

337
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,990
I...

338
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,520
was just a victim.

339
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,550
Don't make yourself look so innocent.

340
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:59,760
Wei Ying Luo, you are an amazing woman.

341
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,470
But I know you better than...

342
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,470
anyone else in the Forbidden City!

343
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,990
What do you know about me?

344
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,550
Since Ming Yu died,

345
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,490
you've started suspecting me.

346
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,680
You didn't directly confront me,

347
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:16,750
but went to Yangxin Hall instead.

348
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,010
You probably wanted to tell His Majesty,

349
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,790
but His Majesty got misled by me...

350
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:22,950
and wouldn't see you.

351
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:26,480
After leaving Yangxin Hall,
you've already come up with a plan.

352
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,890
You carried the kit with you,

353
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:30,890
forcing me to attack you,

354
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:35,060
then got grounded intentionally.

355
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:37,030
Really?

356
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,390
First,

357
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:42,760
you used the Empress and I...

358
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:45,970
to get yourself
in a situation miserably...

359
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,990
in order to make me expose myself.

360
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,300
Second,

361
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,370
through the elopement matter,

362
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,330
you made His Majesty realise...

363
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:56,180
how much he cares about you.

364
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,030
But once he learns of the truth,

365
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,980
he'll surely feel guilty.

366
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:04,930
Look.

367
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:09,540
Everything was schemed by me.

368
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:11,820
You're so innocent,

369
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:13,550
so loyal...

370
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,110
and so pitiful.

371
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,580
And Fu Heng,

372
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,160
between you and himself,

373
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:24,230
he chose to fulfill your wish.

374
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:26,370
He didn't fulfill my wish.

375
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,730
He just knows me well.

376
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:33,270
Since I chose to enter the palace
to become an imperial consort,

377
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,620
I will never turn back.

378
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:36,220
Wei Ying Luo,

379
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,630
I'm guessing that...

380
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,390
you still have a third card, am I right?

381
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,200
I'm pregnant.

382
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:54,220
Wei Ying Luo...

383
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:56,800
You're really good.

384
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,870
I've said all I wanted to say.

385
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:04,160
It's time to part.

386
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,980
How come I've never heard you
mention your husband?

387
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,510
Where is he?

388
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:29,410
I don't have a husband.

389
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,280
If you don't have a husband,

390
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:34,210
where did your son come from?

391
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:39,070
Having a beautiful face
is not necessarily a good thing.

392
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:41,810
A gift...

393
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:44,660
that only drifted with the flow.

394
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,430
How could there be a husband?

395
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,390
Wei Ying Luo,

396
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,610
you are very fortunate.

397
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:57,260
You are loved by two men.

398
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,540
Even if I've employed all the tricks,

399
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:04,020
I still couldn't get
His Majesty's true love.

400
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,930
No matter how much I convinced him,

401
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,340
Fu Heng still chose to protect you.

402
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:11,320
I want to ask,

403
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,770
which one...

404
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:16,220
do you really love?

405
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,550
Chen Bi,

406
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,270
continue to be crazy.

407
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,450
As long as you stay crazy,

408
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,130
you can be alive.

409
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:33,280
Take care.

410
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:12,520
Supervisor Yuan.

411
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,550
I feel sorry for you.

412
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,750
Scoundrel.

413
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:26,540
You've been acting.

414
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,660
I'm a traitorous servant.

415
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:36,610
Consort Ling gave me
a chance to start over.

416
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,060
How could I not cherish it?

417
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,120
Moreover,

418
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,240
there are too many
lowly eunuchs like me...

419
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,960
in the Forbidden City.

420
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:50,650
If I want to stand out,

421
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:53,210
I must be loyal to my mistress,

422
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,170
relying on her to climb up.

423
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,380
Once she taught me,

424
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,040
I already knew...

425
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:04,570
it was only an act
to make you drop your guard.

426
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,570
And I...

427
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,510
was like Huang Gai.

428
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,340
Hence,

429
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:18,030
you came here to brag?

430
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:24,220
You're being released.

431
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,650
The Bureau of Internal Affair
sentenced you to 200 strokes of caning.

432
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:35,550
Consort Ling pardoned you...

433
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,060
and won't kill you.

434
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,730
I have a message from her for you.

435
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,470
What she owed you...

436
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,550
has now been totally repaid.

437
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,540
From this day on,

438
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:56,330
she and you will part ways.

439
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:58,310
No connections anymore.

440
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,460
Dream on!

441
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:13,800
Your Majesty,

442
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,080
I have changed your water.

443
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:20,250
If you want to beg for leniency
on behalf of Yuan Chun Wang,

444
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,720
don't bother saying it.

445
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:26,380
Your Majesty,

446
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:29,840
even if Yuan Chun Wang
committed a grave mistake,

447
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,660
it was also for your sake.

448
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,590
He used my name
to settle a personal grudge.

449
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,270
How was that for my sake?

450
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,110
Your Majesty,

451
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,730
even though
Yuan Chun Wang had his own intentions,

452
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:47,600
he was indeed capable
in fulfilling his tasks.

453
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,190
You need him by your side.

454
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,830
Your Majesty,

455
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:52,440
to give him one more chance.

456
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,780
He surely will be more careful
in doing his tasks from now on,

457
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,580
not leaving any traces.

458
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:00,390
I don't have a servant
that's unruly like that.

459
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,280
Your Majesty.

460
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,560
Why did you fall in love...

461
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,830
with such a scheming man?

462
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:13,070
Zhen, you won't benefit from that.

463
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,180
Your Majesty.

464
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,210
Please forgive him...

465
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,930
for old time's sake.

466
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,630
I will be grateful to you forever!

467
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:23,890
Rise now.

468
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:26,180
Your Majesty, I'm begging you.

469
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,110
Forget it.

470
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,850
Thank you, Your Highness.

471
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:40,790
I'll tell him to go back now and rest.

472
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:41,840
No.

473
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,680
Let him kneel at another place.

474
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:56,790
Your Highness, Yuan Chun Wang
has been kneeling outside.

475
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,870
He said that Empress ordered him
to come here and seek your forgiveness.

476
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:01,040
Xiao Quan Zi,

477
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:04,230
didn't you relay my message?

478
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,850
How would I dare not to?

479
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,020
I told him every word...

480
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,070
that you said.

481
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,420
Ignore him.

482
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:13,080
He's after all a servant
of Chengqian Palace.

483
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,240
If we let him kneel like that,

484
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:16,990
won't that embarrass the Empress?

485
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:18,630
She sent him to kneel here...

486
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:20,620
to make me feel uncomfortable.

487
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,280
Ignore him.

488
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,420
Xiao Quan Zi!

489
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,300
Her Highness has instructions?

490
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,840
Her Highness was very unhappy yesterday.

491
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,160
She wants you to go to Yangxin Hall
to relay a message.

492
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,760
-What message?
-Her Highness said that...

493
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,180
if she's still not served
meat in broth today,

494
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,980
she'll skip lunch.

495
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,790
Let His Majesty decide what to do.

496
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,250
I will get beheaded...

497
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:12,910
if I relay such a message!

498
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,510
It's of no use to keep it anyway.

499
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:16,310
Hurry! Her Highness is waiting.

500
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:19,410
Your Majesty,
you're here for Yuan Chun Wang?

501
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,720
He's just a servant.

502
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,050
I won't pay any attention to him.

503
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,910
You're now pregnant.

504
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,440
You'll bring
a new member to the royal family.

505
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,960
It is indeed joyous news.

506
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:34,110
Of course, I must personally come
to congratulate you.

507
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,640
Your Majesty came here to congratulate me,

508
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:43,740
but didn't bring any gifts.

509
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:47,380
You are much pettier than Consort Shu.

510
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,600
When Consort Shu came yesterday,

511
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,590
her gifts covered the whole table.

512
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,090
You're a smart person.

513
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:55,930
We don't have to beat around the bush.

514
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:58,150
I'll be straight with you.

515
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:03,350
Your Majesty, please tell.

516
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:07,710
Look the decoration in your chamber,

517
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:12,440
from small ones like Ru Yi scent jar
to big ones like red sandalwood furniture,

518
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,720
they are all His Majesty's favourites.

519
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:18,220
It shows how much
His Majesty cares about you.

520
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:24,750
What do you really want to say?

521
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,080
Even though he cares about you a lot,

522
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:30,500
you are only from a regular family.

523
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:32,760
Let me remind you,

524
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,280
that I'm the Empress of Great Qing.

525
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:37,020
No matter how favoured you are,

526
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,220
no one can replace me.

527
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:42,980
Your Majesty,

528
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:47,550
do you know what task I asked
Xiao Quan Zi to do earlier?

529
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,200
I had him deliver...

530
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,330
goat's milk and yam soup from yesterday...

531
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:54,680
to Yangxin Hall...

532
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,780
in exchange for a meat in broth.

533
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:00,230
I can't believe you did that.

534
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:01,640
Yes.

535
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,530
I dare to do so....

536
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,680
and I'm allowed to do such thing.

537
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:08,590
This is the advantage
of being a favoured consort.

538
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:11,240
But if I become the Empress,

539
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:15,620
I have to do everything
according to rules and behave myself.

540
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,870
I can't stand that.

541
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:21,950
You're telling me that
you don't have a wild ambition?

542
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:25,340
If Your Majesty doesn't provoke me,

543
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,640
I naturally won't have the desire for it.

544
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:33,020
Even if you give birth to a prince,
you won't make plans for him?

545
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,830
Who do you think His Majesty is?

546
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:39,140
Will he allow us to meddle with
the decision of the throne's successor?

547
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:41,720
Let me be frank with you.

548
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:44,810
I have never been afraid of conflicts.

549
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,490
The more I fight,
the more energetic I become.

550
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:48,800
If you want to continue,

551
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,660
I'll accompany you until the end.

552
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:53,090
But you won't be able to topple me,

553
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:55,400
nor will I be able to defeat you.

554
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,930
Going back and forth,
it'll be all for nothing.

555
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,770
Your Majesty humbled yourself today...

556
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:04,630
just to ask for a reconciliation.

557
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,060
Why bother testing me?

558
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,520
Let me put it this way.

559
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:12,699
Instead of hurting each other,

560
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:17,090
why not just take a step back
and focus on ourselves?

561
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,989
You're quite straightforward.

562
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,590
But, I have one condition.

563
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:30,929
What condition?

564
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:34,290
Your Highness must promise me...

565
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:36,610
that no matter when...

566
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:38,469
or for what reason,

567
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:41,080
you mustn't hurt the children.

568
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:44,850
Yours or others?

569
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:47,590
All the children in the Forbidden City.

570
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:56,070
I have no interest in hurting children.

571
00:34:56,409 --> 00:34:59,000
I am not a small person like that.

572
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:00,910
Good!

573
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:03,860
As long as Your Majesty
can keep your word,

574
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,740
I guarantee you that nothing will happen
in the Forbidden City...

575
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,470
and the palace will be at peace.

576
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,250
We...

577
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:15,460
have a deal then.

578
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:18,080
It's a deal.

579
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,660
Yuan Chun Wang,

580
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:36,570
I didn't save you
when you committed a mistake.

581
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,590
Do you hate me?

582
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:43,690
Your Majesty,

583
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,660
after I made such a huge mistake,

584
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,830
you still spared my life.

585
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,850
That's already being
excessively magnanimous.

586
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:56,470
Do you find me heartless...

587
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,800
for punishing you to kneel here?

588
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,080
Your Majesty,

589
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,190
I'm a servant of Chengqian Palace.

590
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:08,550
If Your Majesty
didn't punish me harshly...

591
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,990
when I make a mistake,

592
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:13,570
what would others say?

593
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:16,030
Hence, I know...

594
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:17,590
that my kneeling...

595
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,650
is not for Consort Ling,

596
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:23,610
but for everyone
in the Forbidden City to see.

597
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,370
Go back.

598
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:34,670
Mistress.

599
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:37,300
Consort Ling...

600
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:41,430
From today onwards,

601
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:44,830
the Forbidden City
will be at peace for a long time.

602
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:10,320
[30th Year of Qianlong]

603
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:31,090
Fifth Prince shot 30 times,
he didn't miss at all!

604
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:34,130
Great!

605
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,060
Fourth Brother, Father told us...

606
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,890
not to take it out on the tools.

607
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:49,580
[Twelfth Prince, Yong Ji]

608
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:50,040
Why can't you remember this?

609
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:52,550
Twelfth Brother,

610
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:55,120
who gave you the right to lecture me?

611
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,610
How disrespectful.

612
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:02,680
I heard Fourth Brother
went hunting a few days ago...

613
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,350
and injured his arm.

614
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:06,560
I think it hasn't recovered yet.

615
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,720
[Fifth Prince, Yong Qi]

616
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,000
Don't be so hard on yourself.

617
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,200
It's more important for you to recover.

618
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:15,660
If I have recovered from my injury,

619
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,270
I'd definitely defeat you.

620
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:30,670
Fourth Prince,

621
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,130
the former supervisor Gui Cheng
drew the bow before His Majesty.

622
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:36,600
He broke the bow accidentally
due to carelessness...

623
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,040
and he was punished by
forfeiting his salary for six months.

624
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,220
Do you know why?

625
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,000
His Majesty learnt literature
when he was four years old.

626
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,510
At nine years old, he learnt martial arts,

627
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:53,170
archery and shooting skills.

628
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:56,920
At age eleven, he tried shooting
at the mountain resort...

629
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,310
and didn't miss once.

630
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,860
At age twelve,

631
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,190
he went to the imperial hunt
with the late Emperor Kangxi.

632
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,790
The late Emperor Kangxi...

633
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,440
shot a black bear and
happily went to retrieve it.

634
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,200
The black bear suddenly attacked.

635
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,500
If His Majesty
hadn't shot the bear in time,

636
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,960
the consequences would've been disastrous.

637
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,400
When His Majesty attends
the imperial hunting every year,

638
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,630
he would personally assess
the princes, lords, ministers,

639
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:20,360
civil and military officials.

640
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,920
It's because he wants
everybody to remember...

641
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,980
that Great Qing was established
on the backs of horses.

642
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:29,070
Gui Cheng was ill in bed for six months
and could not shoot an arrow,

643
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:30,320
but he was punished anyway.

644
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,980
Even if you are injured,
you must not slack off either.

645
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:35,900
His Majesty won't hear any excuses.

646
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,520
Thank you, Lord Fu Heng for your advice.

647
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,870
I will remember it.

648
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:46,280
Fifth Prince.

649
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:49,610
I want to ask you about...

650
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:52,640
the musket improvement
you talked about last time.

651
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,570
The Green Standard Army's
shotguns are mostly weak.

652
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:57,560
We usually train on flat ground.

653
00:39:57,990 --> 00:39:59,210
Before striking in a battle,

654
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:01,270
the bullet drops before even firing.

655
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,530
Yong Qi is adept at
literary and martial arts.

656
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:18,030
Not to mention his mastery of astronomy,
geography and calendar.

657
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,550
Father already said that...

658
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,810
Yong Qi is his most outstanding son.

659
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:26,920
Why are you still here
wasting your strength?

660
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:30,370
Mother said that practice makes perfect.

661
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,710
Even if our skills
are not as good as others,

662
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,240
we must still catch up.

663
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,090
Father won't despise those who work hard.

664
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:03,740
Take it out.

665
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:11,520
Your Majesty...

666
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,830
Why are you hiding it?

667
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:17,120
Afraid that I will be unhappy?

668
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:19,470
Your Majesty.

669
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:20,750
I...

670
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,320
I'm in charge of the imperial harem.

671
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:26,610
I have to worry about all matters.

672
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,260
I certainly will age faster than others.

673
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,080
No wonder.

674
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:36,680
No wonder what?

675
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,680
That year, I asked Consort Ling...

676
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,680
No, it's Noble Consort Ling now,

677
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:42,620
that if she wanted to become the Empress.

678
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:43,830
She said she couldn't...

679
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:46,030
as she wanted to have a worry-free life.

680
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:48,960
Look at her. For the past ten years,

681
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,800
she's been able to eat
whatever she likes...

682
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,800
and play whenever she likes.

683
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,530
I took a close look at her the other day,

684
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:58,740
her hair is still glossy...

685
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,240
without a trace of gray hair.

686
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,430
But look at me.

687
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:07,590
My eyes are bloodshot.

688
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,850
Her eyes are still clear and bright.

689
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,730
She's over 30 years old
and still lives like a child.

690
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:17,930
That's because she is selfish.

691
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,720
Empress Dowager
wasn't fond of her years ago,

692
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:21,960
so she shamelessly...

693
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,360
sent Seventh Princess to Shoukang Palace.

694
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:28,240
Empress Dowager couldn't be cold
to her anymore thereafter.

695
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:29,490
Not only that,

696
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:33,280
six years ago, when Concubine Qing
was promoted to Consort Qing,

697
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,080
Noble Consort Ling even sent
Fifteenth Prince to her...

698
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,080
to form ties with her.

699
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:39,090
I really don't understand.

700
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,160
Didn't she say that...

701
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,660
women never know...

702
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:45,940
how to be nice to themselves?

703
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,820
In my opinion,
she loves nobody in this world...

704
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,080
but herself,

705
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:54,220
as if she's a precious treasure.

706
00:42:55,290 --> 00:42:56,900
Everybody knows that.

707
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,610
She has her prince and princesses,

708
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:02,180
taken care of by wet nurses.

709
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:04,750
Even though they were
sent to others to be raised,

710
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:06,930
it was only just to make it sound good.

711
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:10,550
Don't you see that...

712
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:14,190
Seventh Princess, Ninth Princess
and Fifteenth Prince...

713
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:16,520
all run to Yanxi Palace
when they are free.

714
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:19,920
As their birth mother,
she is naturally playful,

715
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:23,180
running around with the kids all day long.

716
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:26,720
Yanxi Palace has literally
become a playground.

717
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,200
Such a good Fifteenth Prince
has been badly influenced by her.

718
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,990
Unlike our Twelfth Prince...

719
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:35,760
who's diligent in his studies
and his martial arts training.

720
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,360
Even the teachers praise him
for his hard work.

721
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,810
But compared to Yong Qi,

722
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:44,850
his is still lacking in talent.

723
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:51,430
Your Majesty.

724
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,180
Greetings, Mother.

725
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:58,870
Your Majesty,
Twelfth Prince injured his hand...

726
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:00,280
during training today.

727
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,110
What's wrong?

728
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:05,600
Let me take a look.

729
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,740
Why were you so careless?

730
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,170
Your Majesty,

731
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,180
Twelfth Prince
trained under the scorching sun...

732
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:16,030
for four hours...

733
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,320
and bruised his hand.

734
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,200
I asked an imperial physician
to bandage the wound.

735
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,430
The imperial physician said that...

736
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:23,810
he shall not draw the bow for a month.

737
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:26,400
Silly boy.

738
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:28,830
Why were you being so hard on yourself?
