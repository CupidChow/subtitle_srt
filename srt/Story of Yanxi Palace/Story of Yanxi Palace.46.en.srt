[Story of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 46]

3
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,740
Xiao Quan Zi,

4
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,030
Her Highness has summoned you.

5
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,280
You once said...

6
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,820
that you're willing to do anything for me.

7
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,040
Your words still ring in my ears.

8
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,670
Have you forgotten what you said?

9
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:41,920
Your Highness,

10
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,840
what can I do for you?

11
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,040
You'll know...

12
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,750
after some time.

13
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,160
[Three months later]

14
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,520
Empress Dowager.

15
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,560
Over the past three months,

16
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,620
the donations from every palace
have been collected.

17
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,040
And many mistresses and noblewomen
have donated a large sum...

18
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,660
upon hearing the news.

19
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,690
The palace market is
open here for one day.

20
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,260
The participants are all ministers
and palace personnel.

21
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,320
When the preparation
at the Shenwu Gate is finished,

22
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,120
the palace market
will be relocated there...

23
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,400
and open to the public and merchants.

24
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,800
By then,

25
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,920
all money collected will be donated.

26
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,290
Come.

27
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,880
Empress Dowager, Noble Consort Chun
has made the plan long before.

28
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,040
It can be implemented
after being approved by His Majesty.

29
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,320
The market will be open
at the Shenwu Gate...

30
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,800
on every fourth, fourteenth,
and twenty-fourth day.

31
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,980
All kinds of goods
can be traded there freely.

32
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,360
Old goods from
the Imperial Household Department...

33
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,590
can be sold there...

34
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,020
instead of being transported elsewhere.

35
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,550
The proceeds can be used as allowance
or be donated entirely.

36
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,120
Empress Dowager, when you're free,

37
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,470
you can stroll around the palace market...

38
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:57,200
as a means of inspecting
the business landscape.

39
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,280
Yet,

40
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,920
I made the arrangement...

41
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,080
based on the cases from
the previous dynasty.

42
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,260
If Empress Dowager thinks there's a fault,

43
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,440
I will rectify right away.

44
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,960
Sure...

45
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,840
I like your ideas. They're great.

46
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,000
Thank you for all the hard work.

47
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,040
It's my pleasure.

48
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,399
Empress Dowager,
let's go and check out there.

49
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,440
There are the copper ware from
Xuande Emperor's era...

50
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,370
and the new-made porcelain enamel
by Imperial Household Department.

51
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,040
Concubine Ling, how does it feel...

52
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,980
to act as a liquor saleswoman?

53
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,600
At least it's better than
staying in the room alone...

54
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,560
and saying ironic remarks.

55
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,659
You're just being favoured
for the time being.

56
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:40,030
Don't be high-headed.

57
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,600
Being favoured for a short time
is good enough for me.

58
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,159
That means I haven't lived in vain.

59
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:48,290
It's way better than
those who have never been favoured.

60
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,960
-You...
-Ming Yu, that cup looks nice.

61
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,159
Yes.

62
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,600
Wei Ying Luo,

63
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,690
you won't be favoured for long.

64
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,280
-Yes...
-Empress Dowager.

65
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,880
The enamel stall is up ahead.

66
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,600
I heard many Western things
have been transported here.

67
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,120
They're very rare.

68
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,140
Good.

69
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,750
Empress Dowager,

70
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,250
didn't you lose these items?

71
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,290
How can that be?

72
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:17,590
Look.

73
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,830
This jade ring.

74
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,400
This jade ruyi.

75
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,350
And that flower pot.

76
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,390
They're all from the Shoukang Palace.

77
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,030
They disappeared all of a sudden.

78
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,520
We looked all over the Forbidden City.

79
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,280
But they're nowhere to be found.

80
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,920
Now they're here in the palace market.

81
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,080
Mistress,

82
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,720
isn't that the embroidered pouch you lost?

83
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,520
Her Majesty, your jade bracelet and
emerald bead earrings are here too.

84
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,570
This palace market is
in fact the den of a thief.

85
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,520
The items lost in our palaces...

86
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,670
are being sold at this market.

87
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,480
The proceeds are supposed...

88
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,740
to be used as allowance.

89
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,050
What a clever scheme.

90
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,400
Empress Dowager,

91
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,720
someone must have
found out about the market...

92
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,040
and mixed in these jewels on purpose...

93
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,950
They took this opportunity
to sell them off.

94
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,810
But I really didn't know about it.

95
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,840
Empress Dowager,

96
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,440
opening the market inside
and outside the palace...

97
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,920
is a hard work.

98
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,280
Her Highness couldn't oversee everything.

99
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,770
It's inevitable that...

100
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,240
some took this opportunity
to sell stolen goods.

101
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,590
You put it too simply.

102
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,260
The eunuchs steal now and then.

103
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,120
There are many people
involved in this dirty business.

104
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,480
Some are responsible for delivery.
Some for getting over the walls,

105
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,040
some for avoiding detection,

106
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,920
and some for dividing the proceeds.

107
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,510
There are so many links in the process.

108
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,030
Who knows?

109
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:43,320
Maybe Noble Consort Chun
has received some benefits...

110
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,520
and joined one of the links?

111
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,240
Empress Dowager,

112
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,880
I wasn't aware of it.

113
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:56,409
I don't know who did all this.

114
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,860
I'll get to the bottom of this.

115
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,540
Empress Dowager, please forgive me.

116
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,470
I'm getting tired.

117
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,140
I'll go first.

118
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,600
Mistress.

119
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,610
Noble Consort Chun,

120
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,080
you're so careless.

121
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:27,400
These stolen goods have damaged
this meaningful palace market.

122
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,900
Empress Dowager doesn't blame you
because she's lenient.

123
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,630
But when this gets out,

124
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,020
it'll tarnish your reputation for sure.

125
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,640
I hope you get to the bottom of this...

126
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,260
and find out the truth.

127
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,600
Yes.

128
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,040
This. These two.

129
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,540
And this.

130
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,960
They're all from our palace.

131
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,440
And that plate.

132
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,880
-I'm not as rich as others.
-Your Highness.

133
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,630
I'm extremely poor.

134
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,600
I'm taking all these valuables back.

135
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,120
Your Highness,

136
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,520
Did my words...

137
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,240
offend you?

138
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,010
Wei Ying Luo,

139
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,590
you're such a schemer.

140
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,480
Your Highness, what are you talking about?

141
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,120
I'm just taking back my stuff.

142
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,809
Why are you so mad?

143
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:36,850
Can it be that...

144
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,919
what they said is true?

145
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,820
Did you shelter the eunuchs
who stole these things?

146
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:44,330
No...

147
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,440
You're a talented woman from Suzhou.

148
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,750
Money is so filthy.

149
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,720
Of course you wouldn't
get involved in this matter.

150
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,420
Others don't believe you.

151
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,100
But I do.

152
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,020
Okay.

153
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,570
Okay.

154
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,430
Take all of your stuff back!

155
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,920
Don't miss anything out!

156
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,320
Thank you, Your Highness.

157
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,940
Take them all.

158
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,130
Your Highness,

159
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,660
Fifth Prince is sick.

160
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,680
I failed to be there at once.

161
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,670
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

162
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,860
Have you heard?

163
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,470
Yes, I have.

164
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,720
It's very obvious...

165
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,970
that someone framed you on purpose...

166
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,820
by planting the stolen goods
in the palace market.

167
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,410
Now that Empress Dowager
has gotten into a bad mood,

168
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:58,520
your effort has all gone down the drain.

169
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,220
I prepared all this...

170
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,540
to court Empress Dowager.

171
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,080
In this case,

172
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,560
I'd be lucky not to get punished,

173
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,520
not to mention taking credit.

174
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,410
Everyone is saying that...

175
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,890
the eunuchs secretly...

176
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:17,220
sold their stolen goods
at the palace market I organised.

177
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,440
It's possible that I was involved
in this dirty business.

178
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,470
My good reputation...

179
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,080
is all ruined at once!

180
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,330
Your Highness,

181
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,620
don't worry.

182
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,030
Empress Dowager and
His Majesty still believe in you.

183
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,850
It's just that they're
trying to save face.

184
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,620
When all this is over,

185
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,200
everything will be fine.

186
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,820
Wei Ying Luo...

187
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,110
has always been bad-mannered.

188
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,160
Having stayed at the Yuanming Garden
for two years,

189
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,420
she's started playing sinister tricks.

190
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,510
You should've seen that smug look of hers.

191
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,950
I was so furious that my heart ached.

192
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,640
Calm down, Sister.

193
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,030
I'll get back at her...

194
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:19,230
for you sooner or later.

195
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,230
Xiao Quan Zi, you did a great job.

196
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,160
I know very well
where stolen goods are sold...

197
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:33,430
after they sneak them out of the palace.

198
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,690
At first I was curious as to...

199
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:38,420
what Her Highness bought those items for.

200
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,920
It's impressive that she dealt
a blow to Noble Consort Chun...

201
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,560
by planting them on the palace market.

202
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,900
Alright...

203
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,760
You managed to make up
for your offense.

204
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,820
From now on, you must be an honest man.

205
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,170
Don't ever steal again.

206
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,220
I'll never do that again...

207
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,300
You may leave now.

208
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,310
Yes.

209
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,440
Stop right there.

210
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,390
Your Highness.

211
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,440
Here's your reward.

212
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

213
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,350
From now on, I'll do anything...

214
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,880
It's the same thing again.

215
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,920
You're not tired of saying it.

216
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,710
But I'm tired of hearing it.

217
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,310
Don't worry.

218
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,690
Even if you forget it,

219
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,100
I'll keep it in mind.

220
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,620
Yes.

221
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,430
I'm taking my leave.

222
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,390
Ying Luo.

223
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,960
This noon,

224
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,960
Noble Consort Chun's face...

225
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,880
turned pale at the sight
of those stolen goods.

226
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,490
She couldn't even deny it when
Empress Dowager was questioning her.

227
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,360
Serve her right.

228
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,760
It's just a small trick.

229
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,420
Those rumours flying around
the Forbidden City...

230
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,780
were not spread by

231
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,920
the young Concubine Jia alone.

232
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,240
She also added fuel to the fire.

233
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,370
I want her to know...

234
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,740
how it feels...

235
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,810
to be talked about by everyone.

236
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,840
By the way,

237
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,000
the late empress' death anniversary
is in three days .

238
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,790
I'll prepare cakes and fresh flowers.

239
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,950
However...

240
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,090
Why are you swallowing your words?

241
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,940
On that day,

242
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,440
surely Lord Fu Heng will pay his respects
at the Changchun Palace.

243
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,870
We should go later...

244
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,470
so as to avoid him.

245
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,840
[Knowing and Cultivation]

246
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,650
Young Master, what are you looking for?

247
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,220
Where's my perfume pouch?

248
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,600
It's here. You're carrying it with you...

249
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,520
but dropped it accidentally
when changing clothes.

250
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,070
I saw it's dirty so I cleaned it.

251
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,090
Don't ever touch my things!

252
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,780
Okay, you may leave now.

253
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,240
An!

254
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,380
An!

255
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,540
-Little Young Master!
-Come out now. Don't scare me!

256
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,800
-An!
-Little Young Master!

257
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,200
-An'er.
-Young Mistress, don't worry.

258
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,360
I'll look for him there.

259
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,920
-Go now. We must find him.
-Okay.

260
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,550
-Okay!
-An.

261
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,170
-Little Young Master!
-An!

262
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,840
Little Young Master!

263
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,630
An, come out now!

264
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,090
An is missing?

265
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,560
I was upset today and scolded him.

266
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:08,110
He then went into hiding.

267
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,880
I'm begging you. Please help me find him.

268
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,830
We must find him!

269
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,990
Okay. I'll help you find him for sure.

270
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,490
Butler.

271
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,280
Butler!

272
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:44,700
Young Master, what can I do for you?

273
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,500
Why is Little Young Master here?

274
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,480
Little Young Master,
let's go play outside, okay?

275
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,080
-Let's go now.
-No.

276
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,300
Hurry.

277
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,030
Tell the wet nurse...

278
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,790
to come and fetch him.

279
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,470
Yes.

280
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,600
An!

281
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,750
What are you doing?

282
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,520
What do you think I was doing?

283
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,690
I'm different from you.

284
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,680
I don't hurt innocent people.

285
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,220
And I don't engage in
stupid acts of malicious revenge.

286
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,700
Hitara Er Qing,

287
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,579
Since you're now a mother,

288
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,940
you must see to that responsibility.

289
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,420
Don't leave the child wondering around.

290
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,450
An is found.

291
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,080
Young Mistress, Young Master has
a great family and a good character.

292
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,960
Now he has made military achievements
and holds high position.

293
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,970
Many are envious of you.

294
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,790
Even if there were many misunderstandings,

295
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,400
for the sake of Little Young Master,
you should resolve them...

296
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,650
and lead a harmonious life
with Young Master.

297
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:02,520
Judging from how Young Master
treated Little Young Master,

298
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,190
you still have a chance.

299
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,510
You must give it a thought.

300
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:11,510
Many try to send their sister or daughter
here to be Young Master's concubine.

301
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:15,580
If you refuse to budge,
you'll be replaced by others.

302
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,480
Who is it?

303
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,180
Why are you here?

304
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,460
Because I've thought it through.

305
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,950
I used to hate you so much.

306
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,920
That's because you're infatuated
with Wei Ying Luo...

307
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,760
and never held me in your heart.

308
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,920
Now she's become Concubine Ling...

309
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,320
And it's impossible
for you to be together.

310
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,790
Even if you're so infatuated,
you will come back to me, right?

311
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,020
Now,

312
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,740
if I refused to give in,

313
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,850
you'd go into some other woman's arms.

314
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,590
That'd make me the biggest fool of all.

315
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,620
I have no idea what you're thinking.

316
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,630
Fu Heng...

317
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,170
I was wrong.

318
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,600
I was wrong.

319
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,960
It's all my fault.

320
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,430
I didn't get it before this.

321
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,210
Over the past three years,

322
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,890
you'd been on the battlefield.

323
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,510
Even though I complained about you,

324
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,520
I missed you and waited for you all along.

325
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,360
I longed for your return all the time.

326
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,440
Even though I knew that
you hated me so much,

327
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,910
I still missed you.

328
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:57,030
What exactly are you trying to do?

329
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,240
You once broke my heart.

330
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,750
And I took my revenge on you.

331
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,070
Fu Heng.

332
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:09,000
Now I want to reconcile with you.

333
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,220
I want to lead a good life with you.

334
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,570
I promise you.

335
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:15,790
I'll never throw tantrums again.

336
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,360
I promise you.

337
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,450
I'll be a good daughter-in-law...

338
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,230
and a good wife.

339
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,870
I can manage the household
and take care of Father and Mother.

340
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,480
I'll stop socialising with others.

341
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,080
I'll stop sending messages
to my grandfather.

342
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,700
I'm willing to do as you say.

343
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:36,520
I'm begging you.

344
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,190
Please forgive me, okay?

345
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,390
Aren't you...

346
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,920
Aren't you nice to An?

347
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,760
I can...

348
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,050
I can bear for you a son of our own.

349
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,310
Okay?

350
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,070
Hitara Er Qing.

351
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,800
Things don't always go your way.

352
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,370
When you're angry,

353
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,760
you want everyone to suffer.

354
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,320
When you're regret,

355
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,050
you want to make up with great ease.

356
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,800
I'm telling you.

357
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,880
Ever since you made the wrong step,

358
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,120
you're no longer my wife.

359
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,740
Fu Heng...

360
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,170
Fu Heng.

361
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,680
No.

362
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,480
No.

363
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,600
I will make you forgive me.

364
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,690
I will make you forgive me!

365
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,920
They're saying that
we're having an affair.

366
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,960
You're an esteemed official
with military merits.

367
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,990
Of course His Majesty
won't make life difficult for you.

368
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,790
But he's venting his anger on me.

369
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,040
Therefore,

370
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,530
please stay away from me.

371
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:15,120
Do you still remember that snowy day?

372
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,440
You and Er Qing stood together...

373
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,450
like a match made in heaven.

374
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:21,840
From then on,

375
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,810
I swore to myself that...

376
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,120
I would broke ties with you...

377
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,600
and become a stranger to you.

378
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,750
Young Master, it's getting windy.

379
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,440
Take care.

380
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:46,230
Qing Lian.

381
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,800
Do you think I'm wrong?

382
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,920
Three years have passed.

383
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:57,930
She's become Her Majesty's woman.

384
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,210
But I still hold her in my heart.

385
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,600
Young Master,

386
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,410
you're a man living in the past.

387
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,040
Living in the past?

388
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,750
I've never met Her Highness.

389
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,100
But she's risen through several ranks
within half a year.

390
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:18,640
It shows that she's a astute person.

391
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,120
Someone like her...

392
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,020
is usually smart.

393
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,720
She knows that
the past cannot be changed...

394
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,670
so she always look ahead.

395
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,750
You're right.

396
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,280
Ying Luo always looks ahead.

397
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,240
Smart people like her are often heartless.

398
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,640
Because all the beautiful things
in the past...

399
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,400
will be abandoned by them.

400
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,740
Not only their memories...

401
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,280
but also those they used to know.

402
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,730
That means...

403
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,120
she abandoned me?

404
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,690
No.

405
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,480
You hold onto a past dream,

406
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,360
unwilling to wake up.

407
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,780
Ever since I started serving you,

408
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,970
I've found out that
you cherish old things.

409
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,360
You carefully keep small things,

410
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,280
such as an ink-stone, a military book,

411
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,890
and a piece of old garment.

412
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,080
It's okay if you just cherish old things.

413
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,480
But you're being too hard on yourself...

414
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,870
to the point of being harsh.

415
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,550
Qing Lian,

416
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,440
are you scolding me?

417
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,640
I dare not.

418
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,560
I heard that during the marching,

419
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,480
you travelled on horseback
for long distance.

420
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,480
In order to discuss military affairs
and arrange for reports,

421
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,160
you often stayed up all night.

422
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:45,280
Even His Majesty sent the decrees
to take away your seal by force...

423
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,360
after the hour of the Dog.

424
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,800
Young Master, you're so strict
with work and yourself,

425
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:52,770
not to mention love.

426
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,250
I'm not as good as you said.

427
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,010
No, even if everyone says you're not good,

428
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:00,310
in my heart,

429
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,730
you're the best young master in the world.

430
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:09,280
Tomorrow is my sister's death anniversary.

431
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,010
Please prepare for it.

432
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,810
Yes.

433
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,950
Young Master,

434
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,350
it's getting late.

435
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,360
Go to bed early.

436
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:45,190
You may leave now.

437
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,200
I want to stay with my sister for a while.

438
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,050
Sister.

439
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,640
Things are just as you predicted.

440
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,310
You can't even carry the meat well!

441
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,240
Lord Fu Heng's clothes are all wet!

442
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,640
I deserve to die.

443
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,000
Please forgive me, Lord Fu Heng.

444
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,640
Lord Fu Heng is going to the Yangxin Hall.

445
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,500
It'd be a discourtesy
to meet His Majesty like this!

446
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,640
Lord Fu Heng,

447
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,540
he knows nothing because
he's new to the palace.

448
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,280
It's all your fault! I'll punish you!

449
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,270
It's okay.

450
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,360
He's just a teenager.

451
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,150
There's no need to fuss over it.

452
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,310
But Lord Fu Heng,

453
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,520
you can't meet His Majesty like this.

454
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,240
Let me clean it for you.

455
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:20,420
Okay?

456
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,640
I need to go to the Yangxin Hall now.

457
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,080
You can change out of your clothes.

458
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,870
I'll wash only the soiled part...

459
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:28,240
and iron it with a metal iron.

460
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,680
It'll be done in no time.

461
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:38,860
You're so clumsy...

462
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,750
that you spilt the late empress' offering!

463
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,160
I'll deal with you later!

464
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,830
Sister Fei Cui, let me iron it...

465
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,100
to make up for my mistake.

466
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,000
I'm glad you know your mistake.
Come now!

467
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,920
Yes.

468
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,610
Lord Fu Heng, your clothes are ready.

469
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,720
Put them down.

470
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,840
Lord Fu Heng, do you need my help?

471
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,400
No, just leave them there.

472
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,720
If you don't want
a palace maid to serve you,

473
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,480
please allow that little eunuch
to make up for his fault.

474
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,760
Xiao Lu Zi,

475
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,480
Bring the clothes in for the lord.

476
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,560
Yes.

477
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,410
You spilt the late empress' offering.

478
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,130
It's a big crime deserving death penalty.

479
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:42,240
Don't tell anyone about it.

480
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,700
When working in the palace,
you must be extra cautious.

481
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,710
Yes.

482
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,280
If something goes wrong,

483
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,870
no one will regard you as a child.

484
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:52,710
Yes. Thank you, Lord Fu Feng.

485
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,100
Wait.

486
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,620
You're still here.

487
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,210
I should go to the Yangxin Hall now.

488
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,920
I'm taking my leave.

489
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,500
Wait.

490
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,680
Ming Yu.

491
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,710
Guard the door.

492
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,590
Ying Luo.

493
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,890
Go.

494
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,800
Do it quickly...

495
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,450
to avoid trouble.

496
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,880
Why haven't you left the capital?

497
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:45,660
Ever since I came back,
I've been thinking about it.

498
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:52,230
I think you have an ulterior motive
for entering the palace.

499
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,320
What do you think...

500
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,910
I entered the palace for?

501
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:04,840
Fu Heng,

502
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,970
stop imagining things.

503
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,400
I got tired...

504
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,300
staying at the Yuanming Garden.

505
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,730
I didn't want to be...

506
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,670
a lowly palace maid.

507
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,680
And I didn't want to be...

508
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,650
a servant forever.

509
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,620
There are two possibilities.

510
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,800
First, it's because
my sister's death is suspicious.

511
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,880
The late empress died by suicide.

512
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,000
It has nothing to do with others.

513
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,980
If it's not the reason,

514
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,500
then it's because you hate me.

515
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,150
What do you mean?

516
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,320
Ying Luo,

517
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,700
you've always been hating me.

518
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,920
I have not.

519
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,940
I promised that I'd marry you.

520
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,500
But I married Hitara Er Qing instead.

521
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:00,450
Given your temperament,

522
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,020
you'll never ever forgive me.

523
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,100
You think too highly of yourself.

524
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,350
It's all in the past.

525
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,870
I've forgotten it long ago.

526
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,920
If you lash out at me and scold me,

527
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,810
everything will be solved.

528
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,560
But you don't.

529
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,080
Ying Luo,

530
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,670
I know you very well.

531
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,280
You'll never forgive
anyone who betrays you.

532
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,670
No,

533
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,870
I'm not blaming you.

534
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,600
I brought it upon myself.

535
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,360
I'm willing to bear the consequence.

536
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,730
Fu Heng,

537
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,760
you don't belong in the Forbidden City.

538
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,000
This place is full of traps...

539
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,130
and schemes.

540
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,170
You belong on the battlefield.

541
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,200
You can gain merits, build your career,

542
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,530
and achieve your lifelong ambitions.

543
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,690
Go.

544
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:13,720
Go now.

545
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,410
But I'm worried about you.

546
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,720
If I stay,

547
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,760
I can at least see you.

548
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,590
When you're in danger,
I can do something for you.

549
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,040
-Fu Heng.
-Ying Luo.

550
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,070
No matter what you're trying to do,

551
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,640
I have to tell you that...

552
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,440
my sister really wanted you to be happy.

553
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,740
She hoped you could be free...

554
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,630
and lead a happy life.

555
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,440
That's her only wish.

556
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,210
Sacrifice for no one...

557
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,740
but yourself.

558
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,310
You must live a happy life.

559
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,820
If you have any difficulties,

560
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,200
just let me know.

561
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,920
I'll help you.

562
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,280
Don't shoulder everything
on your shoulders.

563
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,630
You're a human,

564
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,390
not a god.

565
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,000
Your Majesty, look.

566
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,600
What did I say?

567
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,180
They're indeed having their tryst here.

568
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,720
Greetings, Your Majesty.

569
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,920
Greetings, Your Majesty.

570
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,160
Your Majesty, look at them.

571
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:32,120
They've always been so close
since their days at Changchun Palace.

572
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,000
Concubine Ling has become your consort.

573
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,800
But they haven't given up on each other.

574
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,600
They've gotten together again.

575
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,640
Concubine Jia,
please stop talking nonsense.

576
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,630
Today is the late empress'
death anniversary.

577
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:44,800
Concubine Ling used to serve her.

578
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,320
They ran into each other.

579
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,260
There's no such thing
as coincidence in this world.

580
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,090
You got it all planned out.

581
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:57,280
Your Majesty, today is the
late empress' death anniversary.

582
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,090
And they chose to have their tryst here.

583
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,490
It's shameless and rebellious!

584
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:04,540
Tryst?

585
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:09,040
Did you see us embracing and kissing?

586
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,040
We're just talking.

587
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:14,159
How can it be a tryst?

588
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,780
There are dozens of eunuchs
and maids in the Changchun Palace.

589
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,090
Are they all dead?

590
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,130
Both of you knew that
His Majesty is soft-hearted enough...

591
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,800
to believe your nonsense.

592
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,739
That's why you chose to
have your tryst here.

593
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,650
Your Majesty, they've been
having an affair.

594
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:41,780
We've caught them red-handed
but they're still trying to deny it.

595
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,570
You can't believe her.

596
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,370
Other than it being a coincidence,

597
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,320
do you have anything else to say?

598
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,760
Nothing.

599
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,760
Wei Ying Luo.

600
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:53,980
Your Majesty,

601
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,639
today is my sister's death anniversary.

602
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,040
I came to pay my respects.

603
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,760
I was delayed due to some accident.

604
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,800
That's how I ran into Concubine Ling.

605
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,650
We talked for a while.
And it's all related to the late empress.

606
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:04,870
I didn't ask you.

607
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,900
I'm asking her!

608
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,270
Your Majesty.

609
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:13,460
I've said what I had to say.

610
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,660
If Your Majesty insists on
not believing me,

611
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,680
I can't do anything about it.

612
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:28,710
What is this?

613
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,680
It's a hairpin.

614
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,270
This hairpin

615
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,440
looks so familiar.

616
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,120
Your Highness, did you forget?

617
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,240
This is Concubine Ling's
favourite hairpin.

618
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,520
There's a very unique
gardenia pattern on it.

619
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,600
You said it's not a tryst.

620
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,240
But you even have the love token.

621
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,790
Now we've found the evidence...

622
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,920
and caught this pair of adulterers.

623
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,400
Wei Ying Luo.

624
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,090
Is this your answer?

625
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,290
Your Majesty,

626
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,500
Her Highness lost this hairpin.

627
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,480
Someone is trying to frame her.

628
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,700
It's a trap.

629
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,320
Where is that eunuch?

630
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,400
Fei Cui, take him here at once.

631
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,440
Yes.

632
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:30,850
Your Majesty,

633
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,600
that eunuch carried the offering...

634
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,660
and ran into me.

635
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,240
I took off the clothes for cleaning

636
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,720
That's how he got his opportunity.

637
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,880
Lord Fu Heng, you're so quick-witted.

638
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,720
If someone were to frame you,

639
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:45,590
he would've to steal this hairpin
from Concubine Ling.

640
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:49,010
But who would go through such trouble...

641
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,870
to frame you two?

642
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,400
I...

643
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:55,800
I've never seen any hairpin.

644
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,210
I don't know.

645
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,190
You...

646
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,680
Concubine Jia.

647
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,720
You're so bad at acting.

648
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,760
I can't bring myself to watch it.

649
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,400
What do you mean?

650
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:17,130
Bring him in.

651
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,520
Tell the truth.

652
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:29,760
If you don't,

653
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,400
you will have to...

654
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,760
suffer severe punishment.

655
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,050
Your Majesty,

656
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,160
it's Concubine Jia.

657
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:42,040
She's the mastermind of all this.

658
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,040
She ordered me to steal
Concubine Ling's hairpin.

659
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,210
I made this mistake...

660
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,920
because I was greedy.

661
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,240
Please have mercy on me, Your Majesty!

662
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,640
Please spare my life, Concubine Ling!

663
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,950
Nonsense! You're slandering me!

664
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,280
Your Majesty,

665
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,400
don't believe what this eunuch said.

666
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,460
You must believe me, Your Majesty!

667
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,860
If you don't fess up,

668
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,560
I'll send you to Noble Consort Chun...

669
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:15,880
and let her know how you planted
the stolen goods and framed her.

670
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,270
I'm sure she'll be glad...

671
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,080
to catch you the culprit.

672
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,360
Your Majesty,

673
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,740
I did as you said.

674
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,360
You can't sell me out!

675
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,550
You're paid as a servant in Yanxi Palace.

676
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:34,200
But you side with the Chuxiu Palace.

677
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,000
You're such an ingrate.

678
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:38,040
I'm not going to shelter you.

679
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:38,990
Your Majesty.

680
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,960
You're using a series of stratagems?

681
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,850
Think it through.

682
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:46,920
Your Majesty,

683
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,360
I can swear to God.

684
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:51,310
It's all Concubine Jia's doing.

685
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,750
She instructed me to steal...

686
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:54,770
and pretend to be greedy...

687
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,640
so as to get away with it.

688
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,720
I committed many grave crimes.

689
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,520
But Her Highness kept forgiving me.

690
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,580
That's why I'm telling the truth.

691
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,000
Your Majesty, it's all
Concubine Jia's doing!

692
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,010
Your Majesty,

693
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:09,120
this eunuch is from the Yanxi Palace.

694
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,360
Of course he'll defend
Concubine Ling, Your Majesty!

695
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,040
Concubine Jia,
I put the gold you gifted me...

696
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,750
under my bed.

697
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,500
I received it from your senior maid, Lan.

698
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:21,720
Your Majesty, if you don't believe me,
you can interrogate Lan.

699
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,050
She'll fess up for sure!

700
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,600
Your Majesty!

701
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,390
Your Majesty!

702
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,670
Your Majesty!

703
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,840
I didn't do it.

704
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,200
I really didn't do it!

705
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,370
From today onwards,

706
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,010
Concubine Jia is to be confined
in the Chuxiu Palace.

707
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,200
She is not allowed to leave
without my order.

708
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,360
No, Your Majesty!

709
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,460
Your Majesty!

710
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,560
I was wrong!

711
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:52,000
I was wrong, Your Majesty!

712
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,350
Your Majesty!

713
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,440
Your Majesty!

714
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,860
Wei Ying Luo.

715
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,200
How dare you frame me!

716
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,160
Was it you who framed me...

717
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,650
or the other way around?

718
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,100
You wretch!

719
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,920
When did you find out about it?

720
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,130
If it's about stealing palace treasures,

721
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,250
why this handkerchief?

722
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,330
I guessed...

723
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:47,110
it'd be made into
a counterfeit love token.

724
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,720
Thus,

725
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,130
I kept Xiao Quan Zi by my side...

726
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,860
to lure you into a trap.

727
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,370
In fact,

728
00:40:58,310 --> 00:40:59,580
I should thank you.

729
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:04,200
Xiao Quan Zi is very thorough.

730
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:09,320
You've gifted me a good servant indeed.

731
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,490
You think you won?

732
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,520
I'm telling you.

733
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,160
His Majesty is loathing me.

734
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,090
But he doesn't forgive you either.

735
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:30,010
You're indeed having a tryst.
His Majesty will never see you again.

736
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,170
Wei Ying Luo.

737
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:34,060
It's game over for me.

738
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,600
But you're no better.

739
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,340
Supervisor Li,

740
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:41,050
Concubine Ling was
framed by Concubine Jia.

741
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,480
Why is His Majesty still angry?

742
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,090
They're indeed framed.

743
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,240
But Lord Fu Heng...

744
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,920
used to beg to marry Wei Ying Luo.

745
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:53,240
But it's all in the past.

746
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,230
Moreover,

747
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:58,120
His Majesty already knew about it
before he married Concubine Ling.

748
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,750
Are you stupid?

749
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,000
Knowing is one thing.

750
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,880
But having seen them being together...

751
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,510
is a different story.

752
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,120
You see, His Majesty...

753
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:09,800
changes his dragon robes all the time,

754
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,910
let alone women.

755
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,910
You mean...

756
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:19,030
His Majesty has given up on
Concubine Ling?

757
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,600
You're really something.

758
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,000
You're now able to
read His Majesty's mind.

759
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,980
You're promising.

760
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,200
What are you waiting for?

761
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,410
I can't see my face! Wipe it for me!

762
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,570
Who boiled the water?

763
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,200
It's not hot at all.

764
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,870
Servants!

765
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,920
I'm sorry, Sister Ming Yu.

766
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,640
I didn't hear you because
I was doing laundry in the backyard.

767
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,360
You're supposed
to serve in the inner hall.

768
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,950
Why are you doing laundry?

769
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,130
Sister Ming Yu, everyone's busy.

770
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,190
Busy?

771
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,360
There's no one
in the inner hall, tea room,

772
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,430
side rooms, and courtyard!

773
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,900
What are they busy with?

774
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,290
Sister Ming Yu.

775
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,050
They were...

776
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:18,160
assigned by
the Imperial Household Department...

777
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,290
to mend the roof of Zhongcui Palace,

778
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,080
to clean the inner courtyard
of Chengqian Palace,

779
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,600
and to clean the Imperial Garden.

780
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,480
Imperial Household Department
has so many servants.

781
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,840
Why did they assign our servants
to do those things?

782
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:34,720
Sister.

783
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,510
Don't you get it?

784
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,680
His Majesty is giving
Concubine Ling the cold shoulder.

785
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,520
Everyone is seeking a way out.
