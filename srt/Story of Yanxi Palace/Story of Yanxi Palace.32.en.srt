[Story of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 32]

3
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,940
Your Majesty, you're wrong this time.

4
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,680
I believe...

5
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:59,229
that Empress Dowager
will surely love this gift.

6
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,950
Why is Consort Xian here?

7
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:11,940
I heard that you prepared
a birthday gift for Empress Dowager.

8
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,260
Hence, I accompanied
His Majesty to come see it.

9
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,880
You won't mind, right?

10
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,860
If I say I do, will you leave?

11
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,700
Since you won't, why bother saying that?

12
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,340
Noble Consort, you have
been straightforward for many years.

13
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,860
You are still the same.

14
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:31,650
Your Majesty, please watch it for today.

15
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,980
If they performed well, I'll order
to increase the troupe into 12 members...

16
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,420
during the birthday banquet
of Empress Dowager.

17
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,320
By then, it surely will be a grand sight.

18
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,460
Zhi Lan, instruct them to start.

19
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:46,610
Yes.

20
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:31,040
The blazing fire lights up
the earth and sky.

21
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,180
Red sparks flying in all directions,
evaporating into purple smoke.

22
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,560
Young men's faces are flushed
in the moonlit night,

23
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,890
and a song reverberates in the cold river.

24
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,600
Thinking about it carefully,

25
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,930
the scene Li Bai's poem was describing...

26
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,540
must exactly be this one.

27
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,680
Qiupu...

28
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,870
is a famous copper mining area.

29
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,920
When Li Bai passed by this place,

30
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,650
he saw melted copper being poured...

31
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,040
with sparks shooting everywhere.

32
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,660
It was indeed a picture of smelting
in the middle of an autumn night.

33
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,050
But this magical Fire Flowers scenery

34
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,350
is much better than the smelting fire.

35
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,390
Supervisor Li,

36
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,200
this wonderful night view is beautiful.

37
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,640
Noble Consort Gao is really outstanding.

38
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,250
Concubines who
can stand firm in the harem...

39
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,510
are all not to be belittled.

40
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:22,670
You should just focus
and slowly learn from them.

41
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,420
Your Majesty,

42
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,220
I plan to build
a performance stage here...

43
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,320
and personally arrange the dances.

44
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,490
Let the beautiful dancers...

45
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,130
perform in a sky full of flowers.

46
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:43,260
[Empress Dowager will surely
be happy to see it.]

47
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:48,610
Noble Consort, you are ingenious.

48
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:53,100
If Fire Flowers can indeed be
performed during the birthday banquet,

49
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,440
it surely will stunt the world.

50
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,380
By then,

51
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,790
the stage will be built here.

52
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,250
Your Highness, isn't it too close?

53
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:19,890
What are you afraid of?

54
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,400
You won't be dancing.

55
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,890
It will be built here.

56
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,410
Yes.

57
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,730
-Quickly make the arrangements.
-Yes.

58
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,360
Noble Consort!

59
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,920
-Your Highness!
-Your Majesty, be careful!

60
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,300
Protect the Emperor!

61
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,400
Protect the Emperor!

62
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:54,810
Stop now!

63
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,100
Are you okay, Your Highness?

64
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:01,650
-Call for an imperial physician!
-It's him! Arrest him!

65
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,750
Call for an imperial physician!

66
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,160
Hurry!

67
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,760
Stop! All of you, stop!

68
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:14,670
Your Highness!

69
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:19,570
Consort Xian. Call the imperial physician!

70
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,010
Your Highness...

71
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,960
How do you feel, Your Highness?

72
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,490
Your Highness!

73
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,130
Your Highness!

74
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,940
Your Highness!

75
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:42,620
Wait!

76
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,159
Imperial Guard Solon,

77
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,550
what happened?

78
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,600
Open it.

79
00:06:56,909 --> 00:06:59,159
-This is a manure cart.
-I said, open it!

80
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,090
Check it!

81
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:18,560
Let's go!

82
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,420
Check it!

83
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,909
What's going on?

84
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,270
What are you doing?

85
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,530
Imperial Guard Solon?

86
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,460
It's you?

87
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,690
What are you doing?

88
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,230
There's an assassin in the palace.

89
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,630
We're trying to find him.

90
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,640
Would an assassin
scrub commodes in the palace?

91
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,450
Imperial Guard Solon,
are you doing this deliberately?

92
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,270
I'm sorry.

93
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,670
This is part of my duty.

94
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,070
How did your search go?

95
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,840
Nothing.

96
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:20,860
Nothing.

97
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,450
Miss Ying Luo,

98
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,090
sorry for disturbing you.

99
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,100
Let's go!

100
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,580
Replying to Your Majesty,
I fear that Her Highness...

101
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,920
How is she?

102
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:51,190
Physician Zhang, the situation
has come to this. Stop concealing it.

103
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,850
Your Majesty, Her Highness
was severely injured.

104
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:56,980
I want to apply medicine on her,
but she won't let me do so.

105
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,950
My back...

106
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,180
feels like it's on fire.

107
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,480
It's so painful, Zhi Lan.

108
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,920
-It's so painful.
-Your Highness, you must not touch it!

109
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,290
Ye Tian Shi!

110
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:16,920
Your Majesty, for grave burn injuries,
cold medication should be applied soon.

111
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,130
But Noble Consort Gao
kept asking if it will leave a scar.

112
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,250
If it will leave a scar,
she refused to let me treat her.

113
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,430
Nonsense.

114
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,260
Your Majesty.

115
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,490
I'll personally watch here.

116
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:32,570
-Ye Tian Shi, apply medication on her.
-Yes.

117
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:33,890
-Yes.
-No, Your Majesty.

118
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:36,800
-I don't want a scar.
-Hold her!

119
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,660
-Your Majesty.
-I don't want medication, Your Majesty!

120
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,360
Do you want her to die?
Her life is more important than anything.

121
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,560
Do it now.

122
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,020
-Yes.
-Zhi Lan, save me.

123
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,990
I don't want to have scars.

124
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:48,880
-Your Majesty, it mustn't leave any scars.
-Your Highness.

125
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,730
the scar can be slowly treated.

126
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,520
You have burn injuries.

127
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,530
If we don't immediately cure it,
your life might be in danger.

128
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,830
-Ye Tian Shi, do it quickly.
-Yes.

129
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,890
-No!
-Your Highness, please endure it.

130
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,990
-I can't have scars.
-Your Highness!

131
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,130
Your Highness!

132
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:11,730
No, Your Majesty...

133
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:15,520
Oh, no!

134
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:16,960
What is it?

135
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,390
This smell is not right.

136
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,830
I fear that this isn't melted iron,

137
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,090
but golden fluid.

138
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,140
Ying Luo,

139
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:30,800
be honest with me.

140
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,540
Have you decided from the start...

141
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:37,180
to defend that blacksmith
who tried to assassinate Noble Consort?

142
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,630
I'm not related with those people.

143
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:44,620
I understand.

144
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,760
You deliberately pretended...

145
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,150
to be indifferent and heartless...

146
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:54,400
because you're afraid that it might
implicate the Empress, am I right?

147
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:57,340
You deliberately went
to Chuxiu Palace to deliver milk.

148
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,790
You intentionally incited a conflict
between you and Noble Consort Gao.

149
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,280
This way, if someone investigates,
you can say...

150
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,310
you've done it because
of a personal grudge.

151
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:04,500
Am I right?

152
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,700
Just to clear any suspicion
to Changchun Palace,

153
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,770
you worked yourself to death.

154
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:10,950
Shut up!

155
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:15,600
None of your business.

156
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:18,220
You helped the assassin like this...

157
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:21,020
not only to seek vengeance
for the Empress.

158
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,940
You...

159
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:27,000
You want to seek justice for those
innocent blacksmiths that died, right?

160
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,040
I...

161
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,890
Ying Luo.

162
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,440
Ying Luo!

163
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:33,820
Ying Luo!

164
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,230
Your Highness,

165
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,130
why did you throw yourself towards it?

166
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,930
If your face got destroyed,

167
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,170
you're the one who will suffer.

168
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,490
The target of that melted iron
was Noble Consort Gao.

169
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,220
The distance and timing was just right.

170
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:54,260
It's obvious that he didn't want
to harm any innocent people.

171
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,000
Enough.

172
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,440
Stop crying.

173
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,520
I'm fine now, right?

174
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,360
Greetings, Your Majesty.

175
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:12,710
-Greetings, Your Majesty.
-No need for formalities.

176
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,440
- How is your wound?
-The imperial physician has been here.

177
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,550
Just minor burns. Nothing grave.

178
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:22,120
But, I don't know about Noble Consort...

179
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:24,790
Sit down.

180
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,410
Noble Consort Gao is gravely injured.

181
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,360
Also,

182
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:41,160
the perpetrator was sinister.

183
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,960
He mixed golden fluid in the melted iron.

184
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:47,580
What is that?

185
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,810
Golden fluid is...

186
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,530
manure water.

187
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,770
When two parties fight in war,

188
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,500
they sometimes use boiling water
to force the enemy to withdraw.

189
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,360
If you mix some manure water in it,

190
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,030
the wounds of the enemies...

191
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,960
would get gravely infected
and hard to heal.

192
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,600
Luckily you didn't get hurt.

193
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,060
Or else, the consequences
are hard to imagine.

194
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,570
Let me see your wound.

195
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:14,560
I'm afraid that it might scare you.

196
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,800
Let me see.

197
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:29,180
You both got burn wounds.

198
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,260
She was shouting as if
she wanted the whole world to hear it,

199
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:37,110
while you're not complaining at all.

200
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,840
Is it really not painful?

201
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,840
It is.

202
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,570
I'm also made of blood and flesh.
How could it not be painful?

203
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,790
But whenever I remember
that you didn't get hurt,

204
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:50,680
I feel comforted.

205
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,680
No matter how painful it is,

206
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,440
I won't pay attention to it.

207
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:13,530
Shu Shen.

208
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,860
Your Majesty,

209
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,540
it has been so long
since you called me by my name

210
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,710
I...

211
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,280
have always neglected you.

212
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,880
But during the most dangerous moment,

213
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,150
you were the first one
to come out to protect me.

214
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:41,220
But you clearly know...

215
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,880
that I'm capable enough to protect myself.

216
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:47,220
I don't need you to sacrifice yourself...

217
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,680
or your life.

218
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:54,850
Yes,

219
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:58,220
I know that you have
the ability to protect yourself.

220
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:00,370
But during that situation,

221
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,170
I didn't have time to think more.

222
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,710
I will listen to you from now on...

223
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:08,670
and protect myself first.

224
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,840
I won't let you worry.

225
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:34,930
Get lost!

226
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,820
-Your Highness!
-Useless thing...

227
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,990
-I'm incompetent! Please calm down!
-Your Highness.

228
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,240
You said to use salted water
to sterilise the wound...

229
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,420
and puncture the blisters.

230
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,560
I agreed to all of them.

231
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,620
How come they are still not scabbing?

232
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,060
How come there's no sign
of improvement at all?

233
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:57,010
Your Highness,
your wounds weren't that serious.

234
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,370
You just need to recuperate for six months
and it will completely heal.

235
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:00,410
But...

236
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,530
they mixed golden fluid
inside the molten iron.

237
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:03,850
The golden fluid is dirty,

238
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:06,160
causing the wound
to repeatedly get infected.

239
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,960
I did my best!

240
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,840
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness, you mustn't...

241
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,590
-get mad!
-I don't want you to do your best.

242
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:14,370
You mustn't get mad!

243
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,620
Leave!

244
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,970
Your Highness, you mustn't get mad!

245
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,960
-Your Highness, you must calm down!
-You mustn't get mad!

246
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,990
Your Highness!

247
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,190
Your Highness!

248
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,170
Physician Ye, take a look at her!

249
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:25,900
Physician Ye,

250
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,560
hurry and save Her Highness!

251
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:31,620
Her wounds were ruptured and
yellow fluid would frequently seep out.

252
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,470
Her pulse is weak.
She has a fever and is coughing.

253
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,620
Well, I can't treat her anymore.

254
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:39,910
Physician Ye, you can't go!

255
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,550
You're a divine physician.
You can revive dead people.

256
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,240
How can you not cure her?

257
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:47,320
The wound of Her Highness kept worsening.

258
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:50,070
I've already removed the necrotic tissues
and blisters three times.

259
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:53,150
It wasn't easy for me
to keep her alive, but Her Highness...

260
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,640
Her Highness doesn't know to cherish it.

261
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,660
This...

262
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,200
Now, she is anxious, affecting her heart.
Her wound has worsened.

263
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,770
Even if Hua Tuo is still alive,
she can't be saved.

264
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,760
I don't believe you! Her Highness...

265
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,760
Her Highness is clearly doing fine.

266
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,920
Let me be honest with you.

267
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,160
After 10 days to a month,

268
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:14,380
her whole body will be bruised
and she'll die.

269
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:19,780
Physician Ye!

270
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,760
Your Highness!

271
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,170
Keep an eye on Her Highness.

272
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,550
I'll be right back.

273
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,930
Did you hear the words
of the imperial physician?

274
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,130
The Noble Consort won't live long.

275
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,480
What will happen to us?

276
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,400
I came to visit Noble Consort.

277
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,890
Leave us alone.

278
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,560
Didn't you hear me?

279
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,600
Yes.

280
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,290
Water...

281
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,090
Why are you here?

282
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:51,030
Why are you so surprised?

283
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:54,310
Noble Consort, don't you want to see me?

284
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,460
Zhi Lan.

285
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,950
Zhi Lan!

286
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:00,890
Where is Zhi Lan?

287
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:03,260
Where did she go?

288
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,390
Noble Consort, your wounds wouldn't heal.

289
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:08,260
You should restrain your temper
and recuperate in peace.

290
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,300
How could you be this impatient?

291
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:14,590
Hoifa-Nara Shu Shen.

292
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,950
Don't you worry.

293
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,720
I surely will get well.

294
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,490
I won't let you laugh at me.

295
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:22,910
Recover?

296
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,090
Of course.

297
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:29,040
Do you know how
your back wounds look like right now?

298
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:32,270
But it's understandable too.

299
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:35,290
Who would dare tell you the truth?

300
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,580
What do you mean?

301
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,210
You have outstanding beauty
that surpasses all others.

302
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:46,040
Just losing a strand of hair would
make you feel upset all day.

303
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:49,550
Now, do you know that your back is...

304
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:52,440
a patch of red full of necrotic flesh?

305
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,830
Even if it completely heals in the future,

306
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:57,510
it will leave behind a huge black scar.

307
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,260
Your Highness,

308
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,650
you must know...

309
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:04,180
that it was boiling molten iron.

310
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,360
Gao Ning Xin, look at yourself.

311
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,770
Does Noble Consort Gao who was
the most beautiful woman in the palace...

312
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:26,170
still has any of her past demeanor left?

313
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,930
Why are you glaring at me like that?

314
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,970
Haven't you always looked
with disdain on the imperial harem...

315
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,650
because of your beauty?

316
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,270
It will be different from now on.

317
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:40,000
You can't bring that scar with you
in attending to His Majesty.

318
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:43,200
You can only rely on the graces
of the Gao family to live.

319
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:45,650
Rely on His Majesty to live.

320
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,790
You even have to endure the whole
Forbidden City despising...

321
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,810
and mocking you.

322
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,780
It was you!

323
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:58,170
Accurately speaking, it wasn't just me.

324
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:02,410
There are so many people who hate you.

325
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:06,110
Someone wanted to use
the Fire Flowers to burn you,

326
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:08,830
to destroy your skin
and to give you a huge blow.

327
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:11,240
But this person was too kind.

328
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,730
She actually didn't target
your beautiful face...

329
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,540
nor took your life away.

330
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,970
Of course, I must help her out.

331
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:26,080
That's right.
No matter how beautiful a flower is,

332
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,840
it needs manure as fertiliser.

333
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:30,290
Hence, I added some manure water...

334
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,100
in the molten iron...

335
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,690
to nourish...

336
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,740
a world renowned beautiful peony like you.

337
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,570
Wicked lady.

338
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:46,270
I'm going to kill you!

339
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,240
Gao Ning Xin, how did you treat me before?

340
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,720
Do you still remember?

341
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,690
[Your jewellery?]

342
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,190
[When did you have any jewellery?]

343
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:05,290
[Those were all bestowed
to you by His Majesty.]

344
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:09,180
[I didn't touch
any of the bestowed gifts.]

345
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,280
[All these were prepared by my family...]

346
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,270
[before I married into the prince manor.]

347
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:15,270
[None of them belong to the palace.]

348
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,830
[Currently, I need money.]

349
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:18,630
[What's wrong with selling...]

350
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:20,580
[my own items?]

351
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:26,050
[I beg Noble Consort Gao to be merciful.]

352
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,800
[Do it.]

353
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,900
[No...]

354
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,190
I can ignore how you
trampled on my dignity.

355
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,020
But you dare use Prince Yi
and my father's bribery act...

356
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,930
to destroy my family.

357
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:51,170
From that moment on,

358
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,850
I've been waiting.

359
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:55,630
Waiting to ask you to pay for your debts.

360
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:59,700
When that secret complaint letter
was sent to my palace,

361
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,230
I then knew that my chance has come.

362
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,250
Aren't you afraid I'll tell His Majesty?

363
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,600
Noble Consort...

364
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:13,790
I'm a meritorious subject
that saved His Majesty.

365
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:15,700
If you don't say anything,

366
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,580
His Majesty might still
harbour some pity for you.

367
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:20,250
If you slander me,

368
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,720
His Majesty will surely despise you.

369
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,390
If you don't believe me, give it a try.

370
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,610
But...

371
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,680
do you still have time?

372
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:38,830
Consort Xian...

373
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:44,070
You are indeed good.

374
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:49,150
Gao Ning Xin,

375
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,970
I'll just wait and watch...

376
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,440
this peony fall into the mud.

377
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,830
You mustn't disappoint me.

378
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:28,550
Your Highness!

379
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:30,970
Your Highness.

380
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:35,480
Those lowly servants,
I just left for a short while.

381
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:36,960
Your Highness.

382
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,130
When I was in power,

383
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:44,210
they were so diligent in serving me.

384
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,080
Now...

385
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:51,050
when I'm unable to rise again,

386
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:57,270
they disperse one by one.

387
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,360
Didn't you see that Nalan Chun Xue?

388
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,750
She didn't even visit me.

389
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,300
Your Highness,

390
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,980
what's important now is
that you should focus on recuperating.

391
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,180
Once you're well, we'll deal with them.

392
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,810
Where's Ye Tian Shi?

393
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:21,160
He said...

394
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,120
that I'm incurable.

395
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,660
Am I right?

396
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,670
Your Highness,

397
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,470
don't despair.

398
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,600
Without Ye Tian Shi,

399
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:37,940
there's still Physician Zhang
and the whole Imperial Medical Academy.

400
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:39,830
Your Highness, don't worry.

401
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:56,260
Consort Xian was right on one thing.

402
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,830
Even if I recover,

403
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:06,040
I will have scars.

404
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:11,340
Whenever His Majesty sees me,

405
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,220
he will remember me...

406
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,370
as a woman full of scars.

407
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:24,290
Your Highness, don't worry.

408
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,540
Those wounds will heal for sure.

409
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:28,040
They will.

410
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:31,720
I'd rather get hated by everyone,

411
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:36,720
than be disliked by one person.

412
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,340
Zhi Lan,

413
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,930
I want to...

414
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:49,950
take a bath and change my clothes.

415
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,290
Your Highness,

416
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,550
you won't be able to take it.

417
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,650
Don't force yourself too much.

418
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:11,320
I have a more important thing to do.

419
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,210
Even if you want to seek revenge,

420
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:16,210
you should recuperate your health.

421
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:18,940
No need to rush.

422
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:22,110
Previously,

423
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:25,210
I kept thinking...

424
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:29,270
about how I will tear Consort Xian...

425
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,060
into pieces.

426
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:36,390
But I know...

427
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,240
it's too late to do so.

428
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,230
I shouldn't waste my time on her.

429
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,860
Zhi Lan.

430
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,200
Go...

431
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:56,520
invite His Majesty over.

432
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:02,260
-Your Majesty!
-What's going on?

433
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:05,330
-Please see Noble Consort one last time!
-Why are you all standing? Drag her away!

434
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:06,410
Your Majesty!

435
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,010
Your Majesty!

436
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,440
What do you mean by one last time?

437
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,710
Isn't Noble Consort
recuperating in Chuxiu Palace?

438
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:19,300
Replying to Your Majesty,
Ye Tian Shi said...

439
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,200
that Her Highness
might not live past tonight.

440
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:23,810
She...

441
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:36,300
You're not focusing on recuperating.

442
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:37,830
What are you up to now?

443
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,420
Your Majesty.

444
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:06,300
I need to make good use of my time.

445
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,800
I know that I don't have much time left.

446
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,610
I want to dance for you one last time.

447
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,750
One day, when I'm gone,

448
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:21,330
I hope that Your Majesty
can still remember how I look like today.

449
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:24,170
You must never forget it.

450
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:26,090
When I say that you can recover,

451
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,660
you can recover for sure.

452
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:33,210
Maybe, in my heart,

453
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:35,140
I was never awake.

454
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,270
Your Majesty,

455
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,330
just let me...

456
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,940
be willful this one last time.

457
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:29,580
Stop, Ning Xin.

458
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:32,470
Stop!

459
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,900
Stop now!

460
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,350
Your Majesty...

461
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:50,990
You're so good.

462
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:54,750
Why aren't you in love with me?

463
00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:00,900
Was it because I'm rude and arrogant,

464
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,880
slow-witted and ignorant?

465
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,870
No...

466
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:08,570
I know that you're not foolish at all.

467
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,920
Just to make me feel at ease,

468
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,530
you kept pretending...

469
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:17,150
to be foolish and unruly.

470
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,270
I know...

471
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,510
that because father is
in an important position,

472
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:26,660
and a member of Ortai's alliance,

473
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:29,880
Your Majesty isn't at ease with him.

474
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,270
You are not at ease with me too.

475
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,580
Your love...

476
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,450
has always been so far...

477
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,550
and guarded.

478
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:45,330
Even your gaze was always so cold,

479
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,460
so full of disgust.

480
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:50,210
If...

481
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,230
I didn't pretend to be a fool,

482
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:56,450
you will detest me more.

483
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:58,240
Am I right?

484
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,670
Ning Xin.

485
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,310
I never disliked you.

486
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,600
I...

487
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:10,530
In the eyes of the Gao family,

488
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,830
I'm just a pawn in the palace.

489
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:16,520
In your eyes,

490
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:20,300
I'm just a tool of the Gao family
to curry your favour.

491
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,190
As time goes by,

492
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,320
I don't even know...

493
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:30,060
who I am.

494
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:31,350
Ning Xin.

495
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,860
just focus on recuperating.

496
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:39,440
Let's forget those unhappy things,

497
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:41,120
okay?

498
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,860
It's too late, Your Majesty.

499
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:48,270
I...

500
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:51,140
can't waste any more time.

501
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:53,230
As the saying goes,

502
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:57,770
when a person is about to die,
her words are kind.

503
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:04,150
I still have one last request...

504
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,300
to ask you.

505
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:09,159
Don't worry.

506
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:12,310
I surely will find the perpetrator.

507
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:14,699
No. Your Majesty,

508
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:19,580
these...

509
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:22,739
aren't important to me anymore.

510
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:25,270
What do you want then?

511
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,840
I know that Your Majesty,

512
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,400
being the Emperor,

513
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:46,300
can't casually interfere with
the family matters of your subjects.

514
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:50,370
Hence, I never asked you for this.

515
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:53,070
In the past,

516
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:55,870
I even imagined...

517
00:34:56,650 --> 00:35:00,790
that if one day, I became the Empress,

518
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:04,800
I can give her a posthumous name
in an open and upright manner,

519
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,090
allowing her
to be buried in our family tomb.

520
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:10,050
forcing the Gao family...

521
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:14,830
to pay respect to her, bow to her
and repent for their mistakes.

522
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:17,970
But a dream...

523
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,190
is still just a dream.

524
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:26,380
Now, I can only be shameless

525
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:28,510
to earnestly ask you.

526
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:31,120
Your Majesty, please...

527
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:34,160
allow my mother
to be buried into our family tomb...

528
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:36,370
so her soul...

529
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:39,250
will not wander around,

530
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:42,800
not having a place to return to.

531
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,370
Okay.

532
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:05,780
I promise you.

533
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:15,390
Lord Gao,

534
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,820
Noble Consort doesn't want to see you.

535
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,960
There's no use even if you kneel here.

536
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,960
Young Lord Gao,
even if you keep kneeling here,

537
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:25,980
Her Highness...

538
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,620
will never change her mind.

539
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:31,290
Your Highness!

540
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,530
Are you really not going
to see Young Lord Gao?

541
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:35,980
Your Highness!

542
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,560
Zhi Lan.

543
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:53,370
Help me...

544
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:56,980
with my last performance.

545
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:11,070
♫ This pear tree ♫

546
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,800
♫ is the place that I, Yang Yu Huai ♫

547
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:26,540
♫ will end my life ♫

548
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:34,260
♫ I, Yang Yu Huai ♫

549
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:41,760
♫ bow and thank
the graces of His Majesty ♫

550
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:48,710
♫ From now on ♫

551
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:55,280
♫ we will never meet again ♫

552
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:04,500
Your Highness!

553
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:09,320
Ning Xin!

554
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:11,780
Your Highness.

555
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:27,040
Your Majesty,
Noble Consort Gao has passed away.

556
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,390
Spread my decree.

557
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:04,280
Noble Consort...

558
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,260
was born from a prominent family,

559
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:11,180
assisted in managing the imperial harem.

560
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,390
has a filial and respectful temperament,

561
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:16,990
gentle and simple.

562
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:20,990
I confer the title Imperial Noble Consort
to her posthumously.

563
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:27,210
The funeral of Noble Consort...

564
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:29,660
will be handled by...

565
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,920
the Ministry of Works, Ministry of Rites
and the Imperial Household Department.

566
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,110
Yes.

567
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,340
[Your love...]

568
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:08,600
[has always been so far and on guard.]

569
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:13,600
[Your gaze was always cold...]

570
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,720
[and full of disgust.]

571
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:20,860
[If I didn't pretend to be a fool,]

572
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,750
[Your Majesty will detest me more.]

573
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:28,640
Your Majesty.

574
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,570
Leave now.

575
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:33,180
Yes.

576
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:22,460
You.

577
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:24,060
Be at ease.

578
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:27,670
Although His Majesty decreed
to interrogate them strictly,

579
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:30,820
who among those blacksmiths will admit it?

580
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:35,820
Fire Flowers was especially prepared
for the birthday of Empress Dowager.

581
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:38,110
Hence, no blood must be spilled.

582
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:41,100
In the end,
it will just be left unsettled.

583
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,480
Those blacksmiths will also be released.

584
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,840
Are you at ease now?

585
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:46,350
I...

586
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,360
You worry about others all day.

587
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:57,350
Worry about yourself!

588
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,670
Focus on recuperating.

589
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,750
Here, eat these while they're hot.

590
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,600
Let me...

591
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:17,130
I might've owed you in our past lifetime.

592
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,030
Is it hot?

593
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,150
Thank you.

594
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:34,390
You're just going to thank me?

595
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,600
Wei Ying Luo, let me tell you.

596
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,560
I will ask for repayment...

597
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:41,850
on every spoonful of porridge
I gave you today.

598
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:44,220
Don't think you can easily brush me off.

599
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,530
You're already a supervisor.

600
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:50,890
You still need my payment?

601
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:53,690
Supervisor?

602
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:55,440
There are at least eight supervisors...

603
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,980
like me here in the Labour House.

604
00:42:58,290 --> 00:43:00,440
Do you think I will just stop here?

605
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,000
Brother,

606
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,850
you are really full of wild ambitions.

607
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,050
You only know now?

608
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:13,220
Wei Ying Luo,

609
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,120
what did you call me earlier?

610
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,840
What porridge is this?
Why is it a little...

611
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,390
Don't change the subject.

612
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,870
Say it.

613
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,560
What did you call me earlier?
