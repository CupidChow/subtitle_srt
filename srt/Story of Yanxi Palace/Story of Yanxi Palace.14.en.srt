1
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,240
Yingluo,

2
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,320
your elbow keeps trembling.

3
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,320
How could you write well?

4
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,840
Whenever I lift a brush,

5
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,000
my elbow involuntarily trembles.

6
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,520
Empress,

7
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,400
if I put my elbow on the table,

8
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,680
it feels…

9
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,200
No.

10
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,480
When you practice calligraphy, you must overcome the elbow problem.

11
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,040
If you can't do that,

12
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,620
how can you make progress?

13
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,240
Go on.

14
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,079
Yes.

15
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,000
Yingluo, what are you doing?

16
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,560
Help! Help!

17
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,360
Yingluo, what happened!

18
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,280
Why do you have to hang yourself?

19
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:49,410
Yingluo, what's wrong?

20
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,240
Yingluo, are you crazy?

21
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,960
Committing suicide in the Palace is a grave crime!

22
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,760
You may die, don't implicate us!

23
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,560
Will anyone hang themselves

24
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,120
with such a low loop?

25
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:04,820
Then...

26
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,010
then what are you doing?

27
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,360
Her Majesty is teaching me to write.

28
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,240
I must solve the trembling-elbow problem.

29
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,360
But my hand

30
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,760
trembles whenever it leaves the table.

31
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,820
I thought about it,

32
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:19,720
and got the idea

33
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,050
that I could fix my hand with a loop.

34
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,600
After I get used to it,

35
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:26,040
I can rid the loop and do it on my own.

36
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,680
Wow,

37
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,000
you started not long ago.

38
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:32,740
You've written so many pages!

39
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,240
Practice makes perfect.

40
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,920
I am dumb and start late.

41
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,680
So I have to come up with a trick.

42
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,720
Zhenzhu, you should see clearly next time.

43
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,560
You scared me.

44
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,840
Indeed.

45
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,600
My heart pumped out

46
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,000
when I heard your crying.

47
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,600
Indeed.

48
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,800
All done spectating?

49
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,240
You people aren't like her.

50
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,640
You don't have master’s favor to teach you write personally.

51
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,480
Go work.

52
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:07,800
Let's go.

53
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,440
Yingluo,

54
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,000
how many pages are here?

55
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,760
About 150 pages, I think.

56
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:13,800
Yingluo…

57
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,600
Zhenzhu, are you deaf?

58
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,050
Wei Yingluo,

59
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,840
you think you’re great because you can make master happy?

60
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,300
If you climb too high, you might fall and die!

61
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,440
Climb high and be mighty for a while.

62
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,040
That's better than being desperately unable to climb up.

63
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,760
You!

64
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,560
But you should hope that I can climb even higher

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,159
but never fall down,

66
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,720
or else the first one I squash

67
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,100
will be you, who's staring up from below.

68
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,360
Alright.

69
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,840
I know you're a sharp tongue. You win.

70
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,450
I'll just see how much longer your contentment can last!

71
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,400
I spray it so finely.

72
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,400
Mine is finer.

73
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,720
Right, sister?

74
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,400
Yingluo.

75
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,040
Look.

76
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,300
Yingluo, you're back.

77
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,040
Yingluo?

78
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,480
Yingluo?

79
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,300
What's wrong with her?

80
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,600
Erqing.

81
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,490
Master favors Wei Yingluo so much now.

82
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,200
She tried to find her twice in a minute.

83
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,560
I told you she's sophisticated and you wouldn't believe me.

84
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,760
Not only me,

85
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,360
you're about to lose your position!

86
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,360
Alright, Mingyu.

87
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,600
Mingyu.

88
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,960
Yingluo seems annoyed.

89
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,720
I found the secret of Yingning’s death.

90
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,840
Eleven o’clock tonight,

91
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,320
I'll wait for you at the Imperial Garden.

92
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,360
Deal.

93
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,860
What's wrong, Fuheng?

94
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,490
Prince Yi seems to be meeting Qingxi quite often lately.

95
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,480
Qingxi is hoping to be promoted.

96
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,240
What's strange about him making connections with Prince Yi?

97
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,640
It's not strange for Qingxi to want to go up.

98
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,720
What's strange is

99
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,170
why would Prince Yi lower himself?

100
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,640
Yingluo,

101
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,650
is anything bothering you?

102
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,720
No.

103
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,280
You say no.

104
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,000
Look at the character you wrote.

105
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,530
You omitted a brushstroke.

106
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,800
Your Majesty,

107
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,480
I…

108
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,400
If you're tired, then go back for a rest.

109
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,880
If you're not focused, you won't be able to write well.

110
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,960
I'm fine.

111
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,020
Then focus on writing.

112
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,000
Yes.

113
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,440
Your Majesty,

114
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,140
I have to attend to something.

115
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,170
I want to ask for a leave.

116
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,080
Leave?

117
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,330
Wei Yingluo.

118
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,000
Let go!

119
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,760
Help!

120
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,560
A thief!

121
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,080
Stop!

122
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,600
A thief!

123
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:57,930
Stop!

124
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,880
Help!

125
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,280
Beat him! Him!

126
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,120
Beat!

127
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,720
Stop it!

128
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,120
Him!

129
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:07,880
Stop it!

130
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,880
I'm a guard of the Gate of Celestial Purity!

131
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,640
What are you doing?

132
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,040
This is the inner palace!

133
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,640
Why is a guard of the Gate of Celestial Purity not doing his duty there

134
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,080
but instead come to the Imperial Garden?

135
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,280
This is a grave crime!

136
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,640
Beat him! Use all your strength!

137
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,200
Beat him!

138
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:22,880
Stop it!

139
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:23,880
Stop!

140
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,200
Go on!

141
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,320
Stop it!

142
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,120
Are you all blind?

143
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,640
I'm right here!

144
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,400
Rise.

145
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,160
What's going on here?

146
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,480
It's her, Wei Yingluo.

147
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,320
She secretly invited me to the Imperial Garden.

148
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,400
She wants to seduce me!

149
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,480
Seduce you?

150
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,720
You got mad

151
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,000
because I refused you.

152
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,400
Why don't you look in the mirror first? You think you're worthy of that?

153
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,160
You gathered people to beat me!

154
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,560
Prince,

155
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,200
I've already informed you

156
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,600
of her secretly asking me out.

157
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,920
Please be my witness.

158
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,600
And punish this shameless palace maid.

159
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,760
You all heard it?

160
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:05,960
Arrest her!

161
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,360
I'm a close maid of Her Majesty.

162
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,680
Without permission of Her Majesty,

163
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,880
I dare you to touch me!

164
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,540
You don’t repent on your fault at this point?

165
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,560
If you're not secretly meeting Qingxi,

166
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,960
why would you be here?

167
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,480
It’s midnight.

168
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,760
Don't tell me

169
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,880
you're here to view the scenery?

170
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,130
Give it to me!

171
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,800
See?

172
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,560
It's getting hotter now,

173
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,160
My master can't stand the smell of mozzie buster.

174
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,680
I was collecting tuberose,

175
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,480
and stumbled onto this playboy.

176
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,320
He deserved all the beating!

177
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,160
If this is a date,

178
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,160
why would I bring so many people?

179
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,400
Do I need spectators?

180
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,380
I don't want to hear your excuses.

181
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,080
Tell it to the Office of Punishment

182
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,560
if you have anything to say.

183
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,360
Take her away!

184
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
What are you doing here at midnight!

185
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,600
Fuca Fuheng,

186
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,880
you're not on duty today.

187
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,330
What are you doing here?

188
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,040
His Majesty just finished the military matters

189
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,880
and is spectating the moon in the Imperial Garden.

190
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,680
He invited me for a game of chess.

191
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,810
Do I need your permission for this?

192
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,560
I didn’t expect

193
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,240
we'd be disturbed

194
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,680
after so short tranquility.

195
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,370
His Majesty is here?

196
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,200
Here is the thing.

197
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,880
This servant maid was secretly meeting a guard.

198
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,160
I caught her in the act

199
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,400
and wanted to take her to the Office of Punishment.

200
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,730
I shall not disturb His Majesty with this.

201
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,520
Take her away.

202
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,440
Wait!

203
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,700
His Majesty is in the pavilion ahead.

204
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,600
If you have something to say,

205
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,440
say it to His Majesty.

206
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,760
I rarely have the mood for a game of chess

207
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,560
and you ruined it.

208
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,720
Is this the Imperial Garden or a food market?

209
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,920
Why were you yelling?

210
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,240
It’s you again?

211
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,080
Your Majesty,

212
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,240
I didn't want to ruin your mood.

213
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,880
Fuheng insisted taking us here.

214
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,400
He said you this needed your judgment.

215
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,920
I can handle this little thing myself.

216
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,620
His Majesty, if it's an inner palace matter,

217
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,720
it should be handled by Her Majesty.

218
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,050
But a guard of the Gate of Celestial Purity is involved in it.

219
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,520
Please judge this matter, Your Majesty.

220
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:31,960
Your Majesty.

221
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,920
I'm not deaf!

222
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,960
If you were able to handle it,

223
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,730
would you be here at all?

224
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,200
What was going on? Tell me.

225
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,600
Your Majesty,

226
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,400
this palace maid tried to seduce me.

227
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,600
I refused her several times,

228
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,800
but she kept doing it.

229
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,320
While I was on duty today,

230
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,960
she asked me to meet her in the Imperial Garden at eleven o’clock.

231
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,080
I knew

232
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,000
palace maids and guards couldn’t date.

233
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,560
I thus reported it to Prince Yi.

234
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,000
He was furious.

235
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,880
He said it shouldn't be handled lightly

236
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,400
because it mattered to morality in the Palace.

237
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,400
He instructed me to wait for her.

238
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,560
So we could catch Wei Yingluo

239
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,960
and reinforce morality.

240
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,800
She asked you out?

241
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,840
Your Majesty,

242
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,520
most guards in the Forbidden City

243
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,920
are of noble birth and have a bright future.

244
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,160
They easily catch attention

245
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,040
of some flirtatious women.

246
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,800
I've strictly forbidden my subordinates getting involved

247
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,240
and have reiterated it once and again.

248
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,640
The guards strictly abide by this rule.

249
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,650
Wei Yingluo is a maid of Palace of Eternal Spring.

250
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,520
Yet she knows no shame and treads on the rule over and over again.

251
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,980
Qingxi already refused her numerous times.

252
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,680
But she doesn't let him go.

253
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,280
I know

254
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,360
the guards can't leave their posts without permission.

255
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,760
But in order to stop this bad practice,

256
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,980
I felt obligated to take the risks

257
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,240
and set this trap to catch her.

258
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,960
A palace maid who breaks the rule shall be punished by the inner palace.

259
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,420
Since when has Prince Yi taken over this job?

260
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,480
If people learn about it,

261
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,520
we'll be a joke.

262
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,680
We are guards of the Gate of Celestial Purity

263
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,760
and are responsible for all security matters.

264
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,400
We shoulder inspection duties within the Forbidden Palace.

265
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,200
Your Majesty,

266
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,280
Qingxi is involved in it.

267
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,280
We can’t treat it casually.

268
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,840
You could transfer it to the Office of Punishment

269
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,000
to handle it.

270
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,080
Wei Yingluo is a close maid of Her Majesty.

271
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,820
If Her Highness wants to shelter her,

272
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,680
who would dare say anything?

273
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,680
Your Majesty,

274
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,960
I stated it clearly already,

275
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,600
I was picking tuberose to make a scented pouch for Her Majesty.

276
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,160
Her Majesty was thoughtful

277
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,000
and sent some eunuchs

278
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,760
to accompany me in the Imperial Garden.

279
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,080
If it was a date,

280
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,600
why would I bring this many people?

281
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,960
That's...because I refused you.

282
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,920
You wanted to meet with me in the Imperial Garden

283
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,360
and had people in ambush nearby.

284
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,490
You brutally beat me as if I was a thief.

285
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,740
You were clearly holding a grudge

286
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,200
because of the unrequited love.

287
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,240
Guard Qijia,

288
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,690
could you say anything else except nonsense!

289
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,820
Do you know how to spell "shameless"?

290
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,840
Enough.

291
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,500
Clearly no one wants to back down,

292
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,480
but I don't want to hear your arguments.

293
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,060
What’s your evidence?

294
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,930
Your Majesty, I have evidence.

295
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,840
Your Majesty,

296
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,440
this is a letter sent by Wei Yingluo.

297
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,140
Please take a look.

298
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,280
Read it yourself!

299
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,520
Take her away!

300
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,400
Your Majesty.

301
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,200
Your Majesty,

302
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,800
I didn't

303
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,860
write this letter.

304
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,320
I heard

305
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,760
you are learning calligraphy from Her Majesty.

306
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,680
But your writing is ridiculous.

307
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,260
Who are you trying to fool?

308
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,480
I also have evidence.

309
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,880
What is this?

310
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,040
Your Majesty,

311
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,050
Her Majesty is very kind

312
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,369
and teaches me calligraphy herself.

313
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,880
I'm dumb, though,

314
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,700
I know what I should do.

315
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,130
I dare not waste Her Majesty' efforts.

316
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,310
I have been

317
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,740
practicing intensively for a month.

318
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,200
I tried different practicing methods.

319
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,109
In order to check

320
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,520
if I've advanced,

321
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,040
I numbered

322
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,560
the sheets I've written.

323
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,280
But this afternoon,

324
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,400
I discovered that page 28 had disappeared.

325
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,800
These are page 27 and earlier calligraphy.

326
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,040
These are page 29 and later calligraphy.

327
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,820
Only page 28 has gone missing.

328
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,400
Someone must

329
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,920
have stolen my calligraphy

330
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,180
and wanted to frame me.

331
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,780
Why should we believe you?

332
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:54,960
Prince Yi,

333
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,660
please tell me,

334
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,760
what paper this letter is written on.

335
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,040
This is rice paper for practicing calligraphy.

336
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,840
Your Majesty,

337
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,610
I don’t have much income. I dare not waste rice paper.

338
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,520
I've been using snippets of toilet paper,

339
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,010
namely white cotton paper.

340
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,200
But this letter

341
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,200
is not.

342
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,120
Your Majesty,

343
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,490
the letter provided by Qingxi,

344
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:36,200
is written on a white, tightly-woven paper without much texture.

345
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,060
This paper is raw rice paper of Jing County in Anhui.

346
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,000
It’s of the highest quality.

347
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,810
But Miss Wei’s paper

348
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,120
is cotton paper

349
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,600
used for making toilet paper in the Palace.

350
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,640
If you don't believe me,

351
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,320
you can search the western side room of Palace of Eternal Spring.

352
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,640
See if you can find

353
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,800
any top-quality raw rice paper from Anhui.

354
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,730
Therefore, someone must have stolen my calligraphy

355
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,760
and tried to mimic my writing.

356
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,520
They meant to frame me

357
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,240
bit didn't notice the difference in paper quality.

358
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,240
Maybe you did it to avoid suspicion.

359
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,160
Are you sure no top-quality raw rice paper can be found

360
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,920
in the whole Palace of Eternal Spring?

361
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,250
I dare not speak boldly,

362
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,700
but according to Her Majesty,

363
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,560
these 150 pages

364
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,010
show my daily progress.

365
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,960
You were afraid that I may find it out,

366
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,640
so you didn't take the newest one.

367
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,240
You took one from the middle.

368
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,320
Page 28 was written

369
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,480
one month ago.

370
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,000
You can compare it to my recent writing

371
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,010
and you'll see the difference.

372
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,640
You bastard,

373
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,480
how dare you frame her!

374
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,040
Your Majesty, looks like Qingxi is lying.

375
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,280
It must be him! He… he wants to…

376
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:46,880
Prince Yi,

377
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,120
are you going to say

378
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,320
Qijia Qingxi had failed to seduce me

379
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,200
and therefore framed me?

380
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,440
Guard Qijia,

381
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,560
you hear it?

382
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,200
Prince Yi failed to frame me

383
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,920
and wants to throw you aside.

384
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,320
If you don't tell the truth now,

385
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,680
no one can save you later.

386
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,560
Your Majesty,

387
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,160
Prince Yi threatened me

388
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,860
into framing Wei Yingluo!

389
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,240
I don't know his motive.

390
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,010
But everything was instructed by him.

391
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,560
I can swear to the heaven!

392
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,200
Hongxiao,

393
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,920
as a distinguished prince,

394
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,300
you played a despicable trick like this?

395
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,960
Don't you have any shame?

396
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,040
Your Majesty, please calm down.

397
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,400
Please don’t believe

398
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,460
the nonsense of this dog-like thing.

399
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,850
He's just dragging me into the mire

400
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,320
because he failed to implicate Wei Yingluo.

401
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,160
Your Majesty,

402
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,320
when I learned that my calligraphy was missing,

403
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,560
I immediately reported it to Her Majesty.

404
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,880
With her permission,

405
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,690
I brought people to capture the person behind it.

406
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,040
But I never expected

407
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,290
that this matter could involve Prince Yi.

408
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,120
After all, I've been living in the inner palace.

409
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,720
I have never met Prince Yi.

410
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,040
How could I have offended him?

411
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,200
Prince Yi,

412
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,760
may I ask why you slandered me?

413
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,240
I told you Qingxi planned all these!

414
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,480
I got deceived by him.

415
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,560
Don't make unfounded accusations!

416
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,120
After thinking about it,

417
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,090
I believe I’m not the only target of Prince Yi.

418
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,400
Perhaps

419
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,240
he wanted to drag Palace of Eternal Spring in mire.

420
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,040
Her Majesty manages the imperial harem and holds a high status.

421
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,360
Somebody must be coveting her position

422
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,040
and want to use this to destroy her reputation.

423
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,200
What's worse than a close attendant of the Her Majesty

424
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,160
having illicit affair with a man from the outside?

425
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,640
In the light of such a crime,

426
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,200
you’ll challenge the ability of Her Majesty to manage the imperial harem.

427
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,680
They may also try to make things difficult for her, and then take away her power!

428
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,600
I said that this is a misunderstanding.

429
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,960
It's not that terrible.

430
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,760
What's terrible is not my guess,

431
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,060
but those who masterminded all this.

432
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,920
They want to punish me,

433
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,920
drag Palace of Eternal Spring in mire,

434
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,800
vilify the innocent Empress,

435
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,920
and even make a disturbance in the whole inner palace.

436
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,720
Your Majesty,

437
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,700
you can’t believe Wei Yingluo’s crazy talk.

438
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,720
I just believed the words of Qingxi.

439
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,960
Her Majesty and I never had any grudges,

440
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,490
and I admire her character.

441
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,640
How could I dare try to destroy her reputation?

442
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,240
May Your Majesty investigate this.

443
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,000
Your Majesty, I need justice.

444
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,970
Her Majesty needs justice!

445
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,520
The whole Palace of Eternal Spring needs justice!

446
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,760
All of you, shut up!

447
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,680
Qingxi,

448
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,530
you framed a palace maid of Palace of Eternal Spring.

449
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,840
You are not worthy to be a guard of the Gate of Celestial Purity.

450
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,160
You are to be lashed 100 times,

451
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,480
dismissed and investigated.

452
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,080
Your Majesty, I'm innocent!

453
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,120
Prince Yi,

454
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,810
Prince Yi forced me to do it!

455
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,640
I'm innocent, Your Majesty!

456
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,040
Your Majesty!

457
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,640
I'm innocent, Your Majesty!

458
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,560
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

459
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,680
As for you,

460
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,520
you call this stupid thing calligraphy?

461
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,280
You have the nerve to say you make daily progress?

462
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,400
I feel sorry for Her Majesty.

463
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,090
How much effort does it take

464
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,780
to enlighten a piece of stone!

465
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,960
Go back now

466
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,600
and copy it 100 times.

467
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,280
You are not allowed to rest before finishing it!

468
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:17,920
Your Majesty.

469
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,720
You can leave!

470
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:20,960
Leave now.

471
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,240
Your Majesty is wise and not biased.

472
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,240
I believe

473
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,120
you’ll make a fair judgment.

474
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,450
You dare intimidate me?

475
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,440
Your Majesty, Wei Yingluo was wronged.

476
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,760
She spoke in haste and doesn't know what she's talking about.

477
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,000
May Your Majesty calm your anger.

478
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,840
Get out of here!

479
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,560
Yes.

480
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,160
Hongxiao.

481
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,680
Your Majesty,

482
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,280
I'm innocent.

483
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,120
I mean it!

484
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:09,760
Innocent?

485
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,200
Innocent!

486
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,680
Do you know

487
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,010
why you have your title?

488
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,520
The old Thirteenth Prince racked his brains

489
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,240
for Great Qing

490
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,880
and dedicated his life to his Royal Brother

491
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,960
in exchange for it.

492
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,620
As descendant of old Thirteenth Prince,

493
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,240
you should be loyal and responsible.

494
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,740
But what did you do?

495
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,000
You are full of resentments every day.

496
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,520
You blame me for not giving you the opportunity.

497
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,360
Why don't you think about

498
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,840
what you have done?

499
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,480
A palace maid, a guard

500
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,840
and a secret date!

501
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,720
What do you think the Forbidden City is?

502
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,200
Who do you think you are?

503
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,000
I must interrogate

504
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,080
this childish case.

505
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:53,880
Why!

506
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,200
Because it's embarrassing!

507
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:57,920
Embarrassing!

508
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,440
Embarrassing! Understand?

509
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,040
You embarrassed old Thirteenth Prince!

510
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,080
You embarrassed the Aisin Gioro family!

511
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,360
Your Majesty, Your Majesty!

512
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,400
I know my mistake! I know it!

513
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,560
Your Majesty, Your Majesty!

514
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,820
Please don't be angry.

515
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,280
Prince Yi was just too thoughtless.

516
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,840
For the sake of old Prince Yi,

517
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,120
please forgive him.

518
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,480
Tell me.

519
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,440
Who were you colluding with?

520
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,540
If you don't say it,

521
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,170
I will punish you severely.

522
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,600
Your Majesty,

523
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,600
I personally saw Prince Yi

524
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,200
meeting with a close maid of Consort Jia of Palace of Gathered Elegance.

525
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,520
Hongxiao.

526
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,760
Your Majesty.

527
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,290
Director of Rites Jin Jian and I

528
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,000
have always been close.

529
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,920
Consort Jia was demoted

530
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,240
because of the palace maid Yingluo,

531
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,440
so they were plotting a secret revenge.

532
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,360
I thought Yingluo was just a palace maid and an easy task,

533
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,400
so I agreed to help.

534
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,520
I was too thoughtless.

535
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,450
I know I’m wrong.

536
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,800
I know I’m wrong! I know I’m wrong, Your Majesty.

537
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,480
Li Yu.

538
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,600
I’m here.

539
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,680
Go to Palace of Gathered Elegance now and issue an edict.

540
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,080
Don't take away my child!

541
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:14,880
Don’t take him away!

542
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,640
Don't take away my child!

543
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:24,160
Consort Jia, this is His Majesty's order.

544
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,840
Don't make it hard for us.

545
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,640
Give me the child...

546
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,240
No.

547
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,520
Yongcheng is my son.

548
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,280
Mother.

549
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,210
Why is His Majesty taking him away?

550
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,120
Why is His Majesty doing this to me?

551
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,680
I want to see His Majesty.

552
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,000
I'm going to see His Majesty now!

553
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,120
Consort, others don't know what's going on.

554
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,720
Don’t you know it?

555
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,140
What did I do wrong?

556
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,400
Ah-Shuang has confessed everything.

557
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,000
You may do anything,

558
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,930
but why must you provoke Prince Yi to create trouble?

559
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,640
Once he’s found,

560
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,760
wouldn't you implicate yourself?

561
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,160
She's just a palace maid.

562
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,520
What if I kill her?

563
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,480
Mother.

564
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,360
I suffered for ten months of being pregnant

565
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,280
and gave this little prince

566
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,480
for His Majesty.

567
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,360
Even if it’s not some merit, it’s hardship!

568
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,840
How could His Majesty do this to me?

569
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,440
Consort,

570
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,480
you are just playing dumb.

571
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,320
Were you framing Wei Yingluo?

572
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,800
You were accusing a close maid of Her Majesty

573
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,880
of breaking a taboo.

574
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,920
This is publicly slapping Her Majesty!

575
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,480
Not to say Palace of Eternal Spring,

576
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,480
His Majesty will not spare you.

577
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,500
It's not like this.

578
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,400
I...

579
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,320
I was forced to do it,

580
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,160
Eunuch Li.

581
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:49,620
Mother.

582
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,160
Consort Jia, who forced you to do it?

583
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,960
Greetings to you, Noble Consort.

584
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,640
Li Yu,

585
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,380
I'm the master empress of Palace of Gathered Elegance.

586
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,810
Consort Jia committed a mistake and can't raise Fourth Prince.

587
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,400
He should be sent to me.

588
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,800
How can he be sent to Consort Xian?

589
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,880
Empress,

590
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,440
this is His Majesty's order.

591
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,920
His Majesty said

592
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,680
that Consort Jia lives in Palace of Gathered Elegance.

593
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,880
He fears that Fourth Prince will be under bad influence.

594
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,740
He should live far away from here.

595
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,800
- Be good. - Mother, mother!

596
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,250
- Mother! – Come.

597
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,480
Let me take a look.

598
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,240
Empress.

599
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,680
- Mother. - Come here. - Mother. - Come here.

600
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,920
Empress, Empress.

601
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,380
Mother.

602
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,160
Let me take a look.

603
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,600
Stop crying. My heart breaks.

604
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,360
How big could the Forbidden City be?

605
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:12,960
Even if he's at Palace of Receiving Celestial Favor, I can reach him.

606
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,360
Empress...

607
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,080
Come here.

608
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,360
Be good and go.

609
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,880
Empress, Empress, Empress!

610
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:23,000
Yongcheng! Yongcheng! Yongcheng!

611
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,720
I'm taking my leave.

612
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,640
Yongcheng.

613
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,360
Yongcheng! My son!

614
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,080
Shut up!

615
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,640
Yongcheng, Yongcheng!

616
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,000
Yongcheng!

617
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,360
Useless brat.

618
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,720
Your crying is very annoying.

619
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,760
His Majesty is merely giving you a warning.

620
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,880
He just sent Fourth Prince to Palace of Receiving Celestial Favor.

621
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,880
He didn't say you can't visit him.

622
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,770
Noble Consort Empress,

623
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,490
Noble Consort Empress,

624
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,210
Noble Consort Empress!

625
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,240
If you have the time to be sad,

626
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,560
why don't you think about

627
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,600
how to get your son back?

628
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,090
Noble Consort Empress,

629
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,440
Noble Consort Empress.

630
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,730
Noble Consort Empress,

631
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,200
you intend to adopt Fourth Prince?

632
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,800
If I want a child, I can have my own.

633
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:26,160
Why would I want to raise a stupid one?

634
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,400
You mean...

635
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,520
Those years,

636
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,400
Consort Jia has done a lot for me.

637
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,400
She knows too much.

638
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,400
But as long as Fourth Prince is alive,

639
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,320
she won't be able to turn anything upside down.

640
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,920
You are wise.

641
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,280
Now that Fourth Prince has been taken away,

642
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,640
will he return?

643
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,760
This will depend on how capable Consort Jia is.

644
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,120
Your Majesty, Your Majesty,

645
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,120
please spare me!

646
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:05,640
Take him out.

647
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,480
Your Majesty!

648
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,520
Your Majesty!

649
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,280
Please spare me!

650
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,720
Your Majesty!

651
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,520
I didn't expect

652
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,280
we have a spy

653
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,240
in Palace of Eternal Spring.

654
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,400
Since the lychee trees were destroyed,

655
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,740
I have always suspected we have a spy.

656
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,850
I was waiting for them to take actions.

657
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,920
Who knew they would be so impatient

658
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,800
and take risks again so soon.

659
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,320
Poor Fourth Prince.

660
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,920
He's so young

661
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,360
and has left his mother.

662
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,250
Consort Jia is reaping what she has sowed.

663
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,920
If she didn't harbor evil intentions and sought revenge,

664
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,520
how could she have been separated from her son?

665
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,640
No matter what,

666
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,680
His Majesty has left you some decency

667
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,560
by doing this.

668
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,920
His Majesty never meant to uphold justice.

669
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,400
What did you say?

670
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,880
About Consort Jia,

671
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,280
His Majesty is angry

672
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,940
because she used evil tactics

673
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,460
to harm the reputation of Palace of Eternal Spring.

674
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,400
At the same time, His Majesty doesn't want Fourth Prince

675
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,400
to live with a narrow-minded mother

676
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,240
who uses evil tactics.

677
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,820
From the beginning until now,

678
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,060
His Majesty has never taken into consideration

679
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,320
the wrong accusation and justice.

680
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,640
Yingluo!

681
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,740
If His Majesty meant to seek justice,

682
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,240
why did he let her off that lightly

683
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,380
and just took away Fourth Prince?

684
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,520
After all, Consort Jia is the birth mother of Fourth Prince.

685
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,400
By doing this,

686
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,200
His Majesty is giving Fourth Prince some dignity.

687
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,730
Even if this is the case,

688
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,600
what about Prince Yi?

689
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,360
Prince Yi is a cousin of His Majesty.

690
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,920
How could His Majesty...

691
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,720
Your Majesty,

692
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,200
you know it very well too.

693
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,400
Am I right?

694
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,120
I'm just a lowly palace maid.

695
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,400
His Majesty wouldn’t care

696
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,320
even if I die there

697
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,260
not to say some wrong accusation.

698
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,920
His Majesty was furious

699
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,240
because Prince Yi participated in the disputes in the inner palace.

700
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,600
Prince Yi failed to conceal it

701
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,000
and the Aisin-Gioro clan lost its dignity.

702
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,700
That's why Consort Jia was punished,

703
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,400
and Yet Prince Yi is still free and happy.

704
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:47,120
Prince Yi is a son of old Thirteenth Prince.

705
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,370
He's the famous and prestigious Prince Yi of Great Qing.

706
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,380
His Majesty can’t be harsh on him.

707
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,400
What if one day,

708
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,920
he commits a major mistake?

709
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,760
Miss Yingluo!

710
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,520
Put it down.

711
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,320
Isn’t this Miss Yingluo?

712
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,400
Where are you going?

713
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,600
Her Majesty instructed me

714
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,400
to deliver something to Palace of Eternal Peace.

715
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,330
Chamberlain Wu,

716
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:22,360
this is...

717
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,600
Palace of Earthly Tranquility holds offering ceremonies in the morning and at night.

718
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,760
Every three months, it’ll have a major ceremony.

719
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,230
Tomorrow is a major offering ceremony day.

720
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:31,230
His Majesty is rewarding the guards and the high officials

721
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:33,090
some meat to share the blessings.

722
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,199
Eat meat to share the blessings?

723
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:37,280
An old rule. You'll see it tomorrow.

724
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:40,150
Chamberlain Wu, you must be joking.

725
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,920
I'm always in Palace of Eternal Spring.

726
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,600
I can seldom come out.

727
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,560
I don't even know major events like this.

728
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,520
Before, Her Majesty was unwell.

729
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,920
His Majesty allowed Her Majesty not to attend the ceremonies.

730
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,880
Now that she's better,

731
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,230
how could she not attend a major offering ceremony and eat sacrificial meat?

732
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,430
Not only Her Majesty,

733
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,160
other concubines will get a share too.

734
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,360
Can’t talk anymore.

735
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,120
I have to go.

736
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,260
Please send my regard to Her Majesty.

737
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,520
Sister Erqing.

738
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,400
Yingluo, you're back so soon.

739
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,650
Her Majesty is inside, waiting for your updates.

740
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,100
Sister Erqing,

741
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,800
I have a question.

742
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:57,880
What is it?

743
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:58,800
I heard

744
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,280
that Her Majesty will attend the offering ceremony in Palace of Earthly Tranquility.

745
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,640
Is it true?

746
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,320
I'm worried about it.

747
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,400
Sacrificial meat may sound nice,

748
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,520
but it's just boiled in water and tasteless.

749
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:17,920
Sometimes

750
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,800
much of it is raw.

751
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,120
Her Majesty has never liked eating such things.

752
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,720
One time, she had a stomach upset because of it.

753
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,840
If Her Majesty doesn't like to eat it,

754
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,920
can't she just refuse it?

755
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,760
She can't.

756
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,240
It's blessings.

757
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,040
Whoever refuses it

758
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:36,320
is being disrespectful to the ancestors and the gods.

759
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,200
One time,

760
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,760
an official vomited it

761
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,840
and got lashed 80 times.

762
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,400
That severe?

763
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,640
Sister Erqing,

764
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,760
could you take me with you?

765
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,640
I've never seen an offering ceremony

766
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,570
in Palace of Earthly Tranquility.

767
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,840
That event is not nice to see.

768
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,600
You're sure you want to go?

769
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,120
Yes! Take me with you!

770
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,700
Your eye is having cramps?

771
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,680
No.

772
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,210
A beautiful palace maid comes for you.

773
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,440
Look.

774
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,720
See?

775
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,210
Didn't you watch Prince Yi for her?

776
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,720
Now, she personally comes to thank you.

777
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,720
I'll be back soon.

778
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,690
Why are you here?

779
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,680
I have a question.

780
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,370
You want to know why I was in the Imperial Garden that day?

781
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:44,570
I discovered that Prince Yi was frequently meeting Qingxi.

782
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,700
So I kept an eye on them.

783
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,260
The I found Qingxi was secretly monitoring Palace of Eternal Spring,

784
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,060
and I became doubtful.

785
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:55,770
Afterwards,

786
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,200
Qingxi changed the day of his shift.

787
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,400
I concluded that they were making their move.

788
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,040
So

789
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,560
you deliberately lured His Majesty there?

790
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,360
Looks like the two of us are very much fated.

791
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,560
Or else, why would the heaven

792
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,290
let Young Master come to my side

793
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,200
when I was in urgent need of help?

794
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,600
Young Master, thank you.

795
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,320
Young Master, thank you.

796
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,530
You’re welcome.

797
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,650
Wei Yingluo!

798
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,970
I'm a distinguished prince of the Great Qing.

799
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,640
You're just a lowly palace maid.

800
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,520
You complained

801
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,320
to His Majesty about me and then?

802
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,440
What can you do to me?

803
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,680
Why are you staring at me like that?

804
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,760
I'm so afraid.

805
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,760
You've got connections with Fuheng and so what?

806
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,800
A bitch is a bitch.

807
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,200
You have nothing decent.

808
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,840
Sooner or later,

809
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,040
I will rip your head off.

810
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,400
I will let you know

811
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,330
what is superior and inferior,

812
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,280
noble and lowly.

813
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,600
Young Master.

814
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,280
You all leave first.

815
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:46,960
Yes.

816
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,330
Why are you here?

817
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,690
Waiting for you.

818
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:54,760
What’s up?

819
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,800
This is...?

820
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,570
Spiced salt?

821
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,120
I heard that sacrificial meat is half-cooked

822
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,120
and flavorless.

823
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,360
Many people vomit and get punished.

824
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,380
I then prepared some spiced salt.

825
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,760
Just rub it on meat

826
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,240
when no one is watching

827
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,880
and you'll be able to eat the meat.

828
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,480
Yingluo,

829
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,130
this is inappropriate.

830
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,040
Just hide it in your sleeve.

831
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,600
There are so many people.

832
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,730
Who would notice it?

833
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,400
I'll take it as you've accepted it.

834
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,060
Her Majesty is looking for me.

835
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,010
I must leave now.

836
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,320
Serve the meat.
