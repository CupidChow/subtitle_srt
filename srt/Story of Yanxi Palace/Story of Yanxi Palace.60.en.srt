1
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,640
Don't get me wrong.

2
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,600
I will not harm your beloved.

3
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,320
I just find Imperial Concubine Shun

4
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,160
familiar at first sight.

5
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,760
If she wishes,

6
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,640
she may come to my Palace often

7
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,560
to keep me company.

8
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,200
Yes,

9
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,560
I'm willing.

10
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,850
Yingluo, how is Imperial Concubine Shun?

11
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,760
Fine now.

12
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,040
Let's go.

13
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,250
What happened exactly?

14
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,810
Today, I attended Princess He'an's death anniversary.

15
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,000
I wanted to seek Empress Dowager's delight,

16
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,660
but the offering suddenly erupted into flames.

17
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,920
The Grand Shaman said I was ominous,

18
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,170
and pressed Empress Dowager to punish me.

19
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,280
How did you escape it?

20
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,000
I don't know either.

21
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,180
Empress Dowager was going to grant me death,

22
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:20,010
but she suddenly changed her mind.

23
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,400
Before,

24
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,480
a palace maid accidentally

25
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,140
dropped and broke a doll that He’an used to play.

26
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,760
Empress Dowager, even though so merciful at ordinary times,

27
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,760
actually ordered for an immediate flogging to death.

28
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,000
That was the first time I ever saw the Empress Dowager furious.

29
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,600
She was like another person.

30
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,490
Ever since then, I’ve learned that

31
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,079
He'an wasn't just the beloved daughter of Empress Dowager,

32
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,690
she was also her only sore spot.

33
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,250
Today you ruined the ceremony.

34
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,450
She had to vent her anger at you,

35
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,560
but how come she’d led you go

36
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,810
after getting so mad at you?

37
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,280
I…

38
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,000
I really don't know.

39
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,490
I want to hear the truth.

40
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,180
It was Consort Ling that saved me.

41
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,880
-Consort Ling! -Yingluo!

42
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,640
What are you doing?

43
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,840
-Yingluo! -Your Highness!

44
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,760
-Yingluo! -Your Highness!

45
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,760
What are you doing?

46
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,520
Saving your life.

47
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,650
Where are you going?

48
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,480
Don't move.

49
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,480
It hurts so bad!

50
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,880
Better than death!

51
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,050
What on earth are you doing?

52
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:39,159
You're bleeding.

53
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,140
Don't move.

54
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,970
I'll stop the bleeding.

55
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,320
Starting now,

56
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,680
every word I say,

57
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,240
you must remember them clearly.

58
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,640
If you remember it wrong,

59
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,520
you're done!

60
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,520
So as I thought!

61
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,680
Your Majesty,

62
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,760
you’ve known?

63
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,460
Yingluo has been accompanying Empress Dowager all along.

64
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,360
She is very familiar with all aspects of Empress Dowager.

65
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,820
If she wanted to drive a wedge,

66
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,090
you would have been dead

67
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,720
by now.

68
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,440
Then,

69
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,210
you still blame her?

70
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,920
I am happy.

71
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,600
You're not happy.

72
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,200
You knew that Consort Ling is innocent,

73
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,250
but you reprimanded her on purpose still.

74
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,440
You wanted to irritate her.

75
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,360
Why would I do that?

76
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,680
Because you are upset that she doesn't care about you,

77
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,280
she lives her life as usual,

78
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,920
and turns a blind eye on

79
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,400
the grace that you give me!

80
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,159
Chenbi.

81
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,120
Don't talk nonsense.

82
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,480
Your Majesty.

83
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,040
I have eyes and I have a heart.

84
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,900
I can tell what’s going on.

85
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,320
Your Majesty treats me very well.

86
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,480
But in your heart,

87
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,460
you’ve already had another woman live in there.

88
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,020
You are thinking too much!

89
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,440
Rest early.

90
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,680
Your Majesty,

91
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,660
I am willing to help you

92
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,320
find out how Consort Ling really thinks of you.

93
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,560
Your Majesty,

94
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,040
you are the person I admire the most.

95
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,040
I respect you like a god,

96
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,159
and I want you to be happy.

97
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,440
Chenbi.

98
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,580
I really don't quite understand you.

99
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,960
In your heart,

100
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,560
you must think it’s normal that

101
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,560
the harem consorts

102
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,720
envy and harm each other.

103
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,600
But I've always believed that consorts

104
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,680
can live in harmony.

105
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,320
No.

106
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,040
I don't want to be friends with

107
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,640
the other consorts,

108
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,360
except for Consort Ling,

109
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,530
whom I am willing to accept.

110
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,920
She's cold outside but warm inside,

111
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,290
worthy of befriending.

112
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,500
She’s also Your Majesty's favorite,

113
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,600
isn’t she?

114
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,680
Chenbi.

115
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,480
Your Majesty.

116
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,600
You’ve tried all sorts of measures to test her,

117
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,080
so that you could find out

118
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,200
if she cares about you.

119
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,520
As long as you allow me to work for you,

120
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,080
I assure you that

121
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,050
you’ll find the answer.

122
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,080
I've used you.

123
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,050
You truly aren't angry?

124
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,520
Your Majesty.

125
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,680
You've given me much more than that.

126
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,360
You respect my personal life

127
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,440
and allow me to be unconstrained.

128
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,640
Even the pony outside

129
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,240
was selected by you personally.

130
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,680
Your Majesty deserves me loving you

131
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,760
with my whole heart.

132
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,160
I’m surprised that

133
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,000
you said those to me.

134
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,880
Your Majesty.

135
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,360
I am willing to give you the best things

136
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,640
in the world.

137
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,240
Thank you.

138
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,000
However,

139
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,520
I'm doing this

140
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,760
not because I deem Wei Yingluo especially valuable,

141
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,890
but because I can't stand the fact that

142
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,360
I don’t come first

143
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,160
in her heart.

144
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,930
Understand?

145
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,120
Yes. I understand.

146
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,050
You need to keep this conversation

147
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,920
to yourself!

148
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,450
Your Highness! Your Highness!

149
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,320
The Empress is inside.

150
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,660
Greetings to Your Highness the Empress.

151
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,680
Consort Ling,

152
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,240
I've reminded you not to get close to Imperial Concubine Shun.

153
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,920
Haven’t I made myself clear?

154
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,520
Your Highness.

155
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,680
I've told you,

156
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,880
I had nothing to do with this.

157
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,480
Yuan Chunwang.

158
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,720
Consort Ling.

159
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,280
Right after you came out of Empress Dowager's Palace,

160
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,040
she rushed to invite the abbot of Wanshou Temple.

161
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,360
Why was that?

162
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,440
Empress Dowager invited him to come to the palace to hold a meditation.

163
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,770
What’s wrong with that?

164
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,320
Wei Yingluo.

165
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,280
I thought you were crafty,

166
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,010
but at least you kept your word.

167
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,000
I didn't expect that you would break your promise and abandon the oath.

168
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,440
When we were at Palace of Longevity and Peace,

169
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,800
not only did you not help to get rid of Imperial Concubine Shun

170
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,080
but you saved her instead!

171
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,160
Did you lose your mind?

172
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,760
Imperial Concubine Shun's sin is not serious enough to get her killed.

173
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,220
Seducing the Emperor is deserving of death!

174
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,810
Now the one who deserves death the most is you!

175
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,880
How dare you ruin my plan?

176
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,160
I only agreed to cooperate with you.

177
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,620
I didn't agree to kill Imperial Concubine Shun.

178
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,320
Today, Consort Shu and Consort Jia both

179
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,040
have right to ask me this,

180
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,160
but you don’t!

181
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,330
What are you saying?

182
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,940
Empress, do you really think I know nothing?

183
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,600
If Empress Dowager really killed Imperial Concubine Shun over momentary anger,

184
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,360
it would anger His Majesty.

185
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,840
As filial as His Majesty is,

186
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,460
he naturally wouldn't blame Empress Dowager over a woman.

187
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,740
So whom he would vent his anger at?

188
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,120
Empress?

189
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,450
Consort Shu or Consort Jia?

190
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,400
No.

191
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,240
The first one he'd lash out at would be me.

192
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,160
because I have been by the side of Empress Dowager

193
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,960
and am now deemed her confidante.

194
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,220
Empress, you’d use the “borrowed knife”

195
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,240
to first kill Imperial Concubine Shun,

196
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,280
then,

197
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,960
me!

198
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,520
You're a woman who's lost favor anyway.

199
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,280
Why His Majesty would kill you?

200
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,760
In the end,

201
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,850
you just wanted to save Imperial Concubine Shun.

202
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,490
I really don't understand.

203
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,160
Publicly,

204
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,320
she's a seductress who's deluding the Emperor.

205
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:50,980
Privately,

206
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,860
she should be your love rival.

207
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,040
What did you

208
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,840
save her for?

209
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,400
I have said it.

210
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,410
Imperial Concubine Shun's sin is not serious enough to get her killed.

211
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,050
I already reminded you that

212
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,080
Imperial Concubine Shun is not that simple. You refused to listen and believe it.

213
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,280
Sooner or later, your kind heart

214
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,300
will cause to pay a painful price.

215
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,720
I will

216
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,200
wait for that day to come!

217
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,720
Take care, Your Highness Consort Ling.

218
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,480
Yingluo,

219
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,600
you offended the Empress big time, didn’t you?

220
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,280
If the Empress really took Imperial Concubine Shun down,

221
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,810
her next target would be me.

222
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,780
I don’t care if I offended her.

223
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,600
But if you make enemies with the entire harem

224
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,660
because of Imperial Concubine Shun,

225
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,440
is it worth it?

226
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,740
I already said,

227
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,580
I'm not doing this to help her.

228
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,970
I'm doing it to help myself.

229
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,040
You

230
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,570
are so stubborn.

231
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,060
Your Highness, please calm down.

232
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,380
It's not worth it being angry with a petty person who breached your trust.

233
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,170
Long live His Majesty! Long live His Majesty!

234
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,840
This Wei Yingluo!

235
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,970
Before I took action on her,

236
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,680
she took precautions first!

237
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,760
Looks like she's going to join forces with Imperial Concubine Shun

238
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,000
to go against me.

239
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,880
Your Highness,

240
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,680
don't worry.

241
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,720
I’ve taken care of the Grand Shaman.

242
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,240
She won't leave any other future troubles.

243
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,880
I'm not worried that this matter will leak out.

244
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,320
I'm only worried that with Empress Dowager's protection,

245
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,650
it will be harder to take action on Imperial Concubine Shun.

246
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,780
Your Highness.

247
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,040
If the Grand Shaman could be bribed,

248
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,440
why not the abbot of Wanshou Temple?

249
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,120
Grand Master Guangji is a person who supports just causes.

250
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,880
He won't compromise his integrity for a small sum of money.

251
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,480
As long as you are willing to remodel the golden statue of Buddha,

252
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,040
donate some money and food

253
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,280
to appease those homeless people in the temple,

254
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,680
and help the temple to tide over the crisis,

255
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,920
I think it won’t be a difficult thing

256
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,040
to ask the abbot

257
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,320
to say a few righteous words

258
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,220
in case Empress Dowager is fooled again.

259
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,280
Yuan Chunwang, quick-thinking!

260
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,400
Thank you for your praise, Your Highness!

261
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,720
I'm willing to share your burden.

262
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,320
Greetings, Empress Dowager.

263
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,480
Do you ask me to be here

264
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,580
to give me instructions, Your Highness?

265
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,660
Grand Master Guangji has told me that

266
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,240
rarely can people

267
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,760
reunite with a person through reincarnation.

268
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,520
I’ve been thinking about this,

269
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,140
and the more I think, the more I feel something’s wrong!

270
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,440
Let me ask you.

271
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,120
Do you have anything to do with the mark on Imperial Concubine Shun's face?

272
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,120
Empress Dowager,

273
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,660
how would I dare to do that?

274
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,360
You really didn't do it?

275
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,960
His Majesty dotes on Imperial Concubine Shun.

276
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,160
Although I don't blame her,

277
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,880
I wouldn't help her

278
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,380
to fool you either, Empress Dowager.

279
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,640
Yingluo,

280
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,260
you have been with me for three years.

281
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,240
I know you better than anyone else.

282
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,720
You are quite prickly,

283
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,440
and brilliant.

284
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,440
You may lie to me

285
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,090
in order to save Imperial Concubine Shun.

286
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,040
Empress Dowager, I wouldn't dare!

287
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,420
Empress Dowager, Imperial Concubine Shun is here.

288
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,500
Since you won’t tell me the truth,

289
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,640
I can only summon Imperial Concubine Shun here.

290
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,240
You can confront each other.

291
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,680
She's not as sharp as you are.

292
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,280
If I find anything from my interrogation,

293
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,960
I will definitely punish you both.

294
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,180
Tell her to come in.

295
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,400
Yes.

296
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,920
I respectfully greet the Empress Dowager.

297
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,780
Imperial Concubine Shun,

298
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,720
were you telling the truth?

299
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,940
Empress Dowager, please forgive me.

300
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,680
I lied!

301
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,000
Fine.

302
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,440
Be honest.

303
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,840
Did anyone teach you to say that?

304
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,520
If that is the case,

305
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,180
I'm going to mete out punishment.

306
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,600
Empress Dowager,

307
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,200
I did lie.

308
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,560
They were right.

309
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,480
I'm unlucky.

310
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,780
What are you trying to say?

311
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,520
When I was born,

312
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,609
everything was normal.

313
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,400
But when I got older, I kept being ill.

314
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,440
I kept saying that

315
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,480
I lived in a crystal house.

316
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,200
I cried for Nanny Wen

317
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,130
and dancing dolls all the time.

318
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,800
Everyone was scared.

319
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,080
A visiting lama passed by.

320
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,800
He did an exorcism on me,

321
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,680
and thus I became normal again.

322
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,040
He said that this was called a "borrowed reincarnation".

323
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,000
Good thing it was found out early on.

324
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,880
Otherwise, he couldn't have preserved my life.

325
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,240
Empress Dowager.

326
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,480
When the Grand Shaman brought this out in the open on that day,

327
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,280
I was terrified.

328
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,920
That's why I denied it.

329
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,680
Yes. I'm not normal like others,

330
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,580
but I have never done anything bad

331
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,920
to harm anybody!

332
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,880
I know that concealment equals deception.

333
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,720
If you want to punish,

334
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,960
then punish me,

335
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,240
Empress Dowager.

336
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,120
Imperial Concubine Shun,

337
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,520
Empress Dowager is kind.

338
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,760
She’s already forgiven you.

339
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,560
How could she pursue this matter?

340
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,520
Please rise!

341
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,280
Come here!

342
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,080
Come here!

343
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,720
My dear child,

344
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,160
I've been told it's rare to have such an encounter in life.

345
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,440
You are blessed by God!

346
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,540
How could I blame you for this?

347
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,280
Don't be afraid, child.

348
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,160
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

349
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,140
What you said just now,

350
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,810
I didn't even know that.

351
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,370
Who taught you that?

352
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,480
His Majesty.

353
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,680
His Majesty?

354
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,000
He was afraid the beans would be spilled.

355
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,560
She is always reckless

356
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,730
with whatever she does.

357
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,770
She’ll get in trouble sooner or later!

358
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,000
You are right, Your Majesty!

359
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,200
When He'an was young,

360
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,650
she cried her eyes out every time when she took medicine.

361
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,010
Empress Dowager

362
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,920
asked the servants to place

363
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,580
many glass objects in her room

364
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,520
to shift her attention.

365
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,500
It looked just like

366
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,080
a crystal house.

367
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,920
She also relied very much on

368
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,360
her wet nurse Wen.

369
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,080
Once evening came, she would start looking for her.

370
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,440
No one could stop her.

371
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,880
Empress Dowager

372
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,740
even customized a puppet for her.

373
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,320
When she saw the puppet,

374
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,520
she would dance along

375
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,480
with the movements of it.

376
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,320
His Majesty is so good to you!

377
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,000
Perhaps,

378
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,400
he didn’t do this for me.

379
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,920
Her Highness spent the whole night

380
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,600
practicing the lines with me,

381
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,480
in case she couldn’t tell the story naturally.

382
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,000
Thanks to you,

383
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,760
Consort Ling is safe now.

384
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,760
Yingluo lied for me.

385
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,800
Of course, I can't give her away.

386
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,880
He protected me

387
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,170
and I protected you.

388
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,800
I must act well.

389
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,880
The less you talk,

390
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,370
the less there is to expose.

391
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,500
Remember this.

392
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:44,920
I will!

393
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,160
Empress Dowager hated Imperial Concubine Shun so much before.

394
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,960
But now, she’s totally changed!

395
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,920
You used drastic measures to deal with the situation.

396
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,400
It was a real life-saver.

397
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,120
Empress Dowager is powerful and sits in a high position,

398
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,320
but she is also human.

399
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,320
Humans have weaknesses.

400
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,400
Even if she has doubts in her heart,

401
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,600
she will still be on intimate terms with Imperial Concubine Shun.

402
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,130
Because you teach her well!

403
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,120
It’s up to her to learn well though.

404
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,040
As far as I see,

405
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,320
Imperial Concubine Shun is the smartest student.

406
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,610
She can quickly pick up things.

407
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,040
And,

408
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,490
use what she learned flexibly.

409
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,160
Yingluo, sounds like there’s more in your line.

410
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,640
No,

411
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,480
she is fine.

412
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,080
I’m just used to being alert,

413
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,040
and unable to fully trust people.

414
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,240
No matter what,

415
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,440
helping her

416
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,120
will cause more jealousy from the harem.

417
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,720
In the past, you had His Majesty's protection.

418
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,600
Now, without it,

419
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,840
I fear it will be tough for you to go forward.

420
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,480
Don't worry,

421
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,160
the sky will not fall.

422
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,160
Mingyu, where's the Wujin stone

423
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,820
I brought back from Hall of Mental Cultivation?

424
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,880
I think it's in the storeroom.

425
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,040
I’ll go look for it.

426
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:01,720
Go ahead.

427
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,420
Your Highness,

428
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,400
do you have instructions for me?

429
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,560
Yes.

430
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,160
A happy thing!

431
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,440
Sister Mingyu!

432
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,980
Sister Mingyu!

433
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,290
Are you alright?

434
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,520
I’m fine!

435
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,840
I walked too fast earlier

436
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,640
and felt a bit of chest tightness.

437
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,400
Do you need me to assist you to rest?

438
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,000
I already said that I'm fine.

439
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,800
Go back to work.

440
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,520
But you look very pale.

441
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,000
Just go.

442
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:54,640
Go.

443
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,970
Come. All of you come in.

444
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,120
Place it in that room.

445
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,320
Be careful. Take it easy.

446
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,680
Come. Come. Hurry up!

447
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,960
Xiaoquan, what are these?

448
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,370
Sister Mingyu, congratulations!

449
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,080
For what?

450
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,600
For your joyous event!

451
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,480
All of you, take it easy. Be careful!

452
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:40,880
Mingyu?

453
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,200
Why are you here?

454
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,000
You sent people to deliver so many gifts.

455
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
What are they for?

456
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,120
Consort Ling didn't tell you?

457
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,480
Those gifts are my betrothal gifts.

458
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,730
Who said that I'm marrying you?

459
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,640
You'll reach the age to leave the palace by this June.

460
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,770
Have you forgotten?

461
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,440
Consort Ling didn’t forget.

462
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,320
She even sent an envoy to my home

463
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,650
to discuss our wedding.

464
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,000
She didn't tell me anything!

465
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,280
She said that if she told you,

466
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,640
you surely would refuse to leave the palace.

467
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,760
Of course, I can't leave her alone here

468
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,020
in the Forbidden City!

469
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,760
Mingyu,

470
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,760
are you then willing to

471
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,320
make me wait forever?

472
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,080
I'm the only son in my family.

473
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,640
Because I keep refusing to marry,

474
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,000
my mother is already very worried.

475
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,640
You two have arranged my marriage behind my back.

476
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,160
I haven't even agreed to it yet.

477
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,160
I'll tell Consort Ling that the marriage is canceled.

478
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,640
Wait!

479
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,770
You are tricking me!

480
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:50,760
Mingyu,

481
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,260
I'm earnestly asking you now,

482
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,370
are you willing to marry me?

483
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:57,880
I...

484
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,120
I will eventually

485
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,180
join the battlefield one day.

486
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,570
Maybe what's waiting for me is…

487
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,220
Don't speak any inauspicious words!

488
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,760
Even so,

489
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,820
are you still willing to marry me?

490
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,800
Hailancha,

491
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,450
I'm willing to be your wife.

492
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,280
You can go fulfill your wish,

493
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,640
but remember,

494
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,890
no matter what happens,

495
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,840
I'll wait for you.

496
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,210
I'll wait for you to return.

497
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:44,760
I can only

498
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,960
find the needles hiding under her skin.

499
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,400
It's possible that some have traveled into her lungs.

500
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,160
I fear that…

501
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,880
Miss Mingyu, you must be very careful.

502
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,050
When the needle enters your lungs, even the deities can't save you.

503
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,700
This is the scent of jasmine flowers.

504
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,920
This is jasmine oil.

505
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,520
The way of making it is similar to

506
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,360
making osmanthus fragrance that I taught you last time.

507
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,620
It's just that the fragrance won't last as long as that of osmanthus flowers.

508
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,800
But I still prefer

509
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,800
the white lily fragrance you gave me last time.

510
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,860
After applying it,

511
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,050
the scent can last for over a month.

512
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,640
You're done checking the betrothal gifts?

513
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,320
I'm not getting married!

514
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,840
Yingluo,

515
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,240
I think the flowers outside are in full bloom.

516
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,040
I'll go pick some flowers to make fragrance, okay?

517
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,920
Can I borrow this fragrance manual too?

518
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,360
Mingyu,

519
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,320
you and Hailancha have been together for a long time.

520
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,080
Although it was official given the hindrance of your statuses,

521
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,410
you two have been attracted to each other.

522
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,360
Now, you're finally able to be with each other,

523
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,200
why are you saying that you don’t want to get married?

524
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,200
We've been together for a long time.

525
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,720
I don’t want to leave you!

526
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,000
I don't want to leave the palace.

527
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,800
I also don't want to get married.

528
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,160
I'll stay

529
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,120
and accompany you forever.

530
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:27,960
Okay?

531
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,490
What are you talking about?

532
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,620
We still can see each other

533
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,560
after you are married!

534
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,340
Also, you are after all a palace maid.

535
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,980
Your identity is special.

536
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:49,100
Although you've reached the right age and can make your own decision,

537
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,250
Hailancha still officially expressed it

538
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,720
to the Emperor just to show his respect.

539
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,080
You can’t change your mind now.

540
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,520
I don't care!

541
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,920
Anyway, I can't marry him!

542
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,080
I can't!

543
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Then you’ve got to

544
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,200
give me

545
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,520
an acceptable reason.

546
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,880
I just can’t!

547
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,380
I will never marry Hailancha!

548
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,560
Mingyu!

549
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,680
This one then.

550
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,520
Yes.

551
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,160
Imperial Concubine Shun?

552
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,490
What are you doing here?

553
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,920
What happened?

554
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,840
What else could it be?

555
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,780
Just that I don't want to get married.

556
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,680
If you're not willing to marry him,

557
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,540
why are you making him shoe soles?

558
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,720
You deliberately angered Yingluo.

559
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,640
What are you hiding?

560
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,400
Nothing!

561
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,640
Mingyu,

562
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,120
you're sick.

563
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,520
I'll go tell Yingluo.

564
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,440
No!

565
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,000
Don't tell her.

566
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,040
You must not tell her.

567
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,120
Please!

568
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,680
Why?

569
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,370
There is a silver needle

570
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,760
hidden in my body for a long time.

571
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,410
Moving with my blood, it has reached my heart.

572
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,500
I don't know how long I can still live.

573
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,760
Maybe a year.

574
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,960
Maybe a few months.

575
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,840
Maybe one day.

576
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,080
Or I might be gone

577
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,280
in a second.

578
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,560
If you tell Yingluo,

579
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,930
she surely won't be able to take it.

580
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,290
But you need treatment.

581
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,720
It can't be cured.

582
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,960
Ye Tianshi said that

583
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,560
it's incurable.

584
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,660
Since that's the case,

585
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,440
why waste time?

586
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,530
This is the reason why you won't marry?

587
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,880
If I marry Hailancha now,

588
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,640
it means I’ll let him watch me die

589
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,440
right in front of him.

590
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,600
Mingyu,

591
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,970
Hailancha personally reported this matter to His Majesty,

592
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,600
that once you reach the right age to leave the palace

593
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,000
and regain your freedom,

594
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,970
he will immediately marry you.

595
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,280
Yingluo knew that your family is poor.

596
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,080
She even personally prepared your dowry,

597
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,680
so that you can be married off in a grand manner.

598
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,960
If you bail out now,

599
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,260
how will Hailancha face the public’ judgement?

600
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,440
But I can't tell them.

601
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,960
Yingluo would be

602
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,440
so sad if she knew about this!

603
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,880
I can't say anything.

604
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,720
Mingyu.

605
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,460
What is done cannot be undone.

606
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,050
As long as you're alive,

607
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,530
you must get on the marriage sedan.

608
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:09,440
Yingluo,

609
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,880
give Mingyu some time to calm herself.

610
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,840
You don't understand.

611
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,239
Of course, I understand.

612
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,679
You are urging her to get married

613
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,639
because you feel it's not safe for her to be by your side.

614
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,370
You want to protect her, right?

615
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,560
Chenbi. Don’t make a groundless guess.

616
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,920
If Mingyu hears you,

617
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,000
she'll overthink it.

618
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,400
It's because of me.

619
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,820
Because of me, you offended the Empress.

620
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,480
You're afraid you've courted her revenge,

621
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,600
so you're sending Mingyu out of the palace.

622
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,719
It’s a good thing that Mingyu is reaching the age of leaving the palace.

623
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,120
You're overthinking it.

624
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,280
Also,

625
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,940
I've never been scared of anyone.

626
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,480
You're not afraid,

627
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,210
but you always want to protect others.

628
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,520
You two are both

629
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,679
concerned about each other,

630
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:58,460
but you won't come clean with each other.

631
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,760
Yingluo, you protected me,

632
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,090
and I'll never forget that.

633
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,520
Don't worry.

634
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,260
I will never let the Empress harm you.

635
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,900
What are you doing?

636
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,000
Your Majesty.

637
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,640
I greet Your Majesty.

638
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:41,720
Rise.

639
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,610
This is Hong Chu's "Notes on Fragrances."

640
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,930
When did you become interested in making fragrance?

641
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,280
I was just reading it

642
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,680
to kill some time.

643
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,720
Nothing much.

644
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,040
How are the rule lessons coming along?

645
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,760
Consort Ling is teaching me rules,

646
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
embroidery and art Appreciation.

647
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,100
She seems to know everything.

648
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,960
She does know a lot,

649
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,540
but she’s not versed in anything.

650
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,880
I've asked her many times before

651
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,820
to focus on just one thing,

652
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,160
but she argued that

653
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,880
she’d rather be an eclectic

654
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,480
than an expert.

655
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,600
All nonsense!

656
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,480
In my opinion,

657
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,360
she just doesn't have patience.

658
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,120
She learns everything, but only stays on the surface.

659
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,320
If you criticize her,

660
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,600
she’ll argue back

661
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,320
with her sharp tongue,

662
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,940
leaving you no chance.

663
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,600
Your Majesty.

664
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,760
Why did you stop?

665
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,360
You go to Palace of Everlasting Joy every day.

666
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:34,080
Has Consort Ling ever mentioned me

667
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,320
Of course.

668
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,920
What did she say?

669
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,680
She said…

670
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,240
She…

671
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,820
She never mentioned me at all, right?

672
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,000
Your Majesty, don't blame Yingluo.

673
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,320
You ignore her all the time.

674
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,800
She is only angry with you.

675
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,560
Angry

676
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,800
or doesn’t care at all?

677
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,650
She surely cares about you.

678
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,960
She's your consort. S

679
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,770
he only has you in her heart.

680
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,000
Of course, she misses you and longs for you.

681
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,680
She won't say it now,

682
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,040
but it doesn't mean she doesn't.

683
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,600
One day

684
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,300
you will force her to speak her heart.

685
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,680
Will I?

686
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,480
You will. Of course, you will.

687
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,440
But it’ll only work when she has me in her heart.

688
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:49,840
Your Majesty,

689
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,480
no matter what,

690
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,880
you always come first in my heart!

691
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,160
Your Majesty.

692
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,360
Don't be upset.

693
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,040
If you're unhappy,

694
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,000
I’m unhappy too!

695
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,920
You're like a child.

696
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,520
Mingyu.

697
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,040
The wedding dress is here. Try it on.

698
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,760
I've already said everything that needs to be said.

699
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,520
Yingluo,

700
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,440
don't force me.

701
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,680
I am not forcing you. I am worried.

702
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,250
What are you worried about?

703
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,400
I am worried you'll miss out on your own happiness.

704
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,780
I won't marry Hailancha whatsoever!

705
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,240
Just forget about it!

706
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,400
Mingyu!

707
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,480
Shush!

708
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,540
How did you get in here?

709
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,290
I climbed over the wall.

710
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,890
What are you doing here?

711
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,640
I can't sleep,

712
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,760
so I wanted to come chat with you.

713
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,860
I am not used to sleeping next to someone!

714
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,240
You sleep over there.

715
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,570
I don't believe you.

716
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,040
If His Majesty were here,

717
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,850
you'd still ask him out?

718
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:32,800
Get up!

719
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:33,960
Go over there!

720
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,520
Okay, alright!

721
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,640
Go on! Over there!

722
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,400
Alright!

723
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,980
What are you doing?

724
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,320
Why are your feet so cold?

725
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,060
I'll warm them for you.

726
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,160
No need!

727
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:51,760
Quiet!

728
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:52,500
No need!

729
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,740
What is that sound?

730
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,370
Today is the lunar eclipse.

731
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,560
His Majesty will dress unadorned to evade the moon.

732
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,280
The court ministers will also burn incense and bow,

733
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,210
and assist with the moon ceremony.

734
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,130
What you heard was the sound of gongs and drums

735
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,480
to banish the heavenly dog

736
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,080
and save the moon!

737
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,040
You don't believe it?

738
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,660
Neither do you, right?

739
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,450
The first time I saw you,

740
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,720
I already knew

741
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,580
that you are not a superstitious person.

742
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,900
You seem to be serious when talking about it,

743
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,980
but inside, you must despise it a lot!

744
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,120
Don’t think you know me!

745
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,770
Despite your cold face, you have a warm heart,

746
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:49,320
but you always push people away.

747
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:54,960
At this rate,

748
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,480
you’ll only push the people who care about you

749
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,940
further and further away.

750
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,360
Sometimes women

751
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,520
need to learn to show a softer side,

752
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,340
so that you’ll get more people to care about you.

753
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,680
You coax His Majesty in all ways,

754
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,600
but you refuse to tell him how you really feel.

755
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,400
Your sharp tongue won’t

756
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,770
bring you anything good, regardless of your warm heart.

757
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,850
Why do you always follow me around?

758
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,480
You and I both don't belong in the Forbidden City,

759
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,080
but we have to be confined here forever.

760
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,080
You're so lonely,

761
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,560
and so am I.

762
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,580
Why can't we seek warmth from each other?

763
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,040
I have Mingyu.

764
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,240
Whatever you say or do,

765
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,400
you have to explain to her over and over.

766
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,600
She obeys you,

767
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,400
but she doesn't understand you.

768
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:10,720
Isn’t that a pity?

769
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,400
People with different backgrounds

770
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,640
cannot be true friends.
