[Story of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 70]

4
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:53,039
I'll only ask you this.

5
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,800
When chaos broke out on the ship,

6
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,530
did you think of me just a little?

7
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:00,770
Did you?

8
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,040
The empress is tired.

9
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,040
Bring her back to her chamber.

10
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,600
Your Majesty, please don't say anymore.

11
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,889
If I don't, it'll eat me alive!

12
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,930
Look at me.

13
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,050
My hair is in a mess.

14
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,450
My makeup is ruined.

15
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,329
And my hand.

16
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:34,290
I wanted to save my husband, my emperor!

17
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,970
Even if the flames leave scars on my hand,

18
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,570
I don't feel the pain,

19
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,810
I don't feel any pain at all!

20
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:43,730
You were in danger,

21
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,890
and I wanted to save you.

22
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:48,040
Even if I couldn't save you,

23
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,010
I'd rather die with you.

24
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,770
But this woman...

25
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,170
She is treacherous!

26
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:00,470
Even if you prepared in advance,

27
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,050
nothing can be guaranteed.

28
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,680
But despite knowing the danger,

29
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,130
you sent all your guards to protect her!

30
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,650
What has she done for you?

31
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,890
Nothing.

32
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,830
Nothing at all.

33
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,410
Wei Ying Luo has never loved you!

34
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,770
She only loves herself!

35
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,350
To achieve her own goals,

36
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,210
she used you again and again.

37
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,110
You don't cherish
the person who loves you,

38
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,310
yet you treasure a person
who doesn't love you!

39
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,610
Hong Li, you are such a fool!

40
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,570
No,

41
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,170
I'm the fool.

42
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,210
I...

43
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,610
am the biggest fool...

44
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,040
and the stupidest woman in this world.

45
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,090
Your Majesty.

46
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,690
Take the empress away.

47
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,410
Go away!

48
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,550
What are you trying to do?

49
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:14,030
Are you really crazy?

50
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,250
Your Majesty,

51
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:19,649
Empress Xiao Xian loved you,
but loved freedom more.

52
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:23,850
Consort Gao loved you,
but loved her family more.

53
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,210
Consort Chun had never loved you.

54
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,910
As for the others,

55
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,450
they only care about fame and wealth!

56
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,370
Only me...

57
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:36,110
I'm the only one who really loves you...

58
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,510
in the entire Forbidden City!

59
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:45,130
You mobilized the troops
in Hangzhou with a mere letter.

60
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,730
You still dare to say that you love me?

61
00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:50,570
Not only the Hangzhou troops.

62
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:54,370
Many of the Jiangnan officials...

63
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:57,330
have already become puppets.

64
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,800
Since my father passed away,

65
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,000
I've realized the importance of power.

66
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,890
All these years,

67
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,030
I gathered countless secrets about...

68
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:10,370
princes, dukes,
cabinet ministers and officials.

69
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:14,510
Some of them were corrupt,
some neglected their duties,

70
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,040
and some committed crimes.

71
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,560
That's why they were all afraid of me,

72
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,690
but they had to obey me.

73
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:24,270
When you die one day, Your Majesty,

74
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:26,630
I would become the second
Empress Dowager Xiao Zhuang!

75
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,930
That is absolute treason!

76
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,910
The harem can't
get involved in state affairs!

77
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,990
I did it to protect myself!

78
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,130
Lady Hoifa-Nara.

79
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,370
You've finally admitted it.

80
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,580
I've had hundreds, no,
thousands of chances to kill you.

81
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,730
I keep hearing a voice telling me,

82
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:48,610
do it!

83
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,330
Do it now!

84
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,409
But I couldn't do it.

85
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,890
My heart and feelings wouldn't let me!

86
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,290
I couldn't harm my husband.

87
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,330
I couldn't harm my beloved one.

88
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,970
I couldn't harm you!

89
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:19,970
Put down the knife.

90
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,970
You think I'd hurt her?

91
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,200
The one whom I hate the most is not her.

92
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,650
It's you!

93
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,409
Aisin-Gioro Hong Li!

94
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,850
I hate you so much!

95
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,490
I hate you!

96
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,930
Your Majesty!

97
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:14,310
We Manchus don't cut our hair
other than for a state funeral.

98
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,270
She's crazy.

99
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,810
The empress has really gone crazy!

100
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:23,410
Are you cursing me or the emperor?

101
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,410
The empress...

102
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,090
is behaving bizarrely...

103
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,040
and displaying signs of insanity.

104
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,720
Escort her back to the Forbidden City now.

105
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:08,690
Brother.

106
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,750
My sins have nothing to do
with the empress.

107
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:15,210
Please don't blame her.

108
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,010
Take him out!

109
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,690
I'm willing...

110
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,370
to be minced to death.

111
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:40,250
Yuan Chun Wang!

112
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,190
How dare you...

113
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,330
use a knife in front of His Majesty?

114
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,810
You liar!

115
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,590
You deceived me for over 10 years.

116
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,170
You are really crazy.

117
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:22,930
Your Majesty!

118
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,230
They have all gone insane! Insane!

119
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:28,110
I have been threatened by the empress...

120
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,430
and committed many tyrannical deeds.

121
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:34,390
I'm willing to make up for my sins
by testifying against...

122
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:37,050
the bribed officials in the cavalries.

123
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:39,410
Your Majesty, please spare my life!

124
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,970
The real perpetrator...

125
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:48,170
is now saying that he was threatened.

126
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:53,570
Are you really that innocent?

127
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:56,810
Ying Luo.

128
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:01,850
Are you saying that this
eunuch plotted everything?

129
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,770
Recently,

130
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:08,070
I've been thinking about
the story you told me.

131
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,390
My father...

132
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:14,050
lived in a huge mansion.

133
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,970
I was standing right in front of him,

134
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,140
but he refused to acknowledge me.

135
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,220
My brothers...

136
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:25,230
were all blue-blooded, just like me.

137
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:28,650
They are all high and mighty, but me?

138
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:36,570
Back then, I was engrossed
in my own sadness.

139
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,890
I didn't even pay attention.

140
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,250
That's why...

141
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,490
I sent someone to your hometown,

142
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,970
Taihang Mountain.

143
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,530
Taihang Mountain?

144
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,250
Everybody, leave!

145
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,770
Leave us, now!

146
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,730
Leave us, now!

147
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,090
Ying Luo.

148
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,850
Who exactly is he?

149
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,770
Your Highness.

150
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,910
You once told me the story...

151
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:28,020
of how Lady Qian distracted the killers...

152
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,820
who were after the late emperor.

153
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:32,570
Back then, the late emperor
was hiding in a farm.

154
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,610
And he...

155
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:37,290
is the son of the farmer's daughter...

156
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,110
who took in the late emperor.

157
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,700
Consort Ling,

158
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,940
I don't know what you are talking about.

159
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:51,210
Xiao Quan has been
investigating tirelessly.

160
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,530
He just joined us today.

161
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:57,650
He has brought a neighbor
who witnessed everything back then.

162
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,210
Would you like to meet him?

163
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,990
Wei Ying Luo.

164
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,010
Your Highness.

165
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,600
He claims to have...

166
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,710
the blood of the Aisin-Gioro clan
flowing in his veins,

167
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:13,430
but the late Prince Lian
got hold of him, castrated him...

168
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,890
and sent him to the palace.

169
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,040
That's why Yuan Chun Wang
instigated Prince He...

170
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,890
and pressured the empress,

171
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:23,000
so that he can manipulate Prince He...

172
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,350
to kill the empress dowager
and the emperor!

173
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,750
Once he succeeds,

174
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,200
he will then betray Prince He...

175
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,710
by exposing his crimes in front
of the imperial household.

176
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:34,000
That's how he planned to eliminate...

177
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,870
the emperor, the empress dowager,

178
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:38,610
the empress, Prince He and
everyone he hates!

179
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,620
To think a mere eunuch...

180
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,430
has the audacity...

181
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:48,650
to manipulate my brother like that!

182
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,590
I'm wondering how much your brothers...

183
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:56,130
really mean to you, Your Majesty?

184
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,210
Hong Li.

185
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:05,450
You were all born with
silver spoons in your mouths.

186
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,130
You own power and position.

187
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:09,930
Do you know how my life was?

188
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,330
I was a castrated soldier!

189
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,490
Do you know what that means?

190
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,510
I was the lowest-ranked eunuch...

191
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,250
in the Forbidden City.

192
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:28,650
I transported commodes and
manure carts every day.

193
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,110
Hong Li.

194
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:33,530
What gave you the right...

195
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:39,250
to enjoy an indulgent life
while I suffer this ghost-like existence?

196
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:42,530
But why did you take it out on Yong Qi?

197
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,130
Yuan Chun Wang,

198
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:49,390
Why did you switch
Physician Ye's saprophages?

199
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:52,000
They are Burmese
carrion beetles, you idiot!

200
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:55,810
They eat corpses.

201
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:59,680
They become extremely lethal once
in contact with flesh and blood.

202
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,850
Don't pretend anymore.

203
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,820
You saved Yong Qi,

204
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,650
but you hurt yourself!

205
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,730
You!

206
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:08,970
Extend your hand...

207
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:11,090
and show it to the emperor!

208
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,730
Extend your hand.

209
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,930
Show me!

210
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,980
Let me see!

211
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:32,200
Yuan Chun Wang, where's the antidote?

212
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,990
What antidote?

213
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:37,370
There's no antidote for
such powerful venom!

214
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:42,030
Wei Ying Luo, you promised me...

215
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:44,210
that you would accompany me forever.

216
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:47,210
You broke your promise, and that's fine.

217
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,850
I will help you fulfill it.

218
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,170
Li Yu!

219
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,290
-Call for Ye Tian Shi!
-Yes, Your Majesty.

220
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,490
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

221
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,890
The late emperor...

222
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,490
had no illegitimate child.

223
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,730
He...

224
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:20,880
isn't a descendant of Aisin-Gioro.

225
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,930
She's lying!

226
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,800
I am well aware of
whether the late emperor...

227
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,570
had an illegitimate child.

228
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:34,930
You claim to be a descendant
of the Aisin-Gioro Clan.

229
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,870
What evidence do you have?

230
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,040
Emperor Yong Zheng recuperated
in my grandfather's house.

231
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,450
He left behind a set of royal attire.

232
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,640
This is solid evidence.

233
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:51,310
To save the late emperor,

234
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,620
Lady Qian switched clothes with him.

235
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:59,710
It was a precious golden silk robe.

236
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:02,250
Would the bandits spare her?

237
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:09,770
No one knew who really...

238
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:12,320
took advantage of that farmer's daughter.

239
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,710
You are lying!
There's no other possibility!

240
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:15,890
It was him!

241
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:17,570
Impossible.

242
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,090
You're lying!

243
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,890
You could have...

244
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:24,290
led a life like any other person,

245
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:28,050
getting married and having children,

246
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,730
enjoying a normal life.

247
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:32,330
Unfortunately,

248
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:36,670
you believed a lie...

249
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:39,430
and came to the Forbidden City.

250
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:43,810
Then, you made yourself a castrated man.

251
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:46,650
You bore grudges and hatred.

252
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:51,370
Unfortunately, they were all
directed at the wrong person.

253
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,330
You are not...

254
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:58,330
the late emperor's son,

255
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:03,610
and you are not the emperor's brother.

256
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:09,210
Everything you did was just for naught.

257
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:11,970
What a pity.

258
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:17,390
What a pitiful child!

259
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,010
No!

260
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:20,599
I'm not pitiful!

261
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:22,119
I don't need your pity!

262
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,880
I told the truth! I am not wrong!

263
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:24,930
Liar.

264
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:26,470
You're lying to me, right?

265
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:28,329
You're lying to me!

266
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,090
You deserve to die.

267
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,830
You all deserve to die!

268
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,520
-Take this man out.
-You all deserve to die!

269
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,980
Tear his limbs off.

270
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:42,550
No!

271
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,880
Don't kill him.

272
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:52,750
Mother.

273
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,670
This man is falsely claiming royalty,

274
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,970
and his crimes are unforgivable.

275
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,170
Emperor.

276
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:06,010
Just listen to me this time.

277
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:19,510
-You all deserve to die.
-Take him away.

278
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,870
You all deserve to die!

279
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,950
Don't touch me! I'm a prince!

280
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:26,750
I'm an Aisin-Gioro! I really am!

281
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:29,390
I really am from the Aisin-Gioro clan!

282
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:33,930
I'm an Aisin-Gioro!

283
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,210
Hear my decree.

284
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,570
Return to the capital now.

285
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,570
Summon the imperial physicians!

286
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,010
I don't believe it.

287
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:24,930
There must be a way.

288
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,810
Right?

289
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:32,450
Your Majesty, I've done my best.

290
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,230
It's just that Her Highness...

291
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,770
Cut to the point.

292
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,290
Your Majesty.

293
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,530
Don't be so harsh on Physician Ye.

294
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,290
Li Yu,

295
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,050
I've sent men to find Fu Heng...

296
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:48,050
so he can research on this bug.

297
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,570
Any news from him?

298
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:52,810
Your Majesty, there is still no news.

299
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,520
All of you, get out!

300
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,780
Yes, Your Majesty.

301
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:13,330
You saved Yong Qi,

302
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,570
yet became gravely injured.

303
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:23,370
What have I done wrong?

304
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:29,450
Why is heaven punishing me like this?

305
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:33,370
I have to watch the people beside me...

306
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,490
leave me one by one.

307
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,490
I'm still here.

308
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,810
What about the future?

309
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,190
Your Majesty.

310
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,370
I'm not in the mood, scram.

311
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,930
There's an urgent report from Burma.

312
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,000
Your Majesty.

313
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,970
Go back to work.

314
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:16,410
I'll be here waiting for your return.

315
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:37,010
Wait for me.

316
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:08,810
Your Highness!

317
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,730
Stop crying.

318
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:22,930
When the three children arrive...

319
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,890
and see you crying,

320
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:30,530
I have to make new excuses up again.

321
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,330
Zhen Zhu.

322
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,700
If I die,

323
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:48,650
tell my three children...

324
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:53,290
that their mother...

325
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,730
went to travel around the world.

326
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:00,130
I didn't want to bring them with me...

327
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,480
because they are such a burden.

328
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,880
Your Highness, don't jinx yourself.

329
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,280
Got...

330
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:07,880
Got it?

331
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,820
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

332
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,650
Physician Ye!

333
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:12,930
Physician Ye!

334
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:15,350
-Your Highness!
-Physician Ye!

335
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,450
Hurry!

336
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:18,690
-Save her!
-Let her rest on bed.

337
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,960
Don't just stand here,
get me some clean water.

338
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,830
-Your Highness!
-Yes, Physician Ye!

339
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:27,720
-I'm on it.
-Madam, get me a clean handkerchief.

340
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,770
Okay!

341
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,430
Physician Ye, the water is here.

342
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,970
Hurry! Hurry!

343
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:39,730
Physician Ye, I beg you, save her!

344
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:43,130
Save Her Highness!

345
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,850
Your Highness!

346
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:25,210
Your Highness!

347
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:40,250
Her Highness is awake.

348
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:41,770
She's awake.

349
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,570
Your Highness.

350
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:45,530
Lord Hailan Cha is here.

351
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:48,030
Hailan Cha?

352
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:12,490
Aren't you at war with Fu Heng in Burma?

353
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,410
Why are you...

354
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:20,040
We have defeated the Burmese army.

355
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:23,010
The Burmese are requesting a truce.

356
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:26,610
I am here to deliver the memorial.

357
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,840
I knew it.

358
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,020
Fu Heng would surely win.

359
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:44,530
Is he returning with the main army?

360
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,090
Of course.

361
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:49,440
Lord Hailan Cha brought the antidote back.

362
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,330
Otherwise, you wouldn't be awake now.

363
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:54,530
Antidote?

364
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:58,120
It's a panacea made from
the sacred heart plant in Burma.

365
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:02,850
The sacred heart plant grows in
a swampy area infested by mosquitoes.

366
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:06,310
It can cure the poison
of carrion beetles...

367
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:09,450
and even preserve beauty and youth.

368
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,150
It's also called the panacea of youth.

369
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:14,930
Your Highness,
this is a blessing in disguise.

370
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,700
Where is Fu Heng?

371
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:32,970
In order to obtain the sacred heart herb,

372
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,610
he contracted malaria.

373
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,390
He insisted to continue battling
despite his illness,

374
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,520
and refused to leave the battlefield.

375
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:45,170
I tried to persuade him many times,

376
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,970
but he was too stubborn!

377
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,570
Hailan Cha.

378
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:55,970
Where is Fu Heng now?

379
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:00,330
Fu Heng's body...

380
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,850
has been sent back to the Forbidden City.

381
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,880
Hailan Cha...

382
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,210
I'm sorry.

383
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:44,210
I wasn't able to bring him back safely.

384
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,140
But Fu Heng said...

385
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:51,540
malaria will cause endless troubles.

386
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,580
We've lost so many soldiers.

387
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:57,490
If we couldn't win in one go,

388
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,700
we'd only end up losing the war.

389
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:02,210
As the commander,

390
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:05,210
he could only die

391
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:07,890
and never retreat.

392
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:11,290
Even if he had just one breath left,

393
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:14,610
he must win.

394
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,330
Consort Ling,

395
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:27,170
Fu Heng...

396
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:31,090
had a question for you.

397
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:46,090
Speak.

398
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:51,610
Wei Ying Luo.

399
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:56,330
I've spent my whole life...

400
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,090
staying by your side.

401
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,410
In the next life,

402
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:06,200
could you stay by my side?

403
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,690
Please forgive my impoliteness.

404
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:29,010
I wish you a swift recovery.

405
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:30,610
I...

406
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,750
I will take my leave.

407
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,930
Consort Ling,

408
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:58,850
I know that you are
His Majesty's favorite.

409
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:02,990
You're also the most powerful woman...

410
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:05,210
here in the Forbidden City.

411
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,800
But why won't you...

412
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:17,170
give him any hope?

413
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,470
Zhen Zhu.

414
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:37,690
Your Highness.

415
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:43,090
I want to be alone for a while.

416
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,360
You may leave now.

417
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,470
Yes, Your Highness.

418
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,430
His Majesty will be glad...

419
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:50,370
to learn that you're now fine.

420
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:52,170
I shall inform him now.

421
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,010
Sure.

422
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:37,170
I promise you.

423
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,780
Your Highness, it's time to eat.

424
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:33,680
His Majesty removed my servants
and retracted my conferment.

425
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,180
He removed my title as the empress.

426
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,850
He didn't leave me anything.

427
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,320
But the food here every day...

428
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,000
and your attitude towards me
doesn't seem fit for a criminal.

429
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:48,150
Your Majesty.

430
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:51,330
I once served Consort Dowager Yu.

431
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:54,170
Prince He?

432
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:59,130
Prince He said he wishes you all the best.

433
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:03,000
Is he doing fine?

434
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,490
How can criminals do fine?

435
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:09,790
His Majesty took account
of their brotherhood...

436
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,560
and only imposed a house arrest.

437
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,290
He didn't torment him further.

438
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,450
That's good to know.

439
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:26,370
Did he say anything else?

440
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:27,730
No, he didn't.

441
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:30,810
Thank you.

442
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,050
I will take my leave.

443
00:33:57,030 --> 00:34:00,010
Thank you for coming to visit me.

444
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,850
Why are you here though?

445
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,659
Everyone is saying...

446
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:20,810
that the empress has gone insane
and the emperor despises me.

447
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,580
It was you who begged him for leniency...

448
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,300
and preserved my last bit of dignity.

449
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:29,830
Why did you do so, though?

450
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:33,170
Have you forgotten how I tortured you?

451
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:36,889
Moreover, you're not a merciful lady...

452
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:40,210
who would treat evil with kindness.

453
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:43,630
Your Majesty.

454
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:46,800
Do you still remember the time...

455
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,130
I fainted when I was still
in Labour House?

456
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:52,810
You sent an imperial physician to save me.

457
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:56,130
Get an imperial physician to check on her.

458
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,450
It was a long time ago.

459
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,450
I've already forgotten it.

460
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:08,210
It's fine.

461
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,730
I remember.

462
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:14,610
From now on,

463
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,780
we don't owe each other anything.

464
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,210
If there's nothing else...

465
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:27,920
I'm very busy.

466
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,060
You always knew that...

467
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:34,210
Yuan Chun Wang would strike, right?

468
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:39,730
With your wit, Consort Ling,

469
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:42,930
you only had one reason
for allowing his wrongdoings.

470
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:45,570
You wanted him to get closer to Prince He.

471
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,170
Consort Ling,

472
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,210
it's been 24 years.

473
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:52,110
For the past 24 years,

474
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:55,170
you've never forgotten
the death of your sister.

475
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:58,080
You wanted Hong Zhou to pay with his life.

476
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,010
You wanted him to lose everything.

477
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:02,210
But you also know...

478
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,470
that His Majesty values brotherhood.

479
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:06,330
He would never kill Hong Zhou.

480
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:10,220
Unless...

481
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,700
Your Majesty.

482
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,960
You think too much.

483
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:18,530
I knew it.

484
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:21,840
The only surprise I had...

485
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:25,170
was that Yuan Chun Wang
wanted to take you down with him,

486
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,330
but unfortunately, he failed too.

487
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,530
I need to leave now.

488
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,370
One last question.

489
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:40,440
I've tried so hard for decades,

490
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,210
but I couldn't win his heart.

491
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:46,530
What did you do to make
His Majesty love you so much?

492
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:50,010
Your Majesty.

493
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,730
You love him so much,

494
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,170
but why must you tell him?

495
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:07,450
The person who speaks first...

496
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,310
is the loser.

497
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,870
How ironic.

498
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:32,210
How ironic.

499
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,730
Prince He.

500
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,580
His Majesty instructed me...

501
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:05,830
to send you off.

502
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:10,730
Thank you.

503
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,540
His Majesty values brotherhood.

504
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:19,490
He allows you to return to your mansion...

505
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:21,800
after drinking this wine.

506
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,210
Looks like...

507
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,980
Brother wants me to die from illness.

508
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:30,970
Prince He.

509
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,940
You may drink.

510
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:37,910
He set up a fool-proof plan...

511
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:43,850
while still pretending
to be friendly with me.

512
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,480
I finally understood...

513
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:55,170
why Grandfather chose him.

514
00:38:58,470 --> 00:38:59,690
He...

515
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:02,370
is indeed...

516
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:06,650
the coldest...

517
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:10,890
and most ruthless person in the world.

518
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:13,840
Fu Hui!

519
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,650
Look what I've brought you!

520
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:18,240
Look! Don't!

521
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,210
Don't snatch it away!

522
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:21,610
Let me play for a while!

523
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,210
Let me play for a while, okay?

524
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,330
He's totally crazy,

525
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,020
but the empress dowager
just won't kill him.

526
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,170
I really don't know why.

527
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:35,730
He keeps claiming to be royalty.

528
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,300
Your Highness, is it true?

529
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:42,520
Father said that I'm a real prince!

530
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,210
Whether it's true or not,

531
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,660
it's not important anymore.

532
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:50,530
He is back to where he belongs.

533
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:52,410
Isn't that good?

534
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:56,650
You hear that?
Father said I can ride a horse.

535
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:58,410
Kneel down!

536
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,970
Kneel down. I want to ride on your back.

537
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:19,520
Greetings, Imperial Noble Consort Ling.

538
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,410
We wish you good fortune and health.

539
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:37,210
How does it feel to become
the imperial noble consort...

540
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:39,090
and see everyone bow to you?

541
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:51,690
Greetings, Your Majesty.

542
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:52,910
Rise.

543
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,930
It's very satisfying.

544
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:13,210
Don't you have anything to say...

545
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:16,210
to the man who gave you such honor?

546
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:18,210
Nothing.

547
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:23,730
You little ingrate.

548
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:25,250
Your Majesty,

549
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,530
if I am an ingrate,

550
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:30,350
then why do you still love me so?

551
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:32,730
I don't have any other choice!

552
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:34,170
Admit it.

553
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,160
Your Majesty has invested
so much time on me.

554
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,870
You don't want to leave empty-handed.

555
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,330
That's why you're miring in this dilemma.

556
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,160
Even if you're gravely sick,

557
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,800
the kingdom still comes first...

558
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,500
because I'm the emperor.

559
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,780
I don't know what love is.

560
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:57,350
Stop overestimating yourself!

561
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:02,220
Fair enough, Your Majesty.

562
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:08,730
Answer my question!

563
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:10,550
If you dare speak nonsense again,

564
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:12,430
I'll really behead you!

565
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:15,450
Your Majesty, you love
the kingdom the most,

566
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:18,890
yet requests me to love you the most.

567
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,770
You're a tyrant!

568
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:23,570
Wei Ying Luo.

569
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:26,530
Your Majesty.

570
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:29,450
Regarding your question,

571
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:32,310
I don't have an answer right now.

572
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:36,050
But I will spend a lifetime answering you.

573
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:39,330
Just be patient and wait!
