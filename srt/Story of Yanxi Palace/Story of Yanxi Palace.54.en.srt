1
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:54,979
Brother.

2
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,180
You don't understand.

3
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,440
I didn't understand before, but I do now.

4
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,260
Yingluo.

5
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,820
I admire that about you the most.

6
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,680
We are the same kind of people.

7
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,660
We are both cold-hearted.

8
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,780
No one can warm us.

9
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,190
What's the silly smile for?

10
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,540
Your Majesty.

11
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,140
What’s this?

12
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,500
Your Majesty, this is…

13
00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:50,980
I can see it from your face

14
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,220
that it’s from someone you like.

15
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,140
But this girl’s needlework

16
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,060
is not good!

17
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,400
Your Majesty, you don't understand.

18
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,200
It shows her heart.

19
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,620
Women tend to

20
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,400
spend time on these small things.

21
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,780
Today she embroiders you a lotus pouch,

22
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,240
tomorrow a handkerchief.

23
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,780
Such a waste of time,

24
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,150
you know.

25
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,840
I think you should stop looking at it,

26
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,860
it won’t become a flower anyway.

27
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,600
What do you want to say?

28
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,860
I just think

29
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,140
that Consort Ling has been acting differently

30
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,850
and she’s been rather distant to you lately.

31
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,850
So you're unhappy and mocking me on purpose.

32
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,700
Am I such a petty-minded person?

33
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,710
I don’t care about it at all!

34
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,230
She likes to be distant,

35
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,740
then let her be.

36
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,940
We'll see how much longer I will put up with her.

37
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,180
Your Majesty,

38
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,710
Consort Ling’s maid Mingyu

39
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,420
brought a hat.

40
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,980
Consort Ling made it personally for you.

41
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,540
See, I told you.

42
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,620
Women are troublesome.

43
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,380
This is?

44
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,020
Consort Ling said

45
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,340
a hat with this material

46
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:36,460
is light and warm if Your Majesty

47
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,540
wear it in the winter.

48
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,980
Your Majesty, it's still hot,

49
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,600
so I'll put it away for now.

50
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,420
When it's winter, I'll get it back out.

51
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,540
You're just the same.

52
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,310
What are you saying?

53
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,460
Your Majesty. I was saying

54
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,940
although Consort Ling seems to be cold,

55
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,180
she deeply cares about you.

56
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,140
The fur you just sent her is sent back to you right away.

57
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,670
This means she's thinking of you all the time.

58
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,600
I didn’t ask her to do such useless thing.

59
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,460
When I go out, I have a bunch of people serve me.

60
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,660
Why would I need this?

61
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,280
It's unnecessary!

62
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,820
It's perfect.

63
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,380
Hu…

64
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,180
Ignore her!

65
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,500
She deserves it.

66
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:53,900
Hupo!

67
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,520
Who told you to bring her here?

68
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,780
Master, she fainted on the side of the road.

69
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,750
She’s from the Slave House.

70
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,900
They should take her back.

71
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,660
When has our Palace become a shelter?

72
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,060
Take her away.

73
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,460
Sister Mingyu.

74
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:31,580
Zhenzhu,

75
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,920
if it weren't on your account,

76
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,200
I wouldn't have brought her back.

77
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:37,740
Hupo.

78
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,390
Since you're awake now,

79
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,100
you should return to where you belong.

80
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,940
Your Highness Consort Ling! Your Highness Consort Ling,

81
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,220
I escaped!

82
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,620
I will be dead if I return!

83
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,060
I beg you, for old time’s sake…

84
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,020
No,

85
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,100
may Your Highness be merciful

86
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,220
and spare me.

87
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,220
Take her away.

88
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,940
Your Highness Consort Ling!

89
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:57,980
I know a secret

90
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,340
that'll be useful to you!

91
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,020
Your Highness, please give me a chance

92
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,860
to make up for my mistake!

93
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,460
A secret that's useful to me?

94
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,100
Yes, if Your Highness will spare me,

95
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,220
I am willing

96
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,100
to tell you everything.

97
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,660
The day when the late Empress passed away,

98
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,260
the Madam of Duke Zhongyong…

99
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:20,860
No,

100
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,460
Erqing met with the late Empress.

101
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,780
Erqing?

102
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,220
Yes.

103
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,620
I overheard their conversation

104
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,900
when I brought tea in.

105
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,820
The mansion just received news.

106
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,140
And Mother fainted from crying.

107
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,700
I really couldn’t

108
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,340
bear to watch.

109
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,740
Tell my mother I am very well.

110
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,580
Don't worry.

111
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,940
Her eyes already have a problem.

112
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,940
Don't let her cry any more.

113
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,500
Erqing, what's wrong?

114
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,260
You’ve been bullied again?

115
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,750
Your Highness the Empress.

116
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,950
There’s a secret I’ve been hidden for so long.

117
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,580
I didn't dare to mention to anyone.

118
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,400
I wanted to repent to Mother at first.

119
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,020
But the Seventh Prince…

120
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:36,419
I saw how sad Mother was.

121
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,720
So I didn’t dare to make the situation worse.

122
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,820
What has happened exactly?

123
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,060
That night.

124
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,750
That night was Second Prince's memorial.

125
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,680
His Majesty stayed at Palace of Eternal Spring.

126
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,420
I was angry at Fuheng

127
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,350
and he wouldn't even listen to you.

128
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,100
So I thought,

129
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,990
this marriage was granted by His Majesty.

130
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,670
As long as His Majesty talks to him,

131
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,300
Fuheng will treat me nicer.

132
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:15,980
So,

133
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,980
I entered the side chamber.

134
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,980
Who knew

135
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,980
that His Majesty was drunk and insisted on favoring me.

136
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,980
I couldn't dare to object.

137
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,740
I was afraid someone would come in,

138
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,700
and ruin Fuca's reputation.

139
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,060
But later I found out that

140
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,980
I am pregnant!

141
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,980
What did you say?

142
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,540
I am pregnant.

143
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,620
Bitch! Bitch!

144
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:24,340
Your Highness, as long as you say the word,

145
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,940
I’m willing to die

146
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,180
to protect Fuca’s reputation!

147
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,100
Reputation?

148
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,180
The Fucas

149
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,860
have no reputation anymore!

150
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,180
It’s you!

151
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,020
It’s all your fault!

152
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:53,460
I never want to see you ever again!

153
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:58,020
Your Highness, I deserve to die,

154
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,140
but this trouble

155
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,260
was started by His Majesty.

156
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,940
You are all

157
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,700
the closest people to me.

158
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,020
Why did you join hands

159
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,420
to treat me like this?

160
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,860
Why?

161
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,680
I will go and apologize to Mother now.

162
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,580
I will let her punish me!

163
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,060
Stop!

164
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,060
What you

165
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,420
told me today

166
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,620
shall not be told

167
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,300
to mother!

168
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:10,900
You

169
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,180
are never allowed

170
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,420
to enter the palace again!

171
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,180
Ever!

172
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,280
Are you telling the truth?

173
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:42,500
I can swear to God that every word is true.

174
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,300
Do you remember that morning

175
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:49,500
you saw me clean up the side chamber?

176
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,020
Hupo.

177
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,120
What are you doing?

178
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,060
Sister Mingyu.

179
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:03,040
Last night, His Majesty was drunk and vomited everywhere.

180
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,550
So that undergarment was hers.

181
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,550
Can’t believe, she…

182
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,180
When I first entered the palace,

183
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,840
I was cared for by Erqing a lot.

184
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:18,060
She at first told me she had an urgent matter

185
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,460
to tell His Majesty.

186
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,620
I was soft-hearted and let her.

187
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,390
I didn’t think such thing would’ve happened.

188
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,780
I was so scared.

189
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,600
I didn't dare to mention it to anyone.

190
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,460
Your Highness Consort Ling,

191
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,620
please spare me on the account that

192
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,040
I told you this secret!

193
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,220
Servants!

194
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,340
Your Highness!

195
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,340
Take her away and lock her up for now.

196
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,020
Without my order,

197
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,540
don't let her meet anyone.

198
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,100
Yes.

199
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,940
Your Highness, you agreed to spare me.

200
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,820
Your Highness, you’ve got to keep your word!

201
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,820
I don’t want to return to

202
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,580
the Slave House again!

203
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,310
Your Highness! Your Highness!

204
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,900
You agreed to spare me! Your Highness!

205
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,180
Your Highness!

206
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,020
Yingluo, someone like her

207
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,670
deserves to be hacked into mincemeat!

208
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,980
The true cause of the disaster

209
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,500
It's Hitara Erqing

210
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,220
I greet Your Highness Consort Ling.

211
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,820
Today, His Majesty summoned the military commanders to a discussion.

212
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,140
He won't be able to come himself,

213
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:58,540
so he had me bring you some delicious dishes.

214
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,700
Wild duck with butter.

215
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,300
Four small appetizers.

216
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,300
Swallow's nest with shredded chicken.

217
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,540
Polished rice.

218
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,020
Your Highness,

219
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,220
His Majesty also send you

220
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,220
that Chef Zhang from Suzhou

221
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,860
you once praised.

222
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,100
He will cook for you in the future.

223
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,320
I thank His Majesty for the grace.

224
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,920
Since the chef and the dishes are delivered,

225
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,030
you can leave now, chamberlain Li.

226
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:52,980
Yes.

227
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,300
Yingluo.

228
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,780
What’s that sound?

229
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,750
I didn’t hear anything!

230
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,470
Take care, Chamberlain Li.

231
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,100
Be careful!

232
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,830
Take them all to Silkworm Hall!

233
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:32,820
Be careful.

234
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,960
That's a gold hook!

235
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,300
Hurry up! Don't miss the auspicious time.

236
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,100
Hurry!

237
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:46,580
Your Majesty, the Silkworm Ceremony is ready.

238
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,620
Tell the Empress I will be there soon.

239
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,220
Yes.

240
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,180
Well…

241
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,020
What's wrong?

242
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,960
Duchess Zhongyong begs an audience.

243
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,700
Fuheng favored a handmaiden,

244
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,860
causing a huge chaos at home.

245
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,300
That handmaiden talked slanderously about me

246
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,360
and even made Fuheng suspect if An’er is really his son.

247
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,620
I was so angry

248
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,300
that I married her off!

249
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,030
Then Fuheng threatened to divorce me.

250
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,900
But how could it possible?!

251
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,220
This marriage was granted by Your Majesty.

252
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,880
He of course can’t divorce me.

253
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,520
Mother wouldn't allow it.

254
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,340
Fuheng took his anger out on me.

255
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,670
He confined me to the Buddhist shrine.

256
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,500
Mother is ill and in bed.

257
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,020
Fuheng just ignores her.

258
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,790
Because of the Silkworm Ceremony,

259
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,670
I finally got a chance to get out

260
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,980
to beg Your Majesty.

261
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,060
Erqing.

262
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,540
Tell me.

263
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,820
Is An’er really…

264
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,220
Though

265
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,820
I sinned before,

266
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,620
it’s all in the past.

267
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,500
I wanted to be a good daughter-in-law

268
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,030
of Fuca with all sincerity.

269
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,820
Fuheng fights in battles all along,

270
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,580
I'm always the one

271
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,460
taking care of the housework

272
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,990
and caring for the parents.

273
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,900
I never made any mistake.

274
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,700
Your Majesty,

275
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,340
I can swear.

276
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,940
Fu Kang'an is Fuheng's son.

277
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,900
He is a child of the Fucas.

278
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,780
But no matter how I explain,

279
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,880
Fuheng just won't believe it.

280
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,340
Fuheng forced my son and I to part,

281
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,800
a pain harsher than death.

282
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,380
Your Majesty,

283
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,220
I know

284
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,060
Your Majesty doesn’t usually care about the subject's family affair.

285
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,660
But this marriage was granted by Your Majesty.

286
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,500
I have no other request,

287
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,300
I just don’t want to

288
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,700
separate with my son.

289
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,700
Don’t take An’er away from me!

290
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,380
Enough.

291
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,580
Say no more.

292
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,180
Your Majesty.

293
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,620
You're angry?

294
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,100
Your Majesty.

295
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,060
Please

296
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,180
help me

297
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,580
for old time’s sake!

298
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,580
Your Majesty.

299
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,260
You and I

300
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,540
had nothing!

301
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,380
I spoke wrong! I spoke wrong!

302
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,560
I spoke without thinking!

303
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,540
I made a mistake!

304
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,780
Your Majesty!

305
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,460
Please understand

306
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,180
a mother’s heart,

307
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,580
don’t let An’er leave me!

308
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,020
Don’t let him leave me!

309
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,180
You may leave now.

310
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,900
Let me think about it!

311
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,220
Thank you, Your Majesty.

312
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,720
Please wait, Duchess Zhongyong.

313
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:01,580
You take Duchess Zhongyong to Silkworm Ceremony.

314
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,320
Show me the way.

315
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:04,860
Yes.

316
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,780
This woman can change her face!

317
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,940
This isn't the way to Silkworm Ceremony.

318
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,830
Where are you taking me?

319
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,540
By Consort Ling's order,

320
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,670
please come with us.

321
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:33,980
Today is Her Highness the Empress' offering

322
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:37,620
for the Silkworm Ceremony.

323
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,060
It's almost time.

324
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,860
I have no time to see her.

325
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,780
Duchess Zhongyong.

326
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,060
Where are you headed off to?

327
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,060
Let me go. Let me go!

328
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,360
Old acquaintances reunited.

329
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,520
It's a blissful event.

330
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,260
But why there’s no

331
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,260
sign of happiness on your face?

332
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,820
Consort Ling.

333
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,260
Today is the Silkworm Ceremony.

334
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,980
What’s your intention to

335
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,190
bring me here at Palace of Eternal Spring?

336
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,300
What do you think?

337
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,460
Now you're His Majesty's favorite consort.

338
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,860
You have a bright future!

339
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,780
I must remind you,

340
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,780
don't forget your status.

341
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,500
If you don't cross me, I won't cross you.

342
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,540
If you push me,

343
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,780
I will not be so kind either.

344
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,100
If your secrets are exposed,

345
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,710
we’ll see whether you’ll still be favored

346
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,500
by His Majesty as before.

347
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,820
Erqing.

348
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,020
Turn around.

349
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,710
Do you still remember the late Master?

350
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:41,820
Mingyu.

351
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,860
Though you are now serving Consort Ling,

352
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:50,180
you shouldn't forget about our old friendship.

353
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,140
Friendship?

354
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:55,510
Just because I valued too much the so called friendship,

355
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,340
You got to use me many times

356
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,280
to harm the previous Empress.

357
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,180
I hate how stupid I was.

358
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,300
I didn't see through your evilness!

359
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,800
I don't know what you mean.

360
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,870
The ceremony is about to begin.

361
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,900
I must leave this place.

362
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,140
Wei Yingluo!

363
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,380
You're holding the wife of a Duke of the First Rank hostage.

364
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,620
What in the world are you trying to do?

365
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,100
What?

366
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:31,660
Are you scared?

367
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,620
What am I scared of?

368
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:39,720
That someone might expose the fact that you betrayed your old Master!

369
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,220
Erqing.

370
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:45,540
The three of us served at Palace of Eternal Spring together.

371
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,300
Have you forgotten

372
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,900
how nicely the late Empress treated us?

373
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:08,900
I didn't forget.

374
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,800
Then how could you do such a thing?

375
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,200
Do you have a heart?

376
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:18,110
Her Highness the Empress committed suicide.

377
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,980
It had nothing to do with me!

378
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,100
Her Highness

379
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,420
had lost her beloved son,

380
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,420
and was in deep sorrow.

381
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,260
You shouldn't have

382
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,660
given her

383
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:42,460
that final heavy blow.

384
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,190
I don't understand.

385
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,900
You served at Palace of Eternal Spring,

386
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,960
and received preferential treatment by Her Highness.

387
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:54,740
You also became the wife of a Duke of the First Rank.

388
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,460
The Empress’s wellbeing

389
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,860
would make sure the wellbeing of Fuca Mansion.

390
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,150
What’s your purpose

391
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,380
of doing that?

392
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,820
What’s my purpose?

393
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,660
What’s my purpose?

394
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:14,940
Wei Yingluo,

395
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:18,140
it’s all because of you!

396
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:22,280
Before you came to Palace of Eternal Spring,

397
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,980
Her Highness valued me the most.

398
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,820
But after you came,

399
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,270
you became Her Highness' confidante.

400
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,660
She totally forgot about me.

401
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,620
So,

402
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:42,660
you alienated us by all means.

403
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:47,820
You instigated Mingyu to go against me.

404
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,900
You hid in the dark

405
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,380
and reaped the benefits.

406
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,860
Erqing.

407
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,100
Even if you envy Yingluo,

408
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,780
you already married to Fuheng.

409
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,420
This was the grace of Her Highness the Empress!

410
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,380
I fought for it!

411
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,620
I told Fuheng

412
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,260
that if he disobeyed His Majesty’s decree,

413
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,260
His Majesty would kill Wei Yingluo.

414
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,100
I worked so hard

415
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,860
to get what I have!

416
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:21,860
Ask her.

417
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:25,700
Ask her if she ever spoke up for me!

418
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,800
But you had already fulfilled your wish.

419
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,150
Wasn't that enough?

420
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,550
It wasn't enough! It will never be enough!

421
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:37,280
I married him. But he regarded me as an ornament.

422
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,700
He was cold toward me and kept his distance from me.

423
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,820
I’ve waited for years,

424
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,220
but ended up like this!

425
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,060
Alright!

426
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,620
I will then let him

427
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,460
live in pain for the rest of his life.

428
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,400
Getting close to His Majesty on purpose.

429
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,220
Is that how you took revenge?

430
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,820
I had His Majesty entirely at my feet,

431
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,500
making Fuheng bear the kind of humiliation

432
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,540
which can never be erased.

433
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,380
I have succeeded!

434
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:21,100
You didn't see his expression then.

435
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,060
All of this

436
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,260
had nothing to do with the late Empress!

437
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,460
But she didn’t help me!

438
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,820
You all forced me!

439
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,620
So,

440
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:39,700
I could only tell the Empress this good news.

441
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,820
She just lost the Seventh Prince.

442
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,420
But I was pregnant with the child of the Emperor.

443
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,380
To her,

444
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,200
it must have been a great comfort.

445
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,540
Lunatic!

446
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,140
You are a lunatic!

447
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,060
I'm a lunatic.

448
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,470
The six years I spent in the Forbidden City

449
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,220
have made me a lunatic!

450
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:07,660
Mingyu.

451
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,430
You and I are both top three banner bondservants,

452
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,220
but our fates were different.

453
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,660
My grandfather was a grand secretary.

454
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,420
Yet your family is nothing.

455
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,420
How could you understand how I feel?

456
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,740
The Empress did treat me well,

457
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,540
but she treated Consort Ling even better.

458
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:35,500
But as long as you exist, I will have hatred!

459
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,140
I will have hatred!

460
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:44,420
So, I wanted to watch the Empress in misery.

461
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,060
I wanted to see her in pain.

462
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:49,100
I wanted to make her go crazy.

463
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:52,060
Such a lofty Master

464
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,740
was tormented by me,

465
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,580
that made me so happy!

466
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,700
Your Majesty.

467
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,720
The Empress sent men to report

468
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,870
that Consort Ling didn't attend the Silkworm Ceremony.

469
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,680
Did you send people

470
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,060
to Palace of Everlasting Joy?

471
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:16,980
I did.

472
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,900
But there was no one there.

473
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,380
I didn’t even see Mingyu.

474
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,270
The Silkworm Ceremony is an important event.

475
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,220
She is absent

476
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,740
and isn’t even at her palace.

477
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,280
Where could she be?

478
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,740
There's something else.

479
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:39,900
What?

480
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:43,720
The wife of Duke Zhongyong of the First Rank is not present either.

481
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,460
Erqing.

482
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:52,020
You used to smile a lot, and you were a warm person.

483
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,260
I can’t believe you’d become like this.

484
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:57,720
I was just a maid in the palace. Why should I be happy about that?

485
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,460
What I hate the most in my life

486
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,340
is smile.

487
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,780
But to entertain the masters,

488
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:11,540
I could only smile. I must smile.

489
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,060
Even when I was suffering

490
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,940
and in pain, I still had to smile.

491
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:19,470
Don’t try to defend your despicable conduct!

492
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,940
The life in the palace

493
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,420
is tough.

494
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,540
Everyone

495
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,740
is struggling.

496
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,880
You are not the only who’s in pain.

497
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,580
You were in pain,

498
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:42,060
but why took it out on the Empress?

499
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,140
She didn’t owe you anything!

500
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,380
Her Highness

501
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,580
treated you very well.

502
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,220
What you repaid her

503
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,620
was a stab in her back.

504
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,460
you are more ruthless

505
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,980
and eviler

506
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,420
than Noble Consort Chun.

507
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:21,500
You told the Empress

508
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,100
about your affair with His Majesty,

509
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,140
giving her a final blow.

510
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,580
So what?

511
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,860
I’m protected by His Majesty.

512
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,940
No one dares to touch me!

513
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,540
Make a choice.

514
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,960
Don't make me take action.

515
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,740
Wei Yingluo, are you crazy?

516
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,300
I'm a titled woman of the Imperial court

517
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,740
and the wife of the Duke of First Rank,

518
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,740
how dare you to execute me in secret?

519
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,740
Make your choice.

520
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,110
Respectfully greeting Your Majesty!

521
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,620
Wei Yingluo, how dare you to…

522
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,750
Why wouldn't I dare?

523
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:01,540
Hitara Erqing is a titled woman in the Imperial court

524
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,340
and the wife of the Duke of First Rank!

525
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:06,140
Your Majesty. I poisoned the wife of the Duke of First Rank.

526
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,620
It has nothing to do with Consort Ling!

527
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,100
You are from Palace of Everlasting Joy.

528
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:12,699
You killing her has no difference from Consort Ling killing her.

529
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,300
Erqing

530
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:19,219
confessed her affair with Your Majesty

531
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,380
on the day that

532
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,960
the late Empress passed away.

533
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:34,380
It’s the reason that caused the Empress lost her hope and killed herself.

534
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,139
So,

535
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,659
she must die!

536
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,580
Wei Yingluo,

537
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,860
it's not like what you think.

538
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,460
Your Majesty, tell me then.

539
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:53,380
What's the truth?

540
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,380
It's because…

541
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,219
Your Majesty,

542
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,540
the Empress is here.

543
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:05,700
Consort Ling, what did you do?

544
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,620
Empress.

545
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:15,220
The wife of Duke Zhongyong of the First Rank came to commemorate the late Empress.

546
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:17,340
She was extremely sad

547
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:21,420
and followed the late Empress’ path.

548
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,380
Your Majesty. Are you saying

549
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,640
that the wife of the Duke killed herself?

550
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,740
But how come Consort Ling is here?

551
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,660
When I rushed here,

552
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,550
Consort Ling had just arrived.

553
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:43,340
Consort Ling, is this the truth?

554
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:48,900
Empress, you don’t believe me?

555
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,180
Of course, I trust Your Majesty,

556
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,820
but there were hundreds of noble wives and women with titles

557
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,480
who entered the palace today.

558
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:00,700
Everyone saw Erqing smiling and entering the palace.

559
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,180
If it's said that she commemorated and followed the late Empress,

560
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,910
I fear this is not appropriate.

561
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,900
Why not let me handle this?

562
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:13,380
Empress, how do you plan to handle this?

563
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,700
Zhen'er.

564
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,340
I'm here.

565
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,900
Take some people

566
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,740
to clean up the body of the wife of Duke Zhongyong.

567
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,140
Don't leave any signs.

568
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,700
Just tell the others that she was suddenly summoned by Empress Dowager

569
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,900
and said a few words.

570
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,580
Then she rushed out of the celebration,

571
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,820
realizing that she missed the auspicious time.

572
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,220
After everyone had left,

573
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,980
a small sedan took her back to the Fuca mansion.

574
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,300
She was struck with a disease on the way.

575
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:44,640
Embargo the news. Issue the obituary seven days later.

576
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:48,340
But I need Fuca Mansion to cooperate with us.

577
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,540
I’ll send someone

578
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,580
to persuade Old Madam Fuca.

579
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,900
As for Consort Ling,

580
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,580
we’ll tell people…

581
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,020
That she is sick!

582
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:07,660
Your Majesty,

583
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,420
Am I sick?

584
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,220
You are!

585
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,700
Quite serious too!

586
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,380
So,

587
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,420
just go back to your palace

588
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,580
and summon the Imperial Doctor to treat you!

589
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,680
I will comply with your order.

590
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:54,180
Consort Ling, you were too reckless.

591
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:57,200
She was the wife of Duke Zhongyong of the First Rank.

592
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,900
How could you kill her

593
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,220
without even asking His Majesty?

594
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:09,700
Hitara Erqing was His Majesty's lover.

595
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:13,190
Would His Majesty bear to kill her?

596
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,900
In terms of your decisiveness to kill,

597
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,380
I do admire you.

598
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,420
It's a pity that just because of

599
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,300
Hitara Erqing,

600
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,140
you will lose His Majesty’s favor.

601
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,420
Is it worth it?

602
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:29,750
When I mentioned

603
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,900
that Hitara Erqing was His Majesty’s lover,

604
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:39,380
Your Highness was not surprised at all.

605
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:42,180
Did you know that already?

606
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,700
Even if you know,

607
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,100
you should pretend that you don’t know.

608
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,420
That’s how you live a longer life in the palace.

609
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:54,550
That’s how you can be the last one standing and laughing.

610
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:01,300
Consort Ling, you must remember

611
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,340
my warning to you today.

612
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:04,900
So, it was you.

613
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,430
What are you talking about?

614
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:13,660
The one who sent Hupo to me

615
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:16,900
was you!

616
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:25,060
I don't understand what you are saying.

617
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:29,580
Before Hupo told me,

618
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,420
I believe that

619
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,820
you’d already heard the truth

620
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:36,980
from her.

621
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:43,620
Thus, you deliberately sent Erqing to me

622
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,590
and you were certain

623
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,060
that I must kill Erqing.

624
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,580
Empress,

625
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,100
I’m impressed by

626
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:02,340
your trick of killing someone with a borrowed knife.

627
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:03,580
Whose knife did I borrow?

628
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,620
Mine!

629
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,340
Who was killed?

630
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,580
Hitara Erqing.

631
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:18,260
And you also took away His Majesty’s favor from me.

632
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:23,420
His Majesty said that you are sick. I didn't believe it.

633
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:26,460
But now I see that you are really sick!

634
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,180
Go back and rest.

635
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,020
Yingluo.

636
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,340
Did we fall into her trap?

637
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:50,860
Mingyu.

638
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:55,020
Do you regret

639
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,240
that you killed Erqing in person?

640
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,580
No.

641
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,900
I don’t!

642
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,180
She deserved it!

643
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:13,660
That’s why the Empress has outsmarted us.

644
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,780
She figured out every step we’d go,

645
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,460
having us willingly

646
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,220
fall into her trap.

647
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,140
Your Majesty,

648
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,820
it's past the meal hour.

649
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,260
Your Majesty.

650
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,140
What are you doing here?

651
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:13,340
I…

652
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:17,340
Since I left the palace,

653
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,060
I’ve suffered a lot from

654
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,750
Fuheng’s coldness and indifference.

655
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:27,380
I wanted to talk to the Empress and find some comfort.

656
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:29,980
But Her Highness is pregnant,

657
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,220
so I dared not disturb her.

658
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:34,740
I thus came to Your Majesty to seek help.

659
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:37,980
But,

660
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:42,820
Your Majesty was drunk last night.

661
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,540
I know I’ve sinned.

662
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:48,460
I’m willing to die for my sin.

663
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:51,140
But Your Majesty, I beg you.

664
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,300
I beg Your Majesty

665
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,380
to spare my family.

666
00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:02,420
I'm willing to be a slave to repay Your Majesty's grace in the next life.

667
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:11,580
If you died here at Palace of Eternal Spring,

668
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:13,580
you would be insulting the Empress!

669
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:15,740
Your Majesty!

670
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:16,780
Get out!

671
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:41,740
I heard the best items were sent to Palace of Everlasting Joy.

672
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:43,200
His Majesty is too biased.

673
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:46,500
Just some insignificant stuff after all.

674
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:49,320
This represents His Majesty's grace

675
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:51,020
and the dignity of the harem.

676
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:54,860
Before, the best fur from Kyakhta

677
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:57,300
were all sent to our palace

678
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,140
and distributed by Your Highness.

679
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,340
But now it’s changed.

680
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:04,860
However, Consort Ling killed the wife of Duke Zhongyong.

681
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:07,240
She seriously offended His Majesty.

682
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:10,140
Would she completely lose favor from now on?
