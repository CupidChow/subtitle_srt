3
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,920
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

4
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:06,440
May you live a long life of good fortune.

5
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,729
Isn't this girl...

6
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,180
You are already inside the hall.
Remove the silk cloth now.

7
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,110
-Yes.
-A gift from His Majesty.

8
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,360
Rise!

9
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,090
Greetings, Your Majesty. May you
be blessed with long life and good health!

10
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,060
Eunuch Li, you may rise now.

11
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,500
Your Majesty,

12
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,460
His Majesty has instructed me
to deliver your birthday gifts for you.

13
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,040
I thank His Majesty for his grace.

14
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,390
All the other consorts and concubines,
you may rise.

15
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,670
My fellow sisters, please be at ease.

16
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,300
Have a seat.

17
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,560
Your Majesty,

18
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,600
other than the usual gold,
silver and silk fabrics,

19
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,210
His Majesty has specially prepared
a gift for you this year.

20
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,160
This is...

21
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,470
Is this a clock?

22
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,540
Your Majesty,
in order to give you this surprise,

23
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,550
he had instructed the Clock Workshop
to work on it early on.

24
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:49,950
They put in a lot of effort
to make you a birthday clock.

25
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:55,260
But His Majesty said that in Qing Dynasty,
a clock is inappropriate as birthday gift.

26
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,200
Hence, he ordered them to remodel it.

27
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,560
Look. This is a make-up box.

28
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,240
And this small box on top can
announce the time accurately.

29
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,310
Your Majesty,
I've caught a cold last night.

30
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,000
I lost my appetite. So, I can't
attend your birthday banquet.

31
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,400
Please forgive me.

32
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,269
Your Majesty, Yong Cheng
has been sick lately.

33
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,450
So, I will take my leave now.

34
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,960
I wish you a long and peaceful life.

35
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,000
Your Majesty, I have to
get back to His Majesty.

36
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,600
So, I will take my leave now too.

37
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,040
Li Yu, I will personally go
and thank him later.

38
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

39
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:00,720
The one from the Embroidery House,
hurry up and remove the cloth.

40
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,150
Alright.

41
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,750
This doesn't look like
gold thread or silver thread.

42
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,330
And it's even more different than
a peacock feather thread.

43
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,730
You are right. It looks like...

44
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,880
This is thread made from animal fur.

45
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,020
How dare you!

46
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,930
How dare you give such a crudely-made
robe to ridicule Her Majesty!

47
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:49,110
-I dare not do that.
-You dare not do that?

48
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,200
What is this then? Do you want to die?

49
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,260
What did you use to embroider this?

50
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,880
Your Majesty,

51
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,240
in the past, we would use gold, silver...

52
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,920
or peacock feather thread to embroider it.

53
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:16,140
This year, we purposely used fine thread
made from the fur of a deer's tail.

54
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,690
Why did the Embroidery House
choose to use this kind of thread?

55
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,000
I heard that Your Majesty
has always been frugal.

56
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,800
You once said that gold and silver threads
are extravagant and wasteful.

57
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,320
Before the founding day of our ancestors
from Qing Dynasty,

58
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:38,420
all of their clothes and accessories
were sewn using deer tail fur thread.

59
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:42,510
That's why I boldly gave up
the gold and silver threads this time...

60
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,080
and followed the old custom.

61
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,980
Besides being in compliance with
your wish to promote frugality,

62
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:53,100
it can remind everyone about the hardships
that our ancestors had gone through.

63
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:58,420
I never thought that a small palace maid
can be so eloquent.

64
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,840
That's right.
What she said is quite reasonable.

65
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,640
Reasonable?

66
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,430
Your Majesty, you mustn't be fooled
by her sweet talk.

67
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,740
I think that there must be
another reason behind this.

68
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,330
What other reason can there be?

69
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:28,470
This little palace maid is just ingenious.

70
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,420
Now, more and more people in the palace
are indulging in extravagant lifestyle.

71
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,360
If everyone can remember the hardships
that our ancestors had gone through,

72
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,640
we should abandon our luxurious lifestyle
and live frugally instead.

73
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:46,250
Guards, reward her!

74
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,520
What did Ying Luo say?

75
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,840
Not only we aren't punished,
we are even rewarded.

76
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,830
Where is Ying Luo? Why isn't she back yet?

77
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:05,310
She is rewarded. Of course she has to
express her gratefulness to Her Majesty.

78
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,720
Everyone else has already left.

79
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,960
Why are you still kneeling here?

80
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,040
Your Majesty, I am here to apologise
and ask for punishment.

81
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,200
What had you done wrong?

82
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,340
Actually, the Embroidery House
lost the peacock feather thread.

83
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,520
So, I had no choice but to substitute it
with deer tail fur thread.

84
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,790
Earlier, I made up a speech in order to
get away with it in the hall just now.

85
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,730
I know.

86
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,760
Every year, the Embroidery House
will give me a set of court dress.

87
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,900
But they never used
this kind of thread before.

88
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,710
I did not expose you just now...

89
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,500
because it is my birthday today.

90
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,240
I do not wish for anything unpleasant
to happen. Do you understand?

91
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,640
Your Majesty is indeed benevolent.
I will forever remember it in my heart.

92
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,470
Er Qing said that you were stalling
for time when you waited outside the hall.

93
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,720
What were you waiting for?

94
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:11,670
I'll only have the courage to tell you
about it if you promise not to punish me.

95
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,580
I'll pardon you for your crime.
Tell me now.

96
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,600
You are highly-favoured by His Majesty.

97
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,520
So, I guessed that His Majesty
will surely send some gifts for you today.

98
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,310
Hence, I kept waiting.

99
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,700
I wanted to take advantage of the fact
that His Majesty would make you happy.

100
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,980
By doing so, you wouldn't be as furious...

101
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,580
when I went in to
present the gifts to you.

102
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,850
How dare you!

103
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,990
I have already prepared myself.

104
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,810
If you want to punish someone,
please just punish me.

105
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,800
Don't drag those innocent people
in the Embroidery House into this.

106
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,130
-Are you not afraid of death?
-I am afraid.

107
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,960
But I know that fear
will be of no help at all.

108
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,140
You wield absolute power over my life.

109
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,280
You are really bold. How dare you
take advantage of His Majesty.

110
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,600
Please forgive me.

111
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,820
You want to use His Majesty's gifts
to make me happy...

112
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:14,280
so that you can use that opportunity
to absolve yourself from your crime.

113
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,990
This palace maid is really cunning.

114
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,610
If His Majesty learns of this,
he will be furious.

115
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:29,910
But I still have to punish you
for losing the peacock feather thread.

116
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,110
Your punishment is to make me
another casual dress...

117
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,760
using deer tail fur thread.

118
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,860
Did you get it?

119
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,840
Yes, Your Majesty.

120
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,110
-Er Qing.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

121
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,910
I have never seen such
a cunning palace maid.

122
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,230
If you like her,

123
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,930
you can transfer her to Changchun Palace
to cheer you up.

124
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,910
I like her quite a bit.

125
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I can transfer her here
once she is done with my casual dress.

126
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:23,090
But Wu Shu Lai
has to be held responsible...

127
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,030
for this sudden thievery in the palace.

128
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,340
Order him to investigate this matter.

129
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,740
Yes, Your Majesty.

130
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,170
Ying Luo, you are so fortunate and bold.

131
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,750
You actually dared to
say those words to Her Majesty.

132
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,620
If I were you, my knees
would have buckled in fear.

133
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:46,730
Ji Xiang, from now on,
you have to be meticulous with your task.

134
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,780
You can't make any more mistakes.

135
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:53,820
Alright. Ying Luo,
I have a question for you.

136
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,770
Ask away.

137
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,330
Why did you have to tell
Her Majesty the truth?

138
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,300
Telling her the truth myself is better
than her knowing it from someone else.

139
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,300
But I still think that
it was really a risky move.

140
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,040
If Her Majesty is really
a magnanimous and gentle empress...

141
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:18,020
just like what Madam Zhang said,

142
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,730
I will have a chance of survival.

143
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,440
Moreover, as long as you can
handle all kinds of crises properly,

144
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,040
you can turn them into
opportunities instead.

145
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,920
Her Majesty is intelligent and wise.

146
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:35,470
By admitting my mistakes and exposing
all of my childish thoughts to her,

147
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,160
I may win her favour.

148
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,800
Ying Luo, what are you planning?

149
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,230
I want to go to Changchun Palace.

150
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,190
Why do you want to go there?

151
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:52,610
Imperial Guard Fuca is
Her Majesty's younger brother.

152
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,480
If I go to Changchun Palace,

153
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,790
we'll be able to cross path frequently.

154
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,120
What? Ying Luo,

155
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:04,090
didn't you say that you are not
interested in climbing the social ladder?

156
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:07,370
So, I was lying to you just now.

157
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,900
Dummy!

158
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,060
How could you lie to me?

159
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,940
Have you heard? Her Majesty
has taken a liking to Ying Luo.

160
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:22,950
Chief Wu even ordered Madam Zhang
to transfer Ying Luo to Changchun Palace.

161
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,620
Really? She will be attending Her Majesty?

162
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,640
She is so fortunate.

163
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,020
Although I envy her,

164
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,200
I am not as daring as her
to spout nonsense in the main hall.

165
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,390
But no matter what,
this is a blessing in disguise for her.

166
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:43,950
Anyhow, Ling Long, I feel so bad for you.

167
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,080
-Why do you have to feel bad for me?
-Of course I feel bad for you.

168
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,440
In terms of appearance
and embroidery skills,

169
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,040
you are not inferior to her.

170
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,130
But Madam Zhang is too biased.

171
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,880
If you were the one who sent the gifts,
the person going to Changchun Palace...

172
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,230
wouldn't be Wei Ying Luo!

173
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,530
Actually, it's also good that
she'll be leaving.

174
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:07,460
From now on, it's time for
Sister Ling Long to shine.

175
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,220
Yes. The Embroidery House will be
relying on Ling Long from now on.

176
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,880
This fabric is so smooth and silky.
It's softer than my hands.

177
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,850
Of course. They are tributes from
the weaving factory in Southern Rivers.

178
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:21,570
Ying Luo is so fortunate.

179
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,400
-Let me touch them too.
-Me too. I want to share her luck.

180
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,240
[I have to catch that thief
before I leave this Embroidery House.]

181
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,200
Stop touching them.

182
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,080
These are gifts bestowed by Her Majesty.

183
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:38,550
If they are soiled, I'll be punished
for disrespecting my mistress.

184
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,210
-Don't damage it.
-You are so petty.

185
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,200
That's right.

186
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,080
Ying Luo is right.

187
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,530
The gifts bestowed by our mistress
should be treasured and kept well.

188
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:53,060
-Ying Luo, let me keep them for you.
-Make sure to keep them well.

189
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,740
Ling Long, you must be the one who
stole the peacock feather thread, right?

190
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,300
Ying Luo, what are you talking about?

191
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,980
First, the person who had the chance
to use the charcoal brazier...

192
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,470
to cause a commotion
must be a palace maid.

193
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,480
Second, she deliberately avoided the time
when I was guarding the thread...

194
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,560
and chose to make her move when
Ji Xiang was the one keeping watch.

195
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,200
This person must be someone
who knows our temperaments very well.

196
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,240
Third, if the Embroidery House is unable
to offer gifts, we will be punished.

197
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,280
So, this person must have
hated me a lot for her to risk it.

198
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,320
If she fails the first time,
she will do it again.

199
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,940
That's why I purposely said that
I want to put away the gifts to bait you.

200
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,310
Ying Luo, I...

201
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,130
It's just that I've never seen
such beautiful gifts before.

202
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,180
I know that you've never liked me.

203
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,520
So, I can only touch them during
the night when no one is watching.

204
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,560
How could you say that I'm a thief?

205
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,090
So, it's not you?

206
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,440
-It's not me.
-Who could it be then?

207
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,260
It's really not me.

208
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,640
Come with me and
explain it to Madam Zhang.

209
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,310
Ying Luo!

210
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,910
Since young, no one has ever
falsely accused me like this.

211
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,880
I did not do anything.

212
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,270
But you keep saying that I'm a thief.

213
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,320
Fine.

214
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,560
I'll die to prove my innocence then!

215
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:56,480
I really didn't do it.
You have to believe me.

216
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,480
I really didn't do it.

217
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,120
Ying Luo, this is too much.

218
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:04,589
Ling Long just wanted to touch them.
Is that a heinous crime?

219
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,599
How could you bully her like this?

220
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:09,599
What rights do you have to accuse her?
What evidence do you have?

221
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,910
Ying Luo, just drop it.

222
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,640
I don't think Ling Long was the thief.

223
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:19,720
Maybe, this is really
just a misunderstanding.

224
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:28,130
Ling Long, God is always watching.

225
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,980
I hope that you are truly innocent.

226
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,840
Chief Wu, Madam Zhang.

227
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,190
Where is Chief Wu going?
Why is he in such a rush?

228
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,370
I heard that Chief Wu and Madam Zhang...

229
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:51,170
are looking for
the peacock feather thread thief.

230
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,770
-Will they be able to catch that thief?
-Hard to say.

231
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,440
This is a decree from Her Majesty.

232
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,880
Chief Wu will not stop until
he catches the thief.

233
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,680
Ying Luo, where did you get these noodles?

234
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,920
I exchanged for them in the kitchen
with some embroidered items.

235
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,360
But how did you know that
it is my birthday today?

236
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:17,440
On the day we entered the palace,
the eunuch in charge mentioned it...

237
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,640
when he was verifying
the name-list, right?

238
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,960
You remember it since then?

239
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:24,460
That time, you were
standing right beside me.

240
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:27,980
He had to repeat it thrice.
How could I forget?

241
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,800
Ying Luo, you are really good to me.

242
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:40,050
After you go to Changchun Palace,
I won't be able to see you every day.

243
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:44,110
I will definitely miss you a lot.

244
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,310
Ji Xiang, you need
to be smart in the palace.

245
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,370
Come to me if you have any problems.

246
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,120
Remember, you must always be cautious.

247
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,750
Alright.

248
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,840
What's wrong?

249
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,560
In the past, only my grandmother
would care for me like this.

250
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,520
I miss her.

251
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,190
I also miss my sister a lot.

252
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,010
You have a sister?

253
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,820
Why haven't you mentioned her before?

254
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,160
She is no longer in this world.

255
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,450
Ying Luo, I'm sorry.

256
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,210
It's alright.

257
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:35,240
No matter where I go, I can feel that
my sister is accompanying me.

258
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:42,200
If that's the case, let's take care of
each other from now on like real sisters.

259
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:45,370
Okay. Let's take care of each other.

260
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:48,540
Here.

261
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,270
This silk handkerchief is for you.

262
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:57,410
Ji Xiang, I wish you
many more birthdays to come.

263
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,390
Thank you.

264
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,840
This is so beautiful. I will cherish it.

265
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,060
Hurry up and eat your noodles now.

266
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,580
I have to get back to work.
I'll get going now.

267
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,250
-Okay. Go now.
- Hurry up and eat your noodles.

268
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:45,460
Ji Xiang, do you really hate me right now?

269
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,800
Before we entered the palace,
we were very close.

270
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:53,250
But after entering the palace,
we've grown apart.

271
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,490
I know that you dislike me
for always targeting Ying Luo, but...

272
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:03,270
But you have to step into my shoes too.
I worked so hard.

273
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,720
And my embroidery skills are not inferior
to hers. But Madam is so biased. I...

274
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,300
Of course I'll be jealous of her.

275
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:14,200
But that is not a reason for you
to keep on targeting her.

276
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:19,250
I see my mistakes now.

277
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:23,110
Ying Luo hates me
and you blame me and ignore me.

278
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:25,550
I really regret my actions.

279
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:30,200
Ji Xiang, your stepmother was
very harsh towards you in the past.

280
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,920
And my mother and I would
invite you over to eat with us.

281
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,480
We are like sisters since young.

282
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,360
Even if I really did something wrong,
can't you forgive me?

283
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:50,040
Ling Long, can you promise that
you won't do anything bad anymore?

284
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,690
Yes. I swear that
if I still have any evil thoughts,

285
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,160
God will punish me to have a tragic death.

286
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,200
Don't say that. You'll break a taboo.

287
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,650
Ji Xiang, do you forgive me now?

288
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,220
Yes.

289
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,720
By the way, it's your birthday today.
I have a gift for you.

290
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,280
Really? Where is it?

291
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,720
Why is she being so mysterious?

292
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,550
What gift does Ling Long want to give me?

293
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:35,270
Ji Xiang. What are you doing?

294
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,000
Chief Wu, Madam Zhang, why are you here?

295
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:43,550
I was wondering why
we couldn't catch the thief.

296
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:46,180
Can that person fly or go underground?

297
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,840
So, the thief is hiding in plain sight.

298
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:53,360
A useless embroidery maid like you
is trying to fool us all?

299
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,700
Chief Wu, what are you talking about?

300
00:22:56,810 --> 00:23:00,940
What am I talking about? Just open it
and everything will be crystal clear.

301
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,260
How did this happen?

302
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,520
Aren't you the one who stole them?

303
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,060
No, Chief Wu! I didn't steal them!

304
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,280
No thieves will admit to their crimes.

305
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,400
It's Ling Long.

306
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,400
She said that she wants to give me
a birthday gift. That's why...

307
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,840
Shut up!

308
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,580
No need to listen to her nonsense.
Take her away.

309
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,970
Chief Wu, I really didn't steal them!

310
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,690
-I didn't steal them!
-Ji Xiang.

311
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:36,750
Madam Zhang, I didn't steal them!

312
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:39,110
Madam Zhang, you have to believe me!

313
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,720
-Ji Xiang!
-Madam Zhang, I really didn't steal them.

314
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,820
Chief Wu, Ji Xiang is an honest girl.

315
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,170
She won't do this kind of thing.

316
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,650
This must be a misunderstanding.

317
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,870
How about you investigate it further?

318
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,790
She is caught red-handed.
Why do I need to further investigate it?

319
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:59,520
Moreover, Her Majesty gave me
two days to catch the culprit.

320
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,740
Now that we've caught the thief,
our task is done now.

321
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:08,650
Madam Zhang, don't cause any
unnecessary trouble. Understand?

322
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:15,920
Chief Wu, how will you punish her?

323
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:19,180
She stole the peacock feather thread.

324
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,780
Of course she has to be caned to death.

325
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:18,150
[This is so beautiful. I will cherish it.]

326
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:33,470
Ling Long, stop crying.
Your eyes are already swollen.

327
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,300
I grew up with Ji Xiang since young.

328
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,640
I really couldn't believe that
she's that kind of person.

329
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,320
Something must have gone wrong.

330
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:04,470
Look. Her best friend is gone
and she didn't even shed a tear for her.

331
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:09,390
As the saying goes, only time will tell.

332
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,980
Now, we can finally see
who is the real friend here.

333
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,220
Even if Ji Xiang made a mistake,
she was very kind to her.

334
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,680
Whenever she was late, Ji Xiang
would save some of her food for her.

335
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:23,530
But now, she is so cold-hearted
towards Ji Xiang.

336
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:28,130
That's right. I never thought that
she's a person like this.

337
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,740
Ying Luo, look at this.
How did you embroider this dress?

338
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,980
The sewing method and
color combination are all wrong.

339
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,690
I'm sorry, Madam. I'll redo it.

340
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:49,880
Do you know what kind of fabric is this?
Do you think you can just redo it?

341
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:53,070
You've disappointed me!

342
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,810
Madam, Ying Luo has been
doing too much work lately.

343
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:59,520
She must be too exhausted.
That's why she made a mistake.

344
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,950
Madam, you are magnanimous.
Please forgive her.

345
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,560
If you have any tasks,
you can hand them over to me.

346
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:09,630
Ling Long, she always treats you so badly.
Why are you still helping her?

347
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,740
We entered the palace together.

348
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,970
It's only right for us
to help each other out.

349
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:17,250
To err is human.
Shouldn't we help each other out?

350
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,640
Enough. Ying Luo.

351
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,060
Redo this with care.

352
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,180
If this happens again,
I won't be as forgiving.

353
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,290
Yes, Madam Zhang.

354
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:30,320
Ying Luo, let me help you.

355
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,310
I don't need your help.

356
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:50,800
Why are you so careless?

357
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:52,500
Go away!

358
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,740
Ying Luo, all of them
said that you are heartless.

359
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,000
But I know that you are
very upset about Ji Xiang's death.

360
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:03,110
Ji Xiang is not the thief.

361
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:12,660
I don't want to believe it too,
but it's the truth.

362
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,420
Tell me then.

363
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,330
Why would Ji Xiang steal
the peacock feather thread?

364
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,600
Ji Xiang lost her mother when she was
very young and her father remarried again.

365
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,040
She was raised by her grandmother alone.

366
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:31,550
Her grandmother had gotten
very sick a while back.

367
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,560
I guess she was trying to get more money
to pay for the medical fees.

368
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:39,020
Act. Continue to act.

369
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,730
I won't believe a word you say.

370
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,490
Sooner or later, I will find the culprit
who framed Ji Xiang and clear her name.

371
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,070
Just you wait.

372
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:04,840
The embroidery maid in charge of
His Majesty's casual clothing is sick.

373
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,440
She still has a project
that is not done yet.

374
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,100
Now, we need to find someone
to help her...

375
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,300
finish the rest of her project.

376
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,010
Madam, can I do it?

377
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,090
Madam, let me do it!

378
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:22,120
Madam, hand over the task to me.

379
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:24,080
If I give it to you, can you do it?

380
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,040
Casual clothing is easier than
imperial robes and court dresses.

381
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:30,080
Moreover, my embroidery skills
have improved a lot recently.

382
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,120
I can do it for sure.

383
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:38,120
Madam Zhang, this kind of tasks
are usually given to me.

384
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,020
-Ying Luo.
-The quality of an embroidery work...

385
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:43,090
depends on the embroiderer's skills.

386
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:44,910
Since you want to do it so badly,

387
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,080
why don't we have a competition?

388
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,180
Let's see who can do it better.

389
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,960
Ying Luo, I never thought that...

390
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,880
you'll have such
a deep prejudice against me.

391
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:02,290
Just tell me if you dare
to compete or not.

392
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,920
-Ling Long, compete with her!
-That's right. What's so good about her?

393
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,920
-Ling Long, compete with her.
-Ying Luo, all the best.

394
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,050
-Ying Luo, we support you.
-Ling Long, we support you.

395
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:20,360
Fine. If you want to compete,
I will keep you company then.

396
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:22,880
Okay then. I'll give you three days' time.

397
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,240
When the time comes, I will only look at
the result and choose the best one.

398
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:15,770
Your stitches are so pretty and
the edges are so clean too.

399
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,160
I am just halfway done.

400
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:21,270
Do you think you can win me
with just this?

401
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,940
Ying Luo, how could you talk like this?

402
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:30,500
The crucial part is the finishing touch.
The eyes of the dragon matter the most.

403
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,520
The dragon needs to look lifelike.

404
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:37,190
Will you be able to embroider that?

405
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,790
Ling Long is not finished yet.
How do you know that she can't do it?

406
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:43,930
Fine. We shall see then.

407
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,510
Ying Luo is still not back?

408
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,320
-She's really something.
-Usually,

409
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,160
we just embroider the spring clothing
of other servants.

410
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,560
At most, the consorts
and concubines' dresses.

411
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,880
When have we ever taken any tasks
from Yangxin Palace?

412
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,230
Only the best embroiderers
can attend to that task.

413
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:24,800
She's really bent on defeating Ling Long.

414
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,700
Ling Long, you've embroidered
the dragon so well.

415
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,940
So magnificent and lifelike.

416
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:12,400
That's right. You are
getting better and better now.

417
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,150
When will you teach us?

418
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,280
I'm just doing my best here.

419
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,980
Ling Long!

420
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:21,260
Where is the robe I made?

421
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,699
What are you saying?

422
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:28,630
When I wake up today, I realised that
my robe has been switched.

423
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:31,770
This is not the robe I embroidered!

424
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,000
Ying Luo, I'm confused.

425
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,639
This...

426
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:42,400
If this is not the robe you made,
who made it then?

427
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,400
Wei Ying Luo, Ling Long has already
submitted her work to Madam Zhang.

428
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,840
She is very satisfied with it and had it
delivered to Yangxin Palace at once.

429
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,909
You lost, just accept it.

430
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,480
That's right. You are always so out of it.

431
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,840
You can't finish your work and yet
you want to blame it on her.

432
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,400
Ling Long.

433
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,860
Can you swear to God that...

434
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,120
the casual robe you submitted to
Madam Zhang is personally made by you?

435
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:10,910
I swear to God that
I'm the one who made that robe.

436
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,710
Good.

437
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,660
Ling Long, don't mind her.
She's just jealous.

438
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,280
Why couldn't I find her?

439
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,630
De Sheng.

440
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,680
Can that palace maid
fly or go underground?

441
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:29,530
You are really funny, Chief Li.

442
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:32,510
No one in this world
can fly or go underground.

443
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,360
Why couldn't I find her then?

444
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,210
There are too many people
in the Forbidden City.

445
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:39,360
It's normal that you couldn't find her.

446
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,940
Nonsense!

447
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,680
At first, I thought that this is
a chance for me to gain merits.

448
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,320
But not only my effort is wasted,
I'm doomed now.

449
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,970
This is a letter from Zhong Yong Tan.
Read it yourself.

450
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,440
[I heard that Oshan frequently
receives bribes from the people.]

451
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,440
[Even Zhang Ting Yu
is involved in it as well.]

452
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,710
Your Majesty, this is an impeachment from
Zhong Yong Tan against Commander Oshan...

453
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:08,040
for receiving a bribe
of ten thousand silver.

454
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,880
Not only Oshan,

455
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,600
this is also an impeachment
against Zhang Ting Yu.

456
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:16,760
Did you not sense anything?

457
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:21,450
Zhong Yong Tan is Ortai's disciple.

458
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,300
Yes. So, this impeachment letter...

459
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,700
is Ortai's declaration of war
against Zhang Ting Yu.

460
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,600
And he even wants to use me as his sword.

461
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,200
Zhang Ting Yu and Ortai are both...

462
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,800
important subjects of the late emperor.
We can't handle this matter hastily.

463
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,420
I tolerated them so much
because they were...

464
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,760
the right-hand men of the late emperor.

465
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,780
But what did they do?

466
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,750
Last year, Liu Tong Xun filed
an impeachment against Zhang Ting Yu...

467
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:59,950
for monopolizing Tong City
with the Zhang family...

468
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,390
where most of the officials
are from their families.

469
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:04,520
I thought that it was an exaggeration.

470
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:06,570
But from the looks of it now,

471
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,870
what he said was extremely accurate.

472
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,840
As for Ortai,

473
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,680
the wife of his second son, Oshi,
just passed away recently...

474
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:19,790
and he immediately married the daughter
of Grand Secretary Gao Bin...

475
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:22,120
to establish ties with Noble Consort Gao.

476
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:24,800
Tell me, what does he want?

477
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:29,050
Your Majesty, the Han people are now
attached to Zhang Ting Yu...

478
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,200
while the Manchurians
are siding with Ortai.

479
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,210
Not only the officials
in the imperial court,

480
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:35,640
even the local governors
are choosing sides.

481
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,880
To suppress Ortai and Zhang Ting Yu,
we must wait for the right time.

482
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,530
I've waited long enough!

483
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,170
-Your Majesty! Calm down.
-Your Majesty.

484
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,560
We have to catch the snake by its head.

485
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,370
I'm going to summon Prince Yi, Prince He,

486
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,340
Grand Secretary Ortai,
Zhang Ting Yu, Xu Ben,

487
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,230
and Minister Ne Qin
to sit in a public trial.

488
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,040
I'll kill Oshan first.

489
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,200
Your Majesty.

490
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,240
Your Majesty, what's wrong?

491
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,340
Your Majesty, please forgive me!

492
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,480
What is this?

493
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:25,080
Your Majesty, this must be a negligence
from the Imperial Workshop.

494
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,080
This is not an attempted murder.

495
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,100
Your Majesty, please calm down!

496
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,320
Those servants in the Imperial Workshop
are all useless! They've injured you.

497
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,880
Your Majesty,
this is a negligence of my part!

498
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,540
Such an unimaginable mistake.

499
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,290
It shows how careless and sloppy they are!

500
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:46,120
Investigate this!
All involved personnel...

501
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:48,120
must be severely punished!

502
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,460
Chief Wu, she is Ling Long.

503
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,190
Take her away!

504
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:10,030
Chief Wu! Madam!

505
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,050
Chief Wu!

506
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,730
Chief Wu, what did I do wrong?

507
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,820
What did you do wrong? You tell me!

508
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,960
You were asked to make
a casual robe for His Majesty.

509
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,350
But you were so careless
and left a needle in the collar!

510
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,970
Do you know what this means?

511
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,280
We could have been punished for treason...

512
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,710
and all of us will lose our heads
because of you.

513
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:39,490
What should we do now?

514
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,920
That's right.

515
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,730
No...

516
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,960
I don't know anything about a needle.

517
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:52,260
It's Ying Luo! She is the one
who made the robe!

518
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,470
She is the one who was careless.

519
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:59,360
Ying Luo, hurry up
and tell Chief Wu that...

520
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,360
you are the one who made that robe.

521
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,170
You are the one who was careless.

522
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,710
This is not my fault!

523
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,130
Chief Wu, it was indeed Ling Long
who personally sewed that casual robe...

524
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:14,560
and handed it to me. I'm sure of it.

525
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:17,670
Take her away!

526
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,280
No! Chief Steward Wu!

527
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:22,840
This is not my fault!
I'm telling the truth!

528
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:26,900
Madam! It's really not my fault!

529
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,090
You want to visit a palace maid
who had committed a crime?

530
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,660
This is rare.

531
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:41,480
But visitors are not allowed in
the Bureau of Internal Affair. Leave now!

532
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,720
Eunuch.

533
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:46,040
I'll just visit her for a while.

534
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:50,020
I will not cause you any trouble.

535
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,840
Let's go and have some tea first.

536
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,710
You. It was you!

537
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,640
You framed me!

538
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,940
No. It wasn't me.

539
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,000
I kept thinking about Ji Xiang's death.

540
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,750
I was too absent-minded until
I left that needle in the collar.

541
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:24,430
I would have checked it before
I submit it to Madam Zhang.

542
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,080
But you were too impatient.

543
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:32,540
Maybe Ji Xiang is the one
who is punishing you.

544
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:36,650
I don't understand what you're saying!

545
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,070
Because you killed her.

546
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,540
No.

547
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,820
I didn't kill her.

548
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,270
Ji Xiang is not a thief.

549
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,320
You are the one who stole
the peacock feather thread.

550
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:58,140
You were afraid that Chief Wu would
find out the truth. To save yourself,

551
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,870
you fooled Ji Xiang to enter
the Embroidery House...

552
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:02,530
at night so that
she would be caught red-handed.

553
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:06,300
It was Ji Xiang's birthday that day.

554
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:09,730
You must have told her that...

555
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,630
you hid a gift for her as a surprise.

556
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,920
But Ji Xiang was too naive.

557
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:20,430
She would never think that you would use
such a sinister plot to frame her.

558
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:23,400
You're just making things up.
You don't have any evidence.

559
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,680
At this point,

560
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,230
do you still need to deny it?

561
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:30,240
Yes. I'm the one who turned Ji Xiang...

562
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:32,030
into my scapegoat.

563
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,680
She was too dumb to begin with.
So, she deserved it.

564
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,240
You want to frame me...

565
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:41,250
to avenge Ji Xiang?

566
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:43,930
It was just a minor negligence.

567
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:46,190
His Majesty has already issued a decree.

568
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,880
You'll be caned you eighty times...

569
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:54,040
and banished to Ningguta forever.
