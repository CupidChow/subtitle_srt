[Story of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 18]

3
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,430
We shouldn't let the commoners...

4
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,009
find out about it, should we?

5
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:01,920
Your Majesty.

6
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,280
Did you forget that you mentioned about...

7
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,420
a famous Jiangnan physician
during the lychee banquet?

8
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,050
Why don't we ask for his consult?

9
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:10,650
Have you become muddled too?

10
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:13,030
How long are we going to delay it?

11
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,990
Your Majesty, we can't delay it.

12
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,329
When the dawn comes,
we won't be able to stop rumours.

13
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,490
His Majesty doesn't have many descendants.

14
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,070
If this child was killed for
having some strange illness,

15
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,270
we would lose a prince.

16
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,440
Your Majesty.

17
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,640
Empress Dowager isn't
in the Forbidden City.

18
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,840
If she were here, she would be very upset.

19
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,600
Summon Ye Tian Shi.

20
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,080
Is this the renowned physician
from Jiangnan?

21
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,090
Your Majesty.

22
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:14,610
I think you shouldn't waste your time.

23
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,010
Ye Tian Shi sends
his greetings to His Majesty.

24
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,720
Ye Tian Shi.

25
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,640
Yes.

26
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,850
Check on the little prince.

27
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,990
Yes.

28
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,570
You're here to provide diagnosis.

29
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,630
What are you doing?

30
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,400
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

31
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,000
This place is so well-decorated.

32
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,940
I'm dumbfounded by it.

33
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,860
Start the diagnosis now.

34
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,190
Yes.

35
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,720
Your Majesty, there's nothing
serious with the little prince.

36
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,440
It's just jaundice.

37
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,490
Impossible.

38
00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:35,560
I've come across newborn jaundice.

39
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,880
But I've never seen...

40
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,200
one with golden pupils.

41
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,700
That's because you're ill-informed.

42
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,240
How dare a visiting physician
make such a derogatory remark!

43
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,840
When a newborn has jaundice,

44
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,280
it's usually his face,

45
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,200
neck, and limbs that turn yellow.

46
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,510
How would it spread to the pupils?

47
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,330
You're talking about congenital jaundice.

48
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,560
He'll recover in seven days
without being treated.

49
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,750
The little prince is having
pathological jaundice.

50
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,160
It has to do with the accumulation of bile
in a pregnant mother.

51
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,620
What congenital disease?

52
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,370
He's obviously talking nonsense.

53
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:09,720
The three generations of
my ancestors practiced medicine.

54
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,160
And they passed down their skills to me.

55
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,650
I've never heard of that.

56
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,060
Yes.

57
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,080
I'm not that well-trained compared to
you the imperial physicians.

58
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,990
But I've been everywhere as a physician.

59
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,820
And I've come across
many strange illnesses.

60
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,650
That means the little prince is fine?

61
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,050
He's merely having some strange illness?

62
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,060
Your Majesty, what do you think?

63
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,070
I get it.

64
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:37,780
Ye Tian Shi.

65
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,080
Is there any way to cure it?

66
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,250
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

67
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,150
I'll write a prescription
to reduce the jaundice.

68
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,600
In less than two weeks,
the little prince's jaundice will go away.

69
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,570
Maids.

70
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:54,390
Take the little prince away.

71
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,080
And attend to him.

72
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,909
Your Majesty!

73
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,640
The little prince has met
a renowned physician.

74
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,030
Things have taken a new turn.

75
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,030
I should be blamed for being too ignorant.

76
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,940
I didn't know it's just a common jaundice.

77
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,170
I almost got the little prince killed.

78
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,000
Your Majesty, please punish me.

79
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,850
The imperial physician
couldn't even tell the difference.

80
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,840
How can I blame you?

81
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,440
You're merciful, Your Majesty.
I'm very thankful.

82
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,240
It's just that...

83
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,280
others will suspect my motive...

84
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,320
and think that I wanted to
kill the little prince.

85
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,990
I'll issue a decree.

86
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,470
No one is allowed to talk about it.

87
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,380
Thank you, Your Majesty.

88
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,860
Greetings, Your Majesty.

89
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,400
Greetings, Your Majesty.

90
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:02,850
Consort Chun, get up.

91
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,930
Are you here to visit Fifth Prince...

92
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,790
because of what happened?

93
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,770
No.

94
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:12,920
I'm here because of a serious matter.

95
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,660
What serious matter?

96
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,410
Carry him in here.

97
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,240
Consort Chun, what are you doing?

98
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,210
Your Highness.

99
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,130
You're not afraid when you killed him.

100
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,800
Why are you afraid to see his body?

101
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,880
Your Majesty, did you hear
what Consort Chun said?

102
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,250
I just said that...

103
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,670
there would be someone who
misunderstood my intention.

104
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,880
See.

105
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,590
I haven't even left the Changchun Palace.

106
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,320
But the news has gotten out.

107
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:58,409
Consort Chun is blaming me.

108
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,710
Noble Consort Gao.

109
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,460
Don't you...

110
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,670
recognise this body?

111
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,450
How would I know it?

112
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,850
He's the Mongolian chef
from Imperial Kitchen.

113
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,240
He's the one who cooked for Noble Lady Yu.

114
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,390
Consort Chun!

115
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,220
What are you trying to imply?

116
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,309
These are Mongolian scones.

117
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,070
It's a snack from my hometown.

118
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,600
I thought I'd never get to eat this again
when I entered the palace.

119
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,560
I never thought a Mongolian chef from
the Imperial Kitchen could do this.

120
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,040
It's so aromatic and crispy.

121
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,520
-Ying Luo.
-Yes.

122
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,790
It seems that you've recalled something.

123
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:00,900
Noble Lady Yu...

124
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,370
loves Mongolian scone.

125
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,360
She'd eat three pieces every day
during her pregnancy.

126
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,920
And she liked them very hot.

127
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,800
It astounded me.

128
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,070
Your Majesty.

129
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,470
I've instructed them to bring here...

130
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,590
what the chef made.

131
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,140
Your Majesty, let me take a look.

132
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,000
It smells quite nice.

133
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,630
I wonder how this scone is made.

134
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,960
Add milk, ghee,
or milk skin into the dough.

135
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,530
You said Noble Lady Yu
loved to eat scones.

136
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:44,400
What else does she like to eat?

137
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,480
She replaced her normal diet...

138
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,480
with various kinds of sweet cake.

139
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,460
No wonder.

140
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,960
No wonder.

141
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,640
What do you mean?

142
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,610
Your Majesty.

143
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,520
A child is born with golden pupils...

144
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,960
mostly because the mother's body
is moist and hot.

145
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,680
It leads to the accumulation of bile.

146
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,800
I usually advise pregnant women
to watch their diets.

147
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,840
Don't eat too much of sweet, hot,
and unpleasant smelling food.

148
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,920
It's to prevent damage to
the spleen and stomach.

149
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,030
Scones won't do either?

150
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,880
No, you've misunderstood it.

151
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,960
Pregnant women's diets aren't restricted.
They can eat whatever they like.

152
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,060
But they mustn't go overboard on it.

153
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,670
Let's take the sweet cake
and scone as the examples.

154
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,460
You can have them once a day.

155
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,000
If you have it twice a day for months,
that's considered too much.

156
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,680
Mongolian women usually eat scone.

157
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,110
Sichuan women likes spicy food.

158
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,170
Yet, they're safe and sound.

159
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,530
How ignorant you are.

160
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,630
Sichuan is a wet place.

161
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,720
It's easy for dampness to get into
one's body and spleen.

162
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,420
Eating spicy food helps to
get rid of the dampness.

163
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,960
As for Mongolian women,

164
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,410
since they eat it all the time,
their bodies have gotten used to it.

165
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,850
Of course they are fine.

166
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,880
Eating habit, geographical environment,
and one's physical condition...

167
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,310
are interconnected.

168
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,520
Noble Lady Yu has been living
in the Forbidden City.

169
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,250
She suddenly acted abnormally...

170
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,400
and ate too much.

171
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,470
Of course her body can't take it.

172
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,690
What Physician Ye means is that...

173
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,880
due to the excessive consumption
of scone and sweet cake,

174
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,080
Fifth Prince has contracted jaundice.

175
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,800
Of course that's possible.

176
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,070
Consort Chun.

177
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,240
How did this man die?

178
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,760
Having learnt the lesson from
the Fourth Prince incident,

179
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,270
I got worried about Noble Lady Yu's diet.

180
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,090
That's why I instructed
someone to look into it.

181
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,800
Who would have thought it?
When we went into the Imperial Kitchen,

182
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,010
he already killed himself.

183
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,180
If we are to ask who the mastermind is,

184
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,580
we just need to know...

185
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,360
who insisted on
burying Fifth Prince alive.

186
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,200
We'll then know who the mastermind is.

187
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,600
Consort Chun, you're making
groundless accusation!

188
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,120
He's already dead. What gives you
the right to accuse me?

189
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,170
Your Majesty.

190
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,620
Fifth Prince is just a baby.

191
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,080
He's innocent.

192
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:50,550
Unless...

193
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:53,460
someone didn't want him to be born safely.

194
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,930
Think about it.

195
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:57,140
Ever since Noble Lady Yu got pregnant,

196
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,960
Her Highness has been
making things hard for her.

197
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,760
First, there's the traumatic experience
in the Imperial Garden.

198
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,560
She used the same trick
during the lychee banquet.

199
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,200
When Noble Lady Yu gave birth,

200
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,170
Her Highness was the first person
to rush to the Changchun Palace.

201
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:11,400
She even insisted on
having Fifth Prince buried alive.

202
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,270
It's hard to believe that...

203
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,200
she has nothing to do with this.

204
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,590
Your Majesty, that's not the case!
I know nothing about it!

205
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,020
Don't listen to this lying maid!

206
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,040
Your Majesty.

207
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,530
When Consort Chun and Consort Xian...

208
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,160
heard about what happened to the prince,

209
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,360
the first thing they thought of was
to call for an imperial physician.

210
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,720
But Her Highness...

211
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,200
wanted to execute
the prince without hesitation.

212
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,200
When Noble Lady Yu tried to stop her,

213
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,060
she didn't spare her either.

214
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,580
If she didn't intend killing the prince,

215
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,930
why would she be so hasty and resolute?

216
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,090
Your Majesty.

217
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:46,240
It's not like what she said.

218
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,360
You can't sentence me
just because of a corpse.

219
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,290
I won't accept such a verdict.

220
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,470
Moreover, he's dead.

221
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,560
What if someone actually forced him
to kill himself so as to frame me?

222
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,160
Your Highness.

223
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,080
After what has happened,

224
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,780
you're still trying to defend yourself.

225
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,920
When my men went to the Imperial Kitchen,

226
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,240
they discovered a blood letter
and 20 taels of gold.

227
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,570
It shows that this man saw it coming.

228
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,800
That's why he left the evidence.

229
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,210
[The mistress of
Chuxiu Palace will kill me.]

230
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,430
Your Majesty, that's not the case!

231
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:36,780
That's really not the case!
I know nothing about it!

232
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,390
I'm being framed!

233
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,870
-Your Majesty!
-Enough!

234
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,210
I'll hear no more of your explanation.

235
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,080
Eunuchs!

236
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,160
Starting from today,

237
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:51,860
Noble Consort Gao
will be detained in Chuxiu Palace.

238
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,440
Without my consent,

239
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,310
no one is allowed to
go in and out of there.

240
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:56,340
Take her away!

241
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,830
Your Majesty.

242
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,270
-Your Majesty!
-Your Highness!

243
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,220
I'm being framed!

244
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,560
-Your Highness!
-I'm being framed, Your Majesty!

245
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,860
Your Majesty!

246
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,090
Your Majesty, I'd like to report someone.

247
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,800
How dare you block His Majesty's way!
Do you want to die?

248
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,570
I know I'm guilty.
You can punish me later.

249
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,770
But it's a serious matter.
I dare not hide it.

250
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,600
Noble Consort Gao
wanted to kill Fifth Prince.

251
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,090
Wei Ying Luo took out
Her Majesty's golden seal...

252
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:41,620
to scare Noble Consort off.

253
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,740
But the truth is...

254
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,510
Her Highness didn't
pass her the golden seal.

255
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,430
She used it to issue a fake decree!

256
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,950
Your Majesty.

257
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,880
Your Majesty, it was urgent.

258
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,060
I was...

259
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,310
left with no choice.

260
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,080
You issued a fake decree
just because you're left with no choice?

261
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,790
Wei Ying Luo, it's a capital offense!

262
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,120
Wei Ying Luo.

263
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,650
Do you plead guilty?

264
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,940
Your Majesty.

265
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,440
I deserve to die...

266
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,470
for deceiving Noble Consort Gao.

267
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,060
You deceived Noble Consort Gao?

268
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,860
Your Majesty, please punish me.

269
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,800
What do you mean?

270
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,240
Zhen Zhu.

271
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,580
Show everyone the golden seal...

272
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,860
that I gave you.

273
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,520
How would I dare use
Her Majesty's golden seal?

274
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,880
Issuing fake decrees is a major crime.

275
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,780
But in that kind of situation,

276
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,540
if I hadn't protected
Noble Lady Yu and Fifth Prince,

277
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,180
they...

278
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:54,400
wouldn't be able to wait for Your Majesty.

279
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,680
For the sake of Noble Lady Yu
and Prince's safety,

280
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,520
I could only take risk.

281
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,580
Of course...

282
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,850
I've deceived Noble Consort.

283
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,100
I indeed committed a mistake.

284
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,080
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

285
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:10,920
Your Majesty.

286
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,770
Ying Luo did a good thing.

287
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,130
Deceiving Noble Consort Gao
was a trivial matter.

288
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,780
Saving Fifth Prince was a huge merit.

289
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,030
She's had a contribution.

290
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:20,600
If you punish her,
many will be upset about it.

291
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,630
Take her away.

292
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,970
Cane her for fifty times.

293
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:32,940
Your Majesty!

294
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:34,540
Your Majesty!

295
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,560
Your Majesty...

296
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:40,370
Your Majesty...

297
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,760
I'll go check on Noble Lady Yu
and Fifth Prince.

298
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,300
I'll go with you.

299
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,180
Okay.

300
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,160
Consort Chun.

301
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,440
Could we talk?

302
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,359
I'd like to ask you a question.

303
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,150
Did Noble Consort Gao...

304
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,839
really cause Fifth Prince's jaundice?

305
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,750
Wei Ying Luo.

306
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:16,540
What gives you the right to question me?

307
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,240
Your reaction...

308
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,380
tells me that...

309
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,599
everything isn't as simple as it seems.

310
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,870
Why do you suspect me?

311
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:29,970
One.

312
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,120
Noble Lady Yu voluntarily...

313
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,440
ate too many scones and sweet cakes.

314
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:38,260
Noble Consort Gao
could lure her into doing so.

315
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,980
But she couldn't control her.

316
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,190
Two.

317
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:44,950
Physician Ye merely said that...

318
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,880
having these foods...

319
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,410
could increase the chance
of Fifth Prince getting sick.

320
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,400
But it might not lead to an illness.

321
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,690
Why would Noble Consort Gao...

322
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,690
take such a big risk...

323
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,360
for an uncertain truth?

324
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,560
Three.

325
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,180
If Noble Consort Gao
wanted to make her move,

326
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,340
why did she not search thoroughly...

327
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,080
and leave a blood letter?

328
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,050
Isn't that laying up trouble for oneself?

329
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,760
Since you realised there's
something wrong with it,

330
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,680
why did you go back on
your word and help me?

331
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,150
Because Noble Consort Gao...

332
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,420
went too far.

333
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,700
The child is innocent.

334
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,030
Yet, she insisted on having him killed.

335
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,730
I could only retaliate.

336
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,010
Ying Luo.

337
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:36,540
Children who grow up
in the Forbidden City...

338
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,600
are destined to involve
in the struggle for power.

339
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,950
It's one's fate to die young.

340
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,610
Even if they manage to grow up,

341
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,480
they have to face
a fierce battle for the throne.

342
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,050
There's a price...

343
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:52,680
for such a luxurious life.

344
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,880
They've got only themselves to blame.

345
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,140
They've reincarnated as royal members.

346
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,220
I understand...

347
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:06,850
your words.

348
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,770
But I don't agree with them.

349
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,950
Only ferocious beasts...

350
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,020
would eat young animals.

351
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,860
If a person harms a young child,

352
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,760
that makes him a beast.

353
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,760
Your Highness.

354
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,040
Forgive me, but I must take my leave now.

355
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,480
If you keep on being such kind-hearted,

356
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,700
you'll soon be in peril of your life.

357
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,920
Your Highness.

358
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,270
Please have some.

359
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,520
Greetings, Lord Gao.

360
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,240
Zhi Lan?

361
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,000
Eunuch De Sheng.

362
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,990
Could I speak with Lord Gao alone?

363
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,720
His Majesty is waiting for the lord
to discuss some state affairs.

364
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,090
We can't delay it.

365
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,340
It won't take long.

366
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,840
Why aren't you in the palace
attending Her Highness?

367
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,020
Master.

368
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,920
Her Highness is being grounded
in the Chuxiu Palace.

369
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,320
And she's gotten sick from anger.

370
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,040
She won't eat and is losing weight.

371
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,850
When I was talking to her,
she didn't react at all.

372
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,920
She seems to have changed.

373
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,460
Got it.

374
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,130
You head back first.

375
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,030
Master!

376
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,640
Aren't you going to visit
Her Highness and comfort her?

377
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,310
Let me meet His Majesty first.

378
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,010
Eunuch.

379
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,650
-Let's go.
-Yes.

380
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,740
Lord Gao.

381
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:10,240
Lord Gao!

382
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,940
Yong Qi is so fair and chubby.

383
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,590
He's so cute.

384
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,670
Your Majesty.

385
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:22,440
It's all thanks to Physician Ye's
meticulous care...

386
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,660
and...

387
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:26,490
Miss Ying Luo
who risked her life to save us.

388
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,990
If it weren't for her,

389
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:31,820
Fifth Prince and I would have been killed.

390
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,000
I'll remember Ying Luo's contribution.

391
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,720
I dared not forget
Her Majesty's instruction.

392
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,690
If we hadn't worked together,

393
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,710
we wouldn't have scared
Noble Consort Gao off.

394
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,120
What contribution did she make?

395
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,800
She always tries to be in the limelight.

396
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,330
She wants everyone to know
how capable she is.

397
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:52,210
Kneel.

398
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,490
I can no longer order you around?

399
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,080
When I wasn't around,

400
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,270
what have you done?

401
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,550
I thought you'd repent.

402
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,120
But I've thought highly of you.

403
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,720
It's not enough to be
caned for fifty times.

404
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,260
Do you want to be caned
for another 100 times...

405
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,260
so that you'll repent?

406
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,920
With such attitude of yours,

407
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,200
I'm tired of caring for you.

408
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,840
Go out and kneel.

409
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,920
Your Majesty.

410
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:32,160
The lower palace maids are around.

411
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,200
Please save Ming Yu's face.

412
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,580
Ming Yu.

413
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,230
Let me ask you something.

414
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:42,390
Do you admit your mistake?

415
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,550
I'll go out and kneel.

416
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,360
Ming Yu!

417
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,120
Your Majesty.

418
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,200
Ming Yu is that stubborn.

419
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,640
You're magnanimous.
Don't take her seriously.

420
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,590
I'll go get her...

421
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,710
and make her apologise to you.

422
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,030
Your Majesty.

423
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,600
I've been staying in
the Changchun Palace for too long.

424
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,200
I should move back now.

425
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,200
Why don't you stay longer?

426
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,440
That's not appropriate.

427
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,830
But...

428
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,570
don't worry, Your Majesty.

429
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:24,950
Fifth Prince and I will visit you often.

430
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,060
It's just that...

431
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,990
I don't know if Fifth Prince...

432
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,410
will stay with me in the future.

433
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:41,960
Are you worried that you can't raise
Fifth Prince by yourself...

434
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,060
because your status isn't high enough?

435
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,500
I've asked His Majesty on your behalf.

436
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,980
You gave birth to His Majesty's son.

437
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,670
Hence,

438
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:56,470
he's promoted you.

439
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:00,280
He'll issue a decree tomorrow
to make you Imperial Concubine Yu,

440
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,070
the mistress of Yonghe Palace.

441
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,960
I'll never forget the kindness...

442
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,030
of Your Majesty!

443
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,960
Get up.

444
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:25,350
Fifth Prince.

445
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,290
Look at this little thing.
How handsome he is.

446
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,580
Doesn't he look like His Majesty?

447
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,120
Greetings, Your Majesty.

448
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,230
Get up.

449
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,120
Thank you, Your Majesty.

450
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,730
There's a lot of discussion about
your water management proposal.

451
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,960
I need a reason to support you.

452
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,600
Explain it in detail.

453
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,600
I've been managing rivers for years.

454
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,960
I've noticed that the Yellow River
flows in a rapid manner...

455
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,360
from its origin to Qing River.

456
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,300
It's closely connected to the Neibi Canal.

457
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,010
Please enforce the southern dike...

458
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:26,300
and make it the dike of
the northern bank of Yellow River.

459
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,350
This way,

460
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,240
we can prevent the Yellow River
from overflowing.

461
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,060
Carry on.

462
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,840
Jiangdu cuts through the river
and its topography is pretty low.

463
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,970
Have its gates redone. Make it deeper.
And it should surpass the Yellow River.

464
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:41,110
It's to reduce the amount of
water from Huai River...

465
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,740
getting into the main river.

466
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,770
That will...

467
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:49,420
reduce the probability of flooding
from the Huai River.

468
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,400
Carry on.

469
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,670
As of Yongding River,

470
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:56,630
its end is unobstructed.

471
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,570
It should be made into
a triangular lake...

472
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:00,680
with open side channels
and for irrigation canals.

473
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,290
The upper part would be connected to
the Zheng family reservoir.

474
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:04,640
The lower part would be connected to
the old river head of Daqing River.

475
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,000
Remove the soil.

476
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,750
As for the northern bank,
surround it with sloping dykes...

477
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,330
to guard the north from getting exceeded.

478
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:12,480
For the southern bank,

479
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,240
we should build dykes to restrict
the water from slipping southwards.

480
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,170
The low river mouth under
must always be cleared.

481
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,040
What about the upstream?

482
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,300
The upstream should have bleeders.

483
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,360
Shuangying at the southern bank.

484
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,770
Hulindian and Xiaohuijia Village
at the northern bank.

485
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:30,910
A mortar dam should be built
in each of these places.

486
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,610
And the embankment should be
reduced to be lower than the dam.

487
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:36,440
The Guojia Dyke at the southern bank
is just an old grass dam.

488
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,840
It should be rebuilt too.

489
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:46,350
Gao Bin.

490
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,360
Do you have any idea the number
of workers and material...

491
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,770
we need to make all this happen?

492
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:56,010
And who dare accept such a big project?

493
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:02,070
Your Majesty.

494
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,320
Our empire...

495
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,240
suffers from flood all the time.

496
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:08,990
And the affected areas are very vast.

497
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:11,040
Every year, there are hundreds

Their houses and families are all ruined.

500
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,440
Thus, this flood
must be put under control.

501

It can't be delayed.

502

and Your Majesty...

505

until the day I die.

506
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,330
Okay.

507
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:35,900
I'll make you the viceroy of Zhili.

508
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:37,650
You'll supervise the rivers.

509

I'll suppress them all for you.

512

I won't let anyone get in the way of
the river management proposal.

Don't let the commoners
of Great Qing down.

516
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:00,380
I accept the decree.
Thank you, Your Majesty.

517
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,500
You may leave now.

518

I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

I dare not meddle in your family affair.

I care about my eldest daughter most.

00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,360
I'll be leaving to manage the rivers.

529

I don't know when
I'll come back to the capital.

530

I asked His Majesty's permission
to visit Noble Consort Gao.

Yes, I'll tell Her Highness right away.

Surely she'll be very happy.

Your Highness,
Master is here to visit you.

539
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,510
His Majesty granted him the permission.

540
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:27,280
It means His Majesty
still cares about you.

Are you giving up on me too?

566

I've been an imperial official for years.

567

an official of first rank.

I've been through a lot
throughout the journey.

00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,640
I have only one request.

580
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,270
Wherever you are, you must always...

581
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,010
be your best selves and
give everything your best shot.

Go back in and look at
yourself in the mirror.

583

Take a good look at
this useless look of yours.

584

You don't look like my daughter!

How awe-inspiring your righteousness is.

586

Your political career is successful.
And you're climbing up the ladder.

587
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,520
But have you ever thought about my mother?

588
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,840
Have you ever thought of me?

589

Have you ever felt guilty
about what you did to us?

590

597

Old Man, remember this!

598
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,920
As long as I'm still around,

599
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,600
don't even think of sending
those two wretches into this palace!

will never replace my mother!

I'm afraid you'll have to
strengthen your position in this palace.

I'm not defeated!
And I'll never be defeated!

Noble Consort Gao.

665
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,960
You're drunk.

666
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,750
I'm not.

667
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,500
I used...

668
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,220
to sing...

669
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,760
and dance.

670
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,660
And you used to come here
and watch me perform.

671
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,110
But now...

672
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:29,670
you don't come here anymore.

673
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:33,840
You've also distanced yourself from me.

674
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,560
I haven't changed.

675
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,380
You have.

676
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,780
I've changed?

677
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,530
I'm your noble consort.

678
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,520
The noble consort of Great Qing.

679
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,930
If I sang...

680
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,550
and danced all the time,

681
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,860
everyone would laugh at me

682
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,900
for acting inappropriately.

683
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,270
Hence, I can't sing.

684
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,640
I can't dance either.

685
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,760
Your Majesty.

686
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:14,090
Is it because of this
that you don't love me anymore?

687
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:18,040
I don't want to be well behaved
or act appropriately then.

688
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:22,880
Without your tender affection,
what's the point of all this?

689
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,360
Your Majesty.

690
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,590
Don't leave me!

691
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,310
In this big Forbidden City,

692
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,800
I can only...

693
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,610
rely on you.

694
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,680
The floor is cold.

695
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,540
Your Majesty.

696
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,990
Father came to visit me yesterday.

697
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,580
And I remembered my mother.

698
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:54,910
Your mother got washed away by
the Yellow River...

699
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:57,810
when she accompanied
your father to mitigate the flood.

700
00:39:57,810 --> 00:39:58,790
No.

701
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,010
That's not the case, Your Majesty.

702
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:07,550
Yellow River caused floods all the time.

703
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,890
There's a group of pirates who settled
and robbed the houses there.

704
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:15,450
Father advocated the elimination
of the pirates and flood prevention.

705
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:17,580
Then, the pirates took revenge on him.

706
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,640
I was...

707
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,650
only five that year.

708
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,850
I floated...

709
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:34,340
in the river for a long time.

710
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,430
I got saved by a fisherman.

711
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,650
And they searched...

712
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:44,930
for seven days and nights.

713
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,210
What they found...

714
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,800
was the pitiful body of my mother!

715
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,760
If a woman...

716
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,670
falls into the hands of pirates,
what will happen to her?

717
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,500
Anyone can imagine that.

718
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,100
The Gao family refused to
have her buried in the tomb.

719
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,530
They refused to give her a place
in the ancestral shrine.

720
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:15,060
My mother spent her whole life...

721
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:18,160
giving birth to and nurturing
my father's children.

722
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,110
She was filial to her in-laws,

723
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:23,920
She managed the household well
and supported the family's career.

724
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,460
In the end,

725
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:29,930
she died very pitifully!

726
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,800
And Father...

727
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:34,600
said that...

728
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:37,090
since he's away all the time,

729
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,120
he needed a new wife to run the household.

730
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,670
In less than a year,

731
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,730
he married that woman named Ma.

732
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:53,130
That one?

733
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,710
Since she married into our family,

734
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,910
she kept abusing me and my siblings.

735
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,000
From then on,

736
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:09,810
days seemed like years!

737
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:14,160
It was a living hell, Your Majesty!

738
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,590
I know that...

739
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:28,880
you've suffered, Ning Xin.

740
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,470
Your Majesty.

741
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,740
I didn't harm Fifth Prince.

742
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,490
I really didn't.

743
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,360
I can swear.

744
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,680
I believe you.

745
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,650
Really, Your Majesty?
You really believe me?

746
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,640
I'm not lying to you.

747
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,830
You've had too much.

748
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,940
It's not good for your health.

749
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,140
Go to bed early.

750
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,590
Your Majesty.

751
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:00,300
Stay the night here.

752
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,790
Okay?

753
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,960
Your Majesty.
