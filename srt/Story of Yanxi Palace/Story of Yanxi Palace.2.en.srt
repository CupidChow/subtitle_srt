[Story of Yanxi Palace]
*[Episode 2]

3
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:54,440
The newly-selected concubines and consorts
will enter the palace in a few days.

4
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,710
If you are ill, get well soon.

5
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,610
Those who are not ill, buck up.

6
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,110
Don't let those newbies outperform you.

7
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,920
-Yes, Your Highness.
-Yes, Your Highness.

8
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,120
You may leave now.

9
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,010
What? His Majesty is retiring alone again?

10
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,720
Noble Consort Gao,

11
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,560
there are many reports that His Majesty
has to go through tonight.

12
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,520
He doesn't want everyone
to wait for him in vain.

13
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,470
Let's go. What are we still waiting for?

14
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,280
Farewell, Noble Consort Gao.

15
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:56,730
After going through the elimination round
and embroidery training,

16
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,050
you are now officially palace maids.

17
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,840
From now on, you will be under me.

18
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,960
We are new here and are still
unaware of the rules.

19
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,600
Please take good care of us, Madam.

20
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:16,050
Here, no one can take care of anyone.
Just pray for yourselves.

21
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,730
Madam, what do you mean by this?

22
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,560
Don't be anxious. You will find out later.

23
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:41,310
Ying Luo! Come over here.
I reserved a nice spot for you.

24
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,910
Let's go.

25
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,550
Ying Luo, thank you very much for today.

26
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:54,930
You are welcome.

27
00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:00,410
Are all the palace maids here new?

28
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,800
Yes. What's wrong?

29
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,530
Nothing. I just wanted to ask more
about the palace rules from...

30
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,980
palace maids who came in earlier than us.

31
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:16,070
I think someone is trying to
curry favours with Madam.

32
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,640
-If you say so, so be it then.
-You!

33
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:23,220
-Stop it.
-Why should I?

34
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,220
Yes. She is the best one here.
The most outstanding person!

35
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,280
We are all bad people here.
You are the only good person!

36
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,100
Ji Xiang, do you really
think she was helping you?

37
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:39,460
Let me tell you. She just wanted to
showcase herself in front of Chief Eunuch.

38
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,920
-You are spouting nonsense.
- If you don't believe me, ask her then.

39
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,670
Wei Ying Luo, you make a hit today.
Did you do it for yourself?

40
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,900
Fine. You want to ignore me?

41
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,140
Jin Xiu, what are you doing?
Stop splashing water on her bed!

42
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,000
You dared ignore me, right?
This is the consequence.

43
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,040
She deserves it for
stealing the spotlight.

44
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,680
That's right. You shamed us all.

45
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,160
Remember not to steal the spotlight again.

46
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,650
Don't be so eager for success.

47
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,530
Ying Luo, let's share a bed.

48
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,630
Jin Xiu, what are you doing?
Why did you wet her bed?

49
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:33,640
-What if the Madam finds out about it?
-Will she dare complain about it?

50
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,840
There are so many of us here.
Why should we be afraid of her?

51
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,400
Wei Ying Luo! What are you doing?

52
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,220
Ying Luo, are you crazy?

53
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,220
-Let's go and report this to Madam.
-No!

54
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,850
Ying Luo was just acting on impulse.
She didn't do it on purpose.

55
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,480
Ying Luo, say something!

56
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,800
This is too much.
Why did you wet all of our beds?

57
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,420
-Have you caused enough trouble?
-Trouble?

58
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,950
It's clearly you who is
causing the trouble here!

59
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,190
It would be rough for Ji Xiang if she
couldn't finish her embroidery piece.

60
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:21,080
And now, you are jealous because
I helped her and received a compliment.

61
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,050
You didn't want to her and
you forbade others from helping as well.

62
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,350
Is that logical? Initially, I didn't care.

63
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:30,450
Because I didn't enter
the palace to make friends.

64
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:33,860
But let me warn you today.
I, Wei Ying Luo,

65
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:36,640
has an ill temper and
I'm not someone to be trifled with.

66
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,370
If any of you want to target me again,
I'll have a way to deal with you!

67
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,370
You are arrogant and despotic!

68
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,040
-Wei Ying Luo, release me!
-You wanted to see Madam, right?

69
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,760
-Let go of me!
-I'll go with you.

70
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,530
Let's tell her what happened just now.

71
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,520
Ying Luo, release her. Aren't you
afraid that you'll be punished?

72
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,780
Do you really think that she is so free...

73
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,960
to seek justice for you?

74
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,030
We are all living under the same roof.

75
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,940
If we cause troubles,

76
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,060
we will all be kicked out.
Do you believe that?

77
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,790
Fine. Let's go now. Come on.

78
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,900
-Ying Luo, release her!
-Let her go.

79
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,600
It's too late to wake up Madam now.
Do you want to die?

80
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,860
-I was wrong. I was wrong, okay?
-Let her go.

81
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,960
I won't mention it again.
I don't want to be kicked out.

82
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,340
Why are you causing so much noise
in the middle of the night?

83
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,180
Madam Fang, I accidentally
overturned the tea pot just now.

84
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,360
Our beddings are wet now.

85
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,940
No need to cause a ruckus.

86
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,810
Just flip the beddings.
Don't make any noise again!

87
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,510
Stop right there.

88
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,960
Wei Ying Luo, what else do you want?

89
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,040
Flip my bedding for me.

90
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,320
Ying Luo, you are so amazing.

91
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:39,380
Besides being kind,
we should learn to protect ourselves.

92
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:40,890
Remember this.

93
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,820
Shut up. Go to sleep now!

94
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,030
[Ying Luo, are you crazy?]

95
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,860
[Get away from the coffin.]

96
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,790
[Ying Luo, come to your senses.
Your sister is already dead!]

97
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,200
[Everyone said that...]

98
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,480
[she died from an illness.]

99
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,180
[Now, I can prove that...]

100
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,810
[she didn't die from an illness.]

101
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,030
[She was strangled to death.]

102
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,510
[Shut up!]

103
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,400
-[Take a look for yourselves, all of you!]
-[Ying Luo.]

104
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,420
[Ying Luo!]

105
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,630
[There are bruises on her neck,
she was murdered.]

106
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,800
[She was murdered!]

107
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,320
-[She was murdered!]
-[Stop it!]

108
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,320
[Wei Qing Tai, your daughter opened
the coffin and disturbed the dead.]

109
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,360
[She'll be punished.]

110
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,120
[Yes. Ying Ning tainted herself and
was expelled from the palace.]

111
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,970
[That's why she committed suicide.]

112
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,990
[This kind of unchaste woman...]

113
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,850
[brought shame to the family!]

114
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,030
[Now, Wei Ying Luo is spouting nonsense.]

115
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:18,520
[Do you want us to punish her
according to the rules of our clan?]

116
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,600
[No, Clan Leader.
Ying Luo is too immature.]

117
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,170
[Everybody here, please forgive her.
I will discipline her!]

118
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,050
[Ying Luo, kneel down and
apologise to them now!]

119
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,370
[I lost my mother when I was young.]

120
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,180
[It was her who raised me.]

121
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:45,640
[Although we are all...]

122
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,700
[from the same clan,]

123
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:52,060
[I've never eaten their food before,]

124
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,960
[taken a single sip of water
or received any help from them.]

125
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,190
[Now, my sister died in injustice.]

126
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,530
[They failed to differentiate
right from wrong...]

127
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,920
[and criticised her for staining
the graveyard of Wei clan.]

128
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,080
[They won't even give her a burial spot.]

129
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,880
[You want me to apologise to them?]

130
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,870
[For what?]

131
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,670
[Why can't you let this matter drop.
What do you want?]

132
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,480
[My sister...]

133
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,750
[died for no reason at all.]

134
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,070
[I will enter the palace...]

135
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:39,290
[to investigate the truth of her death.]

136
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,980
[If you enter the palace,
you will get into trouble.]

137
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:48,290
-[Do I have to expel you from the family?]
-[I don't care!]

138
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:53,720
[Father. Even if you expel me
from the family...]

139
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,340
[and Wei clan,]

140
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,830
[I will still seek justice...]

141
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,010
[for my sister.]

142
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,510
What's wrong? Who hit me?

143
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,240
Madam, what's wrong?

144
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,950
What's wrong?

145
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,380
Look at the way you sleep.

146
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,190
You are exposing your bellies and
salivating in your sleep like toads!

147
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:32,910
This is the Forbidden City.
There are rules for walking and sitting.

148
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,720
You can't just act as you wish!

149
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,600
Madam, how should we sleep then?

150
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:41,730
Legs! Lie down!

151
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,700
Hurry up!

152
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,210
Your legs.

153
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:51,390
You! You should sleep in
the same direction! Turn over there!

154
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,920
Remember this position. Don't forget it
even when you are asleep!

155
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,510
Go back first and
let them sleep for a while.

156
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,700
Wake them up in an hour's time.

157
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,880
Your Highness, what's wrong?

158
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,910
Something is not right.

159
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:27,350
Your Highness, it's not daybreak yet.

160
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,440
Did you have a bad dream?

161
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,910
Idiot.

162
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,810
Something must be going on
with Concubine Yi.

163
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,700
Next.

164
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,230
What is this?

165
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,880
What are you doing?

166
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:59,370
Yan, help me think of a solution.

167
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:01,650
Sister, calm down.

168
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,370
How can I calm down?

169
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,160
Noble Consort Gao must be suspicious
of me now. She already suspects us.

170
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,680
What should we do now?

171
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,510
We should think of
a countermeasure against her.

172
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,210
Noble Consort Gao is here!

173
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,260
Hurry up and leave through the back door!

174
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,790
Fang Cao.

175
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:42,100
Greetings, Your Highness.

176
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,950
Noble Lady Yu, I heard that you are sick.

177
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,860
So, I came to visit you.

178
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,470
Imperial Physician Liu,
check her health for her.

179
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,820
-Yes, Your Highness.
-Noble Consort Gao.

180
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:02,360
What's wrong? I kindly brought along
the imperial physician to check on you.

181
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,109
And you don't appreciate it?

182
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:09,040
It's just a cough. I don't need to be
treated by the imperial physician.

183
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:11,339
Imperial Physician Liu.

184
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:20,380
Noble Consort Gao! Let me go!

185
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:33,440
-Greetings, Concubine Yi.
-Ming Yu, I need to see Her Majesty.

186
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,520
She is not feeling well and has
excused herself from today's greetings.

187
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,520
Concubine Yi, what brings you here?

188
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,600
This is an urgent situation.
I need to see the Her Majesty!

189
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,910
I already said that
she's not seeing anyone now.

190
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,530
Please come back later.

191
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,020
Your Majesty, help!

192
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,120
Concubine Yi, this is Changchun Palace.
How dare you make a ruckus here?

193
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,750
Your Majesty!

194
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,520
Your Majesty.

195
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,190
Your Majesty!

196
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:09,200
Your Majesty, I beg you.
Please save Noble Lady Yu!

197
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,470
Please save Noble Lady Yu, Your Majesty!

198
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,750
This is mine!

199
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:20,280
Palace maids are not allowed to bring
anything with them. Take your hands off.

200
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,390
Tell me what's in here.

201
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,930
I was afraid that I'll miss home. So,
I took a handful of dirt from my home...

202
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,440
and put it into this jar
and brought it here.

203
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,020
This is not against
the palace rules, right?

204
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,420
You look so nervous.

205
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,710
I'm going to check if this is soil or not.

206
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,950
Madam!

207
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,230
How impudent.

208
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,540
Noble Consort Gao,
please spare my mistress!

209
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,640
-I beg you, Your Highness!
-Stop!

210
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:56,030
-Please spare my mistress!
-Let go of me!

211
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,820
Your Majesty.

212
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,320
Noble Consort Gao, what are you doing?

213
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:09,730
Noble Lady Yu is sick.

214
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,990
So, I brought the imperial physician
here to check on her.

215
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,840
Imperial Physician Liu, what are you
forcing Noble Lady Yu to drink?

216
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,480
Her Majesty is asking you a question.

217
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,980
Tell her the truth.

218
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:33,020
Your Majesty.
When I was diagnosing her illness,

219
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,070
her left pulse is deep and wiry while
her right pulse is beating strong.

220
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:40,530
Her liver is unwell and
there is phlegm in her lungs.

221
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,400
She's suffering from a cough.

222
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,300
To relieve her coughing,
I specially prescribed a cough medicine...

223
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,540
to be taken with loquat jelly.

224
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:52,160
You are spouting nonsense!

225
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,740
She is pregnant.

226
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,360
She's not having a cough!

227
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,960
How dare you, Concubine Yi!

228
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,210
What did you say last night at Yanxi Hall?

229
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,950
You said that Noble Lady Yu
is just having a cough.

230
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,890
Today, you say that she is pregnant.

231
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:12,460
Did you deliberately lie to me?

232
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,010
Your Majesty, I haven't been having
my period for quite some time.

233
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,120
So, I discussed it with Concubine Yi
because it's about a royal heir.

234
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,900
I couldn't confirm it. I planned to report
to you after I get the confirmation...

235
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,040
from the imperial physician
in half a month's time.

236
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,920
I have no intention to hide this
from you, Your Majesty.

237
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,820
-Please forgive me, Your Majesty.
-No.

238
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,740
I am afraid that...

239
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,700
she will be harmed by others because
she's pregnant with a royal heir.

240
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:44,180
That's why I lied and said that
it was just a cough.

241
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:46,020
Harmed by others?

242
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,300
Who would harm her?

243
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:52,780
Concubine Yi, are you pointing at
a certain someone?

244
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:55,440
It has been proven that...

245
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:58,520
my speculation is not wrong.

246
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,510
This bowl of medicine...

247
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,920
is the evidence that
you were trying to poison the royal heir!

248
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,120
How presumptuous!

249
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:14,120
Whether it's poisonous or not,
we'll know once we check it.

250
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,740
Physician Zhang.

251
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,070
Yes, Your Majesty.

252
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,840
Your Majesty, this is indeed loquat.

253
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,110
That's it?

254
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,360
Yes, Your Majesty.

255
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,960
Your Majesty.

256
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,790
You heard it.

257
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,950
Noble Lady Yu herself said that it's too
early to confirm that she is pregnant.

258
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:13,430
It's common to have a wrong diagnosis.

259
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,960
She is the one who kept it hidden
because of her paranoia.

260
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,860
I kindly brought the imperial physician
here to treat her.

261
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,560
But she accused me instead
for harming her.

262
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,600
Concubine Yi is even more outrageous.

263
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:32,400
She accused me for trying
to kill a royal heir.

264
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:35,230
A low-ranking concubine...

265
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,790
defaming a high-ranking noble consort.

266
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:41,150
This is highly disrespectful!

267
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:46,040
Your Majesty, this is all my fault!

268
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,520
What is this?

269
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,040
I already told you that it's dirt
from my hometown.

270
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,640
Why did you taste it?

271
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,240
Wait for me, Madam!

272
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:08,520
Ying Luo, she probably thought that
it is sesame and walnut powder.

273
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:10,850
Some palace maids hid it from her before.

274
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:13,910
When she found it,
she confiscated all of their powder.

275
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,700
She must be blind.

276
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,720
This is really dirt from my hometown.

277
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,040
You brought dirt into the palace?

278
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,160
You're really a silly girl.

279
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,990
Sister. I'm sorry.

280
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:43,560
Noble Consort Gao, Concubine Yi
acted like this out of panic.

281
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:47,880
Could she speak without reservation
just because she panicked?

282
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:53,230
Your Majesty, the rules of
our ancestors are crystal clear.

283
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,840
Concubine Yi accused me
without any evidence.

284
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:00,640
If she's not punished severely,
she'll set a bad example...

285
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,760
and this kind of bad influence will
totally ruin the morale of the palace!

286
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,300
Noble Consort Gao, this is not
as serious as you said it is.

287
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:11,880
Concubine Yi did it because she is
worried about Noble Lady Yu's royal heir.

288
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:17,300
Your Majesty, going against your superior
is unforgivable.

289
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,440
You're the mistress of the six palaces,
the mother of the nation.

290
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:25,040
You have to set a good example
and be fair and square.

291
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,110
But if you insist on taking her side,

292
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,170
I can do nothing about it.

293
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:36,900
But if you are biased and
handle this unfairly,

294
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,030
everybody will question...

295
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,800
your ability to govern the six palaces.

296
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,770
How impudent!

297
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,760
Your Majesty, I was...

298
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:53,570
too impetuous and offended
Noble Consort Gao.

299
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,630
I was wrong.

300
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:00,790
I will always remember your
generosity and kindness.

301
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,890
No need to trouble yourself
with this matter anymore.

302
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:10,340
Noble Consort Gao,
it was a slip of tongue.

303
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:12,440
You can punish me however you like.

304
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,940
As for Noble Lady Yu,

305
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,840
please forgive her considering that
she is pregnant...

306
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,070
with a royal heir now.

307
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,840
Noble Lady Yu is very delicate right now.

308
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:29,160
I won't make things difficult for her.

309
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,040
As for you,

310
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,320
Are you really at my disposal?

311
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,840
No.

312
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,160
-No.
-This is not up to you!

313
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:47,710
Noble Consort Gao, this is...

314
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,440
all my fault.

315
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,360
I conducted myself wrongly!

316
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,990
You can punish me however you like.

317
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:58,770
I just hope to appease your anger.

318
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,820
How are you all alone here?
Where are the others?

319
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,880
They went to eat breakfast after
they are done with their work.

320
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,540
Why didn't you join them?

321
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:35,050
Today is my first day.
So, I wanted to be early.

322
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,760
You're quite sensible.

323
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:47,500
Madam Zhang, I'd like to
ask you about someone.

324
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,910
Who is it?

325
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,160
You've managed the Embroidery House
for so many years.

326
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,260
Have you ever heard of Wei Ying Ning?

327
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,160
No.

328
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,970
She was assigned to the Embroidery House.
Why wouldn't you know?

329
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:08,720
Other than some talented embroidery maids,

330
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,860
we also hire some skilled embroiderers
from the outside.

331
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:14,560
We just keep our heads down when we work.

332
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,280
We don't know who is who.

333
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,950
Her embroidery skill was outstanding.
She wouldn't have gone unnoticed.

334
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:24,330
So what if she is talented? It's nothing
when this palace is full of them.

335
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,850
There's another thing that
I need to remind you.

336
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,840
The person who you just mentioned...

337
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,480
has the same name as Noble Consort Gao's
maiden name for the third character.

338
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,290
Every palace maid has to avoid using it.

339
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:38,800
-Avoid using it?
-Yes. The servants are not worthy...

340
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,820
to use the name of the imperial consorts.

341
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:45,140
The person you mentioned must have
changed her name already.

342
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:50,260
So, don't ask around with her name
anymore after this.

343
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:54,110
If someone hears you,
you will be punished.

344
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,790
Madam Zhang.

345
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,280
I was wondering why you skipped breakfast.

346
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:00,710
So, you are bothering Madam Zhang here.

347
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:02,850
What were you two talking about?

348
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,920
Alright now. Since you are both here,
let's not idle around.

349
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,360
Make a trip with me.

350
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,810
-Yes, Madam Zhang.
-Yes, Madam Zhang.

351
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,700
Palace maids are not allowed
to loiter in the palace.

352
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:18,500
If you have no reason to come out,
just stay at your assigned palace.

353
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,880
You are embroidery maids.

354
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:24,010
You often have to our mistresses'
body measurements.

355
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,740
You must remember the paths well.

356
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:30,320
You don't want to be
delayed with your work...

357
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:32,680
because you got lost.

358
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,330
-Yes, Madam Zhang.
-Chief Wu has issued an order.

359
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,630
Noble Lady Yu is pregnant.

360
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,810
The embroidery house has to
make new clothes for her.

361
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,900
When you enter Yonghe Palace,
pay attention to me.

362
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,000
-See how I...
-Please spare her!

363
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,880
Please spare her.

364
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:56,320
Concubine Yi, I'm asking a question
on behalf of Noble Consort Gao.

365
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:58,240
Why am I slapping you?

366
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,970
I defamed Noble Consort Gao and
disrespected my superior.

367
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:06,220
Please spare her! I beg you!

368
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,420
Noble Consort Gao also asks you this.

369
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,200
Will you be careful with
your words from now on?

370
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,120
Yes.

371
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,240
-Louder!
-Your Highness!

372
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,510
I'll bear it firmly in mind.

373
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,960
Stop hitting her!
She made a mistake because of me.

374
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:25,480
If Noble Consort Gao wants to
punish someone, punish me! Hit me instead!

375
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,680
Noble Lady Yu,

376
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:29,520
you're pregnant with the royal heir.
You are very valuable now.

377
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,620
Of course we won't hit you.

378
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,660
But you made the same mistake as
Concubine Yi. You better stay out of this.

379
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,840
Yan, go back now.

380
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:43,710
Are you asking me to just let them
humiliate you like this?

381
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:46,890
I won't leave you.

382
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,960
I'm fine. Go back now.

383
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,520
Noble Lady Yu,
if you harm the royal heir...

384
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:55,600
by being so emotional, we won't be able
to take the blame for it.

385
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,160
Go back now. Yan, go back!

386
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:01,200
Are you all logs?
Hurry up and drag Noble Lady Yu away.

387
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,100
-Noble Lady Yu.
-I won't leave you!

388
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,100
-Sister!
-Go back!

389
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,270
I beg you, don't hit her anymore!

390
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,180
-Stop hitting her!
-Let's continue.

391
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,040
Fifteen more slaps left.

392
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:20,160
Madam Zhang, this...

393
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,680
Concubine Yi offended her superior.

394
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,920
She has offended Noble Consort Gao.

395
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,660
Noble Consort Gao punished her
to be slapped in public.

396
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,960
But Concubine Yi
is the head of a palace too.

397
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,670
So what? You have to see who she offended.

398
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,540
The rule of the palace is to
hit the body, never the face.

399
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,630
Now, Noble Consort Gao...

400
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,880
clearly chose this to humiliate
Concubine Yi completely.

401
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,530
Sometimes, even if they are
a consort or concubine,

402
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,320
even the lowest-ranking
palace maid is better than them.

403
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:02,060
Noble Lady Yu, what's wrong?

404
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,840
Your Highness.

405
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,680
Your Highness, why have you
slimmed down instead?

406
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:18,080
She couldn't eat or sleep lately,
of course she'll slim down.

407
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:27,030
The loquat jelly is poisonous.

408
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:30,590
Why couldn't they realise that?

409
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,360
-Why?
-Your Highness, stop thinking about it.

410
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:37,560
Physician Zhang has outstanding
medical skills. He wouldn't be wrong.

411
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,240
She wants to kill the baby in my womb.

412
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:43,800
Why couldn't they tell that
it was poisonous?

413
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,540
Noble Lady Yu, stop it. I beg you.

414
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,720
Old loquat leaves aren't poisonous.

415
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,080
But the young leaves are poisonous.

416
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,680
Ying Luo, what nonsense
are you talking about?

417
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,880
What did you say?

418
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:59,260
Ying Luo.

419
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:03,610
Don't you know the rules? Don't talk
recklessly about what you don't know.

420
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:12,550
Repeat what you said.

421
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:14,590
-In the past, I...
-Ying Luo!

422
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,220
When I young, I loved loquat.

423
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,720
But once, I accidentally ate the pit.

424
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,260
I had trouble breathing
and I kept vomiting.

425
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,840
Later, a travelling physician
told me that...

426
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:34,200
that physicians prescribe medicines
according to The Canon of Medicine.

427
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,040
According to it, they can only use
old loquat leaves...

428
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:40,230
to make the loquat jelly.
But most people don't know the reason why.

429
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:42,690
After that,
he discovered by chance that...

430
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:47,250
old loquat leaves are not poisonous,
but the new leaves and pit are poisonous.

431
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:50,800
If they are eaten in an excessive amount,
your life will be at risk.

432
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,960
The loquat jelly sent by Noble Consort Gao
must be made with young leaves.

433
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,120
The poison must be so faint that
Physician Zhang cannot detect it.

434
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:01,520
Even if he did discover it, she could just
blame the Imperial Apothecary for it.

435
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,300
So, this is the truth.

436
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,780
Come with me to meet Her Majesty
and repeat what you said.

437
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:10,100
Your Highness, you can't do that.

438
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,900
How can anyone believe the words
of a petty palace maid?

439
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,710
Could she be more accurate than
Physician Zhang?

440
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:22,490
Ying Luo, how dare you speak
without care like this!

441
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,280
Do you want to die?

442
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,200
She had experienced it before.
She knows the truth.

443
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,510
-Let's go.
-Your Highness!

444
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:38,870
Your Highness.

445
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,200
She is new to the palace.
She knows nothing.

446
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,230
Please be magnanimous...

447
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,840
and spare her.

448
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,140
Alright.

449
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,960
I won't make it hard for you.

450
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,070
I will go and expose the truth myself.

451
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,530
Your Highness.

452
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,780
Your Highness!

453
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:13,380
You brat. You've caused a huge disaster.

454
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,280
Noble Lady Yu, Her Majesty is having
a headache ever since she got back.

455
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,960
She's still not awake.
You won't be able to see her today.

456
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,639
Miss Ming Yu,
I have an urgent matter to report.

457
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,360
Please announce me at once.

458
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,159
Close the gate!

459
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,159
Miss Ming Yu!

460
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,810
Open the gate, Miss Ming Yu!

461
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:42,150
I have an urgent matter to report,
Miss Ming Yu!

462
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,260
-Look at her.
-Ling Long.

463
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,600
I thought Madam Zhang admired her.

464
00:34:51,969 --> 00:34:55,429
Why did Madam Zhang change so quickly
ever since they got back.

465
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,830
She spouted some nonsense and
angered Madam Zhang.

466
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,430
-I wonder what she did.
-That's right.

467
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,360
What did Ying Luo do wrong?

468
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:24,240
Alright. We'll stop here for today.
All of you are dismissed.

469
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,800
Look at how haughty she usually was.

470
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,160
Now, she's punished. She deserves it.

471
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,920
Keep up with your arrogance.

472
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,670
Ji Xiang, what are you doing?

473
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,240
Aren't you afraid that
Madam will punish you?

474
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,830
But...

475
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,320
Alright now, if you're too late,
I won't save you any food.

476
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,610
-Alright now, don't mind her. Let's eat.
-Time to eat.

477
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,110
-She has been out here for so long.
-Yes.

478
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,640
What are you looking at?

479
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:50,120
All these hours,
2,080 clouds had floated by.

480
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,260
Three hundred and two of them
were sunset clouds...

481
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,190
and the rest were all white clouds.

482
00:36:56,970 --> 00:37:00,610
Looks like you are in a leisure.
Are you so aloof from this world?

483
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,100
In the past, I always wondered...

484
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,390
why couldn't I embroider sunset clouds?

485
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:12,240
But after today,
I will be able to embroider them.

486
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,360
Stop talking about the clouds.
Let me ask you this.

487
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:17,840
Have you thought it through?
Do you know what you did wrong?

488
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,800
What did I do wrong?

489
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,390
You've been kneeling here for a day and
you still don't know what you did wrong?

490
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:24,840
Do you think...

491
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,690
I shouldn't tell Her Highness that...

492
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,250
the young leaves of loquat are poisonous?

493
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,100
Do you know your status?
Young leaves of loquat are poisonous.

494
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:37,050
And the royal physicians
don't know this, but you do?

495
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:39,150
Nonsense.

496
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,610
Are you trying to kill yourself?

497
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:44,800
What are you laughing at?

498
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,160
Yes is yes, and no is no.

499
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,400
I don't feel guilty about
every single word I said.

500
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,910
Yes, you are not guilty
towards your conscience.

501
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:55,770
But what about your parents?

502
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,120
What about me who are worried for you?

503
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:00,590
I know you punished me to kneel here...

504
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,160
because you are concerned about me.

505
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,940
That's why I am kneeling here now.

506
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:09,820
-Why don't you admit your mistake then?
-They are separate matters.

507
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:13,280
Why do I have to admit my mistake
when I didn't do anything wrong?

508
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,340
Forgive me for not being able to do it.

509
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,890
Let me show you
the consequence of speaking bluntly.

510
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,860
Be careful.

511
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,240
Madam Zhang, what brings you here?

512
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,610
We left something here yesterday.
I came to retrieve it.

513
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:46,750
This isn't a clean place. Hurry up
and leave after you retrieve it.

514
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:49,570
Thank you, Chief Wu.
We will leave right away.

515
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,440
Let's go now.

516
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,390
Why didn't you wait until
I go and beg Her Majesty?

517
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:05,460
-Why are you so foolish?
-Your Highness.

518
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:09,210
She's already gone.
Stop talking about this nonsense.

519
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,390
She's not gone yet.

520
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,920
She's not gone yet.

521
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:22,120
-Your Highness!
-You know the truth.

522
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,510
Tell everyone about the truth.

523
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,500
Noble Consort Gao wanted to kill
the baby in my womb.

524
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,660
My sister wasn't spouting nonsense.

525
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,060
-Go and tell everyone the truth! Let's go!
-Your Highness!

526
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,930
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness! Fang Cao.

527
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,920
Your Highness is too upset
and is not in her right mind.

528
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,920
Hurry up and escort her back to rest.

529
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,380
Let's go.

530
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,480
Your Highness, stop making a fuss.
Let's go back.

531
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:54,000
-I beg you. Let's go.
-Fang Cao.

532
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,240
Did you hear it?

533
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,480
The young leaves are poisonous.

534
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,960
They are poisonous.

535
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:07,780
Stop looking!

536
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,670
Did you see it clearly?

537
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,340
Concubine Yi was humiliated in public
and lost her dignity.

538
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:23,560
Noble Consort Gao wanted her dead.

539
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:27,940
What you said can't change anything.

540
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:31,000
This time, you are lucky.

541
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,700
If Noble Consort Gao
finds out about it next time,

542
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,560
you won't be able to save yourself.

543
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:41,110
Why did Concubine Yi commit suicide?

544
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,120
If she didn't die,

545
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,600
she could still fight back.

546
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,900
-What did you say?
-Concubine Yi was too weak.

547
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:53,820
Why did she have to die just because
she was humiliated?

548
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:54,980
Why?

549
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,780
She was a concubine and
was slapped in public.

550
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,080
How could she keep a foothold
in the palace after that?

551
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:06,480
If she doesn't seek death, is she supposed
to live and court shame upon herself?

552
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:10,360
If it were me,
I would be able to endure it...

553
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,140
even if I was humiliated by everyone.

554
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:18,030
Even if I was forced to kneel and wait,
I would still wait...

555
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,380
until the day when the truth is revealed.

556
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:26,350
You can't fight against the situation.
How can you break a rock with an egg?

557
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,860
You are wrong.

558
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,260
I am not an egg.

559
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,670
I am that stinky rock.

560
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,850
If you really had to face it one day,

561
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,990
you would know how scary it is.

562
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,100
I will fight tooth and nail for it.

563
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,970
The worst thing that can happen
is just to die.

564
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:45,980
You are forbidden to use that word.

565
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,840
Stubborn donkey.

566
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,920
Why did my sister die without any reason?

567
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,850
Why did Concubine Yi hang herself?

568
00:41:58,110 --> 00:41:59,720
Why is the world so unfair?

569
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,170
Why? Why? Why?

570
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,550
How dare you attack the
spiritual cypress tree?

571
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,570
Why are you hiding? His Majesty is here,
why aren't you kneeling?

572
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:09,450
Hurry up.

573
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,470
Hurry up!

574
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:21,060
Greetings, Your Majesty.

575
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,080
How dare you harm
the spiritual cypress tree.

576
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:30,160
I'm sorry but I don't know what
a spiritual cypress tree is.

577
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,190
You brat!
This is the spiritual cypress tree.

578
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:37,740
It once provided shade to His Majesty.
So, he named it spiritual cypress tree.

579
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:41,560
Even its name tag is hanging there
so clearly. Many came to worship it.

580
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,610
And you dared harm it?

581
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:45,910
Drag her away and cane her thirty times.

582
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,970
I'm new to the palace and didn't know
about this spiritual cypress tree.

583
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:52,540
But I did this for a reason.
