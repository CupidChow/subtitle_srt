[Story of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 48]

3
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,610
Won't you?

4
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,030
Maybe in your heart,

5
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,670
my existence is trifling.

6
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,280
But no matter how lowly my background is,

7
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,450
I do know what loyalty
and having a sense of honour mean.

8
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,000
Your Majesty,

9
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,890
in my life, I only have one master...

10
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,070
and one husband.

11
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,090
But I...

12
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,970
hate being misunderstood!

13
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,210
If you get petty again,

14
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,620
I won't see you anymore.

15
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,350
Who allowed you to use informal language?

16
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,280
If others hear it,

17
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,190
your life will be in danger.

18
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,960
You get mad...

19
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,240
because you are concerned about me.

20
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,480
Although I was treated coldly,

21
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,960
I am glad.

22
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,000
In this world,

23
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,250
you're the only one
who dare to talk with me like that.

24
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,130
If anyone else dares...

25
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,360
Because I'm unique.

26
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,160
Fine.

27
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,590
It was my fault.

28
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:41,060
I misunderstood you.

29
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,210
Your Majesty, what did you say?

30
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:48,670
I've already said it once.

31
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,250
I won't repeat it.

32
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,579
I know.

33
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,820
You said that...

34
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,000
you admit your mistake

35
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,850
and you misunderstood me.

36
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,150
Your Majesty,

37
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,290
what about my flowers that you moved away?

38
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,410
I'll compensate you...

39
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,590
twice the number.

40
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,030
No,

41
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,380
three times.

42
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,440
Those flowers were used
to cover the smell of commodes.

43
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,970
You keep them for yourself!

44
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:25,120
Then I will find better,

45
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,200
more beautiful flowers to send you.

46
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,040
It's exactly because
you treated me coldly...

47
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,890
that I got bullied.

48
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,760
Look.

49
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,310
To embroider,

50
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,040
my hands are full of chilblains.

51
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,550
I guarantee that...

52
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,810
from now on,

53
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,100
I will never let anyone bully you.

54
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,680
What if someone
spreads rumours about me again?

55
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,740
They will be sentenced to death.

56
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,300
Young Master, you rarely drink.

57
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,960
Tonight, why are you...

58
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:17,030
Today I schemed against
His Majesty for the first time.

59
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,080
It's worth getting drunk about.

60
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,210
Schemed against His Majesty?

61
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,170
Ying Luo caught Xiao Quan Zi stealing.

62
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,380
She ordered him
to have stolen goods sold...

63
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,050
in the palace market...

64
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,240
to frame Noble Consort Chun.

65
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,580
That was the first step.

66
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,240
She did not make any moves,

67
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,920
fooling young Concubine Jia...

68
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,340
that her tricks had worked.

69
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,700
She then took advantage of
Xiao Quan Zi's crime...

70
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,760
to charge against young Consort Jia.

71
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,720
That was the second step.

72
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,720
But those two steps weren't enough.

73
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,570
Although she's favoured,

74
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,740
there remains a hidden danger.

75
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:05,060
Young Master, you mean
the past of Concubine Ling?

76
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,690
I once requested permission
of His Majesty to marry Ying Luo...

77
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,200
and repeatedly contradicted him
because of Ying Luo.

78
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:17,570
That left a thorn in his heart.

79
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,680
When I returned from the battlefield,

80
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:23,090
His Majesty would surely hold a grudge.

81
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,110
He's the Emperor...

82
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,100
and also a man.

83
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,600
He can never allow his concubine...

84
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,600
to have an affair with someone else.

85
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,150
Moreover,

86
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,130
the man is even his brother-in-law...

87
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,540
and his trusted subordinate.

88
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,710
As long as the thorn remains in his heart,

89
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,770
her prospect will remain uncertain,

90
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:49,550
no matter how much
His Majesty favours her.

91
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,490
Hence,

92
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,890
she'd rather pull out the thorn...

93
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,690
herself.

94
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,530
You mean...

95
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,850
Concubine Ling did it deliberately?

96
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,820
How did you know?

97
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,810
Since she stopped me in Changchun Palace.

98
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,620
[So you haven't left yet.]

99
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,640
[Ming Yu,]

100
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,700
[guard the door.]

101
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,310
[Your Majesty, look.]

102
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,810
[I am right.]

103
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,350
[They are indeed having a tryst here.]

104
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,630
I guessed correctly...

105
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,210
that I was involved in
the third step she took.

106
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:35,550
Is getting out of favour
within her scheme too?

107
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,120
To obtain what others can't,

108
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,500
one should endure what others can't.

109
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,700
For example,

110
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,330
the love of His Majesty.

111
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:47,500
Ying Luo needs me...

112
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,530
to catalyse the feelings
of His Majesty towards her.

113
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,220
Because of her,

114
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,570
His Majesty experienced failure,

115
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:59,560
jealousy and concern...

116
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,470
for the first time.

117
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,100
What is she trying to do?

118
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,520
In the past,

119
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,210
she was just a favoured concubine.

120
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,450
From now on,

121
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,980
she will be the woman...

122
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,980
His Majesty truly holds in heart.

123
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,970
If His Majesty learns the truth...

124
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,400
His Majesty could recite an article...

125
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,660
just by reading it once when he was young.

126
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,360
None of us could surpass him.

127
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,120
After ascending the throne,

128
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,960
he eliminated cliques led respectively
by Zhang Ting Yu and Ortai...

129
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,289
and disintegrated the scheme
of Hong Xi to usurp the throne.

130
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:41,750
He has won high recognition
from the people.

131
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,159
Of course, he is smart enough...

132
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,890
to recognise her plan.

133
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,330
Maybe she gives him a great sense
of freshness and he was interested,

134
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,450
so he willingly let himself indulge in it.

135
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,520
But Young Master,

136
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,050
this is too unfair for you.

137
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,090
As long she needs him,

138
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,970
I will be around...

139
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,550
in every possible way.

140
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,150
You should give up now.

141
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,940
Even without Concubine Ling,

142
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,780
he has the confidante around.

143
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,380
Third Brother will never change his mind.

144
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,760
This is my business.

145
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,300
It has nothing to do with you.

146
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,420
Sparse flowers and leaves...

147
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,730
render the artistic mood of an orchid.

148
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,650
Have you seen the orchid painting
by Noble Consort Chun?

149
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,310
The lighter your stroke is,

150
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,910
the more artistic it looks.

151
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,830
No!

152
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,410
What are you doing?

153
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,510
I don't like simple orchid paintings.

154
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,600
The more vulgar, the better.

155
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,060
Your Majesty, look.

156
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,380
Isn't this fine too?

157
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,780
You are painting in an unreasonable way.

158
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,670
Your Majesty, if you like the paintings
of Noble Consort Chun,

159
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,650
you can paint with her.

160
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,090
Anyway, I'm a vulgar person.

161
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,080
The paintings I paint
are of course vulgar too.

162
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,510
I made...

163
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,160
a slip of the tongue.

164
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,680
In fact, your painting skills
have improved a lot.

165
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,800
It's my fault.

166
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:03,680
You...

167
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,710
are unique.

168
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,740
Why did I compare you with others?

169
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,200
Are you no longer angry now?

170
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,510
I'll be vulgar with you.

171
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,900
Are you satisfied now?

172
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,600
You're vulgar indeed.

173
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,340
Why am I vulgar?

174
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,850
Where are you going?

175
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,590
Supervisor Li,

176
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,270
what trick did Concubine Ling use?

177
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,470
I couldn't understand it.

178
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,300
Serve this yourself...

179
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,960
-to figure it out.
-Me?

180
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,660
You got this painting,

181
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,570
"Autumn Colours in the Qiao
and Hua Mountains" back.

182
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,650
What are you doing?

183
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,920
One stamp. Two stamps.

184
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:10,330
Three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine...

185
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,410
There are over forty stamps in total.

186
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,220
All these are stamped by Your Majesty.

187
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,840
You stamped one after one...

188
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,190
on it at will!

189
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:30,640
This is the same as
the medicated plasters...

190
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,750
that I saw under the bridge.

191
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,210
They are nearly impossible to be removed.

192
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,230
How preposterous!

193
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,500
Your Majesty,

194
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:47,850
you're so mad just because...

195
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,260
I say you are vulgar.

196
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:01,700
Try to put yourself in my shoes.

197
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,190
Your Majesty said I'm vulgar earlier.

198
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,460
Of course, I was unhappy.

199
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:20,870
Okay.

200
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,430
I'm not angry anymore.

201
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,240
You should stop being angry too.

202
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,680
Okay?

203
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,580
Your Majesty.

204
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,480
If you dare make up nonsense again,

205
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,080
I'm going to let you
copy my poems for 100 times!

206
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:44,050
I don't like...

207
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,870
any of your poems.

208
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,360
If you're going to punish me,
let me copy poems of the Tang Dynasty.

209
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,480
Wei Ying Luo!

210
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,150
Fine.

211
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,150
I'll copy your poems then.

212
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,930
But,

213
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,870
there is no good inkstone...

214
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,640
in my palace.

215
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,280
Your Wujin inkstone...

216
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,630
is precious and attractive.

217
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,280
Gift it to me, okay?

218
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,130
Unruly.

219
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:24,530
This Wujin inkstone is rare...

220
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,020
and priceless.

221
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,150
I only have one.

222
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,060
Fine, take it.

223
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,420
It's yours now.

224
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,280
Come over here and finish your painting.

225
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,880
What are you painting?

226
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,890
Mantis.

227
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:01,720
Mantis?

228
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,200
The foot...

229
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,240
Did you see it clearly?

230
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,650
Yes, I did!

231
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:14,920
Supervisor Li,

232
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,850
I've been in the palace for so long.

233
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,000
It's my first time to...

234
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,680
see a woman like Concubine Ling!

235
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,520
Not only you,

236
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,180
me too!

237
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,950
Think about it. There are
so many women in the imperial harem.

238
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:28,920
They all gentle, kind,
respectful and submissive,

239
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,590
except Concubine Ling. She is distinctive.

240
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,550
Supervisor Li,

241
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,130
I heard just now...

242
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,880
that Concubine Ling
said His Majesty is vulgar.

243
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,270
She even said she doesn't like his poems.

244
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,410
His Majesty was so mad
that he got speechless.

245
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,310
I got...

246
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,120
a big shock.

247
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,240
I thought...

248
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,980
His Majesty would
sentence her to death at once.

249
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,170
I cannot agree with you more.

250
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:57,320
Let me tell you that...

251
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,720
everyone regards His Majesty
as the most respected person.

252
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,260
She's the only one that...

253
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,690
treats His Majesty as an ordinary being.

254
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,820
She laughs or throws tantrums
based on her mood.

255
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,440
When she's unhappy,
she even scowls at His Majesty.

256
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,560
Concubine Ling is so bold.

257
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,150
She kept annoying His Majesty.

258
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:22,520
Even if others learn the way
she obtains His Majesty's favour,

259
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,920
who would dare imitate her?

260
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,240
They would...

261
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,310
put their life at risk.

262
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,690
Your Majesty,

263
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,840
Noble Consort Chun came several times.

264
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,030
She said she investigated...

265
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,740
the sales of stolen goods in
the palace market.

266
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,400
She wants to ask
Your Majesty to make a decision.

267
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:38,700
Let's go to Zhongcui Palace.

268
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:39,880
Yes.

269
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,570
Carry the sedan to Zhongcui Palace!

270
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,400
-Wait!
-Stop!

271
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,560
Go.

272
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,130
Get it for me.

273
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:19,400
[To a long silk thread,
it entrusted all its movement.]

274
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,400
[Whether to be released or not,
all is controlled by me.]

275
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,319
[Being covered by paper,
its frame feels no worries.]

276
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,780
[It got pulled at will
by a wind that blew by.]

277
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,440
[After cutting off the thread,
it now floats to the ends of the world.]

278
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,190
[I'm unable to pull it back,]

279
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,060
[nor see where it has gone.]

280
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,500
[I don't know it ended up in whose house.]

281
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:46,330
Your Majesty, what was written on it?

282
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,580
Lyrics of a Yuan Dynasty song,

283
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,060
an unpopular one.

284
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,880
Let's go to Yanxi Palace.

285
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,990
Yes.

286
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,560
Carry the sedan to Yanxi Palace?

287
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,640
Tell Noble Consort Chun that...

288
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,160
I'll visit her tomorrow.

289
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,190
Yes.

290
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,640
His Majesty said that
he would come yesterday,

291
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,200
but he went to Yanxi Palace instead.

292
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,890
Will he do the same today?

293
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,640
When His Majesty said he'll come,
he will surely come.

294
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,630
Yes.

295
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,000
You prepared an exquisite chess set...

296
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,130
and by all means found
the favourite book of His Majesty.

297
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,130
You will surely make him stay here.

298
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,080
Greetings, Your Majesty.

299
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,560
No need for formalities.

300
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,940
Thank you, Your Majesty.

301
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:51,400
Your Majesty, I've already
thought of a way to solve...

302
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,430
the chess game you left last time.

303
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,640
You said that you've already
solved the palace market case.

304
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,470
I want to know what happened.

305
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,900
Yes.

306
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,890
I've already found out the truth.

307
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,800
The stolen items that appeared
in the palace market last time...

308
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,730
were from several famous antiques shops...

309
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:12,490
on Glass Street.

310
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,070
According to the owners,

311
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,760
the buyer has fair skin without a beard...

312
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,280
and a high-pitched voice.

313
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,210
He might be an eunuch from the palace.

314
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,450
Your Majesty,

315
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,440
I meticulously
arranged the palace market...

316
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,440
to please Empress Dowager.

317
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:32,560
But it became a market
to sell stolen goods finally.

318
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,360
Someone is clearly framing me.

319
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,100
Who would frame you?

320
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,650
I now hold the position
of Noble Consort...

321
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,580
and I'm the mother of Sixth Prince.

322
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:46,840
I may get in the way
of new concubines who seek promotion.

323
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,810
New concubines?

324
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,480
Your Majesty,

325
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,560
although Empress Dowager
didn't clearly state it,

326
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,820
I know that she was dissatisfied with me.

327
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:05,810
Many in the palace talk about me.

328
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,240
I won't believe
that is not meticulously planned...

329
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,830
by someone.

330
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:14,430
Being falsely accused,
I feel so aggrieved.

331
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,210
I can only beg Your Majesty
to give me justice.

332
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,420
That's the sound of drums.

333
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,640
And the sound of zithers.

334
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,460
It sounds like
a musical composition from afar.

335
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,090
How did they do it?

336
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,640
Your Majesty,

337
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,880
I was talking about…

338
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,160
I have something else to do.

339
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,750
Let's talk about it next time.

340
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,820
Your Majesty!

341
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:52,480
Listen.

342
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,760
It's really the sound of drums.

343
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,460
No, it's the sound of zithers.

344
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,880
It's like fairy music from the heaven.

345
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,490
What is going on?

346
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:00,680
You're curious?

347
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,320
Go and ask Concubine Ling.

348
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,700
Wasn't it her who personally
made those Kongming lanterns...

349
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,500
that are emitting weird sounds?

350
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,750
Give it to me.

351
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:41,850
Didn't Your Majesty go to Zhongcui Palace?

352
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,870
Why are you here?

353
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,570
Didn't you deliberately lure me here?

354
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:49,790
You are joking.

355
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,960
I was bored...

356
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,160
and made Kongming lanterns for fun.

357
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,110
How did you make it emit music?

358
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,810
Guess.

359
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,910
You placed paper drums...

360
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,240
inside the Kongming lanterns.

361
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,640
That is why these lanterns...

362
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,640
are emitting drum sounds.

363
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,550
Not only paper drums,

364
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,200
there are also metallic reeds inside them.

365
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,720
So they will emit zither sounds...

366
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,720
when flying into the sky.

367
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,850
Interesting.

368
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,910
I'm done releasing the lanterns.

369
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,440
Your curiosity has also been satisfied.

370
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,120
You can go back and
continue with your chess game.

371
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,280
I won't play chess.

372
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,950
Accompany me to admire the moon.

373
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,970
I'm tired now...

374
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,960
and need to go back to have a rest.

375
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,780
Please help yourself.

376
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,920
Stop right there!

377
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,600
Your Majesty.

378
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,080
You think I'm that easy to brush off?

379
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,720
Accompany me to admire the moon.

380
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,190
This is inappropriate!

381
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,890
Put me down!

382
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,960
Look, Kongming lanterns!

383
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,410
The sound seems
to come from inside the lanterns.

384
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,800
What are you all doing? Go to work.

385
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,050
Leave now.

386
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:26,100
What's so good about that?

387
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,840
Concubine Ling is the craftiest...

388
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,710
among all concubines.

389
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:43,880
Even if His Majesty favoured
Noble Consort Chun before,

390
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,680
others still had chances.

391
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,100
But since she entered the palace,

392
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:50,080
she kept striving
for favour using tricks.

393
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,050
No matter which palace
His Majesty intended to visit,

394
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:53,910
she'd dare to intercept halfway.

395
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,570
She's got the most tricks.

396
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,250
Yesterday she sent off kites.

397
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:02,240
Today, she released
the singing Kongming lanterns.

398
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,040
Who knows what trick
she's going to play tomorrow?

399
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,300
She is very interesting.

400
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,100
Your Majesty,

401
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,970
what's interesting about her?

402
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:12,270
She is just good at...

403
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:14,480
playing tricks.

404
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,480
Zhen.

405
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,500
A general needs to win the battle.

406
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:20,580
An officer needs to serve the people.

407
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,780
A concubine needs to strive for favour.

408
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,460
Otherwise, why would she enter the palace?

409
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:28,290
Why are you speaking
on her behalf instead now?

410
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,460
I find her interesting...

411
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,040
because she always
aims high in doing anything.

412
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,610
When she was in the Embroidery House,

413
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,470
she stood out with a phoenix robe.

414
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,620
At Changchun Palace,
she was most favoured by the late Empress.

415
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,450
When she scrubbed
commodes at the corridor,

416
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:48,960
she managed to do it
in a distinctive fashion.

417
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,760
Nothing...

418
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,120
can stop her from getting promoted,

419
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,370
because she has dogged determination.

420
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,910
What a pity.

421
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,390
What's the pity?

422
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,520
What a pity she's not a man.

423
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:07,470
Your Majesty.

424
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,240
I don't understand.

425
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,480
What are you thinking about?

426
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,570
I am thinking that
the mistress of Zhongcui Palace...

427
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:21,060
will surely have
a hard time falling asleep tonight.

428
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:48,030
Your Majesty,

429
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,790
I am not narrow-minded,

430
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,380
but Concubine Ling went too far.

431
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,320
His Majesty...

432
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,600
flipped my plaque that day,

433
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,160
but she used being sick as an excuse...

434
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,960
to invite him over.

435
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,240
Imperial Concubine Shu,

436
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,550
I know what happened that night.

437
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,360
Yanxi Palace did summon
an imperial physician.

438
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,640
His Majesty went there upon hearing it.

439
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,980
Concubine Ling wasn't
tormenting you on purpose.

440
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:15,800
You can say the first time
wasn't on purpose.

441
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,680
But she did it so many times!

442
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,800
Your Majesty, you can ask others.

443
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,650
Since Concubine Ling entered the palace,

444
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:26,130
we entered the icehouse.

445
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,240
It's true, Your Majesty.

446
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,160
For concubines,
moral conduct takes priority,

447
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,740
instead of beauty.

448
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,800
She dares to use vulgar ways
originating outside the palace...

449
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,760
to obtain His Majesty's attention.

450
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,720
What do you mean by vulgar ways?

451
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,120
Your Majesty,

452
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,140
Concubine Ling heard that
a palace maid from...

453
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,560
the prior dynasty could make
green plum carvings.

454
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,470
She knocked down...

455
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,160
all the green plums of a tree.

456
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,560
Never mind that.

457
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,930
But she stopped carving...

458
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,000
while His Majesty was waiting anxiously
for her finished product.

459
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,200
She then delivered a jar of plum wine
to Yangxin Hall instead.

460
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,680
Surprisingly,
His Majesty was very pleased by it.

461
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,460
This is so odd.

462
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,370
And there's more.

463
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,760
She played Cuju in the palace.

464
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,020
She even designed
a jade-colored Han robe...

465
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,840
and strolled in it
under the moonlight with His Majesty.

466
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,190
She looked graceful in the robe.

467
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,780
What's wrong with that robe?

468
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:18,680
Noble Consort Yuan of
the prior dynasty did exactly that.

469
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,000
She learnt that masterfully.

470
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,260
She's an enchantress who may bring
disaster to the nation and the people.

471
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,660
Actually,

472
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,010
Concubine Ling is very versed
in making Xiaohan flowers.

473
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:30,370
She personally made them
for her palace maids to put on.

474
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:31,640
I thought it was...

475
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,960
so amusing.

476
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,270
What do you know?

477
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,680
Your Majesty,

478
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,200
what's most hateful...

479
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,900
is that she drew a painting
of a mantis playing on an orchid...

480
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:44,500
and forced His Majesty to hang it
in Hall of Three Rare Treasures.

481
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:50,430
Noble Consort Chun,

482
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,920
why are you staying quiet?

483
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,870
The concubines are all different.

484
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,970
Her Majesty is dignified and prudent.

485
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:02,960
As concubines,

486
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,650
we must try our best
to please His Majesty.

487
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:12,460
It's because
you are not as skillful as her.

488
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:14,710
What is there to complain?

489
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,530
Her Majesty,

490
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,580
I need to ask for leave for Consort Yu.

491
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,960
She has a cold.

492
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:30,850
To prevent from infecting others,

493
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:33,500
she's nursing her illness
in Yonghe Palace.

494
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,880
Consort Yu is being too cautious.

495
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,760
She's already told me this.

496
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,640
But why did
she trouble you to tell me again?

497
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:45,920
Courtesy costs nothing.

498
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,700
Consort Yu has
always been very rule-bound.

499
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:53,060
Today I come to discuss an urgent matter.

500
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,340
Over the years,
fabric and fans from Ryukyu,

501
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,210
yellow incense
and lacquered fans from Annam,

502
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,500
as well as camlet, white silk,

503
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:04,340
logwood and spices from Russia

504
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:06,910
are all tributes that have piled up.

505
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,860
They should be sent to the custom house
at Chongwen Gate to be sold off.

506
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:14,330
These matters
were managed by the late Empress.

507
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,230
Now they've been delayed.

508
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,590
Noble Consort Chun points....

509
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,740
to a serious matter.

510
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:26,160
I will report it to His Majesty...

511
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,120
to arrange for a sell-off soon.

512
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:30,410
You all need to...

513
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,240
learn from her,

514
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,110
staying composed at all times.

515
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,280
Don't be impetuous all day.

516
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,000
That will annoy His Majesty.

517
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,310
Yes.

518
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,930
Your Majesty,

519
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,480
His Majesty just issued a decree...

520
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,880
to promote Concubine Ling to Consort Ling.

521
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,110
Your Highness.

522
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,160
A gentleman is ready to help others.

523
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,800
Lord Fu Heng,

524
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:24,080
you have a sharp sense of integrity.

525
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,480
I finally realise that...

526
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,910
Wei Ying Luo...

527
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,220
used you to get herself promoted.

528
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,160
Fu Heng,

529
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:36,090
are you aching now?

530
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,090
Noble Consort Chun,

531
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,680
may you speak prudently.

532
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,610
Am I not telling the truth?

533
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,260
Judging from background, talent...

534
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:45,560
and sacrifices made for you,

535
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,020
I am above her in all.

536
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:49,370
But you only have affection for her.

537
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,760
You even endured...

538
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:52,280
heart-piercing pain to help her!

539
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,960
Tell me, why?

540
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,050
Noble Consort Chun,

541
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,770
you must remember your status.

542
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,960
Stop asking questions
that only humiliate yourself.

543
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,880
I shall take my leave.

544
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:08,020
Don't be optimistic.

545
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:11,450
Even if Wei Ying Luo becomes Consort Ling,

546
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,590
she won't block my path.

547
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:30,440
Your Majesty, for the case of Xushuguan
Supervisor An Ning embezzling tax money.

548
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,700
I've already looked into it thoroughly.

549
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,320
In the last three years
when managing Xushuguan,

550
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,780
for every 0.025 taels of
tax money received,

551
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,640
he falsely reported
as having received 0.015 taels.

552
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,420
During his tenure,

553
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,960
he had embezzled more than 8,000 taels.

554
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,420
including sacrifice fee,

555
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,760
bridge fee, mooring fee...

556
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,220
and dress fee at each port.

557
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,680
The specific accounts are...

558
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,770
detailed in the report.

559
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,800
A vermin like him must be killed...

560
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,660
to ease the people's discontent.

561
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,790
Your Majesty,

562
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,680
I don't agree with Fu Heng's opinion.

563
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,160
What's your opinion?

564
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,800
Fu Heng is too young.

565
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,000
Forging ahead valorously is good.

566
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,610
But you don't understand
how custom houses work.

567
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,780
An Ning has 68 Yamen runners...

568
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,940
and 79 folks in his household.

569
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,960
These people needed
to assist in running the custom house,

570
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,820
but their names
were not included in the court list.

571
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,220
An Ning increased the tax rate...

572
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,940
to compensate cost in this regard.

573
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,920
Can he raise tax rate
at will for compensation?

574
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,180
Do you know that...

575
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,080
An Ning reduced
the burden of the custom house...

576
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,400
but in return he increased
the burden of the people?

577
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,930
If everyone follows him...

578
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:37,260
by adding taxes at will,

579
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,860
how can the people endure?

580
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,770
Lord Fu,

581
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,040
while skilled in fighting battles,

582
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,520
you are inexperienced in state affairs.

583
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,920
Water that is too clear has few fish.

584
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,040
Are you saying all the Yamen runners...

585
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,570
are supposed to live on air?

586
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,130
Stop arguing.

587
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,080
Even if An Ning had his circumstances,

588
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,750
he is indeed guilty.

589
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,280
I will issue a decree
to rebuke him harshly.

590
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,750
But the situation
in Xushuguan is complicated.

591
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:10,880
It's not suitable to replace him,

592
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,010
He'll hold the post for the time being.

593
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,500
If he continues to do so,

594
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,890
I will punish him severely.

595
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,240
-Your Majesty is sage.
-Your Majesty.

596
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,700
Kneel and bid me farewell.

597
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:24,970
-Brother, I take my leave.
-Your Majesty, I take my leave.

598
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,970
Prince He, even if you hate me,

599
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,880
you shouldn't use
a vermin like An Ning to go against me.

600
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,970
Didn't I say?

601
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:39,400
An Ning has his circumstances.

602
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,240
An Ning stashed away six farm fields...

603
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,080
and over 100 hectares of farm land.

604
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,080
Prince He,

605
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,220
you don't know about that yet, right?

606
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,560
You did a very good job
in the Jiangnan corruption case.

607
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,620
I am delighted
to see you're willing to work seriously.

608
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,660
I didn't reveal that earlier...

609
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,680
It's because I didn't want you to...

610
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,010
experience a setback and collapse again.

611
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,120
You think...

612
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,360
I would be grateful to you?

613
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,800
I don't want your gratitude.

614
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:11,909
This is my last time.

615
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,840
Please do not use national affairs...

616
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,679
as a game to target me.

617
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,360
You must remember...

618
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,820
you are Great Qing's Prince He.

619
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:24,070
You need to take on
heavy responsibilities.

620
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,360
At any time,

621
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:28,000
if you neglect logic
over personal venting,

622
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,719
you will be despised.

623
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,460
Little Young Master!

624
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,150
Come.

625
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,600
Are you okay?

626
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,850
An!

627
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,630
-An!
-Little Young Master!

628
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,440
Qing Lian, how dare you
harm Little Young Master?

629
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,640
-Servants!
-Hurry, servants!

630
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,920
-Come here.
-Young Mistress.

631
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,710
-Arrest Qing Lian!
-Yes!

632
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,840
Young Master, Qing Lian was
taken away by Old Mistress...

633
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:35,100
after pushing Little Young Master
into the goldfish pond.

634
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,860
Mother, where is Qing Lian?

635
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,850
I thought that Qing Lian...

636
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,380
was good-looking and gentle,

637
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,370
so I planned to promote her.

638
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,790
I didn't expect...

639
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,840
she had such a vicious motive...

640
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,920
to push An into the water!

641
00:35:58,510 --> 00:35:59,720
Qing Lian wouldn't do that.

642
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,870
Everyone in the garden saw it,

643
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,800
but you're still defending her?

644
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:06,000
Where is she now?

645
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,430
I sold her.

646
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,400
Mother is speaking out of anger.

647
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,570
Mother is always kind to the servants.

648
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,530
Even if Qing Lian was wrong,

649
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,250
we merely
told her family to take her back.

650
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,260
-Really?
-If Er Qing didn't speak on her behalf,

651
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,590
she would've been beaten to death.

652
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,700
She wouldn't have lasted until now.

653
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,960
I'm tired.

654
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,640
Help me return to my room to rest.

655
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,080
Qing Lian wouldn't harm An.

656
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:49,800
Fu Heng,

657
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,540
you really don't understand women.

658
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,300
As Qing Lian grows older,

659
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,940
it's likely for her
to develop an ulterior motive.

660
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,770
Now we've sent her out...

661
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,320
to allow her parents
to marry her off. Isn't that good?

662
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:04,710
Is it?

663
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,330
As long as you don't intend
to take her as your concubine,

664
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:09,850
I will never torment her.

665
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:12,470
I will even give a dowry to her...

666
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,750
to pay..

667
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:15,930
for her devotion to you.

668
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:23,000
As long as you're willing
to lead a peaceful life with me,

669
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,260
I am willing to change my temperament...

670
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:27,100
until you're satisfied.

671
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,420
I guarantee.

672
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,140
Fine,

673
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,360
give a dowry to her.

674
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,680
Play ball with me, Father.

675
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,640
It's not far enough.

676
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,760
Harder.

677
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,800
An.

678
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,490
Turns out you are here.

679
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,640
An, take the ball...

680
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,050
and play it by yourself.

681
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,130
Play with me.

682
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,410
I have to go to the Yamen.

683
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:30,690
I'll play with you when I return.

684
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,480
Okay, I will wait for you here.

685
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:45,480
Young Mistress, you are so resourceful.

686
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,600
Young Master is treating you...

687
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,500
much gentler than before.

688
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,290
My Lord.

689
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,630
My Lord, take care.

690
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:16,690
Lord Fu Heng,

691
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,260
you really won't join us...

692
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:20,110
for a drink here?

693
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,650
You two can have a drink,

694
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,930
but you mustn't drink at a brothel.

695
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,640
My Lord, you are joking.

696
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,740
With strict restrictions
set out in Great Qing's laws,

697
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:32,550
we don't want to
get 60 strokes of flogging!

698
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,520
Besides, even if we want
to drink at a brothel,

699
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,460
where can we go?

700
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,020
Indeed.

701
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,900
With bans issued by His Majesty,

702
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:45,150
all the brothels in the capital
are about to disappear.

703
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,350
Don't worry, my Lord.

704
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,240
We'll just have a drink here.

705
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,760
My Lord,  thank you for your escort.

706
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,830
It's on my way.

707
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,840
Let's go.

708
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,800
Take care.

709
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,260
Make way...

710
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,810
Until next time, Lord Fu Heng.

711
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:11,640
Lord Fu Heng is so young,
but he's so old-fashioned.

712
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,830
Boring. So boring.

713
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,980
My Lord, this way.

714
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,140
After you.

715
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,650
Stop there!

716
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:26,170
You, stop right there!

717
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,090
Stop!

718
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,280
Come here.

719
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:33,220
-How dare you run away?
-Stop the carriage!

720
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,660
You really got a nerve.

721
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,390
Run?

722
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,940
-How dare you run?
-Stop!

723
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,440
Sir, you don't know the situation.

724
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,520
She's a girl in our inn.

725
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,160
But she's disobedient,
so we're giving her a lesson.

726
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,880
-Inn?
-There are many tea houses and inns here.

727
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,800
Some of them run...

728
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,120
[Fuca]

729
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,880
illegal prostitution businesses.

730
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,950
Get lost.

731
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:55,060
Let's go.

732
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:57,200
Didn't you see the "Fuca" clan insignia...

733
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,150
on his carriage?

734
00:40:58,790 --> 00:40:59,550
[Fuca]

735
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,620
Let's go! Hurry!

736
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,500
Give some money to her.

737
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:15,260
Take the money and see a doctor.

738
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,440
What's wrong? You don't want the money?

739
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,350
You don't want money? Take it.

740
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,780
Qing Lian?

741
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:33,520
Dress her and bind up her wound.

742
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,420
-Don't ask questions.
-Yes.

743
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,950
Young Master.

744
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,160
Didn't I tell you investigate clearly?

745
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,380
How did this happen?

746
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,520
Young Mistress selected
a good partner for Qing Lian.

747
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,360
I saw that she went into
the bridal sedan chair,

748
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,660
so I was relieved.

749
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,840
But as soon as...

750
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,360
the wedding sedan left the city gate,
she was transferred into a small sedan.

751
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,430
Then she was sent into
the illegal prostitution inn.

752
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:00,840
Qing Lian couldn't bear the humiliation.

753
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,800
She kept getting beaten
and tortured severely.

754
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:08,300
It is due to my oversight.

755
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,250
Qing Lian!

756
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,000
Oh no! Qing Lian swallowed gold
to commit suicide!

757
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,120
Someone come!

758
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,200
Someone!

759
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,640
Help!

760
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:31,170
Qing Lian,

761
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:34,080
I know the three words "I am sorry"...

762
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,610
only hold meaning if there is true amends.

763
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,490
I will not never forgive...

764
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,080
those that harmed you.

765
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:45,130
I will take care of...

766
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,470
your family.

767
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,080
If you have other wishes,

768
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,700
I will get them accomplished.

769
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:56,070
Young Master.

770
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:58,570
Young Master.

771
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,710
Qing Lian.

772
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:02,470
What do you want to say?

773
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:06,540
I am too filthy...

774
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:09,090
to see you again.

775
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,900
This isn't your fault.

776
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:13,870
Every time I call you Young Master,

777
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:16,990
your gaze would always become tender.

778
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:20,470
At first,

779
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,130
I harboured hope too.

780
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:28,040
But,

781
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,540
I suddenly realised it one day.

782
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,360
What you wanted to hear...

783
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,120
was only the two words, "Young Master".

784
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,850
Am I right?

785
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:45,000
All along,

786
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:49,370
many thought I was yours.

787
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,190
But they were all wrong.

788
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,910
There is only one person...

789
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,340
in your heart at all times.

790
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,140
You never held anyone else in your heart.

791
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,580
Young Master.

792
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:07,660
I...

793
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,830
I only have one wish now.

794
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,300
Can you...

795
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:18,290
hold my hand?
