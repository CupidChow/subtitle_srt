[Episode 5]

3
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,800
Delicious.

4
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:04,400
Eat all these here before leaving.

5
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,740
Your Highness, you are too kind!

6
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:13,510
You don't even mind that
I've eaten so much.

7
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:16,120
Thank you, Your Highness.

8
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,940
Looks like she's really a stupid one.

9
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:25,250
Quickly make her leave. She's annoying me.

10
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:28,940
That's enough, stop eating.
Her Highness wants you to leave.

11
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,800
I still haven't finished eating!

12
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,710
Take it and leave with it!

13
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,540
Ask the Imperial Household Department...

14
00:02:37,579 --> 00:02:40,710
what kind of people are they hiring now?

15
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,140
Isn't that person mentally-impaired?

16
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:49,040
Your Highness, I don't think so.

17
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:56,460
Do you mean she's pretending to be dumb?

18
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:02,660
We'll know by sending
someone to monitor her.

19
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,480
Silly.

20
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,850
Are you at ease now?

21
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,260
Being careful will allow you to
sail a boat for thousands of years.

22
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,200
I'm tired too.

23
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,160
You can withdraw.

24
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,950
Yes.

25
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,350
Your Highness, rest well. I shall leave.

26
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,220
What's wrong, Your Highness?

27
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:50,140
I don't know why,
but I keep feeling something is off.

28
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:54,740
Your Highness, you're still suspecting
that Wei Ying Luo pretends to be dumb?

29
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:00,250
If she is pretending,
then she's someone to watch out for.

30
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,660
Who doesn't know to pretend to be dumb?

31
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,130
Upon entering, she tripped.

32
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,600
She started talking in a silly manner.

33
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,130
This made Noble Consort assume
that she's mentally-impaired.

34
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:19,240
But the problem is, Noble Consort hadn't
even started to interrogate her yet.

35
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:23,600
I don't understand.

36
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:29,520
How long it takes for you to walk
from the Embroidery Workshop to here?

37
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,020
She has guessed that Noble Consort
is planning to give her trouble.

38
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,880
She then immediately
thought of a countermeasure.

39
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,270
It's not hard to pretend to be dumb.

40
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:41,350
What's hard is to dissipate
the anger of Noble Consort.

41
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:46,390
Those seven bowls of lotus-root
powder balls just came in very handy.

42
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,610
It's so late.

43
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,380
Why is Ying Luo still not back?

44
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,930
Did something bad happen to her?

45
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,360
No, I must go check.

46
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,430
Where are you going?

47
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,320
It's the Chuxiu Palace.
You don't want to live?

48
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,500
Ying Luo helped me before,
how could I just leave her?

49
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,220
Ji Xiang, you are really silly.

50
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,270
Does she need to spend
such a long time in Chuxiu Palace?

51
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:42,460
In my opinion, she might have gone dating.

52
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:45,370
Jin Xiu, this is the Forbidden City.

53
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:48,670
At night, the ones left are just
palace maids and eunuchs.

54
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,170
Who will Ying Luo be romantically meeting?

55
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:54,220
Other than the Emperor,
there are other men too.

56
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,909
The four Imperial guards
at the Qianqing Gates.

57
00:05:56,909 --> 00:05:59,909
The Report Officer at the Yuehua Gates.

58
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,770
The two Imperial physicians
in the Imperial Pharmacy.

59
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:06,090
That's seven men.
There must be one who's meeting her.

60
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,630
Shut up!

61
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,580
If you continue to spout rubbish,
I'll rip your mouth!

62
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,980
Did I say anything wrong?

63
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,950
Last time she wouldn't let
us see the Imperial Guards,

64
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,400
while she secretly went out
to have a date now.

65
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,100
She thinks we don't have eyes?

66
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,150
She's still not back.

67
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,220
Good thing that Madam Fang is sleeping.

68
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,080
Or else, she would be dead!

69
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,770
You're still talking!

70
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,320
-Are you crazy?
-Enough! Stop hitting!

71
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:37,140
Ying Luo might be in
big trouble this time.

72
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:41,530
Ling Long, what did you say?

73
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:43,590
This afternoon,

74
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,300
I saw Sister Zhi Lan's face
and it was so scary.

75
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:50,320
Ying Luo might have
got into big trouble...

76
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,360
and can never return.

77
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,409
What?

78
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,270
Ying Luo's back. She's fine.

79
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,910
Ying Luo.

80
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,560
Ying Luo.

81
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,550
Let's sleep.

82
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:17,360
Ji Xiang, see, I wasn't wrong.

83
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,660
Someone is guilty.

84
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,160
She heard it, but isn't talking.

85
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,820
She indeed has a lover.

86
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:28,890
-You're still at it!
-I didn't say anything wrong.

87
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:30,500
Let's sleep.

88
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:54,720
You go first.

89
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:17,490
Ying Luo, you two are not leaving?

90
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,630
No rush, Ling Long and
I haven't finished eating.

91
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,450
I'll get going then.

92
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,720
Ying Luo, I need to go to the
Embroidery Workshop now.

93
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:46,350
Ling Long, I kept thinking
on my way back last night.

94
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:51,000
Who could have leaked this
secret to the Noble Consort?

95
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,800
How would I know?

96
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,250
If you really don't know,

97
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,480
you should have asked what secret is that.

98
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:08,180
Even if you don't tell me, I know.

99
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:11,470
That day, you were in Yonghe Palace.

100
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:15,870
Yesterday, you and Ji Xiang even
went out to deliver the spring clothes.

101
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,930
Other than you, who else could it be?

102
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,780
Ying Luo...

103
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,620
-Ying Luo, listen to me.
-What?

104
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,990
You want Noble Consort Gao to
kill me so you can vent your anger?

105
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:29,650
Or you want to tell me
the jealousy in your heart?

106
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:34,220
Ying Luo, I admit it.

107
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,260
I didn't watch my mouth, but I...

108
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,380
Do you know why I didn't confront
you when I returned last night?

109
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,480
Because I was too full that it hurt.

110
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:50,120
Last night, I ate many bowls
of lotus-root powder balls.

111
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:55,550
Ying Luo, what do you want to do?

112
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,710
Eat it.

113
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:02,960
What is this?

114
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,490
The lotus-root powder balls
that I brought home last night.

115
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,110
Don't worry, these were not vomited up.

116
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:16,170
Ying Luo, we are good sisters that
entered into the palace together.

117
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,990
Yes! Good sisters!

118
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,870
We should share all
fortunes and misfortunes.

119
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,540
Hence, eat it.

120
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,190
I'm not eating!

121
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:32,600
Eat it!

122
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,210
You like to tell on others
behind their backs.

123
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:39,650
If I don't block your mouth,
you will do it again.

124
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:45,140
Eat it!

125
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,890
Someone, come here!

126
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:49,370
Shout!

127
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,200
Make it louder and let everyone hear it.

128
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:56,640
Madam Zhang hates talkative
people the most anyway.

129
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,410
Be careful or she'll cut off your tongue!

130
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,480
I don't know any grand principles.

131
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,360
I just know if people don't offend me,
I won't bother them either.

132
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,420
If you don't finish this bowl today,
don't even think of going out this door.

133
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,360
Eat it!

134
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,510
If you still don't eat them,
I'll inform Madam Zhang that...

135
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,320
you've associated with Chuxiu Palace,

136
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,850
the workshop can't
accommodate you anymore.

137
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:40,120
You mustn't vomit one out!

138
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:52,790
Ling Long, just directly
tell me if you envy me.

139
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,720
We can openly compete through
embroidery to determine the victor.

140
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,960
Resorting to underhanded tactics
because you fear of losing...

141
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,090
will only make others look down on you.

142
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:03,380
Hope that this bowl of
lotus-root powder balls today...

143
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,950
can seal your mouth and
make you remember this lesson.

144
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,500
-Ying Luo.
-Madam.

145
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,050
How is your illness?

146
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,360
The sun has risen from the west.

147
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,800
My back was almost broken because of you.

148
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,520
You still dare to come here?

149
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:39,910
Madam,

150
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,380
I've always felt guilty about this matter
and want to make up for it,

151
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,340
but we're too busy in
the Embroidery Workshop.

152
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,060
Today, I finally got some free time.

153
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,570
No need.

154
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:52,170
I'll just slowly make you pay for it.

155
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,860
That is in the future.

156
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,740
Just let me help now.

157
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:01,290
-Sister Bing Qing, let me do it.
-No need, just leave it to me.

158
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,890
Give it to me.

159
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,580
Wei Ying Luo!

160
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,980
Madam, sorry! I didn't mean to!

161
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,040
You evil servant, leave!

162
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,310
How about I accompany
you to clean your clothes?

163
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:15,180
No need! Just get out!

164
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,200
Sorry, I really didn't mean it.

165
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:30,340
[Other than sister's knot,
could there be other clues?]

166
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,270
What are you doing?

167
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:48,470
How dare you steal things in my room?

168
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,340
You're finally caught red-handed now.

169
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:54,010
Madam, what are you saying?

170
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:56,370
Didn't your clothes get wet earlier?

171
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:59,490
I was looking for new clothes to give you.

172
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,370
-Look.
-Put down the clothes and get out!

173
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:10,240
-How about I help you to put them on?
-Get out!

174
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,520
[When sister left the palace,
she didn't have any items with her.]

175
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,000
[All her things were gone.]

176
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:24,000
[If she took them,
where could she have placed them?]

177
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:28,250
You don't know?
She came back so late last night.

178
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:31,210
-Didn't she go to Chuxiu Palace?
-I don't know.

179
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:34,560
You're silly, she went for a date.

180
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,040
-Who?
-A date?

181
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:39,540
Her lover is an Imperial Guard
here in the Forbidden Palace.

182
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,610
Is that true?

183
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:44,280
You mustn't make
groundless accusations like that.

184
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,340
Who's making groundless accusations?
I saw it myself.

185
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:50,580
If a maid gets involved in a scandal
and Chief Wu learns of it,

186
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,180
she'll get flogged to death.

187
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:54,760
My eyes are not only for display.

188
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,080
Tell us about it.

189
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,850
Madam Fang went there
to catch them last time.

190
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,250
She was too cunning that
she's able to escape.

191
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,130
Next time, if you...

192
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,940
Ying Luo.

193
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:09,350
Come over here.

194
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:17,770
What's there to be afraid of?
We didn't say anything wrong.

195
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:20,310
I guess she won't be
able to return anymore.

196
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,370
Ying Luo, everyone is saying that
you have an Imperial Guard as a lover.

197
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,570
Is there such a thing?

198
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:35,330
Madam, do you believe rumours like that?

199
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:39,250
Of course I don't,
but rumours get spread as it's true.

200
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,430
The damaging effects
of rumors is quite huge.

201
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,190
It's better that you be careful.

202
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:47,790
I'm only doing the right thing,
there's nothing to be afraid of.

203
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:54,120
I just fear that the rumors will get worse
as they spread and get out of control.

204
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,640
If it reaches the ears of Chief Wu,

205
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:59,250
I won't be able to help you then.

206
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:05,100
These things I'm telling you
are backed by evidence.

207
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,410
Thank you for warning me.

208
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,320
Ying Luo, let's quickly go.

209
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,490
Let's go.

210
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,650
Those are materials
for the pottery workshop.

211
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:29,830
Stop looking, let's quickly go.

212
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,100
I just couldn't embroider a sunset cloud.
This is so annoying.

213
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:47,690
Although Ying Luo has a bad temper,

214
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:50,510
her embroidery skills are indeed superb.

215
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,800
Or else, Madam won't
favour her that much.

216
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:57,200
It shows that she is truly capable.

217
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:01,260
Are you saying that I'm not skilled?

218
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:06,650
Jin Xiu, I'm praising Ying Luo.
What does that have to do with you?

219
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:11,930
So what if she's skilled? She keeps
having affairs with Imperial Guard.

220
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:16,450
One day, she will fail.

221
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,319
What's the use of just saying it?

222
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:20,960
Where's your evidence?

223
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:25,990
Don't worry, I surely will get some.

224
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,570
You do not know?

225
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:06,220
Madam Fang, stop making it hard on me.

226
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:09,080
I really don't know.

227
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,830
Do you really not know,
or afraid of Ying Luo and dare not say?

228
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:22,530
Madam, Ling Long doesn't know, but I know.

229
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,680
You know?

230
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,170
Last night, I personally saw
Ying Luo left our dormitory...

231
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:31,900
and only returned around dawn.
She must have gone to meet her lover.

232
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,340
You didn't follow her to have a look?

233
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:37,760
Madam, I wasn't able to catch up with her.

234
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:45,400
Ling Long, last time when
she met that Imperial Guard,

235
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,680
what did he look like?

236
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,180
Do you still remember?

237
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,390
No, I don't remember anymore.

238
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,440
Don't worry, just this one time.

239
00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:00,380
From now on, I won't bother you anymore.

240
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,070
I'm unable to describe it.

241
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,940
But if you let me see him,
I surely can recognise him.

242
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,870
That's easy, I'll let Yu Jie
take you to identify him.

243
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,290
No, you must not.

244
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,790
This...

245
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,370
Without any evidences,
how could I just go and point him out?

246
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:20,860
Ling Long, it's fine.
Just go and identify him.

247
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:26,070
Once you do it, your task with me is done.

248
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:31,290
Okay, treat it as me helping you.

249
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,880
But I will only identify the person.

250
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:39,490
As for other matters,
I dare not get involved anymore.

251
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:45,550
Don't you worry.
For this matter, I have my plans.

252
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:48,020
You won't get involved.

253
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,800
Are you sure?

254
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,400
It was indeed that person Ling Long said.

255
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:59,690
Was he in the palace last night?

256
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,920
The Imperial Guards go on duty
every five days.

257
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,380
Last night, he was indeed on
duty guarding the Qianqing Gates.

258
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:12,980
It's like having a sore behind one's head.
She thinks that everyone else is blind!

259
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:17,660
If there's a first time,
then there will be a second time.

260
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:20,200
She'll get into trouble sooner or later.

261
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:22,400
Just you wait!

262
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:42,730
Qing Xi, you're something.

263
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,730
You're able to flirt with the beautiful
palace maid without even making a sound!

264
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:48,990
The rules forbid us from
having affairs with palace maids.

265
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,050
As long as nobody notices,

266
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,010
the maids will be sent out eventually.

267
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,900
Just marry her in the future
if you like her.

268
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,920
She'll just be the concubine,
so what's the fear?

269
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:01,900
But taking in concubines,
you must still consider her background.

270
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,220
Lord Fu Heng.

271
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,940
Hand the item out.

272
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,730
Lord Fu Heng, I...

273
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,440
A palace maid and an imperial guard
must not exchange items.

274
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,300
This is the palace rule.

275
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,460
You should have known it
on your first day here.

276
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,870
She gave you a stone?

277
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,890
This means that her heart is like a stone.

278
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:33,310
You got rejected!

279
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,460
Is it funny?

280
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:38,770
Hold it.

281
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,620
Everyone must recite the
Imperial Guard rules one hundred times.

282
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:44,080
Yes.

283
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,000
Lord Fu Heng! We're innocent!

284
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,970
Fu Heng, do you think
he had been falsely accused?

285
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:52,770
How could anyone gift someone a stone?

286
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:58,440
[What does Ying Luo mean by this?]

287
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,460
I told you to monitor her,
but it's already three months.

288
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:23,870
You just keep telling me
these minor things.

289
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:27,670
Madam, Wei Ying Luo is a crafty person.

290
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,220
I'm unable to catch any
of her weaknesses now.

291
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:35,860
That is because you're silly.

292
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,640
Then, how about you personally try it?

293
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,830
Don't you dare challenge me.

294
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:49,650
My back will recover soon.

295
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,910
I will deal with her then.

296
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:54,150
Watch her closely!

297
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,170
Yes.

298
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:59,190
It's done, let's eat.

299
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,560
We're eating these again?

300
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,710
I want to eat fish.

301
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,690
If we smell like fish when
we walk in front of our masters,

302
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:12,140
be careful of getting caned, quickly eat.

303
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,600
I'm just thinking about it.
Can't I do that too?

304
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,520
What's going on with her?

305
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,500
Ying Luo, are you alright?

306
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:41,990
Do you have a stomach ache?

307
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:46,570
My sister-in-law was like that
when got pregnant last time.

308
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:48,740
I'm fine.

309
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,680
It's just that I'm not feeling well...

310
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,520
after eating so many
lotus-root powder balls.

311
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,120
For people like us,
we'd better just endure it.

312
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:02,750
Okay, just make the same for her.

313
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,910
Ji Xiang.

314
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,360
Let me see.

315
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,700
Look, you've grown bigger again.

316
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,440
We've just done your summer clothes.

317
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:17,330
You probably won't be able to wear it now.

318
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:21,410
We would eat up to eighty-percent full.

319
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,240
Unlike her, eating with so much fun.
How can she not get fat?

320
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,650
Eat less.

321
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:30,320
You'll get caned if you can't
properly bow in front of masters.

322
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,120
Other measurements are the same.

323
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,440
I'm hungry.

324
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:36,150
Ying Luo, come. Let me see.

325
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,810
The sleeves are the same.

326
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,380
Ying Luo.

327
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:51,670
How come your waist is an inch larger?

328
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:53,620
Did you get fat?

329
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,330
I...

330
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:58,320
How is that possible?

331
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:02,370
Ying Luo recently will
vomit out food she eats.

332
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,200
She totally can't eat anything.

333
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,730
Didn't you say you got indigestion
after eating lotus-root powder balls?

334
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:13,200
I have some medicines for indigestion.
Get them from me later.

335
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,110
Thank you, Madam.

336
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,590
Sewing this way is quite pretty.
Just do that then.

337
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:23,540
Madam said we must rush
the spring clothes for the palace...

338
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,070
before we do ours.

339
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:29,740
Hence, let's just alter the ones
in the stockroom as for now.

340
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,750
-Here you go.
-This looks brand new.

341
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:35,830
Thank you.

342
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,950
-Look if this fits me.
-I guess so.

343
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:41,870
-This part is a bit tight.
-Yes, it is indeed.

344
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,750
Isn't it too long?

345
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,370
Let me see.

346
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:55,050
Let me see.

347
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,430
Let me see.

348
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,650
Madam.

349
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:17,310
Good! That is really getting caught
with both human and material evidences!

350
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,620
Where are they?

351
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,570
Wei Ying Luo.

352
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:36,160
Someone reported that you have
committed a scandalous act.

353
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,620
Do you admit to your crime?

354
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:40,210
May I ask who is the complainant?

355
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,860
It's me.

356
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:44,050
What scandalous act?

357
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,530
You even have the nerve to ask?

358
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:50,740
You have an affair with Imperial
Guard and got pregnant out of wedlock.

359
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,500
Where's your evidence?

360
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:55,640
Jin Xiu is the witness.

361
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:01,970
As for the material evidence,
we'll know after taking off your clothes.

362
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,460
Chief Wu, Madam Fang
has always disliked me.

363
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,710
Do you believe her words?

364
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,630
Are you denying it then?

365
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:13,890
Of course, I will never admit
something that is non-existent.

366
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:15,950
It's fine whether you admit it or not.

367
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:18,330
Just remove her clothes and you'll know.

368
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:21,570
Her stomach is quite big!

369
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:31,870
Wei Ying Luo, just honestly
confess if you really did it.

370
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:35,480
So you won't be more
embarrassed after the examination.

371
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,250
I told you...

372
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,510
I didn't do it, so I will never admit.

373
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,670
Debauchery in the palace
must be caned to death.

374
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:47,480
Chief Wu, don't waste time talking to her.

375
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:49,750
Immediately have someone check on her.

376
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,870
-Madam Zhang.
-Yes.

377
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,630
No way.

378
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,780
Ying Luo is the favourite
maid of Madam Zhang.

379
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:01,110
This makes it unfair.

380
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,830
Madam Yan, you go with Madam Zhang.

381
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,240
Yes.

382
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,710
Ying Luo, let's go.

383
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,770
Wait.

384
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,750
You want to plead for mercy now?
It's too late.

385
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,570
Chief Wu, even though we're palace maids,

386
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,780
we still came from good families.

387
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,660
My reputation just got tainted like that.

388
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,890
If it was other people,
they would be committing suicide by now.

389
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:39,970
This complainant clearly wants me dead.

390
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,610
Let me ask then.

391
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:45,900
If I were proven to be not guilty,
how should the complainant be handled?

392
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:49,500
The palace has its rules.

393
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:52,970
People who make groundless accusations...

394
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:56,770
would get caned and expelled
from the Forbidden City!

395
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:59,840
Okay, it's a deal then.

396
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:17,730
Just wait to watch a good act.

397
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:21,410
What's going on?

398
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:26,360
Look at her.

399
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:30,350
Here they come.

400
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,220
Madam Yan, she did
a scandalous act, right?

401
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,030
I didn't falsely accuse her.

402
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,390
Madam Yan, did you examine her properly?

403
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,170
We did.

404
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,910
Tell us.

405
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,480
Miss Wei's stomach
indeed has grown bigger.

406
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,300
See? What did I say?

407
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,190
She really did a scandalous act?

408
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:04,710
I told you so,
she always behaves sneakily.

409
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:07,250
So she was out for romantic rendezvous.

410
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,860
So what if her embroidery skills are good?

411
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:11,720
With such an immoral character,
she brings shame to us!

412
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,710
That's impossible!

413
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,620
-Ying Luo isn't that kind of person.
-Why is it impossible?

414
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:20,580
The matter has come so far.
Even God can't save her now. Stop it.

415
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:25,840
In my opinion, punish people like her
by cutting into pieces isn't enough.

416
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,720
Stop being noisy!

417
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:30,800
Wei Ying Luo is a virgin.

418
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,030
What did you say?

419
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:38,870
Chief Wu, I said that Wei Ying Luo
is innocent and still a virgin.

420
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:42,470
I told you so. It's impossible
for her to have done such things.

421
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:46,090
Her stomach is already big.
How could she still be a virgin?

422
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,800
Jin Xiu, you clearly saw
her stomach being big, right?

423
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:53,650
That's right, Chief Wu,
I personally saw it.

424
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,400
Ying Luo kept saying
that she has indigestion.

425
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,540
She always feels bloated but
you all didn't believe her.

426
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,810
Impossible! I'm not silly.

427
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,710
I have seen pregnant women.

428
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:07,880
Her stomach has grown a lot bigger
and she frequently vomits!

429
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,100
Also, when she was
changing her clothes that day,

430
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,360
I personally saw it. How could it be fake?

431
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,350
Shut your mouth, you are a liar!

432
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:18,050
You even pretend to be
experienced in front of me?

433
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:19,810
-How many women have you seen...
-I...

434
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:23,150
that you dare to conclude she's pregnant?

435
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:25,780
I've been in the palace for thirty years.

436
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:28,210
How many maids have I seen?

437
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,160
Won't I be able to discern
a pregnant woman?

438
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:33,700
That's now what I meant.

439
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:36,500
You didn't mean it that way?
What do you mean then?

440
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,880
A good and respectable lady...

441
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:43,120
was splashed by you two with dirty water,
such an immoral act!

442
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:46,140
Those palace rumors before...

443
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,760
were being spread in such a vivid manner.

444
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,560
I also thought they're true.

445
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:53,390
It now looks like rumours
were spread by you two.

446
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,080
So shameless!

447
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:08,000
Chief Wu, the truth is now out.

448
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:10,240
I was proven to be innocent.

449
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,810
Please deal with those people
harbouring evil intentions.

450
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:16,430
Chief Wu, there must be something wrong.

451
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,130
It's impossible that she's not pregnant!

452
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,800
I don't believe it.

453
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:24,720
Madam Fang, the truth
is right in front of us.

454
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,510
It's fine if you don't trust Madam Zhang.

455
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:30,710
Madam Yan has been working
in the palace for thirty years.

456
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:32,640
She's more experienced in woman matters...

457
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,240
than the supervisors of
Imperial Academy of Medicine.

458
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:39,230
Several pairs of eyes saw it.

459
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,800
Wei Ying Luo was indeed falsely accused.

460
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:46,420
As an Administrator Madam,
you have done such a shameful act.

461
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:51,200
Chief Wu, I believed the lies of Jin Xiu.

462
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,280
I didn't know that she's sick!

463
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:56,370
Chief Wu, it's not like that!

464
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,380
Madam Fang, how could
you blame everything on me?

465
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:01,370
It was you who told
me to monitor Ying Luo.

466
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:04,370
It's all your fault!
You said that she's pregnant!

467
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,120
You said it with confirmation.

468
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,760
Or else, I wouldn't have taken
the bait and got fooled by her!

469
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,110
Chief Wu, it's not like that!

470
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,600
It's Madam Fang who
bears a grudge towards Ying Luo!

471
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:19,429
-She wants to take revenge! I'm innocent!
-This servant...

472
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:20,920
You dare spout rubbish?

473
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,920
-You dare spout rubbish? Say it again!
-I'm not saying rubbish!

474
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:26,429
Enough!

475
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:28,620
You two stop it!

476
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:32,850
-Enough! Stop fighting! So unruly.
-I'm not lying!

477
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:36,920
Chief Wu, I really was ordered by Madam.

478
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:39,469
I didn't do anything.

479
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:42,239
Chief Wu,

480
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:44,550
she made up a story.

481
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,659
That's why I had misunderstanding.

482
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:51,810
Right, this is a misunderstanding.
Chief Wu, this is just a misunderstanding!

483
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:56,110
Wei Ying Luo, you are the victim.

484
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,250
What do you say?

485
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,720
Ying Luo, I was wrong.

486
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:07,340
It was all my fault.

487
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,120
I was too harsh.

488
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,770
Please don't blame me, it's all her fault.

489
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,510
She sowed discord between us!

490
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,650
You are a good lady while
she's the evil one!

491
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:21,670
Ying Luo, don't listen to her.

492
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,650
She only wants you to forgive her.

493
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:26,200
-I'm not making up things!
-You know me well as we're batchmates.

494
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,370
You know that I'm a coward.

495
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:31,510
For such a huge matter,
I dare not plan it by myself!

496
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:34,530
Ying Luo, I would never do such a thing!
It's all her!

497
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,750
-You are still talking?
-Shut up!

498
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,610
No matter it's inside
or outside the palace,

499
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:51,630
how many people have
been destroyed by gossips?

500
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,230
You want to easily pass this
off as a misunderstanding?

501
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,620
It won't be that easy.

502
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,980
As for Jin Xiu, she was just
a lackey and an accomplice.

503
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,310
This isn't the first time you act to
harm others just to benefit yourself.

504
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:11,210
This time, I have nothing more to say.

505
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,180
Chief Wu, I've long heard that...

506
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,720
you're fair in rewarding and punishing
while following the rules strictly.

507
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,530
If others follow
Madam Fang in the future,

508
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,780
by framing other people,

509
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:28,000
and then slapping own mouth
as if nothing happened,

510
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:32,210
then there will be no discipline
at all in this huge Forbidden City.

511
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,870
Have you two heard it clearly?

512
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:39,450
This is the Forbidden City.

513
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,780
If everyone follows you two,

514
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,770
this palace will have turned upside down.

515
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,750
Men!

516
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,760
Palace maid Jin Xiu envied
a colleague and sowed discord.

517
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:54,830
-She will be caned 20 times and demoted.
-No.

518
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:56,520
No, Chief Wu!

519
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:57,770
Take her away!

520
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:01,620
No! Chief Wu!

521
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,920
No! Chief Wu! I was wrong!

522
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,430
As for palace maid Fang Ni Zi,

523
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,920
she gave false evidence against others
and committed offenses with her speech.

524
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:15,890
Cane her 40 times and
expel her from the palace!

525
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:21,130
Chief Wu, no!

526
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:23,290
Chief Wu!

527
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:28,710
Chief Wu!

528
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:34,840
What place is the palace?
You people dare to create rumours?

529
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:38,510
Whoever dares to gossip
or create trouble again,

530
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,700
your ending will be like them!

531
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:41,910
Yes!

532
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:43,830
Yes!

533
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:48,140
I'm so busy. How dare you invite
me to handle such a mess?

534
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,870
-Madam Zhang.
-Yes.

535
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:55,360
Make sure you discipline
these palace maids of yours.

536
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,360
Yes.

537
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:12,970
Madam, Chief Wu gave a little leniency
and allowed you to pack your things.

538
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:15,560
You have to leave the palace in an hour.

539
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:18,210
It's all your doing.

540
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:24,940
If not because of you, I would be able
to leave the palace after six months.

541
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:30,060
Now that I got expelled,
I not only lose my compensation,

542
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:33,000
even my family won't dare to accept me.

543
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:37,220
How is this my fault?
It's all a misunderstanding.

544
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:45,430
Just tell me the truth...

545
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:48,330
behind your stomach?

546
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:53,180
You two kept spreading rumors
about me in the palace.

547
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,060
You caused me to have
no place to hide myself from shame.

548
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,190
The best way to eliminate rumours...

549
00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:01,500
is to escalate the matter and
let people know the truth.

550
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:05,860
But how could I get you all to believe me?

551
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,330
First, I must rendezvous often.

552
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:12,910
I would make sure that you don't catch me.
You'd get anxious after a few times.

553
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:17,820
Second, how could I fool others
without a real bulging abdomen?

554
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:23,170
Hence, I asked for some kaolin
clay from the pottery craftsman.

555
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,600
If you take it in small amount,
it won't kill but can bloat your stomach.

556
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,400
I only looked a bit similar,
but you took the bait.

557
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:33,070
You just can't wait to eliminate me.

558
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,880
You're evil!

559
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:37,120
You are like your older sister.

560
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,280
A naturally-born lowly wretch!

561
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:42,340
You finally admitted that
you knew my sister!

562
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:45,370
Say it! How did my sister die?

563
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,940
-Why is her knot accessory with you?
-I...

564
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:50,950
I don't know.

565
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,560
You really won't say it?

566
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,900
Chief Wu got fooled earlier.

567
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,640
He actually planned to
let you leave with nothing.

568
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,900
If I inform him now the usual crimes
you do against the palace maids,

569
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,060
what would he do to you?

570
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,430
Don't tell him.

571
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:09,140
Do you still remember
that white ceramic pot?

572
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:11,590
It is a layer of soil on top.

573
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:15,120
What's hidden under that
is my sister's ashes.

574
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,490
I brought her into the palace
to seek justice for her!

575
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,040
Say it! Tell me how did my sister die?

576
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:26,350
How did she die?
Did it have something to do with you?

577
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:28,910
I really don't know.

578
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:34,400
Please don't go!

579
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,120
I only know...

580
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:40,910
that your sister committed a mistake
and was expelled from the palace.

581
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:45,890
She gave me that knotted
accessory as a remembrance.

582
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,140
You still dare to lie!

583
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:54,300
That knotted accessory was...

584
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,080
personally made by me for my sister.

585
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,840
On the night before my
sister entered the palace,

586
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,680
I didn't sleep all night
to make 12 of them.

587
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:06,090
I gave her the most beautiful one.

588
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,810
My sister never removed that item.

589
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,160
Why would she give it to you?

590
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,290
I am wrong.

591
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,570
I only secretly stole some
of her items and money.

592
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,790
There's nothing more.

593
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,740
Is that the truth?

594
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,520
It's true, I can swear by heaven.

595
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:27,440
Your sister's cloth bag is over there.

596
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:30,600
I'll leave them all to you.
I won't get any of them.

597
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:33,040
I beg you to let me go.

598
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:04,820
-Only these?
-The other money got spent by me.

599
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:08,350
When I heard your name,

600
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,520
I already found it familiar.
After giving it much thought,

601
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:16,530
Wei Ying Ning changed her name
upon coming into the palace.

602
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,370
Everyone used to call her Man.

603
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,060
Hence, I didn't recall it right away.

604
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:27,180
If I said any lies,
I will be hit by lightning!

605
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:37,030
Ying Luo, let me remind you.

606
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,600
Stop investigating about
your sister's death.

607
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:44,910
She committed a huge scandalous act.
No one would dare to mention it.

608
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:48,960
Liar! My sister isn't that kind of person!

609
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:54,150
If you don't believe me,
you can ask Madam Zhang.
