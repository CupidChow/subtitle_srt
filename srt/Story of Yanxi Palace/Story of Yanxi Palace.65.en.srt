[Story of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 65]

3
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:58,150
Am I too strict with Yong Ji?

4
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,550
Your Majesty,

5
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,960
among the princes,

6
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,050
Fourth Prince has a short temper,

7
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,210
Eighth Prince
indulged in alcohol and women,

8
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:15,090
Eleventh Prince is stingy by nature.

9
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,690
None of them are favoured.

10
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,030
Sixth Prince has been
adopted according to decree,

11
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,960
having no chance to succeed the throne.

12
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,060
Hence, those left are
Fifth Prince, Twelfth Prince...

13
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,760
and Fifteenth Prince.

14
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,210
Your Majesty,

15
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,410
you must make a decision early on.

16
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,090
I promised Wei Ying Luo...

17
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,460
not to harm the princes in the palace.

18
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,980
Your Majesty,

19
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:45,570
the time is different!

20
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,650
With the current situation,

21
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,590
Fifth Prince is valued the most.

22
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,820
Once he becomes the successor,

23
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:57,840
he would naturally make you
Empress Dowager as you are the Empress.

24
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,260
But what about Twelfth Prince?

25
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,980
Have you thought of that?

26
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,720
The Empress has given birth
to a legitimate prince,

27
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,450
yet he's not the one
to succeed the throne.

28
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,150
The future fate of Twelfth Prince...

29
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,490
His fate...

30
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,710
might be just like this aging parrot,

31
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:24,790
slipping into an abyss of misfortune
step by step.

32
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,260
Shut up!

33
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,410
That's all I wanted to say.

34
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,820
Please think about it, Your Majesty.

35
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,140
-What's wrong?
-What did you say to Her Majesty?

36
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,520
Nothing! I just pointed out the truth.

37
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,330
Her Majesty has always been
worried about Twelfth Prince's future.

38
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,260
So stop making her even worried.

39
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:11,300
Her Majesty has lived ten years in peace.

40
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:14,870
She forgot all about the fight for
the throne that is pending now!

41
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,540
Once Fifth Prince becomes
the successor of the throne,

42
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,750
our Twelfth Prince...

43
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,480
is still the son of the Empress.

44
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,910
He'll soon become
the new Emperor's biggest threat!

45
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,470
His Majesty is in good health...

46
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,480
and he has no intention
to appoint the Crown Prince yet.

47
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,880
What are you worried about?

48
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,780
Planning ahead is the key to success!

49
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,600
What are we waiting for?

50
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,950
Wait for the successor decree
to be put in the sealed box...

51
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,030
behind the "Just and Honourable" plaque?

52
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,890
That'll be too late to worry then!

53
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,590
I know.

54
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,270
No matter who succeeds the throne,

55
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,870
they'll all need to honour Her Majesty
as the new Empress Dowager.

56
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,310
But don't forget...

57
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,620
that since Thirteenth Prince died,

58
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,360
Twelfth Prince has become
the Empress' sole support.

59
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,010
Can she bear to watch her beloved son...

60
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:05,340
bow to Fifth Prince as his subject?

61
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:07,450
You know the Empress well.

62
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:10,180
She's so proud.
She would never allow that!

63
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:14,720
No eggs can remain unbroken
when the nest is upset.

64
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,840
Zhen,

65
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,980
I'm actually thinking
of our own future too.

66
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:24,180
Please think about...

67
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,460
what I just said.

68
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:42,220
Your Highness,
Fifth Prince is here to greet you.

69
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,200
-Tell him I'm not here.
-It's too late.

70
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,930
Your Highness,
Fifth Prince is already outside.

71
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,190
What a fool!

72
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,659
If that little monk comes in...

73
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,390
and starts nagging,

74
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,290
we'll never hear the end of it.

75
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,520
Shush!

76
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,840
Your Highness, it's too late.

77
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,160
-What is this?
-Your Highness,

78
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,920
you asked us to clean
the storage in the backyard.

79
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,030
We brought this in earlier
and we haven't put it away yet.

80
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,780
Hurry! Open it!

81
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:16,870
Open it!

82
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,490
-Hurry!
-Your Highness, be careful.

83
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,270
I don't know
what benefit you got from him.

84
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,670
I'll have to settle this with you later!

85
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,370
Hurry! Hurry!

86
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,720
This chest is not bad. Let's get ten more!

87
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:30,310
This chest is huge.
It can hold many things.

88
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,730
Greetings, Fifth Prince.

89
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:38,110
Where is Consort Ling?

90
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:41,390
Her Highness was resting here earlier.

91
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,840
She had a headache,

92
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,600
so now she's resting
in the sleeping chamber.

93
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,490
Fifth Prince,

94
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:49,800
she's resting.

95
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:50,980
When I was little,

96
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,230
Consort Ling would send people...

97
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,909
to take care of our dining
in the Princes' Residence.

98
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:55,159
It was so considerate of her!

99
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:56,330
When it comes to herself, however,

100
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,110
she doesn't take care of herself at all!

101
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,380
If she catches a cold in this weather,

102
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,120
it'll hard to recover
from such a summer fever.

103
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,890
She'll complain that
she can't drink iced beverages again.

104
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,510
She has three children now,

105
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,870
yet she's till so willful and stubborn.

106
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,620
Look at this. It's only early summer.

107
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:19,750
All the ice from the icehouse...

108
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,600
has been delivered here.

109
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:25,510
How can she eat these iced grapes
and iced watermelon?

110
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,060
She'll have stomach pain after eating it,

111
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,590
and Father will surely
start scolding again.

112
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,150
It's such a bad example
to Zhao Hua and the other two!

113
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,470
Yes, you are right, Your Highness.

114
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,170
We will remember this...

115
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,640
and will definitely take good care of her.

116
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,300
We won't let her catch a cold.

117
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,790
-That's right!
-You must be busy with work.

118
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,620
Why don't you return first?

119
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:45,170
I received
my mother's family letter today.

120
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,080
I want to read it to Consort Ling.

121
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,850
I will wait here for her to wake up.

122
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:59,430
Greetings, Your Majesty.

123
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,850
Rise!

124
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,770
Yong Qi.

125
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,730
I knew you would be here.

126
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:07,980
What's wrong?

127
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,190
You came in vain again?

128
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:14,300
I can't hide anything from you, Father.

129
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,230
The servants said Consort Ling...

130
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,810
went take a nap...

131
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,640
before finishing her grapes.

132
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,980
She's not awake yet.

133
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,090
Went for a nap...

134
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,180
before finishing the grapes?

135
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:34,679
We didn't finish our chess game that day.

136
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,880
Let's continue.

137
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,260
Sure.

138
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,480
Your Majesty, I will go prepare
the chess table now.

139
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,960
Please go to the main hall.

140
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,330
No need.

141
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,290
We'll play here.

142
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,730
Bring the chest here.

143
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:10,070
Father, I won.

144
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,850
Let's have another round.

145
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,050
Yes.

146
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,130
Are you done?

147
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,630
I'm going to suffocate!

148
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,220
Hurry! Open up the lid!

149
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:35,220
-Your Majesty!
-Another round?

150
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:38,170
I will suffocate to death
if you play another round!

151
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,160
You are a mother already,

152
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,350
how could you do this?

153
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,920
You want everyone in the
Forbidden City to laugh at you?

154
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,830
Disrespectful as a mother.

155
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:51,870
Your Majesty,

156
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,210
you clearly knew I was in the chest...

157
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,340
and deliberately tortured me.

158
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,630
Disrespectful as a monarch!

159
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,740
Consort Ling,

160
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:03,260
were you hiding from me on purpose?

161
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,480
Of course not!

162
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,270
If I hide once, you'll come ten times.

163
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:09,690
How would hiding work?

164
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,470
What are you saying?

165
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,160
Yong Qi cares about you.

166
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,590
I know that...

167
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,630
Yong Qi has good intentions.

168
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,530
But...

169
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:22,510
But now that I'm at this age,

170
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,700
I really don't want to be
the mother of another child.

171
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:30,270
When I was little,
you took great care of me.

172
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,040
I've regarded you
as my real mother long ago.

173
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:35,370
When you gave birth to Little Fifteenth,

174
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,750
-your life was in danger…
-Your Majesty!

175
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,550
And Zhao Hua came to me crying
when I was in the academy.

176
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,570
At the time, I made up my mind.

177
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,920
If the heavens protected you
and allow you to survive,

178
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,840
I will surely urge you
to take care of yourself.

179
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,520
I pay a lot of attention to my health.

180
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,990
-It's true.
-For the past two years,

181
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,060
your stomach illness has gotten worse.

182
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,390
Father has instructed
your palace kitchen...

183
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,950
to make a bowl of
goat meat soup every day,

184
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,350
but did you ever drink it?

185
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,670
When you gave birth to Zhao Hua,

186
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,430
you were left with postpartum illness.

187
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,280
You'll get a headache
when you are exposed to the wind.

188
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,200
Earlier you were sitting by
the area with strong wind.

189
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,800
-I...
-Is this how you take care of your health?

190
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,180
If you're healthy,

191
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,110
Zhao Hua and the others could've
been raised here at Yanxi Palace!

192
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:16,110
You won't be separated from them.

193
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:20,150
Father, I'm very angry.

194
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,340
I…

195
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,600
I fear I might disrespect Consort Ling,

196
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,700
-so I'll take my leave now.
-Yong Qi!

197
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,530
Yong Qi!

198
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,810
I just couldn't help…

199
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,180
It's rarely to see you get flustered!

200
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,060
Your Majesty is happy?

201
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,610
I do feel consoled indeed.

202
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,160
Tell me,

203
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,190
who does Yong Qi takes after?

204
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:52,640
He nags a lot.

205
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:55,410
He wasn't like this when he was little.

206
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,050
He doesn't understand.

207
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,910
But I do.

208
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,720
Your Majesty, what do you understand?

209
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,390
In the past ten years,

210
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:14,010
we've had two sons and two daughters.

211
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,770
Unfortunately,

212
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,770
Yong Lu didn't survive.

213
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,720
The night Yong Lu died,

214
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:23,520
you accompanied him all night and...

215
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,590
didn't sleep at all.

216
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,760
I saw that.

217
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,480
A month later,

218
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,290
you sent Zhao Yu...

219
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,800
to Shoukang Palace to accompany Zhao Hua.

220
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,360
And you entrusted Yong Yan...

221
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,960
to Consort Qing.

222
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,960
Everyone said that...

223
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,690
you were so harsh and selfish.

224
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:43,790
You did those to win Empress Dowager's
favour and coax Consort Qing.

225
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,480
But only I understood...

226
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,250
that Zhao Hua is your eldest daughter.

227
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,210
You sent her to Shoukang Palace...

228
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,850
to console Empress Dowager.

229
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:57,440
Ying Luo,

230
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,410
after Chen Bi's incident,

231
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:04,950
you've been feeling guilty
towards Empress Dowager,

232
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,160
right?

233
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,690
Your Majesty,

234
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,650
Zhao Hua is a person.

235
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,760
I would not use her
to make amends for my guilt.

236
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,620
But you are worried that
you are not in good health,

237
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,830
so you want to seek new backers for them,

238
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:27,940
am I right?

239
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,550
I'm warning you.

240
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,920
Wei Ying Luo,

241
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,980
you are not allowed
to hold such ominous thoughts.

242
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,480
Not even a speck of it.

243
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,710
Your body was weak...

244
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:49,150
from giving birth to Yong Yan.

245
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,270
But the imperial physicians said...

246
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:54,380
you will recover after resting.

247
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,060
I...

248
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,670
want you to accompany me...

249
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,510
for a long time.

250
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,590
If you end up like Rong Yin,

251
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:09,350
leaving me halfway,

252
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,960
I will never forgive you.

253
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,780
Your Majesty, didn't you say...

254
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:23,500
that a disaster lasts a millennium?

255
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,280
I will surely try my best...

256
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:35,250
to live a long life.

257
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,170
Your Majesty,

258
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,230
do you feel unwell?

259
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:12,190
Your Majesty, you're sweating quite a bit.

260
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:13,860
I will prepare a new sleeping gown...

261
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,170
and help you change.

262
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,710
No wonder Your Majesty
is not feeling well.

263
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,100
You're menstruating.

264
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,590
I've already prepared in advance...

265
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,920
and I'll go fetch it now.

266
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:02,540
Greetings, Prince He.

267
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,800
I haven't seen Her Majesty for so long,

268
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,840
but I do see Twelfth Prince often.

269
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,370
Please ask her to not worry.

270
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,840
I'll supervise Twelfth Prince's
martial arts training.

271
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,310
I won't let him fall behind.

272
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,430
My Lord,

273
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,180
Her Majesty's...

274
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,540
favourite parrot died last night.

275
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,390
She has been miserable...

276
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,490
and upset all day long.

277
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,000
Can I ask...

278
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,500
where did that parrot come from?

279
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,090
So I can find...

280
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,990
a similar one for Her Majesty.

281
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:37,400
Leave this to me.

282
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,770
Thank you, Prince He.

283
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,580
If only His Majesty could be...

284
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,600
attentive to the Empress like you are!

285
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,330
In that case, Her Majesty
wouldn't be so worried.

286
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,080
For the past ten years,

287
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,670
Noble Consort Ling has
garnered the royal favour...

288
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,600
and has given birth in succession.

289
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,770
Being seduced by her,

290
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,940
His Majesty often overlooked the Empress.

291
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:08,450
But she is at least the Empress,

292
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,670
Noble Consort Ling cannot surpass her.

293
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:11,750
My Lord!

294
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:14,619
The Empress is not only...

295
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,869
worried about competition
in the imperial harem,

296
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,859
but also…

297
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:24,940
My Lord,

298
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:28,349
you are the brother that
His Majesty trusts the most.

299
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,680
Has His Majesty...

300
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:32,530
ever mentioned anything to you?

301
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,200
Mentioned what?

302
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,100
I shouldn't have asked.

303
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,810
My Lord,

304
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:46,330
Her Majesty is waiting for me to return.

305
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:48,110
I'm taking my leave.

306
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,860
What's the stuttering about?

307
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,250
Why didn't he finish?

308
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,400
Even if he didn't finish,

309
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,870
I know what she is worried about.

310
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,290
Physician Zhang,

311
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:06,610
perhaps it's because
Her Majesty's menstruation is irregular.

312
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:08,360
Can you give her a prescription...

313
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,790
for her to recuperate?

314
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,950
Not only I feel unsettled,

315
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,640
I also can't sleep at night.

316
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,970
What is the problem?

317
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:22,330
Your Majesty, I have already said...

318
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,270
that humans have five viscera
that turn into five vital energies.

319
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,070
A lifetime's joy, anger, grief,
worry and fright.

320
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,870
Stop beating around the bush.

321
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,570
Just get to the point.

322
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:33,970
Your Majesty,

323
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,630
based on your symptoms,

324
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:38,400
your liver is weak and
your spleen is in disarray.

325
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:41,490
And you upset your liver energy often
which has built up knots.

326
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:43,310
At times, it may cause
intermenstrual bleeding...

327
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,770
but it's nothing serious.

328
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,700
As long as you take aging tonic
to adjust your blood and energy,

329
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,220
you will recover soon.

330
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,020
Will I...

331
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,540
have a full recovery?

332
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,400
Your Majesty,
no matter how well you are treated,

333
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,000
the cause of
the illness is still in your heart.

334
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:03,480
With all due respect, Your Majesty,

335
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,710
you are the Empress,

336
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:08,170
you should set your mind at peace.

337
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:11,400
You don't have to compete
with other consorts for temporary gains.

338
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,720
Remember, jealousy courts worry,
worry courts fright.

339
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,640
Illness will thus eventually come along.

340
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,550
Compete with others for temporary gains?

341
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:22,330
You mean I get jealous easily?

342
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,840
Your Majesty...

343
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,540
That wasn't what I meant.

344
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,810
Get lost!

345
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,290
When I look into the mirror,

346
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:43,280
I feel that I look different now.

347
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,150
I look haggard...

348
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,120
and old.

349
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,750
Your Majesty, that's not true!

350
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,960
What did he just say?

351
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,900
Jealousy courts worry,
worry courts fright?

352
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,550
Everyone's discussing
about me behind my back,

353
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:02,610
saying I am a crazed Empress
who has mood swings.

354
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:05,600
Everyone is saying
that I'm crazy behind my back,

355
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,750
am I right?

356
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,630
Your Highness, no one says that.

357
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:13,730
No.

358
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,720
I'm not crazy.

359
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,020
I'm very normal.

360
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,850
They are crazy. They are the crazy ones!

361
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,780
Zhen,

362
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,930
help me with my make up.

363
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,270
I'm going to Yangxin Hall.

364
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,750
Your Majesty,

365
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:38,330
why do you have
two paintings that are exactly the same?

366
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:42,710
This is Huang Gongwang's painting of
"Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains".

367
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,580
I obtained one last year.

368
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,000
Fu Heng sent me...

369
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,090
another one this year.

370
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,890
Which one do you think...

371
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:54,770
is real?

372
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:08,220
I think...

373
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,750
this one is real.

374
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:14,790
Really?

375
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,180
Lord Fu Heng is versed in battles.

376
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,260
But he's not versed
in examining paintings.

377
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:25,270
Your Majesty, do you still remember?

378
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:27,620
He sent a pair of jade vases last year.

379
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,040
Turns out they were the work
of the Imperial Household Department.

380
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,480
The vases somehow ended up
in Glass Street after being made,

381
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,950
then they were claimed
to be great works of the Tang Dynasty!

382
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,880
He was swindled out of 1,000 taels!

383
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,550
But I think...

384
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:43,680
Fu Heng is right this time.

385
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,060
Look.

386
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:47,630
The painters of Yuan Dynasty,

387
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:50,490
used to title the paintings
after they've painted.

388
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,800
Look at the old painting.

389
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,330
Its title is...

390
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,810
on the upper side of the painting.

391
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:58,430
Isn't this strange?

392
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:05,280
That's just
some trick to make it look real.

393
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,570
How could you fall for that?

394
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,940
Your Majesty, take a look.

395
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,820
This old painting.

396
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,560
Its brush stroke is imposing but hazy.

397
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,420
The change is unbounded.

398
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:22,680
This new work can't compare.

399
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,120
Really?

400
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:29,370
Look closer!

401
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:34,510
What you said makes sense.

402
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:36,260
But look at the fake one.

403
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:38,780
It's not too bad either, right?

404
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:42,540
Put away these two paintings.

405
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:45,530
Put the real one in Sanxi Hall.

406
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,480
Give it to me.

407
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,050
Your Majesty made a mistake.

408
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:58,160
Perhaps your eyesight has weakened.

409
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,560
Maybe you should get
a pair of Western glasses.

410
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:07,870
I can still shoot with great precision.

411
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:11,110
I don't need a pair of glasses yet!

412
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:15,010
It was just a careless mistake.

413
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,630
But speaking of weakened eyesight,

414
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,730
I really feel that...

415
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:26,880
the Empress has aged quite a bit...

416
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,080
these last couple of years.

417
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:32,510
You mean Her Majesty?

418
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:35,830
Yes.

419
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,480
She's become very moody.

420
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,670
And it's harder
to find things in common...

421
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,620
when I chat with her.

422
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,510
But as soon as I leave,

423
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,160
she would throw a tantrum.

424
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,760
Like a different person.

425
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,230
Your Majesty...

426
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,820
is in good health,

427
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,840
handsome and energetic!

428
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:06,520
You look no more than 35.

429
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,430
But women are different.

430
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,410
At this age,

431
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:19,710
women will experience
physical and mental change.

432
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:21,620
It's normal.

433
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,130
Wei Ying Luo,

434
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:29,930
you are getting old too!

435
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:32,570
Even if I'm getting old,

436
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,770
I'm still 16 years younger than you.

437
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,410
Your Majesty!

438
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,490
Your Majesty, forgive me!

439
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:45,960
I was wrong!

440
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,560
I'm sorry!

441
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:49,730
You're not young anymore.

442
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,590
If you don't let go,
I'm really going to get wrinkles!

443
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,250
I thought you don't fear that!

444
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,930
-Let go!
-How come you didn't have any fear...

445
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,530
when you said I'm old?

446
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,230
Will you say it again? Will you?

447
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,410
-Your Majesty!
-Will you?

448
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:05,260
I said that you look no more than 35!

449
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,620
Your Majesty.
Allow me to inform His Majesty.

450
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:09,750
No need.

451
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,460
I wanted to discuss...

452
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:14,790
the trip to the Yuanming Garden
to escape the summer heat.

453
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,600
Since His Majesty is still busy,

454
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,390
I'm going back.

455
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,660
Don't let His Majesty...

456
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:28,110
eat too much of this iced lotus seed soup,

457
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,630
or it may upset his stomach.

458
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:30,640
Yes.

459
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,160
Your Majesty,

460
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,690
Her Majesty personally delivered...

461
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,480
iced lotus seed soup.

462
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,390
Leave it there.

463
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,160
Be careful! Don't wet this painting.

464
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:07,300
Yes.

465
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:13,840
Now.

466
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,080
Take this...

467
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,570
and store it well.

468
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:25,780
Your Majesty,
didn't Noble Consort Ling say...

469
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:29,230
that Lord Fu Heng sent a counterfeit?

470
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,950
I overheard it...

471
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,740
when I passed by just now.

472
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,440
She was afraid that...

473
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,240
I would get too excited...

474
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:46,150
and put stamps
all over this painting again,

475
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:49,430
so she claimed
this genuine painting is a counterfeit.

476
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,500
I've already seen through her...

477
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,980
over the years.

478
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:58,570
I just didn't want to expose her.

479
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:02,970
Your Highness, you made the genuine
painting into a counterfeit on purpose?

480
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,370
That's right.

481
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:06,870
But that's a crime of
deceiving the Emperor.

482
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,840
He won't expose me anyway.

483
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:10,060
Why?

484
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:12,350
He is such a proud man.

485
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:15,350
If he admits the one
Fu Heng sent is a genuine one,

486
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:18,590
then he actually stored
the counterfeit one previously.

487
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:21,700
And he even happily
admired it numerous times...

488
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,870
and stamped it many times.

489
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,820
Once it's known by the public,

490
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,630
it'd become a joke.

491
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,580
So,

492
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:32,840
even if he could tell right away
which is the genuine one,

493
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,160
he wouldn't expose me no matter what.

494
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:39,060
There is no wrinkles
at the corner of my eye.

495
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:41,570
And my skin is the same as before.

496
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,530
I've tried all ways...

497
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:46,500
to preserve my current beauty.

498
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:49,080
But my body is telling me,

499
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,220
that everything was in vain!

500
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,850
Everything was in vain!

501
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,310
Your Majesty.

502
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,760
Your Majesty.

503
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:02,120
Every woman will grow old.

504
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,720
Even that favoured Noble Consort Ling...

505
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,290
will get old too.

506
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,550
Her?

507
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,040
Will she grow old too?

508
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,490
Absolutely, Your Majesty.

509
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:19,580
But she's ten years younger than me!

510
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:21,570
A whole decade!

511
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,020
How many decades does a woman have?

512
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,770
Did you hear them earlier?

513
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:28,510
She was laughing at me.

514
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,630
She laughed about me being old!

515
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:31,700
Your Majesty.

516
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:33,130
Also.

517
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,150
Those young consorts and concubines.

518
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,940
They're all laughing at me!

519
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,990
The majestic Empress...

520
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:42,110
is decaying little by little.

521
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,100
Zhen.

522
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,910
Zhen, tell me.

523
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:47,740
In a few years,

524
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,420
will my face be full of blue veins...

525
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,860
and wrinkles?

526
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,230
Will my black hair become all white?

527
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:58,510
My skin will never be as smooth as silk!

528
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,440
His Majesty will dislike me.

529
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:05,180
Even the servants
will pity me and laugh at me,

530
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,050
won't they?

531
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,160
Won't they?

532
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:12,190
They won't, Your Majesty.

533
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,260
They won't!

534
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,410
They will.

535
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,850
Your Majesty.

536
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,220
Empress Dowager's old too.

537
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:26,500
Stop talking, stop talking!

538
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,950
Your Majesty.

539
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,960
Empress Dowager is over 70 now,

540
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,060
but she's never had to worry.

541
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,340
Why?

542
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:38,460
Because she has a son to depend on,

543
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:40,120
not her husband.

544
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:43,720
It makes a big difference!

545
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:47,250
Your Majesty, you should think carefully.

546
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,000
Who do you think you are...

547
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:53,830
to lecture me?

548
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,720
Your Majesty.

549
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,070
You used to be...

550
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:59,800
very decisive.

551
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:02,260
Over the years,

552
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:04,450
you were able...

553
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:07,660
to govern all the ambitious consorts
within your grasp.

554
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:09,670
A bunch of subjects in the royal court...

555
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:12,270
have come forward
supporting Twelfth Prince.

556
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,100
And look at the Fuca clan.

557
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:16,100
Their family is filled with...

558
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,710
famous officials, generals...

559
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:19,170
and capable individuals.

560
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:22,300
But their Empress was so weak!

561
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,140
Your Majesty, you are the exact opposite!

562
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,520
You relied on yourself...

563
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,530
to prosper the Hoifa Nara clan...

564
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:31,360
and obtained your power today.

565
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:34,340
You have amazing skills and means!

566
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:35,790
Fuca Rong Yin could never even...

567
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:39,190
come close to you!

568
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,840
But, Your Majesty,

569
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,480
you have changed.

570
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:52,810
-Changed?
-You've become soft...

571
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,690
and hesitant.

572
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:56,740
I swore that...

573
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:59,710
I wouldn't harm the princes
in the Forbidden City.

574
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:01,930
Your Majesty.

575
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:04,080
Is that the real you?

576
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:06,680
Will you take that seriously?

577
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,420
Forgive me for being bold.

578
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,340
You're not worried about...

579
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,930
Wei Ying Luo.

580
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,490
You're worry about...

581
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,950
the current Emperor.

582
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,860
You are not afraid of failure.

583
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,830
You're afraid of hurting his feelings...

584
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:24,650
and losing him forever.

585
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,180
Your Majesty.

586
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:30,250
You're powerful.

587
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,640
Why can't you put aside
the petty love of common women...

588
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,870
and escape from emotional shackles?

589
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,980
You could've won beautifully,

590
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:40,670
but you had to endure it.

591
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,910
You really deserve better, Your Majesty.

592
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:48,120
I don't need you to tell me what to do!

593
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:52,240
Go to the Bureau of Internal Affair
and receive 40 strokes of cane!

594
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:54,890
Yes.

595
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,070
-Your Majesty…
-If what he said gets out,

596
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,750
it will surely implicate me.

597
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,970
If it wasn't because of you,

598
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:12,410
I would've had him caned to death!

599
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,610
Why did you do so?

600
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,370
Why are you crying?

601
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:35,380
She was so angry.

602
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:38,450
It proved I've spoken of her pain.

603
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:41,420
You know that Her Majesty
doesn't express much,

604
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,280
but she's fully devoted
and infatuated with His Majesty.

605
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,140
Now she's getting old,

606
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,000
it's already cruel enough,

607
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:52,000
how could you hurt her like that?

608
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,770
If I didn't do so,

609
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,870
how can she wake up completely?

610
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,860
What are you trying to do exactly?

611
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:08,200
I want her to find herself back.

612
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:11,070
I want her to see the Emperor clearly...

613
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,620
and see the road under her feet.

614
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:14,790
But Her Majesty...

615
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,110
won't bear to give up His Majesty.

616
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,790
If she can't take action,

617
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,580
I will do it myself.

618
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:30,050
What did you say?

619
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,130
My Lord.

620
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,050
For the past ten years,

621
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:37,450
I have seen it clearly.

622
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:40,230
In the entire Forbidden City,

623
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:44,930
you're the only one
who care about the Empress the most.

624
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:48,850
And you're the only one
who know what's best for her.

625
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,590
If you don't help her,

626
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,060
Her Majesty's future path...

627
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:56,340
will only get more and more difficult.

628
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:00,310
I will find an opportunity...

629
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,570
to talk to His Majesty.

630
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,030
About what?

631
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:07,120
Ask him to be kind to Her Majesty...

632
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,540
and Twelfth Prince.

633
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:11,000
That's a dream...

634
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:13,969
that the Empress has been waiting for too.

635
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:17,540
It's been 30 years.

636
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:20,400
Has it come true?

637
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:26,860
Treating her kindly will only be pity.

638
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:30,900
The Empress is such a proud person.

639
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:34,409
She'll never accept pity from others.

640
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,380
My Lord, allow me to say something.

641
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:41,659
We can't count on His Majesty anymore.

642
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,780
You're the only one...

643
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,940
that can help
the Empress and Twelfth Prince.

644
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:51,130
And only you have the ability to do so.

645
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:56,310
Let me think about it.

646
00:34:58,090 --> 00:34:59,340
Let me think.

647
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,870
Helping them...

648
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,770
equals helping yourself.

649
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:11,690
Fifth Prince is very close
to Noble Consort Ling...

650
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:15,630
and also in alliance with Fu Heng.

651
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:17,490
Don't you forget that...

652
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,060
over the past ten years,

653
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,920
you and Fu Heng...

654
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:23,710
have become embittered towards each other.

655
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:27,700
Every Emperor has
a cabinet composed of his own favourites.

656
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:31,380
If Fifth Prince ascends the throne,

657
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:34,650
the Fuca clan will become more powerful.

658
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,190
And you, a royal uncle,

659
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,970
will have to stand aside.

660
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:47,040
Even His Majesty...

661
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,360
has never trusted you completely,

662
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:54,460
let alone the Fifth Prince.

663
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:04,240
Lord Fu Heng.

664
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:56,950
Your Majesty,

665
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,340
since you've asked me...

666
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,000
to review the Imperial Examination papers,

667
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,530
may you return now and rest.

668
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:04,660
I will see to it earnestly...

669
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:08,050
and select the most qualified scholars
to serve the court.

670
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,910
I will watch a little longer.

671
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:17,860
It's past the meal time.

672
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:20,190
Why do you have to review by yourself?

673
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,960
It's fine.

674
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:31,080
Your Majesty, do you suspect that
I might use personal relations to cheat...

675
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,140
or try to make the scholars my own men?

676
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:19,530
Do you...

677
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,280
want this hat?

678
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,430
I don't dare!

679
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:29,220
I absolutely don't!

680
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,290
Based on what you just said,

681
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:36,430
I can behead you.

682
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,120
Your Majesty,

683
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,640
It was a slip of the tongue.

684
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,080
I deserve to die.

685
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,960
May Your Majesty forgive me!

686
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:04,850
I heard what you just said.

687
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,950
You hold a grudge against me...

688
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,780
but you don't dare to speak up.

689
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,020
I'm giving you the opportunity now.

690
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,240
Speak.

691
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:23,050
Your Majesty.

692
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:26,590
How would I dare to complain!

693
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:30,380
I wouldn't dare...

694
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,270
no matter how much nerve I have.

695
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,790
Rise!

696
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:25,710
I gave you the opportunity
and you wouldn't tell me,

697
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,430
so never say it again in the future.

698
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,510
Head to Yanxi Palace.

699
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:42,800
Your Majesty, Her Majesty
has delivered some snacks again.

700
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:46,510
She hopes you can visit her in
Chengqian Palace when you have time.

701
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:51,870
Your Majesty, His Majesty is here.

702
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,310
Greetings, Your Majesty.

703
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:02,410
Rise.

704
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:07,020
You look rosy-cheeked.

705
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:11,260
You are much better today.

706
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:14,630
Your Majesty likes to make fun of me.

707
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:17,800
I am busy with ordinary matters
of the harem every day.

708
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,320
I've already become an ordinary person.

709
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,230
What great delicacy are you enjoying?

710
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:33,430
What is this?

711
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:38,720
As someone who loves to hunt deer
so much, Your Majesty can't tell?

712
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:43,710
Deer foetus?

713
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,850
Deer foetus boiled with dark sugar.

714
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,560
It creates a semifluid
extract of deer foetus,

715
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,830
which is a great tonic...

716
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:53,480
that repairs the kidney.

717
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:56,890
I will instruct them
to deliver some to Yanxi Palace later.

718
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:58,210
No need.

719
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:00,300
She doesn't need this.

720
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:02,530
Unlike you,

721
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:06,090
Ying Luo is not stressed by
the matters of the palace.

722
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:08,100
She leads a happy life.

723
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:10,640
She is only busy with appreciating
paintings, flowers and boating,

724
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,570
She likes running around
with the children everywhere.

725
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:13,780
She won't need it.

726
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,380
Your Majesty.

727
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:21,460
Seventh Princess and
Ninth Princess have grown up.

728
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,220
In a few years,
I will select their husbands.

729
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:29,720
They should stop playing around
and learn the rules now.

730
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:31,800
Even though they are Imperial Princesses,

731
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,080
they can't be ridiculed...

732
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:36,010
by the subjects.

733
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:39,700
Fifteenth Prince is already six years old.

734
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:42,430
He should be like his older brothers,

735
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,120
learning the books in the morning,

736
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,040
riding and practicing archery
in the afternoon.

737
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,110
But Noble Consort Ling always...

738
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:51,420
asks him to pretend to be sick
and then take him out to play.

739
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:54,350
The teachers have complained
about it so many times,

740
00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:56,780
but she doesn't listen at all.

741
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:03,360
Maybe that's an exaggeration.

742
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:07,900
Your Majesty, I know
you don't like hearing this,

743
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,050
but for the sake of the children's future,

744
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:11,830
I must say it.

745
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,000
As princesses,

746
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,260
they are Your Majesty's daughters
and it'll be easy for them to get married.

747
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:19,320
Everybody will treat them nicely.

748
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:21,390
But as for Fifteenth Prince,

749
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:24,810
he's creating trouble everywhere.

750
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:27,530
Other than having a strong body,

751
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:29,260
he has no other skills.

752
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:33,230
He was able to recite
and read poems at the age of three.

753
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:36,100
But now, his studies have been cast aside.

754
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,680
He has such a great potential,
but it's going waste.

755
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,750
It's quite painful to watch.

756
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,480
You're right about this.

757
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:45,680
I will talk to her.

758
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:46,940
But,

759
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:48,670
regarding the marriage of both princesses,

760
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:50,070
you don't have to bother.

761
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:52,540
I will personally choose the candidates.

762
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,800
Those ordinary foolish boys...

763
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:57,600
don't deserve my precious princesses.

764
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:01,850
Since Your Majesty is willing
to persuade Noble Consort Ling,

765
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:03,760
I don't have to worry then.

766
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:14,030
You are leaving already?

767
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,190
I remember that I still have things to do.

768
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:18,470
I will visit you some other day.
