[Story of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 28]

3
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,380
She's my hope.

4
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,170
What did you say?

5
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:03,110
I've always wanted to live like she does.

6
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,479
Empress...

7
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,330
You are the mother of an empire,

8
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,910
yet you envy an ignorant handmaiden?

9
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,160
Are you crazy?

10
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:32,190
Your Majesty, do you still remember...

11
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,170
the day of our first visit
to Empress Xiaojingxian...

12
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:43,079
after our wedding?

13
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,980
At the time, the current
Empress Dowager...

14
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,940
was still Consort Xi.

15
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,280
The power to rule over the six palaces...

16
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:03,210
[was all in the hands of
Empress Xiaojingxian.]

17
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,410
[At ease.]

18
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,420
[Hong Li, this wife was
chosen by your father...]

19
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,480
[and mother among so many choices.]

20
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,130
[What do you think of her?]

21
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,329
[I will forever remember
the graces of my mother.]

22
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,370
[Come here.]

23
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,970
[This hair pin is my meeting gift to you.]

24
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,410
[I hope you would come here more often...]

25
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,370
[and keep me company.]

26
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,750
[Thank you for your kindness, Mother.]

27
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:01,440
[I'll keep that in mind.
I will come here more often from now on.]

28
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,850
[I've also prepared a gift for you.]

29
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,300
[It's a sapphire "Haoran Court"
hanging panel.]

30
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,800
[I made the embroidery
on the hanging panel.]

31
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,459
[Hong Li, go to your father.]

32
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,920
[I need to have a word with your wife.]

33
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,280
[Yes.]

34
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,450
[Kneel.]

35
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,740
[I don't know what I've done wrong.]

36
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,250
[Please enlighten me.]

37
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,120
[Copy "Virtues of a Woman"
one hundred times.]

38
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,640
[You will then realize your own mistake.]

39
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,120
Empress Xiaojingxian had
always been kind and amicable.

40
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,600
Why would she punish you?

41
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:55,120
Because I spoke more
than Your Majesty did.

42
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,220
Spoke more than I did?

43
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,490
Yes. As a wife,

44
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,250
one should speak less,
and speak cautiously.

45
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,930
If my husband speaks one sentence,

46
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:16,990
and I spoke more than that,
then that's wrong.

47
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:22,920
I don't understand what you mean.

48
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,530
I remember that in the decree...

49
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,040
giving posthumous title
to Empress Xiaojingxian,

50
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,720
she was once described as...

51
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,620
having a pure and harmonious
natural temperament.

52
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,210
Well-trained in the etiquette as a woman.

53
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,960
The model of proper womanly integrity.

54
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,240
Very hidebound by convention.

55
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:52,800
An Empress who had strictly
followed the so-called women's virtues.

56
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,220
How could she allow...

57
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,970
the wife of Prince Bao...

58
00:05:58,409 --> 00:06:00,410
to be more eloquent and carefree...

59
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:06,120
than Prince Bao himself?

60
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,170
Absurd.

61
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,400
Maybe men will find this absurd.

62
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:15,310
But for a woman,

63
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,320
this is morality and code.

64
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,150
We should see our husbands
as everything we have.

65
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:27,110
Our husband should become
what rules over us.

66
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,710
We must follow the will of our husband
as if it's our own.

67
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,550
All the wives in this world are the same.

68
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,640
Not to mention that I am...

69
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,440
known as the mother of an empire.

70
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,940
I can't afford any mistake.

71
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:47,310
Or else the whole Forbidden City,

72
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,800
no,

73
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,510
the whole nation Qing...

74
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,600
will bash me for my actions...

75
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,020
just like Empress Xiaojingqian,

76
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:05,760
they will bash me for neglecting my duty
as a wife and a woman.

77
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,200
Empress,

78
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,020
I never doubted...

79
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:19,380
that you are the best empress
in the entire world.

80
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,520
But Your Majesty,

81
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,730
I am already not the best of myself.

82
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,909
Ever since I married you,

83
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,550
I'm no longer Fuca Rong Yin.

84
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,340
I am entirely...

85
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,750
shackled by rules and codes.

86
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,090
Ever step I take...

87
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:56,020
must be perfection.

88
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,500
I must be magnanimous,

89
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,670
dignified,

90
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,300
virtuous and submissive.

91
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,330
This is the Empress the people wanted.

92
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,200
Not only me,

93
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,640
but the whole Forbidden City
must follow the rules strictly.

94
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,780
Not one mistake must is allowed.

95
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:32,650
But Ying Luo is different.
Only she is different.

96
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,460
She disobeyed the law!

97
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:37,070
She crossed the line.

98
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:43,159
But she's being herself.

99
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,990
Wei Ying Luo will forever be Wei Ying Luo.

100
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,920
She's real and alive.

101
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,810
She has free will.

102
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,380
She's being resilient.

103
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,220
Unlike other people,

104
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:04,540
they willingly became
a puppet on a string.

105
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,410
Your Majesty, I...

106
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,620
became who I am now...

107
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,570
because I failed to hold onto my own will.

108
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,820
This is why I must protect Ying Luo,

109
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,420
just like protecting my old self.

110
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:27,880
Your Majesty,

111
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,400
do you understand?

112
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,760
That's why...

113
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,490
you will never allow me...

114
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,490
to hurt her.

115
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,810
Yes, I will never allow it.

116
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,870
For the first time, I am disobeying
Your Majesty.

117
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,910
I earnestly beg Your Majesty.

118
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:12,690
Just let me be wilful for once.

119
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,700
Your Majesty, what's wrong?

120
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,860
I suddenly had a feeling...

121
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,150
I've known nothing of my empress at all.

122
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,110
Your Majesty, the Labour House...

123
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,230
She was born to be rebellious.

124
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,800
She can do whatever she pleases.

125
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,950
Your Majesty, it's all heavy labours
in the Labour House.

126
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,940
I fear it might be too harsh
for Miss Ying Luo.

127
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,620
Too harsh for her?

128
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,930
If she can't do it,
she'll come back crying and begging.

129
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,440
If she sheds a drop of tear,

130
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:43,230
it proves everything that Empress said...

131
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,280
was nothing but overstatement.
Back to Yangxin Palace.

132
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,350
Yes.

133
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,600
Where is Guard Fuca?

134
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,120
His Majesty sent him off for
some errand. He's not in the palace.

135
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,520
He is either nowhere to be found
or everywhere to be seen.

136
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,480
The men in this world are all useless!

137
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,500
Miss Ming Yu, what made you say that?

138
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,420
But I am right!

139
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,610
Ying Luo has been
sent to the Labour House.

140
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:10,200
That is no place for human to live.

141
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,200
I fear she might not come back alive.

142
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,790
If Guard Fuca is around,
he could at least plea for her.

143
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,450
Wei Ying Luo got in trouble?

144
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,510
How did you know my name?

145
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:24,270
Your name is inside the fragrance pouch.

146
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:25,840
Give it back!

147
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,780
Tell me what happened to Wei Ying Luo.

148
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,010
Why was she sent to the Labour House?

149
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,120
Miss Ming Yu, are you all right?

150
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,280
My waist!

151
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,680
I told you your bones are weak,
be careful with how you move.

152
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,630
Are you crazy?

153
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,770
Miss Ming Yu!

154
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,840
Such a fearsome lady.

155
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,850
Did you eat pepper growing up?

156
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,640
Your Highness, you're painting just fine.
Why are you stopping?

157
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,950
After a closer look,

158
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,170
this orchid seems to look like a chive.

159
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,780
Your Highness. Plum, orchid, bamboo,
and chrysanthemum.

160
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,510
An orchid is an elegant flower.

161
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,840
How could it look like a chive?

162
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,360
It's worse than a chive.
At least it's edible.

163
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,690
But Her Highness Consort Chun
likes orchids the most.

164
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:37,690
She thinks orchid is the gentleman
among the flowers.

165
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:49,920
Your Highness, did I say something wrong?

166
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,210
Confucius said angelica and
orchids grow in deep ravines.

167
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,930
They don't stop emitting fragrance
because there's no one around.

168
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:03,950
A gentleman cultivates morality.
He doesn't change with predicament.

169
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,210
Is she trying to praise
the orchid by that?

170
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,830
No, she's praising herself.

171
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,180
Enough about the orchids.

172
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,860
But that bamboo,
it's just plain and bald.

173
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,020
Scholars like to praise
the mastering the Four Arts.

174
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,340
They just want to announce to the world..

175
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,520
that their morality is above all men
and they are unique in every way.

176
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,250
But the truth is,

177
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,170
they are just pursuing fame
and waiting for the highest bidder.

178
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,160
Speaking of the Four Arts,

179
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,380
I've been taught since I was little.
I'm not inferior to men.

180
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:57,990
But I...

181
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:02,700
just love opera more.

182
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,490
But you're not allowed to sing.

183
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,270
I can't sing...

184
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,390
-Even so, painting is useless!
-Your Highness!

185
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,720
Your Highness!

186
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,500
Your Highness.

187
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,560
Noble Consort Gao.

188
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,920
What is it?

189
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,280
Noble Consort Gao, I have good news.

190
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,900
Consort Dowager Yu
got struck by lightning?

191
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,230
Your Highness!

192
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,070
It's the funeral of Consort Dowager Yu,
how is that a good news?

193
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,200
Consort Dowager Yu had been a vegetarian
and never stopped praying.

194
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,200
In the end, a thunderbolt killed her.

195
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,750
Isn't this the greatest joke
of Forbidden City?

196
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:49,940
That's right.

197
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,240
If it's not Consort Dowager Yu,
would it be Changchun Palace?

198
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,640
That's right.

199
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:00,450
Wei Ying Luo angered the Empress...

200
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,510
and got sent to the Labour House.

201
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,910
It's just a lowly slave.

202
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,560
How could that be good news?

203
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,750
Without a fierce dog guarding the gates,

204
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:17,920
won't entering Changchun Palace
be a walk in the park?

205
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,280
We indeed must plan for that.

206
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,540
We have to tread carefully
and leave no traces behind.

207
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:37,800
Your Highness, don't worry.
I understand.

208
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,840
Changchun Palace is so tightly guarded.

209
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,160
I'm getting bored of the life here.

210
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,770
Now...

211
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:56,420
This palace will soon
become a merry place.

212
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,040
You were once a favoured
handmaiden of Her Majesty.

213
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,800
People bow to you and respect you
wherever you went.

214
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,400
But now you are in the Labour House,
it's time to let go of the past.

215
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,280
In here, you're just a sinner
who does lowly labours.

216
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:24,880
You each have your own jobs here,
most of them are hard labours.

217
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,770
You are doing what the others
refuse to do.

218
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,800
You wake up when the rooster crows
to clean the public paths.

219
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,680
At one o'clock in the morning,
cut the weeds at the main palaces.

220
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:37,810
Throughout the day, you must complete
all sorts of chores for the palaces.

221
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,380
As for you,

222
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,410
start from the simplest.

223
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,310
You will be responsible...

224
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,890
for cleaning the commodes
of the different palaces.

225
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,760
Hey.

226
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,160
Who are you?

227
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,280
Hey, young man.

228
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,340
You must be in charge of
transporting the commodes?

229
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:36,060
[This person is so weird.]

230
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,120
What's that smell?

231
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,460
That stinks!

232
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,790
Isn't this our old friend?

233
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,480
Hey everyone, do you know who she is?

234
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:09,030
We don't know her.

235
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,230
Let me make the introductions.

236
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,160
This Miss Wei Ying Luo...

237
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,250
of Changchun Palace.

238
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,340
A favoured person of Her Majesty.
In the whole Forbidden City,

239
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:21,800
she has the most arrogance.

240
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,280
Yet while we haven't met in some time,

241
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,760
she has ended up as one of us?

242
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,260
Indeed.

243
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:31,190
Ying Luo, others climb up to higher ranks,

244
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,620
why are going the other way around?

245
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,370
If it were me,

246
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:38,450
-I might as well kill myself.
-You are right.

247
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,690
I don't want to live in shame...

248
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:44,190
and make myself a laughing stock.

249
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,160
Wei Ying Luo, what do you want to do?

250
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,330
We are all members of the Labour House.
I'm more experienced than you.

251
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,680
I'm not afraid of you.

252
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,170
If you fear me so,

253
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:59,280
it seems like you never forgot
how you got here in the first place.

254
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,900
Don't you dare bring that up!

255
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,120
You put up a fake affair with that guard
and fooled me into making a report!

256
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,580
Good, you still remember.

257
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,230
I don't have to make you remember that.

258
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,590
Wei Ying Luo...

259
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,050
Enough. Forget it...

260
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,360
-We have time to deal with her.
-She is not going anywhere.

261
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,720
Let's go.

262
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,170
Just go. Don't lower yourself
to her level.

263
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,260
Let's sleep.

264
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,850
What is she doing?

265
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,520
Those are leftover charcoals
from the different palaces.

266
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,580
It's currently the middle of summer.

267
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,220
Why is she gathering
the leftover charcoals?

268
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,550
Let me remind all of you,

269
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,080
this lady is cunning and vile.
You'd better stay away from her...

270
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,540
or you might get yourselves into troubles.

271
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,680
Brother Yan! Brother Yan!

272
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,630
Brother Yan!

273
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:31,560
Brother Yan!

274
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,090
Brother Yan.

275
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:42,060
Brother Yan, did you not hear me?

276
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,300
Brother Yan.

277
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:53,410
Brother Yan!

278
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,900
Jin Xiu got brushed off again.

279
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,880
I told you Brother Yan
will never like you.

280
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,680
Stop wasting your time.

281
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,120
Not me? You think he'll like you?

282
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,790
Look at your lousy shape.

283
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,080
We all are not blind.
We all know Brother Yan is handsome.

284
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,680
But he's colder than ice.

285
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,450
All the women here have tried it.

286
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,480
He just won't budge. What makes you
think you are any different?

287
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,240
I'm different from all of you!

288
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,090
I'm younger and more
beautiful than all of you.

289
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,060
Laugh all you want!
Laugh until your teeth fall off!

290
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:56,120
The handmaidens here told me
you never talked to any of them.

291
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,480
Are you a mute?

292
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:05,330
I forgot. Mutes can't get into the palace.

293
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:15,510
You have to deliver dung carts every day,
while I must scrub the commodes.

294
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,760
We are colleagues.

295
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,570
Why won't you talk to me?

296
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,030
The girls are very fond of you.

297
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,030
They think you're handsome.

298
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,940
I think so too.

299
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,440
I've had my fair share of time
in the Forbidden City,

300
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,370
and you are the best-looking eunuch
I've seen so far.

301
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,700
Why did you hit me?

302
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,340
You think I want to talk to you?

303
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:52,910
Work is so tiring every day.
Others are simply ignoring me.

304
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,180
I can only talk to you
to keep my sanity in check.

305
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,010
But, Jin Xiu used to stalk Guard Fuca.

306
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,000
Guard Fuca, you know who he is?

307
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,400
That is the biological brother
of Her Majesty.

308
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,040
An imperial bodyguard of the inner palace.

309
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:22,520
But that time, Jin Xiu wasn't
pestering him endlessly.

310
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,190
Maybe Jin Xiu does like you sincerely.

311
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,430
If you don't get some food,
you won't have any once mealtime is over.

312
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,420
I got you some.

313
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,720
It wasn't easy getting this.

314
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:48,120
This is...

315
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,600
Your Highness, have you forgotten?
You wore it when you were still a maiden.

316
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,480
Because it's too old
and barely has any value,

317
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,980
you didn't sell it last time.

318
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,160
Groom for me.

319
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:06,200
I'm going to Shoukang Palace to
pay respects to Consort Dowager Yu.

320
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,280
Your Highness, you must not!

321
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,790
She was punished by the heavens.
You mustn't associate with her.

322
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:14,400
His Majesty even stopped the
Empress Dowager from coming back.

323
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,800
You have no reason to be there.

324
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,580
Hurry up. Stop talking.

325
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,890
Yes.

326

[Memorial Tablet of Consort Dowager Yu]

327
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:42,560
Prince He, my condolences.

328
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,700
With all the consorts
in this Forbidden City,

329
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:51,030
they think my mother was punished
by heaven, which means shaming.

330
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,980
Everyone has been avoiding her.
Why are you even here?

331
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:57,600
It's just normal for
lightning to strike...

332
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,120
the Forbidden City during summer
and burn the building.

333
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,520
These are all just unfortunate accidents.

334
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,780
We should respect the dead.

335
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,480
Paying respect to
the deceased is only proper.

336
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,440
I am only here to pay my respect.

337
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,850
Your Highness,
don't push yourself too hard.

338
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,180
I'm fine.

339
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,400
Your Highness has been guarding
Shoukang Palace for days...

340
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,130
and won't leave no matter what.

341
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,800
You're still sick. Why do this?

342
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,170
Everyone says that I'm absurd.

343
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,510
They find it repulsive to even talk to me.

344
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,180
Your Highness Consort Xian,
you should leave,

345
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,210
this could invite gossips.

346
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,200
Your Highness has lost a loved one.

347
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:44,500
I can understand your grief.
Please take care of your health.

348
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,490
Do this not for yourself,
but for Consort Dowager Yu.

349
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:52,530
She loved her child so much.
If she knew what you are doing,

350
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,570
she would never rest in peace.

351
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,470
Consort Xian!

352
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,080
Your Highness, what is it?

353
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,470
Thanks.

354
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,330
[Come, have one.]

355
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,540
[Catch the thief!]

356
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,560
Your Highness, please go in.

357
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:11,460
[Hoifa-Nara Manor]

358
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,200
Your Highness, why did you
go to Shoukang Palace?

359
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,870
I saved a person once...

360
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,200
and brought him safely back to his home.

361
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,120
But it happened so long ago
even I forgot about it.

362
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,230
He must have forgotten it too.

363
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:40,780
I must think of a way to jog his memory.

364
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:43,230
Consort Xian!

365
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,430
Your Highness, you need anything?

366
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,280
Thanks.

367
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,760
I only know Prince He
is so absurd and silly.

368
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:08,200
You should stay away from him.

369
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,250
With His Majesty around,

370
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:14,580
Hong Zhou can only be absurd.
The more absurd he is, the better.

371
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,090
Your Highness, I'm getting more confused.

372
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,030
Consort Chun has come.
She has been waiting for you.

373
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,500
-[Fourth Brother.]
-[Hong Zhou!]

374
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,990
[Are you all right?]

375
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,200
[Hong Zhou, when brothers fight,
don't get too serious.]

376
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,080
[You've hurt Fourth Prince.]

377
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,000
[Mother, I didn't mean it.]

378
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,600
[Blades cut regardless of who you are.]

379
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,950
[He didn't mean it.
Mother Yu, don't be overly worried.]

380
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,040
[Only because you are kind enough
not to blame him.]

381
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:45,240
[From now on, I surely keep an eye on him
so he won't hurt you again.]

382
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,180
[Fourth Prince, let's dress
your wound first.]

383
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,270
[Mother, I really didn't mean it.]

384
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,450
[Curse you! What did tell you?]

385
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,600
[Hong Li is your father's favourite.]

386
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,450
[He will inherit the throne
from your father!]

387
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:06,150
[Your action today might bring us
to our early graves!]

388
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,000
[What have I always told you?]

389
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,800
[Have you forgotten?
Have you not been listening to me?]

390
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,070
[We all are sons of His Majesty.]

391
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,200
[We all are princes of the Qing Empire!]

392
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,400
[Why should I be yielding?]

393
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,950
[Why?]

394
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,090
[Hong Zhou,]

395
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,660
[I know you're outstanding
in many aspects.]

396
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,090
[But...]

397
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,920
[you're just not
the favoured son of His Majesty.]

398
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,980
[If you don't stop trying to surpass him,]

399
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,150
[you will only live in more pain.]

400
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,440
[I don't ask that you become prestigious,]

401
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,830
[I only ask that you live.]

402
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,350
[I want to protect you.]

403
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,550
[Do you know that?]

404
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,040
[Hong Zhou, I beg you.]

405
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,980
[Give it up.]

406
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,480
[That is my birth right.]

407
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,330
[Why must I give it up?]

408
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:07,940
Mother...

409
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,080
Consort Xian,

410
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:29,420
I heard Imperial Concubine Jia's sister
will be entering the palace.

411
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,710
You must be cautious.

412
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,330
And the reason being what?

413
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:40,159
Once she enters the palace,
she surely will rack her brain...

414
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,929
to take back Yong Cheng.
After all,

415
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,159
that is why she is coming here.

416
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,440
As long as Yong Cheng is fine,
whoever takes care of him...

417
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,239
is fine by me.

418
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,520
Although that is right,

419
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,090
you still have to make plans for yourself.

420
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,530
This might sound harsh,

421
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,440
but you've been here for years
and still don't have any child.

422
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,210
Without any children by your side,
what will you do in the future?

423
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:10,850
Look at Consort Dowager Guo
and Consort Dowager Yu.

424
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:14,600
Although they both were
the Imperial Consorts of the late Emperor,

425
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,760
one had a sad and tragic life,
the other one was struck down by heaven.

426
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,220
But she had a son to
send her off after her death.

427
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,680
It makes a difference.

428
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,880
Sister, you care about my future,

429
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,310
why not plan for yourself...

430
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,610
while you're still young?

431
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,240
All my life, I've followed the Empress.

432
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:41,500
I will take care of her son
like he is my own.

433
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,170
I only hope that one day, when I'm gone,

434
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:49,000
there will be someone who will
remember this sincerity of mine...

435
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,140
and pay their respect for me.
That's all I ask.

436
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,800
You are very loyal to the Empress.

437
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,560
It's really admirable.

438
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,460
Loyal?

439
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,670
Yes. It's indeed loyalty.

440
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:11,150
Sister, I won.

441
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,490
I got so distracted.

442
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,240
It's really one wrong move
and the whole game is lost.

443
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:25,470
Sister, good game.

444
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,230
Ying Luo.

445
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,700
Your Highness.

446
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,660
I like this tea.

447
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,120
It tastes sour and sweet.
What did you put in it?

448
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:57,020
Ying Luo left me a list.

449
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:01,380
She said you're currently pregnant,
so you would like sour food.

450
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,400
She told me not to use tea leaves.

451
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,730
I put some sour plums
in the water to give it some flavour.

452
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,550
Your Highness,
is Ying Luo not coming back?

453
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,210
I thought you never saw
eye to eye with her.

454
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,260
She would argue with me every day.

455
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:25,210
It was quite lively.
But suddenly, she's gone.

456
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,730
I'm not used to the silence.

457
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,450
It's just that I...

458
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,400
can't bring her back.

459
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:48,080
Who knows what Fu Heng would do...

460
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,500
once he found out.

461
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,640
The palace is already on curfew.
You can't go.

462
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,280
I won't let anyone notice me.

463
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:06,400
Fu Heng, I've checked.

464
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:09,710
This is the decree of Her Majesty.
You can't disobey her.

465
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,990
Fu Heng!

466
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,850
Fu Heng!

467
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,010
You never listen!

468
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,550
The stench is not coming off.

469
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:37,050
Why are you here?

470
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,550
Come with me.

471
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,840
What are you doing? Fu Heng!

472
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,860
I'm going to take you to His Majesty
and be the witness to our marriage.

473
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,260
I'm not going.

474
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,480
Ying Luo, I don't want you
to stay in this place.

475
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,650
His Majesty already said it.

476
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,630
If I got anywhere near you,

477
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,460
he will have my head for it.

478
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:07,370
It's not like I would
risk my life for you.

479
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,230
I won't let him harm you.

480
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,680
And then? You will anger His Majesty...

481
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:19,630
and get punished for it.
I don't want a criminal for husband.

482
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,360
I will live forever in shame.

483
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,010
You always so demeaning.

484
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,210
You're just scaring me away. Am I right?

485
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,440
I gave it a long thought
about every thing you say.

486
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,820
You have always seen
Her Majesty as your benefactor.

487
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,820
You don't want to destroy my future.

488
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:43,120
You don't want to drag
the whole Fuca Clan into trouble.

489
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:46,580
So you tried everything
to stay away from me.

490
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:50,610
Your way of protecting me
is hurting me.

491
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,640
Do I not...

492
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,610
appear as a responsible man to you?

493
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,790
Young Master,
you came from a noble family.

494
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,620
You're a scholar and a brave warrior.

495
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:14,540
You're even an Imperial Bodyguard.
You have a very promising future.

496
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,490
It's not worth it...

497
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,410
to give it up just for me.

498
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,370
I don't care about a bright career.

499
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,370
Neither should you.

500
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:24,840
What about your ambition?

501
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,200
Every time I am at the Guard's Office,

502
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,900
I see military books on your table...

503
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,710
[and by your bed side.]

504
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,920
[You want to join the battlefield.]

505
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:42,910
You want to amount to glory and be
remembered for generations to come.

506
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,950
Am I right?

507
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,300
Yes.

508
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,170
But does it matter?

509
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,640
Because of me, you might
anger His Majesty...

510
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:55,810
and lose every chance you have.

511
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:01,200
Do you want to waste your days
and accomplish nothing in life?

512
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,410
Ying Luo, I'm going to ask this once.

513
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,840
You're a person with reason.

514
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:11,790
You approached me first
to get my attention.

515
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,840
And now you are giving up
without good reason.

516
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:18,120
What about the affection
and love that you owe me?

517
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,290
How are you going to pay me back?

518
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,040
You're never going to
make up for it, am I right?

519
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,900
You can make up for it
with your promise.

520
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:44,070
You want me to make amend. Is that it?

521
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,470
So be it.

522
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,610
Ying Luo, what are you doing?

523
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,360
Ying Luo.

524
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:00,020
What are you doing?

525
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,360
Didn't you want me
to repay your affection?

526
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,360
I am doing it now.

527
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,250
Wei Ying Luo, you are unbelievable.

528
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,840
Losing virginity could mean death to you.

529
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,230
I would rather die than owing a debt.

530
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:22,050
You're the most ruthless woman I've seen.

531
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:23,520
Maybe...

532
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,270
the stench would disgust you.

533
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:30,320
It's not my fault then.

534
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,520
You really think that I'm a gentleman...

535
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,600
and am at a loss of what to do with you?

536
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,330
Even a gentleman is still a man.

537
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:40,440
You're wrong.
