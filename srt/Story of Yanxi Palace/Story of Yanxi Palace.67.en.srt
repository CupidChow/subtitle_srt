[Story of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 67]

3
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,450
I swear to Heaven.

4
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,360
I have never harmed the Fifth Prince...

5
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,220
or known Yong Cheng's evil deeds.

6
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,110
If I lie,
I shall be struck by lightning...

7
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,790
and suffer a terrible death!

8
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,870
Father!

9
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,830
She's lying!

10
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,639
She's a pretentious and heartless woman!

11
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,130
Concubine Shun once warned me...

12
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,430
that the Empress can
do anything for her son!

13
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,829
She wants to eliminate
me and my Fifth Brother...

14
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:20,510
to assist her own son!

15
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,190
Father,

16
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,790
please believe me!

17
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,670
I'm begging you!

18
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,230
Your Highness, calm down.

19
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,870
We'll know the truth...

20
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,829
once the investigation is done.

21
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,870
Your Majesty, the supervisor eunuch
in the Prince's Residence...

22
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,670
has already checked
the food of the Fourth Prince.

23
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,470
The food has no poison.

24
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,470
As for Zhen,

25
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:55,710
the imperial physician has testified
that she's indeed bedridden.

26
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:59,070
And, Zhen personally said that...

27
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,990
she has not met the Fourth Prince tonight.

28
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,470
Impossible.

29
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,070
This is impossible!

30
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,310
Mother clearly wanted to poison me.

31
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,270
She wanted to poison me.

32
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:16,230
I heard it and saw it myself!

33
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,650
Where is that eunuch?

34
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,710
Jin Zhong is missing.

35
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:25,590
I've already ordered people
to search the palace.

36
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,990
Now I see!

37
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,470
It was you.

38
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:33,950
It was you!

39
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:39,430
-You plotted everything!
-Your Highness!

40
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,710
Mother!

41
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,590
Why are you doing this to me?

42
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,710
I treated you like my real mother!

43
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,750
Why?

44
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,829
I'm not your real son,

45
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,910
so you want to kill me?

46
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,270
So, in your heart,

47
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:08,230
I'm just a pawn that you
can sacrifice anytime!

48
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,230
Yong Cheng,

49
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,990
are you going to continue
down the wrong path?

50
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:19,470
Your Highness.

51
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,200
Please watch your manners.

52
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,350
What did I…

53
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,030
What did I do wrong?

54
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,870
I admit that I'm not talented,

55
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,230
so I tried my best to work hard.

56
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,590
But be it Father or my teachers,

57
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:45,890
all of them sing praises
for only Fifth Brother.

58
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,750
I know that I'm not
the son of the Empress.

59
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,909
Hence, I did my best to be filial.

60
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,230
But in your heart,

61
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:02,550
I can't even compare
to the Twelfth Prince!

62
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,350
Why?

63
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,830
Why?

64
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,910
I didn't want to disappoint Father.

65
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:20,870
I wanted to become your real son.

66
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,630
But I'm not.

67
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,430
I'm not!

68
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,990
In your eyes,

69
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,470
I'm just a clown.

70
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,350
A clown!

71
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:46,230
-Yong Cheng.
-Your Majesty, be careful!

72
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,390
Why?

73
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,470
Mother, why did you do this to me?

74
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,430
Lock him up in the Imperial Clan Court.

75
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,470
Your Majesty.

76
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,710
Why?

77
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,550
Why?

78
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,350
Mother!

79
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:16,570
Fu Heng, follow me.

80
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:17,710
Yes, Your Majesty.

81
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,470
Your Majesty.

82
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:22,870
Your Majesty.

83
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,650
His Majesty must be upset
after such an unfortunate incident.

84
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,730
Let's continue tomorrow.

85
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,030
Do you think Yong Cheng was the culprit?

86
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,909
Your Majesty, I don't know.

87
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,710
You do know.

88
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,710
You just don't dare say it.

89
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:57,510
Your Majesty, I believe the
Fourth Prince was speaking the truth.

90
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,680
He did sabotage the Fifth Prince's musket,

91
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:04,790
but he didn't touch the new musket
borrowed from the musket camp.

92
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:09,230
Perhaps the Fifth Prince's injury
was indeed an accident.

93
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,470
Everything happens for a reason.

94
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,630
Perhaps Yong Cheng didn't intend to kill.

95
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,400
But he is narrow-minded...

96
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,340
and stoops down to underhanded methods.

97
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:28,270
Also, someone is manipulating him.

98
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,370
One simple move...

99
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,530
has harmed two of my sons.

100
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,270
Brilliant tactic.

101
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,510
Brilliant scheming!

102
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,430
Yong Cheng is the stupidest!

103
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:56,030
Now that things have turned out
this way, even I can't save him.

104
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,170
Let him stay in the Imperial Clan Court...

105
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,160
and reflect on his mistake.

106
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:07,790
Your Majesty.

107
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:10,310
It was the Fourth Prince's own
obtuseness and ignorance...

108
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,790
that drove him to commit a sin.

109
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,310
The truth has now been revealed,

110
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,670
and he has been locked up
in the Imperial Clan Court.

111
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:18,490
Why are you still uneasy?

112
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,770
Yong Cheng's action was indeed stupid,

113
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,490
but I raised him up after all.

114
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,830
Now that he's suspected
of injuring the Fifth Prince,

115
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,890
do you think His Majesty will believe...

116
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,170
that I'm not involved?

117
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,010
But His Majesty didn't
say anything about it.

118
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,830
Suspicions are no longer
as they are once questioned.

119
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:37,049
His Majesty didn't even
give me any chance to explain.

120
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:38,590
Isn't that obvious enough?

121
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:40,510
That idiot, Yong Cheng.

122
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:45,230
His impulsive actions
have cast suspicion on me.

123
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,570
-Your Majesty!
-Stop talking!

124
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,510
My head aches!

125
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,190
Summon a physician.

126
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,750
Now?

127
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:55,230
Hurry, go!

128
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:01,720
Physician Zhang was called
to Chengqian Palace last night.

129
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:05,310
Apparently, the Empress
is having headaches again.

130
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,570
Two hours later,

131
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,490
just as Physician Zhang returned,

132
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,070
he was summoned back again.

133
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,850
In my opinion,

134
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:14,110
the Empress is seriously ill.

135
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,390
No need to bother.

136
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,230
Are there any news
from the investigator...

137
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,490
you sent to Jiangnan?

138
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:23,830
While Physician Ye returned
to his hometown three years ago,

139
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,870
he still practices medicine
as he travels around.

140
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,710
Half a year ago, he settled in Hangzhou.

141
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:30,150
I've already sent people to seek him.

142
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,640
Had I known that Yong Qi would get hurt,

143
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,390
I wouldn't have allowed
Ye Tian Shi to leave.

144
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,990
Your Highness, even if you kept him here,

145
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,870
Physician Ye would still leave.

146
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:44,390
He loathes life in the Forbidden City.

147
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,390
He would leave sooner or later.

148
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,910
No matter what,

149
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,150
he must be found.

150
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,630
I believe that...

151
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,310
he can save Yong Qi.

152
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,350
I surely will do my best.

153
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:02,790
But, now that misfortune has
befallen the Fourth and Fifth Princes,

154
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,990
the Fifteenth Prince...

155
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:47,990
You're here.

156
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:50,710
Didn't Your Majesty say...

157
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:53,170
that a proper lifestyle
leads to a long life?

158
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,230
Burning the midnight oil like this...

159
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,030
is bad for your health.

160
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,550
I knew you'd come.

161
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,110
Why?

162
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,910
To seek justice for Yong Qi.

163
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,990
If you still remain calm by now,

164
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:17,550
then that would be nothing like you.

165
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,470
When I walked in,

166
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,410
I felt the urge to snatch your memorials,

167
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,170
throw them all on the table...

168
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:30,390
and ask you how you will punish
the Fourth Prince.

169
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,830
Why didn't you do so?

170
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,910
You look too exhausted.

171
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:54,270
I can't bear to do it.

172
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,590
I wanted to ask you this.

173
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:18,590
Yong Qi is a golden child.

174
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,790
Now that his wings are broken,

175
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:26,830
can you bear to see him
mope around and sulk all day?

176
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:31,330
He didn't urge you
to seek justice for him...

177
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,990
because he is a kind child.

178
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,110
But I'm not.

179
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:40,590
I want to seek justice for him.

180
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:45,390
But on second thought,

181
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:49,310
to me,

182
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,880
the Fourth Prince is just an outsider.

183
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,950
But to you,

184
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,950
he's your biological son.

185
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,670
Both princes are your sons.

186
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,790
No matter what decision you make,

187
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,870
it is bound to be hurtful.

188
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,310
If it were someone else,

189
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,350
she'd say...

190
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:24,230
my sons are also her sons.

191
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,150
Only you...

192
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,310
speak your mind so plainly.

193
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,550
You clearly know that those are all lies.

194
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:37,310
Why do you still love to hear them?

195
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:43,350
That's because lies
are pleasing to the ear.

196
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,830
But you know that...

197
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:49,810
even our ten fingers
are not equal in length.

198
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,230
How is it possible
to love a child sincerely...

199
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,590
when he's not from your own womb?

200
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,550
You seem to be...

201
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,870
suggesting something.

202
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,150
I have no evidence.

203
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,110
I dare not make accusations.

204
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,470
But Chengqian Palace...

205
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:18,110
is definitely involved in this matter.

206
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,870
Your Majesty,

207
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,170
you lost two outstanding sons...

208
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,190
in just a day's time.

209
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,910
I feel so sorry for you.

210
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,390
My heart aches for you.

211
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,480
But I'm worried...

212
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,870
that the same misfortune
might befall Yong Yan.

213
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:40,150
Impossible.

214
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,670
Are you sure?

215
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:47,230
I won't let anyone hurt Yong Yan.

216
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,710
Your Majesty.

217
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:04,390
I believe you.

218
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,230
But I don't believe her.

219
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:19,950
Li Yu.

220
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:26,530
Your Majesty.

221
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,010
I want a decree prepared.

222
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,720
I am conferring the Fifth Prince
the title of Prince Rong.

223
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,150
One more thing.

224
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,030
Starting today,

225
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:40,590
the Imperial bodyguards are
to guard the Princes' Residence in shifts.

226
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:41,950
Have I made myself clear?

227
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,010
Yes, Your Majesty.

228
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,670
Your Majesty.

229
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,930
The Imperial Academy
of Medicine reported...

230
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:52,790
that the Empress has been
suffering from headaches since last night.

231
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,510
She's seriously ill.

232
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:04,030
Your Majesty, have some tea.

233
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:07,390
Has the Imperial Academy of Medicine
sent the news out?

234
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,670
They have.

235
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:11,200
His Majesty has a court meeting today.

236
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:13,070
He must be busy right now.

237
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:16,470
But I'm sure he will come
and visit you once he's free.

238
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,590
You haven't even fully recovered.

239
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,310
Go back and rest.

240
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:25,470
There are other servants here.

241
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,950
Take good care of yourself.

242
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:30,230
I'm fine.

243
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:33,880
I don't trust the other servants
to serve you, Your Majesty.

244
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,390
Get me a mirror.

245
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,430
I want to set my hair.

246
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,850
Your Majesty, you're unwell.

247
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:44,260
When you've recovered,

248
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:46,030
I'll do your hair and makeup.

249
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,550
Just get it here.

250
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:50,990
Stop.

251
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:54,570
Look at you.

252
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:56,590
What a drab choice of attire.

253
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:59,510
Are you trying to anger the Empress?

254
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,790
Then what should I do?

255
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,510
Look.

256
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:08,589
How beautiful this flower is!

257
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:11,690
I think...

258
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:14,310
this flower would look good on your head.

259
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:17,670
Look, how pretty!

260
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,589
When the Empress sees it later,

261
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:20,730
she'll be so happy.

262
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,640
Once she's happy, she'll get well soon.

263
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:25,750
Don't let Zhen see us.

264
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:27,230
She'll scold me.

265
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:30,990
Tell me.

266
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,190
What does she usually scold about?

267
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,790
Supervisor Yuan, don't you know...

268
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:37,350
that Zhen doesn't allow
us to talk to you...

269
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,830
as if we're going to eat you.

270
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,950
Zhen.

271
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,990
Am I really getting old?

272
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,470
Of course not.

273
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:54,510
Your face is still as beautiful as before.

274
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,230
But look here.

275
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:59,110
I can't hide it anymore.

276
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,010
Your Majesty.

277
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:03,420
And the wrinkles
at the corners of my eyes.

278
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,350
Look.

279
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,670
Look.

280
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:09,190
Your Majesty, there's nothing.

281
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,950
I don't see anything.

282
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,070
Why are you also lying to me?

283
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:16,470
Why are you lying to me?

284
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,710
Your Majesty, I'm not.

285
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,490
You're thinking too much.

286
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,510
You're just as beautiful as before.

287
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:26,190
Your Majesty, it's time
to take your medicine.

288
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:27,630
Just put it down.

289
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,580
Your Majesty, the physician said
that you must take it while it's hot.

290
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,270
Who are you trying to seduce?

291
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,230
Your Majesty.

292
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,030
I...

293
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,810
Your Majesty, I won't do it again!

294
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:53,150
-I'll never do it again!
-What happened?

295
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:56,790
Your Majesty.

296
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:58,750
My empress.

297
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:01,390
Did the servants anger you?

298
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,470
That's enough.

299
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,030
You are not feeling well.

300
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,110
Just take a rest.

301
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,670
Leave now.

302
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:12,350
Thank you, Your Majesty.

303
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,190
My empress.

304
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,710
don't get agitated...

305
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:26,270
over such trifling matters.

306
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:30,310
I think Your Majesty must know
why I'm in a bad mood...

307
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:32,320
till I vented my anger on a servant.

308
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,170
Even if you don't say it,

309
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,830
you suspect me.

310
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,630
Even though I swore on my life,

311
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,190
you still think...

312
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,710
that it was me who
harmed the Fifth Prince...

313
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:44,230
and framed Yong Cheng.

314
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,250
Your Majesty, think about it.

315
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,720
Whenever Yong Cheng fell sick in the past,

316
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,790
I'd stay with him all night long.

317
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,690
Once he had recovered,

318
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,250
then I'd fall sick instead.

319
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:00,510
I sacrificed so much for him
only to be repaid in grudges.

320
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:03,310
Is it because I didn't do enough?

321
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:05,030
Your Majesty,

322
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:07,310
I don't care even if
others misunderstand me...

323
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,590
as long as you believe me.

324
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:11,870
Summon the physician.

325
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,290
Your Majesty, I'm not sick.

326
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:15,550
My mind is clear right now, Your Majesty!

327
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:19,210
Your Majesty.

328
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:21,550
Get the physician to check on the Empress.

329
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,610
Yes, Your Majesty.

330
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:28,490
Drag that lowly bitch out
and cane her thirty strokes.

331
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:29,550
Your Majesty.

332
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:33,240
Dressing up to vie for attention
is disallowed among servants.

333
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:34,790
She broke the rules.

334
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:36,070
If I don't punish her,

335
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:37,950
then no one will follow the rules.

336
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,550
Yes, Your Majesty.

337
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:47,630
His Majesty just wouldn't believe me.

338
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,430
Zhen.

339
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:57,890
I did treat Yong Ji better
than I treated Yong Cheng,

340
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:02,030
but I still treated him like my own son.

341
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:05,270
Why would he try to frame me?

342
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:10,110
Was it because of greed?

343
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:16,080
There's something fishy
about this whole incident.

344
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,710
I need to think it through.

345
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,230
But my head really hurts now!

346
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:26,470
Your Majesty, let's talk
about it some other time.

347
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,480
You should take a good rest for now.

348
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:40,290
Supervisor Yuan, you made me suffer!
-Shh.

349
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:41,600
Supervisor Yuan.

350
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,190
Yun Xiang.

351
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:48,190
Her Majesty instructed me
to bring you somewhere.

352
00:21:58,470 --> 00:21:59,630
Your Majesty.

353
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,030
Have you found him?

354
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:05,110
I've ordered people to search
the whole Forbidden City,

355
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:07,030
but we couldn't find Jin Zhong.

356
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,310
But...

357
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:11,390
we found a female corpse inside a well.

358
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,950
The body has been taken out.

359
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:18,230
It is badly battered
and was so morbid to look at.

360
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,750
Have you found out who she is?

361
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,670
It is Yun Xiang, a palace maid.

362
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:24,770
Who?

363
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:25,980
Have you forgotten?

364
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,190
She was the palace maid...

365
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:30,030
who got punished yesterday
in Chengqian Palace.

366
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,150
Your Majesty.

367
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:47,150
This is collagen from pig trotters.

368
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:48,730
Apply it on your face every night,

369
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:51,310
then wash it off in the morning
with physalis water.

370
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:53,390
The wrinkles will then
completely disappear.

371
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:54,910
They are gone.

372
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,270
They really are gone.

373
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:06,710
Greetings, Your Majesty.

374
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,130
Your Majesty.

375
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:11,670
This is a bird gifted by Prince He.

376
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:14,270
Doesn't it look exactly the same
as the one before?

377
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,530
It's exactly the same.

378
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,510
Marvelous.

379
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,790
My luck has returned.

380
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:23,230
Your Majesty,

381
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:26,370
Yun Xiang has committed suicide
by jumping into a well.

382
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:27,490
What did you say?

383
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:30,550
Supervisor Li was searching the
whereabouts of Eunuch Jinzhong.

384
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:33,080
They discovered a shoe by
a well in the western palace,

385
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,350
so they dredged the well
and discovered Yun Xiang's corpse.

386
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:38,210
Does His Majesty know about this?

387
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,390
Yes, he does.

388
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,550
Wench!

389
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,310
Wench!

390
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:45,430
Wench!

391
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,410
Useless bastard!

392
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:51,370
Why mention such inauspicious things
so early in the morning?

393
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:52,500
Take it away. Hurry!

394
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:01,870
Why are the wrinkles back?

395
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,150
They were gone earlier!

396
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:06,830
Zhen!

397
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:08,170
-Your Majesty!
-Zhen!

398
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:09,430
-Your Majesty!
-Look.

399
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:10,990
They weren't there just now!

400
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:13,790
Your Majesty, I'll prepare another batch.

401
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:19,130
This is just self-deception.

402
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,310
Self-deception!

403
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:25,230
The old parrot is already dead.

404
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:28,390
A new one can't replace it.

405
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:30,390
Look at this face of mine.

406
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:35,000
It can never return to how
it was twenty years ago.

407
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,430
Get out!

408
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,870
All of you, out!

409
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:46,230
Let go of my hand!

410
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,690
Her Majesty was so sad.

411
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:52,370
How could you do such a thing?

412
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,650
What did I do?

413
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:56,710
Let me ask you,

414
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,270
how did Yun Xiang die?

415
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,070
Her Majesty punished her,

416
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:02,520
and she couldn't get over it,
so she committed suicide.

417
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,560
Punishment is common here.

418
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:07,470
Why would she commit suicide
over a small punishment?

419
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:09,590
Zhen!

420
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:13,230
You said that you would
support and trust me.

421
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,230
Have you forgotten?

422
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:16,830
I haven't.

423
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:19,310
But His Majesty now has
a worse impression...

424
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,470
on Her Majesty.

425
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,670
Are you really helping her?

426
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:23,830
Of course I am.

427
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,110
Only by doing so...

428
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:31,290
can we make Her Majesty
see His Majesty's real colours.

429
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,550
Only by doing so...

430
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:35,830
can we make Her Majesty break free
from her own illusions.

431
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,680
-But…
-No buts!

432
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:40,510
Zhen. Think about the current situation.

433
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,490
The Fifth Prince is now crippled.

434
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:44,190
The Fourth Prince is the culprit.

435
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:45,850
The Fifteenth Prince is still young.

436
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:48,290
The only one who can
succeed the throne now...

437
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:50,230
is the Twelfth Prince.

438
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:53,550
I didn't betray my promise.

439
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:54,930
I'm fulfilling it!

440
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:57,430
I have been helping the Empress.

441
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:01,230
But Her Majesty
is feeling more miserable.

442
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:02,920
She's mentally ill now.

443
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:06,290
If we continue to agitate her
like this, she'll break down.

444
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:08,550
She won't.

445
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:09,790
Zhen.

446
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:13,190
Her Majesty is stronger than you think.

447
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:15,150
She's smarter than I am.

448
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:18,200
She surely will know
that everything I'm doing now...

449
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,200
is for her own sake
and the Twelfth Prince's.

450
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,060
Zhen, believe me.

451
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:24,910
You must believe me!

452
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:30,430
I...

453
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,110
believe you.

454
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:41,060
I heard that she was maltreated,
so she committed suicide out of anger.

455
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,590
Maltreated?

456
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:47,070
From what I heard, she was punished
with thirty strokes of flogging.

457
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:49,710
Consort Qing,

458
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,770
a palace maid committing suicide
is a grave crime.

459
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:53,830
Even her family will get implicated.

460
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:55,970
She must have been tortured horribly.

461
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:59,510
Otherwise, why would she commit
suicide over a measly punishment?

462
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:02,910
Although palace maids are servants,

463
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:06,390
we cannot punish them at our own whims.

464
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:08,830
Someone is now dead because of this.

465
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:12,470
If news of this spreads,

466
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:15,230
what will people think
of the Forbidden City?

467
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:18,730
How will the Empress continue to govern?

468
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:19,830
Your Highness.

469
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:23,510
It is just a rumour that
the palace maid killed herself...

470
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,870
because of maltreatment.

471
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:29,350
The wounds on her body are visible.

472
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:31,670
You can't fake that.

473
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:33,830
Your Highness.

474
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:36,230
The Empress is ill.

475
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:38,990
That's why her temperament
changed drastically.

476
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,150
ill?

477
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,070
In my opinion,

478
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:44,670
she's mentally ill.

479
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:50,230
Your Highness, the Empress is here.

480
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:58,550
Greetings, Your Highness.

481
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,270
You may rise.

482
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:04,430
Greetings, Your Majesty.

483
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:15,990
Everyone's here today.

484
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:17,910
Did anything good happen?

485
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,090
We were just talking about your illness
and were planning to visit you.

486
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:24,610
We never thought that you'd come here.

487
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:28,710
As far as I see, Your Majesty,

488
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,930
you don't seem ill at all.

489
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:33,410
I only had minor headaches a few days ago.

490
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:35,720
Physician Zhang exercised
acupuncture on me...

491
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,180
and I feel much better now.

492
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:41,390
Sickness is inevitable.

493
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:44,470
Just seek treatment when illness strikes.

494
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:48,030
Empress. You are the leader of the harem.

495
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,320
You must take good care of your health.

496
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:54,150
Don't conceal your ailments
and avoid the physician.

497
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:57,990
I'm very grateful for
your concern, Your Highness.

498
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:59,630
Look at this robe.

499
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:01,770
I just had it tailored last month.

500
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:04,630
It feels tighter when I wear it now.

501
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:07,250
I've put on some weight.

502
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:08,470
That's good, then.

503
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:11,550
I was worried that
your ailment may deter you...

504
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:14,670
from accompanying His Majesty
on his Southern tour.

505
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,830
Now that you've fully recovered,

506
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,710
that won't be a problem then.

507
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,310
Yes, Your Highness.

508
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:24,310
I was worried that I might
disappoint His Majesty and you,

509
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:26,330
but now that I'm well,

510
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:29,430
I will accompany and attend to you.

511
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:32,670
The weather's getting warm.

512
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,630
Don't let the maid...

513
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:37,970
take the princesses
out to play for too long.

514
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:39,870
Bring them back for a nap soon.

515
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:43,410
Zhao Hua loves
the Eight Treasures Duck dish.

516
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,850
Ask the chef to cook it again today.

517
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:48,150
Don't put in chestnuts and glutinous rice.

518
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:51,750
They might be hard to digest
if the children eat too much.

519
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,160
Yes, Your Highness.

520
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,270
No.

521
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:58,750
It's better to bring the two princesses...

522
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,710
with us on the trip.

523
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,880
I don't feel at ease
if they are left in the Forbidden City.

524
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:07,390
Your Highness.

525
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:09,750
Zhao Hua and Zhao Yu
are usually very naughty.

526
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:12,270
His Majesty wants to leave
them here so that...

527
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:14,000
they can be taught about rules.

528
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:17,710
They are still children.

529
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:20,390
Asking them to learn about rules...

530
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:22,310
is waging against their nature.

531
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,990
What are rules?

532
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,950
Rules are what I make.

533
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:27,790
Let me see who dares to say...

534
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:30,870
that the children from Shoukang Palace...

535
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:34,150
are unruly and unrestrained.

536
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,270
Your Highness.

537
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:40,430
The two princesses are young,
especially Zhao Yu.

538
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:43,550
When she joined us on
a hunting trip last year,

539
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:45,710
she fell sick upon returning.

540
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:49,230
The southern tour is an arduous journey.

541
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:50,750
His Majesty is afraid...

542
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:53,470
that the princesses cannot
adapt to the local environment,

543
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,150
so he wants them to stay here.

544
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,470
Fine.

545
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:01,230
Then, Madam Zhao and
Madam Zhou will both stay here.

546
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,720
We should also select another...

547
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,310
four experienced maids to attend to them.

548
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,420
If anything goes wrong,

549
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,370
I'll punish them all!

550
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:11,650
Your Highness, don't worry.

551
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:14,430
The servants will attend
to them meticulously.

552
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:15,950
Your Highness.

553
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:18,890
Will we pass by Suzhou
and Hangzhou during the tour?

554
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:22,150
His Majesty will be supervising...

555
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:25,670
the river works and
navy defense during the tour,

556
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:29,270
so we will be traveling
south along the canal.

557
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:32,590
Consort Ling!

558
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:35,910
Consort Ling!

559
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,710
There's a saying that goes,

560
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:41,030
only by giving your children up
can you catch the wolf.

561
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:44,070
Looks like it was wise of you
to give your children up!

562
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,350
You don't even have children...

563
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,510
to give away.

564
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:51,950
-You...
-Consort Shu.

565
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:55,430
I still don't know how to use
the fragrant hair oil you gave me.

566
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:59,090
I've said it so many times.

567
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:01,900
You need to put some
chrysanthemums into the oil.

568
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:03,710
Can you demonstrate?

569
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:19,030
Your Majesty, please wait.

570
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,760
Consort Ling, what do you need?

571
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:31,790
Your Majesty, are you ill?

572
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,610
I've already explained it very well.

573
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:36,070
Why are you still asking?

574
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:37,870
Are you hoping that I'm sick?

575
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,820
Don't get me wrong, Your Majesty.

576
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:44,870
I noticed that you don't look very well.

577
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,950
I just want to warn you...

578
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:49,750
that if you are really sick,

579
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:53,510
you should stay in the Forbidden City
and focus on recuperating.

580
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:54,990
The tour will be arduous.

581
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:57,550
It won't be good for your health.

582
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:59,050
I'm very healthy.

583
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:00,590
No need for you to worry.

584
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:17,630
Your Highness.

585
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,270
Why do you care if the Empress...

586
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:21,990
joins the southern tour or not?

587
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:25,830
All the children will remain here.

588
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:30,270
I won't be at ease if she stays.

589
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:35,390
That's why she must go with us.

590
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:41,440
The brush and inkstone I gave Yong Yan
are all rare treasures.

591
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:43,710
Why have I never seen him using them?

592
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,510
Yong Yan is still young.

593
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:49,670
I'm afraid that he'd break
such precious items.

594
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:58,470
Sister Na Lan,

595
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:00,750
why are you looking at me like that?

596
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,590
You think I'll hurt Yong Yan, don't you?

597
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,310
Sister Na Lan.

598
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:12,070
It's not like what you think.

599
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:16,750
It's just that the Xuande inkstone
is indeed too valuable.

600
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:18,960
You do think that I'll hurt that child!

601
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:22,190
You've never let him
use anything I gave him,

602
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:24,389
be it clothes, toys, and even stationery!

603
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:25,190
You…

604
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:29,830
You see my good intentions as malice!

605
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:31,330
Sister.

606
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:33,350
Yes, I don't get along with Consort Ling.

607
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:35,070
I keep making her feel bad.

608
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:39,070
I am unlucky.

609
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,350
I'm not as fertile as Wei Ying Luo is.

610
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:45,389
She has three adorable children, and me?

611
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:51,429
I only had the Tenth Prince...

612
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,590
and I lost him.

613
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,950
But Yong Yan...

614
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,430
is such a cute boy!

615
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:05,490
I watched him take his first steps
and speak his first words.

616
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:07,470
I feel happy for him too.

617
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,510
Moreover,

618
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,890
don't forget this is the Forbidden City.

619
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:16,310
How would I dare to hurt a prince?

620
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:20,550
Do you think I'd risk
the lives of my whole clan?

621
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:23,510
I'm not that crazy!

622
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,350
Sister Nalan!

623
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:31,080
Your Highness, be careful.

624
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:35,110
I must have hurt Consort Shu.

625
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:39,310
Your Highness, you were only
looking out for the Fifteenth Prince.

626
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:41,310
Consort Shu will understand.

627
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:45,070
It's my fault.

628
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,390
When we go back,

629
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:49,390
take the brush and inkstone out.

630
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:55,390
Your Majesty, the Empress is here.

631
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,310
Let her in.

632
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:06,430
Greetings, Your Majesty.

633
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:09,790
You may rise.

634
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,870
What's wrong? Why do you look so pale?

635
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,190
I'm fine.

636
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:18,750
I'm just here to let you
check the list of the consorts...

637
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,990
who will join the southern tour.

638
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:24,390
Aren't you sick, my empress?

639
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:28,530
Just let Consort Ling handle this.

640
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:31,710
Your Majesty, I'm the Empress.

641
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,850
For an important event like this,
even if I'm bedridden,

642
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:39,230
I have to help you manage everything,
so I can fulfill my duties.

643
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:44,630
My empress.

644
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:50,160
You should rest in the Forbidden City...

645
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,620
instead of joining the tour,

646
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,750
lest your condition
worsen from exhaustion.

647
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,980
I'm not sick!

648
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,560
As the Empress,

649
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:04,640
I should join this tour
to attend to Empress Dowager.

650
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:07,330
This is basic filial piety and etiquette.

651
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:09,970
If Your Majesty insists me to stay here,

652
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,060
I shall remove my jewelry...

653
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,590
so I can join as a maid
to attend the Empress Dowager.

654
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:20,190
Your Majesty, is this what you want?

655
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:28,750
You clearly are sick.

656
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:30,950
Why do you have to push yourself?

657
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:34,630
We will be traveling a thousand li...

658
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,470
south down the canal.

659
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:39,190
What if you collapse during the trip?

660
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,790
Your Majesty and the Empress Dowager
will not be here.

661
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:43,250
If I were to be left behind,

662
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:44,930
what would the court officials say?

663
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,670
What would the commoners say?

664
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,560
Looks like what you have in mind...

665
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,920
is neither filial piety nor etiquette,

666
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:55,890
but your dignity and
prestige as the Empress.

667
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:56,830
No.

668
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:58,150
My dignity is also...

669
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,350
the Qing Dynasty's decorum and rules.

670
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:02,750
Do you want...

671
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,160
the whole empire to know...

672
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:11,060
that I am merely a puppet to you,
a burden?

673
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,280
-My empress.
-I will go.

674
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,860
I must go!

675
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:20,350
My empress, I'm thinking
for your own good.

676
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,320
You keep misunderstanding me.

677
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:26,070
Why have you become like this?

678
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:28,280
I'm not the one who misunderstood you.

679
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:31,350
You are the one who have
been misunderstanding me!

680
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:38,150
I've made my decision.

681
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:41,070
You'll stay in the Forbidden City.

682
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:41,910
Go back.

683
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:42,790
Your Majesty.

684
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:45,010
This is the first time
I'm talking back to you.

685
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:46,410
No matter how mad you are,

686
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:48,030
I must persist.

687
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,310
My empress.

688
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,470
I will take my leave.

689
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:06,710
Your Majesty.

690
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:08,790
You haven't eaten for the entire day.

691
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:10,230
Please eat something.

692
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:16,670
Your Highness, why do you have to insist?

693
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:20,470
Why won't you just
stay here and recuperate?

694
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,710
His Majesty has visited
the south three times.

695
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,070
He is always joined by...

696
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:29,810
the consorts, the empress
and other ministers.

697
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:34,030
This is a great honor and a privilege.

698
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:35,870
Believe it or not,

699
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:38,430
if I'm not on the list of the tour,

700
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:41,390
all the officials will surely discuss...

701
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,960
if I'm gravely ill to the point of dying.

702
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,060
Or, even committed
an unpardonable mistake...

703
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,730
that incurred His Majesty's disgust.

704
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:54,630
Your Majesty, don't utter
such wretchedness.

705
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,230
Zhen.

706
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:00,310
I am not trying to fight
for a spot in the tour...

707
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:02,190
or fighting for my ego.

708
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:07,150
I'm fighting for my honour and dignity
as the Empress of the Great Qing.

709
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,350
Your Highness.

710
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:16,770
Is my mother still starving herself?

711
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:20,790
-I'll go talk to her.
-Your Highness.

712
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:23,170
You should be studying at this hour.

713
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:24,990
If Her Highness sees you here,

714
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:26,270
she'll get mad again.

715
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:27,550
But...

716
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,720
Just go.

717
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,760
Go.

718
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:46,990
Greetings, Your Highness.

719
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:49,710
Your Highness.

720
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:53,890
The Empress hasn't eaten anything yet.

721
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:56,830
If His Majesty still insists
her to recuperate here,

722
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:57,890
I fear that...

723
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:00,110
Father is doing this for her own good.

724
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,800
Isn't it good for her
to stay and recuperate?

725
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:07,270
Your Highness.

726
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:11,840
Do you know why the Empress
insists on joining the tour?

727
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:13,670
She's doing it for you!

728
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:16,190
For me?

729
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:17,670
Think about it.

730
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:19,890
The Fifth Prince is
currently recuperating.

731
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:21,830
The Fourth Prince is being punished.

732
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:24,290
The whole Forbidden City is in chaos.

733
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:26,190
At this critical moment,

734
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:29,590
if His Majesty doesn't let
the Empress join the tour,

735
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:31,290
this will in turn...

736
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:34,670
affect your future for sure.

737
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:41,030
That's why the Empress keeps
insisting on joining the tour.

738
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:42,990
As for His Majesty,

739
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:46,590
only you can talk to him.

740
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:58,310
Come here.

741
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:03,910
The Twelfth Prince
is rushing to Yangxin Hall.

742
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:06,910
Seek help from Prince Rong now.

743
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,640
Your Highness.

744
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:14,370
His Majesty is now furious
upon hearing that you are not studying.

745
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:15,650
Now that you're here,

746
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:18,190
it will only infuriate him further!

747
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:20,390
Supervisor Li, please tell my father...

748
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:23,230
that his slow-witted son
can't think of another way...

749
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:24,630
to help Mother.

750
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:27,790
Therefore, I hope he'll
accept my sincere plea...

751
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:29,710
and allow my mother
to join him on the tour.

752
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:33,710
Your Highness, you are
putting me in a difficult position.

753
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:36,610
Supervisor Li, I'm begging you!

754
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:38,110
Don't say that!

755
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:40,010
I'm just a servant!

756
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:42,090
"Begging" is an overwhelming word!

757
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:43,590
Please wait here.

758
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:45,110
I'll relay your message.

759
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:04,430
Your Highness.

760
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:06,350
Have some water.

761
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:13,560
Tell him to go back to the study!

762
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:15,190
Your Majesty.

763
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:16,270
Get lost!

764
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:18,230
Yes, Your Majesty.

765
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:28,190
Greetings, Father.

766
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:30,470
Yong Qi?

767
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:31,710
Rise!

768
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:36,370
Have a seat.

769
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:37,510
Thank you, Father.

770
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:47,670
Father, Yong Ji is still a child.

771
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:51,110
It's good that he is filial.

772
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:59,480
He's using filial piety as
an excuse to blackmail me.

773
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:01,830
It's ridiculous!

774
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:02,950
Father,

775
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:06,590
are you stopping Mother from
joining the southern tour...

776
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:08,230
because of me?

777
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:10,390
Yong Qi.

778
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:13,440
This matter has nothing to do with you.

779
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:17,190
The Empress is sick.

780
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:21,430
I hope that she can stay
and nurse her health.

781
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:23,790
You will be traveling
by boat most of the time.

782
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:26,320
The imperial physicians
will be joining too.

783
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:27,510
Father.

784
00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:29,710
Please allow Mother to go.

785
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:31,830
The scenery of Jiangnan is beautiful.

786
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:33,760
Not only does Mother want to see it,

787
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:35,990
but so do I.

788
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:39,110
You?
