[Story Of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 23]

3
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,050
I don't believe in others.

4
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,590
Tell me.

5
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,539
Do you want to kill me?

6
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,880
What are you doing?

7
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,020
I will prove it to you.

8
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,630
Ying Luo.

9
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,250
Will that do now?

10
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,829
It's true.

11
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,740
Noble Consort Gao summoned me
to Chuxiu Palace last night.

12
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,980
She asked me to kill
Her Majesty with poison.

13
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,490
Ying Luo,

14
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,430
did she threaten you?

15
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,670
No.

16
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,320
She told me...

17
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,640
that my sister Man
was violated by Fu Heng.

18
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,320
In order to cover up the crime,

19
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,160
Your Majesty chased her out of the palace
and had her assassinated.

20
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,250
I've never done such a thing.

21
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,280
And I believe Fu Heng would never
commit such loathsome crime.

22
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,840
Your Majesty.

23
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,760
I am not blind.

24
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,290
I know how to tell right from wrong.

25
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,840
Your Majesty taught me
calligraphy and painting whole-heartedly.

26
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,120
Our bond has gone beyond
that of master and servant.

27
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,060
Even if I can think with logics,

28
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,700
I'm not foolish enough...

29
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,820
to believe whatever lies she told me.

30
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,530
You never laced the drink with any poison?

31
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,640
The poison...

32
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,020
is now under the soil
of the Imperial Garden.

33
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,490
You may go see it, Consort Chun.

34
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,980
The patch of grass died because of it.

35
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,750
But why did you keep the pouch?

36
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,579
I wanted to remind myself at all times...

37
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:00,210
so I won't forget to exact
vengeance on my sister's killer.

38
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,010
I must find the murderer.

39
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,400
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

40
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,170
Your Majesty,

41
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,020
this is my personal matter.

42
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,670
I do not want to involve
Your Majesty into it.

43
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,000
But I can help you with the investigation.

44
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,899
I appreciate this, Your Majesty.

45
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,410
I will figure a way
to find the real killer.

46
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,310
Consort Chun,

47
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,130
is there anything else you want to say?

48
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,080
Since you never used the poison,

49
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,810
I have nothing to say.

50
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,360
Your Majesty,

51
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,680
I have work to do.

52
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,890
I take my leave now.

53
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,930
Sister, there are matters I must see to.

54
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,640
I take my leave.

55
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,730
Your Majesty,

56
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:24,460
Wei Ying Luo is ruthless
and unpredictable.

57
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,650
It's best not to keep her by your side.

58
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,330
She might bring further troubles.

59
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,960
Consort Chun, it's true
Ying Luo can be reckless at times.

60
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,080
But I taught her how to read and write.

61
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,170
She has become more composed and calm.

62
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,510
And she's upright and she can
tell the right from wrong.

63
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,930
I think she should be educated.

64
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,440
Furthermore, regarding this matter,

65
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:56,010
my conscience is clear.

66
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,360
I will never chase her out.

67
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,500
However…

68
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,680
That's all I'll say.

69
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,540
I've made up my mind.

70
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,250
Ying Luo.

71
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,480
Are you still going to tell me
you are not involved in this matter?

72
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,000
Do you believe I did it?

73
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,890
If I believe you did it,

74
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,350
I would have killed you.

75
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,420
I wouldn't be wasting
my time debating with you.

76
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,250
Thank you for your trust.

77
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,150
Even if it wasn't you,

78
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,370
you won't be absolved from it.

79
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,470
The jade pendant could be lost by chance.

80
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,520
But your court belt never leaves you.

81
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,650
How could it be left in
the Imperial Garden for no reason?

82
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,570
Unless it was undressed.

83
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,420
Tell me. Why are you doing this?

84
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,320
I think...

85
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,050
on the tenth day of the first month,

86
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,840
someone put on your clothes
and entered the Imperial Garden.

87
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,970
If it's an imperial guard,

88
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,480
he wouldn't have to get changed.

89
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,430
One would want to change into a uniform
only to avoid the patrol.

90
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,000
Which means...

91
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,440
this person must be a royalty attending
the banquet in Qianqing Palace.

92
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,650
As for the eunuch found
by Noble Consort Gao,

93
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,920
he was afraid of the imperial guard,

94
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:38,440
he wouldn't dare to get closer.

95
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,220
He never saw the face.

96
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,159
Noble Consort Gao made me believe that...

97
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,980
the owner of the court belt...

98
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,700
was the real murderer.

99
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,370
-Ying Luo.
-Fu Heng.

100
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,520
With your power and status,

101
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,720
not even Prince Yi can waver you.

102
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:58,220
A normal royal family member
would be terrified by you.

103
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,200
I am curious,

104
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,320
who it is...

105
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,720
that can have you set aside
your reputation and get your protection?

106
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,930
Ying Luo, I am not protecting him.

107
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,430
I am protecting you.

108
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,850
Protecting me?

109
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,620
If the investigation goes on,

110
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,080
you might get more grudges
rather than answers.

111
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,940
I don't want you to risk your life.

112
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,930
So,

113
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,970
you pretend to help and support me,

114
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,480
but the truth is,

115
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,130
you've been secretly
undermining my effort.

116
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,090
Am I right?

117
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,039
I do it for your own good.

118
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,250
Fine.

119
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:44,800
Fu Heng. I'll ask this once.

120
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,410
Who is it?

121
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,950
I'm sorry.

122
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,430
Consort Chun was right.

123
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,440
I did add something...

124
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,500
in your cup of tea.

125
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,460
But it wasn't poison,

126
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,530
it was dishwater.

127
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,200
I wanted to punish you for
keeping secret from me.

128
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,800
I regret it so much because I should have
used the poison instead.

129
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,280
It's better than being lied to
and played like a fool.

130
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,720
Ying Luo, please listen to me.

131
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,320
Stop investigating.

132
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,660
Don't worry.

133
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,560
I don't need your help.

134
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,970
Soon enough,

135
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,590
I will find out who the murderer is.

136
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,160
Ying Luo.

137
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,860
Ying Luo!

138
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,450
Er Qing is gentle while Ming Yu is lively.

139
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,600
They both have served you for years
and never overstepped any lines.

140
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,800
But Wei Ying Luo is different from them.

141
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,380
She acts recklessly and is undisciplined.

142
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,440
But you like her the most. Why is that?

143
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,880
Is she somehow better than the loyal
servants who have served for years?

144
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,390
Is it fun? Is it fun?

145
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,950
His Majesty arrives.

146
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,640
Greetings to Your Majesty.

147
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,180
At ease.

148
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,360
I came to see Yong Cheng.

149
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,250
It's late,

150
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,180
why is he not in bed yet?

151
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,680
Yong Cheng wanted to play
with the puzzle ring.

152
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,650
Pardon me for breaking the rules.

153
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,080
Apology is not needed.

154
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,000
Come. Let me hold you.

155
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,070
Yong Cheng is fond of you.

156
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,250
So he's clingy to you.

157
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,580
It must be because you've
taken great care of him.

158
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,630
Yong Cheng is a good boy.

159
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:51,930
He's been looking forward
to Your Majesty's visit.

160
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,600
I know Your Majesty is
busy with state affairs.

161
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,730
Please do remember Yong Cheng misses you,
even if there are works at hands.

162
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,990
I see.

163
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,680
Is that right?

164
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,730
It's bed time.

165
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,570
But...

166
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,010
Did Your Majesty come here
to tell me something?

167
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,210
The Minister...

168
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,550
The Minister of Rites Jin Jian
thinks that since...

169
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,090
Yong Cheng lost his mother
as a young child,

170
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,020
he deserves all the sympathy.

171
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,210
Consort Jia has a younger sister
who is now of age,

172
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,880
he plans to send her to the palace
as Yong Cheng's babysitter.

173
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:55,280
Your Majesty, Her Highness has spent
much effort to take care of Fourth Prince.

174
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,010
-Your Majesty can't...
-Zhen, mind your manner.

175
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,390
I misspoke, please forgive me.

176
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,060
Yong Cheng is only two years old.

177
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,240
It's surely better to have his own aunt...

178
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,840
to take care of him rather
than a mere outsider.

179
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,280
It will surely put
the Jin family's mind at ease.

180
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,430
But, I have one request.

181
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,650
Say it.

182
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,720
I hope I am be allowed
to visit Yong Cheng often.

183
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,440
I agree.

184
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,510
[Chengqian Palace]

185
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,740
Your Highness, how could you let
His Majesty take Fourth Prince away?

186
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,120
After all, I am not his mother.

187
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,940
I am merely taking care of him.

188
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,280
His Majesty has never wanted me
to take his mother's place.

189
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,340
This is the Jin family's fault.

190
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,480
They just take what they want
without considering your feelings.

191
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,140
The Jin family has high hopes
for Fourth Prince.

192
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,280
They would never allow me to
become his mother.

193
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,730
If he stays in Chengqian Palace,

194
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,360
would he still remember his birth mother
and the merits of his maternal family?

195
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,160
So they're willing to send in
another daughter into the palace...

196
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,990
just to take Fourth Prince away.

197
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:20,190
Your Highness, why didn't you raise
any objection to His Majesty?

198
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,490
His Majesty appears to have not
cared as much about Fourth Prince,

199
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,720
but he actually cares a lot about the son.

200
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,440
Which is why he didn't let
the Prince stay in Chuxiu Palace,

201
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,440
he didn't want the son to become
Noble Consort Gao's tool for power gain.

202
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,480
He didn't send the Prince to
Changchun Palace...

203
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,740
because Her Majesty might give birth
to a son in the future,

204
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,810
Fourth Prince would then
be in an awkward situation.

205
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,130
His Majesty doesn't seem concerned
with Fourth Prince,

206
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,760
but not many understand his real concerns.

207
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,400
Blood is thicker than water.

208
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,480
His Majesty trusts the Jin family...

209
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,420
more than he trusts me.

210
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,360
Zhen, check the kitchen.

211
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,410
See if the milk tea for
Fourth Prince is ready.

212
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,940
Yes.

213
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,250
Don't be afraid.

214
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,970
Don't be afraid. Your mother is here.

215
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,750
It's just a nightmare.

216
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,520
It's going to be fine.
Don't be afraid.

217
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,370
Your mother is here.

218
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,580
Your Highness.

219
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,160
Your Highness. Your foot!

220
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,760
I must have kicked something by accident.

221
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,840
I'm fine.

222
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:07,310
I told you to calm down.

223
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,160
You always rush here
without your shoes on.

224
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,330
The shoes make a lot of noises.

225
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,520
What if they startle Yong Cheng?

226
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,650
It's just a minor injury. Don't worry.

227
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,440
Li Yu.

228
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,260
I am here.

229
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,440
Tomorrow morning, tell Consort Xian...

230
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,190
to take good care of Yong Cheng.

231
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,440
Pick some reliable servants
from the Imperial Household Department...

232
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,820
and send them here.

233
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,700
Your Majesty, you are not moving
Fourth Prince to another palace?

234
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,520
I misspoke, my apologies.

235
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,370
Hurry!

236
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,340
De Sheng.

237
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,230
Miss Ying Luo, where are you going?

238
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,480
I'm going to the Imperial Household
Department for errand.

239
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,089
Where are you going in such a rush?

240
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,640
His Majesty had a sudden interest to
hold a tea party in the Imperial Garden.

241
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,680
All the Princes are invited.

242
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,530
I'm rushing there to set it up.

243
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,490
All the Princes?

244
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,800
Only Princes with status and influences
are invited to the tea party.

245
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,930
I have to go.

246
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,880
Send my regards to Her Majesty.

247
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,130
Tell her I'll visit later.

248
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,730
I'll get going now.

249
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,000
Hurry! Hurry!

250
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,550
The Imperial Garden?

251
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,480
Uncle,

252
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:42,980
when will Prince Yi be released
from the Imperial Clan Court?

253
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,480
He never stops throwing tantrum,
saying he was framed.

254
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,480
His Majesty has made up his mind.

255
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,520
As long as Prince Yi admits his crime
and learns the error of his way,

256
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,980
he'll get released.

257
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,480
But I doubt he will ever get a position
in the Imperial Court.

258
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,560
I never thought my brother would
be so furious.

259
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,770
From what I see,

260
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,250
your brother Hong Zhou is the one
who deserves a hard lesson.

261
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,540
My fifth brother?

262
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,780
-What did he do?
-You probably don't know yet.

263
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,830
Hong Zhou had a coffin made...

264
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,880
and asked his wives, concubines,
and servants to weep for his passing.

265
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,880
As for him,

266
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,190
he was sitting cross-legged
in the main hall,

267
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,690
making fun of the people...

268
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,580
while they are crying.

269
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,840
Tell me, has he gone crazy?

270
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,680
Why would he want to jinx himself?

271
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,830
No one can live past 100 year-old.

272
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,240
So, what's there to be jinxed?

273
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,040
Brother Hong Zhou.

274
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,090
Brother, did you really have a coffin
made for yourself?

275
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:54,070
I was merely enjoying the honour
that comes after my death.

276
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,920
I wanted to see who would
shed the most tears...

277
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,620
and who is the most loyal to me.

278
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,360
This is absurd.

279
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,700
What did you say?

280
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,370
What did I say?

281
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,040
I said you were abusing your power
because His Majesty likes you,

282
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,670
you should be ashamed of it!

283
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,320
All of you...

284
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,640
agree with him?

285
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,590
Hong Zhou,

286
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:30,310
why did you beat up Ne Qin
when the last court meeting was dismissed?

287
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,280
I just found him irritating.

288
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,570
I beat him because I like it.

289
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,410
Ne Qin is a military executive
with the highest decoration!

290
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,800
You are a scoundrel to have beaten him
because it pleases you!

291
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,910
Tell me,

292
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,990
do you also want to get locked up
in the Imperial Clan Court?

293
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,310
Is everyone here?

294
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,960
Greetings to Your Majesty.

295
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,280
At ease.

296
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,020
Today is a family banquet.

297
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,380
All of you here are my kins.

298
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,050
Don't be so formal.

299
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,030
Are you in trouble again?

300
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,800
Of course not, Brother.

301
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,000
I've never forgotten your advice.

302
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,290
I am diligent and behaving very well.

303
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,090
Have a taste.

304
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,960
What is this?

305
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,760
Plum blossoms, pine nuts, and
fingered citrons with snow water,

306
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,760
and then add Longjing tea.
This is called Sanqing tea.

307
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,880
Plum blossoms, pine nuts, and
fingered citrons are all refined plants.

308
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,400
They give the tea a refined fragrance.

309
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,840
Good. So good.

310
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,680
The dried plum blossoms
have a pleasant aroma.

311
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,280
They must be extraordinary.

312
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,560
Prince Ping,

313
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,480
they are fresh plum blossoms...

314
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:52,120
picked from the nursery
during the first moon.

315
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,450
There were ice on them when
we took them out of the ice cellar.

316
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,280
As for the pine nuts,

317
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,480
they were picked from a hundred-year-old
pine tree in the Imperial Garden.

318
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,200
Of course, they are extraordinary.

319
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,930
Brother, I heard when fingered
citrons and pine nuts are mixed,

320
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,660
they might be poisonous.

321
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,600
Where did you hear such nonsense?

322
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,650
When I was in the coffin yesterday,

323
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,950
the Yama told me so!

324
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,500
Just be at ease and drink your tea.

325
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,620
Gulping down the tea would be
such a waste of fine tea from His Majesty.

326
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,220
Good tea should come with good poems.

327
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,240
I'll go first.

328
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,880
It is better to indulge in wine
and have fun in the changing world,

329
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,340
I drank a lot of my favourite
Tailang wine until I'm very drunk.

330
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,040
It's hard to find a soul-mate in life,

331
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,740
let us have drinks and chat merrily.

332
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,560
We are tasting tea.

333
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:11,890
Why are you talking about
having wine and merry chats?

334
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,500
Is the tea really poisonous?

335
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,970
Brother Hong Zhou!

336
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,240
Brother Hong Zhou, what's wrong with you?

337
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,360
Brother Hong Zhou!

338
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:33,240
Are pine nuts and fingered citrons
really poisonous when mixed together?

339
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,720
All of you, puke it out quickly!

340
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,030
Brother Hong Zhou, wake up!

341
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:39,400
Brother Hong Zhou! Brother Hong Zhou!

342
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,930
Brother Hong Zhou, wake up!

343
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,910
Wake up, Brother Hong Zhou!

344
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,450
Brother Hong Zhou!

345
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,880
Prince Lu, Prince Shen, Prince Ping,

346
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,600
what's going on with you three?

347
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,360
-Brother Hong Zhou!
-Bring us the Imperial Physician!

348
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,540
Brother Hong Zhou!

349
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,490
What's going on with you three?

350
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,650
Hong Zhou,

351
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,990
didn't you die from poisoning?

352
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,650
Sanqing tea tastes so delicious!

353
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,770
It had me lose my mind
and faint for a moment.

354
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:15,080
Your Majesty.

355
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,850
Hong Zhou, you are
making a fool out of us!

356
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,580
Your Majesty,
Hong Zhou is beyond insolent!

357
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,170
You must punish him.

358
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,700
I'm innocent.

359
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,480
I'm innocent.

360
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,140
I'm being falsely accused!

361
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,370
I clearly got too excited just now.

362
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,400
I passed out from the joy!

363
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,860
Look at them, they are accusing me!

364
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,070
You were clearly being paranoid.

365
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,520
As the saying goes,

366
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,360
keep calm even in face
of the great calamity.

367
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,920
That is what makes a true hero.

368
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,880
But look at you.
Do you behave like royalty?

369
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,170
All of you try to pull out your tongues.

370
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,000
but I was reckless and uncivil?

371
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,200
I think your behaviour is
unsightly and disgusting.

372
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,620
Hong Zhou!

373
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,490
Curse you!

374
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,440
So what? So what?

375
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,680
Sit down!

376
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,580
Hong Zhou,

377
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,490
go back to your seat.

378
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,830
Curse that brat, I wish I could just...

379
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,400
Please, don't.

380
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,590
He beat up Ne Qin in front of everyone,

381
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,710
His Majesty saw it and said nothing.

382
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,170
Today he made fun of us.

383
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,280
Did His Majesty ever lecture him?

384
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,210
Yes. His Majesty has
always been biased...

385
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:03,240
with his two brothers,
especially so for Hong Zhou.

386
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:04,760
After all, they are of similar age.

387
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,490
They grew up together,
they share a special bond.

388
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,960
Even if Hong Zhou burned
the Forbidden City to the ground,

389
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,480
His Majesty will still turn a blind eye.

390
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,120
We can't raffle his feathers.

391
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,320
Let's just keep our distance with him.

392
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,850
Well,

393
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,120
what evil idea are you up to now?

394
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,620
Do you wish to complain to His Majesty
about my actions?

395
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,820
There's a ghost over there!

396
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,960
I am bored of that trick.

397
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:42,870
-Is that supposed to scare me?
-Brother Hong Zhou.

398
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,260
It's true.

399
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,900
Ghost!

400
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,480
-Stay calm!
-Stop running!

401
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,320
Stay away from me!

402
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,160
Stay away from me!

403
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,830
Stay away from me!

404
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,960
Stay away from me!

405
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,620
Stay away from me!

406
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,980
Stay away from me! Help!

407
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,690
Help!

408
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,240
Help!

409
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,680
-Hong Zhou!
-Ghost! Help!

410
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,920
-Hong Zhou!
-There is a ghost!

411
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,410
Where?

412
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,890
There! Over there!

413
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,940
It's over there! Just over there.

414
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,800
What? Did you find anything?

415
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,210
Nothing yet.

416
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,440
It's here. The ghost must be here.

417
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,020
Just now. Just now...

418
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,200
there was a ghost of a handmaiden
with her hair loose in the wind!

419
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,530
I saw it with my own eyes.

420
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,230
It's her. It must be her.

421
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,300
Of course she is here.

422
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,120
Come out. Come out!

423
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,370
Come out. Come out!

424
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,500
Fifth Prince,

425
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,400
who are you talking about?

426
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,770
Do you know that ghost?

427
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,280
Hong Zhou, I've already checked the place.

428
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,880
This is just a wall. There's nothing else.

429
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,210
Fifth Prince, you must have seen it wrong.

430
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,780
I wasn't the only one here.

431
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,010
So many others saw it!

432
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:36,760
The palace is haunted. It's haunted!
Don't you understand?

433
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,070
Hong Zhou.

434
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,120
Enough of your nonsense.

435
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,200
There are no ghosts in the Forbidden City.

436
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,000
The only ghost here is the one
living on your guilt!

437
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,060
You don't believe me?
You don't believe me?

438
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,280
Go ask the others
if you don't believe me!

439
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,770
Fu Heng,

440
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:03,950
He didn't seem to be lying.

441
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,560
It's like he was telling the truth.

442
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,690
You also saw the expressions
on the other royal members.

443
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,480
It's not like they would help
Fifth Prince lie to us.

444
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,710
Enough.

445
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,510
What's wrong, Fu Heng?

446
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,770
Go on without me,
I have matters to see to.

447
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,300
Fu Heng!

448
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,160
Fu Heng, where are you going?

449
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,670
You do take good care of Prince He.

450
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,360
Anytime Prince He feels a bit upset,

451
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,410
you are the one who suffers more.

452
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,340
When my late father was alive,

453
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,550
he loved my brother Fu Hui the most.

454
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,570
Unfortunately, he passed away as a child.

455
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,240
My other brothers suffered the same fate.

456
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,550
Among ten sons,

457
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,040
only I, Hong Zhou, and Hong Yan
made it to this day.

458
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:05,540
Because of fierce struggle among
the nine princes for the throne,

459
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,620
Emperor Shengzu died of grief.

460
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,040
My father didn't want to
make the same mistake,

461
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:17,140
he decided to select
the crown prince in secrecy.

462
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:21,330
But from the start,

463
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,240
the sickly Hong Zhou...

464
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,420
was disqualified.

465
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,880
Your Majesty, ever since
you inherited the throne,

466
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,680
you've been taking good care of Prince He.

467
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,370
You even ordered the imperial physician to
tend to his health.

468
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,140
Prince He has rarely
been sick these past years.

469
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,110
Li Yu,

470
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,660
I've always suspected,

471
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,810
Hong Zhou was never sick.

472
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,150
Your Majesty.

473
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,480
Your Majesty, what are you saying?

474
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,730
The whole palace knows...

475
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,720
Fifth Prince has been in
poor health since childhood.

476
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,320
That was why he never amount
to greatness in any field.

477
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,680
I suspect...

478
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:11,090
he had known Emperor Shengzu and
my father had chosen me.

479
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,930
He backed out from the power struggle.

480
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,400
Fifth Prince?

481
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,840
With Fifth Prince's absurd personality,

482
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,890
even if he wants to pretend,
he wouldn't be able to.

483
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,910
Your Majesty,

484
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,140
I've misspoken, my apologies.

485
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,510
Get out of here.

486
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,890
Yes.

487
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,020
Where did you go?

488
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,800
I just...

489
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,230
felt a bit too warm,

490
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,960
I came out for some fresh air.

491
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,320
Fu Heng!

492
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,330
You...

493
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,050
Was it you who disguised as a ghost?

494
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,520
What did you say?

495
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,640
I don't understand what you're saying.

496
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,450
I found a sticky substance
on the palace wall.

497
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,610
The royalty said they ran into a ghost.

498
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,520
It's obvious enough...

499
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,200
someone put up
a reflective object on the wall,

500
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,660
and it showed the projection
of a fake ghost.

501
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,480
There was a storm tonight,
there wasn't much light.

502
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,640
People couldn't see it clearly,

503
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,650
so they thought that it was a ghost.

504
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,010
Reflective object?

505
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,880
Do you mean bronze mirror?

506
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,460
How can the mirror
be stuck on the palace wall?

507
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,800
Guard Fuca,

508
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,770
your imagination is
beyond the wildest dream.

509
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,130
It was not a bronze mirror,
but a piece of glass.

510
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,640
I just came from
the Imperial Household Department.

511
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,000
They told me you took the glass.
Am I right?

512
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,350
You got it all wrong.

513
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:32,480
I took the glass because of Her Majesty.

514
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:35,490
The glass on the lantern
in her palace was damaged.

515
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,520
Why would I pose as a ghost
just to scare people off?

516
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,920
Don't be such a paranoid.

517
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,120
You should return to Qianqing Gate.

518
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,480
You don't want people talking
behind your back.

519
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,080
Do not mess with Hong Zhou.

520
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:51,360
You must understand, he is
the closest kin of His Majesty.

521
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,400
As long as he wasn't
trying to usurp the throne,

522
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,520
His Majesty will forgive him
for whatever he has done.

523
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,220
Impossible.

524
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,810
There must be something wrong.

525
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,620
You almost gave me a heart attack.

526
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,500
Why were you sneaking up to me?

527
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,940
You think I haven't been scared enough?

528
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,340
What are you doing?

529
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:39,240
Last night, I thought a ghost
was haunting me.

530
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,280
But I pondered on it.

531
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,290
Something must be at miss.

532
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,250
Someone must be behind this trick.

533
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,680
Someone was trying to
dig up some dirt on me.

534
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,770
Once I find the evidence,

535
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,820
I will skin them alive.

536
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,360
You mean what happened on
the tenth night of the first month?

537
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,450
What?

538
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,800
That night, I was supposed to be on duty.

539
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,660
But my mother was sick.

540
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:09,760
I had someone cover my shift for me.

541
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,400
My clothes and court belt were
left in the Guards' Office.

542
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,030
Because I left in a hurry,

543
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,330
I even left my jade pendent behind.

544
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,739
That night, you went
to the Guards' Office.

545
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,130
You changed into my uniform, am I right?

546
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,020
-Fu Heng.
-Enough.

547
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,820
-I was...
-Say nothing, I want nothing from you.

548
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,590
Do you want to know...

549
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:32,889
who played the trick on you?

550
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,239
Of course.

551
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,620
I can tell you.

552
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:36,830
Who?

553
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,800
Have those people in Changchun Palace
not made a move?

554
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,150
Your Highness,

555
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,710
Wei Ying Luo seemed to have
seen through that eunuch.

556
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,880
So she hasn't taken any action.

557
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,580
You're admitting defeat now?

558
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,280
Your Highness, rest assured.

559
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,930
Wei Ying Luo hasn't made
Her Majesty her enemy,

560
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,400
but even if Fu Heng wasn't
the real murderer,

561
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,860
he was surely connected
to the girl's death.

562
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,720
Judging by Wei Ying Luo's temper,

563
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,030
she will never have full loyalty
to Her Majesty.

564
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,370
You mean to say...

565
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,340
your plan to alienate the two has worked?

566
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,280
It's fine even if it didn't work.

567
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,120
Your Highness, Wei Ying Luo
is just a handmaiden,

568
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,880
She became the trusted servant
of Her Majesty in just half a year,

569
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,770
and her bravery while tending to
His Majesty has earned much trust.

570
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,300
Many people admire and envy her.

571
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:36,650
The higher she goes,
the harder she'll fall.

572
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:41,420
Your Highness, it won't be long before
she becomes loathed by everyone.

573
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:45,690
[Changchun Palace]

574
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,730
So, you're the one behind all this.

575
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,950
-You are…
-Enough.

576
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,970
Last night, she almost scared me to death.

577
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,600
I haven't done anything to her
and you're already defending her.

578
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,090
Hong Zhou, don't forget your promise.

579
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,660
Okay. I remember.

580
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,250
You want this resolved
without any violence.

581
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,440
Don't worry.
I won't make it difficult for her.

582
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,090
But her sister...

583
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,170
What is the meaning of this?

584
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,440
I'm apologizing to you.

585
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,690
With gold?

586
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,930
Ying Luo,

587
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,370
Hong Zhou was just too drunk.

588
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:53,150
His mind wasn't clear
when he made the mistake.

589
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,470
Hong Zhou.

590
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,220
Fine.

591
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,260
I…

592
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,860
apologize.

593
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,810
I'm sorry. I was too drunk...

594
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,500
and hurt your sister.

595
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,920
But I do regret my action.

596
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,980
I even went back to search for her.

597
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,600
I sneaked into the Imperial Garden to
avoid the guards on patrol.

598
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,320
I changed into Fu Heng's uniform.

599
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,000
Since I had no reason to be there,

600
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,050
I couldn't just walk in there.

601
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,380
When I arrived, she had already
left the palace.

602
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,800
Hong Zhou,

603
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,450
but after that night,

604
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,810
Miss Man lost her life.

605
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,290
I swear to heaven that was not my doing.

606
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,520
It's true.

607
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,830
I am always direct and outspoken.

608
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,090
If I really wanted to kill her,

609
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:45,970
I could have just given the order.

610
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,840
I wouldn't have to use suicide
to cover up her death.

611
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,970
Ying Luo,

612
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,120
Hong Zhou's action was wrong.

613
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
But he wouldn't have killed anyone.

614
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,470
I can vouch for the him,
he didn't kill your sister.

615
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,860
And yet he violated her.

616
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,160
He might as well have killed her.

617
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:08,910
Do you realize that
even after my sister died,

618
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,730
she couldn't be buried
as one of my family.

619
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:14,290
She could only be buried in a mass grave.

620
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:16,050
I can make up for it.

621
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,720
That was a life lost.

622
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,260
How do you make up for that?

623
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,690
Miss Wei,

624
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:29,000
I can take your sister in as my concubine,

625
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,380
I can restore her name.

626
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,200
Is that okay?

627
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,830
What did you say?

628
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,560
As your concubine?

629
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,210
Yes, I can make her my concubine.

630
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,200
My wife must be documented.

631
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,460
The Wei family is not qualified for that.

632
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,040
But she can be my concubine.

633
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,290
In this way,

634
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,780
no one would condemn her for
losing virginity out of wedlock...

635
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,440
or suspect her of ill conduct.

636
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,760
-Ying Luo.
-Where are you going?

637
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,920
Father?

638
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,930
I, Wei Qing Tai,

639
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,790
greet Your Majesty and Prince He.

640
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,820
-Why are you here?
-I was told your father...

641
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,290
never got any good position in the palace.

642
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,800
I wrote a recommendation letter for him.

643
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,970
Today,

644
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,920
he will serve as an internal manager
in the Imperial Household Department.

645
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,920
As long as he does his job,
he will surely get promoted.

646
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,290
You agreed to it?

647
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,910
He's about to take office.

648
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,670
Father,

649
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,370
you used the life of your daughter...

650
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,080
in exchange for a job?

651
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,810
I bet it makes you happy.

652
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,010
Ying Luo, you are as stubborn as always.

653
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:11,290
Do you really wish for your sister
to have no peace in the afterlife?

654
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,280
Ying Ning died a horrible death.

655
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,540
Her name ended up being tarnished.

656
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:19,950
She can never be buried
as one of the Wei family!

657
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,300
Our family...

658
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,160
will forever live in shame.

659
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,230
But now Prince He has agreed...

660
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,850
to make your sister his concubine.

661
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,330
In this way,

662
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,380
no one in the whole Wei clan...

663
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,760
would dare to speak ill of us!

664
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,110
Your sister's soul...

665
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,160
can finally find peace.

666
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,970
Miss Wei,

667
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,970
you have my word.

668
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:52,170
Your sister's grave will be on
a land with great Feng-shui...

669
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,610
so she can rest in peace.

670
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,610
She will not be left alone
as a wandering soul.

671
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,560
Take this as my sincere apology.

672
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,710
-Ying Luo.
-Ying Luo, if you stop now,

673
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,410
I'll forgive you
for your previous rash actions.

674
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,410
We will make peace with each other.

675
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,640
But if you insist to go on
the path of revenge,

676
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,080
you leave me with no choice
but to banish you.

677
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,540
I don't want you to cause me
any more trouble.

678
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,650
Consider his offer carefully.

679
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,480
Which is more important?
Your thirst for revenge,

680
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,400
or your sister's peace?

681
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:34,580
Or our bond as a family?

682
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,650
Your Majesty,

683
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,130
you've always taught me...

684
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,940
to always be forgiving.

685
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,220
Please tell me, Your Majesty,

686
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,120
this time,

687
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,990
should I really...

688
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,110
forgive him?

689
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,380
Ying Luo,

690
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:08,400
I can't decide for you...

691
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,600
whether you should forgive.

692
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,600
I understand.

693
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,050
For my sister's soul...

694
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,040
to have peace,

695
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,680
Prince He,

696
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,450
I dare not hold any grudge against you.

697
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,330
But...

698
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,680
you must keep your promise.

699
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,410
Don't ever forget it.

700
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,780
That's more like it.

701
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,960
It's always better to make peace
rather than enemies.

702
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:53,690
From now on, the Wei family
is considered an in-law of mine.

703
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,280
As for the promotion of Master Wei,

704
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,960
and your marriage after
your servitude here ends,

705
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,480
I will take care of those for you.

706
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,740
In that case,
you have my thanks, Prince He.

707
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,120
See? What did I say?

708
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,970
No grudge lasts forever.

709
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,120
As long as you're willing to invest...

710
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,130
No,

711
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,970
as long as you are
willing to ask for forgiveness,

712
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,840
everything can be resolved.
