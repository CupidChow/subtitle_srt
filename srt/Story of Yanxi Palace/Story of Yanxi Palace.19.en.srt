3
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,700
Your Majesty, stay here tonight.

4
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,289
Will you?

5
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,570
Your Majesty.

6
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,310
Very well.

7
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,700
His Majesty said he would come.

8
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,600
But His Majesty is nowhere
to be seen even now.

9
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,480
-Your Highness.
-Let's wait for a while.

10
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,430
Your Highness, it's windy at night.

11
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,680
Your health isn't well,
you might catch a cold.

12
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,530
Why not wait inside the hall?

13
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:48,560
I want to be the first
to welcome His Majesty.

14
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,640
Look. Is that His Majesty coming?

15
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,850
It's Eunuch Li.

16
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,200
Greetings to Your Majesty.

17
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,670
Get up.

18
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,630
Thank you, Your Majesty.

19
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,440
His Majesty won't be coming tonight.

20
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:18,660
Your Majesty may return
and rest for the night.

21
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,040
Is something keeping His Majesty busy?

22
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,010
Something urgent to manage?
I shall wait for him.

23
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,840
Well, Your Majesty,

24
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:32,030
His Majesty moved his stay
to Chuxiu Palace.

25
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,320
Er Qing. The wind here is too cold.

26
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,880
Escort Her Majesty back inside.

27
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,079
Your Majesty. Your health is a priority.

28
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,190
All right.

29
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,300
May you have a good night's rest,
Your Majesty.

30
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,680
It wasn't my doing.

31
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,020
I don't deserve all the hate.

32
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,880
Outrageous.

33
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,910
Outrageous.

34
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,960
The plant did nothing.
How did it upset you?

35
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,360
You! Don't you talk to me.

36
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,409
The sight of any man angers me!

37
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,760
I don't think I've offended you.

38
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,880
Indeed, you did no such thing.

39
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,650
But His Majesty has upset Her Majesty.

40
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,420
What are you talking about?
I don't understand.

41
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,110
Concubine Yu and Fifth Prince
risked their lives...

42
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,010
to bring Noble Consort Gao down.

43
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,810
It's only been days and she is
back on her feet again.

44
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:04,250
Sure. Her glamour stands out
among the six palaces.

45
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,440
His Majesty almost forgot the fact that
Fifth Prince was almost buried alive.

46
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,210
That's understandable.

47
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:13,990
Since it's understandable,
why are you clenching your teeth?

48
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,130
You.

49
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,670
Are you here to pick a fight on me?

50
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,770
Don't you know?

51
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,700
Her Majesty waited for two hours.

52
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,570
And then only to find out
His Majesty has gone to Chuxiu Palace.

53
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:31,500
Your Empress's brother. Shouldn't you
stand up for the unjust she got?

54
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,590
Ying Luo, in your heart,
is His Majesty a debauched man?

55
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,210
-I don't know.
-But you do think so.

56
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,720
But Ying Luo, I must tell you.

57
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,659
As the ruler of a nation, there are
many hard choices he has to make.

58
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:48,890
Such as ignoring Concubine Yu
and Empress's heartbreak,

59
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,800
just to pamper that
tyrant Noble Consort Gao?

60
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,540
Did you frame Noble Consort with
that letter written in blood?

61
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,380
Of course not.

62
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm glad it wasn't you.
The matter was carried out in a haste.

63
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,660
It seemed overly intentional.

64
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,860
His Majesty was clever enough
to know someone framed her.

65
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,290
Noble Consort Gao is insolent in conduct.

66
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,190
She needed to learn her lesson.

67
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,880
However, Gao Bin installed river outlets
and dams to cope with flooding.

68
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,190
His work to bring peace and
wellness are insurmountable.

69
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:22,120
Even if it's on his account only...

70
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,010
His Majesty must be lenient
with Noble Consort Gao.

71
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,250
Do you understand?

72
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,490
Do you understand or not?

73
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,060
I won't talk about that any more.

74
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,380
How was the investigation going on?

75
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,280
There was no imperial relative who left
the banquet at Qianqing Palace that night.

76
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,409
That's impossible.

77
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:48,110
I have asked the head eunuch on duty
at Qianqing Palace that night,

78
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,770
I am certain of it.

79
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,970
You are not lying?

80
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,330
Fine. I trust you.

81
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,980
Since we can't get any lead
from Qianqing Palace's eunuch,

82
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,760
I'll make my move on
His Majesty's close aids.

83

[Memorial to the Throne]

84
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,940
Your Majesty, it's getting late.
You should rest.

85
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,650
I need more ink.

86
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,170
Your Majesty.

87
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,120
Your Majesty, what's wrong?

88
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,400
I'll get the imperial physician.

89
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,640
Calm down, I'm fine.

90
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,400
Your Majesty.

91
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,900
Your Majesty! These are rashes!

92

[Yangxin Hall]

93
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,450
Furunculosis?

94
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,110
Furunculosis are rare
in the Forbidden City.

95
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:07,170
Has His Majesty been
in contact with outsiders?

96
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,440
Your Majesty, His Majesty has been
visited by many subjects from outside.

97
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:19,200
Maybe a subject from outside was ill
and carried this illness here.

98
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,420
Is this a serious illness?

99
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,650
This illness causes severe itch
that is unbearable.

100
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,700
The allergic reaction seems
to have led to hives.

101
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,450
His Majesty might scratch himself
and get hurt from the severe itch.

102
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:37,850
It can lead to an infection
that will be difficult to control.

103
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:40,880
Then, how do you treat this illness?

104
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,240
Externally, we need to apply
sulphur ointment all over his body.

105
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,130
Internally, we use
anti-inflammatory medicine.

106
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:52,530
His Majesty rest and recover
for the next 100 days.

107
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,650
These illnesses are very contagious.

108
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,280
You must not stay in the room too long.

109
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,150
I'll stay and look after His Majesty.

110
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,240
Your Majesty, your own health
isn't all that well.

111
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,050
You can't stay. What if...

112
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,940
I've made up my mind. Say no more.

113
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,820
Your Majesty, should we
alert Empress Dowager?

114
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,840
Empress Dowager is praying
at Changchun Garden.

115
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,570
Don't tell Empress Dowager for now,
I don't to worry her.

116
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,470
-Sure.
-Examiner Zhang,

117
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,360
is there a way to ease
His Majesty's pain?

118
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,420
This...

119

Ying Luo.

120
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,850
You'll be moving to Yangxin Hall
with Her Majesty today.

121

Ming Yu.

122
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,950
Her Majesty ordered me to
stay at Changchun Palace.

123
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,660
You should start packing
and move to Yangxin Hall.

124
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,520
You can't make Ying Luo do your own job.

125

[Since we can't get any lead

[I'll make my move on
His Majesty's close aids.]

127
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,540
Sure.

128
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:17,110
Ying Luo. Furunculosis is contagious.

129
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,240
Once you contracted it,
the itching will be intense,

130
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,960
Scratching will leave scars.

131
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,880
If Her Majesty Ming Yu can go,
then so can I.

132
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,680
Er Qing, I'll go pack up now.

133
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,030
Ying Luo. Ying Luo!

134
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,280
Are you satisfied now?

135
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,560
She volunteered.
It's not like I forced her.

136
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:45,350
Ming Yu. You always said Her Majesty
didn't care about you and ignores you.

137
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,250
But have you ever reflected
on your own actions?

138
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,840
When Her Majesty wasn't
in the Forbidden City,

139
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,440
you used Concubine Yu and Fifth Prince
to take on the blame for you.

140
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,570
Now Her Majesty needs you
and wanted you at Yangxin Hall,

141
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,020
you turned it down with
all kinds of excuses.

142
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,920
Her Majesty is wise and intelligent.

143
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,980
Of course she sees right through you.

144
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,760
Not just Her Majesty, all the people
in Changchun Palace too.

145
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,480
No one would trust you
with anything from now on.

146
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,220
-I...
-You,

147
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:11,870
you are wasting away...

148

Her Majesty's trust for you
with your own two hands.

149
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:17,220
How can others ever trust you again?

150
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,410
Greetings, Your Majesty.

151
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,230

153
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,980
Your Majesty, the consorts insisted
to visit His Majesty inside.

154
00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:01,530
Your Majesty, I was so worried.
So I came here this morning.

155
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,770
But this servant Li Yu
refused to let me in.

156
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,190
His Majesty is infected with furunculosis
and it's very contagious.

157
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:12,310
His Majesty has ordered for
all the other consorts to not visit him.

158
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,190
Everyone, you may leave now.

00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:32,160
Your Majesty, furunculosis is contagious,
why must you risk your life?

162
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,590
If His Majesty really needs caring,
I'll go to Yangxin Palace instead.

163
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,010
Consort Chun is right.

164
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,400
Tending to His Majesty when he's sick
is our duty as his consorts.

165
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,480
We can't let the Empress work
while we do nothing.

166
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,090
They are both right.

167
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,840
If word got out, people will think
we are slacking,

168
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,050
that we neglected our duty as consorts.

169
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:03,180
I'm moving into Yangxin Palace
because I had furunculosis before.

170
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,600
I know how to tend to His Majesty.

171
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,540
Everyone, don't worry.

172
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,010
No one will blame you for this.

173
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,370
Your Majesty once
contracted such illness before?

174
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,430
I'm not worried then.

175
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:21,730
Right.

176
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:25,090
In that case, Noble Consort
shouldn't be worried...

177
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,920
for the Empress and can put
your mind at ease.

178
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,800
Consort Chun, caring too much
will cloud your judgment.

179
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,520
Even if you said one or two harsh words,

180
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,640
I am generous enough to look past it.
I won't bear any grudge.

181
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:48,660
Your Majesty, I'll take my leave then.

182
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,340
After being grounded for half a month,
Noble Consort has improved a lot.

183
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,960
Your Majesty, you're
not at risk for infection,

184
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,580
but you must take care of your health.

185
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,580
If it's too much for you to handle,
feel free to ask for my help at anytime.

186
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,070
Her Majesty has made herself clear,
any further arguing is pointless.

187
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:21,560
Go back and rest.

188
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,720
It seems like the rumours are
not without a cause.

189
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,510
Judging by your persistence, even I think
you are especially nice to Empress.

190
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,620
So you are making fun of me too?

191
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,090
Okay. Before putting on
the medicinal cream,

192
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:46,550
he needs to clean his body with alum tea.

193
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,720
Yes.

194
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,290
Get out.

195
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,490
I want you out of here now.

196
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,360
Eunuch Li, why don't you do it instead?

197
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:47,730
Me?

198
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,990
You are too clumsy!
Ask someone else to do it.

199
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,200
Yes.

200
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,600
Your Majesty, half the servants of
Yangxin Palace has been transferred.

201
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,710
The ones remaining are mostly eunuchs.

202
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,040
Her Majesty was worried
they would be clumsy...

203
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,560
and hurt you, so she ordered me
to tend to you.

204
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,860
Even if someone else is to tend to you,

205
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,260
they won't be much better than Eunuch Li.

206
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,200
Are you saying you are not clumsy at all?

207
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,990
I was an embroidery maid before.

208
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,720
The fabrics were high grade silk.
To prevent damaging the fabric,

209
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,160
I've developed the habit of taking
great care of my hands.

210
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,000
If Your Majesty won't
let Chief Li or me do it,

211
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:04,450
Her Majesty will personally come to
put on the medication on you.

212
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:08,069
Ying Luo, what's happening?

213
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:14,000
Your Majesty, nothing!

214
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,310
Fine. Carry on with it.

215
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,920
Yes.

216
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,870
What are you doing?

217
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,360
Your Majesty,
Physician Zhang instructed...

218
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,080
that the clothes and
blankets you've used...

219
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,040
must be soaked in disinfectants.

220
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,570
I'll get it done right away.

221
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,750
Stop scratching.

222
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,910
Stop rubbing. You mustn't do that.

223
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,010
Before, I heard from
the Empress Dowager...

224
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:42,960
Your Majesty acts like a child
when you get sick.

225
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,930
It seems like she was right.

226
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:58,730
Your Majesty, if you really
hate Ying Luo so much,

227
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,400
let me apply the medicine
for you next time.

228
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,740
No need.

229
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,640
I really don't understand...

230
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,890
why Your Majesty will hate her so much...

231
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,180
when she is so capable and thoughtful?

232
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,860
[It's all my fault!]

233
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,710
Your Majesty.

234
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,060
It's almost daybreak.

235
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,780
You should get some rest.

236
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,470
His Majesty's body is too warm and dried.

237
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,100
The itching is unbearable.

238
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,260
I'll keep him company for a while.

239
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,700
De Sheng, hurry up.

240
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,770
You need to pick up the pace.

241
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,890
Miss Ying Luo, you've worked hard
these past few days.

242
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,560
I'm just assisting Her Majesty.

243
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:37,980
Chief Li has been working day and night,
that is truly some hard work.

244
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,320
Miss Ying Luo, I bet you are here
to ask something of me.

245
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,600
Nothing can hide from
your sharp senses.

246
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,400
I do have something to ask.

247
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,300
De Sheng, the flame is too slow,
the problem must be the coals,

248
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,000
get some new coals for it.

249
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,620
Yes.

250
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:08,000
Eunuch Li, on the 10th of January,
during the banquet for in Qianqing Palace,

251
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,800
were you present there?

252
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,800
Of course!

253
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:16,040
I picked up a jade pendant
here in the palace.

254
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,760
It looks rather exquisite.

255
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,260
Madam said it could likely belonged
to a member of royalty.

256
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,800
I am here to ask around.

257
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,420
Even if this belonged to a royalty,
they could only be at Qianqing Palace.

258
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,320
They couldn't be wandering around
in the inner palace.

259
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,830
That's what I thought.

260
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,520
But, Eunuch Li,

261
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,640
what if someone from
the royal family got drunk...

262
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,080
took a wrong turn, and walked right into
the forbidden ground,

263
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,490
lost a valuable,

264
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,730
and the he wouldn't dare to look for it?

265
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,670
That is entirely possible.

266
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,480
But that day, nobody left the banquet.

267
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,030
-Really?
-Of course it's true.

268
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:59,660
His Majesty was toasting to each of them.
Who would dare to leave?

269
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,520
So that's what happened.

270
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,440
Miss Ying Luo, do you have the pendant
with you right now?

271
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,130
May I have a look?

272
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,900
I left it in Changchun Palace.

273
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,840
But there was a symbol on it.

274
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,490
What symbol?

275
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,820
Like this.

276
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,800
Fuca!

277
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:26,630
Miss Ying Luo, that pendant either
belonged to Her Majesty or her brother.

278
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:36,760
After all the hustle,
I just embarrassed myself.

279
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,200
Okay! Thank you, Chief Li!

280
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:44,040
Once I am back to Changchun Palace,
I surely will return it.

281
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:47,200
-De Sheng. What's taking so long?
-[So it wasn't from the royal family?]

282
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,480
[Curse it, who was it then?]

283
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,810
Water.

284
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,160
Go. Leave it to me.

285
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,760
It's boiling hot, how can anyone
even drink this?

286
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,590
This tea was tested.

287
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,160
Is that supposed to be an excuse?

288
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:32,110
This is my mistake, please spare me.
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

289
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,070
Where is Wei Ying Luo? Where did she go?

290
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,740
Your Majesty,

291
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,440
Wei Ying Luo was
in the courtyard just now.

292
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,060
But I don't know where she is now.

293
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,800
Get lost.

294
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,600
-All of you, get lost.
-Your Majesty, please calm down.

295
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:02,710
Miss Ying Luo, His Majesty lost his temper
because he couldn't find you. Go in now.

296
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,250
Your Majesty, may I have your order?

297
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,170
Where is the Empress?

298
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,990
Her Majesty was keeping watch
the entire night.

299
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,770
I just persuaded her to go back to rest.

300
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,390
So where were you?

301
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:42,070
Your Majesty, there are others
to tend to you in this house.

302
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:44,340
This itch is driving me insane.

303
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:48,900
And you expect these clumsy servants
to scratch my back for me?

304
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,660
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

305
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,190
I have a solution.

306
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,360
Physician Zhang said if one uses
too much sulphur ointment,

307
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,450
the skin will be dry.

308
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,390
I just picked some fresh aloe Vera.

309
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,890
Your Majesty.

310
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,360
Apply the aloe Vera juice.

311
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,040
It won't cure you of the illness,

312
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,850
but at lease it will ease the itching.

313
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,500
Is this how you earned
the trust of my Empress?

314
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:50,170
Is this why she favours you so much?

315
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,770
Her Majesty treats me with sincerity.

316
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,560
It's only normal that
I repay her kindness.

317
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,920
I was demeaning to you.

318
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,560
I bet you hate me to your bones.

319
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,490
[Of course.]

320
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,980
[I wouldn't dare.]

321
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:13,090
Your Majesty, I have something to say...

322
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,990
I fear it might sound offensive.

323
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,980
I hate it when people say that to me.

324
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,730
Will you not tell me
if I find it offensive?

325
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,910
Your Majesty.

326
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:33,400
Her Majesty had been fanning
for you the whole night.

327
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,460
When I told her to go back and rest,

328
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,370
she refused.

329
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,940
She couldn't move her wrists this morning.

330
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,480
I know,

331
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,440
the Forbidden City is short on
beautiful and charming ladies.

332
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,920
But only Her Majesty
stayed to attend to you...

333
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:58,020
even though she clearly knew
she would be infected.

334
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,130
Er Qing told me that,

335
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,290
Her Majesty never
suffered from furunculosis.

336
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:09,450
But she lied just to get the chance
to stay here.

337
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,540
Such love...

338
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,760
is something so rare and unique.

339
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,610
Have you said enough?

340
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,480
Get lost.

341
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,680
It's my personal matter.

342
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:31,500
Since when do I need you advice of it?

343
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:33,040
Get lost.

344
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,360
Your Majesty.

345
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,170
You should deliver tea to His Majesty.

346
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:11,780
What?

347
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,460
Show him how sore your hands are.

348
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:20,690
That is the only way His Majesty
will learn to appreciate your effort.

349
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,300
Or else, he would still think it's easy
to tend to a patient.

350
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,910
When you are nice to someone,

351
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,320
do you really have to let them know?

352
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,430
Of course.

353
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,490
If I contribute a portion,
he will have to show me double the effort.

354
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:40,330
If I made up half of the effort,
he will have to show me all he has.

355
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:42,890
It's only fair.

356
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,500
If you keep giving,

357
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,670
no one will cherish it.

358
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:57,100
Ying Luo, in the Forbidden City,

359
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,440
he has countless consorts and concubines,

360
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,450
but only me is his legitimate wife.

361
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:09,350
What others are not willing to do,
I will do it.

362
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:14,160
Everything I did for him
was never meant to be repaid.

363
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:20,740
I only wish His Majesty
to be safe and healthy.

364
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:40,190
Physician Ye.

365
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,500
What brings you here?

366
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,520
Miss Ying Luo.

367
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,050
Fifth Prince's jaundice has subsided.

368
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:49,490
But, of course.

369
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:52,270
You instructed him to
keep basking in the sun.

370
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,120
Not only has his jaundice subsided,
he's now chubby and cute.

371
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,690
That's good then.

372
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,810
Physician Ye, are you here
to treat His Majesty?

373
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:05,690
Yes. His Majesty's furunculosis
has lasted for more than a month.

374
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:09,850
It's taking too long to heal.
I went to check his medical record.

375
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,480
I have some new ideas.

376
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,600
Physician Ye, are you saying...

377
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,800
His Majesty's furunculosis
might not came from infections.

378
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:19,140
But...

379
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,420
Miss Ying Luo, come here.

380
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,810
Wei Ying Luo, come here now!

381
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,120
Your Majesty, you must not scratch it.

382
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,800
Your Majesty, stop scratching.

383
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,050
If you keep scratching,
the scar tissue will tear up.

384
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,400
Your Majesty.

385
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,920
This itch is killing me.

386
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,950
-Ying Luo, bring the aloe Vera paste here.
-The itch is all over me.

387
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,250
Stop scratching.

388
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,960
Your Majesty, aloe Vera ointment
can't cure this illness

389
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,450
Physician Zhang said His Majesty must
stay calm to recover.

390
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,280
Tell him to come and try it!

391
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,470
Your Majesty.

392
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,030
Your Majesty.

393
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,210
Your Majesty, letting off you anger on
the Empress is not right for a ruler!

394
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,060
What did you say?

395
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,760
The consorts and concubines
know you are sick,

396
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:20,300
and never stopped talking
about their concerns.

397
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:23,640
They couldn't wait to avoid you
when the knew of your illness.

398
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:27,120
Only Her Majesty has been here taking
great care of you day and night.

399
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,650
But you chose not to see her effort
and let out your frustration on her.

400
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:32,090
Isn't this too much?

401
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,390
Empress.

402
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,520
Keep your slave on leash!

403
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,810
Ying Luo, are you crazy?

404
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,490
How dare you be so rude to His Majesty!
Kneel down!

405
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:48,630
I am right! Ever since
Noble Consort Gao was reinstated,

406
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,480
His Majesty's rewards have been
flooding into Chuxiu Palace.

407
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,640
What about Changchun Palace?
We get nothing at all. Why is this so?

408
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,760
Shut up!

409
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,040
Say it!

410
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,820
I want you to say it!

411
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:16,540
Everyone has been curious about
the reinstatement of Noble Consort Gao.

412
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:20,730
Perhaps it was as a token of good faith
to Governor Gao Bin of Zhili.

413
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,130
You really know a lot.

414
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:39,290
You know everything about
the matters in the Imperial Court.

415
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,710
Wei Ying Luo.

416
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,160
Since His Majesty wants to listen,
I will say it.

417
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:05,810
Your Majesty, Chief Li.

418
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:09,420
Because of the feat
of an imperial officer,

419
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,010
His Majesty poured in his affection
for one of his consorts.

420
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,929
As the ruler of the nation,

421
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,179
he seems too careful in
humouring a woman.

422
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:24,870
How is this different from a prostitute
trying to entertain a man?

423
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:31,750
If the Forbidden City were a brothel
for pleasure and debauchery,

424
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,570
Your Majesty has become
the most popular woman around.

425
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,270
His Majesty has just
placated Chuxiu Palace.

426
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:42,940
What will be next?

427
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,270
Yonghe Palace?

428
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,280
Chengqian Palace?

429
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,690
Embroidery workshop?

430
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,120
-It's the Embroidery workshop.
-Your Majesty.

431
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,390
Move aside!

432
00:34:57,490 --> 00:34:59,680
Your Majesty only seeks
the company of woman!

433
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,000
Move aside!

434
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,600
Your Majesty, you don't
appreciate the Empress.

435
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,680
Your Majesty, please cool down.

436
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,560
-Your Majesty! Calm down.
-He is furious because I'm right.

437
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,580
It's enough that you betrayed yourself,
why are you lashing out on the others?

438
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:18,180
In the grand speech,
it's for the good of this nation,

439
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:21,310
but in other words, you are
just pleasing the officials!

440
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,960
And you called yourself the Emperor.

441
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,620
Now you are just might as well
be the emperor of courtesans!

442
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,210
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

443
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,840
Greetings, Your Majesty.

444
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:59,220
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

445
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,790
Your Majesty, you will
recover from your illness now.

446
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,070
Your Majesty.

447
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:12,640
I provoked Your Majesty
in order to cure you of the illness.

448
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,740
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

449
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,080
Ying Luo, what's going on? Speak now.

450
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,090
Your Majesty, I went through
His Majesty's medical record...

451
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:22,000
and found that the illness
has taken too much time to heal.

452
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,440
His Majesty has been overworking.

453
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,660
The respiratory system
is blocked by phlegm.

454
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:27,490
I took the liberty to ask
Miss Ying Luo to help.

455
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:31,450
She would have to infuriate Your Majesty
so the phlegm could be coughed out.

456
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:35,730
That is the only way to completely
cure the illness.

457
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,500
His Majesty will recover
from his illness soon?

458
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,640
Of course.

459
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,400
This is great, Your Majesty.

460
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,520
Your Majesty, everything is fine now.

461
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,530
Your Majesty, His Majesty just
coughed out the phlegm along with blood.

462
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:53,240
His body is weak. Let His Majesty...

463
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,000
put his mind at ease and rest well.

464
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,560
Yes, Your Majesty, rest well.

465
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,080
Don't be angry. Keep calm.

466
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,730
Ying Luo did this to cure you.

467
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:07,010
She didn't mean to offend you.

468
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,880
Your Majesty.

469
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:13,170
I know seeing me is enough to anger you.

470
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,540
I won't stay here to be an eyesore.
I shall take my leave now.

471
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,690
Your Majesty, rest well
and get well soon.

472
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,620
Stop there.

473
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:29,130
I feel very dizzy.

474
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:32,210
Ying Luo!

475
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,570
Men, carry Ying Luo out.

476
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:42,450
Physician Ye, take a look at her now.

477
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:43,810
Yes.

478
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,300
Your Majesty, please don't be angry.

479
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,020
Your Majesty, watch your health
or you can't be cured.

480
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,730
Slowly.

481
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,370
Did His Majesty kill Miss Ying Luo?

482
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,030
He didn't. She fainted.

483
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,200
His Majesty was furious.

484
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,080
Maybe she passed out because
she was so scared.

485
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,940
How is His Majesty?

486
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,530
Your Majesty, how do you feel now?

487
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,440
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty?

488
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,950
Your Majesty.

489
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,080
Where is she?

490
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,760
Where is that lowly slave?

491
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,410
Your Majesty.

492
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,450
Your Majesty, do you mean Ying Luo?

493
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,210
Bring her to me.

494
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,450
I will skin her alive!

495
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:53,600
Your Majesty, she only disrespected you
to cure your illness.

496
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:57,280
See? You are in good spirit after
clearing out the phlegm.

497
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:58,690
It's all thanks to her.

498
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,360
Do you really buy that nonsense?

499
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:03,020
Did she bewitched you with
some kind of sorcery?

500
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,830
Why do you believe her?

501
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,240
If she didn't had these thoughts,

502
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:09,550
would it be that easy for her to say them?

503
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:15,070
She's using this opportunity
to spite me when I'm sick.

504
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,540
What are you laughing at?

505
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:24,040
Your Majesty, even if you punish her
for her action,

506
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,810
I'm afraid you can't.

507
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,510
Why?

508
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:31,360
When she went back,
she had high fever and patches of rashes.

509
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:35,290
Physician Ye thinks she was infected
when she was taking care of you.

510
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:37,390
She can barely walk out of her bed.

511
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,690
Is this true?

512
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,760
It's true, Your Majesty.

513
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:54,930
Your Majesty, even if Ying Luo has flaws,

514
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,570
but she did her best to look after you ,

515
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,610
and now she is infected.
With that alone,

516
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:03,710
you should stop blaming her
for those ruthless words.

517
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,580
Otherwise no other people
would devote themselves...

518
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,200
to serve you.

519
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,910
Fine.

520
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:27,040
I won't blame her. I won't blame her.

521
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:30,680
I will order them to take her back
and give her treatment.

522
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,200
Wait.

523
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,760
Let's go.

524
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,330
Miss Ying Luo, what are you doing?

525
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,880
I thought handmaiden who are sick
will be removed from the palace.

526
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:17,450
I'm packing my stuff ,
I don't want to trouble anyone.

527
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:21,090
That is not necessary. You got ill
while tending to His Majesty.

528
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:23,870
We have the best physician here.

529
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:26,670
His Majesty gave you the permission
to get treatment in Yangxin Hall.

530
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:28,870
He even asked Physician Ye to treat you.

531
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:33,340
-He allowed me to stay here?
-Yes.

532
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,200
Did I hear wrongly?

533
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:40,220
His Majesty said it himself.
Who would get it wrong?

534
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,490
Miss Ying Luo, Physician Ye
prescribed this medicine for you.

535
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:45,570
Drink it now.

536
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,770
What is this?

537
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,910
It's Coptis chinensis.

538
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,430
Physician Ye didn't prescribe this
to His Majesty.

539
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:12,020
Of course, but the prescription
that Physician gave you,

540
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,970
this ingredient is necessary.

541
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,400
Why?

542
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:22,520
It clears heat and eliminates dampness.
