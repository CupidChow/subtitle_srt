3
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,120
Continue with her treatment.
Tell her to recuperate in peace.

4
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,200
Young Master!

5
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,780
Young Master!

6
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,640
Why is this perfume pouch with you?

7
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,229
When I was making your bed,

8
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,420
I accidentally picked up this pouch.

9
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,280
Young Mistress must have misunderstood it.
That's why she was so furious.

10
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,340
After that, when she was
not paying attention, I hid it.

11
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,860
When she hit you just now,
why didn't you just hand it to her?

12
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:25,180
You hid it under your pillow so carefully.

13
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,640
You must treasure it a lot.

14
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,160
Thank you.

15
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,680
Young Master!

16
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,590
You are injured. Get up.

17
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,840
I know that I've caused you trouble,

18
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,120
but can you please have mercy on me
and not sell me?

19
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,930
[Young Master.]

20
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,320
Butler Liu.

21
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,940
Yes, Young Master.

22
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,630
After Qing Lian recovers,
let her continue to clean my study room.

23
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,890
As for Young Mistress,

24
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,930
-she's banned from entering my study room.
-Yes, Young Master.

25
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:38,600
You always work until so late.
It's bad for your health.

26
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,450
I cooked this ginseng soup for you.

27
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,050
Drink it before it gets cold.

28
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:49,130
Fu Heng,

29
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,720
I didn't know that the hairpin was for me.

30
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,579
That's why I acted like that.

31
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,750
Look.

32
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,660
I already asked a craftsman to fix it.

33
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:03,950
Take a look at it.

34
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,280
Fu Heng, I was wrong.

35
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,450
Can you please stop being angry at me?

36
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,720
Er Qing,

37
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,120
do you know what your mistake is?

38
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:22,890
We've just been recently married.

39
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,070
You are always busy
with official affairs...

40
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,380
and have no time
to care about my feelings.

41
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,840
I treated her like that...

42
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,700
because I was too jealous
to think straight.

43
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,700
It's not a big deal.

44
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,920
If you like her,
you can take her as your concubine.

45
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,250
But she comes from a lowly family.

46
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,940
She'll embarrass you.

47
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,240
Why can't you understand yet?

48
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,630
I've already apologized.

49
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,060
Why are you still being so harsh?

50
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,900
Just because of a misunderstanding,

51
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,540
you cut her hair...

52
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,630
and pulled out her fingernails.

53
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,990
She's also a person.

54
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,980
Is human life so worthless in your eyes?

55
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,010
Why are you so concerned about her?

56
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,760
The Er Qing who I saw
in Changchun Palace in the past...

57
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,920
was gentle, virtuous, refined and amiable.

58
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,400
But now,

59
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,270
you're always focusing on socialising.

60
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:25,400
You exchange all news about
Fuca's mansion with Laiboo.

61
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,040
And you even bullied a maidservant.

62
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,440
Are you really here
to lead a peaceful life?

63
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,470
The Laiboo you mentioned is
my grandfather. He's not an outsider!

64
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:39,080
Shouldn't the officials stick together?
Don't you need his support?

65
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,320
I don't need it!

66
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,640
His Majesty hates it the most
when the officials form a party.

67
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,880
I've already warned you many times.
Why do you remain incorrigible?

68
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,440
You sound so righteous.

69
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,600
But I think you are so fussy because
you are still in love with Wei Ying Luo!

70
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,700
That's why I'm such an eyesore to you!

71
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,530
Yes.

72
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,200
I admit that she's still in my mind.

73
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,410
But I'm trying.

74
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,990
I'm trying to treat you better.

75
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,780
I try to give you everything you want.

76
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,350
But now,

77
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,220
every time I see you,
you'll remind me of that bloody hands.

78
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,770
Let me tell you this.

79
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,480
Wei Ying Luo is more vicious than I am!

80
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:31,150
She knows whom to love and whom to hate.
She'll never hurt an innocent!

81
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,270
But what about you?

82
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:36,840
You destroyed the life of someone
out of a moment of jealously!

83
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:40,450
It doesn't matter even
if you can't forget her.

84
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,830
I'm your wife now.

85
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,930
I'm the person that you should love.

86
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,600
Hitara Er Qing.

87
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,440
In my eyes,

88
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,860
you can never be compared to Wei Ying Luo.

89
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,380
And I'm disgusted...

90
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,420
with your maliciousness and viciousness.

91
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,240
Fu Heng.

92
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,840
Fu Heng!

93
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,670
Fu Heng!

94
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,520
Fu Heng!

95
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,960
Fu Heng.

96
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,680
Come back.

97
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,280
Come back!

98
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,160
Get up. The ground is cold.

99
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,000
What have I done wrong?

100
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,730
What have I done wrong?

101
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:33,580
I asked my grandfather to support him,
but he didn't appreciate it.

102
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,330
I socialised with the wives
of those in power.

103
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,420
And he accused me for
bandying information around.

104
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,590
And he blamed me for
punishing a maidservant.

105
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,740
Everything I did was for him.

106
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,430
But he hates me so much.

107
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,440
Can you tell me why?

108
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,600
Can anyone tell me why?

109
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,240

00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:36,690
Zhen Zhu,

114
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,590
deliver this to the room.

115
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,600
Alright.

116
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,200
What's wrong?

117
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,200
Er Qing is here again.

118
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,930
She keeps on crying.

119
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,040
Don't get into her way.

120
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,880
Weren't you best friends in the past?

121
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,740
What happened?

122
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,790
Ever since she became the Young Mistress
of Fuca mansion, she changed.

123
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,700
She is now resplendent with jewels
and is insufferably arrogant.

124
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,220
I'm just a servant.

125
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,520
I'm not worthy enough to be her friend.

126
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,050
People won't change that fast.

127
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,600
If she has really changed,

128
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,960
it just means that
you didn't notice it before.

129
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,220
You are right.

130
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,930
Her Majesty used to say that she's very
calculative. Looks like she was right.

131
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,560
Er Qing has always been unwilling
to be a palace maid.

132
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,040
Now, she's just exposing her true nature.

133
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,060
You are still so young.
Why are you sighing all day long?

134
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:40,350
You'll grow old faster because of it.

135
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,360
What are you doing?

136
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,760
What are these?

137
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:47,390
Sister Ming Yu,

138
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:50,150
these are Young Mistress Fuca's luggage.

139
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:59,300
My goodness! Is she
moving back to the palace?

140
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,600
This is outrageous.

141
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,190
Your Majesty,

142
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:11,130
I had served you for six years.
I'm used to it already.

143
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,650
Although I've left the palace,

144
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,480
I still miss you very much.

145
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,120
In the past, palace maids
who served Empress Dowager...

146
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,240
would be summoned back to serve her...

147
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,840
even after they were married
because they missed her.

148
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,770
I'm now married into Fuca mansion.

149
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,360
I'm your sister-in-law.

150
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,470
What's wrong with me
coming back to serve you?

151
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,640
But I already have Ying Luo
and Ming Yu to serve me.

152
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:39,320
-I don't need you to come back.
-Your Majesty.

153
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,800
Fu Heng is always been busy
with his official work.

154
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,200
He only comes back...

155
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,950
two or three times in a month.

156
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,000
And he always stays alone
in his study room.

157
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,590
I am...

158
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,820
too lonely and miserable at home.

159
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,580
That's why I want to
come back to accompany you.

160
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,700
Your Majesty,

161
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,930
don't you want me either?

162
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,330
Er Qing,

163
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,320
tell me the truth.

164
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,200
What happened?

165
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:31,510
Fu Heng favours a maidservant...

166
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:33,430
and often quarrels with me.

167
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:35,850
Due to anger,

168
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,000
I punished that maidservant...

169
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:39,940
and sent Fu Heng into a rage.

170
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,620
Based on my understanding of him,

171
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,920
Fu Heng has never been so furious before.

172
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,400
That implies that...

173
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,850
you've made a grave mistake...

174
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,450
-this time.
-Your Majesty.

175
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,010
Please allow me to...

176
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,170
accompany you here for a while.

177
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,640
At least...

178
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,960
At least wait until Fu Heng's rage
has died down...

179
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,960
before asking me to go back, okay?

180
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:11,980
Fine.

181
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,120
You can stay here for the moment then.

182
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,380
Thank you, Your Majesty.

183
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,820
Mistress, what do you need?

184
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,220
My luggage has not been unpacked yet.

185
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,640
Go and unpack it for me.

186
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,120
Her Majesty's legs...

187
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:45,000
are always in pain during rainy days.

188
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,820
I have to give her a massage right now.

189
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,490
Ming Yu will do it.

190
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,070
As for you,

191
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,100
you just need to unpack my luggage for me.

192
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:58,180
I'll ask someone else to help you
with it then. Please wait for a moment.

193
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,530
Wei Ying Luo!

194
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:01,330
How dare you!

195
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,670
How dare you go against my command?

196
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:10,040
This area under your feet

197
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,640
is Forbidden City.

198
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,290
This is Changchun Palace.

199
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,160
Not Fuca mansion.

200
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,360
Here,

201
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,840
Her Majesty's needs come first.

202
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,100
I'm the mistress and you are the servant!

203
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,410
I'm going to teach you today...

204
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,000
about rules and decorum!

205
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,820
Are you crazy? How dare you hit me.

206
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:38,970
If you want to act like a tyrant,
go back to Fuca mansion!

207
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:42,400
This is Forbidden City. Everyone here
is the servant of His Majesty!

208
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,840
Your status...

209
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,190
is just the same as ours.

210
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,860
If I did a mistake,

211
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,030
Her Majesty will punish me.

212
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,730
How dare you act on
Her Majesty's behalf here?

213
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,960
Servants.

214
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,480
Servants!

215
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,990
Servants!

216
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,790
Servants!

217
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,770
-Zhen Zhu!
-Hitara Er Qing.

218
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,550
Changchun Palace...

219
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,640
is no longer your territory.

220
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,440
You better don't behave atrociously here.

221
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,380
Aren't you afraid that...

222
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,400
I'll tell Her Majesty about this?

223
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,320
When Her Majesty needed you the most,

224
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:32,360
you got married and left the palace
without any hesitation.

225
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,140
You never even looked back.

226
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,000
Now, think about it.

227
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,040
Who will Her Majesty believe?

228
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,090
Hu Po, Zhen Zhu,

229
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,140
the corridor is too slippery.

230
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,240
Mistress Fuca accidentally
slipped and fell.

231
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,810
Please assist her back to her room.

232
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,900
-Mistress Fuca…
-Don't touch me!

233
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,380
Sister Er Qing.

234
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,110
Don't call me that!

235
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,600
How did I treat you before this?

236
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,360
Now, all of you are
bought over by Wei Ying Luo.

237
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,570
You just ignored me, how ungrateful.

238
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,890
Sister Er Qing.

239
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:53,040
The whole Changchun Palace...

240
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,090
is now under Wei Ying Luo's control.

241
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,240
Now, even Sister Ming Yu sides her.

242
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:01,400
It won't do you any good
to go against her.

243
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,290
Her Majesty...

244
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,500
Her Majesty really trusts her that much?

245
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,120
Wei Ying Luo is very loyal...

246
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,260
to Her Majesty.

247
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,840
During the days when Her Majesty was sick,

248
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,150
many were trying to
snoop around or do evil things.

249
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,720
This place was in a chaos.

250
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,840
She flatly refused all visitors and
tightly closed the palace gates.

251
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,680
She only focused on
Her Majesty's recovery.

252
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,720
And she remained by Her Majesty's
side at all times to take care of her.

253
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,650
Not only Her Majesty,
even other people...

254
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,820
sincerely admired her because of it.

255
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,230
So,

256
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,000
don't pick a fight with her.
Try to stay away from her.

257
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,680
Alright.

258
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:44,990
Thank you, Hu Po.

259
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,920
I will never forget
how well you treated me...

260
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:51,830
when I just entered the palace.

261
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,790
I'll always be on your side.

262
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,200
If there's anything
I need in the future...

263
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,060
Just give me the instructions...

264
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,740
and I'll do my best.

265
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,530
[Fu Heng,]

266
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,510
[Wei Ying Luo,]

267
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,280
[both of you have made
my life so miserable.]

268
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:14,890
[I won't let this matter slides.]

269
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,290
Yu Hu,

270
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,950
when I looked into the mirror today,

271
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,560
I felt that I look pale.

272
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,760
Have I become ugly?

273
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,630
Your Majesty, you are a natural beauty.

274
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:33,720
After giving birth to the sixth prince
and nurse yourself with great care,

275
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,850
you'll be more beautiful than before.

276
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,960
I wonder how he will look like.

277
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,360
Will he look like me or His Majesty?

278
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,060
Your Majesty,
it's good to see you like this.

279
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:49,010
If you could have
figured it out earlier...

280
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:56,130
Just let bygones be bygones.

281
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:00,450
To err is human.

282
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:05,120
After thinking it through,
I realised that...

283
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,840
His Majesty is the true man among men.

284
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,720
In this world, no one can compare to him.

285
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,880
Now, I only wish that...

286
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,880
my baby can be safe,

287
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,050
healthy and intelligent.

288
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,070
This child...

289
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,180
is the only one who has
blood ties with me.

290
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,520
This child is the one
I should cherish the most.

291
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,970
You are beautiful and talented.
You are the most favoured consort now.

292
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:35,500
Everyone is envious of you.

293
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,810
After you give birth to your child,

294
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,000
your good days are still to come.

295
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,960
Your Highness.

296
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,530
Your Highness! Guards!

297
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,310
Guards!

298
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,920
Push.

299
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,760
Push harder. Give me more water!

300
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,230
Water!

301
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,470
Take a deep breath!

302
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,960
He's almost out. Push harder.

303
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:15,380
Push.

304
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,290
Alright. He's almost out!

305
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,810
Your Majesty,

306
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,810
Consort Chun has already given birth.

307
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:43,290
The sixth prince has
a full forehead and fine features.

308
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,790
The Empress Dowager likes him a lot.

309
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,920
She personally named him Yong Rong.

310
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,660
Yong Rong.

311
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,670
Intelligent.

312
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,430
The name of jade.

313
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:00,100
Empress Dowager
must like this child a lot.

314
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,660
Not only Empress Dowager,

315
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,200
His Majesty is very happy too.

316
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,560
He immediately made a decree to...

317
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,660
promote Consort Chun
to Noble Consort Chun.

318
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,360
I've been staying in to recuperate.

319
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,120
I don't know anything
that happens in the palace.

320
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,500
If you didn't remind me...

321
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,000
of such a joyous event,

322
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,000
I would've forgotten to congratulate her.

323
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,840
This year, Noble Consort Chun
is the most favoured consort,

324
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,130
And she gave birth to the sixth prince.

325
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,150
She is really at the peak of her time.

326
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,350
Your Majesty,

327
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:50,420
you need to nurse back your health
and bear a royal heir soon.

328
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,080
Royal heir.

329
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:57,490
For me,

330
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,080
it's not an easy task.

331
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:14,880
I know that you've been seriously injured.

332
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,920
And it'll be hard for you
to get pregnant.

333
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,850
So, I especially asked someone to get me
a prescription for pregnancy.

334
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,000
Why don't you give it a try?

335
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,320
A prescription for pregnancy?

336
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:31,510
Use this pill to nurse your health.

337
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:34,640
And as long as His Majesty
stays for the night,

338
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,570
you will surely get pregnant.

339
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,490
Your Majesty, you can't hesitate.

340
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,100
If you have no children,

341
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,880
Empress Dowager will be displeased...

342
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,800
even though she doesn't say it out loud.

343
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,320
His Majesty is very disappointed too.

344
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,920
Fuca clan is also
looking forward to the day...

345
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,280
you give birth to a royal heir.

346
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,160
Your Majesty, this is
not from the palace after all.

347
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,640
Let me have it examined
by Physician Zhang first...

348
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,350
before you take it.

349
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,760
The health of Her Majesty is vital.

350
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,360
Of course you have to do that.

351
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,120
But you have to be cautious.

352
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,280
Let's keep this between the three of us.

353
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,000
Don't tell anyone else.

354
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,800
Including Ying Luo?

355
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:38,290
She only cares about Her Majesty's health.

356
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,450
She is overly cautious.

357
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,550
She didn't even consider...

358
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,550
Her Majesty's future...

359
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,690
if she is without children.

360
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,360
She didn't think about
the future of Fuca clan.

361
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,840
If you tell her about this,

362
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:54,150
-she'll definitely object.
-But…

363
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,120
First,

364
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,160
I'm the daughter-in-law of the Fuca clan.

365
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,220
I'm only concern about your welfare.

366
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,360
Second,

367
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,250
this medicine will definitely
be approved by Physician Zhang.

368
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,690
There's nothing wrong with it.

369
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,280
Ying Luo is overly concerned about me.

370
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,600
Don't tell her...

371
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,160
about this matter for the time being.

372
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,330
Yes, Your Majesty.

373
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:31,810
Sister Er Qing,

374
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,400
is this medicine...

375
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,690
You think too much.

376
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,950
This is indeed
a prescription for pregnancy.

377
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,810
I put in a lot effort to get it.

378
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:48,610
It'll be approved by
the imperial physicians.

379
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:50,950
That pill...

380
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,430
worth a fortune.

381
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,330
I initially got it for myself.

382
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,170
I never thought that...

383
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,450
Good.

384
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,180
When I was not around,

385
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,180
Her Majesty would naturally
trust Wei Ying Luo.

386
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,500
But I'm back now.

387
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,180
I won't let her continue
to act so outrageously.

388
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,910
With this prescription for pregnancy,

389
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,040
I can become the most trusted person
of Her Majesty again.

390
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:33,260
When the time comes,

391
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:37,850
I'll get even with her.

392
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,560
Your Majesty.

393
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,930
Yes, Your Majesty.

394
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,060
Has Her Majesty recovered?

395
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:55,860
Your Majesty, the Imperial physicians
said that she is much better now.

396
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,080
The birth of the sixth prince...

397
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,880
might remind Her Majesty
of Yong Lian again.

398
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,500
I'll go and visit her.

399
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:14,320
Yong Lian!

400
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,320
Your Majesty!

401
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,370
Your Majesty!

402
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,030
I'm here, Your Majesty.

403
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,480
What's wrong?

404
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,090
I dreamt about Yong Lian.

405
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,600
He was crying.

406
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,260
He kept on crying in front of me.

407
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,070
He kept on crying in front of me.

408
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,200
He kept on crying in front of me.

409
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,000
-He kept on crying.
-Your Majesty.

410
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,080
Your Majesty.

411
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,700
When Yong Lian passed away,
he was already nine years old.

412
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,700
He wouldn't be crying incessantly.

413
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,140
It was the cry of the sixth prince.

414
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,420
It was the cry of the sixth prince.

415
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,240
Yes.

416
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,200
It's Yong Rong's cry.

417
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,880
Next time,
I'll bring him along to visit you.

418
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:15,650
He should address you as mother too.

419
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:19,900
Okay.

420
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,860
Okay.

421
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,250
Your Majesty.

422
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,400
I often think about Yong Lian.

423
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,500
But I cannot tell anyone about...

424
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,370
my innermost thoughts.

425
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,760
You are the only one
who understand my pain.

426
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,720
I know.

427
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:55,340
I will...

428
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,380
come here to accompany you
more frequently.

429
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,420
Don't let your mind run rampant.

430
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,700
Everything will get better.

431
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,290
I guarantee you.

432
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,170
Physician Zhang,

433
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,680
you've been checking her pulse
for an hour.

434
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,060
Her Majesty doesn't have
much appetite lately...

435
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,590
and she is getting thinner.

436
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,370
What is the matter with her?

437
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:06,310
Congratulations, Her Majesty!
This is joyous news!

438
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,480
-What do you mean?
-Her Majesty is pregnant.

439
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,030
So, this is joyous news!

440
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:21,660
-Congratulations, Your Majesty!
-Congratulations, Your Majesty!

441
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:26,090
Ming Yu, stop right there!

442
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,920
Did you hide something from me?

443
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:43,010
I don't know what you are talking about.

444
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:48,570
One of Ye Tian Shi's prescriptions...

445
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,570
has eggplant flower in it.

446
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:52,710
It'll result in contraception.

447
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,650
He specifically instructed me...

448
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:57,500
to stop that prescription
only after Her Majesty...

449
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,030
has completely recovered.

450
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,560
But now, Her Majesty is pregnant.

451
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,990
It means that she has stopped
taking it for a long time.

452
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:06,400
Ying Luo, I...

453
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:07,820
Wei Ying Luo.

454
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,160
Do we have to report everything to you...

455
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,540
in Changchun Palace?

456
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,290
-You are the one behind this.
-To put it more accurately,

457
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,180
without me,

458
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:31,820
there'll be no good news
in Changchun Palace.

459
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,260
All of you knew about it.

460
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,760
I was the only one in the dark.

461
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:46,040
I'm sorry.

462
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,600
I didn't mean to!

463
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,020
Ying Luo!

464
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:15,280
The shoes you made are really good.

465
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,280
They are pretty and comfortable.
I'm very satisfied.

466
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:24,600
The weather is so good
but you're sulking here.

467
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:25,910
Why?

468
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:27,580
Don't tell me. Let me guess.

469
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,850
You are worried about matters
concerning Changchun Palace again.

470
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,050
Am I right?

471
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,470
Her Majesty is pregnant.

472
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,140
That's joyous news.

473
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,770
But Ye Tian Shi said that...

474
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,410
Her Majesty is weak.

475
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,820
If she gets pregnant again,
it'll be harmful to her health.

476
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,840
Her Majesty clearly knows it.

477
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,570
But she still made that choice.

478
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,760
I really don't understand.

479
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,160
Is her health more important
or a royal heir?

480
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,720
Remember this.

481
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,840
In this palace,

482
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,120
having a royal heir
is the most important thing...

483
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,510
no matter what status that person has.

484
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,420
Think about it. Her Majesty is ill now.

485
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,180
Noble Consort Xian
is holding all the power.

486
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,720
And Noble Consort Chun
is favoured by His Majesty.

487
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,350
If Her Majesty continues to be so weak,

488
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,670
sooner or later, she will be replaced.

489
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,800
Her Majesty' decision is correct.

490
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:28,290
No need to be upset about it.

491
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,680
I don't care about power or favour.

492
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,540
I just want Her Majesty to be safe.

493
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,550
In this world,

494
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:39,930
only you think that way.

495
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,440
Enough. What has happened
has already happened.

496
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,000
Since Her Majesty has already
made up her mind,

497
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,740
the most important thing now is for you...

498
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:51,870
to help your mistress give birth
to her child safely.

499
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,110
Er Qing,

500
00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:00,680
His Majesty will summon Fu Heng
to come back to the capital soon.

501
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,760
Once he comes back from Shanxi,
I'll ask him to bring you back.

502
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,160
Your Majesty, don't disturb him from work.

503
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,950
I can't bear to leave you.

504
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,690
I want to accompany you until you
successfully give birth to your child.

505
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:13,600
How can a newly-married couple...

506
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,250
stay apart all the time?

507
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:16,890
Don't be silly.

508
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,240
Mother is very worried about him...

509
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,720
being so far in Shanxi.

510
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,720
At first, she asked me to go with him.

511
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,280
But he refused.

512
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,780
Later,

513
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:34,400
she asked that maidservant, Qing Lian,
to go there and take care of him.

514
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,800
By name, she is to take care of him.

515
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,180
But she just wants to
make her into his concubine.

516
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,400
The two of them are so close together now.

517
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,870
He won't think about me.

518
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,040
Nonsense.

519
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:48,250
I know Fu Heng best.

520
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,740
He's not that kind of person.

521
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:51,990
Yes, Your Majesty.

522
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,100
He's affectionate towards everyone...

523
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,960
except me.

524
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,890
Forget it, Her Majesty.

525
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:06,200
Let's not talking about him anymore.
Let's talk about something happy.

526
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,910
So beautiful!

527
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,160
Is this for the little prince?

528
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,600
You're mad at me for half a year already.

529
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,800
Wei Ying Luo, why are you so petty?

530
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:28,130
I'm indeed petty.

531
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,030
What are you doing?

532
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,840
You don't pay me any attention anyway.

533
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,500
So, I want to vent out my anger.

534
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:44,280
Do you think I'm you? I've already
stopped being mad at you for a long time.

535
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:47,940
I'm unable to embroider delicate works now
because my fingers have become coarse.

536
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:50,800
But I am still able to
sew a bellyband for the little prince.

537
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,350
You're really not angry at me anymore?

538
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,800
I promise that I won't hide
anything from you again, okay?

539
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:01,350
Stop being angry at me.

540
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,330
Stop being angry at me.

541
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:07,550
Go and accompany Her Majesty.
Make sure that she doesn't fall down.

542
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,000
Er Qing is already with her.

543
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,159
Go with them.

544
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,460
Fine. I'll go with them now.

545
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,840
I don't know why you are
so suspicious of her.

546
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,900
Why are you still
so paranoid after so long?

547
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,020
Go now.

548
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,330
Here you go.

549
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,600
Yong Rong has become
so close to you now.

550
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:39,510
He will start looking for you
every time he wakes up in the morning.

551
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,760
Okay now. Let's go.

552
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:56,370
Your Majesty,

553
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,680
I've already deciphered...

554
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,070
the chess game you left for me yesterday.

555
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:02,260
Do you want to see it?

556
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,180
I suddenly remember that
I have something to do.

557
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,000
You should go to bed first.

558
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,390
Your Majesty.

559
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,690
Farewell, Your Majesty.

560
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,720
Your Highness,
what's wrong with His Majesty?

561
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,740
He looks so troubled.

562
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,040
What day is it today?

563
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:44,980
Your Majesty, drinking too much wine
will harm your health.

564
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:47,970
-Let me replace it with a cup of warm tea.
-Go away.

565
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:57,470
Your Majesty,

566
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:01,560
if you are troubled by something,
please tell us about it.

567
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:03,830
Although I'm dumb,

568
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:07,330
I might be able to relieve
some of your worries.

569
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,510
Today...

570
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:13,310
is the death anniversary of Yong Lian.

571
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,710
When my father named him Yong Lian,

572
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,860
he had the intention of
letting him succeed the throne.

573
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,760
Yong Lian didn't disappoint him as well.

574
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:44,350
He was naturally intelligent
and was very diligent.

575
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:49,680
When he was eight,

576
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:53,000
I brought him along for an imperial hunt.

577
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,040
He shot down an eagle...

578
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,490
and personally brought it to me.

579
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,160
Among all the princes,

580
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,480
Yong Lian was my favourite son.

581
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,460
Unfortunately,

582
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,640
his lifespan was short.

583
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,110
He died young.

584
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,420
When I saw the sixth prince today,

585
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,050
I couldn't help but to think of him.

586
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,900
Your Majesty,

587
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:36,570
when Crown Prince Duanhui passed away,

588
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:40,880
you called off all court meetings
for five days to mourn him.

589
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,940
You're are a very loving father.

590
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,760
How could there be
a father in this world...

591
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,600
who never shed tears when his son died?

592
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,240
But an emperor can only cry...

593
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,760
for three reasons.

594
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,980
The first is for the death of his parents.

595
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,200
The second is when a serious
natural disaster befalls us.

596
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,330
And the third is when the empire falls.

597
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:29,660
Otherwise,

598
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,820
he will be punished by heaven
and his ancestors.

599
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,580
I'm the son of heaven.

600
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,850
All the citizens in this empire
are my children.

601
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,100
Yong Lian is not my only son.

602
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,280
So,

603
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:50,640
even if Her Majesty hated me
for being heartless...

604
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,120
and cold,

605
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:56,420
I had never shed a tear...

606
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,360
or showed my pain.

607
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,720
But tonight,

608
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:10,310
I...

609
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,790
keep thinking about Yong Lian.

610
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,670
Your Majesty,

611
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,010
I am not a smooth talker.

612
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,080
I don't know how to comfort you.

613
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,600
But I think that...

614
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,850
since Her Majesty is pregnant now,

615
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,080
the future little prince...

616
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:39,280
will surely be as smart as
Crown Prince Duanhui back then.

617
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,000
He won't disappoint you.

618
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,490
Your Majesty!

619
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,600
Your Majesty!

620
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,370
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty,

621
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,300
Her Majesty has just gone to bed.

622
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:03,090
What's wrong, Your Majesty?

623
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,130
You are that...

624
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,760
annoying Wei Ying Luo.

625
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,430
Why will you appear even in my dream?

626
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:28,460
You are annoying.

627
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,650
You are so annoying.

628
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,320
Look at you.

629
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,620
You are a little bit pretty.

630
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,840
But you are so cunning.

631
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,830
Woman who looks like you...

632
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,920
is destined to be alone forever.

633
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,100
You'll stay in the palace forever...

634
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,300
and I have to feed you for a lifetime.

635
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,970
Your Majesty!

636
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,740
What's wrong?

637
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,120
Your Majesty.

638
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,860
Why did you drink so much?

639
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,320
The imperial physician
checked your pulse today.

640
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,760
This baby will surely be a prince.

641
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,000
I know that...

642
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,200
Yong Lian is coming back to us.

643
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:31,180
Your Majesty,

644
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,680
-what are you talking about?
-Yong Lian...

645
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,640
was intelligent and good-looking.
There was no one like him.

646
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:43,830
He'll always be my most beloved son.

647
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,760
When he passed away,

648
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,360
I was so sad.

649
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,920
My heart ached.

650
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:54,810
But I knew that...

651
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:58,560
one day, he will surely come back to us.

652
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:01,910
Look.

653
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,720
He'll come back to us soon.

654
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,170
What are you looking at?

655
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,450
Li Yu.

656
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:18,510
She always angers me.
I hate her so much.

657
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,770
She's so spiteful!

658
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:22,120
-Your Majesty, calm down!
-She's indeed spiteful!

659
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,320
-Your Majesty.
-Ying Luo.

660
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,320
Let me tell you...

661
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,350
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

662
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,940
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

663
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:28,940
Your Majesty.

664
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:30,400
Forgive me.

665
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,810
I'm fine.

666
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,210
Your Majesty,

667
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:37,410
be careful of your health.

668
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,150
Ask Yong Lian this.

669
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,680
I was always busy...

670
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,400
with state affairs before this.

671
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:49,330
I never accompanied him even for a day.

672
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:50,770
I never even hugged him.

673
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:54,070
Does he blame me?

674
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:56,230
Is he willing...

675
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,310
to be my son again?
