[Story of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 20]

7
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,789
Why?

8
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:58,200
It clears the heat and
eliminates dampness.

9
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,080
-Physician Ye.
-Yes.

10
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,920
Did that servant drink the medicine?

11
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,050
With Your Majesty's order,
she will certainly drink it.

12
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,360
But I don't quite understand,

13
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,210
why must Your Majesty use
Coptis chinensis in the medicine?

14
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,930
That servant is full of ill tricks.

15
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,800
Her vile intention is oozing out of her.

16
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:35,640
Coptis chinensis clears the heat
and poison. It's just right for her.

17
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:39,870
By the way,

18
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,360
any other prescription that
are even more bitter?

19
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,840
Your Majesty, why don't you just kill her?

20
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,040
How could you torment people like this?

21
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,300
I'm a wise ruler.

22
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:02,410
How could a wise ruler just
kill someone who carries merits?

23
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,140
If words got out, won't I be criticized
as being so petty?

24
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,520
Yes, I misspoke just now.

25
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,040
Your Majesty, in terms of
the most bitter medicine,

26
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,120
gold thread, akebia, and
gentian are all very bitter plants,

27
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,030
but the most bitter is bitter ginseng.

28
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,390
Starting from today, for all her meals,

29
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,630
give her a different
bitter medicine every meal.

30
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:35,820
If she refuses to drink it,
use of force is allowed.

31
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,100
A bitter medicine is
good for one's illness.

32
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,620
I'm doing because I want to save
the life of my saviour.

33
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,860
Do you know what I mean?

34
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,920
Yes, I will strictly abide to
Your Majesty's order.

35
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,290
Chief Li, if His Majesty
really hates Miss Ying Luo,

36
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,360
he could just give her poison.
Why must he torment her like this?

37
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,290
His Majesty told us.

38
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,160
Although Wei Ying Luo was ruthless to him,
but she cured his illness.

39
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,000
She should be rewarded for her work.

40
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,030
We could tell the world she died
from the illness,

41
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,410
won't that be simpler?

42
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,810
What do you mean?

43
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,960
It's so hard to predict one's fate.

44
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,600
The heart of the Emperor is not
for lowly peasants like us to predict.

45
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,120
Just do whatever His Majesty
has instructed.

46
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,130
Stop worrying.

47
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:36,909
Got it.

Was it him?

62
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,430
Miss Ying Luo, it's me.

63
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,490
Physician Ye.

64
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,520
This sulphur ointment is used
to treat furunculosis.

65
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,450
It's not meant for your condition.
Use this instead.

66
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,700
Thank you, Physician Ye.

67
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,330
But, Miss Ying Luo,

68
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:28,720
there's one thing I don't understand
and I want to ask you about it.

69
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,000
-What is it?
-You knew you're allergic to peanuts,

70
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,780
so why did you still take it in?

71
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,760
Why do you want to get the rashes?

72
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,320
You even asked me to fake
your medical record.

73
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,680
You really want to know?

74
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,780
I deliberately angered His Majesty.

75
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,740
Once he recovers from the shock,
he surely will want a payback.

76
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,620
If I get sick,

77
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,450
no matter how angry he is,

78
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,340
he wouldn't punish me any more.

79
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:01,470
After all, everyone knows
I got sick for taking care of him.

80
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,830
So that's the case.

81
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,660
You lectured the Emperor
and got away with it,

82
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:11,120
only you could have achieved such feat,
I am deeply impressed.

83
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,540
I lectured His Majesty...

84
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,920
because I wanted him to get well.

85
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,760
But His Majesty thinks you merely
used the opportunity to lash out.

86
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:23,540
Well, the bitter medicine works the best,
harsh words bear the most truth.

87
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,300
I'm now being misunderstood.

88
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,320
But I still have to thank you
for helping me get away with it.

89
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,940
I'm very impressed with your loyalty.

90
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:35,679
Don't worry. I surely will do my best...

91
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:37,590
not to show any error in the plan.

92
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,059
Thanks.

93
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,680
Where's that servant?

94
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,290
Your Majesty, do you mean Miss Wei?

95
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:01,920
Miss Wei has fully recovered
and has moved back to Changchun Palace.

96
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:05,000
When?

97
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,860
Just last night.

98
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,920
Your Majesty, please forgive me.
I am to be blamed.

99
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,880
Do you know what is your mistake?

100
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,250
I need Your Majesty to enlighten me.

101
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,000
She clearly got infected after me.

102
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,920
It will at least take one month
for her to recover.

103
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,110
How did she get well before I do?

104
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,910
Maybe her condition wasn't as severe?

105
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,420
Stupid!

106
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,420
Because she's not sick!

107
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,460
You actually let her go?

108
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,430
Your Majesty, I saw it with my eyes.

109
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,650
There are so many big red rashes.

110
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,880
You'll get scared when you see it.

111
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,360
Wrong. If those rashes were fake,

112
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,340
Your Majesty, she would be
deceiving the Emperor!

113
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,150
You must punish her!

114
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,580
Change my clothes.

115
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,320
I'm going to Changchun Palace personally
and punish her action.

116
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,840
Wei Ying Luo offended His Majesty,
yet she got away untouched.

117
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,840
She did that and still lives?
That was truly impressive.

118
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,280
That day at Yangxin Palace,
even the table got destroyed.

119
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,280
His Majesty was furious.

120
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,320
Don't you know? Physician Ye used
the same tactic as Hua Tuo did.

121
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,450
He needed to anger His Majesty
to clear phlegm,

122
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,520
but no one would dare to
go against the Emperor.

123
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,400
Only Wei Ying Luo was brave enough to
disrespect His Majesty and saved him.

124
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,210
-Really? How dare her!
-It's true.

125
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,410
Not only did Wei Ying Luo lash out
to His Majesty,

126
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,650
she even caught furunculosis
while taking care of the Emperor.

127
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:33,690
Look at her.

128
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,200
She is already the most
favoured handmaiden of Changchun Palace.

129
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,080
And now she saved His Majesty's life,
we shouldn't raffle with her feathers.

130
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,560
From what I see, His Majesty's patience
was greater than any of us.

131
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:48,880
He's a generous ruler. Other kings
would have beheaded Wei Ying Luo.

132
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,880
If the people know about this, they will
surely think His Majesty is benevolent.

133
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,910
-Wei Ying Luo's bravery is to be sung.
-This is a tale worthy to be told.

134
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,310
Your Majesty, are we still
going to Changchun Palace?

135
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,250
Turn around.

136
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,340
Didn't you hear it?

137
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,050
She provoked me to save me.

138
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,680
She got infected with a grave illness
while tending to me.

139
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,320
People will applaud her bravery
for taking such risk.

140
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,380
Moreover, she's now fully recovered.

141
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,480
We can't find any evidence against her.

142
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,220
If I punish her now,

143
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:48,410
I would be seen as an petty ingrate
who don't appreciate her loyalty.

144
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:53,710
I have no ways to deal with her right now!
No one will understand my frustration.

145
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,720
Your Majesty. Keep up!

146
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,320
Your Majesty!

147
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,710
Guess who I am.

148
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,220
Ying Luo, this is not funny.

149
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,100
If others see it,

150
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,200
they will think lowly of you.

151
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,970
-It could be that bad?
-Yes.

152
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:27,240
Why then did someone secretly
take care of me for the whole night?

153
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,130
What did you say?

154
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:34,030
Every time I have allergic reaction,
my body will itch all over.

155
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,970
Physician Ye increased the dose for me,
it got me drowsy all night.

156
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:43,090
But every night,
there is a Prince Charming...

157
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:46,510
who would come to my room
and take care of me.

158
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,030
I thought that Prince Charming was you!

159
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,500
You're sick? Are you not feeling well?

160
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,240
Haven't you been taking care of me?
How could you not know?

161
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,700
If I had stayed here,
I would be on guard duty,

162
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,280
I don't have time to take care of you.

163
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,600
It's not you?

164
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:08,170
But who could it be?

165
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,780
Could it be that your dream reflected...

166
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,160
your thoughts and yearnings
during the day?

167
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,950
Ying Luo, I was in your dream?

168
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,150
I...

169
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,330
How is that possible?
Why would I dream of you?

170
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,140
Are you sure?

171
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,110
Forget it...

172
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:39,350
Since it's not you, I'm going now.

173
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,280
Miss Ying Luo.

174
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,310
Hey, I won't cover your shift again.
I've been on shift for ten nights!

175
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,120
My bones are falling apart.

176
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,120
Fu Heng! Your shameless liar!

177
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,390
-Shameless?
-Ying Luo!

178
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,150
Blabbermouth!

179
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,820
What was that?

180
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,200
Ying Luo. Don't be mad.

181
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,560
I knew it was you.

182
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:16,040
You came into my room at night
and you lied about it.

183
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,530
-Keep it going, what do you want?
-I...

184
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,400
-I...
-You took advantage of me.

185
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:24,330
I should tell the Empress about this.

186
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,920
Ying Luo!

187
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:31,650
I am sorry, I didn't mean it.

188
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,690
Tell me then,

189
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,240
why did you lie it wasn't you?

190
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:48,200
It was improper of me to go
into your room without your permission.

191
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,850
But you're sick.
You need someone to take care of you.

192
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,070
I could only do it then.

193
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,060
So,

194
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:02,260
you think of yourself as a gentleman.

195
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:05,330
You see your actions
as upright and decent.

196
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,600
I do.

197
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,550
So why did you kiss me?

198
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:14,940
I...

199
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,960
I...

200
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,010
Your Majesty, the landscape painting...

201
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,120
has smooth brush strokes,
it shows a vast overview.

202
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,880
In the "Ode to the Goddess Luo" painting,
the form depicts the spirit.

203
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,700
His Majesty will surely like
the painting you choose for him.

204
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,850
I've been pondering,
but I couldn't decide.

205
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,030
I need your help to pick
the best for me.

206
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:51,480
And not even you could decide.

207
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,910
Ying Luo, what do you think?

208
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,800
Of course, the landscape painting!

209
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:08,200
The strokes are more discrete,
but they were vigorous and brisk.

210
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,360
It's "Summer"...

211
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,440
in the "Landscape of the Seasons"
given by Guard Fuca.

212
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,120
Ming Yu, Consort Chun didn't ask you.

213
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,350
Do not speak unless you are asked.

214
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,470
You need to behave better.
Leave us be.

215
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,680
Your Majesty, please forgive her.

216
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,760
Ming Yu was just being outspoken.

217
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,560
I am worried if her old habit
isn't taken care of,

218
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,640
she might get herself
into troubles in the future.

219
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,900
That is why I must be strict to her.

220
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,490
I hope she will one day understand
my effort for her own good.

221
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:52,850
Yes.

222
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,210
Ying Luo, you haven't
answered the question.

223
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,040
Consort Chun, if I were to pick one,

224
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,920
I surely will choose
the "Ode to the Goddess Luo" painting.

225
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,079
Why?

226
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:09,810
Goddess of Luo looks intelligent
and composed, and sentimental.

227
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,760
She even shares
some resemblance with Her Majesty.

228
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,119
Every time His Majesty
looks at this painting,

229
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,930
it will remind him of the painter.

230
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:19,250
Isn't that better?

231
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,890
Smart! That's exactly what we want!

232
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,160
Your Majesty, the "Ode to the Goddess Luo"
would be a great birthday present...

233
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,630
to His Majesty.

234
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,340
Your Majesty, Changchun Palace has a copy
of the "Landscape of the Four Seasons"

235
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,130
by Liu Songnian of
the Southern Song Dynasty.

236
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,060
May I have a look at it?

237
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,610
-Er Qing.
-Here.

238
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,910
Quickly get it and
give to Consort Chun as a gift.

239
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,310
Gift?

240
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:01,120
Your Majesty, you mustn't.

241
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,170
It's not some very precious item.

242
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:06,030
Since you like it, just take it.

243
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,240
Thank you, Your Majesty.

244
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,990
Get working.

245
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,200
Yes.

246
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:20,270
Please wait. I'll go inside
and inform Her Majesty.

247
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,230
What's going on?

248
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,250
Sister Ming Yu, Noble Lady Shu
and Attendant Qing...

249
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:32,130
are here to visit Her Majesty.

250
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,920
I'll inform her now.

251
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:37,200
Her majesty is taking her rest,
she is not seeing any guests.

252
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,990
Miss Ming Yu, I ordered my men...

253
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,160
to bring me some
blood bird's nest from Fujian.

254
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,770
It's a present for Her Majesty.
Please inform Her Majesty for us.

255
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,800
The Changchun Palace
is highly favoured by His Majesty.

256
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,970
We are never short on precious items.

257
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,810
It's just a measly blood bird's nest.
You think we haven't seen one?

258
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,510
Miss Ming Yu, that's not what we meant.

259
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:00,000
I told you Her Majesty is not
seeing any guests.

260
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,910
Please at another time.

261
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:03,650
Please leave.

262
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,980
You...

263
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,600
Fine. We'll just visit another day.

264
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,120
Let's go.

265
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,990
Sister Ming Yu,
that doesn't seem adequate.

266
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,000
They are just two unfavoured consorts.
I'm not afraid,

267
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,520
so why are you?

268
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,930
But...

269
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,560
Don't you understand?

270
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,960
Nalan Chun Xue has come here
so many times.

271
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,070
It's either gifts or flowers.
Do think she doesn't come with motives?

272
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,520
Listen closely, she is just planning
to use Her Majesty as connection...

273
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,520
to approach His Majesty.

274
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:46,770
Her Majesty is a generous person,
so she couldn't refuse her.

275
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:50,830
So I shall keep watch for Her Majesty
so no one would take advantage of her.

276
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:00,820
Hold on. There must be someone inside,

277
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,750
but she lied to us that Her Majesty
is taking a rest.

278
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,140
That is insult beyond any degree!

279
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:11,870
Sister Nalan, we don't want trouble.
Just let it go.

280
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,610
If this place doesn't want us,

281
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,400
there will be a place for us.

282
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,390
Sister, where are you going?

283
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,030
Wait for me.

284
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,150
I've long heard the daughter
of Assistant Minister...

285
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,510
is very knowledgeable, polite,
brilliant and beautiful.

286
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,460
I had been very curious.

287
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,580
But it seemed to have taken you
far too long to pay me a visit.

288
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,920
Your Highness, please forgive me.

289
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,860
I had been sick for quite some time,
I couldn't visit Your Highness.

290
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,340
I didn't want you infected.

291
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:53,460
Once I recovered,
I immediately came to visit you.

292
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,420
You're sick?

293
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,850
Do you feel better now?

294
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:02,160
Of course, I wouldn't dare to step foot in
the Chuxiu Palace unless I am well.

295
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,260
You were rejected by Changchun Palace
so you come to my Chuxiu Palace.

296
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,760
Do you think so lowly of me?

297
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:11,960
Leave!

298
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,730
We shouldn't have bothered Your Highness.
We'll leave right away.

299
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,520
Sister.

300
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,030
Changchun Palace looked down on me,

301
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,390
it infuriated me so I left.

302
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,830
But as it turned out,
Chuxiu Palace is no better.

303
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,160
You looked down on us...

304
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,740
...who are not as prestigious as you are.

305
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,420
Yes, I have none of your respect,

306
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,390
but are you certain...

307
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,670
I won't rise to my glory
some day in the future?

308
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,540
I'll take my leave.

309
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,520
Stop right there.

310
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,500
Your Highness, any other instructions?

311
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,800
You want to join my side but couldn't
endure just a few mockings.

312
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,350
You will amount to nothing.

313
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,230
Your Highness.

314
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,420
There is a foul beast in Changchun Palace,

315
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,790
it's always barking. I hate it.

316
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,550
Since you want to defect,

317
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,150
I'll then give you a chance.

318
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,110
Your Highness, you want me to...

319
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:33,030
eliminate that foul beast?

320
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,960
Your Highness, don't worry.

321
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:41,600
I will not disappoint you.

322
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:53,030
Sister Nalan, what are you up to now?

323
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,970
Don't be such a coward.

324
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,400
I brought you here to
meet Noble Consort Gao.

325
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,550
You got so scared you could barely speak.

326
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,270
I...

327
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,900
I'm very scared.

328
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,440
Enough, I know you are scared.

329
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,240
I will take care of this matter.

330
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:11,780
You don't need to know.

331
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:16,740
Sister. Sister Nalan, wait for me.

332
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,720
Your Majesty.

333
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:56,360
Your Majesty. The painting's been mounted.

334
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,380
I didn't expect Ruyi Hall
to get it done so soon.

335
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,290
I thought it would require
a couple more days.

336
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,660
Your Majesty, are you...

337
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,000
I think we will make it in time
for His Majesty's birthday.

338
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,850
Then that's the end of your sister's case?

339
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,710
I have no more leads.

340
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,250
But as long as I can wait patiently,

341
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:36,240
the truth will prevail.

342
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,180
You are just so stubborn.

343
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,130
I can't talk you out of this.

344
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,600
You must be careful on your own.

345
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,780
Don't worry, Madam. I am aware of it.

346
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,230
By the way,

347
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,280
there used to be a bag of Lake Jili silk
in the embroidery workshop.

348
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,450
It was sent as tribute from Huzhou.

349
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,440
I went looking for it earlier.
Where did you hide it?

350
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,640
There is not end to your recklessness.

351
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,040
That Lake Jili silk is a treasure.

352
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,250
Why do you want it?

353
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,750
Madam.

354
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,730
I want to help Her Majesty.

355
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:18,770
The Empress?

356
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:26,170
Ying Luo, your actions seem
more confusing as days go by.

357
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,440
You went to Changchun Palace
for your sister's death.

358
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:35,870
But why have you become so
concerned about Her Majesty?

359
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:39,020
I'll tell you but don't
you make fun of me.

360
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:41,250
I won't.

361
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,500
Empress is especially nice to me.

362
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,730
She always comes to me defence no matter
what mistake I have made.

363
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,440
She even taught me how to read and write.

364
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,300
Every time I see Her Majesty smile,

365
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,650
I feel like I am seeing my sister.

366
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,980
So I want to help her.

367
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:09,650
Empress has a high status
and she is the head of the six palaces.

368
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,550
You? How do you help her?

369
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:16,280
Don't underestimate me.

370
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,880
Even a peasant is capable of greatness.

371
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,640
You are unbelievable.

372
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,320
I've been anticipating
your painting, my Empress.

373
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,370
Is it time to show us?

374
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:38,400
Today you received the gifts
of the officers at Taihe Hall.

375
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,820
You have seen your fair share of
trinkets for today.

376
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:43,560
Mine pales in comparison.

377
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,260
When my father was alive,
he complimented your calligraphy.

378
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,770
This painting is drawn with
dark ink and clear strokes.

379
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:14,590
The strokes are steady and vivid.
It's clearly a masterpiece.

380
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:19,290
You used a dry brush
for the pavilion, I think.

381
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:23,660
That was very observant of you,
Your Majesty.

382
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,450
The calligraphy is elegant yet imposing.

383
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,480
Great painting. Li Yu, put it to care.

384
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,920
Yes.

385
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:43,840
Your Majesty, I have no talent
matching Her Majesty.

386
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,090
I can't bring about a painting like that.

387
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:47,770
After pondering for days,

388
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:51,040
I decided to present to you
the work of another master.

389
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,260
This tune.

390
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,380
The sound of this instrument.

391
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:15,430
Your Majesty, I don't mean to be rude,

392
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,910
but may I ask Your Majesty to unveil this?

393
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,250
What instrument are they holding?

394
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:42,990
I don't recognize any of it.

395
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,260
That long tube must be the flute.

396
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,300
How fascinating.

397
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,120
I've never seen any of these.

398
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,410
These are Western instruments
of Emperor Kangxi.

399
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:00,660
Two Western musicians brought
these instruments to the Forbidden City.

400
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,640
Emperor Kangxi even
learned from them for a while.

401
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:07,770
I came across these instruments...

402
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,680
in the storeroom, I find it such a shame
to leave them covered in dust.

403
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,780
I hired two Western technicians
to repair them.

404
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,200
And it turned out to be quite effective.

405
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,020
These Western instruments laid
idle in the storeroom for so long.

406
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:25,060
I didn't think I could witness
these being played again.

407
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:37,490
That flute was a gift
from a French musician.

408
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,840
This violin.

409
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:55,160
This violin was made under
the guidance of Thomas,

410
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,200
the music teacher of Emperor Kangxi,

411
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,640
it was handmade by
the craftsman of Great Qing.

412
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,480
Emperor Kangxi cherished this.

413
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,260
And he studied for
a couple of years under Thomas.

414
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,230
He could even play a tune himself.

415
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,460
Noble Consort. Putting together
this Western music orchestra...

416
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:16,260
must have required so much
of your time and effort.

417
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,490
Repairing wasn't the hardest part.

418
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,160
The hard part was to gather people
who can play the Western instruments.

419
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,230
But as long as Your Majesty is happy,

420
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,470
all of my effort will be worthwhile.

421
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:37,300
I'm happy. I've not been this happy
in a long time.

422
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,130
Continue.

423
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,730
Sister Nalan, these are just
some Western instruments.

424
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,760
How is His Majesty so happy?

425
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,370
What do you know?

426
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,790
His Majesty was
Emperor Kangxi's favourite.

427
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,020
He brought him into the palace
to teach him personally.

428
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,330
When it comes to Emperor Kangxi,

429
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,080
His Majesty adored him
more than the Late Emperor.

430
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,740
Think about it. It's been years
since Emperor Kangxi passed away.

431
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,980
His Majesty is seeing again
the Western instruments...

432
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,780
Emperor Kangxi loved so much.

433
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,570
How can he not be touched?

434
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:21,700
Sister Nalan, you are so resourceful.

435
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,180
Does it matter? Imperial Household
Department is no coffee shop.

436
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:31,090
To put together this orchestra
was almost impossible.

437
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,300
It's such a shame.
This could have been a great idea,

438
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,590
I had no choice but to
let her steal the spotlight.

439
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,760
Your Majesty,

440
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:52,400
it's not just me who put in much
thoughts for your birthday celebration.

441
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,120
Noble Lady Shu has
contributed much as well.

442
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,820
Would you like to see her gift?

443
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,340
Noble Lady Shu?

444
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:05,710
Your Majesty, I prepared
a glazed Buddhist tower for you.

445
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:07,980
May you cast your royal gaze.

446
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:16,190
It is delicately made.

447
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,470
This is Buddhist stone?

448
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:31,080
Your Majesty, a common Buddhist stone
is nothing astonishing.

449
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,200
But the Buddhist stone
on top of the tower is translucent.

450
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,520
It looks like a lotus flower.

451
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:39,360
It was from Tang Dynasty's High Monk
after his ascension from this world,

452
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,590
the most precious stone
among the over 700 stones.

453
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,920
Legend has it, this came from his heart.

454
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,080
So it was later dubbed,
the Buddhist lotus.

455
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:53,650
Your Majesty, isn't Empress Dowager
looking for this Buddhist Lotus?

456
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,340
I've dispatched numerous teams to Suzhou.

457
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,840
Yet they have all returned empty-handed.

458
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,520
I had thought it was merely a legend.

459
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,580
As it turned out, the legend is real.

460
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,980
Put it to care.

461
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,000
I was very fortunate...

462
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:14,300
to have received this by coincidence
at a temple on Mount Tai.

463
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,530
Buddhist Lotus is a rare treasure.

464
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,260
It should belong to someone
who is linked to Buddha.

465
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,870
Naturally I wouldn't dare
to keep it myself.

466
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,200
May Your Majesty present
it to Empress Dowager.

467
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,800
You're thoughtful.

468
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,360
Empress. Other than
this glazed Buddhist tower,

469
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,480
pick a few gifts that are interesting...

470
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,460
and send them to Empress Dowager.

471
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:41,800
Yes.

472
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:46,190
Ying Luo. Make sure...

473
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,120
this glazed Buddhist tower is not damaged.

474
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,370
Yes.

475
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,360
One figurine of Wise Longevity Buddha.

476
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:15,139
A pair of celestial crane and deer vases.

477
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,070
A pair of everlasting life brocade
patterned lamps.

478
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,639
What are you doing?

479
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,239
Registering and preserving treasures.

480
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:35,190
It's always been my task.

481
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,679
I don't need you to
meddle beyond your duty.

482
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,080
It's an order from Her Majesty.

483
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,280
Didn't you hear His Majesty's order?

484
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,960
Select some item
the Empress Dowager would like.

485
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,250
Do you know Empress Dowager's liking?

486
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,219
Since you know nothing,
don't get in the way.

487
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,090
Zhen Zhu, continue.

488
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,440
It hasn't been too long
since I entered the palace,

489
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,040
of course I didn't know
what her interests are.

490
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,210
I shall leave it to you, Ming Yu,

491
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,440
to register every detail.

492
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,620
Be sure to select them carefully.

493
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,310
You are leaving the work to me
and going on your merry way?

494
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,480
You are excited to display
your capability,

495
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,480
of course I won't steal your chance.

496
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:32,270
Don't worry. I will report to Her Majesty
that all the merits go to you.

497
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,860
Bootlicker!

498
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,870
[If the night my sister died,]

499
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:51,730
[someone went from Qianqing Palace
to Imperial Garden to commit the murder,]

500
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,700
[how much time does one need
to make the round trip?]

501
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,230
[Can one evade the patrol?]

502
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:24,950
It's me.

503
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,680
Young Master?

504
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,790
You almost broke my feet.

505
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,970
You shouldn't have scared me just now.

506
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,090
Where is this place?

507
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,400
Huh?

508
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,850
In the depth of the stone beam,
a night of hiding play.

509
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,210
Mist and fog shielding the moonlight.

510
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,660
Catch the royal clothes and let go.

511
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:03,090
Fragrance of flowers
flying out of your sleeve.

512
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,080
Young Master, you know I am no scholar.

513
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,130
Reciting poetry to me is as good as
giving lesson to a rock.

514
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,030
A Ming Dynasty Emperor
loved to play and hide here.

515
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,880
But he kept getting discovered
by the handmaidens.

516
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,350
All because he always kept
fragrance pouches in his sleeves.

517
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,130
I think...

518
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,440
the one fitting for a fragrance pouch
is actually the pretty handmaiden.

519
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,180
The Emperor let her catch him.

520
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:34,490
The laws during Ming Dynasty was strict
here in the Forbidden City.

521
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,280
All the eunuchs and handmaidens have
no right to use the royal pathways.

522
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,940
They passed through this tunnel.

523
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:47,300
People stopped using it nowadays.

524
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,250
Then why did you ask me to come here?

525
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,160
To play hide and seek with you?

526
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:59,270
Were you trying to retrace the path
from Qianqing Palace and Imperial Garden?

527
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,560
Yes.

528
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,810
I've asked Li Yu.

529
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,580
That night, no one left Qianqing Palace.

530
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:10,650
But there were over 400 people there,
someone must have got out.

531
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,800
What if someone sneaked out?

532
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,520
And that person took less than an hour
to go back and forth?

533
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:21,000
I've walked this path many times.
The round trip is quick.

534
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,450
But to avoid the patrol?

535
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,420
That's impossible.

536
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:30,000
What if they came from status and
the guards covered it up for them?

537
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,980
Guards are only loyal to His Majesty.

538
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,800
The guards only follow
His Majesty's order.

539
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,170
A mere clansman won't have the power.

540
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,850
I doubt that is always true.

541
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,610
Prince Yi listened to
Imperial Concubine Jia...

542
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,470
and wanted to get me into trouble.

543
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,120
What's that noise?

544
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:50,760
Look.

545
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:00,100
It's beautiful!

546
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,330
Your Majesty, look over there.
The fireworks are brilliant!

547
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:07,480
Empress.

548
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,750
We don't see this view every day.
Join me for the firework.

549
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,790
Yes.

550
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,700
Look over there.

551
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,100
Noble Consort, look.

552
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:33,120
The fireworks rise up in the air
like flowers blooming in the night.

553
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,360
Blooming between clouds and ocean.

554
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:38,310
Such a wondrous view.

555
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:45,110
Consort Chun, enjoy the firework.

556
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,620
[Sister, I want another one!]

557
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,580
-[Sister, give me one.]
-[No chance!]

558
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,950
[Sister, one more.]

559
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:18,950
All right.

560
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,990
Here, you can have one.

561
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,520
So pretty.

562
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:24,960
Yes.

563
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:31,040
Sister, what's wrong?

564
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,040
The fireworks are so beautiful.

565
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:43,780
Over there.

566
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,400
Hey, where did you go earlier?

567
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,760
I went to Dongci Hall
to take inventory of the gifts.

568
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,970
But that's...

569
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:55,000
Look at that one. It's like a goldfish.

570
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,970
So pretty.

571
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,820
Why are you here too?

572
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,920
I told you to carry on with the inventory.

573
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,520
Sister Ming Yu, I want to see
the fireworks too.

574
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,290
Get back to your work.

575
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:11,240
If anything goes wrong,
I will have your head for it.

576
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,540
What?

577
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,360
You get to slack off and
she has to go the work?

578
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,300
Now I see why everyone likes
Wei Ying Luo and not you.

579
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:27,860
Ying Luo, Ying Luo.
Even you won't stop bringing up her name.

580
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,360
I don't ever want to talk to you again.

581
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:35,950
So pretty.

582
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:40,350
[Where's Sister Nalan?]

583
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:02,160
So pretty.

584
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,040
Look at that one.

585
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,070
So pretty.

586
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,730
Look over there.

587
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,270
I told you to watch Dongci Hall
but you sneaked out to see fireworks.

588
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:28,720
Now, what are we supposed
to tell His Majesty?

589
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,490
I didn't know this would happen either.

590
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,280
You...

591
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,700
What happened?

592
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,530
Why are you standing up for her?

593
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,000
See for yourself.

594
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:51,770
Hitting Zhen Zhu won't bring
the Buddhist stone back.

595
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,690
You are not getting away from this either.

596
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,230
Her Majesty ordered you
to take the inventory.

597
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:00,760
I thought you took that job from me.

598
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,280
You were nowhere to be found.

599
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:08,530
Don't you push the blame to me.

600
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:10,020
Not a chance!
