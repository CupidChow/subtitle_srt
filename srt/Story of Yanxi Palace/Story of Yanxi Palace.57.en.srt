1
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,180
I finally promised her

2
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,350
that I would regard you as my own son

3
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,979
and raise you with utmost devotion to be a talented person

4
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,340
before she could close her eyes.

5
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,940
Empress Dowager,

6
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,280
are you telling the truth?

7
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:15,500
Emperor, people say it's easier to be born than to be raised.

8
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,660
Although I'm not your biological mother,

9
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,940
I raised you for many years

10
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,040
and took very good care of you.

11
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,260
Please think carefully.

12
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,100
All these years,

13
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,700
have I ever neglected you?

14
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:38,100
I’ve been treating you like the apple of my eye.

15
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:42,900
Who gave you the right to come here today and interrogate me?

16
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,980
Empress Dowager, you are right.

17
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,260
I was too reckless.

18
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,240
Please forgive me.

19
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:02,900
Emperor,

20
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,620
if Madam Wenshu wrote the letter herself,

21
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,900
why didn’t she mention anything during the past 10 years?

22
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,100
This must be fake.

23
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:18,620
It must be a way to estrange us.

24
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,260
Whoever did this must know that you are filial.

25
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,900
Upon reading the letter, you would definitely be furious!

26
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,900
Empress Dowager.

27
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,020
I will investigate this.

28
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,980
It’s my fault that I agitate you today.

29
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,380
I will seek your forgiveness on another day,

30
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,700
Empress Dowager.

31
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,070
I'm taking my leave now.

32
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,300
Emperor!

33
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:45,700
Emperor!

34
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:48,980
Empress Dowager!

35
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,060
It’s over!

36
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,550
It’s all falling apart now!

37
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,380
Empress Dowager, please forgive me!

38
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,460
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

39
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,140
But what you just said

40
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,880
was all so honest and sincere.

41
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,100
His Majesty

42
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,160
definitely won't hold any animosity toward you

43
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,029
just because his real mother is someone else.

44
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,740
Based on the letter alone,

45
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,820
he wouldn’t look so pale.

46
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,820
I'm worried that there are more

47
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,180
to the contents of that letter.

48
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,680
Greetings, Your Majesty.

49
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,940
Your Majesty, what happened?

50
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,100
Zhen'er, leave us.

51
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:56,740
Yes.

52
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,740
Your Majesty. Husband and wife complete each other.

53
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,380
If you have any difficulties,

54
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,460
please tell me.

55
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,880
I’d love to share the burden with you.

56
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,320
About this matter,

57
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,100
I

58
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,740
don't know who to tell

59
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,060
and how to tell.

60
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,659
Your Majesty, regardless of what you want to say,

61
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:48,380
I will be here to keep your company.

62
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,860
This matter is related to my origin.

63
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,420
I am

64
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,600
so confused right now.

65
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,980
I don’t know who I can trust.

66
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,790
Empress Dowager really said that?

67
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,620
Empress,

68
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,900
do you have something to say?

69
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,180
In your heart, the Empress Dowager is a loving mother to you.

70
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,180
I don't want to make any malicious comments on her.

71
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,670
But I really want to hear the truth.

72
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,560
Your Majesty, think about it.

73
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,800
Although the Niohuru clan is a renowned family,

74
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,680
the Empress Dowager is not from a direct blood line.

75
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,740
Her father was just a fourth-rank military official.

76
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,340
There were no any distinguished and powerful people in her clan.

77
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:08,580
Empress,

78
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,800
what are you trying to say?

79
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,540
When the Empress Dowager first entered the Prince Yong’s Mansion,

80
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,180
she was just a princess concubine.

81
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,220
Above her were the Primary Consort and Secondary Consorts.

82
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,020
especially During the forty-third year of Kangxi

83
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,580
when Empress Xiaojingxian lost her son,

84
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,020
she had no child to become the Crown Prince.

85
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,020
If the late Emperor really wanted to find

86
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,580
a noble mother for you,

87
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,360
why would he choose the Lady of the Niohuru clan?

88
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,380
Empress Dowager said

89
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,180
that I was entrusted to her by Lady Qian.

90
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,300
Your Majesty.

91
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,620
At the time in the Prince Yong’s Mansion,

92
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,260
only Secondary Consort Lady Li gave birth to a son.

93
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,180
The Primary Consort, other secondary consorts and princess concubines

94
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,909
were extremely jealous of her.

95
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,820
If Concubine Qian was really too weak

96
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,140
to raise a child,

97
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,940
would that cause a nasty fight among all the wives over the child?

98
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,780
Yet Empress Dowager rose above others

99
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,180
and sprang up to be the mother of the Emperor.

100
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:10,020
For all these years, no one’s ever queried about this.

101
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,740
I find this unimaginable.

102
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,300
Perhaps

103
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,830
there was no fighting over the child and no child entrusting at all.

104
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:25,430
Instead, it was only a replay of the old story of substituting a raccoon for the Crown Prince.

105
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,539
Maybe,

106
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,860
Madam Wenshu was right.

107
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,190
The truth should be that

108
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:44,950
the Lady of the Niohuru clan killed the mother

109
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,940
and took the child!

110
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,500
Is Imperial Concubine Shu still bullying you?

111
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,140
Consort Ling is not favored now,

112
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,540
but she stays with Empress Dowager every day.

113
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,070
Who would dare to bully her?

114
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:07,600
But I’m afraid Palace of Longevity and Peace is no longer in peace either.

115
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,900
Don’t let Consort Ling stay too close

116
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,180
to Empress Dowager,

117
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,260
or she will get into trouble.

118
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,540
Why?

119
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,980
Is it confidential

120
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,510
so you can't tell me?

121
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,860
Consider that I’ve never asked.

122
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,220
It's not that.

123
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,500
It's regarding His Majesty's origin.

124
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,760
You will be in danger if you know about it.

125
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,580
But Consort Ling is attached to Empress Dowager.

126
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,980
She will find out eventually.

127
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,420
I will tell you everything

128
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,880
so that she can plan early.

129
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,220
His Majesty suspects that

130
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,300
Empress Dowager was the mastermind behind the death of Lady Qian.

131
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,460
Hence, Hailancha asked me to tell you

132
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,140
not to go to Palace of Longevity and Peace anymore

133
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,600
or you will be implicated.

134
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,280
Your Highness,

135
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,940
Imperial Bodyguard Suolun is right.

136
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,100
I can feel that the wind direction in the Forbidden City

137
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,160
is about to change.

138
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,790
We should shift the helm immediately!

139
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,380
Your Majesty.

140
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,060
I’ve interrogated the people who once served at the Prince Yong's mansion.

141
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,060
Some could still recall the previous Concubine Qian.

142
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,720
She indeed came from Jiaxing.

143
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,820
She was sold into the mansion at nine years old.

144
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,860
When she was sixteen years old, the Prince Yong contracted an infectious disease,

145
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,720
she meticulously tended to him and received grace.

146
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,180
Does she

147
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,470
still have a family?

148
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,020
Hailancha?

149
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,740
Qian Zhengyuan is her older brother.

150
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,420
Qian Zhengyuan?

151
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,140
Yes.

152
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,020
It’s the Assistant Minister of Rites

153
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,580
who presented you the "Spring Sunshine" painting.

154
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,580
The Qian family was poor. Fearing that their daughter would starve to death,

155
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,900
they placed her under the care of a relative.

156
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,860
But there happened to be a major drought in that year. She was sold.

157
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,940
Madam Qian searched for miles to find her daughter.

158
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,140
She spent many years

159
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,500
before she found her at the Prince Yong’s Mansion.

160
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,340
But by that time, her daughter had already become a concubine

161
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,870
and couldn't be taken away.

162
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:32,060
Qian Zhengyuan took the Imperial examination later.

163
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,260
That's how the Qian family got wealthy.

164
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,540
Li Yu!

165
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,270
Spring Sunshine Painting!

166
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,950
Spring Sunshine Painting!

167
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,060
Qian Zhengyuan was using this painting

168
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,340
to remind me that

169
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,910
the one I should be thankful for

170
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,340
is not the Lady of Niohuru.

171
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,860
Deliver the Imperial decree

172
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,820
to summon Qian Zhengyuan.

173
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,860
I must clarify this.

174
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,060
Empress Dowager,

175
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,040
you have to come up with a solution

176
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,740
in case it’s too late!

177
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,500
If His Majesty meets Assistant Minister Qian,

178
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,940
all the years of your hard work will go in vain.

179
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,740
Empress Dowager? Empress Dowager!

180
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:15,740
Empress Dowager, are you alright?

181
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,540
Servants!

182
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,100
Where's Qian Zhengyuan?

183
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,300
Why isn't he here yet?

184
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,740
Your Majesty,

185
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,940
we have already sent someone to get him.

186
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,470
Please wait a while longer.

187
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:35,900
Your Majesty!

188
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:37,740
Your Majesty!

189
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,620
Imperial Bodyguard Feima is here to report that

190
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:42,300
Assistant Minister Qian fell off his horse by accident.

191
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,300
He fractured his skull

192
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,100
and died!

193
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,060
Empress Dowager.

194
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,740
The Imperial Doctor said that

195
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:00,820
it was an attack caused by something unpleasant and anxiety.

196
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,580
He asked you to keep calm and take good rest.

197
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,620
I'm fine.

198
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,540
It just feels like a heavy rock is pressing on my heart,

199
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,860
making me short of breath.

200
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,380
Have you heard from the Emperor?

201
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,820
I have.

202
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,940
His Majesty is busy right now in the Imperial court.

203
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,740
When he's free, he will definitely visit you.

204
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,340
In the past,

205
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,300
even when I just had a mild cough,

206
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,940
he would immediately set aside his task and rush here.

207
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,940
And now, I’m really sick,

208
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,580
yet he doesn't care anymore.

209
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,300
Empress Dowager, you are mistaken.

210
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,500
His Majesty is having a meeting with the military minsters at West Warmth Chamber.

211
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,100
He is too busy to go anywhere.

212
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,060
But after hearing that you are sick,

213
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,660
His Majesty is very worried.

214
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,790
So, he asked me to come here immediately to serve you.

215
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,020
Let me.

216
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,180
Empress Dowager,

217
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,180
good medicine is bitter but effective.

218
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,580
Please take it regularly

219
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,940
in order to get well soon.

220
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,140
Empress.

221
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:21,660
It was you who delivered that letter to His Majesty, right?

222
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,140
Empress Dowager,

223
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,540
Prince He was the one who delivered the letter.

224
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,860
Elderly Concubine Yu was the one who hid the letter.

225
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,940
I wouldn’t dare to do those things.

226
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,660
I finally understand now.

227
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,750
What do you understand?

228
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,660
You’ve been waiting patiently

229
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,640
for an opportunity

230
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,780
to take revenge for your father.

231
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,580
Lady Hoifa-Nara,

232
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,700
I have really underestimated you.

233
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,140
Empress Dowager,

234
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,700
oversensitivity is not good for recovery.

235
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,670
Don't think too much. And please take this medicine.

236
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:11,060
Imperial Doctor said that your central energy lacks harmonization.

237
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:14,380
I think you got sick

238
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,900
because you are agitated and upset.

239
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,740
I'll ask the Royal Hospital to diagnose again.

240
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,220
In case they made a mistake and caused any delay in treatment.

241
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,060
Get lost!

242
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,510
Oh, I almost forgot something.

243
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,420
Your nephew was prosecuted for

244
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,780
participating in the corruption of food relief.

245
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,510
He's being held in custody now.

246
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,660
Because the corruption amount is huge,

247
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,390
he will probably be sentenced.

248
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,500
Your elder brother's wife rushed into the palace

249
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,460
and is kneeling outside the Gate of Divine Prowess.

250
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:49,860
His Majesty said Empress Dowager knows the principles of right and wrong.

251
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,060
Knowing that her relative has committed a crime,

252
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,740
she was the first one

253
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,670
to ask for a death sentence.

254
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,300
Not going after your sister-in-law’s negligence in disciplining

255
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,380
is already a great leniency.

256
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,710
Even if she kneels forever,

257
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,940
her son will still be beheaded.

258
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,579
You think...

259
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:14,220
You think I insisted on killing your father

260
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,619
because I wanted to protect my nephew?

261
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,180
Didn’t you?

262
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,099
Do you think he was the only one

263
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:28,180
who took advantage of the food relief?

264
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,100
It was easy for His Majesty to kill him,

265
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:37,820
but could he be able to kill all the Imperial relatives involved with the crime?

266
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,700
He couldn’t!

267
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,780
Neither could you!

268
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,790
The one whom I protected

269
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,820
was the Emperor

270
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,340
but nobody else!

271
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:53,180
What I protected was the country of the Great Qing.

272
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,180
The person who is truly resentful

273
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,020
is you

274
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,780
Empress Dowager, thank you for your consideration!

275
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:07,300
Starting from today, you don't need to worry anymore.

276
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,100
How dare you?

277
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,150
Why wouldn't I dare?

278
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,700
I can alienate you and His Majesty. I can make him hate you

279
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,030
and never see you again.

280
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,220
You won't success!

281
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,260
It was me who raised the Emperor!

282
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:27,240
It was me who taught him the foundation of doing.

283
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:30,020
It was me who taught him to be humane.

284
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:34,300
No one can estrange our relationship.

285
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,700
Not even you!

286
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,060
You are wrong!

287
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,660
His Majesty is the type of person

288
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,220
who has a clear-cut stand on what to love and what to hate.

289
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,620
He now thinks that you killed his birth mother,

290
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:47,180
and deceived him for years by playing a loving mother in disguise.

291
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,380
Will he forgive you?

292
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,500
His Majesty

293
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,860
will never believe you!

294
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,860
His Majesty didn't believe in the first place.

295
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:00,660
But then Lord Qian Zhengyuan fell from his horse and died.

296
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,860
Who do you think he will suspect?

297
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,580
Evil woman!

298
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,780
You did that!

299
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,870
Empress Dowager, don't worry.

300
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,420
His Majesty will not kill you,

301
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,340
but neither will he forgive you!

302
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,260
From now on,

303
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,860
you can continue to be a noble and lofty Empress Dowager,

304
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,190
just like the Buddha in the Hall of Flower,

305
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,620
only an elegant display.

306
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,300
Enjoy the rest of your life.

307
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,140
In the future,

308
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:35,020
you will spend your time in repentance.

309
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,500
You…!

310
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,940
Empress Dowager! Empress Dowager!

311
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,660
Empress Dowager!

312
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,020
Empress Dowager!

313
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,260
Consort Ling,

314
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,460
your last backer

315
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,380
has collapsed right in front of you.

316
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,040
What will you do in the future?

317
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,540
Empress Dowager!

318
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,740
Get her on bed now!

319
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,860
Call for Imperial Doctor!

320
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:03,300
Yes.

321
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,740
His Majesty hates the Empress Dowager now.

322
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,740
But after all, they have a steady bond

323
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,540
since they’ve been mother and son for years.

324
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:32,300
In the future, if they rebuild their relationship,

325
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,630
the effort you take today will be useless.

326
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:35,800
Yuan Chunwang,

327
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:36,940
what do you think?

328
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,320
Your Highness,

329
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,900
I heard

330
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:46,180
that Director Zhang had a son who died young.

331
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,660
But his son left him behind

332
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,190
an extremely adorable grandchild

333
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,900
who’s precious to the entire family!

334
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,510
Director Zhang,

335
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,390
how's the Empress Dowager?

336
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,560
Empress Dowager has facial paralysis and her teeth are clenched.

337
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,500
Her right hand twitches.

338
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,060
I’m afraid that

339
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,420
her meridians are blocked.

340
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,750
What do you mean by that?

341
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,790
It's a minor stroke.

342
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,020
Is it serious?

343
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:37,220
When Vice Minister Qi of the Ministry of Rites suffered from paralysis,

344
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,780
he couldn’t even swallow soup.

345
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,710
Compared to him,

346
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,100
Empress Dowager's condition is milder.

347
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,580
But I need to prescribe a medicine to stimulate the circulation of the blood to relax the muscles and joints,

348
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,940
as well as calm her emotion and dredge her meridian passage.

349
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,400
This may heal her illness.

350
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:53,980
Consort Ling,

351
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,580
what is Empress Dowager trying to say?

352
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,580
With her condition,

353
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,240
she should avoid mood swings.

354
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,060
Remember

355
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,340
not to make her angry again.

356
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,030
Director Zhang,

357
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,800
I will keep your words in mind.

358
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,510
Please go and prescribe the medicine now.

359
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,380
Yes.

360
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:14,940
Director, this way please.

361
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,500
Alright.

362
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,020
Empress Dowager doesn't trust him.

363
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,300
Aunt Liu.

364
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,420
Invite Imperial doctor Ye here.

365
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,550
Imperial doctor Ye?

366
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:34,540
Director Zhang has been practicing medicine for years and he's upright too.

367
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,670
Why doesn't you trust Director Zhang?

368
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,260
Just in case.

369
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:40,860
Go now.

370
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,020
Wait!

371
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,100
Empress Dowager is agitated.

372
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,760
We don't need so many to serve.

373
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,700
You stay.

374
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,380
The rest of you may leave.

375
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,060
Follow me.

376
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,140
Two units of milk vetch root.

377
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,160
Is there a problem?

378
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,540
No problem.

379
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,100
But

380
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,860
this prescription

381
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:11,100
doesn't aim to cure, just not to make any mistakes.

382
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,740
If Empress Dowager follows this prescription,

383
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:16,000
I don't think she has a chance to recover.

384
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:19,340
Doesn't aim to cure, just not to make any mistakes.

385
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,260
It then means that

386
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,320
Director Zhang indeed can't be trusted.

387
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,780
There has long been a saying here in the capital

388
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,940
that the documents from the Imperial Academy and the prescriptions from the Imperial Hospital

389
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,070
are all just sparkling on the outside.

390
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,860
Empress Dowager is of such noble status.

391
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,780
Who dares to use any fierce medicine?

392
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,220
They can only slowly stabilize it.

393
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,020
Moreover,

394
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,340
if anyone investigates this prescription,

395
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:40,940
look,

396
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,100
all the medicines here are good materials,

397
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,030
it won’t raise any question at all!

398
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:46,860
Doctor Ye,

399
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,990
I won't make it hard for you.

400
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,620
If you were to prescribe,

401
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,160
how would you do it?

402
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,160
Your Highness,

403
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,460
have you forgotten?

404
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,320
I'm currently under suspension.

405
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,310
I'm not an Imperial Doctor now.

406
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,200
I’m just an ordinary citizen.

407
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,880
I brought you trouble.

408
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,940
Actually, I couldn’t wait for His Majesty to kick me out of the palace,

409
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,220
so I can practice medicine

410
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,480
in the civilian world.

411
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,700
Although the symptoms of Empress Dowager

412
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,460
suggest a stagnation in the energy flow in her liver meridian,

413
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:18,420
there are sign of deficiency in her heart yin and blockage in blood flow,

414
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,080
and thus she’s unable to talk.

415
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,420
which shows that there is accumulation and clog of phlegm.

416
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,540
I'll prescribe two medicines.

417
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,900
One can soothe her liver and nourish her blood.

418
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,620
The other one

419
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,480
can remove the stroke and sputum,

420
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,420
so that she can talk.

421
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:33,620
Oh, right.

422
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,460
Empress Dowager's stomach is very weak,

423
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:39,190
the medicine must be taken together with congee.

424
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,470
Okay, Doctor Ye.

425
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,620
Thank you!

426
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,940
I'll go prescribe the medicine then.

427
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,420
Doctor Ye, thank you!

428
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:47,740
Don’t mention it!

429
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,940
Your Highness Consort Ling,

430
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,340
based on our current situation,

431
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,460
Palace of Longevity and Peace won't be able to protect you anymore.

432
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,940
Leave while you still can,

433
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,340
in case you are affected.

434
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,180
His Majesty...

435
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,900
His Majesty

436
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,270
doesn't like me anyway.

437
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,020
What's there to be afraid of?

438
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,710
Moreover, Empress Dowager once protected me

439
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,260
from getting humiliated by others.

440
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,320
If I can’t leave now

441
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,740
and betray Empress Dowager.

442
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:25,820
Aunt Liu,

443
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,960
since I've boarded this boat,

444
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,960
I don't plan to disembark.

445
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,030
As long as Empress Dowager is fine,

446
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,380
the boat won’t capsize.

447
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,540
Empress Dowager,

448
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,460
Empress has planned this beforehand.

449
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,780
She is determined to take you down.

450
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,140
To cope with the situation,

451
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,940
could you please tell me what happened in the past?

452
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,240
Your Highness,

453
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:30,000
Noble Lady Qing has been waiting for you for a long time.

454
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,830
Noble Lady Qing, what brings you here?

455
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,720
Greetings, Your Highness Consort Ling.

456
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:48,780
Sit.

457
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,100
Your Highness Consort Ling,

458
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,460
I heard that Empress Dowager is gravely ill.

459
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,060
So, I brought a prescription

460
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,420
that was once taken by my grandfather when he had a stroke.

461
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,820
It's very effective in calming one's mind.

462
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,260
This is called "amber enveloping the dragon" pill.

463
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:07,780
It can remove the stroke, dissolve the sputum, calm the spirit and mind.

464
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,980
Please give it to the Empress Dowager on my behalf.

465
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,180
I can't stay long.

466
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,440
I'll take my leave now.

467
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:20,780
Wait!

468
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,020
Why did you do this?

469
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,780
Your Highness Consort Ling,

470
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:31,040
my father is a subordinate of Lord Nalan.

471
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:34,660
I have no choice but to follow Imperial Concubine Shu.

472
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,140
But I do know

473
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,820
what’s right and wrong.

474
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,420
No matter how big Empress Dowager’s mistake is,

475
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,780
she still has raised and cared for His Majesty.

476
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,900
Once His Majesty realizes this in the future,

477
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,300
he surely will regret it.

478
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,820
I'm offering this prescription to Empress Dowager now

479
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,550
just to create some good karma.

480
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:53,980
If in the future…

481
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,040
I can leave myself an alternate path.

482
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,780
Since you want to create good karma,

483
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,680
why don’t you personally deliver it?

484
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,300
It's easy to add a flower onto a brocade,

485
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,740
but it's hard to deliver charcoal during the snow.

486
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:14,540
But delivering charcoal must also be done in time.

487
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,060
Empress Dowager already has you

488
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,900
by her side and care for her.

489
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:21,620
One false step is enough to make a great difference

490
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,760
Since that's the case,

491
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:26,180
I’d rather give you the prescription.

492
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:28,340
As long as you can remember my kindness,

493
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,900
I'm already contented

494
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,630
Noble Lady Qing.

495
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:37,350
never thought that even though you're the quietest one,

496
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:40,020
you are smarter than everyone else.

497
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,180
Not smart,

498
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,500
but timid.

499
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,420
A person like me,

500
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:49,980
when aggrieved,

501
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,110
I can only endure everything on my own.

502
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,720
When I see someone being bullied,

503
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,270
I don't even dare say a word.

504
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,400
It's not that I don't want to imitate you.

505
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,180
It's just that I have parents and siblings.

506
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:07,110
My whole clan has one hundred and thirty-two people.

507
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,500
For their lives,

508
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,700
I can only move with the flow.

509
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,560
But this doesn't mean that I'm heartless

510
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,780
or not righteous.

511
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,020
What I can do is to

512
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,700
offer a small help

513
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,940
within my limited power.

514
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,600
Your Highness,

515
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:39,460
the Empress won't let the Empress Dowager off.

516
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,580
Neither will she let you off.

517
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,400
Please be careful.

518
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,700
What if you have a chance to be promoted?

519
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:56,100
In terms of beauty, scheming, and tricks,

520
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,140
I'm completely inferior to the others.

521
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,590
How can I compete for His Majesty's favor?

522
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,030
Unless you have my assistance!

523
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,260
Noble Lady Qing,

524
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,220
if you want to protect your family,

525
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,750
you must have the strength.

526
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,830
Rather than relying on someone powerful,

527
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,630
why not become the powerful one yourself?

528
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,620
Her Highness Consort Ling said

529
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,300
she has already had this prescription checked by Doctor Ye.

530
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,360
He gave permission

531
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,220
that it can be given to Empress Dowager.

532
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,820
Please thank Her Highness Consort Ling for me.

533
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,100
Your Majesty,

534
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,140
a message came from Palace of Longevity and Peace,

535
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:04,300
saying that Empress Dowager is unconscious and keeps having seizures.

536
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,160
She can't even take a sip of water.

537
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,740
Should you...

538
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,550
Respectfully greeting Your Majesty.

539
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,000
Where is Empress Dowager!

540
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,480
Greetings, Your Majesty!

541
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,900
I have some questions to ask Empress Dowager.

542
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,900
Empress Dowager told me that she knows why you're here.

543
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:52,030
Once you open this book, you'll understand everything.

544
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,230
This is just storytelling.

545
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:58,460
What does Empress Dowager want to tell me exactly?

546
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,020
This is a collection of stories gathered by Ji Yun,

547
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,300
a first-place finisher in his provincial exam

548
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,300
during the twelfth year of Your Majesty's reign.

549
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:09,140
It talked about a beautiful farmer's wife who’s surnamed Guo in Huai Town.

550
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,580
Her husband fled to another town

551
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,060
and left his parents to her care.

552
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,980
She stayed in house, weaving day and night,

553
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,300
just to provide for her in-laws.

554
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,620
However, she was only able to earn so little that it was hardly enough,

555
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,180
and had to seek help from her neighbors.

556
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,580
Everyone wanted to help, but didn't have the resources.

557
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,700
She had a good cry,

558
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,700
then stood by the door to seduce the passersby.

559
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,830
What are you talking about?

560
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,380
Dose that have anything to do with my issue?

561
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,500
Madam Guo sold her body

562
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,980
just to provide for her in-laws,

563
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,140
and used the money she earned to buy a beautiful maiden and keep her home.

564
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,260
When her husband returned,

565
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,100
she said,

566
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,780
“You have safely returned.

567
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,540
I'm returning your parents to you.

568
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,660
And that fair maiden

569
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:45,420
is a second wife I got for you."

570
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,420
And then,

571
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,660
she took a knife and killed herself.

572
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,110
After her death,

573
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,780
the county official convicted her of conducting unchastity.

574
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:58,460
Although she was allowed to be buried in her ancestral tomb, there was no space for husband grave.

575
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,190
Only her in-laws cried for her.

576
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:03,900
They said their son was unfilial and abandoned them.

577
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:06,300
What was wrong with a weak woman

578
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,780
losing her chastity to provide for her in-laws?

579
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,179
The public started discussing

580
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:11,900
what means more, chastity or family bond?

581
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,510
What else did Empress Dowager say?

582
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,380
Your Majesty.

583
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:37,260
Back to the year when Shanxi had a crippling drought,

584
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,659
Madam Qian accompanied Emperor Yongzheng on a private tour.

585
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:41,940
Due to the battle for the throne, they met with danger many times.

586
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,300
Emperor Yongzheng was injured by an arrow

587
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,780
after having been separated from the guards.

588
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:47,540
In order to evade the assassins, he went deep into the mountains.

589
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,060
But misfortune did not come alone.

590
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:51,420
He met bandits hidden in Mount Taihang.

591
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:54,060
Madam Qian hid Emperor Yongzheng in a farm house

592
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,300
and put on his clothes

593
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,900
to lure away the bandits who had chased after them.

594
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:01,710
What did you say?

595
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:03,540
Some said that

596
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,500
Madam Qian was captured by the bandits.

597
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,580
And others said

598
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,030
she threw herself off of the mountain.

599
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,900
But either Madam Qian was actually captured by the bandits,

600
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,940
or killed herself to preserve her chastity.

601
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,700
Her purpose was to save Emperor Yongzheng.

602
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,830
She was loyal, devoted and admirable!

603
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,740
But if the word spread,

604
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,780
Madam Qian would be like the Guo clanswoman.

605
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,140
She did an obvious good deed,

606
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:26,140
yet would end up suffering from the reproof of the world.

607
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:29,580
Your Majesty would also likely be subjected to absurd comments.

608
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:32,780
This is why Empress Dowager has kept the secret all along.

609
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,110
If you don't believe it,

610
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,500
Emperor Yongzheng had a close servant,

611
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:39,020
who found Emperor Yongzheng first.

612
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,100
Now he's retired to his hometown,

613
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,360
and lives in Jiaozhou.

614
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,940
Empress Dowager has already asked people to invited him in confidence.

615
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,940
He should arrive by tomorrow.

616
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:55,060
If it’s the truth,

617
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:59,460
I will go to Palace of Longevity and Peace personally

618
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:02,390
and kneel for forgiveness from the Empress Dowager.

619
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:23,990
Noble Lady Qing.

620
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,820
Thank you for doing this!

621
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,390
My heart's jumping so fast.

622
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,500
Consort Ling,

623
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,560
why didn't you tell His Majesty personally?

624
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,900
His Majesty isn't fond of seeing me.

625
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,380
I don't want to implicate Empress Dowager.

626
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,350
But do you really think those words

627
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,020
will work on His Majesty?

628
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,500
You must be tired!

629
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,140
Who are you?

630
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,220
What are you doing?

631
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,860
Who sent you here?

632
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:03,740
What are you doing? You can't move that!

633
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,740
Don't move it.

634
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,680
Come back! What are you doing?

635
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,260
Who are you? Put that down.

636
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,460
Who said you can move that?

637
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,660
Put them back!

638
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,580
Who sent you here to do it?

639
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,100
Who sent you?

640
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,460
Who the hell are you?

641
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:19,180
Put it back! Put it back!

642
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,220
Stop it!

643
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,100
What are you doing?

644
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,460
Stop it, now!

645
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,500
Stop!

646
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,620
I, Wang Tianyi,

647
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,500
greet Your Majesty.

648
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:29,620
Li Yu.

649
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,380
Your Majesty,

650
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,260
Lord Wang's kneecaps were injured by firearms once

651
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,100
when protecting the late Emperor.

652
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,740
The pain has been relapsing and recurring in his old age.

653
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,470
He really can’t kneel too long.

654
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,470
Grant him a seat.

655
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:49,980
Teacher Wang,

656
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,820
you once taught me riding and archery personally.

657
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:54,980
You are my teacher.

658
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,960
Please give me honest answers

659
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,700
to my questions.

660
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,420
Do you know about

661
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,740
late Emperor went on a private visit of Shanxi

662
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:07,200
together with Madam Qian?

663
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:09,780
Your Majesty, that did happen.

664
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,860
Then when you escorted him back,

665
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:14,060
did the late Emperor return

666
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:14,990
with Madam Qian?

667
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,260
Well…

668
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:22,820
Be honest with me!

669
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,260
Yes.

670
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:30,900
Your Majesty, please don’t get angry!

671
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,540
Your Majesty, please don’t get angry!

672
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,070
Empress Dowager lied to me!

673
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,700
Your Majesty.

674
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,460
Your Majesty.

675
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,460
Teacher Wang,

676
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:03,720
you served the late Emperor for decades.

677
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,100
When I was young,

678
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:11,220
you'd carry me on your back and run around in house.

679
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:15,120
I was mischievous and got reprimanded by the late Emperor.

680
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,960
You would take the scolding and punishments for me.

681
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:23,200
Please, on the account of our bond as teacher and disciple,

682
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,980
don’t let me live in a lie.

683
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,500
Let me ask you,

684
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:34,980
how did Madam Qian really die?

685
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:39,660
Did she really die on Taihang Mountain

686
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,100
or

687
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,860
was she killed by Empress Dowager instead?

688
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:52,740
Your Majesty,

689
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:56,180
Madam Qian lost her chastity

690
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,700
in order to save the late Emperor back then,

691
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,660
and this humiliated the late Emperor thoroughly.

692
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:01,100
She…

693
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,660
She was granted death!

694
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,590
Greetings to Your Majesty.

695
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:18,700
Where is Empress Dowager?

696
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:19,700
Empress Dowager…

697
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:24,480
Empress Dowager took Consort Ling with her and went out of the palace to recuperate.

698
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,110
Noble Lady Qing.

699
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:51,900
Your Majesty.

700
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:58,060
By order of Empress Dowager, I have been waiting here for Your Majesty

701
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,590
to relay a few urgent words.

702
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:02,560
Your Majesty, please clear your surroundings.

703
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,700
What did Empress Dowager say?

704
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,900
Empress Dowager wants me to tell Your Majesty

705
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,700
that during the thirteenth year of the late Emperor's reign,

706
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,700
he only rested one day on his royal birthday.

707
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,740
He never went to Mulan Autumn Hunt and never engaged in hedonistic pleasures.

708
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:25,900
The late Emperor governed with extreme strictness,

709
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,980
all in the pursuit of being a good emperor.

710
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,220
The late Emperor once said

711
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,940
he shouldered the blame of being scheming against his father and pressuring his mother,

712
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:34,020
along with the bad reputation of murdering his elder brothers and slaughtering his younger ones.

713
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,900
It was as though carrying a majestic mountain and going against the wind.

714
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,340
He knew that for an emperor,

715
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:41,580
being proper and right are too important.

716
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:44,020
It's not that he didn't lament losing Madam Qian.

717
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:46,900
He just didn't want Your Majesty to suffer from the shame.

718
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:47,700
That day,

719
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,140
Empress Dowager was ordered

720
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:51,020
to bring poisoned wine to Madam Qian,

721
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,380
who said nothing,

722
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:55,820
only bowed to Empress Dowager three times and sighed as she died.

723
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:57,020
Empress Dowager said

724
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,180
since she received three bows from her,

725
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,780
the great responsibility of raising Your Majesty thus fell on her.

726
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,820
She decided to take care of Your Majesty

727
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,580
for life as a real mother would.

728
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,360
Where is Empress Dowager?

729
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:09,620
I want to see her now.

730
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,220
Empress Dowager said

731
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,740
the Forbidden City isn't quiet.

732
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:16,420
She wants to find a quiet place to nurse her illness.

733
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:18,740
Consort Ling will look after Empress Dowager.

734
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:20,670
Your Majesty, don’t need to worry.

735
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:28,700
Your Majesty!

736
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:08,780
Royal Mother.

737
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,220
I was being unfilial.

738
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:14,020
I have put to shame your kind mothering.

739
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:16,740
I forgot your grace of raising me

740
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:18,310
and I deserve death.

741
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:20,920
Royal Mother, please forgive me!

742
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:28,070
I earnestly invite Royal Mother to return to the palace!

743
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,420
Your Majesty,

744
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:30,750
Empress Dowager states

745
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:32,460
she will move to the Summer Palace to nurse her illness.

746
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:34,820
She will return when she’s fully recovered.

747
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,680
Your Majesty, please return now.

748
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:39,460
Royal Mother.

749
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:41,460
Royal Mother,

750
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:42,460
it's all my fault.

751
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:44,780
I upset you.

752
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:46,700
I made a mistake.

753
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:51,260
For the sake of our years of mother-son bond,

754
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:52,900
roll up your screen

755
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:54,300
and let me see you,

756
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:55,660
please?

757
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:57,900
Your Majesty, please return.
