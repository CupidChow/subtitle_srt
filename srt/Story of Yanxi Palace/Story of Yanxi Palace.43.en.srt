[Story of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 43]

3
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,610
Keep this in mind. From now on,

4
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,120
she's my Noble Lady Wei.

5
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,560
Don't ever address her as that again.

6
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,440
Yes.

7
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,580
Li Yu.

8
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,240
I'm here.

9
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,860
We'll set out for the palace tomorrow.

10
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,110
Hey, Lord Solon.

11
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,900
Did His Majesty get angry?

12
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,800
It's good that His Majesty didn't get mad.

13
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,320
Why are you frowning?

14
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,470
I'm worried.

15
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,329
What are you worried about?

16
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,240
I wonder what Fu Heng will do...

17
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,520
when he finds out about all this.

18
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,760
Your Majesty,

19
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,770
why did you agree to let
Wei Ying Luo enter the palace?

20
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,530
Isn't it very interesting?

21
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,760
She's very discontented with her lot
and keeps acting unruly.

22
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,280
I'm afraid that she'll make trouble.

23
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,980
Noble Consort Chun
has been complacent for too long.

24
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,660
It's time to get her a rival.

25
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,120
Am I right?

26
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,880
Your Majesty,

27
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,930
do you intend to support Wei Ying Luo...

28
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,930
and let her beat Noble Consort Chun?

29
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,620
I've never said that I'd help anyone.

30
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,460
Whether she can obtain His Majesty's
favour and beating Noble Consort Chun,

31
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,520
that depends on her ability.

32
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,770
But aren't you worried that she...

33
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:18,670
My hands have been clean all along.

34
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,410
Noble Consort Chun should be afraid.

35
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,890
You're wise, Your Majesty.

36
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,010
Where do you think
Wei Ying Luo should stay?

37
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,100
In my opinion,

38
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,079
you should let her stay at
the Zhongcui Palace.

39
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,990
It would be very interesting.

40
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,280
That would seem too deliberate.

41
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,750
I'll let her stay at...

42
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,550
the Yanxi Palace instead.

43
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,800
How could Empress Dowager...

44
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,440
make a palace maid a noble lady?

45
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,480
Yu Hu,

46
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,540
don't be disrespectful to Empress Dowager.

47
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,960
Yes.

48
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,560
On Empress Dowager's birthday,

49
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,000
she created a heaven-sent auspicious sign.

50
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,600
When the word gets out,

51
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,519
everyone will praise that
the benevolence of Empress Dowager

52
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,899
has moved God.

53
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,240
Empress Dowager will be happy about it.

54
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,540
Moreover,

55
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,720
she's a servant of the late empress.

56
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,520
It's normal for Empress Dowager...

57
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,630
to try to help her.

58
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,490
Your Highness,

59
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,100
she's just a lowly palace maid.

60
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,610
There's no need to take her seriously.

61
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,600
Even though she became
a noble lady straightaway,

62
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,290
she won't be able to surpass you.

63
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,570
Consort Yu,

64
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,110
I remember

65
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,360
that both of you used to be friends.

66
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,220
As a palace maid,

67
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,420
she always criticised me.

68
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,120
I've had enough of her.

69
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,400
Had it not been for the sake of
the late empress,

70
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,520
I wouldn't have paid attention to her.

71
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,610
Sister, do you mean what you say?

72
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,200
Of course.

73
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,480
Once a palace maid,

74
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,090
always a palace maid.

75
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
If you want to vent your anger,

76
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,920
I've got an idea.

77
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,400
[Zhongcui Palace]

78
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,200
Let's go.

79
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,060
Wei Ying Luo used to frequent
the Yonghe Palace.

80
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,760
She even saved Fifth Prince
from Noble Consort Gao.

81
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,880
Aren't you afraid that...

82
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,670
Consort Yu speaks with a forked tongue?

83
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,030
I don't believe her.

84
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,760
I only believe in human nature.

85
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,180
I don't get it.

86
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,290
Wei Ying Luo has witnessed...

87
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,030
the lowliest and
fragile past of Consort Yu.

88
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,210
If you're Consort Yu,

89
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,420
would you like someone like that?

90
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,110
A successful person...

91
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:43,520
has a hard time meeting the friends
he made when he's poor.

92
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,909
That's what I meant.

93
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,840
You're now successful.

94
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,880
But she's seen your crying.

95
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,650
She could easily hurt your heart.

96
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,690
It's so annoying,

97
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,120
isn't it?

98
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,900
Noble Lady Wei,

99
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,830
this is Yanxi Palace.

100
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,920
From now on,

101
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,630
you'll stay here.

102
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:16,630
[Yanxi Palace]

103
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,530
Noble Lady Wei, please.

104
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,160
Supervisor Wu,

105
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,000
thank you.

106
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,660
You're most welcome, Noble Lady Wei.

107
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:27,290
No, I can't accept it.

108
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,000
It's the rule.

109
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,770
Just take it, Supervisor Wu.

110
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,659
If you need any help in future,

111
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,040
just call for me.

112
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,250
I'll do my best to help you.

113
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,360
Thank you.

114
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,250
I'm taking my leave.

115
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,240
Greetings, Noble Lady Wei!

116
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,640
You may get up.

117
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,000
-Ying Luo!
-Hu Po!

118
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,429
Who said you could address
Noble Lady Wei by that?

119
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:38,030
She's your mistress!

120
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,880
But...

121
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:44,320
we used to serve Her Majesty together.

122
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,620
Noble Lady Wei,

123
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,410
have you forgotten that?

124
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,240
Ming Yu,

125
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,120
I'm tired.

126
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,440
Let's go in and take a rest first.

127
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,840
Other than Hu Po and Zhen Zhu,

128
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,340
the rest of you may leave.

129
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,330
Hu Po, why are you here?

130
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,630
Sister Ming Yu,

131
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,840
we all served at different places
after the late empress passed away.

132
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,760
On the day before yesterday,
Imperial Household Department...

133
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,800
ordered us to serve at the Yanxi Palace.

134
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,600
Sister Ming Yu, finally we're together.

135
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,250
Yes, Sister Ming Yu.

136
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,520
This is a good thing.

137
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,330
Why don't you look happy at all?

138
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,000
This is Yanxi Palace.

139
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,360
Noble Lady Wei is now our mistress.

140
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,430
You offended her openly
by calling her name.

141
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,080
She's being extra lenient...

142
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,080
because she didn't punish you severely.

143
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,540
But you're not repentant.

144
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,710
Noble Lady Wei has just
entered the palace.

145
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:58,000
Of course she should establish
a benevolent reputation.

146
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,920
If she openly punishes a former colleague
from the Changchun Palace,

147
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,080
people will criticize her
for forgetting her past.

148
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,490
Hu Po, don't go too far!

149
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,110
Sister Ming Yu,

150
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,810
in terms of experience,

151
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,680
you have worked here
longer than Wei Ying Luo.

152
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,880
In terms of appearance,

153
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,330
you're a natural beauty.

154
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,270
Isn't it a great pity to be her servant?

155
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,920
If she can be a noble lady, why can't you?

156
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,840
Hu Po,

157
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,760
you know the mistress' temper...

158
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,000
better than me.

159
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,990
I advise you not to make any trouble...

160
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,080
or else...

161
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,680
no one won't be able to save you!

162
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,680
Sister Ming Yu,

163
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,210
I'm speaking the truth.

164
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,650
His Majesty sent her to this Yanxi Palace.

165
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,200
It's the most remote palace.

166
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,920
His Majesty will never visit her.

167
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,840
We don't need to be afraid of her.

168
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,530
Hu Po,

169
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,760
what are you doing?

170
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:56,400
She's a noble lady
who's destined to receive no favour.

171
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,640
I'm not afraid of her.

172
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,840
Why would you?

173
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,470
Now,

174
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,860
everyone is talking about...

175
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:10,000
the auspicious signs
during the birthday celebration.

176
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,800
Empress Dowager was so happy...

177
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,750
that she rewarded me with these gifts.

178
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,220
They're all rare valuables.

179
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,760
Come and take a look.

180
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,850
I don't want to.

181
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,330
That Hu Po...

182
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,270
is evil indeed.

183
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,890
How come I didn't...

184
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,440
find her annoying...

185
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,320
when we're in the Changchun Palace?

186
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,360
Someone deliberately sent her here...

187
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,030
to anger you.

188
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,080
If you really get mad,

189
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,960
you'll fall into her trap.

190
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,150
Hu Po publicly humiliated you...

191
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,960
but you choose to endure it.

192
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,960
Think about it.

193
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,330
Hu Po was a palace maid
from Changchun Palace.

194
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,970
She used to be my equal.

195
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,560
Now that I've become a noble lady.

196
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,040
And she's assigned here to serve me.

197
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,870
She's apparently unwilling to do so.

198
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,870
She witnessed how humble...

199
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,690
I used to be.

200
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,120
Of course she'll shame me
by telling everyone about my past.

201
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,780
-Since you know that...
-But I can't punish her.

202
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:15,890
Why?

203
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,510
She...

204
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,600
used to serve my old mistress.

205
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,310
If I punish her,

206
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,050
I'll be seen as an ingrate.

207
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,690
It's hateful.

208
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,480
The mastermind of all this is so sinister!

209
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:36,750
Hence,

210
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,200
since you know that
she irritates you on purpose,

211
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,170
you shouldn't get mad.

212
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,990
Yanxi Palace is the remotest palace.

213
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,450
It's very hard to see His Majesty here.

214
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,640
Now that Hu Po is here...

215
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,960
thinking of ways to annoy you every day,

216
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,800
what should we do?

217
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,490
Take it easy.

218
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,310
Ying Luo.

219
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:05,170
I feel that you've changed a lot...

220
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,180
upon our return.

221
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,040
You used to...

222
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,840
get mad over matters like this.

223
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,100
This is beautiful!

224
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,640
Ming Yu,

225
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,140
take it.

226
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,710
Ying Luo!

227
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,110
Ming Yu.

228
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,420
Back then,

229
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,940
I could be fearless...

230
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,600
because I was protected by Her Majesty.

231
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,640
Now that Her Majesty is gone,

232
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:38,870
all I can do is to be
careful and cautious.

233
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,440
I'm afraid we'll have a tough time.

234
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:15,730
Sister Hu Po, I dreamed that
I too became a noble lady.

235
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,960
Cut it out. Stop daydreaming.

236
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,320
Just focus on your work.

237
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,310
Hu Po,

238
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,880
go claim our monthly allowance at
the Imperial Household Department.

239
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,360
Sister Ming Yu,

240
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,370
I dare not.

241
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,550
Why?

242
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,680
Our mistress has entered the palace
for quite some time.

243
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,920
But His Majesty hasn't visited her.

244
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,920
There're many rumours
going around in the palace.

245
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,250
They're saying that His Majesty
looks down on our mistress.

246
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,080
He keeps her by his side...

247
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,920
only for the sake of Empress Dowager.

248
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,230
Those working at
the Imperial Household Department...

249
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,800
treat people based on their status.

250
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,720
I advise you not to
embarrass yourself there.

251
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,310
Ming Yu, what are you doing?

252
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,200
I respect you because
you used to serve the late empress.

253
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,840
But times have changed.

254
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,840
You think you can treat me like you did?

255
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,880
I'll go claim it...

256
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,520
Sister Ming Yu, calm down.

257
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,450
Hu Po, stop it.

258
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,510
If you get ridiculed there,

259
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,650
don't blame me for not warning you!

260
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,680
What's wrong?

261
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,100
Endure?

262
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,830
I can't endure it anymore!

263
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,340
You can't endure it anymore?

264
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,520
Of course!

265
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,730
Look at this Yanxi Palace.

266
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,960
It's the most remote one
among all palaces.

267
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,830
His Majesty has never come here.

268
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,560
When we first came here,

269
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,400
there were weeds in every corner.

270
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,880
The east hall is not airtight
and leaks when it rains.

271
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,880
The food sent here every day is cold.

272
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:49,110
And we need to keep asking them
for monthly allowance.

273
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,410
Our life is hard enough.

274
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:55,260
Now even the maids here
dare talk bad about you!

275
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,610
What kind of life is this?

276
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:00,910
If I keep enduring it,
I'll become a coward!

277
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,800
What are you laughing about?

278
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,470
Ming Yu,

279
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,800
you've regained your true spirit!

280
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:14,900
What do you mean?

281
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,480
Noble Consort Chun frightened you
within an inch of your life

282
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,800
You would cower
at the mention of her name.

283
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,730
I felt sad to see you being that way.

284
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,760
Today,

285
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,630
you look braver.

286
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,840
Ying Luo!

287
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,750
I stayed at the Yuanming Garden
for more than two years.

288
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,080
The first thing I learned
is to be patient.

289
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:34,930
However,

290
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,950
one has to be patient so as to
gain a pleasurable future.

291
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:41,680
-Let's go.
-Where are we going?

292
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,570
If it hadn't been for Empress Dowager,

293
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,250
I would've starved to death long ago.

294
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,800
I should go thank her now.

295
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,920
I've met you before, Sister.

296
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,280
You're talking nonsense again.

297
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,680
When did you...

298
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,290
ever meet her?

299
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,750
Although we've never met before,

300
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,170
she looks familiar.

301
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,400
That makes her an old friend of mine.

302
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,160
Today, why can't we act like...

303
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,700
we've reunited after a long time?

304
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,600
In my opinion,

305
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,470
that's not an mischievous lad,

306
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:48,000
but an amorous man.

307
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,250
-What story is this?
-Today...

308
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,740
Empress Dowager
is so happy listening to it.

309
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,480
Greetings, Your Majesty.

310
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,880
What kind of low-class story is that?

311
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,080
How dare you tell it to Empress Dowager.

312
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,840
Look at this outfit of yours.

313
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,460
It's not decent at all.

314
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,090
Don't blame her.

315
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:17,510
I asked her to come
amuse and chat to me

316
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,920
But chatting was boring.

317
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,930
That's why she put on a costume.

318
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,240
She worked hard...

319
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,510
to try to make me laugh.

320
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,960
But it's quite a story.

321
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,480
Emperor, why don't you join us?

322
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,710
How inglorious.

323
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,120
Leave.

324
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,270
Yes!

325
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,240
I'm taking my leave!

326
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,590
Emperor,

327
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,590
it's just a joke.

328
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,650
Don't get mad.

329
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,290
I'm not mad.

330
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,320
I've been staying in the palace
for so many years.

331
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,470
I've come across a lot of
filial and virtuous consorts.

332
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,690
But none of them is
as quick-witted as her.

333
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:12,070
She's able to come up with many ways
to make me happy every day.

334
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,160
She's such a rare person.

335
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,770
Your Majesty.

336
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,580
Empress Dowager.

337
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,750
She tends to take advantage of others.

338
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,080
You'd better not spoil her...

339
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,540
lest...

340
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,990
she becomes arrogant.

341
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:47,990
Yes.

342
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,800
Wait.

[Noble Consort Chun from Zhongcui Palace]

345
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,970
[Shoukang Palace]

346
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,230
Greetings, Your Majesty.

347
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,520
Ying Luo,

348
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,040
you come every day.

349
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,470
But His Majesty keeps ignoring you.

350
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,860
What should we do?

351
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,540
How long have we been coming here?

352
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,990
It's been...

353
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,990
more than a month.

354
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,720
We always run into His Majesty...

355
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,040
but he doesn't talk to you.

356
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,950
More than a month?

357
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:19,240
We're not coming here tomorrow.

358
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,270
Why?

359
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,560
I've caught a cold.

360
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,880
I can't tell a story because
I've lost my voice.

361
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,220
I'll ask for leave from Empress Dowager.

362
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,770
What are you up to?

363
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,040
Your Majesty, please have some tea.

364
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,660
Have you found the answer?

365
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,590
Your Majesty,

366
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,950
what answer?

367
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,760
I did.

368
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,350
I heard that Noble Lady Wei is sick.

369
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,570
Sick?

370
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,330
Did I ask you about her?

371
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,450
It's...

372
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,320
I'm being a blabbermouth.

373
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,940
I'm being a blabbermouth.

374
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,160
I'm going for a walk.

375
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,450
It's so hot!

376
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,850
Noble Lady Wei,

377
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:52,350
how fragile you are.

378
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,130
You can just blow if it's hot.

379
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,710
Hu Po,

380
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,110
you can't talk to me like this.

381
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,460
Noble Lady Wei,

382
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,920
one shouldn't forget where she came from.

383
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,580
When we're serving
at the Changchun Palace,

384
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,270
we helped each other out.

385
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,040
Now that you've become a concubine,

386
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,210
you can't forget that.

387
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,910
You don't like whatever I say.

388
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,400
It's so hard to serve you.

389
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,220
Things are different now.

390
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,560
I'm a noble lady after all.

391
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,760
Your attitude is unacceptable.

392
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,170
You...

393
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,240
Aren't you afraid that
I'll tell Her Majesty about it?

394
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,550
Yes...

395
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,120
You're a noble mistress.

396
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,000
I'm a lowly servant.

397
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,790
Of course I must do as you say.

398
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,840
Since you don't want to drink it,

399
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,880
forget about it!

400
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,670
I'll pour it away at once!

401
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,590
Your Majesty!

402
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,720
Your Majesty!

403
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,360
Greetings, Your Majesty.

404
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,380
Take her away.

405
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,280
Flog her for eighty times...

406
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,440
and send her to the Labour House.

407
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,870
Your Majesty...

408
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,170
It's my fault!

409
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,500
Forgive me!

410
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,520
Your Majesty!

411
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,320
Noble Lady Wei was indeed a palace maid.

412
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,450
But she's now my noble lady.

413
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,130
No servant is allowed to belittle her.

414
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,090
Flog her out there.

415
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,560
And let everyone watch it.

416
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,890
Eunuchs, take her away!

417
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,400
It's my fault!

418
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,840
Your Majesty, please spare me!

419
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,270
Noble Lady Wei...

420
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,270
Please save me!

421
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,920
Noble Lady Wei...

422
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,350
Please save me!

423
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,280
Noble Lady Wei!
Your Majesty, please spare me!

424
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,230
Noble Lady Wei, please save me!

425
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,390
When did you become so cowardly?

426
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,600
How could you tolerate
such an unruly maid?

427
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:40,590
Your Majesty,

428
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,490
she used to serve the late empress.

429
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,060
She was once my colleague.

430
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,760
You were once a servant.

431
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,260
But you're now my noble lady.

432
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,190
You must keep that in mind.

433
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,500
Don't embarrass me.

434
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,240
Yes.

435
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,500
Noble Lady Wei,

436
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,730
congratulations.

437
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,040
Sister Ming Yu, please beg for leniency
from the mistress on Hu Po's behalf.

438
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,240
She knows she's wrong.

439
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,990
She really does!

440
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,120
She offended His Majesty.

441
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,280
Since His Majesty is punishing her
as a way of warning others,

442
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,540
the mistress can't do anything about it.

443
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,440
Ask Hu Po to serve me later.

444
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,690
Let Hu Po serve you?

445
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:52,850
Yes.

446
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,440
Let her attend to me.

447
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,260
But she always slights you.

448
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,770
Can she serve you well?

449
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,220
I want her to slight me.

450
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,080
The more she slights me, the better.

451
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,430
[Yanxi Palace]

452
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,400
Did you all see it?

453
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:12,680
That's the consequence
of slighting the mistress.

454
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,810
Whoever dares offend the mistress...

455
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,280
is digging his own grave.

456
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,630
We dare not do so...

457
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:24,040
We dare not do so...

458
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,260
Have you recovered from the cold?

459
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,090
Greetings, Your Majesty.

460
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,590
Why are you here?

461
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,440
I came to greet Empress Dowager.

462
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,850
She's gone to get changed.

463
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:53,730
I'm waiting for her here.

464
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,480
Whom did you mistake me for?

465
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,400
No one.

466
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,190
Your Majesty,

467
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,510
I heard that...

468
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,880
Empress Dowager has developed
a liking for a book.

469
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,360
She asked Noble Lady Wei to come
and tell her the story every day.

470
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,640
But Noble Lady Wei is sick.

471
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:16,670
I thought Empress Dowager
can't wait to listen to it.

472
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,370
Hence, I memorised the book.

473
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,720
Although they're all love stories
between scholars and beauties.

474
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,510
But they're quite interesting.

475
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,360
I have something to attend to.

476
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,220
I'll leaving.

477
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,350
Your Majesty...

478
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,840
Don't you want to listen to it?

479
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,570
It took me some time
to memorise it, Your Majesty!

480
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,760
Empress Dowager,
what are you laughing about?

481
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,950
I'm laughing...

482
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,560
because there's finally a smart girl...

483
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,570
in our palace.

484
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,440
She's able to attract His Majesty...

485
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,600
without much effort.

486
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,960
Are you talking about
Imperial Concubine Shu?

487
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:10,350
Imperial Concubine Shu?

488
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,050
Imperial Concubine Shu, where did we stop?

489
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,560
Continue with the story.

490
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,960
Is Noble Lady Wei still sick?

491
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,250
Yes.

492
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,840
Ask Ye Tian Shi to treat her.

493
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,310
Yes.

494
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,490
Your Majesty, even if you didn't say it,

495
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,620
Imperial Academy of Medicine would
do their best to treat Noble Lady Wei.

496
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,110
Forget it.

497
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,360
We won't go there.

498
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,000
Let's head back to the Yangxin Hall.

499
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,250
To the Yangxin Hall!

500
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,530
No.

501
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,120
Let's go to the Yanxi Palace.

502
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,090
To the Yanxi Palace!

503
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:59,480
Is it the scent of gardenia?

504
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,390
So it seems.

505
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:07,800
Your Majesty.

506
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,270
Where's Noble Lady Wei?

507
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:13,670
She took the medicine...

508
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,320
and is sleeping upstairs.

509
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,080
Why isn't she sleeping in her room?

510
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,460
Your Majesty,

511
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,070
Noble Lady Wei instructed us
to get some gardenia for the garden.

512
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:27,310
The breeze carries its fragrance.

513
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,720
She couldn't stand the heat.

514
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,970
And she fell asleep...

515
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,370
after watching the moon.

516
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,610
She said it's cooler up there.
And it smells good too.

517
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,890
What a silly person.

518
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,690
No wonder you caught a cold.

519
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:29,850
Who allowed you to sleep here?

520
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,450
Your Majesty?

521
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,370
Are you surprised to see me?

522
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,280
I...

523
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,280
Your Majesty, this is not appropriate.

524
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,360
Anything I do...

525
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,610
is appropriate.

526
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,900
You all may leave now.

527
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:17,290
Leave.

528
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:21,090
Ming Yu,

529
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,470
what are you waiting for?

530
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,450
Let's go.

531
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,320
Stop looking...

532
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,820
Ming Yu?

533
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,000
Ming Yu!

534
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:10,880
Go patrol somewhere else.

535
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,750
Give it to me.

536
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:21,930
Why are you here all alone?

537
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,920
What happened?

538
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,440
I think I've made a mistake.

539
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,040
In this world, everyone makes mistakes.

540
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,080
No.

541
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,400
You don't get it!

542
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,710
If I don't get it,

543
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,440
you can explain it to me.

544
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,500
If I hadn't said it,

545
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,240
Ying Luo would've been able
to leave the palace...

546
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,170
when she's twenty-five years old.

547
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,600
She could lead a happy life...

548
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,830
wherever she went.

549
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,020
I've ruined her happiness.

550
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,280
She'll forever stuck in
the Forbidden City because of me.

551
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,630
It's my fault.

552
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,660
Ming Yu,

553
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,160
you didn't mean it.

554
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,240
No,

555
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,530
I did it on purpose.

556
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,020
Noble Consort Chun kept bullying me.

557
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,740
I couldn't accept it...

558
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,240
and wanted to seek justice.

559
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,280
That's why I dragged Ying Luo into it.

560
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,320
I'm very despicable.

561
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,850
I'm a vicious person!

562
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,750
Ming Yu,

563
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,360
you're absolutely not that kind of person!

564
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,880
Stop blaming yourself!

565
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,360
I don't know what
Noble Consort Chun did...

566
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:47,170
to drive you to the edge.

567
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,500
But,

568
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,820
from now on,

569
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,810
if you ever need my help,

570
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,250
I'll do my best for sure.

571
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,610
Really?

572
00:33:58,730 --> 00:33:59,600
No.

573
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,800
I'd better not bother you.

574
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,360
I'll keep my word.

575
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,160
If you're ever in trouble,

576
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,390
just come and see me.

577
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,050
Hailan Cha,

578
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,300
thank you.

579
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,360
You're such a good person.

580
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,360
I'll be very grateful to you...

581
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,159
all my life.

582
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:26,920
Congratulations, Noble Lady Wei...

583
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,440
Noble Lady Wei, after His Majesty left,

584
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,000
Her Majesty rewarded you with many gifts.

585
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,280
Noble Consort Chun sent some afterwards.

586
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,270
Noble Lady Wei, you've finally succeeded.

587
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,520
You all may leave now.

588
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,630
Ying Luo, are you happy?

589
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,240
I'm one step closer to my goal.

590
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,750
Of course I'm happy.

591
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,480
You're not the only one working hard.

592
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,590
I'll work hard too.

593
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,420
Ming Yu,

594
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:12,350
what have you done?

595
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,700
I'll be strong enough...

596
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,110
to be your backer.

597
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,120
As long as I can help you,

598
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,090
I'm willing to do anything.

599
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,160
You're so great.

600
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,280
You said you'd gain His Majesty's favour.

601
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,630
Now you've made it.

602
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,440
Did I say anything wrong?

603
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,490
You think...

604
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:36,260
I've earned His Majesty's favour
by having served him last night?

605
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,790
-But...
-His Majesty...

606
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,960
sees me merely as his new toy.

607
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,070
He'll forget me soon...

608
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,890
unless he holds me close to his heart.

609
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,240
We have a long way to go...

610
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,980
before I can beat Noble Consort Chun.

611
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:57,130
Your Majesty,

612
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,030
Wei Ying Luo has been attending to
His Majesty for three consecutive nights.

613
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:02,410
And she's now acting high and mighty.

614
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,880
Look,

615
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,300
what time is it now?

616
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,310
She hasn't come to greet you.

617
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,570
Perhaps...

618
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,990
something came up.

619
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,160
I don't think so.

620
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,960
It's obvious that she's become arrogant
from being favoured.

621
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,760
She was a palace maid after all.

622
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:19,840
How unruly she is.

623
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,260
Your Majesty,

624
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:26,760
I think you should send
a madam there to lecture her.

625
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:28,370
Imperial Concubine Shu,

626
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,680
Her Majesty can favour whoever he wants.

627
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:34,130
As his consorts, we can't do anything...

628
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,790
but obey him.

629
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,570
If you're the one whom
His Majesty favoured...

630
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,570
and I sent someone to lecture you,

631
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,680
what would that make me?

632
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,070
Your Majesty,

633
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,930
I don't quite agree with you.

634
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,080
Among the four virtues,

635
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,670
morality comes first.

636
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:56,310
She's so disrespectful and unruly.

637
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,560
If she remains by His Majesty's side,

638
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,320
she'll make trouble sooner or later.

639
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,480
Your Majesty, you mustn't be lenient...

640
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,440
in managing the six palaces.

641
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,040
Her Majesty is benevolent.

642
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,720
Surely she won't take
a noble lady seriously.

643
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,630
But if she goes too far...

644
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,030
and makes trouble,

645
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,120
that won't be a minor issue anymore.

646
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,320
Your Majesty, it's better to
keep a lookout as soon as possible.

647
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,400
Your Majesty!

648
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,430
Your Majesty,

649
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,930
I've finished collecting morning dew.

650
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,590
Before Her Majesty woke up,

651
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,740
Noble Lady Wei had been waiting here.

652
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,720
As Her Majesty needed to freshen up
and have her breakfast,

653
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,920
she went to the garden to collect dew...

654
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,560
for Her Majesty's tea.

655
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,770
Noble Lady Wei, you're really diligent...

656
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,310
serving Her Majesty.

657
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,640
It's my duty.

658
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:07,100
Okay. Since you've greeted me,

659
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,770
all of you may leave now.

660
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,920
I'm taking my leave.

661
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,180
Your Majesty, what they said...

662
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,460
is so outrageous.

663
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,400
His Majesty visited her for a few times.

664
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:37,090
And their resentment...

665
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,800
has exposed their ugly side.

666
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,590
But it's true that His Majesty...

667
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:42,920
has never had the same consort
attend to him for nights.

668
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,920
No wonder they're getting anxious.

669
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,170
It seems that Wei Ying Luo
is skillful indeed.

670
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:53,120
No matter how beautiful a flower is,
you'll eventually get sick looking at it.

671
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,950
His Majesty has come across
numerous women.

672
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,000
No matter how capable she is,
how long can she keep him by her side?

673
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,870
Only those short-sighted women...

674
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,050
would get agitated.

675
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,600
No matter how they
fight against each other,

676
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,400
you're the empress.

677
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,680
Just let them fight.

678
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,230
The fiercer, the better.

679
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,310
Greetings, Your Highness.

680
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,240
I thought you're
some extraordinary beauty.

681
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,050
But you look so ordinary.

682
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,930
Let's go.

683
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,820
Is she the younger sister of
Imperial Concubine Jia?

684
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:52,820
Yes.

685
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,520
Upon entering the palace,
she's conferred the title of noble lady.

686
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,640
In less than two years, she became
the mistress of her own palace.

687
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,200
Besides Noble Consort Chun,

688
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,560
she and Imperial Concubine Shu
are the most favoured consorts.

689
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,960
This young Concubine Jia
is arrogant and overbearing...

690
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,690
because she's being favoured.

691
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,840
However,

692
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,440
on the birthday of Empress Dowager,

693
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,130
she fell sick and remained in the palace.

694
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,520
She's indeed charming and beautiful.

695
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,430
She's even more attractive...

696
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,580
compared to Imperial Concubine Jia.

697
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,300
There are so many consorts
living in the harem.

698
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,880
Yet, she's able to stand out.

699
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,280
It means she's talented.

700
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,160
Where does she stay?

701
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,640
Chuxiu Palace.

702
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,810
It seems that...

703
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,000
she sees me as her enemy.

704
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,000
His Majesty let you serve him
for three consecutive days.

705
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,980
You're very likely
to be criticised by them.

706
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,450
You must be careful.

707
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,260
Lan!

708
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:46,280
Tell Supervisor Li...

709
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:49,000
that I'm severely sick.

710
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,710
I'll die soon if I don't see His Majesty!

711
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,390
Mistress,

712
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:54,680
I don't think that's a good idea.

713
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,880
What's wrong with it?

714
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,140
Didn't that wretch trick
His Majesty like this?

715
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,890
Why can't I do the same?

716
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,820
-Mistress.
-Go...

717
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:04,920
Go do it now!

718
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,320
Yes.

719
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,050
What a useless maid.

720
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,630
-Wait.
-Stop!

721
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,960
What's this?

722
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,250
You, get over here.

723
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,870
What's this?

724
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,390
Your Majesty,

725
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:37,640
Noble Lady Wei said
the weather is too hot.

726
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:40,510
Thus, she instructed us
to set up this reed mat...

727
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,930
on the path that Your Majesty takes often.

728
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,640
They're all the old and unused reed mats
from Imperial Household Department.

729
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,500
It took only some effort to set it up.

730
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,700
No money spent.

731
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,840
Attendants often take a rest under it.

732
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,360
Many people are grateful to her.

733
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,280
Fine, you may leave now.

734
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,680
Move!

735
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,360
Let's go to Yanxi Palace.

736
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:10,070
Yes.

737
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,640
To Yanxi Palace!

738
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,600
Lan, put more powder here.

739
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,800
I can't look too ruddy.

740
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,830
-Yes.
-Hurry.

741
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:21,780
Here.

742
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,000
Oh, put some eyebrow pigment
under my eyes.

743
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,530
-Dark green colour.
-Okay.

744
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:28,620
Okay...

745
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,000
Very good.

746
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:31,170
Hurry...

747
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,070
Hurry...

748
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,870
Mistress, His Majesty
was about to reach here.

749
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:41,160
But he turned around and
went to the Yanxi Palace instead.

750
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,110
What?

751
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,930
His Majesty has gone to
the Yanxi Palace instead.

752
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:47,980
What a vixen.

753
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,390
You vixen!

754
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,810
How dare you vie with me
for His Majesty's favour.

755
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:55,990
Wei Ying Luo!

756
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,500
-Master.
-I'm so mad. Don't touch me!

757
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,040
Greetings, Your Majesty.

758
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:08,800
Where is Wei Ying Luo?

759
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,320
She lured me here.
Why doesn't she come out to greet me?

760
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:13,620
Your Majesty,

761
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,600
Noble Lady Wei isn't around.

762
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,600
-What?
-She said...

763
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:21,080
she's going for a stroll because
the weather is too hot today.

764
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,500
Where did Noble Lady Wei go?
