[Story of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 31]

3
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,670
If doing this would
make everyone in the palace imitate it,

4
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,630
then that is a truly good thing.

5
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,850
When the Empress was in charge,

6
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,820
she mainly focused on...

7
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,200
controlling the expenses.

8
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:09,330
This induced a lot of criticisms
from some people in the palace.

9
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:12,600
Now, you're the one in charge
of the palace affairs.

10
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,930
You are very meticulous and thorough.

11
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,950
You are respected by people in the palace.

12
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:22,920
Just be bold and go with your plan.

13
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:26,160
With your trust, I will do my best.

14
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,070
One more thing,

15
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,980
as Zhili, Shandong and
other areas suffered from floods,

16
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:34,100
a lot of refugees are
migrating into the capital.

17
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,860
porridge kitchens outside Di'an Gate.

18
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,930
One, it can provide disaster relief.

19
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:42,329
Second, it can serve as
praying for blessing for the Empress.

20
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:46,960
It's a good thing to setup
porridge kitchens for disaster relief.

21
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:50,650
But the food and money will be a problem.

22
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:55,110
We'll be using the money belonging to
the Imperial Household Department.

23
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,900
But life here in the palace
is already quite hard.

24
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,250
Every one is worried and looks bleak.

25
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,270
Isn't Consort Xian...

26
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,140
making it more difficult
for everyone by doing that?

27
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,560
Noble Consort, don't worry.

28
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,180
Based on past experiences, we can
mobilise donations from gentry merchants.

29
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,000
Please write
a decree about being benevolent.

30
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,410
People within the city would surely
rally together in response to it.

31
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:22,770
By then, without touching
the Imperial Household Department vault,

32
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:25,220
this problem can be resolved.

33
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,670
Consort Xian makes
thorough considerations.

34
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,270
This way,

35
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,930
we can accumulate good karma
for the Empress...

36
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:36,100
and comfort the refugees.

37
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,940
It's hitting two birds with one stone.

38
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,920
Execute your plan boldly.

39
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,090
I will give you full support.

40
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,960
Thank you for you graces, Empress Dowager.

41
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:59,710
Consort Xian, you are highly
favoured by Empress Dowager.

42
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:02,440
You should be
well-contented with your success.

43
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:06,420
I'm doing my best to help
Empress Dowager and Empress.

44
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,940
I dare not bear what you've said.

45
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,890
Broaden the sources and
reduce the expenditures.

46
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:15,790
Help with disaster relief and
set up porridge kitchens.

47
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,050
You are in a rush to win everyone's heart.

48
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,700
Do you want to become the Empress?

49
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,320
Although Her Highness Empress may be sick,

50
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,970
Physician Ye is treating her,

51
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,940
I believe she will recover soon.

52
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,210
I'm just managing
the matters in the palace.

53
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,950
I haven't done
anything that's beyond my duty.

54
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,440
My heart and affection...

55
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,130
can be proven by the heaven.

56
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,320
You performed well,

57
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:47,810
but I'm a professional performer.

58
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:51,450
I can't stand amateurs.

59
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,020
Zhi Lan, let's go.

60
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,840
She's jealous, so she made
slanderous remarks.

61
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,910
Your Highness, what should we do?

62
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,770
We will do what we should do.

63
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:16,110
Noble Consort, your skin is like snow.

64
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,420
It's smooth and glistening.

65
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,630
I envy you a lot.

66
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,660
If you also moisturise yourself
with milk every day...

67
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,990
and soak in balsam,
you will be like this too.

68
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:31,850
Noble Consort, you are a natural beauty
and the top beauty in the six palaces.

69
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,990
How would I dare to be compared to you?

70
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,890
Stop being a glib talker.

71
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,550
I spent a lot of efforts and ideas...

72
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,100
before I was able to eliminate Empress
who was an eyesore.

73
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,810
Who expected that Consort Xian...

74
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,890
would rescue Empress Dowager
at the Double Ninth Festival...

75
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:54,050
and became famous overnight?

76
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,930
As for my strenuous fruits of labour,

77
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:01,850
she has beaten me to it.

78
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,740
Noble Consort,

79
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,320
Consort Xian has obtained
the favour of the Empress Dowager.

80
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,000
If you don't take actions now,

81
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,700
she will become political
and harder to go against in the future.

82
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:19,900
She'll be at Di'an Gate
to help in the disaster relief.

83
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,080
Do you know what you should do?

84
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:28,020
Your Highness, don't worry. I understand.

85
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,550
We are distributing porridge
tomorrow outside Di'an Gate.

86
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:32,310
Everyone must go and help out.

87
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,720
Madam Liu,

88
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,990
we have piles of work on our hands.

89
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:38,780
If we go to Di'an Gate tomorrow,
how will we finish our work?

90
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,510
Consort Xian has given the instructions.

91
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:43,300
Anyone from Labour House
that helps outside Di'an Gate...

92
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,270
will be rewarded with
one tael of silver and given a day off.

93
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,590
-That much?
-Consort Xian is really great.

94
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,990
I have never received such rewards before.

95
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,070
That's right. Only Consort Xian
would remember slaves like us.

96
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:59,370
-We are even given a day off.
-Enough, stop being long winded.

97
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:00,560
Go back and rest now.

98
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,040
Be at Di'an Gate
tomorrow around midnight.

99
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,240
Yes.

100
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,050
Consort Xian said that...

101
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,070
those in the six palaces who fall sick....

102
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,820
will be treated by a physician
and given a day off.

103
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,670
Consider yourself lucky.
Remain here tomorrow.

104
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,400
Everyone, dismiss.

105
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,620
Consort Xian has her own ways.

106
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,880
She calmly won everyone's heart.

107
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,430
Ying Luo,

108
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,750
compared to her, your Empress...

109
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,990
lacks a lot.

110
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,700
Did I say anything wrong?

111
00:07:58,409 --> 00:08:01,370
Are you crazy? You have a fever.
What are you doing out here?

112
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:02,380
Go back and rest.

113
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,530
What are you doing?

114
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,500
-Yuan Chun Wang, put me down.
-Stop talking. I'm your older brother.

115
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,050
Put me down.

116
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:20,270
You are making preparations to keep vigil
at Consort Dowager Yu's tomb?

117
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,250
Yes.

118
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,500
How long will you be gone?

119
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,100
Three years.

120
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,260
You are a very filial son.

121
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,090
I'm touched by your filial piety.

122
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,620
I have always acted ridiculous,

123
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:44,169
repeatedly created troubles...

124
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,370
and caused mother to worry,

125
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,760
suffering from sleepless nights.

126
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,090
For all these years,

127
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,030
I have wronged her.

128
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,400
Being able to keep vigil
at her tomb for three years...

129
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,560
is the only thing...

130
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,140
an unfilial son like me can do.

131
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,630
Unfilial son?

132
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,010
Yes.

133
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,340
You are definitely a non-filial son.

134
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,280
You are the son of Consort Dowager Yu,

135
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,930
but you are also
the son of our late father!

136
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,300
You are my brother,

137
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,270
a prince of the Great Qing!

138
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,320
All these years,

139
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,370
you have been listening to a woman.

140
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,520
Loitering around,
you have committed many wrongdoings.

141
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,750
You wasted a lot of time.

142
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,670
As of now, you are still stubborn...

143
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,960
and doesn't know where your fault lies!

144
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,910
Why are you looking at me?

145
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,720
Am I someone...

146
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:02,010
who kill his siblings ruthlessly,

147
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,370
intolerant and not magnanimous?

148
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,740
Living in the palace,
Consort Dowager Yu...

149
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,360
had a pretty limited worldview.

150
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,910
She only knew that the event where...

151
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,590
the sons of the previous emperor competed
for the throne can't be repeated.

152
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:23,260
But she almost killed you!

153
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,880
If it's as what she said,

154
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,080
you will always be a useless person.

155
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,930
You might as well hang yourself now...

156
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,920
lest you tarnish the reputation
of the Aisin Gioro clan!

157
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,930
Brother.

158
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:42,950
Hong Zhou.

159
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,830
I kept giving you chances.

160
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:50,730
I have always hoped
you would open your heart to me.

161
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,890
But I waited for ten years...

162
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:58,240
and you are still so ridiculous.

163
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,270
You are still so dim-witted.

164
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,840
Get lost.

165
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,100
Go and keep vigil at your mother's tomb.

166
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,160
Don't ever return to Forbidden City!

167
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,170
Brother!

168
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,160
I'm dim-witted.

169
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,540
I was wrong.

170
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,520
Please forgive me.

171
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,130
Brother,

172
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,700
please forgive me.

173
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,340
Hong Zhou,

174
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,310
you are a descendant
of the Aisin Gioro clan.

175
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:53,260
The distinguished Prince He.

176
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,400
If just to avoid political strife,

177
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,320
you would hide
your aspirations and dreams...

178
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,650
under the pretense of being ridiculous,

179
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,870
will you be able to face
our late father in the future?

180
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:07,940
Will you be able to face
the ancestors of the Great Qing?

181
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,230
I...

182
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,000
will end my words here.

183
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,860
If you still have ambitions,

184
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,890
then consider carefully...

185
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,100
what you can do for...

186
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,310
our country...

187
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:38,530
and our people.

188
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,190
Prince, you must be careful.

189
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,650
Well, what's wrong with him?

190
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,690
Stop!

191
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,600
Prince He.

192
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,880
Consort Xian.

193
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,940
you here to look for His Majesty?

194
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,570
The palace is building porridge kitchens
to provide disaster relief.

195
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:33,100
I need to present
some matters to His Majesty.

196
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:35,920
I'm busy.

197
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,580
I won't disturb you.

198
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,590
Prince He.

199
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:46,330
Consort Xian, do you still
have any instructions?

200
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:52,550
Prince He, why are you crying?

201
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,250
I'm sorry.

202
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,940
I'm being disrespectful.

203
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,370
If you go out of the palace like this,

204
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,970
rumours will spread
all over the Forbidden City again,

205
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:11,080
saying you and your brother
are on bad terms.

206
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,480
Thank you for reminding me, Your Highness.

207
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,340
My mother suddenly came to my mind.

208
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,260
The sudden burst of
sorrowful emotions...

209
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,990
probably made my eyes turn red.

210
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,480
You're a filial son. It's really touching.

211
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,950
But remorse and grief are useless.

212
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,250
Why not do something more meaningful?

213
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,680
We mentioned that...

214
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:35,820
Consort Xian will be distributing
porridge outside the Di'an Gate tomorrow.

215
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,230
This is a good matter
that will benefit the people.

216
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:41,410
If you have the time to cry,
why don't you come and help out?

217
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,920
You can accumulate
some good karma for Consort Dowager Yu.

218
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,580
Zhen, don't say nonsense.

219
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,910
But,

220
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,950
if someone ridiculous like me...

221
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,430
appears in Di'an Gate,

222
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:53,390
I fear that it will invite ridicule.

223
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,950
If you wants to do something serious...

224
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,990
that will make others
look at you in a different way,

225
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:59,950
the Di'an Gate
disaster relief is a good first step.

226
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,090
How did you know?

227
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:07,120
Your thoughts are
all written on your face.

228
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,420
Prince!

229
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,570
I went to chat with some eunuchs.

230
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,110
When I returned, you were gone.

231
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,760
Why didn't you call me?

232
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:35,140
Are you serving me
or the other way around?

233
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,070
Is there anything on my face?

234
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:45,110
Prince, what am I looking for?

235
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,010
Is there anything written on it?

236
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,350
No, there's nothing.

237
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,000
Not everyone is worthy of being described
as having a pure heart and spirit.

238
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,120
Jin Xiu, where are you going?

239
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,530
I forgot something.
I'm going back to get it.

240
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:43,860
You all can leave first.

241
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:04,550
Don't rush! Fall in line!

242
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,380
Everyone, don't rush!
Each will get their share!

243
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,280
First come, first serve! Fall in line!

244
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,680
-Don't push!
-Thank you.

245
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,790
-Don't push forward!
-I'll take one.

246
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,690
-Don't push!
-Thank you.

247
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,250
-Thank you.
-Fall in line!

248
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,900
Fall in line properly!

249
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,609
Everyone, don't rush!
Each will get their share!

250
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:24,400
Thank you.

251
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,750
-Thank you.
-Fall in line properly!

252
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,170
Don't push forward!

253
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,960
Thank you.

254
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,520
Thank you.

255
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,620
-Fall in line properly!
-Thank you.

256
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,710
Fall in line!

257
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:45,080
-Let us pass! We also want to eat!
-Don't push!

258
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,150
Don't push! Go to the back of the line!

259
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,720
Don't push!
There are too many people in front!

260
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,650
Step back! First come first serve!

261
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,050
Don't push! Go fall in line!

262
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,000
I'm talking to you! You're still pushing?

263
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,220
Why should I?

264
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,780
Go fall in line! Fall in line!

265
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,780
Fall in line!

266
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:03,720
Step back!

267
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:08,370
If you don't fall in line,
we won't distribute the buns anymore!

268
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:11,470
- Don't push!
-For what reason are you not giving to us?

269
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,830
Everyone, don't push!

270
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,580
Stop pushing forward!

271
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:24,290
Go to the back!

272
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:27,400
Supervisor Wu, why is it so chaotic?

273
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,450
Consort Xian, suddenly
many refugees showed up.

274
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,330
The whole place is chaotic now.

275
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:34,610
Look. Should we stop it for a while?

276
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,430
What is this?

277
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,930
Aren't the imperial consorts helping
by distributing porridge? What is this?

278
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,460
This is water!

279
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,880
Look. You can even see
your reflection on it.

280
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,500
Look! Look at this bun!

281
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,740
Not only is it made of coarse grains,
there are even sand inside!

282
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,690
Can this be eaten?
Look at how my teeth got damaged!

283
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:53,380
Indeed! Are these for people to eat?

284
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,410
Your Highness, they are talking nonsense!

285
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:57,380
There aren't any sand in our buns.

286
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,130
We travelled thousand of miles to
come to the capital city.

287
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:01,760
We thought that we'll have something
to eat and clothes to wear.

288
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,690
But in the end, we kept being
driven away by officers.

289
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,820
The rich won't donate.

290
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,630
Our clothes are tattered,
our stomach empty.

291
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,300
We can only sell our children.

292
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,660
Didn't the palace say that they are
helping by giving out food?

293
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,050
Lies!

294
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,270
They are liars!

295
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,540
Liars!

296
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,660
They are liars!

297
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,390
Liars!

298
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:23,570
Why still fall in line?
Let's just go grab them!

299
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:25,630
Later, there won't be anything left!

300
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,480
Take them! Quickly pick them up!

301
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,340
Didn't you say that
you're giving out porridge?

302
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,340
These food aren't enough!

303
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,940
What do you mean by
giving out porridge?

304
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,990
You're tricking us!

305
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:45,020
Let the person-in-charge face us!
Release the food!

306
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:48,100
Release the food!

307
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,180
Release the food!

308
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,540
Release the food!

309
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,970
Everyone, calm down!

310
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,250
Listen to me!

311
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,800
Listen to me!

312
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,410
There will be
a new batch of food coming, okay?

313
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:06,600
- What are you doing? Move back!
-What are you doing?

314
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,240
Hurry! Hurry and call for more men!

315
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,940
Your Highness,
let's return to the palace now.

316
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,120
It's her! The food isn't enough!

317
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:17,140
She's pretending to be benevolent!

318
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,450
-She's a liar! Get her!
-What are you doing? Move back!

319
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:21,300
Get her! Liar!

320
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,650
Move back!

321
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:41,980
He killed him!

322
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,320
He's not a refugee!

323
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,840
What refugee?

324
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:51,550
A real refugee would come
from Tianjin or Shandong.

325
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:54,810
They wore grass shoes whose soles
had long been tattered from the travel.

326
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:55,930
Look at him.

327
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:57,900
He's wearing cloth shoes.

328
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,090
He's not a refugee.

329
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:02,120
He's a bandit with evil intentions
who infiltrated the refugees!

330
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,160
Nonsense!

331
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,770
You are on his side!

332
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,400
After killing him,
you are falsely accusing us?

333
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,800
-Kill him!
-Indeed!

334
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,410
Anyone who moves forward
will end up like him.

335
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:15,490
Move aside!

336
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,320
Move aside!

337
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:28,740
Greetings, Your Highness Prince He.

338
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,750
Consort Xian,

339
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,660
are you okay?

340
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,970
I'm fine.

341
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,870
Consort Xian,

342
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:43,990
a total of eight people
started this ruckus.

343
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:47,900
Other than that person I killed,
there are still seven of them.

344
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,660
That one,

345
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,000
that one and that one!

346
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,440
And those two over there.

347
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,010
The other two at the
southeastern corner.

348
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:55,350
A total of eight people.

349
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:59,030
How did you know who are the imposters?

350
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,690
Replying to your question,

351
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:03,530
when they arrived,
I started monitoring them closely.

352
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,060
They infiltrated the refugees,

353
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,670
deliberately pushing and dividing them.

354
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:08,840
If you don't believe me,

355
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:12,040
just arrest and interrogate them.
You'll know the truth.

356
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:14,240
Capture all of them!

357
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:17,370
Come over here! Don't move! Come with me!

358
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:20,590
Why are you arresting me?

359
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,660
Everyone, fall in line!

360
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:27,460
Wait for the food distribution
to start again!

361
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:34,000
Prince He, thank you.

362
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:38,070
I reported to His Majesty in advance
to dispatch the soldiers here.

363
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,220
But...

364
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,070
there are only that much food
and that many people.

365
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,950
I fear it's inadequate.

366
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,660
My Lord, Your Highness.

367
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,560
The real refugees are obvious.

368
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:53,450
They traveled along dusty roads
and went through hardships.

369
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:56,040
They are lean and haggard,
too frail to stand a gust of wind.

370
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,270
As for those crafty scoundrels,

371
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,730
they are full of vitality
and in good health.

372
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:02,340
They are deliberately
here to commit frauds.

373
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,380
Who would pretend to get food relief?

374
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:08,180
The rogues of the capital,
hooligans, vagabonds.

375
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:12,360
Or they were deliberately
hired by someone.

376
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,390
Why would they do that?

377
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:17,760
Because of them,

378
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,160
the real refugees won't be able
to get the food rations.

379
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,160
After a period of time,
they will naturally complain.

380
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:26,770
It may even create a major chaos.

381
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,110
How evil.

382
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,560
Did you see it? Hit it that way.

383
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,660
Here,

384
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,290
hold this properly.

385
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,390
Come, strike.

386
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,340
This is not the right way. Watch this.

387
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,370
You rat.

388
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:03,060
Stop hitting him. I'm begging you.

389
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,750
Can't we do it again?

390
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:08,350
Noble Consort has ordered
that it's only for a month.

391
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:11,350
If you don't train well,
you will lose your lives!

392
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,340
Four out of the eight craftsmen are dead.

393
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,240
They were totally disobedient.

394
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:20,090
This is a lesson from
your failed predecessors.

395
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:21,490
Continue to train!

396
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:30,530
Come, put it down.

397
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:37,030
Son, let me tell you.

398
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,410
You are now training with sand.

399
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:43,580
When you perform,
you will be using hot melt iron.

400
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,460
If you are not careful,
you will lose your life.

401
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,570
The chassis must be stable.

402
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:51,540
When you strike,
it must be in a circular motion.

403
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,180
You mustn't move your hands.

404
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,590
Grandfather, I don't want to train.

405
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:59,650
I want to go home...

406
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:03,350
Foolish child, we can't go home anymore.

407
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:05,430
Who says you can't go home?

408
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:15,190
I have something to say
to your grandfather.

409
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,710
Go and train over there.

410
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:17,890
Okay?

411
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,030
Go and train.

412
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:31,000
Miss. In order to pass down
Fire Flowers to our descendants,

413
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:34,690
Lord Gao forced all the blacksmiths
in the city to train this.

414
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:39,030
We need to perform at
the Emperor and Empress's birthdays.

415
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:42,420
Even if we fight for our lives,
we can't escape.

416
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,190
What solution do you have?

417
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:45,710
Fire Flowers...

418
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:47,910
was created to entertain the people.

419
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,340
But once it entered the palace,

420
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,740
it became a powerful game
for the consorts.

421
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,890
It became a tribute.

422
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:58,610
Several generations suffered from that.

423
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:01,190
I have a way...

424
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:03,800
to help you escape
from this wretched plight.

425
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:30,430
The porridge kitchens we have
aren't enough to supply the refugees.

426
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:32,490
Other than children below ten...

427
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,720
and elders who are above 60,

428
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,360
the rest must help
to build porridge kitchens.

429
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:42,950
Why? We refuse to work!

430
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:44,990
-We refuse to work!
-We want to eat buns!

431
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:46,450
Who are you lying to?

432
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:50,160
We refuse to work! We want to eat!

433
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,930
Zhili, Shandong and
other places have been flooded.

434
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:55,450
Countless refugees
flooded into the capital.

435
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:58,230
The palace and the wealthy families
donated grains for porridge...

436
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:59,930
out of kindness.

437
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:04,290
But this kindness should be given
to those who really need help.

438
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,400
Consort Xian, this may not be a good idea.

439
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:10,510
Every bowl of porridge
and every piece of bun here...

440
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:12,660
are from the hard work of the people...

441
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,540
who toiled night and day.

442
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:17,130
Every single grain
didn't fall from thin air.

443
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:19,160
If they donated, they are doing charity.

444
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,950
They can choose not to donate too.

445
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:23,300
Thus, you don't have
the rights to question this.

446
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,900
You also don't have the rights
to demand for it.

447
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:28,670
If you work hard to get food,

448
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:32,050
it belongs to you.
No one can take it away.

449
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:38,320
Now, the children, old, sick and weak...

450
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,420
will be given food without any payment.

451
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:43,220
As for others, go and work!

452
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,220
We don't have any strength to work!

453
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,710
Shut up!

454
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:52,850
Everyone, listen!

455
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:55,910
We have to build eight
porridge kitchens in Di'an Gate.

456
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:58,450
Outside the city, we must also
build a refugee camp.

457
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:01,100
If you're willing to come work,
come here to register.

458
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,480
We will distribute the food
based on the number of people.

459
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,490
After eating, hence, regaining strength,

460
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:08,810
use your own labour
to exchange for your food the next day.

461
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:10,670
Those who want
to obtain food without working for it,

462
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:12,380
won't receive any food at all.

463
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,640
Who are you fooling?

464
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:16,140
-What right do you have to do this?
-Indeed!

465
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:18,680
Consort Xian,

466
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,600
no one has ever done this before.

467
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:22,930
Prince He,

468
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,850
they are indeed refugees.

469
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:27,910
But this was a natural disaster.
Nobody owes them.

470
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:30,600
Now, all of these people
seeking disaster relief...

471
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,130
are displaying
an attitude of seeking debts.

472
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:35,690
Which means if this charity movement
doesn't ask for payment at all,

473
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:37,420
no one would cherish it then.

474
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,300
Enough! Stop wasting energy with them!

475
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,400
We won't work! Let's go!

476
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,200
They aren't giving us food. Let's go!

477
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,340
My Lord.

478
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,320
Look.

479
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:50,130
-Why should we go work?
-Let's go.

480
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,420
Do you see it?

481
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,880
If charity is completely free,

482
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,960
there will be a lot of people
pretending to be refugees to get food.

483
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,800
When I asked them to work,

484
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,320
those who don't need food...

485
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,840
won't return anymore.

486
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,930
You're forcing those faking
to get food to leave.

487
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,020
If one isn't extremely starving,

488
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:15,350
who would be willing to use
hard labour in exchange for food?

489
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:17,770
Zhen,

490
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:19,960
arrange for the old people and children...

491
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,090
to fall in lane and
continue distributing the porridge.

492
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,020
Fall in line!

493
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,610
Don't push...

494
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:32,670
Fall in line!
Everyone will get their share!

495
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,050
It's starting...

496
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:36,430
-Come, everyone will get one!
-Thank you.

497
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:38,280
-One by one.
-Thank you.

498
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,610
Consort Xian,
you indeed are full of ideas.

499
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,400
Giving food during times of war
will invite gratitude.

500
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,890
Giving food during peaceful times
will invite grudge once you stop.

501
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:53,440
Incessant help will make people lazy...

502
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,300
and destroy their temperament.

503
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,410
I want them to know...

504
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:59,380
that if they want to be helped,

505
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,320
they must help themselves first.

506
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:05,220
As for the food, they should be left to
the ones who really need them.

507
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:10,000
But the refugees have traveled far.

508
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,570
Most of them are sick and weak.

509
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:14,430
They need the imperial physicians
to examine them.

510
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:15,950
We must arrange for that.

511
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,510
Don't worry.

512
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,280
I'll make the arrangements.

513
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,690
From which palace are you from?

514
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,870
Your Highness,

515
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:34,810
he's just a lowest rank eunuch
who scrubs commodes.

516
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:38,440
Your Highness,
I came from the Labour House.

517
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:41,120
You never ask the background of a hero.

518
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,500
The Labour House lacks a supervisor.

519
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,060
You shall fill that position.

520
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:50,150
Your Highness, thank you for your graces!

521
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,800
I will accept your command.

522
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,120
Imperial Guard Fuca.

523
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,210
Empress isn't awake yet?

524
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,300
Thank you.

525
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,060
I have to go on duty.

526
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,130
I'll come visit her tomorrow.

527
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,510
Imperial Guard Fuca!

528
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,450
Do you still need anything?

529
00:31:58,610 --> 00:31:59,770
I...

530
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:03,890
I heard from my grandfather...

531
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:08,390
that His Majesty
has intentions of bestowing us marriage.

532
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:13,230
I want to marry the lady I love.

533
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,510
Marriage is the order of one's parents,
the words of a matchmaker.

534
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:21,970
Moreover, this is a decree
from the Emperor.

535
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:23,990
Can you go against it?

536
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,090
Er Qing,

537
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,350
before meeting her,

538
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,620
I might accept this kind of marriage.

539
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:33,050
But now,

540
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,840
I have someone I love.

541
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,440
If I still marry you,

542
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,640
I'll hold you up.

543
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,620
Even if Ying Luo is heartless,

544
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:53,790
you still won't change your mind?

545
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,050
Er Qing,

546
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,100
you will meet someone better.

547
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,220
Someone who truly cherishes you.

548
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:03,110
But that someone isn't me.

549
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,580
I'm sorry.

550
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:30,480
Er Qing,

551
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,970
is the medicated pillow
I made for Empress still around?

552
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,730
Er Qing.

553
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:43,650
Sister Er Qing.

554
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,860
Consort Chun is calling you.

555
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:48,900
Consort Chun.

556
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,970
Why are you in a daze?

557
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,600
What has happened?

558
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,600
Nothing.

559
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,820
Your Highness, what are your instructions?

560
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:03,480
Is the medicated pillow I made for
the Empress still around?

561
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,580
The herbs I used are for nerve calming.

562
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:09,310
Now, we must change them to herbs that
clear the mind and stimulate the spirit.

563
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:10,370
It's still around.

564
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,480
I've put it inside a chest.
I'll go look for it now.

565
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,800
Er Qing,

566
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,710
what's wrong with you today?

567
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:36,750
In the past,
you have always done things properly.

568
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:39,600
It's all because
that Imperial Guard Fuca...

569
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,659
who kept thinking about Wei Ying Luo.

570
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:44,110
He actually dared to refuse
the Emperor's bestowed marriage.

571
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,179
Hu Po.

572
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:55,560
-Your Highness, be careful.
-Consort Chun, be careful!

573
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,330
What?

574
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,470
the Emperor...

575
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:06,620
wants to bestow marriage
to you and Imperial Guard Fuca?

576
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:08,060
Your Highness,

577
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:10,100
don't listen to Hu Po's nonsense.

578
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:16,820
Your Highness.

579
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:20,580
The floor is full of shattered
pieces of ceramics.

580
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:23,170
Be careful, don't hurt your hand.

581
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:29,140
I will be careful.

582
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,160
Previously,

583
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:39,990
the Empress said...

584
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,760
that she'll find an appropriate husband...

585
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,870
for you and Ming Yu.

586
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:48,980
I never thought...

587
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,750
the Emperor...

588
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,960
is more impatient than the Empress.

589
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:58,130
Isn't it all Wei Ying Luo's fault?

590
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,980
If she didn't bewitch Imperial Guard Fuca
to fall madly in love with her,

591
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,830
this would have been a good marriage.

592
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:04,490
Enough, Hu Po.

593
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:06,060
Stop saying nonsense.

594
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,540
Imperial Guard Fuca likes Ying Luo.

595
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,550
Everyone knows that.

596
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,270
I dare not hope too much.

597
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,380
What a pity.

598
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,530
Why are you glaring at me?

599
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,970
What happened?

600
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:24,220
Nothing...

601
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:34,080
Your Highness,
someone sent a secret complaint letter.

602
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,760
Since I handled palace affairs,

603
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:41,190
I received a lot of complaint letters.

604
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,660
Is there anything strange about that?

605
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,990
Your Highness, it's different this time.

606
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,830
Really?

607
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,210
Your Highness,
someone is scheming to offend a superior.

608
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:58,670
Should we immediately...

609
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:02,470
No.

610
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,200
Your Highness.

611
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:08,070
No rush.

612
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:13,180
The mantis preys on the cicada,
unaware of the oriole behind.

613
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,860
Wait patiently.

614
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:21,680
It's enough for that Consort Xian to
put on an act inside the Forbidden City.

615
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,880
Now, the whole capital is praising her.

616
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:28,310
They say she has awe-inspiring demeanor,
able to make the masses submit to her.

617
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:30,970
When have I not
opened up porridge kitchens...

618
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:33,440
outside the city during winter?

619
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,720
Those scoundrels,

620
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,600
they've all forgotten about it.

621
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:39,270
They can only see Consort Xian now.

622
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:42,000
All my hard work were in vain!

623
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,430
Your Highness, calm down.

624
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:55,930
If you do good things every year,
others won't find it novel anymore.

625
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:59,060
Consort Xian is usually quiet.

626
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,420
Now that she's able to do some great deed,

627
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:03,610
it naturally will invite attention.

628
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,890
But, Your Highness,

629
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:08,820
if we're able to organise
Empress Dowager's birthday banquet well,

630
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,140
you'll be in the limelight for sure.

631
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:14,870
For the birthday banquet this year,

632
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:17,320
I must get my dignity back.

633
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,320
Zhi Lan,

634
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,440
how is the preparation for
the birthday present of Empress Dowager?

635
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:25,440
Your Highness, the training for
Fire Flowers is complete.

636
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,750
You can go check it anytime.

637
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:29,110
Tell them to prepare for tonight.

638
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,550
I'll personally check it.

639
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:32,690
Yes.

640
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,870
But...

641
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:36,390
But what?

642
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:38,520
Four blacksmiths attempted to escape...

643
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,990
and were killed on site.

644
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,710
Four of them?

645
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,550
Even if it's 40 or 400,

646
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:47,830
I don't care.

647
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:51,500
What I want is the end result.

648
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:53,070
Yes.

649
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:57,750
I heard that you lost your temper...

650
00:39:57,850 --> 00:39:59,360
outside Di'an Gate.

651
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:01,370
You shocked Prince He.

652
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:02,950
Is that true?

653
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:07,350
Your Majesty, stop laughing at me.

654
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:10,000
If Prince He didn't come
with the soldiers today,

655
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,660
I would have been
eaten alive by those refugees.

656
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:16,560
It's easy for a person
in extreme hunger to lose rationality.

657
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,750
To restore order immediately,

658
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,320
I had no choice
but to employ a little trick.

659
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,980
It's not really worthy to be mentioned.

660
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:28,090
Not only Prince He praised you,

661
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,180
even Liu Tong Xun who was tasked to...

662
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,260
supervise the building
of the refugee camp,

663
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,220
only has praises for you.

664
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:38,120
He said that you're resolute
in handling matters...

665
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,470
and dignified.

666
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,570
To get a praise from
this old stubborn man...

667
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,800
is almost impossible.

668
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,860
Consort Xian,

669
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:52,300
I am impressed.

670
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,290
I'm just a woman from the imperial harem.

671
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:57,880
What I can do is really limited.

672
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:03,140
The one who's controlling the floods
and helping the refugees is Lord Gao Bin.

673
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:07,810
His actions will benefit the nation
and would be remember forever.

674
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:09,210
Consort Xian,

675
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:12,390
you knew that it was Noble Consort Gao...

676
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:14,990
who deliberately hired
those troublemakers.

677
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:17,380
Yet, you still praised her father?

678
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:20,720
We indeed have a little misunderstanding.

679
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,230
But how could we let
trifle matters here affect state affairs?

680
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:28,160
Although Noble Consort Gao
is a bit willful,

681
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:31,150
she's loyal to the Empress Dowager
and to you.

682
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:34,250
I know that because for
the birthday of Empress Dowager,

683
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:36,630
she specially invited blacksmiths...

684
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,760
to perform the unique stunt, Fire Flowers.

685
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:42,600
Fire Flowers?

686
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,670
What I know isn't that accurate.

687
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,440
I merely know that it's a rare sight.

688
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:51,050
Your Majesty, Noble Consort is asking
the performers to rehearse tonight.

689
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:53,480
Why don't you go and take a look?

690
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:56,140
Let me have a chance to see it too.

691
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:00,910
-Li Yu.
-I am here.

692
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:03,410
Go and inquire
where the rehearsal will be held.

693
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:04,600
Yes.

694
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,500
His Majesty is here.

695
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:26,830
Your Majesty?

696
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,320
Why did you come?

697
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:31,740
You didn't even inform me beforehand,

698
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:34,260
so I could have prepared.

699
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:37,390
You've asked them
to practise for a long time, right?

700
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:39,530
Tonight, I came here...

701
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:41,600
to enjoy it beforehand.

702
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:44,340
Your Majesty, you must be joking.

703
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:47,410
Your Majesty, you're clearly doubting me.

704
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:49,360
You must be worried that
I'll cause a huge joke...

705
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,890
during Empress Dowager's birthday banquet.

706
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,930
Your Majesty, you're wrong this time.

707
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:57,780
I believe that Empress Dowager...

708
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:00,330
will surely like this gift.
