[Story of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 9]

3
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:51,890
Mother! What are you doing?

4
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,750
-Please get up.
-You are His Majesty's consort.

5
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,560
As your parents,
we never benefited from that.

6
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,280
But we've instead behaved more prudent...

7
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,880
and careful so we do not
implicate your honour.

8
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,000
You aren't willing
to help your father's promotion,

9
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,750
and I am fine with it.

10
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,449
But you must save your little brother!

11
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,170
He's my only son.

12
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:15,430
I can't bury my child.

13
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,250
Does father know that you came here?

14
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,340
He doesn't know, am I right?

15
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,220
For twenty years, father has been
cautious and conscientious.

16
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,280
He served the public with integrity.

17
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,950
He was very afraid
of making any wrong move.

18
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,840
Hence, he named me Shu Shen.

19
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,810
Gentle and respectful, careful and kind.

20
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:43,079
Father wants me
to always remember to act cautiously.

21
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,870
My brother broke the state laws.

22
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,320
He should be punished for it.

23
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,900
If I beg His Majesty to be lenient,

24
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,460
that will be openly breaking the law...

25
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,520
and bending it for personal favours.

26
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:54,500
Will you watch your little brother...

27
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,600
be beheaded?

28
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,820
If that will be the sentence of
the Ministry of Justice,

29
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,950
I will send him off on his last journey.

30
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,080
That counts as
fulfilling my duty as his sister.

31
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,110
What a filial daughter.

32
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:15,590
Must you two be this devoted
to the public's interest?

33
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,820
Fine.

34
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,280
You can be a good person.

35
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,000
Once your little brother
goes to the execution ground,

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,840
you will never have a mother again!

37
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,240
Your Highness.

38
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:35,170
Are you really not interfering?

39
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,400
Are you really not going
to beg His Majesty?

40
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,530
No.

41
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,650
I can't go.

42
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,270
If I do that, not only
I will wrong His Majesty,

43
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,960
I will wrong the many years
of teachings of father.

44
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,829
I shouldn't help
my little brother escape punishment.

45
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:56,040
when I know...

46
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,140
that he indeed was wrong.

47
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,750
Your Majesty,
your headache and body pains...

48
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,480
must be from stagnated
heat in the lung meridian...

49
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,450
after getting exposed to cold.

50
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,450
It isn't a big deal.

51
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,730
Later, I'll prescribe some
cough relieving medicine...

52
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,600
made of ginger and pear.

53
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,310
Recuperate for half a month...

54
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,510
and your body will be completely cured.

55
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,630
Physician Zhang,
you are a divine physician.

56
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,860
I am of course at ease with your skills.

57
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,490
Or else, why would I
hand Noble Lady Yu to your care?

58
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,240
By the way,

59
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,240
regarding Noble Lady Yu,
is she well lately?

60
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:47,680
You can be frank with me.

61
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,659
Your Highness,

62
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,970
Noble Lady Yu experienced
dizziness symptoms frequently.

63
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,990
I meticulously
helped her nurse her health,

64
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,620
but the effect is minimal.

65
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,200
The root of the problem
is that Noble Lady Yu...

66
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,120
thinks too much causing her emotions
and consciousness to become unstable.

67
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,180
Emotionally and mentally unstable?

68
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,310
I never heard of such an illness.

69
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,930
People have seven emotions, which are...

70
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,410
joy, anger, anxiety,
worry, sadness, shock and fear.

71
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:17,070
The changes in emotions
will affect the state of her health.

72
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,390
Hence, she needs to self cultivate.

73
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,600
Noble Lady Yu is worrying too much.

74
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,340
Her state of mind is now affected.

75
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,630
If this goes on,

76
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:28,750
it will surely affect
the unborn baby in her womb.

77
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,850
The situation is that grave?

78
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:32,630
Now,

79
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,830
I can only hope that Noble Lady Yu
will resolve her worries...

80
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,890
and focus on nursing her health.

81
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,350
Physician Zhang, please do your best.

82
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,280
Your Majesty, do not worry.

83
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,630
I surely will do my best.

84
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,330
-Er Qing.
-Yes.

85
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:53,280
-Walk Physician Zhang out.
-Yes.

86
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,159
Thank you, Your Majesty.

87
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,580
This way please.

88
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,470
Ming Yu, help me change clothes.

89
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,130
Your Majesty, you're sick yourself.

90
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,090
Where else are you going?

91
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,140
I'm going to visit Noble Lady Yu.

92
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,610
Your Majesty...

93
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,020
You mustn't do so.

94
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,620
You just caught a cold.

95
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,620
You mustn't get exposed to the wind again.

96
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,750
Why don't we do this?

97
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,790
Let Ming Yu visit her on your behalf.

98
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:22,590
You can visit Noble Lady Yu
once you've recovered.

99
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,560
Ming Yu,

100
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,700
we still have some ginseng
in the warehouse.

101
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,530
Deliver them to Yonghe Palace.

102
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:32,570
Tell Noble Lady Yu
to take good care of her unborn baby.

103
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,670
-I will visit her soon.
-Yes.

104
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,170
Your Majesty.

105
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,120
Go to Yonghe Palace.

106
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,520
Tell Noble Lady Yu that Her Majesty
is always thinking of her.

107
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,280
Tell her to not worry
and take good care of her unborn baby.

108
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,950
Can you remember it?

109
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:52,980
Yes.

110
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,340
Return as soon as possible. Don't delay.

111
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,400
[The law is not just for one person.]

112
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,080
[If one broke it, abolished a command,
disrespected the society,]

113
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,530
[like a subject abandoning his monarch,
a subordinate offending his superior,]

114
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,160
[void would then follow
and the kingdom would become frail.]

115
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:21,420
Mistress, Her Highness
Consort Chun is here.

116
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:29,350
Consort Chun, why are you here?

117
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,780
Sister.

118
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:43,920
The law is not just for one person.

119
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:47,050
If one broke the law, abolished a command,
disrespected the society...

120
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,980
that's like a subject
abandoning his monarch,

121
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,720
a subordinate offending his superior.

122
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,000
If his subjects abandon the ruler,

123
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,860
the ruler will then be unable
to solidify his might.

124
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:58,260
Why did you write such words
in your family letter?

125
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,490
It's nothing.

126
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,130
Yu Hu,

127
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,400
do you know where those words come from?

128
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,740
King Zhuang of Chu once issued a command.

129
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:19,320
Anyone passing by the Mao Gates
must get off their carriage.

130
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,050
The Crown Prince broke the rule...

131
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:24,180
and the law enforcer killed
the carriage driver on site.

132
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,180
The Crown Prince then
complained to King Zhuang of Chu.

133
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:31,050
King Zhuang of Chu told him
that the law was not for one person.

134
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:34,220
If you encounter a person
who disobeys the law...

135
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,630
and you don't stop him,

136
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,909
people will then start following suit.

137
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,530
The law will then become useless.

138
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,120
If it is allowed to continue,

139
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,179
the subjects will start
to hold the law in contempt,

140
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:45,840
abandon their ruler
and offend their superior.

141
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,110
The ruler isn't doing his job.

142
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,410
The officials aren't doing their jobs.

143
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,670
The state will soon
not look like a state.

144
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:54,790
I've long heard that Lord Naerbu
is very strict in discipline.

145
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,140
After what I've seen today,

146
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,480
it is indeed so.

147
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,730
Looks like, you are determined...

148
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,770
not to ask for leniency
for your little brother.

149
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,520
Since I was little,
father has taught me...

150
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,450
the principles of proper conduct.

151
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,840
As an imperial consort of His Majesty,

152
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,800
I mustn't beg for leniency
from him just for personal reasons.

153
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:18,330
You say it in such
a stern and just manner.

154
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,980
But in your heart, can you really bear to?

155
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,080
If you can do this,

156
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,820
then why is the paper
drenched with your tears,

157
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,120
blurring the words?

158
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,150
His Majesty is currently extremely angry.

159
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,990
Even if you beg him for leniency now,

160
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,270
it might not work.

161
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,700
But if it is Her Majesty who do so,

162
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,780
it will be totally different.

163
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,340
You're asking me to beg the Empress?

164
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,030
If you go alone,

165
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,300
you might be suspected of being partial
because of personal connections...

166
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,950
and will draw criticism.

167
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,500
But if the Empress goes,

168
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,830
she will not only
save your little brother,

169
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,470
she will also preserve your virtuous name.

170
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,160
You think...

171
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,800
I refuse to beg for leniency
because I'm afraid...

172
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,800
that my reputation will be smeared?

173
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,880
Consort Chun,
you thought too lightly of me.

174
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:18,050
Let me tell you this, I won't beg anyone.

175
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,590
His Majesty killed Oshan
to display his might...

176
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,580
and to tell the court officials
to be alert at all times.

177
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,020
If he spares Chang Shou,

178
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,120
that's telling everyone
openly accepting bribes isn't illegal.

179
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,740
That will surely invite the grudge
of the people and political criticisms.

180
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,350
I will never do such a thing.

181
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,720
What are you laughing about?

182
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,680
I'm laughing at you for being
high-sounding but impractical.

183
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,410
After entering the palace
for so many years, you're still so naive.

184
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,220
For whole-hearted devotion to your master,

185
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,120
you'd rather abandon
the life of a loved one.

186
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,810
Do you think that by doing that,

187
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,290
His Majesty will care?

188
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,560
Currently,
drifting with the current is easy,

189
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,090
but it's hard to maintain
moral uplift alone,

190
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:02,050
because whole-hearted devotion
to one's master would become a joke,

191
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,760
and not bending the law to favour
self-interest will be criticised.

192
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,790
Consort Chun,

193
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:10,230
I will never beg
the Emperor nor the Empress,

194
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:13,510
because I do things not
to seek understanding from eminences,

195
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,510
but just to keep a clean conscience.

196
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,220
I'm going to write my letter now.

197
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,000
Consort Chun, if there is nothing else,

198
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,220
you can leave now.

199
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,910
I hope you will not regret this.

200
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,750
Your Highness,

201
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,820
why won't you listen
to the advice of Consort Chun?

202
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,320
Before I got married,

203
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,810
my father told me...

204
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,820
that I must insist on
my original character...

205
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,350
no matter what I go through.

206
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,770
Consort Chun keeps urging me
to beg the Empress.

207
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,230
If I went,

208
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:14,660
that would be siding with the Empress.

209
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:19,540
I don't want to join
those dirty collusions and quarrels.

210
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,420
Even more so,
I don't want to drift with the current...

211
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,350
and lose my original character.

212
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,630
Do you understand?

213
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,400
Noble Lady Yu!

214
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:01,530
Noble Lady Yu!

215
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:22,600
What are you doing?

216
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,050
Noble Lady Yu!

217
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,480
Noble Lady Yu!

218
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:35,380
Noble Lady Yu!

219
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,080
Help!

220
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,150
Help!

221
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,270
Help!

222
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,050
-There's a...
-Arrest her!

223
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,300
-Don't run!
-Arrest her!

224
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,760
Open the door!

225
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,970
-Er Qing.
-Yes.

226
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:37,210
How long has it been since
Imperial Concubine Yi left?

227
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,520
Your Majesty,

228
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:41,230
why are you asking about this suddenly?

229
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,450
Time flies by so fast.

230
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:49,050
If my memory serves me right,

231
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:53,140
today should be
the forty-ninth day after her death.

232
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,700
Open the door!

233
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,320
Open the door!

234
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,500
Noble Lady Yu!

235
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,670
-Noble Lady Yu, hurry and wake up!
-Open the door!

236
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:19,010
Open the door!

237
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,310
Go on!

238
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,340
Open the door!

239
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,250
Open the door!

240
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,350
Open the door! Hurry!

241
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:46,690
Open the door! Hurry, open the door!

242
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,190
Hurry!

243
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,930
-What's going on?
-Yonghe Palace is on fire.

244
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:56,590
Hurry, gather everyone
to help put out the fire.

245
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,620
Let's go.

246
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,210
Yonghe Palace is on fire!

247
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,160
Help!

248
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:11,370
-Yonghe Palace is on fire! Help!
-Capture her!

249
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,650
Save Noble Lady Yu! Help!

250
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:14,790
Hurry, cover her mouth!

251
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,490
-Help!
-Cover her mouth!

252
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,550
Someone is coming.

253
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,500
Execute Wei Ying Luo on the spot
for trying to assassinate Noble Lady Yu!

254
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:34,540
Hurry!

255
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,130
Greetings, Your Highness.

256
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,400
What is going on here?

257
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:50,450
I passed by Yonghe Palace today...

258
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,680
and thought of visiting Noble Lady Yu.

259
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:55,200
Who knew that I'd coincidentally
bump into Wei Ying Luo...

260
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,800
trying to kill Noble Lady Yu.

261
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,660
Of course, I have to arrest her.

262
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,320
Hurry, save Noble Lady Yu first!

263
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,120
Hurry, save Noble Lady Yu first!

264
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,220
Call for the imperial physician now!

265
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,010
Noble Lady Yu!

266
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,180
Noble Lady Yu!

267
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,430
-Noble Lady!
-Hurry!

268
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:14,190
-Noble Lady, what happened?
-Noble Lady Yu.

269
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,920
Assist her outside to rest first.

270
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,030
Be careful.

271
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,109
Wei Ying Luo,

272
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,960
explain what happened now.

273
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,330
I was ordered by the Empress...

274
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,920
to come here and visit Noble Lady Yu.

275
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,570
However,

276
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,160
I discovered...

277
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,980
that eunuch was trying
to strangle Noble Lady Yu!

278
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,710
I knocked him out,

279
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:45,280
then attempted
to escape and call for help.

280
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,780
However...

281
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,330
However, I bumped into Noble Consort Gao.

282
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,100
When Noble Consort Gao saw me,

283
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,700
she immediately wanted to kill me.

284
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:57,960
I had no choice...

285
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,510
but to escape back inside the room,

286
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:03,400
create smoke to lure people
to come here and save me.

287
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,670
You are full of blood...

288
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,450
and are panic-stricken.

289
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,100
What's so surprising about me
asking people to capture you?

290
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,170
But you...

291
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,960
hid inside the room...

292
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,830
and would rather die than open the door.

293
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,520
Your actions were very suspicious.

294
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,530
Of course, I have the reason to suspect
you of trying to murder Noble Lady Yu.

295
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,250
Hence, I ordered people to charge in.

296
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,540
Wake that eunuch up.

297
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,600
We will then know who ordered him.

298
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:31,460
Men!

299
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,180
Use water to wake the eunuch.

300
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:46,930
Talk.

301
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,860
Who ordered you to kill her?

302
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,530
Talk!

303
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:00,390
It was the Empress
who ordered me to kill her!

304
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:08,660
Since when did I become
the mastermind of a murder?

305
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,420
Why do I know nothing about it?

306
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,960
Greetings, Your Majesty.

307
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,340
If not because I remembered that today...

308
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,520
is the death anniversary of
Imperial Concubine Yi,

309
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,020
worried that Noble Lady Yu
would be pondering too much...

310
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,020
and hence personally came to visit,

311
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,440
I wouldn't have known...

312
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,200
Yonghe Palace is this lively.

313
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:29,710
Empress,

314
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,810
you heard it earlier, right?

315
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,700
This eunuch said...

316
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,130
that it was you who sent him
to kill Noble Lady Yu.

317
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,170
Lift your head.

318
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,640
When did I order you...

319
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,400
to kill Noble Lady Yu?

320
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,380
Your Majesty,
I didn't want to reveal that.

321
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,880
It was because the scheme got exposed.

322
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,710
I had no choice but to reveal it.

323
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,820
You lost your son.

324
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,080
You hate Noble Lady Yu
for getting pregnant.

325
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,170
You then used the excuse...

326
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,720
of the Imperial Household Department
sending more people here to help...

327
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,000
to place me inside Yonghe Palace.

328
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,530
You told me to eliminate Noble Lady Yu.

329
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,720
Today...

330
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,770
is the forty-ninth day after her death.

331
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,120
The palace forbids offerings for the dead.

332
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,460
Noble Lady Yu had no choice
but to send everyone away.

333
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,470
So I found the chance to make my move.

334
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:23,420
How dare you!

335
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,830
Your Majesty,
your health is more important.

336
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:29,460
Your Majesty,
the truth will eventually come out.

337
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,430
Who told you to slander the Empress?

338
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:37,620
You must know...

339
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:41,160
that this is a crime punishable by
the execution of nine relations.

340
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,440
Say it! If you don't,
I'll break your leg!

341
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,580
Your Majesty,

342
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,450
if it wasn't you who ordered me to kill,

343
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:54,290
how could I be this bold?

344
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:58,170
Now that things have come to this,
if Your Majesty will not admit it,

345
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,980
I can only die...

346
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:03,350
to fulfill my loyalty for you.

347
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,500
He hid poison between his teeth
and has committed suicide.

348
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:25,000
Everyone heard what he said earlier.

349
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:27,960
The Empress...

350
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,570
actually tried to kill Noble Lady Yu...

351
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,820
and the child in her womb
because of personal gain.

352
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,940
How shocking.

353
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:40,050
If  the Empress wanted
to kill Noble Lady Yu,

354
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:43,200
why would she send me here to visit her?

355
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,150
Maybe...

356
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:48,760
the Empress was worried that
he wouldn't be able to do it by himself.

357
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,890
Noble Consort, are you saying that...

358
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,800
I came to supervise the killing?

359
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,590
That is also possible.

360
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,370
On this eunuch,

361
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,580
there are three kinds of wounds.

362
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:08,040
On the neck, there is a wound
left by the tip of a hair pin.

363
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:10,960
On his head are bloody wounds
from being hit by a flower vase.

364
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,310
That greenish swelling on his forehead...

365
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,920
was formed when I forcefully
hit his head on the ground.

366
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,990
If the Empress...

367
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,080
wanted to commit murder,

368
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,230
why would she send me
to stop the perpetrator?

369
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,250
Isn't that self-conflicting?

370
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,560
Maybe the Empress sent you to silence him?

371
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,990
If I'm going to silence someone,

372
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,830
why did I come empty-handed?

373
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,820
Not only do I not have a dagger,

374
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,930
I didn't even have any rod.

375
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,590
Did the Empress...

376
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,230
tell me to be resourceful,

377
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,030
and just use the flower vase
of Noble Lady Yu to kill him?

378
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,760
I came to visit Noble Lady Yu...

379
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,900
and brought some ginseng along.

380
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,500
May I ask, Noble Consort,

381
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:57,400
what did you bring with you?

382
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,140
The Noble Consort...

383
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,240
brought with her a group of eunuchs.

384
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:08,440
What a fierce-looking party.

385
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,730
It doesn't look like
they're here to visit.

386
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:13,390
It looked like they came here
to seek vengeance.

387
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:16,340
You dare suspect me?

388
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:19,470
Offending your superior, slap her mouth!

389
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:25,370
Offending one's superior is a grave crime.

390
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:26,990
Of course, I dare not do it.

391
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:29,990
But with the same reasoning,

392
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:35,190
how could Your Highness,
through a testimony of a murderer...

393
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,400
just casually suspect the Empress?

394
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:41,880
Is it because Noble Consort
is self-assured of your noble status...

395
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,480
so you feared nothing
and spoke carelessly?

396
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,010
You're just a dog-like slave.

397
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:49,940
How dare you talk to me that way!

398
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,430
I think...

399
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,980
every word she said...

400
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,120
was reasonable.

401
00:23:58,570 --> 00:23:59,710
Your Highness,

402
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:02,440
I want to ask you a question.

403
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,250
Today, why did you bring
so many people to Yonghe Palace?

404
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:09,050
Zhi Lan!

405
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,310
The Noble Consort was initially
planning to go to the fabric warehouse.

406
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:16,180
She intentionally brought
the eunuchs to train them.

407
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,100
When we were passing Yonghe Palace,

408
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,540
she suddenly thought of
visiting Noble Lady Yu.

409
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,880
Who knew that upon entering the courtyard,

410
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,210
we saw Wei Ying Luo being panic-stricken.

411
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:27,660
From the looks of it,
Her Highness misunderstood it.

412
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,610
-She saw it wrongly.
-Saw it wrongly?

413
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:31,580
Can she falsely accuse
a good person because of that?

414
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,200
Who do you think you are?

415
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,820
Do you want Her Highness
to apologise to you?

416
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,500
Of course, I can't accept...

417
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,620
the apology of the Noble Consort.

418
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,610
But the Empress is well-deserving of it.

419
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,420
-You!
-All of you, shut up!

420
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,460
Noble Consort Gao,

421
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:54,650
what do you think?

422
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:02,370
Today,

423
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:05,180
I listened to the slander of a eunuch...

424
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,470
and blamed Your Majesty by mistake.

425
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:10,180
I acted rashly.

426
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,890
Your Majesty is a magnanimous person.

427
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,960
Please forgive me.

428
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:17,620
Not only did you falsely accuse me,

429
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,120
you almost killed Wei Ying Luo by mistake.

430
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:25,470
Return to your Chuxiu Palace...

431
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,760
and reflect on your mistakes.

432
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,840
Let's go.

433
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,190
It was all my fault.

434
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,000
When Noble Lady woke up today,
she didn't look good.

435
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,810
She said that she tasted
bitterness in her mouth.

436
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,980
She ordered me to go to the kitchen...

437
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,680
to get her a bowl of
red date and lotus root soup.

438
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:52,120
I actually believed it.

439
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,540
I'm a fool.

440
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:56,850
I almost cause harm to her.

441
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:57,960
Enough.

442
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,240
If the Noble Lady wanted
to drive you away intentionally.

443
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,940
she would naturally come up
with a lot of reasons.

444
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,410
Wipe away your tears.

445
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:08,440
Don't disturb the imperial physician
who is currently examining her.

446
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,900
Your Majesty, don't worry.

447
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:13,810
Noble Lady Yu is blessed by the heavens.

448
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:16,590
She's temporarily
unconscious, but is safe.

449
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:19,120
Noble Lady, you're awake.

450
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,290
Noble Lady.

451
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,650
Noble Lady Yu.

452
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,770
Don't kill me!

453
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,740
-I beg you, don't kill me!
-Noble Lady!

454
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:36,450
Don't kill me...

455
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,040
Noble Lady Yu was traumatised.

456
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:44,530
I can only prescribe some sedatives
so she can rest well.

457
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:46,980
Okay.

458
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,290
I beg you, don't kill me...

459
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:53,620
Don't kill me.

460
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,330
Young Master.

461
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,090
This medicine is
good for superficial wounds.

462
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:12,420
Apply it two times a day.

463
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,250
Why are you avoiding me?

464
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,320
A man mustn't stare at a woman's body.

465
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:22,150
Apply it by yourself.

466
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,920
Thank you, Young Master.

467
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,400
It hurts.

468
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,680
I'm done.

469
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,380
You can turn around now.

470
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,320
I have questions to ask you.

471
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,750
Go ahead.

472
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,440
Why did you light the curtain on fire?

473
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:22,720
Do you know that if you weren't careful,

474
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,250
you might be burned and die?

475
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:26,810
I know that it was very dangerous.

476
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:29,140
But in that situation,

477
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:32,790
that is the only way
I could lure other people to come.

478
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:35,620
Young Master, try thinking this way.

479
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,510
If I merely shouted that
the Noble Consort...

480
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:39,090
was trying to kill someone,

481
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,090
who would dare charge into Yonghe Palace?

482
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:45,320
Those people are all afraid
of something like that.

483
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,150
They would only pretend to not hear it.

484
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,770
But if the palace was on fire,
that would be different.

485
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,900
Everyone will come to put out the fire.

486
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,680
Then,

487
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,340
Noble Consort Yu and I...

488
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,430
would have a chance to be saved.

489
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:01,870
What if Noble Consort was able to...

490
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:04,470
charge into the room
before everyone arrives?

491
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,160
Just do what one can do ...

492
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:09,290
and leave the rest to heaven's will.

493
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,950
If the heavens wanted me dead,

494
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,800
I can only accept my fate.

495
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,170
If you really accept your fate,

496
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,880
you wouldn't be so bold...

497
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:20,990
as to openly question the Noble Consort.

498
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,110
I...

499
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,940
If the Empress wasn't there,

500
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,980
I wouldn't dare to do it either.

501
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:33,670
I was just a fox assuming
the majesty of the tiger,

502
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:36,550
pretending to be fierce
because I have a backer.

503
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,620
It's my first time hearing you laugh.

504
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,850
This is improper too?

505
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:53,890
Yes.

506
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,180
Didn't your mother teach you...

507
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,810
the proper etiquette for a lady
from a respectable family?

508
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:01,030
I'm not a lady from a respectable family.

509
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,430
And I don't have a mother.

510
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:08,920
I'm sorry.

511
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,320
As soon as I was born,

512
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,620
my mother died.

513
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:16,950
Everyone said I brought
bad luck to my family.

514
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:18,310
But it's fine.

515
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:20,740
My sister was like a mother to me.

516
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:23,980
She was the most
important person in my life.

517
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:28,250
I didn't know...

518
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:31,200
Being born, aging, getting sick, and
dying are common occurrences in life.

519
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,060
What's there to apologise about?

520
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,680
Thank you, Young Master,
for your medicine.

521
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,990
I'm deeply grateful.

522
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:51,570
The Empress most likely
still has questions to ask me.

523
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:52,900
I will take my leave now.

524
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:00,850
Young Master, do you know Man?

525
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:12,090
I do not know her.

526
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,490
But you look like...

527
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,490
you know her.

528
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,490
I already said that I don't know her.

529
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,730
That's too bad then.

530
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:30,050
Man...

531
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:32,420
is my older sister.

532
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:40,440
I was bold and reckless.

533
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,090
I almost brought Your Majesty trouble.

534
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:45,590
Please punish me.

535
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:51,600
Rise.

536
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:54,780
Yes.

537
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:02,050
Today, if it wasn't for you,

538
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:04,240
I would never be able to...

539
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:06,810
remove this stain on my reputation.

540
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,580
Your Majesty,

541
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:13,690
I'm guessing...

542
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:16,930
that eunuch who tried to commit murder...

543
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:18,400
was sent by Noble Consort.

544
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,960
Or else, she wouldn't have arrived
at such perfect timing.

545
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,650
She was the first one
to arrive to the scene.

546
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:24,280
Once Noble Lady Yu dies,

547
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:28,270
they would then claim that she hanged
herself and committed suicide.

548
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:30,400
Smooth everything out just like that.

549
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,720
Noble Consort Gao not
only wanted to kill Noble Lady Yu,

550
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,780
she also wanted to personally see...

551
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,470
her dead body.

552
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:41,090
It shows how savage she is...

553
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,490
in the palace.

554
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:47,240
She has become extremely unrestrained.

555
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,910
She didn't expect...

556
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:52,890
you'd arrive before her
and hindered her plan.

557
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,690
She could only push
the boat with current...

558
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:56,970
and blamed everything on me.

559
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:58,670
Your Majesty,

560
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,940
why don't we report
all of this to His Majesty?

561
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,540
His Majesty can handle it...

562
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,200
The murderer eunuch is dead.

563
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,690
We don't have a witness.

564
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:11,100
Just our words against hers,
no evidence to back it up.

565
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,800
Moreover, for this incident,

566
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:16,710
Noble Lady Yu committed a grave mistake.

567
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,110
You're talking about...

568
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:22,210
Noble Lady Yu making offerings
to Imperial Concubine Yi?

569
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:25,620
Noble Lady Yu and Imperial Concubine Yi
had always been close,

570
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,860
like real sisters.

571
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:29,100
Imperial Concubine Yi died because of her.

572
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,360
She must've felt anxious because of it.

573
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,720
It happen to be the forty-ninth day
of Imperial Concubine Yi's death.

574
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,330
She drove away the people around her
and stayed in the hall alone...

575
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:39,340
so that...

576
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:42,430
she can hold a memorial ceremony
for an old friend.

577
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:43,920
But in the palace,

578
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:46,720
memorial ceremonies
can only be held for...

579
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,720
the master of the Forbidden Palace.

580
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,370
Noble Lady Yu's actions...

581
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:54,960
putting it lightly,
was just breaking palace rules.

582
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,600
But to put it gravely,

583
00:33:57,130 --> 00:34:00,820
it was openly cursing the Emperor
and Empress Dowager.

584
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,530
Noble Consort Gao was certain about this,

585
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:06,380
hence, she acted boldly.

586
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,380
So,

587
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,820
in order to protect Noble Lady Yu,

588
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:13,610
we mustn't escalate this matter.

589
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,350
Your Majesty, you are kind.

590
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,440
I am deeply moved.

591
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,290
I also am not doing this
just for Noble Lady Yu.

592
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:24,370
It's more for the child in her womb.

593
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:27,870
I really don't want the child
to face cold stares,

594
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:31,690
curses, and discrimination
upon getting born.

595
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:36,100
But Ying Luo, since
Noble Consort Gao failed this time,

596
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:38,830
with her domineering personality,

597
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,790
she wouldn't let it go easily.

598
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:44,110
I'm just worried...

599
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:47,870
she'll make things difficult
for you in the future.

600
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,699
Your Majesty,

601
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,550
even without this matter,

602
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,409
Noble Consort will not let me off.

603
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,240
It doesn't matter anymore.

604
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:00,390
Your Highness, forgive me!

605
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:01,810
Useless!

606
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,370
You couldn't even do things properly.

607
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,750
How did I instruct you?

608
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:08,640
How did you carry out the plan?

609
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,470
You couldn't even suppress
a lowly palace maid.

610
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:13,710
This matter almost got escalated.

611
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,920
I feed you people good
food and drink every day.

612
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:18,840
I should've fed a dog instead!

613
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,520
Your Highness.

614
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:26,390
Imperial Concubine Jia,
please help me out.

615
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:27,670
Hurry and get up.

616
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:33,700
Your Highness,

617
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,950
I've heard about what happened earlier.

618
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,390
Don't be angry now.

619
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:48,850
Don't be angry?

620
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:53,070
The Empress has been
extending her hand to such a great length.

621
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:56,700
It wasn't easy to place Xiao Lu Zi
in Yonghe Palace.

622
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,200
We learnt that Noble Lady Yu secretly
made offerings to Imperial Concubine Yi.

623
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:05,370
Previously, I've said
let's just directly expose her.

624
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:07,740
It was you who said
to eliminate the grass by the roots,

625
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,480
so I asked Xiao Lu Zi to act.

626
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,150
Your Highness, this...

627
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,630
I never expected that...

628
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,070
Xiao Lu Zi was so incompetent.

629
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:18,040
He couldn't even suppress a palace maid.

630
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,770
If I'd known this would happen,

631
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:23,530
I would've just expose
Noble Lady Yu and make her helpless.

632
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,630
But now, great.

633
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:28,440
I'm left not knowing what to do.

634
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,060
It's making me mad.

635
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:34,440
Your Highness, don't be angry.

636
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,890
We did gain something from this.

637
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:40,970
I heard that Noble Lady Yu
got traumatised so badly.

638
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,320
It's still a big question whether
the baby can be born safely.

639
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,350
The Empress...

640
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:49,720
ordered the imperial physicians
to treat her in shifts.

641
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,720
The whole Yonghe Palace is a big mess.

642
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:58,190
Although that is the case,

643
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,890
I am still mad.

644
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,410
What is that?

645
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,840
Your Highness, this is a Pekingese.

646
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:13,920
Young Lord Gao especially sent it to
the palace to relieve you of boredom.

647
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:18,470
He still remembers he has a little sister?

648
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,180
Your Highness, you can really joke.

649
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:23,200
Young Lord Gao always thinks of you.

650
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,970
He trained this Pekingese personally.

651
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,060
Look.

652
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,990
Good thing he still cares.

653
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:44,800
This Pekingese is like a pile of snow.

654
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:47,420
Let's call it Snowball then.

655
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,520
Assign someone to feed it.
You mustn't treat it badly.

656
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,060
Of course I won't.

657
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:56,220
I will ensure that it is trained
to become smart, energetic and adorable.

658
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,510
You may leave.

659
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:58,610
Yes.

660
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:14,840
Your Highness really has
outstanding and great fortune.

661
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:18,100
Lord Gao is now the Minister
of Imperial Household Department...

662
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,880
and Viceroy of Southern Rivers.

663
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,070
Young Lord Gao is also
moving up the ranks.

664
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,740
His Majesty has successively rewarded him.

665
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:26,190
He's one of the highly-favoured officials
of His Majesty at present.

666
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:29,060
Having this kind of great fortune,

667
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:32,300
who else would dare compete with you?

668
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,800
Your Highness, you shouldn't be angry
just because of a lowly person.

669
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,500
But...

670
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,110
His Majesty has just scolded
Zhang Ting Yu and Ortai,

671
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:48,010
and now he's heavily
favouring the Gao family.

672
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,550
Isn't that self-conflicting?

673
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:52,200
Well...

674
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,530
I don't understand either.

675
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:58,980
But, my guess is...

676
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,340
His Majesty did this to placate them.

677
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,600
So that they can be at ease in doing
their jobs and stay loyal to the nation.

678
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,730
After all, both Lord Gaos
are pillars of the government.

679
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:13,320
That is also because
my father and brother are capable.

680
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:17,580
Hence, His Majesty favoured them heavily.

681
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,270
Guess what I went to do earlier.

682
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,800
Didn't you handle the corpse
of the murderer eunuch?

683
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,770
That's right.

684
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:30,970
I skinned that man and
threw him into the mass burial site.

685
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:35,040
But I never expected that man
to have wounds all over.

686
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,720
Especially on his neck and head.

687
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:40,390
The injuries on
the two areas are quite deep.

688
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:43,880
How could a little palace maid
have such a cruel heart...

689
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,170
and acted viciously?

690
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:47,880
If someone wanted to kill you,
would you still hold back?

691
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:51,150
That's right too. But she attacked
directly without hesitation.

692
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:54,520
The resoluteness of how it was done
seem more like that of a man.

693
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,380
It doesn't seem to be from a woman.

694
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:59,120
[Young Master, do you know Man?]

695
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:02,510
[Man is my older sister.]

696
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,580
Fu Heng, look.

697
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,800
What is that?

698
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:10,450
That is Noble Consort Gao's pet dog.

699
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:15,450
I've only seen a man walking a dog,

700
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:16,970
never a dog walking a man.

701
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,890
This is so Western!

702
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:22,990
The dog of Noble Consort is
of course more noble than a servant.

703
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:25,980
How could a servant walk in front of it?

704
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:28,910
Those are the palace rules.

705
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,750
Noble Consort is highly favoured.

706
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:34,640
Her dog is more precious than a human.

707
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:40,530
Say, why do you think
His Majesty scolded Ortai first...

708
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:44,200
then promoted Gao Bin, an ally of Ortai?

709
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,530
Divide to conquer.

710
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:52,070
Suppressing Ortai and then
promoting Gao Bin...

711
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,870
is to split them.

712
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:57,190
To put it simply,

713
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:59,360
as the grace that
Gao Bin receives increases,

714
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,180
he surely will become overconfident.

715
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:03,440
And then Ortai would start to fear him.

716
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:06,740
How could a political party
tolerate having two leaders?

717
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:10,460
The two of them will
turn on each other sooner or later.

718
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:13,610
This is the check and
balance principle of an emperor.

719
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:16,360
You're a girl,

720
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:18,870
but you almost lost your life like that.

721
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:21,770
In that situation,

722
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,860
I had no more time to think.

723
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:26,520
You...

724
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,280
What must I say to you?

725
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,290
Madam.

726
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,050
I saw Fu Heng today.

727
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:38,950
He said that he never knew my sister.

728
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,050
You're still investigating this matter?

729
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:48,900
Based on her personality,

730
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:53,160
if she happened to pick up
a precious jade pendant like that,

731
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,160
she would've return it to the owner.

732
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:57,380
But she kept it instead.

733
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:00,990
There are only two possibilities.

734
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,820
One, it's her lover.

735
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,150
Otherwise, it's a person
she bears a grudge against.

736
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:07,570
She has a lover.

737
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,670
Even though she was
heartlessly abandoned by him,

738
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:12,200
she would never
have a change of heart easily.

739
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:15,250
Then there is only one possibility left.

740
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:18,160
Fu Heng raped my sister.
