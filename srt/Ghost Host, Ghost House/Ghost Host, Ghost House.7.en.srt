It's my first time seeing See-Nam play a guitar.

Thank you for all your help.
I'm sorry I bother you quite often.

you should see the doctor.

I'm so happy. I've never expected that.

Tell me about it first.
I don't know how to react now.

Well…

47
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:12,380
I was reached out to for a commercial.

48
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,290
And it's not even an extra role.

49
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,380
This is a main supporting role.

50
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,300
Seriously? What commercial is that?

51
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,420
Prawn crackers.

52
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:24,920
Are you going to be the prawn?

53
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,100
I'm willing to be the cracker.

54
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,540
I'm so glad.

55
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,260

56
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,250

You'll do a good job.

58
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,860
I'll take you there if they allow me to.

59
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,820
Am I going to be famous now?

60
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,140
I'm getting goosebumps.

61
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,985
Should I practice answering
interview questions now?

62
00:03:56,215 --> 00:03:57,910
Are you for real?

63
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:02,020
Hello, it's Pluem Pitipong.

64
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,920
If you want to take pics with me,
please turn off the flash.

65
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:18,170
I've heard that you became well-known
after taking a prawn cracker role?

66
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:26,980
That's correct. I've done my best
for every opportunity.

67
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:32,140
On the day I got the prawn cracker role,

68
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,700
I did my best like in any other role.

69
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:39,755
So it's not surprising that
this handsome, talented guy

70
00:04:39,755 --> 00:04:41,360
has come this far.

71
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,440
Wow…

72
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,380
You're not giving time
for others to compliment you.

73
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,760
I'm afraid no one will do that.

74
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:59,660
Oh, you have to go to the audition first
to know if you get that role, right?

75
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,965
Yes.

76
00:05:00,965 --> 00:05:04,401
They asked me to go next Monday.

77
00:05:04,401 --> 00:05:07,885
If I get this gig, I'll get to go to the beach.

78
00:05:07,885 --> 00:05:10,955
But they haven't told me where it is.

79
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,880
If I get this gig, come with me, alright?

80
00:05:23,975 --> 00:05:26,590
Please…

81
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,330
Please…

82
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:34,420
But it's a shooting set, isn't it?

83
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:37,005
Wouldn't I get in the way?

84
00:05:37,005 --> 00:05:43,765
Well, you can just wait for me there.

85
00:05:43,765 --> 00:05:48,960
And… You've never been
to a Thailand's beach, right?

86
00:05:49,995 --> 00:05:52,560
You'll be so in love with it, I promise.

87
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,060
You won't want to return to the States.

88
00:05:57,055 --> 00:06:00,520
But if I don't get this gig,

89
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,680
I'll save up so we can travel together.

90
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,930
You're not going back soon, right?

91
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,580
Umm…

92
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:21,300
So it's settled then. You'll be
there with me if I get this gig, right?

93
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,880
The beach?

94
00:06:28,035 --> 00:06:34,220
If you really get it,
can I take someone with me, too?

95
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,706
This is Auntie Jeab when she was young.

96
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,340
So beautiful.

97
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,560
Of course. My painting skill never fails.

98
00:07:06,455 --> 00:07:09,280
No, he referred to me.

99
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,700
Compliment your wife, sometimes.

100
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:20,160
You painted this when you were at the beach?

101
00:07:22,055 --> 00:07:28,700
No, the twins were born
before we could make the trip.

102
00:07:29,255 --> 00:07:31,780
Yes, the trip failed completely.

103
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:34,720
We had to handle with all the chaos then.

104
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:41,385
Then I'm pretty sure now
that my thought is right.

105
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,320
Would you like to go to the beach
for your honeymoon?

106
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:56,880
Maybe, that's your last mission.

107
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,520
What made you think a
honeymoon is our last mission?

108
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,530
I think I understand what Kevin thinks.

109
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:21,760
Kevin thinks that both of you
only focus on taking care of others

110
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,760
and forget to live like a couple.

111
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:29,500
And once you had kids, you
had to be a mother and a father

112
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:34,970
and forgot your roles as spouses.

113
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:40,100
I think the kids are right.

114
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:44,860
Since we had See-Nam and See-Foon,

115
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:49,880
we forgot to take care of our relationship.

116
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,340
We were busy fighting one another.

117
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,580
Actually, reminiscing some old memories
isn't a bad idea.

118
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:05,900
Honeymoon now? As ghosts?

119
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,890
Why not?

120
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:14,760
That way, even death can't do us part.

121
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,125
Okay. I'm in.

122
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,500
But we'll all have to go together.

123
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,125
Both of us will exchange our points
for the last day,

124
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:31,440
so both of you can see us there.

125
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,700
Is it really a good idea?

126
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:38,280
What if it isn't your last mission?

127
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,520
You're going to lose all of your points.

128
00:09:43,335 --> 00:09:44,720
No worries.

129
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,475
Even if it's not our last mission,
at least we can spend our last moment together.

130
00:09:49,475 --> 00:09:51,345
I'm okay with that.

131
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,840
I think so.

132
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:58,980
Since Kevin arrived,
we've not got any photo together.

133
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,505
Agree.

134
00:10:00,505 --> 00:10:03,967
Because we don't appear in photos, right?

135
00:10:03,967 --> 00:10:05,405
Yes.

136
00:10:06,055 --> 00:10:08,420
So I want you… Kevin.

137
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:13,180
I want you to see our happy moments.

138
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:16,210
Keep that your last memory of us

139
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:20,345
- before we disappear forever.
- That's right.

140
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,060
That's great. Let's go together.

141
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:55,680
I thought it was so-so at first.

142
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,921
But it's great, actually. Right, honey?

143
00:10:59,921 --> 00:11:04,126
Yeah. I don't know why I feel excited
all of a sudden.

144
00:11:08,694 --> 00:11:13,965
Auntie Jeab, Uncle Art.
How many hours do you have left?

145
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,785
More than enough.

146
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,640
They're enough for us to
see the sunset with you.

147
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:31,160
Hold on, don't you go shooting
the commercial, Pluem?

148
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,497
The shooting starts tomorrow.
I came here one day earlier.

149
00:11:34,497 --> 00:11:38,980
I knew you were going to get that role.

150
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,445
Good job, my dear.

151
00:11:41,445 --> 00:11:44,505
You're a star as you have wanted, huh?

152
00:11:45,314 --> 00:11:47,540
It's still a long way to go.

153
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:52,240
But how can I be unknown with
this handsome face?

154
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,415
Pluem, Kevin, go take a stroll.

155
00:12:00,415 --> 00:12:03,380
Let's meet up here later.

156
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:06,305
Or do you want a double date?

157
00:12:09,055 --> 00:12:11,500
I'm just kidding.

158
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:16,580
Look at you. I know you
want to spend time together.

159
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,966
I won't bother you anymore.

160
00:12:18,966 --> 00:12:21,020
Right?

161
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,920
Let me join you, please.

162
00:12:24,455 --> 00:12:25,840
I'm sick of Pluem now.

163
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,430
Hey.

164
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:30,420
Well.

165
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:34,670
Who asked me to call every single night?

166
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,505
Who asked me to be by your side
until you fall asleep?

167
00:12:37,505 --> 00:12:40,900
Why did you spill that?

168
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:45,060
That's enough. Stop fighting.

169
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,920
Our time is short.

170
00:12:49,475 --> 00:12:52,760
We'll go have fun. We can't wait.

171
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,820
Yes.

172
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:59,850
Don't forget to come back
this evening before the sunset.

173
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,010
Okay.

174
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:03,200
- We're going now.
- Okay.

175
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,645
See you later.

176
00:13:04,645 --> 00:13:07,485
We've got to go now, bye-bye.

177
00:13:11,435 --> 00:13:12,670
Want to go now?

178
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,050
Let's go.

179
00:13:58,955 --> 00:14:03,080
Dried squid… Do you want to try it?

180
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,760
How much is this?

181
00:14:23,727 --> 00:14:26,260
- You want take some pics?
- Okay.

182
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,320
Thank you.

183
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:23,160
You're done dressing up?

184
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,840
It's almost the time.

185
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,180
The sun almost sets.

186
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,740
You.

187
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,070
I don't want to go there…

188
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,480
Come with me.

189
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,690
They must want to see us there.

190
00:16:58,455 --> 00:17:01,500
Let's send Auntie Jeab
and Uncle Art off together.

191
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,640
I'll choose a necklace for you.

192
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,190
This one.

193
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,910
Let me see.

194
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,860
Let's go.

195
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,080
Let me see.

196
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,240
Your shirt is nice.

197
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,480
Your necklace is also nice.

198
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,640
You're just missing…

199
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:47,470
a sweet smile on your face.

200
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:09,240
You're just so cute.

201
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,660
Come on.

202
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,925
Are you okay, honey?

203
00:18:30,925 --> 00:18:33,245
It's the last day… Huh?

204
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:38,000
- I know, right.
- It's the last day.

205
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,655
Right.

206
00:18:39,655 --> 00:18:42,535
I would have come here when…

207
00:18:42,535 --> 00:18:44,595
Auntie Jeab, Uncle Art!

208
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,420
You…

209
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:57,220
We'd better stand right here from this far.

210
00:18:58,515 --> 00:19:00,040
Fold it up to your knees.

211
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,760
Are you okay, honey?

212
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,660
Slowly. Don't rush, honey.

213
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,160
Come on.

214
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,500
Hold my hands. Okay.

215
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,820
Let go of my hand. Let's sit up there.

216
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:38,020
I'll find a way up there.
Slow down, honey. You'll slip.

217
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,360
Slow down.

218
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,080
1… 2… Alright?

219
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,320
- Where is it?
- Okay…

220
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,000
That spot is better, honey.

221
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,505
I told you the view looked good from here.

222
00:19:50,505 --> 00:19:52,225
Here it is.

223
00:20:56,865 --> 00:20:58,280
That's all fine.

224
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:03,015
Even if it's not our last mission,
at least we can spend our last moments together.

225
00:21:03,015 --> 00:21:05,620
I'm okay with that.

226
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:10,165
You'll see our happy moment.

227
00:21:10,165 --> 00:21:13,425
Keep your last memories of us

228
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,600
- before we disappear forever.
- Yes.

229
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,870
I already sent everyone off.

230
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,080
Why don't I feel good at all?

231
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,490
How can it feel good?

232
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:25,360
In the end, it's still a loss.

233
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,660
Don't pretend like you're not sad.

234
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:34,400
Just know that you've done your best all along.

235
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,980
Don't feel sorry about it.

236
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:08,800
Anything else you want to do?

237
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,980
I don't want to go back to the hotel now.

238
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:27,120
Actually, there is something I want to do.

239
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,660
What is that?

240
00:23:32,215 --> 00:23:36,680
Well, taking a ride or two around town…

241
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,500
Something like that.

242
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,320
Just that?

243
00:23:46,535 --> 00:23:50,110
I rarely go on a trip.

244
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:52,880
Taking a tour will do me some good.

245
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,545
And another thing is…

246
00:23:55,545 --> 00:23:58,675
The sea at night has its own charm.

247
00:24:01,835 --> 00:24:04,600
I think there are still some mini-buses around.

248
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,521
I'll ask if we can rent one.

249
00:24:07,521 --> 00:24:12,272
That's a good idea. I want to
take a ride around town, too.

250
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,000
Let's go.

251
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,840
- Mister.
- Anything, sir?

252
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,621
- Is this available?
- Yes.

253
00:24:29,621 --> 00:24:31,680
Can you take us on a tour?

254
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,920
Alright.

255
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:36,945
- Can I ask you something?
- Tell me.

256
00:24:36,945 --> 00:24:38,445
Attach this.

257
00:24:39,455 --> 00:24:41,000
Awww.

258
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,660
- Make it obvious. Don't be subtle.
- Choose a spot.

259
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,520
This is great.

260
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,280
Attach it. Make it obvious.

261
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,900
- What about over there?
- Okay.

262
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,800
- Sure, I got you.
- Thank you.

263
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,080
- Let's get on the bus.
- Alright.

264
00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:00,490
The night sea hits different…

265
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,640
Not bad.

266
00:26:04,485 --> 00:26:06,200
I've seen one more beautiful than that.

267
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,860
Where?

268
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,130
Right here.

269
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,440
I'll bite your finger off.

270
00:27:20,125 --> 00:27:24,390
How is it? Is that kissing scene good to go?

271
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:26,501
- Ouch..
- Well.

272
00:27:26,501 --> 00:27:28,905
It hurts.

273
00:27:28,905 --> 00:27:30,995
So stop being a pervert.

274
00:27:40,015 --> 00:27:42,940
- Pluem…
- Huh?

275
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,900
I still haven't thanked you.

276
00:27:54,088 --> 00:27:59,680
Since I've been here,
you've always helped me out.

277
00:28:01,239 --> 00:28:04,120
You pick me up and drop me off.

278
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,250
Come after me to dangerous places.

279
00:28:07,016 --> 00:28:09,866
And you've been with me through thick and thin.

280
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:19,340
I just… I want to be the person
you'll see when you turn around.

281
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,300
Thank you, Pluem.

282
00:28:39,255 --> 00:28:41,220
Hey, UFO…

283
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,810
What? Where?

284
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:47,800
[Will you be my boyfriend?]

285
00:28:55,792 --> 00:28:58,522
Will you?

286
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,460
For all that time…

287
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,920
You've not felt anything?

288
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,740
Of course, I have.

289
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,800
Overwhelmingly, actually.

290
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,380
I just…

291
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,220
Can you give me some time?

292
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,220
What time do you need?

293
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,950
Time to forget him?

294
00:30:01,314 --> 00:30:03,846
Or time to love me?

295
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:14,440
Jake?

296
00:30:16,566 --> 00:30:18,996
You can't forget him, right?

297
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,660
No.

298
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,440
The question should be…

299
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:31,180
I still can't make you forget, right?

300
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,190
Are you scared?

301
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,200
Then just don't watch it.

302
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,080
I'm not scared…

303
00:31:21,871 --> 00:31:23,570
If we die,

304
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:27,890
will we become ghosts?

305
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,510
Maybe…

306
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,500
if we still have worries.

307
00:31:39,935 --> 00:31:43,860
If you die,

308
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,600
will you disappear or…

309
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,940
stay around as a ghost?

310
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,130
I might be a ghost then.

311
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:58,980
Really? What are your worries?

312
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,940
I'm worried about you.

313
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,060
I can take care of myself.

314
00:32:11,755 --> 00:32:14,440
Don't treat me like a kid.

315
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,565
You're sure of that?

316
00:32:16,565 --> 00:32:20,455
I do everything for you though.

317
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,400
So

318
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:36,510
if you die one day,

319
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,900
You'll be by my side as a ghost, right?

320
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,720
Well,

321
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:51,140
please take care of me until I'm 80.

322
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,030
Isn't that too long?

323
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:57,440
You won't let me move on?

324
00:32:59,335 --> 00:33:02,500
Well, how about…

325
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:08,095
I'll be there until you find someone
who loves you and takes care of you.

326
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,970
My worries

327
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:16,180
will be gone by then.

328
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:55,270
Hi, Mrs. Kim.

329
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:57,300
