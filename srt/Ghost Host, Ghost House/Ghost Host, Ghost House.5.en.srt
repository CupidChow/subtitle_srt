I'm going to work today.

Can I tag along?

00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,500
Pluem, you're here with your boyfriend today?

Hey, I'm not his boyfriend.

20
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,770
I read through a myth

21
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:06,560
a way to scare off the ghosts

22
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,443
is… to get naked.

23
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,080
Why are you so passionate about ghosts?

24
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,380
I saw you… use every single way to see ghosts.

25
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,920

28

Kevin,

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,260
you invited us to your house, or did you want us to sit here and watch you sigh?

30
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,860
Don't say that to my kid. He might be worried about something.

31
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,300
Is that right, baby Kevin?

32
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,180
I haven't said anything to your baby Kevin.

33
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:48,060
I just wanted to say that it's been awhile since the GGG gang got to meet like this.

34
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,520
But your precious boy is looking grumpy, that's not fair.

35
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,320
Nothing is wrong with me.

36
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,000
So, will Sun join us?

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,140
He's running errands. He'll join us afterward.

38
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:05,000
Maybe, he's afraid to meet the famous Kevin.

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,380
Nonsense.

40
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,600
My PK is far behind yours.

41
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,880
Don't change the subject.

42
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,090
Look at your sad face.

43
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:19,600
With such a face, your boyfriend dumped you. Right?

44
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,740
He… He's not my boyfriend yet.

45
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,720
That's right. He definitely isn't dating anyone.

46
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,500
My boy is still 3 years old.

47
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,280
Can you stop acting like his mommy and start acting like his friend?

48
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,800
It's nothing, actually.

49
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,000
I just don't get it...

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,160
why he is acting strange out of the blue.

51
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,600
He doesn't reply to my texts or answer my calls.

52
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,420
Before that, he was perfectly normal.

53
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,366
Have you guys done the dirty?

54
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,540
Oh, I'm about to pass out.

55
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,820
I've raised him since he was 3.

56
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,140
Don't overrect.

57
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,340
His body, his choice.

58
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:19,760
Plus, sex isn't a bad thing

59
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,060
if both parties consent to it…

60
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:26,020
No, what if that guy ditches him after that?

61
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,800
Isn't it obvious, disappearing like that?

62
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:39,360
Let me put it this way. Go meet him.

63
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,520
Talk it out.

64
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,670
Texting or calling

65
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:47,540
isn't as good as talking in person.

66
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,420
Plus, he will see that

67
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:53,840
he's so important to you that you want to see him.

68
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,060
You didn't expect me to give such great advice?

69
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,860
But… isn't it odd if I just show up?

70
00:04:07,237 --> 00:04:09,940
Buy him something and wait for him.

71
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,358
When he comes home,

72
00:04:11,358 --> 00:04:16,660
make sparkling eyes and tell him you want to have a talk.

73
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,020
I think he'll give in and talk to you.

74
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,880
But if he doesn't love you, come back to my embrace, boy.

75
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,890
Yes, we'll go ghost hunting with you.

76
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:31,220
That's consolation from us.

77
00:04:51,926 --> 00:04:54,480
Where have you been?

78
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,920
Why didn't you pick up my calls?

79
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,620
I bought you instant noodles.

80
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:05,880
I know you like to put them in dishes.

81
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,000
Aren't you going out after this?

82
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:20,840
Can you make me fried rice and instant noodles?

83
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,367
What's wrong, Pluem?

84
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,760
If you don't say anything, I won't go back.

85
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,380
We have to clear this up today.

86
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,000
If you want to talk, go outside.

87
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,060
What's happening with you?

88
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,900
Did I do something wrong?

89
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,200
Or…

90
00:06:14,238 --> 00:06:17,940
did my family do something wrong?

91
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:22,040
I've not seen you around Auntie Jeab's house.

92
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,500
Probably.

93
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,787
They asked you to work too hard?

94
00:06:30,787 --> 00:06:33,259
They did something you're not okay with?

95
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:35,560
My dad's dead because of them.

96
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,360
They told us they hit a car.

97
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,400
That car is a grey pick-up truck, isn't it?

98
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,500
The car they hit…

99
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,340
was my dad's.

100
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,183
I was curious about it.

101
00:07:05,183 --> 00:07:08,483
The canal path on a rainy day,

102
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,480
exactly a month before your arrival.

103
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,300
Everything they said added up.

104
00:07:20,197 --> 00:07:24,423
Who knows the family I gardened for,

105
00:07:24,423 --> 00:07:28,346
delivered food and drinks to every day…

106
00:07:29,328 --> 00:07:30,848
Damn it.

107
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,880
Turned out, that's the other party I've been looking for.

108
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,780
And they have the audacity to come back as ghosts.

109
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,000
Calm down.

110
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,540
I think Jeab and her family don't know about this.

111
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,280
Right.

112
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,880
They don't even know a damn thing.

113
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,100
They don't even care...

114
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,750
who the driver in that car...

115
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,700
was,

116
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,940
who else was in that car,

117
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,800
who got injured,

118
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,700
or who died from that accident.

119
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,320
Since my father passed away,

120
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,200
Prim has talked to no one.

121
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,260
Not even with me.

122
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,100
Pluem…

123
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,240
Can we have a normal talk?

124
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,220
Then you answer me.

125
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,360
Why isn't it my dad who came back?

126
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,840
My sister and I

127
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,540
do we not have the right to meet our dad?

128
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,270
Give me a reason.

129
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,840
Answer me.

130
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,500
I don't know.

131
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,700
I really don't have a clue.

132
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,840
Maybe, it's like what you said,

133
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,420
Auntie Jeab and her family cared about me so much.

134
00:09:14,728 --> 00:09:16,208
What do you mean?

135
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,120
You're saying my dad didn't?

136
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,420
That's not what I'm saying.

137
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:27,100
I don't even know the reason ehy this happened.

138
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:30,560
How can I give you an answer?

139
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,620
Your father's car also hit my family's, didn't it?

140
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,680
It wasn't just your dad who died.

141
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,350
And you think I don't know how painful it is...

142
00:09:55,020 --> 00:10:00,220
to desperately want to see someone who has passed?

143
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:18,080
But you've still got me, Pluem.

144
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,113
You don't have to get through this all alone.

145
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,540
Just like what you said to me.

146
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:28,300
You said you'd never let me be sad alone.

147
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,620
Can you forget…

148
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:44,120
the bygones?

149
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,580
Forget about it?

150
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,920
I don't mean that…

151
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,480
You know what?

152
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,580
If I could go back in time,

153
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,820
I would like for us to have never met,

154
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,720
so that I don't need to feel guilty about my dad.

155
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:41,640
I just started to feel like this as home...

156
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:46,540
because you're here and so are the others.

157
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:50,740
And out of the blue, this happened.

158
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,440
I lost Auntie Jeab and her family.

159
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,280
And now, I'm going to lose you?

160
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,080
I never wanted it to be this way.

161
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,300
Is it so wrong...

162
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,000
if I don't want to understand anyone?

163
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,220
I don't want to forgive anyone.

164
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,460
Go back.

165
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,900
We have nothing else to talk about.

166
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:48,260
I will tell myself that…

167
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,708
you're acting like this because of the sorrow.

168
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,400
If I don't,

169
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,940
I won't be able to understand…

170
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,980
why you're so mean to me.

171
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,686
[Where have you been?]

172
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,120
You don't need to know everything.

173
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,220
Go out, Prim.

174
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:32,207
Do you know what I've been through today?

175
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,748
You want to talk to me?

176
00:14:35,748 --> 00:14:37,820
Why don't you speak?

177
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,460
The doctor said you can speak.

178
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,440
Why don't you speak?

179
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:55,100
Why? You're feeling down?

180
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,120
Are you in pain?

181
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,780
Or you're feeling guilty about being the reason Dad is dead?

182
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,600
You think it's only you feeling that way?

183
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,380
The person who died wasn't only your dad.

184
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,260
He was also my dad..

185
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,047
I'm tired.

186
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,020
I can't bear with this anymore.

187
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,320
I'm not as good as you, Dad.

188
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:43,820
Why didn't they let me die instead of you?

189
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,700
[Are you tired?]

190
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,390
[Are you tired?]

191
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,440
Prim…

192
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,900
[You're great just like Dad.]

193
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,300
I'm not that great.

194
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,520
He was much stronger than I am.

195
00:17:02,447 --> 00:17:07,287
[Now, you're the dad for me.]

[SomPanPan Lv.1: "Why do you look odd?"]

197
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,960
"Why do you look odd?"

198
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,620
I'm heartbroken, I guess.

199
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,400
I'm just kidding, you guys.

200
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,960
I just want to change the mood and tone.

201
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,920
[SomPanPan Lv.1: "Just kidding means not kidding."]

202
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,380
"Just kidding means not kidding."

203
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,280
It's really just a joke.

204
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,680
I have had stressful things on my mind lately.

205

207
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:47,940
All right… let me consult you about something.

208
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,400
I'm feeling guilty to a friend of mine.

209
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,928
But it isn't really my fault.

210
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,880
But when I saw him sad,

211
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,300
I felt sad, too.

214
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,300
I think so.

215
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:23,280
I shouldn't have felt this way, right?

I know what might work, actually.

228
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:08,600

I'll think it through again.

See you later, bye-bye.

238
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:08,158
Why are you sitting here by yourself?

239
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,340
I just got lost in my thoughts.

240
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,006
But you seem down.

241
00:21:18,006 --> 00:21:20,149
Are you thinking of anyone?

242
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,440
Yeah, in that ballpark.

243
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:32,420
Is that person your old friend

244
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:38,520
or someone you've been longing to see?

245

See-Foon, who are you referring to?

Well…

247
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,260
See-Foon.

248
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:52,420
I told you not to bother Kevin.

249
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,380
He might want to sit here alone.

250
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,300
He's not bothering me.

251
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:10,060
But… you seem so down, lately.

252
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,920
Do you want our help?

253
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,900
No.

254
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:26,660
I'll find a way out myself soon.

255
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,720
Well…

256
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,560
Aren't you going ghost hunting?

257
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,880
You've only stayed at home, lately.

258
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,020
Where is Pluem?

259
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:47,140
Why doesn't he come visit us?

260
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:53,540
Well, he might be busy right now.

261
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,640
Come here.

262
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,680
Why are you dragging me here?

263
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,300
I'd like to call for a sibling secret meeting.

264
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,360
What? You're stirring up trouble again?

265
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,923
Oh, I can be serious, too, you know?

266
00:23:37,923 --> 00:23:41,983
I just want you to help me help Kevin.

267
00:23:41,983 --> 00:23:45,500
How?

268
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:55,820
I happened to know that
Kevin wanted to meet someone.

269
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:58,480
He was his best friend
when he studied abroad.

270
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,680
But he passed away.

271
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:05,200
That's why he's interested in
this ghost thing.

272
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,880
So he has been trying to
summon the ghosts.

273
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:14,560
How can you know about that?

274
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,160
I got into his dream.

275
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:22,000
So… I kinda know everything.

276
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:26,880
You never listen to what I say?

277
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,880
How many merit points do you have left?

278
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,940
Let me see.

279
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,648
8,000?

280
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:44,248
You had over 20,000 at first.

281
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:49,640
Well, I did so many things.

282
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,000
Don't scold me now.

283
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,050
We're talking about Kevin, alright?

284
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,480
That's the point.

285
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:04,560
After I learned that
Kevin hasn't met that person yet,

286
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:08,360
I realized that there was a way

287
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:12,580
people can see the dead.

288
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:15,440
I have asked the staff about it.

289
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,500
It's like an evocation.

290
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:24,070
But it requires…

291
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,070
12,000 points.

292
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,200
That many?

293
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,840
Of course, it's a huge ritual.

294
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,100
But…

295
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,307
My points are not enough now.

296
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:47,577
Can I get 4,000 from you?

297
00:25:47,577 --> 00:25:49,980
I remember you have around 10 thousand?

298
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,040
Are you insane?

299
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,940
If you borrow 4,000 points from me,

300
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,040
you'll have to pay another 8,000…

301
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,340
That's all you got, Foon.

302
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,100
It's my plan, you know.

303
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,420
I have to pay the bulk of it.

304
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:14,230
What will it happen
after your points are gone?

305
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:16,460
Disappearing?

306
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,700
Probably.

307
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:27,960
But that's OK.

308
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,620
I'm already dead anyway.

309
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,820
I don't have anything else I want to do.

310
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,760
But I know you still do.

311
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:48,000
Give me just 4,000 points.

312
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:52,370
And use the rest for whatever
you want to do.

313
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,910
You know, there is a "Last Day" rule.

314
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:01,740
I asked the staff about it.

315
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:04,685
If you want to get "Last Day,"

316
00:27:04,685 --> 00:27:07,220
you must exchange it with all your points

317
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:10,060
to complete your last mission.

318
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:14,640
And that will allow us to appear to anyone.

319
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:20,190
We will get exempted from spirit
world rules to complete this final mission.

320
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,920
The duration depends on your merit points.

321
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,040
If we have many points left,

322
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:33,300
we'll have several hours to do it.

323
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:39,720
But if we can't complete the mission in time,

324
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,400
we will disappear right away.

325
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,800
That's why it's named "Last Day."

326
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:54,770
It's for spirits that want to finish
their business for the last time.

327
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,220
We have to take this risk.

328
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,220
Well, as I said, keep some for Last Day.

329
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:08,520
The more points you have, the longer you get.

330
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,700
Half-half.

331
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,290
Half-half?

332
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:31,880
If you don't agree to this, I'm not in.

333
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,860
Are you sure you're okay about this?

334
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,980
That's 6,000 points.

335
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:44,423
I have 10,000 left. You have only 8,000 left.

336
00:28:44,423 --> 00:28:46,723
Why are you still worried about me?

337
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,760
Let's say,

338
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:58,140
it's the our family's
last gift to Kevin.

339
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,260
Here.

340
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:40,283
Pluem, take table 3's order for me.

341
00:29:40,283 --> 00:29:42,243
Alright, boss.

342
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,080
Uh…

343
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,280
What do you want to order?

344
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,900
- I want…
- Pluem.

345
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,169
Tables 8 and 9, too.

346
00:30:01,169 --> 00:30:02,103
Roger that, boss.

347
00:30:02,103 --> 00:30:05,843
I'll write the order myself,
you go help the others.

348
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:14,700
Hurry up. What do they want to eat?

349
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:18,848
Wait for me, please. I'm about to read it.

350
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,960
1 duck Larb,

351
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,300
1 Soi Ju, 1 sticky rice.

352
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,420
And… See you tonight.
[At the High Shrine. Bring your dad's things.]

353
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:31,460
- Huh?
- What's wrong with you?

354
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,800
Where are you taking me to?

355
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,960
Nothing.

356
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,580
Just the duck Larb and Soi Ju.

357
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,640
Uh…

358
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,720
Why are you standing here all alone?

359
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:21,080
I'm with See-Nam and See-Foon.

360
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:26,940
But I can't see them now.

361
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:35,300
See-Nam and See-Foon said
they had a present for me.

362
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:40,640
That's an evocation.

363
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,320
They wanted me to meet my old dead friend.

364
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,300
How?

365
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,980
You want me to be your witness?

366
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,200
Pluem…

367
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:07,400
I'm giving this gift to you.

368
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,760
I'll let you see your dad once again.

369
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,606
Why are you doing this for me?

370
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,140
I told you the reason already.

371
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,300
If I could choose,

372
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:33,620
I'd want you to meet your dad.

373
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:40,850
You said it was impossible.

374
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:45,430
But it is now.

375
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:47,820
I'm going to do what I promised you.

376
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,360
Are you sure about this?

377
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:59,800
Well, what about that friend
you've wanted to see…

378
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,100
I'm sure of my decision.

379
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:14,180
You'll not regret it later, right?

380
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,680
Of course not.

381
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:29,100
Well, did you bring your dad's belonging?

382
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,740
Yes, I did.

383
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:36,100
What do I need to do now?

384
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:41,400
Uh… See-Foon told me
to call the staff out.

385
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:45,383
I've been here for a while now.

386
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:48,125
I saw you not done talking yet.

387
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,820
Isn't he supposed to be
in a traditional Thai outfit?

388
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,980
Sometimes, actually. Only on Fridays.

389
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:08,540
But normally people aren't this nosy
about our attire.

390
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,420
Do you still want to do the ritual?

391
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,560
Give me the dead's belonging.

392
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:17,000
The twins already have
redeemed their points for you.

393
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,120
Hey.

394
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:32,820
I needed to burn it. It's part of the ritual.

395
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:36,700
We have to sacrifice the dead's belonging.

396
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,780
Now, close your eyes.

397
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:44,300
Say the name of the person you want to meet
3 times to yourself.

398
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,280
Summon him.

399
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:14,760
Now you wait. He'll appear before
this candle is extinguished.

400
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:20,280
No one is coming.

401
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:25,540
If he doesn't show up,
that means he's not coming.

402
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:31,900
What do you mean by that?

403
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,120
That's cheating.

404
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,120
Give the points back to us.

405
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,820
Stop thinking I'm playing tricks.

406
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:43,100
This ritual is a door to the Spirit Realm

407
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,620
which will summon the person you want to see.

408
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:49,800
If he doesn't show up, he's already gone.

409
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,440
What do you mean by that?

410
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,903
The spirit has no worries about
people in this world.

411
00:37:54,903 --> 00:37:57,443
He's now on his own path.

412
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:01,830
And I think the person understanding

413
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:05,520
his absence the best is you.

414
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:22,167
Pluem, are you okay?

415
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,490
Pluem.

416
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:27,390
Pluem.

417
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:29,000
Pluem.

418
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,300
Pluem…

419
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:38,643
Why are you hiding here?
People are looking for you.

420
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:43,140
Stop crying. How many days have you cried?

421
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,780
I'm sad. What should I do?

422
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:50,420
Aren't you sad over mom's death?

423
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:59,380
You know, her being gone has many good points.

424
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:02,200
How can there be good points?

425
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,500
There are, of course.

426
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,820
Everything that happens has good points in it.

427
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:11,260
How? Mom is dead.

428
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,580
There are so many good points to mentioned.

429
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,740
She helps us become stronger.

430
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:18,540
She helps us see the value of time.

431
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:22,600
And now, we can keep mom in our memory

432
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,360
where she'll be forever.

433
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,820
Aren't you angry for her death?

434
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:32,580
With whom? Your mom?

435
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:35,780
Anyone. You can blame the heaven.

436
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:38,540
Will she return if we are?

437
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,926
Then we'd better not be.

438
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,160
Do you want to come home now?

439
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:58,700
Pluem, promise me one thing.

440
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:01,140
One day, when I pass away,

441
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:05,980
you will get through it no matter what.

442
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:09,152
Get through it? What does it mean?

443
00:40:09,152 --> 00:40:11,460
Live your life happily.

444
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,860
You mean… I can't be sad?

445
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:18,380
I can't do that.

446
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:21,100
I never tell you not to be sad.

447
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:25,660
The strongest ones can be weak, sometimes.

448
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:28,300
But you have to restrain yourself
from being sad.

449
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:32,000
Keep the sorrow in a box,

450
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,900
like this.

451
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:49,620
You'll leave me as mom did one day?

452
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:52,400
You don't love my sister and me anymore?

453
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:57,100
I'll leave you because I love you.

454
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:01,060
I believe you can live with it
so I won't be worried

455
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:03,520
and so I can move on.

456
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:59,620
Do you understand now why he didn't appear?

457
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:31,820
Alright. Do you still think I'm cheating?

458
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:37,460
I'd better leave now.

459
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:40,080
See-Nam, follow me.

460
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:49,680
Why don't you tell your brother
you have less than 10 thousand points?

461
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,584
With 6,000 deducted your have hundreds now.

462
00:43:53,584 --> 00:43:55,900
How many more days can you last?

463
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,328
I feel sorry for your little brother.

464
00:43:59,328 --> 00:44:03,048
He must be so sad when he knows the truth.

465
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:07,090
What did you do with the points?

466
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:09,420
Why are there so few left?

467
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:14,843
Don't tell me you use them just to
wait for her at the school every day?

468
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:21,700
Why even bother? She can't see you anyway.

469
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:27,660
I already thought everything through.

470
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:32,340
Alright, you already made the decision.

471
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:34,680
I'll stay out of it.

472
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:38,731
Make your last moments worth it.

473
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,220
Jake.

474
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:13,140
Are you here, Jake?

475
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:15,600
I'm here.

476
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:23,840
Jake…

477
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:33,690
So, Kevin doesn't want to
see me anymore, right?

478
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:39,660
Yes, but I'm so confused.

479
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:43,060
Kevin has been looking for you for years.

480
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:48,120
But why did he, out of the blue,
give this chance to Pluem?

481
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:55,440
Jake, you're really not going to tell him

482
00:45:56,410 --> 00:45:58,750
that you've always

483
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:01,300
taken care of him
since he was in the States?

484
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,540
And you still do here in my house.

485
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:07,140
You've always been around.

486
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:22,783
Why are you here?

487
00:46:22,783 --> 00:46:25,923
How did you know I'm here?

488
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:50,250
Here you are, you sneaky ghost!

489
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:53,700
Calm down. I can explain.

No.

You want Kevin to catch on
that we're all ghosts?

I'll explain it all to you.

But please, don't let others know about this.

Alright, I'll listen to you.

It's my first time seeing See-Nam plays the guitar.

00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:21,863

This flower is called Tuberose,

it can hide the smell of a funeral.

Thanks for always helping me.
