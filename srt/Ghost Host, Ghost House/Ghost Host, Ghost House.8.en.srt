Well, tomorrow, I'm not free
from morning to early evening.

164
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,560
Where are you going?

165
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,800
I'll send my friend off at the
airport. My friend is going abroad.

166
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,800
A friend?

167
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,280
Yes, really, just a friend.

168
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,320
Alright then. Up to you.

169
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,080
Take care of yourself, alright?

170
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,400
I'll go taking care of a new star now.

171
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,670
I'm so sick of your face.

172
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:20,641
- You sure?
- Umm.

173
00:17:20,641 --> 00:17:22,240
- You're going to do that?
- Yes.

174
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,705
You're leaving me?

175
00:17:23,705 --> 00:17:27,685
Do that to the number 1 of this agency?

176
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,360
I'm waiting for you outside.

177
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:38,545
Get dressed.
The shooting is starting soon, top star.

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,560
[Hope I'll get to see that person
as a souvenir.]

180
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,400
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

181
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,180
See you around.

182
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,520
- I'll take care of it.
- Thank you.

183
00:19:08,775 --> 00:19:10,600
Are you Thai?

184
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,880
Yes, I am.

185
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,025
Sorry, I wasn't sure about that.

186
00:19:15,025 --> 00:19:16,685
Where are you heading to?

187
00:19:20,575 --> 00:19:24,875
Well… intersection 5, Smithjan street.

188
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,285
Alright, sir.

189
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,580
Are you back from a trip?

190
00:19:35,415 --> 00:19:39,680
No, I live overseas.

191
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:43,000
I just come to Thailand on a trip.

192
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,325
Oh, I see. Are you staying with your relatives?

193
00:19:52,695 --> 00:19:55,520
Just come by to visit them.

194
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,380
Alright.

195
00:20:16,655 --> 00:20:19,260
- Here we are.
- Thank you.

No, thanks.

Excuse me, are you Pluem Pitipong?

00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,440
Yes, it's me.

207
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,720
Oh, I didn't expect to see you.

208
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,920
My wife is a fan of you.

209
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,450
She's liked you since your
first commercial. The prawn cracker.

210
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:08,270
Oh, you're such a big fan of me.

211
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:11,270
As you're here, may I have a picture with you?

212
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,760
Sure.

213
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,920
Selfie, alright?

214
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,125
1… 2… 3.

215
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:19,605
- Okay, thank you.
- You're welcome.

216
00:22:20,855 --> 00:22:23,300
- This is the fare.
- Thank you, sir.

217
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:35,540
Are you on a trip?

218
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,730
Do you want to come in?

219
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,440
Come on in, I'll explain.

220
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,600
Have a seat first.

221
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,225
You still remember the way, right?
It's your own house.

222
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,580
Come this way.

223
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,100
Well…

224
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,560
You bought this house?

225
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,480
Why did you buy it?

226
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:24,280
Well, why are you curious about that?

227
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:29,660
There's no reason you have to.

228
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,965
Of course, there is. So many of them, in fact.

229
00:24:34,965 --> 00:24:39,985
It's beautiful and a nice locale.

230
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,180
And…

231
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:49,620
It's the place filled with good memories.

232
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,840
When you walked in,

233
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:04,160
you started to miss this place, didn't you?

234
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:21,230
What's wrong? Why are you so tense?

235
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,810
Move a bit.

236
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,410
Why? It's my house.

237
00:25:32,415 --> 00:25:33,810
Alright, I'm leaving.

238
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:36,765
Hey… No need to go

239
00:25:36,765 --> 00:25:39,625
I just wanted to tease you, sorry.

240
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,120
Well…

241
00:25:44,878 --> 00:25:49,228
I'll buy you Thailand's famous dish
to make it up to you.

242
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:58,910
What are you doing? Why did you say that?

243
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:04,850
I'm not joking around, I'm for real.

244
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,820
You can go out and have a meal with me?

245
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,090
You're a superstar now, aren't you?

246
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,920
Are you my fan?

247
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,630
I'm handsome, right?

248
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,840
You're a narcissist.

249
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:48,980
If I wasn't handsome, I couldn't be a star.

250
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,520
You could if you had talents.

251
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,060
So you're saying I'm talented.

252
00:27:02,015 --> 00:27:04,360
Do you want an autograph?

253
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,045
Let's trade autographs.

254
00:27:07,045 --> 00:27:13,135
I also want an autograph of
a famous ghost-story streamer.

255
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,390
You're as adorable as I saw on the streams.

256
00:27:27,555 --> 00:27:31,140
Why did you join my streams?
Aren't you scared of ghosts?

257
00:27:32,815 --> 00:27:37,200
I wanted to see your face.
I forgot all my fear.

258
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:49,970
You didn't redesign the place at all?

259
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:57,730
Well… I already told you…

260
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:59,860
This place is full of memories.

261
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,640
I don't want to change a single thing here.

262
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,060
This is the film I left at the beach.

263
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,780
That's right.

264
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,580
You forgot it last time
we went to the beach together.

265
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:38,590
I got that film developed for you.

266
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:48,060
Thanks for keeping it for me.

267
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,973
It's like…

268
00:29:59,016 --> 00:30:01,840
It's like… finding a precious thing I've lost.

269
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,380
Likewise.

270
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,380
Kevin…

271
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,400
I miss you.

272
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,820
You're still as adorable as before.

273
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:54,220
Your eyes are still pretty

274
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,200
so is your nose…

275
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:05,020
Stop teasing me like this.

276
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,550
I never teased you about this.

277
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,400
This time…

278
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,640
Is it still too soon?

279
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,950
I don't want to wait any longer.

280
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,010
I don't want you to wait either.

281
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,160
Where are you going?

282
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,440
I'm going to take a bath.

283
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,105
I've not checked in at the hotel.

284
00:36:35,105 --> 00:36:38,220
No need to go anywhere.

285
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,180
Sleep with me here.

286
00:36:45,775 --> 00:36:50,600
I booked a hotel room. It's a waste of money.

287
00:36:52,435 --> 00:36:56,335
I'll pay it for you. Tell me how much it is.

288
00:36:56,335 --> 00:36:57,885
Don't do this.

289
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:04,100
If you will stay a night at the hotel,
I'll be there with you.

290
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,020
I'll get my clothes ready in a minute.

291
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:12,420
Why are you such a crying baby?

292
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,090
I still miss you so much.

293
00:37:19,455 --> 00:37:22,930
I want to be with you, don't want you to leave.

294
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:27,520
I'll be here for many weeks.
I'm not in a rush to go back.

295
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,880
Oh…

296
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:35,505
Just thinking of you going back,
my heart is torn to pieces.

297
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,478
- Acting.
- Ouch.

298
00:37:39,478 --> 00:37:41,960
It hurts.

299
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,560
Stop overreacting.

300
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,720
You have no idea that,

301
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,440
for 3 years,

302
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,300
I've been wanting to see you so badly.

303
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:17,680
And I never expected this day would come.

304
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,860
I still can't figure it out

305
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,280
why I was so stupid

306
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,140
to let you go that day.

307
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,070
Why didn't I…

308
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:01,720
at least do something?

309
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,240
It's not entirely your fault.

310
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,600
It's my fault, too.

311
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:37,690
If you weren't brave enough to ask,
so wouldn't I be.

312
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:44,890
If you think you were stupid,

313
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,640
I was stupid, too.

314
00:39:52,533 --> 00:39:55,233
We just didn't handle it well that day.

315
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,040
It's fine.

316
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,600
But today, we're back to see each other,

317
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,550
you…

318
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,560
You're new Pluem, a better one.

319
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,920
And for me,

320
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,910
I'm also a better Kevin.

321
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,620
If there are difficult things awaiting for us,

322
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,890
I know we can get through them.

323
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,020
Well…

324
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,480
Together…

325
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,940
Right?

326
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,140
You…

327
00:41:36,653 --> 00:41:37,772
What?

328
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,220
I'm hungry.

329
00:41:50,195 --> 00:41:51,720
What do you want to eat?

330
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,860
Thai BBQ.

331
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:04,530
Okay. I want to eat that, too.

332
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:07,520
I'll make it for you, okay?

333
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,140
Yay!

334
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,620
- Well…
- Huh?

335
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:16,460
Where is my wage?

336
00:42:26,975 --> 00:42:28,880
That's it?

337
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,100
This?

338
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,080
That's it?

339
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,240
Here you go.

340
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:04,250
Eat up so you can quickly grow up.

341
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:21,440
This is Auntie Jeab's BBQ recipe.

342
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,268
It's called… BBQ with…

343
00:43:25,268 --> 00:43:27,031
Egg yolk.

344
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:29,500
I just copied her recipe.

345
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,660
It's so yummy.

346
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,780
How were you there?

347
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:43,220
It was good.

348
00:43:44,055 --> 00:43:48,160
I went back to study
and made some content there.

349
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,400
Well, your online content.

350
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,745
Where did you get those methods from?

351
00:43:53,745 --> 00:43:57,465
Some are… too horrifying,
don't you think?

352
00:43:59,235 --> 00:44:00,960
It's been quite some time,

353
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,940
are you still freaking out over ghosts?

354
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,160
I'm still the same as before.

355
00:44:23,915 --> 00:44:27,160
You're not.

356
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:32,600
Now, you're Pluem Pitipong.

357
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,590
You're no longer a "Handsome Gardener,
Please Share to the World."

358
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,190
I'm still the same.

359
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,960
Do you see the trees over there?

360
00:44:49,615 --> 00:44:53,360
I planted all those trees myself.

361
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,670
Also, I watered and trimmed them.

362
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,000
I did everything myself.

363
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:10,680
How is your sister Prim?

364
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,340
She's going to college now.

365
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:15,960
She's on a Work and Travel program now.

366
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:19,330
This house is messy because she's not around.

367
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:31,120
Well, how did you become an actor?

368
00:45:34,855 --> 00:45:40,720
Since I did the prawn cracker commercial…

369
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,560
- You still remember that, right?
- Umm.

370
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:47,145
I didn't act well on the set that day.

371
00:45:47,145 --> 00:45:48,795
You must have seen it.

372
00:45:50,615 --> 00:45:54,380
But the director felt sorry for me, I guess.

373
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:56,800
She introduced me to a modeling agency.

374
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:02,655
Gucchi, the manager who takes
care of me now, kept finding me work.

375
00:46:02,655 --> 00:46:06,800
Until one day, I got a series project,

376
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,710
I was the friend of the lead.

377
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:12,980
That was so fun and difficult.

378
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:19,121
I got a role as a swimmer and I had
to be shirtless for almost every scene.

379
00:46:19,121 --> 00:46:21,620
There was a diving workshop, too.

380
00:46:23,095 --> 00:46:26,400
I did as best as I could.

381
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,880
After the series ended,
I got some fans like others…

382
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,480
- Not just "some," I think.
- Huh?

383
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:39,200
My mom and aunties in the U.S
watched every episode of your series.

384
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:44,405
Really? Did your mom say I looked good?

385
00:46:44,405 --> 00:46:46,725
Of course, my mom also said that…

386
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:51,270
Said what?

387
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:53,910
I'm not telling you that.

388
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:03,680
You've obviously grown up a lot.

389
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,640
You told me that

390
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,750
it wasn't easy to be an actor.

391
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:17,270
But look at you now. You're an actor.

392
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:25,015
And you're also a swimmer.

393
00:47:25,015 --> 00:47:29,340
I once tricked you into taking off your shirt…

394
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:31,340
You were so shy about it, weren't you?

395
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:39,480
But I'm not shy to do that, anymore.

396
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:44,650
I just showed you every part of me, right?

397
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,180
Stop teasing me.

398
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,420
You're taking revenge for what I did, huh?

399
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,100
I didn't think like that.

400
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:06,660
You look so cute when you're awkward.

401
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,270
I wanted to tease you just a bit.

402
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,670
What happened?

403
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,760
Kevin.

404
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:02,590
For all that time,

405
00:49:06,782 --> 00:49:11,752
did you miss me the way I missed you?

406
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,740
This time…

407
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:45,960
You're ready to be serious
with our relationship?

408
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:53,580
I'm sorry

409
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:58,370
to make you wait this long.

410
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:18,050
You're not going to change your mind, right?

411
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:25,080
I'm not letting you go anywhere now.

412
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:38,330
I will no longer sit there
and be afraid of losing you one day.

413
00:50:42,275 --> 00:50:47,920
I learned that…
the scariest and most regretful thing

414
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:55,700
is not spending the time with the one I love

415
00:50:59,272 --> 00:51:01,740
when I'm still alive.

416
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:17,540
I'll be with you.

417
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:22,440
Let's eat.

418
00:51:24,435 --> 00:51:27,220
Do you want me to feed you pork.

419
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,140
Auntie Jeab, Uncle Art,

420
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:13,940
See-Nam, See-Foon,

421
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:22,670
Pluem has already bought this house.

422
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:30,220
He keeps many of your stuff in their places.

423
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:35,540
Your music box is still there, See-Nam.

424
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:42,000
Some of See-Foon's clothes,

425
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,880
those you told me they were your to-go shirts,

426
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,800
are still under Pluem's care.

427
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:00,950
Jake.

428
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,690
You can rest easy now.

429
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,680
I've found the one…

430
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,630
The one you said you wanted to see.

431
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:25,080
He doesn't love me better than you did.

432
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:34,660
Because your love for me
was the best, the best in your way.

433
00:53:42,270 --> 00:53:43,580
What are you doing?

434
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:48,550
Igniting the incense to talk to your ex?

435
00:53:54,110 --> 00:53:55,580
An old friend.

436
00:54:01,110 --> 00:54:03,820
I just want them reassure them

437
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:10,260
that I'm so happy right now.

438
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:18,020
It doesn't matter if they hear it.

439
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:23,800
I want to tell them this anyway.

440
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:35,980
What about you?

441
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,440
You don't have any words for your dad?

442
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:48,080
Dad.

443
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,620
This is my boyfriend.

444
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:01,990
He's cute, isn't he?

445
00:55:03,895 --> 00:55:06,840
Why are you being so loud?

446
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,430
The neighbors will wake up.

447
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:10,065
Well, you're cute, aren't you?

448
00:55:10,065 --> 00:55:12,085
Stop. Come on.

449
00:56:23,032 --> 00:56:28,054
[Director: Kwankaow]

450
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:48,126
Wait and action, walk away.

451
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:02,640
What? What?

452
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,360
- This scene…
- What's with it?

453
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:07,240
- What's with it?
- I was about to say that this scene…

454
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:11,176
It's the last scene of our series.

455
00:57:11,176 --> 00:57:12,816
- The end.
- The end.
