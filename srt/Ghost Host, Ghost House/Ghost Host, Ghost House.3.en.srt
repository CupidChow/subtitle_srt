Kevin, where are you going in the middle of the night?

17
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,970
All right, I already called my phone.

18
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:58,610
I'll call you next time I go ghost hunting.

19
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:02,310
Have you heard that the ghost TV show is coming to the house on Samitjan street?

20
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:06,470
Hello, everyone. Dok-Yah The Hunter

21
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,950
is taking you to a mysterious house.

22
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,241
Mom.

23
00:01:10,241 --> 00:01:12,241
I'm worn out…

24
00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:38,610
This is the legendary haunted abandoned building.

25
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:44,090
People believe that there is a ghost looking identical to you.

26
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:51,050
Today, I'm here to prove it with my own eyes.

27
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,860
Nam…

28
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:19,340
I think this is quite… dreadful.

29
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,250
We should have asked Mom and Dad to come with us.

30
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:28,540
Their merit points are pretty low now.

31
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,812
It has to be us two.

32
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,030
Don't be coward.

33
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,600
How dangerous can this place be?

34
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,580
Anyway, we won't die twice.

35
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,970
Pluem.

36
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,510
Are you all right?

37
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:14,270
If you're scared, just wait for us there.

38
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,700
Oh.

39
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,030
Do you remember a thing?

40
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,980
I told you about this,

41
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:26,900
that no one can see us when we're out of the house.

42
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,060
And now…

43
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,360
Pluem can't see us.

44
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,410
I forgot about that part.

45
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:41,110
Will he recall what we told him at the house?

46
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:44,110
No one should ever go inside the building

47
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:48,410
if they don't want to be spooked by their ghostly twin?

48
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,540
He definitely will.

49
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:57,100
He's not as forgetful as you…

50
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:03,220
Plus, he's so scared of ghosts.

51
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,900
Though he can't recall our plan,

52
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,000
he won't go inside the building anyway.

53
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,200
Standby right there, Pluem.

54
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,780
This is a ghost's business.

55
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,840
You told me he couldn't hear us, didn't you?

56
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,960
Why did you talk to him?

57
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,071
Oh.

58
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:33,700
Wait up.

59
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,760
See-Nam…

60
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,600
Why are you here?

61
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,690
Mom asked us to take you home.

62
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:21,620
This place is dangerous. Please come home with us, Kevin.

63
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,991
Come with me.

64
00:06:25,991 --> 00:06:27,911
See-Foon, stop…

65
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,470
Why did you raise your voice at me?

66
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:37,670
What did I tell you in front of the building?

67
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,570
You said what?

68
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:43,020
When we were in front of the building…

69
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:47,530
I told Pluem to stand by there…

70
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,550
But you scolded me...

71
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,670
and said he couldn't hear me anyway.

72
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:04,860
Because people can't see us...

73
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,170
when we are out of the house.

74
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:22,490
You told me there was another person picking him up. Right?

75
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,800
- We're doomed!
- We're doomed!

76
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,050
If we can peel the apple skin off without...

77
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,960
tearing it while looking into the mirror,

78
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:50,710
we will definitely see a ghost.

79
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:52,840
That's from what I read.

80
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,200
Hey.

81
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:33,720
I was shocked.

82
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,640
Why are you here?

83
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,530
And how did you know I was here?

84
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,176
Uh… Well…

85
00:08:43,176 --> 00:08:44,800
Or you've come here to do drugs?

86
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,740
Have you done something bad in here before?

87
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,980
Are you insane?

88
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,070
I was shocked.

89
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,710
Kevin,

90
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:00,610
who are you talking to?

91
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,470
Hey.

92
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,720
Jeez.

93
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,291
Is this real?

94
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:21,381
Kevin, come here.

95
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,000
I'll take you home.

96
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,210
Don't listen to him.

97
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,280
He's a stranger.

98
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,201
No. I'm the real Pluem.

99
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,830
That means…

100
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:47,340
There are actually twin ghosts as people say.

101
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,370
- Ghost?
- Ghost?

102
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,520
Damn it. How come my phone would die now?

103
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,360
Forget the streaming. Go home!

104
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,290
Come here.

105
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:04,390
Don't listen to him.

106
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,640
Come this way.

107
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,380
I'm the real one, not him.

108
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,810
Come this way.

109
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,970
I'm the real one, not him.

110
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:24,720
Hey, the headless ghost.

111
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,170
What? What?

112
00:10:28,538 --> 00:10:29,938
Run.

113
00:10:39,818 --> 00:10:43,218
Where are you going, "Pluem"?

114
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:47,460
You're confused, aren't you?

115
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,190
Ah…

116
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,570
Dumbfounded?

117
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:54,600
You think you're the only ghost here?

118
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,380
If you're still thinking about scaring our family,

119
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:09,520
I will report your ass to the staff.

120
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,810
Give it a try.

121
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,940
Damn it.

122
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,090
It was freaking scary.

123
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,180
It was so exciting.

124
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:31,200
It was my first time seeing a ghost.

125
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,480
Excited my ass!

126
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:38,340
How could you come to a dangerous place alone?

127
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:44,650
Where are you going?

128
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:46,860
Uh… well…

129
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,320
I want to check my belongings.

130
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,030
I fled from the building, I might've left something in there.

131
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:57,450
Then what?

132
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,510
You're going back to get them?

133
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,520
Well, no…

134
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,171
Why did you scold me?

135
00:12:04,171 --> 00:12:06,371
You deserved that, didn't you?

136
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,400
Have you ever thought people are worried about you?

137
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,090
You do whatever you want. You go wherever you want.

138
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:16,550
You're being childish.

139
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,321
What does this have to do with you?

140
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:28,020
Well, did you think I would come after you...

141
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,400
when I was so scared of ghosts?

142
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,425
I came here because I was worried about you.

143
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:43,466
I know that you had freedom living abroad.

144
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:47,030
I know you like doing everything by yourself.

145
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,320
But this is Thailand.

146
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,270
You just came back, didn't you?

147
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,610
You don't know the streets well enough.

148
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,780
It's so dangerous, Kevin.

149
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,000
I don't want you to be in danger.

150
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:13,780
Don't do this again. All right?

151
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:18,692
I know you're not scared of ghosts,

152
00:13:18,692 --> 00:13:20,931
but you should be scared of other things.

153
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,330
In this old building,

154
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,130
you could have fallen down, who knows?

155
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,430
You're this little.

156
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,527
Why are you showing off so much?

157
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:46,000
I called you but you didn't pick up.

158
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,801
It's my fault. I'm so sorry.

159
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,581
I won't leave you alone anymore.

160
00:13:59,581 --> 00:14:01,701
That's my pinky promise.

161
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,430
How was that?

162
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,250
I looked like a leading actor, didn't I?

163
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,340
Almost.

164
00:14:14,636 --> 00:14:17,376
How did you know I was here?

165
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,786
Uh… well…

166
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:30,360
I went to your home and met Auntie Jeab.

167
00:14:31,289 --> 00:14:36,570
She told me you were at the haunted building.

168
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:40,720
There was only one in this area…

169
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,870
Oh…

170
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:47,120
I'd better head back home now.

171
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,250
Before I left,

172
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:54,140
Auntie Jeab wasn't okay with me coming here.

173
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,740
Can you give me a lift home?

174
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,360
Why not? You're not free?

175
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,450
A-All right, I'll walk home alone.

176
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:13,510
Hey, hold on.

177
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:16,550
Well…

178
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:19,220
I can give you a lift then.

179
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:22,820
But… well…

180
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,800
Well?

181
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:30,346
Well, I'm starving.

182
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,790
I'm getting a stomachache.

183
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:37,520
Let's have dinner first?

184
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,820
Now?

185
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,630
Of course…

186
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:44,840
Rushing to save you took a lot out of me.

187
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:49,214
Can't you just have dinner with me?

188
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:51,187
No?

189
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:57,690
All right, sure.

190
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,350
Hand.

191
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:06,440
Hand?

192
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:25,600
Put on the helmet.

193
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,341
- Oh, did you get hurt?
- No.

194
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,140
Come quick.

195
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,621
Oh…

196
00:17:06,621 --> 00:17:09,111
Why are you stalling so often, my oldie?

197
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,800
Come quick.

198
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,360
Thanks.

199
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,910
Why do you like this kind of food?

200
00:17:55,910 --> 00:18:00,550
I thought you liked pizza or hamburgers.

201
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:06,320
Umm… My mom used to cook me Thai food.

202
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,524
But since she got married to another guy,

203
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:15,604
I didn't have a chance to eat it that often anymore.

204
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,890
Eh…

205
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:24,130
Should we change the subject?

206
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:29,011
Umm-mm. Do you have a special someone?

207
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:37,220
When do I have time for that?

208
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:41,460
Look at how many jobs I do in a day?

209
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:49,490
There have been people hitting on me.

210
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,407
But I didn't want to focus on love.

211
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,130
But now, I've found someone I want to focus on.

212
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,160
Who is that?

213
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:09,680
Do you have someone?

214
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,450
What?

215
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:16,601
Why did you change the subject? You've not answered my question.

216
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,720
Your answer is going to be my answer.

217
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,540
So, do you?

218
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,241
No.

219
00:19:50,241 --> 00:19:52,141
Really?

220
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,964
How can someone with this face still be single?

221
00:19:55,964 --> 00:20:01,211
This face? How's my face?

222
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:07,371
It's... cute.

223
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,740
You are really cute.

224
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,550
You don't believe me?

225
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:17,900
No.

226
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,180
Trust me on that.

227
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:23,000
If you weren't cute,

228
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:27,326
I wouldn't have fallen for you the first time we met.

229
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:39,750
Stop that. If you don't eat, I'll go home now.

230
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,440
Uh, I was about to ask you this.

231
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,810
At the abandoned building, how could you tell I was the real Pluem?

232
00:20:54,739 --> 00:20:57,410
A person who screamed out loud like that,

233
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:59,560
it could be no one else.

234
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:04,550
Hey!

235
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,970
I'm just kidding.

236
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:08,630
Haven't you noticed yourself?

237
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:13,150
When you're stressed or frightened,

238
00:21:14,059 --> 00:21:16,670
you often play with your hands.

239
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:20,480
Picking at your nails or touching your fingers, like this.

240
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:32,740
I often like to play with my hands,

241
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:41,290
like this?

242
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:44,330
Oops.

243
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:50,690
I'm leaving now. Ask for the bill.

244
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:55,000
We're leaving as you said.

245
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,400
Put it on my tab, Auntie.

246
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,120
Okay, but there'll be interest next time.

247
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,300
Beautiful ladies are not stingy.

248
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,540
Wherever you are going, just go.

249
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:47,190
What's wrong?

250
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:49,860
Why are you shaking?

251
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:53,190
Are you still horrified by the ghost?

252
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:55,470
Uh…

253
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:57,470
No.

254
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:59,760
It's just cold.

255
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,860
Maybe, I caught a cold.

256
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,890
The weather is changing.

257
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:07,690
Then you should go home now.

258
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,440
Uh…

259
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,830
Thank you for the ride home.

260
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:17,360
I picked you up at the abandoned building.

261
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,850
Just giving you a ride home is not a big deal.

262
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:24,200
Thank you, Mr. Pitipong.

263
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:30,530
I'm going home now, okay?

264
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:34,540
It's late now. You should go to bed.

265
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:41,380
Won't you come in and say hi to Auntie?

266
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,870
It's so late now…

267
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:51,840
They all might be in bed now.

268
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,010
I'll say hi tomorrow.

269
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:58,390
Umm…

270
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:02,170
You'll be gardening here tomorrow?

271
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,920
Eh…

272
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:12,880
I'll be here to meet her nephew…

273
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:23,610
Well… You should leave now.

274
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:25,110
Bye-bye.

275
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:27,410
Bye-bye.

276
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:30,860
- I'm leaving, all right?
- Okay.

277
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:05,760
I didn't lie, everyone.

278
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,880
That ghost looked exactly like my friend.

279
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,180
I almost couldn't believe my own eyes.

280
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:17,610
I couldn't record the evidence,

281
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:20,780
my phone died…

282
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:25,771
But when I escaped the ghost, I ran out of energy..

283
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:33,640
Well, you've been with me for a while,

284
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,980
but I've never asked you…

285
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:40,150
if you believe in ghosts.

You guys are so good at teasing me.

306
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:10,720
The banyan tree on the three-way intersection…

307
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,910
Is this the three-way intersection?

308
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,940
One.

309
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,590
Two.

310
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:24,300
Three.

311
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:36,300
This is the landmark you told us to visit when we have questions. Right?

312
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,980
What is happening?

313
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:50,450
I wonder if… there is another ghost hidden in my house.

314
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:53,460
How can you tell?

315
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:58,100
I felt like someone was peeking at me.

316
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,920
I also smelled something weird. It's an unfamiliar perfume scent.

317
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,350
Especially, in Kevin's room,

318
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:09,250
the scent was so strong.

319
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:14,760
One day, I decided to enter his bedroom.

320
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,360
And I found…

321
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:20,320
this on the floor…

322
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:35,820
Oh?

323
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,070
What's that?

324
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,247
Nothing.

325
00:28:41,247 --> 00:28:45,357
Oh… didn't you say you know everything?

326
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,640
Yes, I said so.

327
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,400
But that doesn't mean I'll tell you everything.

328
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,150
Why did you make me come this far?

329
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:59,570
How can you tell…

330
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:04,880
this doesn't belong to anyone in your house?

331
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,190
Of course not.

332
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:09,790
See-Nam doesn't wear something like this.

333
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:13,320
Kevin also wears one earring only.

334
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:17,060
It's not my mom's either.

335
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:19,860
Not my dad's.

336
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,940
Pluem's earrings don't look this expensive.

337
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,132
When I enter Kevin's dream,

338
00:29:28,132 --> 00:29:31,950
I feel like someone is
peeking at me in his room.

339
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:34,840
Entering someone's dream willy-nilly.

340
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:37,780
Your merit points will be gone one day.

341
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:43,370
Even if you come beg for my help

342
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:45,340
I won't be able to help you.

343
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:51,280
What will happen if I run out of points?

344
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,880
My body will disappear into thin air?

345
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,480
There are two ways to go to your next life.

346
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:03,140
One is leaving the world in peace.

347
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:07,700
That happens if you can accomplish your last mission before death.

348
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:13,040
And two is leaving the world when the merit points are used up.

349
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:18,390
That's living in the human world, purposelessly, with lingering attachments.

350
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:22,870
How bad can it be leaving the world

351
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:25,470
without a point?

352
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:28,040
You'll be reborn as a dog or a cat.

353
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:32,840
No. I don't want to be a dog like Sundance.

354
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,020
I don't want to be a cat either.

355
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,470
Then don't spend your points recklessly.

356
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,980
So, is there another ghost in my house?

357
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,461
Don't act like this.

358
00:30:45,461 --> 00:30:47,851
You must answer my question.

359
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,440
Go home.

360
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:54,466
It's not stuff kids should know.

361
00:30:55,230 --> 00:31:00,620
That means there is another ghost in my house for real.

362
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:06,780
I won't tell you, bleh.

363
00:31:07,927 --> 00:31:09,370
Oh.

364
00:31:11,037 --> 00:31:12,717
Where's he gone to?

365
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:19,152
- Uncle Art.
- Hi, Kevin.

366
00:31:19,152 --> 00:31:21,800
- What are you up to?
- I'm looking at my painting.

367
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,840
You woke up so early, by the way.

368
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:30,240
I usually draw something memorable.

369
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:34,400
Like, magical moments in life.

370
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,583
Why don't you take pictures or record videos?

371
00:31:39,583 --> 00:31:41,860
Isn't that easier?

372
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,350
Those are different from this.

373
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:47,200
A photo is the thing we capture from what we're seeing.

374
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:51,630
But a painting is

375
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:55,360
an emotional conveyance.

376
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,160
It's time for breakfast.

377
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,440
Let's have breakfast.

378
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,870
- May I ask you one thing?
- Sure.

379
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:10,820
You painted all of these yourself?

380
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:14,170
No, I've collected them.

381
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:20,110
I think they must be… very expensive.

382
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:27,340
If you like them, I'll give all of them to you.

383
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,990
Whoa! Don't do that.

384
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,890
You should keep them for See-Nam and See-Foon.

385
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,870
Both of them might not want these anymore.

386
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:41,770
They might want them one day when they grow up.

387
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:47,110
Well, I'll give all of these to you.

388
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,880
When the time comes,

389
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,800
you can haul them all out.

390
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:07,075
We need to investigate and find the car of the other party.

391
00:33:07,075 --> 00:33:11,600
Don't worry. I'll inform you of our progress.

392
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,860
I'm doing this because you often do volunteer work here.

393
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:20,330
I'll speed up the investigation for you.

394
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:24,070
So, what about your father's funeral? All done?

395
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,960
Yes, sir.

396
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,120
Sorry, I couldn't attend.

397
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:31,400
The cops here were so busy with big cases.

398
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,450
The funeral lasted just a few days, and I didn't invite many.

399
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:37,620
My father wouldn't want to be anyone's burden.

400
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:40,670
How is Prim?

401
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:43,030
I let her stay in the hospital.

402
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,390
I'm so busy right now.

403
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:48,040
I'm afraid no one can take care of her when I'm away.

404
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:51,220
Aren't you telling anyone about this?

405
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,400
The doctor said it takes time.

406
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:06,380
Are you okay, Pluem? You've been facing tough things.

407
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:08,861
That's fine.

408
00:34:08,861 --> 00:34:12,061
Well, let's say,

409
00:34:12,061 --> 00:34:15,190
my sister can't complain. It's easy on my ears.

410
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,836
How come they are watching a horror movie again?

411
00:34:46,836 --> 00:34:48,527
I warned them but they won't listen.

412
00:34:48,527 --> 00:34:51,140
What will we do if Kevin suspects?

413
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:54,020
No worry. Let them do it.

414
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:56,601
The movie is way more exaggerated.

415
00:34:56,601 --> 00:34:58,581
Kevin won't suspect us.

416
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,800
Whoa.

417
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:09,040
Thai horror movies are superb.

418
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,280
How do they think of each scene?

419
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,840
But every one of them has the same core,

420
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,990
the stranded ghosts are worried

421
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:21,090
about something.

422
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,340
Maybe, that's right.

423
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,010
If not,

424
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:30,230
why are they still stranded?

425
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:43,690
Whoa.

426
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:46,470
You're so cool with it.

427
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:48,520
Aren't you scared for a bit?

428
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:51,620
I'm used to it now.

429
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:54,780
I've watched a lot.

430
00:35:56,090 --> 00:36:00,270
Well, I'll go and stream my live.

431
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:05,140
After that, will you continue watching this?

432
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,000
Keep it for later.

433
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:10,170
I'll probably go to bed right after.

434
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:12,960
I'm kind of worn out today.

435
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:15,920
I have to go.

436
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:44,310
Hey, be quiet.

437
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:46,820
No one is coming this way.

438
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:49,440
The people here are scared of the ghost rumor.

439
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,710
Hoever, are you sure this house has expensive stuff?

440
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:56,140
Yes, I'm sure.

441
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:59,530
I watched the Dok-Ya The Hunter or something…

442
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:00,750
Who?

443
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:04,950
Dok-Ya. The famous ghost program host.

444
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:07,060
Oh.

445
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:11,510
She entered into this house.

446
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:16,860
And there was a room with expensive paintings.

447
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,300
- From what I've looked up…
- Look, I recorded that shot.

448
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,360
In this house…

449
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,290
Okay, I believe you now.

450
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:26,971
Let's get inside. Come on.

451
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,650
They must be burglars.

452
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:39,780
Thanks, Mr. Obvious.

453
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,060
Should we report this to the police?

454
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:46,180
We can't.

455
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,490
If we do that,

456
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:51,010
things will get out of hand.

457
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:54,660
What should we do then, kids?

458
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:59,890
Or should we just let it be, just like what Nam said last time?

459
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:05,580
But I think we should deal with them ourselves this time.

460
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,560
What's the plan?

461
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:13,320
Use what we've learned from the horror movie we watched.

462
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:31,121
What are you doing? The door isn't locked.

463
00:38:42,678 --> 00:38:44,559
What floor is that?

464
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:46,230
I don't know. What floor was it?

465
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:50,240
You don't know? But you watched the show.

466
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,210
I was too excited so I forgot about that.

467
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:55,300
Then you watch that clip again.

468
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:58,230
You're right! Why are you so smart?

469
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:00,880
No, it's because you're stupid.

470
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:05,710
Hey, what was that sound?

471
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,350
Go take a look.

472
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:11,950
What?

473
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:14,530
Just come with me, Seua.

474
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,600
Why didn't you call me by my full name?

475
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,980
We're in disguise, but you still called me by my real name.

476
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,950
What the heck, Bank?

477
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,610
You also called my real name.

478
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:34,640
Stop talking shit. Go and take a look.

479
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:06,280
Do you want to try a piece?

480
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,080
It's yummy.

481
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,271
- Fu**.
- What the heck was that?

482
00:40:17,271 --> 00:40:18,560
Was that a ghost?

483
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,030
The house owner was welcoming you, who knows?

484
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:23,740
And why did we run upstairs?

485
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:27,370
Oh… You led the way, didn't you?

486
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:29,370
I didn't.

487
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:31,190
What's next?

488
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:33,230
I don't know.

489
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:39,140
Hey, what is that?

490
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:50,820
Do you want to be our twin brothers?

491
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,480
Why are there so many ghosts?

492
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,710
Who knows? I came with you.

493
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:13,980
However, we met the mother and twin ghosts

494
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:16,010
then there is still…

495
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:17,300
Woah.

496
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:21,010
Why the hell are you calling him?

497
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:25,110
Hey.

498
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:43,790
Why are you disturbing my family?

499
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:00,410
At least,

Good.

Should we go upstairs and check on Kevin?

Kevin,

515
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,170
what if I had fallen asleep and didn't hear your call?

Pluem, you're here with your boyfriend today?

Hey, no.

Not a boyfriend.

I came across a myth,

524
00:44:16,991 --> 00:44:20,801
a way to scare off the ghosts

525
00:44:20,801 --> 00:44:22,700
is to get naked.

526
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:25,310
Why are you so passionate about ghosts?

527
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:28,646
Don't you try to find every single way to see ghosts?

Kevin, you know about us?
