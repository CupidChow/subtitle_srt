The abandoned mid-street house is the most haunted in this area.

But this is just the early stage, dear.

You can't expect a hundred thousand or a million now.

When will it pay back the cost then?

This is has me upset.

37

If you are forcing me to go back and work, I would rather bite my tongue to death.

We'd already finished discussing that before I quit.

41

You also agreed with me about establishing this studio.

I had a band rehearsal. I forgot to tell you.

Eh… I just said, "This isn't your territory."

114

Think, carefully. Think twice, maybe thrice.

122

It requires lots of points.

123
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,210
Just tell me how many.

124
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,460
10,000.

125
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,120
It costs that much just for her to see me?

128

129

But I'm pretty sure you do.

You still have so many things you've not done. Right?

131
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,640
You died prematurely.

132
00:10:19,345 --> 00:10:23,560
Well, you want to lose all of your points to see who?

133
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,160
Your lover?

134
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,760
Your lover, right?

135
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:31,160
Think if it's worth it.

136
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,200
Oh.

137
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,460
Why are you so mad?

138
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,500
I won't bother you anymore.

139
00:10:38,432 --> 00:10:39,840
All right!

140
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,280
Don't forget to tell your parents and younger bother before the exchange.

141
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,860
So if you disappear, they won't be shocked by that.

No longer want to do it?

146
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,160
10,000 points, all right?

147
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,066
I'll discount it to 9,999, all right?

148
00:11:14,066 --> 00:11:17,440
That's a special promotion I've never offered to any ghosts.

149

00:13:33,873 --> 00:13:35,241
Oops.

164
00:13:35,241 --> 00:13:38,733
What a coincidence. I'm riding home.

165
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,120
Where are you going?

166
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,242
Do you want this…

167
00:13:44,242 --> 00:13:48,068
handsome gardener to give you a lift?

168
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:04,500
Do you want to go ghost hunting at that mid-street house I told you about?

169
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,740
I'm looking for new places.

170
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:10,180
Well, well. Scared, aren't you?

171
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,680
Admit it. You're scared.

172
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:16,128
I'm not a coward like you.

173
00:14:16,128 --> 00:14:18,380
I already went to that house.

174
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:21,120
I didn't see anything.

175
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,180
Maybe, someone was just exaggerating.

176
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:27,420
Hold on. How could you not see anything there?

177
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:31,500
Everyone, even the elderly on that street, have been haunted.

178
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,620
They almost lost their sandles, running out of the house.

179
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,880
I heard the ghosts were hanging upside down

180
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,980
and showing off their slit mouths.

181
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,090
Their tongues were this long…

182
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,300
You saw that yourself?

183
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:50,500
A person like me… only goes a roundabout way.

184
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,880
I almost pissed my pants just seeing the house numbers.

185
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,408
Anyway, just take a ride with me.

186
00:14:57,408 --> 00:15:01,108
I'll give you a lift to wherever you want.

187
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,640
With this old junk?

188
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,960
Walking is probably faster.

189
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:17,320
I just wanted to tease you. I didn't mean to make you mad.

190
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,606
I won't tease you anymore.

191
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,980
How about this?

192
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:28,860
I'll buy you Thailand's famous dish to make it up to you.

193
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:33,140
Basil stir-fry? I ate it every day when I lived there.

194
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,848
I'm proud to present…

195
00:15:46,848 --> 00:15:48,868
Sashimi Thailand.

196
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,080
Excuse me! May I have the extra sauce, please?

197
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,020
That's a big bite.

198
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,620
You aren't typical.

199
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,401
You want to have it, too?

200
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,180
No, thanks.

201
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:26,100
Feel free to let me know if you want anything else.

202
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,000
I own this restaurant.

203
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,580
Pluem…

204
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,500
Did you finish serving?

205
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,540
Help me lift the gas tanks.

206
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,720
Sure, boss.

207
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,580
I'm coming.

208
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,500
Okay… You're the owner, I see.

209
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,612
I'm the manager now…

210
00:16:50,612 --> 00:16:52,512
I'll wait for the promotion.

211
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,520
Oops.

212
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:01,140
I'm coming right up. Don't scold me, boss.

213
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,260
I really did everything I could do.

214
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,220
I swear.

215
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:23,220
Do you guys have any other ways?

216
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,720
Let me know…

Okay, I'll try all of your methods.

223
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,920
Anyway…

224
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,940
If I risk myself doing all of your methods,

225
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:55,300
will I be rewarded with your gifts?

Hey... Hey. Give me the locations.

231
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,880
I'll have a solo trip to those haunted places.

Everyone, I must leave now.

240
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,040
What was that?

241
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,069
I've not spoken a word.

242
00:18:48,069 --> 00:18:52,659
Don't be nosy. Why did you break in? I was streaming.

243
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,957
Look around you.

244
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:09,618
The mosquitoes are carrying you away.

245
00:19:09,618 --> 00:19:12,198
You could've just told me.

246
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:23,320
What about that table? Why didn't you shoo them out?

247
00:19:24,617 --> 00:19:27,117
That table?

248
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,400
That one right over there.

249
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,780
Do-Do you see them eating?

250
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:41,180
They just left for the bathroom, didn't they?

251
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,560
Their drinks are still there.

252
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,480
Those are offerings for local ghosts.

253
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,320
Oops.

254
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,767
Well… I didn't know about that.

255
00:19:55,767 --> 00:19:57,667
But well…

256
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:02,220
Are those small cups enough for them?

257
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,120
Hey.

258
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,361
I apologize, holy spirits. This guy didn't mean to say that.

259
00:20:08,361 --> 00:20:10,921
He is from a foreign country.

260
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,575
Why are you paying respect to me?

261
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,140
I made an apology.

262
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,600
If not, they would come and snap your neck.

263
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,360
Don't say I didn't warn you.

264
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:28,220
Are you scared of ghosts that much?

265
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,310
Of course.

266
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:31,410
Have you seen one?

267
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:35,260
- Never.
- Oh!

268
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,800
Then why are you so scared of them?

269
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,980
Oh?

270
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,300
No need to have seen one. I know they're scary.

271
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,240
If you don't believe it, don't disrespect it.

272
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,220
No. I'm not disrespecting.

273
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,540
Neither do I believe nor disbelieve.

274
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:52,340
I just want you to ask questions.

275
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:59,700
Like, are the ghosts as spooky as you imagine?

276
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:07,460
Do you want to prove that with me?

277
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,700
No way!

278
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:13,110
Ooh… Aren't you going to spend some time thinking about it?

279
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,980
Even ghost stories on YouTube keep me up all night.

280
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:21,260
If I had to see real ghosts,

281
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,460
I would be shocked to death.

282
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:27,023
Pluem, I told you to come and prove it.

283
00:21:27,023 --> 00:21:33,686
The ghosts may or may not exist.

284
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,980
It's like scientific experiments.

285
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,088
I think it's pretty fun.

286
00:21:40,088 --> 00:21:42,220
Don't you want to join?

287
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:45,100
Don't do this.

288
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,290
You know how scared I am.

289
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:50,418
I won't do it for all the money in the world.

290
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:56,680
Really? Not even for money?

291
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:06,460
You know, when I go ghost hunting,

292
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,400
I have to get a ride myself.

293
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,080
- And it's always so expensive!
- Oh…

294
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:16,127
And since I don't know the directions well, I often end up getting lost.

295
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:21,780
So I want to have someone…

296
00:22:22,563 --> 00:22:25,623
who can pick me up and drop me off.

297
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,821
How much?

298
00:22:33,821 --> 00:22:35,521
What was that?

299
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,020
How much will you pay?

300
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,720
What's your normal rate?

301
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:46,680
I normally go for an hourly rate.

302
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,380
Hourly rate…

303
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:56,100
If you want to hire me for a whole day, I can give you some discounts.

304
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:01,371
Is it okay if I offer you… 3,000 a day?

305
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:08,200
If it's very risky, I'll increase it to 5,000.

306
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,980
You're not tricking me. Right?

307
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:15,220
Sure, I'm not a ghost.

308
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,620
All right then.

309
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,300
I do it because I care for you.

310
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:24,430
If you get in danger or else, Auntie Jeab will blame it on me.

311
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,600
But…

312
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:31,380
Can I pay you after the job is done?

313
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:35,140
I'm afraid you will chicken out and run away.

314
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,547
Oh well…

315
00:23:37,547 --> 00:23:41,120
Someone like me never breaks promises.

316
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,991
I'll give you my number.

317
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:55,500
All right, I already called my phone.

318
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,920
I'll call you next time I go ghost hunting.

319
00:24:00,573 --> 00:24:02,063
Sure.

320
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,140
What name did you save my number as?

321
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,700
I'm not telling you.

322
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,300
I'm going back now.

323
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,840
Give it to me.

324
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,780
Hey.

325
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,300
- Hand it to me.
- Good. Please help me.

326
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:52,260
Where are you going, Pluem? Huh?

327
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,500
I'm visiting Prim.

328
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,177
Why are you visiting her this late?

329
00:24:56,177 --> 00:24:58,180
I just finished my job.

330
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,380
She must be so mad at me.

331
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:03,860
So I think I'll buy Yok's crispy pork rice for her.

332
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,840
- Before you go…
- Huh?

333
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,980
Do me a favor.

334
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:10,460
- What is it?
- I forgot my password to Instagram.

335
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,550
- Please help me set up a new one.
- Sure.

336
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:14,270
But…

337
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:16,090
Are you also on Instagram?

338
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:18,240
Do you like hot guys' pictures?

339
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,680
Are you insane?

340
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,820
- I'll help you with it.
- Good.

341
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:25,610
- Thanks, man.
- You're welcome.

342
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:28,737
- Sri.
- What?

343
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:33,110
Have you heard that the ghost TV show is coming to the house on Samitjan street?

344
00:25:33,993 --> 00:25:37,700
To that abandoned mid-street house?

345
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,700
I'm so sick of this.

346
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,420
So many shows have gone there.

347
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:45,260
If I were a ghost, I would pack up and leave long ago.

348
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:48,820
- Well. I'm not talking about that house.
- Huh?

349
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,840
They come for the house at the end of that street.

350
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,900
The huge house that was a studio.

351
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,780
Oh…

352
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,321
- Studio…
- Yes.

353
00:25:57,321 --> 00:26:00,460
There is only one haunted house on that street, isn't there?

354
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,300
No, there is another one.

355
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,900
That family had twins.

356
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:09,300
The father was a painter.

357
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,280
Oh…

358
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,500
Their names are at the tip of my tongue…

359
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:17,240
Piamphon or something like that.

360
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:23,360
People are spreading rumors that all the members are all dead.

361
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,100
- Really?
- Yes.

362
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:30,960
Those ghost-hunting shows heard about this so they want to prove if ghosts exist.

363
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,587
Pluem, you go there so often, don't you?

364
00:26:35,587 --> 00:26:37,673
That's right.

365
00:26:37,673 --> 00:26:40,767
Have you walked past that house?

366
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,897
I… I already changed the password for you.

367
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:50,620
- Note it so you won't forget it.
- Thanks.

368
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:51,660
I'm leaving, all right?

369
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:54,540
Hold on. What's the hurry?

370
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,580
I'm going to visit my younger sister.

371
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,560
Are you really in a rush?

372
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,540
- What do you want?
- Help us load the packages, first.

373
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,520
I can't leave this place today, I guess.

374
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,937
Help me first. Come on in.

375
00:27:10,937 --> 00:27:12,660
- Quickly.
- Ouch… it hurts.

376
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,660
My back hurts.

377
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:16,060
- Come on…
- Take off your bag first.

378
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,560
- All right, all right.
- Let my back take a break first.

379
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:30,900
[Handsome Gardener]

380
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:11,458
Kevin, where are you going in the middle of the night?

381
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:17,660
I'm going ghost hunting at an abandoned building.

382
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:22,260
I heard that building was very haunted.

383
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:26,940
And there are ghosts looking like us there.

384
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:30,660
And I've learned new ghost-seeing methods from the internet.

385
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,980
I think I'll try them out.

386
00:28:33,858 --> 00:28:35,988
Can I not let you go?

387
00:28:35,988 --> 00:28:38,026
Auntie Jeab.

388
00:28:38,026 --> 00:28:40,236
It sounds very scary.

389
00:28:40,236 --> 00:28:42,496
Don't worry.

390
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:49,307
When I was in the U.S., I went to even riskier places.

391
00:28:49,307 --> 00:28:52,980
That old building? Easy-peasy.

392
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:57,204
You know those places are risky,

393
00:28:57,204 --> 00:28:59,404
why do you still want to go?

394
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,920
Trust me, I'm a survivor.

395
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:09,827
I must leave now… before it gets late.

396
00:29:09,827 --> 00:29:11,427
Bye-bye.

397
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:24,700
I have no idea why our nephew wants to see ghosts that badly.

398
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:28,360
Those in the house aren't enough?

399
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:33,760
He must not know he has been seeing ghosts for a while.

400
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,438
Those might not work, Mom.

401
00:29:38,438 --> 00:29:42,438
When does a ghost-seeing method on the internet ever work?

402
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:47,119
But that abandoned building is really well-known for that, isn't it?

403
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:50,879
I believe one of the ghosts may show up.

404
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,067
What will you do?

405
00:29:57,067 --> 00:29:58,797
What do you mean?

406
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,037
We have to follow him.

407
00:30:01,037 --> 00:30:02,457
Where…

408
00:30:03,764 --> 00:30:05,654
Where is See-Foon?

409
00:30:05,654 --> 00:30:08,114
Why isn't he here with us?

410
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,540
And you, too.

411
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,660
You always disappear.

412
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,990
There is no idea what you guys are up to.

413
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:17,750
Honey,

414
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:22,580
you're worried about the kids from birth to death?

415
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:25,200
Give them some space.

416
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:32,360
Keep an eye on your brother from now on.

417
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:36,862
Get See-Foon for me. Go on.

418
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:39,497
I know you're hiding here somewhere.

419
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:43,893
Don't let me catch you.

420
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:20,002
Hey. This isn't Kevin's.

421
00:32:20,877 --> 00:32:22,367
Mom.

422
00:32:22,367 --> 00:32:23,887
Mom.

423
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,400
See-Nam, look at what I found.

424
00:32:30,051 --> 00:32:32,461
What are you doing in this room?

425
00:32:32,461 --> 00:32:34,831
Be with the others next time.

426
00:32:34,831 --> 00:32:37,721
When mom can't find you, she always blames it on me.

427
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,399
Listen to me first.

428
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:44,237
Do you remember what I told you?

429
00:32:44,237 --> 00:32:46,600
When I appeared in Kevin's dream,

430
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,860
- I saw a person.
- Appeared in Kevin's dream?

431
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,220
You're still doing that?

432
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:56,017
Mom told you to stop.

433
00:32:56,017 --> 00:32:59,380
If he knows the truth, what will we do?

434
00:33:02,427 --> 00:33:04,527
Go see Mom downstairs.

435
00:33:05,698 --> 00:33:07,578
I have to go help…

436
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,530
- What should we do, Honey?
- Huh?

437
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:49,150
Me?

438
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:52,020
You come up with a plan this time.

439
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,120
I don't know what to do.

440
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,220
A ghost show has never come here.

441
00:33:59,831 --> 00:34:02,028
I think…

442
00:34:02,028 --> 00:34:04,960
we should just hide and do nothing.

443
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,360
We shouldn't let anyone see us.

444
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:14,400
Then they will think… there's nothing in here

445
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,860
will go back, eventually.

446
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:25,780
Everyone, Dok-Yah the Hunter

447
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:29,340
is taking you to a mysterious house

448
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:34,240
where all the family members are dead.

449
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,030
But. But. But. People see…

450
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:42,010
4 of them still live their lives as usual,

451
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:44,520
just like nothing has happened.

452
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,880
Maybe the ghosts are bound to this house.

453
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:55,600
Or maybe, they don't realize they are dead.

454
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,900
I'll take you all to the house.

455
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,590
On the table,

456
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,500
there is food left here.

457
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,900
The food isn't spoiled.

458
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:50,980
Or are there people living here?

459
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,100
Want to try?

460
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,040
It's still delicious.

461
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,780
Let's have a tour.

462
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,880
Maybe we'll see something good.

463
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:22,500
I think this part is a gallery.

464
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,640
From the information I've looked up,

465
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:30,900
this house was an art-teaching studio in the past.

466
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:35,620
The ambiance in here is kind of spooky, everyone.

467
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,360
Don't touch my belongings.

468
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:56,340
Everyone, this house really has a jackpot hidden somewhere.

469
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:59,180
Everyone, get all the equipment ready.

470
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:02,660
We're going to catch the ghosts in this house together.

471
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:07,920
Why are you ruining our plan? They almost left.

472
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,921
They were touching my stuff…

473
00:37:09,921 --> 00:37:12,381
Why did you need to get so possessive?

474
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:19,720
If their ritual succeeds, what will we do?

475
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,142
That's all right, no worry.

476
00:37:26,142 --> 00:37:30,825
I won't let anything happen to you, See-Nam and See-Foon.

477
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,380
Mom.

478
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,720
I feel strange…

479
00:37:56,887 --> 00:38:01,947
I'm performing a binding ritual on this family...

480
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:06,640
with a picture the team found in the house.

481
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:35,520
I feel like… I'm worn out.

482
00:38:38,553 --> 00:38:40,114
Nam.

483
00:38:40,114 --> 00:38:43,014
Maybe, all of us will be gone after this.

484
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:48,500
If rebirth does exist,

485
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,240
I wish, in the next life, we…

486
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,140
Are you giving up that easily?

487
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:00,880
Find a way out..

488
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,080
What can we do, Honey?

489
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,560
We are all newbies.

490
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,640
We didn't even know about the merit points.

491
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:18,327
We don't know why we're back here after death.

492
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,320
This world also has rules.

493
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,740
There is no way we can fight against them.

494
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:33,400
I don't care about the damned rules.

495
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:37,460
The only thing I care about is that my family is safe.

May the spirits in this house be

503
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,300
controlled,

forced,

00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,480
and commanded to follow…

508
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,300
Holy shit.

509
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,360
Damm, the cops are here.

510
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,600
Do they need to come after us every time?

511
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,700
Everyone, dismiss. Let's clear the location.

512
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:54,820
Hurry up. Do you want to be charged with trespassing?

513
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,900
Hurry up.

514

Do you… you…

515

Do you…

516
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,860
have anything you want to tell me?

517
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:47,320
Yes.

518
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:59,433
But you have to promise

519
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:02,779
that you won't tell Kevin about this.

Rumor has it. Everyone can see a spirit that looks exactly like themselves here.

523
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,160
If we can peel the apple skin off without tearing it apart

524
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:32,800
while looking into the mirror, you will see the ghost.

525
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,680
They must be robbers.

526
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,840
Thanks, Mr. Obvious.

527
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:48,120
Should we report this to the cop?

528
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,140
We can't.

529
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:55,060
If we do that, things will get out of hand.

530
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,220
What should we do then, kids?

531
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:03,420
Or we just let it be, just like Nam said last time.

532
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:09,640
But I think we should deal with them ourselves this time.

533

Do you want to try a piece?

534
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,640
It's yummy.

535
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:52,019
Hey, what is that?

536
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:00,460
Have you ever thought that people are worried about you?

537
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:02,640
What does this have to do with you?
