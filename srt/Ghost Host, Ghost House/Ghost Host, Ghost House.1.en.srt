00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,960
Take off your coat…

168
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,650
Oh. Okay.

169
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,070
Stay in my room, okay?

170
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:28,680
My mom already cleaned it up for you.

171
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,840
I'm going to sleep in Nam's room.

172
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,720
Oh, I feel bad for that.

173
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,880
You can stay here with me. So I can have someone to talk to.

174
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,093
That was my plan at first,

175
00:16:41,093 --> 00:16:45,000
but Mom didn't want me to bother you.

176
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,420
Let's find a way to talk later.

177
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,440
Oh… sure. Give me your Line ID.

178
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,120
No, not that!

179
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:58,690
I was talking about my own way!

180
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,880
"My own way"?

181
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,160
Kevin, are you hungry?

182
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,100
Please wait. Pluem is on the way here.

183
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:14,130
Take it easy, Auntie Jeab. I can wait.

184
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,241
By the way, who is Pluem?

185
00:17:18,241 --> 00:17:21,721
Pluem is a freelancer who lives in this area.

186
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:26,580
He often comes here to help my mom and dad.

187
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,903
Mom sent for you.

188
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,173
Just let him unpack his stuff.

189
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,284
Go.

190
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,880
Arrived?

191
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,581
You ordered two kilograms of pork belly.

192
00:18:52,581 --> 00:18:54,511
Who told me, "I'm on a diet"?

193
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,820
Nosy much?

194
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:01,706
Well…

195
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:07,538
Is this the American boy that will be staying with you?

196
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,575
Right.

197
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,782
Hello. How are you?

198
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,079
Never better. You?

199
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:33,080
I'm fine. Thank you.

200
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,970
Sit down.

201
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:39,113
Okay.

202
00:19:39,113 --> 00:19:43,994
You have been so fluent in English lately.

203
00:19:43,994 --> 00:19:46,600
I have my own theory.

204
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:51,050
English is for communication. Just use it. Don't be shy to speak it.

205
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:54,260
If we say it wrong, people will correct it for us.

206
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,780
I speak very well, right?

207
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:02,094
Very well! Very good, bro!

208
00:20:02,094 --> 00:20:05,731
Please join us. Mom wants you to join the dinner.

209
00:20:05,731 --> 00:20:07,521
Okay.

210
00:20:07,521 --> 00:20:11,291
But… I won't stay here for long.

211
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:15,291
I have to walk past that house alone.

212
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:18,319
Coward.

213
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:19,820
What do you mean by that?

214
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,770
Everyone in the village has seen it.

215
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:24,180
If it's that haunted, I won't risk it.

216
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,930
This old junk likes to stop on its own.

217
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:33,330
Okay. Kevin, let's eat Thai BBQ!

218
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,820
Hi, Kevin. Come here.

219
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,120
Let's have the BBQ together.

220
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,582
Wow!

221
00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:01,357
I thought you would wear a turtleneck for dinner…

222
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:11,880
Can you pass me that sauce?

223
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:16,620
- This one?
- Yes.

224
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,630
Ummm…

225
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:24,450
Is this one spicy?

226
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:29,181
Not really. A bit sour.

227
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,220
Hey!

228
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,830
What happened?

229
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,920
You can speak Thai?

230
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:41,390
Of course, I'm Thai.

231
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:44,180
Whoa…

232
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:48,680
And you guys just let me speak English all alone?

233
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:52,220
All right, let me introduce him to you first.

234
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:55,140
This is Kevin, he's my elder sister's son.

235
00:21:55,140 --> 00:22:00,820
And this is Pluem, the one I hired to help me with the housework.

236
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:04,900
You two will definitely see each other more often in the future.

237
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,580
Are you Auntie Jeab's nephew?

238
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,900
Why have I never seen you?

239
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,440
Umm, Kevin was born and raised in the U.S.

240
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,290
He doesn't visit Thailand often.

241
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:16,380
It's been 10 years since the last time. Right?

242
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,960
That's right. I just graduated high school.

243
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,070
And…

244
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,730
And…

245
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,900
Act normally.

246
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:32,640
What is the field you're interested in?

247
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,600
Umm… Well, film studies.

248
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,510
I think it's similar to Communication Arts in Thailand.

249
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,990
Oh, Communication Arts.

250
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:46,024
Hey, you can hire me…

251
00:22:46,024 --> 00:22:52,275
I was an extra for many movies, TV commercials, dramas, and MVs.

252
00:22:52,275 --> 00:22:53,725
I've done all of that.

253
00:22:53,725 --> 00:22:55,940
I also accept non-scripted work.

254
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:59,320
If there's no nudity, I'm fine with it.

255
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,110
I understand that.

256
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:05,480
No one wants to see you naked…

257
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,682
Another thing is…

258
00:23:09,682 --> 00:23:14,135
I just told you I wanted to study it. I didn't say I had studied it.

259
00:23:14,135 --> 00:23:17,925
You don't understand Thai?

260
00:23:17,925 --> 00:23:21,435
Or… I need to speak English with you?

261
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:36,721
Uh, why isn't everyone eating?

262
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,960
- Eat.
- Let's eat.

263
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,810
Eat.

264
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:45,720
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

265
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:54,360
How's your mom?

266
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,440
Please let her know I miss her.

267
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:03,753
How about you pay me a visit when when they're on their summer break?

268
00:24:03,753 --> 00:24:07,003
I'll ask her to send tickets.

269
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:22,080
Well, is there anything you want to do or any places you want to go?

270
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:31,487
I'm interested in ghosts at the moment.

271
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:37,186
Well, let me put it this way,

272
00:24:37,186 --> 00:24:39,766
I was going to talk about this.

273
00:24:39,766 --> 00:24:43,506
Currently, I'm streaming live on an APP.

274
00:24:43,506 --> 00:24:47,540
I'm making ghost-related content,

275
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:51,650
like a ghost talk show, something like that.

276
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:54,470
Do you earn a lot from that?

277
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:56,420
Do you have a lot of audience?

278
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:59,160
Umm, the audience is growing gradually.

279
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,940
I don't have regular ones right now.

280
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:06,830
Well, I get a lot of money each month.

281
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:09,680
I think I can actually turn it into a job.

282
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,480
Oh…

283
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:19,200
You're doing just the ghost content?

284
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,980
You're right.

285
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:24,680
I just looked up ghost stories and narrate them.

286
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:29,390
But I kind of want to go ghost hunting myself.

287
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:35,659
Sorry. Kevin, you may continue.

288
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,468
I'm all ears.

289
00:25:37,468 --> 00:25:41,130
I remember that when I was a kid,

290
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:45,997
my mom told me that Thailand was famous for ghosts.

291
00:25:45,997 --> 00:25:51,528
Even the taxi I got on was full of sacred amulets.

292
00:25:51,528 --> 00:25:55,478
The driver also offered me a talisman.

293
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,470
Oh, really?

294
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:05,440
But I didn't take it. I was scared that it would really work.

295
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,170
Oh, what a brave man.

296
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:15,000
Good luck with that.

297
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,458
Well, if I want to go ghost hunting,

298
00:26:20,458 --> 00:26:23,270
any places you want to recommend, Mr. Coward?

299
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:27,260
I mean… Mr. Pluem.

300
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:30,200
You really want to see them. Right?

301
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,330
I'll take you there.

302
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:35,920
It's the most haunted place in this area,

303
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,827
the abandoned house midway along the street.

304
00:26:37,827 --> 00:26:40,637
Many guards have pissed their pants because of it.

305
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,180
We're doomed.

306
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,416
We really are.

307
00:27:03,416 --> 00:27:05,166
How about now, Mom?

308
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:07,540
You told me

309
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:12,800
he wouldn't find out if we pretended for a few months.

310
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:19,390
I think I'm pretty convincing.

311
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:22,601
I got this bright colored shirt

312
00:27:22,601 --> 00:27:25,913
so I wouldn't look like those rundown ghosts in the movies.

313
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:31,323
Mom, Kevin will suspect because…

314
00:27:31,323 --> 00:27:34,349
you dressed up like a peacock.

315
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:39,280
Don't blame this on me alone.

316
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,380
Honey, you too.

317
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:45,280
You breathed like you got hiccups. That was so obviously fake.

318
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,563
While we're blaming one another,

319
00:27:49,563 --> 00:27:54,453
Kevin might've snuck into that mid-street house by now.

320
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:59,930
So, should we be afraid of him knowing the truth

321
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:03,840
or him getting his neck snapped?

322
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,760
Both of them!

323
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:12,080
Ah. We know those in the mid-street house. Right?

324
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,240
The little boy's family.

325
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:19,360
We just need to go to their house

326
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,470
and beg them to spare Kevin.

327
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:23,080
Is it a good idea?

328
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:30,930
We know that family because our dog bit their son.

329
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:34,560
Then, they poisoned our dog.

330
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:39,555
What about looking for Sundance's spirit

331
