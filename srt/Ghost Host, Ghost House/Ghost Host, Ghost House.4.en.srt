This is the legendary haunted abandoned building.

People believe that there is a ghost looking identical to you.

18
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,280
If we can peel the apple skin off without tearing it

19
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,320
we will definitely see a ghost.

20
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,243
Should we report this to the cop?

21
00:01:08,243 --> 00:01:11,900

Don't tease me, Uncle Mhai!

- You can't tease this guy.
- Hey!

31
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:42,210
You're protecting him?

32

Well, kid, you're this cute.

What made you decide to be with Pluem?

35

Don't you want a promising future?

36

Woah! Do you want me to tell Auntie Jib?

37

You tipped a karaoke girl two grand.

Pluem is a dedicated lover!

He's not a philanderer like some old coot around here!

46
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,420
That's true.

47

Hey! You're so sweet.

48
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,240
I'll help you with the shop tomorrow, princess.

52

Well, dedicated lover.

53
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,260
Your words are the flirtiest I've ever heard.

54
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:03,060
But I'm not a playboy.

55

If I was not a sweet talker, who would give me a job?

56
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,580
I still have to earn a living.

57
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,320
Come on.

58
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,380
This isn't girlfriend stuff.

59
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:05,620
It belongs to my sister, Prim, that the old guy mentioned.

60
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,880
I didn't say anything.

61
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:16,620
Uh, I heard she's in the hospital, is she okay?

62
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,720
Well,

63
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,980
not much, physically, mainly mentally.

64
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,790
Hey, but that's all right. She'll be home soon.

65
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:36,100
I'll introduce her to you later.

66
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,220
Hey, come and have a seat.

67
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,480
My room is a bit messy, by the way.

68
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,260
That's a not bit.

69
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:54,360
Well, sorry about that.

70
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,890
I don't have time to take care of my room. Come.

71
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,860
Are you hungry?

72
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,080
Not really.

73
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,720
Are you sleepy?

74
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,660
- No.
- Really?

75
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,840
Uh… Do you want to read my comic books?

76
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,900
No, thanks.

77
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:45,460
Do you like watching ghost-hunting shows?

78
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:55,040
Do you want to watch my ghost-hunting videos?

79
00:05:56,726 --> 00:06:00,146
I have so many juicy vids.

80
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,660
Your hands are so fidgety…

81
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,920
Stop picking at your nails.

82
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:19,600
Don't you think they are too short?

83
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:26,220
Are they?

84
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:31,780
Well, I can't stand being hot.

85
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,520
Talking about the clothes…

86
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:59,020
I came across a myth,

87
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:06,920
a way to scare off ghosts...

88
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,100
is to get naked.

89
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:23,520
Since you're so scared of them…

90
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,380
shouldn't you take everything off?

91
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,920
- Huh?
- Kevin!

92
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,240
What?

93
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,060
Don't joke around.

94
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:46,180
I'm not…

95
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,340
You want that?

96
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:57,440
I asked you, "You want that?"

97
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:02,010
Yes!

98
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,320
All right.

99
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,360
You told me, right?

100
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,620
I wouldn't look good when I'm naked.

101
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,900
Let's prove it, shall we?

102
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,080
Hey! What are you doing?

103
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,430
I'm going to get naked.

104
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:40,080
I'll take off mine first then yours afterward.

105
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,660
Hey!

106
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,200
What?

107
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,780
I'm scaring off the ghosts.

108
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:00,940
Please stop. I give up, okay?

109
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,440
Please pull me up.

110
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,700
Hey.

111
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,500
What are you doing?

112
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:25,200
I won't joke anymore. I said I gave up.

113
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,860
I'm not joking right now.

114
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,230
Kevin, you're so cute, do you know that?

115
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,130
Your eyes are beautiful.

116
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:54,180
Your nose is so tiny.

117
00:10:54,917 --> 00:10:56,850
Your lips are…

118
00:10:57,944 --> 00:11:00,349
so pink.

119
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:04,520
I can't stop staring at them.

120
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,040
Isn't it too soon?

121
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,520
Well…

122
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,540
Maybe, you're right.

123
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,040
I can wait.

124
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,610
However, I don't want you to.

125
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:52,300
What are you doing?

126
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,517
I'm just looking at the views.

127
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,160
Yeah?

128
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,340
Was it good?

129
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,020
Well, not bad.

130
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:15,090
- Really?
- Mmm.

131
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,580
Do you want to do it again?

132
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:28,920
Are you insane?

133
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,160
You'd better take a shower.

134
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,360
It's still early!

135
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,108
Please.

136
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,740
Please…

137
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,840
How come there are noodles in the rice?

138
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,660
It's fried rice and instant noodles.

139
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,760
There are rice and noodles in one.

140
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,800
That's my favorite dish.

141
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,820
My father used to make this for me when I was young.

142
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:32,500
For Prim, she likes steamed instant noodles and egg.

143
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:37,107
What? Instant noodles in every dish?

144
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,780
They make us full and doesn't cost much.

145
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,840
- I'll try it.
- Mmm.

146
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,220
Try it.

147
00:17:59,357 --> 00:18:03,680
You want some canned fish? That can cut the greasy taste.

148
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,430
Give me your hand!

149
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:23,000
- Give it to me.
- Why?

150
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,920
- What is this?
- Just put it in.

151
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,330
How about that? Couple rings.

152
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:04,240
That can cut our fingers off.

153
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,420
What… This is so adorable…

154
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,320
Kevin.

155
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,120
Huh?

156
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,300
Are you ready to tell me what you saw last night?

157
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,200
No problem.

158
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,080
I'm starving.

159
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,340
Hey.

160
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,160
I'm going to work today.

161
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:40,020
Just stay in. I'll be home after I finish.

162
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,660
Can I tag along?

163
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:46,920
It's not fun, just trust me. Don't come.

164
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,960
"I" want to be with "you."

165
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,000
Huh?

166
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,682
I?

167
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:00,430
You?

168
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,080
Can't I use those? They sound so adorable.

169
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,720
They sound special.

170
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,850
Well, will you allow me to tag along now?

171
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,220
All right.

172
00:21:30,757 --> 00:21:35,040
If you want to go home, let me know quickly. All right? We can come back here and take you back.

173
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,540
Who will take me back?

174
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:43,160
Well… This guy!

175
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,370
This guy will drop you off.

176
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,580
Which guy is it?

177
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:56,887
You meant, "You," right?

178
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,920
Don't tease me.

179
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,590
"I" will, okay?

180
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,840
That's it.

181
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,640
Why do you work so many jobs?

182
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,860
What degree do you have?

183
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:30,880
I dropped out.

184
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,240
I want to work first.

185
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,820
I want to help my dad.

186
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:43,147
I'll continue my studies when Prim goes to college.

187
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:51,740
With my intelligence, I can return to college anytime!

188
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,620
Huh?

189
00:22:56,390 --> 00:23:02,940
If you could choose one, what career would it be?

190
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,980
I got the answer in my mind.

191
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:17,347
But please don't think I'm in over my head. Okay?

192
00:23:17,347 --> 00:23:22,220
Seriously, I'm not going to pick on you.

193
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:25,320
Everyone has a dream they want to reach.

194
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:30,220
No matter what it is, I won't make fun of it.

195
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,488
Umm, well.

196
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,380
I want to be a superstar!

197
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,620
Well, you have the looks for it.

198
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:50,167
It's not ridiculous at all.

199
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:56,680
People always laugh at me when I tell them that.

200
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,400
Hey!

201
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,990
When I first started live streaming,

202
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:08,420
people still had no idea what it was

203
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:11,903
or whether it could turn into a job.

204
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:15,400
For them, it was just a self-talk in front of the camera.

205
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:20,020
I didn't care about what others said because I loved doing it!

206
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:26,930
It's not bad doing whatever we want.

207
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,190
Am I right?

208
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:34,838
And if you want to be a star,

209
00:24:34,838 --> 00:24:38,180
you have to stop picking at your nails.

210
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:41,240
If your nails are ugly, no one will hire you!

211
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,860
I hear you!

212
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,720
From now on…

213
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,590
If I'm nervous,

214
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:53,660
I'll play with your hands instead. Okay?

215
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:05,520
Do you want a tip on how to get over anxiety?

216
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,140
What is it?

217
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:09,170
There it is!

218
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,620
Quickly grab it! Grab it and put it in your pocket. Okay?

219
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:19,000
Put it in your pocket. Quickly!

220
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,640
That's done. You already took the anxiety out of you.

221
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:33,940
Silly! How old are you? Acting like a kid!

222
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:37,080
What? That really works!

223
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:41,200
I often do this when I'm down.

224
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,950
But from now on,

225
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,660
you know…

226
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:52,440
I'll always be there for you when you feel blue.

227
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:01,580
You always find a chance to take advantage of me.

228
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:07,240
Because you're so cute. I can't help it.

229
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,560
- Let's eat. Is it delicious?
- Yes.

230
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:20,440
Which one do you like? This veggie dish.

231
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:29,840
Oh, you're late today, my Pluem!

232
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,800
He's mine! Stop!

233
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,340
I'm so busy with work, Rosa and Lise.

234
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:40,000
Well, who is this?

235
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,180
This is Kevin, he's a relative.

236
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,240
He's my relative from the US.

237
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,120
Oops, you have a relative living in the States?

238
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,980
I didn't know that.

239
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,240
Oops, they're holding hands.

240
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:07,930
Oops, he's definitely not his relative!

241
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:12,080
Kid, I apologize for touching Pluem. I was just kidding.

242
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:17,580
Yes, yes, we're close. We already asked if he was okay and he said yes.

243
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:21,040
I have to say that before you think we're handsy ladyboys.

244
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,680
I'd not thought like that.

245
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:27,320
I just think you are very friendly.

246
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:31,430
I should get going now.

247
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:34,060
Okay, let's give him a check.

248
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,600
150 Baht.

249
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,140
Keep the change.

250
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,260
Thanks.

251
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:52,520
Sorry, it's a bit crowded, Boombim.

252
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,900
Pluem, you're here with your boyfriend today?

253
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:58,420
Hey, I'm not his boyfriend.

254
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:02,620
I'm just his friend. I came here to help.

255
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:06,120
Well, you quickly turned that down.

256
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,120
Is being my boyfriend that bad?

257
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:14,300
No, I'm afraid she'll misunderstand.

258
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:20,167
Well, well! I'm living hand-to-mouth.

259
00:28:20,167 --> 00:28:24,438
Kevin from the States might find me disgusting.

260
00:28:24,438 --> 00:28:29,360
I'm not saying that! What should I say then?

261
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:35,240
Say, "The handsome Pluem."

262
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,440
The handsome Pluem.

263
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,560
"Pluem is so cool."

264
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,860
Pluem is so cool.

265
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,400
"I want to be Pluem's boyfriend so badly."

266
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,520
Hey, that's too far.

267
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,560
If you don't say that, I won't stop being mad!

268
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,580
And I'm not going to start the bike, either!

269
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,250
Please say it. I want to go home.

270
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,340
- Here you go.
- Ouch!

271
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:07,883
Enough! Stop being angry and send her home.

272
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:12,120
All right, all right.

273
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,700
Let's go home, Boombim!

274
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,040
Yeah!

275
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,380
You have to do your last job here?

276
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,220
Yes.

277
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:37,391
Right here. This is where I develop my acting skills.

278
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,540
Acting skills?

279
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:47,718
Hey! What are you going to do?

280
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,060
I'm not going to take off all of my clothes.

281
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,860
This is a monastery after all.

282
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,680
What are you thinking, pervert?

283
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,780
Who knows?

284
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,640
What are you doing?

285
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,900
Wait a second. I'm building up my emotions.

286
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,300
Follow me, all right?

287
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,280
Come on.

288
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,800
Kid.

289
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,720
You came with Pluem?

290
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,440
Oh, yes.

291
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,470
Come on in.

292
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:50,360
Oh, hold on.

293
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:54,220
Please help Chok, he doesn't have many friends.

294
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:58,158
His parents are well-known. They're afraid they'll lose face.

295
00:30:58,158 --> 00:31:00,000
Take this.

296
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,830
Here.

297
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:06,680
Take this, I already wrote all of his biography down.

298
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,720
If you can answer them all correctly, I'll give an extra 500.

299
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,570
Come on in.

300
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,720
[Sittichok Buahom: Born on March 21, 1997; Died on April 10, 2023]

301
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,640
Did you come here alone?

302
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,520
- No, I'm here with my friend.
- Oh…

303
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,860
You're Chok's friend in high school?

304
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:32,080
- Uh…
- Hey.

305
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,340
Wait a second.

306
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,920
Wait a second.

307
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,330
Where were we?

308
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:45,340
I asked you if you were Chok's high school friends.

309
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:48,800
Yes, my name is Pittipong.

310
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:54,220
My student number was next to his, so we were very close.

311
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,920
But Chok's full name is Sittichok.

312
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,730
Weren't the student names arranged, alphabetically?

313
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,000
I got in mid-semester.

314
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,080
I joined the school at that time so I got the next ID number.

315
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,600
Did Chok often get into fights in high school?

316
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,880
Because he passed away so soon.

317
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,680
Oh, no! Not that much.

318
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,880
He was doing just fine, like other teenagers.

319
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:27,680
Actually, he was a nice guy.

320
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:32,900
- Despite his look, he didn't drink…
- What faculty did he study in?

321
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,820
I heard you say Chok also went to college with you.

322
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:42,240
He studied in the Faculty of Science.

323
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:46,760
Yes, that's right. I can recall it now.

324
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,620
Um, right. Faculty of Science.

325
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,880
Yes.

326
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,520
That kid is also Chok's friend?

327
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,940
He looks adorable.

328
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:59,680
Yes, I graduated with Class 48, the same class as Chok.

329
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:05,880
Yes, class 48! I recalled that just now.

330
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,660
Yes, yes.

331
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,120
That guy standing in front said

332
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:17,980
he would give us an extra 500 if we could answer all questions right.

333
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:20,100
500?

334
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:23,620
I already read the script. Bring it on!

335
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,200
I'll answer them all for you.

336
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,560
Chok…

337
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,130
Here you go.

338
00:34:00,407 --> 00:34:02,230
[I bought some food for you.]

339
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,220
[Is your mom coming back late tonight?]

340
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,120
[He's my friend.]

341
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,130
[He is good-looking.]

342
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:19,780
Good-looking like me?

343
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,780
[You're ugly.]

344
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:25,320
You're going to get it!

345
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,140
Close the door and lock it. Okay?

346
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,620
Bring it.

347
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,980
Who is he?

348
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:44,100
That's Game, he's living in this apartment.

349
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:49,080
When his mom works the night shift, she asks me to buy Game some food.

350
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:53,000
Sometimes, I come over and visit him.

351
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:58,480
Well… he is…

352
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,880
He's deaf!

353
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,280
He feels better with this term.

354
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,280
He doesn't like it when people call him a dumb person.

355
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,623
Don't spill that!

356
00:35:09,623 --> 00:35:12,423
Oops! I wouldn't call him like that!

357
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,900
You know how to use sign language?

358
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:21,200
Prim and I used to volunteer at a foundation.

359
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,980
The staff taught us that.

360
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:26,660
That's so good. Teach me that!

361
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,520
Sure!

362
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,620
I'll teach you easy words.

363
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,080
Let's go.

364
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,140
How to say your name in the sign language?

365
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:10,680
What if I want this, too? Who will create it for me?

366
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:15,180
Usually, deaf people name us after your outstanding trait.

367
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:22,880
But I'll specially create one for you.

368
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:28,160
How about this?

369
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,360
- Like this?
- Yes.

370
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,500
Because you often wear an earring on one ear only.

371
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,559
Do it after me. Okay?

372
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:39,319
"My name…"

373
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,660
My name…

374
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,180
"...in sign language..."

375
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,000
...in sign language…

376
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,426
- "…is this."
- Is this?

377
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,710
Try doing it this time.

378
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,920
My name…

379
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,250
Tap it twice.

380
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:56,020
My name is…

381
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,880
in sign language

382
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,920
- is this!
- That's correct!

383
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:08,100
Do you want to wait inside?

384
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,710
Don't worry.

385
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:14,030
I'll help you dry the clothes so they can be done quicker.

386
00:37:14,034 --> 00:37:16,214
Aren't you tired?

387
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:20,640
You're more tired than I am today.

388
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,900
You worked so many jobs.

389
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:27,190
Good job, Pluem!

390
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,220
What's wrong?

391
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:49,520
My mom used to compliment me as you did.

392
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:53,120
I just…

393
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,540
have not heard that for a long time.

394
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,040
You're the best, Pluem!

395
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:23,490
What did I do...

396
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,370
best?

397
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:38,320
I'll dry the clothes first…

398
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:59,520
Can I ask you something?

399
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:08,260
Why are you so passionate about ghosts?

400
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:14,756
I saw you…

401
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:20,852
use every single way to see ghosts.

402
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:26,660
Do you want to talk to the dead?

403
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:42,380
What is it about? Can you tell me?

404
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,680
His name was Jake.

405
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,250
He was my only best friend

406
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:59,080
when I was in the US.

407
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:03,640
We had known each other for ages.

408
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,800
We went through many things together.

409
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:17,400
I decided to go to college with him.

410
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,950
And…

411
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,300
we planned to move to another town together.

412
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,900
There were so many other things we wanted to do together.

413
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,200
But…

414
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,200
out of the blue, he passed away.

415
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,370
Well…

416
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:50,520
Why do you want to see him that much?

417
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,100
I don't know.

418
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,348
I feel like...

419
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,618
we never said goodbye.

420
00:41:01,267 --> 00:41:04,507
Was he handsome?

421
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:11,980
Well, more than you.

422
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:20,700
- Oh, I'm just kidding!!
- Mmm.

423
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,120
You're so easily upset!

424
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:30,040
It's your turn to tell me about yourself.

425
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:35,080
You lived with your little sister, just two of you?

426
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,300
My mom passed away when I was young.

427
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:47,420
And my dad just passed away.

428
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,820
I called him Pa.

429
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:04,200
He was a big guy.

430
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,240
But he was so kind.

431
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:14,680
He liked to watch Hong Kong gangster movies in his free time.

432
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:17,040
The DVDs are still left in the shelves.

433
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:24,430
Talking about it makes me miss him.

434
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,720
Or…

435
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:35,010
should I try your method?

436
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:42,560
Maybe, you've seen ghosts for a while.

437
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,600
What do you mean?

438
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,200
You wanted to know what I saw that night. Right?

439
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:02,960
Well… that night…

440
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:07,110
I heard a loud noise from downstairs.

441
00:43:08,017 --> 00:43:11,980
But when I sneaked out, I saw robbers.

442
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:16,680
Huh? Did they harm you?

443
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,480
No, they didn't.

444
00:43:21,097 --> 00:43:23,507
But…

445
00:43:23,507 --> 00:43:26,660
the robbers were frightened by something.

446
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:32,300
And I finally saw…

447
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:36,220
the things that scared them off...

448
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,720
was Auntie Jeab's family members.

449
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:43,180
They all are ghosts, Pluem!

450
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:52,520
Why aren't you frightened? They all are ghosts!

451
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,410
Well…

452
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:02,300
Wait…

453
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,210
Hold on…

454
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:06,580
Hold on!

455
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:08,880
Calm down.

456
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:13,900
I didn't mean to hide this from you.

457
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:16,560
Why didn't you find a way to tell me?

458
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,380
You want to keep me in that house forever?

459
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:21,980
And you said you were worried about me.

460
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:27,660
Yes, I am. I'm very worried about you.

461
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:32,020
But how could I tell you?

462
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:35,440
Listen to me.

463
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:43,160
If they didn't love or care about you,

464
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:47,700
they wouldn't have come back as ghosts.

465
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:55,360
You know, right?

466
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,840
You're a lucky one.

467
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:02,550
They all died.

468
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:10,030
But you still got a chance to meet them.

469
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:16,180
It's not a chance everyone has.

470
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:40,300
I'm so jealous of you.

471
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,420
If I could choose…

472
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:53,936
I'd want you to meet your dad.

473
00:45:53,936 --> 00:45:56,110
Don't worry.

474
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,240
You know, that's not what we can control.

475
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:07,250
Don't be sad.

476
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:09,620
I'm feeling down for you now.

477
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:15,000
Please console me.

478
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:29,505
Why not?

479
00:46:29,505 --> 00:46:31,940
You don't like kissing me anymore?

480
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:35,820
I like kissing but not what you do!

481
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:37,170
Huh?

482
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:33,400
After learning the truth,

483
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:36,700
the house seems somehow spooky.

484
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,300
Just like ghost movies!

485
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:46,080
If it's as you said…

486
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:48,820
when we go in there,

487
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:51,600
will we find the house deserted?

488
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:55,840
Because Auntie Jeab made us see the house this way.

489
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:58,720
- Umm.
- But it's actually an abandoned house.

490
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,940
Did I also eat leaves instead of real food?

491
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:07,860
It's not that dramatic, I guess.

492
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:13,040
Couldn't you distinguish between leaves and food?

493
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,920
- Hey…
- Hmm?

494
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,400
I-I'm scared.

495
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,140
Can you stay for a while?

496
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:34,700
Please go inside the house with me.

497
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:37,280
Please!

498
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,100
You've been to several ghost hunts

499
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:42,439

501

If the ghosts are the ones I know, I'm not scared.

502
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,920

503
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,900
Jeez!

504
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:07,060
Where have you been for several days, Kevin?

505
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:09,660
Are you still safe, dear?

506
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:21,360
You already know about us?

507
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:32,360
Kevin, are you scared of us?

508
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:39,340
You too, Pluem?

509
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,400
For all this time,

510
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:01,860
why didn't you tell me about this?

511
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,580
Everyone thinks that…

512
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:09,820
I shouldn't know about this at all?

513
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:13,960
The fact that…

514
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
all of my family members…

515
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,170
are dead.

516
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:27,280
Kevin, I'm sorry.

517
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:31,980
If you want to know anything now, just ask me.

518
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:34,620
I'm ready to explain it all to you.

519
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:37,120
Let's talk, Kevin.

520
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,820
Don't be scared.

521

We will never harm you.

After Pluem helped you escape from the abandoned building,

523
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:53,740
Foon and I got back home.

524
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:59,500
So for both of the places that I went ghost hunting,

525
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:03,790
you all were there to save me?

526
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:10,597
That means, I've been seeing ghosts for a while now!

527
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:16,540
Oh! What a pity.

528
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:20,740
If I knew that, I would go to all the locations.

529
00:51:37,150 --> 00:51:38,920
Well…

530
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:44,380
Do you happen to know the reason

531
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:49,050
you came back to this house after…

532
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:54,490
As I can recall,

533
00:51:54,490 --> 00:51:59,530
the staff told us that...

534
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:03,340
there was a High Shrine at the place we died.

535
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:09,620
I think the shrine granted my wish.

536
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:13,170
I wished to meet you again, Kevin.

537
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:22,160
At that time, you told us you wanted

538
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:26,000
to come to Thailand to hunt ghosts,

539
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,840
my mom and dad freaked out.

540
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:35,820
It's good that you know the truth.

541
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:38,300
So we can live together comfortably.

542
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:39,880
Yes.

543
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:43,900
Kevin, don't show me the ghost-catching items anymore?

544
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:47,560
I flinched every time you got them out!

545
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,900
I feel so bad right now.

546
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,380
Well…

547
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:01,516
I'm so sorry for your deaths…

548

And…

549
00:53:10,510 --> 00:53:14,820
I'm so sorry that I was your last concern before death.

550
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:17,620
That's the reason you're stuck in this world.

551

From now on, we'll spend our time to the fullest.

554
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,200
As we don't know the exact time we're going to disappear,

we have to live as we wish.

556

May I ask you something?

557
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:51,280
How did you all die?

558
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:06,680
Well, it was a car accident.

559
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:15,380
A month ago, when you were on your way here,

560
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:19,100
we went out to buy stuff to welcome you.

561
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:24,840
And it was pretty late that night.

562
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:32,990
On the way back, See-Nam had a fever.

563
00:54:32,990 --> 00:54:38,260
So I decided to take the canal path where no one ever walked past.

564
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:44,580
I thought it would be the shortest route home.

565
00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:49,660
And…

566
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:56,040
And that was the worst decision...

567
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,750
I made in my life.

568
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,980
If you need someone to blame,

569
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:11,430

Well, what did your car hit?

573
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:42,970
From what I could recall,

574
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:45,460
it was a grey pickup truck.

575
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:53,440
At first, I thought we all would die right away.

576
00:55:55,740 --> 00:56:02,400
But when the car was sinking, I thought of you, Kevin.

577
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:06,700
I wanted to see you once again, Kevin.

578
