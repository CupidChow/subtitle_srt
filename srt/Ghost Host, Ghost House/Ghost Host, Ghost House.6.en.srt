Your father's car also hit my family's, didn't it?

17
00:00:57,463 --> 00:00:59,483
I can tell you're dumped by your boyfriend?

I told you not to bother Kevin now.

I happened to know that

21
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,100
Kevin wanted to see his best friend
when he studied aboard.

22

exchanged their points for you.

Hey!

26
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,260
You startled me!

27
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,900
Well. You flinched when you saw me?

28
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,950
But you smiled when you saw a ghost?

29
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:01,280
You're not rude to me anymore?

30

I didn't mean to do that.

Well…

33
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,230
I want to talk to you about something.

34
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,420
Just say it.

35
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:42,720
I'm so sorry that I talked
bad with you that night.

36
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:50,860
You come to my apartment, it only my fault.

37
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,640
So, sorry.

You know what? I had Prim's e-dictionary
say each word for me. It took days.

43
00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:18,340

Does an American boy here teach English?

47
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,220
You have to ask him if he is still mad.

48
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,160
You…

49
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,240
I'm really sorry.

50
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,900
I lost control that day.

51
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,540
And, I'm sorry for blaming you like that.

52
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:55,940
But today, I already understand
that it was no one's fault.

53
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,800
I was acting like a rabid dog.

54
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,660
What?

55
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,290
Yay…

56
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,420
Stop. Hands off.

57
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,500

58
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,000
Can't I hug you? I miss you.

59
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,920
I'm going to collect the dry clothes.

60
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:33,800
Let the brave butler take care of the chores.

61
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,176
So…

62
00:04:43,719 --> 00:04:45,815
where are the others?

63
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,200
I let them rest inside the house.

64
00:04:51,316 --> 00:04:53,760
There is a big event tomorrow.

65
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,700
What is it?

66
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,180
Aiemphon family's Funeral.

67
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,500
Uh…

68
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,340
Where? Do you want me to contact
the temple for you?

69
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,800
It'll be held here.

70
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:15,940
Auntie Jeab told me that no one
in the family had had an official funeral.

71
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,280
So I wanted to hold it for them.

72
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,930
I'd like to make it a welfare party

73
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,963
in which everyone can enjoy

74
00:05:25,963 --> 00:05:29,000
and doesn't cry.

75
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:36,060
I don't know when Auntie Jeab and
her family will disappear.

76
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:42,100
As all of them are present right now,
I want to hold a funeral for them.

77
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,620
That's true.

78
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:49,200
I'll help you with that.

79
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,800
Let's buy flowers tomorrow.

80
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,400
I remember that See-Nam likes white roses.

81
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,300
Are you still mad at me?

82
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,940
That "talked bad with you" act you pulled
made up for it.

83
00:06:11,588 --> 00:06:16,308
Can I hug you now?

84
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,600
Up to you.

85
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:30,680
What about kissing?

86
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,930
Do it if you want to.

87
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,500
And what about the lips?

88
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,140
Do it then. It's your funeral?

89
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,910
Oops.

90
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,520
I'd better deal with the clothes.

91
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:00,530
- Hey. Hey.
- You'll get hit.

92
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,700
What kind of flower are those?

93
00:07:09,117 --> 00:07:11,120
Look at my rose.

94
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,752
- Nice? Nice.
- Yeah. What about mine?

95
00:07:15,752 --> 00:07:18,029
No.

96
00:07:18,029 --> 00:07:20,980
You're the host. Go wait inside.

97
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,420
But I want to help.

98
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:25,580
Let me pluck the leaves for you.

99
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,840
Get inside now.

100
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,200
Get in the house.

101
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,020
Pluem, what's wrong with your eyes?

102
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,980
Hurry up.

103
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,020
Mom, Pluem's eyes hurt.

104
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,383
- Mom, do you have any eyedrops?
- That is not it.

105
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,627
Could've just told me

106
00:08:00,627 --> 00:08:04,437
that you wanted some alone time with Kevin.

107
00:08:06,197 --> 00:08:09,000
Okay, I'll wait for you inside.

108
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,300
Make it beautiful, guys.

109
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,420
This ghost kid is such a pain in the neck.

110
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,640
Phantom pain.

111
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:38,190
He's too young to die, do you agree?

112
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:47,981
It's fate.

113
00:08:47,981 --> 00:08:50,711
That's all the time he had in this world.

114
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,310
When several loved ones pass at once,

115
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:06,770
it really gives you that survivor's guilt.

116
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:17,640
Don't think like that.

117
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,620
Do you know this flower?

118
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,670
No, I don't.

119
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:42,010
This flower is called Tuberose,

120
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,700
it can hide the smell of a funeral.

121
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:58,200
But I kind of like it.

122
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,620
Though it doesn't have a wonderful meaning,

123
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,920
used to hide the stink,

124
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,780
this flower reflects the reality that

125
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:16,060
pain doesn't go away.

126
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,610
It's just hidden

127
00:10:19,547 --> 00:10:21,687
so we can move on with our lives.

128
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,320
Just like what you said to me,

129
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,890
you told me to keep my sorrow in my pocket.

130
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,390
Here.

131
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,100
Today,

132
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:55,510
I understood what dad said to me.

133
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,120
He said that,

134
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,500
in every loss,

135
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,580
there is something beautiful left behind.

136
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,740
- Ah, we started this off with the Thai BBQ.
- Umm.

137
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,120
- So we should end it with the BBQ.
- Umm.

138
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,120
This is my secret recipe.

139
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,000
BBQ pork with egg yolk dip.

140
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:13,040
I want to taste this so badly.

141
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,000
Umm.

142
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,260
Since we passed away,

143
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,390
I could eat normally

144
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:31,060
but we never tasted the flavors.

145
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:38,290
What can I do to make you taste it?

146
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,600
I have no idea.

147
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,750
But that's alright,

148
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:48,760
I'm just glad we can have a meal together.

149
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,090
Well…

150
00:12:56,763 --> 00:12:59,400
Try my method.

151
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,400
Maybe, it'll work.

152
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:20,380
Normally, we have to ignite
incense sticks before praying.

153
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,240
We should try that..

154
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:35,260
Blow it gently.

155
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,530
Does it work?

156
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,120
Mom, your pork is very salty…

157
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,620
Oops, really? Let me try.

158
00:13:58,532 --> 00:14:01,443
Very salty, honey.

159
00:14:01,443 --> 00:14:04,520
And you all never told me about this.

160
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,920
I can't taste it,
how can I know it's this salty?

161
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,880
Let's eat.

162
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:18,850
Woah, I almost forgot this flavors.

163
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:24,590
Seriously? Your first choice of taste
after death is a cabbage?

164
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:29,240
Try this pork belly.

165
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:34,180
Better not. It's fatty.

166
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:37,640
Oh, right.

167
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,760
Wait, are you insane?

168
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,360
I'd better eat the cabbage.

169
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,490
The cabbage tastes much better.

170
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,820
Let's eat up.

171
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,960
Yeah.

172
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,200
- Yeah.
- That's not salty, I guarantee.

173
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,620
Let's have the pork.

174
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,470
Hey.

175
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,580
- Is it delicious?
- Yummy.

176
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,550
Come on.

177
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:06,750
- Yeah.
- Cheers, kids.

(text)

179
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,380
Tune the guitar for me.

180
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,360
Okay.

181
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,290
I'll do it for you.

182
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,490
Alright.

183
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:07,600
I'm sorry, dad.

184
00:16:08,691 --> 00:16:10,720
What's the matter?

185
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,780
After we died,

186
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,310
I was always aware

187
00:16:19,792 --> 00:16:22,852
that I always behaved badly toward you.

188
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,660
It's not your fault to be mad at me.

189
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,560
Right?

190
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,850
I-I-

191
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:35,380
I was the one that…

192
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,560
Not like that.

193
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,430
It's not your fault.

194
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,250
I shouldn't have blamed you, dad.

195
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,730
I know…

196
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,560
You are willing to accept all the blame…

197
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,700
because...

198
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,740
you love me.

199
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,550
I'm sorry, dad.

200
00:17:15,173 --> 00:17:17,403
Don't be mad at me, okay?

201
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,060
No worry.

202
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,560
Why are you laughing?

203
00:17:35,226 --> 00:17:37,926
I laughed at you..

204
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,400
The last time you cried

205
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,790
with the running nose was

206
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,950
when you crashed your bicycle
and lost your teeth.

207
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,420
Do you remember that?

208
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,880
Of course.

209
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,260
Stop mocking me.

210
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:17,270
Why are you talking about
this stuff out of the blue?

211
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,300
Don't worry, dear.

212
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,260
At least…

213
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,480
I'm glad we had a talk.

214
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:49,360
Don't cry anymore, my child. Don't cry.

215
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,140
I love you.

216
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,200
You.

217
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,130
It's my first time seeing
See-Nam play a guitar.

218
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:02,280
That's so cool.

219
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,870
Ask her who the teacher is.

220
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:09,730
You taught her?

221
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:13,060
Yes.

222
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:16,660
I didn't know who she was pursuing.

223
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,220
She just came to me and
asked me to teach her that.

224
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:23,700
You seem very close to Auntie Jeab's family.

225
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,440
Yes.

226
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:37,910
But I never wanted to
come to their funeral like this.

227
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:44,380
- You.
- Hmm?

228
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:47,520
We're here to enjoy ourselves today.

229
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,100
I'm sorry.

230
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,600
See-Nam..

231
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,680
See-Nam.

232
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,990
See-Nam…

233
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,090
See-Nam.

234
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:11,600
This isn't funny at all..

235
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,710
What's happening, See-Foon?

236
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:19,690
You two haven't
done some terrible things, right?

237
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,840
Leave him alone for now.

238
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,900
Show me your points..

239
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,490
Are you insane?

240
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,460
What have you spent them on?

241
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,700
They redeemed their points for me.

242
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,700
For what?

243
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,220
They wanted me to meet my dad,

244
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,590
so they combined their points.

245
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:57,500
Pluem, you asked them that?

246
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:02,260
How can you do this to me?

247
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:05,130
- I'm so sorry.
- Sorry?

248
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,260
Will See-Nam come back?

249
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:12,050
Uncle Art, Pluem's dad died…

250
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:21,950
Uncle Art.

251
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,860
I'm sorry.

252
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,260
I didn't know it would end like this.

253
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:37,270
Honey, See-Nam is our talented daughter.

254
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,030
She's the older sister to See-Foon.

255
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,790
She's a sister who loves Pluem.

256
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:52,920
I believe See-Nam was willing
to help Pluem see his dad.

257
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,020
I asked for See-Nam's help.

258
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,060
- No, it's not like that, kid.
- I was wrong.

259
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:03,020
No, it's not. Don't say that.

260
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,660
Don't say that… It's not like that.

261
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:08,340
See-Nam isn't here because of me.

262
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,840
Foon.

263
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,700
- It's entirely my fault.
- Foon.

264
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,300
- Foon.
- See-Foon..

265
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,040
- Foon.
- Pluem and I will look after him.

266
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,180
See-Foon, are you in here?

267
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,270
See-Foon, stop that.

268
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,460
What are you doing?
What are you going through her things?

269
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:07,630
See-Foon, tell us what you're doing.

270
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,280
I have to find out

271
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:18,400
what the last thing See-Nam
wanted to do before death.

272
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,920
See-Foon, calm down.

273
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,840
I shouldn't have asked See-Nam for her points.

274
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,870
If she'd had points left,
she could've exchanged them for Last Day

275
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,350
and rest in peace.

276
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:56,280
She wouldn't disappear, like this.

277
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,120
Kevin…

278
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,680
What is it?

279
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,600
This box rings a bell for me.

280
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:39,460
This is the song See-Nam wrote.

281
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,260
There's something written here.

282
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,980
See-Foon…

283
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,510
I'm being serious.

284
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:08,240
There's no way we can find out her last desire.

285
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:13,830
But if you want to do something for her,

286
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,350
both of us will help you with it.

287
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,980
Are you ready?

288
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:39,430

307

♫ I will say, "love you" ♫

342
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:43,710
We should split here.

343
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:45,745
- I'm joining you later.
- Okay, bye.

344
00:30:45,745 --> 00:30:47,564
- Bye.
- See you.

345

♫ Tonight the sky is full of stars ♫

347
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:03,290
Umm, I'm See-Nam.

348
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:04,740
You're Prim, right?

349
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,901
Oh, yes.

350
00:31:06,901 --> 00:31:10,711
Can I have your phone number?

Thanks.

357
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,900
Can I call you sometimes?

358
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,780
Sure.

367
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:35,460
Hey, these are kittens, aren't they?

368
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,980
Where did you them?

369
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:42,880
I just picked them up.

370
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,230
Some chased me and I ran away.

371
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:54,140
Don't you know it's sinful to
split the mother from the children.

372
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:58,500
Come on. Return them to their mommy.

373
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,520
I didn't intend to sin.

374
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:06,620
After I know which one is See-Nam,
I will return the rest to their mother.

375
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,330
Which one?

376
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,980
Which one is her?

377
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:18,380
What are you doing?

378
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:20,910
You told me that, didn't you?

379
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:26,160
You said after the points run out,
we will be reborn as cats or dogs.

380
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,230
I'm just here to ask which one is See-Nam.

381
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:34,260
So I can ask Pluem and Kevin
to take care of her.

382
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:38,525
Are you insane? That was just a joke.

383
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,460
Just a joke?

384
00:33:44,247 --> 00:33:46,240
Is it funny to you?

385
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,100
An old man bullying kids?

386
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,240
You're so mean.

387
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,790
Learn to restrain your feelings.

388
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:04,850
Your family passed away already.

389
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,220
Don't forget that.

390
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:14,460
Your remaining existence in this world
isn't permanent.

391
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:19,160
Instead of being sad like this,

392
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:23,820
you should make your remaining time count.

393
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,550
Your time isn't much now.

394
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,300
Come on, find your last mission.

395
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:37,060
Complete it before your time is running out.

396
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,130
Let's play the roller coaster.

397
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:46,080
Have you been ordained?

398
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,900
Ordained?

399
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,100
Yes, I have.

400
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:54,560
Do you have a crush?

401
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,940
What are you asking, Pluem?

402
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,750
I'm still young.

403
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:04,930
But I had a crush on an intern teacher.

404
00:35:06,699 --> 00:35:08,740
You're blushing.

405
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,980
You had a crush on a teacher?

406
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:13,100
But she's married now.

407
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:20,630
Or… you wanted some adult experience.

408
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,500
Pitipong.

409
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:27,050
(dialogue)

410
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:31,300
Talking about teachers,

411
00:35:33,439 --> 00:35:35,960
is your last desire related to school?

412
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:40,230
Do you have a friend
you still want to say goodbye to?

413
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:46,090
Of course, I do.

414
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:51,110
Kevin, do you remember
what I talked to you in your dream?

415
00:35:51,959 --> 00:35:54,550
I was stressed out. My friends didn't
help me with a project.

416
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:55,850
Ah.

417
00:35:55,850 --> 00:36:00,670
And I deleted their names
from the report.

418
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:05,460
After that, I was boycotted by the group.

419
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:13,940
They threatened my classmates
not to talk to me, be close to me, or hang out with me.

420
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:16,980
I had to have lunch all by myself for months.

421
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:22,860
In the end, I had to be their servant.

422
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:28,460
I had to buy food & drinks for them
and did their homework.

423
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:31,780
If I didn't obey them,
I wouldn't have any friends at all.

424
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:35,140
Why didn't you tell me that?

425
00:36:35,687 --> 00:36:39,887
What would you do? Punch them at the school?

426
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,983
No.

427
00:36:42,983 --> 00:36:47,576
At least, I could report them to the teachers.

428
00:36:47,576 --> 00:36:49,810
I already did…

429
00:36:50,699 --> 00:36:56,240
I told the teacher, dad, and mom about it.

430
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:00,740
But no one really helped me with that.

431
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:06,160
That means your last mission

432
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,680
is vengeance?

433
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:13,000
I think so.

434
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,060
They hurt me.

435
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:20,420
They have to pay.

436
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:29,810
Are you sure you have nothing else
you want to do?

437
00:37:33,006 --> 00:37:38,256
That's the only unfinished business in my life.

438
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,810
Alright,

439
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:46,600
what do you want? Let us know, boss.

440
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,640
[GHOST ID: GH202215347 LAST DAY]

441
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Can you see me now?

442
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,740
Thank you for your help.

443
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:17,500
And I'm sorry for bothering you.

444
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,370
Are you sure of that?

445
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:28,460
Actually, you can live for a while
with the remaining points.

446
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:31,110
You really want to exchange it
for the Last Day?

447
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,060
You can still change your mind.

448
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:38,440
I've thought it through.

449
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:43,960
There is a place I want to take
Pluem and Kevin to.

450
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,290
Good luck.

451
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:12,320
Hey, be careful, kid.

452
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,900
Hey, do you want to die?

453
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,960
Are you okay, See-Foon?

454
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:48,380
I used to think that

455
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:54,410
being dead is better than living.

456
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:58,290
I don't feel the punch anymore.

457
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:08,200
But now, It's a shame.

458
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,250
I don't have a chance to live
in this world anymore.

459
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:18,280
What are you going to do, See-Foon?

460
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,160
Everyone…

461
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:31,000
We have to submit this next class.

462
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,220
Please help me with this.

463
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,300
Let me see.

464
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:41,100
It's almost done, isn't it?

465
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:44,460
Just finish it and we're all done.

466
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:49,180
Yea, right. You almost finished it.

467
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,260
We can watch a movie together right after.

468
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:53,760
Don't you want to watch a movie with us?

469
00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:00,820
Or, You don't want to come with us, Donut?

470
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:05,580
You like being alone, having lunch,

471
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:08,300
or going places by yourself?

472
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,418
We can give that privilege to you.

473
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,860
What's wrong? Are you mad at us?

474
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:40,200
No, I just misspelled something.
Can you hand me a correction pen?

475
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,620
Why don't you come and pick it yourself?

476
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,820
Just quickly hand her that so it can be done.

477
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,860
Holy shit.

478
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:13,620
Teacher… Help us, please. The ghost scared us..

479
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:15,990
What ghost, Natchaya?

480
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:40,700
This is just planning. You seem so satisfied.

481
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:44,060
Your plan is so outdated.
Are you sure you want to do that?

482
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:44,920
Hey.

483
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,420
You'll be mocked up by other ghosts
with that plan.

484
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:49,230
Pluem…

485
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:52,580
- Don't tease him.
- What?

486
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:55,460
You smiled. I saw that.

487
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:02,080
Finish what you want to do.

488
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,760
I'm feeling hungry, standing here.

489
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,820
"Instead of being sad like this,"

490
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:14,830
"you should make your remaining time count."

491
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:21,190
Actually, I think we still have time.

492
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,900
Do you want the same topping?

493
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,480
Yes, miss.

What topping?

495
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:38,580
Chili paste, pork floss,
and strawberry jam on top.

This kid ordered that every day.
But he's been gone for a while.

Where is he?

He must be somewhere around here.
How can he be gone?

505

His merit points aren't running
to zero like See-Nam, right?

506
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:29,500
He exchanged them with the Last Day, didn't he?

507
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:33,490
Or his time limit is over?

508
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:37,750
No, it's not. I remember he has
more than an hour left.

Very tasty.

Otherwise, we could be closer siblings.

531

But both of you don't need to be sad, OK?

532

I've learned that
we shouldn't feel bad about the past.

having a crepe with you.

This is the best moment ever.

Actually, I didn't come here for the revenge.

I should have visited Thailand more often

548

so I could help you practice ballroom dance.

549
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,100
You could teach me how to play football.

550

And we both could go ghost hunting together.
