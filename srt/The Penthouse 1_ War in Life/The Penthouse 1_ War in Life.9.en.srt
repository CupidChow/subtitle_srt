Sugar was

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,063
Min Seol A's dog?

9
00:00:53,397 --> 00:00:55,688
Both Min Seol A and Sugar

10
00:00:56,564 --> 00:00:57,938
died in this house.

11
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,355
What's going on?

12
00:01:19,522 --> 00:01:20,438
Ro Na.

13
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:23,522
Let's move.

14
00:01:25,522 --> 00:01:27,355
I don't think I can live here.

15
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,896

=Episode 9=

17
00:01:36,938 --> 00:01:37,938
mess up my business?

18
00:01:38,646 --> 00:01:41,438
It's not the time to relax and work out.

19
00:01:41,855 --> 00:01:43,646
Darn it, man.

20
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:45,063
Oh Yoon Hee.

21
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:46,646
Did you see

22
00:01:47,021 --> 00:01:48,021
that woman?

23
00:01:48,646 --> 00:01:50,105
I had to mortgage

24
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,729
my firm's building

25
00:01:51,813 --> 00:01:53,313
behind my dad's back.

26
00:01:53,397 --> 00:01:54,480
We have to come up with a plan

27
00:01:54,564 --> 00:01:55,688
and make a careful move.

28
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,021
What am I supposed to do

29
00:01:57,105 --> 00:01:57,980
just by seeing her?

30
00:01:58,397 --> 00:02:00,397
What about you two?

31
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:02,230
Did you find anything on her?

32
00:02:02,313 --> 00:02:04,522
Your attitude is getting on my nerves.

33
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:07,021
Who do you think got us into this mess?

34
00:02:08,313 --> 00:02:09,646
You didn't give her

35
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,063
the information, did you?

36
00:02:11,146 --> 00:02:12,896
Are you kidding me?

37
00:02:14,188 --> 00:02:15,063
Yes.

38
00:02:17,438 --> 00:02:18,397
That night!

39
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,146
Dr. Ha,

40
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:22,272
you had a drink with Oh Yoon Hee.

41
00:02:22,855 --> 00:02:24,272
You had an affair with her,

42
00:02:24,355 --> 00:02:25,855
and you gave her this information.

43
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:27,188
Hey, Ha Yoon Chul!

44
00:02:28,021 --> 00:02:29,813
What kind of nonsense is that?

45
00:02:31,146 --> 00:02:32,646
Are you saying I was a spy or what?

46
00:02:32,729 --> 00:02:34,272
I even put my friends' money in this.

47
00:02:34,355 --> 00:02:35,480
Why on earth would I do that?

48
00:02:35,813 --> 00:02:36,855
It wasn't me.

49
00:02:37,063 --> 00:02:38,355
I can swear over Eun Byeol.

50
00:02:38,438 --> 00:02:40,646
I really hope you're telling the truth.

51
00:02:40,896 --> 00:02:42,896
If not, I'll kill you.

52
00:02:47,355 --> 00:02:49,313
That means someone gave her information

53
00:02:50,438 --> 00:02:52,397
and has been giving her help.

54
00:02:53,272 --> 00:02:54,397
How did that information get out...

55
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,855
"System Check"

56
00:03:02,938 --> 00:03:05,146
"Checking the system"

57
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:06,188
"A spying app has been detected"

61
00:03:21,855 --> 00:03:23,855
"You're being tapped"

62
00:03:26,397 --> 00:03:27,564
The tapping app on your device

63
00:03:27,688 --> 00:03:28,646
has been deleted.

64
00:03:30,855 --> 00:03:33,105
Who dared to do this on my phone?

65
00:03:34,855 --> 00:03:35,813
In three months,

66
00:03:36,605 --> 00:03:37,605
the redevelopment of Bosong Village

67
00:03:37,646 --> 00:03:38,564
will be announced.

68
00:03:39,313 --> 00:03:40,729
The biggest shopping district in Korea

69
00:03:40,813 --> 00:03:41,688
will be built here.

70
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,480
Try to find as much money as you can.

71
00:03:44,188 --> 00:03:45,813
I guarantee at least fivefold of profit.

72
00:03:52,313 --> 00:03:54,855
Could it be you, Soo Ryeon?

73
00:04:03,397 --> 00:04:05,063
"No signal detected"

74
00:04:07,688 --> 00:04:09,855
"No signal detected"

75
00:04:35,522 --> 00:04:36,438
Honey.

76
00:04:36,896 --> 00:04:38,105
What brings you to my study?

77
00:04:39,397 --> 00:04:40,771
I wanted to borrow one of your books.

78
00:04:43,688 --> 00:04:44,605
Look for it.

79
00:05:07,522 --> 00:05:08,980
I couldn't detect anything.

80
00:05:09,605 --> 00:05:10,564
Nothing?

81
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,146
I need to get ready for work.

82
00:05:22,646 --> 00:05:23,771
Did you want to see me, Chairman Joo?

83
00:05:24,355 --> 00:05:26,230
Has my wife shown any weird behaviours?

84
00:05:26,564 --> 00:05:28,480
Nothing out of the ordinary.

85
00:05:28,771 --> 00:05:30,313
She gets along with the children

86
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:32,896
as well as other parents.

87
00:05:33,771 --> 00:05:34,688
Other parents? Who?

88
00:05:34,771 --> 00:05:35,646
The mother of a girl named Bae Ro Na,

89
00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:37,105
one of Seok Kyung's friends,

90
00:05:37,355 --> 00:05:39,188
came to visit her at home a few days ago.

91
00:05:40,688 --> 00:05:42,188
Bae Ro Na's mother?

92
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,146
Oh Yoon Hee?

93
00:05:44,397 --> 00:05:45,272
Ms Sim

94
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:47,688
has met with her a few times.

95
00:05:49,688 --> 00:05:51,272
Why are you telling me this now?

96
00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:01,146
Could you be in league

97
00:06:01,522 --> 00:06:02,813
with Oh Yoon Hee?

98
00:06:05,105 --> 00:06:07,105
You have to go to work again?

99
00:06:07,397 --> 00:06:09,021
The kids are going on a field trip today,

100
00:06:09,105 --> 00:06:10,230
so Ms Cheon is taking the day off.

101
00:06:10,564 --> 00:06:12,771
I thought we should grab lunch together.

102
00:06:12,938 --> 00:06:14,355
The women of Hera Club

103
00:06:14,438 --> 00:06:15,564
should get together with this chance.

104
00:06:16,313 --> 00:06:17,438
All right.

105
00:06:17,688 --> 00:06:19,230
You should get going.

106
00:06:19,771 --> 00:06:20,771
Is she busy?

107
00:06:21,021 --> 00:06:22,397
Why can't she take a day off

108
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,355
if she's the CEO?

109
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,146
If the mother begins to work outside

110
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,313
in this important period for her kids,

111
00:06:26,397 --> 00:06:27,855
it'll end up showing in her kids.

112
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:30,313
Why did she suddenly start her business?

113
00:06:30,438 --> 00:06:32,980
Her parents own Simwoon Construction.

114
00:06:33,313 --> 00:06:34,980
It was one of the top five

115
00:06:35,063 --> 00:06:36,021
construction firms in Korea.

116
00:06:36,105 --> 00:06:37,355
If she took after her father,

117
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:38,605
I'm sure she has a knack for business.

118
00:06:38,646 --> 00:06:41,063
Isn't that company gone without a trace?

119
00:06:41,313 --> 00:06:42,896
They still have their furniture company,

120
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,522
and it's the best in Korea.

121
00:06:51,605 --> 00:06:52,646
Hello?

122
00:06:52,896 --> 00:06:53,813
Yes, it's me.

123
00:06:55,188 --> 00:06:56,146
Goodness.

124
00:06:57,646 --> 00:06:58,938
Why did you call so late?

125
00:06:59,021 --> 00:07:00,646
I've been waiting for you to call.

126
00:07:01,105 --> 00:07:02,272
I don't have any plans.

127
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:03,272
What plans?

128
00:07:03,355 --> 00:07:04,480
I mean, you're calling me.

129
00:07:06,021 --> 00:07:07,646
I'll do that right now.

130
00:07:08,355 --> 00:07:09,313
Okay.

131
00:07:12,646 --> 00:07:13,480
I'm sorry.

132
00:07:13,564 --> 00:07:15,313
Something came up, so I have to go.

133
00:07:15,688 --> 00:07:17,688
This is too important, so I can't help it.

134
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,188
Then you can stay to the end.

135
00:07:19,771 --> 00:07:20,771
She's doing that again!

136
00:07:24,813 --> 00:07:27,771
Doesn't Ma Ri seem suspicious, Ms Cheon?

137
00:07:28,355 --> 00:07:29,272
Why?

138
00:07:29,397 --> 00:07:30,605
This wasn't the first time she ran out

139
00:07:30,646 --> 00:07:32,063
after she gets a call like that.

140
00:07:32,522 --> 00:07:34,355
I don't know who she's seeing,

141
00:07:34,605 --> 00:07:36,605
but she comes back with her hands

142
00:07:36,646 --> 00:07:38,605
full of luxury brand shopping bags.

143
00:07:40,397 --> 00:07:42,896
And she always showers before she returns.

144
00:07:43,646 --> 00:07:44,605
What?

145
00:07:44,855 --> 00:07:46,771
Well, a few days ago...

146
00:07:52,813 --> 00:07:54,230
Ma Ri! - My goodness!

147
00:07:54,397 --> 00:07:55,313
My gosh.

148
00:07:55,896 --> 00:07:57,021
Where have you been?

149
00:07:57,188 --> 00:07:58,063
Well...

150
00:07:58,438 --> 00:07:59,397
To the department store.

151
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:01,355
I went shopping for once.

152
00:08:01,688 --> 00:08:04,021
I guess shopping diet is perfect for me.

153
00:08:04,105 --> 00:08:05,646
I lose two kilograms easily

154
00:08:05,729 --> 00:08:07,313
once I take a tour of the store.

155
00:08:09,896 --> 00:08:10,813
That bag.

156
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:12,980
Did you get that today?

157
00:08:15,438 --> 00:08:16,605
Isn't it pretty?

158
00:08:16,813 --> 00:08:18,355
It's the hottest new product.

159
00:08:18,813 --> 00:08:20,355
Ashlyn Pearce did a photoshoot with this

160
00:08:20,438 --> 00:08:21,605
in a fashion magazine,

161
00:08:21,646 --> 00:08:22,896
then it became very popular.

162
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,397
You saw it too, right?

163
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:26,980
But it never came to Korea.

164
00:08:27,355 --> 00:08:28,646
How did you get it?

165
00:08:28,855 --> 00:08:29,813
Actually,

166
00:08:30,272 --> 00:08:32,688
a closed friend of mine got it in Europe.

167
00:08:32,938 --> 00:08:33,896
But she didn't like it,

168
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,105
so she gave it to me.

169
00:08:36,313 --> 00:08:38,146
Who would give you such an expensive bag?

170
00:08:38,522 --> 00:08:40,480
That's limited edition,

171
00:08:40,564 --> 00:08:42,397
so even famous celebrities can't get that.

172
00:08:43,438 --> 00:08:45,355
She gave it as a gift because it's rare.

173
00:08:45,438 --> 00:08:47,355
I'm friends with many influential women.

174
00:08:47,605 --> 00:08:48,646
Goodbye, then.

175
00:08:50,855 --> 00:08:52,480
This wasn't your perfume this morning.

176
00:08:52,896 --> 00:08:54,230
You put on your makeup again too.

177
00:08:54,855 --> 00:08:56,980
Where in the world have you been?

178
00:08:57,272 --> 00:08:58,146
By any chance--

179
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,063
By what chance?

180
00:08:59,646 --> 00:09:01,272
Are you that bored?

181
00:09:01,355 --> 00:09:02,813
Why do you remember my perfume?

182
00:09:03,146 --> 00:09:04,355
This is why Min Hyuk

183
00:09:04,438 --> 00:09:05,646
has always been the worst student.

184
00:09:05,771 --> 00:09:06,813
If you're that bored,

185
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,105
you should take better care of your kid!

186
00:09:09,896 --> 00:09:10,855
Goodness.

187
00:09:12,313 --> 00:09:13,605
She must be seeing a guy.

188
00:09:13,646 --> 00:09:14,855
She definitely has a rich man on the side.

189
00:09:14,938 --> 00:09:16,855
Isn't it disgusting for a woman

190
00:09:16,938 --> 00:09:19,230
with a daughter go out and have an affair?

191
00:09:19,313 --> 00:09:20,813
Isn't it embarrassing to face Je Ni?

192
00:09:20,896 --> 00:09:22,063
My gosh.

193
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:24,397
But you didn't see her having an affair.

194
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,480
You know it's considered libel

195
00:09:25,813 --> 00:09:27,522
for you to jump to that conclusion, right?

196
00:09:29,438 --> 00:09:30,813
I'll pretend I didn't hear this.

197
00:09:32,021 --> 00:09:33,355
Ma Ri is gone,

198
00:09:33,729 --> 00:09:35,729
so let's grab lunch next time.

199
00:09:39,188 --> 00:09:40,688
I told you he did that.

200
00:09:40,771 --> 00:09:41,688
I'm telling you, man.

201
00:09:41,771 --> 00:09:43,313
Hey, stop laughing.

202
00:09:44,896 --> 00:09:46,355
He just told us not to laugh.

203
00:09:46,564 --> 00:09:47,564
But it's hilarious.

204
00:09:48,438 --> 00:09:50,355
Hey, wash everything clean!

205
00:09:50,771 --> 00:09:51,729
"From an Artist to a CEO,"

206
00:09:51,813 --> 00:09:52,729
"Sim Soo Ryeon of Jakomo"

207
00:09:54,771 --> 00:09:56,146
Look at those idiots.

208
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,397
Sim Soo Ryeon.

209
00:09:58,646 --> 00:09:59,896
The wife of Chairman Joo Dan Tae

210
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,480
of JKING Holdings.

211
00:10:02,438 --> 00:10:03,980
Darn it, man.

212
00:10:11,063 --> 00:10:12,230
Sugar died?

213
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:13,980
She already fell in love with her,

214
00:10:14,063 --> 00:10:15,564
so Ro Na was heartbroken.

215
00:10:15,813 --> 00:10:16,646
She came with me

216
00:10:16,729 --> 00:10:17,646
to the columbarium this morning,

217
00:10:17,729 --> 00:10:19,188
then went to school crying.

218
00:10:19,646 --> 00:10:20,855
She grew up all alone,

219
00:10:21,438 --> 00:10:22,688
so she gives her heart away easily.

220
00:10:24,813 --> 00:10:26,063
I see.

221
00:10:27,771 --> 00:10:29,813
I hoped she would take good care of Sugar.

222
00:10:30,605 --> 00:10:31,438
Right.

223
00:10:31,729 --> 00:10:33,063
How's your husband doing?

224
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,313
He's probably anxious to death

225
00:10:35,397 --> 00:10:37,188
after losing that auction.

226
00:10:40,564 --> 00:10:41,522
Soo Ryeon.

227
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,397
Soo Ryeon.

228
00:10:44,855 --> 00:10:45,771
Hey.

229
00:10:45,855 --> 00:10:47,438
How's your husband doing?

230
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:48,522
Right.

231
00:10:48,813 --> 00:10:50,564
He doesn't make it obvious at home.

232
00:10:52,063 --> 00:10:53,771
What's your plan?

233
00:10:54,938 --> 00:10:57,021
I'll make him pay as much as possible.

234
00:10:57,813 --> 00:10:59,646
I'm sure I can get him to pay anything.

235
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,188
How much should I ask for?

236
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:05,646
I don't know anything about that field.

237
00:11:06,063 --> 00:11:07,438
Do as you'd like, Yoon Hee.

238
00:11:07,813 --> 00:11:08,938
May I really do that?

239
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:13,480
One second.

240
00:11:17,313 --> 00:11:18,272
Hello?

241
00:11:19,355 --> 00:11:20,896
My name is Joo Dan Tae.

242
00:11:21,438 --> 00:11:22,605
We've met a few times before.

243
00:11:24,313 --> 00:11:25,646
Aren't you Seok Hoon's father?

244
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,855
"JKING Holdings"

245
00:11:35,146 --> 00:11:36,188
Ms Oh Yoon Hee is here.

246
00:11:36,813 --> 00:11:37,688
Let her in.

247
00:11:45,522 --> 00:11:46,646
Thank you for coming.

248
00:11:46,896 --> 00:11:47,855
Please have a seat.

249
00:11:48,646 --> 00:11:50,272
Do not get intimidated or let him catch

250
00:11:50,355 --> 00:11:51,355
that you're flustered.

251
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,063
He gets stronger before the weak.

252
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,646
Why did you want to see me?

253
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,021
Would you like some tea?

254
00:12:01,729 --> 00:12:02,646
I'm fine.

255
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:03,605
I have another engagement,

256
00:12:03,646 --> 00:12:04,646
so I must leave early.

257
00:12:05,397 --> 00:12:06,313
In that case,

258
00:12:06,938 --> 00:12:08,438
let me be frank with you.

259
00:12:09,522 --> 00:12:11,105
You bought a house in Myeong-dong

260
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,397
in an auction, didn't you?

261
00:12:12,605 --> 00:12:14,355
How did you know?

262
00:12:14,564 --> 00:12:16,646
You must be very lucky.

263
00:12:17,564 --> 00:12:18,646
You bought a house in Bosong Village

264
00:12:18,729 --> 00:12:19,980
before the redevelopment announcement,

265
00:12:20,646 --> 00:12:21,646
and now, the house in Myeong-dong.

266
00:12:23,397 --> 00:12:26,480
Well, did you dig up my back?

267
00:12:27,896 --> 00:12:29,230
Let's say I just got interested.

268
00:12:30,105 --> 00:12:31,397
How did you get your hands

269
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,646
on the information?

270
00:12:33,188 --> 00:12:34,605
If you got interested in me,

271
00:12:34,646 --> 00:12:35,646
I'm sure you know why.

272
00:12:36,646 --> 00:12:38,355
I've been in the real estate for a decade.

273
00:12:38,522 --> 00:12:40,438
Naturally, I developed a good eye in

274
00:12:40,522 --> 00:12:42,480
spotting a good property when I see one.

275
00:12:42,771 --> 00:12:44,105
I doubt that house

276
00:12:44,188 --> 00:12:45,646
will be of any use to you.

277
00:12:46,272 --> 00:12:48,021
That house is about to crumble down,

278
00:12:48,105 --> 00:12:49,146
and you couldn't build up a building

279
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,355
in that tiny little space.

280
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:52,896
I know that very well.

281
00:12:53,646 --> 00:12:55,272
I bought that house

282
00:12:55,355 --> 00:12:56,438
as an investment.

283
00:12:57,564 --> 00:12:58,605
Rumours say

284
00:12:58,646 --> 00:13:00,605
a shopping centre will be built nearby.

285
00:13:01,063 --> 00:13:03,105
But I'm sure you're aware.

286
00:13:04,438 --> 00:13:05,313
Sell it to me.

287
00:13:05,771 --> 00:13:07,188
I'll give you 30 per cent more.

288
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,063
If you keep that useless house,

289
00:13:09,146 --> 00:13:10,272
you'll only end up

290
00:13:10,355 --> 00:13:11,438
paying more taxes.

291
00:13:12,855 --> 00:13:14,105
What you just said sounds like

292
00:13:14,688 --> 00:13:17,438
that house is absolutely valuable.

293
00:13:23,855 --> 00:13:25,729
I like how bold you are, Ms Oh,

294
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:27,729
as much as your beautiful looks.

295
00:13:28,771 --> 00:13:30,146
Don't let his manners fool you.

296
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,355
He'll try to use

297
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:35,105
his eloquence to capture your heart.

298
00:13:36,729 --> 00:13:38,355
I heard your husband passed away,

299
00:13:38,896 --> 00:13:41,272
and you raised your daughter all alone.

300
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:43,855
In your life, you will

301
00:13:43,938 --> 00:13:45,980
come across only a limited amount of luck.

302
00:13:46,688 --> 00:13:47,771
It looks like your great fortune

303
00:13:47,855 --> 00:13:48,896
has already found you and left.

304
00:13:52,438 --> 00:13:53,438
All right.

305
00:13:53,855 --> 00:13:55,063
I'll give you double the price you paid.

306
00:13:55,522 --> 00:13:57,146
You won't find another offer like this.

307
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:00,230
That's not a bad proposal.

308
00:14:01,105 --> 00:14:02,313
I'm glad you like it.

309
00:14:02,397 --> 00:14:03,272
Okay, then.

310
00:14:03,605 --> 00:14:04,938
Let's fill out the paperwork.

311
00:14:06,355 --> 00:14:08,313
"Real Estate Purchase Agreement"

312
00:14:09,021 --> 00:14:10,021
One second.

313
00:14:11,146 --> 00:14:12,980
I said it's not a bad offer.

314
00:14:13,397 --> 00:14:15,146
I didn't say I'll accept it.

315
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,188
What...

316
00:14:21,063 --> 00:14:22,230
are you trying to do?

317
00:14:25,522 --> 00:14:26,480
He has a habit of rubbing his fingers

318
00:14:26,564 --> 00:14:27,688
when he gets anxious.

319
00:14:28,771 --> 00:14:29,980
That's when you should make your move.

320
00:14:33,021 --> 00:14:34,480
I'm saying I decline.

321
00:14:37,313 --> 00:14:38,980
I have to be somewhere, so I must go.

322
00:14:39,105 --> 00:14:40,522
That was a fun conversation.

323
00:14:42,646 --> 00:14:43,646
Ms Oh.

324
00:14:47,105 --> 00:14:48,646
I heard you're close to my wife.

325
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,522
Is that how you found out?

326
00:14:52,729 --> 00:14:54,605
Did my wife hand over

327
00:14:55,771 --> 00:14:56,813
this information to you?

328
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,605
I'm not sure if I understand.

329
00:15:00,938 --> 00:15:02,480
Why should Soo Ryeon

330
00:15:02,564 --> 00:15:03,855
do something like that to you?

331
00:15:05,397 --> 00:15:07,646
She seemed to have great respect for you.

332
00:15:10,105 --> 00:15:11,313
I'll not pass on

333
00:15:11,605 --> 00:15:12,896
what you just said to her.

334
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,188
What do you want?

335
00:15:18,355 --> 00:15:19,646
I'll try to accommodate.

336
00:15:21,063 --> 00:15:22,230
What do I want?

337
00:15:24,855 --> 00:15:25,896
Not to sell that place

338
00:15:27,313 --> 00:15:28,313
to you.

339
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,480
What kind of a lunatic is she?

340
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:39,063
Doesn't she know her place?

341
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,021
How dare she bargain with me?

342
00:16:00,605 --> 00:16:02,313
So? What did you say?

343
00:16:04,021 --> 00:16:05,146
I talked big and told him

344
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,438
I won't sell it to him.

345
00:16:08,397 --> 00:16:09,313
Great job.

346
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,980
We have the upper hand anyway.

347
00:16:14,021 --> 00:16:15,605
Okay. Let's talk later.

Hello?

350
00:16:32,272 --> 00:16:33,813
Have you been well,

351
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,230
Ms Sim Soo Ryeon?

352
00:16:36,063 --> 00:16:36,980
Who is this?

353
00:16:37,188 --> 00:16:38,938
Gosh, you're making me sad.

354
00:16:39,021 --> 00:16:40,646
You already forgot what I sound like?

355
00:16:40,896 --> 00:16:42,688
Then what if I called you like this?

356
00:16:43,105 --> 00:16:44,063
Min Seol A's mother.

357
00:16:47,021 --> 00:16:47,980
Director Min?

358
00:16:48,355 --> 00:16:50,980
Goodness, you haven't forgotten.

359
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,021
It's me, Director Min

360
00:16:53,105 --> 00:16:54,146
of Somang Children's Home.

361
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,480
The man who took your daughter in

362
00:16:55,564 --> 00:16:56,522
and brought her up.

363
00:16:57,021 --> 00:16:57,980
You're stuck in jail.

364
00:16:58,063 --> 00:16:59,021
How are you calling me?

365
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:03,605
This place is run by people too.

366
00:17:04,438 --> 00:17:06,230
You killed Assemblyman Cho, didn't you?

367
00:17:07,355 --> 00:17:09,105
Did you feel a little bad for the kid

368
00:17:09,188 --> 00:17:10,105
you abandoned?

369
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,480
You jerk.

370
00:17:12,813 --> 00:17:14,063
You devil.

371
00:17:15,355 --> 00:17:16,896
Your husband has no idea

372
00:17:17,646 --> 00:17:19,438
that Min Seol A is your daughter, does he?

373
00:17:20,063 --> 00:17:22,605
Don't you think this is too unfair?

374
00:17:22,813 --> 00:17:24,021
I began to value justice

375
00:17:24,105 --> 00:17:25,688
now that I'm stuck in prison.

376
00:17:26,063 --> 00:17:27,646
You sold off young kids in fake adoptions.

377
00:17:27,688 --> 00:17:28,980
You still haven't got a grip?

378
00:17:29,522 --> 00:17:31,355
Even the prison is too good for you.

379
00:17:31,646 --> 00:17:32,855
You deserve to die right now.

380
00:17:33,146 --> 00:17:34,230
Bad news, though.

381
00:17:34,605 --> 00:17:35,688
I don't think there's a big chance

382
00:17:35,771 --> 00:17:36,855
you'll live to see me die.

383
00:17:37,355 --> 00:17:38,646
Seol A's mother, don't you think

384
00:17:38,688 --> 00:17:40,063
Chairman Joo will kill you first?

385
00:17:40,688 --> 00:17:42,438
I let him know today

386
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,896
that you're Min Seol A's birth mother.

387
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,105
What?

388
00:17:47,105 --> 00:17:50,146
You got no time to curse me right now.

389
00:17:50,438 --> 00:17:52,063
In half an hour, my gift will arrive

390

Is that for Chairman Joo Dan Tae?

397

Yes.

398
00:19:00,063 --> 00:19:00,896
You can give it to me.

399

You didn't even call.

00:19:16,146 --> 00:19:18,146
I was nearby on business,

407
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,938
so I stopped by to see you.

408
00:19:21,771 --> 00:19:22,813
You don't look so well.

409

Why are you sweating so much?

410
00:19:27,646 --> 00:19:29,355
I guess it's because I'm working again.

411
00:19:29,438 --> 00:19:31,230
I've been worried about some things.

412
00:19:31,438 --> 00:19:32,646
Then why did you start working?

413
00:19:34,146 --> 00:19:35,397
If it's too tough, you can quit now.

414
00:19:36,188 --> 00:19:37,438
It's not that bad.

415

May I have a cup of tea?

Sir, the meeting is about to begin.

You should go. I'll be fine.

you need to get me out of prison.

I said, what brings you here?

to be at your hospital?

last time.

Fine, don't eat with me.

It's not like I'm begging you to do so.

00:24:31,564 --> 00:24:32,646
Yes, this is Joo Dan Tae.

515
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:33,980
I need to see you now.

516
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:35,230
It's an emergency.

517
00:24:35,564 --> 00:24:36,855
I'll head over to the villa first.

518
00:24:58,896 --> 00:25:00,355
What kind of a crazy idiot is this?

519
00:25:02,646 --> 00:25:03,980
Min Seol A must have told someone

520
00:25:04,896 --> 00:25:06,813
before she died.

521
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:08,105
It's that eye.

522
00:25:08,397 --> 00:25:09,355
It's the same one from that time.

523
00:25:10,146 --> 00:25:11,397
The fountain at Hera Palace

524
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,729
and the blackmail with the pocket watch.

525
00:25:13,021 --> 00:25:14,146
It has to be the same person.

526
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,105
Do you think

527
00:25:16,646 --> 00:25:18,522
this person has Min Seol A's phone?

528
00:25:20,688 --> 00:25:23,021
Then that video of us would be there too!

529
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,105
This is great.

530
00:25:24,688 --> 00:25:25,855
We can catch this jerk

531
00:25:25,938 --> 00:25:27,063
and get rid of her phone too.

532
00:25:27,771 --> 00:25:28,813
I couldn't find her phone,

533
00:25:28,896 --> 00:25:29,771
so things never seemed right.

534
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,980
We don't know who has it.

535
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:33,272
How are we going to find it?

536
00:25:34,855 --> 00:25:35,771
Wait,

537
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,272
do you have an idea who it could be?

538
00:25:37,646 --> 00:25:38,522
I do.

539
00:25:38,605 --> 00:25:39,480
Who?

540
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:40,771
Min Seol A's older brother.

541
00:25:42,146 --> 00:25:43,021
Her older brother?

542
00:25:45,729 --> 00:25:47,230
Do you think I came here

543
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,188
without a backup plan?

544
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,980
I have someone who can help me.

545
00:25:52,938 --> 00:25:54,272
If anything bad happens to me,

546
00:25:55,397 --> 00:25:56,480
my brother will find you

547
00:25:56,564 --> 00:25:57,646
and make you pay for this.

548
00:25:58,729 --> 00:25:59,729
I looked into it,

549
00:26:00,021 --> 00:26:01,021
and she was once adopted,

550
00:26:01,105 --> 00:26:02,230
then given up.

551
00:26:02,522 --> 00:26:03,813
She had an older brother with that family.

552
00:26:04,355 --> 00:26:05,688
Are you saying her brother is

553
00:26:05,771 --> 00:26:07,313
blackmailing us right now?

554
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,021
There's no reason for him to do that.

555
00:26:09,146 --> 00:26:10,355
They're not blood relatives.

556
00:26:10,729 --> 00:26:11,646
It can't be him.

557
00:26:11,729 --> 00:26:12,646
How can you be so sure?

558
00:26:12,813 --> 00:26:14,480
I already looked into that family.

559
00:26:15,605 --> 00:26:17,021
The family that adopted Min Seol A is

560
00:26:17,105 --> 00:26:18,480
kept completely hidden,

561
00:26:18,564 --> 00:26:20,063
so I couldn't even find their names.

562
00:26:20,564 --> 00:26:21,938
All we know is that

563
00:26:22,021 --> 00:26:23,480
she was given up because of her theft.

564
00:26:23,771 --> 00:26:24,896
I don't know who it is,

565
00:26:25,397 --> 00:26:26,855
but this family isn't so free

566
00:26:26,938 --> 00:26:28,522
that they'd be concerned about her.

567
00:26:31,105 --> 00:26:33,605
So that brat deceived me once again?

568
00:26:35,272 --> 00:26:36,771
That cheeky girl.

569
00:26:42,938 --> 00:26:44,855
I've been, and still am suspicious of

570
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:47,063
this one person.

571
00:26:47,646 --> 00:26:48,605
Who?

572
00:26:49,729 --> 00:26:50,688
Your wife.

573
00:26:52,397 --> 00:26:54,564
Are you saying she knows about us?

574
00:26:55,021 --> 00:26:56,771
Yet she hasn't said a word to this day?

575
00:26:56,855 --> 00:26:58,021
That sophisticated woman?

576
00:26:59,688 --> 00:27:00,646
No.

577
00:27:00,855 --> 00:27:02,480
She can't bear that, not even for a day.

578
00:27:02,938 --> 00:27:04,646
How many women in Korea

579
00:27:04,729 --> 00:27:06,063
would divorce her husband out of anger

580
00:27:06,146 --> 00:27:07,646
when her husband has an affair?

581
00:27:08,605 --> 00:27:09,771
On top of that,

582
00:27:09,855 --> 00:27:11,646
you're an amazingly rich man.

583
00:27:12,646 --> 00:27:15,188
In order to get more of your fortune,

584
00:27:15,813 --> 00:27:17,313
she might need your weakness.

585
00:27:17,397 --> 00:27:18,646
And that weakness

586
00:27:20,063 --> 00:27:21,272
could be Min Seol A.

587
00:27:21,646 --> 00:27:23,564
What kind of nonsense is this?

588
00:27:23,855 --> 00:27:25,938
Your wife might have seen Min Seol A

589
00:27:26,021 --> 00:27:27,813
fall to her death at Hera Palace.

590
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,896
I keep thinking that

591
00:27:34,438 --> 00:27:35,729
Sim Soo Ryeon is...

592
00:27:37,313 --> 00:27:38,646
putting up an act.

593
00:27:44,646 --> 00:27:45,729
Don't get anxious and wait.

594
00:27:47,188 --> 00:27:48,105
I'll take care of this.

595
00:28:10,646 --> 00:28:12,188
What are you doing here?

596
00:28:14,771 --> 00:28:15,771
How did you get in?

597
00:28:16,021 --> 00:28:18,021
I'm sorry. I got lost.

598
00:28:18,729 --> 00:28:19,688
Great work, good men.

599
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,230
Who is that guy?

600
00:28:23,105 --> 00:28:24,980
"Hera Palace"

601
00:28:27,855 --> 00:28:29,729
Did Soo Ryeon go home right away?

602
00:28:29,938 --> 00:28:31,355
Yes, but there's something odd.

603
00:28:32,146 --> 00:28:33,021
What is it?

604
00:28:33,105 --> 00:28:34,480
A delivery was sent to your office,

605
00:28:34,896 --> 00:28:36,230
but the document is gone.

606
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:37,938
What do you mean?

607
00:28:38,313 --> 00:28:39,771
A delivery that was sent for me is gone?

608
00:28:40,105 --> 00:28:41,105
And it disappeared

609
00:28:41,564 --> 00:28:42,938
when Ms Sim stopped by.

610
00:28:46,313 --> 00:28:47,146
Hello?

611
00:28:47,272 --> 00:28:48,313
It's me, Ms Sim.

612
00:28:48,688 --> 00:28:51,230
Did you receive the gift I sent you?

613
00:28:51,522 --> 00:28:52,896
Why do you do this to me?

614
00:28:53,021 --> 00:28:54,313
What do you want from me?

615
00:28:54,855 --> 00:28:55,771
Darn it.

616
00:28:55,938 --> 00:28:57,522
I already told you.

617
00:28:57,646 --> 00:28:58,813
Get me out of here!

618
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:00,980
You can pay my bail

619
00:29:01,063 --> 00:29:02,063
and pull a few strings.

620
00:29:02,896 --> 00:29:05,146
It'll be a piece of cake for you.

621
00:29:05,938 --> 00:29:07,646
I can't wait too long.

622
00:29:08,063 --> 00:29:09,313
If you can't do it,

623
00:29:09,522 --> 00:29:11,146
may I ask Chairman Joo?

624
00:29:11,272 --> 00:29:12,729
He's going to kill you.

625
00:29:12,938 --> 00:29:13,813
If you don't want to die,

626
00:29:13,896 --> 00:29:14,896
shut your mouth and talk to me.

627
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:18,063
Then come and see me tomorrow.

628
00:29:18,688 --> 00:29:20,105
I'll be expecting you.

629
00:29:21,771 --> 00:29:22,646
Hello?

630
00:29:23,938 --> 00:29:24,855
Hello?

631
00:29:36,355 --> 00:29:38,146
Someone has been threatening her.

632
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:40,230
But who is it?

633
00:29:41,938 --> 00:29:42,938
"Joo Seok Hoon"

634
00:29:43,063 --> 00:29:44,896
"Chocolate Milk"

635
00:29:50,146 --> 00:29:51,938
Hey, what are you doing?

636
00:29:52,646 --> 00:29:54,021
Why are you giving that to Seok Hoon?

637
00:29:54,605 --> 00:29:56,063
I'm giving it to him to thank him.

638
00:29:56,188 --> 00:29:57,105
To thank him?

639
00:29:58,021 --> 00:29:59,146
Unbelievable.

640
00:30:02,063 --> 00:30:05,438
Do you like him?

641
00:30:08,522 --> 00:30:09,771
Mind your business.

642
00:30:09,855 --> 00:30:11,021
You aren't allowed to like him

643
00:30:11,105 --> 00:30:12,146
without permission.

644
00:30:13,105 --> 00:30:14,522
Did you get Seok Kyung's permission?

645
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,272
Permission for what?

646
00:30:16,355 --> 00:30:18,813
Seok Hoon totally belongs to Seok Kyung.

647
00:30:19,397 --> 00:30:22,272
Everyone in our school likes Seok Hoon,

648
00:30:22,397 --> 00:30:24,355
but why do you think he isn't dating?

649
00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:26,480
Stop it. What if Seok Hoon hears you?

650
00:30:26,646 --> 00:30:28,272
I felt bad that she doesn't know her place

651
00:30:28,355 --> 00:30:29,688
to do something like that.

652
00:30:30,313 --> 00:30:32,021
I'm explaining it to her out of goodwill.

653
00:30:32,105 --> 00:30:33,188
I felt bad.

654
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,480
Hey, everyone knows this anyway.

655
00:30:35,564 --> 00:30:36,564
Seok Hoon.

656
00:30:40,646 --> 00:30:41,564
When did you get here?

657
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,438
Thanks, Ro Na.

658
00:30:50,063 --> 00:30:51,021
Thank you for the milk.

659
00:30:51,313 --> 00:30:52,146
Sure.

660
00:30:54,105 --> 00:30:55,021
Hey, Eun Hoo.

661
00:30:59,646 --> 00:31:01,729
Are you up for a game after class today?

662
00:31:02,564 --> 00:31:03,480
I'll meet you at the gym.

663
00:31:03,729 --> 00:31:04,646
What?

664
00:31:05,355 --> 00:31:06,272
Sure.

665
00:31:07,146 --> 00:31:08,021
Let's do that.

666
00:31:09,438 --> 00:31:10,605
Grab your seats.

667
00:31:15,605 --> 00:31:16,564
Bae Ro Na.

668
00:31:18,771 --> 00:31:19,646
Yes, sir.

669
00:31:19,688 --> 00:31:21,021
Why haven't you turned in your report

670
00:31:21,105 --> 00:31:22,480
after watching that performance?

671
00:31:23,021 --> 00:31:23,938
Well,

672
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,230
I couldn't get a ticket,

673
00:31:26,313 --> 00:31:27,313
so I couldn't watch it.

674
00:31:29,188 --> 00:31:30,188
It was sold out,

675
00:31:30,272 --> 00:31:31,564
so I couldn't buy a ticket.

676
00:31:31,646 --> 00:31:33,230
Is that your excuse?

677
00:31:33,688 --> 00:31:34,605
You're the only one

678
00:31:34,646 --> 00:31:35,771
who didn't turn in the report.

679
00:31:37,313 --> 00:31:38,230
Be prepared to see your grade.

680
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,522
"CEO Sim Soo Ryeon"

681
00:31:46,896 --> 00:31:47,855
"Read an entry"

682
00:31:48,813 --> 00:31:49,771
"I came back to Korea"

683
00:31:53,605 --> 00:31:55,063
I came back to Korea,

684
00:31:55,438 --> 00:31:56,272
back to Somang Children's Home,

685
00:31:56,355 --> 00:31:57,188
where my little siblings are.

686
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,605
What are you doing?

687
00:32:08,313 --> 00:32:09,813
Why are you eating dog food?

688
00:32:10,063 --> 00:32:11,397
Seol A?

689
00:32:11,605 --> 00:32:12,938
When did you come back?

690
00:32:13,522 --> 00:32:14,564
Seol A.

691
00:32:15,313 --> 00:32:17,063
I'm hungry.

692
00:32:17,313 --> 00:32:19,021
Do you have any food?

693
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,063
Where's the director?

694
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:22,605
Where's Dad?

695
00:32:22,646 --> 00:32:23,729
You little rascals.

696
00:32:24,146 --> 00:32:25,063
Did you finish the laundry?

697
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,272
If you don't finish cleaning up,

698
00:32:27,397 --> 00:32:28,397
you won't get any food today.

699
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,480
Okay. - Okay.

700
00:32:32,605 --> 00:32:33,522
You're here.

701
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:35,688
Why are you starving them?

702
00:32:35,938 --> 00:32:37,438
You promised not to do that.

703
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:38,980
You get enough support every month.

704
00:32:39,063 --> 00:32:40,313
Why do you let them go without food?

705
00:32:40,397 --> 00:32:41,564
I got a call from the US.

706
00:32:42,397 --> 00:32:43,564
You stole something and got kicked out.

707
00:32:44,397 --> 00:32:45,938
It's brazen of you to come back here.

708
00:32:46,605 --> 00:32:48,063
Aren't you ashamed to face your siblings?

709
00:32:48,438 --> 00:32:50,146
You already had everything set up

710
00:32:50,813 --> 00:32:52,564
to turn me into a thief and kick me out.

711
00:32:53,646 --> 00:32:54,855
They didn't need another daughter

712
00:32:54,938 --> 00:32:56,105
to begin with.

713
00:32:56,729 --> 00:32:57,605
Isn't that so?

714
00:32:57,646 --> 00:32:58,522
You brat!

715
00:32:59,646 --> 00:33:00,646
Shut your mouth!

716
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:04,855
I can't believe what you're saying.

717
00:33:05,522 --> 00:33:07,355
Be grateful they gave an apartment

718
00:33:07,855 --> 00:33:09,146
for a thief like you!

719
00:33:10,771 --> 00:33:12,188
I don't need that darned house.

720
00:33:12,355 --> 00:33:13,230
Really?

721
00:33:15,729 --> 00:33:16,646
Then, Seol A,

722
00:33:17,063 --> 00:33:18,188
you can change the title of your deed

723
00:33:18,646 --> 00:33:19,646
to me.

724
00:33:20,021 --> 00:33:21,522
I brought you up to this day,

725
00:33:21,605 --> 00:33:22,896
so you should pay me back

726
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,063
for everything I've done for you.

727
00:33:25,771 --> 00:33:27,146
You're wicked.

728
00:33:29,105 --> 00:33:30,980
Are you going to sell them off like me?

729
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,438
You know what?

730
00:33:32,896 --> 00:33:34,729
I'm going to report you for everything.

731
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:37,313
Don't you dare lay a hand on my siblings.

732
00:33:37,771 --> 00:33:39,105
I won't let you live.

733
00:33:39,188 --> 00:33:40,896
You cheeky brat.

734
00:33:41,729 --> 00:33:42,688
How dare you?

735
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:44,729
How dare you say that?

736
00:33:45,021 --> 00:33:46,646
How dare you yell at me like that?

737
00:33:47,272 --> 00:33:48,938
This is why your new parents

738
00:33:49,021 --> 00:33:50,230
got rid of you!

739
00:33:51,397 --> 00:33:52,980
I kept my siblings safe.

740
00:33:53,771 --> 00:33:54,855
That's enough.

741
00:33:55,313 --> 00:33:56,729
"I don't care about that apartment."

742
00:33:56,813 --> 00:33:58,105
"I kept my siblings safe. That's enough."

743
00:34:02,813 --> 00:34:03,896
You were here.

744
00:34:04,272 --> 00:34:05,813
I was worried you'd be out.

745
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,646
What brings you here, Seo Jin?

746
00:34:09,063 --> 00:34:10,855
I heard you started working.

747
00:34:10,938 --> 00:34:12,063
I'm a bit too late visiting you.

748
00:34:13,896 --> 00:34:16,105
A CEO of a furniture company.

749
00:34:20,188 --> 00:34:21,063
That's wonderful.

750
00:34:22,105 --> 00:34:24,105
I got you some delicious egg tarts.

751
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,480
Thank you.

752
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,729
Let's have it together with coffee.

753
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,771
"Jakomo"

754
00:35:04,938 --> 00:35:06,021
An apple necklace.

755
00:35:07,938 --> 00:35:09,021
This seems familiar.

756
00:35:11,646 --> 00:35:12,646
Where did I see this?

757
00:35:12,771 --> 00:35:13,688
What are you doing?

758
00:35:16,397 --> 00:35:17,688
I was looking at your paintings.

759
00:35:17,771 --> 00:35:18,771
Is this yours?

760
00:35:18,855 --> 00:35:20,397
I haven't finished it yet.

761
00:35:22,438 --> 00:35:24,105
I'm a bit shy to let others see it.

762
00:35:25,522 --> 00:35:26,438
Why?

763
00:35:26,688 --> 00:35:28,646
You seem to use unique colours.

764
00:35:29,313 --> 00:35:30,688
The coffee is getting cold.

765
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,188
Come on.

766
00:35:40,021 --> 00:35:41,230
"Bosong Village Building 3"

767
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,522
"Jakomo"

768
00:36:27,855 --> 00:36:29,522
Follow her, and don't lose her.

769
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,146
Yes, Ms Cheon.

770
00:36:42,313 --> 00:36:43,355
"Nambu Detention Centre"

771
00:36:45,146 --> 00:36:47,605
"Nambu Detention Centre"

772
00:37:00,105 --> 00:37:01,771
Why is she at a detention centre?

773
00:37:03,855 --> 00:37:05,855
Find out who she's here to see.

774
00:37:06,646 --> 00:37:07,646
Yes, Ms Cheon.

775
00:37:11,564 --> 00:37:12,896
"Public Service Division"

776
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:22,063
"Visitor's Application"

777
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,646
"Inmate Name: Min Hyung Sik"

778
00:37:27,397 --> 00:37:28,355
Min Hyung Sik?

779
00:37:28,771 --> 00:37:29,646
Who is that?

780
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:32,063
Min Seol A is from Somang Children's Home,

781
00:37:32,146 --> 00:37:33,564
which Min Hyung Sik operated.

782
00:37:35,522 --> 00:37:36,855
Wait, so Sim Soo Ryeon is here

783
00:37:37,397 --> 00:37:38,564
to see the director

784
00:37:38,646 --> 00:37:40,188
of Min Seol A's orphanage?

785
00:37:40,688 --> 00:37:41,646
You're correct.

786
00:37:44,146 --> 00:37:45,272
Min Seol A.

787
00:37:45,938 --> 00:37:47,438
Sim Soo Ryeon.

788
00:37:48,272 --> 00:37:49,771
Min Seol A.

789
00:37:50,938 --> 00:37:52,896
I bought this apple pendant there.

790
00:37:53,397 --> 00:37:54,355
Do you remember it?

791
00:37:59,729 --> 00:38:00,646
Min Seol A.

792
00:38:02,146 --> 00:38:04,105
That was Min Seol A's necklace.

793
00:38:06,938 --> 00:38:08,063
Sim Soo Ryeon has

794
00:38:08,855 --> 00:38:10,980
some kind of a connection with Min Seol A.

795
00:38:11,272 --> 00:38:12,188
I'm sure.

796
00:38:12,771 --> 00:38:14,355
My hunch wasn't wrong.

797
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:17,313
Help! Help me!

798
00:38:17,605 --> 00:38:19,105
Anybody there?

799
00:38:24,564 --> 00:38:26,021
You're so loud!

800
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:28,564
I heard you studied vocal music.

801
00:38:29,063 --> 00:38:31,438
No wonder you have such a loud voice.

802
00:38:32,646 --> 00:38:33,771
Attorney Lee?

803
00:38:34,522 --> 00:38:35,646
You did this?

804
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,313
What do you think you're doing?

805
00:38:38,688 --> 00:38:39,771
That lot in Myeong-dong.

806
00:38:40,313 --> 00:38:41,729
Sell it to us.

807
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,313
Chairman Joo Dan Tae is furious now.

808
00:38:45,688 --> 00:38:47,146
You crushed his pride so badly

809
00:38:47,313 --> 00:38:49,646
that he's refusing to pay you the premium.

810
00:38:50,021 --> 00:38:51,605
Is this how you folks always do things?

811
00:38:52,729 --> 00:38:54,313
This is a crime!

812
00:38:54,605 --> 00:38:57,272
Untie me now. Now!

813
00:38:57,564 --> 00:38:58,688
Yes, I know.

814
00:38:59,522 --> 00:39:00,855
I'm an attorney, you know.

815
00:39:01,063 --> 00:39:02,646
I'm not a jerk.

816
00:39:02,729 --> 00:39:04,564
I'm a true gentleman.

817
00:39:12,522 --> 00:39:13,605
You can't make me

818
00:39:14,313 --> 00:39:15,938
sell that property by doing this!

819
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,188
Let's...

820
00:39:17,729 --> 00:39:19,855
choose the easy way.

821
00:39:20,355 --> 00:39:21,313
I mean,

822
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,688
aren't you worried about your daughter

823
00:39:24,146 --> 00:39:25,646
who's waiting for you at home?

824
00:39:30,146 --> 00:39:31,397
If you hurt Ro Na,

825
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:35,855
I will kill you. - Hey.

826
00:39:36,522 --> 00:39:37,938
I can be a very scary man

827
00:39:39,438 --> 00:39:41,105
if I want to be.

828
00:39:49,355 --> 00:39:50,855
Don't come near me!

829
00:39:51,438 --> 00:39:52,938
Get off me. - Stamp the document.

830
00:39:53,021 --> 00:39:53,938
No!

831
00:39:54,021 --> 00:39:55,105
Come on.

832
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:00,230
Hey, hold her down!

833
00:40:00,313 --> 00:40:02,146
No! Let go! - Stamp the document.

834
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:03,688
Do it! - No!

835
00:40:10,397 --> 00:40:13,272
Stop that driver, you idiots! Get him!

836
00:40:16,646 --> 00:40:18,480
You morons! I told you to stop him!

837
00:40:18,771 --> 00:40:20,480
Get him. - Move it!

838
00:40:22,771 --> 00:40:24,522
Hey! Get him out of there.

839
00:40:25,021 --> 00:40:26,063
Who is that punk?

840
00:40:26,355 --> 00:40:28,063
Get him! Geez!

841
00:40:28,438 --> 00:40:30,813
You punks! What are you doing?

842
00:40:31,105 --> 00:40:33,063
Get him! Darn it.

843
00:40:34,813 --> 00:40:36,188
What the heck are you doing?

844
00:40:38,522 --> 00:40:40,397
Hey! What the...

845
00:40:41,646 --> 00:40:44,355
You idiots! Why can't you fight?

846
00:40:44,896 --> 00:40:47,230
Get him! Catch him, you punks.

847
00:40:47,313 --> 00:40:49,063
You'd better stamp that document! Now!

848
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:50,355
Hey, get up.

849
00:40:55,646 --> 00:40:57,146
Come here. - Get away from me!

850
00:40:57,855 --> 00:40:59,188
Gosh! - Stamp that document!

851
00:40:59,272 --> 00:41:00,646
No, get away from me!

852
00:41:00,688 --> 00:41:02,063
Come here! - You punk!

853
00:41:03,646 --> 00:41:05,605
Let go! - Just stamp this!

854
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:08,230
Come on! - I said, no!

855
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:15,646
What the heck is this?

856
00:41:25,397 --> 00:41:27,272
Yoon Chul! - You piece of...

857
00:41:27,813 --> 00:41:29,188
Yoon Hee, run. Hey!

858
00:41:30,146 --> 00:41:31,397
How dare you.

859
00:41:33,688 --> 00:41:35,771
My mum made me learn taekwondo and judo

860
00:41:35,855 --> 00:41:37,438
when I was little.

861
00:41:37,522 --> 00:41:40,063
You scumbag. - I can fight pretty well.

862
00:41:40,646 --> 00:41:42,564
Darn it. You jerk!

863
00:41:47,397 --> 00:41:48,813
We've got to run. Come on!

864
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:06,605
You idiot!

865
00:42:06,938 --> 00:42:10,063
Our 30 billion won is on the line!

866
00:42:11,272 --> 00:42:12,480
Get in the car.

867
00:42:19,438 --> 00:42:20,688
Hey! - Hey, stop!

868
00:42:35,813 --> 00:42:36,813
Are you all right?

869
00:42:37,272 --> 00:42:38,646
Nothing happened, right?

870
00:42:48,146 --> 00:42:49,355
Hey, Yoon Chul.

871
00:42:58,313 --> 00:42:59,480
You stay inside.

872
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:03,813
Be careful.

873
00:43:23,896 --> 00:43:25,188
What's going on, Dr. Ha?

874
00:43:25,272 --> 00:43:27,105
This time, you crossed the line.

875
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:29,021
I didn't agree to this.

876
00:43:32,313 --> 00:43:33,771
You keep acting up like this,

877
00:43:33,855 --> 00:43:35,230
and my patience has reached its limit!

878
00:43:35,605 --> 00:43:36,605
You piece of...

879
00:43:36,646 --> 00:43:37,896
Can you really give up your money?

880
00:43:38,397 --> 00:43:39,980
You can't even do that.

881
00:43:40,063 --> 00:43:41,230
So why act all tough

882
00:43:41,313 --> 00:43:42,313
in front of your first love?

883
00:43:42,938 --> 00:43:44,188
You're so greedy for money,

884
00:43:44,272 --> 00:43:46,188
yet you put up a kind, caring facade.

885
00:43:46,646 --> 00:43:48,480
I loathe hypocrites like you.

886
00:43:50,438 --> 00:43:51,646
Come here.

887
00:43:52,063 --> 00:43:53,105
That lot in Myeong-dong.

888
00:43:53,688 --> 00:43:54,938
Sell it to us.

889
00:43:55,855 --> 00:43:58,729
Chairman Joo Dan Tae is furious now.

890
00:43:58,896 --> 00:44:00,438
You crushed his pride so badly

891
00:44:00,646 --> 00:44:02,855
that he's refusing to pay you the premium.

892
00:44:02,938 --> 00:44:03,980
Goodness.

893
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:09,896
Did you think

894
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:12,146
I wouldn't be prepared for any of this

895
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:13,813
when I'm dealing with someone like you?

896
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,146
Kidnapping, confinement, and assault.

897
00:44:21,438 --> 00:44:23,355
You're guilty of all three.

898
00:44:25,105 --> 00:44:26,230
If I send this recording

899
00:44:26,688 --> 00:44:28,480
to the police and the media,

900
00:44:28,771 --> 00:44:30,313
it'll cause more than

901
00:44:30,438 --> 00:44:32,230
just a small glitch in your life.

902
00:44:32,855 --> 00:44:34,063
Are you okay with that?

903
00:44:39,938 --> 00:44:40,980
What do you want?

904
00:44:41,188 --> 00:44:42,146
From now on,

905
00:44:44,605 --> 00:44:46,188
I'll only deal with Yoon Chul.

906
00:44:47,105 --> 00:44:48,646
If you wish to negotiate,

907
00:44:49,646 --> 00:44:51,146
you can talk to me through Yoon Chul.

908
00:44:53,605 --> 00:44:55,438
Come on. Let's go.

909
00:45:08,272 --> 00:45:09,188
Hey!

910
00:45:10,646 --> 00:45:11,771
Move your car!

911
00:45:27,397 --> 00:45:28,397
Darn it!

912
00:45:40,063 --> 00:45:40,980
Go! - Eun Hoo.

913
00:45:41,063 --> 00:45:42,688
How can you sing with such bad hearing?

914
00:45:42,771 --> 00:45:44,063
I'm here. Over here.

915
00:45:44,146 --> 00:45:45,522
Throw a big hook. - Go for it!

916
00:45:46,063 --> 00:45:48,105
How dare you gossip about me.

917
00:45:48,188 --> 00:45:49,313
Who do you think you are?

918
00:45:54,938 --> 00:45:56,729
Sorry. I'm sorry.

919
00:45:57,813 --> 00:45:59,063
I won't do that again.

920
00:45:59,646 --> 00:46:00,896
Forgive me just this once.

921
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:03,272
I... I was foolish.

922
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:15,230
I guess you think we're friends

923
00:46:15,313 --> 00:46:16,855
because I put up with you a few times.

924
00:46:18,105 --> 00:46:19,230
I don't forgive anyone

925
00:46:19,313 --> 00:46:20,397
who messes with what's mine.

926
00:46:21,896 --> 00:46:22,938
Do you understand?

927
00:46:25,564 --> 00:46:26,896
Hey! - Bye, loser.

928
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:29,438
Hey! What are you guys doing here?

929
00:46:30,313 --> 00:46:31,397
Don't you know

930
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:33,355
that you need permission to use the gym?

931
00:46:35,063 --> 00:46:35,938
Eun Hoo?

932
00:46:36,355 --> 00:46:37,771
What's wrong? Are you hurt?

933
00:46:40,813 --> 00:46:42,480
He got too immersed in the boxing match.

934
00:46:45,397 --> 00:46:46,813
Hey, I told you to take it easy.

935
00:46:47,063 --> 00:46:48,188
Seriously, man.

936
00:46:48,272 --> 00:46:50,438
You're too competitive for your own good.

937
00:46:50,522 --> 00:46:51,522
Let's go.

938
00:47:04,313 --> 00:47:05,313
Hey.

939
00:47:05,813 --> 00:47:06,855
Who did this?

940
00:47:07,564 --> 00:47:09,105
Who hit you? Tell me.

941
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:11,146
Joo Seok Hoon?

942
00:47:11,438 --> 00:47:12,771
They're bullying you, aren't they?

943
00:47:13,605 --> 00:47:14,522
No, they're not.

944
00:47:14,605 --> 00:47:16,397
Come on. Just tell me.

945
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:18,855
Look. Will you keep playing dumb?

946
00:47:19,855 --> 00:47:21,729
My goodness.

947
00:47:21,813 --> 00:47:23,813
You should go to the infirmary first.

948
00:47:23,896 --> 00:47:25,272
I'll take care of-- - I said it's nothing!

949
00:47:25,355 --> 00:47:26,438
Why won't you believe me?

950
00:47:26,522 --> 00:47:27,605
Gosh, you startled me.

951
00:47:28,021 --> 00:47:29,605
They're all my friends.

952
00:47:30,688 --> 00:47:32,188
And we were just playing around.

953
00:47:34,105 --> 00:47:35,480
Please mind your own business.

954
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,938
Goodness, that temper of his.

955
00:47:42,188 --> 00:47:43,438
I'm afraid I can't do that.

956
00:47:44,272 --> 00:47:45,397
I'm a teacher

957
00:47:45,688 --> 00:47:47,355
at Cheonga Arts High School.

958
00:47:51,896 --> 00:47:52,896
Where have you been?

959
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:54,105
Why didn't you answer your phone?

960
00:47:54,313 --> 00:47:55,438
What is this about?

961
00:47:55,646 --> 00:47:57,021
There are many eyes here.

962
00:47:58,438 --> 00:47:59,688
I couldn't wait.

963
00:48:00,063 --> 00:48:00,980
My hunch was right.

964
00:48:01,063 --> 00:48:01,938
Your wife

965
00:48:02,105 --> 00:48:03,438
has something to do with Min Seol A.

966
00:48:03,522 --> 00:48:05,230
What on earth are you talking about?

967
00:48:05,313 --> 00:48:07,605
Do you know who she met today?

968
00:48:07,729 --> 00:48:08,813
The director of the children's home

969
00:48:08,896 --> 00:48:10,146
where Min Seol A grew up.

970
00:48:10,813 --> 00:48:12,021
He's at a detention centre.

971
00:48:13,313 --> 00:48:14,397
Detention centre?

972
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,688
Director Min Hyung Sik.

973
00:48:17,105 --> 00:48:18,480
Turns out he used to be

974
00:48:18,564 --> 00:48:19,813
Cho Sang Heon's right-hand man.

975
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:21,646
Why do you think she went to see

976
00:48:21,688 --> 00:48:22,729
a criminal who even sold kids

977
00:48:22,813 --> 00:48:24,146
for bone marrow transplants?

978
00:48:24,855 --> 00:48:25,938
I'm sure

979
00:48:26,063 --> 00:48:27,646
she's connected to Min Seol A somehow.

980
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,564
She may have witnessed her death or...

981
00:48:30,771 --> 00:48:31,688
Or what?

982
00:48:34,438 --> 00:48:36,522
Maybe she knew her from before.

983
00:48:37,605 --> 00:48:38,771
That is nonsense.

984
00:48:39,188 --> 00:48:41,230
How could she have known her?

985
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:43,438
Min Seol A

986
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:46,021
was an orphan.

987
00:48:47,021 --> 00:48:48,646
Maybe your wife

988
00:48:50,313 --> 00:48:52,438
knows Min Seol A's biological parents.

989
00:48:54,438 --> 00:48:56,105
Don't you think that's too far-fetched?

990
00:48:56,188 --> 00:48:57,813
If we have even the slightest doubt,

991
00:48:57,896 --> 00:48:59,188
we should check.

992
00:49:00,146 --> 00:49:01,355
Your wife

993
00:49:02,188 --> 00:49:03,272
knows something.

994
00:49:04,771 --> 00:49:05,855
Mark my words.

995
00:49:05,938 --> 00:49:07,646
We cannot ignore this.

996
00:49:13,522 --> 00:49:14,522
It seemed like

997
00:49:14,605 --> 00:49:16,646
someone was blackmailing her.

998
00:49:17,188 --> 00:49:18,272
She's being blackmailed?

999
00:49:19,063 --> 00:49:20,896
Right, it must be him.

1000
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:22,063
Director Min Hyung Sik.

1001
00:49:22,188 --> 00:49:23,480
But why would he blackmail her?

1002
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:26,980
He may know...

1003
00:49:29,355 --> 00:49:32,605
your wife's secrets.

1004
00:49:34,313 --> 00:49:36,272
That man who's locked up right now.

1005
00:49:45,688 --> 00:49:47,646
Hello? Why do you keep calling?

1006
00:49:47,688 --> 00:49:49,105
I told you to stop.

1007
00:49:51,105 --> 00:49:52,355
Who's that?

1008
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:00,230
Who are you?

1009
00:50:00,813 --> 00:50:02,272
I asked you who you are!

1010
00:50:05,313 --> 00:50:06,896
"No Caller ID"

1011
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:12,021
What are you up to behind my back?

1012
00:50:12,355 --> 00:50:13,397
Who was that?

1013
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:14,564
Director Min Hyung Sik?

1014
00:50:15,896 --> 00:50:17,188
How do you know about him?

1015
00:50:17,272 --> 00:50:19,021
Why is he blackmailing you?

1016
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:21,188
I'm asking you what this is about!

1017
00:50:21,729 --> 00:50:22,938
It's not about me.

1018
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:26,605
He's trying to blackmail you, honey.

1019
00:50:27,438 --> 00:50:28,564
What?

1020
00:50:31,729 --> 00:50:33,105
I received this note.

1021
00:50:35,522 --> 00:50:38,564
"Your husband killed Min Seol A!"

1022
00:50:42,313 --> 00:50:44,522
"Min Seol A was murdered at Hera Palace!"

1023
00:50:44,605 --> 00:50:45,813
"Get me out, or I'll expose everything!"

1024
00:50:46,896 --> 00:50:48,397
Tell me the truth.

1025
00:50:49,313 --> 00:50:51,230
Did you kill Min Seol A?

1026
00:50:51,688 --> 00:50:53,397
He's saying he has solid evidence.

1027
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,105
On what grounds is he doing this?

1028
00:50:55,272 --> 00:50:56,397
This is utter nonsense.

1029
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:57,688
Why would I kill that girl?

1030
00:51:00,896 --> 00:51:01,980
I met Director Min Hyung Sik

1031
00:51:02,272 --> 00:51:03,688
at the detention centre earlier today.

1032
00:51:05,105 --> 00:51:06,688
He said she died at Hera Palace,

1033
00:51:06,771 --> 00:51:07,980
not in Bosong Village.

1034
00:51:08,063 --> 00:51:09,397
What does that mean?

1035
00:51:11,313 --> 00:51:13,438
And you've been acting a little strange

1036
00:51:13,522 --> 00:51:14,896
since the lighting ceremony.

1037
00:51:16,896 --> 00:51:18,021
Tell me, please.

1038
00:51:18,313 --> 00:51:20,188
I need to know the truth to help you.

1039
00:51:21,021 --> 00:51:22,105
Did you

1040
00:51:22,729 --> 00:51:23,980
kill her

1041
00:51:24,063 --> 00:51:25,438
to cover up what our kids did?

1042
00:51:25,522 --> 00:51:26,605
No.

1043
00:51:26,938 --> 00:51:27,980
That is not true.

1044
00:51:28,397 --> 00:51:29,480
You're sure, right?

1045
00:51:29,646 --> 00:51:30,771
Then you have nothing to do

1046
00:51:30,855 --> 00:51:32,230
with her death, right?

1047
00:51:36,522 --> 00:51:37,855
I'm scared.

1048
00:51:38,397 --> 00:51:39,938
I was so terrified.

1049
00:51:42,188 --> 00:51:43,230
Don't worry.

1050
00:51:43,522 --> 00:51:44,605
I'm here for you.

1051
00:51:45,438 --> 00:51:47,021
He's just trying to extort money from us.

1052
00:51:49,855 --> 00:51:50,980
I trust you, honey.

1053
00:51:52,522 --> 00:51:53,522
All right.

1054
00:51:55,397 --> 00:51:56,480
You should go to bed.

1055
00:51:57,063 --> 00:51:58,230
I have to step out.

"Grand Hill Golf Club"

Director Min owns this driving range.

1058
00:52:15,105 --> 00:52:16,438
The business has been suspended.

1059
00:52:17,021 --> 00:52:17,938
Cut the chain.

Don't miss a thing.

1063

Mr Cho, come over here.

That punk...

1065
00:53:08,896 --> 00:53:11,813
How dare a criminal try to blackmail me.

1066
00:53:13,646 --> 00:53:14,646
What would you like me to do?

1067
00:53:15,813 --> 00:53:16,729
Take care of it quietly.

1068
00:53:17,188 --> 00:53:18,230
All of it.

"I know what you did with Joo Dan Tae"

1072
00:53:46,646 --> 00:53:49,729
So? Did you think about it?

1073
00:53:49,938 --> 00:53:52,063
I'm trying to find a good lawyer,

1074
00:53:52,855 --> 00:53:54,105
so please give me some time.

1075
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:57,105
I knew you'd understand.

1076
00:53:57,605 --> 00:53:59,063
I know it's too late to say this,

1077
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:01,980
but I really cared for Seol A.

1078
00:54:02,313 --> 00:54:05,397
You should know that.

1079
00:54:06,646 --> 00:54:08,646
I know very well, of course.

1080
00:54:10,729 --> 00:54:11,771
I will never forget

1081
00:54:12,564 --> 00:54:14,146
to repay you.

1082
00:54:37,146 --> 00:54:38,063

Hello?

1086
00:54:52,438 --> 00:54:53,522
Why do you keep calling?

1087
00:54:53,605 --> 00:54:54,813
I told you to stop.

1088
00:54:55,688 --> 00:54:56,729
Who's that?

1089

Who are you?

1090
00:55:02,063 --> 00:55:03,564
I asked you who you are!

1091
00:55:13,021 --> 00:55:14,105
I killed Director Papa

1092
00:55:14,188 --> 00:55:15,480
every night in my dreams.

1093
00:55:16,729 --> 00:55:18,688
Had I never met him,

1094
00:55:20,313 --> 00:55:22,438
would I have been happier?

Wait.

1106
00:56:10,063 --> 00:56:11,646
It wasn't an apple pendant?

1107
00:56:15,605 --> 00:56:16,938
Was I mistaken?

1108
00:56:30,397 --> 00:56:31,313
Here.

1109
00:56:41,196 --> 00:56:42,321
Why do you think Eun Byeol practically

1110
00:56:42,405 --> 00:56:43,738
rented the entire concert hall?

1111
00:56:44,446 --> 00:56:46,280
I'm telling you because I feel guilty.

1112
00:56:46,822 --> 00:56:48,530
So Eun Byeol did it on purpose?

1113
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:49,780
What's wrong?

1114
00:56:50,113 --> 00:56:51,113
What's going on?

1115
00:56:53,238 --> 00:56:55,238
That girl bought all the tickets

1116
00:56:55,488 --> 00:56:57,572
so I couldn't do my assignment.

1117
00:56:57,905 --> 00:56:59,113
Mum, I got a zero

1118
00:56:59,238 --> 00:57:00,738
on the assignment because of her.

1119
00:57:01,363 --> 00:57:02,405
If I don't get the highest mark

1120
00:57:02,488 --> 00:57:03,405
in the midterm,

1121
00:57:03,488 --> 00:57:05,321
my grades will get all messed up.

1122
00:57:08,263 --> 00:57:09,221
Get up.

1123
00:57:09,305 --> 00:57:10,472
Let's go sort this out.

1124
00:57:10,722 --> 00:57:12,722
We'll go together and confront her.

1125
00:57:12,805 --> 00:57:13,929
No.

1126
00:57:14,346 --> 00:57:15,430
If I do that, Seok Kyung

1127
00:57:15,513 --> 00:57:16,346
will get in trouble.

1128
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,305
She's the only friend I have.

1129
00:57:20,055 --> 00:57:21,430
How dare she...

1130
00:57:33,263 --> 00:57:35,555
Gosh, stop being such a crybaby.

1131
00:57:36,305 --> 00:57:37,388
You haven't changed one bit.

1132
00:57:37,472 --> 00:57:38,846
You still can't fight.

1133
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:40,764
Hey, it's not that I can't fight.

1134
00:57:43,929 --> 00:57:45,638
Stop messing with Joo Dan Tae.

1135
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:48,305
You don't know what he's capable of.

1136
00:57:48,388 --> 00:57:50,346
I'm not afraid of him at all.

1137
00:57:50,846 --> 00:57:53,221
Gosh, he's just an obnoxious jerk.

1138
00:57:54,555 --> 00:57:56,971
Hey, how deeply are you involved

1139
00:57:57,055 --> 00:57:58,722
with Joo Dan Tae?

1140
00:57:58,929 --> 00:58:00,472
What the heck are you doing

1141
00:58:00,555 --> 00:58:01,555
with that lunatic?

1142
00:58:02,430 --> 00:58:03,638
Cut all ties with him,

1143
00:58:03,722 --> 00:58:04,846
or you'll regret not doing so.

1144
00:58:05,971 --> 00:58:06,971
Okay?

1145
00:58:07,846 --> 00:58:09,263
Do you understand?

1146
00:58:13,638 --> 00:58:16,013
This reminds me of our high school days.

1147
00:58:16,555 --> 00:58:17,805
You haven't changed one bit.

1148
00:58:19,388 --> 00:58:20,555
How could you smile

1149
00:58:20,722 --> 00:58:21,846
with that face right now?

1150
00:58:22,722 --> 00:58:23,846
Gosh.

1151
00:58:24,138 --> 00:58:25,680
Let me put more ointment on it.

1152
00:58:39,138 --> 00:58:41,263
This scar hasn't faded away.

1153
00:58:44,971 --> 00:58:46,346
What are you doing?

1154
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:52,680
You have no right

1155
00:58:54,846 --> 00:58:56,430
to even bring up this scar.

1156
00:59:14,263 --> 00:59:15,263
What happened to you?

1157
00:59:15,888 --> 00:59:16,846
Did you get into a fight?

1158
00:59:16,929 --> 00:59:17,888
No, it's nothing.

1159
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:19,096
I just bumped into something.

1160
00:59:19,513 --> 00:59:21,305
What on earth are you up to these days?

1161
00:59:23,846 --> 00:59:24,971
Answer me!

1162
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:27,971
Since when were you so interested in me?

1163
00:59:28,638 --> 00:59:30,305
Just be your usual self.

1164
00:59:33,096 --> 00:59:34,096
Move.

1165
00:59:36,513 --> 00:59:38,221
Do you think I don't know?

1166
00:59:40,472 --> 00:59:42,305
I know that you met up with Yoon Hee.

1167
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:44,764
I know everything.

1168
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:47,764
Since you brought that up,

1169
00:59:47,846 --> 00:59:48,764
let me ask you too.

1170
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:51,180
Do you even respect me as your husband?

1171
00:59:51,388 --> 00:59:52,929
Why do you even live with me?

1172
00:59:53,597 --> 00:59:55,263
What? - You see,

1173
00:59:55,971 --> 00:59:57,263
you never loved me.

1174
00:59:57,764 --> 00:59:59,346
I just happened to be dating the girl

1175
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:01,055
you could never beat,

1176
01:00:01,388 --> 01:00:02,388
so you wanted to steal me from her.

1177
01:00:02,472 --> 01:00:03,346
Am I wrong?

1178
01:00:03,430 --> 01:00:04,263
Why?

1179
01:00:04,513 --> 01:00:05,888
Does Yoon Hee want to get back together?

1180
01:00:05,971 --> 01:00:07,263
Did she ask you to get a divorce?

1181
01:00:07,513 --> 01:00:08,680
Does she think she has the right now

1182
01:00:08,764 --> 01:00:10,096
because you gave her 100 million won?

1183
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:11,846
Stop bringing that up!

1184
01:00:18,764 --> 01:00:21,929
You slashed Yoon Hee's neck

1185
01:00:22,555 --> 01:00:23,846
and ruined everything for that girl

1186
01:00:23,888 --> 01:00:25,180
who had such a bright future.

1187
01:00:25,263 --> 01:00:26,597
Compared to that,

1188
01:00:28,013 --> 01:00:28,929
100 million won

1189
01:00:29,430 --> 01:00:30,722
is nothing, don't you think?

1190
01:00:32,846 --> 01:00:33,971
Do you...

1191
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:37,555
really think I did that to her?

1192
01:00:38,472 --> 01:00:40,597
You think I slashed Oh Yoon Hee's neck?

1193
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:43,846
I'm sure you know the truth.

1194
01:00:46,722 --> 01:00:47,929
Ha Yoon Chul!

1195
01:00:49,055 --> 01:00:51,013
How dare you run away like a coward!

1196
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:32,346
Cheers! - Cheers!

1197
01:01:35,846 --> 01:01:36,929
This is so nice.

1198
01:01:40,472 --> 01:01:41,555
Oh, right.

1199
01:01:42,472 --> 01:01:44,096
Without this watch you gave me,

1200
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:46,138
I would've gone down without a fight.

1201
01:01:46,929 --> 01:01:48,305
Gosh, I never imagined

1202
01:01:48,388 --> 01:01:50,221
they'd do something like that.

1203
01:01:51,346 --> 01:01:53,764
Your husband is really terrifying.

1204
01:01:54,638 --> 01:01:55,597
How can you share a bed

1205
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:56,846
with a man like that?

1206
01:01:58,513 --> 01:01:59,722
I wonder too.

1207
01:02:00,305 --> 01:02:02,096
I guess I'm just as spiteful as he is.

1208
01:02:05,305 --> 01:02:06,513
As for the property,

1209
01:02:06,764 --> 01:02:08,638
we should try to maximise profit

1210
01:02:08,722 --> 01:02:10,305
but sell it as soon as possible.

1211
01:02:10,971 --> 01:02:12,013
If we drag it on for too long,

1212
01:02:12,096 --> 01:02:13,971
you may be put in danger again.

1213
01:02:16,055 --> 01:02:18,680
I said I'll only negotiate with Yoon Chul,

1214
01:02:18,764 --> 01:02:20,555
so I'll hear from him soon.

1215
01:02:22,346 --> 01:02:25,055
I tried to sound all tough and confident,

1216
01:02:26,305 --> 01:02:29,013
but I'm not sure what I should ask for.

1217
01:02:30,221 --> 01:02:31,597
I have something in mind.

1218
01:02:34,846 --> 01:02:36,013
It's a condition

1219
01:02:36,388 --> 01:02:37,555
that both you and I

1220
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:39,597
absolutely need.

1221
01:02:50,346 --> 01:02:51,513
Tell us the truth.

1222
01:02:53,096 --> 01:02:54,513
Are they bullying you?

1223
01:02:55,013 --> 01:02:56,346
I already said they're not.

1224
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:00,846
We were just boxing. That's all.

1225
01:03:04,263 --> 01:03:05,430
You can go.

1226
01:03:11,513 --> 01:03:14,096
I'm telling you. He's lying.

1227
01:03:15,013 --> 01:03:16,263
We must notify the Anti-bullying Committee

1228
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:17,888
and get to the bottom of this.

1229
01:03:18,138 --> 01:03:19,430
Get to the bottom of what?

1230
01:03:19,513 --> 01:03:20,846
There is no victim.

1231
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:22,221
Mr. Gu，

1232
01:03:22,388 --> 01:03:23,846
don't you think you're overreacting?

1233
01:03:24,346 --> 01:03:25,846
Why do you keep making things worse?

1234
01:03:26,929 --> 01:03:27,888
How could you say that

1235
01:03:27,971 --> 01:03:28,888
after seeing his face?

1236
01:03:29,929 --> 01:03:33,180
Five students attacked that poor kid.

1237
01:03:34,805 --> 01:03:36,638
I'm going to meet

1238
01:03:36,722 --> 01:03:38,180
with those students' parents first.

1239
01:03:39,388 --> 01:03:40,472
Mr. Gu.

1240
01:03:40,971 --> 01:03:42,096
I'm warning you.

1241
01:03:42,555 --> 01:03:43,846
Why must you make

1242
01:03:43,888 --> 01:03:44,764
such a big deal out of it?

1243
01:03:44,846 --> 01:03:45,846
Then should I have reported it

1244
01:03:45,888 --> 01:03:47,138
to the district school board right away?

1245
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:54,805
What I meant was,

1246
01:03:55,388 --> 01:03:58,430
I'm trying to get this sorted out

1247
01:03:58,513 --> 01:03:59,846
as quietly as possible.

1248
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:02,263
Ms Cheon,

1249
01:04:02,346 --> 01:04:03,764
you'll have to discuss this with me

1250
01:04:03,846 --> 01:04:05,472
as Eun Byeol's parent.

1251
01:04:06,513 --> 01:04:08,305
Anyway, I'm off.

1252
01:04:14,888 --> 01:04:16,805
He's like a ticking bomb

1253
01:04:16,846 --> 01:04:18,221
waiting to go off.

1254
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,846
He'll cause big trouble sooner or later.

1255
01:04:22,555 --> 01:04:24,680
Let's come up with an excuse to fire him.

1256
01:04:24,888 --> 01:04:26,055
We hired him because

1257
01:04:26,138 --> 01:04:27,555
my father's friend recommended him.

1258
01:04:28,221 --> 01:04:29,263
Let's just wait and see.

1259
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,221
He's on a contract anyway.

1260
01:04:40,555 --> 01:04:42,805
My gosh, hello.

1261
01:04:43,388 --> 01:04:45,430
I'm Gu Ho Dong, the assistant HR teacher

1262
01:04:45,555 --> 01:04:46,971
in the music department.

1263
01:04:47,555 --> 01:04:49,138
Hello, it's nice to meet you.

1264
01:04:49,221 --> 01:04:50,388
Likewise.

1265
01:04:50,888 --> 01:04:52,263
What brings you here?

1266
01:04:52,346 --> 01:04:53,846
I came to discuss something

1267
01:04:53,929 --> 01:04:56,388
regarding Seok Hoon and Seok Kyung.

1268
01:04:57,138 --> 01:04:58,472
My gosh.

1269
01:04:58,555 --> 01:05:01,096
You have such a nice place.

1270
01:05:02,430 --> 01:05:04,513
This is the penthouse, right?

1271
01:05:06,013 --> 01:05:07,430
My, I've never been

1272
01:05:07,513 --> 01:05:09,346
inside a place like this.

1273
01:05:10,305 --> 01:05:12,430
Oh, I heard the richest people

1274
01:05:12,555 --> 01:05:14,513
in the country live in Hera Palace.

1275
01:05:14,597 --> 01:05:15,638
Then...

1276
01:05:15,929 --> 01:05:17,555
how much does this place cost?

1277
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:21,888
My husband will be here shortly.

1278
01:05:22,055 --> 01:05:23,096
Please have some tea.

1279
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:25,597
Oh, sure. Thank you for the tea.

1280
01:05:28,472 --> 01:05:30,513
My gosh, this aroma

1281
01:05:30,597 --> 01:05:34,180
is as luxurious as this penthouse.

1282
01:05:42,346 --> 01:05:44,138
Oh, no! I'm so sorry.

1283
01:05:44,388 --> 01:05:45,929
I broke your expensive teacup.

1284
01:05:46,513 --> 01:05:47,971
I bet it's very expensive.

1285
01:05:48,638 --> 01:05:50,013
I'm really sorry.

1286
01:05:50,305 --> 01:05:51,388
It's okay.

1287
01:05:58,555 --> 01:05:59,846
Your eyes look just like

1288
01:06:00,846 --> 01:06:01,971
your daughter's.

1289
01:06:06,305 --> 01:06:08,888
I'm here to meet you, Ms Sim Soo Ryeon.

1290
01:06:14,638 --> 01:06:16,013
My goodness.

1291
01:06:16,096 --> 01:06:17,263
That's hilarious. - Ms Cheon.

1292
01:06:17,472 --> 01:06:18,638
Did you just get off work?

1293
01:06:19,013 --> 01:06:20,929
We just finished our yoga class.

1294
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:22,929
I was going to come by your place.

1295
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:25,846
Did you get a call from the school?

1296
01:06:26,180 --> 01:06:27,888
No, about what?

1297
01:06:28,305 --> 01:06:29,846
Did something else happen?

1298
01:06:30,888 --> 01:06:31,846
Our kids--

1299
01:06:31,888 --> 01:06:33,346
Excuse me. Please make way.

1300
01:06:34,263 --> 01:06:36,764
Oh, someone must be moving in next door.

1301
01:06:36,888 --> 01:06:39,096
That family moved to Australia.

1302
01:06:39,346 --> 01:06:41,013
You're headed to the 45th floor, right?

1303
01:06:41,096 --> 01:06:42,138
Yes.

1304
01:06:42,221 --> 01:06:43,263
Careful.

1305
01:06:43,346 --> 01:06:44,472
Isn't that furniture

1306
01:06:44,555 --> 01:06:45,929
from Soo Ryeon's company?

1307
01:06:46,221 --> 01:06:48,096
Oh, you're right.

1308
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:49,430
I haven't seen those designs before.

1309
01:06:49,513 --> 01:06:51,221
That's... - Are they the newest designs?

1310
01:06:51,638 --> 01:06:52,888
Your new next-door neighbour

1311
01:06:52,971 --> 01:06:54,180
must have good taste.

1312
01:06:55,096 --> 01:06:56,055
Thank goodness

1313
01:06:56,138 --> 01:06:58,096
it's someone who suits this place.

1314
01:07:00,346 --> 01:07:01,388
My gosh.

1315
01:07:01,472 --> 01:07:03,555
She's here. - Ms Cheon, the new resident.

1316
01:07:37,055 --> 01:07:39,096
You must be the new resident.

1317
01:07:39,513 --> 01:07:41,388
Nice to meet you. - Hello.

1318
01:07:41,472 --> 01:07:42,929
Welcome to Hera Palace.

1319
01:07:50,096 --> 01:07:51,263
Hello.

1320
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:52,764
I'm moving into the unit

1321
01:07:52,846 --> 01:07:53,722
on the 45th floor.

1322
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:57,888
Oh Yoon Hee?

1323
01:07:58,638 --> 01:08:01,263
I hope we get along, Seo Jin.

1324
01:08:27,346 --> 01:08:30,263
=Penthouse=

1325
01:08:30,346 --> 01:08:31,597
Is this really our place now?

1326
01:08:32,096 --> 01:08:33,138
Are we really going to live

1327
01:08:33,221 --> 01:08:34,263
in Hera Palace as of today?

1328
01:08:34,346 --> 01:08:35,888
Hello, you must be Seok Hoon's father.

1329
01:08:37,846 --> 01:08:39,597
Did you have a nightmare?

1330
01:08:39,764 --> 01:08:41,305
I will kick you out at all costs,

1331
01:08:41,388 --> 01:08:42,221
Oh Yoon Hee.

1332
01:08:42,430 --> 01:08:44,597
He's the most successful Korean-American.

1333
01:08:44,805 --> 01:08:46,221
His name is Logan Lee.

1334
01:08:46,305 --> 01:08:47,472
Your husband

1335
01:08:47,555 --> 01:08:49,888
seems to care a lot about Oh Yoon Hee.

1336
01:08:49,971 --> 01:08:51,055
I always wanted

1337
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:52,430
to take a look at your place.

1338
01:08:52,513 --> 01:08:54,346
Do your best to protect it all,

1339
01:08:54,929 --> 01:08:56,013
Seo Jin.
