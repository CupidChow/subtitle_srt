I do feel...

6
00:00:42,517 --> 00:00:43,642
=Episode 5=
a little bad for her.

7
00:00:44,018 --> 00:00:45,059
Had she stayed clueless,

8
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,267
she wouldn't have died.

9
00:00:46,892 --> 00:00:48,325
How dare she record a video of us

10
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:49,559
and use it to blackmail us?

11
00:00:50,892 --> 00:00:52,767
Let's forget about it and celebrate.

12
00:00:53,434 --> 00:00:54,747
Here's to our good luck.

13
00:01:51,703 --> 00:01:53,021
Is anybody out there?

14
00:02:31,225 --> 00:02:33,018
"Hera Palace"

15
00:02:37,684 --> 00:02:39,392
They hunted Seol A down

16
00:02:40,309 --> 00:02:42,100
to cover up their affair?

17
00:02:43,767 --> 00:02:45,559
Both of you will be cursed.

18
00:02:46,684 --> 00:02:48,475
You deserve to be ripped in pieces.

19
00:02:53,434 --> 00:02:54,309
It's all right.

20
00:02:54,726 --> 00:02:55,726
I guess I got a bit sensitive.

21
00:02:56,767 --> 00:02:59,100
I should probably call it a day.

22
00:02:59,183 --> 00:03:00,309
Don't worry.

23
00:03:00,684 --> 00:03:01,767
Min Seol A died,

24
00:03:01,934 --> 00:03:03,059
and her phone is gone.

25
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:04,600
Our secret

26
00:03:04,892 --> 00:03:05,809
will be buried for life.

27
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:07,976
I'm not in the mood to do this.

28
00:03:09,392 --> 00:03:11,100
Are you hiding something from me?

29
00:03:14,934 --> 00:03:15,892
What would I hide from you?

30
00:03:17,142 --> 00:03:18,225
I'm a little tired.

31
00:03:19,392 --> 00:03:20,600
I'll call you later.

32
00:04:00,183 --> 00:04:01,350
Why are you so surprised?

33
00:04:02,892 --> 00:04:03,809
Where have you been?

34
00:04:03,934 --> 00:04:04,851
It's pretty late.

35
00:04:05,059 --> 00:04:06,018
Oh.

36
00:04:06,434 --> 00:04:07,892
I had to give a lesson.

37
00:04:08,559 --> 00:04:09,851
I was in the lesson room.

38
00:04:10,767 --> 00:04:11,684
I see.

39
00:04:12,642 --> 00:04:13,559
Really?

40
00:04:14,142 --> 00:04:15,309
Take it easy.

41
00:04:16,142 --> 00:04:18,183
I got your favourite whisky as a present.

42
00:04:18,642 --> 00:04:19,600
Do you want a drink?

43
00:04:19,976 --> 00:04:20,976
I have something to say to you too.

44
00:04:22,392 --> 00:04:23,350
Like what?

45
00:04:25,976 --> 00:04:27,018
It's about that night,

46
00:04:28,267 --> 00:04:30,434
when Min Seol A died at Hera Palace...

47
00:04:32,225 --> 00:04:33,976
What are you trying to say?

48
00:04:34,267 --> 00:04:36,100
I don't want to think of that day.

49
00:04:36,267 --> 00:04:37,392
Did you forget what Chairman Joo said?

50
00:04:37,851 --> 00:04:40,225
Min Seol A never came to Hera Palace.

51
00:04:41,309 --> 00:04:42,517
So you need to stop saying

52
00:04:42,851 --> 00:04:44,100
such nonsense.

53
00:05:03,517 --> 00:05:04,976
Why is she lying?

54
00:06:05,144 --> 00:06:06,309
It can't be true.

55
00:06:09,976 --> 00:06:11,475
There's no way I killed her.

56
00:06:13,892 --> 00:06:14,809
No.

57
00:06:14,976 --> 00:06:15,851
It wasn't me.

58
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,642
It looked like you had a drink last night.

59
00:06:29,851 --> 00:06:30,892
Come and relieve your hangover.

60
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:32,976
I made your favourite, dried pollack soup.

61
00:06:40,392 --> 00:06:41,267
When did you come back?

62
00:06:41,475 --> 00:06:42,350
This morning.

63
00:06:42,434 --> 00:06:43,809
Did you not hear me in the shower?

64
00:06:44,851 --> 00:06:45,809
The kids are gone

65
00:06:45,892 --> 00:06:47,018
and you let the maid take a leave,

66
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,018
so I came back in a hurry.

67
00:06:49,059 --> 00:06:50,267
When did you make all these?

68
00:06:50,809 --> 00:06:52,267
You must've been busy with Hye In.

69
00:06:54,059 --> 00:06:55,726
I've been inconsiderate of you lately

70
00:06:55,809 --> 00:06:57,475
because I was busy looking after Hye In.

71
00:06:58,475 --> 00:06:59,434
I'm sorry.

72
00:07:10,183 --> 00:07:11,100
Right.

73
00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:12,475
You haven't heard, right?

74
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:14,726
That girl, Min Seol A, she died.

75
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,100
I heard she killed herself.

76
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,517
She killed herself?

77
00:07:26,767 --> 00:07:27,809
All of a sudden? Why?

78
00:07:28,976 --> 00:07:30,225
Kids without parents are like that.

79
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:32,517
People don't change

80
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,434
even as they face death.

81
00:07:33,767 --> 00:07:35,225
I knew she held a grudge.

82
00:07:35,517 --> 00:07:37,392
She set her flat on fire before she died.

83
00:07:52,851 --> 00:07:54,642
Are you having fun on your trip, princess?

84
00:07:54,976 --> 00:07:56,684
Doing okay with Seok Kyung and Eun Byeol?

85
00:07:57,559 --> 00:07:59,892
No, I miss you to death, my princess.

86
00:07:59,976 --> 00:08:01,100
I'm about to go crazy.

87
00:08:01,684 --> 00:08:03,100
You can call me if anything happens.

88
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:05,392
I'll push everything back and run over.

89
00:08:08,976 --> 00:08:10,309
What? She hung up already?

90
00:08:10,684 --> 00:08:12,183
Was that Je Ni? Is she doing well?

91
00:08:12,267 --> 00:08:14,475
She's on a trip with her pals in a while,

92
00:08:14,559 --> 00:08:15,475
so she's thrilled.

93
00:08:15,767 --> 00:08:17,434
I get too worried when she goes out

94
00:08:17,517 --> 00:08:19,350
because she's too pretty.

95
00:08:20,059 --> 00:08:21,059
She's not that pretty.

96
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,100
You won't have to worry that much.

97
00:08:22,434 --> 00:08:23,475
Anyway, bye. - Bye.

98
00:08:24,934 --> 00:08:27,059
How did you get blood on you on that day?

99
00:08:30,225 --> 00:08:31,142
"Blood"?

100
00:08:31,225 --> 00:08:32,600
You know, on the day of our party,

101
00:08:32,684 --> 00:08:33,934
I saw what you were doing...

102
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,851
in the toilet, Dr Ha.

103
00:08:46,892 --> 00:08:49,059
Ma Ri, you're in the men's room.

104
00:09:06,225 --> 00:09:07,183
Oh, that.

105
00:09:07,726 --> 00:09:09,892
I spilled some wine on my clothes.

106
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:11,684
Goodness, blood?

107
00:09:11,767 --> 00:09:13,809
Some people might take it the wrong way.

108
00:09:14,018 --> 00:09:14,934
I'll get going.

109
00:09:17,142 --> 00:09:19,851
Dr Ha, did you do something to her?

110
00:09:23,976 --> 00:09:25,684
I didn't tell anyone

111
00:09:25,767 --> 00:09:26,767
what I saw that day.

112
00:09:26,851 --> 00:09:27,851
Ma Ri.

113
00:09:28,475 --> 00:09:30,059
You need to watch what you say.

114
00:09:30,225 --> 00:09:31,809
It's unpleasant to hear such a suspicion.

115
00:09:32,851 --> 00:09:33,767
Man.

116
00:09:35,434 --> 00:09:36,976
Does he think I'm an idiot?

117
00:09:37,267 --> 00:09:38,492
Do you think I can't tell

118
00:09:38,517 --> 00:09:40,392
wine from blood?

119
00:09:40,934 --> 00:09:42,392
Something is definitely going on.

120
00:09:44,642 --> 00:09:46,059
How much did she see?

121
00:09:47,517 --> 00:09:48,726
"Hera Palace"

122
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:09,726
Gosh, nice shot, Min Hyuk!

123
00:10:29,142 --> 00:10:30,100
Gosh, that girl.

124
00:10:36,934 --> 00:10:37,851
Pick it up.

125
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,267
What is this?

126
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,892
You told me to hit it 120m away.

127
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,617
I made it drop at exactly 120m away.

128
00:10:44,642 --> 00:10:45,683
Why did it fall down there?

129
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:47,701
What if it fell into the hazard?

130
00:10:47,726 --> 00:10:48,851
It ran off a little.

131
00:10:50,059 --> 00:10:51,075
You should've taken that

132
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,873
into calculation before you told me that.

133
00:10:53,809 --> 00:10:54,726
If I lose,

134
00:10:55,142 --> 00:10:56,559
I'm going to get you in trouble.

135
00:10:59,142 --> 00:11:00,726
And? Eun Byeol, it's your turn.

136
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:13,726
What happened to you, Eun Byeol?

137
00:11:13,809 --> 00:11:14,851
I can't believe you missed.

138
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:16,475
Hey.

139
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,862
Something is going on with you, right?

140
00:11:18,018 --> 00:11:19,559
Nothing is going on.

141
00:11:20,517 --> 00:11:21,892
I'm not feeling well. That's all.

142
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,100
Everyone, watch me.

143
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:25,600
I'll end this game.

144
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,018
Seok Kyung!

145
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,142
Oh, no. - Seok Kyung!

146
00:11:34,225 --> 00:11:35,100
Oh, no. - Hey!

147
00:11:35,183 --> 00:11:36,309
Stay calm and hold my hand.

148
00:11:37,767 --> 00:11:38,767
Seok Kyung! - My gosh.

149
00:11:40,684 --> 00:11:42,100
Why is she moving further away?

150
00:11:49,018 --> 00:11:50,517
Oh, no, Seok Kyung.

151
00:11:50,642 --> 00:11:52,267
You need to help her.

152
00:11:53,434 --> 00:11:54,851
Seok Kyung. - Goodness.

153
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,100
Are you okay?

154
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,142
It's all because of you.

155
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:11,465
Everything went wrong

156
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,259
after you told me the wrong distance!

157
00:12:14,183 --> 00:12:15,075
Why didn't you say

158
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,337
there's plastic in the hazard?

159
00:12:16,362 --> 00:12:19,117
You should've told me that it's slippery!

160
00:12:19,142 --> 00:12:21,297
Were you trying to kill me?

161
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:22,475
Stop it. It's all right.

162
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:24,270
Stop it. Nothing bad happened. It's fine.

163
00:12:24,684 --> 00:12:26,431
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

164
00:12:28,059 --> 00:12:30,150
It felt like someone was dragging me in.

165
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:32,309
That darned face.

166
00:12:33,475 --> 00:12:34,392
Who?

167
00:12:37,642 --> 00:12:39,309
Never mind. I must be seeing things.

168
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,350
You almost died in that split second.

169
00:12:42,934 --> 00:12:44,892
I think you saw the Grim Reaper.

170
00:12:44,976 --> 00:12:45,851
Goodness.

171
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:48,809
My gosh, look at you.

172
00:12:50,475 --> 00:12:52,225
It could've been really bad.

173
00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:54,309
Can you continue to play?

174
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:56,261
I feel like crap!

175
00:12:57,183 --> 00:12:58,142
We're done.

176
00:13:11,434 --> 00:13:13,350
What are you doing? Get us inside!

177
00:13:14,018 --> 00:13:14,892
I'm scared.

178
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,183
I want to go home.

179
00:13:16,642 --> 00:13:18,142
What's with you, really?

180
00:13:18,225 --> 00:13:19,392
You've heard the thunder before.

181
00:13:20,851 --> 00:13:22,892
We're going to be punished

182
00:13:23,392 --> 00:13:24,892
for what we did to her.

183
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,100
Shut up!

184
00:13:27,934 --> 00:13:29,809
If you ever bring her up again,

185
00:13:30,225 --> 00:13:31,559
I'm going to kill you.

186
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,183
Girls!

187
00:13:54,018 --> 00:13:55,350
Seok Hoon! - Seok Kyung!

188
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:56,475
It hurts!

189
00:13:57,684 --> 00:13:58,767
Is anybody around?

190
00:13:58,851 --> 00:13:59,934
Min Hyuk. - Don't cry.

191
00:14:00,142 --> 00:14:01,183
Is anybody around?

192
00:14:03,267 --> 00:14:04,434
Are you all right?

193
00:14:05,018 --> 00:14:05,976

Welcome home, Seol A.

205
00:15:27,018 --> 00:15:28,684
We waited so long for you.

206
00:15:30,018 --> 00:15:31,059
Let me introduce them.

207
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:34,350
They will be your dad and mum.

208

Let's go inside.

As of today, your name

211
00:15:53,309 --> 00:15:55,267
is Anna. Anna Lee.

212
00:15:56,726 --> 00:15:57,684
Anna.

213
00:15:59,225 --> 00:16:00,934
I fell in love with them at first sight.

214

Ta-da.

218
00:16:13,517 --> 00:16:14,559
We love you, Anna.

219
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:17,018
Wow.

220
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:26,059
I want to try it on.

221
00:16:26,183 --> 00:16:27,100
It's so pretty.

00:16:55,851 --> 00:16:56,934
My goodness.

228
00:16:58,475 --> 00:16:59,976
Oh, gosh, Sang A.

229
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:06,976
Goodness.

230
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,225
I can't believe she came in that car.

231
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,767
Gosh. - Unbelievable.

232
00:17:14,892 --> 00:17:15,892
Hello.

233
00:17:16,434 --> 00:17:17,475
Am I late?

234
00:17:36,864 --> 00:17:38,280
"Cheonga Arts High School"

235
00:17:38,309 --> 00:17:39,475
Did you see Min Seol A's death

236
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:40,809
covered on the news?

237
00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:43,100
I was really shocked.

238
00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:45,059
What if she went to the same school

239
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:45,976
with our kids?

240
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,350
It's horrifying.

241
00:17:47,642 --> 00:17:49,934
I don't care how good she is.

242
00:17:50,267 --> 00:17:51,851
I can't believe they let such a lowly girl

243
00:17:51,934 --> 00:17:53,100
get accepted as the first place.

244
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,934
Shouldn't the judges be punished?

245
00:17:56,183 --> 00:17:57,767
I knew she seemed wicked,

246
00:17:57,851 --> 00:17:59,517
but she was worse than I thought.

247
00:17:59,892 --> 00:18:01,183
I'd like to apologise

248
00:18:01,267 --> 00:18:02,851
as one of the judges.

249
00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:05,267
But I think we found good out of evil.

250
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,267
All the parents came together

251
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,434
to protect our school's image,

252
00:18:09,517 --> 00:18:10,475
and now,

253
00:18:10,892 --> 00:18:12,767
the source of our trouble is gone too.

254
00:18:12,934 --> 00:18:14,517
Precisely.

255
00:18:15,142 --> 00:18:16,809
She worked at a bar and had a sugar daddy.

256
00:18:17,018 --> 00:18:19,267
She could've influenced our kids.

257
00:18:19,934 --> 00:18:21,434
This prestigious school

258
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:22,934
would've fallen to the rock bottom

259
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:24,434
because of that good-for-nothing.

260
00:18:24,517 --> 00:18:25,475
Goodness. - That's awful.

261
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:26,600
I'm so glad. - Me too.

262
00:18:28,142 --> 00:18:29,100
Seol A...

263
00:18:30,767 --> 00:18:32,142
wasn't like that.

264
00:18:33,642 --> 00:18:34,642
Hello.

265
00:18:35,642 --> 00:18:36,976
I'm the mum of Bae Ro Na.

266
00:18:37,225 --> 00:18:38,475
She was on the waiting list and got in.

267
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:43,267
Has any of you worked as a part-timer

268
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,267
washing grills at a barbecue restaurant?

269
00:18:45,976 --> 00:18:46,892
None, right?

270
00:18:48,726 --> 00:18:49,726
Seol A was a girl

271
00:18:49,976 --> 00:18:51,559
who worked many part-time jobs

272
00:18:51,684 --> 00:18:53,100
that'd be strenuous even for adults

273
00:18:53,851 --> 00:18:55,684
and lived her life to the fullest.

274
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:58,767
What? How do you know that?

275
00:18:59,392 --> 00:19:00,726
Because I saw how she was.

276
00:19:04,142 --> 00:19:06,183
Everyone in this room is a parent.

277
00:19:07,642 --> 00:19:09,309
Isn't it embarrassing to speak ill

278
00:19:09,976 --> 00:19:11,350
of a girl who passed away?

279
00:19:12,517 --> 00:19:13,559
You're the one who hit the jackpot

280
00:19:13,642 --> 00:19:14,767
thanks to the dead girl.

281
00:19:15,684 --> 00:19:18,100
Try to be a bit more honest.

282
00:19:18,475 --> 00:19:19,976
Don't you think you're the happiest person

283
00:19:20,183 --> 00:19:21,267
in this room?

284
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:22,726
You benefitted the most

285
00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:24,309
thanks to that girl's death.

286
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:25,684
You don't even mean what you said.

287
00:19:25,851 --> 00:19:27,267
What a joke.

288
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,392
My gosh. - She has a point.

289
00:19:28,475 --> 00:19:29,434
She's right.

290
00:19:41,392 --> 00:19:42,976
You're really something, Yoon Hee.

291
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,142
How does it feel to be at the PTA meeting?

292
00:19:46,726 --> 00:19:47,684
No one on the waiting list

293
00:19:47,767 --> 00:19:48,600
has ever been accepted

294
00:19:48,684 --> 00:19:50,309
in the history of vocal music department.

295
00:19:50,892 --> 00:19:52,726
Are you lucky? Or...

296
00:19:54,018 --> 00:19:55,475
are you capable of doing something else?

297
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,809
Stop picking a fight with me.

298
00:20:01,392 --> 00:20:03,851
My daughter got in fair and square,

299
00:20:04,434 --> 00:20:05,976
and you can't humiliate her.

300
00:20:10,059 --> 00:20:12,183
How did you find the money to settle?

301
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:13,976
What?

302
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,225
How did you manage

303
00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:17,100
to find 100 million won that quickly?

304
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,684
Did you put your house up for sale

305
00:20:19,767 --> 00:20:21,267
for your daughter's future?

306
00:20:21,392 --> 00:20:22,642
What are you talking about?

307
00:20:23,517 --> 00:20:25,225
You agreed to drop the case.

308
00:20:27,225 --> 00:20:28,142
But why?

309
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,475
Did you also think you were too harsh?

310
00:20:30,851 --> 00:20:32,684
Someone like you might carry around

311
00:20:32,767 --> 00:20:34,059
100 million won all the time,

312
00:20:34,142 --> 00:20:35,100
but I couldn't find

313
00:20:35,142 --> 00:20:36,392
that much money even with my life.

314
00:20:36,726 --> 00:20:38,475
You used money to play with me.

315
00:20:39,726 --> 00:20:40,642
Anyway,

316
00:20:40,934 --> 00:20:42,100
thanks for dropping the case.

317
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,309
My gosh.

318
00:21:03,225 --> 00:21:04,142
Fine.

319
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,517
You're right.

320
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:09,183
Dr Ha asked me so earnestly--

321
00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:10,976
Are you saying the 100 million won

322
00:21:12,767 --> 00:21:14,434
came out of Yoon Chul's pocket?

323
00:21:14,726 --> 00:21:15,892
He said

324
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,600
she wouldn't have any money,

325
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:19,267
that we should do this to save her.

326
00:21:19,517 --> 00:21:21,100
I mean,

327
00:21:21,392 --> 00:21:23,100
he felt absolutely awful for her.

328
00:21:23,183 --> 00:21:24,809
How can you settle my case

329
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,267
without my knowledge as a lawyer?

330
00:21:28,225 --> 00:21:30,475
I will not condone this incident.

331
00:21:32,018 --> 00:21:32,934
Actually,

332
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:35,809
her assault isn't the core of this case.

333
00:21:36,392 --> 00:21:37,684
It's actually about a love affair.

334
00:21:37,767 --> 00:21:39,892
Will you let everyone find out the truth?

335
00:21:40,018 --> 00:21:41,559
If you do that, wouldn't it hurt

336
00:21:41,892 --> 00:21:42,892
your reputation?

337
00:21:42,976 --> 00:21:44,392
You value that more than anything.

338
00:21:45,225 --> 00:21:46,809
I get it.

339
00:21:47,183 --> 00:21:49,018
You don't care. Okay.

340
00:21:58,225 --> 00:22:00,475
Do not tell my husband that I know.

341
00:22:01,434 --> 00:22:02,309
If you do,

342
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,976
I won't let it go.

343
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,475
"Mummy"

344
00:22:21,183 --> 00:22:22,225
My gosh.

345
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:25,392
Yes?

346
00:22:26,018 --> 00:22:27,392
Mum.

347
00:22:29,059 --> 00:22:29,934
Me?

348
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,767
What do you mean?

349
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,684
I'm talking to you right now.

350
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,100
You! - What?

351
00:22:35,225 --> 00:22:36,100
Yes?

352
00:22:36,142 --> 00:22:38,100
You crazy idiot!

353
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:39,934
Do you know how much that thing cost?

354
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:42,059
That was a handmade pocket watch

355
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,059
your dad got for 1.5 billion won.

356
00:22:44,392 --> 00:22:45,350
You took that out in secret,

357
00:22:45,434 --> 00:22:46,559
went out with it,

358
00:22:46,642 --> 00:22:48,309
then completely lost it?

359
00:22:48,726 --> 00:22:49,851
I mean, Mum,

360
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:50,976
it's not like that.

361
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:51,892
What?

362
00:22:53,642 --> 00:22:55,517
I wanted to show it off.

363
00:22:55,976 --> 00:22:57,892
They all look down on me

364
00:22:57,976 --> 00:22:59,851
because I work for my dad.

365
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:01,225
They make fun of me,

366
00:23:01,309 --> 00:23:03,183
saying I'm a penniless papa's boy.

367
00:23:03,267 --> 00:23:05,392
You aren't a papa's boy.

368
00:23:05,475 --> 00:23:06,851
If anything, you're a mama's boy.

369
00:23:06,934 --> 00:23:07,892
Quiet!

370
00:23:09,018 --> 00:23:10,642
Are you two deceiving me

371
00:23:10,892 --> 00:23:12,183
after you sold it off?

372
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:13,142
Mother.

373
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:16,183
How could I dare to deceive you?

374
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,100
The serial number is engraved

375
00:23:18,142 --> 00:23:19,225
on that watch,

376
00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:21,851
so why won't anyone contact me?

377
00:23:24,684 --> 00:23:25,726
As of this month,

378
00:23:26,434 --> 00:23:28,100
I'm putting a seizure on his wage.

379
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,142
No!

380
00:23:30,851 --> 00:23:32,642
He doesn't get paid much anyway.

381
00:23:32,726 --> 00:23:35,018
I'm sure Kyu Jin will find it.

382
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,392
No, he'll make sure he finds it, Mother.

383
00:23:38,267 --> 00:23:39,142
Isn't that so, honey?

384
00:23:39,767 --> 00:23:41,767
How am I going to find it?

385
00:23:42,018 --> 00:23:42,976
It'll kill me

386
00:23:43,059 --> 00:23:44,976
if your wage gets taken away.

387
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:46,225
I'll get killed too.

388
00:23:46,517 --> 00:23:47,559
If I go back there...

389
00:23:47,892 --> 00:23:50,434
Gosh, I might see a ghost. I'm scared.

390
00:24:04,266 --> 00:24:05,861
"Police Line: Under Investigation"

391
00:24:21,767 --> 00:24:23,600
So you lived in a place like this.

392
00:24:35,517 --> 00:24:36,726
"First Prize"

393
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:37,976
"Yeongran Primary School, grade four"

394
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:39,018
"Min Seol A".

395
00:24:47,475 --> 00:24:49,100
Stop holding me back.

396
00:24:49,183 --> 00:24:50,142
Stop grabbing me.

397
00:24:50,225 --> 00:24:51,517
You're walking way too fast.

398
00:24:51,892 --> 00:24:52,809
Go slowly.

399
00:24:53,018 --> 00:24:54,142
Slowly, please.

400
00:24:55,642 --> 00:24:56,559
My gosh.

401
00:24:59,225 --> 00:25:00,183
Ugh.

402
00:25:00,934 --> 00:25:01,934
Why did you want to come

403
00:25:02,018 --> 00:25:03,100
to a house where a kid died?

404
00:25:03,142 --> 00:25:04,309
This is too spooky.

405
00:25:04,809 --> 00:25:05,684
I mean,

406
00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:07,284
it wasn't in the flower bed,

407
00:25:07,309 --> 00:25:08,475
so you never know.

408
00:25:09,183 --> 00:25:11,726
I'll give you a huge commission.

409
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:14,309
It's a one-of-a-kind skeleton watch

410
00:25:14,517 --> 00:25:16,225
that came from Switzerland.

411
00:25:16,309 --> 00:25:17,350
I told you that, right?

412
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:19,309
You said it at least 100 times on our way.

413
00:25:19,642 --> 00:25:21,892
Anyway, it wasn't in my car.

414
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,309
Even if you dropped it here,

415
00:25:23,392 --> 00:25:24,892
it'd have been burnt.

416
00:25:25,018 --> 00:25:26,851
So why did you put on your dad's watch?

417
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:30,434
Why did he set this house on fire?

418
00:25:31,309 --> 00:25:33,267
If you think about it, Joo Dan Tae

419
00:25:33,475 --> 00:25:35,809
is a total freak. He's totally insane!

420
00:25:35,976 --> 00:25:37,100
It's not here.

421
00:25:37,851 --> 00:25:39,851
Maybe the police took it.

422
00:25:40,183 --> 00:25:41,617
You should just tell Dan Tae

423
00:25:41,642 --> 00:25:43,158
and see if the police have anything.

424
00:25:43,183 --> 00:25:45,284
There's no way I can tell him that.

425
00:25:45,309 --> 00:25:46,142
Darn you.

426
00:25:46,267 --> 00:25:47,575
Think about his awful temper.

427
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,726
If he finds out I dropped something,

428
00:25:49,142 --> 00:25:51,100
he's obviously going to make a scene.

429
00:25:51,517 --> 00:25:53,142
This is driving me insane.

430
00:25:53,851 --> 00:25:54,767
Anyhow,

431
00:25:55,434 --> 00:25:57,726
that little girl made everything chaotic.

432
00:25:58,434 --> 00:26:00,892
Why did she die at our apartment building

433
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,034
and caused this trouble?

434
00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:03,267
Stop it. Stop.

435
00:26:30,934 --> 00:26:32,100
It's a ghost! - What? Why?

436
00:26:32,309 --> 00:26:33,350
It's a ghost!

437
00:26:33,475 --> 00:26:34,642
Help!

438
00:26:34,809 --> 00:26:36,100
It's a ghost!

439
00:26:37,018 --> 00:26:38,600
My gosh! Help me!

440
00:26:38,684 --> 00:26:40,142
It's a ghost!

441
00:27:06,684 --> 00:27:07,934
Is this Mummy?

442
00:27:11,976 --> 00:27:12,934
Seol A...

443
00:27:43,309 --> 00:27:45,100
They all conspired together.

444
00:27:49,767 --> 00:27:51,225
I'm never going to forgive

445
00:27:52,767 --> 00:27:54,100
the people who did this to you.

446
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,183
I will find

447
00:27:58,726 --> 00:27:59,809
every single one of them

448
00:28:01,434 --> 00:28:02,851
and rip them into pieces.

449
00:28:21,851 --> 00:28:22,809
Are you Sugar?

450
00:28:25,517 --> 00:28:26,517
Sugar.

451
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,851
It's a one-of-a-kind skeleton watch

452
00:28:37,059 --> 00:28:38,851
that came from Switzerland.

453
00:28:38,934 --> 00:28:40,018
I told you that, right?

454
00:28:52,684 --> 00:28:55,559
"Min Seol A was"

455
00:28:55,642 --> 00:28:58,559
"murdered at Hera Palace"

456
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:04,309
"Min Seol A was murdered at Hera Palace"

457
00:29:04,934 --> 00:29:08,517
"Mr Yoon"

458
00:29:11,309 --> 00:29:12,225
Hello?

459
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,059
What?

460
00:29:14,851 --> 00:29:15,851
Don't touch it until I'm there.

461
00:29:17,767 --> 00:29:18,600
Dad.

462
00:29:18,684 --> 00:29:19,600
The fountain.

463
00:29:19,684 --> 00:29:20,600
Darn it.

464
00:29:32,059 --> 00:29:34,726
"Min Seol A was murdered at Hera Palace"

465
00:29:35,018 --> 00:29:35,892
Take it down.

466
00:29:35,976 --> 00:29:36,934
Yes, sir.

467
00:29:43,809 --> 00:29:44,851
Have it checked for fingerprints.

468
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:46,100
Yes, sir.

469
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,726
Who was the first to find this?

470
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:51,142
Eun Byeol and Je Ni.

471
00:29:51,309 --> 00:29:52,559
They were coming back from swimming.

472
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,392
The security cameras were all turned away.

473
00:29:55,726 --> 00:29:56,559
It's either someone

474
00:29:56,642 --> 00:29:57,726
who knows this place well...

475
00:29:58,059 --> 00:29:59,475
Or someone who lives here.

476
00:30:00,851 --> 00:30:02,684
Does this mean there was an eyewitness--

477
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:03,726
Shut it.

478
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,559
Someone is trying to use her death

479
00:30:07,809 --> 00:30:09,142
with a malicious intent

480
00:30:09,225 --> 00:30:10,892
to shake Hera Palace around.

481
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:12,309
Yes, you're right.

482
00:30:12,934 --> 00:30:14,100
Someone is trying to scare us

483
00:30:14,183 --> 00:30:15,142
with a closed case.

484
00:30:15,475 --> 00:30:19,018
It's to drop our apartment price.

485
00:30:19,642 --> 00:30:21,600
I will not let this go.

486
00:30:22,183 --> 00:30:23,392
I don't care who this is

487
00:30:23,475 --> 00:30:24,642
that's trying to attack Hera Palace.

488
00:30:25,225 --> 00:30:26,142
We won't let it slide.

489
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:27,517
Of course, we won't.

490
00:30:29,475 --> 00:30:31,600
Did you see anyone suspicious?

491
00:30:32,142 --> 00:30:33,350
We didn't see anyone.

492
00:30:33,434 --> 00:30:34,642
It was just the two of us.

493
00:30:36,892 --> 00:30:37,976
Eun Byeol. Eun Byeol!

494
00:30:38,976 --> 00:30:40,392
Eun Byeol. - Eun Byeol.

495
00:30:40,809 --> 00:30:41,809
Eun Byeol. - Eun Byeol.

496
00:30:41,934 --> 00:30:42,809
Are you okay? - Are you all right?

497
00:30:42,892 --> 00:30:43,767
Eun Byeol!

498
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:55,684
Are you awake?

499
00:30:56,726 --> 00:30:57,642
Eun Byeol.

500
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,267
Let's have a talk.

501
00:30:59,809 --> 00:31:01,434
A death of someone you knew

502
00:31:01,684 --> 00:31:03,309
could be very stressful.

503
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,100
I'm thinking of taking you to my junior

504
00:31:06,309 --> 00:31:07,726
who's an expert on PTSD.

505
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,600
No.

506
00:31:10,018 --> 00:31:11,018
I'm fine.

507
00:31:11,934 --> 00:31:13,225
You should get to work.

508
00:31:13,851 --> 00:31:16,100
Eun Byeol isn't that weak.

509
00:31:19,018 --> 00:31:20,225
Give it a thought, Eun Byeol.

510
00:31:29,642 --> 00:31:30,809
It's unlike you to collapse

511
00:31:30,892 --> 00:31:31,851
over something petty like this.

512
00:31:32,142 --> 00:31:33,100
This is a time

513
00:31:33,142 --> 00:31:34,142
for you to keep yourself together.

514
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:36,142
You need to prepare your entrance recital.

515
00:31:40,767 --> 00:31:43,267
I heard you

516
00:31:44,267 --> 00:31:46,726
and Min Seol A at the mechanical room.

517
00:31:50,267 --> 00:31:51,183
What?

518
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:53,183
Min Seol A saw

519
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:55,183
the fabricated grade sheet.

520
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,559
What will happen to us

521
00:31:56,642 --> 00:31:57,851
if people found out?

522
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,767
Will something bad happen to me?

523
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,059
That's not going to happen.

524
00:32:05,392 --> 00:32:06,475
She's dead.

525
00:32:07,684 --> 00:32:08,851
I let

526
00:32:09,517 --> 00:32:10,475
Min Seol A go

527
00:32:11,517 --> 00:32:12,892
from the mechanical room.

528
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,225
What?

529
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,559
Why did you do that?

530
00:32:19,183 --> 00:32:20,142
Who knows?

531
00:32:20,809 --> 00:32:22,434
I may know much more

532
00:32:22,767 --> 00:32:24,225
than you think.

533
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,642
What could you possibly know?

534
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:28,392
The admission process was rigged.

535
00:32:29,726 --> 00:32:31,100
I know all about it.

536
00:32:32,767 --> 00:32:34,059
Your daughter, Ha Eun Byeol,

537
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,434
was she accepted fairly?

538
00:32:38,018 --> 00:32:38,976
Are you sure she didn't steal

539
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:40,100
someone else's spot?

540
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,726
I saw it with my own two eyes.

541
00:32:42,183 --> 00:32:43,225
You rigged the grade sheet

542
00:32:43,309 --> 00:32:44,559
for the performance exam.

543
00:32:45,225 --> 00:32:46,225
Die!

544
00:32:47,767 --> 00:32:48,767
Die!

545
00:32:51,059 --> 00:32:52,059
Die!

546
00:33:27,851 --> 00:33:29,059
I trusted you.

547
00:33:29,517 --> 00:33:30,767
Only you knew about

548
00:33:30,851 --> 00:33:32,018
how I messed up my performance exam.

549
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:33,976
How can you threaten my mum with that?

550
00:33:34,309 --> 00:33:35,434
How do you call yourself a human?

551
00:33:35,642 --> 00:33:37,018
I had no other choice.

552
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,767
I had to have something

553
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:40,309
your mum would be scared of

554
00:33:40,392 --> 00:33:41,767
in order to protect myself.

555
00:33:44,267 --> 00:33:45,851
I'll give you my phone, so let me go.

556
00:33:46,434 --> 00:33:48,100
How am I supposed to trust you?

557
00:33:48,517 --> 00:33:49,934
I'm fed up.

558
00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:52,100
Your mum

559
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,350
and all the adults in this place

560
00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:55,225
make me sick to my stomach.

561
00:33:56,225 --> 00:33:57,726
I don't want to be involved with them.

562
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,309
So let me go.

563
00:34:00,809 --> 00:34:02,309
I'll give you what you want.

564
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,392
Do you mean it?

565
00:34:09,809 --> 00:34:11,600
I'll kill you if you try to pull anything.

566
00:34:28,225 --> 00:34:29,934
Hey! Stop right there!

567
00:34:46,642 --> 00:34:48,059
Stop right there!

568
00:35:10,726 --> 00:35:12,183
Don't do this, Eun Byeol.

569
00:35:13,517 --> 00:35:14,434
Please.

570
00:35:14,517 --> 00:35:15,350
Give it to me.

571
00:35:15,809 --> 00:35:17,559
Give me your phone!

572
00:35:29,892 --> 00:35:31,517
She died because of me.

573
00:35:32,309 --> 00:35:33,600
It's my fault.

574
00:35:35,183 --> 00:35:36,142
It wasn't your fault.

575
00:35:36,225 --> 00:35:37,142
Min Seol A...

576
00:35:38,267 --> 00:35:39,225
just lost her balance

577
00:35:39,309 --> 00:35:40,350
and fell as she ran off.

578
00:35:42,018 --> 00:35:43,018
Min Seol A died

579
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,018
at Bosong Village.

580
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,142
No?

581
00:35:48,892 --> 00:35:50,434
Did she die at Hera Palace?

582
00:35:52,059 --> 00:35:52,976
Tell me.

583
00:35:53,059 --> 00:35:54,726
Did she die at Hera Palace?

584
00:35:57,142 --> 00:35:58,559
Listen up.

585
00:35:59,059 --> 00:36:00,100
On that day, Min Seol A

586
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:01,309
killed herself

587
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:02,517
on the rooftop of her place.

588
00:36:03,018 --> 00:36:04,100
Do you understand?

589
00:36:04,767 --> 00:36:05,726
Answer me!

590
00:36:08,726 --> 00:36:09,684
No.

591
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,100
She didn't.

592
00:36:12,225 --> 00:36:13,392
You're lying.

593
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:14,976
Trust me!

594
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:18,309
Does anyone else

595
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,142
know about this?

596
00:36:28,684 --> 00:36:30,059
Don't ever tell anyone.

597
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:31,976
You can't tell anyone until you die.

598
00:36:32,267 --> 00:36:33,350
You weren't there.

599
00:36:33,434 --> 00:36:35,100
You don't know anything.

600
00:36:35,851 --> 00:36:36,767
This is a secret

601
00:36:36,976 --> 00:36:38,642
between you and me. Okay?

602
00:36:39,642 --> 00:36:40,559
Do you understand?

603
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,059
Forget everything.

604
00:36:46,267 --> 00:36:47,642
Everything that's related to her.

605
00:36:47,726 --> 00:36:48,684
She was just...

606
00:36:50,684 --> 00:36:51,976
meant to die that day.

607
00:36:52,059 --> 00:36:52,976
That's why...

608
00:36:55,475 --> 00:36:56,809
it wasn't your fault.

609
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:01,809
Get ready.

610
00:37:02,392 --> 00:37:03,559
You'll be late for your practice.

contact information?

I can't disclose any personal information.

They're no longer her adoptive parents,

and they want nothing to do with her.

641
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:19,625
They want nothing to do with her?

642
00:39:21,417 --> 00:39:22,959
Why did they send her back?

It says here that

647
00:39:33,584 --> 00:39:35,349
she was deported for committing a crime.

648
00:39:35,374 --> 00:39:36,833
What? A crime?

00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,876

It's all over. Why dig up the past?

652
00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:47,209
I must find out

653
00:39:47,959 --> 00:39:49,333
who her adoptive parents were

654
00:39:49,959 --> 00:39:51,250
and why she was sent back.

655
00:39:51,834 --> 00:39:53,876
I told you that I don't know.

Seol A is dead anyway.

How do you know?

659
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:03,375
Obviously, I got a call because she was

660
00:40:03,459 --> 00:40:05,042
one of the kids at my children's home.

661
00:40:06,126 --> 00:40:07,750
She set her place on fire and died.

It was all over the news.

663

What are you hiding?

665
00:40:16,635 --> 00:40:18,283
Tell me what you're hiding!

666
00:40:38,542 --> 00:40:39,792
Is she that woman

667
00:40:40,042 --> 00:40:41,250
who came to see you last time?

668
00:40:41,792 --> 00:40:42,834
Yes, sir.

669
00:40:42,917 --> 00:40:44,250
She came by a few times

670
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:46,333
and kept asking about Min Seol A.

671
00:40:46,542 --> 00:40:48,168
She abandoned her. Why is she suddenly...

672
00:40:48,917 --> 00:40:50,834
You didn't say anything about me, right?

673
00:40:50,917 --> 00:40:52,250
Of course I didn't.

674
00:40:52,625 --> 00:40:53,667
Why would I bring it up?

675
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:55,168
Unless I've totally lost my mind.

676
00:40:55,709 --> 00:40:56,834
We might be

677
00:40:57,792 --> 00:40:59,750
in for some luck.

678
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,792

684
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:19,250

00:41:23,042 --> 00:41:24,250
I've heard a lot about you.

687
00:41:25,001 --> 00:41:27,667
I heard you're one obnoxious stuck-up.

688
00:41:28,001 --> 00:41:29,500
I'm Bae Ro Na, not Waiting List.

689
00:41:29,584 --> 00:41:30,834
My gosh. - She's feisty.

690
00:41:30,917 --> 00:41:32,126
You saw that, right?

691
00:41:32,209 --> 00:41:33,542
Gosh. - This is how she is.

692
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:35,917
She's unbelievably brazen.

693
00:41:36,168 --> 00:41:37,292
Hello.

694
00:41:37,375 --> 00:41:39,584
You can speak Italian, right?

695
00:41:40,417 --> 00:41:42,292
Will you look at what she's wearing?

696
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:44,333
Gosh, she looks so dowdy.

697
00:41:45,084 --> 00:41:48,417
But she has a pretty face.

698
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:51,750
You think she's pretty?

699
00:41:52,417 --> 00:41:54,250
What's wrong with your eyes?

700
00:41:54,876 --> 00:41:55,917
Are you that proud

701
00:41:56,001 --> 00:41:57,250
that you can speak a foreign language?

702
00:41:57,834 --> 00:41:59,084
Is that all you can boast about?

703
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:01,667
Move if you're not going to sit

704
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:02,876
next to me.

705
00:42:04,667 --> 00:42:06,001
Min Hyuk.

706
00:42:06,792 --> 00:42:08,500
I bumped into this.

707
00:42:08,584 --> 00:42:09,876
Is my shoulder joint dislocated? It hurts.

708
00:42:09,959 --> 00:42:11,834
Gosh, she's a total bully.

709
00:42:12,084 --> 00:42:13,834
Waiting List, you're awfully confident.

710
00:42:14,126 --> 00:42:15,584
Are you always this brazen?

711
00:42:15,959 --> 00:42:17,417
Why? I like that she's feisty.

712
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:19,168
Enough, guys.

713
00:42:20,042 --> 00:42:21,417
Stop acting like kids.

714
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:22,792
You're not in elementary school.

715
00:42:23,126 --> 00:42:24,709
Who cares if she was on the waiting list?

716
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,168
We're all friends now.

717
00:42:28,126 --> 00:42:29,250
I'm Joo Seok Kyung.

718
00:42:29,959 --> 00:42:31,126
I hope we can get along.

719
00:42:32,459 --> 00:42:33,542
I'm Bae Ro Na.

720
00:42:33,625 --> 00:42:34,917
Nice to meet you.

721
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:38,084
What's with her?

722
00:42:38,834 --> 00:42:41,250
Guys, we have a situation.

723
00:42:44,792 --> 00:42:46,084
Someone posted on the school website

724
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,126
about why Min Seol A died.

725
00:42:48,209 --> 00:42:49,375
Please save me.

726
00:42:49,459 --> 00:42:51,959
All right. Look over here.

727
00:42:52,042 --> 00:42:53,750
I'll make you look pretty. - I totally get

728
00:42:53,834 --> 00:42:55,209
why your parents abandoned you.

729
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:56,667
My gosh, is that why she died?

730
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:58,750
Min Seol A was the victim after all.

731
00:42:58,834 --> 00:43:00,250
Those twins are notorious.

732
00:43:00,292 --> 00:43:01,417
I feel bad for Min Seol A.

733
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,292
Aren't they the rich kids at Hera Palace?

734
00:43:03,417 --> 00:43:06,084
This should be on "Unanswered Questions"!

735
00:43:06,168 --> 00:43:07,959
They should go to jail!

736
00:43:08,042 --> 00:43:09,333
I bet there are more victims.

737
00:43:09,625 --> 00:43:10,459
"Why Min Seol A died"

738
00:43:10,792 --> 00:43:11,792
"This account has been deactivated."

739
00:43:11,917 --> 00:43:14,292
We've shut down the social media page

740
00:43:14,375 --> 00:43:15,625
for now.

741
00:43:16,001 --> 00:43:18,250
But some kids already copied the file,

742
00:43:18,876 --> 00:43:20,625
so we can't stop it from spreading.

743
00:43:22,126 --> 00:43:23,168
What are the parents saying?

744
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:24,959
They are all demanding

745
00:43:25,375 --> 00:43:26,584
to know the truth.

746
00:43:28,292 --> 00:43:30,250
Who on earth would do this?

747
00:43:30,584 --> 00:43:31,917
That girl, Min Seol A,

748
00:43:32,625 --> 00:43:34,417
is such a nuisance even after she died.

749
00:43:34,667 --> 00:43:36,959
I should've just granted admission

750
00:43:37,459 --> 00:43:39,417
to Bae Ro Na, like her mum had requested.

751
00:43:44,001 --> 00:43:45,333
Bae Ro Na's mum?

752
00:43:45,417 --> 00:43:46,459
Yes.

753
00:43:47,042 --> 00:43:48,042
That woman

754
00:43:48,333 --> 00:43:50,001
visited me every single day for a while

755
00:43:50,084 --> 00:43:51,500
and begged me.

756
00:43:52,042 --> 00:43:53,542
She asked if there was an empty slot

757
00:43:53,834 --> 00:43:55,959
and kept bugging me.

758
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:58,250
She...

759
00:44:00,375 --> 00:44:01,625
did that?

760
00:44:06,876 --> 00:44:08,542
Write up an anonymous letter.

761
00:44:08,667 --> 00:44:09,625
And I need you

762
00:44:09,876 --> 00:44:11,459
to secretly look into something.

763
00:44:16,001 --> 00:44:17,417
The one who put up that sign

764
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,292
and the one who uploaded that file

765
00:44:19,375 --> 00:44:22,375
are the same person!

766
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:23,834
Calm down, please.

767
00:44:24,459 --> 00:44:25,584
The girl is already dead,

768
00:44:25,667 --> 00:44:27,126
so the police can't investigate it.

769
00:44:27,209 --> 00:44:28,792
But if a TV show covers it,

770
00:44:28,876 --> 00:44:30,250
who knows what will happen?

771
00:44:30,625 --> 00:44:32,084
We can't stop it from going viral

772
00:44:32,168 --> 00:44:33,042
on social media.

773
00:44:33,126 --> 00:44:34,209
You're talking as if

774
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:35,584
this doesn't involve you.

775
00:44:35,959 --> 00:44:36,834
If this comes to the surface,

776
00:44:36,917 --> 00:44:38,209
all of us and our kids

777
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:39,500
will be done for.

778
00:44:39,584 --> 00:44:40,876
Exactly.

779
00:44:41,168 --> 00:44:43,459
Frankly, it was Min Seol A's fault too.

780
00:44:43,709 --> 00:44:45,250
She lied that she was in college

781
00:44:45,292 --> 00:44:46,500
just to tutor the kids.

782
00:44:46,584 --> 00:44:47,959
Min Seol A's death

783
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:50,584
may not be our kids' fault.

784
00:44:50,667 --> 00:44:52,084
What do you mean?

785
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:53,917
Number one on the wait list, Bae Ro Na.

786
00:44:54,333 --> 00:44:55,459
It looks like her mum

787
00:44:56,792 --> 00:44:58,750
approached Min Seol A.

788
00:44:59,417 --> 00:45:00,834
What are you talking about?

789
00:45:01,209 --> 00:45:02,917
What about her? What did she say?

790
00:45:03,001 --> 00:45:05,209
Don't tell me she demanded

791
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:06,876
Min Seol A's spot.

792
00:45:09,084 --> 00:45:10,250
My gosh.

793
00:45:12,792 --> 00:45:14,792
She's really something.

794
00:45:15,126 --> 00:45:16,126
That woman.

795
00:45:17,625 --> 00:45:18,750
My goodness.

796
00:45:18,917 --> 00:45:22,084
So she threatened that poor girl?

797
00:45:22,333 --> 00:45:25,375
That is disgusting.

798
00:45:25,667 --> 00:45:27,209
A scandal must be buried

799
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:28,375
with a bigger scandal.

800
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:29,917
We'll just change the target

801
00:45:30,292 --> 00:45:31,459
from our kids

802
00:45:31,834 --> 00:45:32,834
to someone else.

803
00:45:32,917 --> 00:45:35,375
Right, rumours are always scarier

804
00:45:35,459 --> 00:45:37,001
than the actual truth.

805
00:45:37,084 --> 00:45:39,417
We will overcome this crisis

806
00:45:39,625 --> 00:45:41,084
like we always do.

807
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:42,959
Do we have solid evidence

808
00:45:44,168 --> 00:45:46,126
that she threatened Min Seol A?

809
00:45:46,584 --> 00:45:48,584
I am searching for evidence now.

810
00:45:48,917 --> 00:45:50,542
As soon as we gather some evidence,

811
00:45:50,667 --> 00:45:51,917
we'll summon all the parents

812
00:45:52,001 --> 00:45:53,084
for an emergency meeting.

813
00:46:04,667 --> 00:46:06,292
Your help will be much appreciated, sir.

814
00:46:06,625 --> 00:46:07,542
Please make sure

815
00:46:07,834 --> 00:46:09,084
it doesn't make news.

816
00:46:09,168 --> 00:46:11,168
You know that I always repay my debts.

817
00:46:12,625 --> 00:46:13,584
Oh, right.

818
00:46:14,834 --> 00:46:16,292
Here are some documents

819
00:46:17,001 --> 00:46:18,250
on Assemblyman Song's slush fund.

820
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:20,042
I figured you'd need them

821
00:46:20,126 --> 00:46:21,168
for your upcoming election.

822
00:46:32,084 --> 00:46:33,876
We've known each other for many years,

823
00:46:33,959 --> 00:46:36,459
so I'll do my best.

824
00:46:36,542 --> 00:46:37,584
Thank you.

825
00:46:50,876 --> 00:46:52,209
Please excuse me.

826
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:53,750
This is an urgent call.

827
00:46:55,917 --> 00:46:57,126
Hello, chief.

828
00:47:00,375 --> 00:47:03,500
You always look so elegant, Ms Sim.

829
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:05,168
You perfectly match

830
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:07,168
this beautiful penthouse.

831
00:47:08,168 --> 00:47:09,333
I'll leave you two to talk.

832
00:47:12,292 --> 00:47:13,459
Min Seol A.

833
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:18,168
How do you know her?

834
00:47:21,625 --> 00:47:23,168
How do you

835
00:47:24,542 --> 00:47:26,168
know about her?

836
00:47:29,584 --> 00:47:30,792
A politician and an orphan.

837
00:47:30,876 --> 00:47:32,959
It's not strange that I knew her.

838
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:35,001
But your situation is different.

839
00:47:35,709 --> 00:47:38,042
What if Chairman Joo finds out

840
00:47:39,001 --> 00:47:41,375
about your real daughter?

841
00:47:49,876 --> 00:47:51,667
What are you talking about?

842
00:47:53,209 --> 00:47:55,168
When you step out of the greenhouse,

843
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:56,542
you may encounter a rainstorm

844
00:47:56,625 --> 00:47:59,542
accompanied by lightning and thunder.

845
00:48:00,084 --> 00:48:02,084
What I'm saying is, if our talk goes well,

846
00:48:02,542 --> 00:48:04,084
you will never be

847
00:48:04,542 --> 00:48:08,250
kicked out of this penthouse.

848
00:48:34,917 --> 00:48:37,250
"Cheonga Arts School"

849
00:48:37,292 --> 00:48:40,084
"And Foundation for the Arts"

850
00:48:41,417 --> 00:48:42,834
"Cheonga Arts School"

851
00:48:42,959 --> 00:48:44,333
"And Foundation for the Arts"

852
00:48:57,417 --> 00:48:58,584
Oh Yoon Hee.

853
00:48:59,542 --> 00:49:00,667
Let's end this ill-fated relationship

854
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:01,917
once and for all.

855
00:49:19,917 --> 00:49:22,333
I've been entrusted with the rights

856
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:24,001
of the chief director

857
00:49:24,084 --> 00:49:27,333
to host this emergency meeting.

858
00:49:30,042 --> 00:49:31,084
Why did you

859
00:49:31,917 --> 00:49:33,542
ask me to attend this meeting?

860
00:49:33,834 --> 00:49:35,333
The headmaster received

861
00:49:35,417 --> 00:49:37,084
an anonymous letter a few days ago.

862
00:49:37,709 --> 00:49:40,168
Lee Min Hyuk's mother will read

863
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:41,542
the letter to us.

864
00:49:41,667 --> 00:49:43,459
"Emergency Parents' Meeting"

865
00:49:43,625 --> 00:49:45,709
"Emergency Parents' Meeting"

866
00:49:45,917 --> 00:49:47,459
"I'm writing to expose

867
00:49:47,542 --> 00:49:49,375
a mother's twisted obsession and madness.

868
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:52,001
She's the mother of the number one student

869
00:49:52,084 --> 00:49:53,292
on the waiting list."

870
00:49:54,792 --> 00:49:57,209
What are you talking about?

871
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:00,333
Please be seated.

872
00:50:04,792 --> 00:50:06,375
"She is a murderer.

873
00:50:08,042 --> 00:50:09,584
In order to get her daughter

874
00:50:09,667 --> 00:50:11,667
admitted to the school, she consistently

875
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:13,168
and obsessively coerced the victim

876
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:15,250
to give up her admission.

877
00:50:16,709 --> 00:50:18,250
She could do that because

878
00:50:18,417 --> 00:50:20,084
the victim had no parents.

879
00:50:21,292 --> 00:50:23,209
If the victim really died

880
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:24,584
because of her,

881
00:50:24,667 --> 00:50:27,168
I request that Cheonga Arts High School

882
00:50:27,542 --> 00:50:30,001
uncover the truth so that her death

883
00:50:30,084 --> 00:50:31,792
won't be in vain."

884
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:33,625
My gosh. - This is crazy.

885
00:50:46,876 --> 00:50:48,209
"A mother's twisted obsession and madness"

886
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:49,709
Guys, this is crazy!

887
00:50:51,209 --> 00:50:52,584
"I'm writing to expose

888
00:50:52,667 --> 00:50:54,250
a mother's twisted obsession and madness."

889
00:50:54,333 --> 00:50:55,542
My gosh. - What's happening?

890
00:50:55,625 --> 00:50:57,625
Hey, isn't this about your mum?

891
00:50:58,001 --> 00:50:59,417
You were number one on the waiting list.

892
00:51:00,001 --> 00:51:02,042
"She is a murderer"?

893
00:51:05,459 --> 00:51:06,709
This can't be.

894
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:08,459
That is not true.

895
00:51:09,001 --> 00:51:11,375
I didn't do anything to that girl.

896
00:51:12,375 --> 00:51:13,459
From what I know,

897
00:51:13,834 --> 00:51:15,250
the kids at Hera Palace

898
00:51:15,542 --> 00:51:17,417
harassed that girl.

899
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:18,750
And that's why

900
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:20,375
she took her own life.

901
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:22,375
I doubt that!

902
00:51:23,542 --> 00:51:24,667
I accidentally

903
00:51:25,042 --> 00:51:27,168
gave that woman some information.

904
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:28,500
Information about that girl.

905
00:51:29,459 --> 00:51:32,459
Oh, I heard an orphan got in.

906
00:51:32,917 --> 00:51:34,500
Why don't you meet her?

907
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:38,209
Who knows? If you give her a ton of money,

908
00:51:38,542 --> 00:51:39,792
she may give up her place.

909
00:51:40,001 --> 00:51:41,584
But she actually went to see her.

910
00:51:42,292 --> 00:51:43,250
Honestly,

911
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:45,584
I never imagined she'd actually do it.

912
00:51:46,417 --> 00:51:50,250
Well, why don't I handle the rest?

913
00:51:50,333 --> 00:51:51,209
Okay.

914
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:53,834
I'm Lee Kyu Jin.

915
00:51:54,584 --> 00:51:55,750
Ms Oh Yoon Hee.

916
00:51:56,209 --> 00:51:58,168
As soon as you heard about the "orphan,"

917
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:00,542
you came to the school right away

918
00:52:00,625 --> 00:52:01,667
and headed straight

919
00:52:02,042 --> 00:52:03,876
to the headmaster's office.

920
00:52:04,209 --> 00:52:05,168
Is that correct?

921
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:07,209
What are you all doing right now?

922
00:52:07,542 --> 00:52:08,667
It is correct.

923
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:11,250
Do you

924
00:52:11,625 --> 00:52:13,333
happen to remember what you

925
00:52:13,417 --> 00:52:15,168
and Ms Oh talked about that day?

926
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:16,876
She demanded to see

927
00:52:17,001 --> 00:52:18,459
the list of admitted students.

928
00:52:21,126 --> 00:52:24,168
That was just in case...

929
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:25,417
"Just in case"?

930
00:52:26,042 --> 00:52:27,584
"That girl is poor and has nothing.

931
00:52:27,667 --> 00:52:28,792
If I threaten her,

932
00:52:28,876 --> 00:52:30,625
maybe she'll give up her admission."

933
00:52:30,709 --> 00:52:33,375
It was because of that hope.

934
00:52:34,292 --> 00:52:35,333
Am I wrong?

935
00:52:36,792 --> 00:52:40,625
Maybe your mum pushed Seol A

936
00:52:40,709 --> 00:52:41,876
from the roof.

937
00:52:42,168 --> 00:52:43,250
She did that

938
00:52:43,292 --> 00:52:44,834
for her daughter?

939
00:52:44,917 --> 00:52:46,250
Gosh, that creeps me out.

940
00:52:47,709 --> 00:52:49,292
Come to think of it, your mum

941
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:50,834
came to see us the day after Seol A died.

942
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:52,084
With bloody hands.

943
00:52:52,168 --> 00:52:54,084
My gosh. - "Bloody hands"?

944
00:52:54,625 --> 00:52:56,917
I wonder what really happened.

945
00:52:58,375 --> 00:52:59,542
Maybe she killed Seol A

946
00:52:59,625 --> 00:53:00,625
and staged it as a suicide.

947
00:53:00,709 --> 00:53:01,792
Are you done?

948
00:53:05,584 --> 00:53:07,042
Hey, you're so dead!

949
00:53:08,709 --> 00:53:09,834
My gosh.

950
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:19,209
You little...

951
00:53:23,625 --> 00:53:24,792
Hey!

952
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:32,417
How dare you push me.

953
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,042
Do you have a death wish?

954
00:53:35,209 --> 00:53:36,250
At the time...

955
00:53:38,209 --> 00:53:39,792
I was desperate at the time.

956
00:53:40,667 --> 00:53:42,126
When I heard her admission

957
00:53:42,209 --> 00:53:43,250
could get cancelled,

958
00:53:44,168 --> 00:53:45,292
I thought

959
00:53:45,792 --> 00:53:48,375
Ro Na might have a chance.

960
00:53:48,917 --> 00:53:50,001
But...

961
00:53:50,084 --> 00:53:51,209
Is that why

962
00:53:52,001 --> 00:53:55,001
you went to meet that poor orphan

963
00:53:56,042 --> 00:53:57,500
and even...

964
00:54:00,168 --> 00:54:01,542
stalked her?

965
00:54:02,459 --> 00:54:04,292
No, I did not!

966
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:07,792
It's true that I went to see her, but...

967
00:54:08,168 --> 00:54:09,168
That reminds me.

968
00:54:10,001 --> 00:54:11,126
She said she saw Min Seol A

969
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:12,250
working part-time.

970
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,209
If she'd never stalked her,

971
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:16,917
how would she have known where she worked?

972
00:54:17,168 --> 00:54:18,209
Am I wrong?

973
00:54:19,042 --> 00:54:20,168
You're absolutely right.

974
00:54:20,584 --> 00:54:21,584
I remember that too.

975
00:54:23,709 --> 00:54:25,959
Great point.

976
00:54:27,001 --> 00:54:28,126
That is precisely why

977
00:54:28,834 --> 00:54:31,417
I summoned this person here today

978
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:32,500
as a witness.

979
00:54:34,667 --> 00:54:35,750
"Emergency Parents' Meeting"

980
00:54:36,126 --> 00:54:37,542
"Hyundong BBQ"

981
00:54:38,042 --> 00:54:39,084
Yes.

982
00:54:40,126 --> 00:54:42,001
That woman came to my restaurant.

983
00:54:43,209 --> 00:54:44,542
Come to think of it,

984
00:54:46,126 --> 00:54:47,709
I'm certain that she came

985
00:54:47,792 --> 00:54:49,584
to harass poor Seol A.

986
00:54:52,084 --> 00:54:54,084
What on earth are you talking about?

987
00:54:54,792 --> 00:54:56,459
Who's the one that actually harassed her?

988
00:54:58,417 --> 00:55:01,584
Shouldn't we call the police right away?

989
00:55:10,209 --> 00:55:11,375
It was the first time

990
00:55:11,834 --> 00:55:13,209
that someone had ever taken my side.

991
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:18,709
Darn it! Hey, what are you doing?

992
00:55:18,792 --> 00:55:20,417
Hey! Answer me!

993
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:21,584
Have you lost your mind?

994
00:55:21,667 --> 00:55:23,500
Are you trying to ruin my business?

995
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:26,250
Starting today, you will work

996
00:55:26,292 --> 00:55:27,792
without pay for three months.

997
00:55:27,876 --> 00:55:28,709
Do you understand?

998
00:55:28,834 --> 00:55:30,084
From morning to evening.

999
00:55:30,209 --> 00:55:31,250
For goodness' sake.

1000
00:55:32,625 --> 00:55:34,084
No, sir. Please.

1001
00:55:34,168 --> 00:55:35,500
I need money.

1002
00:55:35,584 --> 00:55:37,417
You didn't even pay me last month.

1003
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,834
Are you crazy?

1004
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:40,917
Hey, do you know

1005
00:55:41,001 --> 00:55:42,168
how many plates you've broken?

1006
00:55:42,333 --> 00:55:44,625
Clean this up. All of these.

1007
00:55:44,709 --> 00:55:46,126
Clean this up now!

1008
00:55:46,542 --> 00:55:48,126
What are you doing right now?

1009
00:55:49,459 --> 00:55:50,834
Those grills are so heavy.

1010
00:55:51,292 --> 00:55:52,292
Don't you think it's wrong

1011
00:55:52,375 --> 00:55:53,667
to make her carry them?

1012
00:55:54,126 --> 00:55:55,876
This is child abuse.

1013
00:55:56,084 --> 00:55:57,709
I'm going to report you.

1014
00:55:57,792 --> 00:55:58,709
Who are you?

1015
00:55:58,792 --> 00:56:00,209
I'm her mum. Why?

1016
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:01,375
Geez.

1017
00:56:02,168 --> 00:56:03,126
Get up.

1018
00:56:03,209 --> 00:56:05,959
You can make money elsewhere.

1019
00:56:06,042 --> 00:56:07,959
Don't work for this scumbag.

1020
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:09,250
Let's go.

1021
00:56:09,292 --> 00:56:11,209
Hey, lady. Have you lost your mind?

1022
00:56:11,417 --> 00:56:12,667
Stop right there. - Hey!

1023
00:56:13,459 --> 00:56:14,792
Get lost before I call the cops.

1024
00:56:14,876 --> 00:56:16,709
What? Where are you going?

1025
00:56:16,792 --> 00:56:18,209
You'd better clean this up.

1026
00:56:22,333 --> 00:56:24,042
Thank you for walking me home.

1027
00:56:26,126 --> 00:56:28,876
I'm sorry you lost your job because of me.

1028
00:56:29,126 --> 00:56:30,333
It's okay. I'll find something else.

1029
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:40,333
Take this and get something to eat.

1030
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,292
It's okay. I have money.

1031
00:56:42,375 --> 00:56:44,126
I'm giving you this because I feel bad.

1032
00:56:44,917 --> 00:56:46,250
Here, just take it.

1033
00:56:47,375 --> 00:56:48,500
Is this where you live?

1034
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:50,917
I'll call you

1035
00:56:51,168 --> 00:56:53,834
if I hear of a good job.

1036
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:57,750
Bye.

1037
00:57:02,375 --> 00:57:03,876
She was the first person to be nice to me

1038
00:57:03,959 --> 00:57:05,001
and ask nothing in return.

1039
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:08,209
I will never forget her kindness.

1040
00:57:15,209 --> 00:57:18,792
I admit that I thought of harming her.

1041
00:57:19,168 --> 00:57:20,126
However,

1042
00:57:20,542 --> 00:57:21,709
I felt so bad when I saw

1043
00:57:21,792 --> 00:57:23,001
what she was going through.

1044
00:57:23,834 --> 00:57:25,959
So I wanted to help her somehow.

1045
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:28,001
I wanted to help her find a job.

1046
00:57:28,292 --> 00:57:29,500
Why would you do that

1047
00:57:29,584 --> 00:57:31,168
when you weren't even her guardian?

1048
00:57:31,834 --> 00:57:33,084
Weren't you planning

1049
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:36,876
to cut a deal with her

1050
00:57:36,959 --> 00:57:38,917
in return for giving up her admission?

1051
00:57:39,917 --> 00:57:41,168
I told you that is not true!

1052
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:42,292
Hey, calm down.

1053
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:44,084
Don't get all worked up. Calm down.

1054
00:57:45,709 --> 00:57:46,709
All right.

1055
00:57:47,876 --> 00:57:49,001
Then,

1056
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:50,750
let's now go back

1057
00:57:51,667 --> 00:57:53,500
to the night

1058
00:57:53,834 --> 00:57:57,417
of Min Seol A's death.

1059
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:01,500
Ms Oh.

1060
00:58:02,126 --> 00:58:03,084
Where were you

1061
00:58:03,542 --> 00:58:04,792
and what were you doing that day?

1062
00:58:06,876 --> 00:58:08,042
That day...

1063
00:58:13,250 --> 00:58:14,625
Okay, you drank.

1064
00:58:15,667 --> 00:58:17,375
What did you do after that?

1065
00:58:19,168 --> 00:58:22,500
After-- After that...

1066
00:58:26,417 --> 00:58:27,709
I don't remember.

1067
00:58:27,792 --> 00:58:30,584
She just said that she doesn't remember.

1068
00:58:31,042 --> 00:58:32,168
That means

1069
00:58:32,542 --> 00:58:34,792
you have no recollection

1070
00:58:34,876 --> 00:58:36,876
of what you did that night.

1071
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:39,500
In other words,

1072
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:42,417
you have no alibi.

1073
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:43,959
My gosh.

1074
00:58:53,168 --> 00:58:56,250
What is that wound on your hand?

1075
00:59:01,042 --> 00:59:03,792
Do you not remember how you got it?

1076
00:59:06,333 --> 00:59:07,417
It looks like

1077
00:59:08,459 --> 00:59:10,542
our work here is done.

1078
00:59:11,168 --> 00:59:12,292
Let's call the police.

1079
00:59:12,876 --> 00:59:13,917
Mr Headmaster.

1080
00:59:14,375 --> 00:59:16,042
Please put Bae Ro Na's admission on hold

1081
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:18,667
until we find out what really happened.

1082
00:59:19,168 --> 00:59:21,042
If not, all of us

1083
00:59:21,126 --> 00:59:23,042
will refuse to send our children here.

1084
00:59:23,292 --> 00:59:24,333
All right.

1085
00:59:24,667 --> 00:59:26,250
Then we'll decide by a show of hands.

1086
00:59:27,209 --> 00:59:28,417
If you think Bae Ro Na

1087
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:29,709
shouldn't be admitted,

1088
00:59:30,417 --> 00:59:32,209
please raise your hand.

1089
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:47,417
Now, please make your decision.

1090
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:50,417
Why are you all doing this to me?

1091
00:59:52,292 --> 00:59:53,750
I really

1092
00:59:54,209 --> 00:59:55,792
didn't do anything to that girl.

1093
00:59:56,459 --> 00:59:58,667
I'm telling you the truth. Believe me!

1094
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:06,292
Following the parents' opinions,

1095
01:00:08,417 --> 01:00:09,584
I, as the chief director's

1096
01:00:09,667 --> 01:00:10,750
representative,

1097
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:13,001
shall suspend Bae Ro Na's admission--

1098
01:00:13,084 --> 01:00:14,375
Wait.

1099
01:00:23,209 --> 01:00:24,709
I know Ms Oh's whereabouts

1100
01:00:25,333 --> 01:00:26,542
that night.

1101
01:00:27,042 --> 01:00:28,042
What?

1102
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:30,250
Dr Ha. Hey!

1103
01:00:31,834 --> 01:00:32,876
That night,

1104
01:00:33,459 --> 01:00:34,959
she was with me

1105
01:00:35,042 --> 01:00:36,250
at Hera Palace.

1106
01:00:38,792 --> 01:00:39,834
What?

1107
01:01:10,851 --> 01:01:11,851
Darn it.

1108
01:01:17,834 --> 01:01:19,042
Get up.

1109
01:01:20,042 --> 01:01:21,042
Gosh.

1110
01:01:22,959 --> 01:01:24,209
Come here.

1111
01:01:27,042 --> 01:01:28,250
Let go!

1112
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:30,333
Gosh! - Goodness.

1113
01:01:30,417 --> 01:01:31,834
Let go of me!

1114
01:01:33,292 --> 01:01:34,500
What are you doing here?

1115
01:01:34,667 --> 01:01:35,876
Ha Yoon Chul?

1116
01:01:37,444 --> 01:01:38,653
You little...

1117
01:01:40,667 --> 01:01:42,709
It is you, Ha Yoon Chul.

1118
01:01:42,876 --> 01:01:43,834
You need to leave.

1119
01:01:43,917 --> 01:01:45,333
Seo Jin will throw a fit if she sees you.

1120
01:01:45,959 --> 01:01:47,792
Are you that scared of your wife?

1121
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:49,959
Are you happy that you dumped me

1122
01:01:50,042 --> 01:01:51,168
for Cheon Seo Jin?

1123
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:52,750
Yes?

1124
01:01:54,168 --> 01:01:56,333
You're just like her.

1125
01:01:56,625 --> 01:01:59,168
You didn't believe me anyway!

1126
01:02:00,917 --> 01:02:01,876
Move.

1127
01:02:01,959 --> 01:02:03,459
Hey, you're too drunk right now.

1128
01:02:03,542 --> 01:02:04,834
Let go!

1129
01:02:07,459 --> 01:02:08,750
Cheon Seo Jin was the beginning

1130
01:02:09,417 --> 01:02:10,625
of my misfortunes.

1131
01:02:11,209 --> 01:02:13,500
I will not let anyone

1132
01:02:14,209 --> 01:02:16,209
ruin my daughter's future.

1133
01:02:17,042 --> 01:02:18,084
So get out of my way!

1134
01:02:18,168 --> 01:02:19,917
Hey! Wait.

1135
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:21,375
Goodness.

1136
01:02:21,834 --> 01:02:24,042
I said, let go!

1137
01:02:24,250 --> 01:02:26,584
Go away! Get lost!

1138
01:02:28,168 --> 01:02:29,584
Hey, Yoon Hee!

1139
01:02:37,667 --> 01:02:38,584
Yoon Hee!

1140
01:02:41,126 --> 01:02:42,001
Hey!

1141
01:02:49,459 --> 01:02:51,417
Yoon Hee, get a grip. You're hurt.

1142
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:53,542
Let go!

1143
01:02:54,126 --> 01:02:55,126
Gosh...

1144
01:02:57,667 --> 01:02:58,959
It was because of this.

1145
01:02:59,292 --> 01:03:02,001
My life was ruined because of this!

1146
01:03:03,667 --> 01:03:05,042
It was all because of this.

1147
01:03:08,542 --> 01:03:09,792
Let me see your hand.

1148
01:03:21,126 --> 01:03:22,459
Do you have proof?

1149
01:03:23,084 --> 01:03:25,542
We can't blindly trust what you're saying.

1150
01:03:25,917 --> 01:03:28,084
You can check the CCTV footage.

1151
01:03:30,792 --> 01:03:32,709
Stop the witch hunt, please.

1152
01:03:33,333 --> 01:03:35,126
Framing an innocent person

1153
01:03:35,375 --> 01:03:37,459
won't do the school any good.

1154
01:03:38,084 --> 01:03:38,959
Min Seol A's death

1155
01:03:39,042 --> 01:03:40,542
has been concluded as suicide.

1156
01:03:41,292 --> 01:03:43,917
Must we create another victim?

1157
01:03:55,250 --> 01:03:56,750
"Emergency Parents' Meeting"

1158
01:04:13,876 --> 01:04:14,959
What are you doing?

1159
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:16,542
Did it break your heart

1160
01:04:16,625 --> 01:04:17,792
to see your first love in trouble?

1161
01:04:17,876 --> 01:04:20,126
Don't you think this is too much?

1162
01:04:20,209 --> 01:04:21,168
Was framing an innocent person

1163
01:04:21,250 --> 01:04:22,168
all you could think of

1164
01:04:22,250 --> 01:04:23,500
with that smart brain of yours?

1165
01:04:23,584 --> 01:04:25,084
She barged into my office

1166
01:04:25,168 --> 01:04:26,375
and caused a scene.

1167
01:04:26,459 --> 01:04:27,542
You call that "innocent"?

1168
01:04:27,709 --> 01:04:30,042
She's still delusional.

1169
01:04:30,126 --> 01:04:31,417
Do you realise that? And what?

1170
01:04:33,584 --> 01:04:34,792
How could you defend her

1171
01:04:34,876 --> 01:04:36,292
when you're my husband?

1172
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:37,542
That's because...

1173
01:04:39,126 --> 01:04:40,792
She was too drunk that night.

1174
01:04:40,876 --> 01:04:42,375
I didn't think you two should meet--

1175
01:04:45,959 --> 01:04:47,168
How dare you.

1176
01:04:47,417 --> 01:04:49,042
Do you think that can be an excuse?

1177
01:04:51,375 --> 01:04:52,500
Is that why?

1178
01:04:54,876 --> 01:04:57,042
Is that why you gave her 100 million won?

1179
01:04:58,709 --> 01:04:59,625
You...

1180
01:05:00,542 --> 01:05:01,709
You knew about it?

1181
01:05:07,209 --> 01:05:08,917
What is going on between you two?

1182
01:05:09,292 --> 01:05:10,917
Have you been seeing her behind my back?

1183
01:05:15,667 --> 01:05:18,250
Are you still not over your first love?

1184
01:05:18,292 --> 01:05:19,792
No! Don't jump to conclusions!

1185
01:05:19,876 --> 01:05:20,959
Then what is it?

1186
01:05:21,834 --> 01:05:23,333
You gave her that much money in secret.

1187
01:05:23,417 --> 01:05:25,250
How am I supposed to interpret that?

1188
01:05:28,375 --> 01:05:30,625
You trampled on my pride,

1189
01:05:32,042 --> 01:05:33,625
and I won't forgive you for it.

1190
01:05:36,834 --> 01:05:38,001
Just wait and see.

1191
01:05:39,542 --> 01:05:41,250
Watch how I handle this.

1192
01:05:53,168 --> 01:05:54,084
My gosh.

1193
01:05:54,168 --> 01:05:55,084
The investors...

1194
01:05:55,168 --> 01:05:56,333
What if this leaves a scar

1195
01:05:56,417 --> 01:05:57,625
on your pretty face?

1196
01:05:57,792 --> 01:05:59,959
Why let someone hit you? Are you a fool?

1197
01:06:00,126 --> 01:06:01,333
I just let her off the hook.

1198
01:06:01,417 --> 01:06:02,709
I could've totally punched her back.

1199
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:04,126
Why let her off the hook?

1200
01:06:04,209 --> 01:06:05,126
I'm so upset.

1201
01:06:05,209 --> 01:06:06,792
What was I supposed to do?

1202
01:06:06,876 --> 01:06:08,250
What if she demands

1203
01:06:08,333 --> 01:06:10,209
compensation like last time?

1204
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:11,333
We're broke.

1205
01:06:11,417 --> 01:06:12,834
We can't afford to move again.

1206
01:06:13,333 --> 01:06:15,084
Je Ni's mum is a lot more vicious.

1207
01:06:15,168 --> 01:06:16,459
We can't handle her.

1208
01:06:16,876 --> 01:06:17,917
So that's...

1209
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:19,750
That's why you didn't hit her back?

1210
01:06:19,834 --> 01:06:20,834
Don't worry.

1211
01:06:22,168 --> 01:06:23,292
It didn't even hurt.

1212
01:06:23,625 --> 01:06:25,667
Her punches don't hurt at all.

1213
01:06:27,917 --> 01:06:29,209
She's so weak.

1214
01:06:30,584 --> 01:06:32,417
Don't look at me like that.

1215
01:06:33,084 --> 01:06:34,084
I'll teach her a lesson

1216
01:06:34,168 --> 01:06:35,500
by outdoing her later on.

1217
01:06:35,584 --> 01:06:39,001
The polarisation is worsening.

1218
01:06:39,417 --> 01:06:40,459
Gosh, I'm so upset.

1219
01:06:41,042 --> 01:06:42,250
Next news.

1220
01:06:42,333 --> 01:06:44,001
Last night, a media outlet reported

1221
01:06:44,026 --> 01:06:45,234
that Cho Sang Heon,

1222
01:06:45,259 --> 01:06:46,464
a two-term assemblyman,

1223
01:06:46,489 --> 01:06:48,684
is having an affair with an actress.

1224
01:06:48,709 --> 01:06:50,625
However, Assemblyman Cho

1225
01:06:50,709 --> 01:06:52,333
claimed that it was fake news

1226
01:06:52,417 --> 01:06:54,084
and made it clear

1227
01:06:54,168 --> 01:06:55,792
that he will press charges against those

1228
01:06:55,876 --> 01:06:57,667
who further spread the rumour.

1229
01:06:57,750 --> 01:06:59,917
Reporter Song has the story.

1230
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:01,750
Yes, Assemblyman Cho

1231
01:07:01,834 --> 01:07:02,876
claims that... - That startled me.

1232
01:07:02,959 --> 01:07:05,292
he and the actress in the rumour

1233
01:07:05,375 --> 01:07:06,667
are mere acquaintances.

1234
01:07:06,692 --> 01:07:07,612
"Assemblyman Cho"

1235
01:07:07,637 --> 01:07:08,767
He also said that he will step down

1236
01:07:08,792 --> 01:07:10,709
from his position if the rumour

1237
01:07:10,734 --> 01:07:12,028
turns out to be true.

1238
01:07:12,917 --> 01:07:14,250
Oh Yoon Hee.

1239
01:07:14,333 --> 01:07:15,500
You did this, didn't you?

1240
01:07:16,001 --> 01:07:16,957
You took my money,

1241
01:07:16,982 --> 01:07:19,229
so you should've kept your mouth shut.

1242
01:07:19,459 --> 01:07:22,168
What are you talking about, sir?

1243
01:07:22,959 --> 01:07:24,042
You spread the rumour!

1244
01:07:24,126 --> 01:07:25,333
Don't play dumb.

1245
01:07:25,417 --> 01:07:26,584
You'd better come here at once

1246
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:28,333
with all the money you took from me.

1247
01:07:28,834 --> 01:07:31,459
If not, I'll destroy your daughter's life!

1248
01:07:32,126 --> 01:07:33,084
Hello?

1249
01:07:33,584 --> 01:07:34,667
Hello?

1250
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:36,126
Hello? Assemblyman Cho!

1251
01:07:36,209 --> 01:07:38,417
Assemblyman Cho also said...

1252
01:07:55,333 --> 01:07:56,333
Sir.

1253
01:07:56,542 --> 01:07:57,625
It's me, Oh Yoon Hee.

1254
01:07:57,709 --> 01:07:58,876
Are you inside?

1255
01:08:03,292 --> 01:08:06,042
Sir, I'm going in.

1256
01:08:08,292 --> 01:08:11,333
Sir, I'm going upstairs.

1257
01:08:12,709 --> 01:08:14,750
Sir, are you not home?

1258
01:08:18,959 --> 01:08:20,168
Assemblyman Cho?

1259
01:08:45,709 --> 01:08:48,750
=Penthouse=

1260
01:08:48,834 --> 01:08:50,584
I know nothing.

1261
01:08:51,417 --> 01:08:52,250
Bite when I tell you to

1262
01:08:52,333 --> 01:08:53,834
like a loyal dog.

1263
01:08:53,917 --> 01:08:55,959
I won't let you have your way.

1264
01:08:56,042 --> 01:08:57,500
You betrayed the woman you loved

1265
01:08:57,584 --> 01:08:59,126
and chose me!

1266
01:08:59,209 --> 01:09:00,834
That means there's a witness.

1267
01:09:00,917 --> 01:09:02,209
There's someone I'm suspicious of.

1268
01:09:02,250 --> 01:09:03,168
Soo Ryeon?

1269
01:09:03,250 --> 01:09:04,542
What if Soo Ryeon saw us?

1270
01:09:04,625 --> 01:09:06,250
I think my husband is on to something.

1271
01:09:06,333 --> 01:09:07,250
When did you start

1272
01:09:07,333 --> 01:09:08,667
doing things behind my back?
