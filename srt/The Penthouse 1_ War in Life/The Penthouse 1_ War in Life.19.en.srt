Gosh. - This is insane!

7
00:00:48,242 --> 00:00:49,302
What is this? Is this gasoline?

8
00:00:49,326 --> 00:00:50,801
What? - Gasoline?

9
00:00:50,825 --> 00:00:52,304
Darn it!

10
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:54,609
No! - My goodness!

11
00:00:55,367 --> 00:00:56,484
What's going on?

12
00:00:56,509 --> 00:00:57,718
What was that?

13
00:00:57,742 --> 00:00:58,843
Stop this! - Open the door!

14
00:00:58,867 --> 00:01:00,676
What the heck are you doing?

15
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,885
There are people here!

16
00:01:01,909 --> 00:01:03,218
Stop this madness now!

17
00:01:03,242 --> 00:01:06,525
Hey, why start a fire? Are you insane?

18
00:01:09,467 --> 00:01:10,901
Why?

19
00:01:10,925 --> 00:01:12,485
Are you afraid you might die?

20
00:01:12,509 --> 00:01:13,694
What?

21
00:01:13,718 --> 00:01:16,251
But you think what your kids did is okay?

22
00:01:16,925 --> 00:01:18,610
They also set the car on fire

23
00:01:18,634 --> 00:01:20,360
and ran away.

24
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,276
What on earth are you talking about?

25
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,000
Explain what's going on!

26
00:01:26,592 --> 00:01:27,527
Min Seol A!

27
00:01:27,551 --> 00:01:28,443
What? - What?

28
00:01:28,467 --> 00:01:30,776
What are you saying? What about her?

29
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,276
That night,

30
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,151
a fire broke out inside the van.

31
00:01:35,175 --> 00:01:36,693
A fire?

32
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,607
Our kids

33
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:41,084
lighted candles on the cake,

34
00:01:42,426 --> 00:01:43,985
and Min Seol A was almost burned to death.

35
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:45,235
That's a lie!

36
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:46,443
That never happened.

37
00:01:46,467 --> 00:01:48,402
Stop making up this nonsense!

38
00:01:48,426 --> 00:01:49,694
It's true!

39
00:01:49,718 --> 00:01:52,500
Je Ni told me everything on that day!

40
00:01:53,092 --> 00:01:54,151
I...

41
00:01:54,175 --> 00:01:56,318
I had no idea!

42
00:01:56,342 --> 00:01:58,568
We really didn't know!

43
00:01:58,592 --> 00:02:01,026
I'm sure the kids got scared and ran off.

44
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:04,026
It was a prank. They just pulled a prank.

45
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,709
A prank?

46
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:09,384
Min Seol A almost died at that time

47
00:02:09,842 --> 00:02:11,985
because of your kids

48
00:02:12,009 --> 00:02:13,193
who locked her up in the burning car

49
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:15,292
and ran off to save their own lives.

50
00:02:15,634 --> 00:02:17,652
Even after all that,

51
00:02:17,676 --> 00:02:20,500
they never apologised for what they did.

52
00:02:20,818 --> 00:02:21,568
"Group chat"

53
00:02:21,593 --> 00:02:23,767
How could you do that?

54
00:02:27,509 --> 00:02:29,527
What, you're alive?

55
00:02:29,551 --> 00:02:31,818
Nice! I knew we were lucky.

56
00:02:31,842 --> 00:02:33,735
Why? Did something happen?

57
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:35,652
I got a good nap and just woke up.

58
00:02:35,676 --> 00:02:37,068
"Min Seol A, Joo Seok Hoon, Yoo Je Ni,"

59

"Joo Seok Kyung, Lee Min Hyuk..."

60
00:02:38,384 --> 00:02:40,667
Do you have any idea what you did?

61
00:02:41,175 --> 00:02:42,610
I almost died

62
00:02:42,634 --> 00:02:44,610
because of all of you.

63
00:02:44,634 --> 00:02:46,625
Because of the fire you started!

64
00:02:48,092 --> 00:02:48,985
What fire?

65
00:02:49,009 --> 00:02:50,402
Ms. Min, do you smoke?

66
00:02:50,426 --> 00:02:52,943
You should quit for your health.

67
00:02:52,967 --> 00:02:54,485
I thought you only liked to drink,

68
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:55,657
but you were a heavy smoker too.

69
00:02:55,682 --> 00:02:56,491
"Lee Min Hyuk: Laughing out loud"

70
00:02:56,516 --> 00:02:57,420

71
00:02:57,445 --> 00:02:58,174
"Ha Eun Byeol: Laughing out loud"

72
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:01,016
"Yoo Je Ni: Laughing out loud"

73
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:14,110
So what?

74
00:03:14,134 --> 00:03:16,776
You're going to do the same to us?

75
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,776
Who are you?

76
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,443
You're Min Seol A's brother, aren't you?

77
00:03:19,467 --> 00:03:20,859
If you don't stop right now,

78
00:03:20,883 --> 00:03:22,776
I'll rip you into pieces!

79
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,376
Sure.

80
00:03:24,967 --> 00:03:26,917
Go ahead and try.

81
00:03:27,676 --> 00:03:29,985
I'm not going to let you live anyway.

82
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:30,943
What? - Please!

83
00:03:30,967 --> 00:03:32,943
Please open the door!

84
00:03:32,967 --> 00:03:34,943
Je Ni, Mummy is going to die here.

85
00:03:34,967 --> 00:03:36,568
Please show us mercy!

86
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:38,068
Please help us!

87
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,750
Hey!

88
00:03:40,134 --> 00:03:41,276
Hey!

89
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,859
Please let us live! - Mum!

90
00:03:42,883 --> 00:03:44,709
Stop it!

91
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:46,859
Stop!

92
00:03:46,883 --> 00:03:48,959
Mum, no!

93
00:03:50,842 --> 00:03:52,875
Mum...

94
00:03:54,718 --> 00:03:57,084
Oh no. - Mum...

95
00:03:58,259 --> 00:03:59,901
Write down everything

96
00:03:59,925 --> 00:04:01,959
each of you did to Min Seol A. 

97
00:04:09,175 --> 00:04:10,568
Move aside.

98
00:04:10,592 --> 00:04:12,735
Hey, what did you do to our kids?

99
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:15,875
I'll kill you if you lay a finger on them!

100
00:04:16,426 --> 00:04:18,610
Of course your kids need

101
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:21,042
some time to look back on themselves,

102
00:04:21,342 --> 00:04:23,292
depending on what each of them did.

103
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,026
Then let me make a deal with you.

104
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:29,485
Confess everything you did to Min Seol A.

105
00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:30,985
Tell me everything that happened

106
00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:32,318
on the night that Min Seol A died,

107
00:04:32,342 --> 00:04:33,985
without leaving out anything!

108
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:35,901
What do you expect us to say?

109
00:04:35,925 --> 00:04:38,459
If you want to live, spill the truth.

110
00:04:38,967 --> 00:04:40,735
Don't you dare say a word.

111
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:41,859
Don't let that jerk fool you.

112
00:04:41,883 --> 00:04:43,318
You psycho.

113
00:04:43,342 --> 00:04:45,193
Do you want all of us to burn to death?

114
00:04:45,217 --> 00:04:46,318
Let me go!

115
00:04:46,342 --> 00:04:47,859
I'll tell you. I'll go first.

116
00:04:47,883 --> 00:04:50,652
I did not do anything!

117
00:04:50,676 --> 00:04:54,735
I found out later Seol A was locked up

118
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:57,360
in the mechanical room of Hera Palace.

119
00:04:57,384 --> 00:04:59,110
Joo Dan Tae and Cheon Seo Jin.

120
00:04:59,134 --> 00:05:00,360
You two locked her up in there.

121
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:01,568
Tell the truth now!

122
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:02,985
It's my fault now?

123
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:04,568
I did everything

124
00:05:04,592 --> 00:05:06,110
for our kids' sake.

125
00:05:06,134 --> 00:05:07,276
Cut your crap.

126
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,443
That's just an excuse.

127
00:05:08,467 --> 00:05:09,652
You were trying to get back

128
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:11,110
the video on your affair she had!

129
00:05:11,134 --> 00:05:12,276
I told you to shut up!

130
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,485
You! Darn it.

131
00:05:14,509 --> 00:05:17,193
Our fate and our kids' fate are at stake.

132
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:19,110
Why are you playing the boss right now?

133
00:05:19,134 --> 00:05:20,834
Darn it. - Stop!

134
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:22,610
No! - Come here!

135
00:05:22,634 --> 00:05:23,901
Darn you! - Shut that mouth!

136
00:05:23,925 --> 00:05:25,151
You! - Stop it!

137
00:05:25,175 --> 00:05:26,527
Goodness, you idiots. - You jerk.

138
00:05:26,551 --> 00:05:27,818
I let you off because you're old.

139
00:05:27,842 --> 00:05:28,901
What did you say, you jerk?

140
00:05:28,925 --> 00:05:31,000
What if the bomb goes off?

141
00:05:31,092 --> 00:05:32,402
Stop it! - You jerk!

142
00:05:32,426 --> 00:05:34,792
We don't have much time left!

143
00:05:34,842 --> 00:05:36,750
Five minutes to go.

144
00:05:38,092 --> 00:05:39,859
I'll let go of the people

145
00:05:39,883 --> 00:05:42,418
who make the sincerest confession

146
00:05:43,175 --> 00:05:45,084
along with their kids.

147
00:05:47,217 --> 00:05:49,875
So you don't mind if you die?

148
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:52,193
As you wish, then.

149
00:05:52,217 --> 00:05:53,985
No! Please, no.

150
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:56,276
I'll go. I'll tell you. I'll go first.

151
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,084
All I did that night was

152
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:02,000
clean up the blood from the fountain.

153
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,402
Me too.

154
00:06:05,426 --> 00:06:08,235
Ma Ri told me to clean up the blood,

155
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:10,026
so that's all I did!

156
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:10,985
Cut it out!

157
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:12,151
This is a trap.

158
00:06:12,175 --> 00:06:13,235
That jerk is putting on a show

159
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:14,193
for the evidence!

160
00:06:14,217 --> 00:06:15,527
You.

161
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,360
You need to keep that mouth shut.

162
00:06:17,384 --> 00:06:19,610
Feel free to die here by yourself.

163
00:06:19,634 --> 00:06:21,276
I can't die here.

164
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,026
It was him. Joo Dan Tae

165
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,610
suggested that we get rid of her body.

166
00:06:25,634 --> 00:06:27,151
I seriously

167
00:06:27,175 --> 00:06:29,485
just did as he told me.

168
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:30,443
That crazy idiot.

169
00:06:30,467 --> 00:06:33,026
Stop that nonsense, Kyu Jin. You scumbag!

170
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,193
The golf bag.

171
00:06:34,217 --> 00:06:35,443
You're the one who brought the golf bag

172
00:06:35,467 --> 00:06:37,276
to move her body from there!

173
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,859
And we put that golf bag in your car

174
00:06:39,883 --> 00:06:41,276
and made a move.

175
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,859
Then your ex-wife, this one.

176
00:06:42,883 --> 00:06:43,818
"This one"?

177
00:06:43,842 --> 00:06:45,694
This brat fabricated her will!

178
00:06:45,718 --> 00:06:46,652
"This brat"?

179
00:06:46,676 --> 00:06:48,360
You two

180
00:06:48,384 --> 00:06:50,652
turned this into a suicide case!

181
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:52,901
And Dan Tae, you scumbag.

182
00:06:52,925 --> 00:06:54,776
You set up the whole thing so that

183
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,402
it looked like she fell at Bosong Village!

184
00:06:56,426 --> 00:06:57,568
You scum of the earth! - Shut your mouth!

185
00:06:57,592 --> 00:06:58,610
You jerk! - Will you stop that?

186
00:06:58,634 --> 00:06:59,568
Stop it! - That's enough!

187
00:06:59,592 --> 00:07:00,776
You need to stop! - Stop it!

188
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,776
Stop it!

189
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,901
You can kill yourself! - All of you!

190
00:07:02,925 --> 00:07:04,568
You! - Don't let that thing get to you!

191
00:07:04,592 --> 00:07:05,610
Will you stop? - Don't say a word!

192
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:06,610
Please, stop. - Shut up!

193
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,418
No, please.

194
00:07:08,634 --> 00:07:09,776
You two.

195
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,985
If only she didn't catch your affair,

196
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:14,026
this wouldn't have happened.

197
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,610
All of our kids are about to die

198
00:07:15,634 --> 00:07:18,376
because of you two.

199
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:20,735
If anything bad happens to Je Ni,

200
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:23,901
I'll rip you into pieces. Get it?

201
00:07:23,925 --> 00:07:25,583
Get off me!

202
00:07:25,676 --> 00:07:27,776
Hey, tell her.

203
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,026
Tell her that you killed Min Seol A!

204
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:33,026
You've brought this upon everyone!

205
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,985
Why would I kill her?

206
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:36,776
Then was it you, Seo Jin?

207
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,151
I never did that!

208
00:07:38,175 --> 00:07:41,583
Then who killed that girl?

209
00:07:41,634 --> 00:07:45,276
Our kids are all going to die!

210
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,042
Please.

211
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:51,376
Please let my daughter live.

212
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,402
She's the girl in a white dress,

213
00:07:54,426 --> 00:07:56,943
the prettiest girl.

214
00:07:56,967 --> 00:07:59,026
If you let her live,

215
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:02,443
I'll give you my entire fortune.

216
00:08:02,467 --> 00:08:05,068
You can have my house, my building,

217
00:08:05,092 --> 00:08:07,151
and everything else.

218
00:08:07,175 --> 00:08:11,084
So please let Je Ni live.

219
00:08:11,134 --> 00:08:12,360
Min Hyuk.

220
00:08:12,384 --> 00:08:14,193
Min Hyuk, no.

221
00:08:14,217 --> 00:08:16,110
Min Hyuk!

222
00:08:16,134 --> 00:08:17,859
Actually,

223
00:08:17,883 --> 00:08:20,985
my mum is very ill.

224
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:23,443
She only has two months to live.

225
00:08:23,467 --> 00:08:24,985
Please

226
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:26,694
let me live for two more months

227
00:08:26,718 --> 00:08:28,901
and die with my mum.

228
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,776
Stop making things up!

229
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,818
No, please! - You scumbag!

230
00:08:31,842 --> 00:08:33,151
Darn it, you idiot.

231
00:08:33,175 --> 00:08:34,193
Let me go! - You.

232
00:08:34,217 --> 00:08:35,568
You! - Let me go.

233
00:08:35,592 --> 00:08:36,735
Let me go, you jerk!

234
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:38,276
Let my kid live! - Come here!

235
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,251
What are you talking about?

236
00:08:43,551 --> 00:08:45,110
What was that? - What?

237
00:08:45,134 --> 00:08:46,068
What happened?

238
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:47,610
It blew up. - What did?

239
00:08:47,634 --> 00:08:49,251
It just blew up.

240
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,959
What just happened?

241
00:08:54,092 --> 00:08:55,360
Over there.

242
00:08:55,384 --> 00:08:58,110
There... There's someone over there.

243
00:08:58,134 --> 00:08:59,485
Who? - Goodness.

244
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:01,126
Who is that?

245
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:27,376
Soo Ryeon?

246
00:09:28,426 --> 00:09:30,209
Sim Soo Ryeon!

247
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,750
If your kids are that precious to you,

248
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:39,402
how could you do that to Seol A?

249
00:09:39,426 --> 00:09:42,026
What does that have to do with you?

250
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,333
Wait.

251
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:44,985
Did you

252
00:09:45,009 --> 00:09:46,776
plan all this?

253
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,610
What? - Soo Ryeon.

254
00:09:48,634 --> 00:09:51,959
That woman must be out of her mind.

255
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,583
Min Seol A is my daughter!

256
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,292
What? - What?

257
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,527
My poor daughter was taken away

258
00:10:09,551 --> 00:10:11,917
and abandoned without my knowledge.

259
00:10:13,009 --> 00:10:14,735
She never got to hold my hand

260
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:16,527
or call me her mum

261
00:10:16,551 --> 00:10:18,625
and she died an unfair death!

262
00:10:20,134 --> 00:10:22,334
Min Seol A,

263
00:10:22,509 --> 00:10:23,943
that girl you treated with contempt

264
00:10:23,967 --> 00:10:26,418
and trampled all over,

265
00:10:27,384 --> 00:10:29,167
is my daughter.

266
00:10:29,342 --> 00:10:30,235
What is this nonsense?

267
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:33,193
I knew it!

268
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:35,776
You. What did you do to Eun Byeol?

269
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,334
You need to quit this nonsense right now!

270
00:10:39,551 --> 00:10:41,209
Soo Ryeon.

271
00:10:41,342 --> 00:10:43,443
Let's calm down, okay?

272
00:10:43,467 --> 00:10:46,443
Let's take a big breath.

273
00:10:46,467 --> 00:10:47,652
I mean,

274
00:10:47,676 --> 00:10:49,151
it's not like you'll really kill

275
00:10:49,175 --> 00:10:51,193
everyone who's here.

276
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:53,818
Let me apologise on behalf of everyone

277
00:10:53,842 --> 00:10:55,667
who's on this bus.

278
00:10:56,092 --> 00:10:57,568
Me too. - I'm sorry!

279
00:10:57,592 --> 00:10:58,985
Soo Ryeon. - Say it.

280
00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:00,652
Me too. I'm sorry too.

281
00:11:00,676 --> 00:11:02,110
You heard that? - Sorry.

282
00:11:02,134 --> 00:11:03,652
I'm sorry.

283
00:11:03,676 --> 00:11:04,610
Sorry!

284
00:11:04,634 --> 00:11:05,818
I apologise!

285
00:11:05,842 --> 00:11:06,859
I'm sorry!

286
00:11:06,883 --> 00:11:07,985
I was wrong. - I'm sorry.

287
00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:08,901
Sorry! - I apologise.

288
00:11:08,925 --> 00:11:09,943
Sorry! - I don't need

289
00:11:09,967 --> 00:11:11,276
your insincere apology!

290
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,776
You crazy wench!

291
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,418
Shut up!

292
00:11:14,551 --> 00:11:16,068
You're only paying the price

293
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,000
for your wrongdoings.

294
00:11:18,092 --> 00:11:19,901
Watch and see

295
00:11:19,925 --> 00:11:21,318
how you have turned

296
00:11:21,342 --> 00:11:24,084
your children into monsters.

297
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,167
Darn it. - I'll kill her.

298
00:11:36,384 --> 00:11:38,126
She's gone. Where is she?

299
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,527
Where did she go? - Sim Soo Ryeon!

300
00:11:40,551 --> 00:11:41,443
Open the door!

301
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:42,443
Open this door before you go!

302
00:11:42,467 --> 00:11:43,443
Open it!

303
00:11:43,467 --> 00:11:44,568
Open this door!

304
00:11:44,592 --> 00:11:45,776
Open the door!

305
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,443
Sim Soo Ryeon! - What are we going to do?

306
00:11:47,467 --> 00:11:48,859
Sim Soo Ryeon!

307
00:11:48,883 --> 00:11:50,776
No! - It's about to blow up!

308
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,443
Hey! Open up!

309
00:11:52,467 --> 00:11:53,859
No! - Break the window!

310
00:11:53,883 --> 00:11:55,625
Oh no.

311
00:12:02,551 --> 00:12:04,251
My goodness, no.

312
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:07,583
No, please!

313
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:14,667
What was that?

314
00:12:21,464 --> 00:12:22,849
"Door open"

315
00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:35,959
No! Darn it!

316
00:12:43,004 --> 00:12:44,822
My gosh.

317
00:12:49,426 --> 00:12:50,652
Wait!

318
00:12:50,676 --> 00:12:52,360
Wait for me! Wait!

319
00:12:52,384 --> 00:12:54,690
Don't leave me behind!

320
00:12:54,715 --> 00:12:55,694
"Written Testimony"

321
00:12:55,718 --> 00:12:57,143
"Joo Seok Kyung: I stole her key ring..."

322
00:13:10,217 --> 00:13:11,276
What is this? - Whoa.

323
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,360
What's this? - What is this mess?

324
00:13:12,384 --> 00:13:13,360
Wait, what is this?

325
00:13:13,384 --> 00:13:15,360
It's wastewater full of faeces!

326
00:13:15,384 --> 00:13:16,402
Find another path.

327
00:13:16,426 --> 00:13:17,443
There is none!

328
00:13:17,467 --> 00:13:19,376
Darn it! - What do we do?

329
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,042
What are we going to do?

330
00:13:22,342 --> 00:13:23,532
Darn it.

331
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:27,875
Darn it! - Wait for me!

332
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,359
What is this now?

333
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:39,042
Darn it.

334
00:13:40,718 --> 00:13:42,709
You all need to listen up.

335
00:13:43,384 --> 00:13:44,859
Min Seol A

336
00:13:44,883 --> 00:13:47,750
never came to Hera Palace at this hour.

337
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,694
I'm saying Min Seol A

338
00:13:49,718 --> 00:13:52,042
didn't fall down and die right here.

339
00:13:55,384 --> 00:13:57,792
Is this big enough?

340
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,151
That's Min Seol A's bag.

341
00:14:05,175 --> 00:14:06,568
I wrote down her suicide note.

342
00:14:06,592 --> 00:14:08,334
You can put it there with her.

343
00:14:10,384 --> 00:14:12,485
You have to wrap up

344
00:14:12,509 --> 00:14:14,583
within five minutes.

345
00:14:21,342 --> 00:14:23,042
I'll do it.

346
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:31,500
And now, all the evidence

347
00:14:32,509 --> 00:14:34,625
will burn away.

348
00:14:35,925 --> 00:14:37,402
Even after her death,

349
00:14:37,426 --> 00:14:38,859
we all enjoyed the party

350
00:14:38,883 --> 00:14:40,360
as if nothing had happened.

351
00:14:40,384 --> 00:14:43,959
It was the most marvellous party.

352
00:14:48,426 --> 00:14:50,818
You'll never see a party like that

353
00:14:50,842 --> 00:14:53,459
even in my next life.

354
00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:55,859
The lights from the fountain were

355
00:14:55,883 --> 00:14:58,709
absolutely stunning.

356
00:15:02,384 --> 00:15:03,485
Eun Byeol.

357
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:04,485
Eun Byeol! - Min Hyuk!

358
00:15:04,509 --> 00:15:06,193
Mum! - Dad!

359
00:15:06,217 --> 00:15:07,610
Min Hyuk! - Mum!

360
00:15:07,634 --> 00:15:09,568
Come here! - Je Ni!

361
00:15:09,592 --> 00:15:11,402
Dad!

362
00:15:11,426 --> 00:15:12,901
Je Ni.

363
00:15:12,925 --> 00:15:14,068
Are you okay? - Mum!

364
00:15:14,092 --> 00:15:15,110
I'm fine. - Mum...

365
00:15:15,134 --> 00:15:16,917
Come here.

366
00:15:16,967 --> 00:15:18,026
Goodness, Eun Byeol. - Je Ni.

367
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,360
Mum... - Are you all right?

368
00:15:19,384 --> 00:15:21,251
Halt!

369
00:15:22,718 --> 00:15:23,830
What?

370
00:15:24,467 --> 00:15:26,402
Gu Ho Dong. - Gu Ho Dong?

371
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,568
What do you think you're doing?

372
00:15:28,592 --> 00:15:30,318
Stop this nonsense right now!

373
00:15:30,342 --> 00:15:31,818
I'll give you all the money you want.

374
00:15:31,842 --> 00:15:33,110
You need to stop this now!

375
00:15:33,134 --> 00:15:34,875
Money?

376
00:15:35,967 --> 00:15:37,750
What's your offer?

377
00:15:38,134 --> 00:15:40,068
Is that enough to bring my sister back?

378
00:15:40,092 --> 00:15:41,709
You were really

379
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,276
Min Seol A's older brother?

380
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,418
Older brother? - He is?

381
00:15:46,509 --> 00:15:48,610
I always knew you were suspicious.

382
00:15:48,634 --> 00:15:50,527
You were Min Seol A's brother?

383
00:15:50,551 --> 00:15:52,360
You locked up and threatened my kid

384
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:53,859
to get her revenge?

385
00:15:53,883 --> 00:15:55,360
How do you call yourself a teacher?

386
00:15:55,384 --> 00:15:57,276
This is nothing compared to what you did

387
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,500
to poor Seol A.

388
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:02,901
Your children are all alive and well.

389
00:16:02,925 --> 00:16:04,542
Don't forget.

390
00:16:04,634 --> 00:16:05,818
All of you

391
00:16:05,842 --> 00:16:07,917
brought everything upon yourselves.

392
00:16:08,883 --> 00:16:10,068
I'll make sure I hand over

393
00:16:10,092 --> 00:16:11,792
your children's written apology

394
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,360
to the police.

395
00:16:14,384 --> 00:16:15,859
You scumbag!

396
00:16:15,883 --> 00:16:17,235
No! - Stop!

397
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:18,568
Stop it! - Don't do that!

398
00:16:18,592 --> 00:16:19,735
That's enough!

399
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:20,735
Stop it.

400
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:22,418
Gu Ho Dong! - Gu Ho Dong!

401
00:16:23,217 --> 00:16:24,875
You!

402
00:16:26,551 --> 00:16:27,652
I'll make sure I bring you down

403
00:16:27,676 --> 00:16:29,459
and kill you with my own hands.

404
00:16:29,718 --> 00:16:31,418
That scumbag.

405
00:16:31,925 --> 00:16:33,542
You need to stop.

406
00:16:36,274 --> 00:16:38,710
I understand, Mr. Chairman.

407
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,363
Who just called?

408
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,126
It's nothing.

409
00:16:43,883 --> 00:16:45,443
Hey, Ms. Sim.

410
00:16:45,467 --> 00:16:46,402
You're finally here.

411
00:16:46,426 --> 00:16:48,209
I've been waiting for you.

412
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,276
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

413
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,151
I packed up your stuff for you.

414
00:16:54,175 --> 00:16:55,859
That's why I came to pick it up.

415
00:16:55,883 --> 00:16:58,376
And I wanted to see Ro Na too.

416
00:17:11,551 --> 00:17:14,959
Soo Ryeon is at my place right now.

417
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:17,402
Ro Na is practising hard.

418
00:17:17,426 --> 00:17:20,026
What? Oh, yes.

419
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:22,568
She met Grace Joe today.

420
00:17:22,592 --> 00:17:24,527
She's totally motivated.

421
00:17:24,551 --> 00:17:26,376
Coffee is ready.

422
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,500
What do you mean?

423
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:35,443
Everything is over?

424
00:17:35,467 --> 00:17:36,985
The kids at Hera Palace confessed

425
00:17:37,009 --> 00:17:39,610
that they've been bullying Seol A.

426
00:17:39,634 --> 00:17:41,485
And their parents admitted

427
00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:43,068
they threw away her body

428
00:17:43,092 --> 00:17:46,583
and forged the cause of her death.

429
00:17:48,384 --> 00:17:50,500
Then did Joo Dan Tae

430
00:17:50,925 --> 00:17:52,610
admit to everything he did?

431
00:17:52,634 --> 00:17:54,235
Of course.

432
00:17:54,259 --> 00:17:56,151
He's done the worst.

433
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:57,568
He threw away her body,

434
00:17:57,592 --> 00:17:59,527
destroyed evidence, committed arson,

435
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:02,084
and even defamed her reputation.

436
00:18:03,509 --> 00:18:05,418
What about Seo Jin?

437
00:18:06,217 --> 00:18:08,527
Did she admit that she killed

438
00:18:08,551 --> 00:18:10,334
Seol A?

439
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:13,583
No.

440
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:15,776
She kept insisting that she didn't?

441
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,959
Even after you said that you saw her?

442
00:18:18,925 --> 00:18:20,776
You said you saw the ruby ring

443
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,875
on her hand.

444
00:18:23,175 --> 00:18:24,917
That Seo Jin

445
00:18:25,551 --> 00:18:28,500
pushed Seol A off.

446
00:18:29,634 --> 00:18:31,625
It wasn't her.

447
00:18:32,467 --> 00:18:34,126
What?

448
00:18:35,426 --> 00:18:37,126
My daughter,

449
00:18:37,509 --> 00:18:40,209
Seol A, wasn't pushed off

450
00:18:41,467 --> 00:18:43,418
by Seo Jin.

451
00:18:45,676 --> 00:18:47,251
Really?

452
00:18:48,175 --> 00:18:49,834
Then

453
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:52,542
who's the real culprit?

454
00:18:57,634 --> 00:18:59,292
It's you.

455
00:19:00,384 --> 00:19:02,167
You killed my daughter.

456
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:09,418
Why did you...

457
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,459
kill Seol A?

458
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:29,292
Are you all right? Did you get scalded?

459
00:19:33,092 --> 00:19:34,959
What are you talking about?

460
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:36,901
What are you talking about?

461
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,110
Do you remember the day

462
00:19:38,134 --> 00:19:40,167
when I called you out to the 47th floor?

463
00:19:41,092 --> 00:19:43,542
The day I told you Seol A was my daughter.

464
00:19:48,134 --> 00:19:50,126
I saw the person

465
00:19:50,509 --> 00:19:52,235
who pushed Seol A off.

466
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:53,875
And who...

467
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:55,776
is that?

468
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,209
She has a ruby ring on her hand.

469
00:19:59,384 --> 00:20:01,418
A red ruby ring.

470
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,542
Is something going on?

471
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,500
I'm fine.

472
00:20:11,551 --> 00:20:13,418
I'll call you later.

473
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:20,000
I found it strange from the moment

474
00:20:20,384 --> 00:20:22,834
you disappeared without a word.

475
00:20:24,009 --> 00:20:26,000
But that night,

476
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:28,292
Ro Na called.

477
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,583
Ro Na, it's late. Is something wrong?

478
00:20:34,551 --> 00:20:36,251
The police station?

479
00:20:37,426 --> 00:20:38,985
She was at the police station,

480
00:20:39,009 --> 00:20:41,625
and she said you won't pick up the phone.

481
00:20:44,979 --> 00:20:46,003
"Pull the handle"

482
00:20:46,342 --> 00:20:47,527
I thought you might have fallen asleep,

483
00:20:47,551 --> 00:20:49,875
so I let myself in to wake you up.

484
00:20:51,217 --> 00:20:53,000
Yoon Hee.

485
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:11,251
This is Seol A's necklace.

486
00:21:11,718 --> 00:21:13,818
I couldn't think of any reason

487
00:21:13,842 --> 00:21:15,652
why you had her necklace

488
00:21:15,676 --> 00:21:17,667
no matter how much I thought about it.

489
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:20,985
Why are you so surprised?

490
00:21:21,009 --> 00:21:22,901
So I went to see you to ask.

491
00:21:22,925 --> 00:21:24,193
I wanted to check with you.

492
00:21:24,217 --> 00:21:25,834
But...

493
00:21:26,509 --> 00:21:27,859
My revenge?

494
00:21:27,883 --> 00:21:29,276
You're trying to get what you want

495
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,735
without getting any blood on your hands.

496
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:33,402
Why did you shake my life around,

497
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:34,610
send me to Bosong Village,

498
00:21:34,634 --> 00:21:36,276
and get me involved with Min Seol A?

499
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,402
I need you to testify.

500
00:21:38,426 --> 00:21:39,527
Please go to the police

501
00:21:39,551 --> 00:21:41,542
and tell them as much as you know.

502
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:43,110
The police?

503
00:21:43,134 --> 00:21:44,068
Me?

504
00:21:44,092 --> 00:21:45,818
My poor girl who died a miserable death

505
00:21:45,842 --> 00:21:47,875
is in here.

506
00:21:48,925 --> 00:21:50,875
Stop talking about Seol A.

507
00:21:51,676 --> 00:21:53,334
I have to go.

508
00:21:53,509 --> 00:21:55,875
You weren't the same person that I knew.

509
00:21:57,175 --> 00:21:59,068
You seemed very unstable,

510
00:21:59,092 --> 00:22:01,735
as if you were keeping a huge secret.

511
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:03,193
That's why

512
00:22:03,217 --> 00:22:05,459
I followed you.

513
00:22:17,384 --> 00:22:18,485
I couldn't wrap my head around it

514
00:22:18,509 --> 00:22:20,318
no matter how much I tried to understand.

515
00:22:20,342 --> 00:22:21,610
Why did you try to destroy

516
00:22:21,634 --> 00:22:23,360
Seol A's necklace in that moment?

517
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:25,042
It was as if...

518
00:22:26,342 --> 00:22:27,443
you were trying to deny

519
00:22:27,467 --> 00:22:29,542
everything that happened on that day.

520
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:34,193
What kind of nonsense is this?

521
00:22:34,217 --> 00:22:35,402
Have you gone insane?

522
00:22:35,426 --> 00:22:37,776
Did you go crazy because of the dead girl?

523
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,928
How could I...

524
00:22:40,009 --> 00:22:42,750
I know it was unfair and you're furious,

525
00:22:43,217 --> 00:22:44,610
but stop blaming the innocent.

526
00:22:44,634 --> 00:22:47,167
Then why did you destroy her necklace?

527
00:22:47,217 --> 00:22:48,901
Why did you have that with you?

528
00:22:48,925 --> 00:22:51,542
I got that from her as a present.

529
00:22:51,592 --> 00:22:53,360
She thanked me for helping her.

530
00:22:53,384 --> 00:22:54,818
But you suddenly said

531
00:22:54,842 --> 00:22:56,943
she's your daughter.

532
00:22:56,967 --> 00:22:58,834
I didn't want you to misunderstand.

533
00:22:59,259 --> 00:23:00,652
That's why I just threw it away.

534
00:23:00,676 --> 00:23:01,943
That's all.

535
00:23:01,967 --> 00:23:03,583
No.

536
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,652
You were wasted that night,

537
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:07,443
so that's why you don't remember.

538
00:23:07,467 --> 00:23:09,776
Then you remembered after what I told you.

539
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,818
That's why you burned up

540
00:23:10,842 --> 00:23:12,068
that outfit and the necklace

541
00:23:12,092 --> 00:23:13,276
to destroy the evidence!

542
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,276
Is that wrong?

543
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,694
Soo Ryeon!

544
00:23:15,718 --> 00:23:17,901
Why do you do this to me?

545
00:23:17,925 --> 00:23:19,735
I didn't do that.

546
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:21,818
It really wasn't me!

547
00:23:21,842 --> 00:23:23,583
Lower your voice.

548
00:23:24,426 --> 00:23:26,500
What if Ro Na hears you?

549
00:23:28,009 --> 00:23:29,568
Mum.

550
00:23:29,592 --> 00:23:30,901
What's wrong?

551
00:23:30,925 --> 00:23:33,167
Did you get into a fight with Ms. Sim?

552
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,360
No, it's not like that.

553
00:23:36,384 --> 00:23:38,209
Can you pick up some juice?

554
00:23:38,509 --> 00:23:39,735
There's some in the fridge.

555
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:41,959
Just go get some, will you?

556
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,443
Do you have evidence?

557
00:23:56,467 --> 00:23:58,709
Not just a speculation, but hard evidence.

558
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,068
Do you have clear proof

559
00:24:00,092 --> 00:24:01,527
that I killed your daughter?

560
00:24:01,551 --> 00:24:02,694
If you don't have anything,

561
00:24:02,718 --> 00:24:05,251
get out of my house before I drag you out.

562
00:24:06,676 --> 00:24:08,251
Everything is over

563
00:24:09,925 --> 00:24:11,625
between us.

564
00:24:14,676 --> 00:24:16,583
After Seol A died,

565
00:24:18,259 --> 00:24:20,209
I did an autopsy on her.

566
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,026
I found DNAs of all kinds of people

567
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:26,709
on that little girl's body.

568
00:24:27,384 --> 00:24:28,735
Of course I found the DNAs

569
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:30,276
for Dan Tae and Seo Jin.

570
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,500
But there was

571
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:35,459
this unknown DNA I couldn't identify.

572
00:24:35,842 --> 00:24:38,042
One last DNA left on her fingernails

573
00:24:38,175 --> 00:24:40,276
as she struggled

574
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,209
and put up a fight.

575
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:46,485
That's why

576
00:24:46,509 --> 00:24:49,084
I put off handing this over to the police.

577
00:24:51,134 --> 00:24:52,985
The DNA of the key suspect

578
00:24:53,009 --> 00:24:54,818
does not match with anyone

579
00:24:54,842 --> 00:24:56,527
who lives in Hera Palace.

580
00:24:56,551 --> 00:24:58,126
Does this mean

581
00:24:58,217 --> 00:25:00,360
it's impossible to find the culprit?

582
00:25:00,384 --> 00:25:02,193
But if the culprit's DNA is

583
00:25:02,217 --> 00:25:04,235
left on her fingernails,

584
00:25:04,259 --> 00:25:05,901
I'm sure the culprit

585
00:25:05,925 --> 00:25:08,292
got wounded too.

586
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:10,251
I wanted to know

587
00:25:11,217 --> 00:25:13,026
who was there

588
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:15,251
when Seol A took her last breath.

589
00:25:17,134 --> 00:25:19,875
And I wanted to check just in case.

590
00:25:33,509 --> 00:25:35,209
Oh Yoon Hee.

591
00:25:37,842 --> 00:25:39,500
It was you.

592
00:25:49,808 --> 00:25:51,550
"DNA Analysis Report"

593
00:25:54,009 --> 00:25:55,652
"Sample 1 and sample 2 are"

594
00:25:55,676 --> 00:25:57,360
"exactly the same person's DNA"

595
00:25:57,384 --> 00:25:59,380
"Sample 1 and 2 are from the same person"

596
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:03,331
"DNA Analysis Report"

597
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,959
Do you remember?

598
00:26:06,009 --> 00:26:07,959
When we had the emergency parents' meeting

599
00:26:08,217 --> 00:26:09,402
at Cheonga Arts High School

600
00:26:09,426 --> 00:26:11,209
after Seol A died.

601
00:26:12,009 --> 00:26:13,943
Okay, you drank.

602
00:26:13,967 --> 00:26:16,209
What did you do after that?

603
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:18,859
I don't remember.

604
00:26:18,883 --> 00:26:21,776
She just said that she doesn't remember.

605
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:25,251
What is that wound on your hand?

606
00:26:27,676 --> 00:26:31,126
Do you not remember how you got it?

607
00:26:31,467 --> 00:26:34,376
All the puzzle pieces came together.

608
00:26:34,883 --> 00:26:36,917
The wounds on your hand.

609
00:26:37,259 --> 00:26:39,084
That's the evidence.

610
00:26:40,426 --> 00:26:41,901
What I saw

611
00:26:41,925 --> 00:26:43,943
wasn't Seo Jin's ruby ring.

612
00:26:43,967 --> 00:26:44,901
It was Seol A's necklace

613
00:26:44,925 --> 00:26:46,318
that you pulled off of her neck.

614
00:26:46,342 --> 00:26:48,859
You pushed her off and killed her!

615
00:26:48,883 --> 00:26:50,255
No!

616
00:26:51,842 --> 00:26:52,776
No.

617
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,583
Was it because of Ro Na?

618
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,652
She could get into Cheonga High

619
00:26:57,676 --> 00:26:58,735
as the first on the waiting list

620
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:00,193
only if Seol A was gone.

621
00:27:00,217 --> 00:27:01,985
Is that why you killed her? Is it?

622
00:27:02,009 --> 00:27:03,834
Stop making things up.

623
00:27:04,175 --> 00:27:06,459
What you just said is all in your head.

624
00:27:07,467 --> 00:27:08,402
Something like this

625
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:10,376
could be fabricated easily.

626
00:27:13,634 --> 00:27:15,209
Why?

627
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:17,402
Was it too tough

628
00:27:17,426 --> 00:27:19,459
to blame Seo Jin as the culprit?

629
00:27:19,676 --> 00:27:21,568
Is that why you're blaming me?

630
00:27:21,592 --> 00:27:22,943
Oh Yoon Hee!

631
00:27:22,967 --> 00:27:25,167
How much lower will you go?

632
00:27:25,342 --> 00:27:27,917
I could've gone to the police right away.

633
00:27:28,426 --> 00:27:29,610
But I came to give you a chance

634
00:27:29,634 --> 00:27:30,818
to ask for forgiveness.

635
00:27:30,842 --> 00:27:32,068
I didn't kill her.

636
00:27:32,092 --> 00:27:34,167
I did not kill her!

637
00:27:34,342 --> 00:27:35,859
I understand that you feel guilty,

638
00:27:35,883 --> 00:27:37,735
but your dead daughter won't come back.

639
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:38,901
It's your fault

640
00:27:38,925 --> 00:27:40,068
you couldn't keep her safe!

641
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:41,402
Fine, you're right.

642
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:43,126
It's my fault.

643
00:27:43,842 --> 00:27:45,276
I'm guilty of

644
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,500
befriending her murderer.

645
00:27:50,217 --> 00:27:52,292
What would Ro Na say

646
00:27:52,342 --> 00:27:53,818
if she finds out?

647
00:27:53,842 --> 00:27:55,193
What if she finds out

648
00:27:55,217 --> 00:27:57,068
you killed someone for her?

649
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,869
Do you think she would understand

650
00:27:58,894 --> 00:28:00,756
and forgive her mother?

651
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,667
Don't say

652
00:28:05,092 --> 00:28:06,834
a word to Ro Na

653
00:28:07,134 --> 00:28:08,910
about Seol A.

654
00:28:09,509 --> 00:28:11,568
She just got back on the track.

655
00:28:11,592 --> 00:28:12,735
Don't let your absurd speculation

656
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:14,500
shake her around.

657
00:28:15,342 --> 00:28:17,042
Nothing can stop you

658
00:28:18,092 --> 00:28:20,625
when it comes to Ro Na, right?

659
00:28:48,551 --> 00:28:50,209
Honey.

660
00:28:50,259 --> 00:28:51,959
Let's go home.

661
00:28:56,967 --> 00:28:58,625
Is this

662
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,500
your answer?

663
00:29:05,718 --> 00:29:07,875
Take her away. And be gentle.

664
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,542
I'll walk myself.

665
00:29:27,384 --> 00:29:29,042
I'll contact you later.

666
00:29:43,634 --> 00:29:45,193
You made the right choice.

667
00:29:45,217 --> 00:29:47,334
You've done well, Yoon Hee.

668
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:50,084
This was the only way

669
00:29:50,551 --> 00:29:52,292
to save Ro Na.

670
00:29:55,175 --> 00:29:56,917
You've done well.

671
00:30:09,384 --> 00:30:10,652
It's okay.

672
00:30:10,676 --> 00:30:12,485
It's all right.

673
00:30:12,509 --> 00:30:14,542
It's all right. It's okay.

674
00:30:14,567 --> 00:30:17,542
Goodness, it's so cold.

675
00:30:33,509 --> 00:30:35,151
Seok Kyung.

676
00:30:35,175 --> 00:30:36,834
Seok Kyung, what's wrong?

677
00:30:37,092 --> 00:30:38,735
Darn it! - Seok Kyung!

678
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:40,485
It's okay, Seok Kyung.

679
00:30:40,509 --> 00:30:42,126
It's okay.

680
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:44,709
It's all right.

681
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:47,443
It's okay, Seok Kyung.

682
00:30:47,467 --> 00:30:48,527
Everything will be fine.

683
00:30:48,551 --> 00:30:49,586
Get lost!

684
00:30:52,551 --> 00:30:53,775
Dad...

685
00:30:54,718 --> 00:30:56,026
I'm scared.

686
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:58,792
Min Seol A keeps following me.

687
00:31:00,967 --> 00:31:02,110
It's all right.

688
00:31:02,134 --> 00:31:04,068
I'm right here. Don't worry.

689
00:31:04,092 --> 00:31:06,542
I'm right here. Don't be scared.

690
00:31:06,925 --> 00:31:08,347
Did Mum

691
00:31:09,009 --> 00:31:10,950
kill Min Seol A?

692
00:31:12,134 --> 00:31:13,959
Because of me?

693
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:17,193
Because she had to cover up what I did?

694
00:31:17,217 --> 00:31:19,750
Did she kill her?

695
00:31:24,676 --> 00:31:26,750
It's okay, Eun Byeol.

696
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,500
It's all right.

697
00:31:49,676 --> 00:31:51,542
So you were

698
00:31:52,509 --> 00:31:54,625
Min Seol A's biological mother?

699
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,625
What you did is very tricky, Soo Ryeon.

700
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,583
Why have you been behaving this cheeky?

701
00:32:01,134 --> 00:32:02,485
Were you that foolish type

702
00:32:02,509 --> 00:32:04,360
who would risk her life

703
00:32:04,384 --> 00:32:05,901
over a dead child?

704
00:32:05,925 --> 00:32:08,000
You can say whatever you want.

705
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,402
If it wasn't for you,

706
00:32:09,426 --> 00:32:11,709
she wouldn't have died like that.

707
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:13,750
Why did you do that?

708
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,376
Wasn't it enough that you killed her dad?

709
00:32:16,925 --> 00:32:18,750
Why did you...

710
00:32:19,467 --> 00:32:22,625
Why did you switch her with another girl?

711
00:32:26,509 --> 00:32:29,167
Then did you really think

712
00:32:29,259 --> 00:32:31,818
I would help you raise that jerk's kid?

713
00:32:31,842 --> 00:32:33,276
You are...

714
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,126
You are way too naive.

715
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:39,776
I wanted to eat up that jerk alive.

716
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,776
Why would I do that?

717
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,500
Don't get delusional, thinking it's over.

718
00:32:43,551 --> 00:32:45,360
I'll make sure

719
00:32:45,384 --> 00:32:47,193
you get punished

720
00:32:47,217 --> 00:32:49,459
for everything you did.

721
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:51,334
You scumbag.

722
00:33:02,509 --> 00:33:04,167
Who is it?

723
00:33:04,551 --> 00:33:07,917
Who made you this confident?

724
00:33:08,883 --> 00:33:11,485
Sending Hye In all the way to New York

725
00:33:11,509 --> 00:33:13,402
and putting up this huge show isn't

726
00:33:13,426 --> 00:33:16,026
something a man like Gu Ho Dong can do.

727
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:19,000
That means you have another helper.

728
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,985
Tell me now.

729
00:33:22,009 --> 00:33:23,667
Who was it?

730
00:33:28,718 --> 00:33:30,334
Fine.

731
00:33:30,426 --> 00:33:32,209
It's not a bad idea

732
00:33:32,342 --> 00:33:35,418
to be with your dead daughter.

733
00:33:37,634 --> 00:33:39,376
It's Logan Lee, Chairman Joo.

734
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,985
It's me.

735
00:33:59,009 --> 00:34:01,251
I was going to call you too.

736
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,959
Right now?

737
00:34:09,883 --> 00:34:11,500
Sure.

738
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:15,500
Keep a close eye on this brat.

739
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,418
Don't let the kids run into her.

740
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:56,360
What is this?

741
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,735
What's going on?

742
00:34:57,759 --> 00:34:58,776
Turn on the lights.

743
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,459
Now!

744
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:54,402
Get the lights.

745
00:35:54,426 --> 00:35:56,042
Get the lights!

746
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,500
She's gone.

747
00:36:02,883 --> 00:36:05,167
Find her. Find her now!

748
00:36:13,134 --> 00:36:14,875
Stop right there!

749
00:36:42,925 --> 00:36:44,859
Excuse me for being late.

750
00:36:44,883 --> 00:36:46,402
It's okay.

751
00:36:46,426 --> 00:36:48,251
I'll have the same, please.

752
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,875
So Mr. Joo.

753
00:36:53,634 --> 00:36:54,735
I heard you missed the event

754
00:36:54,759 --> 00:36:56,418
with Grace Joe.

755
00:36:56,634 --> 00:36:57,527
You know I put in

756
00:36:57,551 --> 00:36:59,360
a lot of work into it, right?

757
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:01,418
You put me in a bad position.

758
00:37:02,009 --> 00:37:03,568
So you want to tell me what happened?

759
00:37:03,592 --> 00:37:05,334
There was an accident.

760
00:37:05,718 --> 00:37:08,167
It seems like you haven't heard anything.

761
00:37:08,718 --> 00:37:10,859
There was an interesting incident

762
00:37:10,883 --> 00:37:13,068
on the limo that you sent us.

763
00:37:13,092 --> 00:37:16,418
Yes, I heard about it from my secretary.

764
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:17,735
There must've been some kind of

765
00:37:17,759 --> 00:37:19,750
a confusion with the limousines.

766
00:37:20,759 --> 00:37:23,235
Anyway, do you happen to know a man

767
00:37:23,259 --> 00:37:25,818
by the name of Ho Dong Gu?

768
00:37:25,842 --> 00:37:27,776
Ho Dong Gu? Gu Ho Dong?

769
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,859
Yes.

770
00:37:28,883 --> 00:37:30,610
This man called me.

771
00:37:30,634 --> 00:37:32,485
And he asked me if I knew

772
00:37:32,509 --> 00:37:34,792
the real Dan Tae Joo.

773
00:37:35,092 --> 00:37:36,485
He claims that you and others

774
00:37:36,509 --> 00:37:37,402
at Hera Palace are

775
00:37:37,426 --> 00:37:39,068
involved in some kind of

776
00:37:39,092 --> 00:37:40,875
a murder case.

777
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,360
Is this true?

778
00:37:43,384 --> 00:37:44,694
He's not a trustworthy man.

779
00:37:44,718 --> 00:37:46,709
You don't have to mind him.

780
00:37:47,509 --> 00:37:50,318
Well, it's against my policy to go around

781
00:37:50,342 --> 00:37:51,735
digging up other people's

782
00:37:51,759 --> 00:37:53,110
private business matters,

783
00:37:53,134 --> 00:37:55,667
but it did catch me off guard.

784
00:37:55,718 --> 00:37:57,527
Considering the fact that you tried

785
00:37:57,551 --> 00:37:59,193
to sell your living daughter's property,

786
00:37:59,217 --> 00:38:02,126
and now, a murder case.

787
00:38:02,551 --> 00:38:04,193
I don't know if I can keep trusting you

788
00:38:04,217 --> 00:38:05,276
as a business partner.

789
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,360
The investment presentation is tomorrow.

790
00:38:07,384 --> 00:38:08,443
Many of our investors are

791
00:38:08,467 --> 00:38:10,026
expecting a lot from this casino business.

792
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:11,859
You can't be shaken.

793
00:38:11,883 --> 00:38:14,292
Everything is a lie. Those aren't true.

794
00:38:15,551 --> 00:38:17,376
What if I don't believe you?

795
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,402
I'll get thoroughly prepared

796
00:38:19,426 --> 00:38:21,110
and live up to your trust.

797
00:38:21,134 --> 00:38:23,376
I won't let you down.

798
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,000
The investment presentation.

799
00:38:34,175 --> 00:38:36,126
I'll be looking forward to it.

800
00:38:36,634 --> 00:38:38,292
Okay.

801
00:38:46,142 --> 00:38:48,009
Was everything okay?

802
00:38:48,351 --> 00:38:50,675
Wasn't Dan Tae suspicious of you?

803
00:38:50,975 --> 00:38:53,160
Well, he's not the most trusting person.

804
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:55,300
So I'm sure he has doubts.

805
00:38:55,476 --> 00:38:58,327
But the company's under his name,

806
00:38:58,351 --> 00:39:00,576
and with the presentation tomorrow...

807
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,634
I think he's willing to just proceed.

808
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,592
I know how hard it's been for you.

809
00:39:07,809 --> 00:39:10,383
Why did you go to Oh Yoon Hee's place?

810
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:15,800
I wasn't mistaken about what I saw.

811
00:39:25,725 --> 00:39:28,410
Soo Ryeon and I are close.

812
00:39:28,434 --> 00:39:30,342
Have you forgotten all about it?

813
00:39:30,392 --> 00:39:31,951
If that bothered you,

814
00:39:31,975 --> 00:39:33,842
you wouldn't be here now.

815
00:39:34,683 --> 00:39:36,550
Am I wrong?

816
00:39:46,809 --> 00:39:48,243
Hello?

817
00:39:48,267 --> 00:39:50,509
Why is it so hard to reach you?

818
00:39:50,642 --> 00:39:51,576
Dan Tae was involved

819
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,160
in my daughter's death.

820
00:39:53,184 --> 00:39:54,701
Come with me to the police station

821
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,410
and give a statement about Seol A.

822
00:39:56,434 --> 00:39:57,826
You're the only person

823
00:39:57,850 --> 00:39:59,327
I can trust right now.

824
00:39:59,351 --> 00:40:01,592
I must catch the person who killed her.

825
00:40:02,017 --> 00:40:04,300
Please help me, Yoon Hee.

826
00:40:12,184 --> 00:40:14,993
Yoon Hee has joined hands with Dan Tae.

827
00:40:15,017 --> 00:40:17,300
She betrayed me.

828
00:40:18,059 --> 00:40:20,202
What did I tell you?

829
00:40:20,226 --> 00:40:23,092
I told you not to trust her.

830
00:40:28,434 --> 00:40:30,342
Oh Yoon Hee is the murderer.

831
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:33,759
She killed Seol A.

832
00:40:37,142 --> 00:40:38,926
What...

833
00:40:40,017 --> 00:40:41,967
What did you just say?

834
00:40:42,476 --> 00:40:44,509
The person who killed Seol A

835
00:40:46,392 --> 00:40:48,300
was Yoon Hee.

836
00:40:53,267 --> 00:40:55,134
Calm down, please!

837
00:40:55,184 --> 00:40:56,285
Now's not the right time.

838
00:40:56,309 --> 00:40:57,576
Give me some time.

839
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,701
I'll handle this.

840
00:40:58,725 --> 00:41:00,842
Why do you need more time?

841
00:41:00,934 --> 00:41:03,826
What do you expect from that woman?

842
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:05,993
Oh Yoon Hee has already betrayed you.

843
00:41:06,017 --> 00:41:07,868
Now that she's helping Joo Dan Tae,

844
00:41:07,892 --> 00:41:09,701
she'll try to kill you at all costs.

845
00:41:09,725 --> 00:41:11,452
I know that too.

846
00:41:11,476 --> 00:41:12,576
But now's not the time.

847
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,951
Why not?

848
00:41:13,975 --> 00:41:16,327
We'll just kill her!

849
00:41:16,351 --> 00:41:18,884
Just like what she did to Seol A.

850
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,550
I want to do that too!

851
00:41:21,809 --> 00:41:23,576
But will that put an end to everything?

852
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,202
What will we do after that?

853
00:41:25,226 --> 00:41:26,576
Do you think Seol A would want us

854
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,842
to become murderers just like them?

855
00:41:31,434 --> 00:41:33,327
What about Seok Hoon and Seok Kyung?

856
00:41:33,351 --> 00:41:35,550
I'm their mother.

857
00:41:35,725 --> 00:41:36,910
I can't be that irresponsible

858
00:41:36,934 --> 00:41:38,910
and destroy my own life.

859
00:41:41,725 --> 00:41:43,343
I feel a lot more

860
00:41:43,368 --> 00:41:44,743
resentful and furious than you do,

861
00:41:44,767 --> 00:41:47,352
and it's driving me insane.

862
00:41:47,377 --> 00:41:50,369
But I'm doing my best to keep it together

863
00:41:50,618 --> 00:41:51,718
because I know we can't solve this

864
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:53,260
by being emotional.

865
00:41:53,284 --> 00:41:55,549
I'll get back at them in my own way.

866
00:41:55,574 --> 00:41:57,565
I'll do it at the very end,

867
00:41:57,715 --> 00:42:00,442
as painfully as possible.

868
00:42:01,909 --> 00:42:03,635
So please just stick to the plan

869
00:42:03,659 --> 00:42:05,051
and do things

870
00:42:05,075 --> 00:42:06,775
step by step.

871
00:42:07,534 --> 00:42:10,817
That's our best option now.

872
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:23,093
Chairman Joo.

873
00:42:23,117 --> 00:42:24,926
What took you so long?

874
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:26,885
You know that this is a real emergency.

875
00:42:26,909 --> 00:42:30,026
You kept us waiting so long.

876
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:32,093
Why did you want to meet so early?

877
00:42:32,117 --> 00:42:33,635
What kind of question is that?

878
00:42:33,659 --> 00:42:35,385
All of us here nearly died,

879
00:42:35,409 --> 00:42:37,900
and so did our kids.

880
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:40,801
Are we going to sit back and do nothing?

881
00:42:40,825 --> 00:42:42,801
Answer me. Where is Sim Soo Ryeon?

882
00:42:42,825 --> 00:42:44,093
Did you find her?

883
00:42:44,117 --> 00:42:45,176
No.

884
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,801
You still haven't found her?

885
00:42:46,825 --> 00:42:49,010
Gosh, good for you.

886
00:42:49,034 --> 00:42:51,775
Very good.

887
00:42:52,534 --> 00:42:53,552
What?

888
00:42:53,576 --> 00:42:56,051
Now, we know that Soo Ryeon is the one

889
00:42:56,075 --> 00:42:58,260
who's been blackmailing us.

890
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:00,510
Her kids will be deeply scarred by this.

891
00:43:00,534 --> 00:43:01,427
As a mother,

892
00:43:01,451 --> 00:43:02,968
how could she do something like that?

893
00:43:02,992 --> 00:43:05,676
But we can't report her to the police.

894
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,885
What about all the things that we did?

895
00:43:07,909 --> 00:43:09,594
The kids already know everything,

896
00:43:09,618 --> 00:43:11,718
so what's there to be scared of?

897
00:43:11,742 --> 00:43:12,885
Let's just sue her!

898
00:43:12,909 --> 00:43:14,093
For kidnapping, confinement,

899
00:43:14,117 --> 00:43:15,260
and blackmailing!

900
00:43:15,284 --> 00:43:17,026
You see,

901
00:43:17,242 --> 00:43:19,385
I won't let her get away with this.

902
00:43:19,409 --> 00:43:20,676
Come to think of it,

903
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:23,843
you were right about everything, Ms. Cheon.

904
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:25,093
Soo Ryeon really turned out to be

905
00:43:25,117 --> 00:43:26,427
Min Seol A's mother.

906
00:43:26,451 --> 00:43:28,926
It means she's been lying to us all along

907
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:30,718
and planned all of this.

908
00:43:30,742 --> 00:43:33,343
I hope we didn't make any mistakes.

909
00:43:33,367 --> 00:43:36,218
I bet she's been collecting evidence.

910
00:43:36,242 --> 00:43:37,302
What if

911
00:43:37,326 --> 00:43:41,260
all of us end up in jail together?

912
00:43:41,284 --> 00:43:43,427
Well, she's your wife.

913
00:43:43,451 --> 00:43:46,859
You never noticed anything suspicious?

914
00:43:47,034 --> 00:43:48,885
You always acted so smart. My gosh.

915
00:43:48,909 --> 00:43:51,218
How slow-witted. Are you an idiot?

916
00:43:51,242 --> 00:43:53,900
He loves his wife so much

917
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:55,900
that he never noticed anything.

918
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,734
I admit that I made a mistake.

919
00:44:01,075 --> 00:44:02,427
But what matters is how we deal with this

920
00:44:02,451 --> 00:44:03,759
from here on.

921
00:44:03,783 --> 00:44:05,801
We'd better stay alert if we don't want

922
00:44:05,825 --> 00:44:07,427
to be fooled by her again.

923
00:44:07,451 --> 00:44:09,942
Do you not understand what's going on?

924
00:44:09,992 --> 00:44:12,635
We already confessed to everything.

925
00:44:12,659 --> 00:44:15,359
What's the use of staying alert?

926
00:44:15,492 --> 00:44:16,676
Before confessing to everything,

927
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,318
what kind of situation

928
00:44:18,783 --> 00:44:20,400
were we in?

929
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:23,984
Right, we were forced to do it!

930
00:44:24,034 --> 00:44:26,552
We were coerced to make false confessions!

931
00:44:26,576 --> 00:44:28,400
Bingo.

932
00:44:28,659 --> 00:44:29,968
If we say we lied because

933
00:44:29,992 --> 00:44:31,594
our lives were being threatened,

934
00:44:31,618 --> 00:44:33,468
the police won't be able to arrest us.

935
00:44:33,492 --> 00:44:34,885
We have to come up with a story

936
00:44:34,909 --> 00:44:36,135
and stick to it.

937
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:39,218
Sim Soo Ryeon wanted to divorce me,

938
00:44:39,242 --> 00:44:41,525
so she dragged all of you into this.

939
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,302
To get a huge amount of alimony,

940
00:44:43,326 --> 00:44:44,385
she came up with this ruse.

941
00:44:44,409 --> 00:44:45,843
One more thing.

942
00:44:45,867 --> 00:44:47,468
Let's also add

943
00:44:47,492 --> 00:44:49,510
that Soo Ryeon was delusional and thought

944
00:44:49,534 --> 00:44:50,676
Min Seol A was her daughter.

945
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:52,483
Good idea.

946
00:44:52,659 --> 00:44:54,176
There's no evidence

947
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,552
to prove that Min Seol A

948
00:44:55,576 --> 00:44:57,483
was indeed her daughter.

949
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,968
But what about Gu Ho Dong?

950
00:45:01,992 --> 00:45:03,343
What will we do about him?

951
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:05,109
I'll take care of him.

952
00:45:05,326 --> 00:45:06,759
I'll do whatever it takes

953
00:45:06,783 --> 00:45:08,984
to track him down.

954
00:45:09,159 --> 00:45:10,676
We've worked very hard to build

955
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:12,510
our little kingdom here at Hera Palace.

956
00:45:12,534 --> 00:45:14,400
I won't let them destroy it.

957
00:45:14,659 --> 00:45:15,885
Never.

958
00:45:15,909 --> 00:45:18,359
Nice one.

959
00:45:50,825 --> 00:45:51,843
I'm sorry, sir.

960
00:45:51,867 --> 00:45:54,302
Do whatever it takes to bring her to me.

961
00:45:54,326 --> 00:45:56,525
I don't care even if it's her dead body.

962
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,817
Eun Byeol.

963
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:08,176
Did you sleep well?

964
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,093
Don't go to school today.

965
00:46:09,117 --> 00:46:10,093
I'll call your teacher for you.

966
00:46:10,117 --> 00:46:11,427
I bombed my midterms,

967
00:46:11,451 --> 00:46:12,676
so I can't miss school.

968
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,801
It's okay. It's not the end of the world.

969
00:46:14,825 --> 00:46:16,734
Look at me.

970
00:46:16,783 --> 00:46:18,650
Are you really okay?

971
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:23,234
Eun Byeol is not that weak.

972
00:46:23,534 --> 00:46:25,343
Hurry up and go to school.

973
00:46:25,367 --> 00:46:26,552
Get there before everyone else

974
00:46:26,576 --> 00:46:28,260
and warm up your voice a little.

975
00:46:28,284 --> 00:46:30,843
Yes, I should stick to my normal routine.

976
00:46:30,867 --> 00:46:33,483
It's not like I did anything wrong.

977
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:41,067
You and Dad raised me wrong.

978
00:46:49,284 --> 00:46:51,026
Eun Byeol.

979
00:47:02,284 --> 00:47:04,385
So you're going to push ahead with it?

980
00:47:04,409 --> 00:47:05,385
Do you really need

981
00:47:05,409 --> 00:47:06,676
your inauguration ceremony now?

982
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:07,594
Don't you remember

983
00:47:07,618 --> 00:47:08,843
what happened last night?

984
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:10,676
Why must I cancel my plans

985
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:13,483
when I didn't even do anything wrong?

986
00:47:14,075 --> 00:47:15,552
I will not let Sim Soo Ryeon

987
00:47:15,576 --> 00:47:17,692
have things her way.

988
00:47:18,284 --> 00:47:20,552
We're divorced, so mind your own business.

989
00:47:20,576 --> 00:47:21,676
You saw Eun Byeol.

990
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:23,385
Are you not even worried about her?

991
00:47:23,409 --> 00:47:24,343
Can't you see that

992
00:47:24,367 --> 00:47:25,968
she's all broken inside?

993
00:47:25,992 --> 00:47:27,510
She has nightmares all night

994
00:47:27,534 --> 00:47:28,718
and keeps talking nonsense.

995
00:47:28,742 --> 00:47:29,926
She's not all there!

996
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:32,234
Right now,

997
00:47:35,242 --> 00:47:36,676
nothing will comfort her more

998
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:37,759
than seeing her mum finally become

999
00:47:37,783 --> 00:47:39,359
the chief director.

1000
00:47:42,034 --> 00:47:43,093
That's what I've chosen to do

1001
00:47:43,117 --> 00:47:44,692
for Eun Byeol.

1002
00:47:45,367 --> 00:47:47,135
What's going to change if you do nothing

1003
00:47:47,159 --> 00:47:48,176
and just keep coddling her?

1004
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,468
Will you let her be haunted by Seol A

1005
00:47:49,492 --> 00:47:51,218
for the rest of her life?

1006
00:47:51,242 --> 00:47:53,260
You're incompetent and irresponsible.

1007
00:47:53,284 --> 00:47:55,442
Don't even call yourself a dad.

1008
00:47:57,534 --> 00:48:00,176
You really frighten me.

1009
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,718
Do you know what's going on

1010
00:48:01,742 --> 00:48:03,318
inside her head now?

1011
00:48:03,659 --> 00:48:05,759
She's terrified that you might have

1012
00:48:05,783 --> 00:48:07,900
killed Min Seol A.

1013
00:48:12,034 --> 00:48:14,400
I did not kill her.

1014
00:48:14,909 --> 00:48:16,775
So we're all good now, right?

1015
00:48:17,783 --> 00:48:18,718
Stop making such a fuss

1016
00:48:18,742 --> 00:48:20,801
and just attend the ceremony

1017
00:48:20,825 --> 00:48:23,942
as the director of Cheonga Medical Centre.

1018
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,801
I found this on Mr. Gu's desk this morning.

1019
00:48:30,825 --> 00:48:32,216
"Letter of Resignation"

1020
00:48:36,242 --> 00:48:37,385
"Letter of Resignation"

1021
00:48:37,409 --> 00:48:38,676
Letter of Resignation.

1022
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:41,276
Get lost.

1023
00:48:42,992 --> 00:48:44,302
"Get lost"?

1024
00:48:44,326 --> 00:48:46,718
He's a complete lunatic.

1025
00:48:46,742 --> 00:48:50,609
How dare he tell you to get lost...

1026
00:48:54,492 --> 00:48:55,635
Ma'am.

1027
00:48:55,659 --> 00:48:57,093
This is actually a good thing

1028
00:48:57,117 --> 00:48:58,926
because he was always such a nuisance.

1029
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:00,343
What a wonderful gift

1030
00:49:00,367 --> 00:49:02,718
just in time for your inauguration.

1031
00:49:02,742 --> 00:49:05,218
And everything's coming along smoothly

1032
00:49:05,242 --> 00:49:06,676
for your inauguration ceremony

1033
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:08,135
this afternoon.

1034
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:11,067
And as a little surprise event,

1035
00:49:11,409 --> 00:49:14,010
I'm going to sing for you at the ceremony.

1036
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:17,328
I'll be singing your favourite song--

1037
00:49:17,353 --> 00:49:18,552
Okay.

1038
00:49:18,576 --> 00:49:20,400
You may leave.

1039
00:49:20,425 --> 00:49:23,959
Sure, then I'll see you at the ceremony.

1040
00:49:33,015 --> 00:49:35,806
"Get lost"

1041
00:49:40,576 --> 00:49:42,525
Gu Ho Dong.

1042
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:46,109
There's something off about him.

1043
00:50:17,659 --> 00:50:18,718
I knew it.

1044
00:50:18,742 --> 00:50:21,067
Logan is helping Soo Ryeon.

1045
00:50:26,492 --> 00:50:29,176
Can we meet now?

1046
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,109
It's about something important.

1047
00:50:33,284 --> 00:50:34,635
So tell me.

1048
00:50:34,659 --> 00:50:36,650
Why did you want to see me?

1049
00:50:37,742 --> 00:50:40,968
Soo Ryeon's doing well, right?

1050
00:50:40,992 --> 00:50:43,359
I've been wondering where she was hiding.

1051
00:50:43,618 --> 00:50:46,734
I'm relieved to know that she's with you.

1052
00:50:47,159 --> 00:50:48,968
I don't know what you're talking about.

1053
00:50:48,992 --> 00:50:50,676
I know that Soo Ryeon

1054
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:53,483
is staying with you at the hotel.

1055
00:50:53,742 --> 00:50:55,984
I already checked,

1056
00:50:56,075 --> 00:50:58,109
so you don't need to lie to me.

1057
00:51:04,783 --> 00:51:06,051
As you know,

1058
00:51:06,075 --> 00:51:08,483
I work for JKING Holdings.

1059
00:51:08,576 --> 00:51:11,567
And Chairman Joo is looking for his wife.

1060
00:51:12,284 --> 00:51:14,427
As his employee, I should give him

1061
00:51:14,451 --> 00:51:16,775
the information he's after, right?

1062
00:51:16,992 --> 00:51:18,817
Where Soo Ryeon is

1063
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:21,276
and who she's staying with.

1064
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:25,385
Then you should've contacted Mr. Joo.

1065
00:51:25,409 --> 00:51:27,775
Why in the world did you come to me?

1066
00:51:27,825 --> 00:51:29,567
Because I was curious.

1067
00:51:31,659 --> 00:51:33,525
Why are you

1068
00:51:33,825 --> 00:51:35,859
helping Soo Ryeon?

1069
00:51:36,742 --> 00:51:38,552
Don't tell me

1070
00:51:38,576 --> 00:51:40,135
you've developed feelings

1071
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:42,234
for your business partner's wife.

1072
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,926
Now, Ms. Oh.

1073
00:51:45,950 --> 00:51:47,510
Why is it necessary for me

1074
00:51:47,534 --> 00:51:49,676
to explain my personal feelings

1075
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:51,609
to someone like you?

1076
00:51:51,909 --> 00:51:53,343
I'm sure this project

1077
00:51:53,367 --> 00:51:55,885
is very important to you as well.

1078
00:51:55,909 --> 00:51:58,676
I'm concerned you'd ruin everything

1079
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:00,817
because of your personal feelings.

1080
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:02,968
Is it because of Mr. Joo?

1081
00:52:02,992 --> 00:52:04,801
Because apparently to me,

1082
00:52:04,825 --> 00:52:06,594
you're the one who seems like you have

1083
00:52:06,618 --> 00:52:09,051
personal feelings towards him.

1084
00:52:09,075 --> 00:52:10,942
What did you say?

1085
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,343
Now, did you really think

1086
00:52:25,367 --> 00:52:27,135
that I was going to go and invest my money

1087
00:52:27,159 --> 00:52:29,051
without doing any background research

1088
00:52:29,075 --> 00:52:31,318
on my business partner?

1089
00:52:32,825 --> 00:52:34,650
Listen.

1090
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:40,343
I don't care if you're his employee

1091
00:52:40,367 --> 00:52:42,650
or his little Juliet.

1092
00:52:42,783 --> 00:52:44,093
Because it seems obvious

1093
00:52:44,117 --> 00:52:46,843
Mr. Joo's private life seems rather

1094
00:52:46,867 --> 00:52:48,385
disturbing anyway.

1095
00:52:48,409 --> 00:52:49,552
So why don't we keep

1096
00:52:49,576 --> 00:52:51,051
all this nonsense confidential

1097
00:52:51,075 --> 00:52:53,567
for the benefit of both of us?

1098
00:52:55,492 --> 00:52:56,676
Because you do realise

1099
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,385
that we have a very, very

1100
00:52:58,409 --> 00:53:01,135
important investment conference coming up,

1101
00:53:01,159 --> 00:53:02,859
right?

1102
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:07,318
As long as we know you're helping her,

1103
00:53:07,992 --> 00:53:10,400
we can't trust you.

1104
00:53:10,492 --> 00:53:11,843
I'll let Chairman Joo know

1105
00:53:11,867 --> 00:53:14,067
about your relationship with her.

1106
00:53:14,909 --> 00:53:16,635
Listen.

1107
00:53:16,659 --> 00:53:18,427
When this is over,

1108
00:53:18,451 --> 00:53:19,676
I'm planning to take Soo Ryeon

1109
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,734
to America with me anyway.

1110
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,885
And she has agreed to go with you?

1111
00:53:26,909 --> 00:53:29,260
I'm convincing her at the moment.

1112
00:53:29,284 --> 00:53:30,635
Obviously, she can't live

1113
00:53:30,659 --> 00:53:32,442
with Mr. Joo any more.

1114
00:53:32,659 --> 00:53:33,676
But isn't that what you wanted

1115
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:35,510
in the first place?

1116
00:53:35,534 --> 00:53:37,609
For me to get rid of her.

1117
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:47,442
Soo Ryeon will move to the US with Logan?

1118
00:53:54,909 --> 00:53:56,010
Hello?

1119
00:53:56,034 --> 00:53:57,302
How did it go?

1120
00:53:57,326 --> 00:53:59,468
Did you find out who's helping Soo Ryeon?

1121
00:53:59,492 --> 00:54:03,359
Not yet. I think I need more time.

1122
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:07,385
Do me a favour

1123
00:54:07,409 --> 00:54:09,359
and please get it done quickly.

1124
00:54:15,992 --> 00:54:18,525
Yoon Hee knows about us?

1125
00:54:18,825 --> 00:54:20,051
How did she find out?

1126
00:54:20,075 --> 00:54:22,609
I think she saw you entering the hotel.

1127
00:54:22,909 --> 00:54:25,010
I made sure she won't tell anyone,

1128
00:54:25,034 --> 00:54:27,109
but who knows when she'll drop the bomb?

1129
00:54:29,117 --> 00:54:31,609
I really hope she keeps her lips sealed

1130
00:54:31,825 --> 00:54:34,051
until the presentation is over.

1131
00:54:34,075 --> 00:54:36,650
If Dan Tae finds out before that,

1132
00:54:36,992 --> 00:54:39,817
everything will go down the drain.

1133
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:45,885
All we can do is pray for the best.

1134
00:54:45,909 --> 00:54:48,984
The day of judgment has finally come.

1135
00:54:49,659 --> 00:54:51,525
Everything will go well.

1136
00:54:52,576 --> 00:54:54,400
Yes, it should.

1137
00:54:56,483 --> 00:54:58,725
For Seol A's sake.

1138
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,900
We must succeed.

00:55:04,284 --> 00:55:06,010
that Ms. Cheon Seo Jin

Hello, I'm Cheon Seo Jin.

First and foremost, I'd like to thank all

for making time to attend this ceremony.

for their unconditional trust and support

as well as for appointing me

I promise you

1160
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:12,594
that I will make Cheonga a stronger

1161

and more transparent organisation.

I'm Oh Song Hee from Jeongeui Daily.

1173
00:57:12,117 --> 00:57:13,635
Did you know that a whistleblower

1174
00:57:13,659 --> 00:57:15,385
sent in a tip regarding the school's

1175

rigged admission process?

your daughter's scores to get her in?

1178
00:57:19,367 --> 00:57:21,093
Apparently, your daughter sang out of tune

1179
00:57:21,117 --> 00:57:22,843
and ran out in the middle of the test.

1180

Is it true? - Ms. Cheon.

1185

A comment, please.

I'm a fan of yours.

I'm sorry we had to meet like this.

Let go! Do you know who I am?

How dare you touch me. Let go.

Could it be...

This is nothing to worry about.

Hello.

1237
01:00:04,975 --> 01:00:06,451
Since they're using our Myeong-dong land

1238
01:00:06,476 --> 01:00:07,576
as collateral,

1239

we're very important

1240
01:00:09,267 --> 01:00:10,826
in this deal.

1241
01:00:10,984 --> 01:00:12,993
So let's not rely on Chairman Joo so much.

1242
01:00:13,017 --> 01:00:15,576
We should be more involved.

1243
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,550
Yes, we should do that.

1244

Nothing's been going our way

1245
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:21,576
because we trusted him too much.

1246

That's exactly my point.

All the ladies at Hera Palace

1250
01:00:29,184 --> 01:00:30,202
got all dressed up

1251
01:00:30,226 --> 01:00:32,609
and went there this morning.

1252
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,160
Come on. I know you two are divorced now,

1253
01:00:35,184 --> 01:00:36,410
but you're on the board as well.

1254
01:00:36,434 --> 01:00:37,368

your right to vote.

You'd only benefit from it later on.

If this project goes well,

1258
01:00:45,184 --> 01:00:46,618
maybe I should give my wife

a huge amount of alimony and leave her.

1360
01:05:47,878 --> 01:05:51,287
You still don't get it now, Mr. Joo?

1361
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,942
I'm the one who reported you,

1362
01:05:56,967 --> 01:05:58,834
Mr. Joo Dan Tae.

1363
01:05:58,859 --> 01:06:01,976
What... What did you say?

1364
01:06:02,210 --> 01:06:03,603
I said,

1365
01:06:03,628 --> 01:06:06,203
I'm the one who reported you.

1366
01:06:34,576 --> 01:06:37,426
=Penthouse=

1367
01:06:37,451 --> 01:06:39,500
I said you were up for a surprise.

1368
01:06:39,525 --> 01:06:40,666
They must suffer the same way.

1369
01:06:40,691 --> 01:06:41,653
That's only fair.

1370
01:06:41,678 --> 01:06:43,113
Rubbish! - Rubbish!

1371
01:06:43,138 --> 01:06:44,655
What's wrong? Eun Byeol!

1372
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:46,531
You should also experience the sorrow

1373
01:06:46,556 --> 01:06:47,491
of losing your child.

1374
01:06:47,516 --> 01:06:48,908
I won't let you have your way.

1375
01:06:48,933 --> 01:06:51,201
You want me to kill Soo Ryeon?

1376
01:06:51,226 --> 01:06:52,869
I'll wait for you.

1377
01:06:52,894 --> 01:06:55,619
I'll uncover the whole truth.

1378
01:06:55,644 --> 01:06:56,579
Try all you want.

1379
01:06:56,604 --> 01:06:59,385
Let's see who wins in the end.
