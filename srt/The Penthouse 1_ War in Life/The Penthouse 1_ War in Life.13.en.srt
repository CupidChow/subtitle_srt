00:00:56,946 --> 00:00:58,029
My husband has recently been

9
00:00:58,113 --> 00:00:59,154
most concerned about this man.

10
00:00:59,988 --> 00:01:01,321
A rumour says he'll open a shopping centre

11
00:01:01,362 --> 00:01:03,029
in the Myeong-dong land Dan Tae bought.

12
00:01:03,779 --> 00:01:04,862
His name is Logan Lee.

13
00:01:05,696 --> 00:01:06,612
All I know is that

14
00:01:06,696 --> 00:01:08,612
he's a Korean-American

15
00:01:08,696 --> 00:01:09,737
who's filthy rich.

16
00:01:10,113 --> 00:01:11,654
You don't even know what he looks like?

17
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:12,862
No.

18
00:01:13,029 --> 00:01:14,696
Even my husband hasn't met him.

19
00:01:15,029 --> 00:01:16,612
He keeps scheduling a meeting with him,

20
00:01:16,862 --> 00:01:18,280
but it always gets cancelled.

21
00:01:19,404 --> 00:01:20,988
If you manage to contact him,

22
00:01:21,113 --> 00:01:22,779
he'll have to hire you for that position.

23
00:01:25,654 --> 00:01:27,196
This is the information you have on him?

24
00:01:27,612 --> 00:01:28,445
I secretly took pictures

25
00:01:28,529 --> 00:01:29,612
of those documents at Dan Tae's study.

26
00:01:30,821 --> 00:01:32,196
Pretend as if you approached Attorney Lee

27
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,529
to obtain the information.

28
00:01:34,529 --> 00:01:36,071
That way, he won't be as suspicious.

29
00:01:37,238 --> 00:01:38,280
Can you do this?

30
00:01:43,529 --> 00:01:44,904
I'm a guy who passed the bar exam

31
00:01:44,988 --> 00:01:46,487
while I was still a student.

32
00:01:47,612 --> 00:01:49,862
Who does he think he is?

33
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,196
He keeps telling me to come and go...

34
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:53,821
Goodness.

35
00:01:54,113 --> 00:01:55,071
Are you all right?

36
00:01:55,571 --> 00:01:56,696
Yoon Hee.

37
00:01:57,737 --> 00:01:59,154
Gosh, come on.

38
00:01:59,238 --> 00:02:00,862
Did you come out to fetch me?

39
00:02:02,029 --> 00:02:04,280
You had too many drinks, Attorney Lee.

40
00:02:05,071 --> 00:02:05,904
No!

41
00:02:06,071 --> 00:02:07,612
Don't call me Attorney Lee.

42
00:02:07,946 --> 00:02:10,988
I'm a guy who identifies with my name.

43
00:02:11,362 --> 00:02:13,321
Call me Mr Kyu Jin from now on.

44
00:02:13,362 --> 00:02:14,696
Mr Kyu Jin... No.

45
00:02:15,529 --> 00:02:17,321
Call me Kyu Jin. Just Kyu Jin.

46
00:02:17,362 --> 00:02:18,654
Try it out. Do it.

47
00:02:20,154 --> 00:02:21,154
Kyu Jin.

49
00:02:23,154 --> 00:02:24,113
Anyway,

50
00:02:24,654 --> 00:02:27,571
is something troubling you today?

51
00:02:27,654 --> 00:02:28,904
I saw you walking over

52
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,821
swearing under your breath.

53
00:02:31,113 --> 00:02:32,196
Something is...

54
00:02:33,154 --> 00:02:34,154
troubling me.

55
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:37,904
Yes, something is making me furious.

56
00:02:37,988 --> 00:02:40,154
I had to put on a show for my mum,

57
00:02:40,404 --> 00:02:41,696
singing "Woman of Samba,"

58
00:02:41,779 --> 00:02:43,029
and doing all kinds of things

59
00:02:43,113 --> 00:02:44,529
to borrow 30 billion won.

60
00:02:44,779 --> 00:02:45,821
Then I took it

61
00:02:46,238 --> 00:02:47,696
and gave it all to Chairman Joo's project.

62
00:02:47,779 --> 00:02:48,946
And all of a sudden,

63
00:02:49,029 --> 00:02:51,196
that Logan Lee or whatever showed up

64
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,445
and kept fooling around with...

65
00:02:54,654 --> 00:02:55,571
No.

66
00:02:55,654 --> 00:02:56,737
Kyu Jin, shut up.

67
00:02:58,487 --> 00:02:59,654
Anyway, Yoon Hee...

68
00:03:01,113 --> 00:03:02,154
my heart is racing.

69
00:03:02,612 --> 00:03:03,487
Pardon?

70
00:03:04,946 --> 00:03:05,988
Good night.

71
00:03:09,321 --> 00:03:10,238
Right.

72
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:16,988
"Resident Car Park"

73
00:03:17,612 --> 00:03:20,196
Idiot. He has got to be the biggest moron.

74
00:03:22,238 --> 00:03:23,196
What did he just say?

75
00:03:24,362 --> 00:03:25,404
30 billion won?

76
00:03:26,196 --> 00:03:29,029
A real... - A real estate agent.

77
00:03:29,113 --> 00:03:31,196
Then say, "I've been a real estate agent

78
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,280
for over 10 years."

79
00:03:33,404 --> 00:03:36,862
I am a real estate agent

80
00:03:36,946 --> 00:03:39,154
for... for over 10 years.

81
00:03:39,238 --> 00:03:40,696
Myeong-dong is...

82
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:41,904
Myeong-dong is...

83
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:44,280
Korea's number one shopping district.

84
00:03:44,362 --> 00:03:45,445
Myeong-dong is

85
00:03:45,904 --> 00:03:48,862
Korea's number one shopping district.

86
00:03:49,154 --> 00:03:50,862
Hello, Mr Logan Lee.

87
00:03:50,946 --> 00:03:52,154
I'm Oh Yoon Hee.

88
00:03:57,029 --> 00:03:59,029
The only one Logan Lee is in contact with

89
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:00,154
is his secretary.

90
00:04:00,654 --> 00:04:01,612
You need to meet his secretary

91
00:04:01,696 --> 00:04:02,571
and persuade him first.

92
00:04:05,238 --> 00:04:06,196
I'm sorry.

93
00:04:29,946 --> 00:04:30,821
Hey.

94
00:04:32,737 --> 00:04:33,612
Excuse me.

95
00:04:34,821 --> 00:04:36,571
You're Mr Logan Lee's secretary, right?

96
00:04:37,571 --> 00:04:38,529
Hello.

97
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,029
My name is Oh Yoon Hee.

98
00:04:40,362 --> 00:04:42,654
May I meet him for just a moment?

99
00:04:42,737 --> 00:04:43,988
You cannot see him

100
00:04:44,071 --> 00:04:45,238
unless you made an appointment ahead.

101
00:04:45,904 --> 00:04:46,862
Excuse me, sir.

102
00:04:47,612 --> 00:04:49,362
This is a very pressing matter.

103
00:04:49,445 --> 00:04:51,445
It's really important to me,

104
00:04:51,821 --> 00:04:53,404
so just for 10 minutes, no, 5 minutes.

105
00:04:54,071 --> 00:04:55,571
No, even just one minute, please.

106
00:04:56,154 --> 00:04:57,154
Get her out of here.

107
00:04:58,404 --> 00:05:00,654
Wait, it'll take only a moment.

108
00:05:04,487 --> 00:05:06,321
Do you think I'll give up?

109
00:05:09,612 --> 00:05:10,696
I am

110
00:05:11,321 --> 00:05:13,862
putting everything I have in this too!

111
00:05:42,154 --> 00:05:43,196
I got scared for nothing.

112
00:05:51,529 --> 00:05:53,029
Hey, Soo Ryeon, it's me.

113
00:05:55,113 --> 00:05:56,362
I haven't met him yet.

114
00:05:57,487 --> 00:05:59,113
It must be hard for you.

115
00:05:59,737 --> 00:06:00,988
It's not a big deal.

116
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:03,821
I'm totally determined right now.

117
00:06:04,487 --> 00:06:05,404
Logan Lee?

118
00:06:05,946 --> 00:06:07,737
I'm going to make sure I see him.

119
00:06:09,196 --> 00:06:10,071
All right.

120
00:06:10,362 --> 00:06:11,737
Call me when you have any good news.

121
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:13,862
Good news?

122
00:06:16,321 --> 00:06:17,238
When did you get here?

123
00:06:17,445 --> 00:06:19,280
Who were you talking so friendly with?

124
00:06:22,737 --> 00:06:23,946
Ro Na's mother?

125
00:06:27,696 --> 00:06:28,821
I had to talk to her

126
00:06:28,904 --> 00:06:29,946
about something in the kids' school.

127
00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:30,862
I already told you

128
00:06:30,946 --> 00:06:31,862
that I don't like that woman.

129
00:06:32,362 --> 00:06:33,779
I told you to stay away from her.

130
00:06:34,404 --> 00:06:36,571
She might have approached you on purpose.

131
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:37,612
There's nothing I can do for her.

132
00:06:37,696 --> 00:06:38,612
Why would she do that?

133
00:06:38,946 --> 00:06:39,779
I don't even know much

134
00:06:39,862 --> 00:06:40,696
about what's going on at the school.

135
00:06:43,113 --> 00:06:44,737
I thought you had an important meeting.

136
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:45,696
Darn it!

137
00:06:46,737 --> 00:06:47,737
He cancelled on me again!

138
00:06:47,821 --> 00:06:49,362
That jerk is acting very high and mighty.

139
00:06:49,654 --> 00:06:51,321
He's rich, but he can't be that rich.

140
00:06:52,696 --> 00:06:53,529
It's nothing.

141
00:06:54,071 --> 00:06:54,988
It'll be resolved soon.

142
00:07:04,904 --> 00:07:06,071
I'm sorry, Ro Na.

143
00:07:06,362 --> 00:07:09,571
I really have to meet someone. Yes.

144
00:07:11,196 --> 00:07:12,988
Don't wait for me and go to sleep.

145
00:07:18,445 --> 00:07:19,362
Hello.

146
00:07:19,445 --> 00:07:20,487
It's me again.

147
00:07:20,612 --> 00:07:21,946
Please let me see Mr Logan Lee.

148
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:22,904
I beg of you.

149
00:07:22,988 --> 00:07:25,113
I really have to see him. Please.

150
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,113
Follow me, Ms Oh.

151
00:07:28,154 --> 00:07:29,071
Pardon?

152
00:07:31,445 --> 00:07:32,445
Hello.

153
00:07:32,904 --> 00:07:35,071
Thank you so much for your time.

154
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:36,696
I'm Oh Yoon Hee.

155
00:07:37,862 --> 00:07:39,113
What's your state of business?

156
00:07:39,445 --> 00:07:42,779
I'm here to set up a meeting between you

157
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,445
and Mr Joo,

158
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:47,904
the president of JKING Holdings.

159
00:07:51,362 --> 00:07:52,404
Did he send you here?

160
00:07:53,821 --> 00:07:55,321
If that's the case, I really don't have

161
00:07:55,362 --> 00:07:56,404
anything to say to you.

162
00:07:56,988 --> 00:07:58,029
Please escort her out.

163
00:07:59,362 --> 00:08:00,321
Let us leave.

164
00:08:00,362 --> 00:08:01,737
No, wait. No.

165
00:08:01,862 --> 00:08:04,946
No. No, I can't go like this.

166
00:08:05,404 --> 00:08:06,404
Wait.

167
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,487
I must bring you to Mr Joo.

168
00:08:11,946 --> 00:08:13,196
Please help me.

169
00:08:13,696 --> 00:08:15,612
My life depends on this.

170
00:08:16,571 --> 00:08:18,571
You are the only one person

171
00:08:18,654 --> 00:08:19,779
who can help me.

172
00:08:20,696 --> 00:08:21,612
Wait.

173
00:08:22,404 --> 00:08:24,029
Do you know about Myeong-dong?

174
00:08:26,696 --> 00:08:28,612
Myeong-dong is

175
00:08:28,696 --> 00:08:30,946
the number one shopping town in Korea.

176
00:08:32,487 --> 00:08:35,654
Here is the estimated

177
00:08:36,362 --> 00:08:38,321
investment profit...

178
00:08:40,612 --> 00:08:42,196
Darn it. Why can't I remember?

179
00:08:45,737 --> 00:08:46,612
Okay.

180
00:08:46,904 --> 00:08:47,821
"Myeong-dong is

181
00:08:47,904 --> 00:08:50,238
Korea's leading commercial district

182
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,280
with high symbolism."

183
00:08:52,821 --> 00:08:54,487
You may just speak in Korean.

184
00:08:54,988 --> 00:08:56,362
He can understand.

185
00:08:56,696 --> 00:08:57,571
Really?

186
00:08:57,946 --> 00:08:58,862
Thank you.

187
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,321
Now that we're in this situation,

188
00:09:02,696 --> 00:09:04,362
let me just be frank with you.

189
00:09:06,154 --> 00:09:07,529
Joo Dan Tae deceived me,

190
00:09:07,612 --> 00:09:08,946
and I lost a huge amount of money.

191
00:09:09,696 --> 00:09:11,321
In order to get that money back,

192
00:09:11,904 --> 00:09:14,029
I must get a job at JKING Holdings.

193
00:09:14,445 --> 00:09:15,445
I'll make sure

194
00:09:15,529 --> 00:09:16,779
this doesn't hurt you in any way.

195
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,029
I just need you to meet him once.

196
00:09:20,654 --> 00:09:21,946
If you help me out,

197
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,196
I'll make sure I'll pay you back.

198
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,321
Please, I beg of you.

199
00:09:25,571 --> 00:09:26,779
Please, sir.

200
00:09:36,904 --> 00:09:37,821
Then why don't we set up a meeting

201
00:09:37,904 --> 00:09:38,737
for tomorrow?

202
00:09:40,238 --> 00:09:41,154
Tomorrow?

203
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,654
"JKING Holdings 2020 Employment Interview"

204
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:49,654
"JKING Holdings"

205
00:09:50,487 --> 00:09:51,445
At last,

206
00:09:51,654 --> 00:09:53,238
we finally meet, Mr Joo.

207
00:09:55,487 --> 00:09:56,445
I may be the Logan Lee

208
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:57,529
that you were looking for.

209
00:10:02,862 --> 00:10:03,821
Logan Lee?

210
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,154
Wow.

211
00:10:07,321 --> 00:10:08,821
What a view you got here, Mr Joo.

212
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,238
What do you think?

213
00:10:15,404 --> 00:10:16,862
Do you now feel like doing an interview

214
00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:18,696
with me?

215
00:10:25,321 --> 00:10:27,571
Oh Yoon Hee, I almost let you

216
00:10:28,071 --> 00:10:29,612
fool me completely.

217
00:10:30,988 --> 00:10:32,362
How am I supposed to believe

218
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:33,529
he's the real Logan Lee?

219
00:10:35,696 --> 00:10:38,280
I've never met him to this day.

220
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:41,654
And you're saying you brought him here?

221
00:10:42,113 --> 00:10:43,238
You're going to regret

222
00:10:44,154 --> 00:10:45,612
what you just said right now.

223
00:10:47,404 --> 00:10:49,571
He wants to know that

224
00:10:50,071 --> 00:10:52,487
you are really Logan Lee.

225
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,988
Prove yourself.

226
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,238
Prove myself?

227
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:00,946
Please.

228
00:11:08,362 --> 00:11:09,529
As you wish.

229
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:21,487
"Logan Lee"

230
00:11:24,612 --> 00:11:25,529
Please.

231
00:11:32,904 --> 00:11:35,071
You have a very respectable employee,

232
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:36,737
Mr Joo.

233
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,946
Now, can we get down to some business?

234
00:11:41,362 --> 00:11:43,113
Oh, for your information,

235
00:11:43,196 --> 00:11:45,737
he can understand Korean pretty well.

236
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:48,445
You may speak to him at ease.

237
00:12:03,571 --> 00:12:04,529
You look beautiful.

238
00:12:07,196 --> 00:12:08,612
Like a woman who's loved.

239
00:12:09,988 --> 00:12:11,071
Is that how I looked?

240
00:12:11,487 --> 00:12:13,571
It's always great to get some flowers.

241
00:12:14,321 --> 00:12:15,321
Take a seat.

242
00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:17,280
I wonder what you have to say to me.

243
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:18,696
You should open that up first.

244
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,445
I think you got a present too.

245
00:12:21,196 --> 00:12:22,113
Should I do that?

246
00:12:40,612 --> 00:12:42,113
I knew it was you.

247
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:44,904
You killed my daughter.

248
00:12:58,612 --> 00:12:59,696
What's wrong, Seo Jin?

249
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:01,946
It's nothing.

250
00:13:09,821 --> 00:13:11,821
Isn't this the ring you wore on that day?

251
00:13:12,654 --> 00:13:13,571
What did you say?

252
00:13:13,988 --> 00:13:15,238
At the first-year anniversary ceremony

253
00:13:15,487 --> 00:13:16,904
for Hera Palace.

254
00:13:18,696 --> 00:13:20,904
It looked really great on you,

255
00:13:21,404 --> 00:13:22,696
so I still remember this.

256
00:13:23,404 --> 00:13:25,404
You were worried about your ruby ring.

257
00:13:25,988 --> 00:13:29,196
Look how big that thing is.

258
00:13:30,612 --> 00:13:33,154
You're way too dressed up today, Ms Cheon.

259
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,612
And you got the same ring

260
00:13:36,071 --> 00:13:37,404
as a present?

261
00:13:38,529 --> 00:13:39,404
Give it to me.

262
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:41,280
Goodness.

263
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,654
Are you all right, Seo Jin?

264
00:13:43,321 --> 00:13:44,654
You're bleeding a lot.

265
00:13:46,196 --> 00:13:48,404
That ring is awfully sharp.

266
00:13:50,071 --> 00:13:52,654
What if you scratched your face?

267
00:13:54,737 --> 00:13:56,737
You can't let your pretty face get hurt.

268
00:14:02,238 --> 00:14:03,696
Seo Jin, why are you trembling?

269
00:14:07,404 --> 00:14:09,404
If you found your lost ring,

270
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:10,862
wouldn't you be happy?

271
00:14:13,238 --> 00:14:15,071
What are you talking about?

272
00:14:18,862 --> 00:14:21,238
I never had a ring like this.

273
00:14:22,071 --> 00:14:23,654
I think you're mistaken.

274
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,571
Why are you so sensitive today?

275
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:29,404
Is there a story behind this ring?

276
00:14:33,154 --> 00:14:34,321
Just say what you came to say.

277
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,696
Why did you want to see me?

278
00:14:38,487 --> 00:14:39,529
This weekend,

279
00:14:39,737 --> 00:14:41,612
I wanted to throw a party for Hera Club.

280
00:14:43,113 --> 00:14:44,362
Seok Kyung and Seok Hoon

281
00:14:44,404 --> 00:14:45,612
were chosen as school ambassadors,

282
00:14:45,862 --> 00:14:48,612
and I never had a chance to thank you.

283
00:14:48,696 --> 00:14:50,487
You came to see me over some party

284
00:14:50,571 --> 00:14:52,029
you wanted to throw to celebrate?

285
00:14:52,445 --> 00:14:54,696
You're an expert at throwing parties.

286
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:55,904
If you're the lady of the penthouse,

287
00:14:55,988 --> 00:14:57,779
shouldn't you be able to manage it alone?

288
00:15:02,362 --> 00:15:03,487
Something urgent came up,

289
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:05,696
so I must go.

290
00:15:20,445 --> 00:15:21,362
Yes.

291
00:15:22,571 --> 00:15:23,487
Run along

292
00:15:25,487 --> 00:15:26,612
to Joo Dan Tae.

293
00:15:28,404 --> 00:15:30,821
I knew we'd be on the same page.

294
00:15:31,445 --> 00:15:32,821
"JKING Holdings"

295
00:15:32,904 --> 00:15:33,862
Okay, so,

296
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,737
I would have to talk further details

297
00:15:35,821 --> 00:15:36,988
with Ms Oh here, right?

298
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,280
"Yangjae Flower Market"

299
00:15:39,904 --> 00:15:40,946
You can do as you'd like.

300
00:15:41,571 --> 00:15:42,946
Are you free this weekend?

301
00:15:43,612 --> 00:15:44,904
We're having a party at Hera Palace,

302
00:15:44,988 --> 00:15:45,988
and I'd like to invite you.

303
00:15:46,238 --> 00:15:47,238
Oh.

304
00:15:47,654 --> 00:15:48,612
It would be an honour.

305
00:15:49,737 --> 00:15:51,654
I'd love to see the Hera Palace myself.

306
00:15:52,154 --> 00:15:53,612
I hear from Ms Oh here that

307
00:15:53,696 --> 00:15:55,154
there's a marvellous fountain there.

308
00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:56,988
I'll prepare the best party of your life.

309
00:15:57,821 --> 00:15:59,029
I'll be looking forward to it.

310
00:16:24,612 --> 00:16:25,612
Talk to you again soon.

311
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,821
Now, let's talk.

312
00:16:40,071 --> 00:16:41,196
Ms Oh,

313
00:16:41,571 --> 00:16:42,946
why do you want to get a job

314
00:16:43,029 --> 00:16:44,362
at my company of all places?

315
00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:46,280
I'm in need of money.

316
00:16:47,404 --> 00:16:49,362
I saw your job advertisement

317
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:50,862
for an experienced employee

318
00:16:50,946 --> 00:16:53,071
while I searched for a job.

319
00:16:53,988 --> 00:16:55,612
Then I did a bit of research to find out

320
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,821
what the chairman of JKING Holdings

321
00:16:57,904 --> 00:16:59,779
wants the most right now.

322
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:03,445
Luckily, Attorney Lee Kyu Jin

323
00:17:03,862 --> 00:17:05,362
quickly told me about

324
00:17:05,445 --> 00:17:06,946
a man named Logan Lee.

325
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:10,071
So Attorney Lee told you?

326
00:17:11,654 --> 00:17:12,696
Is your speciality in

327
00:17:13,321 --> 00:17:15,779
getting clingy with everyone and anyone?

328
00:17:15,862 --> 00:17:17,196
I used that speciality of mine

329
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,737
to persuade Logan Lee.

330
00:17:20,071 --> 00:17:21,862
Logan Lee came here today

331
00:17:21,946 --> 00:17:23,737
solely thanks to what I did.

332
00:17:23,946 --> 00:17:25,196
It wasn't you.

333
00:17:26,321 --> 00:17:27,362
If you wish to sell

334
00:17:27,404 --> 00:17:28,779
that land in Myeong-dong,

335
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,571
you'll need me from now on.

336
00:17:31,238 --> 00:17:32,196
Don't forget.

337
00:17:32,988 --> 00:17:33,904
Unlike how you look,

338
00:17:34,362 --> 00:17:35,654
you must have a knack for this.

339
00:17:37,988 --> 00:17:38,904
Fine.

340
00:17:39,196 --> 00:17:40,071
In that case,

341
00:17:40,571 --> 00:17:42,280
make sure you finish this job

342
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:43,737
and get him to sign the contract.

343
00:17:44,529 --> 00:17:46,154
But that's all you can do.

344
00:17:46,362 --> 00:17:47,696
As soon as I seal this contract,

345
00:17:48,113 --> 00:17:49,571
I don't think there's any reason

346
00:17:49,654 --> 00:17:50,779
for me to keep you around.

347
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:52,362
At that point,

348
00:17:53,445 --> 00:17:55,654
you might end up begging me to stay.

349
00:17:57,737 --> 00:17:58,696
Do you really think so?

350
00:18:09,529 --> 00:18:10,487
That crazy woman.

351
00:18:39,404 --> 00:18:40,362
Soo Ryeon.

352
00:18:40,862 --> 00:18:41,946
Cheon Seo Jin is here.

353
00:18:42,737 --> 00:18:43,612
Really?

354
00:18:44,362 --> 00:18:45,238
What about what I asked you?

355
00:18:45,321 --> 00:18:46,362
Don't worry.

356
00:18:47,612 --> 00:18:49,029
I hid it very well.

357
00:18:53,654 --> 00:18:54,487
What brings you here?

358
00:18:54,571 --> 00:18:55,571
I told you not to come to my office.

359
00:18:55,654 --> 00:18:57,445
So why didn't you pick up your phone?

360
00:18:57,529 --> 00:18:59,029
I was in an important meeting.

361
00:19:00,612 --> 00:19:02,779
Did you send this to me?

362
00:19:03,321 --> 00:19:04,988
What were you thinking when you sent this?

363
00:19:05,071 --> 00:19:05,946
What are you talking about?

364
00:19:06,029 --> 00:19:06,904
Why would I send this to you?

365
00:19:09,821 --> 00:19:10,862
It wasn't you?

366
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,029
Some flowers and this ring...

367
00:19:18,862 --> 00:19:20,154
were sent in your name.

368
00:19:20,362 --> 00:19:21,362
What?

369
00:19:23,238 --> 00:19:24,196
I threw that ring away

370
00:19:24,946 --> 00:19:26,238
in the rubbish bin at home

371
00:19:26,946 --> 00:19:28,612
on the day Min Seol A died.

372
00:19:29,529 --> 00:19:31,071
That happened months ago.

373
00:19:31,862 --> 00:19:33,113
And someone sent me that ring

374
00:19:33,196 --> 00:19:34,362
under your name.

375
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:36,862
This person knows what we did.

376
00:19:37,321 --> 00:19:39,029
They're trying to blackmail us!

377
00:19:39,238 --> 00:19:40,154
Lower your voice.

378
00:19:40,238 --> 00:19:41,071
There are a lot of ears around here.

379
00:19:45,862 --> 00:19:46,821
Don't be scared.

380
00:19:47,821 --> 00:19:48,696
Min Seol A

381
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:50,737
killed herself.

382
00:19:50,904 --> 00:19:51,862
You already know...

383
00:19:53,821 --> 00:19:54,904
she didn't kill herself.

384
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:59,196
The threatening letter with the eye.

385
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:02,154
The one who wrote that is after us.

386
00:20:02,362 --> 00:20:04,154
Director Min already died in prison.

387
00:20:04,445 --> 00:20:05,821
I said I took care of him already.

388
00:20:05,988 --> 00:20:07,154
It wasn't him.

389
00:20:07,779 --> 00:20:09,362
The letter, the flowers,

390
00:20:10,029 --> 00:20:11,071
and this ring.

391
00:20:13,154 --> 00:20:14,029
Sim Soo Ryeon.

392
00:20:14,988 --> 00:20:16,404
Your wife sent these to me.

393
00:20:17,196 --> 00:20:18,029
What?

394
00:20:19,779 --> 00:20:21,779
Why are you so suspicious of her?

395
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,445
Why would she do that?

396
00:20:23,696 --> 00:20:25,612
To expose what we did to Min Seol A!

397
00:20:26,487 --> 00:20:27,571
Don't you get it?

398
00:20:28,696 --> 00:20:31,487
She's trying to torture us to death!

399
00:20:31,571 --> 00:20:32,904
She wants to get her revenge!

400
00:20:33,862 --> 00:20:35,071
Your wife is

401
00:20:35,862 --> 00:20:37,238
somehow related to Min Seol A.

402
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:39,821
Min Seol A might be...

403
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,445
a daughter you didn't know she had.

404
00:20:45,529 --> 00:20:46,988
What kind of nonsense is this?

405
00:20:47,071 --> 00:20:48,362
It's not nonsense!

406
00:20:48,445 --> 00:20:49,904
Her daughter is already dead!

407
00:20:53,612 --> 00:20:54,445
What?

408
00:20:54,529 --> 00:20:55,571
The girl in the columbarium.

409
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,529
She gave birth to her before our marriage.

410
00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:01,029
The columbarium?

411
00:21:02,737 --> 00:21:04,487
How could he hide his ill daughter

412
00:21:04,571 --> 00:21:06,362
in the hospital all this time?

413
00:21:06,571 --> 00:21:07,654
I'm sorry

414
00:21:07,988 --> 00:21:09,154
for not telling you.

415
00:21:09,821 --> 00:21:11,779
Was she born

416
00:21:11,862 --> 00:21:13,487
out of wedlock?

417
00:21:16,362 --> 00:21:17,362
That girl

418
00:21:19,196 --> 00:21:20,737
wasn't your daughter?

419
00:21:22,737 --> 00:21:23,612
No.

420
00:21:25,445 --> 00:21:26,404
Before we got married,

421
00:21:26,862 --> 00:21:27,862
we both had

422
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,362
someone else in our lives.

423
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:30,779
And we each had kids.

424
00:21:31,904 --> 00:21:32,946
Seok Hoon and Seok Kyung

425
00:21:33,821 --> 00:21:35,029
aren't her biological children.

426
00:21:36,196 --> 00:21:37,321
I got remarried to her

427
00:21:37,487 --> 00:21:38,571
when they were still infants.

428
00:21:40,071 --> 00:21:42,113
And they grew up thinking she's their mum.

429
00:21:45,529 --> 00:21:47,280
I could've never imagined.

430
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,445
Seok Hoon and Seok Kyung aren't

431
00:21:49,529 --> 00:21:50,779
Soo Ryeon's biological children?

432
00:21:53,154 --> 00:21:54,654
Then where's her ex-husband?

433
00:21:57,196 --> 00:21:58,154
He died

434
00:21:59,821 --> 00:22:00,862
before the girl was born.

435
00:22:04,071 --> 00:22:05,029
I am...

436
00:22:07,696 --> 00:22:09,154
more suspicious of your husband.

437
00:22:09,737 --> 00:22:10,779
What do you mean?

438
00:22:11,238 --> 00:22:12,154
You threw out

439
00:22:13,321 --> 00:22:14,988
this ring in the rubbish bin at home.

440
00:22:15,612 --> 00:22:16,904
Then who could've got his hands on it?

441
00:22:18,487 --> 00:22:20,737
If your husband knows about us,

442
00:22:21,904 --> 00:22:22,779
wouldn't he want to threaten us

443
00:22:22,862 --> 00:22:24,071
by using Min Seol A?

444
00:22:25,571 --> 00:22:26,487
Could it be him?

445
00:22:28,612 --> 00:22:29,571
I doubt it.

446
00:22:30,862 --> 00:22:31,862
He can be a bit of an idiot,

447
00:22:33,362 --> 00:22:34,862
but he's not that low.

448
00:22:39,696 --> 00:22:41,362
Do you still trust him?

449
00:22:43,113 --> 00:22:44,196
Then let's check and see

450
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:46,737
who sent you

451
00:22:47,445 --> 00:22:48,445
the flowers and the ring.

452
00:22:51,696 --> 00:22:54,154
"Fairmont Ambassador Hotel"

453
00:22:54,612 --> 00:22:55,904
"Joo Dan Tae funded Cho Sang Heon"

454
00:22:57,862 --> 00:22:59,238
"Why was Seol A killed?"

455
00:23:05,321 --> 00:23:07,113
"Possible Suspects"

456
00:23:07,904 --> 00:23:08,821
"Lee Kyu Jin, Ko Sang A"

457
00:23:08,904 --> 00:23:09,821
"Joo Seok Hoon, Joo Seok Kyung"

458
00:23:09,904 --> 00:23:10,821
"Oh Yoon Hee, Cheon Seo Jin"

459
00:23:10,904 --> 00:23:11,779
"Anna Lee"

460
00:23:16,487 --> 00:23:18,821
Ms Oh was also at Hera Palace on the night

461
00:23:18,904 --> 00:23:20,321
of the fountain lighting ceremony.

462
00:23:20,487 --> 00:23:21,404
She was at Hera Palace?

463
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:24,362
Are you sure?

464
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:25,321
Yes, sir.

465
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:26,988
She went to Cheon Seo Jin's lesson room

466
00:23:27,071 --> 00:23:28,445
and made a big scene.

467
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:30,321
She was caught on security cameras,

468
00:23:30,862 --> 00:23:32,029
and Cheon Seo Jin's husband,

469
00:23:32,113 --> 00:23:33,196
Ha Yoon Chul, is the witness.

470
00:23:35,154 --> 00:23:36,071
Oh Yoon Hee.

471
00:23:37,612 --> 00:23:38,654
Her daughter got into

472
00:23:38,737 --> 00:23:40,445
Cheonga Arts High in Seol A's place,

473
00:23:41,445 --> 00:23:43,238
then the two women moved

474
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:44,487
to the flat in Bosong Village

475
00:23:44,571 --> 00:23:45,529
where Seol A used to live?

476
00:23:53,238 --> 00:23:55,321
"Possible Suspects"

477
00:23:55,362 --> 00:23:57,280
"Oh Yoon Hee"

478
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:00,571
Everything has been completed.

479
00:24:01,445 --> 00:24:02,487
Everyone who was

480
00:24:03,654 --> 00:24:05,154
at Hera Palace on that day and hour.

481
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,445
The suspects for Seol A's murder.

482
00:24:13,238 --> 00:24:14,779
Eun Byeol, what are you doing?

483
00:24:14,862 --> 00:24:15,988
You might fall down.

484
00:24:16,071 --> 00:24:17,029
Dad.

485
00:24:17,238 --> 00:24:18,404
I have to memorise everything

486
00:24:18,487 --> 00:24:19,696
for my midterm until tomorrow.

487
00:24:19,946 --> 00:24:21,529
Goodness, my girl.

488
00:24:23,946 --> 00:24:24,862
Hello.

489
00:24:24,946 --> 00:24:25,821
Hey, Ro Na.

490
00:24:27,654 --> 00:24:29,113
Isn't it great to live in Hera Palace?

491
00:24:29,196 --> 00:24:30,196
It is. - Your friends are here too.

492
00:24:30,487 --> 00:24:31,362
Yes.

493
00:24:31,404 --> 00:24:32,280
All right.

494
00:24:32,946 --> 00:24:34,280
Are you feeling better?

495
00:24:35,904 --> 00:24:37,529
Who asked you to worry about me?

496
00:24:37,946 --> 00:24:39,654
And don't lay a finger on my stuff

497
00:24:39,737 --> 00:24:41,280
with your disgusting hands!

498
00:24:42,445 --> 00:24:44,445
Do you want to get on my dad's good side?

499
00:24:44,779 --> 00:24:45,696
Eun Byeol.

500
00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:47,404
Why are you so mean to your friend?

501
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:48,404
"Friend"?

502
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:50,071
She's not my friend.

503
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,904
I don't keep a girl like her as a friend.

504
00:24:53,362 --> 00:24:54,362
And can't the elevators

505
00:24:54,404 --> 00:24:55,696
for the upper and lower levels

506
00:24:55,779 --> 00:24:56,737
be completely separated?

507
00:24:57,445 --> 00:24:58,821
How long do I have to live my life

508
00:24:58,904 --> 00:25:00,196
running into her like this?

509
00:25:00,362 --> 00:25:01,571
This is so annoying!

510
00:25:02,988 --> 00:25:03,862
Eun Byeol!

511
00:25:04,238 --> 00:25:05,612
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

512
00:25:10,445 --> 00:25:11,654
Eun Byeol. Eun Byeol!

513
00:25:18,404 --> 00:25:19,362
Did you look into it?

514
00:25:19,862 --> 00:25:20,946
Some man ordered those flowers

515
00:25:21,029 --> 00:25:22,196
to be delivered to you.

516
00:25:22,696 --> 00:25:23,612
And

517
00:25:24,196 --> 00:25:25,821
the number he left was Dr Ha's number.

518
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,904
I covered up your medical malpractice,

519
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,946
and you repay me with this prank?

520
00:25:36,113 --> 00:25:38,862
So you want to be a loser to the end?

521
00:25:44,238 --> 00:25:45,321
Eun Byeol, what's wrong?

522
00:25:46,362 --> 00:25:47,862
Stop right there. We need to talk.

523
00:25:47,988 --> 00:25:49,154
I don't want to talk to you!

524
00:25:52,529 --> 00:25:53,529
What's going on?

525
00:25:55,321 --> 00:25:56,280
Don't you know

526
00:25:56,779 --> 00:25:58,238
why she became that sensitive?

527
00:25:58,988 --> 00:26:00,280
You should've given her a break.

528
00:26:00,362 --> 00:26:02,445
Why did you stress her out over midterm?

529
00:26:02,529 --> 00:26:04,946
I think you're stressing her out.

530
00:26:06,362 --> 00:26:07,404
You're blaming me again?

531
00:26:07,696 --> 00:26:08,696
Eun Byeol is my daughter,

532
00:26:08,779 --> 00:26:09,904
and I know her best.

533
00:26:10,362 --> 00:26:12,029
So stop meddling with her while she's busy

534
00:26:12,113 --> 00:26:13,404
studying for her test.

535
00:26:16,029 --> 00:26:17,779
I don't expect you to be my husband.

536
00:26:18,487 --> 00:26:19,404
But do the least you can

537
00:26:19,487 --> 00:26:20,529
and try to copy what other dads do.

538
00:26:31,946 --> 00:26:32,946
My reference books.

539
00:26:33,362 --> 00:26:34,362
My workbooks.

540
00:26:36,696 --> 00:26:37,612
Eun Byeol.

541
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:39,321
Where are my reference books?

542
00:26:40,113 --> 00:26:41,321
Did you throw them out?

543
00:26:42,487 --> 00:26:44,654
Do you want me to do worse than Ro Na?

544
00:26:45,321 --> 00:26:46,154
What?

545
00:26:46,238 --> 00:26:47,779
Why were you so nice to her?

546
00:26:48,238 --> 00:26:50,113
Don't you know how much I hate her?

547
00:26:50,445 --> 00:26:51,321
I don't even want to breathe

548
00:26:51,362 --> 00:26:52,238
the same air as that girl.

549
00:26:52,321 --> 00:26:53,362
Why did you talk to her

550
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:54,321
and treat her nicely?

551
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:56,362
Because she's your classmate.

552
00:26:57,737 --> 00:26:58,696
Why?

553
00:26:59,238 --> 00:27:00,612
Do you feel bad for her?

554
00:27:01,362 --> 00:27:02,362
Are you worried about her

555
00:27:02,445 --> 00:27:03,904
because she's your first love's daughter?

556
00:27:05,321 --> 00:27:06,654
Do you feel that bad for her

557
00:27:06,737 --> 00:27:08,154
for growing up without a dad?

558
00:27:08,696 --> 00:27:09,654
What...

559
00:27:09,737 --> 00:27:11,654
What kind of nonsense is this?

560
00:27:11,737 --> 00:27:13,238
Mum told me everything.

561
00:27:13,779 --> 00:27:15,571
I heard you're seeing her mum.

562
00:27:15,946 --> 00:27:16,821
Eun Byeol.

563
00:27:16,904 --> 00:27:17,821
Did you want to leave us

564
00:27:17,904 --> 00:27:19,487
to be with your first love?

565
00:27:19,904 --> 00:27:21,904
Is that why you're nice to Ro Na?

566
00:27:22,862 --> 00:27:23,737
Why are you saying that?

567
00:27:23,821 --> 00:27:24,696
Don't listen to anything Mum says.

568
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:27,280
I love you the most in this world.

569
00:27:27,362 --> 00:27:28,321
You liar!

570
00:27:28,862 --> 00:27:30,737
You looked at her with a smile.

571
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,571
You aren't on my side.

572
00:27:34,321 --> 00:27:35,445
That's a misunderstanding.

573
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:36,946
Will you please hear me out?

574
00:27:37,862 --> 00:27:39,529
Mum is the only one who thinks of me.

575
00:27:39,612 --> 00:27:41,737
Do you know what she did for me?

576
00:27:42,071 --> 00:27:43,280
Min Seol A was...

577
00:27:49,445 --> 00:27:51,612
Bring my reference books back now!

578
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:52,737
If you don't,

579
00:27:53,779 --> 00:27:54,779
I will

580
00:27:55,154 --> 00:27:57,071
kill myself like Min Seol A did.

581
00:27:58,529 --> 00:27:59,445
What...

582
00:28:01,362 --> 00:28:02,654
What happened to you?

583
00:28:04,362 --> 00:28:06,362
Since when did you become such a wreck?

584
00:28:08,904 --> 00:28:09,904
I'm sick of this.

585
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,862
You're a coward,

586
00:28:13,196 --> 00:28:15,238
and you're the worst dad in this world.

587
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:17,238
Get out!

588
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:18,654
I don't even want to see you,

589
00:28:18,737 --> 00:28:20,113
so get out of my room!

590
00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:41,862
You!

591
00:28:44,113 --> 00:28:45,862
Why did you tell her about Yoon Hee?

592
00:28:46,071 --> 00:28:47,571
Do you have to break her heart too?

593
00:28:47,737 --> 00:28:48,654
Why?

594
00:28:48,821 --> 00:28:50,238
It's not like I made it up.

595
00:28:51,071 --> 00:28:52,445
Don't you think she should know the truth

596
00:28:52,529 --> 00:28:54,487
if she wants to fight against Ro Na?

597
00:28:55,946 --> 00:28:56,862
Wait, did you do that

598
00:28:58,029 --> 00:28:59,571
to make her more competitive?

599
00:29:02,071 --> 00:29:04,113
You really make me shudder.

600
00:29:05,238 --> 00:29:06,362
You're not the one to talk.

601
00:29:06,946 --> 00:29:08,654
You acted as if you'll leave quietly,

602
00:29:08,737 --> 00:29:10,154
then went out and did dirty things

603
00:29:10,238 --> 00:29:11,154
behind my back.

604
00:29:11,779 --> 00:29:12,696
I guess you got excited

605
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:13,904
for finding my weakness.

606
00:29:14,196 --> 00:29:15,154
If you want Eun Byeol

607
00:29:15,238 --> 00:29:16,404
to keep treating you as her dad,

608
00:29:16,487 --> 00:29:19,029
shut your mouth, lie low,

609
00:29:19,113 --> 00:29:20,280
then sign the divorce paper.

610
00:29:20,529 --> 00:29:22,362
What makes you so confident?

611
00:29:22,862 --> 00:29:24,113
Should I let the world find out

612
00:29:24,196 --> 00:29:25,362
about everything you did?

613
00:29:27,154 --> 00:29:28,988
If you got the nerves, go ahead.

614
00:29:29,362 --> 00:29:31,362
You'll end up looking like an idiot.

615
00:29:31,946 --> 00:29:32,946
Are you sure you'll be fine?

616
00:29:36,238 --> 00:29:37,654
Let's play fair

617
00:29:37,737 --> 00:29:39,071
until the day we get divorced.

618
00:29:39,946 --> 00:29:42,113
You aren't showing good manners

619
00:29:42,654 --> 00:29:44,154
to someone you lived with for 17 years

620
00:29:44,238 --> 00:29:45,737
by stabbing me in the back like this.

621
00:29:50,404 --> 00:29:51,362
Goodness.

622
00:29:54,154 --> 00:29:55,071
Do not

623
00:29:55,946 --> 00:29:57,196
provoke me anymore.

624
00:29:58,196 --> 00:29:59,612
I won't condone this any longer.

625
00:30:03,487 --> 00:30:04,404
Unbelievable.

626
00:30:32,904 --> 00:30:34,487
The letter, the flowers,

627
00:30:35,113 --> 00:30:36,196
and this ring.

628
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,238
Sim Soo Ryeon.

629
00:30:39,196 --> 00:30:40,696
Your wife sent these to me.

630
00:30:41,821 --> 00:30:44,571
She's trying to torture us to death!

631
00:30:44,654 --> 00:30:45,946
She wants to get her revenge!

632
00:30:47,404 --> 00:30:48,571
Is that all?

633
00:30:49,196 --> 00:30:50,445
Is there anyone else we should invite?

634
00:30:51,821 --> 00:30:52,779
There is.

635
00:30:55,696 --> 00:30:56,654
His name is Logan Lee.

636
00:30:56,988 --> 00:30:57,862
He's an important guest,

637
00:30:57,946 --> 00:30:58,988
so pay extra attention to him.

638
00:30:59,362 --> 00:31:01,362
Isn't he the guy you had to meet?

639
00:31:02,238 --> 00:31:03,862
I guess you finally reached him.

640
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:05,487
I'm so relieved.

641
00:31:06,862 --> 00:31:09,113
I also want to see what he's like.

642
00:31:09,529 --> 00:31:10,612
And one more.

643
00:31:11,238 --> 00:31:12,529
You can invite Unit 4502.

644
00:31:13,529 --> 00:31:14,529
You mean, Yoon Hee?

645
00:31:16,154 --> 00:31:17,154
May I do that?

646
00:31:17,321 --> 00:31:18,612
I don't really want to,

647
00:31:18,696 --> 00:31:20,362
but she's involved with Logan Lee.

648
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:22,238
I have to invite her against my will.

649
00:31:23,029 --> 00:31:23,988
I guess she's meant to be

650
00:31:24,071 --> 00:31:25,238
someone that's helpful for you.

651
00:31:25,445 --> 00:31:26,529
Don't be so mean to her.

652
00:31:26,612 --> 00:31:27,946
Try to treat her nicely.

653
00:31:29,612 --> 00:31:32,154
Something about her feels very eerie.

654
00:31:32,321 --> 00:31:33,821
I have no idea what she's thinking.

655
00:31:35,988 --> 00:31:37,946
Then I'll give her the invitation myself.

656
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:40,029
It's very exciting to think

657
00:31:40,113 --> 00:31:41,238
everyone in Hera Club

658
00:31:41,321 --> 00:31:42,404
will get together for once.

659
00:31:43,946 --> 00:31:45,696
Let's go get some dresses tomorrow.

660
00:31:46,445 --> 00:31:48,362
Logan Lee has a very picky taste.

661
00:31:49,321 --> 00:31:50,362
Really?

662
00:31:51,113 --> 00:31:53,071
I was worried about what I should wear.

663
00:31:55,988 --> 00:31:57,571
"Yang Mi Ok"

664
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:05,696
Yes, Ms Yang?

665
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,362
The chairman is

666
00:32:07,404 --> 00:32:08,487
throwing a party this weekend.

667
00:32:08,988 --> 00:32:10,946
They also talked about

668
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:12,779
going dress shopping tomorrow.

669
00:32:13,362 --> 00:32:14,321
Really?

670
00:32:15,862 --> 00:32:17,654
All right. Thanks for your help.

671
00:32:21,904 --> 00:32:24,904
Why is Ms Sim taking so much time?

672
00:32:27,321 --> 00:32:28,529
What's her plan?

673
00:32:40,404 --> 00:32:41,321
What do you think?

674
00:32:42,362 --> 00:32:43,362
You look great.

675
00:32:44,654 --> 00:32:47,071
I knew you'd look great in everything.

676
00:32:47,737 --> 00:32:49,487
You look stunning, Ms Sim.

677
00:32:49,737 --> 00:32:50,654
You look great in everything,

678
00:32:50,737 --> 00:32:52,154
so I don't know what I should recommend.

679
00:32:52,487 --> 00:32:53,654
You should choose one for me.

680
00:32:54,321 --> 00:32:55,946
If you like it, I like it too.

681
00:32:56,862 --> 00:32:57,821
Try that on too.

682
00:32:58,612 --> 00:32:59,988
Everything needs to be the best.

683
00:33:01,238 --> 00:33:03,696
You must stand out at tomorrow's party.

684
00:33:04,654 --> 00:33:05,946
I'll take everything she tried on.

685
00:33:06,445 --> 00:33:07,362
Go on.

686
00:33:25,071 --> 00:33:26,445
I'll take that scarf too.

687
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:27,862
Yes, Ms Sim.

688
00:33:42,571 --> 00:33:43,529
What's wrong?

689
00:33:46,654 --> 00:33:48,696
No, nothing.

690
00:33:55,362 --> 00:33:57,362
You look very beautiful,

691
00:33:58,238 --> 00:33:59,529
Seol A's mother.

692
00:33:59,988 --> 00:34:01,196
What are you doing here?

693
00:34:01,821 --> 00:34:02,946
How did you know I was here?

694
00:34:03,238 --> 00:34:05,196
I know everything about you.

695
00:34:06,404 --> 00:34:07,654
You seemed very relaxed before.

696
00:34:08,779 --> 00:34:09,904
Why are you so scared?

697
00:34:11,196 --> 00:34:12,029
Why?

698
00:34:12,113 --> 00:34:13,821
You ignored my warning

699
00:34:14,654 --> 00:34:16,737
and came here to get ready for the party

700
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:17,946
with your husband.

701
00:34:18,362 --> 00:34:19,404
Stop minding my business

702
00:34:19,487 --> 00:34:20,404
and get out of here.

703
00:34:22,154 --> 00:34:24,280
Ms Sim, may I go in?

704
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:25,362
Let me help you.

705
00:34:25,779 --> 00:34:27,154
No, I can do this alone.

706
00:34:29,487 --> 00:34:30,404
I changed

707
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:33,238
my mind.

708
00:34:34,988 --> 00:34:36,862
At tomorrow's party, let's tell everyone

709
00:34:37,654 --> 00:34:39,737
you're Min Seol A's mum.

710
00:34:40,862 --> 00:34:41,821
What?

711
00:34:41,988 --> 00:34:44,071
It'd be more fun with more audience.

712
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,612
It's a perfect day

713
00:34:47,571 --> 00:34:49,154
for a surprise.

714
00:34:49,362 --> 00:34:50,946
I'll tell them when the right time comes.

715
00:34:51,029 --> 00:34:52,238
So you need to stay out of this.

716
00:34:53,445 --> 00:34:54,654
I already told you

717
00:34:55,029 --> 00:34:56,280
that I won't let you go on

718
00:34:56,362 --> 00:34:57,487
if you meddle with my business again.

719
00:34:58,946 --> 00:35:00,612
Tomorrow is the D-Day.

720
00:35:01,445 --> 00:35:03,071
And I am not going to negotiate.

721
00:35:04,571 --> 00:35:06,487
On top of that, everyone who knows Seol A

722
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:08,404
will be at the party tomorrow.

723
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:12,445
Don't you think it's a perfect occasion?

724
00:35:12,862 --> 00:35:14,154
Give me just a little more time.

725
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,238
There's something I must do.

726
00:35:16,321 --> 00:35:17,321
Hey, lady.

727
00:35:25,946 --> 00:35:26,904
Hey, lady.

728
00:35:28,029 --> 00:35:31,321
Why should I care about your situation?

729
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:32,821
I'm not that nice.

730
00:35:33,071 --> 00:35:34,862
I've already been punished.

731
00:35:36,946 --> 00:35:38,154
I'm not happy.

732
00:35:44,862 --> 00:35:45,988
Are you done getting changed?

733
00:35:48,362 --> 00:35:49,404
What are you doing?

734
00:35:49,487 --> 00:35:50,404
You have to go, please.

735
00:36:00,487 --> 00:36:01,404
Honey?

736
00:36:06,238 --> 00:36:07,113
What's wrong?

737
00:36:07,196 --> 00:36:08,113
Goodness, are you okay?

738
00:36:09,862 --> 00:36:10,779
I'm fine.

739
00:36:11,404 --> 00:36:12,487
I just got dizzy.

740
00:36:13,821 --> 00:36:14,779
I guess I worked too hard

741
00:36:14,862 --> 00:36:15,862
getting ready for the party.

742
00:36:16,362 --> 00:36:17,321
I'm sorry.

743
00:36:19,154 --> 00:36:20,362
I'll get changed and come out.

744
00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:22,071
All right.

745
00:36:36,737 --> 00:36:37,779
Don't forget.

746
00:36:40,238 --> 00:36:41,321
Tomorrow is the day.

747
00:37:01,404 --> 00:37:03,612
"Cheonga Arts High School"

748
00:37:04,445 --> 00:37:06,154
Why did you gather us this time?

749
00:37:06,238 --> 00:37:07,196
I was so worried,

750
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,529
thinking something happened.

751
00:37:09,029 --> 00:37:10,029
I think

752
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,196
the person who's impersonating Min Seol A

753
00:37:12,696 --> 00:37:13,821
is Ro Na.

754
00:37:15,487 --> 00:37:16,445
Bae Ro Na?

755
00:37:16,529 --> 00:37:18,946
That shoe suddenly disappeared at school,

756
00:37:19,029 --> 00:37:20,696
and she's the only one

757
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:21,862
connected to Min Seol A.

758
00:37:21,946 --> 00:37:24,362
Oh, you're right.

759
00:37:24,571 --> 00:37:26,529
She lived in Min Seol A's flat.

760
00:37:26,821 --> 00:37:28,196
And Ro Na was accepted

761
00:37:28,321 --> 00:37:30,362
in Min Seol A's place after she died.

762
00:37:30,612 --> 00:37:31,904
Then she moved to Bosong Village.

763
00:37:31,988 --> 00:37:33,029
Everything seems so fishy.

764
00:37:33,113 --> 00:37:34,571
And she even came to live at Hera Palace.

765
00:37:34,654 --> 00:37:35,696
Isn't it so odd?

766
00:37:36,321 --> 00:37:37,404
Did she plan all of this?

767
00:37:37,654 --> 00:37:39,071
What if

768
00:37:39,154 --> 00:37:41,029
she's possessed by Min Seol A's ghost?

769
00:37:42,071 --> 00:37:43,321
Enough!

770
00:37:46,779 --> 00:37:48,362
That's just your speculation.

771
00:37:49,404 --> 00:37:51,946
There's no proof that Ro Na did it.

772
00:37:52,612 --> 00:37:54,612
Proof? We'll look for it.

773
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,238
How?

774
00:37:56,321 --> 00:37:57,654
Do you have an idea?

775
00:37:58,696 --> 00:37:59,988
Just leave it to me.

776
00:38:13,113 --> 00:38:14,404
Hey, Ro Na.

777
00:38:14,779 --> 00:38:16,529
What are you doing? Studying English?

778
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,737
Look at this. You got everything wrong.

779
00:38:18,821 --> 00:38:19,904
Give it back. - You wish.

780
00:38:19,988 --> 00:38:21,821
Give it back! - No. No way.

781
00:38:25,071 --> 00:38:26,029
I got it.

782
00:38:28,362 --> 00:38:29,362
What?

783
00:38:29,445 --> 00:38:31,029
There's no group chat.

784
00:38:32,029 --> 00:38:33,445
She probably deleted it already.

785
00:38:36,154 --> 00:38:37,154
Enough already.

786
00:38:37,238 --> 00:38:38,904
Why snoop through her phone? - Wait!

787
00:38:42,029 --> 00:38:43,071
This dog...

788
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:54,654
No way. Is it the same dog?

789
00:38:56,779 --> 00:38:58,154
"Sugar"

790
00:38:58,946 --> 00:39:00,029
"Sugar"

791
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:02,113
"Sugar"?

792
00:39:03,029 --> 00:39:04,571
So it was really Ro Na?

793
00:39:05,154 --> 00:39:06,113
She pretended to be Min Seol A

794
00:39:06,196 --> 00:39:07,238
and threatened us?

795
00:39:09,487 --> 00:39:10,654
Can you still deny it?

796
00:39:11,071 --> 00:39:12,904
See for yourself.

797
00:39:13,029 --> 00:39:15,196
They're holding the same dog.

798
00:39:15,737 --> 00:39:16,737
Is this a coincidence?

799
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:18,487
See? What did I say?

800
00:39:18,571 --> 00:39:20,321
I told you that it was Ro Na.

801
00:39:20,487 --> 00:39:22,362
Gosh, I can't believe this.

802
00:39:22,988 --> 00:39:24,445
This is serious.

803
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:26,821
Gosh, that brat toyed with us.

804
00:39:27,154 --> 00:39:28,071
Bae Ro Na.

805
00:39:28,571 --> 00:39:30,196
Why did I try to be nice to her?

806
00:39:30,612 --> 00:39:32,321
She's really something.

807
00:39:39,196 --> 00:39:40,321
Earlier, I sent some materials

808
00:39:40,362 --> 00:39:42,321
on the lot in Myeong-dong

809
00:39:42,362 --> 00:39:43,362
to your secretary.

810
00:39:43,654 --> 00:39:45,029
Did you see it?

811
00:39:45,154 --> 00:39:46,362
Oh, no. Not yet.

812
00:39:46,654 --> 00:39:48,113
That's not my priority at the moment.

813
00:39:49,362 --> 00:39:50,445
Listen.

814
00:39:50,571 --> 00:39:52,154
I met with Mr Joo because

815
00:39:52,238 --> 00:39:54,029
you desperately asked me for a favour.

816
00:39:54,238 --> 00:39:55,404
That didn't mean that I was going

817
00:39:55,487 --> 00:39:56,946
to sign the contract right away.

818
00:39:57,487 --> 00:39:58,612
A contract

819
00:39:58,737 --> 00:40:00,862
is made between two people, so...

820
00:40:01,654 --> 00:40:02,529
wouldn't it be nice to know

821
00:40:02,612 --> 00:40:03,821
what kind of people I'm dealing with?

822
00:40:04,196 --> 00:40:05,988
Of course I understand.

823
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,571
That being said,

824
00:40:10,029 --> 00:40:11,362
what kind of person are you,

825
00:40:12,113 --> 00:40:13,113
Ms Oh?

826
00:40:13,196 --> 00:40:14,362
Me?

827
00:40:16,029 --> 00:40:17,737
What exactly do you mean?

828
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,487
I heard you were admitted into Hera Palace

829
00:40:20,612 --> 00:40:22,487
in a very dramatic way.

830
00:40:23,196 --> 00:40:26,196
You bought some old, beat-down apartment

831
00:40:26,696 --> 00:40:28,238
and made some big money out of it?

832
00:40:28,445 --> 00:40:29,445
Oh, that.

833
00:40:29,862 --> 00:40:32,238
Chairman Joo must've told you.

834
00:40:33,196 --> 00:40:34,529
There was a bit of a situation.

835
00:40:36,196 --> 00:40:37,238
"Situation"?

836
00:40:39,321 --> 00:40:41,280
I wonder what that situation was.

837
00:40:41,696 --> 00:40:43,404
That apartment was listed

838
00:40:43,487 --> 00:40:45,321
way under the market price.

839
00:40:45,904 --> 00:40:46,904
A young girl

840
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:50,029
died there.

841
00:40:50,988 --> 00:40:52,154
A suicide, apparently.

842
00:40:54,029 --> 00:40:55,029
Suicide?

843
00:40:56,696 --> 00:40:58,362
And you still decided to go

844
00:40:58,445 --> 00:41:00,196
with the purchase because...

845
00:41:01,737 --> 00:41:04,280
Of course I had no idea at first.

846
00:41:04,946 --> 00:41:06,362
But for some odd reason,

847
00:41:06,696 --> 00:41:09,029
living there didn't spook me out.

848
00:41:11,362 --> 00:41:13,654
I actually met that girl once,

849
00:41:14,696 --> 00:41:16,737
and she was very kind.

850
00:41:19,612 --> 00:41:21,113
Did you guys know each other well?

851
00:41:22,362 --> 00:41:23,362
No, just a little.

852
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,737
Had she had parents,

853
00:41:28,862 --> 00:41:31,196
she wouldn't have died like that.

854
00:41:36,988 --> 00:41:38,071
"Hera Club"

855
00:41:38,154 --> 00:41:39,362
"Oh Yoon Hee, Anna Lee"

856
00:41:39,404 --> 00:41:40,654
"Little Hera Club"

857
00:41:45,196 --> 00:41:46,238
You...

858
00:41:47,737 --> 00:41:48,612
Did you really mean

859
00:41:48,696 --> 00:41:49,904
what you said about Seol A?

860
00:41:49,988 --> 00:41:51,071
"Moved to Hera Palace from Bosong Village"

861
00:41:51,154 --> 00:41:52,029
"after Seol A's death"

862
00:41:52,113 --> 00:41:53,029
"Daughter got into Cheonga Arts High"

863
00:42:03,904 --> 00:42:05,029
"Hera Palace"

864
00:42:05,321 --> 00:42:07,571
"Mr Logan Lee, you've been invited"

865
00:42:07,654 --> 00:42:09,029
"to Hera Club's private party."

866
00:42:09,113 --> 00:42:10,196
"From Joo Dan Tae and Sim Soo Ryeon"

867
00:42:16,029 --> 00:42:17,154
Wait and see.

868
00:42:18,362 --> 00:42:20,904
It'll be a party you'll never forget.

869
00:42:36,946 --> 00:42:37,946
Gosh.

870
00:43:07,113 --> 00:43:08,529
What are you doing here?

871
00:43:08,654 --> 00:43:09,988
Ms Oh?

872
00:43:11,529 --> 00:43:13,154
What happened to your face?

873
00:43:13,404 --> 00:43:14,779
Did something happen?

874
00:43:16,113 --> 00:43:17,071
People at Hera Palace

875
00:43:17,154 --> 00:43:18,154
are trying to kill me.

876
00:43:18,696 --> 00:43:20,113
I'm so scared.

877
00:43:20,196 --> 00:43:21,280
Please help me.

878
00:43:21,404 --> 00:43:23,321
Help me. I don't want to die, Ms Oh.

879
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,362
That's right.

880
00:43:31,238 --> 00:43:33,238
She said "people at Hera Palace".

881
00:43:33,321 --> 00:43:34,612
I clearly remember it.

882
00:43:36,362 --> 00:43:37,612
I'm sure of it.

883
00:44:20,238 --> 00:44:22,779
When you see me with this scarf on,

884
00:44:23,946 --> 00:44:25,238
consider it a sign

885
00:44:26,821 --> 00:44:28,280
that I'll make you mine.

886
00:44:28,654 --> 00:44:29,612
I see.

887
00:44:51,737 --> 00:44:52,779
Why was Seol A

888
00:44:53,113 --> 00:44:55,404
at Hera Palace that day?

889
00:44:56,696 --> 00:44:57,654
No way.

890
00:44:58,654 --> 00:44:59,821
What if it wasn't a suicide?

891
00:45:00,654 --> 00:45:02,654
Did someone kill her?

892
00:45:05,737 --> 00:45:06,904
No, that is absurd.

893
00:45:11,445 --> 00:45:13,487
Mum. - Hey, Ro Na.

894
00:45:13,612 --> 00:45:15,779
These must be from Ms Sim.

895
00:45:16,238 --> 00:45:17,238
All of those?

896
00:45:18,571 --> 00:45:19,612
My gosh.

897
00:45:25,779 --> 00:45:26,904
My gosh.

898
00:45:27,571 --> 00:45:29,362
Did she send this for you?

899
00:45:29,862 --> 00:45:31,321
This dress is so beautiful.

900
00:45:31,362 --> 00:45:33,113
It's something you'd see in a movie.

901
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,571
Be confident.

902
00:45:34,654 --> 00:45:35,862
Don't be intimidated.

903
00:45:36,487 --> 00:45:39,071
You're the star of the night, Yoon Hee.

904
00:45:41,988 --> 00:45:44,196
She has such amazing taste.

905
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,321
Try it on, Mum.

906
00:45:45,362 --> 00:45:46,362
It's stunning.

907
00:45:46,946 --> 00:45:48,071
Come on. Put it on.

908
00:45:48,696 --> 00:45:49,737
It's so exquisite that

909
00:45:50,071 --> 00:45:51,529
I don't know if I can actually wear it.

910
00:45:51,904 --> 00:45:53,529
The colour and design are amazing.

911
00:45:53,612 --> 00:45:55,321
Why did she send so many things?

912
00:45:55,362 --> 00:45:56,988
Mum, try this on.

913
00:46:03,321 --> 00:46:05,737
Does it look nice? - You look radiant.

914
00:46:05,946 --> 00:46:07,113
You look like Hera,

915
00:46:07,196 --> 00:46:08,445
the deity of prosperity and honour.

916
00:46:08,696 --> 00:46:09,862
Gosh, stop it.

917
00:46:13,821 --> 00:46:15,280
This is really nice.

918
00:46:16,821 --> 00:46:17,988
I need to talk to you.

919
00:46:18,362 --> 00:46:20,362
Meet me in the community room at 6?

920
00:46:22,071 --> 00:46:23,071
Ro Na.

921
00:46:23,779 --> 00:46:24,821
Ta-da.

922
00:46:25,737 --> 00:46:27,238
"Bae Ro Na: Okay, see you later"

923
00:46:47,071 --> 00:46:48,654
Mission cleared!

924
00:46:56,404 --> 00:46:57,487
On a night like this,

925
00:46:57,571 --> 00:46:59,196
one drink isn't enough. - That's right.

926
00:47:01,904 --> 00:47:02,904
My gosh.

927
00:47:02,988 --> 00:47:04,737
I have to say, Chairman Joo and his wife

928
00:47:04,821 --> 00:47:06,988
put a lot of work into organising this.

929
00:47:07,071 --> 00:47:08,654
They hired hotel chefs,

930
00:47:08,737 --> 00:47:10,362
and all the dishes are very special.

931
00:47:12,571 --> 00:47:14,821
Is Logan Lee that important?

932
00:47:15,071 --> 00:47:17,321
He can't be more important than you.

933
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:21,571
Sang A, please.

934
00:47:22,029 --> 00:47:23,571
Are you serious?

935
00:47:23,779 --> 00:47:25,238
Don't you know who Logan Lee is?

936
00:47:26,196 --> 00:47:28,113
His father is James Lee,

937
00:47:28,196 --> 00:47:30,445
the most successful Korean American ever.

938
00:47:31,029 --> 00:47:33,529
I must say, you really don't know much

939
00:47:33,946 --> 00:47:35,862
for someone who's highly educated.

940
00:47:35,946 --> 00:47:37,321
This is why I tell you

941
00:47:37,362 --> 00:47:38,737
to read the newspapers.

942
00:47:39,321 --> 00:47:41,654
Honey, wouldn't it be so nice

943
00:47:41,737 --> 00:47:43,404
if you could help me build connections

944
00:47:43,487 --> 00:47:44,571
on an occasion like this?

945
00:47:44,654 --> 00:47:46,154
You know? - That is why

946
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:48,571
I'm all dressed up like this.

947
00:47:48,904 --> 00:47:50,862
Not everyone can do that.

948
00:47:50,988 --> 00:47:53,238
You need to be on Chairman Joo's level

949
00:47:53,362 --> 00:47:55,862
to connect with a hotshot like him.

950
00:47:56,696 --> 00:47:58,196
There's obviously a reason

951
00:47:58,321 --> 00:48:01,029
why they live in the penthouse.

952
00:48:02,362 --> 00:48:04,029
There she is, the penthouse lady.

953
00:48:04,696 --> 00:48:07,821
Gosh, look who's here! - Soo Ryeon.

954
00:48:08,362 --> 00:48:09,654
That dress looks new.

955
00:48:09,737 --> 00:48:11,487
You look stunning.

956
00:48:11,737 --> 00:48:12,988
And that scarf goes very well

957
00:48:13,071 --> 00:48:14,487
with the dress.

958
00:48:14,571 --> 00:48:15,988
My husband got them for me.

959
00:48:16,071 --> 00:48:17,362
It's a special day, you know.

960
00:48:17,612 --> 00:48:18,779
Of course.

961
00:48:18,904 --> 00:48:21,612
Chairman Joo has such exquisite taste.

962
00:48:21,821 --> 00:48:24,529
Gosh, I wish my husband were here today.

963
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:28,612
Where's Chairman Joo?

964
00:48:28,737 --> 00:48:30,321
He went to greet Logan Lee.

965
00:48:30,362 --> 00:48:31,737
He'll be here shortly.

966
00:48:32,029 --> 00:48:34,029
I should wait outside.

967
00:48:34,321 --> 00:48:35,487
First impressions are important.

968
00:48:35,571 --> 00:48:36,696
Yes, of course.

969
00:48:41,362 --> 00:48:42,362
Oh, my.

970
00:48:42,445 --> 00:48:44,280
My gosh, Ms Cheon. - Ms Cheon.

971
00:48:47,821 --> 00:48:48,779
Gosh.

972
00:48:50,779 --> 00:48:51,737
That scarf...

973
00:48:52,196 --> 00:48:54,362
You two are wearing the same scarf.

974
00:49:00,779 --> 00:49:02,321
What? Soo Ryeon said she got hers

975
00:49:02,362 --> 00:49:03,487
from Chairman Joo.

976
00:49:03,779 --> 00:49:06,154
I doubt Dr Ha bought that for Ms Cheon.

977
00:49:06,571 --> 00:49:09,196
Ms Cheon, did you pick it yourself?

978
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:10,988
Why did you have to buy that one?

979
00:49:11,071 --> 00:49:12,154
Stop it.

980
00:49:15,238 --> 00:49:16,862
We somehow showed up with the same scarf.

981
00:49:17,779 --> 00:49:20,487
I don't like to wear what others have.

982
00:49:20,654 --> 00:49:21,779
Is that so?

983
00:49:21,862 --> 00:49:23,946
I thought it was the opposite.

984
00:49:24,904 --> 00:49:26,113
I thought you were cool with it,

985
00:49:26,238 --> 00:49:27,821
using and wearing what others have.

986
00:49:29,737 --> 00:49:31,487
It doesn't bother me, so keep it on.

987
00:49:32,154 --> 00:49:33,154
I'm sure you took the time

988
00:49:33,238 --> 00:49:34,362
to pick out the scarf.

989
00:49:39,737 --> 00:49:41,362
I need to use the ladies' room.

990
00:49:47,196 --> 00:49:49,321
Did you see how flustered she was?

991
00:49:49,362 --> 00:49:51,487
She suddenly fled to the ladies' room.

992
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:53,779
Did she pick the same one on purpose?

993
00:49:54,029 --> 00:49:55,654
She always acts all proud and confident,

994
00:49:55,904 --> 00:49:57,862
but she's actually a copycat.

995
00:50:11,445 --> 00:50:12,654
Seo Jin.

996
00:50:14,988 --> 00:50:18,529
You always got what you wanted.

997
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,404
The same goes for Joo Dan Tae.

998
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:29,404
Sim Soo Ryeon.

999
00:50:30,404 --> 00:50:31,362
Do you think the penthouse

1000
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:32,571
will be yours forever?

1001
00:50:50,196 --> 00:50:51,529
Welcome!

1002
00:50:51,904 --> 00:50:53,196
It's very nice to meet you.

1003
00:50:54,654 --> 00:50:56,113
Welcome.

1004
00:50:58,280 --> 00:50:59,362
This is my wife.

1005
00:51:01,362 --> 00:51:03,071
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1006
00:51:03,612 --> 00:51:04,654
My name is Logan Lee.

1007
00:51:04,779 --> 00:51:06,113
It's an honour to meet you.

1008
00:51:06,196 --> 00:51:07,362
I'm Sim Soo Ryeon.

1009
00:51:07,696 --> 00:51:08,779
Thanks for coming tonight.

1010
00:51:08,904 --> 00:51:10,362
You guys look like a lovely couple.

1011
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,529
I'm jealous, Mr Joo.

1012
00:51:13,571 --> 00:51:14,654
If I knew this was going to be

1013
00:51:14,737 --> 00:51:15,696
the kind of scene,

1014
00:51:15,904 --> 00:51:17,362
I would've brought a partner myself.

1015
00:51:23,154 --> 00:51:26,988
My goodness. Sang A, he's so funny.

1016
00:51:29,071 --> 00:51:30,196
We can't have our important guest

1017
00:51:30,321 --> 00:51:31,280
feeling lonely,

1018
00:51:31,612 --> 00:51:33,404
which is why I invited someone for you.

1019
00:51:34,404 --> 00:51:35,445
Come on in.

1020
00:52:02,362 --> 00:52:04,362
What? How...

1021
00:52:05,571 --> 00:52:06,529
Chairman Joo.

1022
00:52:06,612 --> 00:52:08,404
Did you invite Ms Oh?

1023
00:52:08,904 --> 00:52:09,904
Yes.

1024
00:52:10,196 --> 00:52:11,321
I invited her.

1025
00:52:11,362 --> 00:52:13,071
I can't believe you invited her

1026
00:52:13,154 --> 00:52:14,612
without our permission.

1027
00:52:17,862 --> 00:52:19,529
This is very unlike you, Chairman Joo.

1028
00:52:20,487 --> 00:52:21,904
She's not here as a member of Hera Club.

1029
00:52:22,321 --> 00:52:23,487
She's here because she's now

1030
00:52:23,571 --> 00:52:24,988
an employee of JKING Holdings.

1031
00:52:25,238 --> 00:52:27,821
I'm now a member of his investment team.

1032
00:52:28,071 --> 00:52:29,154
Thank you for inviting me

1033
00:52:29,238 --> 00:52:30,321
to such a wonderful party.

1034
00:52:30,904 --> 00:52:32,113
I've never been to a party like this.

1035
00:52:32,196 --> 00:52:33,571
This is so amazing.

1036
00:52:35,362 --> 00:52:36,445
Hi, Logan.

1037
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:37,988
You're looking great today.

1038
00:52:38,196 --> 00:52:39,571
The suit looks nice on you.

1039
00:52:39,779 --> 00:52:41,946
Thank you. You look splendid yourself.

1040
00:52:42,612 --> 00:52:43,487
Thanks.

1041
00:52:44,196 --> 00:52:45,571
What are they talking about?

1042
00:52:45,737 --> 00:52:47,487
What is going on?

1043
00:52:47,571 --> 00:52:48,988
Am I the only one who doesn't understand?

1044
00:52:49,445 --> 00:52:51,029
Ms Oh, when did you start working

1045
00:52:51,113 --> 00:52:52,737
for Chairman Joo's company?

1046
00:52:53,821 --> 00:52:54,821
Congratulations, Yoon Hee.

1047
00:52:55,779 --> 00:52:58,321
My husband told me you're very competent.

1048
00:52:59,612 --> 00:53:00,487
I heard you arranged

1049
00:53:00,571 --> 00:53:01,571
the meeting with Logan for him?

1050
00:53:01,654 --> 00:53:02,654
What?

1051
00:53:02,737 --> 00:53:03,821
She did?

1052
00:53:04,071 --> 00:53:05,946
But why? How?

1053
00:53:06,696 --> 00:53:07,821
Are you and Logan close?

1054
00:53:08,362 --> 00:53:09,654
Well, the night is still young.

1055
00:53:09,737 --> 00:53:11,071
I'll tell you all about it later.

1056
00:53:11,487 --> 00:53:13,654
I'm starving because I'm surrounded by

1057
00:53:13,737 --> 00:53:15,071
all the scrumptious foods.

1058
00:53:15,154 --> 00:53:17,737
Can we eat and talk?

1059
00:53:18,071 --> 00:53:19,238
Sure, sounds good.

1060
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:20,529
This way, please.

1061
00:53:21,946 --> 00:53:23,029
After we eat,

1062
00:53:23,445 --> 00:53:24,571
there will be a lighting ceremony

1063
00:53:24,654 --> 00:53:25,696
at the fountain.

1064
00:53:26,113 --> 00:53:27,612
Mr Lee wanted to see it.

1065
00:53:28,029 --> 00:53:29,988
Yes, I hear it's the signature

1066
00:53:30,071 --> 00:53:31,362
of Hera Palace.

1067
00:53:41,113 --> 00:53:44,571
My, look at you all dressed up for a date.

1068
00:53:45,988 --> 00:53:47,154
What are you guys doing here?

1069
00:53:47,862 --> 00:53:49,029
Where's Seok Hoon?

1070
00:53:49,154 --> 00:53:50,113
Did you come running

1071
00:53:50,196 --> 00:53:51,280
because Seok Hoon wanted to meet up?

1072
00:53:51,779 --> 00:53:53,029
Unbelievable.

1073
00:53:53,362 --> 00:53:54,654
I have nothing to say to you guys.

1074
00:53:55,029 --> 00:53:57,029
You seem to have a habit of running away.

1075
00:53:57,113 --> 00:53:58,571
Shall I call Seok Hoon for you?

1076
00:54:02,029 --> 00:54:03,362
You'll regret it.

1077
00:54:03,445 --> 00:54:06,071
He can be very scary.

1078
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,238
Seok Kyung, why are you doing this to me?

1079
00:54:08,362 --> 00:54:10,529
Did you really think I was your friend

1080
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,321
just because I was nice

1081
00:54:12,362 --> 00:54:13,362
to a lowlife like you?

1082
00:54:14,529 --> 00:54:16,571
Seok Hoon and I had a bet

1083
00:54:16,654 --> 00:54:18,529
over who'd do a better job of fooling you.

1084
00:54:19,737 --> 00:54:21,571
Don't tell me you actually thought

1085
00:54:21,654 --> 00:54:22,904
he had feelings for you.

1086
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:24,362
My gosh.

1087
00:54:24,654 --> 00:54:25,696
What did you say?

1088
00:54:25,779 --> 00:54:28,238
Stop playing innocent.

1089
00:54:28,362 --> 00:54:29,821
You impersonated Min Seol A

1090
00:54:29,904 --> 00:54:32,321
and threatened us. We know everything!

1091
00:54:32,362 --> 00:54:33,821
What are you talking about?

1092
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:35,529
I never impersonated anyone.

1093
00:54:35,612 --> 00:54:37,904
Have some shame. You give me the creeps.

1094
00:54:38,071 --> 00:54:39,404
Of course she'll play dumb.

1095
00:54:39,487 --> 00:54:40,654
Why bother asking?

1096
00:54:41,071 --> 00:54:42,946
Look at her putting on an act.

1097
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:44,362
Let me get straight to the point.

1098
00:54:44,821 --> 00:54:47,404
We refuse to go to the same school as you,

1099
00:54:47,904 --> 00:54:50,654
so apologise for what you did

1100
00:54:50,737 --> 00:54:51,821
and drop out.

1101
00:54:53,113 --> 00:54:54,696
Then we'll just let it go.

1102
00:54:54,862 --> 00:54:56,362
Why should I do that?

1103
00:54:56,988 --> 00:54:58,362
I didn't do anything wrong!

1104
00:54:58,404 --> 00:55:00,612
What a crazy psychopath.

1105
00:55:02,821 --> 00:55:04,862
I bet you also stole Min Seol A's shoe.

1106
00:55:05,821 --> 00:55:07,737
I can't believe you're a Cheonga student.

1107
00:55:08,071 --> 00:55:09,779
You're a disgrace to our school.

1108
00:55:10,862 --> 00:55:12,487
Do you have nothing better to do?

1109
00:55:13,445 --> 00:55:15,154
Are you scared I go to the same school

1110
00:55:15,238 --> 00:55:16,280
because I might outdo you?

1111
00:55:16,362 --> 00:55:17,654
Is that why you're doing this?

1112
00:55:18,404 --> 00:55:20,113
Why would we be scared? You're a nobody!

1113
00:55:20,362 --> 00:55:21,946
Who do you think you are?

1114
00:55:22,487 --> 00:55:24,029
Don't get so worked up.

1115
00:55:25,154 --> 00:55:26,946
She'll spill the truth soon.

1116
00:55:37,821 --> 00:55:39,029
Where's Seok Kyung?

1117
00:55:39,821 --> 00:55:41,280
I saw her going out earlier.

1118
00:55:43,071 --> 00:55:44,696
The tutor will be here shortly.

1119
00:55:49,988 --> 00:55:53,196
You have a knack for surprising others.

1120
00:55:53,445 --> 00:55:55,362
How did you win Chairman Joo over?

1121
00:55:55,529 --> 00:55:57,487
He's very picky about who he hires.

1122
00:55:57,988 --> 00:55:59,113
Yoon Hee, you're really

1123
00:55:59,238 --> 00:56:01,113
full of surprises.

1124
00:56:01,946 --> 00:56:04,154
I heard you brought Logan Lee.

1125
00:56:04,362 --> 00:56:05,487
That's very impressive.

1126
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:07,654
How did you do that? - Let's just say

1127
00:56:08,571 --> 00:56:10,404
my sincerity won him over.

1128
00:56:12,362 --> 00:56:14,238
Where did you learn English?

1129
00:56:14,321 --> 00:56:16,529
Your pronunciation is pretty good.

1130
00:56:16,779 --> 00:56:18,071
I studied a little.

1131
00:56:18,529 --> 00:56:21,238
If you'd like, I can put you in touch

1132
00:56:21,321 --> 00:56:22,280
with a good English tutor.

1133
00:56:23,404 --> 00:56:26,571
I understand everything.

1134
00:56:26,821 --> 00:56:28,988
I just can't speak it well.

1135
00:56:34,612 --> 00:56:35,654
You're hosting this party,

1136
00:56:35,779 --> 00:56:37,529
so don't drink too much.

1137
00:56:38,154 --> 00:56:39,154
All right.

1138
00:56:53,821 --> 00:56:55,029
Is Dr Ha not coming?

1139
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:57,696
I invited him.

1140
00:56:59,779 --> 00:57:00,821
Obviously, he won't come.

1141
00:57:00,904 --> 00:57:02,280
Their marriage is falling apart...

1142
00:57:03,988 --> 00:57:05,029
Oh, boy.

1143
00:57:05,988 --> 00:57:07,362
I thought you two made up.

1144
00:57:08,321 --> 00:57:09,612
Didn't he send you

1145
00:57:09,696 --> 00:57:11,862
those flowers and the ring as well?

1146
00:57:13,487 --> 00:57:14,862
Go easy on him.

1147
00:57:15,612 --> 00:57:17,362
All married couples fight

1148
00:57:18,113 --> 00:57:19,280
and lie to each other sometimes.

1149
00:57:19,487 --> 00:57:20,529
It's normal.

1150
00:57:20,862 --> 00:57:22,071
Right, honey?

1151
00:57:24,029 --> 00:57:25,280
Well, I've never

1152
00:57:25,362 --> 00:57:26,445
lied to you about anything.

1153
00:57:27,612 --> 00:57:29,696
You know that I'm a lousy liar.

1154
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:37,571
Excuse me.

1155
00:58:04,445 --> 00:58:05,821
Bravo!

1156
00:58:06,571 --> 00:58:08,113
What's going on?

1157
00:58:12,154 --> 00:58:14,946
You're really amazing, Soo Ryeon.

1158
00:58:15,821 --> 00:58:16,737
You know

1159
00:58:16,821 --> 00:58:19,612
how much I admire you, right?

1160
00:58:19,862 --> 00:58:23,362
You're always so elegant and kind.

1161
00:58:23,445 --> 00:58:24,529
You're the most amazing wife

1162
00:58:24,612 --> 00:58:26,238
who takes such great care of your husband

1163
00:58:27,904 --> 00:58:29,196
and a great mother.

1164
00:58:30,862 --> 00:58:33,196
Both of your kids get good grades,

1165
00:58:33,654 --> 00:58:35,988
and you're throwing this party because

1166
00:58:36,071 --> 00:58:37,612
they were picked as student ambassadors.

1167
00:58:37,737 --> 00:58:39,779
You have no idea how jealous I am.

1168
00:58:45,696 --> 00:58:47,737
They're not even your biological children.

1169
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,154
How did you manage to raise them so well?

1170
00:58:59,238 --> 00:59:01,445
What? What do you mean?

1171
00:59:01,529 --> 00:59:02,779
They're not her biological kids?

1172
00:59:02,862 --> 00:59:04,487
Ms Cheon, are you drunk?

1173
00:59:04,571 --> 00:59:05,737
You didn't know?

1174
00:59:09,612 --> 00:59:10,654
My gosh.

1175
00:59:11,654 --> 00:59:14,113
I thought you all knew.

1176
00:59:14,904 --> 00:59:15,821
Gosh.

1177
00:59:16,487 --> 00:59:17,988
I'm sorry, Soo Ryeon.

1178
00:59:18,946 --> 00:59:21,737
But times have changed.

1179
00:59:21,862 --> 00:59:24,029
There's no need to keep it a secret.

1180
00:59:24,154 --> 00:59:25,529
I've always thought of them

1181
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:29,280
as my own children.

1182
00:59:30,071 --> 00:59:31,445
I raised them like my own.

1183
00:59:32,404 --> 00:59:33,529
I'd appreciate it

1184
00:59:34,029 --> 00:59:35,904
if you could watch what you say.

1185
00:59:36,071 --> 00:59:37,071
Whatever it is,

1186
00:59:37,196 --> 00:59:38,696
it's not nice to be secretive

1187
00:59:38,779 --> 00:59:40,154
and hide things.

1188
00:59:40,487 --> 00:59:41,529
There's no need to hide it

1189
00:59:41,612 --> 00:59:42,696
if you're unashamed about it.

1190
00:59:43,904 --> 00:59:45,113
I'm not going to lie.

1191
00:59:45,529 --> 00:59:46,571
I could tell that

1192
00:59:46,654 --> 00:59:48,154
they weren't your real kids.

1193
00:59:48,696 --> 00:59:50,696
You were too bold in certain situations,

1194
00:59:50,779 --> 00:59:52,321
and a biological mother never would have

1195
00:59:52,571 --> 00:59:54,196
behaved that way.

1196
00:59:55,779 --> 00:59:56,696
Is that right?

1197
00:59:57,154 --> 00:59:58,321
As they say,

1198
00:59:58,696 --> 01:00:00,696
no parent is perfect.

1199
01:00:01,529 --> 01:00:02,988
I suppose I should try harder.

1200
01:00:09,571 --> 01:00:11,612
It's not something that comes with effort.

1201
01:00:12,737 --> 01:00:14,280
A mother's love for her children

1202
01:00:14,362 --> 01:00:15,529
is an instinct.

1203
01:00:34,404 --> 01:00:36,571
Are you enjoying the party?

1204
01:00:36,654 --> 01:00:37,862
The lighting ceremony will begin soon.

1205
01:00:37,946 --> 01:00:39,280
You should do it then.

1206
01:00:39,571 --> 01:00:41,196
Tell everyone that you are

1207
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,404
Min Seol A's mother.

1208
01:00:42,487 --> 01:00:44,238
Say it loud and clear

1209
01:00:44,321 --> 01:00:45,612
so I can hear it.

1210
01:00:46,487 --> 01:00:47,571
If you don't do it,

1211
01:00:48,196 --> 01:00:50,029
I'll have no choice but to get involved.

1212
01:00:55,445 --> 01:00:56,821
What was that about?

1213
01:00:56,946 --> 01:00:58,904
Why bring that up on an evening like this?

1214
01:00:59,571 --> 01:01:00,696
You're one to talk.

1215
01:01:00,904 --> 01:01:03,571
You bought the same scarf for your wife

1216
01:01:03,654 --> 01:01:04,696
and kept smiling next to her

1217
01:01:04,779 --> 01:01:05,612
with those loving eyes.

1218
01:01:06,821 --> 01:01:08,779
Are you that happy? Having a blast?

1219
01:01:09,113 --> 01:01:10,113
If you love her that much,

1220
01:01:10,238 --> 01:01:11,071
why are you seeing me?

1221
01:01:11,196 --> 01:01:12,362
I didn't get her that scarf...

1222
01:01:13,404 --> 01:01:15,362
You know this party is important to me.

1223
01:01:15,612 --> 01:01:16,445
You didn't have to make

1224
01:01:16,571 --> 01:01:17,779
everyone uncomfortable like that.

1225
01:01:22,654 --> 01:01:23,988
Have you lost your mind?

1226
01:01:24,571 --> 01:01:25,571
I don't know.

1227
01:01:26,821 --> 01:01:29,280
You're suddenly acting like a stranger.

1228
01:01:29,862 --> 01:01:30,904
Tell me.

1229
01:01:31,529 --> 01:01:33,029
How much do you love me?

1230
01:01:35,238 --> 01:01:36,445
This is so unlike you.

1231
01:01:36,654 --> 01:01:38,696
You know how I feel. - No, I don't!

1232
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:41,071
So prove it to me right now.

1233
01:01:41,196 --> 01:01:42,571
Do it now!

1234
01:01:59,821 --> 01:02:00,737
Don't drink any more.

1235
01:02:00,821 --> 01:02:01,737
You're already drunk.

1236
01:02:02,529 --> 01:02:04,071
I'll wait at the villa after the party.

1237
01:02:05,654 --> 01:02:06,696
There are a lot of eyes watching,

1238
01:02:07,029 --> 01:02:08,113
so you go in first.

1239
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:11,612
Okay.

1240
01:02:25,696 --> 01:02:26,904
You jerk.

1241
01:02:26,988 --> 01:02:28,862
How could you do that here?

1242
01:02:29,029 --> 01:02:30,529
Do you have nothing but animal instincts?

1243
01:02:32,362 --> 01:02:34,612
You know, I never liked you.

1244
01:02:34,696 --> 01:02:36,280
Joo Dan Tae, you scumbag!

1245
01:02:38,362 --> 01:02:39,487
So you knew?

1246
01:02:40,113 --> 01:02:41,737
But I won't let you hit me after this.

1247
01:02:41,988 --> 01:02:43,280
This is enough, right?

1248
01:02:43,362 --> 01:02:44,654
What did you say? You jerk!

1249
01:02:48,362 --> 01:02:50,029
You insecure loser.

1250
01:02:50,362 --> 01:02:52,029
You don't deserve a woman like her.

1251
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:53,904
If you have any conscience,

1252
01:02:54,029 --> 01:02:55,154
you should let her go.

1253
01:02:55,404 --> 01:02:57,445
You don't know how to love a woman.

1254
01:02:57,529 --> 01:02:59,737
What? You scumbag!

1255
01:03:03,404 --> 01:03:06,154
You darn jerk. I will kill you!

1256
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:08,238
You piece of...

1257
01:03:08,571 --> 01:03:10,529
What are you doing? Break it up.

1258
01:03:11,571 --> 01:03:12,904
You jerk! - Gosh!

1259
01:03:15,904 --> 01:03:17,029
Get back here. - Hey.

1260
01:03:17,904 --> 01:03:21,113
You fools! Enough!

1261
01:03:21,196 --> 01:03:22,487
You little... - Hey!

1262
01:03:22,821 --> 01:03:24,196
Come here. - You punk.

1263
01:03:24,612 --> 01:03:25,862
Logan Lee!

1264
01:03:26,154 --> 01:03:27,779
Logan Lee is here!

1265
01:03:28,362 --> 01:03:29,904
What about the lighting ceremony?

1266
01:03:30,196 --> 01:03:31,612
Will you take responsibility

1267
01:03:31,696 --> 01:03:33,362
if the contract falls through?

1268
01:03:33,445 --> 01:03:35,362
Move. I'll kill that scumbag!

1269
01:03:37,612 --> 01:03:39,612
You piece of... - Stop it! Enough!

1270
01:03:39,821 --> 01:03:41,445
Goodness. - You jerk.

1271
01:03:41,529 --> 01:03:43,529
Break it up already!

1272
01:03:51,154 --> 01:03:52,487
That's why Seok Hoon and Seok Kyung

1273
01:03:52,571 --> 01:03:54,404
were always cold to her.

1274
01:03:54,988 --> 01:03:56,362
I always found it odd.

1275
01:03:56,862 --> 01:03:58,612
No wonder she never seemed interested

1276
01:03:58,696 --> 01:03:59,904
in their studies.

1277
01:04:00,113 --> 01:04:01,571
Now I understand why

1278
01:04:01,654 --> 01:04:03,529
those two kids always looked sad.

1279
01:04:03,612 --> 01:04:04,779
Right?

1280
01:04:04,862 --> 01:04:06,071
She was always busy

1281
01:04:06,154 --> 01:04:07,737
pointing out their faults.

1282
01:04:07,821 --> 01:04:10,280
Now it all makes sense.

1283
01:04:10,612 --> 01:04:11,571
Right?

1284
01:04:12,238 --> 01:04:13,196
Ms Cheon.

1285
01:04:13,988 --> 01:04:15,154
Oh, cheers.

1286
01:04:19,988 --> 01:04:21,071
Soo Ryeon.

1287
01:04:21,696 --> 01:04:22,821
Is that really true?

1288
01:04:23,154 --> 01:04:25,029
What Seo Jin said earlier.

1289
01:04:25,529 --> 01:04:26,571
I'm sorry

1290
01:04:26,988 --> 01:04:28,321
for not telling you.

1291
01:04:28,445 --> 01:04:30,529
Gosh, why are you sorry?

1292
01:04:30,988 --> 01:04:32,821
That crazy witch.

1293
01:04:33,071 --> 01:04:34,238
Who is she to expose

1294
01:04:34,321 --> 01:04:36,113
such personal matters? How dare she.

1295
01:04:37,113 --> 01:04:39,404
Joo Dan Tae must've told her.

1296
01:04:39,487 --> 01:04:40,737
They're both evil.

1297
01:04:41,779 --> 01:04:44,154
Must you give birth to be called a mother?

1298
01:04:44,362 --> 01:04:46,862
You raised them as your own all this time.

1299
01:04:47,445 --> 01:04:50,529
Soo Ryeon, don't take it to heart.

1300
01:04:51,154 --> 01:04:52,280
The whole world

1301
01:04:52,362 --> 01:04:53,696
knows that you've done your best.

1302
01:04:54,321 --> 01:04:55,404
I'm okay.

1303
01:04:56,946 --> 01:04:58,196
I really mean it.

1304
01:04:59,737 --> 01:05:02,821
It must've been so hard for you.

1305
01:05:08,946 --> 01:05:10,154
"Fake Min Seol A"

1306
01:05:10,238 --> 01:05:11,404
"Bae Ro Na"

1307
01:05:11,487 --> 01:05:12,362
"Drop out of school"

1308
01:05:17,904 --> 01:05:20,029
Where did Chairman Joo go?

1309
01:05:20,113 --> 01:05:21,362
His guest is waiting.

1310
01:05:21,571 --> 01:05:23,445
My husband isn't picking up either.

1311
01:05:23,862 --> 01:05:25,113
Did something happen?

1312
01:05:27,737 --> 01:05:29,737
I'm already being punished.

1313
01:05:31,696 --> 01:05:33,196
I'm not happy.

1314
01:05:38,862 --> 01:05:39,862
Honey!

1315
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:41,362
What happened to your face? - Gosh.

1316
01:05:41,404 --> 01:05:42,654
It's nothing. - What happened?

1317
01:05:46,946 --> 01:05:48,196
What are you doing here?

1318
01:05:48,779 --> 01:05:50,280
You should've dressed up at least.

1319
01:05:50,362 --> 01:05:51,529
You're a mess.

1320
01:05:54,029 --> 01:05:55,196
Gosh. - My goodness.

1321
01:06:04,654 --> 01:06:06,029
I've changed my mind.

1322
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:07,529
I don't want a divorce.

1323
01:06:08,487 --> 01:06:09,445
What?

1324
01:06:09,612 --> 01:06:10,696
I said, I don't want a divorce.

1325
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:12,321
Until the day I die.

1326
01:06:13,238 --> 01:06:14,862
I don't care if you cheat on me.

1327
01:06:15,529 --> 01:06:17,113
Just be my miserable wife

1328
01:06:17,196 --> 01:06:18,737
for the rest of your life

1329
01:06:19,696 --> 01:06:20,529
and die miserably.

1330
01:06:22,404 --> 01:06:23,445
Gosh, I'm sorry.

1331
01:06:23,529 --> 01:06:24,737
I had to deal with something urgent.

1332
01:06:25,321 --> 01:06:26,445
Enjoy the party.

1333
01:06:27,196 --> 01:06:28,321
Dr Ha. - Dr Ha.

1334
01:06:28,362 --> 01:06:29,904
What was that about? - My gosh.

1335
01:06:30,445 --> 01:06:31,612
What on earth? - Gosh.

1336
01:06:35,113 --> 01:06:36,862
Goodness. - Oh, boy.

1337
01:06:38,862 --> 01:06:40,445
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

1338
01:06:41,029 --> 01:06:41,946
No, it's fine.

1339
01:06:42,029 --> 01:06:42,904
I've set it up so that

1340
01:06:42,988 --> 01:06:43,904
you can begin the ceremony.

1341
01:06:43,988 --> 01:06:45,029
This way, please.

1342
01:06:45,196 --> 01:06:46,154
Okay.

1343
01:06:46,445 --> 01:06:47,362
Let's go.

1344
01:06:47,612 --> 01:06:49,154
Wow, it's an honour.

1345
01:06:50,821 --> 01:06:52,445
Shall I? - Please.

1346
01:07:17,529 --> 01:07:18,862
I also prepared

1347
01:07:18,946 --> 01:07:20,862
a special welcoming gift for you.

1348
01:07:24,238 --> 01:07:25,196
All right.

1349
01:07:25,404 --> 01:07:26,904
Shall we all count down together?

1350
01:07:26,988 --> 01:07:28,029
Okay!

1351
01:07:28,196 --> 01:07:29,362
Ten!

1352
01:07:29,529 --> 01:07:31,988
Nine, eight... - Nine, eight...

1353
01:07:32,404 --> 01:07:33,612
seven... - seven...

1354
01:07:34,071 --> 01:07:36,321
six, five... - six, five...

1355
01:07:36,612 --> 01:07:37,737
four... - four...

1356
01:07:37,821 --> 01:07:39,029
three... - three...

1357
01:07:39,362 --> 01:07:40,445
two... - two...

1358
01:07:40,821 --> 01:07:41,862
one. - one.

1359
01:07:41,946 --> 01:07:43,696
Zero!

1360
01:07:48,988 --> 01:07:51,071

"The one who killed Min Seol A is here"

1363
01:08:35,696 --> 01:08:37,529
This is solid evidence that Sim Soo Ryeon

1364
01:08:37,612 --> 01:08:38,821
has been threatening us.

1365
01:08:39,487 --> 01:08:40,612
Because she's Sim Soo Ryeon's daughter.

1366
01:08:40,696 --> 01:08:41,696
I'll get a divorce.

1367
01:08:41,779 --> 01:08:43,862
Let's sign our divorce papers.

1368
01:08:44,696 --> 01:08:46,154
You didn't know that your mum

1369
01:08:46,238 --> 01:08:47,737
hit on my dad?

1370
01:08:47,862 --> 01:08:49,280
I want to drop out.

1371
01:08:49,362 --> 01:08:50,904
The one who killed Min Seol A...

1372
01:08:51,196 --> 01:08:52,904
This is Min Seol A's phone.

1373
01:08:53,029 --> 01:08:55,154
Let's avenge Seol A's death together.

1374
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:57,362
What are you doing here?
