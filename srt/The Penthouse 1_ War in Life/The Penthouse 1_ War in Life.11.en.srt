No.

Please don't call my mum.

I don't understand.

25

Why do you care so much about her?

26
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:17,335
She is a nobody anyway.

Here's the answer to your question

28
00:01:18,317 --> 00:01:19,892
I didn't give you before.

29

I don't like you.

You haven't gone home yet?

Well, what is it?

36
00:01:43,567 --> 00:01:46,204
The one who put cigarettes in her bag...

37
00:01:47,026 --> 00:01:48,601
was me.

38
00:01:54,984 --> 00:01:56,850
Did you really?

39
00:01:57,776 --> 00:01:59,085
Did you really do this?

40
00:01:59,109 --> 00:02:00,818
I did it.

41
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,543
Don't you understand?

42
00:02:02,567 --> 00:02:04,267
How can you do this?

43
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:06,710
Why?

44
00:02:06,734 --> 00:02:08,002
Why did you do this to me?

45
00:02:08,026 --> 00:02:09,850
I was just bored.

You need to be straight with me.

48
00:02:13,442 --> 00:02:15,752
If you're doing this to cover for her...

49
00:02:15,776 --> 00:02:18,100
Is there any reason for me to do that?

50
00:02:19,026 --> 00:02:22,293
So there is no reason, no.

51

Hello, this is Joo Dan Tae.

57

I'd like to speak to Mr Logan Lee.

I'm already here.

00:03:09,817 --> 00:03:11,434
You may go.

67
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:17,850
Gosh, unlike my expectation, your office

68
00:03:17,942 --> 00:03:19,850
is rather small.

69
00:03:19,942 --> 00:03:21,726
How's your business going?

70
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:22,918
Even the economy can't have

71
00:03:22,942 --> 00:03:24,460
an effect on your business, right?

72
00:03:24,484 --> 00:03:26,476
Let's cut to the chase.

73
00:03:26,525 --> 00:03:27,960
What brings you here?

74
00:03:27,984 --> 00:03:30,251
Well, I'm here today

75
00:03:30,275 --> 00:03:31,752
because Cheonga Arts High is

76
00:03:31,776 --> 00:03:33,892
going to pick student ambassadors.

77
00:03:33,984 --> 00:03:35,752
No matter how much I think about it,

78
00:03:35,776 --> 00:03:38,642
Seok Kyung is the perfect candidate.

79
00:03:39,233 --> 00:03:41,251
Did you visit me here at my office

80
00:03:41,275 --> 00:03:43,559
to tell me something like that?

81
00:03:43,692 --> 00:03:45,585
Was my present not enough for you

82
00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:47,476
at that time?

83
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,460
Can you buy me a drink

84
00:03:50,484 --> 00:03:52,975
you owe me from last time, Dan Tae?

85
00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:54,626
"Dan Tae"?

86
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,710
Was I too forward right now?

87
00:03:56,734 --> 00:03:59,350
Should I have given you a warning?

88
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,877
I like how homey you are.

89
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:03,168
But I'm sorry.

90
00:04:03,192 --> 00:04:05,126
I have an engagement with my wife.

91
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,626
We're having dinner together.

92
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,293
Wow.

93
00:04:08,317 --> 00:04:10,710
You have a dinner date

94
00:04:10,734 --> 00:04:12,209
with your beautiful wife.

95
00:04:12,233 --> 00:04:14,017
Man.

96
00:04:15,233 --> 00:04:17,017
You're a family man.

97
00:04:18,068 --> 00:04:19,335
In that case,

98
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,434
I'll get going.

99
00:04:27,026 --> 00:04:28,684
Mr Cho.

100
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,877
Are you going to see me off too?

101
00:04:38,901 --> 00:04:40,768
There's no need to--

102
00:04:44,233 --> 00:04:46,809
"I don't plan on having you as a friend."

Dan Tae.

106
00:04:56,359 --> 00:04:59,668
You have an awful temper.

107
00:04:59,692 --> 00:05:01,850
Please pass that onto him.

108
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,476
Please do that.

109
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:12,376
I'm sorry you had to stay late, Mr Ma.

110
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,460
I'll go home

111
00:05:13,484 --> 00:05:14,793
and have another talk with him.

112
00:05:14,817 --> 00:05:17,085
Of course, you should.

113
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:19,376
You're our school's Head of Operation.

114
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,209
Nothing bad will happen, though.

115
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:24,184
I'll make sure I patch this up.

116
00:05:26,109 --> 00:05:27,251
Soo Ryeon,

117
00:05:27,275 --> 00:05:30,918
could you stay with Ro Na today?

118
00:05:30,942 --> 00:05:33,809
I'll explain it to you later.

119
00:05:33,984 --> 00:05:35,975
I'll take Ro Na with me too.

120
00:05:40,192 --> 00:05:41,877
These are Seok Kyung's clothes.

121
00:05:41,901 --> 00:05:43,684
Feel free to get changed.

122
00:05:43,734 --> 00:05:46,126
Do you mind staying with her tonight?

123
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,726
Of course not.

124
00:05:48,275 --> 00:05:51,100
I was worried Mum will catch me.

125
00:05:51,692 --> 00:05:53,460
Please keep

126
00:05:53,484 --> 00:05:55,684
what happened today as a secret.

127
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,460
I'm so sorry.

128
00:06:01,484 --> 00:06:04,059
Seok Hoon caused this misunderstanding.

129
00:06:04,525 --> 00:06:07,892
He didn't do that.

130
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,309
What?

131
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,642
Ha Yoon Chul and Oh Yoon Hee.

132
00:06:18,942 --> 00:06:21,100
I want to kill them.

133
00:06:21,734 --> 00:06:23,476
Calm down.

134
00:06:23,776 --> 00:06:25,585
You are my precious princess.

135
00:06:25,609 --> 00:06:27,126
Don't get your feelings get hurt

136
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,142
because of your idiotic husband.

137
00:06:49,525 --> 00:06:51,267
I'm not sure.

138
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,044
When did you prepare all these?

139
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:26,710
These are all my favourites.

140
00:07:26,734 --> 00:07:28,877
I want you to be happy

141
00:07:28,901 --> 00:07:31,668
without any worry when you're here.

142
00:07:31,692 --> 00:07:33,460
Enjoy everything as much as you want.

143
00:07:33,484 --> 00:07:35,892
You deserve it.

144
00:07:52,484 --> 00:07:55,392
This is our sign.

145
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:59,517
When I put this scarf on,

146
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,726
it's my sign that means

147
00:08:02,317 --> 00:08:04,684
I'm going to hold you in my arms.

148
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,559
I see.

149
00:08:30,275 --> 00:08:32,768
You disgusting jerks.

150
00:08:47,525 --> 00:08:49,184
So?

151
00:08:49,484 --> 00:08:51,601
Are you bold enough to shoot me?

152
00:08:57,859 --> 00:08:59,517
Shoot me.

153
00:09:00,192 --> 00:09:01,765
Shoot me!

154
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:04,142
Shoot me now!

155
00:09:06,984 --> 00:09:08,293
I took a dirt-poor son of a grape farmer

156
00:09:08,317 --> 00:09:09,251
and did so much work

157
00:09:09,275 --> 00:09:10,543
to turn him into a decent doctor,

158
00:09:10,567 --> 00:09:11,501
and you're now going to live

159
00:09:11,525 --> 00:09:12,752
the rest of your life as a murderer?

160
00:09:12,776 --> 00:09:13,918
Do whatever you want

161
00:09:13,942 --> 00:09:16,184
if you want to rot in prison forever.

162
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:22,434
You jerks!

163
00:09:40,192 --> 00:09:42,726
This is our sign.

164
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:45,267
It's my sign that means

165
00:09:46,068 --> 00:09:48,577
I'm going to hold you in my arms.

166
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:00,576
Dad, when are you coming home?

167
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,384
I'm home alone, and it's scary.

168
00:10:13,302 --> 00:10:15,016
*Come here.

169
00:10:17,432 --> 00:10:19,027
*Come here.

170
00:10:22,699 --> 00:10:24,550
*Let's see.

171
00:11:59,268 --> 00:12:02,009
Yoon Chul, what's wrong?

172
00:12:02,809 --> 00:12:04,842
Your hands are bleeding.

173
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,428
Yoon Hee.

174
00:12:20,101 --> 00:12:22,759
Did something happen to you?

175
00:12:22,934 --> 00:12:24,066
What?

176
00:12:25,059 --> 00:12:27,868
You shouldn't ruin your hands as a doctor.

177
00:12:27,892 --> 00:12:30,050
Your hands save people.

178
00:12:30,892 --> 00:12:32,592
It's nothing.

179
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:36,776
Something happened at the hospital.

180
00:12:38,475 --> 00:12:41,244
Right, where's Ro Na?

181
00:12:41,268 --> 00:12:43,050
She's at Seok Kyung's place.

182
00:12:44,142 --> 00:12:45,926
She's going to sleep over

183
00:12:46,059 --> 00:12:47,717
at her place.

184
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,801
Do you want a drink?

185
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,910
Fate between people is

186
00:13:11,934 --> 00:13:13,717
a funny thing.

187
00:13:14,517 --> 00:13:16,576
We ended up meeting again

188
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,259
and living in the same building.

189
00:13:20,101 --> 00:13:24,550
I resented you for a very long time.

190
00:13:26,392 --> 00:13:28,910
Whenever I heard about Seo Jin,

191
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:30,926
I was reminded of you.

192
00:13:32,767 --> 00:13:34,618
That's why I chose not to care

193
00:13:34,642 --> 00:13:37,050
about anything regarding music.

194
00:13:42,268 --> 00:13:44,175
I think I'm getting punished.

195
00:13:45,934 --> 00:13:47,368
You finally saw

196
00:13:47,392 --> 00:13:49,801
your wife's true nature.

197
00:13:52,684 --> 00:13:53,910
Don't say that

198
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:56,092
and live a good life with Seo Jin.

199
00:13:56,226 --> 00:13:57,968
And stop getting into fights.

200
00:13:58,268 --> 00:13:59,884
By any chance...

201
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:05,968
if I could return to you...

202
00:14:09,976 --> 00:14:11,592
Do I

203
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,826
not deserve to be with you forever,

204
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:15,467
Yoon Hee?

205
00:14:24,184 --> 00:14:25,868
Stop drinking.

206
00:14:25,892 --> 00:14:27,842
You're drunk.

207
00:15:18,976 --> 00:15:20,634
Yoon Hee.

208
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:22,993
Pay Cheon Seo Jin back

209
00:15:23,017 --> 00:15:24,618
as much as she harassed you.

210
00:15:24,642 --> 00:15:26,926
You don't have to feel guilty.

211
00:15:28,142 --> 00:15:30,050
You have a right to do so.

212
00:15:38,475 --> 00:15:40,175
Let's not do this.

213
00:15:57,475 --> 00:15:58,952
Don't worry about Oh Yoon Hee.

214
00:15:58,976 --> 00:16:01,326
Things got easier thanks to your work.

215
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,743
We'll do the Operation Committee tonight

216
00:16:02,767 --> 00:16:04,035
and put it to a vote.

217
00:16:04,059 --> 00:16:05,535
You have my full trust.

218
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:07,576
Please get rid of her before my eyes.

219
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,259
Don't worry about it.

220
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,467
What's wrong?

221
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,759
It seems like someone touched my gun.

222
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,326
I made sure

223
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:23,425
even the caretaker doesn't touch this.

224
00:16:23,517 --> 00:16:24,493
I'm sure the maid touched it

225
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:26,175
while cleaning up.

226
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,701
I think you're a bit too sensitive.

227
00:16:28,725 --> 00:16:31,092
Let's go. It's late.

228
00:16:58,371 --> 00:16:59,834
"Hera Palace"

229
00:17:21,017 --> 00:17:22,285
What?

230
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:24,050
He never came in?

231
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,493
Where have you been?

232
00:18:22,517 --> 00:18:24,926
I saw your car in the car park.

233
00:18:26,934 --> 00:18:28,926
What's wrong with your hands?

234
00:18:30,934 --> 00:18:33,467
Where are you coming from?

235
00:18:43,767 --> 00:18:45,384
What are you doing?

236
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:47,717
Why are you packing up?

237
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:50,050
What are you doing right now?

238
00:18:55,392 --> 00:18:57,160
Right.

239
00:18:57,184 --> 00:18:58,952
I married you with empty hands,

240
00:18:58,976 --> 00:18:59,993
so it's not a bad idea

241
00:19:00,017 --> 00:19:01,842
to leave with empty hands.

242
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,285
Let's get divorced.

243
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,217
We can stop fooling ourselves.

244
00:19:06,392 --> 00:19:08,050
What?

245
00:19:08,226 --> 00:19:09,244
A divorce?

246
00:19:09,268 --> 00:19:11,425
Isn't that what you wanted?

247
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,493
I'll let your father know.

248
00:19:13,517 --> 00:19:14,785
As soon as the paperwork is ready,

249
00:19:14,809 --> 00:19:16,425
let's put an end to this.

250
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,535
Relieve your hangover before work.

251
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:27,676
You had a lot to drink.

252
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:35,993
Were you with Yoon Hee all night long?

253
00:19:36,017 --> 00:19:37,826
And you dare to ask me for a divorce?

254
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:40,009
You don't have a right to do that!

255
00:19:40,268 --> 00:19:41,160
Do you think I will

256
00:19:41,184 --> 00:19:42,618
let you two have your way?

257
00:19:42,642 --> 00:19:43,618
I'm taking Eun Byeol

258
00:19:43,642 --> 00:19:45,326
as soon as I find a place to stay.

259
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,618
I can't leave her with a woman like you.

260
00:19:47,642 --> 00:19:49,202
It'll be easy to leave,

261
00:19:49,226 --> 00:19:51,160
but it won't be easy to get back here.

262
00:19:51,184 --> 00:19:53,342
I don't plan on coming back.

263
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,285
As of this month, I'll stop paying

264
00:19:55,309 --> 00:19:56,785
expenses for your parents in Yeongwol.

265
00:19:56,809 --> 00:19:58,160
And the swarm of your siblings

266
00:19:58,184 --> 00:20:00,259
won't get help with their marriage fund!

267
00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:10,092
I have enough money to cover all that.

268
00:20:22,976 --> 00:20:24,717
Yoon Chul.

269
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,300
Ha Yoon Chul!

270
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:35,509
You!

271
00:20:40,976 --> 00:20:43,384
Mum, what's wrong?

272
00:20:58,517 --> 00:21:00,217
Ro Na, you should go.

273
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:14,300
You disgusting, crude thing.

274
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,050
Is it because of

275
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:24,009
Yoon Chul?

276
00:21:26,309 --> 00:21:28,160
Are you that unsure of yourself?

277
00:21:28,184 --> 00:21:30,717
Stop showing that you're a vulgar widow.

278
00:21:30,892 --> 00:21:32,035
It looks like you're using my husband

279
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:34,175
to stay here for good,

280
00:21:34,309 --> 00:21:36,842
but things won't go your way.

281
00:21:38,475 --> 00:21:40,701
We'll see in time.

282
00:21:40,725 --> 00:21:42,968
The one who'll move out

283
00:21:43,517 --> 00:21:45,509
won't be me, but you.

284
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,717
It'll be you, Cheon Seo Jin.

285
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,952
Yes, hello?

286
00:22:10,976 --> 00:22:12,326
Logan Lee?

287
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:14,285
You're a hard man to see.

288
00:22:14,309 --> 00:22:16,509
Have you received the files I've sent?

289
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,092
Yes, I got the documents.

290
00:22:19,226 --> 00:22:21,202
A few obstacles here and there,

291
00:22:21,226 --> 00:22:23,342
but a fairly satisfying deal.

292
00:22:24,226 --> 00:22:25,326
Okay.

293
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,133
Let's set up a date soon.

294
00:22:27,642 --> 00:22:29,660
Yes, that'll be great.

295
00:22:29,684 --> 00:22:31,884
Let me know anytime. I'll be waiting.

296
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:41,926
A late morning to work, Dr Ha.

297
00:22:43,309 --> 00:22:46,092
Are you still sulking over Oh Yoon Hee?

298
00:22:46,268 --> 00:22:48,342
I thought we called it even.

299
00:22:49,392 --> 00:22:51,050
I have good news.

300
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,493
We'll soon sell that land

301
00:22:52,517 --> 00:22:54,535
in Myeong-dong at the highest price.

302
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,133
Your bank account will be very fat soon.

303
00:22:57,559 --> 00:22:59,592
Don't lay a finger on me!

304
00:23:03,517 --> 00:23:05,244
I hope to have

305
00:23:05,268 --> 00:23:07,550
my investment back as soon as possible.

306
00:23:14,725 --> 00:23:16,801
That petty idiot.

307
00:23:17,226 --> 00:23:18,968
I really don't like him.

313
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:37,842
I saw Seo Jin walking out of your house.

314
00:23:38,142 --> 00:23:40,509
Something happened between you and her.

315
00:23:40,976 --> 00:23:42,717
I was with...

316
00:23:43,184 --> 00:23:45,493
Yoon Chul last night.

317
00:23:45,517 --> 00:23:47,409
It looks like he finally found out

318
00:23:47,433 --> 00:23:49,300
about Seo Jin's affair.

319
00:23:49,392 --> 00:23:51,092
And that

320
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:53,801
she's with Chairman Joo.

321
00:23:59,433 --> 00:24:01,035
Did you do this?

322
00:24:01,059 --> 00:24:04,759
She picked a fight first.

323
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:05,952
She even got Ro Na's grandma

324
00:24:05,976 --> 00:24:06,993
to make a huge scene.

325
00:24:07,017 --> 00:24:08,926
How am I supposed to deal with that?

326
00:24:10,309 --> 00:24:11,868
And one day,

327
00:24:11,892 --> 00:24:14,050
he was bound to find out anyway.

328
00:24:14,268 --> 00:24:15,493
And?

329
00:24:15,517 --> 00:24:17,952
Don't you get angry?

330
00:24:17,976 --> 00:24:19,701
You should pull out all of her hair,

331
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:20,952
and that still won't be enough.

332
00:24:20,976 --> 00:24:22,326
Why do you sit around elegantly

333
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:24,326
and let her do this to you?

334
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:26,701
You're awfully troubled,

335
00:24:26,725 --> 00:24:27,952
but she's totally fine.

336
00:24:27,976 --> 00:24:29,592
That's so not fair.

337
00:24:29,642 --> 00:24:31,592
This makes me so angry.

338
00:24:32,101 --> 00:24:33,785
That family will

339
00:24:33,809 --> 00:24:36,175
soon begin to live in torment.

340
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:38,968
Now that Yoon Chul found out,

341
00:24:39,142 --> 00:24:41,634
he won't let his cheating wife go on.

342
00:24:42,725 --> 00:24:44,285
I saw his face

343
00:24:44,309 --> 00:24:45,618
looking grim as if he's thinking

344
00:24:45,642 --> 00:24:47,592
he ruined everything in this life.

345
00:24:48,892 --> 00:24:51,634
That oddly felt good.

346
00:24:53,268 --> 00:24:54,884
But...

347
00:24:55,101 --> 00:24:58,509
that only lasted for a moment.

348
00:24:59,642 --> 00:25:01,509
What do you mean?

349
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:05,884
I know very well how painful it is

350
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:09,175
to be betrayed by a spouse,

351
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:10,952
to the point that

352
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:12,801
you'd want to kill yourself.

353
00:25:13,976 --> 00:25:16,133
And because I knew that so well,

354
00:25:17,101 --> 00:25:18,759
I felt bad for him.

355
00:25:21,017 --> 00:25:22,451
So

356
00:25:22,475 --> 00:25:24,384
we had a drink together as friends.

357
00:25:25,268 --> 00:25:27,175
That's all.

358
00:25:28,184 --> 00:25:29,785
Are you sure

359
00:25:29,809 --> 00:25:31,451
nothing happened between you two?

360
00:25:31,475 --> 00:25:32,701
I took a few pictures

361
00:25:32,725 --> 00:25:34,676
to make Seo Jin angry,

362
00:25:36,017 --> 00:25:38,050
but I couldn't send them to her.

363
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:40,676
I'm

364
00:25:40,767 --> 00:25:42,676
Ro Na's mum.

365
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:45,550
I'm not going to do

366
00:25:45,725 --> 00:25:48,300
anything to embarrass Ro Na.

367
00:25:49,309 --> 00:25:51,050
For Ro Na,

368
00:25:51,767 --> 00:25:54,050
I am the only one in this world.

369
00:26:01,934 --> 00:26:03,717
Yoon Hee, I'm so sorry.

370
00:26:04,976 --> 00:26:07,259
I had a very bad idea for a moment.

371
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,451
You're such a wonderful person.

372
00:26:12,475 --> 00:26:13,576
Soo Ryeon.

373
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,467
Let's really be friends for life.

374
00:26:16,767 --> 00:26:18,618
Let's not get into fights

375
00:26:18,642 --> 00:26:20,368
or betray each other.

376
00:26:20,392 --> 00:26:22,910
No matter how big of a mistake you make,

377
00:26:22,934 --> 00:26:24,409
I'll never hate you.

378
00:26:24,433 --> 00:26:25,868
Really?

379
00:26:25,892 --> 00:26:27,160
It's a promise.

380
00:26:27,184 --> 00:26:28,842
Okay, it's a promise.

381
00:26:31,892 --> 00:26:33,826
Seok Hoon did this?

382
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:36,160
He came to me and told me himself.

383
00:26:36,184 --> 00:26:37,826
Seok Hoon's mother came,

384
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:39,910
so I let him go home.

385
00:26:39,934 --> 00:26:41,826
But how should I deal with this?

386
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,244
You're right.

387
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,910
His family will pay for

388
00:26:44,934 --> 00:26:47,368
new air conditioners before this summer.

389
00:26:47,392 --> 00:26:48,701
I think it's reasonable

390
00:26:48,725 --> 00:26:50,550
to let a matter like this slide.

391
00:26:55,268 --> 00:26:56,785
Seok Hoon.

392
00:26:56,809 --> 00:26:58,826
Ms Cheon decided to show you mercy

393
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:01,050
and let you off with a warning.

394
00:27:01,142 --> 00:27:04,077
You got off thanks to your mum and dad

395
00:27:04,101 --> 00:27:06,050
playing your golden card.

396
00:27:06,767 --> 00:27:08,244
I already covered up

397
00:27:08,268 --> 00:27:09,952
your group assault last time.

398
00:27:09,976 --> 00:27:12,759
It's a shame that you did this again.

399
00:27:13,017 --> 00:27:15,160
Stop ruining your father's reputation, and

400
00:27:15,184 --> 00:27:17,801
focus on the school ambassador audition.

401
00:27:18,309 --> 00:27:19,826
Hey.

402
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:22,701
Shouldn't you thank Ms Cheon?

403
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:24,244
Don't you think you're way too cheeky

404
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:25,968
just because your dad is powerful?

405
00:27:31,892 --> 00:27:33,576
No one would go looking for Min Seol A

406
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,493
in the mechanical room, right?

407
00:27:35,517 --> 00:27:37,509
What if...

408
00:27:38,309 --> 00:27:41,050
she exposes our relationship?

409
00:27:41,934 --> 00:27:44,384
I'm sure you let me off for a reason.

410
00:27:48,809 --> 00:27:50,701
What is he saying?

411
00:27:50,725 --> 00:27:51,952
Hey, Seok Hoon!

412
00:27:51,976 --> 00:27:53,244
That little rascal.

413
00:27:53,268 --> 00:27:55,050
Let him be.

414
00:27:57,976 --> 00:27:59,842
He's in that age.

415
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,160
It looks like you got in trouble

416
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,634
in the midst of your probation.

417
00:28:09,892 --> 00:28:12,050
Did you really put cigarettes

418
00:28:12,268 --> 00:28:14,550
in Ro Na's backpack?

419
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,910
My gosh.

420
00:28:16,934 --> 00:28:18,409
I'm guessing that

421
00:28:18,433 --> 00:28:19,952
you keep repeating the same mistakes

422
00:28:19,976 --> 00:28:22,326
because you were never punished properly.

423
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:23,576
It's not too late

424
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,759
to apologise to Eun Hoo

425
00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:27,285
for beating him up.

426
00:28:27,309 --> 00:28:29,133
I didn't do anything

427
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:31,259
to make an apology for.

428
00:28:34,475 --> 00:28:36,425
Are you that good of a fighter?

429
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:37,785
Are you?

430
00:28:37,809 --> 00:28:39,743
Are you pretty good?

431
00:28:39,767 --> 00:28:42,035
So? Let's see what you got.

432
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:44,175
Hey, come at me.

433
00:28:44,433 --> 00:28:46,050
Come at me!

434
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:48,968
Stop it.

435
00:28:49,101 --> 00:28:50,409
It'll be embarrassing

436
00:28:50,433 --> 00:28:51,576
to get beaten up by a student.

437
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,826
Why?

438
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:54,717
Are you scared?

439
00:28:54,976 --> 00:28:57,133
Is that why you want to drop out?

440
00:28:57,934 --> 00:28:59,550
In that case,

441
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:01,826
admit that you beat up Eun Hoo,

442
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:02,743
and apologise to him.

443
00:29:02,767 --> 00:29:03,701
I can't!

444
00:29:03,725 --> 00:29:05,259
He deserved...

445
00:29:05,767 --> 00:29:07,326
to be beaten.

446
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:09,160
Why do you make so many excuses

447
00:29:09,184 --> 00:29:11,175
for beating someone up?

448
00:29:11,892 --> 00:29:13,244
Hey.

449
00:29:13,268 --> 00:29:15,618
If you were going to box,

450
00:29:15,642 --> 00:29:17,451
you should've done it fairly.

451
00:29:17,475 --> 00:29:19,244
Why did you cover his eyes?

452
00:29:19,268 --> 00:29:21,175
You cowardly brat.

453
00:29:22,017 --> 00:29:22,993
I won't go easy on you

454
00:29:23,017 --> 00:29:24,717
just because you're a teacher.

455
00:29:30,309 --> 00:29:32,326
Man, Seok Hoon.

456
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,743
Your punches are unlike what I expected.

457
00:29:34,767 --> 00:29:37,077
Why are you so slow?

458
00:29:37,101 --> 00:29:38,785
You were showing off for nothing.

459
00:29:38,809 --> 00:29:40,326
Stop saying such rubbish

460
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,409
and stay focused.

461
00:29:41,433 --> 00:29:42,493
"Rubbish"?

462
00:29:42,517 --> 00:29:44,326
Did you just say "rubbish" to a teacher?

463
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,785
Fine.

464
00:29:45,809 --> 00:29:46,952
Okay.

465
00:29:46,976 --> 00:29:48,868
Let's do this right.

466
00:29:48,892 --> 00:29:50,509
Bring it on.

467
00:30:14,475 --> 00:30:16,092
See that?

468
00:30:16,309 --> 00:30:19,509
You're nowhere near my league, kid.

469
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:23,300
Why didn't you punch my face?

470
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,009
Do you think I'm an idiot?

471
00:30:26,059 --> 00:30:27,368
I'll get fired

472
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:29,217
if I beat up a kid from a rich family.

473
00:30:29,433 --> 00:30:30,910
I only punched you

474
00:30:30,934 --> 00:30:33,660
in fatal spots that aren't noticeable,

475
00:30:33,684 --> 00:30:35,759
like this coward I know.

476
00:30:36,642 --> 00:30:38,384
Seok Hoon.

477
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:42,050
Clean up everything before you leave.

478
00:31:25,101 --> 00:31:26,493
You got 30 minutes today.

479
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:28,535
30 minutes?

480
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,118
Why does it get shorter and shorter?

481
00:31:30,142 --> 00:31:32,259
I can't do anything in such a short time.

482
00:31:32,392 --> 00:31:34,202
Just eat your meal box and come out.

483
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:36,202
We'll all go down if we get caught.

484
00:31:36,226 --> 00:31:38,259
Okay, fine. Open it up.

00:32:21,226 --> 00:32:25,384
I missed you to death.

491
00:32:28,142 --> 00:32:29,926
We have 30 minutes today.

496
00:33:55,684 --> 00:33:58,175
It cost me a new car for those 30 minutes.

497
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:06,660
Well, this is

498
00:34:06,684 --> 00:34:09,509
exactly why I work hard to make money.

499
00:34:22,976 --> 00:34:24,634
You're here, Father.

500
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:28,968
Honey.

501
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:32,244
I came out to get lunch with him.

502
00:34:32,268 --> 00:34:33,451
Is that all right?

503
00:34:33,475 --> 00:34:34,743
How did you get the idea

504
00:34:34,767 --> 00:34:36,968
to ask my dad out on lunch by yourself?

505
00:34:37,059 --> 00:34:38,409
I didn't have any class this afternoon,

506
00:34:38,433 --> 00:34:40,384
so I came with him.

507
00:34:40,642 --> 00:34:42,217
Let's go inside.

508
00:34:52,101 --> 00:34:53,660
So?

509
00:34:53,684 --> 00:34:56,009
What did you want to tell me?

510
00:34:56,059 --> 00:34:57,535
Is your family

511
00:34:57,559 --> 00:35:00,368
in need of money again?

512
00:35:00,392 --> 00:35:01,660
It's not like that.

513
00:35:01,684 --> 00:35:04,035
His parents are financially stable,

514
00:35:04,059 --> 00:35:05,368
and his sisters have jobs,

515
00:35:05,392 --> 00:35:07,968
so they make a living for themselves.

516
00:35:08,475 --> 00:35:10,634
I'm glad to hear that for once.

517
00:35:10,767 --> 00:35:12,326
It's time

518
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:15,202
to do your part and help Seo Jin out.

519
00:35:15,226 --> 00:35:17,801
How long will you just get her help?

520
00:35:18,017 --> 00:35:20,785
He's very considerate of me.

521
00:35:20,809 --> 00:35:22,676
Isn't that so, honey?

522
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,202
Braised pollack was delicious.

523
00:35:26,226 --> 00:35:27,884
It's too far for you to reach.

524
00:35:30,934 --> 00:35:32,592
Eat up.

525
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:37,676
That hurts!

526
00:35:41,725 --> 00:35:43,493
Do you think I'll change my mind?

527
00:35:43,517 --> 00:35:45,285
I don't know why you're doing this,

528
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,202
but you need to stop whining!

529
00:35:47,226 --> 00:35:48,785
There's no couple that can stay married

530
00:35:48,809 --> 00:35:50,785
if they get a divorce for a few fights.

531
00:35:50,809 --> 00:35:52,326
Getting a divorce isn't a joke.

532
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,409
And this period is important to Eun Byeol.

533
00:35:54,433 --> 00:35:56,868
You're so invested in your emotions.

534
00:35:56,892 --> 00:35:59,175
How dare you say something like that?

535
00:35:59,392 --> 00:36:01,493
You have no right to worry about her.

536
00:36:01,517 --> 00:36:03,285
I'll tell your father everything

537
00:36:03,309 --> 00:36:04,968
and divorce you.

538
00:36:07,268 --> 00:36:09,634
Even if we get divorced, I get to decide.

539
00:36:11,101 --> 00:36:12,118
I'm going to make the decision

540
00:36:12,142 --> 00:36:14,050
when I want to divorce you.

541
00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:16,118
You're only concerned about yourself

542
00:36:16,142 --> 00:36:17,451
even in this situation.

543
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:19,300
What you did...

544
00:36:20,976 --> 00:36:22,717
Take your call.

545
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,244
What is it?

546
00:36:30,268 --> 00:36:32,342
It's an emergency, Dr Ha!

547
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:43,366
"Time, operation time, anaesthesia"

548
00:36:58,433 --> 00:37:00,368
Even if we get divorced, I get to decide.

549
00:37:00,392 --> 00:37:01,368
I'm going to make the decision

550
00:37:01,392 --> 00:37:03,342
when I want to divorce you.

551
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,451
There's excessive bleeding, Dr Ha!

552
00:37:08,475 --> 00:37:10,244
Wait, stop the bleeding first.

553
00:37:10,268 --> 00:37:11,202
Suction.

554
00:37:11,226 --> 00:37:12,202
And give me arterial clips.

555
00:37:12,226 --> 00:37:13,285
The bleeding won't stop.

556
00:37:13,309 --> 00:37:14,576
One of the nerves must've been damaged.

557
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,618
What do we do, Dr Ha?

558
00:37:15,642 --> 00:37:16,952
His bleeding is getting worse.

559
00:37:16,976 --> 00:37:17,952
His BP is at 60.

560
00:37:17,976 --> 00:37:19,368
Should we put in more medication?

561
00:37:19,392 --> 00:37:20,618
His BP is dropping!

562
00:37:20,642 --> 00:37:22,160
His condition is deteriorating.

563
00:37:22,184 --> 00:37:23,118
Dr Ha! - Doctor!

564
00:37:23,142 --> 00:37:24,244
What should we do? - Dr Ha!

565
00:37:24,268 --> 00:37:25,202
Dr Ha!

566
00:37:25,226 --> 00:37:26,326
His BP keeps dropping!

567
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:27,326
What should we do?

568
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:28,368
This doesn't look good.

569
00:37:28,392 --> 00:37:30,050
His BP is dropping.

570
00:37:30,184 --> 00:37:31,842
You can't fool me!

571
00:37:31,892 --> 00:37:33,035
Yoon Chul isn't the type

572
00:37:33,059 --> 00:37:34,785
who'd call me first to ask to meet.

573
00:37:34,809 --> 00:37:37,926
There's a problem between you two, right?

574
00:37:38,017 --> 00:37:38,993
No?

575
00:37:39,017 --> 00:37:40,660
We got into a fight,

576
00:37:40,684 --> 00:37:43,342
but it's nothing serious, Dad.

577
00:37:43,392 --> 00:37:45,952
It's just another couple's quarrel.

578
00:37:45,976 --> 00:37:48,077
You stubbornly chose to marry him.

579
00:37:48,101 --> 00:37:49,451
Why haven't you got

580
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:51,175
a hold of your husband's heart?

581
00:37:51,268 --> 00:37:52,785
If you can't keep your family together,

582
00:37:52,809 --> 00:37:55,295
how can you take over Cheonga Foundation?

583
00:37:56,433 --> 00:37:58,368
I can do a good job.

584
00:37:58,392 --> 00:37:59,576
I gave up on becoming

585
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,244
the soloist of the La Scala and came back

586
00:38:01,269 --> 00:38:03,093
to take over that position.

587
00:38:03,184 --> 00:38:04,785
I will never let Seo Young become

588
00:38:04,809 --> 00:38:06,285
the chief director of Cheonga Foundation.

589
00:38:06,309 --> 00:38:08,368
Then do your best to make Yoon Chul stay,

590
00:38:08,392 --> 00:38:10,717
so that there won't be any weird rumours!

591
00:38:12,309 --> 00:38:15,384
No one in our family gets divorced.

592
00:38:15,809 --> 00:38:17,467
If you're going to divorce him,

593
00:38:17,642 --> 00:38:20,050
give up on becoming the chief director.

594
00:39:03,193 --> 00:39:04,810
"Connecting to Black Box"

595
00:39:11,346 --> 00:39:13,420
"Play"

596
00:39:24,892 --> 00:39:27,425
So you saw everything?

597
00:39:37,348 --> 00:39:40,881
"Director Park, Cheonga Medical Centre"

598
00:39:43,392 --> 00:39:44,785
Hello, Director Park.

599
00:39:44,809 --> 00:39:46,160
You must be busy these days.

600
00:39:46,184 --> 00:39:48,326
My husband told me that the hospital

601
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:50,509
has been swamped with patients.

602
00:39:52,309 --> 00:39:53,910
What did you say?

603
00:39:53,934 --> 00:39:55,826
You should've told us

604
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:57,785
about hurting your hand.

605
00:39:57,809 --> 00:39:58,868
The patient may be

606
00:39:58,892 --> 00:40:00,576
paralysed from the waist down.

607
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,118
The family is throwing a fit,

608
00:40:02,142 --> 00:40:03,451
saying they'll sue us.

609
00:40:03,475 --> 00:40:05,368
Get this sorted out,

610
00:40:05,392 --> 00:40:06,576
or you'll have to give up

611
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,535
being appointed as the next director.

612
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:10,035
I'm sorry, sir.

613
00:40:10,059 --> 00:40:11,535
I'll take responsibility for everything.

614
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:13,576
How exactly will you do that?

615
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,035
Do you realise that we're dealing

616
00:40:15,059 --> 00:40:16,701
with our VVIP patient here?

617
00:40:16,725 --> 00:40:18,493
As soon as we get the CCTV footage,

618
00:40:18,517 --> 00:40:20,618
we'll hold a disciplinary hearing

619
00:40:20,642 --> 00:40:22,244
and decide how you should be reprimanded.

620
00:40:22,268 --> 00:40:24,077
As a board member, I'm very sorry

621
00:40:24,101 --> 00:40:26,868
to hear about the outcome of the surgery.

622
00:40:26,892 --> 00:40:28,801
However,

623
00:40:29,642 --> 00:40:30,910
isn't it impossible to prove

624
00:40:30,934 --> 00:40:33,326
that it was caused by medical malpractice?

625
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:35,842
We should get it sorted out

626
00:40:35,976 --> 00:40:37,952
as quickly and quietly as possible.

627
00:40:37,976 --> 00:40:39,244
I agree,

628
00:40:39,268 --> 00:40:41,368
but the family won't settle easily--

629
00:40:41,392 --> 00:40:43,634
Isn't it your job to figure that out

630
00:40:44,433 --> 00:40:46,926
as someone in that position?

631
00:40:47,976 --> 00:40:48,910
It was an accident

632
00:40:48,934 --> 00:40:50,160
that occurred unexpectedly

633
00:40:50,184 --> 00:40:52,160
while treating a critical illness.

634
00:40:52,184 --> 00:40:54,576
Unless he's found guilty of malpractice,

635
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,285
we will not take responsibility.

636
00:40:57,309 --> 00:40:59,467
Do you want to lose a competent doctor

637
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,035
just because of a small mistake?

638
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:03,326
All legal matters

639
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:04,785
regarding the compensation

640
00:41:04,809 --> 00:41:06,785
will be handled by

641
00:41:06,809 --> 00:41:09,801
this smart, sexy attorney, Lee Kyu Jin.

642
00:41:11,184 --> 00:41:13,035
Dr Ha.

643
00:41:13,059 --> 00:41:15,326
You and your ladies coming to your rescue.

644
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:16,326
If this goes well,

645
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:18,701
you should be good to your wife.

646
00:41:18,725 --> 00:41:21,009
This is all thanks to Seo Jin.

647
00:41:22,767 --> 00:41:25,285
Is this fun for you?

648
00:41:25,309 --> 00:41:28,050
My gosh, this is so boring.

649
00:41:30,433 --> 00:41:31,868
Those who have a lot

650
00:41:31,892 --> 00:41:34,175
don't appreciate what they have.

651
00:41:35,517 --> 00:41:37,826
Stand tall. Don't be discouraged.

652
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:39,326
You won't lose your licence

653
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:40,326
over something like this.

654
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:42,618
Shut it. I don't need your help.

655
00:41:42,642 --> 00:41:44,077
You're nothing without me.

656
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:44,993
We're husband and wife,

657
00:41:45,017 --> 00:41:46,592
no matter what others say.

658
00:41:47,268 --> 00:41:48,576
Do you think I wouldn't know

659
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,160
why you need me?

660
00:41:50,184 --> 00:41:52,409
The director of Cheonga Foundation.

661
00:41:52,433 --> 00:41:53,743
That's the only reason.

662
00:41:53,767 --> 00:41:56,451
Your father will be extremely displeased

663
00:41:56,475 --> 00:41:58,326
if your family's reputation is tainted.

664
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,050
Am I wrong?

665
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,701
Did you see me

666
00:42:02,725 --> 00:42:05,050
with Chairman Joo?

667
00:42:06,226 --> 00:42:07,576
So what?

668
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,701
What? - It's nothing.

669
00:42:09,725 --> 00:42:11,202
It can happen

670
00:42:11,226 --> 00:42:12,868
to any married couple, you know?

671
00:42:12,892 --> 00:42:14,160
It's like a car accident,

672
00:42:14,184 --> 00:42:15,118
just like how you were

673
00:42:15,142 --> 00:42:16,285
attracted to Yoon Hee.

674
00:42:16,309 --> 00:42:18,217
Have you lost your mind?

675
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,993
How dare you spew such crazy nonsense.

676
00:42:21,017 --> 00:42:22,493
You cheated on me with Joo Dan Tae.

677
00:42:22,517 --> 00:42:24,202
The person I loathe the most!

678
00:42:24,226 --> 00:42:26,092
You're one to talk!

679
00:42:26,268 --> 00:42:27,952
You also spent time with Oh Yoon Hee,

680
00:42:27,976 --> 00:42:29,759
whom I loathe the most.

681
00:42:30,684 --> 00:42:32,910
So let's just get a divorce.

682
00:42:32,934 --> 00:42:34,244
Do you want me to be a mere decoration

683
00:42:34,268 --> 00:42:35,826
in your life, like an idiot?

684
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:37,576
Yes!

685
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,285
You can't even do that?

686
00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:42,160
What have you even done for me? Nothing!

687
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:45,300
It's time you did something for me!

688
00:42:45,684 --> 00:42:47,285
What? Divorce?

689
00:42:47,309 --> 00:42:48,326
I made it clear to you

690
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:49,576
that it will not happen

691
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,868
until I want a divorce.

692
00:42:50,892 --> 00:42:52,801
You're insane.

693
00:42:53,017 --> 00:42:54,993
You know, the situation you're in now...

694
00:42:55,017 --> 00:42:56,743
It's not an easy one.

695
00:42:56,767 --> 00:42:58,160
If I don't help you,

696
00:42:58,184 --> 00:43:00,743
the hospital will blame everything on you.

697
00:43:00,767 --> 00:43:02,535
Then you'll lose your licence

698
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:04,701
and be ostracised from the industry.

699
00:43:04,725 --> 00:43:06,467
Eun Byeol?

700
00:43:09,767 --> 00:43:11,576
I will never let you take her.

701
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,326
I'll get custody and the house.

702
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:15,326
The court will side with me

703
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:16,701
since you've contributed nothing

704
00:43:16,725 --> 00:43:17,993
to our assets.

705
00:43:18,017 --> 00:43:19,118
Cheon Seo Jin!

706
00:43:19,142 --> 00:43:21,009
However,

707
00:43:21,767 --> 00:43:22,826
if you come back home

708
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:23,993
as if nothing happened,

709
00:43:24,017 --> 00:43:25,326
I will do whatever it takes

710
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:28,050
to silence the patient's family.

711
00:43:29,309 --> 00:43:31,467
Because you're my husband.

712
00:43:31,725 --> 00:43:33,160
The choice is yours,

713
00:43:33,184 --> 00:43:35,133
but I won't wait too long.

714
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:36,285
I'll tell Eun Byeol

715
00:43:36,309 --> 00:43:38,342
that you're away at a conference.

716
00:43:52,475 --> 00:43:54,217
My gosh.

717
00:43:54,433 --> 00:43:56,217
I feel so bad for you.

718
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,576
You see, about your divorce...

719
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,244
I don't think it'll be easy.

720
00:44:00,268 --> 00:44:02,035
You'd better make a wise decision.

721
00:44:02,059 --> 00:44:03,701
You'll lose your job and your daughter.

722
00:44:03,725 --> 00:44:05,535
You'll just be a pitiful divorced man.

723
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:07,868
Gosh, don't do that to yourself.

724
00:44:07,892 --> 00:44:09,160
Just stay married to the daughter

725
00:44:09,184 --> 00:44:11,077
of Cheonga Foundation's chief director

726
00:44:11,101 --> 00:44:12,326
and keep living the life

727
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:14,175
that every man dreams of.

728
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:18,676
Dr Ha, your life

729
00:44:18,809 --> 00:44:21,259
is in Seo Jin's hands.

730
00:44:26,059 --> 00:44:27,717
Text me.

731
00:44:35,892 --> 00:44:39,259
Seo Jin is really something.

732
00:44:39,433 --> 00:44:40,660
How could she be so unashamed

733
00:44:40,684 --> 00:44:42,160
about having an affair?

734
00:44:42,184 --> 00:44:44,092
Very impressive.

735
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:01,326
I found this phone

736
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:03,425
inside the air handling unit.

737
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:06,133
I'm sure the owner will come for it.

738
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:12,050
Excuse me.

739
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:14,175
That mobile phone.

740
00:45:14,350 --> 00:45:16,244
I think it belongs to someone I know.

741
00:45:16,268 --> 00:45:17,968
Thanks.

742
00:45:20,325 --> 00:45:21,467
"Hacking Passcode"

743
00:45:21,492 --> 00:45:22,517
"Hacking Complete, Passcode: 1201"

744
00:45:22,542 --> 00:45:24,325
Nice.

745
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:25,968
You know, the passcode...

746
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,793
I figured it out.

747
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:31,009
Already? - Yes.

748
00:45:31,059 --> 00:45:32,493
Amazing.

749
00:45:32,517 --> 00:45:34,660
My daughter cried her eyes out

750
00:45:34,684 --> 00:45:37,759
because she forgot her passcode.

751
00:45:38,725 --> 00:45:40,160
Isn't my daughter so pretty?

752
00:45:40,184 --> 00:45:41,759
Yes, she is.

753
00:45:42,059 --> 00:45:43,701
She looks just like you.

754
00:45:43,725 --> 00:45:45,244
My goodness. You may go now.

755
00:45:45,268 --> 00:45:46,532
Okay.

756
00:45:47,725 --> 00:45:49,160
All right.

757
00:45:49,184 --> 00:45:51,660
Let's see if she's studying hard.

758
00:45:51,684 --> 00:45:53,384
Let's see.

759
00:45:59,767 --> 00:46:03,259
Oh, this is... My gosh.

760
00:46:04,767 --> 00:46:07,801
Goodness, this is...

761
00:46:08,767 --> 00:46:10,717
Oh, boy.

762
00:46:15,542 --> 00:46:17,284
Joo Dan Tae.

763
00:46:17,309 --> 00:46:19,092
Cheon Seo Jin.

764
00:46:19,184 --> 00:46:21,326
You two were being blackmailed

765
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:22,409
by Min Seol A.

766
00:46:22,433 --> 00:46:24,968
The two of you killed her.

767
00:46:25,184 --> 00:46:26,968
How dare you drag us into it.

768
00:46:30,809 --> 00:46:33,926
I'm holding this trump card.

769
00:46:34,309 --> 00:46:36,467
Just wait and see how I'll use this.

770
00:46:37,767 --> 00:46:40,550
You won't be disappointed.

771
00:46:54,725 --> 00:46:56,884
You'll get a sunburn.

772
00:46:59,559 --> 00:47:02,202
I thought you might need these.

773
00:47:02,226 --> 00:47:03,868
Pain-relief patches? Why?

774
00:47:03,892 --> 00:47:05,160
I saw you

775
00:47:05,184 --> 00:47:07,384
getting beaten by the PE teacher.

776
00:47:08,017 --> 00:47:10,300
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

777
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:12,050
It's not your fault.

778
00:47:13,017 --> 00:47:15,660
Hey, why are you taking your shirt off?

779
00:47:15,684 --> 00:47:17,035
So I can put that on.

780
00:47:17,059 --> 00:47:18,884
Hand it over.

781
00:47:22,184 --> 00:47:24,009
Good luck on your audition.

782
00:47:25,767 --> 00:47:27,425
Thanks.

783
00:47:27,559 --> 00:47:29,300
You too.

784
00:47:46,850 --> 00:47:49,077
What happened? Are you hurt?

785
00:47:49,101 --> 00:47:50,535
No, I'm fine.

786
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:51,743
I heard the PE teacher beat you up.

787
00:47:51,767 --> 00:47:53,509
Is it true?

788
00:47:53,725 --> 00:47:56,217
I won't let him get away with this.

789
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,717
Don't tell Dad.

790
00:47:58,850 --> 00:48:00,993
Why get involved in Ro Na's problem?

791
00:48:01,017 --> 00:48:01,993
I get that you thought

792
00:48:02,017 --> 00:48:03,244
it was me, but still.

793
00:48:03,268 --> 00:48:04,618
He's keeping a watchful eye on you.

794
00:48:04,642 --> 00:48:06,467
Stay out of trouble.

795
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:08,743
Why should I be worried?

796
00:48:08,767 --> 00:48:11,092
I know who did it.

797
00:48:12,142 --> 00:48:13,576
It was Eun Byeol.

798
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:16,244
What? - Eun Byeol did it.

799
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:17,576
I saw it.

800
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:18,826
When we were at Ro Na's place,

801
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:20,576
I saw Eun Byeol in Ro Na's room.

802
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,968
I'm sure of it. It was her.

803
00:48:23,017 --> 00:48:23,993
Why would she do that?

804
00:48:24,017 --> 00:48:25,368
She has a crush on you,

805
00:48:25,392 --> 00:48:27,576
so she wanted to get Ro Na in trouble.

806
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,451
I bet she's super upset,

807
00:48:29,475 --> 00:48:31,717
thinking you're interested in Ro Na.

808
00:48:32,142 --> 00:48:33,326
It's ridiculous. How could she think

809
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:34,785
that's even possible?

810
00:48:34,809 --> 00:48:36,326
Ha Eun Byeol and Bae Ro Na.

811
00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:38,592
If those two get into a fight,

812
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:41,384
the ambassador role may become mine.

813
00:48:42,392 --> 00:48:45,175
You'll help me, right? Let's go.

814
00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:50,402
"Cheonga Arts High School"

815
00:49:12,048 --> 00:49:13,888
*"We're glad to welcome our future students of Cheonga"

816
00:49:41,059 --> 00:49:43,175
"Hera Palace Operation Committee Meeting"

817
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,662
"Regarding the eviction of Oh Yoon Hee"

818
00:49:45,976 --> 00:49:48,160
Do you really have to do this?

819
00:49:48,184 --> 00:49:49,535
What then?

820
00:49:49,559 --> 00:49:51,535
Did you expect the two of us to live

821
00:49:51,559 --> 00:49:53,368
peacefully in the same building?

822
00:49:53,392 --> 00:49:55,993
Today will be your last day here.

823
00:49:56,017 --> 00:49:57,409
You got to sleep here a few nights,

824
00:49:57,433 --> 00:49:58,993
so consider yourself successful.

825
00:49:59,017 --> 00:50:00,077
You can brag about it

826
00:50:00,101 --> 00:50:01,618
for the rest of your life.

827
00:50:01,642 --> 00:50:02,868
Get ready for the meeting.

828
00:50:02,892 --> 00:50:04,509
It starts at 7 p.m.

829
00:50:12,892 --> 00:50:14,160
I gathered

830
00:50:14,184 --> 00:50:15,618
all the key members

831
00:50:15,642 --> 00:50:17,451
of the committee today because

832
00:50:17,475 --> 00:50:19,077
I received a formal complaint

833
00:50:19,101 --> 00:50:20,868
about the new resident in Unit 4502

834
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:22,868
being a disgrace to Hera Palace

835
00:50:22,892 --> 00:50:24,368
and everything it stands for.

836
00:50:24,392 --> 00:50:25,326
We're here to decide

837
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:26,743
whether she should be evicted.

838
00:50:26,767 --> 00:50:28,660
If you think she should be evicted,

839
00:50:28,684 --> 00:50:29,993
select "Agree".

840
00:50:30,017 --> 00:50:32,409
If you don't think she should be evicted,

841
00:50:32,433 --> 00:50:34,701
select "Disagree".

842
00:50:34,725 --> 00:50:36,326
Wait.

843
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:39,118
I think it's unfair to call her a disgrace

844
00:50:39,142 --> 00:50:41,743
because she's a victim herself.

845
00:50:41,767 --> 00:50:43,368
Isn't it considered abuse of power

846
00:50:43,392 --> 00:50:45,077
to evict her like this?

847
00:50:45,101 --> 00:50:46,701
We received a formal complaint,

848
00:50:46,725 --> 00:50:48,868
so we have to follow the rules.

849
00:50:48,892 --> 00:50:51,952
Oh, my husband is away for a conference.

850
00:50:51,976 --> 00:50:53,785
So unfortunately, he couldn't make it.

851
00:50:53,809 --> 00:50:55,077
If Dr Ha isn't here,

852
00:50:55,101 --> 00:50:56,576
we don't even need to vote.

853
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,701
I mean, who'd be against her eviction?

854
00:50:58,725 --> 00:51:00,326
Maybe he predicted this or something.

855
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:02,244
Dr Ha already gave me

856
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:04,660
power of attorney and cast his vote

857
00:51:04,684 --> 00:51:07,175
before he left.

858
00:51:09,017 --> 00:51:11,092
What a dedicated husband.

859
00:51:11,268 --> 00:51:15,676
All right, let's begin.

860
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:20,993
Well...

861
00:51:21,017 --> 00:51:23,342
This needs to be kept confidential,

862
00:51:23,725 --> 00:51:25,550
so get up and turn around.

863
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:43,467
"Agree"

864
00:51:47,559 --> 00:51:49,217
"Agree"

865
00:51:49,642 --> 00:51:51,217
"Disagree"

866
00:51:58,475 --> 00:52:00,217
Let's count the votes.

867
00:52:00,892 --> 00:52:02,535
Do you mind?

868
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:06,801
Then I'll start counting them.

869
00:52:07,184 --> 00:52:08,660
"Agree"

870
00:52:08,684 --> 00:52:10,300
"Agree."

871
00:52:12,059 --> 00:52:13,676
"Agree: 1, Disagree: 0"

872
00:52:15,433 --> 00:52:17,175
"Agree."

873
00:52:18,684 --> 00:52:20,163
"Agree: 2, Disagree: 0"

874
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:23,050
"Agree."

875
00:52:24,226 --> 00:52:25,618
We already have

876
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:27,993
three people who voted for her eviction.

877
00:52:28,017 --> 00:52:29,285
My goodness.

878
00:52:29,309 --> 00:52:30,368
She just unpacked,

879
00:52:30,392 --> 00:52:32,300
and she's already getting kicked out.

880
00:52:33,559 --> 00:52:35,342
Continue.

881
00:52:36,433 --> 00:52:38,175
"Disagree"

882
00:52:39,017 --> 00:52:40,676
"Disagree."

883
00:52:45,101 --> 00:52:48,342
That must be you, Soo Ryeon.

884
00:52:49,684 --> 00:52:51,717
"Disagree: 1"

885
00:52:52,789 --> 00:52:54,489
"Disagree."

886
00:52:57,684 --> 00:52:59,035
That must be Dr Ha.

887
00:52:59,059 --> 00:53:02,409
Okay. That should be it, right?

888
00:53:02,433 --> 00:53:04,826
That means it's five against two--

889
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:06,634
"Disagree."

890
00:53:11,017 --> 00:53:13,409
What? Who voted against this?

891
00:53:13,433 --> 00:53:15,244
I swear, I stayed loyal.

892
00:53:15,268 --> 00:53:16,409
Calm down.

893
00:53:16,433 --> 00:53:18,285
There's one more vote left.

894
00:53:18,309 --> 00:53:19,785
That last vote

895
00:53:19,809 --> 00:53:22,300
will decide her fate.

896
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:41,217
"Disagree."

897
00:53:41,517 --> 00:53:42,701
This is absurd!

898
00:53:42,725 --> 00:53:44,701
What is wrong with you people?

899
00:53:44,725 --> 00:53:47,217
Darn it. - Congratulations.

900
00:53:48,517 --> 00:53:49,826
Goodness gracious.

901
00:53:49,850 --> 00:53:52,326
"Agree: 3, Disagree: 4"

902
00:53:52,350 --> 00:53:54,050
This is...

903
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,676
"Disagree: 4"

904
00:54:00,809 --> 00:54:02,717
Who in the world

905
00:54:03,559 --> 00:54:05,550
voted against it?

906
00:54:08,684 --> 00:54:10,467
Shouldn't it

907
00:54:10,809 --> 00:54:13,717
be kept confidential?

908
00:54:22,101 --> 00:54:23,451
Thank you.

909
00:54:23,475 --> 00:54:25,576
Thank you very much for accepting me

910
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:27,842
as your neighbour.

911
00:54:27,934 --> 00:54:30,285
I won't cause trouble

912
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:31,826
and do my best to fit in.

913
00:54:31,850 --> 00:54:33,926
Thank you again.

914
00:54:43,101 --> 00:54:44,244
Honey, did you see

915
00:54:44,268 --> 00:54:45,825
Ms Cheon's face earlier?

916
00:54:45,850 --> 00:54:49,175
She was so annoyed by the results.

917
00:54:49,550 --> 00:54:51,152
By the way,

918
00:54:51,176 --> 00:54:52,068
how is it possible

919
00:54:52,092 --> 00:54:53,485
that four people voted against it?

920
00:54:53,509 --> 00:54:55,588
Who betrayed us?

921
00:54:55,613 --> 00:54:57,522
I wonder too.

922
00:55:01,303 --> 00:55:02,622
Why?

923
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:05,330
Have you ever given Ro Na

924
00:55:05,355 --> 00:55:08,180
a warm hug, even just once?

925
00:55:08,382 --> 00:55:11,540
All you ever cared about was money!

926
00:55:13,884 --> 00:55:15,959
"Disagree"

927
00:55:16,809 --> 00:55:18,826
Can I ask you

928
00:55:18,850 --> 00:55:21,342
whenever I have questions?

929
00:55:22,184 --> 00:55:24,384
And treat you like my friend?

930
00:55:26,309 --> 00:55:28,467
"Disagree"

931
00:55:30,642 --> 00:55:32,493
It obviously wasn't you, right?

932
00:55:32,517 --> 00:55:34,160
If neither of us voted against it,

933
00:55:34,184 --> 00:55:36,409
it means Chairman Joo and Ma Ri

934
00:55:36,433 --> 00:55:38,118
betrayed us.

935
00:55:38,142 --> 00:55:39,451
I didn't think they'd do this to us.

936
00:55:39,475 --> 00:55:42,175
They're too soft-hearted and weak-willed.

937
00:55:42,226 --> 00:55:43,968
I'm going to the gym.

938
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:46,618
Oh, right.

939
00:55:46,642 --> 00:55:49,279
Call my mum and see how she's doing.

940
00:55:50,809 --> 00:55:53,133
What a joke.

941
00:55:55,802 --> 00:55:57,050
Hey.

942
00:55:57,655 --> 00:56:00,230
You promised to help me find my mum.

943
00:56:01,101 --> 00:56:03,092
Please keep that promise.

944
00:56:03,226 --> 00:56:05,244
Why do you want to find your mum?

945
00:56:05,268 --> 00:56:07,235
She abandoned you.

946
00:56:07,475 --> 00:56:09,833
I just want to check something.

947
00:56:12,184 --> 00:56:14,388
I want to see how she's doing.

948
00:56:14,892 --> 00:56:17,515
How do you want her to be doing?

949
00:56:19,226 --> 00:56:22,801
I want her to be as miserable as I am.

950
00:56:31,934 --> 00:56:34,910
I want her to be as miserable as I am.

951
00:56:35,276 --> 00:56:36,326
"Playing"

952
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:38,993
I want her to be as miserable as I am.

953
00:56:39,017 --> 00:56:40,077
"Rewind"

954
00:56:40,101 --> 00:56:43,384
I want her to be as miserable as I am.

955
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:58,467
Ms Sim,

956
00:57:00,101 --> 00:57:02,968
you don't deserve to be this happy.

957
00:57:23,517 --> 00:57:26,092
My, this is beautiful.

958
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:28,785
I made it myself.

959
00:57:28,809 --> 00:57:31,217
I hope we all get along.

960
00:57:31,725 --> 00:57:33,701
Thanks for this. Join us, Yoon Hee.

961
00:57:33,725 --> 00:57:34,826
Okay.

962
00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:36,451
My gosh, this looks delicious.

963
00:57:36,475 --> 00:57:38,576
How did you make all this?

964
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:40,576
Ms Cheon will get mad at us

965
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,926
if she finds out about this.

966
00:57:43,475 --> 00:57:46,202
My gosh, you actually made all this?

967
00:57:46,226 --> 00:57:48,842
You're incredibly talented.

968
00:57:49,017 --> 00:57:50,592
My gosh!

969
00:57:52,517 --> 00:57:54,160
It's so good.

970
00:57:54,184 --> 00:57:55,368
Does it taste okay?

971
00:57:55,392 --> 00:57:57,175
It's pretty good.

972
00:57:58,268 --> 00:57:59,884
Let's see.

973
00:58:04,350 --> 00:58:05,368
My gosh!

974
00:58:05,392 --> 00:58:07,133
What is this?

975
00:58:10,364 --> 00:58:13,772
"2020 Student Ambassador Audition"

976
00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:17,217
My gosh! - Gorgeous!

977
00:58:17,642 --> 00:58:19,035
You look stunning!

978
00:58:19,059 --> 00:58:20,388
So pretty!

979
00:58:21,992 --> 00:58:23,426
Well done, Je Ni.

980
00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:24,843
Next.

981
00:58:24,867 --> 00:58:26,567
Ha Eun Byeol.

982
00:58:28,009 --> 00:58:29,566
"Cheon Seo Jin"

983
00:58:29,591 --> 00:58:31,136
"2020 Student Ambassador Audition"

984
00:58:32,211 --> 00:58:32,854
"Cheon Seo Jin"

985
00:58:32,879 --> 00:58:36,010
Ha Eun Byeol! - Ha Eun Byeol!

986
00:58:36,034 --> 00:58:38,218
Nice, you look very natural.

987
00:58:38,242 --> 00:58:39,718
Tell us your goal.

988
00:58:39,742 --> 00:58:42,052
If I'm given this opportunity,

989
00:58:42,076 --> 00:58:43,344
I'll do my very best

990
00:58:43,368 --> 00:58:44,718
to tell the whole world

991
00:58:44,742 --> 00:58:47,859
about how amazing our school is.

992
00:58:48,742 --> 00:58:50,426
Excellent.

993
00:58:50,450 --> 00:58:51,926
She's moving on to the next round.

994
00:58:51,950 --> 00:58:53,567
All agreed, right?

995
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,135
Next.

996
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:01,233
Joo Seok Hoon.

997
00:59:02,159 --> 00:59:04,150
"Cheon Seo Jin"

998
00:59:09,312 --> 00:59:10,917
"We love you, Princess Yoo Je Ni"

999
00:59:12,409 --> 00:59:14,942
I have to say, Seok Hoon is hot.

1000
00:59:22,450 --> 00:59:25,650
Seok Hoon, you passed the camera test.

1001
00:59:27,717 --> 00:59:29,357
"Cheon Seo Jin"

1002
00:59:31,755 --> 00:59:33,539
Good luck.

1003
00:59:34,076 --> 00:59:35,308
Thanks.

1004
00:59:36,742 --> 00:59:38,484
Lee Min Hyuk.

1005
00:59:40,784 --> 00:59:44,275
I asked you all to come here.

1006
00:59:44,326 --> 00:59:46,551
You saw the video, so I'm sure you know

1007
00:59:46,575 --> 00:59:48,676
that it's not a negligible issue.

1008
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:50,344
Since all of you

1009
00:59:50,368 --> 00:59:52,233
taught your kids wrong,

1010
00:59:52,284 --> 00:59:54,942
you also deserve to be punished.

1011
00:59:55,242 --> 00:59:57,260
You'll each have to complete

1012
00:59:57,284 --> 00:59:58,718
10 hours of volunteer work.

1013
00:59:58,742 --> 01:00:00,135
Any objections?

1014
01:00:00,159 --> 01:00:02,010
Ten hours? - No, not at all.

1015
01:00:02,034 --> 01:00:03,676
Instead of setting a good example

1016
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:04,843
as parents, we were busy

1017
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:07,068
trying to cover up their wrongdoings.

1018
01:00:07,368 --> 01:00:10,010
We will gladly accept any punishment.

1019
01:00:10,034 --> 01:00:11,302
What about Ms Cheon?

1020
01:00:11,326 --> 01:00:13,468
Shouldn't she be punished too?

1021
01:00:13,492 --> 01:00:15,135
Eun Byeol was also involved.

1022
01:00:15,159 --> 01:00:16,885
Oh, she's at the audition right now

1023
01:00:16,909 --> 01:00:18,468
as one of the judges,

1024
01:00:18,492 --> 01:00:20,218
so she couldn't join.

1025
01:00:20,242 --> 01:00:22,593
She doesn't want to be punished with us.

1026
01:00:22,617 --> 01:00:25,901
She's way too proud for that, of course.

1027
01:00:26,784 --> 01:00:27,990
My gosh!

1028
01:00:28,492 --> 01:00:30,901
Hello, sir!

1029
01:00:32,159 --> 01:00:33,302
Look who's here.

1030
01:00:33,326 --> 01:00:35,426
It's Seok Hoon's mother.

1031
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:37,218
Is Chairman Joo doing well?

1032
01:00:37,242 --> 01:00:38,885
Yes, thanks to you.

1033
01:00:38,909 --> 01:00:40,760
Thank you

1034
01:00:40,784 --> 01:00:42,901
for all your support for the school.

1035
01:00:43,867 --> 01:00:45,859
Mr Gu. - Yes, sir.

1036
01:00:45,909 --> 01:00:48,509
Did you have to include Ms Sim in this?

1037
01:00:48,533 --> 01:00:49,718
Sir, please.

1038
01:00:49,742 --> 01:00:51,776
I'm responsible for what happened.

1039
01:00:52,117 --> 01:00:55,218
I also hope that the kids will receive

1040
01:00:55,242 --> 01:00:59,150
the punishment that they deserve, sir.

1041
01:01:04,742 --> 01:01:06,676
What? - What did you say?

1042
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:07,760
We're doing this so our kids

1043
01:01:07,784 --> 01:01:09,052
won't have to be punished.

1044
01:01:09,076 --> 01:01:11,302
Why must you make the situation worse?

1045
01:01:11,326 --> 01:01:12,718
Will you take responsibility if our kids

1046
01:01:12,742 --> 01:01:14,593
don't get into Seoul National University?

1047
01:01:14,617 --> 01:01:16,218
Why is going to that school so important?

1048
01:01:16,242 --> 01:01:17,885
What? Are you kidding me?

1049
01:01:17,909 --> 01:01:20,260
It's really important to me.

1050
01:01:20,284 --> 01:01:21,676
I made Min Hyuk take up vocal music

1051
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:23,302
so he could go to that school.

1052
01:01:23,326 --> 01:01:24,385
Everyone in my husband's family

1053
01:01:24,409 --> 01:01:25,801
either went to that school,

1054
01:01:25,825 --> 01:01:27,052
Stanford, or Oxford.

1055
01:01:27,076 --> 01:01:29,010
If Min Hyuk doesn't get in,

1056
01:01:29,034 --> 01:01:30,260
they'll all blame me

1057
01:01:30,284 --> 01:01:32,484
and say he takes after me.

1058
01:01:35,742 --> 01:01:37,093
What should we do first?

1059
01:01:37,117 --> 01:01:38,968
I really like

1060
01:01:38,992 --> 01:01:42,400
your enthusiasm.

1061
01:01:42,659 --> 01:01:46,385
It's a great day to clean, isn't it?

1062
01:01:46,409 --> 01:01:47,385
Why don't we start

1063
01:01:47,409 --> 01:01:49,942
with sorting rubbish for recycling?

1064
01:01:50,492 --> 01:01:51,426
"Recycling"?

1065
01:01:51,450 --> 01:01:53,344
"Rubbish"? - "Recycling"?

1066
01:01:53,368 --> 01:01:55,760
My hair looks too nice for this.

1067
01:01:55,784 --> 01:01:58,344
Exactly. - What are we doing here?

1068
01:01:58,368 --> 01:02:01,525
You should pull this up like this.

1069
01:02:02,492 --> 01:02:05,109
Give it some more volume.

1070
01:02:05,368 --> 01:02:09,068
I'll do it too. Like this! All the way up!

are working very hard,

1074
01:02:28,368 --> 01:02:31,801
but I see that you're slacking off.

1075
01:02:31,825 --> 01:02:33,468
Don't you see that I'm doing it too?

1076
01:02:33,492 --> 01:02:36,344
Don't just act like you're doing the work.

1077
01:02:36,368 --> 01:02:38,817
Put in more effort. Work harder!

Gosh, I can't stand her.

1083
01:03:02,533 --> 01:03:05,109
She talks as if she already won the title.

1084
01:03:05,409 --> 01:03:07,551
Actually, I'm kind of surprised.

1085
01:03:07,575 --> 01:03:09,400
She's pretty talented.

1086
01:03:15,242 --> 01:03:17,468
Your voice sounds hoarse.

1087
01:03:17,492 --> 01:03:19,561

Do you like Seok Hoon?

Must I answer that?

I'm warning you.

Stay away from Seok Hoon.

Don't talk to him or smile at him.

Don't even say hi to him.

1099
01:03:52,034 --> 01:03:53,177
I won't listen to you.

1100

What?

1101
01:03:54,201 --> 01:03:55,901
Listen up.

can represent our school together.

Gosh.

Yes, of course!

1115
01:04:45,867 --> 01:04:47,926
We've been sweeping and cleaning so hard

1116
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:49,968
that our arms are about to fall off.

Okay, sure.

Ms Sim, do you

1119
01:04:54,492 --> 01:04:57,093
not apply any pressure when you clean?

1120
01:04:57,117 --> 01:04:59,150
Look at all the dust.

Please come with me.

1122
01:05:04,409 --> 01:05:06,776
We also need to clean the toilet.

1123
01:05:08,784 --> 01:05:10,218
Please, not the toilet.

1124

Oh, you ladies

can just sit down and take a break.

Come with me.

Come on!

1133
01:05:34,034 --> 01:05:36,817
Seok Hoon was the instigator, you know.

1134
01:05:37,326 --> 01:05:38,843
You're still cleaning?

1135

Can you please talk to Mr Gu?

Where is he?

Come on.

1142
01:06:02,575 --> 01:06:03,468
You volunteered to be punished

1143
01:06:03,492 --> 01:06:05,109
in your kids' place.

1144
01:06:05,450 --> 01:06:07,650
Do you even feel sorry for what they did?

1145
01:06:08,450 --> 01:06:10,302
You're doing it wrong.

1146
01:06:10,326 --> 01:06:12,426
Scrub harder with this.

1147
01:06:12,450 --> 01:06:14,968
Try this one too.

1148
01:06:14,992 --> 01:06:16,968
You can use everything in this basket.

1149

Clean it properly, please.

1150
01:06:23,659 --> 01:06:26,052
Why are you doing this to me?

1151
01:06:26,076 --> 01:06:27,344
It seems like

1152
01:06:27,368 --> 01:06:29,567
you have it out for me.

1153
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:33,843
Why?

1154
01:06:33,867 --> 01:06:36,010
Are you starting to get angry because

1155
01:06:36,034 --> 01:06:38,426
you're doing what you never had to do?

1156
01:06:38,450 --> 01:06:39,468
You feel responsible

1157
01:06:39,492 --> 01:06:40,968
for what your kids did?

1158
01:06:40,992 --> 01:06:45,233
I suppose you love your kids very much.

1159
01:06:45,992 --> 01:06:48,150
Or is this all just a show?

1160
01:06:48,492 --> 01:06:50,302
Is this an act of noblesse oblige

1161
01:06:50,326 --> 01:06:52,426
to protect Chairman Joo's reputation?

1162
01:06:52,450 --> 01:06:53,926
Why are you

1163
01:06:53,950 --> 01:06:55,426
so angry with me?

1164
01:06:55,450 --> 01:06:57,302
I'm not angry with you.

1165
01:06:57,326 --> 01:06:59,344
I'm just jealous

1166
01:06:59,368 --> 01:07:02,192
because you look too happy.

1167
01:07:02,217 --> 01:07:04,042
Although I'm not sure

1168
01:07:04,867 --> 01:07:07,233
how much longer that happiness will last.

1169
01:07:08,409 --> 01:07:10,426
Don't be so evasive. Just tell me.

1170
01:07:10,450 --> 01:07:12,942
What is it that you want to say?

1171
01:07:13,909 --> 01:07:17,734
Stop being so fake, lady.

1172
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:20,275
They're not even your real kids.

1173

What...

1174
01:07:26,950 --> 01:07:28,776
What did you just say?

1175
01:07:29,409 --> 01:07:32,567
You have another daughter.

1176
01:07:33,909 --> 01:07:35,734
Who are you?

1177
01:07:36,076 --> 01:07:38,109
Do you want to know who I am?

1178
01:07:38,867 --> 01:07:42,233
I know you're Min Seol A's mother.

1180

Tell everyone Min Seol A is your daughter.

1181
01:08:20,159 --> 01:08:22,218
If you say anything about her,

1182
01:08:22,242 --> 01:08:23,260
I'll make you pay for it.

1183
01:08:23,284 --> 01:08:24,718
Gu Ho Dong may not be his real name.

1184
01:08:24,742 --> 01:08:26,593
Only we know about this.

1185

That's all I have.

1186
01:08:28,117 --> 01:08:29,635
Do you like baseball? - Baseball?

1187
01:08:29,659 --> 01:08:31,593
Who is that? BK?

1188
01:08:31,617 --> 01:08:33,135
Isn't that Kim Byung Hyun?

1189
01:08:33,159 --> 01:08:35,260
I'll get a divorce soon. - What?

1190
01:08:35,284 --> 01:08:37,010
Hi, guys. How have you been?

1191
01:08:37,034 --> 01:08:38,093
Min Seol A isn't dead?

1192
01:08:38,117 --> 01:08:39,218
Where is the shoe?

1193
01:08:39,242 --> 01:08:40,801
One of our parents

1194
01:08:40,825 --> 01:08:42,218
killed Min Seol A.

1195
01:08:42,242 --> 01:08:44,650
I will make your life miserable.

1196
01:08:44,675 --> 01:08:46,501
Brace yourself.
