Where's Joo Hye In?

00:01:02,334 --> 00:01:03,643
Where are you hiding her?

8
00:01:03,667 --> 00:01:05,867
Somewhere you'll never find.

9
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:10,700
You can't dare to kill her again.

10
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,185
Tell me.

11
00:01:17,209 --> 00:01:18,685
Where's that brat?

12
00:01:18,709 --> 00:01:20,810
How dare you treat me like a fool?

13
00:01:20,834 --> 00:01:23,117
You don't deserve to be called human.

14
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:24,685
You worthless scumbag.

15
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,409
You're a murderer.

16
00:01:30,876 --> 00:01:32,976
That doesn't matter at all.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,393
Since we know

18
00:01:34,417 --> 00:01:36,727
more about each other now,

19
00:01:36,751 --> 00:01:39,393
we can become a happier couple.

20
00:01:39,417 --> 00:01:41,326
You're a psycho.

21
00:01:42,459 --> 00:01:44,159
You're

22
00:01:44,542 --> 00:01:46,518
too classy,

23
00:01:46,542 --> 00:01:49,310
elegant, and beautiful.

24
00:01:49,334 --> 00:01:51,185
A woman like you

25
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:53,059
should be punished

26
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:54,976
for deceiving your husband

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,976
and planning to backstab him.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,659
I must punish you!

29
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,409
After you're punished,

30
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,742
everything will go back

31
00:02:06,792 --> 00:02:08,700
to where it should be.

32
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,242
Where do you think you're going?

33
00:02:28,292 --> 00:02:31,326
We still have much to discuss.

34
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,894
You need to leave this house, Ms. Sim.

35
00:02:50,918 --> 00:02:52,476
I can't leave my children here.

36
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,685
Ms. Sim.

37
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:55,268
Do you want to die in his hands?

38
00:02:55,292 --> 00:02:56,393
You need to go now!

39
00:02:56,417 --> 00:02:58,659
I have to take my kids.

40
00:02:58,834 --> 00:03:00,534
Sim Soo Ryeon!

41
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,576
Where did you go, Soo Ryeon?

42
00:03:07,334 --> 00:03:09,367
Sim Soo Ryeon!

43
00:03:09,626 --> 00:03:11,476
Ms. Yang, I'll make sure I'll come back

44
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,976
for my kids.

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,518
Please look after Seok Hoon and Seok Kyung

46
00:03:14,542 --> 00:03:15,810
until I come back.

47
00:03:15,834 --> 00:03:17,742
I'm going to kill you.

48
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:29,768
Secretary Cho,

49
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:32,367
bring Soo Ryeon to me right now.

50
00:03:33,792 --> 00:03:35,268
Seok Hoon?

51
00:03:35,292 --> 00:03:36,909
You punk.

52
00:03:38,667 --> 00:03:40,326
Let go!

53
00:03:40,584 --> 00:03:42,492
Let her go.

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,560
If you go after her, I'll tell everyone

55
00:03:44,584 --> 00:03:46,326
that Seol A died here

56
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,268
at Hera Palace.

57
00:03:48,292 --> 00:03:50,034
You punk.

58
00:03:55,792 --> 00:03:57,518
Hit me if you want to.

59
00:03:57,542 --> 00:03:59,117
Go ahead.

60
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,992
Beat me up as you wish. Hit me!

61
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:07,576
I'm not scared...

62
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,825

Hye In left safely.

65

She'll call you

66
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:38,367
once she arrives in the US.

67
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:43,117
Thank you.

68
00:04:43,709 --> 00:04:45,393
I'm returning Seol A's favour now

69
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:47,159
because I couldn't before.

70
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:51,075
Mr. Hong will take her to the hospital,

71
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,200
so don't be worried.

72
00:04:54,667 --> 00:04:55,976
Are you all right?

73
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,659
You couldn't say goodbye to her.

74
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:00,618
I didn't think...

75
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,700
I could let her go if I saw her.

76
00:05:07,209 --> 00:05:08,810
Seol A,

77
00:05:08,834 --> 00:05:10,576
Hye In,

78
00:05:11,626 --> 00:05:13,742
and even Seok Hoon and Seok Kyung

79
00:05:15,334 --> 00:05:18,117
wouldn't have suffered like this

80
00:05:20,167 --> 00:05:23,242
if they had a better mum than me.

81
00:05:25,834 --> 00:05:27,618
It's because I was foolish.

82
00:05:29,626 --> 00:05:31,367
It's my fault.

83
00:05:32,876 --> 00:05:35,950
I feel like I made my kids unhappy.

84
00:05:38,667 --> 00:05:40,950
That's what drives me crazy.

85
00:05:51,876 --> 00:05:53,867
Once we're all done here,

86
00:05:54,542 --> 00:05:56,909
I'll take you to be with Hye In.

87
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:03,783
Come to the States with me.

88
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,351
I'll help you

89
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:06,643
get a second chance at life,

90
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:08,367
away from Joo Dan Tae.

91
00:06:11,417 --> 00:06:13,075
Do you think

92
00:06:13,834 --> 00:06:17,200
I deserve a second chance at life?

93
00:06:18,459 --> 00:06:20,742
I'm not the victim.

94
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:23,409
I am...

95
00:06:26,709 --> 00:06:28,018
also the mother of the assailants

96
00:06:28,042 --> 00:06:30,242
who bullied Seol A and drove her to death.

97
00:06:33,667 --> 00:06:35,783
My child...

98
00:06:37,292 --> 00:06:40,034
was murdered by my other children.

99
00:06:43,334 --> 00:06:46,034
I can't forgive myself for that.

100

No.

101
00:06:49,626 --> 00:06:52,117
I'll make you happy.

102

I have to keep the last promise

103
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,727
I made with Seol A.

104

Did you find her?

Joo Hye In just left Korea to the US.

116

120

I haven't found her yet.

121
00:08:22,292 --> 00:08:23,976
I have everyone out looking for her.

122

If you have time to make an excuse,

124
00:08:26,834 --> 00:08:29,242
run out there and find her!

It's me, Joo Dan Tae.

You don't have to feel guilty.

132
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:15,935
She also used me

133
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:18,602
to get her daughter's revenge.

134
00:09:18,626 --> 00:09:19,894
All I have to do now

135

is to keep my daughter safe.

136
00:09:37,751 --> 00:09:39,451
Whoa.

137
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:42,867
You look kind of different.

138
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:45,034
Do I?

139
00:09:51,417 --> 00:09:53,700
Why did you want to see me?

140
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,435
There's a special secret between us.

141
00:09:57,459 --> 00:09:59,700
I thought we could grab a drink.

142
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,185
But we shouldn't be meeting this late,

143
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:03,992
should we?

144
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,768
Soo Ryeon and I are close.

145
00:10:06,792 --> 00:10:08,451
Did you forget?

146
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,018
If that concerned you,

147
00:10:11,042 --> 00:10:12,867
you wouldn't be here.

148
00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:15,367
Isn't that so?

149
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,971
"Soo Ryeon"

unless you want to keep a secret from her.

152

Hello?

153
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,518
Yoon Hee, why couldn't I reach you?

154
00:11:00,542 --> 00:11:02,783
I called you a lot today.

155
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,768
Sorry, Soo Ryeon.

156
00:11:04,792 --> 00:11:06,894
Something came up.

157
00:11:06,918 --> 00:11:09,075
I ran out of the penthouse.

158
00:11:09,918 --> 00:11:11,351
What do you mean?

159
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:14,242
Dan Tae is involved in Seol A's death.

160
00:11:14,292 --> 00:11:15,727
Please come to the police station tomorrow

161
00:11:15,751 --> 00:11:17,226
and bear witness on Seol A's death.

162
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,117
You're the only one I can trust right now.

163
00:11:20,334 --> 00:11:21,643
I must

164
00:11:21,667 --> 00:11:23,268
catch her murderer.

165
00:11:23,292 --> 00:11:25,534
Please help me, Yoon Hee.

166
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:30,326
Yoon Hee.

167
00:11:30,542 --> 00:11:32,326
Are you listening to me?

168
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,492
Yoon Hee.

169
00:11:37,792 --> 00:11:39,492
Do you know

170
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:42,284
where my wife is

171
00:11:42,584 --> 00:11:44,284
right now?

172
00:11:47,292 --> 00:11:49,034
If I tell you,

173
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,284
what can you do

174
00:11:52,542 --> 00:11:54,534
for me?

175
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,326
Everything

176
00:11:57,626 --> 00:11:59,284
you want.

177
00:12:43,618 --> 00:12:46,696
"Soo Ryeon"

178
00:13:23,584 --> 00:13:25,742
What have I done?

179
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,034
I'll be at the lounge.

180
00:14:00,626 --> 00:14:02,618
Let's eat breakfast together.

181
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,560
I'll take coffee first.

182
00:14:10,584 --> 00:14:12,284
Yes, ma'am.

183
00:14:14,876 --> 00:14:17,226
If you have questions, go ahead and ask.

184
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,435
I'm sure there's a reason why

185
00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:20,200
you waited for me.

186
00:14:20,876 --> 00:14:22,576
Of course.

187
00:14:22,918 --> 00:14:25,018
You're that straightforward.

188
00:14:25,042 --> 00:14:26,560
That's you, Yoon Hee.

189
00:14:26,584 --> 00:14:28,685
I've been thinking,

190
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:29,685
and I wanted to know why

191
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:30,976
you suddenly changed

192
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,351
your attitude towards me.

193
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:35,242
I'm sure there's a marvellous reason.

194
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,409
If you think about it,

195
00:14:38,876 --> 00:14:41,685
I'm your close friend's husband

196
00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:43,992
who's having an affair with the woman

197
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,935
you loathe the most.

198
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:48,059
Soo Ryeon and your marriage

199
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:50,059
was already over long ago.

200
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,852
And you're about to end

201
00:14:51,876 --> 00:14:54,451
your relationship with Seo Jin as well.

202
00:14:55,209 --> 00:14:56,894
Why do you think so?

203
00:14:56,918 --> 00:14:59,200
I could tell at the villa

204
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,825
by the way you treated her.

205
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,310
You looked at her with a face of a man

206
00:15:04,334 --> 00:15:06,867
who was sick and tired of her.

207
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:08,852
That's how it looked to me.

208
00:15:08,876 --> 00:15:10,492
And?

209
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:12,950
That means

210
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:14,992
you aren't with anyone right now.

211
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,867
And you were attracted to me too.

212
00:15:19,542 --> 00:15:21,867
Need I say more?

213
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:27,825
You're such an interesting woman.

214
00:15:27,876 --> 00:15:30,351
I especially like

215
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,852
how you betrayed my wife.

216
00:15:32,876 --> 00:15:35,159
I never betrayed her.

217
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,909
She's the one who betrayed me first.

218
00:15:38,584 --> 00:15:40,393
She had been putting on an act

219
00:15:40,417 --> 00:15:42,351
pretending to care for me

220
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,618
and help me.

221
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,143
And I finally found out

222
00:15:47,167 --> 00:15:48,909
everything was a lie.

223
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:51,075
Dan Tae,

224
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:52,935
she had been using me

225
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,768
to destroy you.

226
00:15:54,792 --> 00:15:56,310
So?

227
00:15:56,334 --> 00:15:58,034
What's your plan?

228
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:01,018
Do you want to get your revenge on her?

229
00:16:01,042 --> 00:16:02,783
Anything and everything.

230
00:16:03,792 --> 00:16:05,825
If it can keep me safe,

231
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,742
I'll do anything.

232
00:16:07,876 --> 00:16:10,618
You caught my fancy.

233
00:16:11,334 --> 00:16:13,059
You're honest,

234
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,950
fearless,

235
00:16:16,167 --> 00:16:18,075
and beautiful.

236
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,200
Make use of me.

237
00:16:22,584 --> 00:16:24,742
I might be able to tell you

238
00:16:24,876 --> 00:16:27,200
something you want to know.

239
00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:31,742
I want to know where Soo Ryeon is.

240
00:16:32,334 --> 00:16:34,576
I want to know who's helping her

241
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:36,143
and what

242
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:38,034
her plan is.

243
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,909
Ms. Cheon, it's me.

244
00:16:57,334 --> 00:16:58,685
What happened?

245
00:16:58,709 --> 00:17:00,476
Do you know who sent the video?

246
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,101
I couldn't find the sender.

247
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,268
You said you got rid of everything.

248
00:17:04,292 --> 00:17:06,326
Why did something like this happen?

249
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:08,768
Someone was there on that day.

250
00:17:08,792 --> 00:17:10,727
Someone saw me!

251
00:17:10,751 --> 00:17:11,643
All of the CCTV footage

252
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:12,643
from that day is gone,

253
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:13,643
so I couldn't find out

254
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:15,492
who was at the school that day.

255
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,143
Stop saying you can't do this and that

256
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:19,185
like a broken record

257
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:20,560
and find a way to do it.

258
00:17:20,585 --> 00:17:23,452
Do whatever it takes to find who this is.

259
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,700
Find out who took that video

260
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:29,810
and who dared to threaten me like this.

261
00:17:29,834 --> 00:17:31,618
I'll make sure I'll find out.

262
00:17:36,792 --> 00:17:38,518
Once I catch you,

263
00:17:38,542 --> 00:17:40,284
I'll kill you.

264
00:17:53,292 --> 00:17:55,560
Where have you been this early,

265
00:17:55,584 --> 00:17:57,326
dressed up like that?

266
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,783
Wait.

267
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:08,393
Did you spend the night out?

268
00:18:08,417 --> 00:18:09,976
What about you?

269
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,518
It looks like you didn't get any sleep.

270
00:18:12,542 --> 00:18:13,768
What is it?

271
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:16,534
Is something worrying you?

272
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:18,534
Wait,

273
00:18:19,334 --> 00:18:22,059
is your boyfriend unreachable?

274
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:25,075
That's none of your business.

275
00:18:27,959 --> 00:18:29,810
This is my final warning.

276
00:18:29,834 --> 00:18:31,852
Stop lurking around Chairman Joo

277
00:18:31,876 --> 00:18:34,159
and get away from him.

278
00:18:35,042 --> 00:18:36,768
Don't you have any pride?

279
00:18:36,792 --> 00:18:38,101
The one who lurks around him

280
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,143
without any pride

281
00:18:40,167 --> 00:18:41,867
doesn't sound like me,

282
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,783
but you.

283
00:18:44,417 --> 00:18:46,018
I saw how tough it is for Chairman Joo

284
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,976
as I work close to him.

285
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,685
So it's my advice to you.

286
00:18:49,709 --> 00:18:50,602
What?

287
00:18:50,626 --> 00:18:52,810
Don't trust men too much.

288
00:18:52,834 --> 00:18:53,894
The most useless

289
00:18:53,918 --> 00:18:55,783
and fickle thing in the world

290
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:56,935
is the heart of a man.

291
00:18:56,959 --> 00:18:59,200
Watch your words.

292
00:18:59,542 --> 00:19:01,268
Now that I'm Cheonga's chief director,

293
00:19:01,292 --> 00:19:02,476
your daughter

294
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,476
won't get into college,

295
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,685
let alone graduate from high school.

296
00:19:04,709 --> 00:19:06,326
I'm not sure.

297
00:19:06,417 --> 00:19:08,742
We'll find out with time.

298
00:19:09,584 --> 00:19:11,310
I'm not sure if you could continue

299
00:19:11,334 --> 00:19:13,909
to keep your place.

300
00:19:18,417 --> 00:19:20,185
Wait, was that video

301
00:19:20,209 --> 00:19:22,576
sent to me by Yoon Hee?

302
00:19:41,751 --> 00:19:43,435
Why couldn't you be reached?

303
00:19:43,459 --> 00:19:45,159
You called?

304
00:19:47,709 --> 00:19:49,059
Where are you coming from?

305
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,476
I just got back from a business trip.

306
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,367
I have to shower and get to work.

307
00:19:53,751 --> 00:19:55,367
I'll call you later.

308
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:04,284
She became such an annoying woman.

309
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,742
Joo Dan Tae.

310
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,534
You're getting more and more rude.

311
00:20:21,918 --> 00:20:22,810
What about the kids?

312
00:20:22,834 --> 00:20:23,976
They've gone to school.

313
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,101
You still haven't found Soo Ryeon?

314
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,727
Her phone is turned off,

315
00:20:27,751 --> 00:20:29,825
and she's not at work either.

316
00:20:32,334 --> 00:20:34,367
You idiot.

317
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:39,643
I heard

318
00:20:39,667 --> 00:20:42,059
you've been helping her behind my back.

319
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,226
You've stabbed me in the back

320
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,393
after 10 years of kindness

321
00:20:44,417 --> 00:20:46,367
that I've shown you.

322
00:20:46,542 --> 00:20:48,393
This is disappointing, Ms. Yang.

323
00:20:48,417 --> 00:20:51,451
I can't make any excuses, Chairman Joo.

324
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:55,576
Our kids liked you very much, Ms. Yang.

325
00:21:01,751 --> 00:21:03,451
How long has it been

326
00:21:03,584 --> 00:21:04,518
since you betrayed me

327
00:21:04,542 --> 00:21:06,143
and began to work for her?

328
00:21:06,167 --> 00:21:07,976
I never betrayed you.

329
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,602
How could I dare to betray--

330
00:21:09,626 --> 00:21:11,143
Do not make any excuses.

331
00:21:11,167 --> 00:21:12,393
You put on her clothes

332
00:21:12,417 --> 00:21:14,659
and pretended to be her.

333
00:21:14,834 --> 00:21:15,935
Did she tell you

334
00:21:15,959 --> 00:21:17,700
to help her give me the slip?

335
00:21:21,959 --> 00:21:23,768
I'm sorry, Chairman Joo.

336
00:21:23,792 --> 00:21:25,727
Please forgive me just this once.

337
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:26,852
I will make sure I'll repay you

338
00:21:26,876 --> 00:21:28,018
if you let me live.

339
00:21:28,042 --> 00:21:29,059
I'll live my life

340
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,894
only for you until the day I die.

341
00:21:30,918 --> 00:21:31,976
Take her away.

342
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,518
Chairman Joo, please.

343
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:34,727
No, Chairman Joo.

344
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:35,685
No.

345
00:21:35,709 --> 00:21:37,226
No, please. Let me stay.

346
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,518
I can't leave this house even if I died.

347
00:21:39,542 --> 00:21:41,852
I'd rather have you kill me.

348
00:21:41,876 --> 00:21:42,976
Chairman Joo!

349
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,268
Actually, a guy named Gu Ho Dong

350
00:21:44,292 --> 00:21:45,685
had something on me.

351
00:21:45,709 --> 00:21:47,602
So I had no other choice.

352
00:21:47,626 --> 00:21:49,284
Halt.

353
00:21:51,542 --> 00:21:53,200
Gu Ho Dong?

354
00:21:53,709 --> 00:21:55,659
Something on you?

355
00:22:02,709 --> 00:22:04,185
Everyone, you've done well

356
00:22:04,209 --> 00:22:05,685
through your midterms.

357
00:22:05,709 --> 00:22:06,685
Don't go out playing

358
00:22:06,709 --> 00:22:08,643
just because this test is over.

359
00:22:08,667 --> 00:22:10,435
You can calm yourselves down

360
00:22:10,459 --> 00:22:12,268
and prepare for the finals.

361
00:22:12,292 --> 00:22:13,393
- Come on.
- Please.

362
00:22:13,417 --> 00:22:15,075
- No way.
- We don't want to.

363
00:22:18,918 --> 00:22:20,976
My dad and your mum are seeing each other.

364
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,700
They're guilty of disgusting adultery.

365
00:22:25,876 --> 00:22:27,226
Now you know.

366
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,351
So stop causing a scene

367
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:30,909
before we end up humiliating ourselves.

368
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,101
No. No!

369
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:34,810
No!

370
00:22:34,834 --> 00:22:36,185
Eun Byeol, what's wrong?

371
00:22:36,209 --> 00:22:37,894
Did the stress from the tests get to you?

372
00:22:37,918 --> 00:22:39,310
Did you ruin today's test too?

373
00:22:39,334 --> 00:22:41,909
Stop asking her so many questions.

374
00:22:41,959 --> 00:22:43,393
Eun Byeol, are you okay?

375
00:22:43,417 --> 00:22:45,034
Is something going on?

376
00:22:46,334 --> 00:22:48,518
I have a headache.

377
00:22:48,542 --> 00:22:50,825
I need to go to the infirmary.

378
00:23:26,158 --> 00:23:27,118
"Wrong pattern"

379
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:35,783
What are you doing here?

380
00:23:41,417 --> 00:23:43,783
Why are you trying to unlock my phone?

381
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:45,783
Mum.

382
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:47,825
By any chance...

383
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:50,034
Did you...

384
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:52,393
No, never mind.

385
00:23:52,417 --> 00:23:53,393
What's wrong?

386
00:23:53,417 --> 00:23:54,310
What's going on?

387
00:23:54,334 --> 00:23:56,700
Don't touch me with your disgusting hand!

388
00:23:59,792 --> 00:24:01,409
What?

389
00:24:01,918 --> 00:24:03,534
Disgusting?

390
00:24:05,292 --> 00:24:08,534
How dare you talk to your mum like that?

391
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,919
I am

392
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,492
totally disappointed in you.

393
00:24:17,709 --> 00:24:18,976
Eun Byeol!

394
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,700
Ha Eun Byeol!

395
00:24:34,459 --> 00:24:36,867
Does she know something?

396
00:25:13,459 --> 00:25:14,560
You're here.

397
00:25:14,584 --> 00:25:16,284
Hey.

398
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,976
I'm sorry I kept avoiding your calls.

399
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,852
All kinds of thoughts

400
00:25:24,876 --> 00:25:27,326
ran through my head after what you said.

401
00:25:28,542 --> 00:25:31,034
I think I needed time to sort it out.

402
00:25:31,792 --> 00:25:34,576
You said that our friendship was true.

403
00:25:35,959 --> 00:25:37,185
I'll believe you.

404
00:25:37,209 --> 00:25:38,867
Thank you

405
00:25:39,626 --> 00:25:40,976
for understanding.

406
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,909
You said that

407
00:25:43,751 --> 00:25:45,909
a mother does everything she can

408
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,310
for her children.

409
00:25:48,334 --> 00:25:49,852
At times,

410
00:25:49,876 --> 00:25:51,950
she even becomes a wicked vixen.

411
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,685
I want to know who's helping her

412
00:25:54,709 --> 00:25:56,226
and what

413
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,075
her plan is.

414
00:26:01,292 --> 00:26:03,492
Did my husband call you?

415
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,059
At this point,

416
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:09,075
he's probably dying to find me.

417
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,117
Not yet.

418
00:26:12,751 --> 00:26:14,310
Don't worry.

419
00:26:14,334 --> 00:26:15,518
I won't tell him

420
00:26:15,542 --> 00:26:17,310
that I met you.

421
00:26:17,334 --> 00:26:19,992
Of course, I trust you, Yoon Hee.

422
00:26:20,542 --> 00:26:21,935
But

423
00:26:21,959 --> 00:26:23,852
I'm just worried you might

424
00:26:23,876 --> 00:26:26,242
get in trouble because of me.

425
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:28,727
You don't have time to worry about me.

426
00:26:28,751 --> 00:26:30,435
Why did you run out of your house?

427
00:26:30,459 --> 00:26:32,326
What about your kids?

428
00:26:32,709 --> 00:26:34,492
I'm going to end everything

429
00:26:34,751 --> 00:26:36,700
with that man.

430
00:26:38,083 --> 00:26:39,867
It's time.

431
00:26:44,626 --> 00:26:46,284
Time to reveal...

432
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,894
the murderer behind Seol A's death?

433
00:26:49,918 --> 00:26:52,200
Everyone who was involved in her death

434
00:26:52,417 --> 00:26:54,326
must be punished.

435
00:26:55,209 --> 00:26:57,435
Joo Dan Tae, Cheon Seo Jin,

436
00:26:57,459 --> 00:27:00,159
and everyone else in Hera Club.

437
00:27:00,834 --> 00:27:02,810
I'll pay them back

438
00:27:02,834 --> 00:27:04,518
just as Seol A's life got trampled.

439
00:27:04,542 --> 00:27:06,576
What if you get hurt?

440
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,393
You already know

441
00:27:08,417 --> 00:27:10,867
how powerful everyone at Hera Palace is,

442
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,976
especially Dan Tae and Seo Jin.

443
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,284
They won't be easy to deal with.

444
00:27:15,626 --> 00:27:17,783
Do you think they'll let you hurt them?

445
00:27:17,918 --> 00:27:20,284
These people killed my daughter.

446
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,643
How can I let them go on

447
00:27:21,667 --> 00:27:23,242
when I know who did this?

448
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,810
What if it happened to you?

449
00:27:24,834 --> 00:27:27,268
If they did that to Ro Na,

450
00:27:27,292 --> 00:27:29,284
could you just sit on your hands?

451
00:27:31,834 --> 00:27:33,867
It's heartbreaking

452
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:36,909
that Seol A passed away,

453
00:27:38,667 --> 00:27:41,268
but I don't want you to get hurt.

454
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:42,768
On top of that,

455
00:27:42,792 --> 00:27:44,852
you don't have any solid evidence.

456
00:27:44,876 --> 00:27:45,976
All you remember

457
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,618
is seeing Seo Jin's ruby ring.

458
00:27:48,042 --> 00:27:50,034
Will the police take your word for it?

459
00:27:52,334 --> 00:27:54,435
Just say that you'll stop here.

460
00:27:54,459 --> 00:27:56,101
Please don't do anything.

461
00:27:56,125 --> 00:27:57,518
Then I'll stop here too.

462
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:59,950
Please, Soo Ryeon.

463
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:03,159
You can't live your life

464
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,101
as if nothing had happened

465
00:28:05,125 --> 00:28:07,034
after you committed a crime.

466
00:28:08,667 --> 00:28:10,618
I'm putting my life into this.

467
00:28:12,292 --> 00:28:13,935
I believe

468
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:16,867
the truth will be revealed in any way.

469
00:28:18,167 --> 00:28:19,727
If you tell the police

470
00:28:19,751 --> 00:28:21,143
everything that happened

471
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:22,810
on the night of her death,

472
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:24,226
things will unravel one after the other.

473
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:26,117
I already told you.

474
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:28,367
There's nothing I could say.

475
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:30,284
I was

476
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:32,659
too drunk that night,

477
00:28:33,334 --> 00:28:36,200
and I fell asleep as soon as I got home.

478
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,618
You really...

479
00:28:41,375 --> 00:28:43,451
didn't see anything?

480
00:28:48,959 --> 00:28:51,075
Do you have nothing to tell me?

481
00:28:53,918 --> 00:28:54,935
I really wish

482
00:28:54,959 --> 00:28:56,992
I had seen something for you.

483
00:28:57,042 --> 00:28:59,451
But I really didn't see anything.

484
00:29:01,125 --> 00:29:02,643
So even if I go to the police,

485
00:29:02,667 --> 00:29:04,534
I won't be too helpful.

486
00:29:06,834 --> 00:29:08,451
Is that so?

487
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,326
So where are you staying right now?

488
00:29:14,042 --> 00:29:16,101
You don't have anyone to look after you.

489
00:29:16,125 --> 00:29:18,284
What are you going to do by yourself?

490
00:29:19,042 --> 00:29:20,310
Don't worry.

491
00:29:20,334 --> 00:29:22,200
I'm at a safe place.

492
00:29:23,459 --> 00:29:26,143
Where is that safe place?

493
00:29:26,167 --> 00:29:27,685
I'll let you know right away

494
00:29:27,709 --> 00:29:29,451
as soon as I settle down.

495
00:29:36,959 --> 00:29:38,143
One second.

496
00:29:38,167 --> 00:29:40,992
Hey, Ro Na. I'm a little busy...

497
00:29:41,584 --> 00:29:42,518
Your tests?

498
00:29:42,542 --> 00:29:43,976
You did that well on your tests?

499
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,435
I'm telling you.

500
00:29:45,459 --> 00:29:47,226
I got full marks on two subjects today,

501
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:48,976
but I missed one on social studies.

502
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,268
I think Eun Byeol blew it again.

503
00:29:51,292 --> 00:29:52,268
I told you.

504
00:29:52,292 --> 00:29:54,659
There's no one who can do better than you.

505
00:29:55,209 --> 00:29:56,560
Ro Na, what do you want to eat?

506
00:29:56,584 --> 00:29:59,117
I'll cook everything you want today...

507
00:30:03,709 --> 00:30:04,810
Yes, okay.

508
00:30:04,834 --> 00:30:06,435
See you at home.

509
00:30:06,459 --> 00:30:08,117
I love you, sweetie.

510
00:30:12,209 --> 00:30:14,268
You made up with Ro Na.

511
00:30:14,292 --> 00:30:16,075
I'm so glad.

512
00:30:16,751 --> 00:30:18,018
Yes.

513
00:30:18,042 --> 00:30:19,742
It's all thanks to you.

514
00:30:20,792 --> 00:30:22,992
You look so happy, Yoon Hee.

515
00:30:23,375 --> 00:30:25,034
I'm sorry.

516
00:30:25,417 --> 00:30:27,560
You aren't in a good place right now.

517
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:29,284
Don't say that.

518
00:30:29,751 --> 00:30:32,742
I feel good to see you smile.

519
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:34,825
You already know

520
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:37,242
how much I like you, Yoon Hee.

521
00:30:38,959 --> 00:30:41,226
You're such a wonderful person.

522
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,602
Soo Ryeon,

523
00:30:42,626 --> 00:30:44,976
let's really be friends for life.

524
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,935
Let's not get into fights

525
00:30:46,959 --> 00:30:48,518
or betray each other.

526
00:30:48,542 --> 00:30:51,018
No matter how big of a mistake you make,

527
00:30:51,042 --> 00:30:53,117
I'll never hate you.

528
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,185
What will she do if she finds out

529
00:30:57,209 --> 00:30:58,909
the truth?

530
00:30:59,042 --> 00:31:01,101
She'll lock me up in prison for sure.

531
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:02,268
No.

532
00:31:02,292 --> 00:31:04,659
She might end up killing Ro Na too.

533
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,185
No, pull yourself together, Yoon Hee.

534
00:31:07,209 --> 00:31:09,643
She believes Seo Jin is the murderer.

535
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:11,143
I can't let her catch me.

536
00:31:11,167 --> 00:31:12,950
Think of Ro Na.

537
00:31:14,807 --> 00:31:17,282
"JKING Holdings"

538
00:31:17,367 --> 00:31:19,009
You met her?

539
00:31:19,033 --> 00:31:19,968
Where is she right now?

540
00:31:19,992 --> 00:31:23,067
She hasn't found a place to settle in.

541
00:31:23,367 --> 00:31:24,802
Why didn't you tell me you're seeing her?

542
00:31:24,826 --> 00:31:26,260
You should've called me first.

543
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:27,926
I'm seeing her again very soon.

544
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,343
What about her helper? Did you ask?

545
00:31:29,367 --> 00:31:31,025
Anything out of the ordinary?

546
00:31:31,325 --> 00:31:33,844
She looked the same as usual.

547
00:31:33,868 --> 00:31:35,733
She still looked classy

548
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:38,025
and didn't seem bothered.

549
00:31:39,242 --> 00:31:42,150
She didn't take any of her stuff.

550
00:31:42,826 --> 00:31:46,192
I'm sure someone has been helping her.

551
00:31:46,242 --> 00:31:48,775
There's no way she can make a move alone.

552
00:31:55,159 --> 00:31:57,984
There is someone I'm suspicious of.

553
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:02,150
I'll let you know once I'm sure.

554
00:32:02,742 --> 00:32:04,301
It seems like I finally found myself

555
00:32:04,325 --> 00:32:05,968
a real partner.

556
00:32:05,992 --> 00:32:07,343
Great work.

557
00:32:07,367 --> 00:32:09,942
Feel free to ask me if you need anything.

558
00:32:10,992 --> 00:32:12,650
May I ask you

559
00:32:12,992 --> 00:32:14,900
for a favour right now?

560
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:17,568
Of course. Fire away.

561
00:32:17,909 --> 00:32:20,650
Even something regarding Ro Na?

562
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,385
No one is happy to see you here.

563
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:35,343
Why did you creep back in here?

564
00:32:35,367 --> 00:32:36,968
This isn't a day care for delinquents.

565
00:32:36,992 --> 00:32:38,260
What if I was recording this right now?

566
00:32:38,284 --> 00:32:40,442
Why do you say such things?

567
00:32:41,222 --> 00:32:42,437
"Veritas Lux Mea"

568
00:32:42,909 --> 00:32:44,775
And you're now threatening me.

569
00:32:46,284 --> 00:32:47,926
Please, I ask of you.

570
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:50,051
You're really getting on my nerves,

571
00:32:50,075 --> 00:32:51,301
so please leave the school yourself

572
00:32:51,325 --> 00:32:53,176
for the peace and progress of our school.

573
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,426
Please?

574
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:56,885
Did Ms. Cheon put you up for this?

575
00:32:56,909 --> 00:32:59,135
You're going to bully me and kick me out?

576
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:01,093
Or are you a type who voluntarily obeys

577
00:33:01,117 --> 00:33:02,552
to whoever that's in power?

578
00:33:02,576 --> 00:33:04,051
Gosh, so cheeky.

579
00:33:04,075 --> 00:33:05,677
You're awfully cheeky.

580
00:33:05,701 --> 00:33:07,385
This is exactly why I hate you.

581
00:33:07,409 --> 00:33:08,718
You don't know your place,

582
00:33:08,742 --> 00:33:09,926
and you don't get scared.

583
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:12,093
You don't seem like a type of teacher

584
00:33:12,117 --> 00:33:13,942
that students love either.

585
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,718
You know nothing about love!

586
00:33:18,742 --> 00:33:21,301
You'll never graduate from this school!

587
00:33:21,325 --> 00:33:23,510
I guarantee it over my name!

588
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:24,802
Get it?

589
00:33:24,826 --> 00:33:26,692
Do you get it?

590
00:33:27,284 --> 00:33:28,641
That brat.

591
00:33:29,926 --> 00:33:33,731
"Chairman Joo Dan Tae"

592
00:33:34,292 --> 00:33:35,226
Hello?

593
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:36,852
Giving you my loyalty until the day I die,

594
00:33:36,876 --> 00:33:38,560
this is Ma Doo Ki.

595
00:33:38,584 --> 00:33:39,935
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

596
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,653
"Menu: Medical mode, neck disc problem"

597
00:33:41,678 --> 00:33:43,836
"Please check the chair before you begin"

598
00:33:48,959 --> 00:33:51,700
What brings you to my house?

599
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:55,310
I'm so sorry for barging in without a call

600
00:33:55,334 --> 00:33:56,976
while you are getting some rest.

601
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,894
I've been very rude to you

602
00:33:58,918 --> 00:34:00,976
to this day, Ms. Oh.

603
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,159
What do you mean by that?

604
00:34:05,125 --> 00:34:07,560
Are you talking about how you betrayed us

605
00:34:07,584 --> 00:34:09,101
before the practical test

606
00:34:09,125 --> 00:34:10,935
when Ro Na auditioned for the school?

607
00:34:10,959 --> 00:34:12,476
Or

608
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,852
are you talking about how brazen you were

609
00:34:14,876 --> 00:34:16,768
to show up in Cheonga as a teacher?

610
00:34:16,792 --> 00:34:18,101
Or playing favourites with your students

611
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:19,185
and treating Ro Na with disdain,

612
00:34:19,209 --> 00:34:20,685
only giving her penalty points?

613
00:34:20,709 --> 00:34:23,034
Is that what you're talking about?

614
00:34:23,334 --> 00:34:25,351
I'm not sure exactly what you mean.

615
00:34:25,375 --> 00:34:26,685
It's quite confusing.

616
00:34:26,709 --> 00:34:28,143
Come to think about it,

617
00:34:28,167 --> 00:34:30,742
I've been such a nasty man.

618
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:36,226
I truly apologise.

619
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:37,727
I have no idea

620
00:34:37,751 --> 00:34:39,518
why your attitude suddenly changed,

621
00:34:39,542 --> 00:34:42,326
but that apology didn't feel very sincere.

622
00:34:43,209 --> 00:34:45,727
I didn't know who you were to this day.

623
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:47,018
Had I known you were

624
00:34:47,042 --> 00:34:49,143
one of the closest person to Chairman Joo,

625
00:34:49,167 --> 00:34:51,867
I wouldn't have made such a huge mistake.

626
00:34:53,334 --> 00:34:54,976
I knew you were easily swayed

627
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,810
by people of power,

628
00:34:56,834 --> 00:34:59,700
but you're way too predictable.

629
00:35:00,167 --> 00:35:01,810
It means I'm a guy with a pure heart.

630
00:35:01,834 --> 00:35:03,700
Please consider it cute.

631
00:35:05,542 --> 00:35:07,059
Now that we're at this point,

632
00:35:07,083 --> 00:35:08,894
please let me be frank with you.

633
00:35:08,918 --> 00:35:10,101
From now on, Ro Na will be

634
00:35:10,125 --> 00:35:11,435
under my special management.

635
00:35:11,459 --> 00:35:13,059
No, she already is under my management.

636
00:35:13,083 --> 00:35:15,894
Chairman Joo Dan Tae has given an order.

637
00:35:15,918 --> 00:35:18,560
Under special management?

638
00:35:18,584 --> 00:35:20,435
She will be managed on the same level

639
00:35:20,459 --> 00:35:22,242
as Seok Hoon and Seok Kyung.

640
00:35:22,626 --> 00:35:24,894
Your eyes began to glisten.

641
00:35:24,918 --> 00:35:26,976
If you have anything to ask

642
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,976
regarding Ro Na's school life,

643
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,310
please contact me whenever you wish.

644
00:35:31,334 --> 00:35:33,560
I will take care of everything

645
00:35:33,584 --> 00:35:35,602
as comfortably as you are right now,

646
00:35:35,626 --> 00:35:37,810
deep into your bones and tissues.

647
00:35:37,834 --> 00:35:39,268
To show you a proof that

648
00:35:39,292 --> 00:35:41,351
I've begun Ro Na's special management,

649
00:35:41,375 --> 00:35:42,852
I'll hook you up with an academy

650
00:35:42,876 --> 00:35:44,518
that will help her get top grades.

651
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:45,976
There's such an academy?

652
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,560
It's an academy with the biggest archive

653
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:49,518
of Cheonga's past tests.

654
00:35:49,542 --> 00:35:50,935
It's a secret that no parent

655
00:35:50,959 --> 00:35:52,810
shares with another parent.

656
00:35:52,834 --> 00:35:55,560
All the kids at Hera Palace study there.

657
00:35:55,584 --> 00:35:59,200
Please let me escort you there myself.

658
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,742
My goodness.

659
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:17,783
My gosh.

660
00:36:19,876 --> 00:36:22,742
Something hazy is covering my sight.

661
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,492
The yin energy is far too strong.

662
00:36:29,918 --> 00:36:31,602
Someone's deep resentment is here.

663
00:36:31,626 --> 00:36:32,976
Resentment?

664
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,518
Whose resentment is this?

665
00:36:34,542 --> 00:36:36,618
How would I know?

666
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,700
You two would.

667
00:36:39,042 --> 00:36:41,242
Hey, wait.

668
00:36:41,292 --> 00:36:43,783
Is it Min Seol A...

669
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,560
You don't have to bring her up right now.

670
00:36:46,584 --> 00:36:49,451
The last one. What about the last card?

671
00:36:54,106 --> 00:36:56,223
"Death"

672
00:36:59,459 --> 00:37:01,659
There will be a bloodbath.

673
00:37:02,959 --> 00:37:04,618
Someone

674
00:37:05,167 --> 00:37:07,326
might die soon.

675
00:37:11,415 --> 00:37:13,367
"Death"

676
00:37:13,392 --> 00:37:14,768
That just ruined my day!

677
00:37:14,792 --> 00:37:16,435
I went there to simply ask if Je Ni

678
00:37:16,459 --> 00:37:17,518
can get accepted to Seoul University.

679
00:37:17,542 --> 00:37:18,476
What did she say?

680
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,435
Someone's resentment is here

681
00:37:19,459 --> 00:37:20,476
and people might die?

682
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,101
What a load of nonsense!

683
00:37:22,125 --> 00:37:23,435
Someone said she's a good reader,

684
00:37:23,459 --> 00:37:26,409
so I had to pay extra money to get her.

685
00:37:42,751 --> 00:37:44,742
She'll be under special management.

686
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,783
Under special management.

687
00:37:53,459 --> 00:37:56,992
This means Ro Na is now special too.

688
00:37:57,626 --> 00:38:00,867
If I can do more for her, then...

689
00:38:03,959 --> 00:38:05,867
Please do me a favour too.

690
00:38:06,626 --> 00:38:08,101
Could you stop by my house?

691
00:38:08,125 --> 00:38:09,867
The penthouse?

692
00:38:10,167 --> 00:38:11,810
Pack up some of her things

693
00:38:11,834 --> 00:38:13,975
and tell her that you'll bring it to her.

694
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,894
She'll need a lot of things

695
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:16,492
since she ran out in a hurry.

696
00:38:17,542 --> 00:38:19,200
It's seven o'clock,

697
00:38:19,709 --> 00:38:21,409
so no one should be there.

698
00:38:24,918 --> 00:38:26,648
"Hera Palace"

699
00:38:31,827 --> 00:38:33,734
"Penthouse"

700
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:32,075
How beautiful.

701
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:20,700
I'm sorry. I'll take it off.

702
00:40:28,876 --> 00:40:30,783
I told you

703
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,768
that I'll let you have

704
00:40:32,792 --> 00:40:34,894
anything you want.

705
00:40:34,918 --> 00:40:38,909
Even if it's this penthouse.

706
00:40:39,626 --> 00:40:41,659
Then you'll have to...

707
00:40:42,167 --> 00:40:44,618
get rid of your wife first.

708
00:40:45,751 --> 00:40:47,268
Send her somewhere no one knows about,

709
00:40:47,292 --> 00:40:49,618
somewhere she can never return.

710
00:40:51,167 --> 00:40:54,117
Can you do that?

711
00:40:55,083 --> 00:40:59,034
That's exactly what I want.

712
00:41:22,868 --> 00:41:25,051
I got a call from Hye In.

713
00:41:25,075 --> 00:41:27,317
She's in the hospital in the US.

714
00:41:27,659 --> 00:41:28,593
They did some tests,

715
00:41:28,617 --> 00:41:30,343
and, thankfully, everything seems okay.

716
00:41:30,367 --> 00:41:32,009
Don't worry about Hye In.

717
00:41:32,033 --> 00:41:33,510
She's being treated by the best team

718
00:41:33,534 --> 00:41:35,844
at the number one hospital in the US.

719
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:37,484
Thank you.

720
00:41:39,409 --> 00:41:41,343
How's the contract with Joo Dan Tae going?

721
00:41:41,367 --> 00:41:44,900
We'll finalise everything tomorrow.

722
00:41:45,409 --> 00:41:47,359
It's time to really get started.

723
00:41:47,492 --> 00:41:49,468
I've decided on the date. In three days.

724
00:41:49,492 --> 00:41:51,192
In three days?

725
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:55,067
Do you think they'll admit

726
00:41:55,242 --> 00:41:57,317
to their sins?

727
00:41:57,450 --> 00:41:59,301
We'll make that happen.

728
00:41:59,325 --> 00:42:01,234
They'll take the bait.

729

"Grace Joe's Solo Recital for Children"

730
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,092
"7 p.m., April 25, 2020"

731
00:42:12,117 --> 00:42:14,942
They have to suffer the exact same way...

732
00:42:17,325 --> 00:42:20,526
to realise their sins.

733
00:42:31,242 --> 00:42:32,926
- Have a seat.
- What's going on?

734
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:34,552
He wanted to wait for you,

735
00:42:34,576 --> 00:42:36,442
so he hasn't told me yet.

736
00:42:36,576 --> 00:42:38,051
You must've been alarmed to hear from me

737
00:42:38,075 --> 00:42:39,718
so late at night.

738
00:42:39,742 --> 00:42:41,510
But this is very important

739
00:42:41,534 --> 00:42:43,234
for both of you.

740
00:42:43,868 --> 00:42:45,733
Take a look.

"Claim of Damages"

00:42:48,692 --> 00:42:49,379
For damages

743
00:42:49,404 --> 00:42:51,396
caused by the extramarital affair?

744
00:42:52,868 --> 00:42:54,926
What? She wants 10 billion won?

745
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:55,926
Gosh.

746
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:58,650
Is Sim Soo Ryeon out of her mind?

747
00:43:00,301 --> 00:43:01,426
"Petition for Divorce"

748
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:03,276
A petition for divorce?

749
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:04,593
Gosh, I don't like that

750
00:43:04,617 --> 00:43:06,135
I'm caught in the middle of this.

751
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:08,260
Why did Soo Ryeon have to ask me?

752
00:43:08,284 --> 00:43:10,301
You two should've known when to stop.

753
00:43:10,325 --> 00:43:12,135
But I understand. Love is like that.

754
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:14,343
If she gets what she wants, she'll agree

755
00:43:14,367 --> 00:43:15,760
to a divorce by mutual consent.

756
00:43:15,784 --> 00:43:16,718
She wants you to--

757
00:43:16,742 --> 00:43:18,135
"Give up the penthouse"?

758
00:43:18,159 --> 00:43:19,926
And she wants me to give up custody

759
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:21,552
and all my parental rights?

760
00:43:21,576 --> 00:43:23,718
And I can't even see the kids?

761
00:43:23,742 --> 00:43:25,051
She also wants 90 per cent

762
00:43:25,075 --> 00:43:26,176
of all my assets? What the...

763
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,718
This is utter nonsense.

764
00:43:27,742 --> 00:43:31,176
She basically did everything she could do

765
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,426
to get back at the two of you.

766
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:35,176
Is this funny to you?

767
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,051
You're getting a real kick out of this.

768
00:43:37,075 --> 00:43:38,468
You couldn't even handle your wife?

769
00:43:38,492 --> 00:43:40,926
Why did you have to drag me into this?

770
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:43,135
You shouldn't have let this happen.

771
00:43:43,159 --> 00:43:45,760
I have enough things to worry about.

772
00:43:45,784 --> 00:43:47,885
Why drag me into this mess?

773
00:43:47,909 --> 00:43:49,900
I don't want to hear you say another word.

774
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:51,426
I'm not in the mood

775
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:53,650
to put up with your temper right now.

I went to the penthouse and got

788
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:24,218
some of your clothes and makeup.

"JKING Holdings"

797
00:45:54,325 --> 00:45:56,301
I didn't think you'd decide so quickly.

798
00:45:56,325 --> 00:45:57,844
No, there was plenty of time

799
00:45:57,868 --> 00:45:59,051
to think about it.

800
00:45:59,075 --> 00:46:00,718
Besides, I was mainly convinced

801
00:46:00,742 --> 00:46:02,135
by the fact that you, Mr. Joo...

802
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:03,718
You yourself showed interest

803
00:46:03,742 --> 00:46:05,468
in establishing an investment company,

804
00:46:05,492 --> 00:46:06,677
even with your Myeong-dong land

805
00:46:06,701 --> 00:46:07,593
as collateral.

806
00:46:07,617 --> 00:46:08,552
That was all the commitment

807
00:46:08,576 --> 00:46:09,844
I needed to see.

808
00:46:09,868 --> 00:46:11,135
The problem is,

809
00:46:11,159 --> 00:46:12,343
we need to decide which one of us

810
00:46:12,367 --> 00:46:13,718
will be the CEO of the company.

811
00:46:13,742 --> 00:46:15,176
The position is rightfully yours

812
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,677
considering the investment you made.

813
00:46:16,701 --> 00:46:18,218
But to convince the other investors,

814
00:46:18,242 --> 00:46:19,926
it may be helpful

815
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:22,234
to keep the company under my name.

816
00:46:22,409 --> 00:46:23,760
Oh, yes.

817
00:46:23,784 --> 00:46:26,984
Ms. Oh did mention something about it.

818
00:46:29,325 --> 00:46:30,552
Not a problem.

819
00:46:30,576 --> 00:46:32,426
Things like that shouldn't get in the way

820
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:34,009
of our contract, should it?

821
00:46:34,033 --> 00:46:36,109
I have faith in you, Mr. Joo.

822
00:46:36,325 --> 00:46:37,802
I'll book a meeting with the investors

823
00:46:37,826 --> 00:46:39,343
at the investment briefing next week.

824
00:46:39,367 --> 00:46:40,677
All right. I'm already

00:46:40,701 --> 00:46:42,442
looking forward to it.

826
00:46:42,784 --> 00:46:44,009
Oh, and in celebration of

827
00:46:44,033 --> 00:46:45,385
our successful contract,

828
00:46:45,409 --> 00:46:47,900
I prepared a special little gift for you.

829
00:46:50,992 --> 00:46:52,942
Here you go.

830
00:46:53,450 --> 00:46:54,844
What is this?

831
00:46:54,868 --> 00:46:56,844
Let's just say I have some acquaintance

832
00:46:56,868 --> 00:46:58,218
with Soprano Grace Joe.

833
00:46:58,242 --> 00:47:01,109
Soprano Grace Joe?

834
00:47:01,409 --> 00:47:03,885
She has a solo recital scheduled in Korea.

835
00:47:03,909 --> 00:47:05,051
That's right.

836
00:47:05,075 --> 00:47:06,260
Your daughter.

837
00:47:06,284 --> 00:47:07,968
She's studying opera, right?

838
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:09,677
- Yes.
- So when Grace found out about it,

839
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:11,552
she wanted to hold a concert for her.

840
00:47:11,576 --> 00:47:13,343
Then I thought it'd be a good idea

841
00:47:13,367 --> 00:47:14,426
to invite your daughter

842
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:16,526
and all of her friends as well.

843
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:19,385
The kids will be thrilled.

844
00:47:19,409 --> 00:47:21,343
It's going to be happening this weekend.

845
00:47:21,367 --> 00:47:22,468
Oh, and another thing.

846
00:47:22,492 --> 00:47:23,968
The adults will be invited

847
00:47:23,992 --> 00:47:25,385
to a separate dinner party.

848
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:27,526
We'll send you a limousine.

849
00:47:27,576 --> 00:47:29,468
A dinner party?

850
00:47:29,492 --> 00:47:31,301
This is such a wonderful gift.

851
00:47:31,325 --> 00:47:33,510
I don't know how to thank you for this.

852
00:47:33,534 --> 00:47:34,718
Mr. Joo.

853
00:47:34,742 --> 00:47:36,552
Now that we're officially partners,

854
00:47:36,576 --> 00:47:39,442
there's no need for such formalities.

855
00:47:40,534 --> 00:47:41,885
Your daughter. She's also

856
00:47:41,909 --> 00:47:43,135
studying opera, right?

857
00:47:43,159 --> 00:47:44,942
Yes.

858
00:47:45,284 --> 00:47:47,150
This one's for her.

859
00:47:48,075 --> 00:47:49,176
Thank you, Logan.

860
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,109
Sure thing.

861
00:48:05,659 --> 00:48:08,426
Kids! Let's all take a photo together.

862
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:10,635
My gosh, Je Ni. You look like a princess.

863
00:48:10,659 --> 00:48:12,385
Grace will want to take you

864
00:48:12,409 --> 00:48:14,218
to Italy with her.

865
00:48:14,242 --> 00:48:15,552
One, two, three.

866
00:48:15,576 --> 00:48:16,593
Cheese!

867
00:48:16,617 --> 00:48:18,401
- Cheese!
- Cheese!

868
00:48:18,701 --> 00:48:20,051
Are they that excited?

869
00:48:20,075 --> 00:48:22,650
My gosh, look. They're stoked.

870
00:48:23,242 --> 00:48:26,301
Grace isn't someone you can meet easily.

871
00:48:26,325 --> 00:48:29,385
On top of that, she only invited our kids.

872
00:48:29,409 --> 00:48:30,552
It's a private concert.

873
00:48:30,576 --> 00:48:31,802
That invitation is worth

874
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:33,760
hundreds of millions of won.

875
00:48:33,784 --> 00:48:36,093
Logan is very generous.

876
00:48:36,117 --> 00:48:38,552
He even organised a separate party for us.

877
00:48:38,576 --> 00:48:41,510
This is why I love Americans who were born

878
00:48:41,534 --> 00:48:43,359
with silver spoons in their mouths.

879
00:48:43,659 --> 00:48:44,760
Honey.

880
00:48:44,784 --> 00:48:46,468
Did you remember to bring the gift?

881
00:48:46,492 --> 00:48:47,593
Yes, don't you worry.

882
00:48:47,617 --> 00:48:49,009
It's right here.

883
00:48:49,033 --> 00:48:50,635
What? You prepared a gift

884
00:48:50,659 --> 00:48:51,844
without telling us?

885
00:48:51,868 --> 00:48:53,593
To win him over?

886
00:48:53,617 --> 00:48:54,885
You should've told us.

887
00:48:54,909 --> 00:48:56,093
What is it? Show me.

888
00:48:56,117 --> 00:48:58,635
Come on. Tell me what it is!

889
00:48:58,659 --> 00:48:59,926
By the way, how come Seo Jin

890
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:02,067
and Chairman Joo aren't here yet?

891
00:49:03,242 --> 00:49:06,109
Are they openly seeing each other now?

892
00:49:07,909 --> 00:49:10,135
You don't know what you're talking about.

893
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:14,942
That's not what's going on at the moment.

894
00:49:21,534 --> 00:49:25,051
I don't think things are going too well

895
00:49:25,075 --> 00:49:26,968
between Ms. Cheon and Chairman Joo.

896
00:49:26,992 --> 00:49:28,885
What do you mean?

897
00:49:28,909 --> 00:49:31,093
I heard some stuff

898
00:49:31,117 --> 00:49:33,844
and even saw something.

899
00:49:33,868 --> 00:49:35,552
Why didn't you answer any of my calls?

900
00:49:35,576 --> 00:49:37,677
You haven't given me a proper explanation

901
00:49:37,701 --> 00:49:39,817
as to why you were with her at the villa.

902
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,718
I went there to get some rest.

903
00:49:41,742 --> 00:49:42,926
Then she happened to join me

904
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:44,301
after the team dinner.

905
00:49:44,325 --> 00:49:45,677
She was wearing my clothes.

906
00:49:45,701 --> 00:49:47,135
- The clothes that you bought for me.
- Cut!

907
00:49:47,159 --> 00:49:48,900
Cut!

908
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:51,009
What does Yoon Hee have to do with this?

909
00:49:51,033 --> 00:49:52,260
Exactly.

910
00:49:52,284 --> 00:49:54,385
What does she have to do with any of this?

911
00:49:54,409 --> 00:49:58,109
Will you let me finish?

912
00:49:58,532 --> 00:49:59,718
"Her clothes were ruined,

913
00:49:59,742 --> 00:50:01,135
so she had to get changed."

914
00:50:01,159 --> 00:50:03,692
Do I have to explain everything to you?

915
00:50:03,784 --> 00:50:05,677
Logan has finally signed the deal, right?

916
00:50:05,701 --> 00:50:07,343
So fire her immediately.

917
00:50:07,367 --> 00:50:09,359
Logan wants her around,

918
00:50:09,409 --> 00:50:10,718
and so do I.

919
00:50:10,742 --> 00:50:12,176
What?

920
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:14,650
Be careful. There are many eyes watching.

921
00:50:14,909 --> 00:50:16,385
Don't change the subject.

922
00:50:16,409 --> 00:50:17,926
I don't know what you're thinking,

923
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:19,051
but don't forget the promise

924
00:50:19,075 --> 00:50:20,802
we made when we got back together.

925
00:50:20,826 --> 00:50:23,093
I decide whether we keep seeing each other

926
00:50:23,117 --> 00:50:25,442
or break up.

927
00:50:26,659 --> 00:50:28,343
"I make...

928
00:50:29,950 --> 00:50:31,426
the call."

929
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:33,542
- My gosh.
- See what I mean?

930
00:50:33,567 --> 00:50:35,093
Things must be over between them.

931
00:50:35,117 --> 00:50:37,317
It means they broke up, right?

932
00:50:38,325 --> 00:50:39,593
I thought Oh Yoon Hee

933
00:50:39,617 --> 00:50:42,301
was a naive, quiet lady,

934
00:50:42,325 --> 00:50:44,926
but look at her using all these men

935
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:48,025
to get what she wants. This means...

936
00:50:48,992 --> 00:50:51,926
My gosh, this must've been so hard

937
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:53,260
- for Seo Jin.
- Gosh.

938
00:50:53,284 --> 00:50:54,926
I don't believe this.

939
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:57,510
Yoon Hee and Soo Ryeon are very close.

940
00:50:57,534 --> 00:51:00,677
How... With Soo Ryeon's husband? No way.

941
00:51:00,701 --> 00:51:01,844
I agree.

942
00:51:01,868 --> 00:51:04,385
We all know that she hates Chairman Joo.

943
00:51:04,409 --> 00:51:05,533
Right, Dr. Ha?

944
00:51:05,558 --> 00:51:08,342
You know that they hate each other.

945
00:51:08,367 --> 00:51:09,802
If they hate each other so much,

946
00:51:09,826 --> 00:51:11,802
then how are they working together now?

947
00:51:11,826 --> 00:51:13,760
I could tell at a glance that

948
00:51:13,784 --> 00:51:15,926
there's something going on.

949
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:17,218
She must've been so lonely

950
00:51:17,242 --> 00:51:20,468
living as a single mother all these years.

951
00:51:20,492 --> 00:51:22,387
Enough!

952
00:51:26,117 --> 00:51:28,802
Enough, please.

953
00:51:28,826 --> 00:51:30,051
Gosh.

954
00:51:30,075 --> 00:51:31,468
You startled us.

955
00:51:31,492 --> 00:51:33,510
What's the matter with you now?

956
00:51:33,534 --> 00:51:35,885
Let me tell you what I think.

957
00:51:35,909 --> 00:51:37,926
I don't think it's bad for you

958
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:39,510
to hear this as her ex-husband.

959
00:51:39,534 --> 00:51:40,635
Like how people in other countries

960
00:51:40,659 --> 00:51:42,234
are cool with stuff like this.

961
00:51:43,576 --> 00:51:46,442
Why don't you ask them directly, then?

962
00:51:51,617 --> 00:51:54,009
My gosh!

963
00:51:54,033 --> 00:51:56,968
Gosh, Chief Director Cheon. You're here.

964
00:51:56,992 --> 00:51:59,176
My, Seo Jin...

965
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,218
Oh, my bad.

966
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:02,009
Chief Director Cheon, you look

967
00:52:02,033 --> 00:52:03,468
like an actress today.

968
00:52:03,492 --> 00:52:06,510
That colour looks gorgeous on you.

969
00:52:06,534 --> 00:52:07,677
It really does.

970
00:52:07,701 --> 00:52:09,176
I haven't seen that dress before.

971
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,802
Is it new?

972
00:52:10,826 --> 00:52:13,926
You look stunning, Chief Director Cheon.

973
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:16,301
May I tag along when you go shopping?

974
00:52:16,325 --> 00:52:17,468
I want to learn from you

975
00:52:17,492 --> 00:52:19,359
and refine my taste.

976
00:52:24,868 --> 00:52:26,510
I'm Logan Lee's secretary.

977
00:52:26,534 --> 00:52:28,343
Your ride is here.

978
00:52:28,367 --> 00:52:30,984
So we're leaving now?

979
00:52:31,701 --> 00:52:34,025
- My gosh!
- I'll escort you to the party.

980
00:52:34,450 --> 00:52:36,093
Your kids will enjoy the concert

981
00:52:36,117 --> 00:52:37,900
in the community room.

982
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:39,802
- See you later, Eun Byeol.
- Have fun.

983
00:52:39,826 --> 00:52:41,593
- Kids, behave yourselves.
- Let's go.

984
00:52:41,617 --> 00:52:43,510
- Of course.
- See you.

985
00:52:43,534 --> 00:52:44,760
By the way, I thought

986
00:52:44,784 --> 00:52:45,844
Logan and Yoon Hee were close.

987
00:52:45,868 --> 00:52:48,025
Why didn't he invite her daughter?

988
00:52:51,159 --> 00:52:52,343
What are you doing here?

989
00:52:52,367 --> 00:52:54,885
We wanted to thank you in person.

990
00:52:54,909 --> 00:52:56,593
This is my daughter.

991
00:52:56,617 --> 00:52:58,260
I'm Bae Ro Na.

992
00:52:58,284 --> 00:52:59,844
- Hi.
- I really love Grace Joe.

993
00:52:59,868 --> 00:53:01,859
I'm a huge fan.

994
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:04,510
Thank you so much for inviting my daughter

995
00:53:04,534 --> 00:53:06,484
to this special concert.

996
00:53:06,576 --> 00:53:08,760
Oh, no. It's my pleasure.

997
00:53:08,784 --> 00:53:10,510
Besides, you played a big part

998
00:53:10,534 --> 00:53:12,051
in establishing the contract.

999
00:53:12,075 --> 00:53:14,650
Think of it as a compliment.

1000
00:53:15,617 --> 00:53:16,885
By the way,

1001
00:53:16,909 --> 00:53:18,093
the concert will be held

1002
00:53:18,117 --> 00:53:20,150
at Crystal Hall at this hotel, right?

1003
00:53:20,325 --> 00:53:22,176
The other kids seemed to think

1004
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,176
that it's happening in the community room.

1005
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,051
I think there must've been

1006
00:53:26,075 --> 00:53:27,260
some kind of mix-up.

1007
00:53:27,284 --> 00:53:29,109
I'll be sure to let them know.

1008
00:53:29,325 --> 00:53:30,343
Now, if you'll excuse me.

1009
00:53:30,367 --> 00:53:32,609
I was in the middle of doing something.

1010
00:53:33,950 --> 00:53:36,093
You guys have a great day now.

1011
00:53:36,117 --> 00:53:37,051
Thank you.

1012
00:53:37,075 --> 00:53:38,775
Bye.

1013
00:53:42,784 --> 00:53:44,526
Let's go.

1014
00:53:45,492 --> 00:53:48,426
Where did I see that bag?

1015
00:53:48,450 --> 00:53:51,385
Mum, I'm so excited that I feel like

1016
00:53:51,409 --> 00:53:53,218
my heart is about to burst.

1017
00:53:53,242 --> 00:53:55,677
Will I actually meet Grace Joe today?

1018
00:53:55,701 --> 00:53:57,552
You've asked me that over and over.

1019
00:53:57,576 --> 00:53:58,718
Are you that excited?

1020
00:53:58,742 --> 00:54:00,343
Mum, you're amazing.

1021
00:54:00,367 --> 00:54:02,635
You work with such a hotshot.

1022
00:54:02,659 --> 00:54:04,276
You're so cool, Mum.

1023
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:06,984
Let's go.

1024
00:54:11,868 --> 00:54:13,568
You must've been alarmed.

1025
00:54:14,409 --> 00:54:16,051
I'm fine.

1026
00:54:16,075 --> 00:54:17,942
I'll get going.

1027
00:54:21,284 --> 00:54:22,984
I'll see you later.

1028
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:24,984
Soo Ryeon.

1029
00:54:29,867 --> 00:54:31,634
Be careful.

1030
00:54:31,659 --> 00:54:33,359
You too.

1031
00:54:48,117 --> 00:54:50,109
All right, everyone.

1032
00:54:50,492 --> 00:54:52,455
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

1033
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:53,844
It's been so long since we last

1034
00:54:53,868 --> 00:54:55,135
hung out together like this.

1035
00:54:55,159 --> 00:54:56,176
This is the first time since

1036
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:58,067
Eun Byeol's parents got a divorce.

1037
00:54:58,742 --> 00:55:01,760
Dr. Ha, you're very open-minded.

1038
00:55:01,784 --> 00:55:04,635
You two are divorced but still friends.

1039
00:55:04,659 --> 00:55:06,900
I think it's great.

1040
00:55:07,117 --> 00:55:09,552
Did you really have to come today?

1041
00:55:09,576 --> 00:55:12,677
Goodness, you're the uninvited guest.

1042
00:55:12,701 --> 00:55:14,176
Logan invited me

1043
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,057
because I'm one of the investors.

1044
00:55:16,082 --> 00:55:16,958
"Investor"?

1045
00:55:16,983 --> 00:55:18,510
His joint company will be built

1046
00:55:18,534 --> 00:55:20,718
on the Myeong-dong land I invested in.

1047
00:55:20,742 --> 00:55:22,510
You didn't know?

1048
00:55:22,534 --> 00:55:24,968
My goodness, it looks like Chairman Joo

1049
00:55:24,992 --> 00:55:28,276
keeps many secrets from you.

1050
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:32,276
Men don't do that in the honeymoon phase.

1051
00:55:32,325 --> 00:55:34,301
The kids were so excited.

1052
00:55:34,325 --> 00:55:36,593
I'm grateful to Logan for doing all this.

1053
00:55:36,617 --> 00:55:38,885
But why didn't you bring Soo Ryeon?

1054
00:55:38,909 --> 00:55:41,343
I rarely see her these days.

1055
00:55:41,367 --> 00:55:42,926
Oh, she's away on a trip.

1056
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:44,218
The kids' exams are done,

1057
00:55:44,242 --> 00:55:46,192
so she deserves a break.

1058
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,593
What's with the mood? This is a happy day.

1059
00:55:51,617 --> 00:55:52,926
Come on. Let's all drink.

1060
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:54,885
Everyone, raise your glass.

1061
00:55:54,909 --> 00:55:57,051
Bottoms up. Cheers!

1062
00:55:57,075 --> 00:55:58,135
- Cheers!
- Dr. Ha, you go first.

1063
00:55:58,159 --> 00:55:59,260
- You go first.
- Cheers.

1064
00:55:59,284 --> 00:56:01,150
- Here.
- Cheers!

1065
00:56:01,576 --> 00:56:03,234
All right.

1066
00:56:03,284 --> 00:56:04,942
This is good.

1067
00:56:06,909 --> 00:56:08,468
What a beautiful night.

1068
00:56:08,492 --> 00:56:10,039
Indeed!

1069
00:56:10,644 --> 00:56:11,843
"Grace Joe Solo Concert"

1070
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:13,093
Ta-da!

1071
00:56:13,117 --> 00:56:15,343
I'll get her autograph on this dress.

1072
00:56:15,367 --> 00:56:16,593
And I'll pass it down to my daughter

1073
00:56:16,617 --> 00:56:17,635
as an heirloom!

1074
00:56:17,659 --> 00:56:20,009
We're going to meet the prima donna

1075
00:56:20,033 --> 00:56:22,426
of the New York City Opera!

1076
00:56:22,450 --> 00:56:23,718
She'll perform for us

1077
00:56:23,742 --> 00:56:26,593
and even audition us!

1078
00:56:26,617 --> 00:56:28,019
We should write about this

1079
00:56:28,044 --> 00:56:29,817
in our CVs, right?

1080
00:56:30,534 --> 00:56:32,552
We auditioned in front of Grace Joe.

1081
00:56:32,576 --> 00:56:35,677
But why did she invite us?

1082
00:56:35,701 --> 00:56:36,718
My dad's business partner

1083
00:56:36,742 --> 00:56:37,885
owns a theatre in the US,

1084
00:56:37,909 --> 00:56:40,192
so I guess he knows a lot of musicians.

1085
00:56:40,242 --> 00:56:41,426
In any case, we now know

1086
00:56:41,450 --> 00:56:43,717
that this American guy is actually rich.

1087
00:56:43,742 --> 00:56:45,135
This is an important event,

1088
00:56:45,159 --> 00:56:47,692
so don't make any mistakes.

1089
00:56:59,242 --> 00:57:01,942
Gosh, why am I...

1090
00:57:02,450 --> 00:57:04,568
- so tired all of a sudden?
- Gosh.

1091
00:57:27,826 --> 00:57:29,733
Why isn't she here yet?

1092
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:31,385
Gosh, I wonder too.

1093
00:57:31,409 --> 00:57:33,650
She's really late.

1094
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:36,942
Oh, my mum's calling.

1095
00:57:37,992 --> 00:57:39,176
Mum, are you there yet?

1096
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,859
How's the party? It must be amazing.

1097
00:57:44,367 --> 00:57:47,176
Hello? Mum, why are you all quiet?

1098
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,844
Je Ni! Help me!

1099
00:57:49,868 --> 00:57:51,526
What's wrong, Mum?

1100
00:57:52,826 --> 00:57:55,135
What's wrong? Did something happen?

1101
00:57:55,159 --> 00:57:56,301
I'm not sure.

1102
00:57:56,325 --> 00:57:59,109
My mum suddenly cried for help.

1103
00:58:01,950 --> 00:58:03,301
What's wrong with my phone?

1104
00:58:03,325 --> 00:58:04,718
There's no signal.

1105
00:58:04,742 --> 00:58:06,650
I'll try calling my dad.

1106
00:58:07,075 --> 00:58:08,885
Mum... What's going on?

1107
00:58:08,909 --> 00:58:09,926
Mine's not working either.

1108
00:58:09,950 --> 00:58:11,009
- Really?
- No signal at all.

1109
00:58:11,033 --> 00:58:13,568
Impossible. This is Hera Palace.

1110
00:58:13,784 --> 00:58:14,760
This isn't good.

1111
00:58:14,784 --> 00:58:16,009
I'll try calling outside.

1112
00:58:16,033 --> 00:58:18,067
I'll come with you.

1113
00:58:21,861 --> 00:58:23,632
"Grace Joe Solo Concert"

1114
00:58:26,250 --> 00:58:27,968
What? What is wrong with this door?

1115
00:58:27,992 --> 00:58:30,025
The door won't open!

1116
00:58:30,194 --> 00:58:32,526
What are you talking about? Move.

1117
00:58:33,701 --> 00:58:36,609
What? It's locked. What's going on?

1118
00:58:38,362 --> 00:58:39,879
"Grace Joe Solo Concert"

1119
00:58:41,367 --> 00:58:43,526
Why would it be locked?

1120
00:58:44,033 --> 00:58:45,218
Darn it.

1121
00:58:45,242 --> 00:58:46,844
- Hey!
- Oh, no.

1122
00:58:46,868 --> 00:58:48,135
- What's going on?
- Open the door!

1123
00:58:48,159 --> 00:58:50,817
Everyone, please be seated.

1124
00:58:51,242 --> 00:58:53,442
- What was that?
- What? Who was that?

1125
00:58:53,534 --> 00:58:55,692
- Guys.
- Who are you?

1126
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:58,526
Who is pulling this prank on us?

1127
00:58:58,742 --> 00:59:00,885
Calm down, all of you.

1128
00:59:00,909 --> 00:59:03,650
The show will begin shortly.

1129
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:07,817
- Where is this guy?
- Shut it and open up!

1130
00:59:07,945 --> 00:59:11,288
"No Open Flames"

1131
00:59:14,367 --> 00:59:16,025
Gosh.

1132
00:59:19,992 --> 00:59:22,650
Look, Chairman Joo.

1133
00:59:22,742 --> 00:59:24,609
Dr. Ha!

1134
00:59:24,784 --> 00:59:27,260
Attorney Lee. Attorney Lee!

1135
00:59:27,284 --> 00:59:28,677
- Gosh, my head...
- Ms. Cheon!

1136
00:59:28,701 --> 00:59:30,426
- My gosh.
- Wake up.

1137
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:32,051
- My head...
- My head is killing me.

1138
00:59:32,075 --> 00:59:35,635
Sang A. Sang A! Wake up.

1139
00:59:35,659 --> 00:59:37,009
Wake up already!

1140
00:59:37,033 --> 00:59:38,260
- What's going on?
- Where are we?

1141
00:59:38,284 --> 00:59:39,844
- Where are we?
- Gosh.

1142
00:59:39,868 --> 00:59:41,218
My head hurts.

1143
00:59:41,242 --> 00:59:42,844
- What is this place?
- Darn it.

1144
00:59:42,868 --> 00:59:45,176
- What is this place?
- Gosh...

1145
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,984
What's going on?

1146
00:59:47,533 --> 00:59:48,634
What is that?

1147
00:59:48,659 --> 00:59:49,760
- Look!
- What is it?

1148
00:59:49,784 --> 00:59:51,677
Look, I see fire...

1149
00:59:51,701 --> 00:59:53,109
What is that?

1150
00:59:58,492 --> 01:00:00,317
What just happened?

1151
01:00:02,325 --> 01:00:03,968
- What was that?
- What?

1152
01:00:03,992 --> 01:00:04,977
Gosh.

1153
01:00:09,909 --> 01:00:12,067
What is that?

1154
01:00:13,909 --> 01:00:15,426
Mum?

1155
01:00:15,450 --> 01:00:17,733
Mum, no...

1156
01:00:17,868 --> 01:00:19,568
Mum.

1157
01:00:19,992 --> 01:00:22,412
- Mum!
- No!

1158
01:00:22,826 --> 01:00:24,135
- Mum?
- Is that my mum?

1159
01:00:24,159 --> 01:00:26,650
- Mum!
- My gosh!

1160
01:00:27,992 --> 01:00:29,218
- Mum.
- Oh, no.

1161
01:00:29,242 --> 01:00:30,760
What the heck is that? Mum!

1162
01:00:30,784 --> 01:00:32,301
What's my mum doing there?

1163
01:00:32,325 --> 01:00:33,811
Mum! Mum...

1164
01:00:35,950 --> 01:00:37,677
- Mum!
- Mum!

1165
01:00:37,701 --> 01:00:39,009
What are you doing there?

1166
01:00:39,033 --> 01:00:40,968
- No!
- Gosh, what's going on?

1167
01:00:40,992 --> 01:00:42,926
- I have no idea.
- My goodness.

1168
01:00:42,950 --> 01:00:44,635
- Mum!
- What do we do?

1169
01:00:44,659 --> 01:00:46,885
Please let us out.

1170
01:00:46,909 --> 01:00:49,650
Your parents are with me.

1171
01:00:50,826 --> 01:00:52,885
They need to be punished.

1172
01:00:52,909 --> 01:00:55,718
- No, Mum...
- What is this nonsense?

1173
01:00:55,742 --> 01:00:57,385
Are you saying you kidnapped our parents?

1174
01:00:57,409 --> 01:00:58,926
Do you know who my dad is?

1175
01:00:58,950 --> 01:01:00,844
How dare you do this?

1176
01:01:00,868 --> 01:01:02,301
Show yourself at once!

1177
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:04,677
Anybody there?

1178
01:01:04,701 --> 01:01:06,135
We're locked in here!

1179
01:01:06,159 --> 01:01:08,844
- Please pick up.
- Help!

1180
01:01:08,868 --> 01:01:10,218
Why aren't you picking up?

1181
01:01:10,242 --> 01:01:12,009
- Mum...
- Mum!

1182
01:01:12,033 --> 01:01:15,650
- Mum.
- Mum!

1183
01:01:19,534 --> 01:01:21,817
Don't waste your energy.

1184
01:01:22,033 --> 01:01:25,317
No one will come to your rescue.

1185
01:01:25,450 --> 01:01:27,192
This voice...

1186
01:01:28,409 --> 01:01:30,067
Look.

1187
01:01:30,159 --> 01:01:31,695
It's that place.

1188
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:33,545
What place?

1189
01:01:38,117 --> 01:01:39,900
Min Seol A?

1190
01:01:40,742 --> 01:01:42,568
No way.

1191
01:01:42,659 --> 01:01:45,552
What are our parents doing there?

1192
01:01:45,576 --> 01:01:48,093
- Mum!
- Mum, no!

1193
01:01:48,117 --> 01:01:50,093
- Mum!
- Dad!

1194
01:01:50,117 --> 01:01:51,677
- No!
- Mum!

1195
01:01:51,701 --> 01:01:53,844
Please forgive us.

1196
01:01:53,868 --> 01:01:54,926
- No!
- Stop!

1197
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:57,150
- No...
- Don't hurt them.

1198
01:02:03,284 --> 01:02:04,677
- No!
- What is happening?

1199
01:02:04,701 --> 01:02:05,802
- No!
- Darn it!

1200
01:02:05,826 --> 01:02:07,051
- My gosh!
- Stop!

1201
01:02:07,075 --> 01:02:08,677
- Gosh.
- This is insane!

1202
01:02:08,701 --> 01:02:10,343
What is this? Is this gasoline?

1203
01:02:10,367 --> 01:02:11,552
- What?
- Gasoline? Darn it!

1204
01:02:11,576 --> 01:02:13,650
- Gosh.
- My goodness.

1205
01:02:14,492 --> 01:02:17,051
What is it? What's wrong?

1206
01:02:17,075 --> 01:02:19,609
There's a bomb!

1207
01:02:19,826 --> 01:02:20,968
- No!
- My gosh!

1208
01:02:20,992 --> 01:02:22,677
The bomb will go off!

1209
01:02:22,701 --> 01:02:24,093
- Stop!
- It'll blow up!

1210
01:02:24,117 --> 01:02:25,677
- Don't move.
- The door won't open!

1211
01:02:25,701 --> 01:02:27,176
- This is...
- This is the only way out.

1212
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,926
- What?
- What's going on?

1213
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:31,343
- Help!
- Anybody there?

1214
01:02:31,367 --> 01:02:33,343
- Help!
- Get us out of here!

1215
01:02:33,367 --> 01:02:34,426
My phone doesn't work.

1216
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:36,802
I'm not even getting any signal!

1217
01:02:36,826 --> 01:02:39,234
Do something!

1218
01:02:41,950 --> 01:02:43,968
What? A fire!

1219
01:02:43,992 --> 01:02:45,885
Wait!

1220
01:02:45,909 --> 01:02:47,051
I see someone over there!

1221
01:02:47,075 --> 01:02:49,150
- What?
- What did you say?

1222
01:02:51,284 --> 01:02:52,885
- Where?
- Hey, over here!

1223
01:02:52,909 --> 01:02:54,385
- Hey!
- Where?

1224
01:02:54,409 --> 01:02:56,009
Please get us out of here.

1225
01:02:56,033 --> 01:02:57,718
- Please help us.
- Come on!

1226
01:02:57,742 --> 01:02:59,692
- Help!
- Hey!

1227
01:03:03,868 --> 01:03:07,067
Please get us out of here!

1228
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:09,343
- Mum!
- No, Mum...

1229
01:03:09,367 --> 01:03:11,552
- Mum!
- No!

1230
01:03:11,576 --> 01:03:13,635
What the heck is going on?

1231
01:03:13,659 --> 01:03:14,844
Your parents are paying

1232
01:03:14,868 --> 01:03:17,385
for what you guys did in the past.

1233
01:03:17,409 --> 01:03:19,067
What's wrong with that?

1234
01:03:21,325 --> 01:03:23,192
Your parents

1235
01:03:23,242 --> 01:03:25,817
will die instead of you.

1236
01:03:26,534 --> 01:03:28,552
No, no. Mum!

1237
01:03:28,576 --> 01:03:29,968
- No!
- No!

1238
01:03:29,992 --> 01:03:31,468
No!

1239
01:03:31,492 --> 01:03:33,635
Mum!

1240
01:03:33,659 --> 01:03:36,900
No, please... Mum!

1241
01:03:37,826 --> 01:03:41,109
Mum, no. Mum...

1242
01:03:54,476 --> 01:03:55,760
That idiot.

1243
01:03:55,784 --> 01:03:57,650
I think the car's on fire.

1244
01:03:58,492 --> 01:04:00,141
Fire?

1245
01:04:00,950 --> 01:04:03,468
Hey, I broke the door earlier.

1246
01:04:03,492 --> 01:04:05,718
Help! Open the door. Open this!

1247
01:04:05,742 --> 01:04:07,343
Hey, let me out!

1248
01:04:07,367 --> 01:04:08,510
- Let's just leave.
- Let me out!

1249
01:04:08,534 --> 01:04:09,844
What about her?

1250
01:04:09,868 --> 01:04:11,081
- Whatever.
- Don't leave!

1251
01:04:11,106 --> 01:04:12,885
- Don't go!
- She'll get out somehow.

1252
01:04:12,909 --> 01:04:13,926
- Let me out!
- Let's go.

1253
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:15,802
- Gosh.
- What if the car explodes?

1254
01:04:15,826 --> 01:04:16,802
Gosh.

1255
01:04:16,826 --> 01:04:18,176
Darn it. Whatever, let's go.

1256
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:19,972
Don't go!

1257
01:04:52,617 --> 01:04:54,650
Mum!

1258
01:04:59,266 --> 01:05:01,008
Why did I

1259
01:05:01,033 --> 01:05:03,484
call out for Mum at that very moment?

1260
01:05:03,701 --> 01:05:05,712
If I had a mum,

1261
01:05:06,321 --> 01:05:09,104
maybe none of that would've happened.

1262
01:05:12,519 --> 01:05:14,098
What the heck are you doing?

1263
01:05:14,123 --> 01:05:15,301
There are people here!

1264
01:05:15,325 --> 01:05:16,635
Stop this madness now!

1265
01:05:16,659 --> 01:05:20,067
Hey, why start a fire? Are you insane?

1266
01:05:20,659 --> 01:05:21,631
Why?

1267
01:05:22,242 --> 01:05:23,552
Are you afraid you might die?

1268
01:05:23,576 --> 01:05:25,051
What?

1269
01:05:25,075 --> 01:05:27,568
But you think what your kids did is okay?

1270
01:05:28,242 --> 01:05:29,926
They also set the car on fire

1271
01:05:29,950 --> 01:05:31,659
and ran away.

1272
01:05:32,145 --> 01:05:34,185
What on earth are you talking about?

1273
01:05:34,210 --> 01:05:36,244
Explain what's going on!

1274
01:05:39,559 --> 01:05:40,718
- Min Seol A!
- What?

1275
01:05:40,742 --> 01:05:41,968
What are you talking about?

1276
01:05:41,992 --> 01:05:43,468
What about her?

1277
01:05:43,492 --> 01:05:45,009
That night...

1278
01:05:45,033 --> 01:05:47,885
A fire broke out inside the van.

1279
01:05:47,909 --> 01:05:49,900
A fire? What are you talking about?

1280
01:05:50,325 --> 01:05:54,109
Our kids lighted candles on the cake,

1281
01:05:55,367 --> 01:05:58,109
and Min Seol A was almost burned to death.

1282
01:06:36,992 --> 01:06:40,050
=Penthouse=

1283
01:06:40,075 --> 01:06:41,677
Kidnapping, confinement, and blackmailing!

1284
01:06:41,701 --> 01:06:43,135
Min Seol A is my daughter!

1285
01:06:43,159 --> 01:06:44,844
Enjoy the madness.

1286
01:06:44,868 --> 01:06:45,926
Do you like her?

1287
01:06:45,950 --> 01:06:47,009
I know how hard it's been for you.

1288
01:06:47,033 --> 01:06:49,135
Don't think it'll end here.

1289
01:06:49,159 --> 01:06:50,051
The one who pushed Seol A

1290
01:06:50,075 --> 01:06:50,968
off the building.

1291
01:06:50,992 --> 01:06:52,844
I thought you were my friend.

1292
01:06:52,868 --> 01:06:54,510
Just kill her!

1293
01:06:54,534 --> 01:06:56,176
I'll do it at the very end,

1294
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:58,568
as painfully as possible.
