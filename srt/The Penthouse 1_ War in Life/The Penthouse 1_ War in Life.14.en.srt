How...

37
00:02:26,018 --> 00:02:29,118
Who pulled this absurd prank on us?

38
00:02:29,142 --> 00:02:30,451
Who did this?

00:02:34,809 --> 00:02:36,925
What kind of a jerk did this?

42
00:02:39,934 --> 00:02:42,009
That's Seol A's sneaker.

43
00:02:42,809 --> 00:02:44,509
Who could have done this?

44
00:02:45,809 --> 00:02:46,785
People at Hera Palace

45
00:02:46,809 --> 00:02:48,076
are trying to kill me.

46
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,660
I'm so scared.

47
00:02:49,684 --> 00:02:51,118

Someone pushed Min Seol A off

51
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:05,509
from the 47th floor.

52
00:03:14,059 --> 00:03:15,410
Soo Ryeon.

53
00:03:15,434 --> 00:03:16,785
Are you okay?

54
00:03:16,809 --> 00:03:18,201
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:18,225 --> 00:03:20,243
Someone must have pulled an awful prank.

56
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:22,410
I'm afraid we'll have to end the party.

57
00:03:22,434 --> 00:03:24,243
I'll contact you later.

58
00:03:24,267 --> 00:03:26,743
I'm very disappointed in you, Mr Joo.

59
00:03:26,767 --> 00:03:29,759
I was expecting something a little more...

60
00:03:29,934 --> 00:03:31,676
spectacular.

61
00:03:34,892 --> 00:03:36,201
Excuse me.

Where are you right now?

72
00:04:08,912 --> 00:04:10,945
Why are you taking things this far?

73
00:04:12,183 --> 00:04:14,493
Because your husband killed Seol A.

74
00:04:14,517 --> 00:04:16,076
Now, it's your turn.

75
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,118
Tell everyone that

76
00:04:17,142 --> 00:04:18,702
the dead Seol A is your daughter.

77
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:20,467
Right now.

78
00:04:27,695 --> 00:04:29,367
I'll give you a minute.

79
00:04:29,392 --> 00:04:30,843
Hurry up and tell them.

80
00:04:30,868 --> 00:04:32,734
Tell them now!

"Cam 02, Play"

Fifty seconds.

83
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:46,177
Forty seconds.

84
00:04:52,518 --> 00:04:54,176
Twenty seconds.

85
00:04:59,892 --> 00:05:01,759
It was you.

86
00:05:02,225 --> 00:05:04,535
The one who planned everything

87
00:05:04,559 --> 00:05:06,702
was you, Soo Ryeon.

88
00:05:06,726 --> 00:05:08,410
It was you from the very beginning.

89
00:05:08,434 --> 00:05:10,326
Everything from the very start!

90
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,618
Ms Cheon.

91
00:05:11,642 --> 00:05:13,451
What do you mean?

92
00:05:13,475 --> 00:05:15,368
Why would Soo Ryeon do this?

93
00:05:15,392 --> 00:05:18,410
Seo Jin, that's a bit of a stretch.

94
00:05:18,434 --> 00:05:20,410
She doesn't know anything.

95
00:05:20,434 --> 00:05:21,743
No.

96
00:05:21,767 --> 00:05:24,243
It has to be you, Sim Soo Ryeon.

97
00:05:24,267 --> 00:05:25,743
Who else would tell all of us to come

98
00:05:25,767 --> 00:05:28,342
and put on this huge show?

99
00:05:28,517 --> 00:05:29,868
You're the only one.

100
00:05:29,892 --> 00:05:32,410
So why would she do this?

101
00:05:32,434 --> 00:05:35,326
You can't blame an innocent person.

102
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,076
I have evidence.

103
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,159
I have solid evidence that she has been

104
00:05:39,183 --> 00:05:41,050
threatening us.

105
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:44,551
I have no idea

106
00:05:44,934 --> 00:05:47,925
what you're talking about, Seo Jin.

107
00:05:49,018 --> 00:05:50,535
I wonder

108
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:53,134
how long you can play the innocent.

109
00:05:56,058 --> 00:05:58,189
"Cam 02, Play"

110
00:06:05,726 --> 00:06:07,326
I brought this painting

111
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:10,467
from your office this morning.

112
00:06:10,559 --> 00:06:11,910
You fooled me once,

113
00:06:11,934 --> 00:06:14,592
but you didn't think I would return.

114
00:06:20,892 --> 00:06:22,368
I was wondering where I've seen

115
00:06:22,392 --> 00:06:23,910
this apple necklace.

116
00:06:23,934 --> 00:06:25,660
This was Min Seol A.

117
00:06:25,684 --> 00:06:27,702
Why did you paint her of all people?

118
00:06:27,726 --> 00:06:29,076
If she has nothing to do with you,

119
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,426
there's no reason for you to draw her, no?

120
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,243
Wait, that...

121
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:35,076
This... This thing...

122
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,759
My gosh!

123
00:06:37,225 --> 00:06:38,618
This eye. This thing.

124
00:06:38,642 --> 00:06:39,827
He's right.

125
00:06:39,851 --> 00:06:41,952
It's Min Seol A!

126
00:06:41,976 --> 00:06:44,952
Did you really paint this?

127
00:06:44,976 --> 00:06:46,618
There's no reason for you to do that.

128
00:06:46,642 --> 00:06:49,576
You exposed our kids' voice recording

129
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,994
and sent us threatening letters

130
00:06:51,018 --> 00:06:52,535
to pressure us.

131
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:54,676
It was all you. But why?

132
00:06:54,934 --> 00:06:56,035
Why did you do that?

133
00:06:56,059 --> 00:06:57,368
Is this girl

134
00:06:57,392 --> 00:06:59,217
really Min Seol A?

135
00:06:59,684 --> 00:07:01,159
Did you paint this?

136
00:07:01,183 --> 00:07:03,159
Why did you do this? Answer me!

137
00:07:03,183 --> 00:07:05,009
Because Min Seol A is...

138
00:07:08,183 --> 00:07:10,134
Sim Soo Ryeon's daughter.

139
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:15,451
What kind of nonsense is that?

140
00:07:15,475 --> 00:07:17,118
If it's not true,

141
00:07:17,142 --> 00:07:19,050
tell everyone yourself.

142
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,925
Yes, she's right.

143
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:31,952
I painted this.

144
00:07:31,976 --> 00:07:33,910
So it was you?

145
00:07:33,934 --> 00:07:35,994
Why did you do this? Why?

146
00:07:36,018 --> 00:07:37,800
I saw it.

147
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,967
I saw Min Seol A

148
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:41,759
fall down

149
00:07:42,059 --> 00:07:44,800
from Hera Palace that night.

150
00:07:49,767 --> 00:07:52,676
I've had nightmares ever since that night.

151
00:07:52,934 --> 00:07:54,368
Min Seol A didn't kill herself.

152
00:07:54,392 --> 00:07:57,050
Someone pushed her off.

153
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,285
I couldn't see the person's face,

154
00:07:59,309 --> 00:08:00,576
but I clearly saw the hands

155
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,217
that pushed her...

156
00:08:03,726 --> 00:08:05,368
as she struggled.

157
00:08:05,392 --> 00:08:06,827
Min Seol A

158
00:08:06,851 --> 00:08:08,243
didn't kill herself,

159
00:08:08,267 --> 00:08:10,269
but she was murdered?

160
00:08:10,294 --> 00:08:11,618
I can't believe this.

161
00:08:11,642 --> 00:08:14,576
What have we done?

162
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,576
Did we take part

163
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,300
in a murder case?

164
00:08:19,559 --> 00:08:23,243
Why haven't you said anything until now?

165
00:08:23,267 --> 00:08:25,882
You witnessed someone getting killed!

166
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:33,259
Because I thought my husband...

167
00:08:34,892 --> 00:08:36,551
and Seo Jin

168
00:08:36,642 --> 00:08:38,842
were the culprits.

169
00:08:41,517 --> 00:08:43,259
What do you mean?

170
00:08:43,767 --> 00:08:46,925
Seo Jin and my husband are in an affair.

171
00:08:50,475 --> 00:08:52,509
Min Seol A knew everything

172
00:08:53,183 --> 00:08:55,092
and had been threatening them.

173
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,800
So she knew.

174
00:09:00,225 --> 00:09:01,910
An affair?

175
00:09:01,934 --> 00:09:04,509
Ms Cheon and Chairman Joo?

176
00:09:04,726 --> 00:09:06,035
Ms Cheon, that's not true, is it?

177
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:07,201
Chairman Joo,

178
00:09:07,225 --> 00:09:10,217
she got something wrong, didn't she?

179
00:09:10,976 --> 00:09:12,451
I already have evidence that

180
00:09:12,475 --> 00:09:14,521
you two have been seeing each other

181
00:09:15,018 --> 00:09:16,718
at the villa in Yangpyeong.

182
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,092
Ms Cheon.

183
00:09:22,517 --> 00:09:24,967
Min Seol A got something on you,

184
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,118
so you locked her in the mechanical room.

185
00:09:27,142 --> 00:09:29,384
I heard everything you two said.

186
00:09:29,475 --> 00:09:31,326
So I got scared

187
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,300
thinking you two could have...

188
00:09:35,267 --> 00:09:36,910
killed Min Seol A.

189
00:09:36,934 --> 00:09:39,426
It wasn't me. Why would I do that?

190
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,467
Then did you push her, Seo Jin?

191
00:09:45,225 --> 00:09:46,660
Did you kill her

192
00:09:46,684 --> 00:09:48,676
because she knew about your affair?

193
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,467
You tell us yourself.

194
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:54,009
If you didn't,

195
00:09:54,183 --> 00:09:55,076
tell us that you didn't.

196
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,493
Stop this show. I won't fall for this.

197
00:09:57,517 --> 00:10:00,384
Tell us about your relationship with her!

198
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:04,009
I wanted to keep my family together.

199
00:10:06,851 --> 00:10:08,076
And I've been warning you

200
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,009
in my own way until this day.

201
00:10:10,892 --> 00:10:12,410
That's why

202
00:10:12,434 --> 00:10:15,217
I was wearing that scarf on purpose.

203
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:19,800
But it all came down to this.

204
00:10:21,892 --> 00:10:22,910
I hoped

205
00:10:22,934 --> 00:10:25,259
you'd understand my warning and stop.

206
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,925
I saw

207
00:10:33,434 --> 00:10:35,426
the hands that pushed her.

208
00:10:36,018 --> 00:10:38,551
The red ruby ring.

209
00:10:39,309 --> 00:10:41,676
But I won't share that.

210
00:10:53,142 --> 00:10:54,925
Should I disclose it?

211
00:10:55,142 --> 00:10:56,759
No.

212
00:10:57,142 --> 00:10:58,759
Stop everything.

213
00:11:01,309 --> 00:11:02,967
Sim Soo Ryeon.

214
00:11:04,059 --> 00:11:05,925
You knew everything?

215
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:22,592
You look awful, Ro Na.

216
00:11:23,434 --> 00:11:26,467
Seok Hoon should see you like this.

217
00:11:30,892 --> 00:11:32,967
What do you think you're doing?

218
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:34,660
I won't let any of you

219
00:11:34,684 --> 00:11:36,410
get away with this.

220
00:11:36,434 --> 00:11:38,118
I guess you pretended like

221
00:11:38,142 --> 00:11:40,451
you're Min Seol A with such boldness.

222
00:11:40,475 --> 00:11:43,134
Is this how you bullied her?

223
00:11:43,225 --> 00:11:45,384
Is that why she died?

224
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,702
I hate you and your mum to death.

225
00:11:50,726 --> 00:11:54,118
I hate you lurking around Seok Hoon,

226
00:11:54,142 --> 00:11:55,326
and your shameless mum

227
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,827
who approached my dad

228
00:11:56,851 --> 00:11:59,509
just because she's his first love.

229
00:11:59,934 --> 00:12:00,910
What?

230
00:12:00,934 --> 00:12:02,368
You didn't know?

231
00:12:02,392 --> 00:12:05,410
Your mum has been hitting on my dad.

232
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:07,118
My parents got into a fight over your mum

233
00:12:07,142 --> 00:12:08,660
and my dad moved out!

234
00:12:08,684 --> 00:12:10,118
Quit your nonsense.

235
00:12:10,142 --> 00:12:12,243
My mum would never do that!

236
00:12:12,267 --> 00:12:15,009
You're as brazen as your mum.

237
00:12:15,142 --> 00:12:17,952
Our family was ruined because of her.

238
00:12:17,976 --> 00:12:20,467
They might end up getting divorced.

239
00:12:22,267 --> 00:12:23,326
Do you know that my dad

240
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,201
recently spent the night at your house?

241
00:12:25,225 --> 00:12:26,493
Stop lying.

242
00:12:26,517 --> 00:12:28,800
Do you think I'll let you fool me?

243
00:12:36,892 --> 00:12:38,868
Was someone here last night?

244
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:40,243
What?

245
00:12:40,267 --> 00:12:41,952
Oh, I couldn't sleep,

246
00:12:41,976 --> 00:12:43,576
so I grabbed a drink by myself.

247
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,634
I like to drink alone, you know.

248
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:49,800
This is nonsense.

249
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:51,994
No.

250
00:12:52,018 --> 00:12:53,451
If you don't believe me,

251
00:12:53,475 --> 00:12:54,785
check for yourself

252
00:12:54,809 --> 00:12:57,426
and see if it's true or not.

253
00:12:59,434 --> 00:13:02,118
You'd better listen to me from now on.

254
00:13:02,142 --> 00:13:03,952
If you don't, I'll tell the world

255
00:13:03,976 --> 00:13:07,035
about everything your mum did.

256
00:13:07,059 --> 00:13:08,660
When that happens,

257
00:13:08,684 --> 00:13:11,618
that will be the end

258
00:13:11,642 --> 00:13:14,551
of you and your mum's life.

259
00:13:14,767 --> 00:13:16,326
Ro Na!

260
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,009
Bae Ro Na!

261
00:13:18,142 --> 00:13:21,092
Don't tell anyone about today.

262
00:13:27,392 --> 00:13:29,009
Ro Na.

263
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,967
Ro Na, are you okay?

264
00:13:35,809 --> 00:13:37,159
Are you all right?

265
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:38,800
Move.

266
00:13:39,475 --> 00:13:41,118
Didn't you just hear me?

267
00:13:41,142 --> 00:13:43,092
Quit your show.

268
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,217
Ha Eun Byeol.

269
00:14:13,475 --> 00:14:15,285
It had better not be a lie.

270
00:14:15,309 --> 00:14:17,467
If it is, I won't let you live.

271
00:14:19,934 --> 00:14:21,493
They were having an affair

272
00:14:21,517 --> 00:14:22,868
right before my eyes,

273
00:14:22,892 --> 00:14:25,368
and I had no idea?

274
00:14:25,392 --> 00:14:28,035
I mean, it's me. Kang Ma Ri!

275
00:14:28,059 --> 00:14:30,827
She doesn't deserve to be an educator!

276
00:14:30,851 --> 00:14:32,201
What will our innocent kids

277
00:14:32,225 --> 00:14:34,076
ever learn from her?

278
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,660
How can she lure a married man?

279
00:14:36,684 --> 00:14:37,702
On top of that,

280
00:14:37,726 --> 00:14:39,509
she could have murdered...

281
00:14:40,767 --> 00:14:42,868
Did she really push Min Seol A off

282
00:14:42,892 --> 00:14:44,827
to keep her affair secret?

283
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:46,952
That's just too wicked!

284
00:14:46,976 --> 00:14:50,243
There's no murderer who isn't wicked!

285
00:14:50,267 --> 00:14:53,285
Darn it, we took the blame for no reason.

286
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,535
I mean,

287
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:57,326
those two came up with a plan, killed her,

288
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,618
then got us involved in the case

289
00:14:58,642 --> 00:15:00,910
and made us dump her dead body!

290
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:02,326
Darn it.

291
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,285
Honey.

292
00:15:04,309 --> 00:15:05,368
Honey.

293
00:15:05,392 --> 00:15:06,994
It's late, but should we report them?

294
00:15:07,018 --> 00:15:10,201
We really thought she killed herself.

295
00:15:10,225 --> 00:15:11,743
You know,

296
00:15:11,767 --> 00:15:14,201
we may be able to get our case extenuated.

297
00:15:14,225 --> 00:15:15,842
Goodness.

298
00:15:15,976 --> 00:15:17,243
Don't be so naive.

299
00:15:17,267 --> 00:15:19,702
We got our hands and feet tied up.

300
00:15:19,726 --> 00:15:21,285
The moment we threw her body away,

301
00:15:21,309 --> 00:15:23,201
we all got on the same boat,

302
00:15:23,225 --> 00:15:25,743
and we all win or lose as a team.

303
00:15:25,767 --> 00:15:28,175
We're accomplices! Don't you get it?

304
00:15:28,434 --> 00:15:29,493
Accomplices?

305
00:15:29,517 --> 00:15:31,201
We aren't their accomplices.

306
00:15:31,225 --> 00:15:32,451
We got fooled by them

307
00:15:32,475 --> 00:15:34,426
because we were too naive.

308
00:15:36,142 --> 00:15:37,410
Are you going to just sit there?

309
00:15:37,434 --> 00:15:38,827
Are we going to sit on our hands

310
00:15:38,851 --> 00:15:40,925
and let Ms Cheon do this to us?

311
00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:44,342
Then what do you suggest?

312
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:52,467
Since when did you know?

313
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:55,342
It has been a few months.

314
00:15:55,851 --> 00:15:58,259
I'm sure you knew that I knew.

315
00:15:59,183 --> 00:16:01,118
I'm sure you knew

316
00:16:01,142 --> 00:16:02,368
I got a private detective

317
00:16:02,392 --> 00:16:04,092
to keep an eye on you.

318
00:16:04,726 --> 00:16:06,925
Why didn't you say anything to me?

319
00:16:07,684 --> 00:16:10,217
I thought you'd be done with her soon.

320
00:16:11,934 --> 00:16:13,842
That you were shaken for a moment.

321
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,925
I waited

322
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:20,426
for you to return to the family.

323
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,285
Even so, how can you tell everyone?

324
00:16:22,309 --> 00:16:24,009
What are you going to do now?

325
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,159
We'll get divorced.

326
00:16:27,183 --> 00:16:28,800
No.

327
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,618
That's not an option.

328
00:16:31,642 --> 00:16:33,842
Isn't that what you wanted?

329
00:16:36,309 --> 00:16:39,410
Everyone in Hera Club knows.

330
00:16:39,434 --> 00:16:41,159
We can't live together anymore.

331
00:16:41,183 --> 00:16:43,076
Nothing has changed.

332
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,118
You're the only one for me.

333
00:16:44,142 --> 00:16:45,800
I already know...

334
00:16:46,976 --> 00:16:48,910
your relationship is more serious

335
00:16:48,934 --> 00:16:50,634
than it looks.

336
00:16:51,225 --> 00:16:52,493
You won't change my mind.

337
00:16:52,517 --> 00:16:54,076
Do you think getting a divorce is easy?

338
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,050
What about Seok Hoon and Seok Kyung?

339
00:16:56,642 --> 00:16:57,952
Give me some time.

340
00:16:57,976 --> 00:16:59,676
I'll take care of this.

341
00:17:10,475 --> 00:17:12,592
I want to check something with you.

342
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,300
Are you sure

343
00:17:15,976 --> 00:17:17,592
you didn't do this today?

344
00:17:20,892 --> 00:17:23,718
Have you not been blackmailing us?

345
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:25,076
Did you not put up the drawing of an eye

346
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,718
on the fountain?

347
00:17:27,018 --> 00:17:28,883
Are you sure it wasn't you?

348
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:35,493
If anyone did that,

349
00:17:35,517 --> 00:17:37,035
that means you killed her.

350
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:38,994
What are you talking about? It wasn't me.

351
00:17:39,018 --> 00:17:41,050
What if I say I can't believe you?

352
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,368
Why would I risk my life

353
00:17:42,392 --> 00:17:44,175
over a kid like her?

354
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,618
I'm at the villa waiting for you.

355
00:17:52,642 --> 00:17:54,076
I need to see you now.

356
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,159
I can't see you tonight.

357
00:17:55,183 --> 00:17:56,118
I'll see you next time.

358
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:58,285
"Yangjae Flower Market"

359
00:17:58,309 --> 00:17:59,201
Do you want me

360
00:17:59,225 --> 00:18:01,009
to storm into the penthouse?

361
00:18:12,267 --> 00:18:14,800
You can stay in the study for a while.

362
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,883
I can't share the same bed with you.

363
00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:21,467
Trust me,

364
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:23,243
don't get any weird ideas,

365
00:18:23,267 --> 00:18:24,883
and please wait.

366
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:41,868
It's me.

367
00:18:41,892 --> 00:18:43,883
How is she now?

368
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,259
I'll be there right now.

369
00:18:57,892 --> 00:18:59,493
I said I'll see you next time.

370
00:18:59,517 --> 00:19:01,076
Stop acting like a kid.

371
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,910
How can you say that to me?

372
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:04,076
Your wife

373
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,426
humiliated me in front of everyone.

374
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:08,660
How can I be in right mind right now?

375
00:19:08,684 --> 00:19:10,243
You provoked her first.

376
00:19:10,267 --> 00:19:12,118
You insisted that she threatened us

377
00:19:12,142 --> 00:19:13,118
and claimed nonsense

378
00:19:13,142 --> 00:19:14,285
that she's Min Seol A's mum.

379
00:19:14,309 --> 00:19:16,076
Do you trust what she said?

380
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,285
Sim Soo Ryeon is a frightening woman!

381
00:19:18,309 --> 00:19:19,243
She knew about us,

382
00:19:19,267 --> 00:19:20,159
but stayed quiet to this day.

383
00:19:20,183 --> 00:19:22,368
She has put on an act until now!

384
00:19:22,392 --> 00:19:24,050
Do you really think

385
00:19:24,475 --> 00:19:25,493
someone like her will admit

386
00:19:25,517 --> 00:19:27,076
that she has been threatening us?

387
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,035
I already looked into this too.

388
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:29,994
I put someone on her tail

389
00:19:30,018 --> 00:19:31,410
and have been checking her whereabouts.

390
00:19:31,434 --> 00:19:32,827
Don't you think she probably knows

391
00:19:32,851 --> 00:19:34,118
that you put a tail on her?

392
00:19:34,142 --> 00:19:35,285
Enough!

393
00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:37,342
You're tiring and driving me crazy!

394
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:45,259
What's going on with Oh Yoon Hee?

395
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:48,576
Why did you let her work at your company?

396
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,118
I already told you.

397
00:19:50,142 --> 00:19:52,676
She's temporarily hired because of Logan.

398
00:19:52,851 --> 00:19:55,702
A girl like her wouldn't do much for you.

399
00:19:55,726 --> 00:19:56,994
All she ever did was show people houses

400
00:19:57,018 --> 00:19:58,660
without a licence as an estate agent.

401
00:19:58,684 --> 00:19:59,785
Fire her immediately.

402
00:19:59,809 --> 00:20:01,410
If you need anything, I'll help you.

403
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:03,702
Why are you so emotional?

404
00:20:03,726 --> 00:20:05,634
At the party and even now.

405
00:20:06,767 --> 00:20:08,535
Now that everyone knows,

406
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:09,785
shouldn't we be more careful

407
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:11,342
for each other's sake?

408
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,743
Why are you so unreasonable

409
00:20:12,767 --> 00:20:14,467
as if you have nothing to lose?

410
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:18,759
I have lost

411
00:20:19,309 --> 00:20:21,718
the most important thing to me.

412
00:20:22,018 --> 00:20:23,634
My pride.

413
00:20:24,434 --> 00:20:25,827
I was completely humiliated

414
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:27,883
before everyone at Hera Club.

415
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,910
The pride I've kept up to this day

416
00:20:29,934 --> 00:20:31,076
all crumbled down at once.

417
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,718
Does that mean nothing?

418
00:20:36,183 --> 00:20:38,134
Other than my father,

419
00:20:38,392 --> 00:20:40,243
I have never bowed my head to anyone.

420
00:20:40,267 --> 00:20:41,925
And now,

421
00:20:42,267 --> 00:20:44,718
those people have something on me.

422
00:20:49,309 --> 00:20:51,509
If you leave me...

423
00:20:54,018 --> 00:20:55,759
I'll go crazy.

424
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,384
Don't get worked up.

425
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,842
You know that I love you, don't you?

426
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:09,800
I'll make sure no one messes with you.

427
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,384
It's me, Joo Dan Tae.

428
00:21:13,892 --> 00:21:15,660
You need to divorce Soo Ryeon.

429
00:21:15,684 --> 00:21:17,952
I'm not asking you to be with me now.

430
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:19,493
But it's horrible to think

431
00:21:19,517 --> 00:21:21,718
you sleep and eat with her.

432
00:21:22,142 --> 00:21:23,800
Give me some time.

433
00:21:24,934 --> 00:21:27,842
There's one last thing I need from her.

434
00:21:29,392 --> 00:21:31,050
What is it?

435
00:21:31,851 --> 00:21:33,509
Later.

436
00:21:38,517 --> 00:21:40,384
Anyway, are you sure

437
00:21:41,392 --> 00:21:42,451
nothing happened

438
00:21:42,475 --> 00:21:44,175
between you and Min Seol A?

439
00:21:51,767 --> 00:21:53,634
What about you?

440
00:22:08,183 --> 00:22:10,800
My name...

441
00:22:11,976 --> 00:22:13,800
is

442
00:22:14,309 --> 00:22:16,509
Joo

443
00:22:17,726 --> 00:22:20,551
Hye In.

444
00:22:20,934 --> 00:22:22,743
Hye In, great job.

445
00:22:22,767 --> 00:22:24,201
You've done so well.

446
00:22:24,225 --> 00:22:26,384
That hurts.

447
00:22:28,434 --> 00:22:29,827
I'm sorry.

448
00:22:29,851 --> 00:22:31,800
I got too excited.

449
00:22:33,183 --> 00:22:35,967
I can't believe you can say your name now.

450
00:22:38,142 --> 00:22:40,800
I never imagined I'd see a day like this.

451
00:22:42,267 --> 00:22:44,551
Mum.

452
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:47,967
Don't cry.

453
00:22:51,475 --> 00:22:53,175
I won't.

454
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:55,551
I'll listen to what you say, Hye In.

455
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,312
"Ha Yoon Chul"

456
00:23:45,337 --> 00:23:46,719
"Do you want to grab a cup of coffee?"

457
00:23:46,744 --> 00:23:48,138
"I'm sorry you had to see that"

458
00:23:48,163 --> 00:23:49,535
Yoon Hee.

459
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:51,535
Is this really the right way to live?

460
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:54,592
Should I just get a divorce?

461
00:23:56,642 --> 00:23:58,300
Mum, how...

462
00:23:58,642 --> 00:24:00,384
How can you do this?

463
00:24:27,309 --> 00:24:28,285
It looks like

464
00:24:28,309 --> 00:24:30,326
you finally believe what I told you.

465
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:32,718
Are you ready to save your mum?

466
00:24:33,851 --> 00:24:35,384
Hey.

467
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,259
I found this in my mum's drawer.

468
00:24:50,225 --> 00:24:52,342
Stop it!

469
00:24:57,225 --> 00:24:59,368
Your dad is also responsible.

470
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,410
Go nit-pick over this with him

471
00:25:00,434 --> 00:25:01,618
if you want to argue with someone!

472
00:25:01,642 --> 00:25:02,743
Your mum is the one

473
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:05,217
who seduced a married man!

474
00:25:05,309 --> 00:25:07,201
My family had been

475
00:25:07,225 --> 00:25:10,076
perfectly happy until you moved here.

476
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,952
Your mum destroyed our family.

477
00:25:12,976 --> 00:25:14,827
Why should that only happen to us?

478
00:25:14,851 --> 00:25:17,467
Your mum needs to suffer too.

479
00:25:17,976 --> 00:25:20,175
Don't do anything to her!

480
00:25:21,392 --> 00:25:24,576
What should I do?

481
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,384
I'll do everything

482
00:25:26,642 --> 00:25:28,551
as you say.

483
00:25:29,309 --> 00:25:30,925
Please.

484
00:25:34,781 --> 00:25:37,907
"Resident Car Park"

485
00:25:38,517 --> 00:25:39,994
Secretary Cho.

486
00:25:40,018 --> 00:25:41,118
Get lost.

487
00:25:41,142 --> 00:25:43,493
I told you to get lost.

488
00:25:43,517 --> 00:25:46,759
I have a word to share with Chairman Joo.

489
00:25:56,475 --> 00:25:57,743
What is it?

490
00:25:57,767 --> 00:25:59,660
Did you find the one who put on

491
00:25:59,684 --> 00:26:00,868
the mannequin show?

492
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,243
I don't know who that was,

493
00:26:02,267 --> 00:26:03,618
but unless that person holds

494
00:26:03,642 --> 00:26:05,243
a huge grudge over Min Seol A's killer,

495
00:26:05,267 --> 00:26:06,451
why would anyone do that?

496
00:26:06,475 --> 00:26:07,368
I don't want to talk about

497
00:26:07,392 --> 00:26:09,118
something rough in the morning.

498
00:26:09,142 --> 00:26:10,576
I'm looking for the culprit right now,

499
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,660
so we'll catch this person soon.

500
00:26:11,684 --> 00:26:14,092
The one who killed Min Seol A was...

501
00:26:16,392 --> 00:26:17,743
you.

502
00:26:17,767 --> 00:26:19,426
It was you.

503
00:26:19,892 --> 00:26:21,592
Attorney Lee!

504
00:26:21,934 --> 00:26:23,660
A few months ago,

505
00:26:23,684 --> 00:26:25,426
Kyu Jin got

506
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,800
his hands on this.

507
00:26:28,018 --> 00:26:29,952
Min Seol A's phone.

508
00:26:29,976 --> 00:26:31,410
Where did you get this?

509
00:26:31,434 --> 00:26:33,634
Why haven't you said anything until now?

510
00:26:34,392 --> 00:26:36,576
I found an amazing movie in here,

511
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,827
starring Joo Dan Tae and Cheon Seo Jin.

512
00:26:38,851 --> 00:26:40,159
It's an adult film that's titled

513
00:26:40,183 --> 00:26:42,243
"The Ones Who Shouldn't Have Met."

514
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,410
I loved your work.

515
00:26:43,434 --> 00:26:46,159
Chairman Joo, you're one hard-working man.

516
00:26:46,183 --> 00:26:48,342
Do you eat something good for stamina?

517
00:26:50,517 --> 00:26:53,175
But you shouldn't play this hand now.

518
00:26:53,309 --> 00:26:55,883
Everyone knows about Seo Jin and me.

519
00:26:55,934 --> 00:26:58,300
You should've done this a bit earlier.

520
00:26:58,767 --> 00:27:00,743
In that case,

521
00:27:00,767 --> 00:27:02,535
what about this one?

522
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:05,509
Today is the 14th of November.

523
00:27:05,684 --> 00:27:08,285
I'm headed to Hera Palace right now.

524
00:27:08,309 --> 00:27:11,092
Seok Kyung's dad wanted to see me.

525
00:27:11,475 --> 00:27:13,910
If anything happens to me...

526
00:27:13,934 --> 00:27:16,009
No, if I die,

527
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:18,952
it will be Seok Kyung's dad, 100 per cent.

528
00:27:18,976 --> 00:27:20,451
That crazy brat.

529
00:27:20,475 --> 00:27:23,201
See? It's a hand I should play now.

530
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:25,326
Don't you think that's hard evidence

531
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,493
that shows you killed her?

532
00:27:26,517 --> 00:27:28,952
At the least, before you give an alibi

533
00:27:28,976 --> 00:27:31,676
to prove that you didn't kill her,

534
00:27:31,851 --> 00:27:34,076
the case will be completely against you.

535
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:37,076
It's my advice as an attorney.

536
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,925
What do you think you're doing?

537
00:27:39,267 --> 00:27:40,883
Joo Dan Tae.

538
00:27:41,309 --> 00:27:44,217
You probably shouldn't pick a fight.

539
00:27:44,434 --> 00:27:45,576
So?

540
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,259
Should I give this to the police?

541
00:27:53,059 --> 00:27:54,159
What do you want?

542
00:27:54,183 --> 00:27:55,410
Give me the 30 billion won

543
00:27:55,434 --> 00:27:56,660
I invested in Myeong-dong

544
00:27:56,684 --> 00:27:59,243
with five per cent interest.

545
00:27:59,267 --> 00:28:01,576
I need to save my life too.

546
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,743
We're moving the contract forward

547
00:28:02,767 --> 00:28:03,952
with Logan right now.

548
00:28:03,976 --> 00:28:05,201
Logan or whatever,

549
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,159
I don't care about that!

550
00:28:07,183 --> 00:28:08,994
I don't have the time or the patience

551
00:28:09,018 --> 00:28:11,118
to put up with that unpredictable man!

552
00:28:11,142 --> 00:28:12,994
So give me my money right away!

553
00:28:13,018 --> 00:28:16,217
I'm about to lose my law firm building!

554
00:28:18,225 --> 00:28:20,009
Is that all?

555
00:28:20,976 --> 00:28:22,592
For now.

556
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,925
I'll do that.

557
00:28:24,976 --> 00:28:26,368
It's not that hard to find

558
00:28:26,392 --> 00:28:27,618
mere 30 billion won in cash.

559
00:28:27,642 --> 00:28:29,451
Transfer the amount to my account

560
00:28:29,475 --> 00:28:31,384
by the end of the day.

561
00:28:31,684 --> 00:28:34,159
And when we meet again,

562
00:28:34,183 --> 00:28:37,050
try to talk with some respect, kid.

563
00:28:41,809 --> 00:28:43,718
What are you here to say?

564
00:28:44,183 --> 00:28:46,259
I have to get to work soon.

565
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:47,535
I don't think

566
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,410
you should be that brazen right now.

567
00:28:50,434 --> 00:28:51,910
We plan on officially filing a petition

568
00:28:51,934 --> 00:28:53,702
to Cheonga Arts High School.

569
00:28:53,726 --> 00:28:55,326
I can't let our kids be taught by

570
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:57,868
an immoral and shameless person like you.

571
00:28:57,892 --> 00:28:59,827
How can an educator have an affair?

572
00:28:59,851 --> 00:29:01,702
On top of that, with a parent

573
00:29:01,726 --> 00:29:02,952
of a student in your school!

574
00:29:02,976 --> 00:29:04,592
So what?

575
00:29:05,309 --> 00:29:07,618
What do you mean, "so what"?

576
00:29:07,642 --> 00:29:09,718
You need to resign!

577
00:29:11,517 --> 00:29:12,576
Did you run over

578
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,800
this early in the morning to say that?

579
00:29:14,976 --> 00:29:16,718
She just laughed.

580
00:29:17,142 --> 00:29:19,868
She thinks what we're saying is a joke.

581
00:29:19,892 --> 00:29:22,076
I'm guessing it hasn't hit you yet.

582
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,800
I have no other choice.

583
00:29:23,851 --> 00:29:27,259
I should go see the chief director.

584
00:29:27,392 --> 00:29:28,410
Or should we

585
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:30,842
report you to the district school board?

586
00:29:31,934 --> 00:29:33,676
Do as you'd like.

587
00:29:48,851 --> 00:29:51,467
What's this?

588
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,868
Min Hyuk and Je Ni's report cards

589
00:29:52,892 --> 00:29:53,910
from their middle school.

590
00:29:53,934 --> 00:29:54,994
As you can see,

591
00:29:55,018 --> 00:29:56,743
their grades and performance test scores

592
00:29:56,767 --> 00:29:58,702
were way below the cut.

593
00:29:58,726 --> 00:30:01,718
How do you think they got into Cheonga?

594
00:30:02,274 --> 00:30:03,170
"Grades"

595
00:30:03,195 --> 00:30:04,895
Did you already forget

596
00:30:05,767 --> 00:30:07,800
who helped you with that?

597
00:30:12,684 --> 00:30:14,535
The decoration cost for my house,

598
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:15,493
the artwork that's a good investment

599
00:30:15,517 --> 00:30:16,910
hanging in my sitting room,

600
00:30:16,934 --> 00:30:17,827
and the rental fee

601
00:30:17,851 --> 00:30:19,368
for Cheonga's graduation recital hall

602
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:21,118
were all covered by you,

603
00:30:21,142 --> 00:30:23,384
asking me to keep Je Ni in my favour...

604
00:30:24,183 --> 00:30:25,842
as a bribe.

605
00:30:28,142 --> 00:30:29,743
Whenever we hold events at school,

606
00:30:29,767 --> 00:30:31,451
we get a catering service sent to us.

607
00:30:31,475 --> 00:30:33,285
I get food on every holiday at home.

608
00:30:33,309 --> 00:30:35,159
I also get five different kinds of kimchi

609
00:30:35,183 --> 00:30:36,451
along with all kinds of side dishes

610
00:30:36,475 --> 00:30:37,827
piled up in my refrigerator

611
00:30:37,851 --> 00:30:39,800
thanks to you, Sang A, right?

612
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,842
I thought...

613
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:44,952
you both did that

614
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:47,259
because we're on the same boat.

615
00:30:48,684 --> 00:30:50,493
If you wish,

616
00:30:50,517 --> 00:30:53,217
I'll step down from my job at Cheonga.

617
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,592
But don't forget,

618
00:30:56,767 --> 00:30:58,676
once I'm gone,

619
00:30:59,809 --> 00:31:02,842
your children's life will end here too.

620
00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:08,634
Why should unqualified, bad students

621
00:31:09,225 --> 00:31:12,467
keep attending Cheonga Arts High?

622
00:31:13,642 --> 00:31:15,384
Don't you want them

623
00:31:15,767 --> 00:31:17,509
to get into Seoul University of Music?

624
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,576
That's not what we meant.

625
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,994
I just came

626
00:31:21,018 --> 00:31:23,076
only because Soo Ryeon asked me to.

627
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:26,159
So I figured I'd pass her words to you.

628
00:31:26,183 --> 00:31:28,576
That's why I came here.

629
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,785
Then make your choice.

630
00:31:29,809 --> 00:31:32,368
We don't even need to make a choice.

631
00:31:32,392 --> 00:31:34,451
I'll put all of my trust in you

632
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:36,384
and run together to the end.

633
00:31:38,809 --> 00:31:40,743
I told you that I didn't want to come!

634
00:31:40,767 --> 00:31:42,159
You put this weird outfit on me

635
00:31:42,183 --> 00:31:43,285
and dragged me here.

636
00:31:43,309 --> 00:31:45,910
Soo Ryeon and I never got along.

637
00:31:45,934 --> 00:31:47,368
You're close to her.

638
00:31:47,392 --> 00:31:49,410
Why would I meddle with their family?

639
00:31:49,434 --> 00:31:51,050
Sounds great.

640
00:31:52,059 --> 00:31:53,201
Their practical exams

641
00:31:53,225 --> 00:31:55,384
for the midterm will begin soon.

642
00:31:55,934 --> 00:31:57,509
I will be...

643
00:31:58,434 --> 00:32:01,009
great support...

644
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:05,718
for Je Ni and Min Hyuk.

645
00:32:29,392 --> 00:32:30,967
I'm sorry

646
00:32:31,684 --> 00:32:34,050
I was impersonating Min Seol A.

647
00:32:35,059 --> 00:32:37,118
It won't happen again.

648
00:32:37,142 --> 00:32:40,493
Yesterday, you insisted it wasn't you.

649
00:32:40,517 --> 00:32:42,259
It was me.

650
00:32:42,809 --> 00:32:43,702
Sorry.

651
00:32:43,726 --> 00:32:46,259
Ro Na, what's with you?

652
00:32:49,517 --> 00:32:50,785
Hey.

653
00:32:50,809 --> 00:32:53,451
You're awfully creepy.

654
00:32:53,475 --> 00:32:55,800
You can't let this go with an apology.

655
00:32:56,434 --> 00:32:57,910
Are you going to quit?

656
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,952
Of course you'll quit school, right?

657
00:32:59,976 --> 00:33:01,285
She admitted to what she did,

658
00:33:01,309 --> 00:33:03,676
so I'm sure she'll behave.

659
00:33:05,642 --> 00:33:07,243
Promise that you will

660
00:33:07,267 --> 00:33:09,509
never get smug before us again.

661
00:33:12,018 --> 00:33:13,368
Why?

662
00:33:13,392 --> 00:33:15,009
You can't?

663
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,285
One.

664
00:33:18,309 --> 00:33:20,368
I'm solely responsible for the threats

665
00:33:20,392 --> 00:33:21,909
that involve Min Seol A.

666
00:33:21,934 --> 00:33:23,138
"Agreement"

667
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:25,159
Two.

668
00:33:25,183 --> 00:33:27,827
I will not tell anyone about what happened

669
00:33:27,851 --> 00:33:30,842
in the community room yesterday.

670
00:33:32,225 --> 00:33:33,800
Three.

671
00:33:36,517 --> 00:33:38,243
I will do everything and anything

672
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:40,300
Ha Eun Byeol says.

673
00:33:45,392 --> 00:33:46,967
Write it down.

674
00:33:57,142 --> 00:33:58,967
"I will do everything and anything..."

675
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,078
"April 10, 2020, Bae Ro Na"

676
00:34:08,059 --> 00:34:10,451
If you break even one of these,

677
00:34:10,475 --> 00:34:11,994
your mum will

678
00:34:12,018 --> 00:34:13,159
never get to walk around

679
00:34:13,183 --> 00:34:15,217
with her head up high in Hera Palace.

680
00:34:17,892 --> 00:34:19,634
I promise.

681
00:34:21,767 --> 00:34:23,426
Run along.

682
00:34:31,642 --> 00:34:34,134
They're so passionate.

683
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,076
Joo Dan Tae, you piece of cake.

684
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,952
I can eat you alive with one bite.

685
00:34:46,976 --> 00:34:48,718
Don't get so cheeky.

686
00:34:50,767 --> 00:34:52,910
Hey, you just saved

687
00:34:52,934 --> 00:34:54,676
my life.

688
00:34:57,392 --> 00:35:01,467
Let's see if I got my 30 billion won.

689
00:35:03,767 --> 00:35:05,300
What's going on?

690
00:35:05,726 --> 00:35:07,118
Why didn't he send me the money?

691
00:35:07,142 --> 00:35:10,285
Joo Dan Tae, that stubborn idiot.

692
00:35:10,309 --> 00:35:12,883
He never listens.

693
00:35:17,475 --> 00:35:19,426
My dear Mi Ja!

694
00:35:20,434 --> 00:35:22,009
Come here.

695
00:35:24,767 --> 00:35:26,076
What did you say?

696
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,800
"My dear Mi Ja"?

697
00:35:28,934 --> 00:35:30,201
You idiot.

698
00:35:30,225 --> 00:35:31,618
Have you been using our law firm's name

699
00:35:31,642 --> 00:35:33,159
to make speculative investments?

700
00:35:33,183 --> 00:35:34,868
Is this true?

701
00:35:34,892 --> 00:35:36,159
Wait, who did...

702
00:35:36,183 --> 00:35:39,201
What have you been doing out there?

703
00:35:39,225 --> 00:35:40,451
How dare you get our law firm

704
00:35:40,475 --> 00:35:43,467
involved in this illegal investment?

705
00:35:43,851 --> 00:35:46,300
Mum, this isn't--

706
00:35:47,642 --> 00:35:49,451
What if your dad finds out?

707
00:35:49,475 --> 00:35:51,660
Not only are we going to get kicked out,

708
00:35:51,684 --> 00:35:53,243
but we're going to die on the same day.

709
00:35:53,267 --> 00:35:55,618
How are you going to patch this up?

710
00:35:55,642 --> 00:35:57,576
Why are you so harsh on me?

711
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,994
You made all this money

712
00:35:59,018 --> 00:36:01,718
thanks to your illegal investment!

713
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,743
What are you talking about? When?

714
00:36:03,767 --> 00:36:05,743
That's about the only thing

715
00:36:05,767 --> 00:36:07,285
I learned from you!

716
00:36:07,309 --> 00:36:09,800
You little brat.

717
00:36:13,475 --> 00:36:15,175
You brat.

718
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,076
Help me!

719
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,800
Spare my life!

720
00:36:25,018 --> 00:36:26,952
What the heck is all this?

721
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:29,592
Why should I have to take the bullet?

722
00:36:30,225 --> 00:36:31,883
Don't you know why?

723
00:36:32,142 --> 00:36:34,702
You let go of my hand first.

724
00:36:34,726 --> 00:36:35,952
There's no reason

725
00:36:35,976 --> 00:36:37,368
for me to look after you.

726
00:36:37,392 --> 00:36:38,576
Your law firm will

727
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,868
undergo a tax investigation soon.

728
00:36:39,892 --> 00:36:41,576
Do you expect me to go down alone?

729
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,426
All of us

730
00:36:43,934 --> 00:36:46,076
got into this together!

731
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,076
Of course, my name

732
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,910
won't be found anywhere.

733
00:36:48,934 --> 00:36:50,827
Did you think I got into this business

734
00:36:50,851 --> 00:36:52,551
without a safety net?

735
00:36:54,851 --> 00:36:56,201
Do you

736
00:36:56,225 --> 00:36:58,384
have to take things this far?

737
00:37:02,392 --> 00:37:04,050
Of course you do.

738
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,259
You're right.

739
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:08,759
I didn't think it through.

740
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:10,842
I must have gone insane

741
00:37:11,642 --> 00:37:13,326
over the 30 billion won.

742
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:14,618
You crazy idiot!

743
00:37:14,642 --> 00:37:16,342
You're insane!

744
00:37:17,726 --> 00:37:19,426
But still,

745
00:37:19,475 --> 00:37:22,676
we've gone through many ups and downs.

746
00:37:23,267 --> 00:37:25,259
We have so much history too.

747
00:37:25,726 --> 00:37:27,576
Chairman Joo Dan Tae!

748
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,217
Isn't that so?

749
00:37:34,684 --> 00:37:36,035
Gosh.

750
00:37:36,059 --> 00:37:39,243
Man, what can I do

751
00:37:39,267 --> 00:37:41,676
to make you feel better?

752
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,217
Should I kneel down?

753
00:37:44,267 --> 00:37:46,342
This is nothing to me.

754
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,743
I'll open up myself

755
00:37:51,767 --> 00:37:53,994
and show you how I truly feel.

756
00:37:54,018 --> 00:37:57,175
Bring Min Seol A's phone right now!

757
00:37:57,976 --> 00:37:59,551
Yes, sir.

758
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,910
The man named Gu Ho Dong is

759
00:38:08,934 --> 00:38:10,201
in a hospital?

760
00:38:10,225 --> 00:38:11,576
Yes, he got into

761
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,576
a huge car accident five years ago,

762
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,050
and he has been unconscious since then.

763
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,634
This is the real Gu Ho Dong.

764
00:38:21,183 --> 00:38:23,159
He's from Gyeongsang Province,

765
00:38:23,183 --> 00:38:24,785
became a PE teacher after he won a medal

766
00:38:24,809 --> 00:38:26,467
in the National Sports Festival.

767
00:38:27,684 --> 00:38:30,743
Then who's that man in Cheonga High?

768
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:32,535
I'm sure he bought Gu Ho Dong's identity

769
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:33,952
and faked his way to get the job.

770
00:38:33,976 --> 00:38:35,518
"Personal Information: Gu Ho Dong"

771
00:38:36,142 --> 00:38:39,509
Who in the world are you?

772
00:38:41,267 --> 00:38:43,076
You'd better do this right.

773
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,800
Why are you studying during the PE class?

774
00:38:50,976 --> 00:38:52,714
"Secretary Hong"

775
00:38:53,559 --> 00:38:54,743
What is it?

776
00:38:54,767 --> 00:38:57,050
Min Seol A's phone is turned on.

777
00:38:57,267 --> 00:38:58,842
Where at?

778
00:38:59,767 --> 00:39:01,426
Goodbye,

779
00:39:01,684 --> 00:39:03,342
my cash cow.

780
00:39:14,684 --> 00:39:16,800
Darn it, who is this?

781
00:39:20,392 --> 00:39:21,868
I'm sorry.

782
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:22,785
I'm sorry.

783
00:39:22,809 --> 00:39:25,092
Darn it. I'm a busy man.

784
00:39:29,434 --> 00:39:31,092
Darn you.

785
00:40:01,767 --> 00:40:04,467
Are you kidding me right now?

786
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:06,785
I swear, it was in here.

787
00:40:06,809 --> 00:40:07,868
I took it out of the safe

788
00:40:07,892 --> 00:40:09,243
and put it in my bag.

789
00:40:09,267 --> 00:40:11,535
Don't suspect me, please.

790
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:14,217
Should I slit my stomach and show you?

791
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:21,326
Chairman Joo.

792
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:23,076
Sir.

793
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,952
Let's just talk it out.

794
00:40:24,976 --> 00:40:27,217
Darn it. Hey!

795
00:40:27,642 --> 00:40:29,910
Hey, I was a famous bully in school.

796
00:40:29,934 --> 00:40:31,702
Hey, haven't you heard of Lee Kyu Jin

797
00:40:31,726 --> 00:40:33,159
from Daechi-dong?

798
00:40:33,183 --> 00:40:36,076
Fine, I shall teach you a real lesson.

799
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,551
Bring it on. Come on!

800
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,702
My gosh, hello.

801
00:41:52,726 --> 00:41:54,994
I'm Gu Ho Dong, the assistant HR teacher

802
00:41:55,018 --> 00:41:56,702
in the music department.

803
00:41:56,726 --> 00:41:58,201
It's a pleasure to meet you.

804
00:41:58,225 --> 00:42:00,217
My name is Logan Lee.

805
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:05,050
Gu Ho Dong was...

806
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,509
Logan Lee?

807
00:42:14,517 --> 00:42:15,743
For the first time in my life,

808
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:17,035
I have a family.

809
00:42:17,059 --> 00:42:18,800
"Welcome, Anna"

810
00:42:20,059 --> 00:42:21,967
Your brother is ill.

811
00:42:22,267 --> 00:42:24,535
So we need your help, Anna.

812
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:26,910
Come on. - I was set up! Logan!

813
00:42:26,934 --> 00:42:29,035
Hey! Please say something! - Come on.

814
00:42:29,059 --> 00:42:31,676
That was the first time I heard

815
00:42:32,434 --> 00:42:34,718
that I had an ill older brother.

816
00:42:37,934 --> 00:42:39,076
"With Anna at Central Park"

817
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,134
"April 11, 2016"

818
00:42:42,788 --> 00:42:45,356
"Pretty sister, silly brother"

819
00:42:47,851 --> 00:42:50,800
He's Seol A's adoptive brother.

820
00:42:59,225 --> 00:43:02,910
I'm certain that someone took it.

821
00:43:02,934 --> 00:43:04,368
I swear I had it in my bag

822
00:43:04,392 --> 00:43:07,009
when I was leaving the office.

823
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:10,618
Right, I bumped into someone

824
00:43:10,642 --> 00:43:12,535
in the lobby.

825
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:14,118
Maybe that jerk took it.

826
00:43:14,142 --> 00:43:15,285
If it happened in the lobby,

827
00:43:15,309 --> 00:43:17,551
there must be CCTV footage.

828
00:43:18,642 --> 00:43:20,634
Could it be...

829
00:43:21,018 --> 00:43:22,493
That's right! The one who set up

830
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:23,743
the mannequin show.

831
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,159
It's him.

832
00:43:25,183 --> 00:43:26,910
I'm sure of it.

833
00:43:26,934 --> 00:43:28,368
Chairman Joo.

834
00:43:28,392 --> 00:43:30,285
Catch him, and we'll get our hands

835
00:43:30,309 --> 00:43:32,576
on Min Seol A's phone-- - You little...

836
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,259
Shut your mouth, will you?

837
00:43:35,392 --> 00:43:36,952
Why keep that darn phone

838
00:43:36,976 --> 00:43:39,509
in the first place and cause this mess?

839
00:43:42,309 --> 00:43:44,342
Sir.

840
00:43:46,809 --> 00:43:48,842
Attorney Lee?

841
00:43:52,059 --> 00:43:54,243
About the redevelopment deal...

842
00:43:54,267 --> 00:43:55,326
What is it?

843
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:57,576
I just heard from Logan Lee.

844
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,994
He's on his way to the hotel now.

845
00:44:00,018 --> 00:44:01,035
Have the car ready.

846
00:44:01,059 --> 00:44:02,967
Ms Oh will come with me.

847
00:44:58,183 --> 00:44:59,243
Who are you?

848
00:44:59,267 --> 00:45:01,159
How did you get in here?

849
00:45:01,183 --> 00:45:02,451
So it was you?

850
00:45:02,475 --> 00:45:04,509
Seol A's adoptive brother?

851
00:45:04,892 --> 00:45:06,035
How could you blackmail me

852
00:45:06,059 --> 00:45:07,201
after doing that to my daughter?

853
00:45:07,225 --> 00:45:09,201
How dare you use Seol A's name.

854
00:45:09,225 --> 00:45:10,159
She was adopted

855
00:45:10,183 --> 00:45:11,618
for your bone marrow transplant.

856
00:45:11,642 --> 00:45:13,118
Then your family framed her for theft

857
00:45:13,142 --> 00:45:14,493
and revoked the adoption.

858
00:45:14,517 --> 00:45:16,535
Why didn't you just abandon her?

859
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:19,368
Why did you have to hurt that poor child?

860
00:45:19,392 --> 00:45:21,342
I had no idea.

861
00:45:21,684 --> 00:45:23,451
I only found out later on,

862
00:45:23,475 --> 00:45:25,925
and I wanted to take responsibility.

863
00:45:26,475 --> 00:45:28,342
But Seol A...

864
00:45:29,183 --> 00:45:30,785
Seol A died.

865
00:45:30,809 --> 00:45:33,702
How much did you pay Assemblyman Cho?

866
00:45:33,726 --> 00:45:36,175
I tried so hard to find you.

867
00:45:36,309 --> 00:45:37,785
You did a great job of hiding,

868
00:45:37,809 --> 00:45:39,285
thanks to your rich family.

869
00:45:39,309 --> 00:45:41,634
Why show yourself now?

870
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:43,576
My baby

871
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,159
saved your life, so the least you can do

872
00:45:45,183 --> 00:45:47,285
is live a decent life!

873
00:45:47,309 --> 00:45:49,800
You shouldn't even call yourself human!

874
00:45:50,018 --> 00:45:51,868
That's why I'm here!

875
00:45:51,892 --> 00:45:54,035
I know I don't deserve to be called human,

876
00:45:54,059 --> 00:45:55,035
but I wanted a chance

877
00:45:55,059 --> 00:45:56,718
to make it up to her.

878
00:45:57,767 --> 00:45:59,243
You darn jerk.

879
00:45:59,267 --> 00:46:01,159
Are you going to keep playing innocent?

880
00:46:01,183 --> 00:46:02,910
Every single day, I told myself

881
00:46:02,934 --> 00:46:04,676
that I must kill you.

882
00:46:04,809 --> 00:46:08,551
Die! Just die! Die!

883
00:46:10,892 --> 00:46:14,994
Stop it. Enough! Stop!

884
00:46:15,018 --> 00:46:16,800
Enough, okay?

885
00:46:17,392 --> 00:46:19,076
Enough.

886
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:21,009
I heard you loud and clear,

887
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:23,467
so just stop.

888
00:46:28,767 --> 00:46:30,592
Fine.

889
00:46:30,809 --> 00:46:32,634
Go ahead and kill me.

890
00:46:43,517 --> 00:46:45,326
But before that,

891
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:47,551
kill Joo Dan Tae first.

892
00:46:49,142 --> 00:46:50,910
Why?

893
00:46:50,934 --> 00:46:53,800
You can't give up on your family?

894
00:46:54,142 --> 00:46:55,076
Fully knowing

895
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:57,535
that he killed your daughter?

896
00:46:57,559 --> 00:46:58,702
Because he's your husband?

897
00:46:58,726 --> 00:46:59,952
Shut it.

898
00:46:59,976 --> 00:47:01,118
I will kill both Joo Dan Tae

899
00:47:01,142 --> 00:47:02,618
and Cheon Seo Jin myself.

900
00:47:02,642 --> 00:47:03,827
And you as well.

901
00:47:03,851 --> 00:47:05,451
But first, we need to find out

902
00:47:05,475 --> 00:47:07,134
who killed Seol A.

903
00:47:08,309 --> 00:47:12,092
Let me give you a chance

904
00:47:12,517 --> 00:47:14,159
to be a decent mother

905
00:47:14,183 --> 00:47:16,883
at least once in your life.

906
00:47:22,517 --> 00:47:24,342
Logan.

907
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:27,467
You promised to help me find my mum.

908
00:47:27,892 --> 00:47:30,076
There's something I want to check.

909
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,076
I want to see how she's doing.

910
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:34,243
How do you want her to be doing?

911
00:47:34,267 --> 00:47:37,551
I want her to be as miserable as I am.

912
00:47:39,684 --> 00:47:41,159
I used to think like that

913
00:47:41,183 --> 00:47:43,342
when I was little,

914
00:47:43,475 --> 00:47:45,384
but not any more.

915
00:47:45,892 --> 00:47:47,634
I...

916
00:47:49,392 --> 00:47:52,634
want my mum to be happy.

917
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:58,384
I want her to be really happy.

918
00:48:02,767 --> 00:48:04,618
Seol A.

919
00:48:04,642 --> 00:48:06,342
Logan.

920
00:48:06,767 --> 00:48:08,910
Find my mum

921
00:48:08,934 --> 00:48:11,800
and see if she's living a happy life.

922
00:48:12,309 --> 00:48:14,092
Then I...

923
00:48:16,392 --> 00:48:19,800
don't need to meet her again, ever.

924
00:48:20,267 --> 00:48:22,217
Seol A.

925
00:48:24,684 --> 00:48:27,883
I don't deserve to be happy.

926
00:48:38,018 --> 00:48:39,910
Let's avenge

927
00:48:39,934 --> 00:48:41,718
Seol A's death together.

928
00:48:41,809 --> 00:48:43,368
You can punish me

929
00:48:43,392 --> 00:48:45,342
after that.

930
00:48:45,684 --> 00:48:47,785
I won't join hands with a jerk like you.

931
00:48:47,809 --> 00:48:50,410
No. You're mistaken about me

932
00:48:50,434 --> 00:48:52,076
just like I was mistaken about you.

933
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:53,925
We share

934
00:48:54,142 --> 00:48:56,326
the same goal.

935
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,285
You have no right to do this.

936
00:48:58,309 --> 00:49:00,326
You should've protected Seol A.

937
00:49:00,350 --> 00:49:01,618
You should've protected her

938
00:49:01,642 --> 00:49:03,259
no matter what.

939
00:49:04,142 --> 00:49:05,952
I don't want to give excuses.

940
00:49:05,976 --> 00:49:07,201
But I know how I can atone for it.

941
00:49:07,225 --> 00:49:08,285
That's why I want to find out

942
00:49:08,309 --> 00:49:09,883
who killed her.

943
00:49:09,934 --> 00:49:11,285
I'll find out who did it

944
00:49:11,309 --> 00:49:13,384
and make the person suffer

945
00:49:14,934 --> 00:49:16,827
a thousand times more.

946
00:49:16,851 --> 00:49:17,971
No.

947
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:20,342
I don't trust you.

948
00:49:20,517 --> 00:49:23,159
I'm willing to risk my life for this.

949
00:49:23,183 --> 00:49:25,035
I'm going to avenge

950
00:49:25,059 --> 00:49:27,092
my baby Seol A's death.

951
00:49:28,392 --> 00:49:31,676
I'll destroy anyone who gets in my way.

952
00:49:56,934 --> 00:49:58,842
Honey.

953
00:49:59,267 --> 00:50:01,009
What are you doing here?

954
00:50:02,517 --> 00:50:04,259
I asked you a question!

955
00:50:04,809 --> 00:50:06,243
Why are you coming out

956
00:50:06,267 --> 00:50:08,259
of Logan Lee's room?

957
00:50:19,517 --> 00:50:20,827
Logan, will you please explain

958
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:22,718
what's going on?

959
00:50:23,684 --> 00:50:25,910
Why did my wife

960
00:50:25,934 --> 00:50:28,426
just come out of your room?

961
00:50:29,434 --> 00:50:33,175
You have a very admirable wife, Mr Joo.

962
00:50:34,642 --> 00:50:38,076
What exactly do you mean by that?

963
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:40,410
Well, to be honest,

964
00:50:40,434 --> 00:50:42,076
because of the unfortunate event

965
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:43,660
last night,

966
00:50:43,684 --> 00:50:44,910
I was actually thinking about

967
00:50:44,934 --> 00:50:47,009
cancelling our contract.

968
00:50:47,434 --> 00:50:49,868
But that was before your wife came

969
00:50:49,892 --> 00:50:53,551
and apologised for you instead.

970
00:50:54,350 --> 00:50:57,827
My gosh, you really have the best wife.

971
00:50:57,851 --> 00:51:01,009
You owe Soo Ryeon a big favour.

972
00:51:01,309 --> 00:51:02,368
I was very touched by

973
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:04,259
our conversation tonight.

974
00:51:04,851 --> 00:51:06,201
I'll take a step back

975
00:51:06,225 --> 00:51:08,384
and make a reconsideration.

976
00:51:09,309 --> 00:51:11,551
I appreciate it.

977
00:51:11,726 --> 00:51:14,009
We look forward to hearing from you soon.

978
00:51:22,434 --> 00:51:23,493
I'll be honest.

979
00:51:23,517 --> 00:51:25,660
We loaned Yoon Chul that money

980
00:51:25,684 --> 00:51:27,883
because we trusted you, not him.

981
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:29,326
I trusted that

982
00:51:29,350 --> 00:51:30,618
the daughter of the chief director

983
00:51:30,642 --> 00:51:31,743
would never run off with my money.

984
00:51:31,767 --> 00:51:33,827
I know nothing about that money.

985
00:51:33,851 --> 00:51:35,118
He told me nothing about it.

986
00:51:35,142 --> 00:51:38,118
But you're still accountable for it.

987
00:51:38,142 --> 00:51:39,967
You two are married.

988
00:51:44,976 --> 00:51:46,118
What are you doing here?

989
00:51:46,142 --> 00:51:48,259
You can talk to me.

990
00:51:48,517 --> 00:51:50,243
Hey.

991
00:51:50,267 --> 00:51:51,868
You've been ignoring my calls.

992
00:51:51,892 --> 00:51:54,259
Get out! I'll call you. - Darn it.

993
00:51:56,934 --> 00:51:58,201
Do you want to lose your credibility

994
00:51:58,225 --> 00:51:59,285
as a doctor?

995
00:51:59,309 --> 00:52:02,342
Pay me back at once, you swindler.

996
00:52:02,809 --> 00:52:04,035
How dare you call him a swindler.

997
00:52:04,059 --> 00:52:06,451
Why lend him money to begin with?

998
00:52:06,475 --> 00:52:07,910
Aren't you his childhood friends?

999
00:52:07,934 --> 00:52:09,159
How could you charge such high interest?

1000
00:52:09,183 --> 00:52:10,785
Why? Are you trying to use your friend

1001
00:52:10,809 --> 00:52:11,952
to get rich?

1002
00:52:11,976 --> 00:52:13,243
Hey. - What?

1003
00:52:13,267 --> 00:52:14,243
I didn't borrow money from you,

1004
00:52:14,267 --> 00:52:16,092
so keep your manners!

1005
00:52:16,225 --> 00:52:17,910
Stop causing a scene at my school.

1006
00:52:17,934 --> 00:52:19,883
Get lost at once.

1007
00:52:20,183 --> 00:52:22,076
Do you want to be dragged out?

1008
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:23,827
We can't wait for too long.

1009
00:52:23,851 --> 00:52:25,326
Next time we come, we'll camp out

1010
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:27,509
until we get our money back.

1011
00:52:35,892 --> 00:52:37,634
Yoon Chul.

1012
00:52:38,726 --> 00:52:40,076
Seems like you've gotten quite gutsy

1013
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:41,676
since marrying me.

1014
00:52:42,142 --> 00:52:44,076
What did you do with that money?

1015
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:45,910
Did you start a business or something?

1016
00:52:45,934 --> 00:52:48,076
Or did one of your relatives

1017
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:50,384
cause some kind of trouble again?

1018
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,827
Mind your own business.

1019
00:52:51,851 --> 00:52:53,827
I'll get it sorted out at all costs.

1020
00:52:53,851 --> 00:52:54,868
I heard your friends

1021
00:52:54,892 --> 00:52:57,092
lent you seven billion won in total.

1022
00:52:57,183 --> 00:53:00,592
How will you manage to pay it all back?

1023
00:53:05,767 --> 00:53:07,759
I'll take care of it for you.

1024
00:53:10,350 --> 00:53:12,551
In return for agreeing to a divorce.

1025
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:15,368
But you'll have to give up your custody,

1026
00:53:15,392 --> 00:53:16,660
the house, all our marital assets,

1027
00:53:16,684 --> 00:53:17,785
and even your position

1028
00:53:17,809 --> 00:53:18,868
at Cheonga Medical Centre.

1029
00:53:18,892 --> 00:53:19,994
Oh, one more thing.

1030
00:53:20,018 --> 00:53:21,493
I expect you to cooperate

1031
00:53:21,517 --> 00:53:22,785
until I officially become

1032
00:53:22,809 --> 00:53:24,368
the chief director.

1033
00:53:24,392 --> 00:53:26,300
Then your debt...

1034
00:53:27,142 --> 00:53:28,535
I'll take care of it for you.

1035
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:29,785
You want to cover up your affair

1036
00:53:29,809 --> 00:53:32,759
with seven billion won?

1037
00:53:39,851 --> 00:53:41,551
My affair?

1038
00:53:42,642 --> 00:53:44,785
Sounds like something a husband would say,

1039
00:53:44,809 --> 00:53:46,660
although we were never a true couple.

1040
00:53:46,684 --> 00:53:47,785
It's been over 10 years

1041
00:53:47,809 --> 00:53:49,493
since we last slept together.

1042
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:51,285
And you never gave me anything,

1043
00:53:51,309 --> 00:53:53,259
whether it's money or love.

1044
00:53:55,559 --> 00:53:57,800
How will you compensate me

1045
00:53:58,142 --> 00:54:00,759
for making my life so miserable?

1046
00:54:02,309 --> 00:54:04,076
You're the one who's responsible

1047
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:06,410
for our marriage falling apart.

1048
00:54:06,434 --> 00:54:09,009
For the past 17 years...

1049
00:54:11,767 --> 00:54:13,676
I was lonely every day,

1050
00:54:13,976 --> 00:54:15,535
and you never once gave me money

1051
00:54:15,559 --> 00:54:17,035
for our living expenses.

1052
00:54:17,059 --> 00:54:18,493
You never cared for or about

1053
00:54:18,517 --> 00:54:20,201
your own wife.

1054
00:54:20,225 --> 00:54:21,785
And now, you're acting like

1055
00:54:21,809 --> 00:54:23,285
I hurt you?

1056
00:54:23,309 --> 00:54:24,576
It's your fault

1057
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,800
that I had an affair.

1058
00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:30,175
Yet I'm offering you seven billion won.

1059
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:32,050
Isn't it a sweet deal?

1060
00:54:32,225 --> 00:54:35,368
I suppose you'll always be this selfish.

1061
00:54:35,392 --> 00:54:36,743
No way.

1062
00:54:36,767 --> 00:54:39,759
I won't let you get what you want.

1063
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:52,634
We'll see about that.

1064
00:54:59,767 --> 00:55:01,493
Ta-da!

1065
00:55:01,517 --> 00:55:04,009
Open it. It's for you.

1066
00:55:09,809 --> 00:55:12,118
I heard this is popular these days.

1067
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:13,410
You must be under a lot of stress

1068
00:55:13,434 --> 00:55:15,326
because of the midterms coming up.

1069
00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:17,426
I wanted to cheer you up.

1070
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:20,092
Do you like it? Isn't it so nice?

1071
00:55:22,392 --> 00:55:24,467
Why? You don't like it?

1072
00:55:25,018 --> 00:55:26,800
Shall we return it for an exchange?

1073
00:55:33,934 --> 00:55:35,660
I never asked you

1074
00:55:35,684 --> 00:55:37,592
to buy me this.

1075
00:55:39,559 --> 00:55:40,493
I never asked

1076
00:55:40,517 --> 00:55:42,326
for such an expensive wallet.

1077
00:55:42,350 --> 00:55:43,868
Ro Na.

1078
00:55:43,892 --> 00:55:46,035
What is this about?

1079
00:55:46,059 --> 00:55:47,785
I'm so sick of this.

1080
00:55:47,809 --> 00:55:50,035
Why did we have to move to Hera Palace?

1081
00:55:50,059 --> 00:55:52,718
I'm so upset!

1082
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:54,842
Hey.

1083
00:55:55,475 --> 00:55:58,175
What's the matter with her?

1084
00:56:02,309 --> 00:56:05,967
Don't worry, Mum. I'll take care of it.

1085
00:56:07,225 --> 00:56:08,994
I said, it's not a big deal.

1086
00:56:09,018 --> 00:56:11,718
I'll sort it out quickly. I have to go.

1087
00:56:12,434 --> 00:56:13,576
I guess the creditors

1088
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,493
went all the way to the orchard.

1089
00:56:15,517 --> 00:56:18,842
Your parents must be very worried.

1090
00:56:18,976 --> 00:56:20,493
This is why you should be cautious

1091
00:56:20,517 --> 00:56:22,175
when borrowing money.

1092
00:56:23,976 --> 00:56:25,868
Take some time and think about my offer.

1093
00:56:25,892 --> 00:56:28,076
It's a pretty sweet deal for you.

1094
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:31,384
I won't tell Eun Byeol for the time being.

Such emotional shock

1096
00:56:32,892 --> 00:56:34,660
could mess with her studies.

Here, the divorce papers.

1098
00:56:36,642 --> 00:56:37,535
Sign it.

1099
00:56:37,559 --> 00:56:39,384
I'll send you the money right away.

1100
00:56:40,059 --> 00:56:41,576
Don't keep this up

1101
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,551
because it's useless.

I'm really happy these days,

so I'm in good condition today.

1114

Are you saying

00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:13,118
I should do a bad job on purpose?

That's right. On purpose.

My gosh, isn't that good enough

1135
00:59:40,976 --> 00:59:42,660
to get into the top three universities?

I know who to side with now.

She sang out of tune?

1168
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:48,201
Yes, she was always obsessed

1169
01:00:48,225 --> 01:00:49,451
with acing her tests,

1170
01:00:49,475 --> 01:00:51,076
so I'm not sure why she made

1171

a mistake like that.

1172

what's going on with you,

for not being prepared for the test

and ruining the atmosphere.

1182

01:01:52,434 --> 01:01:54,994
We'll need her approval.

1193
01:01:55,018 --> 01:01:56,883
I'll tell her soon.

1194
01:01:58,517 --> 01:02:02,509
Sorry for the trouble I've caused you.

1195
01:02:18,142 --> 01:02:20,785
I was never qualified to become

1196
01:02:20,809 --> 01:02:23,342
a student at Cheonga Arts High School.

1197
01:02:23,642 --> 01:02:25,618
I'm a liar,

1198
01:02:25,642 --> 01:02:26,743
and I'm violent.

1199
01:02:26,767 --> 01:02:28,576
Because of my twisted personality,

1200
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:30,618
I can't have a normal school life.

1201
01:02:30,642 --> 01:02:33,467
All I do is cause harm to my friends.

1202
01:02:33,559 --> 01:02:35,576
I am submitting

1203
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:37,410
this letter of withdrawal because

1204
01:02:37,434 --> 01:02:39,285
I have concluded that I can't continue

1205
01:02:39,309 --> 01:02:41,676
my studies at Cheonga Arts High School.

1206
01:02:41,934 --> 01:02:43,800
Bae Ro Na.

1207
01:03:04,393 --> 01:03:07,444
"Fairmont Ambassador Hotel"

1208
01:03:28,434 --> 01:03:30,342
I have a question.

1209
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:33,300
How did you figure out

1210
01:03:34,142 --> 01:03:35,967
that I'm Seol A's mother?

1211
01:03:37,851 --> 01:03:39,118
I heard it from Director Min Hyung Sik

1212
01:03:39,142 --> 01:03:41,134
at Somang Children's Home.

1213
01:03:41,726 --> 01:03:43,467
I visited him at the detention centre

1214
01:03:43,642 --> 01:03:45,759
before he died.

1215
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:50,384
I have not forgiven you.

1216
01:03:51,225 --> 01:03:52,743
I'm just holding back my anger

1217
01:03:52,767 --> 01:03:55,092
for Seol A's sake.

1218
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:57,702
Don't get the wrong idea.

1219
01:03:57,726 --> 01:03:59,076
All right.

1220
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:02,925
Let's get rid of our mutual enemy first.

1221
01:04:06,767 --> 01:04:08,676
And what's next?

1222
01:04:11,475 --> 01:04:13,493
I bet you put together that fountain event

1223
01:04:13,517 --> 01:04:15,759
with a plan.

1224
01:04:17,059 --> 01:04:19,551
Did you underestimate Joo Dan Tae?

1225
01:04:19,892 --> 01:04:21,592
No, of course not.

1226
01:04:25,559 --> 01:04:28,785
I'll be joining hands with him soon

1227
01:04:28,809 --> 01:04:30,326
for the lot in Myeong-dong.

1228
01:04:30,350 --> 01:04:32,535
Go through Oh Yoon Hee in regard

1229
01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:34,426
to all business dealings with him.

1230
01:04:34,767 --> 01:04:36,509
Oh Yoon Hee?

1231
01:04:36,767 --> 01:04:38,551
She is

1232
01:04:38,809 --> 01:04:40,718
helping me.

1233
01:04:48,976 --> 01:04:50,285
Here's the list of everyone

1234
01:04:50,309 --> 01:04:51,285
who visited Hera Palace

1235
01:04:51,309 --> 01:04:52,883
on the day of the party.

1236
01:04:53,183 --> 01:04:54,243
Anyone suspicious?

1237
01:04:54,267 --> 01:04:56,576
No, I couldn't find anyone yet.

1238
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:58,243
That's impossible!

1239
01:04:58,267 --> 01:04:59,994
Are you saying that mannequin

1240
01:05:00,018 --> 01:05:01,925
just fell on its own?

1241
01:05:02,642 --> 01:05:03,702
Go through the visitor log

1242
01:05:03,726 --> 01:05:04,785
for the entire week.

1243
01:05:04,809 --> 01:05:06,118
Check everyone on that log.

1244
01:05:06,142 --> 01:05:07,243
Yes, sir.

1245
01:05:07,267 --> 01:05:09,326
I'll find this rat at all costs.

1246
01:05:09,350 --> 01:05:12,300
Chairman Joo! Chairman Joo!

1247
01:05:13,018 --> 01:05:14,410
I found him.

1248
01:05:14,434 --> 01:05:16,551
I found the guy.

1249
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:18,910
I scoured the CCTV footage from the lobby

1250
01:05:18,934 --> 01:05:20,243
and spotted the guy

1251
01:05:20,267 --> 01:05:22,743
who took the phone.

1252
01:05:22,767 --> 01:05:23,910
So who is it?

1253
01:05:23,934 --> 01:05:25,785
He was wearing a hat in the lobby,

1254
01:05:25,809 --> 01:05:27,118
so I couldn't see his face.

1255
01:05:27,142 --> 01:05:28,702
But the CCTV footage from outside

1256
01:05:28,726 --> 01:05:30,994
clearly shows his face.

1257
01:05:31,018 --> 01:05:32,759
You won't believe it.

1258
01:05:32,851 --> 01:05:35,967
It's someone you know.

1259
01:05:39,767 --> 01:05:42,493
My gosh. - Gu Ho Dong? What the...

1260
01:05:42,517 --> 01:05:44,535
He must be connected

1261
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:46,118
to Min Seol A somehow.

1262
01:05:46,142 --> 01:05:47,368
And I bet he's the one

1263
01:05:47,392 --> 01:05:49,509
behind that mannequin show.

1264
01:06:06,684 --> 01:06:10,217
No, please... Please don't kill me.

1265
01:06:39,517 --> 01:06:42,576
=Penthouse=

1266
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:43,493
Let's get a divorce.

1267
01:06:43,517 --> 01:06:44,451
I'll do what you want.

1268
01:06:44,475 --> 01:06:45,576
This is the best thing

1269
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:47,035
that ever happened in my life.

1270
01:06:47,059 --> 01:06:48,159
You're giving up the house

1271
01:06:48,183 --> 01:06:49,451
as well as custody of Eun Byeol.

1272
01:06:49,475 --> 01:06:50,785
Ro Na's stepdad?

1273
01:06:50,809 --> 01:06:51,868
I no longer need to go to school.

1274
01:06:51,892 --> 01:06:53,035
Don't let her drop out.

1275
01:06:53,059 --> 01:06:55,076
I'll accept her withdrawal right away.

1276
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:56,076
Don't go.

1277
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:57,994
The night Min Seol A died...

1278
01:06:58,018 --> 01:07:00,243
I stayed quiet for a reason.

1279
01:07:00,267 --> 01:07:02,076
We'll catch the culprit soon.

1280
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:03,800
Who is it?

1281
01:07:04,183 --> 01:07:06,551
You know Min Seol A, don't you?
