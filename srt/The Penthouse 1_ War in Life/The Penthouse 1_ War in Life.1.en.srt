00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,030
It's the state of art, isn't it?

6
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,990
Her voice is from the paradise.

7
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,400
Ms Oh, you know her too, don't you?

8
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,650
It's Soprano Cheon Seo Jin.

9
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,940
I only listen to trot music.

10
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,280
Trot music is the hottest these days.

11
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,690
So? Do you like this house, Mr Cho?

12
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,860
Well, it's not bad.

13
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,320
It's fully furnished,

14
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,490
and I'm sure people won't catch me here.

15
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,530
You don't have to worry about the safety.

16
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:31,860
This way, please.

17
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,150
You can make use of this door

18
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,240
in case of emergency.

19
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,780
Also,

20
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,440
it leads you right outside,

21
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:41,570
which is a big advantage.

22
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,690
That's pretty useful.

23
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:52,400
Right.

24
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,150
I've been meaning to ask since last time.

25
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:56,530
It has been quite hot.

26
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,150
Why do you always wear a scarf?

27
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,320
Doesn't it feel too warm?

28
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,320
Oh, it's all right.

29
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:03,240
There's no season in style.

30
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,570
I find it boring

31
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,110
if someone is too uptight.

32
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,070
You never know.

33
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,940
I might be able to help you out.

34
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,030
Don't do this!

35
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:15,530
Like I said,

36
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,490
I'm perfectly fine.

37
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,990
You have no clue what you just did.

38
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,650
Please excuse me.

39
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,190
The commission for this contract...

40
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,320
"The commission"?

41
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,530
Ms Oh, you're very brazen.

42
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,570
Did you think I didn't know

43
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:33,490
you've been doing this without a licence?

44
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,440
I can end your career

45
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,860
with one simple phone call.

46
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,860
If you understood, run along.

47
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,280
Wait, Mr Cho.

48
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,190
I've done so much legwork to show you

49
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,240
dozens of houses

50
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,240
over the last three months.

51
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,070
I've done my best,

52
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,610
so you should give me some compensation.

53
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:55,860
Get lost.

54
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:56,990
And stop bothering me.

55
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,650
Mr Cho, but this is too...

56
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,990
Hey, babe.

57
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,610
Where are you?

58
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,070
I hope you would get here in a flash.

59
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,360
I want you to come and see this house.

60
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,070
What? Yes.

61
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:10,990
Of course.

62
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:12,990
Yes.

63
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:19,490
Darn it.

64
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,240
That crazy jerk.

65
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,990
I thought that assemblyman was a big shot.

66
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:27,780
He's nothing but a big jerk.

67
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,530
I should put his head in a mortar

68
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:31,690
and grind it into dust.

69
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,360
What kind of a woman would

70
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,940
have an affair with that human trash?

71
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,650
"JYG Entertainment"

72
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,150

"Donated by Kang Ma Ri,"

Je Ni.

76
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:32,780
You need to flex your diaphragm

77
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,990
and push the sound forward.

78
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,360
You need to sing in your mask.

79
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,190
Resonate your voice in the mask.

80
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,150
Why can't you do that?

81
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,190
If I could do that,

82
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,690
why would I take lessons from you?

83
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,490
Oh my gosh.

84
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,530
Be honest.

85
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,940
You went to a karaoke room yesterday, no?

86
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,110
My midterms were over yesterday.

87
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,030
Can't I even do that?

88
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,240
You can't strain your voice

89
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,400
right before a competition.

90
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,900
I said you're never to sing pop songs.

91
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:03,070
Yoo Je Ni, what are you doing?

92
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:13,690
Darn it, that dirty rat!

93
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,400
I'll kill you when I catch you.

94
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,780
Darn it.

"Wisdom, Beauty, Sincerity"

96
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,740
Flex my diaphragm,

97
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,110
push the sound forward,

98
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,990
and resonate the sound in my mask.

99
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,610
I knew this would happen.

100
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,190
Bae Ro Na, it was you, wasn't it?

101
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,530
Who says you can use my practice room?

102
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,900
It's a practice room at school, not yours.

103
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,030
Didn't you know?

104
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,030
My mum and dad made this room for me.

105
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,570
And they bought the piano for me too.

106
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,190
No matter who made this room,

107
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,440
it's still a practice room at school.

108
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,360
It's not like this is your room.

109
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,110
Why wouldn't I be allowed in here?

110
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,240
Of course you can't!

111
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,740
This is

112
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,570
my practice room at school for me

113
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:11,740
to save time from travelling back home

114
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,030
so I can get in Cheonga Arts High School.

115
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,490
Don't you get what I'm saying?

116
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,110
Cheonga Arts High School?

117
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,440
I'm going to that school too.

118
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,320
To Cheonga Arts High School?

119
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,570
How on earth are you going to get in?

120
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,030
Do you have the money?

121
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:31,940
Can your mum give you

122
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,990
as much support as my parents do?

123
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,440
And Cheonga Arts High School won't accept

124
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,490
two students from a regular middle school.

125
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,360
Let me make myself clear one more time.

126
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:43,690
That's my place.

127
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,820
Don't even dream of getting in.

128
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,280
All I need is my voice.

129
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,650
I'm going to win against you

130
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,240
in this competition

131
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,610
and get the headmaster's recommendation,

132
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,990
without getting my parents' help.

133
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:00,400
Wait and see.

134
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,860
What's with her?

135
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,940
What is she saying?

136
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,400
Hey, stop right there.

137
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:07,780
Hey, Bae Ro Na!

138
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,740
Goodness, my daughter.

139
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,400
Did the practice go well?

140
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,610
Are you hungry?

141
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:21,900
Goodness, your neck is getting cold.

142
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,530
Your voice is your instrument.

143
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,030
Make sure you always keep your neck warm.

144
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,190
Okay. Let's go.

145
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,530
Darn it, I'm so annoyed, Mum!

146
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:32,740
What's going on? What is it?

147
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,780
You can tell me everything.

148
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,690
My princess, are you crying?

149
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,320
There's this awfully ugly girl

150
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,490
named Bae Ro Na at school.

151
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,110
And she dared to tell me

152
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,820
that she'll win against me

153
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,320
in this upcoming competition.

154
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:47,110
Then she practised in secret

155
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,190
in my practice room too.

156
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:50,280
Do I have to put up with this?

157
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,530
What is this insanity?

158
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,240
You shouldn't have to put up with that!

159
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,530
Don't tolerate anything like that.

160
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:55,820
You've got Mummy.

161
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,780
I'm going to show her what I can do.

162
00:11:59,070 --> 00:11:59,940
First off,

163
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:00,940
let's make her feel small

164
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:01,940
starting with your dress.

165
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:04,190
What do her parents do?

166
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,360
She has no dad. He's dead.

167
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,740
He's dead?

168
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,110
What about her mum?

169
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,610
What does her mother do?

170
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,570
This way. Come this way.

171
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:14,610
Come in. - Goodness.

172
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,400
Isn't the garden so lovely? - Gosh.

173
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,400
The front gate is way too far.

174
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,240
Isn't the decoration wonderful?

175
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,240
Please come up.

176
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,360
I'm so tired.

177
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,070
I must be out of my love battery

178
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:29,150
The view here is stunning, ma'am.

179
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,150
Of course.

180
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,820
My goodness!

181
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:33,900
My gosh.

182
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,030
Come and eat this.

183
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,110
Don't you have a better place?

184
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:41,070
I didn't like any of those houses.

185
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,320
Didn't you like the ones we saw

186
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,650
with the other real estate agent?

187
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,860
Ma'am, I'm so sorry.

188
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:47,320
If you give me just one more day--

189
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,400
Forget it.

190
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,860
Ma'am.

191
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,240
Thanks for the coffee.

192
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,780
Give me a call, ma'am.

193
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:01,400
Her maths academy?

194
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,190
Yes, Ro Na's teacher. Hello.

195
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,690
What?

196
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:08,690
Ro Na?

197
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,570
I'm home.

198
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,940
I got a call from your maths academy.

199
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,070
You haven't been there for a few months.

200
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,740
Did you buy things like these

201
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,320
with my hard-earned money?

202
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,820
Since when have you lied to me?

203
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,030
Mum, it's--

204
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:40,990
I already told you!

205
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:42,690
You aren't allowed to sing!

206
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:46,690
"Mozart"

207
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,610
I'm going to sing.

208
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,070
I want to study vocal music.

209
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:55,490
Why can't I?

210
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:56,940
Why won't you let me? Why?

211
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,940
You're a smart girl. You need to study.

212
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,570
I'll get you a tutor

213
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:01,530
if you don't like the academy.

214
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,110
You'll be an attorney or a doctor.

215
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,440
Why would you want to sing?

216
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,320
You've seen my life already.

217
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,190
You need to be certified to make a living!

218
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,150
You aren't allowed to go into vocal music.

219
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,240
You've never even heard me sing.

220
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,030
That's not something anyone can do!

221
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,190
I'm good!

222
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:16,940
I feel confident.

223
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,110
Why do you want to stop me this badly?

224
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,440
Your daughter is dying to do this.

225
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,070
I'm going crazy because I want to sing!

226
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:25,240
Why are you trying to stop me so badly?

227
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,190
No, seriously. Stop it!

228
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,150
Stop it!

229
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:35,530
Let it go!

230
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:41,150
It doesn't matter.

231
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,940
I memorised everything.

232
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,240
What?

233
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:45,990
From Mozart's "The Magic Flute",

234
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,240
"The Queen of the Night."

235

"The 25th Cheonga Art Festival"

238
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,990
"The 25th Cheonga Art Festival"

239
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,190
If you ever say you're going to sing,

240
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,740
I'm going to kill myself before you.

241
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,900
And you can start singing

242
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:53,070
after I die.

243
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,190
But never before that.

244
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,360
Do you understand?

245
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:40,690
I don't care what you say.

246
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,280
I'm going to sing.

247
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:54,610
Now, if you keep getting picky...

248
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,360
The fever continues for Hera Palace

249
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,320
in Samseong-dong, Gangnam-gu,

250
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:00,820
a residential complex that recorded

251
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,820
the highest sale price

252
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,150
per 3.3 square metre.

253
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,240
It's even called

254
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,150
a castle only for the top one percent.

255
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:09,610
Only a year after the residents moved in,

256
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,610
the appraised value of the real estate

257
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,320
rose by nine percent in average.

258
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:14,650
The increase shows...

259
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,190
It looks really great.

260
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,320
"The House Prices Skyrockets"

261
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,990
Could I ever get a chance

262
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:21,990
to live in a house like that in my life?

263
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,530

Stop.

Lee Min Hyuk.

268
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,240
Do you really want to study vocal music?

269
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,820
What?

270
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:50,490
Yes.

271
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,110
Are you sure you aren't just tagging along

272
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,240
because everyone else is doing it?

273
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,940
If you sing like this,

274
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,490
forget Seoul University of Music,

275
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,070
you won't make it to Cheonga Arts High.

276
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:01,440
Do you get it?

277
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,030
If you come to my lesson one more time

278
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,650
without practising, we're done.

279
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,190
I have a philosophy

280
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,240
that I don't teach a student

281
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,070
who's neither talented nor a hard worker.

282
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,860
Do you get it?

283
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:15,530
Yes.

284
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:16,440
What are you doing?

285
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,400
Go to the practice room.

286
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:26,320
He must be going through puberty,

287
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,030
so he hasn't been able to focus lately.

288
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,990
I'll give him a good scolding, Ms Cheon.

289
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,650
I don't think it's right

290
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,650
to give lessons to students

291
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,150
only because I'm friends with the parents.

292
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:36,990
If Min Hyuk can't improve,

293
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:40,110
I'll kick him out without mercy.

294
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,070
You already know

295
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,280
I have piles of students waiting

296
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,070
to take lessons from me.

297
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,570
Of course I do.

298
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:49,820
I know it's like

299
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,280
asking for the moon to get your lessons.

300
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:53,740
I really promise.

301
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:57,030
I'll make sure I bring back his attitude.

302
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,240
You know who my senior,

303
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,030
Announcer Jang Yoon Kyung, is, right?

304
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,150
Her in-laws are Mipoong Corporation.

305
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,360
I asked her for a favour

306
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,360
and got permission

307
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,530
to rent out Mipoong Art Hall.

308
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,940
What do you think about holding

309
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:13,190
Cheonga Foundation's next concert there?

310
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,320
Well, I'll talk to my father.

311
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,610
Goodness, that venue

312
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:23,860
is way too small.

313
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,440
Cheonga Foundation has a class.

314
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,490
That hall is already out of style.

315
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,740
Isn't that so, Ms Cheon?

316
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,240
Ms Kang, I'm sure you have a reason

317
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,440
for your bold statement.

318
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:35,240
Haeyeon Arts and Music Hall.

319
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:37,110
No way.

320
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:39,900
There's no way you can rent that venue.

321
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,650
They don't usually let this happen,

322
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,820
but I'm friends with the lady there.

323
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,280
She did that for me.

324
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,570
She promised

325
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:50,030
to have them seal the reservation

326
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,400
as soon as you give them my name.

327
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,690
So give them a call.

328
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,740
I feel like I owe you a big one.

329
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,900
I heard you have time for another student.

330
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:57,990
Ms Cheon.

331
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,780
You'll let Je Ni in, won't you?

332
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,150
"Application for Cheon Seo Jin's lessons"

333
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,440
You'll get a call.

334
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:13,360
Once she gets lessons from you,

335
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,400
she'll automatically get into

336
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:15,530
Seoul University of Music, won't she?

337
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:18,150
I'm going to leave

338
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,320
Je Ni's practical exams

339
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,780
and her grades all in your hands.

340
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,780
Ms Cheon, to me,

341
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,400
you're like the heavens.

342
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:25,360
The heavens.

343
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:29,110
Anyway, what's that trophy?

344
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,150
I haven't seen that before.

345
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,400
Goodness.

346
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,650
Isn't this the grand prize trophy

347
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,070
from Cheonga Arts Festival?

348
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:37,240
I can't believe I finally get to see

349
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,490
this legendary trophy.

350
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:40,070
Wait, why is it legendary?

351
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:41,990
Haven't you heard?

352
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,240
One of the students in her year

353
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,240
got jealous of Ms Cheon's talent

354
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,240
and hurt herself with this.

355
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,780
It was a bizarre incident.

356
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:50,860
Everyone who studied vocal music knows.

357
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:53,030
My gosh, that's horrible.

358
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,570
She got jealous and hurt herself?

359
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:56,780
What kind of a lunatic is that?

360
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,780
The best in the field is

361
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,190
always in the centre of jealousy and envy,

362
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:04,280
like Mozart, whom Salieri was jealous of.

363
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:07,490
So what happened to that girl?

364
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,280
She got her hands on something

365
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,400
she shouldn't have touched,

366
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,150
so she probably punished herself

367
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,030
and left this field forever.

368
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:18,610
Since that year,

369
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:23,030
this prize also disappeared forever.

370
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,400
If this trophy is that legendary,

371
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,650
may I touch it?

372
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,280
This trophy was like a ticket

373
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,820
to Seoul University of Music.

374
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,990
Only the best vocal music major student

375
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,070
could win this.

376
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,190
Right.

377
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:40,860
You know there's a meeting

378
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,570
for Hera Club tonight at my place, right?

379
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,690
Yes. - Yes.

380
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,740
You're only welcome

381
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,070
if you come empty-handed.

382
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:09,190
The door is open.

383
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:18,610
"Low Zone, 21st floor to 60th floor"

384
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,740
"High Zone, 61st floor to 99th floor"

385
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,280
What did she say?

386
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,940
"There's no way you can rent that venue"?

387
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,320
Does she think Kang Ma Ri is a joke?

388
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,860
Ko Sang A.

389
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,190
Do you think you're big

390
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,280
because your in-laws are in law?

391
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,820
I don't even like the sound of her name.

392
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,780
Darn it.

393
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:10,990
"Bar Exam Certification: Lee Kyu Jin"

394
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,190
"Wang Mi Ja's Healthy Korean Meals"

395
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,280
Where have you been?

396
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:22,780
You're never home.

397
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,530
How can you be busier than I am?

398
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,490
You're home already?

399
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:27,940
Didn't you have any trials?

400
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,780
You're home.

401
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,780
Mother.

402
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:35,990
When did you get here?

403
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,400
You haven't even called.

404
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:38,440
Why are you so shocked?

405
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:40,400
Do I have to call to be at my son's place?

406
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,110
Give me some fruit.

407
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,570
You got Shine Muscat, right?

408
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,070
Yes.

409
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,070
Give me a second.

410
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,780
You're here too, Ji Na.

411
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,780
You're looking miserable to see me.

412
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,440
Goodness, I wouldn't feel that way.

413
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:00,650
I'll get you some fruit.

414
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,440
Thanks a lot.

415
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:12,360
You're here too, Cho Won.

416
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:14,570
You've been a housewife for over 15 years,

417
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:15,900
but you still can't cook

418
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:16,940
to your in-laws' taste.

419
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,240
I know you acted all haughty

420
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,780
as an announcer before you got married,

421
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,190
but cooking is the least you can do.

422
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,150
Why? Isn't it seasoned to your taste?

423
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:26,740
This is why I can't leave you

424
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,780
in charge of the housework.

425
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:32,110
You never seem to do anything right.

426
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:33,440
You're right.

427
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:36,360
You should teach me how to cook.

428
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:38,150
I can't seem to get any better.

429
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,240
I give lectures all day long out there.

430
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,150
Do I have to come home and teach you too?

431
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:44,070
My head is about to burst

432
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,110
from teaching all those classes,

433
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:46,280
doing TV shows, and writing books.

434
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,740
Gosh, look at my hands.

435
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,990
Mum. Hey, Mum.

436
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,070
There's a meeting for Hera Club tonight.

437
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,150
What should I wear?

438
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,240
What about this one?

439
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,150
My son, you have a milky-white face,

440
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:57,740
so you look good in yellow...

441
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:58,820
I mean, blue.

442
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,820
Right, blue.

443
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:02,240
Then what about the tie?

444
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:03,990
It's not a formal occasion,

445
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:05,490
so you can go without one.

446
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,990
I'll pick something out for you.

447
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,530
Let's go, my son. - Hurry.

448
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,610
Darn it. I'm done.

449
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,900
Get some fruit for me too.

450
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,280
Okay.

451
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:23,110
I also want to live my life

452
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:25,030
saying everything I want to say.

453
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:26,150
Seriously.

454
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,030
Wear something else.

455
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,240
How many times do I have to say

456
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,360
that suit makes you look gloomy?

457
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:06,940
If you're the host, be more stylish.

458
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,030
I have a taste that's good enough

459
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,070
to pick out my own clothes.

460
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:12,320
Don't you think you're too much?

461
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:14,490
It's dinner with people we always meet.

462
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:17,240
You always overdo everything.

463
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,940
Are you even criticising my fashion now?

464
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:23,320
Do you hate to see your wife looks pretty?

465
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:25,860
What I hate is how you are over the top.

466
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,240
Do you still expect to look pretty?

467
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,900
You're practically covered in perfume.

468
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,150
She suddenly said she loves me.

469
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,150
My gosh. - Everyone else was there too.

470
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,860
My gosh, that looks great.

471
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,490
Come and take a seat, Ms Cheon.

472
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:09,900
Peking duck.

473
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,990
It's absolutely wonderful, Ms Cheon.

474
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:14,280
Please call me Seo Jin

475
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,940
when we're here by ourselves.

476
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:17,070
It's not like we're at school.

477
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,240
Gosh, we couldn't call a wonderful teacher

478
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,740
like you by your name.

479
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,070
If they actually call you by your name,

480
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:24,030
you'll think they're rude and be offended.

481
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,030
I wouldn't do that.

482
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,440
Feel free to call me whatever you want.

483
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,610
Anyway, Mr Ha, your face looks

484
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,240
radiant and bright.

485
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,150
Goodness, there's no way.

486
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,280
I'm always exhausted from surgeries.

487
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,820
Don't pretend like you're that tired.

488
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,030
I heard you only operate on VIPs.

489
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,190
Quiet.

490
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:51,070
I heard that hospital

491
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:52,820
breaks people's backs first

492
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:54,240
if you go in with a good back.

493
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:56,900
You've heard that rumour, right?

494
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,940
Honey, are you drunk?

495
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,990
Wait, you heard that?

496
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:04,490
Yes.

497
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:06,490
I'm just joking.

498
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,190
You're a big man.

499
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,360
Don't get so serious over a joke.

500
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,570
My goodness.

501
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,570
What are you looking at, you petty thing?

502
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,320
The only reason you look great is

503
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,740
because of your rich in-laws.

504
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:20,150
Attorney Lee, it's tough

505
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,150
to laugh at your jokes.

506
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,070
That nasty jerk.

507
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:25,820
You'll never make a living elsewhere

508
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,610
if it wasn't for your dad's law firm.

509
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,240
Anyway, why is the penthouse late again?

510
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,320
They must think they own this place.

511
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:37,440
If they bought the land,

512
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:38,740
built this up, and sold it in lots,

513
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,940
it means they do own this place.

514
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,990
I wonder if Soo Ryeon will come tonight.

515
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:43,990
Why would she?

516
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,530
She's such a busy woman.

517
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:47,990
I'm a little late.

518
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:49,940
Goodness. - Gosh.

519
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:51,900
Soo Ryeon.

520
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:52,820
Goodness.

521
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,940
It has been so long.

522
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,110
It has been a while.

523
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:56,940
Gosh, it's nice to see you, Soo Ryeon.

524
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:58,070
It has been a while.

525
00:29:58,610 --> 00:29:59,610
Thank you for inviting us.

526
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:02,610
We got started first.

527
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,740
Is that all right?

528
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,360
We're sorry we're late.

529
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,070
Have you all been well?

530
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:09,190
We should meet up more often.

531
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,740
We never get to see you

532
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:13,360
even though we live in the same building.

533
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,690
I mean, there's a deep connection

534
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,780
between everyone in Hera Club.

535
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:17,190
We first met when our kids began

536
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,610
studying vocal music in primary school,

537
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:21,320
so it has been five years already.

538
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,780
Exactly.

539
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,780
You should come to our art study club

540
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,690
and work out with us to get closer.

541
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,110
Well, I...

542
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,740
She always wants to be there,

543
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:31,190
but I never let her go.

544
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:32,780
I want to keep her to myself.

545
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:34,860
My gosh, he's so sweet. - Boo.

546
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,740
What a romantic guy. - Boo.

547
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,570
Gosh, what was that?

548
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:41,610
Be more considerate of this lonely woman.

549
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,740
Is Mr Yoo doing well in Dubai?

550
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,940
Of course he is.

551
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:49,990
His construction business is soaring,

552
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,400
so he can't seem to spare a moment

553
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:52,650
to come and visit us.

554
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,530
Everything looks delicious.

555
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:57,360
It must've been hard work to prepare this.

556
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:59,280
I couldn't serve you just anything.

557
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,740
I did do my best.

558
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,820
It doesn't take a lot of work.

559
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:05,490
That's the thing about food that's bought.

560
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:11,030
My gosh, really.

561
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,900
You're a woman who works.

562
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:19,820
It's a wonder that you're so considerate.

563
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,320
She's the best vocal teacher

564
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,650
who's in charge of our children.

565
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:24,110
That's why I made my first offer to you

566
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,490
when we parcelled out Hera Palace.

567
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,490
Thanks for the food, Seo Jin.

568
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,440
Thanks for the appreciation.

569
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,400
Oh, and this.

570
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,570
I couldn't come empty-handed.

571
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:35,940
It's a pecan pie.

572
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,610
Let's eat it together later.

573
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:38,860
Goodness.

574
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:43,190
We were supposed to come empty-handed.

575
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,940
Look at Ms Cheon.

576
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,990
She prepared a pecan pie too.

577
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,240
Look.

578
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:59,690
Hey, it looks like something my mum made.

579
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:01,490
May I try some right now?

580
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,240
Oh, sure.

581
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:05,860
Me too. Give me a slice.

582
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:07,570
My gosh.

583
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:11,940
This is amazing.

584
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,360
My gosh.

585
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:16,070
She's so talented.

586
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:18,240
You can sell this right now.

587
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:21,610
It tastes nothing like store-bought pies.

588
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:24,440
I got something perfect for the dessert.

589
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:26,490
Honey.

590
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,440
Will you bring some Bordeaux wine?

591
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:31,860
Let's share that great bottle.

592
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,150
Come on.

593
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,610
Okay, one second.

594
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,860
What are you doing? Move.

595
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,940
Is it fun to humiliate your wife

596
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:59,190
in front of other people?

597
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,360
Are you happy now?

598
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,190
Enough is enough.

599
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,940
Stop pretending like you're so elegant.

600
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,280
Don't you get tired?

601
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,150
Do you want your wife to look vulgar?

602
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:11,360
I'm doing this to save your face.

603
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,150
You need to be more honest.

604
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:16,360
You're only concerned about yourself.

605
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,490
I'm also only an accessory

606
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:18,860
that helps you look better.

607
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,610
If you really wanted to help,

608
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:21,990
you'd act more like Soo Ryeon.

609
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:24,240
Chairman Joo's business is thriving.

610
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,650
What do you think you're doing?

611
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:34,070
Do you think you look great

612
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:35,280
praising someone else's wife?

613
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,240
That little...

614
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:43,440
I couldn't find the toilet.

615
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:58,280
Men are all like that.

616
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,360
No way!

617
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:23,110
My gosh. - That's cool!

618
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,400
I'm jealous!

619
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,740
My gosh. - Us?

620
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,900
I need to go to the loo.

621
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,860
Guys, listen up.

622
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,240
My dear Sang A

623
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,190
is wonderful. - What was that?

624
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,280
Hey. - What happened?

625
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,650
Why is this here? - I'll help you.

626
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,030
Hey, Soo Ryeon.

627
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,740
Announcer Ko Sang A.

628
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:43,570
She was the best announcer

629
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:44,650
in all of Korea. - That's right.

630
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:46,110
Everyone loved her.

631
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,610
Of course.

632
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:49,030
She never says "jjajangmyeon".

633
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,690
She says "jajangmyeon".

634
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:54,150
Hold on. What is this?

635
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:55,570
Are you a fan?

636
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:56,940
Yes, of course.

637
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,360
My gosh. - I am a fan indeed.

638
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,610
Hey. - You should shake hands.

639
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,610
Sure thing. - My goodness.

640
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:04,990
What's going on here? - Gosh.

641
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:06,860
Come on. - Oh, my goodness.

642
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:18,990
I'll pour you a glass,

643
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,030
Mr Joo.

644
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:30,820
Let me do the same.

645
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:33,570
I'm a lucky man indeed.

646
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:34,940
But I have to say,

647
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,650
you married well yourself, Dr Ha.

648
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,280
No, not at all. - Come on.

649
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,610
I wouldn't say that.

650
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:42,030
What are you talking about?

651
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:44,280
Everyone envies you.

652
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,360
My gosh!

653
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,440
Oh, no. - Gosh.

654
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:00,110
Ms Cheon, are you all right?

655
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:01,650
Yes, I'm fine.

656
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,490
I'll go get changed.

657
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,400
It's fine. Don't bother.

658
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,530
Can you give me a hand?

659
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:05,070
Leave me alone. - Come on.

660
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:07,400
I'm okay. - She's doing this again.

661
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:08,530
Honey.

662
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,030
Honey.

663
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,570
Honey.

664
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,360
Leave me alone. - Come on.

665
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,280
Ma Ri. - You drank a lot.

666
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:15,570
What's she saying?

667
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:16,610
Are you all right?

668
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,740
Where were you, honey?

669
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,240
We should get going.

670
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,490
Everyone is drunk.

671
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,110
All right.

672
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:26,690
All right. - Come on.

673
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:29,240
Watch your step. - Let's drink a bit more.

674
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,150
Come on! Let's go for another round.

675
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,610
Take care. - Come to our place.

676
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:35,690
Bye. - Hey, we're leaving.

677
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:38,530
Hey! - Get home safely.

678
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:40,070
Let's go!

679
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,240
Hello.

680
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,320
Hi, you're early today.

681
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,900
"Hwayeong Middle School"

682
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,490
"End recording"

683
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:21,150
Give me 10 more minutes.

684
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:22,740
You can practise once I'm done.

685
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,530
My name is Bae Ro Na.

686
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,900
I just texted you my vocal sample.

687
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,240
I'd love to receive your singing lessons.

688
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:48,940
Please listen to it. Please.

689
00:39:58,860 --> 00:39:59,900
Hey!

690
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,740
Watch it!

691
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,650
"Wisdom, Beauty, Sincerity"

692
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:08,530
I want you to apologise.

693
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:10,690
Hey, I told you to apologise!

694
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,360
Are you mute?

695
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:14,360
Listen. Staying quiet won't do you

696
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,320
any good. Do you realise that?

697
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,780
Hurry up and say that you're sorry!

698
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:19,940
Hey!

699
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,150
What are you doing?

700
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,440
I can't believe this. - No!

701
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,240
Are you her mother?

702
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:28,940
How brazen of you.

703
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,150
You did a terrible job

704
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,320
educating your daughter.

705
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:32,990
How could she be evil enough

706
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:36,650
to drug her friend's drink?

707
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,110
My daughter

708
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,110
can't even speak right now.

709
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,780
She has a bright future ahead of her.

710
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:43,440
What will you do about this?

711
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:45,900
Her dream is to become a famous soprano.

712
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:47,360
Mum, I didn't do it.

713
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,280
I swear it wasn't me.

714
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,530
Look at this brat. Stop playing innocent.

715
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:52,320
We have the CCTV footage.

716
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,150
Are you going to keep denying it?

717
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,780
You and Je Ni were the only ones

718
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:56,690
in the practice room.

719
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,900
She drank from the tumbler

720
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:00,280
and started coughing up blood.

721
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,400
We saw everything.

722
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:02,650
You little brat. Look at you lying

723
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:03,990
without even batting an eye.

724
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:05,740
I really didn't do it! - Goodness.

725
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:09,150
I bet Je Ni staged all this.

726
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,990
She's not confident about the competition,

727
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:12,110
so she did it to frame me.

728
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:13,530
She's putting on an act!

729
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:14,820
She is unbelievable.

730
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,030
Sir, don't you remember what you told me?

731
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:19,820
You told me Je Ni went for karaoke

732
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,240
and came back with a sore throat.

733
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,860
Please say something!

734
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,400
You clearly told me that!

735
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,190
Have you lost your mind?

736
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:30,440
How dare you falsely accuse my daughter.

737
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:32,860
You deserve to be locked up in jail.

738
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,940
I'll report you to the school board!

739
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,150
Do you understand? - Ma'am!

740
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,400
What is the matter with you?

741
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:38,570
Gosh.

742
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,570
My daughter says that she didn't do it.

743
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:43,650
You don't even have any solid evidence.

744
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:45,240
Why believe this girl

745
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,030
but not my daughter?

746
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:48,490
We have proof.

747
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:50,360
The CCTV-- - What about it?

748
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:52,780
Does it show my daughter

749
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:53,740
drugging her drink?

750
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,110
No, right?

751
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,360
Do not treat my daughter like an assailant

752
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:02,610
until you find out what really happened.

753
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:03,530
What did you say?

754
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:04,940
I cannot believe this woman--

755
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:06,400
My gosh! - Ma'am!

756
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,400
If my daughter loses her voice for good,

757
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,570
I will make your daughter pay for it.

758
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:12,860
Brace yourself.

759
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,240
I'll have the Anti-bullying Committee

760
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,940
transfer her to another school at once.

761
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:17,240
What?

762
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:18,820
You'll have her transferred?

763
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:22,150
Je Ni, tell the truth. - Let her go.

764
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,400
I know you're lying.

765
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:25,280
I know you can talk! - My goodness!

766
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,400
What are you doing? - Tell the truth!

767
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:29,940
How dare you. - Hey! You, out of the way.

768
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:31,030
My gosh. - No!

769
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:32,280
You're so dead.

770
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,860
I'll teach you a serious lesson.

771
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,240
How dare you... - Ma'am.

772
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,990
try to harm my princess. - Stop!

773
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:42,440
I heard she locked Seo Jin up in the room

774
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:43,740
and beat her up.

775
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,820
She ended up hurting her neck

776
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,650
while trying to steal Seo Jin's trophy.

777
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,780
I feel bad for her.

778
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,490
That means she can't sing any more.

779
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:52,400
She was the top student

780
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:53,320
for three years straight,

781
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,990
but she's hit rock bottom overnight.

782
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,070
So she can't even go to college?

783
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,780
"Oh Yoon Hee, Suspended"

784
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:10,780
My goodness. - This way.

785
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,190
Thank you. - No problem, sir.

786
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:15,030
Thank you, Dad.

787
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,490
Get up.

788
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:26,650
I know you can walk! - What are you doing?

789
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:28,070
Get up! - Stop!

790
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:30,070
I know you're lying! Let go!

791
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:31,530
What's wrong with her? - Get up!

792
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,320
Why do I have to get suspended? - Gosh.

793
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,030
No! - Get up!

794
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:36,820
Stand up! - Stop her.

795
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:38,860
Enough! - Get up! Stop lying!

796
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,280
Gosh. - Are you okay?

797
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,280
Hey! - Are you all right?

798
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,860
Why can't you just leave her alone?

799
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:45,690
How dare you!

800
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:47,150
How dare you

801
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:48,530
try to steal my daughter's place!

802
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:53,320
Who taught you to be so evil?

803
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,440
Getting suspended isn't enough.

804
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:56,860
She should be expelled!

805
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:59,110
Headmaster, do you understand?

806
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:05,030
Come here. You're dead meat.

807
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:06,240
Please calm down. - You little...

808
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,690
I will teach you-- - Enough!

809
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,280
I'm sorry.

810
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:35,900
Mum.

811
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,320
You see,

812
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,070
I was so busy eking out a living

813
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:42,780
that I failed

814
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:44,530
to educate my daughter properly.

815
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:48,240
I will give her a good scolding,

816
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,070
so please do not involve

817
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:51,440
the Anti-bullying Committee.

818
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:52,860
Please, I beg you.

819
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:55,860
What are you doing?

820
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:57,190
Get up!

821
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,190
Get down on your knees

822
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,280
and apologise to your friend.

823
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,530
Apologise for what?

824
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,900
I didn't do anything wrong!

825
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,190
I refuse to get on my knees

826
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:06,440
for that coward!

827
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,320
That darn brat!

828
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:10,070
Ro Na. Ro Na!

829
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:11,780
Where do you think you're going?

830
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:13,240
I'll teach both of you

831
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,990
a serious lesson today.

832
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,860
Brace yourselves! I will make sure

833
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:20,610
your daughter can never sing again!

834
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:22,110
Do you understand?

835
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,150
Hey, you!

836
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:26,900
Ro Na, you can't storm out like that.

837
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:28,440
We need to resolve this.

838
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:29,900
If the committee gets involved,

839
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,990
we won't be able to win against them.

840
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:33,490
Whether you're guilty or not,

841
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:34,570
you'll be finished!

842
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:35,490
Why must I apologise

843
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:36,610
for something I didn't do?

844
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:38,570
How could you make your daughter

845
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:39,820
do such a thing?

846
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:41,440
Why did you join the vocal music club?

847
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,440
I told you not to sing!

848
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:46,070
Promise me that you will never sing again.

849
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:48,150
Then those people will let it go

850
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,740
and won't raise an issue about it again.

851
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,240
I know Dad's dead,

852
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:55,400
but you're no better than him.

853
00:45:57,030 --> 00:45:57,990
What?

854
00:45:58,110 --> 00:46:00,940
He at least liked hearing me sing.

855
00:46:01,490 --> 00:46:03,650
I know he would've taken my side.

856
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:05,990
I really hate you!

857
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,110
Ro Na. Ro Na!

858
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:10,530
Ro Na!

859
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:12,030
Ro Na.

860
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,320
Gosh.

861
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,650
Ro Na...

862
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:23,820
Ro Na.

863
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:41,280
Here, have some.

864
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:42,990
You too, Je Ni.

865
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:47,030
Do I really have to put up with this

866
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:49,740
after everything I've done for you

867
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:51,240
and all the other teachers?

868
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:52,990
Do you know how much I spent

869
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:54,990
on that piano for the vocal music club?

870
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:56,240
Right, of course.

871
00:46:56,570 --> 00:46:58,570
As the headmaster of the school,

872
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:00,110
I will have the Anti-bullying Committee

873
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:01,110
punish her severely.

874
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:03,030
Schedule a committee meeting right away.

875
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:04,320
Yes, ma'am.

876
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:10,990
Do not settle.

877
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,900
Get her transferred to another school.

878
00:47:13,150 --> 00:47:14,820
I want her gone.

879
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,280
Just talk.

880
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:19,610
I know you can talk,

881
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:20,940
so just talk.

882
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:24,110
Mum, how did you know?

883
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:26,940
You need to practise your acting skills.

884
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:29,030
When that girl, Bae Ro Na,

885
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:30,490
started arguing with the teacher,

886
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:31,690
you said, "Crazy brat."

887
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:33,690
I heard it, you fool.

888
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:35,440
Seriously? My gosh.

889
00:47:35,530 --> 00:47:36,490
Do you think she heard it too?

890
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:38,320
Had I not yelled that loudly,

891
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,740
you would've been caught right away.

892
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:43,740
Hey, did you really cough up blood?

893
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:46,400
No. It was red paint, obviously.

894
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:47,650
Gosh.

895
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:50,030
So what? Are you going to forgive her?

896
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:52,280
No. She dared to yell at my daughter.

897
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:53,610
I will never forgive her.

898
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:54,860
Don't you worry. I'll make sure

899
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:56,190
she can never sing again.

900
00:47:56,570 --> 00:47:57,860
They're scheduling the committee meeting.

901
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:00,240
You're sure, right?

902
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:02,240
If I don't get into Cheonga Arts High,

903
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,690
I'll just kill myself.

904
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:05,860
I told you I'll hire

905
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,940
the best teachers in the country

906
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,690
to give you private lessons.

907
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:12,150
Your dad's making a lot of money

908
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,570
in Dubai. You know that.

909
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,320
He called and asked me to tell you

910
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:17,110
that you can do everything you want.

911
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:19,190
He always says that but never visits us.

912
00:48:20,490 --> 00:48:21,440
Anyway, I have to go

913
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:22,990
to the same school as Min Hyuk.

914
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,650
Stop obsessing over that punk.

915
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:27,610
Try to get along with the other kids.

916
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:30,490
Ms Cheon said she'll create small groups

917
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:31,940
so she can focus on each student.

918
00:48:32,190 --> 00:48:34,190
They all go to Cheonga Arts Middle School.

919
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:37,240
Eun Byeol keeps making me feel left out.

920
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:38,440
Who cares about Eun Byeol?

921
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:40,240
Just make sure you become friends

922
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:41,490
with Seok Hoon and Seok Kyung.

923
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:43,030
Those twins

924
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:45,030
are the ones who will benefit you.

925
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:48,360
"Cheonga Arts Middle School"

926
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:57,360
"Joo Seok Hoon"

927
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:07,820
"Year, Class, Student Number"

928
00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:14,030
Sir.

929
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:15,240
What is it?

930
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,240
I made a mistake.

931
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:17,740
Can I get a new answer sheet?

932
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:32,400
"Joo Seok Kyung"

933
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:42,820
"Resume, Anna Lee"

934

"School: UCLA, Major: Mathematics"

935
00:49:51,110 --> 00:49:52,070
Hello.

936
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,990
I'm here for the maths tutor interview.

937
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,240
Anna Lee. Is that right?

938
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:09,530
Yes.

939
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:11,190
You can call me Anna.

940
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:16,070
You study maths at UCLA,

941
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:18,030
but you took time off?

942
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:19,570
Due to family issues,

943
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:21,150
I took time off after the first year.

944
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:25,940
Here's my proof of enrolment.

945
00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:33,360
I have a degree

946
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,900
from that graduate school.

947
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,650
The school is so beautiful

948
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:38,150
especially in autumn.

949
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:39,740
Right?

950
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:41,280
Well,

951
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:42,820
I guess all four seasons

952
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:44,190
at my school are beautiful.

953
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:45,990
I especially like

954
00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:47,150
the front of the Law School.

955
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,240
Because it's got all those fallen leaves.

956
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:53,150
What was the famous bakery

957
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:55,110
outside the campus called?

958
00:50:56,030 --> 00:50:59,190
I really loved their funnel cake.

959
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:01,240
Fulswits.

960
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:03,740
Oh, Fulswits.

961
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:06,280
You had caramel apple, right?

962
00:51:07,070 --> 00:51:08,240
There's such a long line,

963
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,360
they sell out by 10 in the morning.

964
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:16,150
I bought this apple pendant there.

965
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:17,490
Do you remember it?

966
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:18,940
I do.

967
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:22,780
It's been a while, and I miss the cake.

968
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:26,990
How about

969
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,900
I hear about the curriculum

970
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,360
you put together?

971
00:51:32,610 --> 00:51:34,690
I'm Anna Lee, your maths tutor.

972
00:51:35,110 --> 00:51:36,110
Nice to meet you.

973
00:51:37,150 --> 00:51:39,070
Why did you want to see us?

974
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:42,070
There's no tutoring during exams.

975
00:51:43,110 --> 00:51:44,900
I want to test you while I'm here.

976
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:48,490
What a joke.

977
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:50,190
Just because you're free,

978
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,190
you pick any date and time

979
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,440
and make us show up?

980
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:02,820
It'll only take 10 minutes.

981
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,860
Can you spare that much time?

982
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,280
Sit down.

983
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:15,150
No. I don't even have one minute.

984
00:52:15,570 --> 00:52:17,740
Just teach as much as you're paid.

985
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:20,030
How dare you want to test us.

986
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:21,740
We don't do such things.

987
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:23,110
I'd like it

988
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,530
if you didn't waste our time.

989
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:35,440
Your cardigan.

990
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,240
It's fake, isn't it?

991
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:41,110
Is this a blowfly?

992
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:46,650
If you're here to teach,

993
00:52:47,070 --> 00:52:49,490
act like a teacher and be honest.

994
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:53,820
Are you staying?

995
00:53:02,490 --> 00:53:03,990
That cardigan is a limited edition,

996
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:05,990
and only three were imported to Korea.

997
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:08,490
What should we do about you?

998
00:53:08,570 --> 00:53:10,740
It looks like you messed up on day one.

999
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,900
I'm so not interested in this class.

1000
00:53:15,490 --> 00:53:16,440
Take care.

1001
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,570
Seok Hoon and Seok Kyung

1002
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:21,320
are top of their year.

1003
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:23,530
Here, their word is law.

1004
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:26,740
You're not leaving?

1005
00:53:27,610 --> 00:53:29,240
I like you.

1006
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:30,740
What?

1007
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:32,190
Did you see Seok Kyung's face?

1008
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:33,860
She got intimidated

1009
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:35,110
when you told her to sit.

1010
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:38,150
I'll take the level test.

1011
00:53:38,490 --> 00:53:39,440
I'm Ha Eun Byeol.

1012
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:51,070
Will you go to the penthouse gathering?

1013
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:53,400
What does Chairman Joo want to

1014
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:54,740
brag about to the wives too?

1015
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:56,990
I hate his guts.

1016
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:54,320
I sold that building very nicely too.

1017
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,320
Thanks to you two.

1018
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,400
To the prosperity of Hera Club.

1019
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:05,190
Bravo.

1020
00:55:06,530 --> 00:55:08,650
Attorney Lee, you just love cash.

1021
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:10,440
For a rich family's only son.

1022
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:12,360
Not as much as you, Dr Ha.

1023
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:15,860
People who grew up lacking

1024
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:17,400
lust more for money.

1025
00:55:17,570 --> 00:55:18,490
What?

1026
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:21,690
Are you trying to pick a fight?

1027
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:22,610
What?

1028
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:25,360
Must you do this on a good day?

1029
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,280
No.

1030
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:34,110
Anyway,

1031
00:55:34,610 --> 00:55:37,240
when is the next deal, Chairman Joo?

1032
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:40,740
Let's get to it now.

1033
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:43,490
"Yuri Supermarket"

1034
00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:44,690
What's that?

1035
00:55:45,570 --> 00:55:47,360
Just 150m from that building,

1036
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:49,570
a metro station will open in three years.

1037
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:51,190
We'll flatten this

1038
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:53,490
and at 800 per cent of floor area ratio

1039
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:55,650
put up a new shopping complex.

1040
00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:01,740
You'll get 2.5 times of your investment.

1041
00:56:02,570 --> 00:56:03,610
That's guaranteed.

1042
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:09,490
Cheers.

1043
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:12,150
Deal. - Cheers.

1044
00:56:12,530 --> 00:56:15,110
My goodness! - Oh, my.

1045
00:56:15,530 --> 00:56:17,780
The penthouse really has

1046
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:19,280
an amazing view. - I know.

1047
00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:23,030
The whole of Han River is yours.

1048
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:27,030
And the interior design is so artful.

1049
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:30,530
It shows you majored in art.

1050
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,190
My gosh.

1051
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,070
Do you still paint?

1052
00:56:35,110 --> 00:56:36,070
Sometimes.

1053
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,150
Your home is like a gallery.

1054
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,240
Exactly.

1055
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:40,820
I don't believe this.

1056
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:42,490
Where are the kids?

1057
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:44,530
They're studying in the community room.

1058
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:46,650
Did the twins do well today?

1059
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:50,280
They'll top their year again, right?

1060
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:52,490
We must wait to see the results.

1061
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:57,400
Ms Cheon, you look like

1062
00:56:57,490 --> 00:56:59,740
a different person today.

1063
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:02,740
Was her neck always so lovely?

1064
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:04,690
I wanted a change.

1065
00:57:06,650 --> 00:57:07,490
What do you think?

1066
00:57:07,570 --> 00:57:08,740
It suits you so well.

1067
00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:10,240
So does the outfit.

1068
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:14,530
I haven't been up here in so long.

1069
00:57:14,610 --> 00:57:15,990
Only the men come here.

1070
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,360
From now on,

1071
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:20,070
I hope you invite us often too.

1072
00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:21,990
Sure.

1073
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:23,320
Come by often.

1074
00:57:24,030 --> 00:57:26,530
Let's toast to the penthouse.

1075
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:28,190
Cheers! - Cheers!

1076
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:31,740
What's this?

1077
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:34,030
Isn't this caviar?

1078
00:57:34,490 --> 00:57:35,940
My goodness!

1079
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:38,490
Will you look at this?

1080
00:57:38,570 --> 00:57:41,070
We could eat it with a spoon.

1081
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:42,440
It's delightful.

1082
00:57:42,530 --> 00:57:43,740
My gosh.

1083
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:46,440
Look at this.

1084
00:57:46,570 --> 00:57:48,070
It's amazing. - The lady

1085
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:49,690
of the penthouse is amazing.

1086
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:53,190
It looks delicious.

1087
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:55,400
What do you think? - No!

1088
00:57:59,570 --> 00:58:00,650
It'll be a one-off shock.

1089
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:02,110
Mr Yoon is on standby.

1090
00:58:02,190 --> 00:58:03,240
Don't worry about us and go.

1091
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:05,690
Thank you, honey. I'll call.

1092
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:08,240
Soo Ryeon.

1093
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:09,780
Where are you going?

1094
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:17,280
Chairman Joo.

1095
00:58:17,690 --> 00:58:19,860
You know I like you a lot, right?

1096
00:58:22,030 --> 00:58:23,900
Let's go and get a drink.

1097
00:58:23,990 --> 00:58:25,280
I'll carry you on my shoulders.

1098
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:26,740
No, thanks.

1099
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:27,940
It's an emergency.

1100
00:58:28,030 --> 00:58:29,530
The platelet count is falling.

1101
00:58:29,610 --> 00:58:30,820
Get an Ambu bag.

1102
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:33,530
Pump it up.

1103
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:34,650
Pravadoline.

1104
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:35,690
Hye In.

1105
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:37,190
Mum's here.

1106
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:40,530
You must fight.

1107
00:58:45,610 --> 00:58:47,820
"Intensive Care Unit, Staff Only"

1108
00:59:06,190 --> 00:59:07,490
It's mine!

1109
00:59:24,610 --> 00:59:27,150
"Mr Yoon"

1110
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:28,400
Get up!

1111
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:33,280
Take one each.

1112
01:00:07,650 --> 01:00:08,610
Are you crazy?

1113
01:00:09,650 --> 01:00:10,940
What can we do here?

1114
01:00:11,490 --> 01:00:13,440
Is there a reason we can't do this?

1115
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:16,320
They can't see us anyway.

1116
01:00:18,110 --> 01:00:19,070
I thought

1117
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:21,240
you liked something like this.

1118
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:22,860
Joo Dan Tae.

1119
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:27,780
Is this what you're like?

1120
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:31,150
Now

1121
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:33,070
I don't think I can stop.

1122
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,070
Oh, dear.

1123
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:56,360
Well, that's... - I shouldn't have had

1124
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:58,110
the last glass. I'm drunk.

1125
01:00:58,280 --> 01:00:59,940
One, two, three.

1126
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:02,150
Geez. - Too bad.

1127
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:04,070
Oh, well.

1128
01:01:07,610 --> 01:01:09,240
Let me give it a go.

1129
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:11,030
I failed again.

1130
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:19,900
Oh, dear. Dr Ha!

1131
01:01:20,070 --> 01:01:22,400
Honey! Will you get here quick? - Oh, no!

1132
01:01:22,650 --> 01:01:24,940
Mum! Mum... - Honey.

1133
01:01:25,030 --> 01:01:25,940
What is it?

1134
01:01:26,070 --> 01:01:26,990
Is he hurt?

1135
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:28,740
I'm bleeding.

1136
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:30,240
What should we do?

1137
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,530
It hurts. It hurts, honey.

1138
01:01:33,610 --> 01:01:34,530
Honey.

1139
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:36,610
Mum...

1140
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:39,240
Mum, Mum...

1141
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:40,740
Mum...

1142
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:48,690
Ro Na.

1143
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:53,690
Ro Na.

1144
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:54,820
Ro Na.

1145
01:01:55,110 --> 01:01:56,610
My gosh, Ro Na.

1146
01:01:58,490 --> 01:01:59,740
The Anti-bullying Committee's today.

1147
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:01,360
When you meet Je Ni's parents,

1148
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:04,190
just say you'll quit vocal music.

1149
01:02:04,490 --> 01:02:06,570
Or they'll force you to transfer.

1150
01:02:06,650 --> 01:02:07,820
I said okay.

1151
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:09,190
Will you say that 100 times?

1152
01:02:11,780 --> 01:02:13,860
You have to answer properly, okay?

1153
01:02:14,490 --> 01:02:16,650
I'll call you at 3 from the gate!

1154
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:26,780
The call cannot be--

1155
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:28,360
Why won't she pick up?

1156
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:29,360
This is insane.

1157
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:32,570
Come on, Bae Ro Na...

1158
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:34,240
Hey.

1159
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:36,530
Where's Ro Na? Is she still in class?

1160
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:39,320
She said she has a vocal lesson

1161
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:40,400
and left school early.

1162
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:41,360
She left early?

1163
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:43,440
What lesson does she have?

1164
01:02:43,990 --> 01:02:45,190
Do you know where it is?

1165
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,650
"Hera Palace"

1166
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:57,690
"Hera Palace"

1167
01:02:57,780 --> 01:02:58,990
Hello, Ms Cheon.

1168
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:01,240
I'm Bae Ro Na. I called you.

1169
01:03:02,110 --> 01:03:03,030
Bae Ro Na?

1170
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:07,360
I'm a fan of yours.

1171
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:10,240
I saw every one of your recitals.

1172
01:03:10,610 --> 01:03:11,650
I heard my favourite song

1173
01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:12,570
over 100 times.

1174
01:03:12,940 --> 01:03:15,150
I really want to learn from you.

1175
01:03:15,530 --> 01:03:17,320
Shine Hotel. 6 p.m.

1176
01:03:17,990 --> 01:03:19,570
I really want to be your student.

1177
01:03:21,490 --> 01:03:22,360
Too bad.

1178
01:03:22,990 --> 01:03:24,650
Actually, I have a full roster

1179
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:26,570
and can't take anyone else.

1180
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:28,440
You applied so many times,

1181
01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:30,780
so I called to say that in person.

1182
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:32,150
I'm a good singer.

1183
01:03:32,650 --> 01:03:34,400
If I learn from you,

1184
01:03:34,490 --> 01:03:36,150
I can do even better.

1185
01:03:36,490 --> 01:03:37,740
I will become the best.

1186
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:39,940
Vocal music takes more than passion.

1187
01:03:40,030 --> 01:03:42,240
You need a natural colour and tone.

1188
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:44,110
I just can't give up.

1189
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:45,990
My life is on the line.

1190
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:48,280
Will you please reconsider just once?

1191
01:03:48,490 --> 01:03:49,440
Please.

1192
01:03:52,490 --> 01:03:53,690
Why are you here alone?

1193
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:55,110
Where's your parent?

1194
01:03:55,690 --> 01:03:56,610
The truth is,

1195
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:59,610
my mum is against me singing.

1196
01:04:00,030 --> 01:04:00,860
Is she?

1197
01:04:02,490 --> 01:04:04,280
Then I can't teach you even more.

1198
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:06,690
A parent's support is a must.

1199
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:07,900
If you really want to sing,

1200
01:04:07,990 --> 01:04:10,240
you should convince your parents first.

1201
01:04:11,570 --> 01:04:12,490
You can go.

1202
01:04:14,030 --> 01:04:15,440
I said, go.

1203
01:04:22,110 --> 01:04:23,070
I'm trembling already.

1204
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:26,900
Bae Ro Na.

1205
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:30,190
Is that your name?

1206
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:32,280
Yes.

1207
01:05:35,070 --> 01:05:36,150
Who's your mum?

1208
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:37,240
Bae Ro Na!

1209
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:38,240
Where are you?

1210
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:39,610
What's wrong with you? - Mum.

1211
01:05:39,690 --> 01:05:41,280
Do you want to see me die?

1212
01:05:41,610 --> 01:05:43,440
What are you doing here?

1213
01:05:43,610 --> 01:05:45,030
Why won't you listen?

1214
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:46,240
If the committee

1215
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:47,820
rules against you, your life's over.

1216
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:48,820
Come with me now.

1217
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:49,740
Oh Yoon Hee?

1218
01:06:03,070 --> 01:06:04,240
Is it really you?

1219
01:06:05,070 --> 01:06:05,990
Oh Yoon Hee?

1220
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:09,150
We're leaving.

1221
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:10,070
Mum.

1222
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:11,320
Do you know Ms Cheon?

1223
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:12,610
How?

1224
01:06:12,690 --> 01:06:14,320
I don't know her! Let's just go.

1225
01:06:14,610 --> 01:06:16,240
I thought something was odd.

1226
01:06:17,070 --> 01:06:19,280
Her voice sounded so familiar.

1227
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:21,240
My gosh.

1228
01:06:22,070 --> 01:06:24,320
She is the daughter of the great Yoon Hee.

1229
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:28,820
I don't know you.

1230
01:06:29,530 --> 01:06:30,780
I forgot you, so...

1231
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:32,570
let's never meet again.

1232
01:06:32,690 --> 01:06:33,530
We're leaving.

1233
01:06:33,610 --> 01:06:35,190
Do you know my mum, Ms Cheon?

1234
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:36,240
Of course I do.

1235
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:37,740
We went to Cheonga Arts High together.

1236
01:06:38,690 --> 01:06:39,780
Cheonga Arts High School?

1237
01:06:40,690 --> 01:06:42,990
You went there? Why didn't you tell me?

1238
01:06:43,990 --> 01:06:45,650
Then why won't you let me sing?

1239
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:47,360
I'll explain at home!

1240
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:48,530
Come with me now!

1241
01:06:49,150 --> 01:06:50,070
But then,

1242
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:51,650
it's a shameful past.

1243
01:06:51,740 --> 01:06:53,320
It's best your daughter doesn't know.

1244
01:06:54,190 --> 01:06:55,940
You got too greedy

1245
01:06:56,570 --> 01:06:57,860
and got punished for wanting

1246
01:06:57,940 --> 01:06:58,780
what isn't yours.

1247
01:07:00,740 --> 01:07:01,990
From what you look like now,

1248
01:07:02,070 --> 01:07:04,240
you're still being punished.

1249
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:05,360
Am I wrong?

1250
01:07:10,690 --> 01:07:11,740
Shut your mouth.

1251
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:13,570
How dare you say something like that?

1252
01:07:13,990 --> 01:07:15,740
Whose fault is it that I'm like this?

1253
01:07:15,860 --> 01:07:17,150
Are you saying it's my fault?

1254
01:07:20,150 --> 01:07:21,820
You haven't changed at all.

1255
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:23,860
You blame others.

1256
01:07:24,690 --> 01:07:25,570
You ran off because

1257
01:07:25,650 --> 01:07:26,570
you weren't good enough.

1258
01:07:26,650 --> 01:07:27,820
How dare you blame others?

1259
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:31,820
I said we're leaving!

1260
01:07:32,030 --> 01:07:32,990
Come with me.

1261
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:35,280
No! Let go of me!

1262
01:07:35,650 --> 01:07:36,740
I want to sing.

1263
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:38,860
I must learn from Ms Cheon!

1264
01:07:39,110 --> 01:07:40,400
How dare you stop me?

1265
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:43,940
Yes. Take your daughter.

1266
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:45,400
Rather than become like you,

1267
01:07:45,490 --> 01:07:47,110
it's best she doesn't even start.

1268
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:48,780
Right?

1269
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,150
The highlight

1270
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:00,900
of the 25th Cheonga Art Festival.

1271
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:03,650
The prettiest voice from the heavens

1272
01:08:04,030 --> 01:08:05,490
takes the Grand Prize for Vocal Music.

1273
01:08:06,150 --> 01:08:08,070
The Bella Voce Award

1274
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:11,150
goes to a 12th grader.

1275
01:08:11,940 --> 01:08:13,690
Cheon Seo Jin.

1276
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:29,280
Well done.

1277
01:08:31,490 --> 01:08:32,320
Well done.

1278
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:33,280
Thank you.

1279
01:08:39,070 --> 01:08:40,610
What are you doing, Yoon Hee?

1280
01:08:40,690 --> 01:08:41,690
Come with me.

1281
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:42,650
Hurry up.

1282
01:08:43,610 --> 01:08:44,610
What's wrong with you?

1283
01:08:44,690 --> 01:08:45,780
Come here.

1284
01:08:51,110 --> 01:08:51,990
What?

1285
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:53,240
The Grand Prize?

1286
01:08:53,490 --> 01:08:54,860
You were off-key and you squealed.

1287
01:08:54,940 --> 01:08:56,110
How did you get Grand Prize?

1288
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:57,530
Don't you feel guilty?

1289
01:08:58,030 --> 01:08:59,280
Hand over the trophy.

1290
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:01,030
Did you think you'd always win?

1291
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:02,440
This is mine.

1292
01:09:02,740 --> 01:09:03,900
Cheonga Art Festival's Grand Prize.

1293
01:09:04,490 --> 01:09:05,400
This is all I need

1294
01:09:05,570 --> 01:09:06,820
to get into Seoul University of Music.

1295
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:07,740
Do you think people

1296
01:09:07,820 --> 01:09:08,820
won't know it's your dad?

1297
01:09:10,030 --> 01:09:11,150
The foundation chair gave bribes

1298
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:13,150
to get you the Grand Prize!

1299
01:09:13,490 --> 01:09:15,150
I will tell everyone!

1300
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:16,150
Go ahead.

1301
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:17,780
Do you think anyone will listen to you?

1302
01:09:18,530 --> 01:09:20,650
People only listen to the powerful.

1303
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:22,240
No one cares about

1304
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:23,530
people like you with nothing.

1305
01:09:24,070 --> 01:09:25,610
Go ahead if you think you can.

1306
01:09:26,030 --> 01:09:26,900
Give it to me.

1307
01:09:26,990 --> 01:09:27,900
Let go!

1308
01:09:28,690 --> 01:09:29,570
Hey!

1309
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:32,150
"Cheonga Arts High School"

1310
01:09:32,530 --> 01:09:33,650
That trophy is mine!

1311
01:09:34,690 --> 01:09:35,570
Hey!

1312
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:41,820
Hand it over.

1313
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:48,820
Give it to me.

1314
01:10:03,650 --> 01:10:04,530
It's mine.

1315
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:14,240
No!

1316
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:22,740
I won't lose this to you.

1317
01:10:23,190 --> 01:10:25,030
The humiliation you put me through!

1318
01:10:25,490 --> 01:10:26,860
You paid for it with this.

1319
01:10:27,150 --> 01:10:27,990
Did you see?

1320
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:29,440
I'm the best at Cheonga Arts High!

1321
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:31,900
Why would a poor kid even sing?

1322
01:10:33,610 --> 01:10:34,690
You poor thing.

1323
01:10:36,030 --> 01:10:36,900
What?

1324
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:38,650
You're so pitiful.

1325
01:10:40,190 --> 01:10:41,940
How long will you sing

1326
01:10:42,030 --> 01:10:42,990
coddled by your dad?

1327
01:10:43,150 --> 01:10:45,110
How dare you say that

1328
01:10:46,030 --> 01:10:47,030
to me of all people?

1329
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:48,360
For three years,

1330
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:51,690
you never beat me once with skills.

1331
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:53,780
No wonder you're furious.

1332
01:10:54,190 --> 01:10:55,400
That's why you got your dad

1333
01:10:55,490 --> 01:10:56,780
to fake the results!

1334
01:10:58,240 --> 01:10:59,110
Are you pleased?

1335
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:01,780
If that's how you must win,

1336
01:11:03,070 --> 01:11:04,190
go ahead, then.

1337
01:11:06,650 --> 01:11:08,070
If that's your dying wish,

1338
01:11:08,570 --> 01:11:09,740
I don't mind

1339
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:12,900
if you keep the Grand Prize.

1340
01:11:16,610 --> 01:11:17,490
Seo Jin!

1341
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:19,490
Are you okay? It's Dad!

1342
01:11:19,610 --> 01:11:21,400
Seo Jin! Open the door!

1343
01:11:21,690 --> 01:11:22,780
Get the master key.

1344
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:24,780
Can you come and open the door?

1345
01:11:24,990 --> 01:11:25,860
But you know what?

1346
01:11:27,570 --> 01:11:29,570
You can never beat me even in death.

1347
01:11:31,650 --> 01:11:34,440
Cheon Seo Jin, the fake winner.

1348
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:40,860
You thieving witch.

1349
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:43,240
Oh Yoon Hee.

1350
01:11:46,990 --> 01:11:48,940
I'll kill you if you say one more word.

1351
01:11:51,490 --> 01:11:52,400
What?

1352
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:53,820
Are you embarrassed?

1353
01:11:55,030 --> 01:11:57,240
Then hand over the trophy now!

1354
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:59,490
If you have any pride at all!

1355
01:12:22,820 --> 01:12:23,940
Seo Jin!

1356

Seo Jin.

1359
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:02,070
What happened?

1360
01:13:02,150 --> 01:13:03,110
Seo Jin! - Seo Jin!

1361
01:13:03,190 --> 01:13:04,070
Seo Jin!

1362
01:13:04,150 --> 01:13:05,190
Seo Jin! - Get her quick.

1363
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:06,240
Get her help.

1364
01:13:06,650 --> 01:13:07,780
Take her out quick. - Hurry.

1365
01:13:07,860 --> 01:13:09,150
Carry her outside.

1366
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:10,110
Hurry up!

1367
01:13:10,190 --> 01:13:11,110
Let's hurry.

1368
01:13:11,190 --> 01:13:12,190
Call for help!

1369
01:13:13,150 --> 01:13:14,070
Let's be quick.

1370
01:13:14,150 --> 01:13:15,360
My goodness.

1371
01:13:33,820 --> 01:13:34,780
I apologise.

1372
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:36,360
She just barged in.

1373
01:13:38,690 --> 01:13:40,690
How dare you do this?

1374
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:42,280
Be quick.

1375
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:43,650
I have a lesson soon.

1376
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:45,490
Let go of me!

1377
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:47,530
Let go. Come on.

1378
01:13:47,740 --> 01:13:48,780
Let go!

1379
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:56,360
Oh Yoon Hee.

1380
01:13:57,070 --> 01:13:58,240
It was your daughter?

1381
01:14:00,190 --> 01:14:02,070
Her voice is so much like yours.

"Anti-bullying Committee"

1383
01:14:09,530 --> 01:14:11,820
As the victim's mother,

1384
01:14:12,610 --> 01:14:14,240
I cannot forgive

1385
01:14:14,780 --> 01:14:16,740
this act of terror

1386
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:19,360
that happened in a sacred school.

1387
01:14:19,940 --> 01:14:21,740
Schools must raise good students.

1388
01:14:22,110 --> 01:14:23,570
If they raised criminals,

1389
01:14:23,940 --> 01:14:25,030
would that make sense?

01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:28,070
She denied it to the end.

1392
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:29,610
I demand that

1393
01:14:29,940 --> 01:14:31,820
that sly girl be severely punished!

1394
01:14:32,860 --> 01:14:34,990
People like you grow up to be

1395
01:14:35,490 --> 01:14:38,070
the evil of our society.

1396
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:41,360
How dare a kid poison a drink?

1397
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:44,240
You have no future!

1398
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:47,610
Every night, my daughter

1399
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:50,320
suffers from nightmares.

At all costs,

1402

she must be transferred.

1403
01:14:59,740 --> 01:15:00,690
I cannot have her

1404
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:02,820
stay in the same school as her bully!

1405
01:15:04,490 --> 01:15:06,190
Oh, dear.

1406
01:15:06,530 --> 01:15:09,070
Do you think you can ruin her life

1407
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:11,240
and go to an arts high school?

1408

I'll make sure your future's cut short.

You piece of trash!

1410

Who taught you to do this?

1411
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:20,240
If you lack smarts, at least be good.

1412
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:21,320
Shouldn't you be expelled?

1413
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:22,320
Exactly.

1414
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:23,610
That's very right.

1415
01:15:23,690 --> 01:15:24,650
You should be punished!

1416
01:15:24,740 --> 01:15:26,190
Pay for what you did!

1417
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:27,570
How could this even happen?

1418
01:15:27,650 --> 01:15:28,990
What'll you do now?

1419
01:15:29,070 --> 01:15:31,150
Is this how you taught your child?

1420
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,990
What more did you expect?

1421
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:34,570
You must pay for this!

1422
01:15:35,110 --> 01:15:36,360
Do something!

1423
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:37,780
Make her pay!

never beat me even in death.
