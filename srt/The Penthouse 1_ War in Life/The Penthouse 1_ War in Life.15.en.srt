Please don't kill me.

You shouldn't have gotten too cheeky,

Min Seol A.

9
00:01:05,953 --> 00:01:07,495
I have someone who can help me.

10

If anything bad happens to me,

11

my brother will find you

12
00:01:11,203 --> 00:01:12,370
and make you pay for this.

13
00:01:15,537 --> 00:01:16,412
Does this mean

14
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,454
Gu Ho Dong, that jerk,

15
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:19,579
is that brat's brother?

16
00:01:19,828 --> 00:01:20,746
Her brother?

=Episode 15=

18
00:01:21,746 --> 00:01:23,120
Min Seol A has a brother?

19
00:01:23,537 --> 00:01:25,287
Come on, I thought she was an orphan.

20
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:26,370
She must have someone she calls a brother

21
00:01:26,454 --> 00:01:27,828
who grew up with her at the orphanage.

22
00:01:28,078 --> 00:01:29,911
So a teacher at Cheonga High is

23
00:01:29,995 --> 00:01:31,870
from the same orphanage as Min Seol A?

24
00:01:31,953 --> 00:01:33,620
Why are you asking me?

25
00:01:33,953 --> 00:01:35,828
You need to go out there and find out.

26
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,120
I told you to find her phone first.

27
00:01:38,203 --> 00:01:40,078
Does it look like I'm not doing anything?

28
00:01:40,245 --> 00:01:41,287
Hey! I am...

29
00:01:46,162 --> 00:01:48,370
going to do my best.

30
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,828
I'll find it.

31
00:01:51,454 --> 00:01:54,287
If he's a teacher at the school,

32
00:01:54,746 --> 00:01:56,662
it'll be very easy, right, Secretary Cho?

33
00:01:57,787 --> 00:01:58,828
You can leave this

34
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:01,078
up to Kyu Jin.

35
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:02,370
I caused this trouble,

36
00:02:02,787 --> 00:02:04,328
so I'll patch it up too.

37
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:05,537
Chairman Joo.

38
00:02:06,162 --> 00:02:07,162
It's me. Lee Kyu Jin.

39
00:02:07,662 --> 00:02:08,579
Don't you trust me?

40
00:02:09,037 --> 00:02:10,412
Secretary Cho. - Yes, sir.

41
00:02:10,495 --> 00:02:11,787
Keep a close eye on Gu Ho Dong.

42
00:02:11,911 --> 00:02:12,787
Find out what he does

43
00:02:12,828 --> 00:02:13,704
and all of his history.

44
00:02:13,787 --> 00:02:14,620
Everything.

45
00:02:20,537 --> 00:02:22,203
My life can't be tainted by anyone.

46
00:02:23,328 --> 00:02:24,828
It took everything to climb up here.

47
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,162
My life must remain perfect.

48
00:02:40,662 --> 00:02:41,579
Hello?

49
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:42,704
Is this Bae Ro Na's mother?

50
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:45,037
This is Cheon Seo Jin,

51
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,370
Head of Arts at Cheonga Arts High.

52
00:02:47,412 --> 00:02:50,037
Ro Na wants to drop out of school.

53
00:02:51,162 --> 00:02:52,287
Were you aware of this?

54
00:02:53,203 --> 00:02:54,037
We do have

55
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,412
two weeks of consideration period.

56
00:02:55,495 --> 00:02:56,704
But if that isn't necessary,

57
00:02:57,828 --> 00:02:59,579
I'll process her request right away.

58
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,328
What's going on?

59
00:03:09,662 --> 00:03:10,662
Why are you dropping out?

60
00:03:10,828 --> 00:03:12,203
I don't want to go to school.

61
00:03:12,287 --> 00:03:13,203
What are you talking about?

62
00:03:13,287 --> 00:03:14,245
Don't you know how you got in there?

63
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:15,245
Come on, seriously.

64
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,828
Why are you suddenly doing this?

65
00:03:17,746 --> 00:03:18,870
What has suddenly got into you?

66
00:03:19,287 --> 00:03:20,412
I'm sick of everything.

67
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:22,537
The school

68
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:24,078
and singing.

69
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,787
Ro Na, something is going on, right?

70
00:03:27,078 --> 00:03:28,245
You can tell me.

71
00:03:28,328 --> 00:03:29,203
You can talk to me.

72
00:03:29,287 --> 00:03:30,495
I'll take care of everything!

73
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:31,870
There's no reason!

74
00:03:31,953 --> 00:03:33,162
I just hate everything!

75
00:03:33,245 --> 00:03:35,245
So why do you suddenly hate everything?

76
00:03:35,704 --> 00:03:37,037
Your midterm is right around the corner.

77
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,995
What kind of nonsense is this?

78
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:41,704
You said you'll bring me the trophy.

79
00:03:41,953 --> 00:03:43,078
That you'll get into Seoul University.

80
00:03:43,162 --> 00:03:43,995
You wanted to study abroad

81
00:03:44,078 --> 00:03:45,704
and become an opera singer!

82
00:03:45,787 --> 00:03:47,620
So why are you suddenly doing this?

83
00:03:47,704 --> 00:03:49,828
I must've been insane back then!

84
00:03:51,245 --> 00:03:52,078
What?

85
00:03:52,162 --> 00:03:53,662
Why did we move to Hera Palace?

86
00:03:54,203 --> 00:03:56,203
Why did you let me get into Cheonga High?

87
00:03:56,495 --> 00:03:57,828
It's all your fault!

88
00:04:11,787 --> 00:04:12,870
Chairman Joo is back.

89
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,620
You're late.

90
00:04:18,828 --> 00:04:19,704
The culprit of the mannequin incident

91
00:04:19,787 --> 00:04:20,620
will be caught soon.

92
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:23,495
You found the culprit?

93
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:26,328
Who was it?

94
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,245
Not yet.

95
00:04:28,662 --> 00:04:29,787
I'll tell you when I'm sure.

96
00:04:30,828 --> 00:04:32,412
I'll make sure I find that jerk

97
00:04:32,787 --> 00:04:34,370
and prove that I have nothing to do

98
00:04:34,454 --> 00:04:35,454
with Min Seol A.

99
00:04:37,454 --> 00:04:38,454
You should get some rest.

100
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:47,287
Be careful.

101
00:04:47,828 --> 00:04:48,911
My husband is looking for the culprit

102
00:04:48,995 --> 00:04:50,120
behind the fountain incident.

103
00:04:50,203 --> 00:04:51,078
"Logan Lee"

104
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,037
Thank you.

105
00:04:56,662 --> 00:04:57,746
You should be careful too.

106
00:04:57,828 --> 00:04:59,495
"Sim Soo Ryeon"

107
00:05:07,412 --> 00:05:08,454
Joo Dan Tae.

108
00:05:09,704 --> 00:05:11,704
I must have gotten on your nerves.

109
00:05:17,953 --> 00:05:19,203
What do you have to say?

110
00:05:20,328 --> 00:05:22,162
Sitting here with you face-to-face

111
00:05:22,787 --> 00:05:23,704
is uncomfortable.

112
00:05:27,412 --> 00:05:28,828
Our accountant told us that

113
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:31,828
you haven't reported Hye In's death yet.

114
00:05:32,953 --> 00:05:34,620
I understand how tough it is,

115
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,828
but she won't come back to life

116
00:05:37,328 --> 00:05:38,662
just because you won't let go of her.

117
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,579
You sound as if

118
00:05:43,037 --> 00:05:45,287
you've been waiting for Hye In to die.

119
00:05:47,203 --> 00:05:49,328
That was out of line.

120
00:05:51,037 --> 00:05:52,579
She spent 16 years of her life in bed

121
00:05:52,662 --> 00:05:53,746
before she passed away.

122
00:05:55,828 --> 00:05:57,662
I'm not in a hurry to report her death.

123
00:05:57,828 --> 00:05:59,787
There's land registered under her name,

124
00:05:59,828 --> 00:06:01,787
and the transfer process isn't simple.

125
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:02,787
My late father

126
00:06:03,828 --> 00:06:06,120
left that land for Hye In.

127
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,162
It's not mine or yours.

128
00:06:09,454 --> 00:06:10,495
Hye In died.

129
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,287
And we're her parents.

130
00:06:12,787 --> 00:06:14,328
If you and I wish,

131
00:06:14,495 --> 00:06:15,746
we can sell it at a good price

132
00:06:15,953 --> 00:06:17,537
and use it for a good cause.

133
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,370
Who says you can sell that land?

134
00:06:21,746 --> 00:06:23,704
I'm not ready to say goodbye to her yet.

135
00:06:24,995 --> 00:06:26,037
And I will manage

136
00:06:26,828 --> 00:06:27,953
this matter myself.

137
00:07:00,828 --> 00:07:01,704
"Divorce Application"

138
00:07:01,787 --> 00:07:02,953
"Divorce Application"

139
00:07:03,037 --> 00:07:04,037
Let's put an end to this.

140
00:07:04,662 --> 00:07:05,828
I'll do as you wish.

141
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:10,412
That was quicker than I thought.

142
00:07:11,454 --> 00:07:13,245
Your creditors must've been harsh.

143
00:07:13,412 --> 00:07:14,620
Keep your promise.

144
00:07:14,953 --> 00:07:16,662
Do not let Eun Byeol find out.

145
00:07:16,746 --> 00:07:17,995
You keep your promise.

146
00:07:19,662 --> 00:07:21,704
Keep it quiet from my father for a while.

147
00:07:22,412 --> 00:07:24,078
If I do not become the chief director

148
00:07:24,162 --> 00:07:25,287
because of our divorce,

149
00:07:26,037 --> 00:07:27,037
you'd better get ready to give back

150
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,203
all of your settlement money.

151
00:07:29,911 --> 00:07:30,828
I scheduled Eun Byeol

152
00:07:30,911 --> 00:07:32,037
for a counselling session.

153
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,704
She's totally fine. Why?

154
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:34,911
I'm a doctor!

155
00:07:35,995 --> 00:07:37,245
I made the decision for her sake,

156
00:07:37,328 --> 00:07:38,495
so you need to cooperate.

157
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,120
If you don't let her go,

158
00:07:40,579 --> 00:07:42,078
you won't get custody.

159
00:07:42,704 --> 00:07:43,662
Fine.

160
00:07:43,911 --> 00:07:45,245
If you must check, go ahead.

161
00:07:45,911 --> 00:07:47,454
You can turn that in tomorrow.

162
00:07:47,828 --> 00:07:48,787
There's no need to put it off.

163
00:07:48,828 --> 00:07:49,995
It's better for each other.

164
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,746
Seven billion won as alimony?

165
00:07:52,911 --> 00:07:54,162
That's pretty good, you know.

166
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,662
Should I be grateful?

167
00:08:02,287 --> 00:08:03,746
Are you sure you won't regret this?

168
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,287
Why would I regret this?

169
00:08:10,828 --> 00:08:12,746
I felt inferior for the first time

170
00:08:12,828 --> 00:08:14,245
when I got married.

171
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:16,037
I wanted a new experience

172
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,953
as a daughter-in-law

173
00:08:17,037 --> 00:08:18,828
of a poor family with a grape farm,

174
00:08:19,953 --> 00:08:21,828
and had to pay a terrible price.

175
00:08:24,995 --> 00:08:26,078
I finally feel like

176
00:08:26,162 --> 00:08:27,911
I came back to the real Cheon Seo Jin.

177
00:08:38,828 --> 00:08:40,828
"Front Door"

178
00:08:44,787 --> 00:08:45,746
Seo Jin.

179
00:08:45,828 --> 00:08:47,537
Ro Na can't drop out of school.

180
00:08:47,746 --> 00:08:49,495
I'm not going to give my consent for that.

181
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,662
If she doesn't want to go,

182
00:08:51,746 --> 00:08:53,412
how will you stop her from dropping out?

183
00:08:53,495 --> 00:08:55,245
I'm sure there's a reason.

184
00:08:55,579 --> 00:08:56,662
If you give me some time,

185
00:08:56,746 --> 00:08:58,203
I'll make sure I can change her mind.

186
00:08:58,787 --> 00:08:59,828
Give her just a bit of time.

187
00:09:00,328 --> 00:09:02,495
Ro Na always wanted to sing.

188
00:09:03,828 --> 00:09:05,245
Are you sure it's not what you wanted?

189
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,953
What?

190
00:09:07,037 --> 00:09:08,203
In my opinion,

191
00:09:08,828 --> 00:09:10,495
you're forcing your daughter to get

192
00:09:10,579 --> 00:09:12,454
something you could never have.

193
00:09:12,911 --> 00:09:15,245
You don't care about how tired she is,

194
00:09:15,495 --> 00:09:17,037
but you're caught up

195
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,454
in projecting yourself in her like a fool.

196
00:09:18,746 --> 00:09:21,162
I can see how tough it has been for Ro Na.

197
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:22,746
Stop blabbing nonsense.

198
00:09:23,953 --> 00:09:26,495
I'm going to persuade my daughter.

199
00:09:27,078 --> 00:09:28,037
Dropping out?

200
00:09:28,537 --> 00:09:29,579
She'll never do that.

201
00:09:30,245 --> 00:09:31,495
I couldn't graduate

202
00:09:31,746 --> 00:09:33,828
because of you and your father,

203
00:09:34,245 --> 00:09:35,579
I'll make sure Ro Na graduates

204
00:09:35,662 --> 00:09:36,911
from Cheonga Arts High School.

205
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:38,787
I will

206
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,287
make that happen.

207
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,787
I think letting her take the GED exam is

208
00:09:43,828 --> 00:09:45,162
probably a good idea.

209
00:09:45,579 --> 00:09:46,870
She's not weak in the head,

210
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:48,537
so I'm sure you'll find another way.

211
00:10:07,995 --> 00:10:09,370
"Letter of Admission"

212
00:10:09,953 --> 00:10:11,454
"Make a choice, take responsibility"

213
00:10:15,746 --> 00:10:16,870
What are all those out...

214
00:10:19,287 --> 00:10:20,454
I'm throwing them out.

215
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,537
I don't need anything

216
00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:24,579
like those sheet music.

217
00:10:27,037 --> 00:10:28,037
Ro Na.

218
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,620
Why are you dressed like that

219
00:10:29,704 --> 00:10:30,662
when you should leave for school?

220
00:10:30,746 --> 00:10:32,120
And why are you putting makeup on?

221
00:10:33,078 --> 00:10:34,037
I already told you.

222
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,579
I dropped out.

223
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,412
I won't do anything

224
00:10:37,828 --> 00:10:38,911
for a while

225
00:10:39,704 --> 00:10:40,620
and just kill time.

226
00:10:40,704 --> 00:10:42,245
What has got into you?

227
00:10:44,037 --> 00:10:46,203
Do you want to see me go crazy?

228
00:10:46,328 --> 00:10:47,495
Nothing is going to change

229
00:10:49,287 --> 00:10:50,704
no matter what the reason is.

230
00:10:51,828 --> 00:10:52,911
I'm not going to school anymore.

231
00:10:52,995 --> 00:10:53,995
Why won't you go?

232
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,328
You wanted to study at Cheonga High.

233
00:10:58,537 --> 00:11:00,412
I already told you that I hate it now!

234
00:11:01,162 --> 00:11:02,828
I don't want to sing anymore.

235
00:11:02,911 --> 00:11:04,995
I'm sick and tired of seeing music scores!

236
00:11:06,203 --> 00:11:07,245
Will you please

237
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,037
leave me alone?

238
00:11:09,412 --> 00:11:10,787
I'm not giving up on you.

239
00:11:10,953 --> 00:11:11,870
Come with me.

240
00:11:12,495 --> 00:11:13,911
Let me go! - Come!

241
00:11:13,995 --> 00:11:15,245
Let me go!

242
00:11:15,328 --> 00:11:16,620
Come with me this instant

243
00:11:16,704 --> 00:11:17,787
unless you want me to go crazy.

244
00:11:17,828 --> 00:11:19,120
Let me go!

245
00:11:21,078 --> 00:11:22,037
Cheon Seo Jin.

246
00:11:23,412 --> 00:11:24,662
Where are you, Seo Jin?

247
00:11:25,245 --> 00:11:27,412
Ms Oh, how may I help you?

248
00:11:27,495 --> 00:11:28,454
Stay out of this.

249
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:30,370
Cheon Seo Jin.

250
00:11:30,454 --> 00:11:31,620
Why are you making a scene

251
00:11:31,704 --> 00:11:33,078
at a school where students study!

252
00:11:33,537 --> 00:11:34,495
Get out of here right now

253
00:11:34,579 --> 00:11:35,579
before I call the police.

254
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:37,787
Have some manners, Ms Oh.

255
00:11:38,287 --> 00:11:39,828
This is the staff room,

256
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:41,828
and other kids are watching.

257
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:43,828
I need you to revoke

258
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:44,995
her withdrawal request.

259
00:11:45,787 --> 00:11:46,995
I never gave her my permission.

260
00:11:48,037 --> 00:11:48,953
Ro Na.

261
00:11:49,746 --> 00:11:51,495
Do you feel that way too?

262
00:11:51,662 --> 00:11:52,662
No.

263
00:11:52,828 --> 00:11:54,078
I already made my decision.

264
00:11:54,579 --> 00:11:55,537
I'm dropping out.

265
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,120
Ro Na, no.

266
00:11:57,828 --> 00:11:58,995
Tell her you didn't mean it.

267
00:11:59,287 --> 00:12:01,287
Tell her that you'll come to school.

268
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,911
I've done everything I can.

269
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:08,454
I'm too tired to go on.

270
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:10,203
I can't hold out anymore.

271
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,162
I ruined my practical test.

272
00:12:12,704 --> 00:12:14,328
I can't get into Seoul University anyway.

273
00:12:15,662 --> 00:12:16,704
Did you hear that?

274
00:12:17,162 --> 00:12:19,287
We respect our students' opinions.

275
00:12:19,412 --> 00:12:21,537
Above all, Ro Na made a confession that

276
00:12:21,911 --> 00:12:23,454
she knows she isn't talented enough

277
00:12:23,537 --> 00:12:24,995
to study here at Cheonga Arts High.

278
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,454
She finally realised what her value is.

279
00:12:28,537 --> 00:12:29,537
No.

280
00:12:29,828 --> 00:12:31,078
You people are the ones

281
00:12:31,162 --> 00:12:32,078
who are inadequate to be teachers.

282
00:12:32,287 --> 00:12:33,537
When your student goes astray,

283
00:12:33,704 --> 00:12:35,579
shouldn't you lead her to the right way?

284
00:12:36,203 --> 00:12:38,162
Why do you push her off the cliff?

285
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,162
Do you have any idea

286
00:12:40,704 --> 00:12:41,995
how hard Ro Na had to work

287
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:43,287
to get into Cheonga High?

288
00:12:43,953 --> 00:12:45,704
I know my daughter best.

289
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,537
She's not a girl who gives up this easily.

290
00:12:48,245 --> 00:12:49,787
She could've been bullied, attacked,

291
00:12:51,787 --> 00:12:53,078
or abused by a teacher.

292
00:12:54,579 --> 00:12:55,870
Shouldn't you investigate her case?

293
00:12:56,245 --> 00:12:58,203
Who are you trying to blame?

294
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,620
Ms Oh, your obsession

295
00:13:00,953 --> 00:13:02,078
and your inferiority complex could be

296
00:13:02,495 --> 00:13:04,870
what's cornering your girl into her doom?

297
00:13:05,746 --> 00:13:07,579
In the end, the one who ruined her

298
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:09,995
is you, Ms Oh.

299
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:12,746
Ro Na is the proof.

300
00:13:16,787 --> 00:13:17,662
Ro Na.

301
00:13:18,454 --> 00:13:19,828
Ro Na, where are you going?

302
00:13:20,537 --> 00:13:21,495
Ro Na.

303
00:13:26,537 --> 00:13:27,454
Ro Na.

304
00:13:28,287 --> 00:13:29,620
Ro Na, where are you going?

305
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,120
What are you doing?

306
00:13:35,495 --> 00:13:36,370
Let me go.

307
00:13:37,203 --> 00:13:38,870
Is it true that you dropped out?

308
00:13:39,579 --> 00:13:40,495
All of a sudden? Why?

309
00:13:40,995 --> 00:13:42,037
I'm sick and tired

310
00:13:42,704 --> 00:13:43,746
of this darned school.

311
00:13:45,579 --> 00:13:46,579
All of you won.

312
00:13:51,245 --> 00:13:52,203
Don't go.

313
00:13:53,245 --> 00:13:54,412
You didn't do anything wrong.

314
00:13:54,495 --> 00:13:55,787
Why should you give up?

315
00:13:57,162 --> 00:13:58,203
Min Seol A

316
00:13:59,828 --> 00:14:01,078
didn't do anything wrong,

317
00:14:01,495 --> 00:14:02,495
but she died.

318
00:14:04,746 --> 00:14:06,704
Do you finally get what you've done?

319
00:14:09,495 --> 00:14:10,454
Let me go.

320
00:14:11,078 --> 00:14:12,870
Even if we see each other at Hera Palace,

321
00:14:13,495 --> 00:14:14,662
don't ever talk to me.

322
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,454
Don't even say my name.

323
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,078
It's disgusting.

324
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:31,828
"Seoul Family Court"

325
00:14:35,037 --> 00:14:36,662
I just sent seven billion won.

326
00:14:36,746 --> 00:14:37,704
You can check.

327
00:14:37,828 --> 00:14:39,454
I know you're always precise with numbers.

328
00:14:41,537 --> 00:14:42,911
Let's shake hands and say goodbye.

329
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:48,370
Shake hands? For what?

330
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,495
We'll keep seeing each other at home.

331
00:14:54,953 --> 00:14:56,704
Let's live our lives freely from now on,

332
00:14:57,828 --> 00:14:58,953
just as we each wanted.

333
00:14:59,328 --> 00:15:00,203
This is the first time

334
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:02,370
we shared the same idea.

335
00:15:09,828 --> 00:15:11,203
I'll find a place to move out

336
00:15:11,287 --> 00:15:12,245
as soon as Eun Byeol gets better.

337
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,662
I'm looking for a hospital in my hometown.

338
00:15:15,495 --> 00:15:16,746
It'd be great if you could hurry.

339
00:15:18,037 --> 00:15:19,162
I have a class to get to.

340
00:15:19,537 --> 00:15:20,495
Please excuse me.

341
00:15:39,828 --> 00:15:41,078
"Doctor Ha Yoon Chul"

342
00:15:41,162 --> 00:15:42,328
He won't need this anymore.

343
00:15:47,328 --> 00:15:49,579
Hey, Dr Ha.

344
00:15:49,953 --> 00:15:51,370
Your face is glowing

345
00:15:51,704 --> 00:15:53,078
now that you're divorced.

346
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,162
Did the word get around that quickly?

347
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,412
I had to get a few things notarised,

348
00:15:57,495 --> 00:15:58,828
so I stopped by.

349
00:15:59,162 --> 00:16:01,203
Seo Jin is quite a perfectionist.

350
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,620
Now, you gave up on the house title

351
00:16:03,704 --> 00:16:04,995
and Eun Byeol's custody.

352
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,828
You'll resign from Cheonga Medical Centre.

353
00:16:07,078 --> 00:16:08,746
You are not allowed to ask for more money.

354
00:16:08,995 --> 00:16:09,870
Whoa, that's harsh.

355
00:16:10,828 --> 00:16:12,454
I already made the documents.

356
00:16:12,953 --> 00:16:14,328
You just have to seal these.

357
00:16:15,454 --> 00:16:16,620
Do as you'd like.

358
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,787
What a shame.

359
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,245
"Divorce Settlement Agreement"

360
00:16:25,328 --> 00:16:26,662
You should've ended this

361
00:16:28,662 --> 00:16:29,828
in a dirty and messy way

362
00:16:30,579 --> 00:16:32,412
for a guy like me to make a living.

363
00:16:33,537 --> 00:16:35,245
Didn't you agree to leave too easily?

364
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:38,037
Cheonga Foundation is worth a fortune.

365
00:16:38,953 --> 00:16:41,412
But you were in need of money

366
00:16:41,787 --> 00:16:43,120
because of the land in Myeong-dong.

367
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:45,037
Watch your mouth.

368
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,037
Eun Byeol doesn't know anything.

369
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,162
If you tell her anything,

370
00:16:48,245 --> 00:16:49,662
you won't work as an attorney again.

371
00:16:49,828 --> 00:16:51,245
Gosh, I'm so scared.

372
00:16:51,787 --> 00:16:53,203
A guy without a roof over his head is

373
00:16:53,287 --> 00:16:54,620
talking big right now.

374
00:16:55,828 --> 00:16:56,953
Dr Ha.

375
00:16:57,495 --> 00:16:58,995
You're penniless now.

376
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,537
And homeless.

377
00:17:01,953 --> 00:17:04,537
I'm a bit jealous of your freedom.

378
00:17:04,828 --> 00:17:06,704
But freedom without money? No thanks.

379
00:17:07,704 --> 00:17:08,620
Goodness.

380
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:10,495
You should worry about yourself.

381
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:12,078
You're about to lose your dad's building

382
00:17:12,162 --> 00:17:13,579
because of the lot in Myeong-dong.

383
00:17:13,662 --> 00:17:15,828
That's not the only building we have.

384
00:17:16,454 --> 00:17:17,370
Look.

385
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,787
Kyu Jin's family is

386
00:17:18,828 --> 00:17:20,245
in another level compared to...

387
00:17:20,328 --> 00:17:21,620
Forget it.

388
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:25,328
What will you do with Oh Yoon Hee?

389
00:17:25,953 --> 00:17:26,995
You're both single,

390
00:17:27,162 --> 00:17:28,203
so nothing is stopping you.

391
00:17:30,495 --> 00:17:31,537
No way.

392
00:17:32,245 --> 00:17:33,537
Are you Ro Na's stepdad?

393
00:17:34,328 --> 00:17:36,370
Yes, that's it.

394
00:17:36,746 --> 00:17:38,787
Is that why she dropped out?

395
00:17:39,245 --> 00:17:40,495
She's going to leave with her stepdad.

396
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:43,454
She dropped out?

397
00:17:43,953 --> 00:17:46,245
"Cheonga Arts High School"

398
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,203
"VIP Car Park"

399
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:55,120
The chief director wants to see you.

400
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,162
Dad, did you want to see me?

401
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,245
You're here.

402
00:18:01,412 --> 00:18:02,870
Mum, you're here too.

403
00:18:03,203 --> 00:18:04,370
I'm here too, Seo Jin.

404
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,203
Oh, hey.

405
00:18:10,287 --> 00:18:12,828
Why did you get everyone here?

406
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,203
I called you today

407
00:18:17,203 --> 00:18:19,328
to make an important decision.

408
00:18:20,746 --> 00:18:21,953
He must have softened up

409
00:18:22,037 --> 00:18:23,579
after suffering from that cold

410
00:18:23,662 --> 00:18:25,412
for a long time.

411
00:18:28,037 --> 00:18:29,620
He decided to step down

412
00:18:30,245 --> 00:18:31,828
as Cheonga Foundation's chief director.

413
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,911
Will you really, Dad?

414
00:18:38,328 --> 00:18:39,245
Yes.

415
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,454
I kept you waiting for a long time.

416
00:18:41,828 --> 00:18:42,911
Cheonga Foundation is

417
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:44,953
in your hands now, Seo Jin.

418
00:18:50,328 --> 00:18:51,412
Dad.

419
00:18:51,704 --> 00:18:52,746
What about me?

420
00:18:53,287 --> 00:18:54,537
Why can't I do it?

421
00:18:54,746 --> 00:18:56,495
You've got your powerful in-laws.

422
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,495
Seo Jin put in a lot of work

423
00:18:58,579 --> 00:18:59,787
to make Cheonga High what it is today.

424
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,287
And I commend her for coming back to Korea

425
00:19:03,412 --> 00:19:04,579
to keep the school together

426
00:19:04,662 --> 00:19:05,704
instead of keeping her career.

427
00:19:06,953 --> 00:19:07,995
I already finished

428
00:19:08,454 --> 00:19:10,370
doing the paperwork with Attorney Park.

429
00:19:14,245 --> 00:19:15,203
Dad.

430
00:19:18,078 --> 00:19:20,579
Thank you so much.

431
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,412
I'll do my best.

432
00:19:23,995 --> 00:19:25,953
I will never let you down.

433
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,620
From now on,

434
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,370
I'll develop the foundation further

435
00:19:32,412 --> 00:19:34,370
and turn it into the most respected

436
00:19:34,454 --> 00:19:36,704
private school foundation in Korea.

437
00:19:37,162 --> 00:19:38,203
Of course you will.

438
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:41,120
I spent all my life building up

439
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,203
Cheonga Medical Centre and Foundation.

440
00:19:46,454 --> 00:19:48,078
I will not condone a speck of flaw.

441
00:19:49,412 --> 00:19:50,328
Make sure

442
00:19:51,787 --> 00:19:54,203
you do not become the subject of gossip

443
00:19:54,287 --> 00:19:55,245
and behave well.

444
00:19:56,203 --> 00:19:57,162
Yes.

445
00:19:58,328 --> 00:19:59,287
I'll remember that

446
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,412
and never forget it for a moment.

447
00:20:02,579 --> 00:20:03,579
Congratulations.

448
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,620
When you married Yoon Chul

449
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,495
despite our disapproval,

450
00:20:07,828 --> 00:20:09,328
I was disappointed in you,

451
00:20:09,828 --> 00:20:11,078
but you've done well

452
00:20:11,162 --> 00:20:12,787
in keeping your family together.

453
00:20:13,287 --> 00:20:14,911
Your father believes

454
00:20:14,995 --> 00:20:16,370
a good family is the most valuable.

455
00:20:16,911 --> 00:20:18,953
Are you and Yoon Chul doing okay?

456
00:20:20,412 --> 00:20:22,412
I heard he often stays at the hospital.

457
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,579
Weren't things serious between you two?

458
00:20:26,828 --> 00:20:28,120
He had to do a lot of surgery lately,

459
00:20:28,203 --> 00:20:29,454
so he couldn't come home for a few days.

460
00:20:29,746 --> 00:20:31,162
Thanks for your concern.

461
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,579
But...

462
00:20:35,537 --> 00:20:36,995
we're doing very well.

463
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,537
I will...

464
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,120
continue to work hard, Dad.

465
00:21:41,412 --> 00:21:43,162
Something great must have happened.

466
00:21:46,995 --> 00:21:47,953
Today,

467
00:21:49,245 --> 00:21:50,911
the most wonderful thing

468
00:21:50,995 --> 00:21:52,328
in my life happened.

469
00:21:57,828 --> 00:21:58,953
What could it be?

470
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:01,787
I finally divorced Ha Yoon Chul.

471
00:22:01,828 --> 00:22:03,454
We turned in the paperwork at court.

472
00:22:06,412 --> 00:22:07,746
Sounds great. Congratulations.

473
00:22:08,787 --> 00:22:09,746
That's not all.

474
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:10,787
There's a bigger surprise.

475
00:22:12,162 --> 00:22:13,245
My father said

476
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:16,412
he'll let me take over Cheonga Foundation.

477
00:22:16,579 --> 00:22:18,120
I'm the next chief director.

478
00:22:19,287 --> 00:22:20,162
Are you serious?

479
00:22:20,746 --> 00:22:21,579
You've been anxious about it.

480
00:22:21,662 --> 00:22:22,537
That's really great news.

481
00:22:23,245 --> 00:22:24,828
I still can't believe it either.

482
00:22:25,454 --> 00:22:27,078
Seo Young used her in-laws' wealth

483
00:22:27,162 --> 00:22:28,245
and insisted on taking the position.

484
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,870
I thought my father changed his mind,

485
00:22:29,953 --> 00:22:30,911
and had been anxious.

486
00:22:33,412 --> 00:22:35,078
But everything is taken care of.

487
00:22:37,704 --> 00:22:38,620
On top of that,

488
00:22:38,995 --> 00:22:40,328
that awful girl Bae Ro Na

489
00:22:40,412 --> 00:22:41,911
is voluntarily leaving the school.

490
00:22:42,495 --> 00:22:43,787
How did all the great things

491
00:22:43,828 --> 00:22:44,828
happen at once?

492
00:22:44,995 --> 00:22:46,412
Bae Ro Na is leaving?

493
00:22:46,704 --> 00:22:47,704
She wants to drop out.

494
00:22:48,328 --> 00:22:49,870
Oh Yoon Hee came this morning

495
00:22:49,953 --> 00:22:51,495
and made a huge scene,

496
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:52,828
but what can she do?

497
00:22:53,037 --> 00:22:54,162
The kid wants to leave.

498
00:22:54,454 --> 00:22:55,746
Is that why she has been

499
00:22:55,828 --> 00:22:56,995
out of it all day long?

500
00:22:57,787 --> 00:22:59,120
I'm sure she's not in her right mind.

501
00:23:01,746 --> 00:23:03,746
How long will you keep her around?

502
00:23:03,828 --> 00:23:04,704
I don't want her there.

503
00:23:04,787 --> 00:23:06,078
Why haven't you fired her?

504
00:23:07,245 --> 00:23:09,120
Once Oh Yoon Hee is gone before my eyes,

505
00:23:11,037 --> 00:23:12,911
everything will be perfect.

506
00:23:13,828 --> 00:23:14,870
Don't worry.

507
00:23:15,203 --> 00:23:16,828
Once our contract with Logan is sealed,

508
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:18,078
of course I don't want

509
00:23:18,162 --> 00:23:19,162
to have her around either.

510
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,203
Let's not ruin our spirits

511
00:23:21,287 --> 00:23:23,120
on such a great day like this.

512
00:23:23,245 --> 00:23:24,828
All right, congratulations,

513
00:23:25,078 --> 00:23:26,579
Chief Director Cheon Seo Jin.

514
00:23:29,746 --> 00:23:30,620
Thanks.

515
00:23:32,704 --> 00:23:33,579
You were

516
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:36,495
the first person to find out.

517
00:23:43,245 --> 00:23:44,162
I love you.

518
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:19,828
Hey.

519
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:21,287
Get closer.

520
00:24:44,078 --> 00:24:45,370
Why did he come here?

521
00:24:46,412 --> 00:24:47,328
Why?

522
00:24:52,245 --> 00:24:53,412
One second. - Okay.

523
00:24:54,454 --> 00:24:55,370
All right.

524
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:58,995
Hello? - Chairman Joo.

525
00:24:59,412 --> 00:25:00,787
I've been tailing Gu Ho Dong,

526
00:25:01,203 --> 00:25:02,828
and he just parked his motorbike

527
00:25:02,911 --> 00:25:03,828
in front of the hotel

528
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:04,787
where Logan Lee stays at.

529
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:06,245
Why did he go there?

530
00:25:06,495 --> 00:25:07,662
Exactly.

531
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:09,953
Why did he come here of all places?

532
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:13,620
Do you think he's here to see Logan?

533
00:25:13,995 --> 00:25:15,579
If he did some digging,

534
00:25:16,078 --> 00:25:17,662
he'd know Logan is one of our VIPs.

535
00:25:17,746 --> 00:25:18,704
Darn it.

536
00:25:19,328 --> 00:25:21,120
What if he's here to tell Logan something?

537
00:25:21,203 --> 00:25:22,120
He couldn't...

538
00:25:22,495 --> 00:25:23,412
Oh, no.

539
00:25:23,495 --> 00:25:26,537
He's talking to Logan's secretary now.

540
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:28,870
I think I'm right.

541
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:30,412
Drag him out right now.

542
00:25:30,537 --> 00:25:31,828
Do not let him meet Logan.

543
00:25:31,911 --> 00:25:32,953
Stop him no matter what it takes.

544
00:25:33,787 --> 00:25:34,787
Why? What's going on?

545
00:25:34,828 --> 00:25:35,828
Did something go wrong?

546
00:25:35,953 --> 00:25:37,370
I'm sorry. I have to go.

547
00:25:37,454 --> 00:25:38,412
I'll call you later. - What?

548
00:25:42,911 --> 00:25:44,245
You're leaving like this?

549
00:25:59,953 --> 00:26:00,870
Are you all right?

550
00:26:01,037 --> 00:26:02,120
I'm sorry. - I'm fine.

551
00:26:02,203 --> 00:26:03,370
Are you hurt? - No, I'm fine.

552
00:26:03,454 --> 00:26:04,412
I'm totally fine.

553
00:26:04,911 --> 00:26:05,828
I'm--

554
00:26:08,412 --> 00:26:09,620
Hey, lay him down.

555
00:26:11,828 --> 00:26:12,746
Cover him.

556
00:26:13,704 --> 00:26:14,537
Let's go.

557
00:26:17,203 --> 00:26:18,537
"Jakomo"

558
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,620
Isn't this much more stylish?

559
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:22,287
This will be a great touch

560
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:23,828
to Ms Cheon's sitting room.

561
00:26:24,078 --> 00:26:26,662
But she has a very picky taste.

562
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:28,328
The colour has to be unique,

563
00:26:28,412 --> 00:26:30,579
but you can't get easily bored of it...

564
00:26:31,454 --> 00:26:33,037
This one. What about this?

565
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:35,078
I mean, it's a present,

566
00:26:35,162 --> 00:26:35,995
so let's give her a good one

567
00:26:36,078 --> 00:26:37,287
no matter how expensive it is.

568
00:26:37,953 --> 00:26:40,828
Ma Ri, you can be kind of cheap at times.

569
00:26:41,287 --> 00:26:43,704
Je Ni undeservingly got the third place.

570
00:26:43,787 --> 00:26:45,245
Is money the problem?

571
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,037
What are you talking about?

572
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,704
I can get her this entire showroom,

573
00:26:48,787 --> 00:26:50,078
and that still won't be enough.

574
00:26:50,162 --> 00:26:51,828
Why would I want to spare a few pennies?

575
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:53,870
You know what?

576
00:26:53,953 --> 00:26:55,328
I could even give her

577
00:26:55,412 --> 00:26:57,120
half of our entire fortune.

578
00:26:57,537 --> 00:26:59,162
My father-in-law promised that

579
00:26:59,412 --> 00:27:01,037
once Min Hyuk gets into Seoul University,

580
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:03,037
he'll give me the business building

581
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,287
in Songpa-gu.

582
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:05,454
What has got into

583
00:27:05,537 --> 00:27:07,287
that old cheapskate?

584
00:27:07,495 --> 00:27:08,495
Thanks to Min Hyuk,

585
00:27:08,828 --> 00:27:11,203
you'll get 10 billion won out of nowhere.

586
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,828
We can't just stand around.

587
00:27:14,911 --> 00:27:17,828
Should we raise the quality of her gift?

588
00:27:17,911 --> 00:27:18,828
Okay.

589
00:27:19,245 --> 00:27:20,162
You're here.

590
00:27:21,828 --> 00:27:23,454
Why didn't you call me before you came?

591
00:27:23,746 --> 00:27:25,162
I went out for a moment.

592
00:27:25,495 --> 00:27:27,162
We just got here too.

593
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:28,704
I wanted to get a new sofa

594
00:27:28,787 --> 00:27:30,078
to change my decoration a bit.

595
00:27:30,454 --> 00:27:31,579
It's for me.

596
00:27:31,662 --> 00:27:32,579
Me too.

597
00:27:33,203 --> 00:27:34,203
I see.

598
00:27:34,537 --> 00:27:35,704
You can browse as much as you'd like.

599
00:27:36,245 --> 00:27:37,162
Anyway,

600
00:27:37,787 --> 00:27:39,995
how's that family doing?

601
00:27:40,287 --> 00:27:41,245
It must be chaotic.

602
00:27:42,078 --> 00:27:42,911
Pardon?

603
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:43,828
I mean, Ro Na's family.

604
00:27:43,911 --> 00:27:45,328
I heard she withdrew from school.

605
00:27:46,203 --> 00:27:47,787
Why did she do that?

606
00:27:47,911 --> 00:27:49,537
I thought she was doing fine.

607
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,579
Why did she suddenly do that?

608
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,579
Come on, tell us.

609
00:27:53,662 --> 00:27:54,579
You two are close,

610
00:27:54,662 --> 00:27:56,412
so I'm sure you heard something.

611
00:27:56,537 --> 00:27:58,828
Did Ms Cheon do something

612
00:27:58,911 --> 00:27:59,953
for Eun Byeol?

613
00:28:00,537 --> 00:28:01,828
After seeing the practical test result,

614
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:03,078
I realised that a word from Ms Cheon

615
00:28:03,287 --> 00:28:05,370
could decide which college my kid gets in.

616
00:28:05,537 --> 00:28:07,787
Min Hyuk had always been the last,

617
00:28:07,828 --> 00:28:08,746
but he rose to the fourth.

618
00:28:08,828 --> 00:28:10,579
Need I say more on this?

619
00:28:10,662 --> 00:28:12,203
Ms Cheon's power is

620
00:28:12,287 --> 00:28:13,828
high up in the heavens...

621
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:15,828
What are you talking about?

622
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:18,245
Ro Na isn't going to quit school.

623
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,537
What?

624
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,245
Then is she putting on a show right now?

625
00:28:22,579 --> 00:28:24,579
Seo Jin isn't afraid of anything,

626
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,245
so why would she care about Ro Na?

627
00:28:27,662 --> 00:28:29,662
Doesn't it mean she's that good?

628
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:31,870
Then she should go to Seoul University.

629
00:28:33,287 --> 00:28:34,412
Mr Lee. - Yes, ma'am.

630
00:28:34,911 --> 00:28:37,287
Give them a few recommendations in grey.

631
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:38,245
Yes, ma'am.

632
00:28:38,662 --> 00:28:40,245
Grey would look better in Seo Jin's place.

633
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:50,704
Chairman Joo, you have good posture.

634
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:53,787
You've definitely done shooting before.

635
00:28:55,328 --> 00:28:56,495
Goodness.

636
00:28:58,037 --> 00:29:00,870
You're finally up, Mr Gu.

637
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:04,579
What have you done?

638
00:29:04,953 --> 00:29:06,828
Isn't this considered an abduction?

639
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:09,287
I told him to be gentle with you.

640
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:10,911
I guess he was a bit too rude.

641
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,911
Let me apologise on his behalf.

642
00:29:13,245 --> 00:29:14,495
Forget it.

643
00:29:15,162 --> 00:29:17,412
Tell me the reason why

644
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:19,412
you brought me here.

645
00:29:19,495 --> 00:29:20,746
I came across

646
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:22,995
your personnel record by chance.

647
00:29:23,412 --> 00:29:25,328
I just picked it up on the street.

648
00:29:25,746 --> 00:29:26,870
I saw that you won a medal

649
00:29:26,953 --> 00:29:28,537
during the National Sports Festival

650
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,746
in shooting.

651
00:29:29,828 --> 00:29:31,911
Naturally, we had to see you, right?

652
00:29:34,203 --> 00:29:35,120
Shoot.

653
00:29:35,537 --> 00:29:39,120
I've been interested in shooting lately.

654
00:29:39,787 --> 00:29:41,828
Could you show us a demonstration?

655
00:29:46,078 --> 00:29:48,953
Did you run a background check on me?

656
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,620
But bad news.

657
00:29:51,078 --> 00:29:52,120
It has been forever

658
00:29:52,203 --> 00:29:53,579
since I stopped shooting.

659
00:29:53,828 --> 00:29:56,120
There's a chance I might miss

660
00:29:56,495 --> 00:29:58,454
and the bullet might

661
00:29:58,537 --> 00:30:01,287
go right through Chairman Joo's head.

662
00:30:04,579 --> 00:30:05,828
Not Min Seol A's head?

663
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,746
You know who she is, don't you?

664
00:30:16,746 --> 00:30:18,078
What is this?

665
00:30:18,203 --> 00:30:19,953
Are you filming a horror movie?

666
00:30:20,037 --> 00:30:21,911
Why did you put up someone's photo there?

667
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,162
You're giving me chills.

668
00:30:23,328 --> 00:30:25,537
I'm not joking right now, so tell me.

669
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,787
Who are you?

670
00:30:26,828 --> 00:30:28,120
What's your true identity?

671
00:30:28,203 --> 00:30:29,037
I mean--

672
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:32,620
Hey.

673
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,870
You took that from my bag, right?

674
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,162
After

675
00:30:36,787 --> 00:30:38,120
you stole that phone,

676
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:39,787
I almost died

677
00:30:40,328 --> 00:30:41,620
in Chairman Joo's hands.

678
00:30:41,704 --> 00:30:43,120
I have no idea

679
00:30:43,203 --> 00:30:45,120
what kind of nonsense

680
00:30:45,203 --> 00:30:46,162
you're blabbering about--

681
00:30:46,245 --> 00:30:47,245
You little jerk.

682
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:49,746
Hey, give me her phone.

683
00:30:50,162 --> 00:30:51,787
The phone you stole from my bag,

684
00:30:52,579 --> 00:30:54,078
Min Seol A's phone.

685
00:30:54,162 --> 00:30:55,412
So who's this Min Seol A...

686
00:30:57,037 --> 00:30:57,995
Min Seol A?

687
00:30:58,454 --> 00:30:59,412
Min Seol A.

688
00:30:59,953 --> 00:31:01,495
The genius girl who got into

689
00:31:01,579 --> 00:31:03,120
Cheonga Arts High as the top of her class?

690
00:31:03,454 --> 00:31:06,203
Why are you asking me for her phone?

691
00:31:07,037 --> 00:31:08,746
What's your relationship with her?

692
00:31:10,662 --> 00:31:11,495
Did you grow up together

693
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:12,412
at Somang Children's Home?

694
00:31:13,078 --> 00:31:14,037
You forged your identity

695
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,328
to get a job at Cheonga, didn't you?

696
00:31:15,662 --> 00:31:16,662
And you put up that show

697
00:31:16,746 --> 00:31:17,995
in front of the fountain too.

698
00:31:18,078 --> 00:31:19,495
Tell me now!

699
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,078
Oh, man!

700
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:45,662
It looks like you have

701
00:31:45,828 --> 00:31:47,370
a deep misunderstanding about me.

702
00:31:48,828 --> 00:31:50,662
I hope I gave you the answer you wanted.

703
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:05,287
You jerk.

704
00:32:08,828 --> 00:32:09,787
Whoa, look.

705
00:32:10,245 --> 00:32:11,620
That's awesome.

706
00:32:13,162 --> 00:32:15,495
He shot everything except for her face.

707
00:32:16,454 --> 00:32:17,579
He seems

708
00:32:18,787 --> 00:32:20,037
oddly familiar.

709
00:32:22,704 --> 00:32:23,746
Where does he live?

710
00:32:32,704 --> 00:32:33,787
What's this smell?

711
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:34,911
That tastes great.

712
00:32:35,953 --> 00:32:37,328
Don't you know how cheonggukjang smells?

713
00:32:37,662 --> 00:32:39,662
Eun Byeol, try this lettuce wrap.

714
00:32:40,579 --> 00:32:41,662
Goodness.

715
00:32:43,787 --> 00:32:44,828
I told you to be considerate

716
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:47,037
and not let the house smell like any food.

717
00:32:47,953 --> 00:32:49,995
You're feeding this to a vocal major?

718
00:32:50,287 --> 00:32:51,328
These are all spicy,

719
00:32:51,412 --> 00:32:52,828
salty, covered in chilli powder.

720
00:32:52,911 --> 00:32:53,953
Don't be so dramatic.

721
00:32:54,037 --> 00:32:55,704
Even if she eats cheonggukjang and kimchi,

722
00:32:55,787 --> 00:32:56,787
her voice will be fine.

723
00:32:57,037 --> 00:32:58,620
Eun Byeol, eat up.

724
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:00,704
This is what a real nutritional meal is.

725
00:33:00,828 --> 00:33:02,120
Your grandma in Yeongwol

726
00:33:02,203 --> 00:33:03,454
sent these for you.

727
00:33:05,787 --> 00:33:06,620
Eun Byeol.

728
00:33:07,078 --> 00:33:08,537
Don't let the smell get you. To your room.

729
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:10,787
I'll get you some salad.

730
00:33:11,287 --> 00:33:12,787
What are you doing?

731
00:33:12,828 --> 00:33:13,828
How do you expect her to sing

732
00:33:13,911 --> 00:33:14,953
if all she eats is salad?

733
00:33:15,537 --> 00:33:16,828
Eun Byeol, didn't you hear me?

734
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:18,078
Go to your room.

735
00:33:19,704 --> 00:33:20,662
Okay.

736
00:33:24,037 --> 00:33:26,037
What do you think you're doing?

737
00:33:26,995 --> 00:33:28,620
Do you have to make it this obvious?

738
00:33:31,704 --> 00:33:32,953
What's so bad about that?

739
00:33:33,454 --> 00:33:35,537
I'm a hillbilly who wants to act like one.

740
00:33:37,787 --> 00:33:39,037
I tried to humour you all my life

741
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,828
and always ate what I never wanted,

742
00:33:40,911 --> 00:33:42,078
like cereal and bread.

743
00:33:42,828 --> 00:33:44,078
I never got to eat any stew

744
00:33:44,162 --> 00:33:45,495
or a piece of kimchi as I wanted.

745
00:33:45,911 --> 00:33:47,287
Chilli powder isn't good for your voice.

746
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:48,328
And nothing can be too salty.

747
00:33:48,412 --> 00:33:49,579
No coffee. No soft drinks.

748
00:33:49,662 --> 00:33:50,704
I put up with your awfully picky taste

749
00:33:50,787 --> 00:33:51,953
in every aspect of my life.

750
00:33:53,412 --> 00:33:54,412
We're strangers now.

751
00:33:55,245 --> 00:33:56,787
I should be able to live as I wish.

752
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:00,704
That's the more reason

753
00:34:00,787 --> 00:34:02,495
for you to live by my rules!

754
00:34:03,078 --> 00:34:04,120
It stinks.

755
00:34:04,704 --> 00:34:06,870
You can't eat this food in my home.

756
00:34:07,328 --> 00:34:08,495
If you want to eat this,

757
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:10,412
you can move back into your parents' home.

758
00:34:10,495 --> 00:34:11,495
Now that you mentioned it,

759
00:34:11,746 --> 00:34:12,704
I'm going to visit Yeongwol

760
00:34:12,787 --> 00:34:13,828
with Eun Byeol this weekend.

761
00:34:14,495 --> 00:34:16,287
My mother wants to see her.

762
00:34:17,078 --> 00:34:17,995
I did

763
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:19,537
a bit of thinking,

764
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,037
and it has been seven years

765
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,454
since I visited my parents.

766
00:34:22,662 --> 00:34:24,162
You can't take her anywhere!

767
00:34:24,245 --> 00:34:25,495
She's already sensitive enough!

768
00:34:25,828 --> 00:34:27,995
Their toilet is smelly and uncomfortable.

769
00:34:28,328 --> 00:34:30,162
Don't ruin her routine.

770
00:34:33,412 --> 00:34:35,120
I'm not your husband anymore.

771
00:34:36,037 --> 00:34:37,911
You can't tell me what to do.

772
00:34:38,495 --> 00:34:39,620
If I lived as a puppet and a slave

773
00:34:39,704 --> 00:34:40,995
for the Cheons over the last 17 years,

774
00:34:41,078 --> 00:34:42,203
that darned seven billion won

775
00:34:43,203 --> 00:34:44,911
doesn't seem too much for my alimony.

776
00:34:46,495 --> 00:34:47,828
I may not be from a good family,

777
00:34:47,911 --> 00:34:49,412
but I'm still a son-in-law who's a doctor.

778
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,078
Isn't that so?

779
00:34:53,579 --> 00:34:55,537
You're rather quick with these things.

780
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:58,328
I got Eun Byeol's appointment today.

781
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:00,412
My junior set aside some time for her.

782
00:35:00,995 --> 00:35:01,995
We'll be late.

783
00:35:03,078 --> 00:35:04,245
Her tutor will be here soon.

784
00:35:04,328 --> 00:35:05,245
How dare you take her?

785
00:35:05,328 --> 00:35:06,495
Next week is her midterm!

786
00:35:09,953 --> 00:35:10,828
Fine.

787
00:35:11,953 --> 00:35:12,870
I'll only have to put up with him

788
00:35:12,953 --> 00:35:14,162
until I'm appointed as the chief director.

789
00:35:14,828 --> 00:35:15,704
There's no need to provoke him

790
00:35:15,787 --> 00:35:16,828
before the big day.

791
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,537
Eun Byeol.

792
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,537
We're checking how much stress

793
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,495
you're under because of school,

794
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,787
so don't be afraid.

795
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:31,995
Just be honest

796
00:35:32,078 --> 00:35:33,579
about the way you feel.

797
00:35:33,828 --> 00:35:34,662
Okay?

798
00:35:34,746 --> 00:35:35,704
Don't worry.

799
00:35:35,787 --> 00:35:36,620
Some of my friends

800
00:35:36,704 --> 00:35:38,162
have also been seeing therapists.

801
00:35:38,328 --> 00:35:39,870
Good. You can do this, sweetheart.

802
00:35:46,162 --> 00:35:47,078
Go on in.

803
00:35:54,495 --> 00:35:57,620
"Psychiatrist Lee Yoon Kyung"

804
00:35:57,787 --> 00:35:59,911
My daughter is very sensitive.

805
00:36:00,037 --> 00:36:02,037
I want to know if other kids are also

806
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,245
under a lot of stress.

807
00:36:03,454 --> 00:36:05,037
You have to practise singing and study.

808
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,203
It must be hard.

809
00:36:06,704 --> 00:36:08,287
I really love to sing.

810
00:36:08,662 --> 00:36:10,370
Getting into Seoul University of Music

811
00:36:10,454 --> 00:36:11,870
isn't really my focus.

812
00:36:12,078 --> 00:36:13,162
I'm just studying hard

813
00:36:13,245 --> 00:36:14,746
because I really love singing.

814
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:16,454
Good for you.

815
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,370
During exam time,

816
00:36:18,454 --> 00:36:20,620
do you tend to lose sleep or your appetite

817
00:36:20,704 --> 00:36:22,120
because you want to do better?

818
00:36:22,203 --> 00:36:23,746
Or do you have nightmares?

819
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,370
Or any superstitions?

820
00:36:25,828 --> 00:36:26,787
You might have one or two

821
00:36:26,828 --> 00:36:28,412
because you're scared of making a mistake.

822
00:36:29,203 --> 00:36:30,245
I'm not sure.

823
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:33,245
I'm pretty laid back and calm.

824
00:36:33,412 --> 00:36:35,203
I eat and sleep well.

825
00:36:35,328 --> 00:36:36,870
I'm not stressed out about anything.

826
00:36:37,162 --> 00:36:39,328
Oh, there's a saying that I like.

827
00:36:39,495 --> 00:36:41,037
"When it's dark, turn on the light."

828
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:44,787
I try not to be negative.

829
00:36:54,704 --> 00:36:56,287
"Agreement"

830
00:36:59,245 --> 00:37:00,495
"I won't tell anyone about what happened"

831
00:37:00,579 --> 00:37:01,579
"in the community room yesterday."

832
00:37:03,162 --> 00:37:03,995
"I'll do everything"

833
00:37:04,078 --> 00:37:04,911
"Ha Eun Byeol tells me to do."

834
00:37:04,995 --> 00:37:05,828
"April 10, 2020, Bae Ro Na"

835
00:37:08,162 --> 00:37:10,370
That's why Bae Ro Na dropped out!

836
00:37:11,828 --> 00:37:13,287
What about your friends?

837
00:37:13,746 --> 00:37:15,245
Is there anyone you're not fond of?

838
00:37:15,787 --> 00:37:17,328
No, not really.

839
00:37:17,828 --> 00:37:21,245
We all have strengths and weaknesses.

840
00:37:21,537 --> 00:37:23,579
I'm not the type to hate someone

841
00:37:23,662 --> 00:37:25,203
or get jealous easily.

842
00:37:25,662 --> 00:37:27,078
And even if a friend annoys me,

843
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:29,412
I can just be more understanding.

844
00:37:29,662 --> 00:37:31,537
I don't get stressed out easily.

845
00:37:35,287 --> 00:37:36,537
Dad, it's done.

846
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,828
She asked you to come in.

847
00:37:40,287 --> 00:37:42,454
Come on, Dad. Hurry up.

848
00:37:42,537 --> 00:37:43,662
I didn't have a proper dinner,

849
00:37:43,746 --> 00:37:44,579
so I'm hungry.

850
00:37:46,287 --> 00:37:48,287
I was craving spaghetti aglio e olio.

851
00:37:55,412 --> 00:37:56,911
She seems very positive,

852
00:37:56,995 --> 00:37:59,953
cheerful, and considerate.

853
00:38:00,495 --> 00:38:01,495
But the thing is,

854
00:38:01,828 --> 00:38:02,704
it's all fake.

855
00:38:04,162 --> 00:38:05,203
"Fake"? What do you mean?

856
00:38:05,412 --> 00:38:06,787
Imposter syndrome.

857
00:38:07,662 --> 00:38:08,995
It can happen

858
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,746
when you're afraid of failure

859
00:38:10,828 --> 00:38:11,911
because you have to constantly meet

860
00:38:11,995 --> 00:38:13,495
the high expectations of those around you.

861
00:38:13,787 --> 00:38:15,828
It's a way of defending yourself against

862
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:17,995
the psychological shock from failing.

863
00:38:21,746 --> 00:38:23,287
Why aren't you eating, Dad?

864
00:38:23,828 --> 00:38:24,828
We need to finish quickly

865
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:25,828
so I can go home to study.

866
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:27,495
I want to ace all my midterm exams

867
00:38:27,579 --> 00:38:28,911
like I did on the practical test.

868
00:38:29,328 --> 00:38:31,787
I'll make Mum and Grandpa proud.

869
00:38:33,704 --> 00:38:34,662
Eun Byeol, did you

870
00:38:35,162 --> 00:38:36,704
answer honestly during your therapy?

871
00:38:37,078 --> 00:38:38,162
Yes, of course.

872
00:38:38,537 --> 00:38:39,870
Were you honest about everything?

873
00:38:40,828 --> 00:38:42,120
Yes, I was.

874
00:38:42,245 --> 00:38:43,787
What's the matter with you, Dad?

875
00:38:44,037 --> 00:38:45,787
Do you not like that I'm normal?

876
00:38:46,412 --> 00:38:48,828
Do you wish something was wrong with me?

877
00:38:57,828 --> 00:38:58,787
Then tell me.

878
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,120
What is this?

879
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:01,746
"April 10, 2020, Bae Ro Na"

880
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,537
Are you crazy?

881
00:39:05,662 --> 00:39:07,412
Why did you go through my stuff?

882
00:39:07,537 --> 00:39:08,953
Explain what this is, Eun Byeol.

883
00:39:09,287 --> 00:39:11,037
Why do you have a note written by Ro Na?

884
00:39:11,245 --> 00:39:12,370
Did you tell her to write this?

885
00:39:12,579 --> 00:39:13,828
What's this about Min Seol A?

886
00:39:13,911 --> 00:39:15,579
What happened in the community room?

887
00:39:15,704 --> 00:39:17,579
I didn't do anything wrong.

888
00:39:17,704 --> 00:39:19,162
She impersonated Min Seol A

889
00:39:19,245 --> 00:39:20,454
and threatened us.

890
00:39:20,537 --> 00:39:21,953
Still, how could you make her write this?

891
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,704
Don't tell me you used this

892
00:39:23,787 --> 00:39:25,203
to threaten Ro Na.

893
00:39:25,746 --> 00:39:26,953
Is that why she dropped out?

894
00:39:29,495 --> 00:39:30,537
Yes.

895
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,245
That's right.

896
00:39:32,911 --> 00:39:35,078
I threatened her to drop out.

897
00:39:38,328 --> 00:39:39,620
I told her I'd tell everyone

898
00:39:39,787 --> 00:39:41,370
about her mum hitting on you

899
00:39:41,454 --> 00:39:42,787
if she didn't drop out.

900
00:39:43,537 --> 00:39:44,579
What?

901
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,328
Why? I can't do that?

902
00:39:48,412 --> 00:39:50,870
I can't stand her. I hate her to death.

903
00:39:51,287 --> 00:39:52,662
I hate seeing you and Mum fight

904
00:39:52,746 --> 00:39:54,120
because of her family,

905
00:39:54,203 --> 00:39:55,911
and I don't want you to get a divorce.

906
00:39:56,537 --> 00:39:57,995
And seeing you side with that girl

907
00:39:58,078 --> 00:40:00,078
is making me lose my mind right now.

908
00:40:11,995 --> 00:40:13,828
That's why I want her dead.

909
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:17,579
I want her gone, for good.

910
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,370
Eun Byeol.

911
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:24,579
If you're that worried

912
00:40:24,662 --> 00:40:25,870
about her dropping out,

913
00:40:26,537 --> 00:40:28,287
you can live with her.

914
00:40:28,995 --> 00:40:30,078
Ditch me and Mum

915
00:40:30,162 --> 00:40:32,245
and live as Bae Ro Na's dad!

916
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:37,287
Eun Byeol. Hey, Eun Byeol!

917
00:40:51,328 --> 00:40:52,495
You're getting in just now?

918
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:53,746
It's pretty late.

919
00:40:54,495 --> 00:40:55,828
Your mum is working late,

920
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:57,495
so I came to fix you dinner.

921
00:40:58,037 --> 00:40:59,078
Thank you.

922
00:41:05,037 --> 00:41:06,203
Ro Na.

923
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,787
I heard you dropped out.

924
00:41:18,078 --> 00:41:19,162
But why

925
00:41:19,911 --> 00:41:20,995
do I keep getting a feeling

926
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:22,454
that it's not what you really want?

927
00:41:24,162 --> 00:41:25,911
Maybe I shouldn't have brought this up?

928
00:41:27,245 --> 00:41:28,537
We don't have to talk about it.

929
00:41:29,454 --> 00:41:31,120
Make sure you eat dinner.

930
00:41:31,537 --> 00:41:33,412
Your mum will be worried if you don't eat.

931
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,787
I'll be off then.

932
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,370
Ms Sim.

933
00:41:45,911 --> 00:41:46,995
Is my mum...

934
00:41:49,412 --> 00:41:50,662
an adulteress?

935
00:41:51,911 --> 00:41:52,995
What?

936
00:41:54,203 --> 00:41:56,203
I don't know who told you what,

937
00:41:56,454 --> 00:41:58,328
but you're definitely mistaken.

938
00:41:58,828 --> 00:42:01,037
Ro Na, don't you trust your mum?

939
00:42:01,203 --> 00:42:02,287
I don't know.

940
00:42:03,328 --> 00:42:05,120
I really have no idea what to believe.

941
00:42:05,328 --> 00:42:06,828
I trust your mum.

942
00:42:07,328 --> 00:42:09,162
She loves you very much.

943
00:42:10,328 --> 00:42:11,328
For you,

944
00:42:11,412 --> 00:42:13,120
there's nothing she can't do.

945
00:42:13,704 --> 00:42:15,495
And she's much stronger and wiser

946
00:42:15,579 --> 00:42:16,746
than you think she is.

947
00:42:17,245 --> 00:42:19,537
She'd never do such a thing.

948
00:42:19,911 --> 00:42:20,828
You're wrong.

949
00:42:21,746 --> 00:42:23,704
The night I slept over at your place,

950
00:42:25,078 --> 00:42:27,078
she was with Eun Byeol's dad.

951
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:28,995
I saw him

952
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:31,537
leaving our place.

953
00:42:32,828 --> 00:42:33,787
Ro Na, that was--

954
00:42:33,828 --> 00:42:35,495
Why spend time with a married man?

955
00:42:36,037 --> 00:42:37,620
And why Eun Byeol's dad, of all people?

956
00:42:38,537 --> 00:42:39,870
Because she hates Ms Cheon?

957
00:42:40,328 --> 00:42:42,495
Is it her way of getting back at Ms Cheon?

958
00:42:43,412 --> 00:42:44,828
It's so petty and shameful.

959
00:42:44,995 --> 00:42:46,245
My mum, of all people,

960
00:42:46,328 --> 00:42:47,579
shouldn't be like that.

961
00:42:48,495 --> 00:42:49,495
She always talks about

962
00:42:49,579 --> 00:42:50,787
being miserable because of Dad's affair.

963
00:42:51,078 --> 00:42:53,412
Why would she do the same thing? Why?

964
00:42:54,078 --> 00:42:55,495
Don't cry, Ro Na.

965
00:42:56,162 --> 00:42:57,328
It's not what you think.

966
00:42:57,412 --> 00:42:59,495
You're mistaken, Ro Na.

967
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:01,620
My gosh.

968
00:43:07,454 --> 00:43:08,537
"Agreement"

969
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:10,953
So? What about it?

970
00:43:11,162 --> 00:43:12,662
You don't think it's a big deal?

971
00:43:12,746 --> 00:43:14,620
Our girl did something so terrible!

972
00:43:14,828 --> 00:43:15,704
It's just a prank

973
00:43:15,787 --> 00:43:16,953
between two adolescent girls.

974
00:43:18,287 --> 00:43:19,787
Did you have to upset Eun Byeol

975
00:43:19,828 --> 00:43:21,162
over something like this?

976
00:43:21,537 --> 00:43:23,078
The exams start next week.

977
00:43:23,287 --> 00:43:25,328
The midterms aren't important now.

978
00:43:25,454 --> 00:43:27,245
This is a serious crime!

979
00:43:30,911 --> 00:43:32,828
Eun Byeol already told me everything.

980
00:43:32,953 --> 00:43:35,870
Ro Na impersonated Min Seol A

981
00:43:35,953 --> 00:43:37,704
and kept bothering the kids.

982
00:43:38,454 --> 00:43:40,662
She's confessed to it already.

983
00:43:40,995 --> 00:43:43,828
So? Are you saying this isn't wrong?

984
00:43:44,328 --> 00:43:45,662
Are you really a teacher?

985
00:43:46,662 --> 00:43:47,995
Just keep your mouth shut,

986
00:43:48,078 --> 00:43:49,704
and this won't become a problem.

987
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:00,870
Now, everything's back

988
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:04,078
where it should be.

989
00:44:05,162 --> 00:44:07,828
Both Ro Na and Yoon Hee...

990
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:11,162
We don't have to see them ever again,

991
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:13,995
so it's all over now.

992
00:44:14,454 --> 00:44:15,787
But the real problem is...

993
00:44:19,203 --> 00:44:20,828
Eun Byeol thinks there's something

994
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:22,203
going on between me and Yoon Hee.

995
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:24,328
That's why she told Ro Na to drop out--

996
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:25,662
So why get yourself

997
00:44:25,995 --> 00:44:29,370
in such a situation to begin with?

998
00:44:29,746 --> 00:44:31,245
It's your own fault.

999
00:44:31,412 --> 00:44:32,620
Seo Jin.

1000
00:44:32,704 --> 00:44:34,746
You have no right to say that to me.

1001
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:36,454
Had you not told Eun Byeol such nonsense,

1002
00:44:36,537 --> 00:44:38,078
none of this would've happened!

1003
00:44:39,203 --> 00:44:41,620
Then go tell Eun Byeol

1004
00:44:42,078 --> 00:44:43,746
that I also cheated on you.

1005
00:44:44,078 --> 00:44:46,495
With Seok Kyung's dad.

1006
00:44:46,662 --> 00:44:48,328
Shut it, you disgusting little...

1007
00:44:54,078 --> 00:44:55,746
We're divorced now,

1008
00:44:56,328 --> 00:44:58,120
which means I'm free to date

1009
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,537
or like whomever I want.

1010
00:44:59,828 --> 00:45:01,537
You have no right to hit me for that.

1011
00:45:04,078 --> 00:45:05,495
Get out of my room.

1012
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:07,078
Now!

1013
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,120
Jeez.

1014
00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:26,495
Oh, right.

1015
00:45:30,746 --> 00:45:33,328
I forgot to ask you something.

1016
00:45:36,828 --> 00:45:38,746
Isn't this your ring?

1017
00:45:45,495 --> 00:45:47,746
I found it in the bin.

1018
00:45:49,953 --> 00:45:51,746
I must've dropped it by mistake.

1019
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:55,328
You already threw this out once.

1020
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:57,037
This ruby ring.

1021
00:45:57,787 --> 00:45:59,828
The night Min Seol A died...

1022
00:46:01,662 --> 00:46:03,495
What? - I saw it.

1023
00:46:04,412 --> 00:46:06,245
I saw you chucking it in the bin.

1024
00:46:08,704 --> 00:46:10,662
So I wonder how this ruby ring

1025
00:46:10,787 --> 00:46:13,620
made its way back to you.

1026
00:46:16,787 --> 00:46:18,704
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1027
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:21,037
I think you're mistaken.

1028
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,537
Why would I chuck my ring in the bin?

1029
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:23,828
I never threw it out.

1030
00:46:24,162 --> 00:46:25,120
I bet

1031
00:46:26,328 --> 00:46:27,579
you have something to do

1032
00:46:27,662 --> 00:46:28,870
with Min Seol A's death.

1033
00:46:31,287 --> 00:46:32,620
What do you mean?

1034
00:46:32,704 --> 00:46:34,662
I stayed quiet for a reason.

1035
00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:36,870
You were my wife,

1036
00:46:37,078 --> 00:46:38,746
so I had to keep it to myself.

1037
00:46:39,704 --> 00:46:41,620
But I no longer need to do that.

1038
00:46:42,828 --> 00:46:45,870
I have no reason to protect you any more.

1039
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:49,911
Attorney Lee told me

1040
00:46:51,078 --> 00:46:52,870
that you and Joo Dan Tae

1041
00:46:53,037 --> 00:46:54,704
are the most likely suspects

1042
00:46:54,787 --> 00:46:56,746
in Min Seol A's death.

1043
00:46:58,870 --> 00:47:01,078
I heard she was blackmailing you.

1044
00:47:01,995 --> 00:47:03,078
That she'd expose

1045
00:47:03,162 --> 00:47:04,620
your affair with Joo Dan Tae!

1046
00:47:04,704 --> 00:47:05,911
What the heck are you doing now?

1047
00:47:07,328 --> 00:47:08,495
Didn't you know

1048
00:47:08,828 --> 00:47:10,162
that I'm a total jerk?

1049
00:47:10,746 --> 00:47:12,495
I dumped my girlfriend of six years

1050
00:47:13,162 --> 00:47:15,704
to marry into a rich family.

1051
00:47:16,162 --> 00:47:17,746
I'm a total scumbag who dumped

1052
00:47:17,828 --> 00:47:18,953
my girlfriend who even took care

1053
00:47:19,037 --> 00:47:20,370
of all my med school tuition fees!

1054
00:47:22,454 --> 00:47:26,412
And I'm going to be a real jerk this time.

1055
00:47:29,828 --> 00:47:31,953
So you'd better watch out.

1056
00:47:33,245 --> 00:47:34,328
Okay?

1057
00:47:52,579 --> 00:47:53,828
That coward.

1058
00:47:55,245 --> 00:47:56,704
What the heck did he see?

1059
00:48:10,787 --> 00:48:11,787
Yoon Hee.

1060
00:48:15,704 --> 00:48:16,953
I need to talk to you about something.

1061
00:48:17,911 --> 00:48:18,911
Maybe another time.

1062
00:48:18,995 --> 00:48:20,370
I'm tired.

1063
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:24,120
Eun Byeol had the wrong idea

1064
00:48:24,328 --> 00:48:25,495
about our relationship.

1065
00:48:31,287 --> 00:48:32,495
What do you mean?

1066
00:48:33,203 --> 00:48:34,203
And that's why

1067
00:48:34,787 --> 00:48:36,911
she threatened Ro Na.

1068
00:48:37,704 --> 00:48:38,662
I'm sorry.

1069
00:48:41,746 --> 00:48:42,953
Can you please elaborate?

1070
00:48:43,537 --> 00:48:44,620
What kind of wrong idea?

1071
00:48:46,203 --> 00:48:48,828
What did your daughter do to Ro Na?

1072
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:57,870
Ro Na. Ro Na!

1073
00:48:58,203 --> 00:48:59,537
She fell asleep just now.

1074
00:49:00,162 --> 00:49:01,704
I waited so I could talk to you.

1075
00:49:03,037 --> 00:49:04,328
She said she saw Dr Ha

1076
00:49:04,412 --> 00:49:06,078
leave your house that morning.

1077
00:49:06,828 --> 00:49:07,870
She also saw

1078
00:49:08,203 --> 00:49:09,953
the photos and texts on your phone.

1079
00:49:10,995 --> 00:49:11,995
I must've been out of my mind.

1080
00:49:13,162 --> 00:49:14,120
This is crazy.

1081
00:49:14,245 --> 00:49:15,828
Why didn't I delete those photos?

1082
00:49:17,328 --> 00:49:19,328
What was I thinking? It's all my fault.

1083
00:49:20,911 --> 00:49:22,495
I don't deserve to be called a mother.

1084
00:49:22,704 --> 00:49:25,287
I deserve to be punished for this.

1085
00:49:27,203 --> 00:49:29,245
I understand why she got the wrong idea.

1086
00:49:29,787 --> 00:49:31,287
Even if it's not true at all,

1087
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:33,953
it'll be hard to convince her.

1088
00:49:34,579 --> 00:49:35,662
But why

1089
00:49:36,579 --> 00:49:39,078
did Seo Jin say that to Eun Byeol?

1090
00:49:39,911 --> 00:49:42,203
What good would it do for her daughter?

1091
00:49:42,454 --> 00:49:44,537
Why make her think her dad is a cheater?

1092
00:49:44,828 --> 00:49:47,037
Probably to cover up her own wrongdoings.

1093
00:49:49,078 --> 00:49:50,287
Or...

1094
00:49:51,412 --> 00:49:52,495
Or what?

1095
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:54,953
Maybe she wanted to make Eun Byeol

1096
00:49:55,037 --> 00:49:56,037
hate Ro Na.

1097
00:49:56,995 --> 00:49:58,328
But why?

1098
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:00,412
That way, Eun Byeol

1099
00:50:00,537 --> 00:50:02,787
would get all competitive and beat Ro Na.

1100
00:50:04,746 --> 00:50:05,870
She slit your throat

1101
00:50:05,953 --> 00:50:07,620
because she was jealous of you.

1102
00:50:08,203 --> 00:50:10,412
And she's capable of doing worse things.

1103
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:13,620
You're right.

1104
00:50:14,704 --> 00:50:16,328
I had no idea.

1105
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:19,078
I got all angry at Ro Na

1106
00:50:19,162 --> 00:50:20,454
and yelled at her.

1107
00:50:22,162 --> 00:50:24,495
I feel so bad. What do I do, Soo Ryeon?

1108
00:50:25,953 --> 00:50:29,245
Ro Na went through all that by herself.

1109
00:50:29,454 --> 00:50:30,495
Just thinking about that

1110
00:50:30,579 --> 00:50:31,620
rips my heart to pieces.

1111
00:50:32,787 --> 00:50:34,120
Calm down.

1112
00:50:36,828 --> 00:50:38,037
I'm sorry too.

1113
00:50:42,662 --> 00:50:43,828
Soo Ryeon.

1114
00:50:44,287 --> 00:50:46,162
I will not let her walk all over us again.

1115
00:50:46,953 --> 00:50:48,828
I'll make Seo Jin experience

1116
00:50:49,662 --> 00:50:51,412
everything she put me through.

1117
00:51:11,911 --> 00:51:13,537
Why couldn't you just sign the letter

1118
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:14,787
at school?

1119
00:51:15,370 --> 00:51:16,662
Why make me come all the way here?

1120
00:51:17,746 --> 00:51:18,620
At school,

1121
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:20,454
there are too many eyes watching.

1122
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:23,495
And it's all over now anyway,

1123
00:51:24,370 --> 00:51:26,454
so I wanted to have dinner with you.

1124
00:51:26,746 --> 00:51:27,953
We don't have the kind of relationship

1125
00:51:28,037 --> 00:51:28,870
to have a meal together.

1126
00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:33,746
This is her withdrawal letter. Go over it.

1127
00:51:33,870 --> 00:51:35,245
Just sign at the bottom.

1128
00:51:35,537 --> 00:51:36,704
This can wait.

1129
00:51:36,828 --> 00:51:37,953
Let's talk first.

1130
00:51:39,078 --> 00:51:41,078
The recent events

1131
00:51:42,287 --> 00:51:43,662
have taught me a lot.

1132
00:51:44,203 --> 00:51:46,328
A parent's greed can completely

1133
00:51:46,412 --> 00:51:47,953
destroy a child.

1134
00:51:49,037 --> 00:51:50,828
I'm sure you've learned that by now.

1135
00:51:53,078 --> 00:51:53,995
Your misery began

1136
00:51:54,078 --> 00:51:55,203
the moment you started dreaming of

1137
00:51:55,495 --> 00:51:57,120
sending her to Cheonga Arts High School.

1138
00:51:58,828 --> 00:51:59,828
Are you

1139
00:52:00,911 --> 00:52:02,412
talking about yourself right now?

1140
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:03,953
What?

1141
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:05,828
You got your incompetent daughter

1142
00:52:05,911 --> 00:52:07,828
into Cheonga Arts High School.

1143
00:52:08,662 --> 00:52:10,245
Isn't that when your misery began?

1144
00:52:10,746 --> 00:52:12,454
You didn't want to disappoint your dad,

1145
00:52:12,579 --> 00:52:13,911
so you had to get her into the school

1146
00:52:13,995 --> 00:52:15,704
and make her become the best somehow.

1147
00:52:15,953 --> 00:52:17,828
So you bribed the judges

1148
00:52:18,828 --> 00:52:20,828
to make sure they'd give her a good score

1149
00:52:21,828 --> 00:52:22,746
and even paid someone

1150
00:52:22,953 --> 00:52:24,370
to get my daughter into an accident.

1151
00:52:24,454 --> 00:52:25,662
Have you lost your mind?

1152
00:52:26,078 --> 00:52:27,495
What are you talking about?

1153
00:52:28,078 --> 00:52:29,203
You can

1154
00:52:29,787 --> 00:52:31,746
be honest now, Seo Jin.

1155
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:36,120
I'm just reminding myself

1156
00:52:36,245 --> 00:52:37,579
of how stupid I was

1157
00:52:37,662 --> 00:52:38,704
to let you put me through all that.

1158
00:52:39,495 --> 00:52:40,953
It made me realise

1159
00:52:41,704 --> 00:52:43,287
how much power you actually have.

1160
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:47,870
But even knowing you, I didn't think

1161
00:52:48,162 --> 00:52:50,620
you'd bring that up to your daughter.

1162
00:52:51,828 --> 00:52:54,454
That I was Yoon Chul's first love

1163
00:52:55,412 --> 00:52:56,537
and that

1164
00:52:57,412 --> 00:52:58,579
he's starting to have

1165
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,162
feelings for me again.

1166
00:53:00,454 --> 00:53:01,537
What about it?

1167
00:53:01,953 --> 00:53:03,037
It's true that you two met up

1168
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:03,953
behind my back.

1169
00:53:04,162 --> 00:53:06,287
I guess you have no feelings left

1170
00:53:06,412 --> 00:53:07,828
for your husband whatsoever.

1171
00:53:08,746 --> 00:53:10,746
You just admitted that your husband

1172
00:53:10,828 --> 00:53:12,245
still isn't over me.

1173
00:53:13,078 --> 00:53:14,078
Right, I get it.

1174
00:53:14,495 --> 00:53:16,704
You're seeing someone anyway.

1175
00:53:18,412 --> 00:53:19,787
Chairman Joo Dan Tae.

1176
00:53:20,245 --> 00:53:21,412
I also think

1177
00:53:21,828 --> 00:53:23,037
he's quite attractive.

1178
00:53:23,162 --> 00:53:26,078
How dare you mention his name.

1179
00:53:26,495 --> 00:53:27,662
Do you think you're close to him

1180
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:29,245
just because you work for him?

1181
00:53:29,454 --> 00:53:31,995
Am I not allowed to mention his name?

1182
00:53:32,911 --> 00:53:34,120
He's not even yours.

1183
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:38,245
My gosh, I'm surprised.

1184
00:53:38,662 --> 00:53:39,662
Don't tell me...

1185
00:53:40,828 --> 00:53:42,620
Do you actually love him?

1186
00:53:48,245 --> 00:53:49,870
You're awfully confident for someone

1187
00:53:50,203 --> 00:53:51,454
who's seeing another woman's husband.

1188
00:53:51,662 --> 00:53:53,746
There's no reason for me to be ashamed.

1189
00:53:54,245 --> 00:53:55,328
Joo Dan Tae

1190
00:53:55,704 --> 00:53:56,828
is mine.

1191
00:53:57,328 --> 00:53:59,537
Yoon Chul and I are already divorced.

1192
00:54:00,579 --> 00:54:01,620
"Divorced"?

1193
00:54:03,370 --> 00:54:04,953
You two split up already?

1194
00:54:06,412 --> 00:54:08,870
My gosh. That means Eun Byeol

1195
00:54:09,078 --> 00:54:11,412
should get ready to meet her stepdad soon.

1196
00:54:12,787 --> 00:54:14,287
People at Hera Palace

1197
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:16,037
will be shocked when they find out.

1198
00:54:17,245 --> 00:54:18,787
What the heck is this about?

1199
00:54:19,579 --> 00:54:21,162
Everyone already knows

1200
00:54:21,245 --> 00:54:22,787
about me and Dan Tae!

1201
00:54:22,953 --> 00:54:24,704
That may be the case,

1202
00:54:26,162 --> 00:54:28,579
but there's one person who doesn't know.

1203
00:54:30,328 --> 00:54:32,787
I thought he should know,

1204
00:54:33,662 --> 00:54:34,746
so I invited him.

1205
00:54:36,162 --> 00:54:37,245
What?

1206
00:55:00,704 --> 00:55:01,828
Dad.

1207
00:55:02,579 --> 00:55:03,746
Did you hear everything?

1208
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:06,287
Your daughter, who you're so proud of,

1209
00:55:07,287 --> 00:55:09,287
has been living her life like this.

1210
00:55:10,828 --> 00:55:12,537
You did an excellent job raising her.

1211
00:55:13,412 --> 00:55:15,746
A divorcee and an adulteress.

1212
00:55:16,495 --> 00:55:17,620
Well done.

1213
00:55:19,995 --> 00:55:22,870
Dad.

1214
00:55:25,953 --> 00:55:27,579
It's not what you think.

1215
00:55:29,911 --> 00:55:32,495
I can explain everything, Dad.

1216
00:55:33,953 --> 00:55:35,287
Twenty-five years ago...

1217
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:40,370
you covered up

1218
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:42,953
your daughter's wrongdoing.

1219
00:55:43,579 --> 00:55:45,662
That's why she turned out like this.

1220
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:48,953
You knew

1221
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:50,911
everything, didn't you?

1222
00:55:53,287 --> 00:55:54,454
You knew that

1223
00:55:55,162 --> 00:55:56,828
Seo Jin was the one who slit my throat

1224
00:55:57,870 --> 00:55:59,078
with the trophy.

1225
00:56:00,579 --> 00:56:03,953
But you suspended me instead.

1226
00:56:05,287 --> 00:56:06,245
And thanks to that,

1227
00:56:07,579 --> 00:56:08,828
I was never able to graduate.

1228
00:56:10,245 --> 00:56:11,620
Why did you do that?

1229
00:56:13,579 --> 00:56:15,203
Did your daughter ask you to do it?

1230
00:56:16,828 --> 00:56:19,579
Or did you think I needed to disappear

1231
00:56:20,537 --> 00:56:22,953
for your daughter's future?

1232
00:56:26,412 --> 00:56:27,412
Oh Yoon Hee.

1233
00:56:28,828 --> 00:56:30,579
You haven't changed at all.

1234
00:56:33,828 --> 00:56:36,245
Still awfully crass and rude.

1235
00:56:37,537 --> 00:56:38,704
What do you mean?

1236
00:56:38,828 --> 00:56:41,245
I suppose you're thinking you can

1237
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:42,704
ruin my daughter's life

1238
00:56:42,787 --> 00:56:44,203
by pulling something like this,

1239
00:56:44,454 --> 00:56:45,828
but you're seriously mistaken.

1240
00:56:46,828 --> 00:56:48,370
A lowlife like you

1241
00:56:48,454 --> 00:56:50,120
can't do anything to bog my family down.

1242
00:56:50,495 --> 00:56:51,454
Do you realise that?

1243
00:56:54,787 --> 00:56:55,911
Let's go.

1244
00:56:57,953 --> 00:56:59,704
What a waste of time.

1245
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:01,828
Okay, Dad.

1246
00:57:08,746 --> 00:57:09,911
Are you surprised?

1247
00:57:10,454 --> 00:57:11,287
My dad is on my side,

1248
00:57:11,370 --> 00:57:12,454
just like he was back then.

1249
00:57:12,537 --> 00:57:14,328
There is nothing you can do.

1250
00:57:14,995 --> 00:57:15,828
You grew up without a dad,

1251
00:57:15,911 --> 00:57:16,828
so you have no idea

1252
00:57:16,911 --> 00:57:18,162
what it's like to be protected by one.

1253
00:57:54,828 --> 00:57:57,037
Dad. Dad.

1254
00:57:57,328 --> 00:57:59,412
I'm sorry I didn't tell you beforehand.

1255
00:57:59,495 --> 00:58:01,370
It's okay. I guess you and Yoon Chul

1256
00:58:01,454 --> 00:58:02,454
weren't meant to be.

1257
00:58:03,370 --> 00:58:04,746
Has the divorce been finalised?

1258
00:58:04,911 --> 00:58:07,787
Yes, you have nothing to worry about.

1259
00:58:07,870 --> 00:58:10,245
I'm going to raise Eun Byeol,

1260
00:58:10,370 --> 00:58:13,245
and we've already divided our property.

1261
00:58:13,953 --> 00:58:15,203
All right then.

1262
00:58:34,704 --> 00:58:35,662
Oh Yoon Hee.

1263
00:58:36,662 --> 00:58:38,495
Try all you want.

1264
00:58:40,704 --> 00:58:42,454
You can never beat me.

1265
00:58:52,328 --> 00:58:54,162
Hello, Attorney Park.

1266
00:58:54,370 --> 00:58:56,203
I was just about to call you.

1267
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:57,828
I need to talk to you about

1268
00:58:57,911 --> 00:58:59,620
my succession as chief director.

1269
00:59:00,162 --> 00:59:02,120
I just received a call from Mr Cheon.

1270
00:59:02,328 --> 00:59:04,537
He'd like to appoint someone else now.

1271
00:59:05,746 --> 00:59:08,287
What... What do you mean?

1272
00:59:08,412 --> 00:59:10,828
He appointed your sister for the position.

1273
00:59:11,162 --> 00:59:13,662
And he also wishes to revise his will.

1274
00:59:16,911 --> 00:59:18,078
I can't believe this.

1275
00:59:27,995 --> 00:59:31,287
"Letter of Appointment"

1276
00:59:38,662 --> 00:59:39,870
Dad.

1277
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:44,454
Is it because of what happened earlier?

1278
00:59:44,828 --> 00:59:47,287
You said it's fine. So why...

1279
00:59:48,037 --> 00:59:49,746
"Name: Cheon Seo Young"

1280
00:59:51,537 --> 00:59:54,412
How dare you humiliate me like that.

1281
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:57,203
You got a divorce and even had an affair?

1282
00:59:57,662 --> 00:59:59,037
You're a disgrace to our family.

1283
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:00,704
How dare you want Cheonga all to yourself.

1284
01:00:01,995 --> 01:00:03,495
I won't forgive you!

1285
01:00:06,537 --> 01:00:07,828
I'm sorry, Dad.

1286
01:00:08,328 --> 01:00:09,870
Please forgive me just this once.

1287
01:00:10,870 --> 01:00:12,662
You know that

1288
01:00:12,828 --> 01:00:14,828
I never once disobeyed you.

1289
01:00:15,203 --> 01:00:16,328
You wanted me to get into

1290
01:00:16,412 --> 01:00:17,662
Seoul University of Music, so I did.

1291
01:00:18,037 --> 01:00:19,537
I only slept three hours a day

1292
01:00:19,746 --> 01:00:21,662
so I could become the best.

1293
01:00:22,245 --> 01:00:23,620
I got better grades than Seo Young

1294
01:00:23,704 --> 01:00:24,828
and always outdid her.

1295
01:00:25,037 --> 01:00:26,412
You disappointed me.

1296
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:28,412
You married a man I disapproved of.

1297
01:00:28,787 --> 01:00:30,370
The least you could do was stay married.

1298
01:00:30,746 --> 01:00:31,787
It's not like

1299
01:00:31,828 --> 01:00:33,245
this is how I wanted it to turn out!

1300
01:00:33,911 --> 01:00:35,620
We're just too different,

1301
01:00:35,704 --> 01:00:37,162
and there's nothing I can do about that!

1302
01:00:39,162 --> 01:00:40,495
I never

1303
01:00:41,287 --> 01:00:43,704
felt loved by him.

1304
01:00:44,412 --> 01:00:48,704
But you know, I really did my best.

1305
01:00:48,911 --> 01:00:50,704
I didn't want to let you down,

1306
01:00:50,787 --> 01:00:52,704
so I stayed with him for 17 years.

1307
01:00:53,370 --> 01:00:54,746
You chose to marry him!

1308
01:00:54,995 --> 01:00:56,328
Don't you dare put the blame on me!

1309
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:58,787
As of this moment,

1310
01:01:00,162 --> 01:01:01,911
you're removed from the board.

1311
01:01:02,537 --> 01:01:03,746
And leave Cheonga Arts High School.

1312
01:01:03,995 --> 01:01:05,620
You'll also have to return the inheritance

1313
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:06,787
I've passed on to you.

1314
01:01:06,828 --> 01:01:07,911
Dad!

1315
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:10,662
Dad, please don't abandon me.

1316
01:01:10,828 --> 01:01:12,911
The foundation means everything to me.

1317
01:01:13,078 --> 01:01:13,911
Without Cheonga,

1318
01:01:13,995 --> 01:01:15,370
I have no reason to exist.

1319
01:01:16,495 --> 01:01:17,828
Ever since I was young,

1320
01:01:17,870 --> 01:01:19,037
you've always told me

1321
01:01:19,162 --> 01:01:20,370
that I'm the owner of Cheonga

1322
01:01:20,454 --> 01:01:21,704
and that it belongs to me.

1323
01:01:21,787 --> 01:01:22,995
You had an affair and got a divorce.

1324
01:01:23,078 --> 01:01:24,078
You have no say in this!

1325
01:01:25,162 --> 01:01:26,870
Attorney Park and I have finalised it!

1326
01:01:26,995 --> 01:01:28,495
No, Dad!

1327
01:01:28,662 --> 01:01:34,495
Dad! Dad, please! Dad, I'm sorry.

1328
01:01:34,704 --> 01:01:36,662
Please give me one more chance.

1329
01:01:36,746 --> 01:01:37,787
I promise you

1330
01:01:38,412 --> 01:01:40,704
that I'll never let you down again.

1331
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:42,245
It's over now.

1332
01:01:42,537 --> 01:01:43,620
Get off me!

1333
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:46,120
Dad...

1334
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:51,412
Dad. Dad!

1335
01:01:54,537 --> 01:01:58,412
Dad! Wait, Dad!

1336
01:01:58,495 --> 01:02:00,370
I'd rather die.

1337
01:02:00,704 --> 01:02:01,995
I can't let you leave like this!

1338
01:02:02,078 --> 01:02:03,203
You pathetic fool!

1339
01:02:03,287 --> 01:02:04,537
Just look at yourself!

1340
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:06,162
You want to be my successor

1341
01:02:06,245 --> 01:02:07,662
when you're such a weakling?

1342
01:02:07,870 --> 01:02:09,245
Not a chance!

1343
01:02:09,662 --> 01:02:11,454
Cheonga belongs to Seo Young now.

1344
01:02:12,078 --> 01:02:13,746
I've had enough of this!

1345
01:02:20,078 --> 01:02:21,662
If I've lived my life wrong,

1346
01:02:22,495 --> 01:02:24,287
it's all your fault!

1347
01:02:24,953 --> 01:02:28,370
You always compared me with Seo Young

1348
01:02:28,454 --> 01:02:29,787
and made us compete against each other.

1349
01:02:29,995 --> 01:02:31,953
You were always so hard on me!

1350
01:02:32,203 --> 01:02:35,162
You never truly loved me.

1351
01:02:35,870 --> 01:02:37,328
You used your children

1352
01:02:37,412 --> 01:02:38,953
for your own reputation!

1353
01:02:40,370 --> 01:02:41,662
I...

1354
01:02:42,662 --> 01:02:45,412
always craved to be loved.

1355
01:02:45,787 --> 01:02:48,245
That's why I had an affair.

1356
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:52,287
How dare you talk back to me.

1357
01:02:52,911 --> 01:02:56,370
You're no longer my daughter!

1358
01:02:58,911 --> 01:03:00,370
Dad!

1359
01:03:00,828 --> 01:03:03,078
No! Cheonga is mine!

1360
01:03:03,162 --> 01:03:04,911
You can't take it from me! - Let go!

1361
01:03:05,245 --> 01:03:07,454
Let go. I said, let go. - No!

1362
01:03:07,911 --> 01:03:10,537
Let go! I said, let go. - No!

1363
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:12,662
Let go! Let go...

1364
01:03:17,911 --> 01:03:19,162
Seo Jin. - Dad.

1365
01:03:19,454 --> 01:03:20,828
Seo Jin.

1366
01:03:21,746 --> 01:03:22,704
Seo Jin...

1367
01:03:40,911 --> 01:03:41,953
Dad...

1368
01:03:48,662 --> 01:03:49,495
Dad.

1369
01:03:56,746 --> 01:03:58,828
Gosh, Dad!

1370
01:03:59,662 --> 01:04:03,911
Dad. No, Dad! Dad!

1371
01:04:08,495 --> 01:04:10,120
Seo Jin.

1372
01:04:14,370 --> 01:04:15,662
Seo Jin.

1373
01:04:28,953 --> 01:04:30,162
Seo Jin.

1374
01:04:31,162 --> 01:04:32,328
Seo Jin.

1375
01:04:34,995 --> 01:04:36,287
Seo Jin...

1376
01:05:40,620 --> 01:05:42,746
You turned me into this monster, Dad.

1377
01:05:45,537 --> 01:05:47,828
So don't think that you died in vain.

1378
01:05:50,828 --> 01:05:51,828
Since you're at least

1379
01:05:54,412 --> 01:05:56,203
leaving me this one thing.

1380
01:06:26,995 --> 01:06:29,370
=Penthouse=

1381
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:30,995
Cheon Seo Jin

1382
01:06:31,078 --> 01:06:32,454
will take over the penthouse?

1383
01:06:32,537 --> 01:06:34,162
Cheon Seo Jin benefited the most.

1384
01:06:34,245 --> 01:06:35,287
The night Father passed away...

1385
01:06:35,370 --> 01:06:36,537
Did you two get a divorce?

1386
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:38,704
As if you waited for your dad to die.

1387
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:41,537
I never once opened up to you.

1388
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:43,995
Love? We can start now.

1389
01:06:44,078 --> 01:06:45,162
Did you run away from home?

1390
01:06:45,245 --> 01:06:47,203
To see what kind of man Joo Dan Tae is.

1391
01:06:47,287 --> 01:06:48,579
Why are you here?

1392
01:06:48,995 --> 01:06:50,203
How dare you set eyes on him!

1393
01:06:50,287 --> 01:06:52,162
You can't stand him cheating on you?

1394
01:06:52,245 --> 01:06:53,828
You're a mere mistress.
