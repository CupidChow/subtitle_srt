Seol A

7
00:00:53,616 --> 00:00:55,408
fell at Hera Palace.

8
00:00:58,075 --> 00:01:00,616
I... I killed her.

9
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:08,450
Yoon Hee.

10
00:01:09,116 --> 00:01:09,992
Soo Ryeon.

11
00:01:11,825 --> 00:01:12,825
You're early.

13
00:01:20,116 --> 00:01:21,116
Well, why did you

14
00:01:22,075 --> 00:01:23,116
want to meet here?

15
00:01:24,116 --> 00:01:25,700
I have something to tell you.

16
00:01:28,533 --> 00:01:29,533
To tell you the truth,

17
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:33,366
I used you all this time.

18
00:01:34,616 --> 00:01:37,116
What... What do you mean?

19
00:01:37,742 --> 00:01:38,867
The person who sent you

20
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,075
to Seol A's place in Bosong Village.

21
00:01:41,283 --> 00:01:42,283
That was me.

22
00:01:44,408 --> 00:01:45,307
And I arranged everything

23
00:01:45,332 --> 00:01:46,241
so you'd move to Hera Palace.

24
00:01:48,783 --> 00:01:50,158
I used you.

25
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,908
I really needed you...

26
00:01:54,575 --> 00:01:55,908
for my revenge.

27
00:02:02,908 --> 00:02:03,825
I am...

28
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:06,491
Seol A's mother.

29
00:02:11,575 --> 00:02:12,658
It must be shocking.

30
00:02:15,742 --> 00:02:17,491
I'm sorry that I'm only telling you now.

31
00:02:18,158 --> 00:02:20,742
I was busy looking for Seol A's killer.

32
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:24,867
And now,

33
00:02:26,283 --> 00:02:27,825
I'm ready to catch the culprit.

34
00:02:31,116 --> 00:02:32,034
The culprit?

35
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:39,091
Ro Na, what are you up to?

36
00:02:39,116 --> 00:02:40,616
It's the weekend. Let's go out...

37
00:02:41,533 --> 00:02:42,742
What are you doing?

38
00:02:42,825 --> 00:02:43,783
Stop that.

39
00:02:44,491 --> 00:02:45,491
You'll get hurt.

40
00:02:45,575 --> 00:02:46,950
You were right.

41
00:02:47,575 --> 00:02:48,408
Talent?

42
00:02:48,491 --> 00:02:50,116
That's completely useless.

43
00:02:50,616 --> 00:02:51,533
Money and connections are

44
00:02:51,616 --> 00:02:52,783
the talents I need.

45
00:02:53,158 --> 00:02:54,158
Someone like me

46
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:55,408
shouldn't have got into singing.

47
00:02:56,116 --> 00:02:58,325
So it doesn't matter if I lost my voice.

48
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:31,158
Let me go, darn it!

49
00:03:33,366 --> 00:03:34,783
Let me go!

50
00:03:36,491 --> 00:03:37,616
How did you get in here?

51
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:39,408
Seo Jin is

52
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:41,325
the beginning of my misfortune.

53
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:44,700
If anyone tries to ruin my girl's future,

54
00:03:45,283 --> 00:03:47,199
I'll kill them all.

55
00:03:51,491 --> 00:03:52,408
Yoon Hee.

56
00:03:52,491 --> 00:03:53,700
You're hurt. You need to get treated.

57
00:03:53,783 --> 00:03:54,616
Let me go!

58
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,533
I'm not leaving like this.

59
00:03:56,533 --> 00:03:57,742
I'm going to let Ro Na

60
00:03:57,825 --> 00:03:59,241
get into Cheonga Arts High.

61
00:03:59,491 --> 00:04:01,742
I can't let her live like I did!

62
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:02,783
- Yoon Hee, come here.
- Let me go!

63
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:03,825
Let go!

64
00:04:09,825 --> 00:04:10,742
Yoon Hee!

65
00:04:17,992 --> 00:04:18,950
Give it to me.

66
00:04:19,366 --> 00:04:20,950
Give me your phone!

67
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:53,658
What are you doing here?

68
00:04:53,992 --> 00:04:54,950
Ms. Oh?

69
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,199
What happened to your face?

70
00:04:58,616 --> 00:05:00,034
Did something happen?

71
00:05:01,116 --> 00:05:02,075
People at Hera Palace

72
00:05:02,116 --> 00:05:03,075
are trying to kill me.

73
00:05:03,742 --> 00:05:04,950
I'm so scared.

74
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,241
Please help me.

75
00:05:06,575 --> 00:05:07,950
Help me. I don't want to die, Ms. Oh.

76
00:05:08,867 --> 00:05:11,116
Why would anyone try to kill you?

77
00:05:14,158 --> 00:05:16,075
You're fine. No one is around.

78
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:17,992
Let's get out of here.

79
00:05:20,158 --> 00:05:21,116
You're fine.

80
00:05:21,658 --> 00:05:22,825
One second.

81
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:24,742
I need to find something.

82
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,783
I hid my phone somewhere.

83
00:05:28,075 --> 00:05:29,158
You should go first.

84
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:51,491
How dare you try to run from me?

85
00:06:26,742 --> 00:06:27,742
No, please...

86
00:06:27,825 --> 00:06:28,908
Please don't kill me.

87
00:06:30,034 --> 00:06:30,992
Die.

88
00:06:31,658 --> 00:06:32,825
Please don't kill me.

89
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:33,950
- No, please.
- Where's the phone?

90
00:06:34,742 --> 00:06:35,867
Where's your phone?

91
00:07:09,408 --> 00:07:10,908
"Beware, Risk of Falling"

92
00:07:13,075 --> 00:07:14,075
Ms. Oh?

93
00:07:17,158 --> 00:07:18,450
It was you?

94
00:07:21,075 --> 00:07:23,075
Are you the one who saved me?

95
00:07:28,116 --> 00:07:29,199
Thank you.

96
00:07:49,042 --> 00:07:50,000
If you're gone,

97
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,375
Ro Na can get in.

98
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:53,750
If you're gone for good...

99
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:12,334
Hello?

100
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,583
What? Where are you calling from?

101
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,958
Cheonga Arts High School? Okay.

102
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:24,708
What...

103
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:27,292
What did you just say?

104
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,516
We have an extra slot for Bae Ro Na

105
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,125
in the vocal music department.

106
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,334
An extra slot?

107
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:37,541
But why...

108
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,083
I mean, how?

109
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:40,625
One of the kids

110
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:42,499
who got accepted died yesterday.

111
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:48,708
Yoon Hee, are you okay?

112
00:09:58,541 --> 00:09:59,958
I'll tell you everything.

113
00:10:03,292 --> 00:10:05,416
When you witnessed Cho Sang Heon's death,

114
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:07,833
I was actually...

115
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,541
there in that house.

116
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:14,791
Cho Sang Heon?

117
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,125
Then...

118
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,958
the one who killed Cho Sang Heon was...

119
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:30,416
you?

120
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:33,750
Basically, yes.

121
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:36,958
But I don't feel guilty

122
00:10:37,499 --> 00:10:39,000
over that man's death.

123
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,416
He only got what he deserved.

124
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:46,625
Soo Ryeon, I have...

125
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:50,541
I have no idea what you're talking about.

126
00:10:54,042 --> 00:10:56,125
I let you buy the house in Bosong Village

127
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,125
for keeping your mouth shut

128
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,083
on Cho Sang Heon's death.

129
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:02,416
You need to purchase

130
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,791
Unit 501 of Building 3 by tomorrow.

131
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,375
I made you move to Min Seol A's house.

132
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:11,083
All these didn't happen by chance.

133
00:11:11,167 --> 00:11:12,458
I planned everything.

134
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:15,583
Don't you get what I'm saying?

135
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:20,541
Why?

136
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:23,708
Why?

137
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,458
Why did you do that?

138
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,125
Ever since Seol A died,

139
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:36,791
my life has been simply painful.

140
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,750
It was like a living hell everyday.

141
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:42,808
I needed to do everything I could

142
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,292
to catch her killer.

143
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,875
That's why...

144
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,583
That's why I used your feelings.

145
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:54,641
I needed you,

146
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:55,833
who despises Cheon Seo Jin.

147
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:00,499
She's involved in my daughter's death.

148
00:12:03,292 --> 00:12:04,292
Seo Jin?

149
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:05,916
It's not just her.

150
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,375
Dan Tae, Kyu Jin,

151
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:10,167
Yoon Chul, Ma Ri, Sang A,

152
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,042
and all of their children.

153
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,042
They're all accomplices in Seol A's death.

154
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:17,833
They locked her up in the mechanical room,

155
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:19,833
abandoned her body,

156
00:12:20,167 --> 00:12:21,474
then burned down her house

157
00:12:21,499 --> 00:12:23,292
to humiliate and insult her.

158
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:27,334
They all must be punished.

159
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:31,458
I'll make sure they pay

160
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,416
for everything they did to my girl.

161
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:37,750
The police will

162
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,708
begin the reinvestigation very soon.

163
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:43,666
What about the evidence?

164
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:49,083
If the culprit hasn't been caught,

165
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,416
doesn't that mean there's no evidence?

166
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,250
I saw it.

167
00:12:55,042 --> 00:12:55,916
You saw what?

168
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:01,666
I saw the person

169
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,334
who pushed Seol A off

170
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,541
from right here, on the 47th floor.

171
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:09,416
And who...

172
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:11,875
is that?

173
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:13,875
She has a ruby ring on her hand.

174
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:16,833
A red ruby ring.

175
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,208
It has to be the same ruby ring

176
00:13:19,292 --> 00:13:20,416
Seo Jin wore at the party.

177
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,458
"Logan Lee"

178
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:35,625
One second.

179
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:39,167
Is something going on?

180
00:13:41,042 --> 00:13:42,083
I'm fine.

181
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,250
I'll call you later.

182
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:29,167
She has a ruby ring on her hand.

183
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,250
A red ruby ring.

184
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,042
It wasn't a ruby ring.

185
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:38,042
It was this apple necklace.

186
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,541
I killed Seol A?

187
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:53,083
I killed someone?

188
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,167
No, no.

189
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:57,791
I never did that.

190
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:00,083
No, I couldn't have.

191
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,334
I didn't do it!

192
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:16,541
I killed Soo Ryeon's daughter?

193
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:19,499
No.

194
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,208
No. It...

195
00:15:22,292 --> 00:15:23,250
It wasn't me.

196
00:15:23,334 --> 00:15:24,541
No!

197
00:15:28,334 --> 00:15:30,083
No, it wasn't me.

198
00:15:30,167 --> 00:15:31,083
It wasn't me.

199
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:33,583
I didn't do it.

200
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,083
I didn't!

201
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,334
Everything is about to come to an end,

202
00:15:54,499 --> 00:15:55,499
my daughter.

203
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:03,458
Hello?

204
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,292
Did you have a good talk with Ms. Oh?

205
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:08,708
She got too shocked,

206
00:16:08,733 --> 00:16:10,125
so I couldn't elaborate.

207
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,416
I should've told her a bit earlier.

208
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:15,167
How much

209
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,458
do you trust her?

210
00:16:18,499 --> 00:16:19,708
What do you mean?

211
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,916
"Oh Yoon Hee"

212
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:22,833
To be honest, Ms. Oh is

213
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:24,916
one of the suspects.

214
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:26,499
There's no way.

215
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,250
She's like my little sister.

216
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:31,416
You need to be more coolheaded.

217
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,375
Ms. Oh was...

218
00:16:34,499 --> 00:16:35,791
also at Hera Palace

219
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:38,499
on the night Seol A died.

220
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,541
That's true, but--

221
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,875
Don't trust anyone but yourself,

222
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,083
not even me.

00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:02,499
Memorise the answers.

227
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You can do that much, can't you?

228
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,208
This is something only I can do.

229

Don't ever let Eun Byeol win.

230

I'll check if you've memorised it all.

You're playing the piano again?

246
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:07,375
Why did you push me?

I liked you, Ms. Oh.

who killed Seol A?

I must've been out of my mind, Soo Ryeon.

255
00:19:32,167 --> 00:19:33,583
Why did you do that to the poor girl?

256
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:34,850
You thought it'd be fine

257
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:35,708
since she's an orphan?

If someone doesn't have parents,

259
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
they can just die a wrongful death?

00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,416
How can you kill someone

261
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:40,916
just to get your girl into the school?

262
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,375
Soo Ryeon, I'm sorry.

263
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:43,750
I'm so sorry.

264

I must've been out of my mind.

All I thought about was Ro Na.

I did that before I knew it.

267
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,875
Soo Ryeon, please. I was out of my mind.

268
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:50,875
Please forgive me.

Please forgive me.

Forgive you?

273
00:19:57,042 --> 00:19:58,708
How dare you ask me to forgive you?

Your daughter deserves to die

275

No!

278
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:07,334
Not Ro Na! Please!

279
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:09,125
Kill me instead, please!

280
00:20:10,499 --> 00:20:11,499
No!

281

Die!

00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:18,625
Die!

What?

289
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:42,625
The police?

290
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,292
The police will

291
00:20:44,317 --> 00:20:46,083
begin the reinvestigation very soon.

292
00:20:55,292 --> 00:20:56,833
So where's your school?

293
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,833
I don't go to school.

294
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,292
I got kicked out.

295
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:04,000
You can't go around stealing stuff, kid.

296
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:05,666
You're a huge troublemaker.

297
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:07,875
Ro Na.

298
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:09,458
What's going on?

299
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,708
Are you okay?

300
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:11,875
Are you Bae Ro Na's mother?

301
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:13,750
Yes.

302
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
What's going on?

303
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:16,833
Why is my daughter here?

304
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:20,875
She stole beer from a convenience store.

305
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,375
It's on the CCTV footage,

306
00:21:24,042 --> 00:21:25,125
and she admitted to what she did.

307
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:26,583
Ro Na.

308
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:30,750
Did you really steal that?

309
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,167
I did.

310
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:35,916
I stole it.

311
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:37,375
They won't sell it to me,

312
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:38,334
so I had no choice but to steal it.

313
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:39,499
Are you crazy, Ro Na?

314
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:40,625
Why?

315
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:42,458
It doesn't even cost that much.

316
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:46,750
Why did you hit me?

317
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:48,125
Who do you think you are?

318
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:50,499
You don't have any right to hit me.

319
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:52,042
Like mum, like daughter, no?

320
00:21:53,042 --> 00:21:54,666
I didn't want to go home. This is great.

321
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:56,208
Get me locked up

322
00:21:56,292 --> 00:21:57,666
in the jail, the prison, or wherever else!

323
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,791
What in the world is wrong with you?

324
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:03,042
Everything is already driving me insane.

325
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,916
So what has got into you?

326
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,708
Why do you make me so worried?

327
00:22:07,334 --> 00:22:09,292
And now you're stealing things?

328
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:10,541
You're stealing now?

329
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:11,541
Are you really crazy?

330
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:12,541
Stop hitting me!

331
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:13,458
- Are you crazy?
- Ma'am.

332
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:14,416
Are you crazy?

333
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,499
- Ma'am, calm down.
- Stop hitting me!

334
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:16,583
- Calm down, ma'am.
- What's with you?

335
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:17,750
- What will you do now?
- Ma'am!

336
00:22:42,042 --> 00:22:43,125
Let me go.

337
00:22:43,916 --> 00:22:45,250
That hurts.

338
00:22:48,499 --> 00:22:49,625
Why are we here?

339
00:22:51,042 --> 00:22:51,958
It's cold.

340
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,292
I'm leaving.

341
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:56,167
You

342
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,666
don't want to make up with me, do you?

343
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:03,875
And you don't want to go back to school.

344
00:23:06,334 --> 00:23:07,499
You have no plan...

345
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:11,292
to pull yourself together

346
00:23:12,583 --> 00:23:13,666
and live a good life, right?

347
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:19,416
Do you know what I had to do

348
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:22,250
to get you into Cheonga High?

349
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:25,625
Stop using me as an excuse.

350
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,625
I've done everything I could.

351
00:23:31,416 --> 00:23:32,416
Okay.

352
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:34,250
Just quit everything.

353
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:37,791
Quit your school.

354
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:39,958
Quit singing.

355
00:23:41,167 --> 00:23:42,334
Quit everything,

356
00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:44,083
and go do whatever you want.

357
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:48,583
I don't want to live anymore.

358
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:52,499
The moment you gave up on your life,

359
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,791
my life ended as well.

360
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:57,583
I no longer have a reason to live.

361
00:23:57,666 --> 00:23:58,666
There's no reason.

362
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:05,083
I don't want to live anymore.

363
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:11,666
So you're going to kill yourself here?

364
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:14,625
How can you say that to your daughter?

365
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,334
You'll kill yourself over my theft?

366
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:19,000
Is that the only reason?

367
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,750
What do you expect me to do?

368
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,416
I hate you.

369
00:24:23,499 --> 00:24:24,791
I hate you so much.

370
00:24:25,042 --> 00:24:26,083
Can't I even do this much?

371
00:24:27,042 --> 00:24:28,167
Am I not allowed to throw a fit

372
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,250
and whine on you?

373
00:24:30,042 --> 00:24:31,458
You're my mum.

374
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:34,167
You're the only one I can rant at.

375
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,541
Can't you let me do that?

376
00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:43,375
How am I going to live

377
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:45,458
without you, Mum?

378
00:24:46,916 --> 00:24:48,833
You're the only one I've got.

379
00:24:51,708 --> 00:24:52,916
I'm sorry, Ro Na.

380
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:54,875
I'm so sorry, Ro Na.

381
00:24:57,042 --> 00:24:58,334
I try not to,

382
00:24:58,666 --> 00:25:00,458
but I get so angry when I see you.

383
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:02,250
Why did you meet Eun Byeol's dad

384
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,791
and let her say that to me?

385
00:25:04,499 --> 00:25:06,416
I'm so angry that I'm going crazy.

386
00:25:12,458 --> 00:25:13,416
Ro Na.

387
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,208
That... That was my mistake.

388
00:25:16,791 --> 00:25:18,499
But nothing like you imagine

389
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:20,042
happened on that day.

390
00:25:20,708 --> 00:25:22,000
Trust me, will you?

391
00:25:22,916 --> 00:25:23,916
You are...

392
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:27,000
You really are the only one for me, Ro Na.

393
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,875
You're the only one in my life.

394
00:25:29,167 --> 00:25:30,666
I mean it.

395
00:25:32,875 --> 00:25:34,292
I'm so sorry.

396
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,292
I'm sorry I'm not a good mum for you.

397
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:41,000
I made you suffer so much.

398
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:43,334
I'm so sorry, Ro Na.

399
00:25:46,875 --> 00:25:48,292
What's so bad about you?

400
00:25:49,416 --> 00:25:51,083
I wouldn't trade you

401
00:25:51,708 --> 00:25:52,958
for a thousand of Ms. Cheon.

402
00:25:54,458 --> 00:25:56,458
I really love how you're my mum.

403
00:25:57,458 --> 00:25:58,875
You're a nice person.

404
00:26:00,416 --> 00:26:02,583
No. No, I'm not.

405
00:26:03,167 --> 00:26:04,375
I'm sorry.

406
00:26:05,375 --> 00:26:06,334
Mum.

407
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:08,334
I'm sorry.

408
00:26:11,666 --> 00:26:13,042
I'll go back to school.

409
00:26:13,416 --> 00:26:14,750
I won't give up on singing either.

410
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:17,250
I won't let Eun Byeol win. Never.

411
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,708
I'll win that trophy at Cheonga Festival,

412
00:26:19,916 --> 00:26:21,000
and I'll get into Seoul University.

413
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:23,250
I'll become a success

414
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,541
and protect you, Mum.

415
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,250
What am I going to do?

416
00:26:31,416 --> 00:26:32,375
I made you

417
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:34,666
a daughter of a murderer.

418
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:37,625
What am I going to do, Ro Na?

419
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,250
Don't get mad even if I don't do well

420
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:05,583
on this test.

421
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,125
I might be the last place.

422
00:27:08,541 --> 00:27:09,833
Should I go with you?

423
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,167
No.

424
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,000
I can manage.

425
00:27:14,292 --> 00:27:15,541
From now on, I'm in this fight alone.

426
00:27:16,416 --> 00:27:17,292
One second.

427
00:27:19,541 --> 00:27:20,499
I'm glad

428
00:27:21,292 --> 00:27:22,708
I didn't throw away your uniform.

429
00:27:25,541 --> 00:27:26,875
You look the prettiest

430
00:27:26,958 --> 00:27:28,000
when you're in your uniform.

431
00:27:29,666 --> 00:27:30,666
See you later.

432
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:07,334
Pull yourself together, Yoon Hee.

433
00:28:09,458 --> 00:28:10,708
Nobody knows.

434
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,958
No one.

435
00:28:14,042 --> 00:28:15,167
I must brace myself

436
00:28:16,416 --> 00:28:17,541
for Ro Na's sake.

437
00:28:23,083 --> 00:28:24,000
Because...

438
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,334
I'm a mother.

439
00:28:29,292 --> 00:28:30,666
I'm Ro Na's mother.

440
00:28:50,875 --> 00:28:51,875
Hey.

441
00:28:53,125 --> 00:28:54,167
You're coming back to school?

442
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:55,499
Can you

443
00:28:56,083 --> 00:28:57,708
do me a favour?

444
00:29:13,292 --> 00:29:14,208
The necklace.

445
00:29:15,292 --> 00:29:16,208
The necklace.

446
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:36,458
"Soo Ryeon"

447
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,541
Why are you so surprised?

448
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:54,499
You're leaving early for work.

449
00:29:54,875 --> 00:29:55,875
Yes, I have

450
00:29:56,583 --> 00:29:57,958
a meeting in the morning.

451
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:03,625
Ro Na called me today saying

452
00:30:03,791 --> 00:30:05,000
she's going back to school.

453
00:30:05,167 --> 00:30:07,416
I heard things were okay with the police.

454
00:30:07,583 --> 00:30:08,625
I'm so relieved.

455
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:10,167
Yes.

456
00:30:10,416 --> 00:30:11,416
I'm a little busy.

457
00:30:11,458 --> 00:30:12,583
I'll see you later.

458
00:30:20,458 --> 00:30:21,875
Do you have some time tonight?

459
00:30:22,499 --> 00:30:23,750
I want to ask something

460
00:30:23,833 --> 00:30:25,083
about the night Seol A died.

461
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:28,042
Tonight?

462
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:31,000
I have to do overtime, so I'll be busy.

463
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:33,499
And I don't know anything,

464
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:35,083
so there's nothing I can tell you.

465
00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:38,083
I didn't live here at that time.

466
00:30:41,042 --> 00:30:42,416
I understand how confusing this is.

467
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:44,458
I'm so sorry, Yoon Hee.

468
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:46,666
But I

469
00:30:47,167 --> 00:30:49,541
must find the culprit who killed Seol A.

470
00:30:50,875 --> 00:30:53,000
I need your help desperately.

471
00:30:53,541 --> 00:30:54,916
I'll help you

472
00:30:55,375 --> 00:30:56,541
with anything you need

473
00:30:56,625 --> 00:30:57,708
to get your revenge on Seo Jin.

474
00:30:59,833 --> 00:31:00,791
My revenge?

475
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,458
Just be honest.

476
00:31:05,458 --> 00:31:06,750
You're trying to get what you want

477
00:31:06,833 --> 00:31:08,791
without getting any blood on your hands.

478
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:11,208
You knew I'd jump in and help you

479
00:31:11,292 --> 00:31:12,791
if Seo Jin was involved.

480
00:31:14,167 --> 00:31:15,375
Everything was a lie.

481
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:17,250
You pretended to help me

482
00:31:17,708 --> 00:31:18,750
and worry about me.

483
00:31:18,833 --> 00:31:20,167
You were a hypocrite!

484
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:22,125
Is that wrong?

485
00:31:23,791 --> 00:31:25,125
That's how it all began,

486
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,416
but my heart really went out for you.

487
00:31:28,499 --> 00:31:29,583
I don't want to hear this.

488
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,334
Why me?

489
00:31:31,416 --> 00:31:32,833
Why did you get me involved?

490
00:31:33,042 --> 00:31:34,583
Why did you shake my life around,

491
00:31:34,666 --> 00:31:35,791
send me to Bosong Village,

492
00:31:35,875 --> 00:31:37,499
and get me involved with Min Seol A?

493
00:31:38,334 --> 00:31:40,250
Do you have any idea how hard it was

494
00:31:40,666 --> 00:31:42,167
for Ro Na and me?

495
00:31:42,958 --> 00:31:44,042
Why did you do that?

496
00:31:44,125 --> 00:31:46,042
You're also a mum who has a daughter.

497
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:48,250
Then you could try to understand me.

498
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:50,708
The culprit is in Hera Palace.

499
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,416
So what do you expect me to do?

500
00:31:53,708 --> 00:31:55,250
I need you to testify.

501
00:31:55,334 --> 00:31:56,416
Please go to the police

502
00:31:56,499 --> 00:31:57,750
and tell them as much as you know.

503
00:31:59,458 --> 00:32:00,416
The police?

504
00:32:00,875 --> 00:32:01,791
Me?

505
00:32:03,416 --> 00:32:04,416
Why should I?

506
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:07,958
Do you know what this is?

507
00:32:09,499 --> 00:32:11,791
Seol A's ashes are in this necklace.

508
00:32:12,375 --> 00:32:13,833
My poor girl who died a miserable death

509
00:32:13,916 --> 00:32:15,167
is in here.

510
00:32:18,416 --> 00:32:19,541
Stop talking about Seol A.

511
00:32:20,208 --> 00:32:21,167
Yoon Hee.

512
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:24,499
I'm late. I have to go.

513
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,083
"Cheonga Medical Centre"

514
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:41,208
"30 Years with Our Patients"

515
00:32:44,375 --> 00:32:46,000
Goodness.

516
00:32:46,541 --> 00:32:48,042
Look at how pathetic you are.

517
00:32:48,416 --> 00:32:49,334
You got divorced

518
00:32:49,416 --> 00:32:50,833
and kicked out of your house.

519
00:32:51,167 --> 00:32:52,791
I can't believe you can still sleep.

520
00:32:53,541 --> 00:32:54,958
What brings you here so early?

521
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:56,666
Have you heard?

522
00:32:57,334 --> 00:32:59,334
Chairman Joo signed an MOU

523
00:32:59,416 --> 00:33:00,958
with Logan Lee,

524
00:33:01,167 --> 00:33:02,334
and they are

525
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:04,958
building a casino hotel in Myeong-dong.

526
00:33:05,208 --> 00:33:06,833
Isn't it good that he's doing something

527
00:33:06,916 --> 00:33:07,958
with the money that's tied up?

528
00:33:08,208 --> 00:33:10,208
Don't make it sound that easy!

529
00:33:10,708 --> 00:33:11,708
Because you took care

530
00:33:12,625 --> 00:33:14,750
of your emergency with the alimony?

531
00:33:15,334 --> 00:33:16,416
We put in

532
00:33:16,625 --> 00:33:18,541
60 billion won into that land.

533
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:19,958
How can he sign the MOU

534
00:33:20,042 --> 00:33:21,625
before he tells us anything?

535
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,833
It means he thinks we're both pushovers!

536
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:26,083
What if

537
00:33:26,666 --> 00:33:28,666
that land turns into a jackpot?

538
00:33:29,167 --> 00:33:32,541
We might not be able to take our share!

539
00:33:32,666 --> 00:33:34,833
So? What's your plan?

540
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:39,666
We need

541
00:33:39,958 --> 00:33:42,708
to assert our ownership.

542
00:33:43,499 --> 00:33:45,958
How did you become a doctor

543
00:33:46,042 --> 00:33:47,833
with such a slow brain of yours?

544
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:49,625
Shouldn't you be the most furious

545
00:33:49,708 --> 00:33:50,833
at Chairman Joo?

546
00:33:51,708 --> 00:33:54,416
It looks like you already packed up

547
00:33:54,458 --> 00:33:55,708
and resigned from the hospital.

548
00:33:55,791 --> 00:33:57,167
You need to figure out

549
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:58,625
a way to make a living from now on.

550
00:34:00,167 --> 00:34:01,416
Did you find a new hospital?

551
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:04,125
Where is it? Your hometown?

552
00:34:06,958 --> 00:34:08,916
Why should I go back to my hometown?

553
00:34:09,167 --> 00:34:11,499
I've got a lot of patients here.

554
00:34:14,292 --> 00:34:15,292
What if you don't?

555
00:34:16,541 --> 00:34:17,958
Did you forget

556
00:34:18,499 --> 00:34:20,833
the contract you signed with Seo Jin?

557
00:34:20,916 --> 00:34:22,708
You said you would take seven billion

558
00:34:22,958 --> 00:34:24,416
and leave Cheonga Medical Centre

559
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:27,083
forever, didn't you?

560
00:34:27,208 --> 00:34:28,208
No.

561
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:29,541
I've just been appointed

562
00:34:29,708 --> 00:34:31,250
as a director of Cheonga Medical Centre.

563
00:34:32,791 --> 00:34:34,208
What are you talking about?

564
00:34:34,791 --> 00:34:36,541
The day before my father-in-law passed,

565
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:38,666
he told me to take this hospital.

566
00:34:39,499 --> 00:34:40,416
So I'm moving my stuff

567
00:34:40,458 --> 00:34:41,708
in the director's office today.

568
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:44,458
I wanted to turn it down,

569
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:47,292
but it is his last wish,

570
00:34:47,708 --> 00:34:48,708
so I should do it, shouldn't I?

571
00:34:51,083 --> 00:34:52,791
Does Seo Jin know?

572
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:55,208
Not yet.

573
00:34:56,042 --> 00:34:57,000
She'll find out soon enough.

574
00:35:32,666 --> 00:35:34,375
"Question, Answer"

575
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,167
Hey, Seok Hoon. Why are you so late?

576
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,541
I thought you weren't coming.

577
00:35:45,458 --> 00:35:46,416
Come in.

578
00:35:47,334 --> 00:35:48,416
Who?

579
00:35:49,791 --> 00:35:50,958
My gosh.

580
00:35:54,875 --> 00:35:55,875
What are you doing here?

581
00:35:55,958 --> 00:35:57,958
Didn't you drop out? You're back?

582
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:59,583
Gosh, no way.

583
00:35:59,875 --> 00:36:01,375
She didn't even take the exam yesterday.

584
00:36:03,292 --> 00:36:04,292
Where's my seat?

585
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:05,499
- What?
- My gosh.

586
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:10,208
Move.

587
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:12,625
Oh, okay.

588
00:36:16,499 --> 00:36:17,625
Thanks.

589
00:36:18,625 --> 00:36:20,334
What is going on now?

590
00:36:20,791 --> 00:36:22,250
He's being openly nice to her?

591
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:23,916
Am I the only one who finds this odd?

592
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:27,833
I'm going out with Ro Na.

593
00:36:28,541 --> 00:36:31,042
So you'd better watch what you say.

594
00:36:31,208 --> 00:36:32,167
What?

595
00:36:37,916 --> 00:36:39,375
Be my boyfriend.

596
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,167
Didn't you hear me?

597
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,334
You can't be serious.

598
00:36:45,833 --> 00:36:46,791
What are you thinking?

599
00:36:46,875 --> 00:36:48,125
You said you liked me.

600
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:50,000
So let's date.

601
00:36:51,499 --> 00:36:52,833
I think it'll be fun.

602
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:55,125
Since I'm returning after I dropped out,

603
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:58,708
I want to plan a little surprise event.

604
00:37:03,833 --> 00:37:05,000
Seok Hoon.

605
00:37:06,125 --> 00:37:07,708
Have you completely lost your mind?

606
00:37:08,916 --> 00:37:11,250
What? You're going out with Ro Na?

607
00:37:12,292 --> 00:37:14,916
Anyone can tell that she's just using you.

608
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,416
As a shield to return to school.

609
00:37:16,458 --> 00:37:17,375
Don't you see that?

610
00:37:17,499 --> 00:37:18,541
I don't care.

611
00:37:19,208 --> 00:37:20,208
Whatever her reason is.

612
00:37:20,958 --> 00:37:22,708
- What?
- Everyone, be seated.

613
00:37:24,125 --> 00:37:25,458
The exam will begin in 10 minutes.

614
00:37:38,833 --> 00:37:40,083
- The call cannot be connected.
- Gosh.

615
00:37:40,167 --> 00:37:41,708
Please leave a message after the tone.

616
00:37:43,416 --> 00:37:44,458
Joo Dan Tae.

617
00:37:45,292 --> 00:37:47,292
What the heck are you thinking?

618
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:49,833
You haven't even apologised yet.

619
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:00,416
Yes.

620
00:38:00,541 --> 00:38:01,916
Why are you calling so early?

621
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,541
Did you hear the news?

622
00:38:04,083 --> 00:38:05,416
About Cheonga Foundation's

623
00:38:05,499 --> 00:38:06,833
newest appointment decision.

624
00:38:07,334 --> 00:38:09,958
If there was such news, I'd know about it.

625
00:38:12,416 --> 00:38:14,750
Ma'am, we have a problem.

626
00:38:16,416 --> 00:38:18,583
I have to go, Attorney Lee.

627
00:38:19,208 --> 00:38:20,334
Hello?

628
00:38:23,125 --> 00:38:25,042
Chief Director Cheon Myung Soo

629
00:38:25,125 --> 00:38:27,000
sure had sharp foresight.

630
00:38:27,625 --> 00:38:28,625
My gosh.

631
00:38:29,416 --> 00:38:30,916
Bae Ro Na is back.

632
00:38:31,541 --> 00:38:32,625
What did you say?

633
00:38:33,666 --> 00:38:34,791
I thought she wanted to drop out.

634
00:38:34,958 --> 00:38:37,416
She decided against it.

635
00:38:37,499 --> 00:38:38,666
She even brought a consent form

636
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:39,708
signed by her mother.

637
00:38:43,167 --> 00:38:44,875
Where is she now?

638
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:46,416
"Music Class 1"

639
00:38:57,541 --> 00:38:59,000
Ma'am.

640
00:39:05,292 --> 00:39:06,916
I'm so glad

641
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,958
that Ro Na is back.

642
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:11,916
Let's be honest.

643
00:39:12,042 --> 00:39:14,541
She's way too talented to drop out.

644
00:39:14,958 --> 00:39:16,375
She's smart, talented,

645
00:39:16,625 --> 00:39:17,499
and kind.

646
00:39:17,583 --> 00:39:18,833
She's perfect in every way,

647
00:39:19,791 --> 00:39:21,791
unlike one of the students that I know.

648
00:39:22,499 --> 00:39:23,541
She'll become

649
00:39:23,625 --> 00:39:26,250
a world-famous classical singer.

650
00:39:26,334 --> 00:39:27,958
Since when did you care so much

651
00:39:28,042 --> 00:39:28,916
about Ro Na?

652
00:39:29,208 --> 00:39:30,499
Ever since she was bullied

653
00:39:30,583 --> 00:39:31,958
by the kids at Hera Palace.

654
00:39:33,083 --> 00:39:34,042
Is that so?

655
00:39:34,125 --> 00:39:35,167
And that's why

656
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:36,416
I plan to take

657
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:38,375
extra good care of her from now on

658
00:39:39,208 --> 00:39:41,125
to protect such a talented student.

659
00:39:41,958 --> 00:39:44,375
Anyway, have a good day, ma'am.

660
00:39:44,833 --> 00:39:45,791
Wait, no.

661
00:39:45,875 --> 00:39:47,125
Our soon-to-be chief director.

662
00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:49,458
How about I just call you "Soon-to-be"?

663
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,125
Soon-to-be.

664
00:39:54,708 --> 00:39:55,833
Soon-to-be!

665
00:40:01,416 --> 00:40:02,292
"JKING Holdings"

666
00:40:02,375 --> 00:40:04,416
Seowon Bank won't let us take out a loan?

667
00:40:04,583 --> 00:40:06,292
Do they know how much our net worth is?

668
00:40:07,125 --> 00:40:09,875
I don't get it either.

669
00:40:10,125 --> 00:40:12,499
What else can we do

670
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:13,666
if we fail to get a loan?

671
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:17,791
Logan will only let you become a co-CEO

672
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,583
if you can invest the same amount.

673
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:21,875
Many companies, including Oseong Group,

674
00:40:22,499 --> 00:40:25,083
are trying to reach out to him.

675
00:40:25,666 --> 00:40:27,292
If he wants to cancel the deal

676
00:40:27,416 --> 00:40:29,583
because of the investment...

677
00:40:29,666 --> 00:40:30,791
That won't happen.

678
00:40:32,958 --> 00:40:34,375
Did you take care of it?

679
00:40:34,499 --> 00:40:35,499
Yes, sir.

680
00:40:36,875 --> 00:40:38,125
I guess it's time

681
00:40:38,208 --> 00:40:40,416
to show him the new collateral.

682
00:40:41,666 --> 00:40:42,499
Ms. Oh.

683
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:43,791
Call Logan.

684
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:45,167
I have something to show him.

685
00:40:47,833 --> 00:40:49,708
"Jakomo"

686
00:40:53,416 --> 00:40:55,167
Despite the bad economy,

687
00:40:55,292 --> 00:40:57,208
our sales went up in the last quarter,

688
00:40:57,292 --> 00:40:58,499
and we also scored high

689
00:40:58,583 --> 00:41:00,292
in customer satisfaction.

690
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:01,458
My gosh.

691
00:41:03,666 --> 00:41:04,833
Thank you all.

692
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,875
Since our products are doing very well,

693
00:41:07,083 --> 00:41:08,334
how about we use this type of leather

694
00:41:08,458 --> 00:41:10,334
to increase our profit margins?

695
00:41:10,458 --> 00:41:12,583
Our main goal isn't to sell products.

696
00:41:12,666 --> 00:41:14,833
We're a mindful company that sells value.

697
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:16,334
To keep our customers,

698
00:41:16,416 --> 00:41:17,666
we must stick to high-quality materials.

699
00:41:19,958 --> 00:41:21,334
"Hye In's caregiver"

700
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:22,583
"Hye In's caregiver"

701
00:41:24,167 --> 00:41:25,625
Is everything okay with Hye In?

702
00:41:26,042 --> 00:41:27,875
Well, apparently,

703
00:41:28,208 --> 00:41:30,208
someone registered her as dead,

704
00:41:30,292 --> 00:41:31,458
so they've put the treatment on hold.

705
00:41:31,541 --> 00:41:32,791
What's going on?

706
00:41:33,833 --> 00:41:35,125
What do you mean?

707
00:41:35,666 --> 00:41:36,958
Someone registered her as dead?

708
00:41:38,541 --> 00:41:40,042
You saw this coming.

709
00:41:40,666 --> 00:41:42,000
Registering her death

710
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,458
will secure his ownership

711
00:41:43,541 --> 00:41:44,625
over half of her land.

712
00:41:44,833 --> 00:41:46,334
We cannot let him take that land.

713
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,583
My late father left it to Hye In.

714
00:41:49,791 --> 00:41:50,875
He tried to kill her.

715
00:41:50,958 --> 00:41:52,416
How dare he covet that land.

716
00:41:52,583 --> 00:41:54,666
I just got a call from Joo Dan Tae.

717
00:41:55,875 --> 00:41:57,375
He wants to show me a land lot.

718
00:41:58,458 --> 00:42:00,541
It's probably the same one.

719
00:42:01,375 --> 00:42:02,916
He has no shame.

720
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,499
We can't put it off any longer.

721
00:42:10,458 --> 00:42:14,750
Schedule a meeting with him right away.

722
00:42:15,042 --> 00:42:16,458
Oh, Princess Je Ni!

723
00:42:16,541 --> 00:42:17,625
How did you do on your exam?

724
00:42:17,708 --> 00:42:19,125
Was the tutor spot on about the questions?

725
00:42:19,458 --> 00:42:20,875
Don't ask. I bombed it.

726
00:42:20,958 --> 00:42:22,208
Get me a new tutor.

727
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:24,541
But...

728
00:42:25,416 --> 00:42:26,499
I did better than she did.

729
00:42:26,583 --> 00:42:29,000
What? You beat Eun Byeol?

730
00:42:29,541 --> 00:42:31,042
So you got the highest mark?

731
00:42:31,125 --> 00:42:32,208
Eun Byeol, you got a perfect score

732
00:42:32,334 --> 00:42:33,167
on everything else.

733
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:34,875
She marked her answers wrong by mistake

734
00:42:34,958 --> 00:42:36,334
and totally bombed her exam.

735
00:42:36,416 --> 00:42:37,583
She got 58.

736
00:42:38,042 --> 00:42:40,416
The lowest math exam score in our class.

737
00:42:40,458 --> 00:42:41,625
What? 58?

738
00:42:42,292 --> 00:42:43,833
Eun Byeol? You got 58?

739
00:42:46,458 --> 00:42:47,791
Hey, Eun Byeol.

740
00:42:48,292 --> 00:42:49,416
My gosh.

741
00:42:49,583 --> 00:42:52,042
Ro Na came back today.

742
00:42:52,499 --> 00:42:53,541
She came back?

743
00:42:53,958 --> 00:42:55,499
You mean, Ro Na came to school?

744
00:42:55,583 --> 00:42:56,458
Are you serious?

745
00:42:56,541 --> 00:42:58,666
That's why Eun Byeol had a breakdown.

746
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:00,750
She changed her answer sheet 10 times,

747
00:43:00,833 --> 00:43:02,125
saying she made mistakes.

748
00:43:02,416 --> 00:43:03,708
Then she was rushed for time,

749
00:43:03,791 --> 00:43:05,292
so she marked the wrong ones.

750
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,833
Here's something even more shocking.

751
00:43:08,375 --> 00:43:09,416
Ro Na and Seok Hoon announced

752
00:43:09,499 --> 00:43:10,666
that they're dating.

753
00:43:10,791 --> 00:43:12,499
What? Ro Na and Seok Hoon?

754
00:43:12,875 --> 00:43:13,875
Why would he date her?

755
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:16,416
Gosh, what is going on?

756
00:43:19,499 --> 00:43:21,292
What took you so long?

757
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,416
I told you to run over here

758
00:43:23,499 --> 00:43:24,458
whenever I called.

759
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:32,208
What the heck are you thinking?

760
00:43:32,375 --> 00:43:33,541
Why are you back?

761
00:43:34,042 --> 00:43:35,042
Have you forgotten everything?

762
00:43:35,125 --> 00:43:36,916
Shall I tell the whole world that your mum

763
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,499
is an adulteress?

764
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,208
Did you just scoff?

765
00:43:42,292 --> 00:43:43,416
Yes.

766
00:43:43,708 --> 00:43:44,833
Go tell everyone.

767
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:46,167
What?

768
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:49,334
If you want everyone to know

769
00:43:49,625 --> 00:43:51,208
that your dad cheated on your mum,

770
00:43:51,458 --> 00:43:52,916
go tell people.

771
00:43:54,042 --> 00:43:55,042
What did you say?

772
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,167
Hey.

773
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:00,000
You're scared, aren't you?

774
00:44:00,416 --> 00:44:01,833
I bet you're really bothered

775
00:44:01,916 --> 00:44:03,292
by the fact that I'm back.

776
00:44:03,625 --> 00:44:05,583
That's why you marked the wrong answers.

777
00:44:09,334 --> 00:44:10,334
You got a perfect score on everything

778
00:44:10,416 --> 00:44:11,250
until yesterday.

779
00:44:11,458 --> 00:44:13,625
You need to be stronger mentally.

780
00:44:16,167 --> 00:44:17,375
What if...

781
00:44:20,833 --> 00:44:22,334
you make the same mistake on your CSAT?

782
00:44:25,458 --> 00:44:27,666
Bae Ro Na! Do you have a death wish?

783
00:44:31,541 --> 00:44:33,125
I haven't even started yet.

784
00:44:34,625 --> 00:44:35,625
Brace yourself

785
00:44:36,375 --> 00:44:37,708
for what's to come.

786
00:44:39,042 --> 00:44:40,083
Ro Na.

787
00:44:41,292 --> 00:44:42,416
Hey, Seok Hoon.

788
00:44:43,583 --> 00:44:45,416
Want to come over and study with me?

789
00:44:45,541 --> 00:44:46,750
My mum isn't home now.

790
00:44:46,958 --> 00:44:48,125
We can also have dinner together.

791
00:44:48,833 --> 00:44:49,833
Sure, sounds good.

792
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:51,833
I told him I missed him,

793
00:44:51,916 --> 00:44:52,750
and he came right away.

794
00:44:55,042 --> 00:44:56,833
Let's go. I'm hungry.

795
00:44:59,625 --> 00:45:02,000
How dare you hit on Seok Hoon!

796
00:45:02,083 --> 00:45:03,958
Are you a gold-digger just like your mum?

797
00:45:04,833 --> 00:45:06,458
Hey! Are you done?

798
00:45:07,334 --> 00:45:08,458
Eun Byeol, enough!

799
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:11,499
Why do you always take her side?

800
00:45:11,666 --> 00:45:13,208
You don't know anything!

801
00:45:13,292 --> 00:45:14,791
Why do you even like her?

802
00:45:15,458 --> 00:45:18,875
Do you not know what kind of girl she is?

803
00:45:19,208 --> 00:45:20,875
Her mum is an adulteress.

804
00:45:20,958 --> 00:45:22,416
Her mum is a disgusting homewrecker

805
00:45:22,458 --> 00:45:24,250
who destroyed my family!

806
00:45:24,334 --> 00:45:25,958
My mum is not an adulteress.

807
00:45:26,042 --> 00:45:27,208
Watch what you say!

808
00:45:27,292 --> 00:45:28,750
She seduced a married man.

809
00:45:28,833 --> 00:45:30,167
She's a gold-digger and an adulteress.

810
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:31,958
Defending her won't change that fact!

811
00:45:33,499 --> 00:45:35,666
Seok Hoon, she's far below your league.

812
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:37,458
How could you date a lowlife like her?

813
00:45:37,791 --> 00:45:39,083
Aren't you embarrassed?

814
00:45:39,334 --> 00:45:40,541
How are we different?

815
00:45:40,833 --> 00:45:42,042
We're nothing special.

816
00:45:42,125 --> 00:45:43,208
Do you realise that?

817
00:45:43,416 --> 00:45:44,833
We might even be worse.

818
00:45:45,292 --> 00:45:46,125
We act all classy

819
00:45:46,208 --> 00:45:47,042
and superior than others,

820
00:45:47,125 --> 00:45:48,583
but we're rotting inside.

821
00:45:48,666 --> 00:45:49,791
What?

822
00:45:49,875 --> 00:45:51,083
How could you compare us

823
00:45:51,167 --> 00:45:52,334
to that good-for-nothing?

824
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:53,458
Why not?

825
00:45:54,125 --> 00:45:55,375
Because your mum will be

826
00:45:55,416 --> 00:45:56,375
the chief director of the foundation

827
00:45:56,416 --> 00:45:57,708
and my dad owns a big company?

828
00:45:58,167 --> 00:45:59,583
Do you want to know the real truth?

829
00:46:04,167 --> 00:46:06,541
My dad and your mum are seeing each other.

830
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:10,000
What did you

831
00:46:11,042 --> 00:46:12,458
just say?

832
00:46:13,916 --> 00:46:15,708
They're having an affair.

833
00:46:15,791 --> 00:46:17,541
They're guilty of disgusting adultery.

834
00:46:21,458 --> 00:46:24,000
Now you know, so stop causing a scene

835
00:46:24,833 --> 00:46:26,666
before we end up humiliating ourselves.

836
00:46:48,666 --> 00:46:50,666
No. No!

837
00:46:50,833 --> 00:46:52,416
No way!

838
00:47:11,042 --> 00:47:12,167
Follow her.

839
00:47:43,208 --> 00:47:44,916
She's shopping at the department store.

840
00:47:46,083 --> 00:47:47,458
Nothing out of the ordinary, sir.

841
00:47:48,334 --> 00:47:49,916
Have someone tail her.

842
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:51,375
I want you back in the office.

843
00:47:56,958 --> 00:47:58,042
Hello, Mr. Gu.

844
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:00,167
I think I've managed to fool them.

845
00:48:01,125 --> 00:48:02,167
Okay.

846
00:48:13,875 --> 00:48:17,541
She knew everything but hid it all along?

847
00:48:20,125 --> 00:48:21,625
How long has she known about it?

848
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,958
I've booked a meeting with Logan, sir.

849
00:48:31,167 --> 00:48:32,499
We should leave now.

850
00:48:32,666 --> 00:48:33,875
Okay, thanks. Let's go.

851
00:48:40,416 --> 00:48:41,416
Are you not feeling well?

852
00:48:41,666 --> 00:48:42,583
Pardon?

853
00:48:43,375 --> 00:48:44,499
You don't look so well.

854
00:48:45,958 --> 00:48:47,292
I heard Ro Na dropped out of school.

855
00:48:47,416 --> 00:48:49,666
If you ever need my help, let me know.

856
00:48:50,625 --> 00:48:51,708
I don't think

857
00:48:52,833 --> 00:48:54,292
Seo Jin will be happy to hear

858
00:48:54,458 --> 00:48:56,167
what you just said.

859
00:48:56,334 --> 00:48:57,416
I make my own decisions.

860
00:48:58,416 --> 00:49:00,250
I decide who it is that I need

861
00:49:00,833 --> 00:49:02,416
and when to help my people.

862
00:49:02,666 --> 00:49:03,583
It's my call.

863
00:49:04,625 --> 00:49:06,958
Thank you for saying that.

864
00:49:07,916 --> 00:49:09,875
But my daughter went back to school today.

865
00:49:10,875 --> 00:49:12,708
Really? I'm happy to hear that.

866
00:49:13,666 --> 00:49:14,583
Oh, right.

867
00:49:14,916 --> 00:49:16,292
I thought about what to give you

868
00:49:16,375 --> 00:49:18,000
as a promotion gift and got you

869
00:49:18,125 --> 00:49:19,875
something that befits your new position.

870
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:21,750
A new car.

871
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:23,375
I must ensure your safety

872
00:49:23,666 --> 00:49:24,875
for the company's continued success.

873
00:49:26,083 --> 00:49:28,000
You're giving me a car?

874
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,499
It's too big of a gift.

875
00:49:32,208 --> 00:49:33,458
It's too much. I can't accept it.

876
00:49:33,541 --> 00:49:34,666
Thank you for not telling anyone...

877
00:49:37,208 --> 00:49:38,416
about what happened that day.

878
00:49:57,916 --> 00:49:59,083
So you want to invest

879
00:49:59,167 --> 00:50:00,750
with this site as collateral?

880
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:03,000
As you can see,

881
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:04,083
this prime location

882
00:50:04,208 --> 00:50:05,791
will guarantee us a big loan.

883
00:50:05,875 --> 00:50:06,791
Yes, yes.

884
00:50:06,875 --> 00:50:08,499
The location is spot on.

885
00:50:08,625 --> 00:50:10,125
I almost want it for myself.

886
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:12,583
Then as soon as we secure the loan,

887
00:50:12,666 --> 00:50:14,375
I'll set up everything and proceed

888
00:50:14,416 --> 00:50:15,916
with the co-ownership agreement.

889
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:17,292
All right.

890
00:50:17,875 --> 00:50:19,458
I like the way you handle business,

891
00:50:19,541 --> 00:50:20,750
- Mr. Joo.
- Thank you.

892
00:50:25,416 --> 00:50:26,875
It's been a while, Logan.

893
00:50:31,499 --> 00:50:32,541
What brings you here?

894
00:50:33,416 --> 00:50:35,625
This is the furniture company I run.

895
00:50:35,791 --> 00:50:37,042
Oh, really?

896
00:50:37,208 --> 00:50:38,292
I was just talking some business

897
00:50:38,375 --> 00:50:39,208
with Mr. Joo.

898
00:50:39,416 --> 00:50:40,416
He's planning to invest

899
00:50:40,458 --> 00:50:41,708
with this site as collateral.

900
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:43,499
I'll give you a tour and tell you more.

901
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,666
This way, please.

902
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,000
There seems to be some misunderstanding.

903
00:50:50,416 --> 00:50:53,292
This land belongs to my daughter.

904
00:50:54,916 --> 00:50:57,416
Unfortunately, she died a while ago.

905
00:50:57,958 --> 00:50:59,083
So she no longer owns the land.

906
00:50:59,708 --> 00:51:02,292
I am the rightful owner of this lot.

907
00:51:02,666 --> 00:51:04,125
What are you talking about, honey?

908
00:51:04,625 --> 00:51:06,250
What do you mean Hye In is dead?

909
00:51:08,042 --> 00:51:09,125
Excuse me.

910
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,083
What are you doing?

911
00:51:16,167 --> 00:51:17,292
Have you lost your mind?

912
00:51:17,416 --> 00:51:18,541
You're losing your mind.

913
00:51:19,375 --> 00:51:21,125
I clearly told you

914
00:51:21,208 --> 00:51:22,167
to wait.

915
00:51:22,958 --> 00:51:23,833
How could you go ahead

916
00:51:23,916 --> 00:51:24,791
and register her death?

917
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:26,458
She died six months ago.

918
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:27,833
I'd say we've waited long enough.

919
00:51:28,292 --> 00:51:29,958
It's not like she'll come back.

920
00:51:30,208 --> 00:51:32,791
Why postpone it and pay a fine?

921
00:51:32,875 --> 00:51:34,541
The value won't go up if it's left unused.

922
00:51:35,375 --> 00:51:37,416
I own half of this land anyway,

923
00:51:37,541 --> 00:51:38,791
so I can do whatever I want with it.

924
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,458
Did you refuse to get a divorce

925
00:51:41,833 --> 00:51:43,416
because you wanted Hye In's land?

926
00:51:44,791 --> 00:51:45,833
Or...

927
00:51:46,416 --> 00:51:47,666
is it because I'm next?

928
00:51:49,208 --> 00:51:50,167
Are you planning to kill me

929
00:51:50,416 --> 00:51:52,250
so you can take full ownership over it?

930
00:51:53,375 --> 00:51:55,042
What on earth are you talking about?

931
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:56,416
Did you think I wouldn't know

932
00:51:57,875 --> 00:51:59,583
that you killed Hye In?

933
00:52:03,292 --> 00:52:07,042
How much do you know?

934
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:10,042
What did you and Yoon Tae Ju

935
00:52:10,875 --> 00:52:12,416
scheme together before he died?

936
00:52:12,583 --> 00:52:13,583
Are you curious?

937
00:52:14,625 --> 00:52:16,125
Do you want to know?

938
00:52:21,208 --> 00:52:22,125
You can come in now.

939
00:52:35,625 --> 00:52:37,958
"Hamin Hospital"

940
00:52:48,125 --> 00:52:49,208
Joo Hye In...

941
00:52:52,292 --> 00:52:54,292
Hye In, say hi to your dad.

942
00:52:55,875 --> 00:52:56,875
Dad?

943
00:52:58,916 --> 00:53:00,292
She's saying hi.

944
00:53:01,042 --> 00:53:02,708
Aren't you happy to see her again?

945
00:53:03,708 --> 00:53:04,666
Hye In?

946
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:05,625
Thanks to the treatment,

947
00:53:05,708 --> 00:53:06,541
she's a lot better now.

948
00:53:07,292 --> 00:53:09,125
Although it took her a while to recover

949
00:53:10,791 --> 00:53:12,334
from all the sedatives they gave her

950
00:53:13,458 --> 00:53:15,292
to make her stay asleep.

951
00:53:16,125 --> 00:53:17,083
All her organs are almost

952
00:53:17,167 --> 00:53:18,042
back to normal now.

953
00:53:18,708 --> 00:53:19,875
She's learned to speak again,

954
00:53:20,125 --> 00:53:21,250
and she can even walk a little.

955
00:53:21,666 --> 00:53:23,416
Aren't you happy, honey?

956
00:53:24,708 --> 00:53:27,583
You were always so good to Hye In.

957
00:53:29,583 --> 00:53:30,666
What...

958
00:53:31,042 --> 00:53:32,125
What in the world...

959
00:53:34,541 --> 00:53:35,499
I brought her here because

960
00:53:35,583 --> 00:53:37,042
she said she had something to say to you.

961
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:39,916
Hye In, why don't you tell him yourself?

962
00:53:42,416 --> 00:53:46,666
Grandpa left this land to me as a gift.

963
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:49,499
I won't let anyone take it away from me.

964
00:53:55,458 --> 00:53:56,791
Soo Ryeon.

965
00:53:57,208 --> 00:53:58,416
How dare you lie to me

966
00:53:58,499 --> 00:54:00,000
and hide Hye In.

967
00:54:00,958 --> 00:54:02,125
Joo Dan Tae.

968
00:54:02,958 --> 00:54:03,875
I'll make you pay

969
00:54:03,958 --> 00:54:05,416
for everything you've done, one by one.

970
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,083
What in the world is going on, Mr. Joo?

971
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:09,250
Were you trying to put up

972
00:54:09,334 --> 00:54:10,416
a fake collateral?

973
00:54:10,583 --> 00:54:12,375
By claiming a living daughter was dead?

974
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,791
And this isn't even your property?

975
00:54:16,208 --> 00:54:17,791
I'm very disappointed in you.

976
00:54:17,875 --> 00:54:19,042
No, let me explain.

977
00:54:19,208 --> 00:54:20,250
Logan.

978
00:54:21,125 --> 00:54:22,292
I want you to know that

979
00:54:22,416 --> 00:54:23,541
you can't do anything with this land

980
00:54:23,666 --> 00:54:25,208
without Hye In's permission.

981
00:54:26,042 --> 00:54:27,167
I've got to go.

982
00:54:27,375 --> 00:54:28,791
She's not feeling well.

983
00:55:07,693 --> 00:55:09,447
You idiot. How could you miss that?

984
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:13,666
You darn punk.

985
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,678
You didn't keep an eye on her properly.

986
00:55:15,703 --> 00:55:17,416
What the heck have you been doing?

987
00:55:17,825 --> 00:55:18,825
How could you not know

988
00:55:18,908 --> 00:55:19,825
that Hye In was alive?

989
00:55:20,116 --> 00:55:21,408
I'm sorry, sir.

990
00:55:21,533 --> 00:55:22,491
I thought I was keeping

991
00:55:22,575 --> 00:55:23,450
a watchful eye on her.

992
00:55:23,533 --> 00:55:24,658
Shut it.

993
00:55:24,742 --> 00:55:26,075
You said she was at the department store.

994
00:55:26,199 --> 00:55:27,700
So how did she suddenly show up there?

995
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:30,283
You idiot, who were you tailing today?

996
00:55:33,116 --> 00:55:34,158
Sim Soo Ryeon.

997
00:55:34,742 --> 00:55:36,283
Enough is enough.

998
00:55:40,575 --> 00:55:42,491
Soo Ryeon has another daughter?

999
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:45,408
Who's her father then?

1000
00:55:46,241 --> 00:55:47,199
My gosh.

1001
00:55:48,616 --> 00:55:51,241
She knew where Chairman Joo was.

1002
00:55:52,491 --> 00:55:54,241
That's why she brought her daughter there.

1003
00:56:08,408 --> 00:56:09,658
Are Soo Ryeon and Logan

1004
00:56:09,683 --> 00:56:10,700
helping each other?

1005
00:56:26,658 --> 00:56:28,450
That sounded too tense.

1006
00:56:29,908 --> 00:56:31,009
When singing high notes,

1007
00:56:31,034 --> 00:56:32,533
you should breathe from your stomach.

1008
00:56:33,366 --> 00:56:34,533
Let's try again.

1009
00:56:56,867 --> 00:56:57,908
Ro Na's singing

1010
00:56:58,366 --> 00:56:59,658
that day

1011
00:57:00,158 --> 00:57:02,116
was the best I had ever heard.

1012
00:57:08,283 --> 00:57:10,783
"Soo Ryeon"

1013
00:57:17,575 --> 00:57:18,883
The call cannot be connected.

1014
00:57:18,908 --> 00:57:20,116
Please leave a message--

1015
00:57:38,116 --> 00:57:39,116
Logan.

1016
00:57:39,199 --> 00:57:41,034
Wait by the penthouse exit.

1017
00:57:41,408 --> 00:57:42,867
I'll be right there.

1018
00:57:45,199 --> 00:57:46,116
Let's talk.

1019
00:57:47,158 --> 00:57:48,158
I'm busy right now.

1020
00:57:52,241 --> 00:57:54,283
I don't care how busy you are.

1021
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:00,408
Why didn't you answer any of my calls?

1022
00:58:00,825 --> 00:58:01,800
You haven't given me

1023
00:58:01,825 --> 00:58:02,825
a proper explanation as to why

1024
00:58:03,034 --> 00:58:04,408
you were with Yoon Hee at the villa.

1025
00:58:04,533 --> 00:58:05,408
I told you...

1026
00:58:06,867 --> 00:58:07,908
I told you.

1027
00:58:08,199 --> 00:58:09,533
I went there to get some rest.

1028
00:58:10,116 --> 00:58:11,366
Then she happened to join me

1029
00:58:11,391 --> 00:58:12,411
after the team dinner.

1030
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:14,325
She was wearing my clothes.

1031
00:58:14,783 --> 00:58:16,116
The clothes that you bought for me.

1032
00:58:16,241 --> 00:58:17,158
Her clothes were ruined,

1033
00:58:17,241 --> 00:58:18,158
so she had to get changed.

1034
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:20,366
Do I have to explain everything to you?

1035
00:58:20,575 --> 00:58:22,034
Logan has finally signed the deal, right?

1036
00:58:22,325 --> 00:58:24,158
So fire her immediately.

1037
00:58:25,283 --> 00:58:26,575
Logan wants her around,

1038
00:58:27,116 --> 00:58:28,199
and so do I.

1039
00:58:30,283 --> 00:58:31,158
What?

1040
00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:32,283
Be careful.

1041
00:58:33,450 --> 00:58:34,491
There are many eyes watching.

1042
00:58:35,575 --> 00:58:36,616
Don't change the subject.

1043
00:58:37,908 --> 00:58:39,583
I don't know what you're thinking,

1044
00:58:39,608 --> 00:58:40,783
but don't forget the promise

1045
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:42,425
we made when we got back together.

1046
00:58:42,450 --> 00:58:44,491
I decide whether we keep seeing each other

1047
00:58:44,783 --> 00:58:46,450
or break up.

1048
00:58:51,777 --> 00:58:52,902
I make the call.

1049
00:59:02,825 --> 00:59:03,825
Eun Byeol.

1050
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:06,034
Eun Byeol.

1051
00:59:06,992 --> 00:59:08,116
Open the door.

1052
00:59:08,950 --> 00:59:10,491
Please? Eun Byeol.

1053
00:59:10,575 --> 00:59:11,825
What are you doing here?

1054
00:59:12,825 --> 00:59:14,533
Who let him in?

1055
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:16,283
I told you not to let him in.

1056
00:59:16,616 --> 00:59:17,825
Well, ma'am...

1057
00:59:17,992 --> 00:59:19,366
Don't yell at her.

1058
00:59:19,950 --> 00:59:21,116
She called me

1059
00:59:21,158 --> 00:59:22,533
because she was worried about Eun Byeol.

1060
00:59:23,575 --> 00:59:25,533
She won't come out of her room.

1061
00:59:25,658 --> 00:59:26,783
I heard she was throwing

1062
00:59:26,867 --> 00:59:28,075
and breaking things earlier.

1063
00:59:28,658 --> 00:59:30,950
She's angry because she bombed her exam.

1064
00:59:31,116 --> 00:59:32,616
If you're trying to use her as an excuse

1065
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:34,158
to come back, give up already.

1066
00:59:34,283 --> 00:59:36,575
I have sole legal custody of Eun Byeol.

1067
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:38,908
Even if it weren't for Eun Byeol,

1068
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:41,783
we were bound to meet again anyway.

1069
00:59:44,116 --> 00:59:45,075
Goodness.

1070
00:59:46,116 --> 00:59:48,450
Is there unfinished business between us?

1071
00:59:48,992 --> 00:59:51,116
Oh, you need to leave the hospital soon.

1072
00:59:54,783 --> 00:59:55,825
Goodness.

1073
00:59:58,700 --> 00:59:59,867
I guess you haven't heard.

1074
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:02,116
I have a new job.

1075
01:00:02,450 --> 01:00:03,408
A new job?

1076
01:00:05,116 --> 01:00:06,325
Where?

1077
01:00:06,867 --> 01:00:08,366
I'm surprised someone's still willing

1078
01:00:08,391 --> 01:00:09,325
to hire you.

1079
01:00:10,241 --> 01:00:12,950
Yes, Cheonga Medical Centre.

1080
01:00:15,825 --> 01:00:16,950
Are you kidding me?

1081
01:00:18,908 --> 01:00:19,800
I've been appointed

1082
01:00:19,825 --> 01:00:21,366
as the director of Cheonga Medical Centre.

1083
01:00:22,158 --> 01:00:25,116
I thought I should tell you myself.

1084
01:00:27,616 --> 01:00:29,158
What are you talking about?

1085
01:00:29,908 --> 01:00:31,241
I never approved such a decision.

1086
01:00:31,325 --> 01:00:32,742
How could you be appointed

1087
01:00:32,825 --> 01:00:34,158
as the new director of the hospital?

1088
01:00:35,116 --> 01:00:36,700
It's in your father's will.

1089
01:00:39,116 --> 01:00:41,825
Your approval won't be necessary.

1090
01:00:42,075 --> 01:00:42,908
"Will and Testament"

1091
01:00:42,992 --> 01:00:44,533
The day before he passed away,

1092
01:00:44,742 --> 01:00:47,199
he left Cheonga Medical Centre to me.

1093
01:00:48,034 --> 01:00:48,950
Well...

1094
01:00:49,450 --> 01:00:50,783
I had no idea back then,

1095
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:54,199
but this was Father's last wish.

1096
01:00:55,867 --> 01:00:57,658
I look forward to working with you,

1097
01:00:58,075 --> 01:00:59,908
Chief Director Cheon Seo Jin.

1098
01:01:13,325 --> 01:01:14,783
You disgusting leech.

1099
01:01:24,408 --> 01:01:26,158
What's going on, Attorney Park?

1100
01:01:26,325 --> 01:01:27,408
Why didn't you tell me

1101
01:01:27,491 --> 01:01:28,742
about the appointment of a new director?

1102
01:01:29,325 --> 01:01:30,616
Come to my office now.

1103
01:01:30,825 --> 01:01:31,992
Right now!

1104
01:01:42,241 --> 01:01:43,742
"No Caller ID"

1105
01:02:05,783 --> 01:02:09,034
Who on earth...

1106
01:02:27,575 --> 01:02:29,366
Two, three...

1107
01:02:29,450 --> 01:02:33,116
Two, one, three, two, one, three, two...

1108
01:02:33,158 --> 01:02:35,491
"April 22, Science, English"

1109
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:44,742
What are you doing?

1110
01:02:44,867 --> 01:02:46,283
Is this how you aced the exam?

1111
01:02:46,616 --> 01:02:47,491
Pretend you never saw this.

1112
01:02:47,575 --> 01:02:48,491
Dad got it for me.

1113
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:49,742
Until when will you keep this up?

1114
01:02:49,825 --> 01:02:51,325
Dad said I could do this.

1115
01:02:52,283 --> 01:02:54,325
So just mind your own business.

1116
01:02:55,450 --> 01:02:56,742
Besides, you helped me fudge my grades

1117
01:02:56,825 --> 01:02:57,950
all this time.

1118
01:02:58,034 --> 01:02:59,700
Did you suddenly grow a conscience?

1119
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:07,742
What happened to your arm?

1120
01:03:09,199 --> 01:03:10,116
Let go.

1121
01:03:12,616 --> 01:03:13,783
Did Dad do this to you?

1122
01:03:14,742 --> 01:03:17,116
Tell me. Did Dad do this?

1123
01:03:19,434 --> 01:03:20,550
I had to pay a price

1124
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:22,116
for what I got.

1125
01:03:24,658 --> 01:03:27,116
Two, one, three...

1126
01:03:27,825 --> 01:03:29,825
This isn't called a price.

1127
01:03:29,950 --> 01:03:31,491
It's violence and abuse.

1128
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:32,867
What's with you?

1129
01:03:32,950 --> 01:03:34,325
It's not like you didn't know.

1130
01:03:35,075 --> 01:03:36,408
Mind your own business!

1131
01:03:37,075 --> 01:03:39,075
I'll figure out what to do with my life.

1132
01:03:41,533 --> 01:03:42,992
You already ditched me anyway.

1133
01:03:45,616 --> 01:03:46,867
If this continues,

1134
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:48,742
Dad will end up killing us.

1135
01:03:49,116 --> 01:03:50,325
I don't care.

1136
01:03:51,366 --> 01:03:52,950
I just have to beat Eun Byeol.

1137
01:03:57,075 --> 01:03:59,116
Two, one, five, three...

1138
01:03:59,199 --> 01:04:00,783
Two, one, five, three...

1139
01:04:00,867 --> 01:04:02,199
Sim Soo Ryeon!

1140
01:04:10,199 --> 01:04:11,616
Sim Soo Ryeon, where are you?

1141
01:04:11,950 --> 01:04:13,408
Where are you?

1142
01:04:32,825 --> 01:04:33,908
Jeez.

1143
01:04:50,199 --> 01:04:51,450
Where's Joo Hye In?

1144
01:04:51,867 --> 01:04:53,116
Where are you hiding her?

1145
01:04:53,325 --> 01:04:55,075
Somewhere you'll never find.

1146
01:04:57,783 --> 01:05:00,241
You can't dare to kill her again.

1147
01:05:06,533 --> 01:05:08,616
Tell me. Where's that brat?

1148
01:05:08,908 --> 01:05:10,867
How dare you treat me like a fool.

1149
01:05:11,075 --> 01:05:12,533
You don't deserve to be called human.

1150
01:05:13,491 --> 01:05:14,533
You worthless scumbag.

1151
01:05:14,867 --> 01:05:16,116
You're a murderer.

1152
01:05:21,075 --> 01:05:22,867
That doesn't matter at all.

1153
01:05:23,241 --> 01:05:26,616
Since we know more about each other now,

1154
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:29,241
we can become a happier couple.

1155
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:30,992
You're a psycho.

1156
01:05:32,658 --> 01:05:33,700
You're...

1157
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:36,034
too classy,

1158
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:39,116
elegant, and beautiful.

1159
01:05:39,408 --> 01:05:40,825
A woman like you

1160
01:05:41,366 --> 01:05:42,867
should be punished.

1161
01:05:43,199 --> 01:05:44,700
For deceiving your husband

1162
01:05:45,075 --> 01:05:46,616
and planning to backstab him.

1163
01:05:47,241 --> 01:05:48,408
I must punish you!

1164
01:05:51,908 --> 01:05:53,533
After you're punished,

1165
01:05:53,867 --> 01:05:55,533
everything will go back

1166
01:05:55,992 --> 01:05:57,783
to where it should be.

1167
01:06:40,408 --> 01:06:42,992
=Penthouse=

1168
01:06:43,325 --> 01:06:44,450
Let's go to the US together.

1169
01:06:44,533 --> 01:06:46,450
I'll make you happy.

1170
01:06:46,533 --> 01:06:47,742
You have no reason to feel guilty.

1171
01:06:47,825 --> 01:06:50,199
I've finally found a decent partner.

1172
01:06:50,283 --> 01:06:51,366
Why don't you use me?

1173
01:06:51,533 --> 01:06:53,034
Don't trust men too much.

1174
01:06:53,116 --> 01:06:54,491
I'm not in the mood

1175
01:06:54,575 --> 01:06:55,616
to put up with your temper.

1176
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:56,616
It's beautiful.

1177
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:57,867
Expect a bloodbath.

1178
01:06:57,950 --> 01:06:59,116
Someone might die.

1179
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:00,867
They have to suffer the exact same way

1180
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:03,283
to realise their sins.
