Oh, no! I'm so sorry.

6
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:45,135
I broke your expensive teacup.

7
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:47,176
I bet it's very expensive.

8
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,802
I'm really sorry.

9
00:00:48,826 --> 00:00:50,742
It's okay.

10
00:00:55,826 --> 00:00:58,094
Your eyes look just like

11
00:00:58,118 --> 00:01:00,034
your daughter's.

12
00:01:05,575 --> 00:01:07,301
I look a lot like Seok Kyung, don't I?

13
00:01:07,325 --> 00:01:09,567
I get that often.

14
00:01:09,592 --> 00:01:10,301

16
00:01:11,324 --> 00:01:14,218
what do you have to say about my children?

17
00:01:14,242 --> 00:01:15,718
Actually,

18
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,551
Seok Hoon and Seok Kyung

19
00:01:17,575 --> 00:01:19,635
got involved in some trouble.

20
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:20,593
Some trouble?

21
00:01:20,617 --> 00:01:21,968
Did something happen at school?

22
00:01:21,992 --> 00:01:23,572
Yes.

23
00:01:24,367 --> 00:01:27,760
You live in such a fancy house,

24
00:01:27,784 --> 00:01:29,385
but you didn't do a great job

25
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:31,742
on bringing up your kids.

26
00:01:50,283 --> 00:01:51,718
People say children are

27
00:01:51,742 --> 00:01:54,052
the reflection of their parents.

28
00:01:54,076 --> 00:01:56,176
I guess you aren't such a good mother.

29
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,218
These kids who are only 17

30
00:01:59,242 --> 00:02:02,103
assaulted their classmate as a group

31
00:02:02,128 --> 00:02:03,397
and threatened him.

32
00:02:03,422 --> 00:02:04,852
The nature of their offence is very--

33
00:02:04,877 --> 00:02:06,478
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:06,867 --> 00:02:08,843
I have no excuses to make as a parent.

35
00:02:08,867 --> 00:02:10,885
I heard something like this happened

36
00:02:10,909 --> 00:02:12,052
even before

37
00:02:12,076 --> 00:02:14,094
they started going to this school.

38
00:02:14,118 --> 00:02:18,049
Was her name Min Seol A?

39
00:02:19,909 --> 00:02:22,052
I heard they bullied this girl,

40
00:02:22,076 --> 00:02:23,343
spread rumours about her on social media,

41
00:02:23,367 --> 00:02:25,700
and turned it into a huge issue.

42
00:02:29,951 --> 00:02:32,325
How's that boy they harassed?

43
00:02:32,367 --> 00:02:34,351
Is he badly hurt?

44
00:02:34,376 --> 00:02:35,343
Well,

45
00:02:35,367 --> 00:02:36,418
his physical wound doesn't hurt

46
00:02:36,443 --> 00:02:38,301
as much as the one made in his heart.

47
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,073
And he'll be scared to go to school

48
00:02:40,098 --> 00:02:41,760
along with your children.

49
00:02:41,784 --> 00:02:43,218
That's exactly why

50
00:02:43,242 --> 00:02:46,635
I'm thinking of punishing them severely.

51
00:02:46,659 --> 00:02:48,843
I'm going to put an end

52
00:02:48,867 --> 00:02:50,718
to their awful behaviours.

53
00:02:50,742 --> 00:02:52,843
You and I should discuss that.

54
00:02:52,867 --> 00:02:54,259
Goodness.

55
00:02:54,283 --> 00:02:56,802
You must be Seok Hoon's father.

56
00:02:56,826 --> 00:02:58,426
I'm Gu Ho dong, an assistant HR teacher

57
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:01,332
in Seok Hoon and Seok Kyung's class.

58
00:03:10,584 --> 00:03:12,518
You must be the new resident.

59
00:03:12,542 --> 00:03:13,601
Nice to meet you.

60
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:16,750
Hello, welcome to Hera Palace.

61
00:03:20,876 --> 00:03:22,102
Hello.

62
00:03:22,126 --> 00:03:23,018
I'm moving into the unit

63
00:03:23,042 --> 00:03:24,876
on the 45th floor.

64
00:03:25,876 --> 00:03:27,268
Oh Yoon Hee?

65
00:03:27,292 --> 00:03:29,935
I hope we get along, Seo Jin.

66
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,144
Unbelievable.

67
00:03:31,168 --> 00:03:32,852
Has this woman

68
00:03:32,876 --> 00:03:34,768
gone crazy?

69
00:03:34,792 --> 00:03:36,560
You need to make some sense

70
00:03:36,584 --> 00:03:38,435
so I can at least pretend I'm listening.

71
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:39,685
Guard!

72
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:41,643
Stop her from moving in!

73
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:44,102
I'm guessing you've misunderstood.

74
00:03:44,126 --> 00:03:45,309
Hera Palace isn't

75
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,726
a place where anyone can live in.

76
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,601
You'll need a resident to recommend--

77
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,518
Do you mean...

78
00:03:52,542 --> 00:03:54,034
this?

79
00:03:56,667 --> 00:03:57,726
"Hera Palace"

80
00:03:57,751 --> 00:03:59,380
"Recommendation Card"

81
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,103
"Recommended by Joo Dan Tae"

82
00:04:02,128 --> 00:04:04,643
"Recommended by Joo Dan Tae"?

83
00:04:04,667 --> 00:04:07,084
Do you finally understand

84
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,144
what's going on?

85
00:04:08,168 --> 00:04:11,518
Does Chairman Joo have dementia?

86
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,018
Doesn't he know what she's like?

87
00:04:13,042 --> 00:04:15,144
How can he let her live in Hera Palace?

88
00:04:15,168 --> 00:04:17,601
Does this mean I have to spend my days

89
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:20,018
having this vulgar woman right next door?

90
00:04:20,042 --> 00:04:22,250
Call Chairman Joo right now.

91
00:04:22,417 --> 00:04:23,852
I will not trust anything

92
00:04:23,876 --> 00:04:25,726
before I check this myself.

93
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,834
And until I do that...

94
00:04:30,168 --> 00:04:33,375
you will not move an inch from here.

95
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,250
Take a look.

96
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,685
Are you bribing me?

97
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:48,685
That depends on how you take it.

98
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:50,518
It could turn into a bribe

99
00:04:50,542 --> 00:04:52,185
or a token of our friendship.

100
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:54,226
Are you telling me to take this

101
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,250
and cover up your children's violence?

102
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:02,144
What if I won't?

103
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:04,042
Yes.

104
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,144
You will.

105
00:05:06,168 --> 00:05:07,810
If you wanted to bring justice,

106
00:05:07,834 --> 00:05:10,209
you'd be at the district school board now.

107
00:05:11,584 --> 00:05:13,643
Instead of this penthouse.

108
00:05:13,667 --> 00:05:16,667
Isn't that so, Mr Gu?

109
00:05:32,042 --> 00:05:34,001
Wow.

110
00:05:35,542 --> 00:05:37,542
Bravo.

111
00:05:40,584 --> 00:05:44,018
You're a man of great insight.

112
00:05:44,042 --> 00:05:45,393
Experts like us don't need

113
00:05:45,417 --> 00:05:47,102
a long explanation, right?

114
00:05:47,126 --> 00:05:50,893
I knew we'd speak the same language.

115
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:53,351
Let me erase that video myself.

116
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,060
Of course, you should.

117
00:05:55,084 --> 00:05:57,542
You know how to wrap things up.

118
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,834
Here.

119
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:02,810
There aren't many people

120
00:06:02,834 --> 00:06:05,667
who are bold enough to betray me

121
00:06:06,209 --> 00:06:07,144
after taking my money.

122
00:06:07,168 --> 00:06:09,309
Of course, I'm aware.

123
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,018
I understand. I get what you're saying.

124
00:06:11,042 --> 00:06:12,959
I'm an investor.

125
00:06:13,126 --> 00:06:14,518
My job is to invest only in the things

126
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:16,393
that are of value.

127
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:19,560
I'll see if you'll end up holding me back

128
00:06:19,584 --> 00:06:22,144
or dragging me down.

129
00:06:22,168 --> 00:06:23,393
We'll find out in time.

130
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:25,792
Or grabbing you in the neck.

131
00:06:27,542 --> 00:06:30,250
I'm just joking.

132
00:06:35,667 --> 00:06:37,518
Hello? - Come on down.

133
00:06:37,542 --> 00:06:39,226
We need you here in a hurry.

134
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,768
Things hit the fan down here.

135
00:06:40,792 --> 00:06:42,667
All right.

136
00:06:43,292 --> 00:06:45,351
This is...

137
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:46,518
Is this real?

138
00:06:46,542 --> 00:06:47,935
You bought a unit in Hera Palace?

139
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:50,226
Is this recommendation card legit?

140
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,435
Wait,

141
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:52,935
are you suggesting

142
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:54,977
I forged the recommendation or what?

143
00:06:55,001 --> 00:06:56,893
Hey, if she forged a private document,

144
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,226
we should call the police on her.

145
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,560
Hey, I'm the same human like you.

146
00:07:01,584 --> 00:07:03,309
I paid using my own money

147
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:05,309
to legitimately buy a unit here.

148
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,810
Why are you getting psychotic like this

149
00:07:06,834 --> 00:07:08,393
and divide people into different classes?

150
00:07:08,417 --> 00:07:09,476
You're so shallow.

151
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,393
Psychotic? Shallow? - Goodness.

152
00:07:11,417 --> 00:07:13,435
Would you believe this?

153
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:14,768
There's no way Chairman Joo would

154
00:07:14,792 --> 00:07:15,810
give you a recommendation--

155
00:07:15,834 --> 00:07:17,185
I did.

156
00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:19,126
I signed that.

157
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,417
So this is true?

158
00:07:31,042 --> 00:07:31,977
I'm not sure

159
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:33,643
what I should demand as my condition.

160
00:07:33,667 --> 00:07:36,042
There's something I thought of.

161
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,018
It's a condition that's necessary

162
00:07:38,042 --> 00:07:39,685
for both you

163
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,268
and me.

164
00:07:41,292 --> 00:07:43,333
What is it?

165
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:46,226
Tell him you'll move into Hera Palace.

166
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,417
Into Hera Palace?

167
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:51,542
What are you talking about, Soo Ryeon?

168
00:07:54,459 --> 00:07:56,185
Hera Palace?

169
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,102
Did I just hear that correctly?

170
00:07:58,126 --> 00:08:00,476
I won't mind even if you turn it down.

171
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,292
Give me a call if you change your mind.

172
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:06,435
Hera Palace isn't

173
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:09,917
a place where anybody can live in, Ms Oh.

174
00:08:10,876 --> 00:08:11,810
I've heard,

175
00:08:11,834 --> 00:08:13,309
so I'm well aware of that.

176
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:14,476
I heard you need a recommendation

177
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,393
and an agreement from the residents.

178
00:08:16,417 --> 00:08:18,102
However,

179
00:08:18,126 --> 00:08:19,768
with your recommendation,

180
00:08:19,792 --> 00:08:22,709
anyone can move in unconditionally.

181
00:08:24,417 --> 00:08:27,018
As soon as I get a unit in Hera Palace,

182
00:08:27,042 --> 00:08:30,500
I'll hand over that house in Myeong-dong.

183
00:08:31,084 --> 00:08:32,726
She met all of our requirements,

184
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,560
so I gave her my recommendation.

185
00:08:34,584 --> 00:08:36,226
Do I have to explain everything?

186
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,226
Our kids go to the same school,

187
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,768
and it'd be a great connection.

188
00:08:38,792 --> 00:08:40,185
I hope we could all get along.

189
00:08:40,209 --> 00:08:42,268
Good connection? - What?

190
00:08:42,292 --> 00:08:44,518
What is this rubbish?

191
00:08:44,542 --> 00:08:46,102
Chairman Joo.

192
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:49,351
Are you determined to ruin Hera for good?

193
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,185
Did you know about this?

194
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:52,185
Honey, really?

195
00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:53,768
No way.

196
00:08:53,792 --> 00:08:56,560
This is a peremptory decision he made.

197
00:08:56,584 --> 00:08:58,435
Not me. I'm falsely blamed.

198
00:08:58,459 --> 00:09:00,643
This is too much.

199
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:04,959
You should've given a hint to me.

200
00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:08,810
Then may I continue with my moving in?

201
00:09:08,834 --> 00:09:10,144
I have a lot of furniture

202
00:09:10,168 --> 00:09:11,810
and home appliances to bring in.

203
00:09:11,834 --> 00:09:15,959
I hope we could all get along, neighbours.

204
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,250
Will you please move aside?

205
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,309
How can you let her in here

206
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,102
without a word to me?

207
00:09:32,126 --> 00:09:34,268
You know very well how much I loathe her,

208
00:09:34,292 --> 00:09:35,483
yet you betrayed me like this?

209
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:36,596
How?

210
00:09:36,621 --> 00:09:38,226
Calm down.

211
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,893
How can I calm down?

212
00:09:39,917 --> 00:09:40,935
You should've stopped her

213
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,959
in any way you could!

214
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,018
Do you think I wanted to do this?

215
00:09:46,042 --> 00:09:47,144
Our business was involved in this,

216
00:09:47,168 --> 00:09:49,292
so I had no other choice.

217
00:09:51,917 --> 00:09:53,144
Go talk to your husband

218
00:09:53,168 --> 00:09:55,226
if you want to nit-pick over this.

219
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,893
Ha Yoon Chul is the number one contributor

220
00:09:56,917 --> 00:09:59,292
in letting Oh Yoon Hee move in.

221
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:01,268
What?

222
00:10:01,292 --> 00:10:03,250
Your husband

223
00:10:03,417 --> 00:10:07,042
seems to care an awful lot about her.

224
00:10:07,542 --> 00:10:09,601
They're much more than friends,

225
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:10,977
aren't they?

226
00:10:11,001 --> 00:10:14,250
You'd better explain everything right now.

227
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:17,250
Say it so that I can understand.

228
00:10:26,052 --> 00:10:27,538
"Hera Palace"

229
00:10:28,168 --> 00:10:29,268
What is this?

230
00:10:29,292 --> 00:10:31,268
Are you visiting Seok Kyung's place again?

231
00:10:31,292 --> 00:10:32,170
Why do Seok Kyung and Seok Hoon

232
00:10:32,195 --> 00:10:33,257
keep hanging out with this girl?

233
00:10:33,282 --> 00:10:35,060
She's way out of our league.

234
00:10:35,084 --> 00:10:37,643
This elevator is for residents only.

235
00:10:37,667 --> 00:10:39,113
The one for maids is back there.

236
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,726
So get lost.

237
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,144
I'm on my way home right now.

238
00:10:42,168 --> 00:10:44,876
What are you saying? Your home?

239
00:10:46,417 --> 00:10:48,834
The door is open.

240
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,333
Move aside.

241
00:11:11,184 --> 00:11:12,826
Mum.

242
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,993
Mum.

243
00:11:15,017 --> 00:11:17,451
Ro Na went into the house across the hall.

244
00:11:17,475 --> 00:11:18,618
Is this a prank?

245
00:11:18,642 --> 00:11:19,701
It must be a dream.

246
00:11:19,725 --> 00:11:21,409
Or I must be possessed by a ghost.

247
00:11:21,433 --> 00:11:22,493
Be quiet.

248
00:11:22,517 --> 00:11:23,826
Stay quiet.

249
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,451
I'm doing some thinking for once.

250
00:11:25,475 --> 00:11:29,238
Is it true that she moved into that house?

251
00:11:29,263 --> 00:11:32,139
Yes, that's a good idea!

252
00:11:35,739 --> 00:11:37,656
My gosh.

253
00:11:43,584 --> 00:11:45,625
Wow.

254
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,001
Everything is so pretty!

255
00:11:56,834 --> 00:11:58,102
Mum.

256
00:11:58,126 --> 00:11:59,893
Is this really our home?

257
00:11:59,917 --> 00:12:01,018
Are we really going to live

258
00:12:01,042 --> 00:12:02,268
in Hera Palace starting today?

259
00:12:02,292 --> 00:12:05,351
And all the furniture is ours too?

260
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,435
Yes, this is our home.

261
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:08,351
Do you want to see your room?

262
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:09,852
Yes, where is it?

263
00:12:09,876 --> 00:12:10,852
One second.

264
00:12:10,876 --> 00:12:12,226
Let me cover your eyes.

265
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,750
What are you doing? - This way, please.

266
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,801
Ta-da.

267
00:12:23,126 --> 00:12:25,435
Mum, these are all mine?

268
00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:26,393
The bed, the desk,

269
00:12:26,417 --> 00:12:28,584
and everything else is so pretty.

270
00:12:28,709 --> 00:12:29,810
Mum.

271
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:30,810
This isn't a dream, is it?

272
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:31,893
Can you pinch me?

273
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,852
It's not a dream.

274
00:12:33,876 --> 00:12:35,792
Ouch.

275
00:12:36,834 --> 00:12:38,917
I can't believe this!

276
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,144
This is awesome.

277
00:12:42,168 --> 00:12:44,168
This is wonderful.

278
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,393
What's this?

279
00:12:47,417 --> 00:12:49,309
It's a present from Ms Sim.

280
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,333
Go on and take a look.

281
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,226
A piano?

282
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,209
Do you like it?

283
00:13:00,417 --> 00:13:01,726
I was wondering what I should get

284
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,726
as your housewarming gift,

285
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,935
and decided to give you a piano.

286
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,476
I hope you become a wonderful singer.

287
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,726
Thank you, Ms Sim.

288
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,959
I absolutely love it.

289
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,977
My life's wish had been

290
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:16,102
getting a piano of my own.

291
00:13:16,126 --> 00:13:18,852
I promise I'll practise like crazy.

292
00:13:18,876 --> 00:13:21,500
I love it so much.

293
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:23,584
Go on and take a look.

294
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,144
Seol A.

295
00:14:04,168 --> 00:14:07,001
I'm so happy to see you smile,

296
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,667
my beautiful daughter.

297
00:14:24,084 --> 00:14:25,852
I thought you'd be busy moving in,

298
00:14:25,876 --> 00:14:28,226
so I brought you some food.

299
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,435
We can just order jjajangmyeon.

300
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:32,709
You didn't have to pack us food.

301
00:14:39,292 --> 00:14:41,250
No way.

302
00:14:41,417 --> 00:14:43,977
You're a good cook too?

303
00:14:44,001 --> 00:14:45,893
You are seriously

304
00:14:45,917 --> 00:14:47,643
the jackpot of my life,

305
00:14:47,667 --> 00:14:49,268
my saviour, and my biggest luck.

306
00:14:49,292 --> 00:14:51,685
Stop flattering me. I'm getting dizzy.

307
00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:53,750
This is so good.

308
00:14:54,709 --> 00:14:56,601
Wow.

309
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:59,250
You decorated your place neatly.

310
00:15:01,917 --> 00:15:03,144
Soo Ryeon.

311
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:05,601
Thank you so much.

312
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:08,560
I couldn't have moved here without you.

313
00:15:08,584 --> 00:15:11,750
I'll never forget what you did for me.

314
00:15:11,834 --> 00:15:13,726
You don't owe me anything.

315
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,268
You've been through a lot, Yoon Hee.

316
00:15:16,292 --> 00:15:18,393
You're starting here on the 45th floor,

317
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,476
but keep making even more money

318
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,852
to keep moving up to the 60th, the 70th,

319
00:15:21,876 --> 00:15:23,226
and even to the 85th floor

320
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,459
where Seo Jin lives.

321
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,685
In the end,

322
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:32,060
you might want the penthouse too.

323
00:15:32,084 --> 00:15:35,542
Soo Ryeon. That's nonsense.

324
00:15:36,084 --> 00:15:38,935
How could I dare to live in the penthouse?

325
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,709
That's complete nonsense, really.

326
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,018
What do you think?

327
00:15:45,042 --> 00:15:46,560
You're right.

328
00:15:46,584 --> 00:15:48,893
Why haven't I thought of that?

329
00:15:48,917 --> 00:15:50,268
This is precisely why we're members

330
00:15:50,292 --> 00:15:51,893
of Hera Palace's Operation Committee.

331
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:53,476
Once we get everyone to vote,

332
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,977
it'll be a matter of time

333
00:15:55,001 --> 00:15:56,518
before we kick them out.

334
00:15:56,542 --> 00:15:58,144
Even if we lose the penthouse's vote,

335
00:15:58,168 --> 00:15:59,309
we have two votes from Dr Ha's family,

336
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,309
two votes from this family,

337
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:01,435
and one vote from me.

338
00:16:01,459 --> 00:16:02,643
That's already more than half.

339
00:16:02,667 --> 00:16:04,226
We can get rid of them immediately.

340
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,351
Yes, we found a way.

341
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:08,060
Why won't you say anything?

342
00:16:08,084 --> 00:16:10,185
Aren't you all for it, honey?

343
00:16:10,209 --> 00:16:12,309
Did Dr Ha say he'll agree?

344
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,893
And did you ask for their opinion?

345
00:16:14,917 --> 00:16:17,351
There's no need to ask them.

346
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,144
Ms Cheon and Yoon Hee are enemies.

347
00:16:19,168 --> 00:16:20,852
They can't live in the same building.

348
00:16:20,876 --> 00:16:22,102
It'll end in a bloodbath.

349
00:16:22,126 --> 00:16:23,810
I think we'll see

350
00:16:23,834 --> 00:16:25,094
a bloodbath right upstairs.

351
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:26,476
Gosh.

352
00:16:30,542 --> 00:16:32,601
You knew, didn't you?

353
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:35,375
That Oh Yoon Hee will move to Hera Palace.

354
00:16:39,459 --> 00:16:41,876
It looks like you knew.

355
00:16:44,126 --> 00:16:46,584
Did you put him up for this?

356
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,643
What did I do?

357
00:16:48,667 --> 00:16:51,917
Chairman Joo gave her the recommendation.

358
00:16:52,709 --> 00:16:54,386
You liar.

359
00:16:55,168 --> 00:16:56,768
Are you thrilled

360
00:16:56,792 --> 00:16:58,018
to have your heartrending first love

361
00:16:58,042 --> 00:17:00,001
by your side?

362
00:17:00,292 --> 00:17:02,226
Let me make myself clear.

363
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,852
I can't live with Oh Yoon Hee

364
00:17:03,876 --> 00:17:06,417
lurking around here day and night.

365
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,102
So what if you can't?

366
00:17:10,126 --> 00:17:11,309
She already moved in

367
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:12,643
with Chairman Joo's permission.

368
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:15,084
Of course, I'll make her leave.

369
00:17:18,417 --> 00:17:20,810
It feels like I'm in hell right now.

370
00:17:20,834 --> 00:17:21,935
It's as if the nightmare of my past

371
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:24,375
came back to haunt me.

372
00:17:24,417 --> 00:17:25,852
It's driving me crazy.

373
00:17:25,876 --> 00:17:28,852
20 years have gone by already.

374
00:17:28,876 --> 00:17:31,709
You can't use that reason to kick her out.

375
00:17:32,001 --> 00:17:34,001
Interesting.

376
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:35,476
It looks like I'm the only one

377
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,834
who's uncomfortable with this situation.

378
00:17:38,042 --> 00:17:39,852
Do you finally feel at ease

379
00:17:39,876 --> 00:17:40,935
as if you took a load off your mind

380
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:42,601
to see her live a better life?

381
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:44,560
Have you been that heartbroken?

382
00:17:44,584 --> 00:17:45,893
Did you love her so much

383
00:17:45,917 --> 00:17:47,268
that you felt guilty over your entire life

384
00:17:47,292 --> 00:17:49,018
after you abandoned her?

385
00:17:49,042 --> 00:17:50,476
Enough is enough.

386
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,601
You're crossing the line right now.

387
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:54,185
Did you think I didn't know

388
00:17:54,209 --> 00:17:55,351
that you still loved her

389
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:58,625
even as you married me?

390
00:18:02,168 --> 00:18:03,810
You stayed up all night last night

391
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:05,226
studying for your exam.

392
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,834
I brought you a change of clothes.

393
00:18:09,876 --> 00:18:11,834
Heart-shaped.

394
00:18:13,042 --> 00:18:15,144
And this is my pay for this month.

395
00:18:15,168 --> 00:18:17,084
Use it for your boarding fee.

396
00:18:18,876 --> 00:18:20,226
No way.

397
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,518
Why do you always do this?

398
00:18:21,542 --> 00:18:23,560
I'm giving it to you to feel at peace.

399
00:18:23,584 --> 00:18:24,726
You don't have to be sorry.

400
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,768
I'm serious.

401
00:18:25,792 --> 00:18:27,601
And it's not much.

402
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,584
Keep it.

403
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,601
I'll become a doctor very soon

404
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,876
and support you for the rest of your life.

405
00:18:36,209 --> 00:18:39,709
And I'll get rid of this scar too.

406
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,250
That sounds great.

407
00:18:54,292 --> 00:18:56,876
Let's eat. - It's so good.

408
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,333
Dad, it's me.

409
00:19:01,417 --> 00:19:02,393
It's about the next scholarship

410
00:19:02,417 --> 00:19:04,542
Cheonga Foundation will give out.

411
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,643
I wanted to recommend

412
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:08,518
a med school student.

413
00:19:08,542 --> 00:19:10,625
Open up. - Okay.

414
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:23,625
My love holds onto the end of this night

415
00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:26,792
Don't make it

416
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:29,768
What happened?

417
00:19:29,792 --> 00:19:32,185
Did you accept Cheonga's scholarship?

418
00:19:32,209 --> 00:19:34,060
And did you go to their party to have fun

419
00:19:34,084 --> 00:19:36,102
and take pictures with the chief director?

420
00:19:36,126 --> 00:19:37,977
Why didn't you tell me?

421
00:19:38,001 --> 00:19:39,268
I felt bad for taking the scholarship

422
00:19:39,292 --> 00:19:40,518
and not showing up, so I just went.

423
00:19:40,542 --> 00:19:42,542
It doesn't mean anything.

424
00:19:43,209 --> 00:19:46,001
Do you call that an excuse?

425
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:47,726
Who told you to study to be a doctor

426
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,977
with their dirty money?

427
00:19:49,001 --> 00:19:50,643
Why do you make me disappointed?

428
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:53,226
There's no such thing as dirty money.

429
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,685
I stayed up many nights. I'm tired.

430
00:19:55,709 --> 00:19:57,226
Wait, Yoon Chul.

431
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,393
Return your scholarship right now.

432
00:19:59,417 --> 00:20:00,768
Go throw that money

433
00:20:00,792 --> 00:20:02,726
in Cheon Seo Jin's face!

434
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,977
What do you expect me to do?

435
00:20:05,001 --> 00:20:06,102
There's no way my family

436
00:20:06,126 --> 00:20:07,351
can support me through this.

437
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:08,268
My family and even extended family

438
00:20:08,292 --> 00:20:09,226
are all dirt-poor,

439
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,042
so we can't even borrow any money!

440
00:20:12,834 --> 00:20:13,893
You can just turn a blind eye

441
00:20:13,917 --> 00:20:14,893
and let me take their money.

442
00:20:14,917 --> 00:20:16,935
Why are you so sensitive over this?

443
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:18,185
You know,

444
00:20:18,209 --> 00:20:20,500
that's called a sense of inferiority.

445
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:22,034
What?

446
00:20:24,126 --> 00:20:26,417
How can you say that?

447
00:20:27,876 --> 00:20:30,309
Do you want to beg the girl

448
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:32,917
who did this to my life to keep studying?

449
00:20:34,168 --> 00:20:37,209
I hate how you're involved with her

450
00:20:37,542 --> 00:20:40,144
even more than my own death!

451
00:20:40,168 --> 00:20:44,060
That darned Cheon Seo Jin!

452
00:20:44,084 --> 00:20:45,685
Enough is enough.

453
00:20:45,709 --> 00:20:48,250
I'm sick and tired of this!

454
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:49,309
Darn it.

455
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,144
"Boarding House"

456
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:53,209
Ha Yoon Chul!

457
00:21:01,814 --> 00:21:03,144
"Certificate of Scholarship"

458
00:21:03,168 --> 00:21:04,847
"Cheonga Foundation"

"Connection"

460
00:21:14,709 --> 00:21:16,226
You should stop drinking.

461
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,292
Leave me alone.

462
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,584
Darn it.

463
00:21:30,709 --> 00:21:32,685
What does she want me to do?

464
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:35,333
Your studies are already tough enough.

465
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:39,333
Why do you put that burden on yourself?

466
00:21:44,709 --> 00:21:47,209
I'll give you...

467
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:52,792
wings.

468
00:22:04,584 --> 00:22:06,226
Watch and see

469
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,726
who'll end up living here.

470
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,060
I'm going to do everything I can

471
00:22:10,084 --> 00:22:11,935
to kick Yoon Hee out of this place.

472
00:22:11,959 --> 00:22:14,018
Oh Yoon Hee.

473
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:16,250
Oh Yoon Hee!

474
00:22:16,917 --> 00:22:18,560
Don't you get sick of this?

475
00:22:18,584 --> 00:22:20,018
You know,

476
00:22:20,042 --> 00:22:22,417
that's called a guilty conscience.

477
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,250
You'd better behave,

478
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,643
unless you want to see

479
00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:34,018
either Yoon Hee or me

480
00:22:34,042 --> 00:22:36,001
leave this place dead.

481
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:01,768
You've already done that so many times.

482
00:23:01,792 --> 00:23:03,643
Aren't you tired?

483
00:23:03,667 --> 00:23:06,060
Not at all.

484
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:07,060
Why would I get tired

485
00:23:07,084 --> 00:23:09,084
of cleaning up my own house?

486
00:23:09,515 --> 00:23:10,927
Mum.

487
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,226
You kept your promise to let me live

488
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,292
in Hera Palace.

489
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:24,226
I can't believe I lived long enough

490
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,268
to see a day like this.

491
00:23:26,292 --> 00:23:27,685
I never lived my life

492
00:23:27,709 --> 00:23:30,935
without worrying about money.

493
00:23:30,959 --> 00:23:32,852
But I'm no longer in debt,

494
00:23:32,876 --> 00:23:35,584
and I don't have to worry about the lease.

495
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:38,625
This is unbelievable, isn't it?

496
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,560
I'll get into Seoul University of Music,

497
00:23:43,584 --> 00:23:45,685
go study abroad in Italy,

498
00:23:45,709 --> 00:23:47,144
and sing as a prima donna

499
00:23:47,168 --> 00:23:49,584
at the best opera theatre in the world.

500
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:51,309
Okay.

501
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:52,518
From now on, you can do

502
00:23:52,542 --> 00:23:53,810
everything you ever wanted to.

503
00:23:53,834 --> 00:23:54,837
Okay.

504
00:23:55,584 --> 00:23:57,144
Ro Na,

505
00:23:57,168 --> 00:23:59,560
this is the first night in our new home.

506
00:23:59,584 --> 00:24:01,268
Let's sleep together.

507
00:24:01,292 --> 00:24:03,226
Okay. - Let's do that.

508
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,825
Let's go.

509
00:24:41,792 --> 00:24:44,667
Did you have a nightmare?

510
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:50,393
Did I wake you?

511
00:24:50,417 --> 00:24:51,393
No, I was tossing and turning

512
00:24:51,417 --> 00:24:53,459
because I couldn't sleep.

513
00:24:55,584 --> 00:24:57,518
Hera Palace.

514
00:24:57,542 --> 00:24:58,518
I put in such careful work

515
00:24:58,542 --> 00:25:00,060
in the creation of this place,

516
00:25:00,084 --> 00:25:02,268
but now, there's a scratch on it.

517
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:04,226
I wanted to gather the elites of Korea

518
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:06,393
to provide the best education for children

519
00:25:06,417 --> 00:25:08,351
and share the best community.

520
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:10,333
But my plan

521
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:12,018
has been tampered with

522
00:25:12,042 --> 00:25:13,893
because of Oh Yoon Hee.

523
00:25:13,917 --> 00:25:15,876
Ro Na's mum?

524
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,393
Don't get close to her.

525
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:21,500
I won't condone it.

526
00:25:26,494 --> 00:25:28,781
"Hera Palace"

527
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:42,781
Hello.

528
00:25:47,709 --> 00:25:50,060
Could you give me a hand?

529
00:25:50,084 --> 00:25:50,977
I'm not sure

530
00:25:51,001 --> 00:25:53,250
how to use this equipment.

531
00:25:56,542 --> 00:25:58,026
Me?

532
00:26:01,292 --> 00:26:03,250
This is similar

533
00:26:03,792 --> 00:26:05,709
to assisted dip machine.

534
00:26:06,292 --> 00:26:08,250
You have to work...

535
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,060
Work your

536
00:26:10,084 --> 00:26:11,601
pectoral muscles.

537
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:13,893
My goodness.

538
00:26:13,917 --> 00:26:16,726
Attorney Lee, you seem to know everything.

539
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,435
Is it because you're a lawyer?

540
00:26:18,459 --> 00:26:19,685
You have a knack

541
00:26:19,709 --> 00:26:21,852
for explaining things very easily.

542
00:26:21,876 --> 00:26:24,351
You're one intelligent man.

543
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:26,102
Intelligent?

544
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,226
Then may I ask you questions

545
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,917
whenever I'm not sure of something?

546
00:26:31,542 --> 00:26:33,834
Like a boy, I mean, guy friend.

547
00:26:35,417 --> 00:26:37,375
A boyfriend?

548
00:26:37,917 --> 00:26:38,852
A guy friend.

549
00:26:38,876 --> 00:26:40,834
Yes, a guy friend.

550
00:26:43,709 --> 00:26:46,126
I mean,

551
00:26:46,417 --> 00:26:49,917
we do have special history.

552
00:26:51,168 --> 00:26:52,351
It's better

553
00:26:52,375 --> 00:26:55,250
to have a familiar face here

554
00:26:55,792 --> 00:26:57,876
than a complete stranger.

555
00:26:58,126 --> 00:27:00,126
Well, you know,

556
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:03,518
you're very good-hearted, my woman friend.

557
00:27:03,542 --> 00:27:04,601
It's my first time

558
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:06,226
at such a luxurious gym,

559
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,584
so I was a bit troubled.

560
00:27:08,792 --> 00:27:12,834
Please help me out, my friend.

561
00:27:16,542 --> 00:27:18,667
Wait, goodness.

562
00:27:19,292 --> 00:27:21,102
With your glasses off,

563
00:27:21,126 --> 00:27:24,209
you look fatally sexy.

564
00:27:26,417 --> 00:27:29,126
I'm sure you get that a lot.

565
00:27:31,209 --> 00:27:32,494
My gosh.

566
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:34,977
Sexy? Am I?

567
00:27:35,001 --> 00:27:37,018
I usually get...

568
00:27:37,042 --> 00:27:39,226
I'm on the cute side.

569
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:41,333
People usually say that.

570
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,435
You're already going to the gym?

571
00:27:51,459 --> 00:27:52,726
You won't be staying here for long,

572
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,268
so enjoy it while you can.

573
00:27:54,292 --> 00:27:56,667
It'll be a great experience for you.

574
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,643
Does it make you feel better

575
00:27:58,667 --> 00:28:01,001
when you say things like that?

576
00:28:01,792 --> 00:28:05,209
Actually, I'm very grateful to you.

577
00:28:07,209 --> 00:28:08,768
I've always wondered

578
00:28:08,792 --> 00:28:10,601
what your home was like.

579
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:13,084
I wanted it too.

580
00:28:13,126 --> 00:28:15,560
I think that's what got me here today.

581
00:28:15,584 --> 00:28:17,476
I'm grateful for that.

582
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,226
From now on,

583
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:22,126
I'm going to want even more things.

584
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:24,560
Your house on the 85th floor.

585
00:28:24,584 --> 00:28:26,226
Everything you have.

586
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:28,226
And the things you took from me.

587
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,250
Everything.

588
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:34,560
You should do your best to keep it all,

589
00:28:34,584 --> 00:28:36,035
Seo Jin.

590
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:49,292
That was an aggressive welcome.

591
00:28:49,709 --> 00:28:51,935
Is this how people in Hera Palace

592
00:28:51,959 --> 00:28:53,601
treat their neighbours?

593
00:28:53,625 --> 00:28:55,508
Don't be so cheeky.

594
00:28:55,792 --> 00:28:57,018
I'm trying to hold myself back

595
00:28:57,042 --> 00:28:58,768
from this urge to kill you right now.

596
00:28:58,792 --> 00:29:00,130
Don't.

597
00:29:01,375 --> 00:29:04,750
I'm always ready to deal with you.

598
00:29:09,153 --> 00:29:10,912
Whatever.

599
00:29:22,417 --> 00:29:24,977
Find out where this woman is,

600
00:29:25,001 --> 00:29:26,959
as soon as possible.

601
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:29,268
Do you have other information?

602
00:29:29,292 --> 00:29:30,226
No.

603
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:31,268
I just know she ran a linen shop

604
00:29:31,292 --> 00:29:32,643
in Dongdaemun 10 years ago.

605
00:29:32,667 --> 00:29:33,643
I'll ask around

606
00:29:33,667 --> 00:29:35,834
and make sure I find her.

607
00:29:42,001 --> 00:29:45,459
I will kick you out, Oh Yoon Hee.

608
00:29:45,876 --> 00:29:47,876
I will.

609
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:50,226
That's all for today's class.

610
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:52,268
And this week, we'll have an audition

611
00:29:52,292 --> 00:29:54,018
to pick out a school ambassador.

612
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:57,500
We're going to pick one boy and one girl.

613
00:29:59,792 --> 00:30:01,060
Once you become the school ambassador,

614
00:30:01,084 --> 00:30:03,393
you'll host every single school event,

615
00:30:03,417 --> 00:30:05,268
and it'll go down on your student record.

616
00:30:05,292 --> 00:30:06,977
I'm going to take volunteers now.

617
00:30:07,001 --> 00:30:08,959
Who wants to audition?

618
00:30:09,333 --> 00:30:10,852
Okay. Min Hyuk,

619
00:30:10,876 --> 00:30:12,876
Eun Byeol...

620
00:30:19,709 --> 00:30:22,750
Ro Na, you too?

621
00:30:23,709 --> 00:30:24,977
Yes.

622
00:30:25,001 --> 00:30:28,459
I want to be a school ambassador too.

623
00:30:29,042 --> 00:30:30,476
Sure.

624
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,309
You're very courageous.

625
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:34,560
Volunteers, do your best to get prepared.

626
00:30:34,584 --> 00:30:36,417
That's all.

627
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:15,351
I have something to tell you.

628
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:17,292
Shoot.

629
00:31:19,375 --> 00:31:21,834
I'll go if you don't have anything to say.

630
00:31:22,709 --> 00:31:24,667
I like you.

631
00:31:26,917 --> 00:31:29,333
I had feelings for you for a long time.

632
00:31:30,001 --> 00:31:32,876
I know that you'd feel uncomfortable.

633
00:31:33,001 --> 00:31:35,250
That's why I couldn't tell you.

634
00:31:35,709 --> 00:31:37,351
But I can't bear to see you

635
00:31:37,375 --> 00:31:39,375
be considerate of someone else.

636
00:31:41,042 --> 00:31:42,643
Eun Byeol.

637
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:43,726
What's with you?

638
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,518
I don't understand what you're saying.

639
00:31:45,542 --> 00:31:46,803
What...

640
00:31:47,542 --> 00:31:49,726
do you think of me?

641
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:52,351
No, don't answer me right now.

642
00:31:52,375 --> 00:31:53,643
You can give me your answer

643
00:31:53,667 --> 00:31:55,560
once we both become school ambassadors.

644
00:31:55,584 --> 00:31:57,601
I'm going to do my best.

645
00:31:57,625 --> 00:32:00,185
I won't let anyone else take that spot,

646
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:02,113
especially Ro Na.

647
00:32:27,417 --> 00:32:29,018
Now that we bought

648
00:32:29,042 --> 00:32:31,852
the little piece of land from Oh Yoon Hee,

649
00:32:31,876 --> 00:32:33,393
we should begin

650
00:32:33,417 --> 00:32:35,667
working on our project now.

651
00:32:36,959 --> 00:32:38,309
Of course.

652
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:39,852
We managed to create

653
00:32:39,876 --> 00:32:42,185
a square-shaped land in Myeong-dong.

654
00:32:42,209 --> 00:32:45,168
We could sell it at the highest price.

655
00:32:46,709 --> 00:32:48,226
So,

656
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,810
who's the guy that wants to buy this land?

657
00:32:50,834 --> 00:32:52,144
If this guy plans on building up

658
00:32:52,168 --> 00:32:53,726
such a huge shopping town in Myeong-dong,

659
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,351
he must be filthy rich.

660
00:32:55,375 --> 00:32:56,435
I heard he's the most successful

661
00:32:56,459 --> 00:32:57,726
Korean-American in the US.

662
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,726
His name is Logan Lee.

663
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,060
Logan Lee?

664
00:33:01,084 --> 00:33:02,852
He came to Korea to seal this deal,

665
00:33:02,876 --> 00:33:04,393
so I'm going to meet him soon.

666
00:33:04,417 --> 00:33:07,560
May I see him with you?

667
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,893
I went to see him a few times,

668
00:33:08,917 --> 00:33:10,601
but I haven't met him yet.

669
00:33:10,625 --> 00:33:12,226
He's a guy who has a 100-storey building

670
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:14,226
in the middle of Manhattan.

671
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:15,852
It can't be that easy to get to him.

672
00:33:15,876 --> 00:33:17,852
A 100-storey building?

673
00:33:17,876 --> 00:33:20,001
The Madison Tower?

674
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,060
What did he do to make so much money?

675
00:33:24,084 --> 00:33:24,977
His father became a huge success

676
00:33:25,001 --> 00:33:25,935
with his real estate business,

677
00:33:25,959 --> 00:33:28,250
and he's a famous theatre owner now.

678
00:33:28,375 --> 00:33:31,309
He's the biggest role model of my life.

679
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:32,893
The profit solely from the observatory is

680
00:33:32,917 --> 00:33:34,810
enough to let three generations live.

681
00:33:34,834 --> 00:33:36,351
That means

682
00:33:36,375 --> 00:33:37,977
he doesn't know a thing

683
00:33:38,001 --> 00:33:39,685
about the Korean real estate market.

684
00:33:39,709 --> 00:33:40,726
Okay.

685
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:41,852
Let's con that man real good

686
00:33:41,876 --> 00:33:43,393
and grab this chance to make big money.

687
00:33:43,417 --> 00:33:45,977
We should sell it 10 times higher.

688
00:33:46,001 --> 00:33:47,917
You up for it?

689
00:33:49,417 --> 00:33:52,518
How do you think he became a rich man?

690
00:33:52,542 --> 00:33:53,560
He's sceptical

691
00:33:53,584 --> 00:33:54,726
and he doesn't trust anyone.

692
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:56,185
That's why he's rich.

693
00:33:56,209 --> 00:33:57,351
But if we set this up wisely,

694
00:33:57,375 --> 00:33:58,476
we might be able to make

695
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,102
a huge amount of profit.

696
00:34:00,126 --> 00:34:02,102
Only then will it be worth

697
00:34:02,126 --> 00:34:03,518
putting up with Oh Yoon Hee

698
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:06,709
to buy that land from the auction.

699
00:34:07,542 --> 00:34:10,102
But will Oh Yoon Hee

700
00:34:10,126 --> 00:34:13,584
keep living in Hera Palace, Dr Ha?

701
00:34:15,959 --> 00:34:17,876
You don't know?

702
00:34:19,084 --> 00:34:20,435
Will you let her stay?

703
00:34:20,459 --> 00:34:22,977
That just can't happen.

704
00:34:23,001 --> 00:34:25,144
Hera Palace is too good for her.

705
00:34:25,168 --> 00:34:26,893
I'll take measures against this,

706
00:34:26,917 --> 00:34:28,102
so don't worry about this

707
00:34:28,126 --> 00:34:29,268
and get back to your class.

708
00:34:29,292 --> 00:34:30,560
You have to be one of the top five kids

709
00:34:30,584 --> 00:34:32,102
to get into Seoul University of Music.

710
00:34:32,126 --> 00:34:33,102
You know that, right?

711
00:34:33,126 --> 00:34:34,060
Okay, bye.

712
00:34:34,084 --> 00:34:35,060
Hello.

713
00:34:35,084 --> 00:34:37,393
I just moved into unit 4502.

714
00:34:37,417 --> 00:34:39,144
You should have some.

715
00:34:39,168 --> 00:34:40,643
Rice cake? - Right here.

716
00:34:40,667 --> 00:34:41,726
Thank you.

717
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:44,250
I'm sorry. I don't eat rice cake.

718
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:48,685
Ms Cheon will get furious at you.

719
00:34:48,709 --> 00:34:50,518
Do you want to get fired over rice cake?

720
00:34:50,542 --> 00:34:52,417
You're right.

721
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,375
Don't tell her.

722
00:35:01,084 --> 00:35:03,792
Seo Jin, you're unbelievably powerful.

723
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:05,726
I can't believe some people

724
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,393
give out rice cake after moving in.

725
00:35:07,417 --> 00:35:09,476
We don't do that here at Hera Palace.

726
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,393
The least you can do

727
00:35:10,417 --> 00:35:11,852
would be dried yellow corvina.

728
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:13,060
Really?

729
00:35:13,084 --> 00:35:14,893
I'm not used to how things are here.

730
00:35:14,917 --> 00:35:18,102
The way you dress is, how can I put this?

731
00:35:18,126 --> 00:35:19,601
Very difficult to understand.

732
00:35:19,625 --> 00:35:20,726
It's not a style

733
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,518
we often see here at Hera Palace.

734
00:35:22,542 --> 00:35:24,667
She's like a maid.

735
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:26,560
I'm still sorting out my house,

736
00:35:26,584 --> 00:35:28,709
so I'd rather be in comfy clothes.

737
00:35:29,042 --> 00:35:30,393
Do you want some rice cake?

738
00:35:30,417 --> 00:35:32,560
No one in my family would eat that.

739
00:35:32,584 --> 00:35:36,226
My husband and child are very picky.

740
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:38,060
My mother-in-law is Wang Mi Ja,

741
00:35:38,084 --> 00:35:38,977
the food researcher.

742
00:35:39,001 --> 00:35:40,185
You know her, right?

743
00:35:40,209 --> 00:35:41,185
I don't think so.

744
00:35:41,209 --> 00:35:42,685
I never watch TV.

745
00:35:42,709 --> 00:35:44,144
You must be heading out.

746
00:35:44,168 --> 00:35:46,500
Goodbye, then.

747
00:35:48,584 --> 00:35:49,601
That little...

748
00:35:49,625 --> 00:35:51,102
She doesn't know her?

749
00:35:51,126 --> 00:35:52,351
How can she not know

750
00:35:52,375 --> 00:35:54,309
Wang Mi Ja the food researcher?

751
00:35:54,333 --> 00:35:56,518
She's a regular member of "Best Chef."

752
00:35:56,542 --> 00:35:58,102
How can she not know her?

753
00:35:58,126 --> 00:35:59,977
Call Ms Cheon right away to call a meeting

754
00:36:00,001 --> 00:36:01,768
as the Operation Committee.

755
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:03,977
She'll finally learn her place

756
00:36:04,001 --> 00:36:06,518
once she gets kicked out in shame.

757
00:36:06,542 --> 00:36:09,351
It must be more frustrating for you

758
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:11,226
to be on the same floor.

759
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:14,351
It means you two are on the same level.

760
00:36:14,375 --> 00:36:17,459
"On the same level"?

761
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,852
Once my husband returns from Dubai,

762
00:36:19,876 --> 00:36:21,935
we'll move up to the 60th floor too.

763
00:36:21,959 --> 00:36:24,750
We're going to move right away.

764
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,250
One second.

765
00:36:29,126 --> 00:36:30,226
Hello?

766
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:33,542
I was about to head out.

767
00:36:33,667 --> 00:36:36,476
You should soak yourself in hot water

768
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,268
and wait just a little.

769
00:36:38,292 --> 00:36:40,268
I'll be there to melt away

770
00:36:40,292 --> 00:36:42,309
all of your fatigue.

771
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:43,975
Okay.

772
00:36:48,168 --> 00:36:50,250
I'm leaving.

773
00:36:53,917 --> 00:36:55,518
She has gone insane.

774
00:36:55,542 --> 00:36:57,893
She's definitely having an affair.

775
00:36:57,917 --> 00:36:59,977
My goodness, that's disgusting.

776
00:37:00,001 --> 00:37:01,077
My gosh!

777
00:37:01,443 --> 00:37:04,326
"Mari Sauna"

778
00:37:06,542 --> 00:37:08,144
Oh, Ms Byun.

779
00:37:08,168 --> 00:37:10,643
The new mobile phone is amazing.

780
00:37:10,667 --> 00:37:12,393
It's going to be a hit.

781
00:37:12,417 --> 00:37:14,060
The stock price must've jumped too.

782
00:37:14,084 --> 00:37:15,726
Oh, right, I heard

783
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:16,893
your pharmaceutical company

784
00:37:16,917 --> 00:37:19,060
will soon go public on the KOSDAQ.

785
00:37:19,084 --> 00:37:20,977
Is that true, Ms Song?

786
00:37:21,001 --> 00:37:24,500
Your eldest son will take over, right?

787
00:37:24,834 --> 00:37:26,144
Rumour has it that they've developed

788
00:37:26,168 --> 00:37:27,351
a medication for Alzheimer's.

789
00:37:27,375 --> 00:37:29,726
They'll make it big when it goes public.

790
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:34,435
Give us some of the unlisted shares.

791
00:37:34,459 --> 00:37:36,560
Don't even dream of it.

792
00:37:36,584 --> 00:37:37,810
Only one person

793
00:37:37,834 --> 00:37:40,018
deserves to receive the company's stock.

794
00:37:40,042 --> 00:37:41,518
Who is that person?

795
00:37:41,542 --> 00:37:43,601
What do you think?

796
00:37:43,625 --> 00:37:45,560
Lady Jincheon, of course.

797
00:37:45,584 --> 00:37:47,459
Gosh. - I see.

798
00:37:48,209 --> 00:37:49,852
Ms Song.

799
00:37:49,876 --> 00:37:51,309
Your 13 minutes is up.

800
00:37:51,333 --> 00:37:52,768
Please come over here.

801
00:37:52,792 --> 00:37:54,917
Okay.

802
00:38:03,876 --> 00:38:05,852
You're not cold, are you?

803
00:38:05,876 --> 00:38:08,309
Would you like the seaweed facial, ma'am?

804
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:09,601
Why bother asking?

805
00:38:09,625 --> 00:38:11,435
I totally trust you.

806
00:38:11,459 --> 00:38:13,500
All right.

807
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:15,459
My gosh.

808
00:38:17,209 --> 00:38:20,476
By the way, where have you been?

809
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,393
Your skin feels rough.

810
00:38:22,417 --> 00:38:23,810
Were you abroad recently?

811
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:26,268
What? My gosh.

812
00:38:26,292 --> 00:38:28,185
You can tell?

813
00:38:28,209 --> 00:38:30,018
I visited a few European countries,

814
00:38:30,042 --> 00:38:32,226
but the spas there weren't that great.

815
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:34,060
Why don't you close this place

816
00:38:34,084 --> 00:38:36,375
and move to Gangnam?

817
00:38:36,417 --> 00:38:40,435
I'll let you run the sauna at my hotel.

818
00:38:40,459 --> 00:38:42,893
Thank you very much for the offer.

819
00:38:42,917 --> 00:38:45,726
But I started at the bottom of the barrel

820
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:48,144
and managed to come this far

821
00:38:48,168 --> 00:38:49,476
with this exfoliating mitt alone.

822
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,685
This is like my second home

823
00:38:51,709 --> 00:38:55,084
and where my heart belongs.

824
00:38:56,625 --> 00:39:00,084
This is why I like you.

825
00:39:00,126 --> 00:39:03,144
I admire your passion and pride

826
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,226
as a body scrub master.

827
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:07,560
Right, the stock you told me to keep.

828
00:39:07,584 --> 00:39:08,643
It hit the ceiling,

829
00:39:08,667 --> 00:39:10,102
so I made some good money.

830
00:39:10,126 --> 00:39:11,060
Good.

831
00:39:11,084 --> 00:39:12,185
You have access to information

832
00:39:12,209 --> 00:39:14,226
that no one else gets.

833
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:17,060
The three of you

834
00:39:17,084 --> 00:39:18,977
are my saviours.

835
00:39:19,001 --> 00:39:20,476
What are you talking about?

836
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,685
You're our saviour.

837
00:39:23,709 --> 00:39:25,102
Oh, right.

838
00:39:25,126 --> 00:39:26,268
How about I pay

839
00:39:26,292 --> 00:39:27,685
for you to get surgery for that scar?

840
00:39:27,709 --> 00:39:30,060
Gosh, I don't need surgery.

841
00:39:30,084 --> 00:39:31,518
To me,

842
00:39:31,542 --> 00:39:33,476
this is like an honourable trophy.

843
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:36,042
That's what this scar means to me.

844
00:39:37,786 --> 00:39:39,622
"Mari Sauna"

845
00:39:45,098 --> 00:39:47,629
Ma'am. Ma'am!

846
00:39:47,935 --> 00:39:49,560
Out of the way! Move!

847
00:39:49,584 --> 00:39:50,666
Move!

848
00:39:53,043 --> 00:39:57,014
We're almost there. Stay with me, ma'am.

849
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:00,939
Gosh!

850
00:40:03,142 --> 00:40:05,126
Darn it.

851
00:40:12,142 --> 00:40:13,743
I'm alive today

852
00:40:13,767 --> 00:40:16,559
because I didn't miss the golden hour.

853
00:40:16,642 --> 00:40:20,202
You were faster than an ambulance.

854
00:40:20,226 --> 00:40:21,868
How did you run all the way

855
00:40:21,892 --> 00:40:23,576
to the hospital in your underwear?

856
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,077
My gosh, it's nothing.

857
00:40:26,101 --> 00:40:28,368
I'm embarrassed, ma'am.

858
00:40:28,392 --> 00:40:30,326
Come to think of it,

859
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:31,826
you saved many lives.

860
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:33,701
Even when I had a heart attack,

861
00:40:33,725 --> 00:40:35,743
you did CPR and brought me back to life.

862
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:36,701
Gosh. - Remember?

863
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:38,826
You also detected my breast cancer.

864
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:41,202
You're like a skilled doctor.

865
00:40:41,226 --> 00:40:43,576
Even the famous doctor couldn't detect it,

866
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,160
yet you did.

867
00:40:45,184 --> 00:40:47,268
Right.

868
00:40:47,475 --> 00:40:48,660
Lady Jincheon,

869
00:40:48,684 --> 00:40:50,660
you saved our lives.

870
00:40:50,684 --> 00:40:53,244
We'll help you big time one day.

871
00:40:53,268 --> 00:40:56,077
We take revenge,

872
00:40:56,101 --> 00:40:57,326
but we also return favours.

873
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:59,326
My gosh, please.

874
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:04,850
I'm embarrassed. Stop, please.

875
00:41:05,142 --> 00:41:06,451
I made this rice punch.

876
00:41:06,475 --> 00:41:07,576
It'll cool you down.

877
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,285
Here, have some.

878
00:41:09,309 --> 00:41:11,475
Okay, sounds good. - Okay.

879
00:41:14,741 --> 00:41:19,657
"Fairmont Ambassador Seoul"

880
00:42:01,142 --> 00:42:02,326
Hello?

881
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:03,952
Hello, this is Joo Dan Tae

882
00:42:03,976 --> 00:42:05,035
from JKING Holdings.

883
00:42:05,059 --> 00:42:06,701
Am I speaking with Logan Lee?

884
00:42:06,725 --> 00:42:09,409
Yes, this is he. How can I help you?

885
00:42:09,433 --> 00:42:10,785
I heard that you're planning to open

886
00:42:10,809 --> 00:42:12,285
a shopping centre in Myeong-dong.

887
00:42:12,309 --> 00:42:13,409
I'm the person that owns

888
00:42:13,433 --> 00:42:15,309
the property there.

889
00:42:15,517 --> 00:42:18,202
Oh, yes. I heard it from my secretary.

890
00:42:18,226 --> 00:42:19,993
I'm actually still looking into it.

891
00:42:20,017 --> 00:42:21,493
I can assure you that you won't find

892
00:42:21,517 --> 00:42:23,576
a better piece of property elsewhere.

893
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,118
Are you available at the moment?

894
00:42:25,142 --> 00:42:27,910
I'm actually here at the hotel lobby.

895
00:42:27,934 --> 00:42:29,285
No. I'm a bit tired tonight.

896
00:42:29,309 --> 00:42:30,993
Why don't I have somebody call you back?

897
00:42:31,017 --> 00:42:33,184
Goodbye.

898
00:42:33,642 --> 00:42:36,142
Hello?

899
00:42:36,809 --> 00:42:38,493
Why is he so arrogant?

900
00:42:38,517 --> 00:42:41,600
Is it that hard to show me your face?

901
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,543
What did he say?

902
00:42:45,567 --> 00:42:47,692
Are we meeting him?

903
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,710
Did he turn you down again?

904
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:53,501
What the heck? This is so embarrassing.

905
00:42:53,525 --> 00:42:54,710
How many times has he rejected you?

906
00:42:54,734 --> 00:42:56,668
We even came all the way here.

907
00:42:56,692 --> 00:42:58,565
Is he actually interested in buying it?

908
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:00,715
Obviously, he...

909
00:43:01,318 --> 00:43:04,192
That's obviously why he came to Korea.

910
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:05,876
From what I've found out,

911
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:07,085
he's looking for a property

912
00:43:07,109 --> 00:43:08,418
that's worth about 500 billion won.

913
00:43:08,442 --> 00:43:09,710
What?

914
00:43:09,734 --> 00:43:11,501
500 billion won?

915
00:43:11,525 --> 00:43:13,418
When it comes to real estate properties,

916
00:43:13,442 --> 00:43:15,501
it's never good to rush things.

917
00:43:15,525 --> 00:43:16,876
Pretend you have no reason to rush

918
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:18,459
to make the other party anxious.

919
00:43:18,483 --> 00:43:20,459
Only then can negotiations begin.

920
00:43:20,483 --> 00:43:22,085
Patience can help you

921
00:43:22,109 --> 00:43:24,276
earn more money.

922
00:43:26,359 --> 00:43:28,442
500 billion won?

923
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,418
Hi.

924
00:43:33,442 --> 00:43:35,459
What are you guys doing here?

925
00:43:35,483 --> 00:43:36,376
Our classmate

926
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,168
is our next-door neighbour now.

927
00:43:38,192 --> 00:43:40,318
Why can't we visit you?

928
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,626
I brought some braised short ribs.

929
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:44,168
My mum wanted to share this with you.

930
00:43:44,192 --> 00:43:45,585
Are you surprised?

931
00:43:45,609 --> 00:43:47,210
No, come on in.

932
00:43:47,234 --> 00:43:49,192
Okay.

933
00:43:57,525 --> 00:43:58,793
I didn't have enough time to cook.

934
00:43:58,817 --> 00:44:00,376
I hope you guys like it.

935
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,626
Had I known you guys were coming,

936
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:03,543
I would've done it properly.

937
00:44:03,567 --> 00:44:06,501
Next time, I'll cook nicer things.

938
00:44:06,525 --> 00:44:08,252
Ms Oh, I don't mean to be rude,

939
00:44:08,276 --> 00:44:09,626
but we'd like to hang out

940
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:10,585
on our own today.

941
00:44:10,609 --> 00:44:12,668
What? Oh, of course.

942
00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:15,043
What was I thinking?

943
00:44:15,067 --> 00:44:16,376
You can hang out here until late at night,

944
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,376
so have fun.

945
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,918
Thanks for coming.

946
00:44:20,942 --> 00:44:22,960
We hope we're not being a nuisance.

947
00:44:22,984 --> 00:44:24,876
Thank you for the food.

948
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:26,459
All right.

949
00:44:26,483 --> 00:44:29,318
I'll step out then.

950
00:44:32,692 --> 00:44:34,668
Gosh. - Oh, boy.

951
00:44:34,692 --> 00:44:35,751
You're studying vocal music.

952
00:44:35,775 --> 00:44:37,252
How could you eat this kind of food?

953
00:44:37,276 --> 00:44:39,294
What's your mum thinking?

954
00:44:39,318 --> 00:44:41,418
Look at this spicy tteokbokki and...

955
00:44:41,442 --> 00:44:43,626
Gosh, and these greasy fritters.

956
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:45,168
Such inconsiderate choices.

957
00:44:45,192 --> 00:44:47,168
My goodness.

958
00:44:47,192 --> 00:44:48,668
If my mum saw this,

959
00:44:48,692 --> 00:44:50,543
she'd totally pass out.

960
00:44:50,567 --> 00:44:53,793
Gosh, it's all junk food.

961
00:44:53,817 --> 00:44:55,168
Guys, what's wrong with you?

962
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:56,626
Don't be so rude.

963
00:44:56,650 --> 00:44:58,376
We're here to get closer.

964
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,543
Ro Na, don't take it to heart.

965
00:45:00,567 --> 00:45:02,793
You know they don't mean what they say.

966
00:45:02,817 --> 00:45:05,734
Yes, it's okay.

967
00:45:11,567 --> 00:45:14,585
Wow, I don't believe this.

968
00:45:14,609 --> 00:45:15,751
Seok Hoon eating food

969
00:45:15,775 --> 00:45:17,859
at someone else's house?

970
00:45:18,775 --> 00:45:20,900
Then I'll try one too.

971
00:45:24,817 --> 00:45:25,960
It's actually not bad.

972
00:45:25,984 --> 00:45:27,900
Is it good? - Yes, try it.

973
00:45:29,942 --> 00:45:31,984
Here.

974
00:45:34,609 --> 00:45:36,609
It's so good. - I know.

975
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:39,734
Here, try this too.

976
00:45:39,817 --> 00:45:41,085
Here. - I'm going to the loo.

977
00:45:41,109 --> 00:45:42,294
It's tasty.

978
00:45:42,318 --> 00:45:44,734
Pass me the juice. - The juice? Okay.

979
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:53,154
"Ro Na's Diary"

980
00:46:00,853 --> 00:46:03,103
"Mum and I got into an accident"

981
00:46:04,775 --> 00:46:07,359
"Joo Seok Hoon"

982
00:46:10,734 --> 00:46:12,062
I wonder if Seok Hoon drank

983
00:46:12,087 --> 00:46:14,127
the chocolate milk I gave him.

984
00:46:14,151 --> 00:46:16,418
I think

985
00:46:16,442 --> 00:46:19,234
I have a crush on Seok Hoon.

986
00:46:22,026 --> 00:46:23,459
What are you doing here?

987
00:46:23,483 --> 00:46:25,402
Oh, nothing.

988
00:46:31,192 --> 00:46:32,210
Aren't you coming?

989
00:46:32,234 --> 00:46:33,335
You go ahead.

990
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:35,252
I want to take a look at her room.

991
00:46:35,276 --> 00:46:37,043
It's nicely decorated.

992
00:46:37,067 --> 00:46:39,692
Ro Na actually has good taste.

993
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:41,668
Doesn't she?

994
00:46:41,692 --> 00:46:43,734
I don't know.

995
00:46:52,692 --> 00:46:54,751
I can't believe she already took a photo.

996
00:46:54,775 --> 00:46:56,168
Seok Kyung.

997
00:46:56,192 --> 00:46:57,168
Yes?

998
00:46:57,192 --> 00:46:59,168
What are you doing here?

999
00:46:59,192 --> 00:47:01,234
Just looking around.

1000
00:47:02,942 --> 00:47:05,775
Isn't her room nicely decorated?

1001
00:47:07,192 --> 00:47:09,359
Ro Na and her mother.

1002
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:10,459
Are we going to let them

1003
00:47:10,483 --> 00:47:11,418
stay at Hera Palace?

1004
00:47:11,442 --> 00:47:12,543
Of course not.

1005
00:47:12,567 --> 00:47:14,252
We should meet with the committee

1006
00:47:14,276 --> 00:47:15,960
and have them move out.

1007
00:47:15,984 --> 00:47:18,692
We've already decided to do that.

1008
00:47:18,734 --> 00:47:20,501
But she has that recommendation card,

1009
00:47:20,525 --> 00:47:21,960
so we can't kick them out

1010
00:47:21,984 --> 00:47:23,168
without a good reason.

1011
00:47:23,192 --> 00:47:25,900
Then what should we do?

1012
00:47:39,276 --> 00:47:40,294
What do you want?

1013
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:41,918
I'll have a latte.

1014
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:43,710
Be it a misconduct

1015
00:47:43,734 --> 00:47:45,751
or an unethical deed.

1016
00:47:45,775 --> 00:47:47,294
We'll find fault with her

1017
00:47:47,318 --> 00:47:49,418
and make people vote against her.

1018
00:47:49,442 --> 00:47:52,026
I'll set everything up.

1019
00:47:52,151 --> 00:47:54,859
I just need the two of you

1020
00:47:55,318 --> 00:47:58,359
to encourage the others to be on board.

1021
00:47:59,234 --> 00:48:01,276
You can do that, right?

1022
00:48:02,276 --> 00:48:04,400
Easy-peasy.

1023
00:48:10,151 --> 00:48:12,002
Has anyone seen my hairpin?

1024
00:48:12,026 --> 00:48:13,252
Gosh. - What hairpin?

1025
00:48:13,276 --> 00:48:14,501
You know, that hairpin.

1026
00:48:14,525 --> 00:48:16,793
The one my dad sent me from Dubai.

1027
00:48:16,817 --> 00:48:18,668
You mean, the one with diamonds?

1028
00:48:18,692 --> 00:48:20,252
Where did you put something so expensive?

1029
00:48:20,276 --> 00:48:23,859
I don't know. This is so annoying!

1030
00:48:25,192 --> 00:48:28,918
There's been a theft case at our school,

1031
00:48:28,942 --> 00:48:31,002
which is absolutely unacceptable.

1032
00:48:31,026 --> 00:48:32,252
The stolen item is a hairpin

1033
00:48:32,276 --> 00:48:34,043
with diamonds on it.

1034
00:48:34,067 --> 00:48:36,168
Since it's such an expensive item,

1035
00:48:36,192 --> 00:48:39,859
I must check all your belongings.

1036
00:48:40,442 --> 00:48:43,234
Ro Na, open your pencil case.

1037
00:48:48,192 --> 00:48:49,127
My gosh. - What?

1038
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:50,710
What is that?

1039
00:48:50,734 --> 00:48:52,294
Do you smoke?

1040
00:48:52,318 --> 00:48:53,668
No, I don't.

1041
00:48:53,692 --> 00:48:55,043
This isn't mine.

1042
00:48:55,067 --> 00:48:56,252
Then whose is it?

1043
00:48:56,276 --> 00:48:58,376
Isn't this your bag?

1044
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,459
Yes, it is my bag.

1045
00:49:00,483 --> 00:49:02,085
But I swear it's not mine.

1046
00:49:02,109 --> 00:49:03,294
I really don't smoke.

1047
00:49:03,318 --> 00:49:05,376
How dare you keep on lying to me.

1048
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,817
Are you the one who stole Je Ni's hairpin?

1049
00:49:10,567 --> 00:49:12,859
What's that? - My gosh.

1050
00:49:14,692 --> 00:49:15,751
Ro Na.

1051
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:17,710
What will you say about this?

1052
00:49:17,734 --> 00:49:18,960
Who told you that you could bring

1053
00:49:18,984 --> 00:49:20,127
an X-rated magazine to school?

1054
00:49:20,151 --> 00:49:22,751
Please believe me. It really isn't mine!

1055
00:49:22,775 --> 00:49:25,900
Someone put these in my bag on purpose.

1056
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:28,876
Hey, Je Ni.

1057
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:31,252
It was you, right? You did this.

1058
00:49:31,276 --> 00:49:32,751
Is this another ruse of yours?

1059
00:49:32,775 --> 00:49:35,043
Tell me! I asked you if you did this!

1060
00:49:35,067 --> 00:49:36,459
What are you talking about?

1061
00:49:36,483 --> 00:49:38,127
I'm so upset about my hairpin!

1062
00:49:38,151 --> 00:49:39,876
My dad bought it for my birthday!

1063
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:42,234
It's a gift from my dad!

1064
00:49:44,109 --> 00:49:45,376
Hey.

1065
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,085
I never liked your attitude

1066
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:48,835
and the way you talk to me.

1067
00:49:48,859 --> 00:49:50,002
Follow me to the staff room.

1068
00:49:50,026 --> 00:49:51,918
Please believe me.

1069
00:49:51,942 --> 00:49:53,335
They're not mine.

1070
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:55,294
Seriously, I swear.

1071
00:49:55,318 --> 00:49:56,960
Something's gone wrong.

1072
00:49:56,984 --> 00:49:58,835
I'm telling you the truth!

1073
00:49:58,859 --> 00:50:00,710
Stop lying. Just come with me!

1074
00:50:00,734 --> 00:50:02,918
Please believe me. Please?

1075
00:50:02,942 --> 00:50:04,876
I've never even seen those things before.

1076
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:07,002
I'm telling you the truth, Mr Ma.

1077
00:50:07,026 --> 00:50:09,626
Follow me. - Please hear me out.

1078
00:50:09,650 --> 00:50:11,692
I've never seen them before!

1079
00:50:12,276 --> 00:50:14,501
Ro Na got what she deserved, right?

1080
00:50:14,525 --> 00:50:16,168
After all, I shouldn't have been worried.

1081
00:50:16,192 --> 00:50:17,127
Had I known she was like that,

1082
00:50:17,151 --> 00:50:19,359
I would've stayed far away.

1083
00:50:20,692 --> 00:50:22,168
It was you, wasn't it?

1084
00:50:22,192 --> 00:50:23,960
The cigarettes in Ro Na's bag.

1085
00:50:23,984 --> 00:50:25,127
What are you talking about?

1086
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:26,294
No, it wasn't me.

1087
00:50:26,318 --> 00:50:29,192
You went into her room yesterday.

1088
00:50:30,192 --> 00:50:32,400
I did, but...

1089
00:50:32,734 --> 00:50:34,210
Anyway, it wasn't me.

1090
00:50:34,234 --> 00:50:35,335
For real. Don't you trust me?

1091
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:38,026
Are you going to lie to me as well?

1092
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,567
I'm disappointed in you.

1093
00:50:44,601 --> 00:50:45,918
Seok Hoon.

1094
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:48,127
Joo Seok Hoon!

1095
00:51:08,442 --> 00:51:10,984
Isn't her room nicely decorated?

1096
00:51:48,318 --> 00:51:49,418
This won't end

1097
00:51:49,442 --> 00:51:52,210
with just some penalty points.

1098
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:53,918
This is enough to get her suspended.

1099
00:51:53,942 --> 00:51:55,585
If she gets suspended,

1100
00:51:55,609 --> 00:51:56,960
she won't be qualified to apply

1101
00:51:56,984 --> 00:51:58,418
for the school ambassador role.

1102
00:51:58,442 --> 00:52:01,543
Ro Na never stood a chance anyway.

1103
00:52:01,567 --> 00:52:05,609
It'll be Seok Kyung versus Eun Byeol.

1104
00:52:05,817 --> 00:52:06,793
I can't believe she smokes

1105
00:52:06,817 --> 00:52:08,942
when she's studying vocal music.

1106
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:12,294
Punish Ro Na according to the rules.

1107
00:52:12,318 --> 00:52:14,276
Sure thing.

1108
00:52:14,775 --> 00:52:15,751
"I am Oh Yoon Hee's mother-in-law!"

1109
00:52:15,775 --> 00:52:17,710
I am here to tell you the truth

1110
00:52:17,734 --> 00:52:19,710
about Oh Yoon Hee,

1111
00:52:19,734 --> 00:52:23,067
who lives in Unit 4502 at Hera Palace!

1112
00:52:23,151 --> 00:52:24,668
As soon as

1113
00:52:24,692 --> 00:52:26,543
her husband died,

1114
00:52:26,567 --> 00:52:28,224
she abandoned

1115
00:52:28,249 --> 00:52:30,703
her old and ill mother-in-law.

1116
00:52:30,728 --> 00:52:32,043
Gosh. - She lives here,

1117
00:52:32,067 --> 00:52:33,294
the most expensive building

1118
00:52:33,318 --> 00:52:35,751
in the country... - Look at that.

1119
00:52:35,775 --> 00:52:37,459
while I, her mother-in-law,

1120
00:52:37,483 --> 00:52:39,294
can't even afford to pay rent

1121
00:52:39,318 --> 00:52:40,459
or sustain myself.

1122
00:52:40,483 --> 00:52:41,376
I'm only alive

1123
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,359
because I can't kill myself.

1124
00:52:43,692 --> 00:52:46,043
Does this make sense to you?

1125
00:52:46,067 --> 00:52:48,459
How could she be so ungrateful?

1126
00:52:48,483 --> 00:52:50,043
Just because her husband died,

1127
00:52:50,067 --> 00:52:52,294
she cut all ties with her in-laws.

1128
00:52:52,318 --> 00:52:55,751
She took all of my son's hard-earned money

1129
00:52:55,775 --> 00:52:57,085
and ran away with it.

1130
00:52:57,109 --> 00:53:00,442
She's utterly shameless!

1131
00:53:00,735 --> 00:53:02,335
My gosh. - How could she do that?

1132
00:53:02,359 --> 00:53:03,252
I'm not surprised.

1133
00:53:03,276 --> 00:53:04,585
It's her, right?

1134
00:53:04,609 --> 00:53:06,335
What are you doing right now?

1135
00:53:06,359 --> 00:53:07,751
What is this about?

1136
00:53:07,775 --> 00:53:09,984
Please leave!

1137
00:53:11,692 --> 00:53:12,793
What's going on here?

1138
00:53:12,817 --> 00:53:14,210
Hush.

1139
00:53:14,234 --> 00:53:16,002
It's very entertaining, so just watch.

1140
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:18,442
Will you please stop?

1141
00:53:18,642 --> 00:53:19,952
My smarty-pants daughter-in-law.

1142
00:53:19,976 --> 00:53:21,993
There you are.

1143
00:53:22,017 --> 00:53:25,244
Do you only care about yourself?

1144
00:53:25,268 --> 00:53:27,035
I'm still Ro Na's grandmother.

1145
00:53:27,059 --> 00:53:28,493
How could you completely

1146
00:53:28,517 --> 00:53:30,285
neglect me like this?

1147
00:53:30,309 --> 00:53:32,785
Gosh, my son died because of you.

1148
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:34,868
Now you won't even let me see Ro Na.

1149
00:53:34,892 --> 00:53:37,285
I can't even die because I'm so angry.

1150
00:53:37,309 --> 00:53:40,706
You have no idea how angry I am!

1151
00:53:42,767 --> 00:53:45,493
Why don't you at least give us an excuse?

1152
00:53:45,517 --> 00:53:48,202
Did you really abandon your mother-in-law?

1153
00:53:48,226 --> 00:53:50,868
How could you do such a thing?

1154
00:53:50,892 --> 00:53:51,826
A lowlife like you

1155
00:53:51,850 --> 00:53:53,576
shouldn't be allowed to live here.

1156
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:54,535
I've only heard about

1157
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,118
this kind of stuff on the news.

1158
00:53:56,142 --> 00:53:57,368
Don't you all agree?

1159
00:53:57,392 --> 00:53:58,535
Yes. - Totally.

1160
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:00,326
We can talk in private. Come on.

1161
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:01,244
My goodness.

1162
00:54:01,268 --> 00:54:03,368
Gosh. - Look at that!

1163
00:54:03,392 --> 00:54:05,493
Unbelievable. - My goodness.

1164
00:54:05,517 --> 00:54:08,392
My poor son.

1165
00:54:09,226 --> 00:54:11,244
If he sees this,

1166
00:54:11,268 --> 00:54:13,368
he'll be utterly heartbroken.

1167
00:54:13,392 --> 00:54:14,701
This is why it's so important

1168
00:54:14,725 --> 00:54:16,409
to pick the right daughter-in-law.

1169
00:54:16,433 --> 00:54:18,976
Enough, please!

1170
00:54:22,392 --> 00:54:24,559
Have you forgotten

1171
00:54:24,976 --> 00:54:27,101
how your son died?

1172
00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:29,701
He got drunk

1173
00:54:29,725 --> 00:54:31,326
and fell over the railing

1174
00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:33,451
while cheating on me!

1175
00:54:33,475 --> 00:54:35,576
Am I responsible for that?

1176
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,160
How dare you talk back to me!

1177
00:54:37,184 --> 00:54:38,618
Mother.

1178
00:54:38,642 --> 00:54:40,767
Have you ever given Ro Na

1179
00:54:40,850 --> 00:54:43,725
a warm hug, even just once?

1180
00:54:44,101 --> 00:54:45,826
You've never even bought

1181
00:54:45,850 --> 00:54:48,976
a single toy for her.

1182
00:54:50,017 --> 00:54:52,725
All you ever cared about was money!

1183
00:54:53,976 --> 00:54:55,743
After I got married,

1184
00:54:55,767 --> 00:54:57,202
I gave you money every month

1185
00:54:57,226 --> 00:55:00,576
for your living expenses.

1186
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:02,535
Before your son died,

1187
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:03,826
he got into debt just so he could help

1188
00:55:03,850 --> 00:55:06,309
his mistress start a business.

1189
00:55:08,184 --> 00:55:11,684
And I had to pay that off.

1190
00:55:14,184 --> 00:55:15,618
You're the one

1191
00:55:15,642 --> 00:55:17,785
who ran off

1192
00:55:17,809 --> 00:55:19,244
with all the condolence money

1193
00:55:19,268 --> 00:55:21,559
at his funeral.

1194
00:55:22,059 --> 00:55:24,326
You wanted to cut ties with me

1195
00:55:24,350 --> 00:55:25,368
because you were afraid

1196
00:55:25,392 --> 00:55:27,285
I'd want half of your house!

1197
00:55:27,309 --> 00:55:29,077
You said you never wanted to see me again.

1198
00:55:29,101 --> 00:55:32,035
And you're blaming me for everything now?

1199
00:55:32,059 --> 00:55:33,289
Why?

1200
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:36,160
For the first time in my life,

1201
00:55:36,184 --> 00:55:37,326
I have the chance to live

1202
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:39,576
a decent life in a nice apartment.

1203
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:42,868
Is it that hard for you to watch?

1204
00:55:42,892 --> 00:55:46,475
Is that why you're causing a scene here?

1205
00:55:47,392 --> 00:55:49,517
Your son died

1206
00:55:49,684 --> 00:55:52,368
while cheating on me.

1207
00:55:52,392 --> 00:55:55,350
How could you use him to sabotage me?

1208
00:55:58,767 --> 00:56:01,451
What an eventful life.

1209
00:56:01,475 --> 00:56:04,392
Gosh, I can't even breathe.

1210
00:56:05,142 --> 00:56:07,895
Leave, please!

1211
00:56:09,517 --> 00:56:10,493
You can't do this, ma'am.

1212
00:56:10,517 --> 00:56:11,409
Let go! - Please leave.

1213
00:56:11,433 --> 00:56:13,826
You little... Hands off. Let go!

1214
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:16,767
You can let go. Let go of her.

1215
00:56:17,517 --> 00:56:18,618
She's Ro Na's grandmother.

1216
00:56:18,642 --> 00:56:21,226
I'll deal with her.

1217
00:56:21,684 --> 00:56:23,785
I apologise for all this commotion.

1218
00:56:23,809 --> 00:56:24,868
I'm sorry you had to hear

1219
00:56:24,892 --> 00:56:25,785
about my private life.

1220
00:56:25,809 --> 00:56:27,934
I'm so embarrassed.

1221
00:56:28,405 --> 00:56:31,614
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

1222
00:56:33,268 --> 00:56:35,392
Please leave.

1223
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:38,528
If you want money from me,

1224
00:56:39,142 --> 00:56:41,793
you'd better get up now!

1225
00:56:47,350 --> 00:56:48,966
You piece of...

1226
00:56:51,226 --> 00:56:52,756
Lead the way.

1227
00:57:07,850 --> 00:57:10,244
I have to say, she's quite charismatic.

1228
00:57:10,268 --> 00:57:12,268
She really is.

1229
00:57:13,475 --> 00:57:16,736
Hey, why are you crying?

1230
00:57:17,878 --> 00:57:20,897
Gosh, you idiot.

1231
00:57:21,977 --> 00:57:23,786
You fool. - Gosh!

1232
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,143
Ouch.

1233
00:57:25,475 --> 00:57:29,004
Do you really not know why I'm crying?

1234
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:36,202
Hey, get back here!

1235
00:57:36,226 --> 00:57:37,374
Hey.

1236
00:57:37,850 --> 00:57:39,035
How dare you push your husband.

1237
00:57:39,059 --> 00:57:40,774
Get back here!

1238
00:57:43,433 --> 00:57:45,285
I kind of feel bad for her.

1239
00:57:45,309 --> 00:57:47,517
Don't you, Ms Cheon?

1240
00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:50,368
But we'll still kick her out, of course.

1241
00:57:50,392 --> 00:57:52,285
But that reminded me of my mother-in-law,

1242
00:57:52,309 --> 00:57:54,160
which is giving me a headache.

1243
00:57:54,184 --> 00:57:56,535
Is it because her memorial is coming up?

1244
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:58,535
Oh, my princess. When did you get here?

1245
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:00,535
You must be hungry. Let's go eat.

1246
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:02,463
Come on.

1247
00:58:06,101 --> 00:58:07,691
You lost.

1248
00:58:08,725 --> 00:58:10,338
What did you say?

1249
00:58:10,725 --> 00:58:12,379
I said, you lost.

1250
00:58:12,684 --> 00:58:14,326
Just admit it.

1251
00:58:14,350 --> 00:58:16,976
You can't kick Yoon Hee out.

1252
00:58:24,976 --> 00:58:28,226
So what are you saying?

1253
00:58:30,392 --> 00:58:32,118
You won't let me

1254
00:58:32,142 --> 00:58:34,326
move in with you? Is that it?

1255
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:35,451
That's right.

1256
00:58:35,475 --> 00:58:37,433
I don't want that.

1257
00:58:38,142 --> 00:58:39,701
I don't want to see you complain

1258
00:58:39,725 --> 00:58:41,892
to Ro Na about everything

1259
00:58:42,226 --> 00:58:44,368
or roam around as if you own the place.

1260
00:58:44,392 --> 00:58:46,035
You really don't hold back, do you?

1261
00:58:46,059 --> 00:58:47,910
How did you stay quiet all these years?

1262
00:58:47,934 --> 00:58:50,433
How did you know that I live here?

1263
00:58:50,850 --> 00:58:53,809
It was very easy to find out.

1264
00:58:54,268 --> 00:58:57,725
We haven't stayed in touch for five years.

1265
00:58:58,850 --> 00:59:00,868
Who is it?

1266
00:59:00,892 --> 00:59:02,743
Who told you that I live here?

1267
00:59:02,767 --> 00:59:04,598
No one!

1268
00:59:13,047 --> 00:59:14,910
If you tell me the truth,

1269
00:59:14,934 --> 00:59:18,605
I'll help you get a long-term rental.

1270
00:59:19,433 --> 00:59:21,061
"Bank Book"

1271
00:59:21,936 --> 00:59:24,035
I see that you've become

1272
00:59:24,210 --> 00:59:26,166
quite generous.

1273
00:59:37,305 --> 00:59:39,190
Stop drinking.

1274
00:59:43,934 --> 00:59:44,993
Are you okay?

1275
00:59:45,017 --> 00:59:46,368
No.

1276
00:59:46,392 --> 00:59:48,191
I'm not okay.

1277
00:59:50,611 --> 00:59:52,322
My life...

1278
00:59:53,517 --> 00:59:55,676
It's such a mess, isn't it?

1279
00:59:56,558 --> 00:59:59,811
But now that everyone knows about it,

1280
01:00:00,892 --> 01:00:03,118
I feel relieved.

1281
01:00:03,142 --> 01:00:05,118
It's not your fault.

1282
01:00:05,142 --> 01:00:07,368
You did your best and worked hard.

1283
01:00:07,392 --> 01:00:08,618
Despite the situation,

1284
01:00:08,642 --> 01:00:10,868
you did such a great job raising Ro Na.

1285
01:00:10,892 --> 01:00:12,934
It's admirable.

1286
01:00:14,433 --> 01:00:16,179
How come

1287
01:00:16,789 --> 01:00:19,706
you look more upset than I am?

1288
01:00:20,912 --> 01:00:22,786
I just wonder

1289
01:00:23,101 --> 01:00:25,725
if things would be different now

1290
01:00:26,350 --> 01:00:29,350
if I didn't leave you back then.

1291
01:00:35,350 --> 01:00:37,326
Do you regret

1292
01:00:37,350 --> 01:00:39,350
marrying...

1293
01:00:41,684 --> 01:00:43,409
Seo Jin?

1294
01:00:43,433 --> 01:00:46,350
Life is full of regrets, you know.

1295
01:00:46,684 --> 01:00:48,892
They say that life is about bearing

1296
01:00:48,976 --> 01:00:50,244
living with the choices

1297
01:00:50,268 --> 01:00:52,809
that you didn't make.

1298
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,660
That wasn't

1299
01:01:05,684 --> 01:01:07,642
your fault.

1300
01:01:09,184 --> 01:01:11,684
So you don't need to feel sorry for me.

1301
01:01:15,350 --> 01:01:17,517
Back then...

1302
01:01:19,642 --> 01:01:21,934
we were too young.

1303
01:01:24,433 --> 01:01:25,875
And...

1304
01:01:28,684 --> 01:01:32,767
my life wasn't always so miserable.

1305
01:01:34,684 --> 01:01:37,517
I have Ro Na, you know.

1306
01:01:37,767 --> 01:01:39,015
Thanks

1307
01:01:39,433 --> 01:01:41,559
for saying that.

1308
01:01:54,017 --> 01:01:55,934
We should go home.

1309
01:01:56,892 --> 01:02:00,142
I shouldn't have called you.

1310
01:02:00,226 --> 01:02:02,600
Yoon Hee. Are you all right?

1311
01:02:56,810 --> 01:02:59,852
"Connection"

1312
01:03:11,226 --> 01:03:12,576
Sorry.

1313
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:14,684
That was my mistake.

1314
01:03:16,392 --> 01:03:18,785
You should go after your wife.

1315
01:03:18,809 --> 01:03:22,035
Seo Jin saw us together just now.

1316
01:03:22,059 --> 01:03:23,535
What?

1317
01:03:23,559 --> 01:03:25,244
What was she doing here?

1318
01:03:25,268 --> 01:03:27,642
I told her to come.

1319
01:03:29,642 --> 01:03:32,160
She was the one who made my mother-in-law

1320
01:03:32,184 --> 01:03:34,309
cause a scene earlier.

1321
01:03:37,767 --> 01:03:39,785
I'm sorry

1322
01:03:39,809 --> 01:03:41,333
about this.

1323
01:03:45,559 --> 01:03:47,642
Yoon Chul.

1324
01:03:57,976 --> 01:03:59,451
I can't put up with this any more.

1325
01:03:59,475 --> 01:04:00,785
Oh Yoon Hee, I will make you

1326
01:04:00,809 --> 01:04:02,118
hit rock bottom again.

1327
01:04:02,142 --> 01:04:05,018
I will kick her out of Hera Palace.

1328
01:04:05,043 --> 01:04:07,334
"Connection"

1329
01:04:34,475 --> 01:04:36,326
My husband

1330
01:04:36,350 --> 01:04:38,767
went to the villa again.

1331
01:04:39,268 --> 01:04:41,826
After buying a ton of new clothes

1332
01:04:41,850 --> 01:04:44,309
for Cheon Seo Jin.

1333
01:05:57,350 --> 01:06:00,725
Joo... Joo Dan Tae?

=Penthouse=

1335
01:08:46,623 --> 01:08:48,910
Will I never deserve to be with you,

1336
01:08:48,934 --> 01:08:49,703
Yoon Hee?

1337
01:08:49,728 --> 01:08:50,993
Make Cheon Seo Jin pay

1338
01:08:51,017 --> 01:08:52,891
for everything she did.

1339
01:08:52,916 --> 01:08:56,037
You nasty, crass witch.

1340
01:08:56,852 --> 01:08:58,575
Were you with Yoon Hee all night?

1341
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:02,180
I really like your enthusiasm.

1342
01:09:02,205 --> 01:09:03,348
Ms Sim,

1343
01:09:03,373 --> 01:09:05,071
you don't deserve to be this happy.

1344
01:09:05,096 --> 01:09:06,223
Shoot me.

1345
01:09:06,342 --> 01:09:07,578
Go ahead and shoot!

1346
01:09:07,603 --> 01:09:10,966
You scumbags!
