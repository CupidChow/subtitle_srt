We have some breaking news.

6
00:00:41,247 --> 00:00:43,601
The government has announced

7
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:45,185
its plan to redevelop

8
00:00:45,209 --> 00:00:46,601
the entire Bosong Village.

9
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:47,976
This long-awaited redevelopment project

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,559
had fallen through several times,

11
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:52,435
so this announcement is making everyone...

12
00:00:52,459 --> 00:00:54,418
We made it.

13
00:00:56,428 --> 00:00:58,185
We made it!

Nam Soo.

16
00:01:02,476 --> 00:01:03,744
I'm rich now!

17
00:01:03,769 --> 00:01:06,138
I'm rich now!

18
00:01:09,334 --> 00:01:10,268
Hey!

19
00:01:10,292 --> 00:01:12,479
I'm rich now!

20
00:01:14,234 --> 00:01:16,543
Did she die because you guys bullied her?

21
00:01:16,567 --> 00:01:18,876
Do you want me to die like she did?

22
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,002
I will not die like she did.

23
00:01:22,026 --> 00:01:24,168
I'll tell the whole world

24
00:01:24,192 --> 00:01:25,210
about what you did to me

25
00:01:25,234 --> 00:01:26,835
and make sure you get punished!

26
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:28,775
You little...

27
00:01:35,942 --> 00:01:37,942
Gosh.

28
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,676
What's he doing?

29
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,718
Who is he?

30
00:01:58,742 --> 00:01:59,885
No idea.

31
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:02,700
Can someone take her to the infirmary?

32
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,010
I'm fine.

33
00:02:06,034 --> 00:02:08,076
I can get there by myself.

34
00:02:11,201 --> 00:02:13,593
Man, you're all pretty awesome.

35
00:02:13,617 --> 00:02:15,801
Do rich kids play like this at school?

36
00:02:15,825 --> 00:02:17,825
Who are you?

37
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,676
Who do you think you are

38
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,885
to barge into our school?

39
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:22,825
Me?

40
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,260
I'm your teacher.

41
00:02:24,284 --> 00:02:26,326
What? - What did he say?

42
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,635
Why are you standing around?

43
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:32,926
Assemble out on the field in 10 minutes.

44
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,593
What's he saying? - No way.

45
00:02:34,617 --> 00:02:37,533
Why aren't you getting changed?

46
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,426
My name is Gu Ho Dong.

47
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:41,551
From now on,

48
00:02:41,575 --> 00:02:43,468
I'll be in charge of physical education.

49
00:02:43,492 --> 00:02:46,093
But I'm a guy with a hot temper,

50
00:02:46,117 --> 00:02:48,052
so I can't stand to see my students

51
00:02:48,076 --> 00:02:49,926
when they aren't ready for class.

52
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,385
Your classroom was a mess,

53
00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:54,052
and there was a kid hanging in the air.

54
00:02:54,076 --> 00:02:57,426
I really can't let this slide.

55
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,718
Everyone,

56
00:02:58,742 --> 00:03:00,885
10 laps around the field.

57
00:03:00,909 --> 00:03:02,436
Go!

58
00:03:05,742 --> 00:03:06,926
I don't think this is

59
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,135
a reasonable punishment.

60
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,135
We didn't do anything wrong.

61
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,718
Bae Ro Na suddenly threatened us

62
00:03:11,742 --> 00:03:13,177
and used violence.

63
00:03:13,201 --> 00:03:14,768
Is that so?

64
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:17,093
But bad news.

65
00:03:17,117 --> 00:03:19,135
This is what a teacher gets to do.

66
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:22,218
If you don't like it, be the teacher.

67
00:03:22,242 --> 00:03:23,801
Unbelievable.

68
00:03:23,825 --> 00:03:26,344
Why are you dressed like that?

69
00:03:26,368 --> 00:03:27,635
You're wearing a worn-out tracksuit

70
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:29,010
with a droopy T-shirt.

71
00:03:29,034 --> 00:03:30,426
This is humiliating.

72
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,760
Hey, if you feel bad,

73
00:03:31,784 --> 00:03:33,635
buy me something before you speak up.

74
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:34,593
Okay?

75
00:03:34,617 --> 00:03:36,135
Anyone who doesn't start running

76
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,617
will get penalty points starting now.

77
00:03:39,533 --> 00:03:42,700
Okay, I get it.

78
00:03:43,034 --> 00:03:47,242
You all get one penalty point as a group.

79
00:03:50,492 --> 00:03:52,302
And you're still here.

80
00:03:52,326 --> 00:03:54,426
You all get two more

81
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,593
penalty points.

82
00:03:55,617 --> 00:03:57,492
What?

83
00:03:58,575 --> 00:04:00,551
You all get three more

84
00:04:00,575 --> 00:04:01,885
penalty points.

85
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:02,801
All right!

86
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:03,718
Darn it.

87
00:04:03,742 --> 00:04:04,635
That's it!

88
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:06,385
You can run pretty well.

89
00:04:06,409 --> 00:04:07,926
All right!

90
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,867
One, two.

91
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,593
You're a student.

92
00:04:13,617 --> 00:04:14,885
Shouldn't you be reading books

93
00:04:14,909 --> 00:04:17,034
instead of watching TV?

94
00:04:18,368 --> 00:04:20,385
It's over.

95
00:04:20,409 --> 00:04:21,551
The redevelopment was announced

96
00:04:21,575 --> 00:04:23,635
before she signed the contract.

97
00:04:23,659 --> 00:04:25,593
But, you know,

98
00:04:25,617 --> 00:04:29,385
that woman Oh Yoon Hee is awfully lucky.

99
00:04:29,409 --> 00:04:32,344
She really gets on my nerves.

100
00:04:32,368 --> 00:04:34,575
All right. We'll talk again later.

101
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:36,801
You're here.

102
00:04:36,825 --> 00:04:38,593
You must be busy. You didn't have to come.

103
00:04:38,617 --> 00:04:40,010
My wife is starting her business.

104
00:04:40,034 --> 00:04:41,760
Of course, I have to stop by.

105
00:04:41,784 --> 00:04:43,760
Now that you've begun, do a great job.

106
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:46,177
And feel free to quit whenever you want.

107
00:04:46,201 --> 00:04:47,177
And these are

108
00:04:47,201 --> 00:04:49,385
the flowers you wanted.

109
00:04:49,409 --> 00:04:51,344
You got me black roses.

110
00:04:51,368 --> 00:04:53,284
Thank you.

111
00:04:54,825 --> 00:04:56,718
Do you know what black roses mean?

112
00:04:56,742 --> 00:04:58,575
I'm not sure.

113
00:05:00,784 --> 00:05:03,533
"You're mine forever."

114
00:05:03,992 --> 00:05:06,076
And there's another meaning.

115
00:05:06,575 --> 00:05:08,426
Hatred.

116
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,409
I see.

117
00:05:14,368 --> 00:05:15,344
What's wrong?

118
00:05:15,368 --> 00:05:17,135
You got the energy to fight with a friend,

119
00:05:17,159 --> 00:05:19,201
but no energy to run?

120
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,885
All right.

121
00:05:20,909 --> 00:05:23,450
Six more laps.

122
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:26,302
Whoa, hey! - Seok Kyung!

123
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,302
Seok Kyung!

124
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:28,426
Seok Kyung, wake up. - Seok Kyung!

125
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:29,426
Seok Kyung, what's wrong?

126
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,052
Wake up, Seok Kyung.

127
00:05:31,076 --> 00:05:33,968
Settle down. Stop right there.

128
00:05:33,992 --> 00:05:35,718
Stay still.

129
00:05:36,284 --> 00:05:37,551
Hey.

130
00:05:37,575 --> 00:05:39,426
Stop putting on a show,

131
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:40,926
and get up in the count of three.

132
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:43,260
If you don't, you get 10 penalty points.

133
00:05:43,284 --> 00:05:44,385
What did he say? - 10 penalty points.

134
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:45,959
One.

135
00:05:46,368 --> 00:05:48,135
Two.

136
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,052
Three!

137
00:05:49,076 --> 00:05:50,010
What kind of a teacher are you?

138
00:05:50,034 --> 00:05:52,426
What if something bad happens to her?

139
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,076
I'm taking her to the infirmary right now.

140
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,385
Seok Kyung.

141
00:05:57,409 --> 00:05:59,368
Get up.

142
00:06:04,326 --> 00:06:06,426
It's elegant yet lovely.

143
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,885
It's perfect for you, Sang A.

144
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:12,426
Gosh, this design is too ordinary.

145
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,885
You do have the dress Kendall Jenner wore

146
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:17,135
during the closing performance

147
00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:18,509
of the haute couture show, right?

148
00:06:18,533 --> 00:06:19,593
I'll take that.

149
00:06:19,617 --> 00:06:22,159
This way, please, ma'am.

150
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:31,926
These dress shoes, clothes, and shoes.

151
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,926
How many did she just get?

152
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:37,492
She might as well open a department store.

153
00:06:40,575 --> 00:06:42,635
The redevelopment for Bosong Village,

154
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:45,093
the biggest redevelopment in history,

155
00:06:45,117 --> 00:06:46,676
began to take form.

156
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,385
Big-name construction firms began

157
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:49,801
the promotion to take part in this project

158
00:06:49,825 --> 00:06:51,010
as the government is about to announce

159
00:06:51,034 --> 00:06:52,052
which firms will be in charge.

160
00:06:52,076 --> 00:06:53,344
Wait. - The fight could become worse

161
00:06:53,368 --> 00:06:54,593
That place. - as they slander each other

162
00:06:54,617 --> 00:06:56,676
Will it get redeveloped? - to get chosen.

163
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,426
Then, - The project committee said

164
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,801
that annoying brat... - they'll select...

165
00:07:00,825 --> 00:07:03,635
will become filthy rich?

166
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:05,718
Who's this annoying brat?

167
00:07:05,742 --> 00:07:07,385
Bae Ro Na's mum. Who else?

168
00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:08,344
Look.

169
00:07:08,368 --> 00:07:11,344
Bosong Village will get redeveloped.

170
00:07:11,368 --> 00:07:13,426
If any construction firm offers a bribe...

171
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,843
I can't believe this.

172
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:17,426
Did she know this when she bought it?

173
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,635
No way.

174
00:07:18,659 --> 00:07:20,635
Even I didn't hear anything about it.

175
00:07:20,659 --> 00:07:23,551
That annoying woman couldn't have known.

176
00:07:23,575 --> 00:07:25,093
My big sisters

177
00:07:25,117 --> 00:07:27,426
wouldn't miss a chance like this.

178
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:30,659
The redevelopment for Bosong is finalised.

179
00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:39,492
Yes, Oh Yoon Hee.

180
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:43,242
We're getting a fresh start.

181
00:07:45,201 --> 00:07:48,218
Ro Na, give me a little more time.

182
00:07:48,242 --> 00:07:49,885
I'll make sure

183
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:52,450
I'll let you move in there.

184
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,093
Write down everything honestly.

185
00:08:14,117 --> 00:08:16,177
Why did you break the plaster figure?

186
00:08:16,201 --> 00:08:17,926
Why were you on the rails in the hallway?

187
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,426
Why did you swing that mop

188
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:21,177
at the other kids?

189
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:24,344
"Counselling"

190
00:08:24,368 --> 00:08:25,551
Ro Na!

191
00:08:25,575 --> 00:08:27,344
Are you all right?

192
00:08:27,368 --> 00:08:28,551
What happened?

193
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:30,492
Are you hurt?

194
00:08:31,117 --> 00:08:32,344
What's wrong with your neck?

195
00:08:32,368 --> 00:08:33,801
Did you hurt your neck?

196
00:08:33,825 --> 00:08:35,135
Of all places?

197
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,885
How bad is it?

198
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:39,034
None of your business. It's nothing.

199
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,867
She put on a suicide show.

200
00:08:44,284 --> 00:08:47,575
Why are you here?

201
00:08:48,117 --> 00:08:50,676
Hello. I'm Ro Na's teacher.

202
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,242
What? You're her teacher?

203
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:56,093
A crook can't be a teacher.

204
00:08:56,117 --> 00:08:59,034
I'm glad I ran into you, you jerk!

205
00:08:59,533 --> 00:09:01,492
Darn it!

206
00:09:04,575 --> 00:09:06,676
10 laps around the field?

207
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,718
Kids who study vocal music

208
00:09:07,742 --> 00:09:09,177
use their bodies as their instruments.

209
00:09:09,201 --> 00:09:12,593
They didn't want to have a PE class,

210
00:09:12,617 --> 00:09:14,135
so I simply gave them penalty points.

211
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:16,509
You need to revoke those points now.

212
00:09:16,533 --> 00:09:19,593
Their parents already filed complaints.

213
00:09:19,617 --> 00:09:22,825
It can't do you any good to cause trouble

214
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:25,242
after your first class.

215
00:09:27,076 --> 00:09:28,676
I see. All right.

216
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,968
I'll be careful, Ms Cheon.

217
00:09:30,992 --> 00:09:32,426
But, you know,

218
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:33,718
aren't teachers

219
00:09:33,742 --> 00:09:36,135
allowed to give out penalty points?

220
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,284
Mr Gu Ho Dong.

221
00:09:41,409 --> 00:09:43,135
We need to talk,

222
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:45,010
Head of Arts, Ms Cheon Seo Jin.

223
00:09:45,034 --> 00:09:46,135
What is it?

224
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:47,760
Mr Ma Doo Ki...

225
00:09:47,784 --> 00:09:51,509
No. Why is this con man in this school?

226
00:09:51,533 --> 00:09:52,926
I need you to explain.

227
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:55,344
Why is it a problem for a good teacher

228
00:09:55,368 --> 00:09:57,426
to teach at Cheonga Arts High?

229
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,968
Ro Na almost didn't get into this school

230
00:09:58,992 --> 00:10:00,718
because of this man.

231
00:10:00,742 --> 00:10:02,177
He gave us false information on purpose--

232
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:03,302
Why should I be aware

233
00:10:03,326 --> 00:10:05,135
of your personal business?

234
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:06,302
If you have trouble with him,

235
00:10:06,326 --> 00:10:08,575
resolve it between you two.

236
00:10:08,825 --> 00:10:10,784
Before you go there,

237
00:10:11,742 --> 00:10:14,385
Ro Na caused another trouble today.

238
00:10:14,409 --> 00:10:16,551
How in the world did you educate her

239
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:17,718
for her to put on a suicide show,

240
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,302
interrupt other kids' studies,

241
00:10:19,326 --> 00:10:21,635
and damage school properties?

242
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:22,676
You shouldn't be talking loud right now

243
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,426
if you knew that already.

244
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,676
She'll face severe disciplinary action

245
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,760
from the reward and punishment committee.

246
00:10:27,784 --> 00:10:30,201
She should be prepared to face that.

247
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:33,635
Don't you care about how my girl got hurt?

248
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:36,034
You're a teacher!

249
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,177
This is the staff room.

250
00:10:44,201 --> 00:10:46,426
Stop shouting loudly like an idiot.

251
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,509
If you feel that bad

252
00:10:47,533 --> 00:10:49,135
for your daughter who got hurt,

253
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:51,718
why don't you take the punishment instead?

254
00:10:51,742 --> 00:10:53,426
She has so many penalty points

255
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,593
that it wouldn't be enough

256
00:10:54,617 --> 00:10:56,700
even if you cleaned the school all day.

257
00:11:14,533 --> 00:11:15,718
Hey, Bae Ro Na!

258
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:17,093
We had to run laps during PE today

259
00:11:17,117 --> 00:11:18,551
because of you!

260
00:11:18,575 --> 00:11:20,718
We all got penalty points because of you.

261
00:11:20,742 --> 00:11:22,177
How are you going to fix this?

262
00:11:22,201 --> 00:11:25,034
Why should I care about your penalty?

263
00:11:27,242 --> 00:11:29,926
You're just like your mum.

264
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,760
Don't bring my mum into this.

265
00:11:31,784 --> 00:11:33,426
Haven't you had enough bullying me?

266
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:34,968
You didn't know?

267
00:11:34,992 --> 00:11:37,135
Your mum put on a suicide show

268
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:38,926
while she studied at Cheonga Arts High.

269
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:42,076
That's why the Art Festival was revoked.

270
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,426
What? - Really?

271
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:45,052
It was Bae Ro Na's mum? - No way.

272
00:11:45,076 --> 00:11:46,052
A girl got jealous

273
00:11:46,076 --> 00:11:47,843
of the grand prize winner,

274
00:11:47,867 --> 00:11:51,825
so she cut her neck with the trophy.

275
00:11:52,034 --> 00:11:54,450
Sliced.

276
00:11:55,201 --> 00:11:57,052
Seriously?

277
00:11:57,076 --> 00:11:58,551
Then the girl who cut her neck

278
00:11:58,575 --> 00:12:00,177
with the trophy was...

279
00:12:00,201 --> 00:12:02,385
Gosh! I got chills.

280
00:12:02,409 --> 00:12:04,093
That's gross. - That's awful.

281
00:12:04,117 --> 00:12:05,302
Stop lying!

282
00:12:05,326 --> 00:12:06,344
If you don't believe me,

283
00:12:06,368 --> 00:12:09,326
go ask your mum yourself.

284
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:11,468
Oh, well.

285
00:12:11,492 --> 00:12:12,509
She might be too ashamed

286
00:12:12,533 --> 00:12:15,076
to tell you the truth.

287
00:12:24,575 --> 00:12:26,426
What?

288
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,052
Ha Eun Byeol is

289
00:12:28,076 --> 00:12:30,426
Ms Cheon Seo Jin's daughter?

290
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,326
Quiet.

291
00:12:33,368 --> 00:12:34,885
So you'd better behave

292
00:12:34,909 --> 00:12:36,509
if you want your life to be easy at work.

293
00:12:36,533 --> 00:12:38,426
Your life at this school will be different

294
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,760
depending on which side you take.

295
00:12:40,784 --> 00:12:41,676
All right.

296
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,635
Our school's main focus is in music,

297
00:12:43,659 --> 00:12:45,344
so working as an assistant teacher

298
00:12:45,368 --> 00:12:46,426
in the music department is a big chance.

299
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,968
I see. My goodness.

300
00:12:47,992 --> 00:12:50,177
I almost made a huge mistake.

301
00:12:50,201 --> 00:12:52,117
Take this.

302
00:12:52,533 --> 00:12:54,010
It's a list of students

303
00:12:54,034 --> 00:12:55,218
who are to receive special care.

304
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:56,385
My gosh.

305
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:58,926
You're obviously from the country.

306
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,801
If you want to stay with our foundation

307
00:13:00,825 --> 00:13:01,968
until the day you retire,

308
00:13:01,992 --> 00:13:04,177
you know how to behave, don't you?

309
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:05,760
Yes, of course.

310
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:08,468
I notice things pretty quickly.

311
00:13:08,492 --> 00:13:10,885
Gosh, thank you.

312
00:13:10,909 --> 00:13:14,344
I ask for your continuous guidance.

313
00:13:14,368 --> 00:13:16,950
You should brush your teeth first.

314
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,218
"Joo Seok Hoon, Joo Seok Kyung,

315
00:13:26,242 --> 00:13:27,385
Ha Eun Byeol,

316
00:13:27,409 --> 00:13:28,593
Lee Min Hyuk,

317
00:13:28,617 --> 00:13:29,801
and Yoo Je Ni."

318
00:13:29,825 --> 00:13:31,909
All memorised.

319
00:13:33,326 --> 00:13:34,801
Come in, Dr Ha.

320
00:13:34,825 --> 00:13:36,801
I'm sorry. My surgery ran late.

321
00:13:36,825 --> 00:13:39,659
It must've been a tough day.

322
00:13:43,242 --> 00:13:44,968
I wanted to see you for an investment.

323
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:46,052
This project is

324
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:47,635
completely on another level

325
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:49,177
compared to our previous investments.

326
00:13:49,201 --> 00:13:50,968
We'll have to invest a historical amount.

327
00:13:50,992 --> 00:13:52,218
How much?

328
00:13:52,242 --> 00:13:53,593
150 billion won.

329
00:13:53,617 --> 00:13:55,509
What?

330
00:13:55,533 --> 00:13:57,426
But this is a promising investment

331
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:58,676
which will return 300 billion in 6 months.

332
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,575
Wait, is it that land in Myeong-dong?

333
00:14:03,117 --> 00:14:04,093
Now...

334
00:14:04,117 --> 00:14:05,760
"Myeong-dong"

335
00:14:05,784 --> 00:14:07,260
The biggest shopping district in Korea

336
00:14:07,284 --> 00:14:08,551
will be built here.

337
00:14:08,575 --> 00:14:10,718
Try to find as much money as you can.

338
00:14:10,742 --> 00:14:12,635
I guarantee at least fivefold of profit.

339
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:14,218
Fivefold?

340
00:14:14,242 --> 00:14:15,509
If we put in a billion,

341
00:14:15,533 --> 00:14:16,426
we'll get five billion?

342
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:18,177
If we put in 10 billion,

343
00:14:18,201 --> 00:14:19,593
we'll get 50 billion?

344
00:14:19,617 --> 00:14:21,492
Billions and billions!

345
00:14:22,867 --> 00:14:25,385
Man, this makes me want to scream.

346
00:14:25,409 --> 00:14:27,135
But the problem is that stubborn old man

347
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:28,135
who won't sell his place

348
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,177
in the dead centre of the area.

349
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,426
I thought it couldn't be redeveloped

350
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:32,135
because he refused to sell his place?

351
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:33,843
That place is put up for an auction too.

352
00:14:33,867 --> 00:14:34,926
I put some pressure on the bank

353
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,010
to cut off his funding,

354
00:14:36,034 --> 00:14:37,885
so he had no other choice.

355
00:14:37,909 --> 00:14:40,218
Once we land that house in the auction,

356
00:14:40,242 --> 00:14:41,843
it'll be game over.

357
00:14:41,867 --> 00:14:43,676
There's absolutely

358
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,992
no stumbling block in our plan.

359
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:50,659
Man, you're such an awesome guy.

360
00:14:50,742 --> 00:14:54,344
I mean, it's you, Chairman Joo.

361
00:14:54,368 --> 00:14:56,509
A guy who makes something from nothing,

362
00:14:56,533 --> 00:14:57,551
like a deity!

363
00:14:57,575 --> 00:14:59,492
The best.

364
00:14:59,533 --> 00:15:01,135
"Recording on phone"

365
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:02,426
Right?

366
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:06,617
I plan on betting all my profits on this.

367
00:15:09,912 --> 00:15:10,926
"Saved"

368
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:14,034
"Jakomo, CEO Sim Soo Ryeon"

369
00:15:15,492 --> 00:15:17,450
Joo Dan Tae.

370
00:15:19,617 --> 00:15:22,076
You'll soon meet someone

371
00:15:22,867 --> 00:15:25,284
who'll become your enemy

372
00:15:27,076 --> 00:15:29,201
and your friend.

373
00:15:38,867 --> 00:15:41,450
What a sight.

374
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:53,968
It's heartrending to see a mother

375
00:15:53,992 --> 00:15:56,635
patching up her girl's trouble.

376
00:15:56,659 --> 00:15:58,052
Is it true?

377
00:15:58,076 --> 00:15:59,843
That you moved to Min Seol A's place?

378
00:15:59,867 --> 00:16:02,260
You seem very interested in my business.

379
00:16:02,284 --> 00:16:05,052
She and her daughter are awfully lucky.

380
00:16:05,076 --> 00:16:07,010
She's just waiting for money to roll in.

381
00:16:07,034 --> 00:16:09,093
Even so, isn't it horrifying to live

382
00:16:09,117 --> 00:16:10,718
in a house where someone died,

383
00:16:10,742 --> 00:16:13,052
no matter how much you like money?

384
00:16:13,076 --> 00:16:15,492
My gosh.

385
00:16:16,825 --> 00:16:19,676
Yes, I like money.

386
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,635
Why?

387
00:16:20,659 --> 00:16:22,718
Jealous my house price has skyrocketed?

388
00:16:22,742 --> 00:16:24,843
If you're jealous, just say so.

389
00:16:24,867 --> 00:16:26,843
Why would I be jealous of you?

390
00:16:26,867 --> 00:16:28,676
Because you're cleaning the toilet?

391
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,468
Or your tiny house in Bosong Village?

392
00:16:30,492 --> 00:16:31,760
Or because your kid

393
00:16:31,784 --> 00:16:32,885
has a lot of penalty points?

394
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:34,801
Exactly.

395
00:16:34,825 --> 00:16:36,718
Stop minding my business.

396
00:16:36,742 --> 00:16:38,135
If you have absolutely nothing to do,

397
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:41,201
sit at home and count your money.

398
00:16:41,326 --> 00:16:42,885
There's the bell.

399
00:16:42,909 --> 00:16:45,076
Aren't you here for your kids?

400
00:16:45,617 --> 00:16:47,617
Goodness!

401
00:16:48,825 --> 00:16:51,533
That crazy woman!

402
00:16:52,201 --> 00:16:54,450
I'll rip apart that darned mouth.

403
00:16:54,659 --> 00:16:56,718
Sorry.

404
00:16:56,742 --> 00:16:58,426
Gosh, that must be my princess.

405
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,450
Sorry.

406
00:17:17,617 --> 00:17:19,302
It's me.

407
00:17:19,326 --> 00:17:20,885
I might be able to get off early tomorrow.

408
00:17:20,909 --> 00:17:22,052
Are you free?

409
00:17:22,076 --> 00:17:24,885
Gosh, I'm all for it.

410
00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:27,177
I reserved a very popular place.

411
00:17:27,201 --> 00:17:29,201
See you tomorrow.

412
00:17:37,409 --> 00:17:39,533
My goodness!

413
00:17:39,742 --> 00:17:41,468
Who just called?

414
00:17:41,492 --> 00:17:43,302
A concert promoter

415
00:17:43,326 --> 00:17:45,575
asked me to do a solo recital.

416
00:17:46,242 --> 00:17:48,492
You must be in a good mood.

417
00:17:48,575 --> 00:17:49,843
Right.

418
00:17:49,867 --> 00:17:51,218
Why did you have to see your father

419
00:17:51,242 --> 00:17:52,843
on that day?

420
00:17:52,867 --> 00:17:54,718
He suddenly called you late then.

421
00:17:54,742 --> 00:17:57,177
Because of the foundation, obviously.

422
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,218
I guess he got worried

423
00:17:58,242 --> 00:18:00,284
after he let me take charge.

424
00:18:00,825 --> 00:18:03,409
Why do you suddenly ask?

425
00:18:04,533 --> 00:18:06,676
You hate it when I get curious,

426
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,718
and you hate it when I don't care.

427
00:18:08,742 --> 00:18:12,159
What in the world do you want?

428
00:18:15,409 --> 00:18:17,093
If you want credit for everything you do,

429
00:18:17,117 --> 00:18:18,260
then don't do anything.

430
00:18:18,284 --> 00:18:19,260
Don't ask me questions

431
00:18:19,284 --> 00:18:21,260
and don't get curious.

432
00:18:21,284 --> 00:18:23,368
Then we'll be fine.

433
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:53,926
"Sushi Bar Eobujiri"

434
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,676
"Dear Ms Cheon Seo Jin,"

435
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,344
"Here are your reservation details."

436
00:18:57,368 --> 00:18:58,885
"March 5, 2020, Table for two"

437
00:18:58,909 --> 00:19:00,302
"The superstar of Hera Palace"

438
00:19:00,326 --> 00:19:01,551
"The cutest and youngest"

439
00:19:01,575 --> 00:19:04,450
"of the Lee family, Lee Kyu Jin"

440
00:19:11,825 --> 00:19:15,950
You capture my heart

441
00:19:16,034 --> 00:19:20,159
Samba, samba, samba

442
00:19:20,575 --> 00:19:22,784
You're dancing

443
00:19:33,784 --> 00:19:35,218
It's the same

444
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:37,177
Do you think I'll go down?

445
00:19:37,201 --> 00:19:39,385
Do you think I'll go down?

446
00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:40,551
People say my life will end

447
00:19:40,575 --> 00:19:41,843
If I keep living it like this

448
00:19:41,867 --> 00:19:42,843
"Mum, I love you"

449
00:19:42,867 --> 00:19:44,093
One, two, three, four!

450
00:19:44,117 --> 00:19:45,968
Bounce with me, bounce with me

451
00:19:45,992 --> 00:19:47,426
Bounce with me, bounce

452
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:48,697
Mum.

453
00:19:49,825 --> 00:19:52,659
You're the best!

454
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,676
It has been so long

455
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,385
since I saw your talent show.

456
00:19:55,409 --> 00:19:57,760
I'm feeling great. Marvellous!

457
00:19:57,784 --> 00:19:59,260
Then, Mi Ja,

458
00:19:59,284 --> 00:20:01,177
give me some pocket money!

459
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:02,344
You have some emergency fund

460
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:03,801
that your husband doesn't know about.

461
00:20:03,825 --> 00:20:05,426
This is Kyu Jin's wish.

462
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:07,218
You'll do it for me, won't you?

463
00:20:07,242 --> 00:20:08,801
All right, Kyu Jin.

464
00:20:08,825 --> 00:20:11,509
How much do you need? How much?

465
00:20:11,533 --> 00:20:13,218
I always give you

466
00:20:13,242 --> 00:20:16,450
whatever you wanted, my baby.

467
00:20:17,659 --> 00:20:20,533
Mi Ja! Should I sing another song?

468
00:20:23,076 --> 00:20:24,426
It must be tough.

469
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:26,700
Have some red ginseng extract.

470
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:28,593
How's your new tutor?

471
00:20:28,617 --> 00:20:29,926
Do you like her?

472
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,480
She's not bad.

473
00:20:38,867 --> 00:20:40,926
Did you kill her?

474
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,426
Min Seol A was in the mechanical room

475
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,700
of Hera Palace on that day.

476
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,326
I know that.

477
00:20:54,034 --> 00:20:56,326
Don't you owe me an explanation?

478
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:58,885
Why did you say something that strange?

479
00:20:58,909 --> 00:21:01,426
That I killed Min Seol A.

480
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:03,867
What's your ground?

481
00:21:04,825 --> 00:21:08,076
Min Seol A died at Hera Palace.

482
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,909
No?

483
00:21:12,034 --> 00:21:13,635
You locked her up in the mechanical room.

484
00:21:13,659 --> 00:21:14,843
Who says so?

485
00:21:14,867 --> 00:21:15,760
Where did you hear this nonsense?

486
00:21:15,784 --> 00:21:16,885
You need to answer me first

487
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:19,409
before you get an answer out of me.

488
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,326
Did you really kill Min Seol A?

489
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:26,302
Why should I?

490
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,344
Why should I get my hands dirty

491
00:21:28,368 --> 00:21:31,450
to get rid of a kid like her?

492
00:21:33,034 --> 00:21:35,034
If you didn't, forget it.

493
00:21:35,326 --> 00:21:37,201
Good night.

494
00:21:39,575 --> 00:21:41,575
Joo Seok Hoon.

495
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:47,159
What did you see?

496
00:21:57,742 --> 00:21:59,426
No one would go looking for Min Seol A

497
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,344
in the mechanical room, right?

498
00:22:01,368 --> 00:22:03,575
What if

499
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:06,492
she exposes our relationship?

500
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,760
Who would believe her?

501
00:22:09,784 --> 00:22:10,718
Everyone would think

502
00:22:10,742 --> 00:22:12,635
a crazy girl is throwing a fit.

503
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:14,926
We just need to find that darned phone.

504
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,885
She's not an ordinary girl.

505
00:22:16,909 --> 00:22:18,344
If you think she's easy to deal with,

506
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:20,533
we might end up taking a blow.

507
00:22:35,076 --> 00:22:37,867
Dad and Ms Cheon.

508
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:41,034
Both of you are disgusting.

509
00:22:46,409 --> 00:22:48,843
What did you guys do to Min Seol A?

510
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:51,218
Did she die because you guys bullied her?

511
00:22:51,242 --> 00:22:54,117
Do you want me to die like she did?

512
00:22:57,909 --> 00:22:59,843
Pull yourself together, Eun Byeol.

513
00:22:59,867 --> 00:23:02,450
Don't worry about something like that.

514
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,843
Eun Byeol.

515
00:23:15,867 --> 00:23:17,760
It's great to see you got better grades.

516
00:23:17,784 --> 00:23:19,468
Maths isn't that hard, is it?

517
00:23:19,492 --> 00:23:21,426
Don't worry about Seok Kyung too much.

518
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:23,468
You can do things at your speed.

519
00:23:23,492 --> 00:23:25,676
I really love how you work very hard.

520
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,950
"Anna"

521
00:23:31,117 --> 00:23:33,034
Why did you rip that?

522
00:23:37,492 --> 00:23:39,885
Go away, Min Seol A.

523
00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:41,052
Eun Byeol.

524
00:23:41,076 --> 00:23:42,801
No, stop coming.

525
00:23:42,825 --> 00:23:44,784
What's wrong?

526
00:23:45,742 --> 00:23:47,344
I didn't do anything.

527
00:23:47,368 --> 00:23:49,509
Get lost!

528
00:23:49,533 --> 00:23:51,825
Get a grip, Ha Eun Byeol!

529
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,260
Min Seol A...

530
00:23:57,284 --> 00:23:58,344
What are you talking about?

531
00:23:58,368 --> 00:24:00,533
Min Seol A?

532
00:24:00,825 --> 00:24:02,426
Are you seeing things?

533
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:05,034
It was Min Seol A.

534
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:06,885
I'm scared.

535
00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:09,052
I'm so scared I might go insane.

536
00:24:09,076 --> 00:24:10,885
Min Seol A died!

537
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:12,843
No, I just saw her.

538
00:24:12,867 --> 00:24:15,742
She came into my room.

539
00:24:17,825 --> 00:24:19,926
I knew it was weird how Bae Ro Na

540
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:21,926
moved into Min Seol A's place.

541
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,635
Maybe there's a tie between

542
00:24:23,659 --> 00:24:25,551
Bae Ro Na and Min Seol A.

543
00:24:25,575 --> 00:24:27,344
What if she came to Cheonga Arts High

544
00:24:27,368 --> 00:24:29,950
to get Min Seol A's revenge?

545
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,302
What if...

546
00:24:32,326 --> 00:24:35,093
What if Min Seol A is still alive?

547
00:24:35,117 --> 00:24:37,135
Will you please get real?

548
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:39,010
I'm scared.

549
00:24:39,034 --> 00:24:40,218
I'm scared.

550
00:24:40,242 --> 00:24:42,159
I'm scared.

551
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:44,344
Get up.

552
00:24:44,368 --> 00:24:46,368
Get up, right now!

553
00:24:46,575 --> 00:24:48,492
Get up!

554
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:49,885
Follow me. - I'm scared.

555
00:24:49,909 --> 00:24:52,159
Where are we going?

556
00:24:54,742 --> 00:24:56,302
The mechanical room?

557
00:24:56,326 --> 00:24:58,344
Min Seol A died here.

558
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,926
Yes, she died here.

559
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,843
Like you said, she died.

560
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:03,509
She can't come back.

561
00:25:03,533 --> 00:25:05,218
No, I'm scared.

562
00:25:05,242 --> 00:25:06,843
I don't want to be here.

563
00:25:06,867 --> 00:25:08,950
Do as I say!

564
00:25:12,617 --> 00:25:15,052
Listen up to what I'm about to say.

565
00:25:15,076 --> 00:25:16,760
If you can't get rid of Min Seol A,

566
00:25:16,784 --> 00:25:18,760
you won't be able to do anything.

567
00:25:18,784 --> 00:25:20,426
You need to overcome this yourself.

568
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:21,801
If you don't, you'll lose against

569
00:25:21,825 --> 00:25:23,950
both Min Seol A and Bae Ro Na.

570
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:28,344
I told you

571
00:25:28,368 --> 00:25:29,468
about the wicked relationship

572
00:25:29,492 --> 00:25:30,885
between Bae Ro Na's mum and me.

573
00:25:30,909 --> 00:25:31,968
She cut herself

574
00:25:31,992 --> 00:25:34,177
and tried to blame it on me.

575
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:35,468
That's what this industry is like.

576
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:37,635
People will do anything to win.

577
00:25:37,659 --> 00:25:38,885
How can you win against Bae Ro Na

578
00:25:38,909 --> 00:25:40,468
with that feeble mind of yours?

579
00:25:40,492 --> 00:25:42,010
You can't keep your mind under control.

580
00:25:42,034 --> 00:25:43,010
You see things

581
00:25:43,034 --> 00:25:44,950
and throw a fit.

582
00:25:45,034 --> 00:25:46,218
How can you win the grand prize

583
00:25:46,242 --> 00:25:48,450
at the Cheonga Arts Festival?

584
00:25:49,117 --> 00:25:50,718
You need to overcome this by yourself.

585
00:25:50,742 --> 00:25:51,843
Get rid of Min Seol A from your head.

586
00:25:51,867 --> 00:25:54,409
Only then, you'll win against Bae Ro Na.

587
00:25:54,492 --> 00:25:56,575
I don't care about other things.

588
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:00,676
But I will not condone it

589
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,784
if you lose against Bae Ro Na.

590
00:26:03,326 --> 00:26:05,385
I want to win too.

591
00:26:05,409 --> 00:26:08,135
I want to win desperately too!

592
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,784
Then do better. You can win.

593
00:26:11,992 --> 00:26:13,093
You know "Sempre Libera"

594
00:26:13,117 --> 00:26:15,368
from Verdi's opera, don't you?

595
00:26:16,368 --> 00:26:17,426
Min Seol A sang that song

596
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,426
for her high school audition.

597
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:22,034
You'll practise that song starting now.

598
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:23,843
Right here?

599
00:26:23,867 --> 00:26:26,551
How can I sing in this room?

600
00:26:26,575 --> 00:26:29,010
You have to if you want to overcome this.

601
00:26:29,034 --> 00:26:30,135
Don't dream of Seoul University of Music

602
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,492
with a weak mindset like yours.

603
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:35,926
You need to be the best

604
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,843
for me to become the chief director

605
00:26:37,867 --> 00:26:40,344
of Cheonga Foundation.

606
00:26:40,368 --> 00:26:42,533
Do you understand?

607
00:26:43,076 --> 00:26:44,843
But still,

608
00:26:44,867 --> 00:26:45,968
I can't...

609
00:26:45,992 --> 00:26:47,618
Can you do this?

610
00:26:48,326 --> 00:26:50,551
I'll be outside.

611
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:52,135
You have to sing very loudly

612
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,575
so that I can hear you out there.

613
00:26:55,326 --> 00:26:56,385
If I don't like it,

614
00:26:56,409 --> 00:26:58,010
you'll be locked up in here all night.

615
00:26:58,034 --> 00:27:00,034
You'd better do a good job.

616
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:05,135
Mum!

617
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:06,218
Mum!

618
00:27:06,242 --> 00:27:09,593
You can't leave me here alone, Mum!

619
00:27:09,617 --> 00:27:11,575
Mum!

620
00:28:37,117 --> 00:28:38,801
Hello?

621
00:28:38,825 --> 00:28:40,551
Ms Oh?

622
00:28:40,575 --> 00:28:43,326
Ro Na isn't home yet.

623
00:28:43,492 --> 00:28:44,509
It looks like

624
00:28:44,533 --> 00:28:46,950
something happened at school today.

625
00:28:47,242 --> 00:28:49,950
I hope she didn't get wrong ideas.

626
00:28:51,117 --> 00:28:53,867
I'm worried to death.

627
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:02,426
You didn't know?

628
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,135
Your mum put on a suicide show

629
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,593
while she studied at Cheonga Arts High.

630
00:29:05,617 --> 00:29:07,135
But then,

631
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:08,426
it's a shameful past.

632
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:10,801
It's best your daughter doesn't know.

633
00:29:10,825 --> 00:29:13,052
You got too greedy

634
00:29:13,076 --> 00:29:14,177
and got punished

635
00:29:14,201 --> 00:29:16,575
for wanting what isn't yours.

636
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,867
That's why

637
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:25,117
Ms Cheon hated me so much.

638
00:29:39,159 --> 00:29:41,117
You poor thing.

639
00:29:41,742 --> 00:29:43,867
Don't you have a home?

640
00:29:43,909 --> 00:29:45,992
Did someone abandon you?

641
00:29:48,742 --> 00:29:51,368
Where are you going? It's dangerous.

642
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:53,575
Be careful.

643
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:02,450
Ro Na.

644
00:30:03,992 --> 00:30:05,010
Ms Sim.

645
00:30:05,034 --> 00:30:06,177
What are you doing here?

646
00:30:06,201 --> 00:30:08,450
Your mum is worried about you.

647
00:30:19,242 --> 00:30:21,326
What's wrong?

648
00:30:23,284 --> 00:30:25,409
No, nothing.

649
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:28,076
Let's get you home.

650
00:30:37,659 --> 00:30:39,968
Thank you for the ride, Ms Sim.

651
00:30:39,992 --> 00:30:41,909
Take this.

652
00:30:42,284 --> 00:30:44,450
You'll need these right away.

653
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,574
Thank you.

654
00:30:47,368 --> 00:30:48,702
Ro Na.

655
00:30:51,284 --> 00:30:53,260
Can you send me

656
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:55,843
your dog's photo from time to time?

657
00:30:55,867 --> 00:30:57,302
I'll want to know how she's doing.

658
00:30:57,326 --> 00:30:58,802
Of course.

659
00:30:59,575 --> 00:31:00,968
Goodbye.

660
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:02,177
Bye.

661
00:31:02,201 --> 00:31:04,068
Ro Na!

662
00:31:06,409 --> 00:31:09,117
What happened to you?

663
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,076
Thank you.

664
00:31:12,201 --> 00:31:13,468
Goodness.

665
00:31:13,492 --> 00:31:16,135
I was so worried about you!

666
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:17,968
Where have you been?

667
00:31:17,992 --> 00:31:20,950
And why was your phone turned off?

668
00:31:21,326 --> 00:31:22,426
Hey.

669
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:24,468
And what's this dog?

670
00:31:24,492 --> 00:31:26,302
I think she's homeless.

671
00:31:26,326 --> 00:31:28,885
I'm keeping her as of today.

672
00:31:28,909 --> 00:31:29,885
What?

673
00:31:29,909 --> 00:31:31,093
You can't keep a dog

674
00:31:31,117 --> 00:31:33,909
in that tiny, little house.

675
00:31:34,242 --> 00:31:36,302
I'm keeping her because I have to be here.

676
00:31:36,326 --> 00:31:38,502
So don't try to stop me.

677
00:31:39,885 --> 00:31:41,035
Hey.

678
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:47,600
What?

679
00:31:48,326 --> 00:31:49,885
I heard everything.

680
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:51,260
I know why you and Ms Cheon have

681
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:53,093
such a bad relationship,

682
00:31:53,117 --> 00:31:54,551
why you quit singing,

683
00:31:54,575 --> 00:31:56,885
and about that scar on your neck.

684
00:31:56,909 --> 00:31:58,611
I heard everything.

685
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:00,302
Ro Na.

686
00:32:00,326 --> 00:32:02,344
I heard you hurt yourself

687
00:32:02,368 --> 00:32:03,385
trying to take the trophy

688
00:32:03,409 --> 00:32:05,513
after the Cheonga Arts Festival.

689
00:32:07,201 --> 00:32:08,431
No.

690
00:32:09,034 --> 00:32:10,760
Nothing like that happened.

691
00:32:10,784 --> 00:32:12,353
I...

692
00:32:13,617 --> 00:32:15,825
Why won't you keep talking?

693
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:17,821
Did you really do that?

694
00:32:17,992 --> 00:32:19,093
Did you hurt your neck yourself

695
00:32:19,117 --> 00:32:21,093
because you got jealous of Ms Cheon?

696
00:32:21,117 --> 00:32:22,802
Did you?

697
00:32:25,617 --> 00:32:27,901
You won't trust me either.

698
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,843
Back then and even now,

699
00:32:30,867 --> 00:32:32,883
no one would believe me.

700
00:32:33,492 --> 00:32:36,326
On top of that, if you won't trust me,

701
00:32:36,575 --> 00:32:38,087
I can't...

702
00:32:44,533 --> 00:32:45,593
No.

703
00:32:45,617 --> 00:32:47,135
I trust you.

704
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:48,801
I know that there is no way

705
00:32:48,825 --> 00:32:50,870
you'd do something like that.

706
00:32:53,825 --> 00:32:56,177
I'll get that trophy back.

707
00:32:56,201 --> 00:32:58,093
It was yours to begin with.

708
00:32:58,117 --> 00:33:00,093
You had it taken away from you.

709
00:33:00,117 --> 00:33:02,992
You were better than Ms Cheon.

710
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:07,885
Thank you, sweetheart.

711
00:33:07,909 --> 00:33:10,409
Thank you for trusting me.

712
00:33:12,034 --> 00:33:14,368
I'm your daughter.

713
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:16,992
If I don't trust you, who can I trust?

714
00:33:18,242 --> 00:33:20,284
I had

715
00:33:20,659 --> 00:33:23,659
no other choice but to do this today.

716
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:27,617
I have to hold out no matter what I do.

717
00:33:56,651 --> 00:33:57,585
Let's go.

718
00:33:57,609 --> 00:33:59,776
Okay, let's go.

719
00:34:03,531 --> 00:34:04,792
Now that we've decided what you'll sing

720
00:34:04,817 --> 00:34:05,959
together for your midterm exam,

721
00:34:05,983 --> 00:34:06,959
I have to test you again

722
00:34:06,983 --> 00:34:08,502
before I divide you into groups.

723
00:34:08,526 --> 00:34:09,543
No! - Gosh.

724
00:34:09,567 --> 00:34:10,918
Please. - Seriously?

725
00:34:10,942 --> 00:34:13,818
Stop complaining and get ready.

726
00:34:40,668 --> 00:34:43,734
Bravo! Bravo.

727
00:34:43,759 --> 00:34:45,901
You never disappoint me, Eun Byeol.

728
00:34:45,925 --> 00:34:47,568
You may keep the soprano part.

729
00:34:47,592 --> 00:34:49,634
Thank you, Mr Ma.

730
00:34:50,759 --> 00:34:51,652
Next.

731
00:34:51,676 --> 00:34:53,279
Bae Ro Na.

732
00:34:56,355 --> 00:34:58,859
Cut! Stop!

733
00:34:58,883 --> 00:35:00,276
You'll be singing mezzo.

734
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,276
Pardon me?

735
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,694
Why do I have to sing mezzo?

736
00:35:02,718 --> 00:35:04,443
Anyone can tell I'm fit to sing soprano.

737
00:35:04,467 --> 00:35:05,735
Says who?

738
00:35:05,759 --> 00:35:07,151
I'm the one who makes the call.

739
00:35:07,175 --> 00:35:09,068
How dare you get stubborn with me.

740
00:35:09,092 --> 00:35:11,110
You're better suited to sing mezzo.

741
00:35:11,134 --> 00:35:13,443
No, I cannot accept this.

742
00:35:13,467 --> 00:35:14,610
My voice sounds

743
00:35:14,634 --> 00:35:17,193
most beautiful when I sing high notes.

744
00:35:17,217 --> 00:35:20,193
I don't understand why I must sing mezzo.

745
00:35:20,217 --> 00:35:21,403
Fine.

746
00:35:21,883 --> 00:35:23,151
If you manage

747
00:35:23,175 --> 00:35:25,068
to perfectly pull off the song I suggest,

748
00:35:25,092 --> 00:35:26,943
I'll let you sing soprano.

749
00:35:26,967 --> 00:35:29,134
Can you do that?

750
00:35:29,384 --> 00:35:32,300
Yes, I'll give it a try.

751
00:35:33,551 --> 00:35:36,009
I want you to sing the last part

752
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,859
of "Je Suis Titania" from "Mignon".

753
00:35:38,883 --> 00:35:40,671
Gosh. - Oh, no!

754
00:35:41,384 --> 00:35:43,943
Gosh, she can't pull that off.

755
00:35:43,967 --> 00:35:45,652
It's hard for even

756
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:47,193
seasoned prima donnas, you know?

757
00:35:47,217 --> 00:35:48,981
Are you ready?

758
00:35:51,009 --> 00:35:52,682
Catherine.

759
00:35:53,967 --> 00:35:56,573
"Cheonga Arts High School"

760
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:00,694
So?

761
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:01,776
Are you saying

762
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,235
you couldn't bring Ro Na down to mezzo?

763
00:37:04,259 --> 00:37:06,110
I had no choice.

764
00:37:06,134 --> 00:37:09,443
She perfectly pulled off the soprano part.

765
00:37:09,467 --> 00:37:11,818
Even her techniques were perfect.

766
00:37:11,842 --> 00:37:13,818
It was so perfect that I had a hard time

767
00:37:13,842 --> 00:37:14,943
believing she's a high schooler.

768
00:37:14,967 --> 00:37:17,485
Do you call that an excuse?

769
00:37:17,509 --> 00:37:18,652
I told you that her part

770
00:37:18,676 --> 00:37:19,901
can't overlap with Eun Byeol's.

771
00:37:19,925 --> 00:37:22,402
All the students saw it too,

772
00:37:22,426 --> 00:37:24,652
so I really had no choice.

773
00:37:24,676 --> 00:37:26,842
I'm sorry.

774
00:37:27,467 --> 00:37:29,610
Keep a watchful eye on Seok Kyung too.

775
00:37:29,634 --> 00:37:32,634
Eun Byeol feels most threatened by her.

776
00:37:33,259 --> 00:37:35,776
Eun Byeol keeps on getting better,

777
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,193
so I don't think you need

778
00:37:37,217 --> 00:37:39,551
to worry about Seok Kyung.

779
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:44,800
We'll speak soon.

780
00:37:47,092 --> 00:37:50,276
Gosh, Bae Ro Na.

781
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:53,800
I must uproot you before you can bloom.

782
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,800
Gosh.

783
00:38:12,259 --> 00:38:14,151
My gosh.

784
00:38:14,175 --> 00:38:16,467
Hello.

785
00:38:18,217 --> 00:38:20,318
Well, well.

786
00:38:20,342 --> 00:38:23,652
This is making me even more curious.

787
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:26,026
What did Bae Ro Na do

788
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:28,467
to get on the wrong side of Ms Cheon?

789
00:38:37,259 --> 00:38:39,568
I didn't know you worked.

790
00:38:39,592 --> 00:38:41,485
I was always so busy making ends meet that

791
00:38:41,509 --> 00:38:43,276
I've never been to such a fancy place.

792
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,509
Did you always work here?

793
00:38:46,134 --> 00:38:47,901
This was my mother's business,

794
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:50,259
but I'm in charge now.

795
00:38:52,134 --> 00:38:53,485
By the way,

796
00:38:53,509 --> 00:38:55,235
congratulations.

797
00:38:55,259 --> 00:38:57,901
I heard about the redevelopment.

798
00:38:57,925 --> 00:39:00,551
Didn't you move there recently?

799
00:39:00,842 --> 00:39:03,901
I guess I was lucky.

800
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:06,235
My gosh, I'm jealous.

801
00:39:06,259 --> 00:39:08,485
It's nothing to be jealous over.

802
00:39:08,509 --> 00:39:10,901
It was pure luck.

803
00:39:10,925 --> 00:39:13,610
I want to get into auctioning

804
00:39:13,634 --> 00:39:16,676
to make some extra money on the side.

805
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,782
Would you help me?

806
00:39:22,676 --> 00:39:24,694
I don't even know anything.

807
00:39:24,718 --> 00:39:26,735
I'm not an expert.

808
00:39:26,759 --> 00:39:29,634
Where are you planning to move later on?

809
00:39:30,175 --> 00:39:31,402
You'll have to move

810
00:39:31,426 --> 00:39:33,985
once the redevelopment begins.

811
00:39:34,009 --> 00:39:36,776
Right. I'd like to move soon

812
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,901
for Ro Na's sake.

813
00:39:38,925 --> 00:39:40,943
What about Hera Palace?

814
00:39:40,967 --> 00:39:42,527
What?

815
00:39:42,551 --> 00:39:44,110
Gosh.

816
00:39:44,134 --> 00:39:47,402
I'm not qualified to live there.

817
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:48,859
What are you talking about?

818
00:39:48,883 --> 00:39:51,568
A house is just a house.

819
00:39:51,592 --> 00:39:53,193
Well,

820
00:39:53,217 --> 00:39:55,676
that's not true.

821
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:58,443
Where you live represents your character,

822
00:39:58,467 --> 00:40:00,551
your social status,

823
00:40:00,967 --> 00:40:03,235
and even how much power you have.

824
00:40:03,259 --> 00:40:04,901
Then I'd say

825
00:40:04,925 --> 00:40:05,985
that's all the more reason

826
00:40:06,009 --> 00:40:08,217
you should move to Hera Palace.

827
00:40:08,676 --> 00:40:11,050
For Ro Na.

828
00:40:12,259 --> 00:40:14,276
I told you that a mother should be

829
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,134
willing to do anything for her child.

830
00:40:20,592 --> 00:40:23,694
Oh, are you free this evening?

831
00:40:23,718 --> 00:40:25,360
I have movie tickets,

832
00:40:25,384 --> 00:40:26,735
but my husband is suddenly saying

833
00:40:26,759 --> 00:40:28,489
he's got plans.

834
00:40:29,203 --> 00:40:31,370
Would you like to go with me?

835
00:40:36,862 --> 00:40:40,945
"Cheonga Medical Centre"

836
00:40:48,092 --> 00:40:49,151
"Here are your reservation details."

837
00:40:49,175 --> 00:40:50,360
"Sushi Bar Eobujiri"

838
00:40:50,384 --> 00:40:52,162
"March 5, 2020, table for two"

839
00:41:00,485 --> 00:41:03,793
"Sushi Bar Eobujiri"

840
00:41:08,217 --> 00:41:09,652
Where are you?

841
00:41:09,676 --> 00:41:11,549
I'm here.

842
00:41:33,546 --> 00:41:36,712
"Sushi Bar Eobujiri"

843
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,026
Sir, do you have a reservation?

844
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:09,276
May I help you?

845
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,342
Oh, sorry.

846
00:42:28,217 --> 00:42:29,276
Is someone there?

847
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,485
No, it's nothing.

848
00:42:31,509 --> 00:42:33,634
Enjoy your meal.

849
00:42:36,426 --> 00:42:37,875
Hold on.

850
00:42:38,842 --> 00:42:40,402
We'd like some privacy,

851
00:42:40,426 --> 00:42:41,568
so you don't need to come back

852
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:42,672
until we ask for you.

853
00:42:42,697 --> 00:42:44,625
Yes, sir.

854
00:43:00,676 --> 00:43:03,360
I missed this scent.

855
00:43:03,384 --> 00:43:04,360
Do you know that

856
00:43:04,384 --> 00:43:06,718
you're getting bolder by the day?

857
00:43:06,883 --> 00:43:08,776
You don't know me well enough yet.

858
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,050
I haven't even started.

859
00:43:11,259 --> 00:43:13,551
What are we doing

860
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:15,821
after dinner?

861
00:43:16,592 --> 00:43:18,752
I'm looking forward to it.

862
00:43:34,676 --> 00:43:36,652
I'm running a little late.

863
00:43:36,676 --> 00:43:38,967
Do you want to go in first?

864
00:43:43,134 --> 00:43:45,735
Gosh, look at this.

865
00:43:45,759 --> 00:43:47,630
This is amazing.

866
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,564
I can't believe I'm here.

867
00:43:51,467 --> 00:43:53,382
Where's my seat?

868
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:57,920
There it is.

869
00:44:01,134 --> 00:44:02,782
My gosh.

870
00:44:11,718 --> 00:44:13,142
Gosh.

871
00:44:15,175 --> 00:44:16,776
I haven't seen him lately.

872
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,235
Neither have I.

873
00:44:19,259 --> 00:44:21,134
Gosh.

874
00:44:26,217 --> 00:44:28,509
It really is Cheon Seo Jin.

875
00:44:28,967 --> 00:44:31,217
Wait, who is that man?

876
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:41,718
What? Is that Seok Kyung's dad?

877
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,842
My goodness.

878
00:44:53,509 --> 00:44:54,943
You're inside the cinema, right?

879
00:44:54,967 --> 00:44:56,527
Yes, but... - I'm on my way in.

880
00:44:56,551 --> 00:44:58,193
I'll come out now.

881
00:44:58,217 --> 00:45:00,551
Just wait there.

882
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:05,842
They're insane.

883
00:45:21,175 --> 00:45:22,901
Did you come out to greet me?

884
00:45:22,925 --> 00:45:24,818
Let's go in. - No, we can't.

885
00:45:24,842 --> 00:45:26,859
We can't go in there.

886
00:45:26,883 --> 00:45:28,818
Why not? Is something wrong?

887
00:45:28,842 --> 00:45:30,842
Well...

888
00:45:31,592 --> 00:45:33,151
Just tell me.

889
00:45:33,175 --> 00:45:34,985
The thing is,

890
00:45:35,009 --> 00:45:37,217
your husband is inside.

891
00:45:37,467 --> 00:45:39,509
What's he doing here?

892
00:45:39,634 --> 00:45:42,925
He said he has a meeting this evening.

893
00:45:44,426 --> 00:45:46,151
You're probably mistaken.

894
00:45:46,175 --> 00:45:48,901
What? No, wait.

895
00:45:48,925 --> 00:45:50,943
He's with a woman.

896
00:45:50,967 --> 00:45:53,467
What are you talking about?

897
00:45:59,217 --> 00:46:01,259
Gosh!

898
00:46:13,235 --> 00:46:16,049
Come on. Let's get out of here.

899
00:46:20,676 --> 00:46:21,776
For things like this,

900
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:24,527
soju is the best remedy.

901
00:46:24,551 --> 00:46:27,467
Go ahead and drink up.

902
00:46:30,601 --> 00:46:32,092
Good.

903
00:46:37,676 --> 00:46:40,009
I know how you feel.

904
00:46:40,384 --> 00:46:44,551
My late husband was the same.

905
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:46,901
Ro Na's dad

906
00:46:46,925 --> 00:46:49,193
got dead drunk

907
00:46:49,217 --> 00:46:50,193
and fell over a railing.

908
00:46:50,217 --> 00:46:52,134
That's how he died.

909
00:46:52,592 --> 00:46:54,694
But later on, I found out

910
00:46:54,718 --> 00:46:55,943
he was having fun with another woman

911
00:46:55,967 --> 00:46:58,509
until his final moments.

912
00:47:00,134 --> 00:47:03,527
He never even gave me a single penny,

913
00:47:03,551 --> 00:47:06,235
but he bought her expensive clothes

914
00:47:06,259 --> 00:47:08,235
and got a loan to open a shop for her.

915
00:47:08,259 --> 00:47:10,151
He left me

916
00:47:10,175 --> 00:47:13,151
with nothing but debt.

917
00:47:13,175 --> 00:47:14,694
My gosh, how could he do that?

918
00:47:14,718 --> 00:47:16,402
But he's already dead,

919
00:47:16,426 --> 00:47:18,652
so I can't even get back at him.

920
00:47:18,676 --> 00:47:21,134
After burying him,

921
00:47:22,217 --> 00:47:24,110
my resentment towards him

922
00:47:24,134 --> 00:47:27,426
became even more deeply rooted.

923
00:47:32,259 --> 00:47:35,676
Drink slowly. I don't want you to...

924
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,985
You're so kind and beautiful.

925
00:47:47,009 --> 00:47:48,527
How could he cheat on you

926
00:47:48,551 --> 00:47:50,652
with a witch like Cheon Seo Jin?

927
00:47:50,676 --> 00:47:53,360
I'm just so upset.

928
00:47:53,384 --> 00:47:55,925
You're like a big sister to me.

929
00:47:58,925 --> 00:48:01,652
Speaking of which,

930
00:48:01,676 --> 00:48:04,925
can I just call you Soo Ryeon now?

931
00:48:08,134 --> 00:48:10,068
From now on,

932
00:48:10,092 --> 00:48:12,527
you should just call me Yoon Hee too.

933
00:48:12,551 --> 00:48:16,193
I'll help you.

934
00:48:16,217 --> 00:48:19,384
We're up against Cheon Seo Jin, you know.

935
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,551
You went to the same school, right?

936
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,985
Yes, we went to the same high school.

937
00:48:25,009 --> 00:48:27,360
If the Divine really exists

938
00:48:27,384 --> 00:48:28,318
and says

939
00:48:28,342 --> 00:48:30,652
I won't be punished for killing someone,

940
00:48:30,676 --> 00:48:33,193
I will be sure to kill her

941
00:48:33,217 --> 00:48:35,551
with my own two hands.

"Cinema, 160,000 won"

949
00:49:09,551 --> 00:49:12,776
Oh, are you free this evening?

950
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,735
I have movie tickets,

951
00:49:14,759 --> 00:49:16,026
but my husband is suddenly saying

952
00:49:16,050 --> 00:49:17,801
he's got plans.

953
00:49:18,509 --> 00:49:21,009
Would you like to go with me?

954
00:49:41,967 --> 00:49:43,859
She was the one who didn't let Ro Na

955
00:49:43,883 --> 00:49:45,276
perform at the admission ceremony.

956
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:47,901
I have no proof, but I'm sure of it.

957
00:49:47,925 --> 00:49:50,318
She's always been like that.

958
00:49:50,342 --> 00:49:51,568
You see,

959
00:49:51,592 --> 00:49:52,735
when she wants something,

960
00:49:52,759 --> 00:49:54,443
she must have it no matter what.

961
00:49:54,467 --> 00:49:55,735
She'd do whatever it takes

962
00:49:55,759 --> 00:49:57,568
to make it hers.

963
00:49:57,592 --> 00:50:00,235
Listen, you have to stay on your toes.

964
00:50:00,259 --> 00:50:02,818
If not, she'll steal your husband

965
00:50:02,842 --> 00:50:06,151
and even take all your money from you.

966
00:50:06,175 --> 00:50:07,735
Soo Ryeon.

967
00:50:07,759 --> 00:50:09,925
To tell you the truth...

968
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:16,068
My daughter died a little while ago.

969
00:50:16,092 --> 00:50:19,443
You had another child

970
00:50:19,467 --> 00:50:21,967
besides Seok Kyung and Seok Hoon?

971
00:50:22,134 --> 00:50:23,901
I thought I had just managed

972
00:50:23,925 --> 00:50:26,384
to pull myself together.

973
00:50:27,134 --> 00:50:28,776
Gosh.

974
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,193
That scumbag.

975
00:50:31,217 --> 00:50:32,610
Don't cry.

976
00:50:32,634 --> 00:50:34,068
He's not worth crying over.

977
00:50:34,092 --> 00:50:37,402
Seriously, don't let that worthless jerk

978
00:50:37,426 --> 00:50:39,694
make you suffer.

979
00:50:39,718 --> 00:50:42,092
I've been through this, so I know.

980
00:50:42,426 --> 00:50:44,235
If you cry,

981
00:50:44,259 --> 00:50:47,426
he'll just think you're a fool.

982
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:55,592
Stay strong, Soo Ryeon.

983
00:50:56,634 --> 00:50:58,676
Who's calling?

984
00:51:01,634 --> 00:51:03,276
Hello?

985
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,467
Who's this?

986
00:51:35,384 --> 00:51:37,426
Hey.

987
00:51:39,634 --> 00:51:41,568
Why did you want to see me so late?

988
00:51:41,592 --> 00:51:43,883
Thanks for coming.

989
00:51:46,925 --> 00:51:49,384
Why are you so drunk?

990
00:51:52,634 --> 00:51:56,426
Are you and Seo Jin having issues?

991
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:00,259
No. What are you talking about?

992
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:03,592
We're very happy in our marriage.

993
00:52:07,342 --> 00:52:09,718
Then why did you call me?

994
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:11,735
If you have something to say, say it now.

995
00:52:11,759 --> 00:52:14,426
I don't want anyone to suspect us.

996
00:52:16,217 --> 00:52:18,300
I'm sorry.

997
00:52:20,092 --> 00:52:22,800
Back then and even now,

998
00:52:23,384 --> 00:52:26,050
I feel so bad when I think about you.

999
00:52:26,883 --> 00:52:29,050
Is that what you wanted to say?

1000
00:52:29,467 --> 00:52:30,776
You're drunk.

1001
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,009
You should go home.

1002
00:52:33,217 --> 00:52:35,426
Yoon Hee.

1003
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:39,318
Don't hate me too much.

1004
00:52:39,342 --> 00:52:41,467
Okay?

1005
00:52:54,925 --> 00:52:57,259
Did you dump me

1006
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:01,050
to live like this?

1007
00:53:17,092 --> 00:53:18,026
Gosh.

1008
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:19,901
Why did you drink so much?

1009
00:53:19,925 --> 00:53:21,942
Ha Yoon Chul! Can you stand up?

1010
00:53:21,967 --> 00:53:24,110
This is crazy. - Here.

1011
00:53:24,135 --> 00:53:25,178
Thank you.

1012
00:53:25,203 --> 00:53:26,703
My gosh. - Lady.

1013
00:53:26,728 --> 00:53:28,931
Hold on, lady. My gosh!

1014
00:53:28,956 --> 00:53:30,735
What's going on here?

1015
00:53:30,759 --> 00:53:33,217
I'm witnessing a very scandalous sight.

1016
00:53:33,242 --> 00:53:35,193
It's past midnight.

1017
00:53:35,217 --> 00:53:37,859
And you're with your first love?

1018
00:53:37,883 --> 00:53:39,568
Don't just stand there. Can you help me?

1019
00:53:39,592 --> 00:53:40,527
He's so heavy.

1020
00:53:40,551 --> 00:53:41,776
Okay, here.

1021
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:42,901
Gosh.

1022
00:53:42,925 --> 00:53:43,859
Goodness!

1023
00:53:43,883 --> 00:53:45,402
Geez. - Gosh.

1024
00:53:45,426 --> 00:53:48,568
Dr Ha is totally wasted.

1025
00:53:48,592 --> 00:53:51,193
He's not the type to get this drunk.

1026
00:53:51,217 --> 00:53:53,151
I can tell you two didn't drink together

1027
00:53:53,175 --> 00:53:55,776
because you seem perfectly sober.

1028
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,859
I suppose you can hold your liquor well.

1029
00:53:57,883 --> 00:53:59,402
Here.

1030
00:53:59,426 --> 00:54:01,551
Take him home, please.

1031
00:54:02,134 --> 00:54:03,776
Are you two

1032
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:06,925
really seeing each other?

1033
00:54:08,634 --> 00:54:11,967
No, we are not.

1034
00:54:13,009 --> 00:54:15,193
That lunatic, what's with that smirk?

1035
00:54:15,217 --> 00:54:16,694
He's a hopeless romantic, isn't he?

1036
00:54:16,718 --> 00:54:17,943
He took care of your settlement money

1037
00:54:17,967 --> 00:54:20,092
without hesitation.

1038
00:54:20,592 --> 00:54:22,151
He gave you that money

1039
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:25,759
behind his wife's back.

1040
00:54:25,967 --> 00:54:27,443
That's true love.

1041
00:54:27,467 --> 00:54:28,859
Gosh. Oh, boy.

1042
00:54:28,883 --> 00:54:30,800
Goodness.

1043
00:54:31,092 --> 00:54:32,068
What do you mean?

1044
00:54:32,092 --> 00:54:33,694
What settlement money?

1045
00:54:33,718 --> 00:54:36,217
You said Seo Jin had agreed to settle.

1046
00:54:37,134 --> 00:54:38,568
Was that not the case?

1047
00:54:38,592 --> 00:54:40,193
Gosh, you're such a fool.

1048
00:54:40,217 --> 00:54:42,068
You actually believed that?

1049
00:54:42,092 --> 00:54:43,776
She'd never do that,

1050
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,235
with that temper of hers.

1051
00:54:45,259 --> 00:54:46,859
Hey, Dr Ha.

1052
00:54:46,883 --> 00:54:48,818
You sure know how to keep a secret.

1053
00:54:48,842 --> 00:54:50,925
You're a real man.

1054
00:54:51,092 --> 00:54:53,217
A real man.

1055
00:54:53,759 --> 00:54:58,842
Have a drink with me next time.

1056
00:54:58,883 --> 00:55:01,092
Lunatic.

1057
00:55:01,676 --> 00:55:02,610
Ms Oh!

1058
00:55:02,634 --> 00:55:05,050
Have a good night!

1059
00:55:05,676 --> 00:55:06,985
Hey, what's her charm

1060
00:55:07,009 --> 00:55:09,360
that made you pay the 100 million won?

1061
00:55:09,384 --> 00:55:10,818
Tell me. Geez!

1062
00:55:10,842 --> 00:55:13,694
Try standing up, will you? Goodness.

1063
00:55:13,718 --> 00:55:15,735
Oh, boy.

1064
00:55:15,759 --> 00:55:17,110
Why did he drink so much?

1065
00:55:17,134 --> 00:55:18,402
My goodness.

1066
00:55:18,426 --> 00:55:20,360
He's a total mess.

1067
00:55:20,384 --> 00:55:22,110
I know.

1068
00:55:22,134 --> 00:55:24,634
He was already wasted when I ran into him.

1069
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:28,800
You two must've fought or something.

1070
00:55:29,009 --> 00:55:31,134
Why would we fight?

1071
00:55:32,009 --> 00:55:34,175
Honey.

1072
00:55:36,592 --> 00:55:38,318
Okay, then forget what I said.

1073
00:55:38,342 --> 00:55:40,568
Oh, Dr Ha...

1074
00:55:40,592 --> 00:55:43,276
Nothing, never mind.

1075
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:45,402
You should keep a watchful eye on him.

1076
00:55:45,426 --> 00:55:47,151
It's always guys like him

1077
00:55:47,175 --> 00:55:48,776
who are a little twisted

1078
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:49,776
and do funny things

1079
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,068
behind their wives' backs.

1080
00:55:51,092 --> 00:55:53,485
Well, that's just what I heard.

1081
00:55:53,509 --> 00:55:55,151
Gosh, never mind.

1082
00:55:55,175 --> 00:55:57,485
Anyway, I'm off.

1083
00:55:57,509 --> 00:56:00,592
I should go home and eat some ramyeon.

1084
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:08,175
For goodness' sake.

1085
00:56:08,925 --> 00:56:11,467
I'm sorry, Yoon Hee.

1086
00:56:17,634 --> 00:56:19,842
What? Oh Yoon Hee?

1087
00:56:42,592 --> 00:56:44,110
Are you sober now?

1088
00:56:44,134 --> 00:56:46,009
Yes.

1089
00:56:47,592 --> 00:56:50,151
Who did you drink with last night?

1090
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:51,652
Well...

1091
00:56:51,676 --> 00:56:52,859
Obviously,

1092
00:56:52,883 --> 00:56:55,676
with Chairman Joo and Attorney Lee.

1093
00:56:56,718 --> 00:56:58,676
Is that so?

1094
00:56:59,634 --> 00:57:01,068
Don't drink too much.

1095
00:57:01,092 --> 00:57:03,175
You'll ruin your stomach.

1096
00:57:04,592 --> 00:57:05,694
Eat your hangover soup.

1097
00:57:05,718 --> 00:57:06,943
I have to go to work.

1098
00:57:06,967 --> 00:57:08,527
Eun Byeol, let's go.

1099
00:57:08,551 --> 00:57:09,773
Okay.

1100
00:57:12,175 --> 00:57:13,235
Have a good day, Eun Byeol.

1101
00:57:13,259 --> 00:57:14,722
You too.

1102
00:57:28,967 --> 00:57:31,151
You must eat well in order to fight.

1103
00:57:31,175 --> 00:57:32,694
Force yourself to eat

1104
00:57:32,718 --> 00:57:34,925
to get some strength back.

1105
00:57:36,592 --> 00:57:38,235
I have no appetite.

1106
00:57:38,259 --> 00:57:41,151
I can't even look him in the eye.

1107
00:57:41,175 --> 00:57:43,402
You must stay strong at a time like this.

1108
00:57:43,426 --> 00:57:46,342
I told you to prepare yourself mentally.

1109
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:52,360
The thing you mentioned yesterday.

1110
00:57:52,384 --> 00:57:55,342
I thought about it all night.

1111
00:57:55,759 --> 00:57:58,110
What? - The auction.

1112
00:57:58,134 --> 00:57:59,652
You said you were interested in it.

1113
00:57:59,676 --> 00:58:02,985
I'll help you with it, Soo Ryeon.

1114
00:58:03,009 --> 00:58:04,402
Really?

1115
00:58:04,426 --> 00:58:06,151
Will you do that for me, Yoon Hee?

1116
00:58:06,175 --> 00:58:09,175
Yes, I'll do my best.

1117
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:10,610
So don't you let

1118
00:58:10,634 --> 00:58:12,026
a witch like Cheon Seo Jin

1119
00:58:12,050 --> 00:58:15,384
ruin your life, okay?

1120
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,485
Actually,

1121
00:58:19,509 --> 00:58:20,985
I saw a document about an auction

1122
00:58:21,009 --> 00:58:22,859
in my husband's study.

1123
00:58:22,883 --> 00:58:25,800
I think he's trying to buy that place.

1124
00:58:26,306 --> 00:58:27,837
Where is it?

1125
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:34,775
"Real Estate Office"

1126
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,443
It's right by a new apartment complex.

1127
00:58:36,467 --> 00:58:37,985
And near this place...

1128
00:58:38,009 --> 00:58:39,776
If you see here, there's an intersection.

1129
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:41,599
So it's very easy to...

1130
00:58:41,624 --> 00:58:44,373
"32-Storey Landmark"

1131
00:58:51,443 --> 00:58:53,359
Hey, Soo Ryeon.

1132
00:58:53,384 --> 00:58:54,443
You won't believe this.

1133
00:58:54,467 --> 00:58:56,776
Seriously, we've hit the jackpot.

1134
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,235
Rumour has it that

1135
00:58:59,259 --> 00:59:01,527
a shopping centre will be built near it.

1136
00:59:01,551 --> 00:59:03,402
I think it's pretty much decided.

1137
00:59:03,426 --> 00:59:04,610
Soo Ryeon,

1138
00:59:04,634 --> 00:59:06,360
we must get this no matter what.

1139
00:59:06,384 --> 00:59:08,235
Yes!

1140
00:59:08,259 --> 00:59:09,485
Okay.

1141
00:59:09,509 --> 00:59:12,050
I'm counting on you.

1142
00:59:12,676 --> 00:59:14,759
All right.

1143
00:59:18,676 --> 00:59:20,967
I'm sorry, Yoon Hee.

1144
00:59:23,925 --> 00:59:26,759
I have to use you for a little while.

1145
00:59:27,634 --> 00:59:28,818
We've finalised the deal

1146
00:59:28,842 --> 00:59:30,985
for all the buildings in the area.

1147
00:59:31,009 --> 00:59:32,943
It means the three of us

1148
00:59:32,967 --> 00:59:34,443
have finalised

1149
00:59:34,467 --> 00:59:36,859
this huge investment of 150 billion won.

1150
00:59:36,883 --> 00:59:38,776
The auction is tomorrow.

1151
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,068
What do you say?

1152
00:59:40,092 --> 00:59:41,068
Will you come with me?

1153
00:59:41,092 --> 00:59:43,568
No, you should go alone.

1154
00:59:43,592 --> 00:59:44,694
If we're seen together,

1155
00:59:44,718 --> 00:59:46,818
it might attract small fry.

1156
00:59:46,842 --> 00:59:48,485
Right, I agree.

1157
00:59:48,509 --> 00:59:49,568
How much should I spend?

1158
00:59:49,592 --> 00:59:50,901
The owner filed for bankruptcy,

1159
00:59:50,925 --> 00:59:52,776
so it's listed at a low price.

1160
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,776
We won't need to spend too much.

1161
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:58,068
Just add another 10 million,

1162
00:59:58,092 --> 01:00:00,676
and it'll be ours.

1163
01:00:05,676 --> 01:00:08,050
Look at that.

1164
01:00:11,883 --> 01:00:14,009
Oh, my.

1165
01:00:15,259 --> 01:00:17,592
What is that?

1166
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:20,883
My gosh.

1167
01:00:25,925 --> 01:00:29,110
Very soon, we will have more cash

1168
01:00:29,134 --> 01:00:33,050
than anyone else in this country.

1169
01:00:33,217 --> 01:00:35,383
My gosh!

1170
01:00:37,509 --> 01:00:39,467
Oh, my.

1171
01:00:40,523 --> 01:00:42,638
"Seoul Central District Court"

1172
01:00:42,925 --> 01:00:44,821
You've got 10 more minutes.

1173
01:00:44,846 --> 01:00:46,151
"Tender Box"

1174
01:00:46,175 --> 01:00:48,360
This investigation is unfair!

1175
01:00:48,384 --> 01:00:51,175
What do you think you're doing?

1176
01:00:51,528 --> 01:00:53,150
Move!

1177
01:00:55,426 --> 01:00:56,443
You scumbags.

1178
01:00:56,467 --> 01:00:59,009
I inherited the house from my parents!

1179
01:00:59,718 --> 01:01:01,026
What's he doing?

1180
01:01:01,050 --> 01:01:02,421
"Tender Envelope"

1181
01:01:02,446 --> 01:01:06,276
Gosh, kill me instead. Just kill me!

1182
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:09,759
Out of my way! - What are you doing?

1183
01:01:10,592 --> 01:01:12,218
Get out!

1184
01:01:15,592 --> 01:01:17,110
I'll kill you all! - Gosh!

1185
01:01:17,134 --> 01:01:18,818
Get out!

1186
01:01:18,842 --> 01:01:22,050
Don't you dare get in my way!

1187
01:01:25,718 --> 01:01:26,818
"Tender Envelope"

1188
01:01:26,842 --> 01:01:28,344
"Oh Yoon Hee"

1189
01:01:28,369 --> 01:01:30,688
Go away! Don't come near me!

1190
01:01:30,713 --> 01:01:35,384
My, people have so much passion.

1191
01:01:43,925 --> 01:01:45,985
Hey, Soo Ryeon.

1192
01:01:46,009 --> 01:01:47,985
I used my name for the bid.

1193
01:01:48,009 --> 01:01:50,551
Your husband can't find out, you know.

1194
01:01:50,634 --> 01:01:52,527
I added another 30 million won,

1195
01:01:52,551 --> 01:01:54,551
so I'm sure we'll get it.

1196
01:01:55,925 --> 01:01:59,217
"JKING Holdings"

1197
01:02:00,192 --> 01:02:01,585
Who?

1198
01:02:01,609 --> 01:02:02,794
Oh Yoon Hee?

1199
01:02:02,818 --> 01:02:04,543
No way. How did she find out

1200
01:02:04,567 --> 01:02:05,879
about the building?

1201
01:02:05,904 --> 01:02:08,467
I swear it was Oh Yoon Hee!

1202
01:02:08,492 --> 01:02:10,176
We can't reconstruct the entire lot

1203
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,802
without that property.

1204
01:02:11,826 --> 01:02:13,009
What are we going to do now?

1205
01:02:13,033 --> 01:02:14,301
If the construction gets delayed,

1206
01:02:14,325 --> 01:02:15,301
we won't get the money back.

1207
01:02:15,325 --> 01:02:17,260
And what about all the interest?

1208
01:02:17,284 --> 01:02:18,760
My friends took out

1209
01:02:18,784 --> 01:02:20,301
high-interest loans!

1210
01:02:20,325 --> 01:02:22,454
We've poured 150 billion won

1211
01:02:22,479 --> 01:02:23,890
into this project.

1212
01:02:23,915 --> 01:02:25,179
150 billion won!

1213
01:02:25,204 --> 01:02:27,487
I've put in 90 billion won!

1214
01:02:27,512 --> 01:02:29,001
So stop making such a fuss, will you?

1215
01:02:29,025 --> 01:02:32,043
You're the one who came up with this idea!

1216
01:02:32,067 --> 01:02:34,001
I put in 30 billion won!

1217
01:02:34,025 --> 01:02:36,210
That includes my mum's money!

1218
01:02:36,234 --> 01:02:37,876
If I lose that money,

1219
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:40,293
my mum will kill me!

1220
01:02:40,317 --> 01:02:41,293
Do you understand?

1221
01:02:41,317 --> 01:02:42,251
Hands off!

1222
01:02:42,275 --> 01:02:43,876
How dare you!

1223
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:46,526
You scumbag!

1224
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:48,627
What the heck are you doing?

1225
01:02:48,651 --> 01:02:51,168
Hey! We did this because we trusted you,

1226
01:02:51,192 --> 01:02:52,668
so you'd better take responsibility!

1227
01:02:52,692 --> 01:02:54,794
What? Is that how you'll talk to me now?

1228
01:02:54,818 --> 01:02:57,293
That's right. I don't care any more.

1229
01:02:57,317 --> 01:02:58,543
You darn punk.

1230
01:02:58,567 --> 01:02:59,876
What? "Darn punk"?

1231
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:01,210
Because of you, I lost all my money

1232
01:03:01,234 --> 01:03:02,293
and even my friends' money.

1233
01:03:02,317 --> 01:03:04,668
How dare you swear at me!

1234
01:03:04,692 --> 01:03:06,376
We have no time for this.

1235
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:07,959
We have to come up with a plan.

1236
01:03:07,983 --> 01:03:11,459
Want to see me in handcuffs? - Hey!

1237
01:03:11,484 --> 01:03:13,818
Shut it, both of you!

1238
01:03:16,025 --> 01:03:17,710
It's not over yet.

1239
01:03:17,734 --> 01:03:19,710
Stop acting like total idiots!

1240
01:03:19,734 --> 01:03:22,567
I will get it all sorted out!

1241
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:30,112
I will meet

1242
01:03:30,137 --> 01:03:32,637
Oh Yoon Hee and deal with her myself.

1243
01:03:35,011 --> 01:03:37,011
Bravo.

1244
01:03:41,577 --> 01:03:43,126
Gosh, I'm so nervous.

1245
01:03:43,150 --> 01:03:46,234
I didn't think we'd actually get it.

1246
01:03:46,526 --> 01:03:48,460
Do you really think it's worth the money?

1247
01:03:48,484 --> 01:03:51,043
They absolutely need that building

1248
01:03:51,067 --> 01:03:53,251
for the reconstruction.

1249
01:03:53,275 --> 01:03:54,835
Your husband obviously knows it,

1250
01:03:54,859 --> 01:03:57,150
which is why he wanted to buy it.

1251
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:02,192
It's right at the centre of that lot.

1252
01:04:02,651 --> 01:04:03,959
Thanks.

1253
01:04:03,983 --> 01:04:04,876
I really feel like

1254
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:06,983
I have a younger sister now.

1255
01:04:08,317 --> 01:04:10,168
We're going to split the profit in half

1256
01:04:10,192 --> 01:04:11,627
once the building gets sold,

1257
01:04:11,651 --> 01:04:13,293
but I wanted to express my gratitude

1258
01:04:13,317 --> 01:04:14,376
towards you.

1259
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:15,835
Please accept this, Yoon Hee.

1260
01:04:15,859 --> 01:04:17,335
My gosh.

1261
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:21,150
I really want to decline this with class,

1262
01:04:21,692 --> 01:04:24,692
but I'm still struggling financially.

1263
01:04:26,234 --> 01:04:27,918
I'll put this to good use.

1264
01:04:27,942 --> 01:04:30,025
Thanks a lot.

1265
01:04:32,192 --> 01:04:35,585
Why don't we clink our glasses again?

1266
01:04:35,609 --> 01:04:37,734
Shall we?

1267
01:04:37,942 --> 01:04:40,192
Cheers! - Cheers!

1268
01:04:41,526 --> 01:04:43,859
Ro Na, Mum's home.

1269
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:44,876
Mum, why...

1270
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:46,668
Gosh, did you drink?

1271
01:04:46,692 --> 01:04:47,627
Goodness.

1272
01:04:47,651 --> 01:04:51,502
Ro Na, do you know what this is?

1273
01:04:51,526 --> 01:04:54,484
I got this for you.

1274
01:04:56,180 --> 01:04:57,585
What is all this?

1275
01:04:57,609 --> 01:05:00,210
New clothes. You don't have a trench coat.

1276
01:05:00,234 --> 01:05:01,876
I got this coat for you.

1277
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:02,876
Really?

1278
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:05,418
Why so many? - This pretty dress too.

1279
01:05:05,442 --> 01:05:06,460
Oh, wait.

1280
01:05:06,484 --> 01:05:08,585
I bought you this floral dress too.

1281
01:05:08,609 --> 01:05:10,917
You'll look so pretty in this.

1282
01:05:10,942 --> 01:05:13,835
My gosh, it looks amazing on you!

1283
01:05:13,859 --> 01:05:15,585
Ro Na, I know I haven't been able

1284
01:05:15,609 --> 01:05:16,835
to provide much for you.

1285
01:05:16,859 --> 01:05:19,794
I'll make up for all of that.

1286
01:05:19,818 --> 01:05:21,335
Only sunshine and rainbows

1287
01:05:21,359 --> 01:05:22,543
are ahead of you now,

1288
01:05:22,567 --> 01:05:24,959
so just trust me.

1289
01:05:24,983 --> 01:05:26,959
Okay?

1290
01:05:26,983 --> 01:05:30,818
Sweetie, can I give you a hug?

1291
01:05:31,818 --> 01:05:33,752
Gosh! - This feels so nice!

1292
01:05:33,776 --> 01:05:35,502
You reek of alcohol.

1293
01:05:35,526 --> 01:05:37,585
Gosh, go away.

1294
01:05:37,609 --> 01:05:39,876
Come on! Give me a kiss.

1295
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:41,918
Hey, come here and give me a kiss.

1296
01:05:41,942 --> 01:05:44,651
Just a kiss! - You reek of alcohol.

1297
01:05:47,983 --> 01:05:50,460
Gosh, this feels so nice.

1298
01:05:50,484 --> 01:05:52,251
I love you, my dear daughter.

1299
01:05:52,275 --> 01:05:53,876
I love you so much.

1300
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:56,818
I love you too.

1301
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:16,085
Help me.

1302
01:06:16,109 --> 01:06:18,471
Please help me!

1303
01:06:28,442 --> 01:06:31,359
Yes, I remember now.

1304
01:06:31,526 --> 01:06:34,900
That day, I ran into Min Seol A

1305
01:06:35,692 --> 01:06:38,359
at Hera Palace.

1306
01:06:44,567 --> 01:06:47,168
What's wrong, Sugar?

1307
01:06:47,192 --> 01:06:48,794
Sugar.

1308
01:06:48,818 --> 01:06:51,168
It's late. You'll wake everyone up.

1309
01:06:51,192 --> 01:06:52,502
Come here. Good.

1310
01:06:52,526 --> 01:06:54,460
Stop it. That's enough.

1311
01:06:54,484 --> 01:06:57,109
Ouch! Gosh.

1312
01:06:57,734 --> 01:07:00,359
Sugar, where are you going?

1313
01:07:02,067 --> 01:07:03,711
Sugar.

1314
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:11,668
Ms Oh.

1315
01:07:11,692 --> 01:07:14,192
I asked you for help.

1316
01:07:22,818 --> 01:07:25,502
Mum. Mum.

1317
01:07:25,526 --> 01:07:27,692
What's the matter?

1318
01:07:29,776 --> 01:07:31,392
Ro Na.

1319
01:07:31,734 --> 01:07:32,871
Mum.

1320
01:07:33,859 --> 01:07:35,918
Something's wrong with Sugar.

1321
01:07:35,942 --> 01:07:38,327
Sugar is not breathing.

1322
01:07:38,859 --> 01:07:40,460
What are you talking about?

1323
01:07:40,484 --> 01:07:43,668
Sugar kept barking until just now.

1324
01:07:43,692 --> 01:07:47,015
Sugar, don't die. Please...

1325
01:07:47,651 --> 01:07:49,627
Mum, what do we do?

1326
01:07:49,651 --> 01:07:52,335
Sugar, Sugar.

1327
01:07:52,359 --> 01:07:55,335
Wake up, please?

1328
01:07:55,359 --> 01:07:58,168
Sugar.

1329
01:07:58,192 --> 01:08:01,359
"Min Seol A"

1330
01:08:01,776 --> 01:08:03,752
Sugar. - Sugar...

1331
01:08:03,776 --> 01:08:06,859
was Min Seol A's dog?

1332
01:08:06,942 --> 01:08:09,460
Sugar, Sugar...

1333
01:08:09,484 --> 01:08:12,359
Wake up, please?

1334
01:08:30,983 --> 01:08:33,876
=Penthouse=

1335
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:35,168
Let's move.

1336
01:08:35,192 --> 01:08:38,859
Chairman Joo Dan Tae is furious.

1337
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:42,710
I know that you met up with Yoon Hee.

1338
01:08:42,734 --> 01:08:44,502
It means that Oh Yoon Hee has a backer

1339
01:08:44,526 --> 01:08:46,251
who gives her real estate information.

1340
01:08:46,275 --> 01:08:47,543
Don't you think Sim Soo Ryeon

1341
01:08:47,567 --> 01:08:48,835
may be putting on an act?

1342
01:08:48,859 --> 01:08:51,543
That person may know your wife's secrets.

1343
01:08:51,567 --> 01:08:53,376
Don't talk unless you want to die.

1344
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:55,126
She's being blackmailed?

1345
01:08:55,150 --> 01:08:58,067
Did you kill Min Seol A?

1346
01:08:58,651 --> 01:09:00,900
I trust you, honey.
