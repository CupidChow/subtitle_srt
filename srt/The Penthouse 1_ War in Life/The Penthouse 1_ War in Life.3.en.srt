Wipe everything she touched thoroughly

no matter how long it takes.

9
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,642
It's filthy and disgusting.

10
00:00:52,976 --> 00:00:53,892
Yes, sir.

11
00:01:08,517 --> 00:01:09,892
Have you always been like this?

12
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,559
What do you mean?

13
00:01:13,725 --> 00:01:15,433
I know what she did was wrong.

14
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,600
But she's still a kid.

15
00:01:17,684 --> 00:01:18,934
Don't you think you were a bit too harsh?

16
00:01:20,934 --> 00:01:22,433
Are you saying what I did was wrong?

17
00:01:22,684 --> 00:01:23,725
If anything,

18
00:01:23,809 --> 00:01:25,268
we should set an example for our kids.

19
00:01:26,934 --> 00:01:28,268
Isn't that what parents do?

20
00:01:29,892 --> 00:01:30,892
What you did today

21
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,809
wasn't something a grown-up should do.

22
00:02:03,767 --> 00:02:04,934
You got a GED and

23
00:02:05,268 --> 00:02:06,725
you live in Boseong Village?

24
00:02:07,017 --> 00:02:08,809
You con people to make money.

25
00:02:08,934 --> 00:02:11,226
Do you think Cheonga will accept you?

26
00:02:12,268 --> 00:02:13,809
That's my warning to you

27
00:02:13,892 --> 00:02:14,976
to live straight.

28
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:18,475
You stole Seok Kyung's key ring too?

29
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:21,809
You're a thief and a fraud.

30
00:02:23,559 --> 00:02:26,226
A kid like you can't go to school with us.

31
00:02:26,725 --> 00:02:27,684
Your first-place admission

32
00:02:27,767 --> 00:02:29,184
will be cancelled, of course.

33
00:02:39,809 --> 00:02:40,809
I just

34
00:02:41,517 --> 00:02:43,517
did my best to live my life.

35
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,392
I just worked hard to death.

36
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,475
Sugar.

37
00:03:18,517 --> 00:03:20,433
You're the only one for me.

38
00:03:30,934 --> 00:03:32,268
I'm sorry to text you so late.

39
00:03:32,475 --> 00:03:33,684
Did you get home safe?

40
00:03:34,268 --> 00:03:35,600
Congratulations

41
00:03:36,433 --> 00:03:38,184
on your first-place admission to Cheonga.

42

I have a feeling

44
00:03:41,309 --> 00:03:43,350
you'd have a very beautiful singing voice.

45
00:03:51,392 --> 00:03:52,642
"Congratulations, my princess"

46

"from Dubai, Dad"

47
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,817
Thank you. - Thank you.

48
00:03:58,942 --> 00:03:59,817
The right-hand side.

49
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,109
It's tilted to the right side.

50
00:04:01,234 --> 00:04:03,234
Bring up the left side. Yes.

51
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,984
Keep it level.

52
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:06,234
Okay.

53
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:07,650
"Yoo Je Ni Accepted to Cheonga Arts High!"

54
00:04:07,734 --> 00:04:09,442
Wait, I'm the one who got accepted.

55
00:04:09,525 --> 00:04:11,192
Why did you put Dad's and your name there?

56
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:12,734
You're embarrassing me.

57
00:04:12,817 --> 00:04:14,692
I shouldn't miss the chance to put

58
00:04:14,775 --> 00:04:16,650
my name on a placard as your mum.

59
00:04:17,067 --> 00:04:18,400
It looks wonderful.

60
00:04:18,742 --> 00:04:21,368
Shouldn't Dad be back on a day like this?

61
00:04:21,742 --> 00:04:23,159
He didn't even call. He texted me.

62
00:04:23,368 --> 00:04:24,450
I'm totally disappointed.

63
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,492
Dubai is on the other side of the world.

64
00:04:26,659 --> 00:04:28,242
Try to understand him.

65
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:31,034
But he sent you an awful lot of flowers.

66
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,567
Hey, we should take a photo.

67
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:34,984
I'm going to send it to Dad.

68
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,109
Okay.

69
00:04:38,609 --> 00:04:40,650
Say cheese.

70
00:04:41,359 --> 00:04:42,318
Je Ni!

71
00:04:43,151 --> 00:04:43,984
My goodness.

72
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:45,026
Congratulations.

73
00:04:45,109 --> 00:04:46,567
Congrats. Here. Take this.

74
00:04:46,859 --> 00:04:48,234
And this is...

75
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,525
Thank you.

76
00:04:49,609 --> 00:04:50,900
You can hold it, Ms Kang.

77
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,817
Instead of the regular school lunch,

78
00:04:56,026 --> 00:04:57,192
I got the buffet table arranged

79
00:04:57,217 --> 00:04:58,050
for everyone.

80
00:04:58,168 --> 00:04:59,002
Goodness.

81
00:04:59,027 --> 00:05:00,693
And for the teachers,

82
00:05:01,026 --> 00:05:02,151
I booked a place

83
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:04,026
that serves premium beef.

84
00:05:04,109 --> 00:05:05,234
Goodness gracious!

85
00:05:05,442 --> 00:05:07,602
You're so generous, Ms Kang. - Oh, well.

86
00:05:07,627 --> 00:05:09,128
Wait, you should have a bite of this.

87
00:05:09,153 --> 00:05:10,153
This one.

88
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,392
Goodness.

89
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,226
Thank you!

90
00:05:21,159 --> 00:05:22,201
This is great.

91
00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:31,159
Please excuse me.

92
00:05:32,242 --> 00:05:33,575
"Yoo Je Ni Accepted to Cheonga Arts High!"

93
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,700
"Congratulations"

94
00:05:42,368 --> 00:05:43,825
Bae Ro Na, I heard you are

95
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:45,034
the number one on the waiting list.

96
00:05:46,076 --> 00:05:47,784
That little-- - She's on the waiting list?

97
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,825
My goodness, that poor thing.

98
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:53,284
You were so confident before,

99
00:05:53,368 --> 00:05:55,242
but you completely lost your face now.

100
00:05:55,885 --> 00:05:58,052
That's why you should only do things

101
00:05:58,077 --> 00:05:59,493
that are in your league.

102
00:05:59,825 --> 00:06:00,992
How could you even think

103
00:06:01,242 --> 00:06:02,450
of sending a girl with no talent

104
00:06:02,533 --> 00:06:03,533
to Cheonga Arts High?

105
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:05,409
The one with no talent

106
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,450
isn't Ro Na, but your daughter.

107
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,026
I'm sure something went wrong.

108
00:06:11,335 --> 00:06:12,794
How can Je Ni get in

109
00:06:13,368 --> 00:06:14,575
when Ro Na couldn't?

110
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,368
Can't you see that?

111
00:06:17,192 --> 00:06:18,234
You've seen that already.

112
00:06:18,567 --> 00:06:20,859
Do you still live in that delusion?

113
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,650
That's the truth,

114
00:06:23,276 --> 00:06:24,318
and that's what's right.

115
00:06:24,567 --> 00:06:25,442
Get it?

116
00:06:27,609 --> 00:06:28,692
That woman.

117
00:06:28,775 --> 00:06:29,692
Right.

118
00:06:29,775 --> 00:06:31,359
There's an orphan who got accepted.

119
00:06:31,942 --> 00:06:33,442
You should go find that student.

120
00:06:33,817 --> 00:06:34,734
Who knows?

121
00:06:35,109 --> 00:06:37,400
If you give her a pile of cash,

122
00:06:37,483 --> 00:06:38,859
she might give up.

123
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,400
Congrats! - Congrats!

124
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:50,650
Je Ni, congrats. - Great job!

125
00:06:50,734 --> 00:06:52,109
I'm so jealous. - I knew you could do it.

126
00:06:52,192 --> 00:06:53,900
Good for you! - Congratulations.

127
00:06:53,984 --> 00:06:55,026
Well done. - That's awesome.

128
00:06:55,525 --> 00:06:56,567
That's really great.

129
00:06:57,567 --> 00:06:58,483
Thanks a lot, Je Ni.

130
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,400
Doesn't it look good?

131
00:07:01,067 --> 00:07:01,984
It's good.

132
00:07:02,692 --> 00:07:04,692
Are you going to have more? - Of course.

133
00:07:04,775 --> 00:07:05,900
You should eat some.

134
00:07:06,942 --> 00:07:08,692
My mum is celebrating I got accepted.

135
00:07:08,984 --> 00:07:11,109
I'm not in the mood to talk to you,

136
00:07:11,483 --> 00:07:12,609
so get lost.

137
00:07:15,192 --> 00:07:16,192
What's with this?

138
00:07:16,984 --> 00:07:17,942
What's wrong?

139
00:07:18,817 --> 00:07:19,859
What's going on?

140
00:07:20,817 --> 00:07:22,234
You wish someone who got accepted

141
00:07:22,318 --> 00:07:23,817
would just die right now, don't you?

142
00:07:24,984 --> 00:07:25,817
Then you'd get in

143
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:26,900
as the top of the waiting list.

144
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:31,900
Gosh, you look like

145
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:33,400
you might kill someone.

146
00:07:34,942 --> 00:07:36,151
Bad news.

147
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,276
The list had been decided already,

148
00:07:39,067 --> 00:07:40,026
kiddo.

149
00:07:41,984 --> 00:07:43,151
What are you talking about?

150
00:07:43,234 --> 00:07:44,151
You didn't know?

151
00:07:44,817 --> 00:07:46,817
There are 23 spots for vocal music majors.

152
00:07:47,026 --> 00:07:48,775
They let kids from rich families in,

153
00:07:49,026 --> 00:07:50,192
then throw in a few geniuses

154
00:07:50,276 --> 00:07:51,276
to make the school seem genuine.

155
00:07:51,692 --> 00:07:52,609
So someone like you has

156
00:07:52,817 --> 00:07:54,692
zero chance to get in the school.

157
00:07:55,984 --> 00:07:57,318
A girl who has to worry about

158
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,318
the cost of her dress

159
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,692
doesn't seem to belong at Cheonga.

160
00:07:59,775 --> 00:08:00,609
Hey, Yoo Je Ni!

161
00:08:00,692 --> 00:08:01,650
Also,

162
00:08:01,734 --> 00:08:03,609
let me tell you this as I feel for you.

163
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,650
Ever since the school was founded,

164
00:08:05,734 --> 00:08:07,400
no one on the waiting list ever got in.

165
00:08:07,483 --> 00:08:08,400
So...

166
00:08:09,609 --> 00:08:10,692
wake up from your dream

167
00:08:10,775 --> 00:08:12,400
and give up as quickly as you can.

168
00:08:13,734 --> 00:08:15,400
There will be an orientation session

169
00:08:15,483 --> 00:08:16,650
for new students tomorrow

170
00:08:17,234 --> 00:08:18,318
and we'll have a celebration

171
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,483
at Hera Palace in a few days.

172
00:08:20,026 --> 00:08:20,900
Are you jealous?

173
00:08:21,318 --> 00:08:22,192
Boo-ya.

174
00:08:29,525 --> 00:08:30,442
Hey, Eun Byeol.

175
00:08:31,609 --> 00:08:34,817
Oh, the text for Cheonga's orientation?

176
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,984
Of course I got it.

177
00:08:38,984 --> 00:08:40,109
What time are you going to go?

178
00:08:41,276 --> 00:08:42,109
Eight in the morning?

179
00:08:42,318 --> 00:08:43,276
I'll get there around then.

180
00:08:43,359 --> 00:08:44,859
"Eun Byeol"? - Should we go together?

181
00:08:46,942 --> 00:08:49,109
Darn it. No.

182
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,318
That's Ha Eun Byeol.

183
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,650
Eun Byeol must've messed up.

184
00:08:51,859 --> 00:08:53,400
So what if she did?

185
00:08:53,692 --> 00:08:54,525
Her grandpa

186
00:08:54,609 --> 00:08:55,483
is the chief director of the school board.

187
00:08:57,442 --> 00:08:59,067
She definitely made a mistake then.

188
00:09:01,692 --> 00:09:03,775
Please let me see Ms Cheon Seo Jin.

"Celebrating Eun Byeol's admission"

190
00:09:07,067 --> 00:09:09,151
I have something to tell her. Please?

191
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:10,900
I already said you can't do that.

192
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,942
You can't go in without an appointment.

193
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,650
Stop making a scene and go home.

194

196
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,318
Hey.

197
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,692
What are you doing?

Hey!

Bae Ro Na.

201
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:36,650
What do you think you're doing?

202
00:09:37,067 --> 00:09:37,984
Do you know her?

203
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,609
It's her. The top of the waiting list.

204
00:09:39,817 --> 00:09:40,900
I see.

205
00:09:41,442 --> 00:09:42,483
Why are you making a scene here?

206
00:09:42,567 --> 00:09:43,525

You. You're Ha Eun Byeol.

What's with you?

209
00:09:48,817 --> 00:09:49,942
I saw you

210
00:09:50,067 --> 00:09:51,650
coming out crying from the audition hall.

211
00:09:52,276 --> 00:09:53,359
You made a mistake, didn't you?

212
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,900
What are you talking about?

213
00:09:55,151 --> 00:09:56,817
I didn't make any mistake.

214
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,859
You made a mistake

215
00:09:58,151 --> 00:09:59,109
and messed up your audition,

216
00:09:59,192 --> 00:10:00,026
but you still got in

217
00:10:00,109 --> 00:10:01,109
thanks to your mum, didn't you?

218
00:10:01,525 --> 00:10:02,442
I heard your grandpa is

219
00:10:02,525 --> 00:10:03,525
the chief director of the school board.

220
00:10:04,359 --> 00:10:05,276
Something's going on.

221
00:10:05,483 --> 00:10:06,692
Right? Something is going on.

222
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,859
Let me go. Nothing is going on.

223
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:10,650
Let go. You're wrong.

224
00:10:10,734 --> 00:10:11,609
Let her go!

225
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,775
What on earth have you done?

226
00:10:19,817 --> 00:10:21,442
This is the only way you'd see me.

227
00:10:21,859 --> 00:10:22,775
What?

228
00:10:22,942 --> 00:10:23,900
Tell me

229
00:10:24,318 --> 00:10:25,400
why I didn't pass the audition.

230
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,359
I didn't make a mistake like she did,

231
00:10:28,442 --> 00:10:30,318
and all my lyrics and notes were correct.

232
00:10:30,567 --> 00:10:31,900
So why didn't I make it?

233
00:10:32,775 --> 00:10:33,984
Show me the scores.

234
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:35,400
I will not accept the results

235
00:10:35,442 --> 00:10:36,650
until I see the scores myself.

236
00:10:40,151 --> 00:10:42,276
You're just like your mother

237
00:10:43,067 --> 00:10:44,567
in playing the victim.

238
00:10:45,318 --> 00:10:46,692
What did you say? - Face it.

239
00:10:46,984 --> 00:10:48,859
You weren't good enough, that's all.

240
00:10:49,234 --> 00:10:50,734
What about her? She made a mistake.

241
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:54,109
It wasn't a huge mistake anyway.

242
00:10:55,109 --> 00:10:56,359
And we hold the audition

243
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,109
to choose students who have potential.

244
00:10:58,318 --> 00:11:00,067
You have zero talent for music.

245
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:01,483
So stop causing trouble

246
00:11:01,567 --> 00:11:02,609
and get out of here now.

247
00:11:02,692 --> 00:11:03,609
No.

248
00:11:04,109 --> 00:11:05,109
I know for a fact

249
00:11:05,192 --> 00:11:06,400
that the admission was corrupted.

250
00:11:06,984 --> 00:11:08,692
I cannot accept this.

251
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,817
Corrupt admissions?

252
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,859
Can you be responsible for what you said?

253
00:11:13,151 --> 00:11:14,276
The students who got accepted

254
00:11:14,359 --> 00:11:15,359
had been decided already, right?

255
00:11:16,359 --> 00:11:17,234
That's how Ha Eun Byeol got in

256
00:11:17,318 --> 00:11:18,234
despite her mistake!

257
00:11:25,734 --> 00:11:26,817
If you do not leave now,

258
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,276
you'll get dragged out.

259
00:11:28,692 --> 00:11:30,234
The one who bought out my teacher

260
00:11:30,734 --> 00:11:31,692
was you, lady.

261
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,276
"Lady"?

262
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,192
You never taught me.

263
00:11:35,775 --> 00:11:36,900
Why should I call you Ms Cheon?

264
00:11:40,525 --> 00:11:41,442
Goodness.

265
00:11:42,692 --> 00:11:44,067
I'm not going to move an inch

266
00:11:44,151 --> 00:11:45,775
until you show me the scores.

267
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:48,775
Hey. - Eun Byeol.

268
00:11:48,859 --> 00:11:49,775
What are you doing?

269
00:11:49,859 --> 00:11:50,817
Get up.

270
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,859
Get up!

271
00:11:54,276 --> 00:11:55,151
Eun Byeol!

272
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:58,151
Eun Byeol! Are you okay?

273
00:11:58,525 --> 00:12:00,234
My arm hurts. - Are you all right?

276
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:16,859
Ro Na, are you okay?

277
00:12:16,942 --> 00:12:17,900
Mum. - Are you hurt?

278
00:12:18,026 --> 00:12:19,192
What happened to your hands?

279
00:12:19,359 --> 00:12:21,109
Eun Byeol got hurt, not her.

280
00:12:22,817 --> 00:12:23,734
I can't believe

281
00:12:23,817 --> 00:12:25,400
how barbarically strong she is.

282
00:12:25,734 --> 00:12:26,734
What did you say?

283
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,109
What have you done to my daughter?

284
00:12:29,192 --> 00:12:30,942
My goodness, please.

285
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:32,109
Goodness.

286
00:12:33,109 --> 00:12:35,817
Starting now, you can talk to me.

287
00:12:38,151 --> 00:12:39,692
Please take care of this, Mr Lee.

288
00:12:40,567 --> 00:12:41,567
I won't show her mercy,

289
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,067
so punish her according to the law.

290
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:49,318
Why are you letting her go?

291
00:12:49,609 --> 00:12:50,650
You can't just trust her

292
00:12:50,734 --> 00:12:52,567
and let her go! What are you going to do?

293
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,276
What do you think?

294
00:12:54,734 --> 00:12:56,026
You and your daughter

295
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,400
can take the punishment.

296
00:12:58,525 --> 00:13:00,609
Now, here's the security footage,

297
00:13:00,817 --> 00:13:02,942
and I prepared this

298

for you to see with your own eyes

299
00:13:04,692 --> 00:13:05,609
just in case.

300
00:13:05,984 --> 00:13:06,984
I may look like this,

301
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,817
but I'm pretty kind for an attorney.

302
00:13:08,984 --> 00:13:09,817

303
00:13:10,276 --> 00:13:11,276

She kept trying to pull me up.

00:13:23,359 --> 00:13:24,692
It's okay. It's all right, Ro Na.

307
00:13:24,775 --> 00:13:27,483
Look, that's assault,

308
00:13:27,609 --> 00:13:29,026
property damage,

309
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:31,692
spreading rumour and defamation.

310
00:13:31,984 --> 00:13:34,234
She's guilty of numbers of things.

311
00:13:35,067 --> 00:13:35,984
Right.

312
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:37,775
She has a history of school violence too.

313
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:39,359
What a shame.

314
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,192
How did you educate your kid?

315
00:13:41,276 --> 00:13:42,109
Hey!

316
00:13:42,192 --> 00:13:43,067
And look.

317
00:13:43,567 --> 00:13:44,483
Slide to the next video.

"Cam 212"

319
00:13:48,234 --> 00:13:49,567
The mum and the daughter are

320
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:50,650
both extreme in nature.

321
00:13:52,026 --> 00:13:53,026
This is...

322
00:13:53,859 --> 00:13:54,817
Gosh.

323
00:13:57,234 --> 00:13:58,067
Right.

324
00:13:58,442 --> 00:14:00,775
She filed a suit against you too.

325
00:14:01,192 --> 00:14:03,026
Both you and your daughter

326
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:04,400
have been continuously harassing

327
00:14:04,442 --> 00:14:05,400
Ms Cheon and her daughter,

328
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,483
and we'll make sure

329
00:14:07,567 --> 00:14:09,609
you two get punished for what you did.

330
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:13,151
For your information,

331
00:14:13,234 --> 00:14:14,483
we won't settle the case.

332
00:14:15,109 --> 00:14:16,525
But if you insist,

333
00:14:17,067 --> 00:14:18,067
we'll drop both cases

334
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:19,942
for 100 million won.

335
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:22,400
What?

336
00:14:23,525 --> 00:14:24,859
How does that make any sense?

337
00:14:26,734 --> 00:14:28,859
That was the end of my role.

338
00:14:32,151 --> 00:14:33,984
If you can't find the money to settle,

339
00:14:34,276 --> 00:14:35,900
we'll take legal actions right away,

340
00:14:35,984 --> 00:14:37,026
so it's your choice.

341
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:38,525
Goodness.

342
00:14:39,483 --> 00:14:41,483
Why did you mess with Ms Cheon?

343
00:14:41,734 --> 00:14:43,109
You don't have any power or connections.

344
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,609
Is she stupid or naive?

345

Will you please do something?

347
00:15:14,609 --> 00:15:15,483
Are you okay?

348
00:15:49,984 --> 00:15:50,984
Oh Yoon Hee.

349
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:02,692
Darn it.

350
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,817
You're late.

351
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,109
Seo Jin left a while ago.

352
00:16:06,525 --> 00:16:07,400
Did she?

353
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,734
I have to go back to the hospital.

354
00:16:10,234 --> 00:16:11,483
The assailant went to high school

355
00:16:11,567 --> 00:16:13,109
with Seo Jin. Did you know?

356
00:16:15,151 --> 00:16:16,109
Isn't that interesting?

357
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:18,817
Yes, this is interesting.

358
00:16:20,067 --> 00:16:23,234
Kyu Jin is very quick with these things.

359

Aren't you scared?

I'm an expert on affairs.

00:16:31,775 --> 00:16:34,192
Gosh, this is so exciting.

362
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:43,400
You made a mistake

363
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:44,525
and messed up your audition,

364
00:16:44,609 --> 00:16:45,609
but you still got in

365
00:16:45,692 --> 00:16:46,567
thanks to your mum, didn't you?

366
00:16:47,151 --> 00:16:48,109
I heard your grandpa

367
00:16:48,192 --> 00:16:49,192
is the chief director of the school board.

368
00:16:50,859 --> 00:16:51,775

That was a mistake.

00:17:44,734 --> 00:17:46,151
That wasn't what I am really capable of.

377
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,942
It'll be fine if I keep my mouth shut.

378

381
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,400
we'll drop both cases

382
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,276
for 100 million won.

Oh, really?

384
00:18:31,692 --> 00:18:34,109
I don't care if it takes a while.

385
00:18:34,192 --> 00:18:35,817
Tell her that I won't settle for anything.

386
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:37,359
Okay.

387
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:40,318
Great work today, Mr Lee.

00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:56,026
She is on another level.

503

515
00:24:21,276 --> 00:24:23,151
Why? Are you scared?

516
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,318
Let her go.

517
00:24:24,859 --> 00:24:26,151
Take your seat.

518
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,734
Who's Min Seol A?

519
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:39,692
"Chief Director's Office"

520
00:24:39,775 --> 00:24:41,109
"Headmaster's Office"

521
00:24:54,567 --> 00:24:55,483
Come in.

522
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,900
We have a lot to talk about, don't we?

523
00:25:01,775 --> 00:25:04,234
I'm sure you already know my father is

524
00:25:04,318 --> 00:25:05,609
the chief director here.

525
00:25:08,817 --> 00:25:10,359
If you sign the disclaimer that says

526
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,400
you give up on your admission,

527
00:25:12,942 --> 00:25:15,026
I won't hold you responsible for anything.

528
00:25:15,692 --> 00:25:17,900
You were accepted as the first place,

529
00:25:18,109 --> 00:25:19,609
so you should save your face.

530
00:25:20,483 --> 00:25:22,692
Sign that paper and leave.

531
00:25:24,483 --> 00:25:25,692
I'm going to attend this school.

532
00:25:28,525 --> 00:25:29,400
What?

533
00:25:29,483 --> 00:25:31,692
I don't understand why I should give up.

534
00:25:31,942 --> 00:25:33,609
You really are something.

535
00:25:34,775 --> 00:25:35,650
What's that naive look

536
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:36,609
as if you did nothing wrong

537
00:25:36,692 --> 00:25:38,192
after you deceived people?

538
00:25:39,026 --> 00:25:40,567
It's a crime to forge your identity

539
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:41,609
and documents

540
00:25:41,692 --> 00:25:42,859
to trick people for the tuition money.

541
00:25:42,984 --> 00:25:45,276
I got accepted thanks to my talent.

542
00:25:46,234 --> 00:25:47,734
It's a different matter from that.

543
00:25:48,192 --> 00:25:49,151
Is it?

544
00:25:50,109 --> 00:25:52,318
You're young, naive, and ignorant.

545
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:54,234
Do you want to ruin your life

546
00:25:54,318 --> 00:25:55,400
for forging documents?

547
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,525
At the very least,

548
00:25:57,942 --> 00:25:59,942
I did my best for the money I got paid.

549
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:01,609
You were also grateful

550
00:26:01,692 --> 00:26:03,067
because Eun Byeol's grades went up.

551
00:26:03,692 --> 00:26:05,276
If you still say the tuition is a problem,

552
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:06,817
I'll do part-time jobs to pay it back.

553
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:09,775
So I can't give up on my admission.

554
00:26:09,942 --> 00:26:12,192
You shrewd and impudent thing.

555
00:26:12,609 --> 00:26:13,692
People have a bad idea of orphans

556
00:26:13,775 --> 00:26:15,650
because of kids like you.

557
00:26:16,151 --> 00:26:16,984
Stop talking,

558
00:26:17,067 --> 00:26:18,483
sign that now, and leave.

559
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,817
"Chief Director Cheon Myung Soo"

560
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,400
Please let me sing.

561
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:25,525
I want to sing.

562
00:26:26,942 --> 00:26:28,984
Do you really think I'll let you in?

563
00:26:29,442 --> 00:26:31,276
It's horrifying and chilling to think

564
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:32,900
you could've affected my daughter.

565
00:26:32,984 --> 00:26:33,942
The fact that you two were

566
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:34,942
breathing in the same room

567
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:36,192
feels disgusting on its own.

568
00:26:36,567 --> 00:26:37,525
I can't believe she got involved with

569
00:26:37,609 --> 00:26:38,734
a girl who got never educated at home.

570
00:26:39,234 --> 00:26:40,151
Unbelievable.

571
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:41,567
My gosh.

572
00:26:44,151 --> 00:26:46,192
I'm also a human, just like Eun Byeol.

573
00:26:46,942 --> 00:26:48,609
Did I make her ill or what?

574
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,151
Your daughter isn't the only precious one.

575
00:26:54,442 --> 00:26:56,067
How dare you compare yourself to her?

576
00:26:56,567 --> 00:26:58,483
Are you saying an orphan like you

577
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,567
is as good as my precious girl?

578
00:27:03,318 --> 00:27:04,567
Do you think Eun Byeol knows

579
00:27:06,734 --> 00:27:08,067
what her mum is like?

580
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,525
What are you trying to say?

581
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:16,859
The 35th floor. The garden.

582
00:27:18,442 --> 00:27:19,567
The man from the penthouse.

583
00:27:24,734 --> 00:27:25,692
What?

584
00:27:28,734 --> 00:27:30,567
Eun Byeol is very conscious of Seok Kyung.

585
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,109
If she finds out about your relationship

586
00:27:33,192 --> 00:27:34,109
with the man in the penthouse,

587
00:27:34,984 --> 00:27:36,067
how would she feel?

588
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:43,859
What did you just say?

589
00:27:45,483 --> 00:27:46,609
Do you finally understand

590
00:27:47,067 --> 00:27:48,442
what I'm trying to say?

591
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,609
I'm going to attend this school.

592
00:27:51,442 --> 00:27:52,692
If you let me do that,

593
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,692
I won't tell anyone.

594
00:28:05,151 --> 00:28:06,817
You can't pull this nonsense on me.

595
00:28:09,318 --> 00:28:10,442
What did you see?

596
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:15,359
Do I have to say it in my own words?

597
00:28:16,234 --> 00:28:17,567
It was a misunderstanding.

598
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,442
I don't know.

599
00:28:23,026 --> 00:28:24,109
I'm not sure

600
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,984
if others will also think the same

601
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:27,942
after seeing the video.

602
00:28:30,026 --> 00:28:31,276
I'll see you when school begins.

603
00:28:36,525 --> 00:28:37,442
"The video"?

604
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,775
I'll make sure I call her out later.

605
00:28:48,859 --> 00:28:50,067
Nice. - Just wait.

606
00:28:50,276 --> 00:28:51,817
Her admission might get cancelled.

607
00:28:52,276 --> 00:28:53,817
She went to the chief director's office.

608
00:28:54,318 --> 00:28:55,318
I heard she was the first place.

609
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,525
She must be an excellent singer.

610
00:28:58,734 --> 00:28:59,734
Will they kick out the first place?

611
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:07,151
Boys, I'm sorry to barge in,

612
00:29:07,234 --> 00:29:08,400
but may I see that?

613
00:29:08,859 --> 00:29:10,609
Sure. - Thanks.

614
00:29:13,192 --> 00:29:14,151
"The truth about Min Seol A"

615
00:29:14,234 --> 00:29:15,483
"She got caught walking into a bar"

616
00:29:16,109 --> 00:29:17,318
She was the first place?

617
00:29:17,483 --> 00:29:18,400
Yes.

618
00:29:18,817 --> 00:29:20,109
But she might get kicked out.

619
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:21,567
She's an orphan

620
00:29:21,817 --> 00:29:23,650
who got caught working at a bar.

621
00:29:26,151 --> 00:29:27,817
Hey, isn't that Min Seol A?

622
00:29:28,026 --> 00:29:28,942
Hey.

623
00:29:29,525 --> 00:29:30,650
She's charismatic.

624
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:36,692
Thanks.

625
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,525
Why did you suddenly visit Hye In?

626
00:29:42,817 --> 00:29:44,567
Our kids got into high school,

627
00:29:45,775 --> 00:29:47,483
so I'm going to give her more attention.

628
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:53,318
She hasn't been doing well lately.

629
00:29:54,026 --> 00:29:55,026
"Cam 01"

630
00:29:55,109 --> 00:29:56,026
Okay, you should do that.

631
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,400
I'll stop by right after work.

632
00:29:58,067 --> 00:29:59,483
Okay. See you later.

633
00:30:21,609 --> 00:30:23,192
The colour of the diamond

634
00:30:23,276 --> 00:30:24,942
is gorgeous and elegant,

635
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,609
just like her.

636
00:30:28,234 --> 00:30:29,109
I like it.

637
00:30:30,151 --> 00:30:31,067
I'll wrap it up for you.

638
00:30:31,151 --> 00:30:32,026
Sure.

639
00:30:39,984 --> 00:30:40,859
Soo Ryeon?

640
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,026
I can't believe you called me first.

641
00:30:43,984 --> 00:30:44,900
It feels great.

642
00:30:45,692 --> 00:30:47,692
Are you coming back during this break?

643
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,359
My parents say we should get married--

644
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,359
Let us

645
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:53,650
break off our engagement.

646
00:30:54,483 --> 00:30:56,775
What did you just say?

647
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:00,650
I can't deceive my feelings anymore.

648
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,775
I already told my father.

649
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:09,609
I am

650
00:31:10,109 --> 00:31:12,026
going to get married soon in the US.

651
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,192
I'm sorry, Dan Tae.

652
00:31:16,276 --> 00:31:18,525
You won't be able to reach me from now on.

653
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,692
Hello? Hello...

654
00:31:31,692 --> 00:31:32,650
Who says you can do that?

655
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:35,942
You can't break off our engagement.

656
00:31:37,525 --> 00:31:38,442
Who says you can?

657
00:31:39,942 --> 00:31:41,359
You can't break off our engagement!

658
00:31:43,734 --> 00:31:45,400
Is his kid still that dear to you?

659
00:31:46,192 --> 00:31:47,900
You still can't give up?

660
00:32:05,067 --> 00:32:05,942
Yes?

661
00:32:06,151 --> 00:32:07,026
This is bad.

662
00:32:11,859 --> 00:32:13,026
That girl knows?

663
00:32:13,692 --> 00:32:14,525
Are you sure?

664
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:15,609
She knows about this place.

665
00:32:15,775 --> 00:32:16,859
She definitely saw us.

666
00:32:17,276 --> 00:32:18,109
Once she opens her mouth,

667
00:32:18,192 --> 00:32:19,151
that'll be the end of our lives.

668
00:32:20,026 --> 00:32:21,109
There's no security camera

669
00:32:21,192 --> 00:32:22,359
on the 35th floor, so don't worry.

670
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,817
She has the evidence.

671
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,318
I think she got something on her phone.

672
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,067
We have to find it and destroy it.

673
00:32:28,234 --> 00:32:29,276
What an interesting girl.

674
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,318
I'll manage.

675
00:32:33,734 --> 00:32:35,359
Are you crazy? We can't do this now.

676
00:32:35,775 --> 00:32:37,026
I'm driven mad with anxiety.

677
00:32:38,318 --> 00:32:39,942
Are you getting shaken

678
00:32:40,234 --> 00:32:41,318
by a little girl like her?

679
00:32:42,318 --> 00:32:43,234
Cheon Seo Jin, it's you.

680
00:32:45,483 --> 00:32:46,650
Min Seol A is

681
00:32:47,026 --> 00:32:48,359
not an ordinary girl.

682
00:32:48,775 --> 00:32:50,483
We don't have any time to spare.

683
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,151
It's me, Joo Dan Tae.

684
00:32:54,151 --> 00:32:55,067
Do you think

685
00:32:55,151 --> 00:32:56,400
I'll let a little girl destroy my life?

686
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:57,609
What are you going to do?

687
00:32:58,567 --> 00:32:59,567
Do you have a plan?

688
00:33:01,442 --> 00:33:02,817
Girls like that are easy to deal with.

689
00:33:03,234 --> 00:33:04,359
She'll pretend like she's smart,

690
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:05,984
trying to make use

691
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,567
of the weapon that she has.

692
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,318
But she has no idea

693
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,609
it'll turn into a knife that'll come back

694
00:33:11,483 --> 00:33:12,400
at her.

695
00:33:42,692 --> 00:33:43,650
If you die...

696
00:33:45,109 --> 00:33:46,151
If you give up...

697
00:34:49,642 --> 00:34:50,601
I must be going crazy.

698
00:34:50,684 --> 00:34:52,933
I can't do this to that poor girl.

699
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:55,350
There has to be another way.

700
00:35:02,476 --> 00:35:03,809
Hey, move it.

701
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:05,184
You have a lot to do.

702
00:35:05,267 --> 00:35:07,017
I'm sorry. I'll do it quickly.

703
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,850
Gosh, this is why it's never good

704
00:35:08,892 --> 00:35:09,892
to hire youngsters.

705
00:35:09,975 --> 00:35:11,933
I only hired you because you begged me.

706
00:35:36,975 --> 00:35:38,017
Gosh.

707
00:35:43,434 --> 00:35:44,517
Ms Oh.

708
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:46,184
I heard you're moving.

709
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:47,933
Did the landlord tell you to move out?

710
00:35:48,142 --> 00:35:49,100
No, it's not that.

711
00:35:49,684 --> 00:35:51,392
We're just downsizing.

712
00:35:51,559 --> 00:35:52,642
Where will you be moving?

713
00:35:53,392 --> 00:35:54,768
We haven't decided yet.

714
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:56,184
It's just me and my kid,

715
00:35:56,267 --> 00:35:57,392
so I'm sure we'll find something.

716
00:36:02,933 --> 00:36:05,768
Gosh, it's not easy to raise a kid.

717
00:36:07,933 --> 00:36:09,476
Hey, slow down.

718
00:36:22,726 --> 00:36:23,601
Stop the treatment.

719
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:25,768
It's unlikely that she'll wake up,

720
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,225
so why keep her on life support?

721
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:29,225
It's time to stop.

722
00:36:30,392 --> 00:36:31,726
She managed to live pretty long

723
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:34,059
while being well looked after

724
00:36:34,142 --> 00:36:35,933
by her fake parents.

725
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:37,809
Don't you agree?

726
00:36:38,601 --> 00:36:40,559
Your wife will be shocked.

727
00:36:42,642 --> 00:36:43,684
It's about time

728
00:36:44,684 --> 00:36:46,142
she tasted true misery.

729
00:36:50,684 --> 00:36:51,726
Get ready for it quietly.

730
00:37:02,476 --> 00:37:05,476
I don't know if this is okay.

731
00:37:05,975 --> 00:37:07,933
If the accuser finds out-- Gosh.

732
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:10,642
You know who the accuser is.

733
00:37:10,726 --> 00:37:12,309
She's no ordinary woman.

734
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:14,517
I'll deal with her.

735
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:16,017
I sent the settlement money,

736
00:37:16,184 --> 00:37:17,559
so make sure she gets it.

737
00:37:17,726 --> 00:37:18,768
Well, I guess

738
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:20,309
I have nothing to lose.

739
00:37:20,434 --> 00:37:21,476
Cheers.

740
00:37:22,476 --> 00:37:23,517
By the way,

741
00:37:23,809 --> 00:37:25,100
is she your first love?

742
00:37:26,142 --> 00:37:28,517
I can tell that she is.

743
00:37:29,017 --> 00:37:30,892
I thought you were the ambitious type.

744
00:37:31,184 --> 00:37:32,892
You actually have

745
00:37:32,975 --> 00:37:34,975
a naive side to you.

746
00:37:35,809 --> 00:37:38,184
Even if she is your first love,

747
00:37:38,309 --> 00:37:39,517
how could you spend

748
00:37:39,601 --> 00:37:41,768
100 million won so easily?

749
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,892
Or... My gosh.

750
00:37:45,601 --> 00:37:47,309
Are you two still seeing each other?

751
00:37:47,434 --> 00:37:49,392
Since when?

752
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:50,892
You seem very busy,

753
00:37:51,142 --> 00:37:52,517
but you still have time for fun.

754
00:37:54,184 --> 00:37:55,933
No, we are not seeing each other.

755
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,601
Goodness.

756
00:37:58,350 --> 00:37:59,850
Darn it.

757
00:38:00,642 --> 00:38:02,517
If Seo Jin finds out,

758
00:38:02,684 --> 00:38:04,059
we're both dead meat.

759
00:38:04,142 --> 00:38:05,517
Right?

760
00:38:06,392 --> 00:38:07,684
I wouldn't be surprised if it were to lead

761
00:38:08,392 --> 00:38:09,642
to a murder case at Hera Palace.

762
00:38:09,726 --> 00:38:12,225
Gosh, there will be blood everywhere.

763
00:38:13,809 --> 00:38:15,601
I finally get why she asked

764
00:38:15,684 --> 00:38:16,933
for 100 million won.

765
00:38:17,017 --> 00:38:19,059
She obviously did it for a reason.

766
00:38:19,142 --> 00:38:21,059
I could tell it had something to do

767
00:38:21,142 --> 00:38:21,975
with adultery.

768
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:25,184
You know, because I'm a divorce lawyer,

769
00:38:25,267 --> 00:38:27,350
I'm incredibly quick--

770
00:38:27,434 --> 00:38:29,225
Will you stop it already?

771
00:38:29,309 --> 00:38:30,809
Darn it!

772
00:38:35,684 --> 00:38:36,684
What...

773
00:38:38,434 --> 00:38:40,142
You scared me!

774
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:43,309
Hey! Brace yourself!

775
00:38:43,392 --> 00:38:45,559
I'll tell my mum on you!

776
00:38:48,184 --> 00:38:49,642
Why did you gather everyone?

777
00:38:49,933 --> 00:38:50,975
The parents of the kids who got in

778
00:38:51,059 --> 00:38:52,142
all signed this petition.

779
00:38:52,392 --> 00:38:54,350
It's for cancelling Seol A's admission.

780
00:38:54,434 --> 00:38:56,225
You can sign it and give it to me.

781
00:38:56,559 --> 00:38:58,309
I couldn't sit back and watch,

782
00:38:58,476 --> 00:39:00,642
so I decided to carry the ball.

783
00:39:00,975 --> 00:39:03,017
Of course we can't let that girl

784
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,476
go to school with our kids.

785
00:39:06,517 --> 00:39:08,642
All of us here signed it already.

786
00:39:08,768 --> 00:39:11,309
Soo Ryeon, you're going to sign it, right?

787
00:39:12,768 --> 00:39:14,225
Is this really necessary?

788
00:39:15,933 --> 00:39:17,559
Adults ganging up against that kid?

789
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:20,517
I can't agree with this.

790
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:24,017
Look at her talking like she's better

791
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,100
than everyone else.

792
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:26,975
She has to make a fuss over it.

793
00:39:27,059 --> 00:39:28,726
You did this

794
00:39:28,809 --> 00:39:30,642
without my permission?

795
00:39:31,184 --> 00:39:32,476
As you pleased?

796
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:33,726
Pardon?

797
00:39:34,768 --> 00:39:35,768
Well...

798
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:38,184
We didn't want to get you involved,

799
00:39:38,267 --> 00:39:39,809
so we did you a favour.

800
00:39:39,892 --> 00:39:41,726
What is with this reaction?

801
00:39:42,476 --> 00:39:43,434
Don't tell me

802
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,100
Min Seol A also knows about the petition.

803
00:39:46,267 --> 00:39:48,559
I'm sure she knows.

804
00:39:48,809 --> 00:39:50,142
The rumour has already spread

805
00:39:50,225 --> 00:39:51,184
throughout the school.

806
00:39:51,267 --> 00:39:53,267
Why do something I never even asked for?

807
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:54,559
Why mess with her?

808
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:55,975
I said I'll take care of everything.

809
00:40:06,476 --> 00:40:07,726
Am I really the only one

810
00:40:07,809 --> 00:40:08,809
who's not qualified?

811
00:40:09,517 --> 00:40:11,434
Hey. Save me. Please, save me.

812
00:40:11,517 --> 00:40:14,059
All right. Look over here.

813
00:40:14,142 --> 00:40:15,559
I'll make you look pretty.

814
00:40:15,642 --> 00:40:16,517
My gosh!

815
00:40:16,601 --> 00:40:17,933
What is this?

816
00:40:18,017 --> 00:40:19,684
Save me! - What on earth is this?

817
00:40:19,768 --> 00:40:20,809
Please, don't do this.

818
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:21,850
What is this? - Stop this!

819
00:40:21,933 --> 00:40:23,059
Don't do this--

820
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,768
Don't be scared. We're here

821
00:40:25,975 --> 00:40:27,850
to celebrate.

822
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:29,476
Ms Anna Lee, congratulations

823
00:40:29,601 --> 00:40:30,892
on entering Cheonga Arts High

824
00:40:30,975 --> 00:40:31,892
as first place.

825
00:40:31,975 --> 00:40:33,850
What are you to feel bad for us?

826
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:35,684
You should be punished.

827
00:40:35,768 --> 00:40:37,350
You're like this, and that's why

828
00:40:37,434 --> 00:40:38,642
your parents left you. - Awesome.

829
00:40:38,726 --> 00:40:40,601
Who do you think you are?

830
00:40:40,684 --> 00:40:42,309
What are you?

831
00:40:46,476 --> 00:40:47,559
Tell us the truth.

832
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,392
Don't keep anything from us.

833
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:51,434
Why bother asking?

834
00:40:51,517 --> 00:40:52,975
It's obvious that Seok Hoon led it.

835
00:40:53,059 --> 00:40:54,350
Seok Kyung planned it,

836
00:40:54,434 --> 00:40:55,809
and Seok Hoon led the other kids.

837
00:40:56,142 --> 00:40:57,142
Right?

838
00:40:57,975 --> 00:40:58,892
Je Ni, you had no choice

839
00:40:58,975 --> 00:41:00,017
but to go with them, right?

840
00:41:00,184 --> 00:41:02,476
Same goes for Min Hyuk. We could barely

841
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:03,850
hear his voice, right?

842
00:41:03,892 --> 00:41:05,350
Yes, that's right.

843
00:41:05,434 --> 00:41:07,100
Min Hyuk recorded it.

844
00:41:07,434 --> 00:41:08,809
And Je Ni cursed more than anybody else.

845
00:41:09,017 --> 00:41:09,850
They all took turns

846
00:41:09,933 --> 00:41:11,142
and drenched her in alcohol.

847
00:41:11,642 --> 00:41:13,850
This is a group assault.

848
00:41:14,059 --> 00:41:16,142
All of our kids were involved in this.

849
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:18,059
It's terrible and shameful.

850
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:20,601
We're also responsible as their parents.

851
00:41:21,309 --> 00:41:22,809
Our kids did something wrong,

852
00:41:23,267 --> 00:41:25,726
yet we're trying to kick Seol A out.

853
00:41:25,933 --> 00:41:27,267
Don't you think this is just wrong?

854
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:28,476
What's your point?

855
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:29,476
We should apologise

856
00:41:29,559 --> 00:41:30,768
and ask for forgiveness.

857
00:41:31,684 --> 00:41:33,142
And we have no right to ask the school

858
00:41:33,225 --> 00:41:34,476
to cancel her admission.

859
00:41:35,975 --> 00:41:37,267
Are you saying we should let

860
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:38,768
that sly brat walk all over us?

861
00:41:39,726 --> 00:41:41,225
Do you think your kids will be okay

862
00:41:41,309 --> 00:41:42,476
if people find out about this?

863
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:44,392
Their admission might be jeopardised,

864
00:41:44,476 --> 00:41:45,559
and the stigma will follow them

865
00:41:45,642 --> 00:41:46,892
to Seoul University of Music.

866
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:49,517
I don't think you realise

867
00:41:49,601 --> 00:41:50,517
the seriousness of this.

868
00:41:50,601 --> 00:41:52,267
What then? Are you saying

869
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:53,601
we should sweep it under the rug

870
00:41:53,684 --> 00:41:54,642
without apologising?

871
00:41:57,975 --> 00:41:59,184
Enough.

872
00:42:02,642 --> 00:42:04,809
We should talk to Seol A in person.

873
00:42:05,309 --> 00:42:07,267
The first anniversary party is tomorrow.

874
00:42:07,684 --> 00:42:08,601
If there's a problem,

875
00:42:08,684 --> 00:42:09,768
the party will be ruined.

876
00:42:10,434 --> 00:42:11,476
All of you should be

877
00:42:11,684 --> 00:42:13,059
extra careful until the party is over.

878
00:42:36,684 --> 00:42:38,975
Who turned this off?

879
00:42:49,726 --> 00:42:52,100
You are being fooled by Joo Dan Tae.

880
00:42:52,392 --> 00:42:55,100
Joo Hye In is not your daughter.

881
00:43:12,309 --> 00:43:13,684
"You are being fooled by Joo Dan Tae"

882
00:43:13,768 --> 00:43:15,142
"Joo Hye In is not your daughter"

883
00:43:20,975 --> 00:43:22,267
"Korea's Best DNA Testing Centre"

884
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:23,350
"Bio Geno"

885
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:39,559
"DNA Test Results"

886
00:43:42,892 --> 00:43:44,392
Our analysis shows

887
00:43:44,601 --> 00:43:46,850
that she's not your biological child.

888
00:43:52,225 --> 00:43:53,476
Hye In is...

889
00:43:55,559 --> 00:43:58,017
Hye In is not my daughter?

890
00:44:02,309 --> 00:44:03,559
How is this possible?

891
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:07,434
"Bio Geno"

892
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:09,059
I can't believe this.

893
00:44:16,059 --> 00:44:17,142
Then...

894
00:44:18,142 --> 00:44:19,642
where is my real daughter?

895
00:44:41,809 --> 00:44:42,768
"Seok Hoon and Seok Kyung's father"

896
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:43,933
Come to the 50th floor.

897
00:44:44,017 --> 00:44:45,142
"Come to the 50th floor."

898
00:44:50,809 --> 00:44:51,975
"50th Floor"

899
00:45:22,684 --> 00:45:24,933
You people are really scary.

900
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:29,059
Are you that afraid

901
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:30,975
that I'd expose everything?

902
00:45:31,559 --> 00:45:33,434
Then you never should've done it.

903
00:45:33,726 --> 00:45:34,933
Let's keep this simple.

904
00:45:36,109 --> 00:45:37,650
The video you have

905
00:45:37,942 --> 00:45:39,150
and the original voice recording.

906
00:45:39,859 --> 00:45:41,317
Just hand them over.

907
00:45:50,276 --> 00:45:52,484
Where is your phone?

908
00:45:52,775 --> 00:45:53,942
Did you think I'd trust you enough

909
00:45:54,025 --> 00:45:55,234
to bring my phone here?

910
00:45:56,067 --> 00:45:57,650
I'm not an idiot.

911
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:00,650
I will make sure I reveal

912
00:46:01,109 --> 00:46:02,733
your true faces to everyone.

913
00:46:05,733 --> 00:46:07,526
You're pretty smart.

914
00:46:08,526 --> 00:46:11,568
But I wonder how long you can hold out.

915
00:46:12,568 --> 00:46:15,484
I hope it won't be too painful.

916
00:46:48,918 --> 00:46:49,876
"Joo Hye In is not your daughter"

917
00:49:28,042 --> 00:49:29,834
"Ms Sim Soo Ryeon's baby"

918
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:35,842
There must be a problem with her brain

919
00:49:35,926 --> 00:49:36,926
due to her premature birth.

920
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:39,759
That poor thing just keeps sleeping.

921
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:41,467
It's my fault.

922
00:49:43,175 --> 00:49:44,759
It's all my fault.

923
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:46,676
Don't beat yourself up.

924
00:49:46,968 --> 00:49:48,592
I'll take care of your baby now.

925
00:49:49,259 --> 00:49:50,884
I even thought of a name for her, Hye In.

926
00:49:51,175 --> 00:49:52,259
Pretty name, right?

927
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:55,550
No.

928
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,509
It's already over between us.

929
00:49:58,592 --> 00:50:00,092
I have never forgotten about you.

930
00:50:01,175 --> 00:50:02,217
After you left me,

931
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:04,217
I got married impulsively and had twins.

932
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:06,092
But their mother died

933
00:50:06,175 --> 00:50:07,425
from septicaemia after giving birth.

934
00:50:08,217 --> 00:50:11,050
Would you be a mother

935
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:12,801
to my poor twins?

936
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:14,050
That is absurd.

937
00:50:14,425 --> 00:50:15,509
Please leave.

938
00:50:15,592 --> 00:50:16,634
I will protect both you

939
00:50:17,175 --> 00:50:18,175
and Hye In

940
00:50:18,342 --> 00:50:19,592
from now on.

941
00:50:20,842 --> 00:50:22,842
Just like my twins.

942
00:50:48,092 --> 00:50:49,259
How...

943
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:54,425
How could he do such a thing?

944
00:51:08,384 --> 00:51:09,467
Hello?

945
00:51:10,509 --> 00:51:12,342
Are you ready to listen

946
00:51:12,550 --> 00:51:13,509
to what I have to say?

947
00:51:14,634 --> 00:51:15,676
Who are you?

948
00:51:17,009 --> 00:51:19,217
I asked you if you believe

949
00:51:19,717 --> 00:51:21,133
that Joo Dan Tae has been fooling you.

950
00:51:21,759 --> 00:51:23,050
How can I believe you

951
00:51:23,133 --> 00:51:24,550
when I don't even know who you are?

952
00:51:25,217 --> 00:51:26,509
Who are you?

953
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:28,676
Your real daughter.

954
00:51:29,133 --> 00:51:30,425
Don't you want to find her?

955
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:33,092
My daughter?

956
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:36,676
Is she alive?

957
00:51:39,717 --> 00:51:41,300
Where is my daughter now?

958
00:51:41,842 --> 00:51:44,425
You're going to have to find her yourself.

959
00:51:44,801 --> 00:51:46,300
If you want to find your daughter,

960
00:51:46,384 --> 00:51:47,550
you must do as I say.

961
00:51:48,550 --> 00:51:49,926
If you do anything reckless,

962
00:51:50,342 --> 00:51:51,759
Joo Hye In and your daughter

963
00:51:51,842 --> 00:51:52,884
will both die.

964
00:51:53,592 --> 00:51:55,300
Just like that man in the US.

965
00:51:57,009 --> 00:51:58,092
Did my husband...

966
00:52:01,884 --> 00:52:03,926
really kill him?

967
00:52:04,676 --> 00:52:06,425
Believe what you want to believe.

968
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:08,717
What's important is that

969
00:52:09,384 --> 00:52:10,342
Joo Hye In's heart

970
00:52:10,467 --> 00:52:11,634
will also stop beating soon.

971
00:52:12,384 --> 00:52:13,425
If that happens,

972
00:52:14,009 --> 00:52:15,259
Joo Dan Tae's truth

973
00:52:15,634 --> 00:52:17,342
will be buried forever.

974
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:19,009
How dare you try to kill my daughter.

975
00:52:19,050 --> 00:52:20,467
Hye In is my daughter.

976
00:52:20,968 --> 00:52:22,259
If you even lay a finger on her,

977
00:52:22,342 --> 00:52:23,842
I will teach you a lesson.

978
00:52:25,259 --> 00:52:26,384
Hello?

979
00:52:28,133 --> 00:52:29,259
Hello?

980
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:48,592
Go to Somang Children's Home

981
00:53:48,676 --> 00:53:50,259
in Yeongdeungpo.

982
00:53:50,926 --> 00:53:52,133
Find the child that was left there

983
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:53,592
wrapped in a navy jacket

984
00:53:53,676 --> 00:53:54,801
in December of 2004.

985
00:54:14,994 --> 00:54:15,911
Gosh.

986
00:54:27,717 --> 00:54:28,634
Hello?

987
00:54:29,467 --> 00:54:30,384
Sorry?

988
00:54:31,092 --> 00:54:33,926
Cheon Seo Jin has dropped the charges?

989
00:54:34,926 --> 00:54:35,926
Why, out of the blue--

990
00:54:36,009 --> 00:54:37,133
She has been generous enough

991
00:54:37,217 --> 00:54:38,425
to let it go,

992
00:54:38,509 --> 00:54:39,592
and that's all you need to know.

993
00:54:39,676 --> 00:54:41,842
She said you don't need to thank her,

994
00:54:41,926 --> 00:54:43,467
so don't hover around her.

995
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:44,634
Goodbye.

996
00:54:45,717 --> 00:54:46,592
Gosh.

997
00:54:51,259 --> 00:54:53,842
This is very unlike her.

998
00:54:57,592 --> 00:54:58,884
Ro Na, what are you doing?

999
00:54:59,092 --> 00:55:00,801
It's the weekend. Let's go out...

1000
00:55:05,209 --> 00:55:06,751
What are you doing? Stop!

1001
00:55:06,834 --> 00:55:07,876
Ro Na. - Let go!

1002
00:55:09,375 --> 00:55:10,417
What's the matter?

1003
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,709
Ro Na, you'll hurt your neck. Stop it!

1004
00:55:12,792 --> 00:55:14,167
I said, stop!

1005
00:55:15,375 --> 00:55:17,042
Ro Na, enough. Stop it!

1006
00:55:17,125 --> 00:55:18,167
Gosh.

1007
00:55:19,042 --> 00:55:20,334
I don't want to sing any more.

1008
00:55:20,626 --> 00:55:21,709
What?

1009
00:55:22,384 --> 00:55:24,884
Ro Na, don't do this. Stop, please.

1010
00:55:24,968 --> 00:55:26,092
You'll hurt your neck!

1011
00:55:26,175 --> 00:55:27,717
You were right, Mum.

1012
00:55:28,342 --> 00:55:30,884
Talent? It's completely useless.

1013
00:55:31,259 --> 00:55:33,342
Money and connections trump it all.

1014
00:55:33,884 --> 00:55:36,009
A girl like me doesn't deserve to sing.

1015
00:55:38,092 --> 00:55:41,133
So I don't need my voice any more.

1016
00:55:41,592 --> 00:55:42,842
Ro Na, don't do this.

1017
00:55:42,926 --> 00:55:44,759
I don't care if I lose my voice.

1018
00:55:45,217 --> 00:55:46,717
Please stop!

1019
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:48,676
Gosh, please. Ro Na.

1020
00:55:48,918 --> 00:55:50,918
Just hit me instead. Just hit me.

1021
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,417
Hit me instead. Just hit me, Ro Na!

1022
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:56,292
Don't do this. Please stop!

1023
00:55:56,375 --> 00:55:59,250
Please... Please don't do this.

1024
00:55:59,334 --> 00:56:02,792
Ro Na, I'm sorry. It's all Mum's fault.

1025
00:56:02,876 --> 00:56:06,209
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1026
00:56:32,959 --> 00:56:33,834
What?

1027
00:56:34,417 --> 00:56:36,167
Min Seol A is in the mechanical room?

1028
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:37,500
What? Then...

1029
00:56:37,709 --> 00:56:38,834
you should've taken her phone from her

1030
00:56:38,918 --> 00:56:39,876
and destroyed it.

1031
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,292
Did you find her phone?

1032
00:56:41,918 --> 00:56:42,918
She'll talk soon.

1033
00:56:43,417 --> 00:56:44,876
I'll take care of it,

1034
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
so you don't need to check in on her.

1035
00:56:47,292 --> 00:56:48,500
Provoking that brat

1036
00:56:48,634 --> 00:56:49,759
will only make her more arrogant.

1037
00:56:49,842 --> 00:56:51,759
Still, I don't know how I feel about

1038
00:56:51,842 --> 00:56:52,968
locking up that young girl.

1039
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:55,133
We have to protect our children.

1040
00:56:55,217 --> 00:56:57,009
Their future is on the line.

1041
00:56:57,751 --> 00:56:59,292
How come Soo Ryeon isn't here?

1042
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:01,125
She's not feeling well, so I came alone.

1043
00:57:01,459 --> 00:57:02,792
I have to say, she seems

1044
00:57:02,876 --> 00:57:04,751
rather uninterested in her own kids.

1045
00:57:04,968 --> 00:57:07,175
Some might think she's their stepmother.

1046
00:57:12,259 --> 00:57:13,342
Let's wrap it up here.

1047
00:57:13,926 --> 00:57:15,592
I have a lot to do because of the event.

1048
00:57:15,676 --> 00:57:16,968
It's been a long time

1049
00:57:17,092 --> 00:57:17,968
since we last organised

1050
00:57:18,050 --> 00:57:19,342
such a big party for Hera Palace.

1051
00:57:19,842 --> 00:57:21,092
But our kids ruined everything.

1052
00:57:21,175 --> 00:57:22,217
Darn it.

1053
00:57:22,717 --> 00:57:23,676
This is upsetting.

1054
00:57:23,759 --> 00:57:24,968
Don't be upset.

1055
00:57:25,467 --> 00:57:26,801
It's just a small setback.

1056
00:57:27,634 --> 00:57:29,217
Let's throw a spectacular party

1057
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:30,133
to congratulate our kids

1058
00:57:30,217 --> 00:57:31,092
on getting accepted.

1059
00:57:31,425 --> 00:57:32,592
Bingo!

1060
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:35,009
Let me plan this party. Please?

1061
00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:39,220
"Somang Children's Home"

1062
00:57:48,384 --> 00:57:49,509
Over here. - Got it.

1063
00:57:49,676 --> 00:57:51,092
Coming through. - Hey, watch out.

1064
00:57:51,592 --> 00:57:53,050
Excuse me. May I help you?

1065
00:57:53,509 --> 00:57:55,384
Isn't this Somang Children's Home?

1066
00:57:55,467 --> 00:57:56,676
They moved.

1067
00:57:57,175 --> 00:57:59,384
We began the construction a few days ago.

1068
00:57:59,467 --> 00:58:01,550
Do you know where they moved to?

1069
00:58:01,801 --> 00:58:02,842
No, I don't.

1070
00:58:02,926 --> 00:58:04,175
Do you have the director's number?

1071
00:58:04,259 --> 00:58:05,676
The number changed

1072
00:58:05,759 --> 00:58:07,259
as soon as they received the money.

1073
00:58:07,717 --> 00:58:08,884
I heard the director was

1074
00:58:09,050 --> 00:58:10,968
closing down the whole children's home.

1075
00:58:12,092 --> 00:58:13,300
They closed it down?

1076
00:58:13,759 --> 00:58:15,009
Honestly, I don't know

1077
00:58:15,050 --> 00:58:16,759
how they lived here with all those kids.

1078
00:58:16,842 --> 00:58:18,300
It's so mouldy,

1079
00:58:18,592 --> 00:58:19,676
and there's no heating.

1080
00:58:19,759 --> 00:58:20,759
Goodness.

1081
00:58:20,842 --> 00:58:23,259
It's practically a dump.

1082
00:58:25,509 --> 00:58:27,175
"Aram Detective Agency"

1083
00:58:27,342 --> 00:58:29,217
I'll pay you handsomely.

1084
00:58:29,676 --> 00:58:30,968
The sooner, the better.

1085
00:58:31,634 --> 00:58:33,300
You said the place already shut down.

1086
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:35,342
How will I find the director?

1087
00:58:47,217 --> 00:58:48,175
My gosh.

1088
00:58:48,634 --> 00:58:49,842
If you find the director today,

1089
00:58:49,926 --> 00:58:51,384
I'll pay you twofold.

1090
00:58:52,425 --> 00:58:53,717
Get it done before the evening

1091
00:58:54,133 --> 00:58:55,509
and I'll pay you threefold.

1092
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:42,050
Are you feeling very ill?

1093
00:59:42,384 --> 00:59:43,467
Do you want me to stay with you?

1094
00:59:44,133 --> 00:59:45,217
No, it's okay.

1095
00:59:46,133 --> 00:59:47,467
You're in charge of the event.

1096
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:48,634
You should go.

1097
00:59:49,550 --> 00:59:50,634
Then I'll head over there now.

1098
00:59:50,717 --> 00:59:51,676
You can take your time.

1099
00:59:51,759 --> 00:59:52,842
Okay.

1100
00:59:54,842 --> 00:59:56,759
I'm sorry for making you worry.

1101
00:59:57,092 --> 00:59:58,300
Don't say that.

1102
00:59:58,592 --> 00:59:59,968
You're all I care about.

1103
01:00:02,926 --> 01:00:04,050
I'll see you in a bit.

1104
01:00:23,259 --> 01:00:24,217
Hello?

1105
01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:26,050
You found the director?

1106
01:00:28,467 --> 01:00:29,592
Where?

1107
01:00:30,509 --> 01:00:32,926
No! Darn it.

1108
01:00:33,926 --> 01:00:36,550
Let's see. If it was 2004...

1109
01:00:37,592 --> 01:00:39,550
You won't be able to find any records.

1110
01:00:39,676 --> 01:00:41,009
I discarded all the records

1111
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:43,425
when I closed the children's home.

1112
01:00:44,259 --> 01:00:45,384
Did you leave your kid

1113
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:47,133
at our children's home?

1114
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:49,717
Why did you decide to close it?

1115
01:00:50,926 --> 01:00:52,300
And what happened to those kids?

1116
01:00:52,509 --> 01:00:54,968
Do I owe you an explanation?

1117
01:00:55,342 --> 01:00:56,425
All my life,

1118
01:00:56,509 --> 01:00:57,509
I looked after orphans

1119
01:00:57,592 --> 01:00:59,509
and contributed to social welfare,

1120
01:00:59,592 --> 01:01:01,425
so I think I deserve to take it easy now.

1121
01:01:02,926 --> 01:01:04,133
Why even look for a child

1122
01:01:04,342 --> 01:01:06,009
whom you abandoned years ago?

1123
01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:16,509
You sold a children's home in the suburbs.

1124
01:01:16,592 --> 01:01:17,968
Where did you get the money to open

1125
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:19,592
a driving range of this size in Gangnam?

1126
01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:20,926
Can you tell me

1127
01:01:21,050 --> 01:01:22,425
where you got all the money?

1128
01:01:23,676 --> 01:01:25,175
I can do some digging and find out.

1129
01:01:25,842 --> 01:01:27,175
Shall I look into it?

1130
01:01:27,926 --> 01:01:29,759
I'm going to come here every single day.

1131
01:01:30,259 --> 01:01:31,509
I won't give up

1132
01:01:31,592 --> 01:01:33,050
until you show me the kids' records.

1133
01:01:33,592 --> 01:01:35,300
So fight me if you're willing

1134
01:01:35,384 --> 01:01:36,592
to risk everything you have.

1135
01:01:37,592 --> 01:01:38,884
Darn it.

1136
01:01:40,342 --> 01:01:42,217
That crazy woman.

1137
01:01:45,467 --> 01:01:46,634
Fine.

1138
01:01:47,467 --> 01:01:49,634
I'll hand over everything.

01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:55,300
"Children's Records"

1140
01:01:55,384 --> 01:01:57,175
Go ahead and look through it yourself.

1141
01:01:58,009 --> 01:02:00,425
Darn it. You totally ruined my day.

1142
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:02,175
However,

1143
01:02:02,592 --> 01:02:04,634
you cannot leak any information,

1144
01:02:04,717 --> 01:02:06,300
and no photos whatsoever. You got that?

1145
01:02:06,384 --> 01:02:07,467
Okay.

1146
01:02:07,676 --> 01:02:08,676
Good.

1148
01:02:26,676 --> 01:02:27,968
Where are you, my baby?

1149
01:02:28,425 --> 01:02:29,801
Mum's here.

1150
01:04:08,526 --> 01:04:10,150
They put in a lot of work.

1151
01:04:10,317 --> 01:04:11,776
I know, right? - Yes.

1152
01:04:11,942 --> 01:04:13,275
Come on up.

1153
01:04:13,609 --> 01:04:14,567
Great job. - Thanks.

Look at this.

It's all your fault.

1158

You're the reason why I'm living like this

and why my daughter

1163

ended up in such a mess.

1164
01:05:28,818 --> 01:05:30,526
It's all your fault.

What? Where are you calling from?

01:06:35,150 --> 01:06:37,567
Cheonga Arts High School? Okay.

1169
01:06:42,234 --> 01:06:43,150
What...

1170
01:06:43,942 --> 01:06:45,900
What did you just say?

1171
01:06:46,942 --> 01:06:48,900
We have an extra slot for Bae Ro Na

1172
01:06:48,942 --> 01:06:50,651
in the vocal music department.

1173
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:54,067
An extra slot?

1174
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:56,150
But why...

1175
01:06:56,317 --> 01:06:57,734
I mean, how?

No-- No way.

01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:15,692
Did I do it?

=Penthouse=

1181
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,667
What if she exposes our relationship?

1182
01:07:41,751 --> 01:07:43,626
People will think she's crazy.

1183
01:07:43,709 --> 01:07:45,125
Are you saying someone killed her?

1184
01:07:45,209 --> 01:07:46,083
Did you kill her?

1185
01:07:46,167 --> 01:07:47,334
Our kids killed her?

1186
01:07:47,417 --> 01:07:49,459
We have to do it to protect our kids.

1187

Honey, there's blood on your shirt.

Ms Oh, there's blood on your hand.

This will get rid of all the evidence.
