Cheon Seo Jin.

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,400
I'm done

8
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:48,940
running away.

9
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,490
Leave my room immediately.

10
00:00:58,610 --> 00:00:59,610
You can

11
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:02,280
never beat me even in death.

12
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,110
Cheon Seo Jin, the fake winner.

13
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,440
You thieving witch.

14
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,490
Mum, I'll call the guards.

15
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,070
That's not necessary.

16
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,240
Have you gone insane?

17
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,610
What are you doing in front of the kids?

18
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,440
It looks like you still love

19
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:23,570
fooling around with the trophy,

20
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,440
just like the old days.

21
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,150
Does it look like I'm joking?

22
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:30,860
What about after seeing this?

23
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:39,570
You must be doing this to make me

24
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:40,740
give lessons to your daughter.

25
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:42,990
My schedule is already full.

26
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,990
And I don't want to get involved with you.

27
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:46,990
If you got your answer, please leave.

28
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,860
Why would I let my girl take your lessons?

29
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,490
Who knows what you'll do

30
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:53,990
to my precious daughter?

31
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,490
Mum, what's with you?

32
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,820
No matter how good of a teacher you are,

33
00:01:59,030 --> 00:01:59,940
to me,

34
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,320
you're nothing.

35
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:05,530
My dear Ro Na

36
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,940
will get accepted fairly with her talent,

37
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,650
as long as you don't mess with it.

38
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,400
You're overtaken

39
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,400
with delusion and a sense of inferiority.

40
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:17,570
Get out of here now

41
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,490
before I report you to the police.

42
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,440
I'll come back

43
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:31,690
for this trophy.

44
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:33,900
I came

45
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,110
to tell you that.

46
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:41,570
Let's go, Ro Na.

47
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,070
Mum, who's that lady?

48
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,780
Who is she to talk to you like that?

49
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,110
We went to high school together.

50
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,820
She asked me to give her girl lessons,

51
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,570
then began to throw a fit when I declined.

52
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,030
She was like that back in school.

53
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,320
She's even worse

54
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,360
now that she lives a tough life.

55
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,780
It's all right.

56
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,610
This happens all the time.

57
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,240
Is that lady's daughter

58
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:08,740
trying to get into Cheonga Arts High?

59
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,990
I said that is not going to happen!

60
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,280
She's nowhere good enough anyway.

61
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,530
She was just bluffing.

62
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:25,490
Eun Byeol.

63
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,280
Are you ready to get accepted

64
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,490
to Cheonga High as the top of your class?

65
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,110
The top of my class?

66
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,360
You must be the top of your class

67
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,440
to sing a solo at the entrance ceremony.

68
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,400
Your grandfather will be there,

69
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:37,240
and I invited famous singers from abroad,

70
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,190
all for your sake.

71
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,440
Seok Kyung probably did well on her tests,

72
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,360
so you need to do well

73
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,320
on the practical test to win.

74
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,320
I will do better than her!

75
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,320
I'm also dying to win against her.

76
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,530
I've done my best to turn you

77
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:48,610
into the best singer.

78
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,320
Do you know how many kids out there

79
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,490
don't get any support?

80
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,650
You're the granddaughter

81
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,740
of the foundation chair of Cheonga High.

82
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,860
You aren't simply rich.

83
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,650
You were born with the pass to university.

84
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,440
Do you know how big that privilege is?

85
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:01,610
I do.

86
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:03,940
Practice is the only way.

87
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:05,610
Practise and practise again.

88
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:06,860
If you can't do it, make it happen.

89
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,860
Have the entire music memorised.

90
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,240
Sing as you wake up until you sleep,

91
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,320
and even sing in your dreams.

92
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:12,900
If Seok Kyung practises 100 times,

93
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,110
you need to do it 200 times.

94
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,360
That's the only way you can win.

95
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:18,990
Now, practise.

96
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,280
Mum.

97
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,440
Are you serious?

98
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:23,900
May I go to Cheonga Arts High?

99
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,530
Will you let me study vocal music?

100
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,900
Of course.

101
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:28,650
Ro Na, you can sing.

102
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,780
You said it's your wish.

103
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,570
We don't have much time left,

104
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,650
but I'll help you as much as I can.

105
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:36,860
I'll do a really great job.

106
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,440
I'll make sure I get in.

107
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,530
No, I can even be the top of my class.

108
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,400
I'll prove to you that my decision

109
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:45,740
wasn't made in vain.

110
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,320
Okay. Let's do that, sweetie.

111
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,280
Ro Na,

112
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,360
you already had a great voice

113
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,650
when you were just born.

114
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,650
You must make it happen with your talent

115
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,650
so that no one can mess with your result.

116
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,780
Can you do that?

117
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,650
Yes, of course I can.

118
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,360
Anyway, why did you do that to Ms Cheon?

119
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:06,780
The least you could do is beg her.

120
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,440
Why did you jump on her like that?

121
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,240
There's a long history

122
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,150
between Cheon Seo Jin and me.

123
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,990
We can always find another teacher.

124
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,320
I'll find you the best one out there.

125
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,440
Don't worry about anything.

126
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,030
And I'll do everything I can

127
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,820
so you won't have a punishment at school.

128
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,360
Do you think that'll be easy?

129
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:28,860
You kicked the headmaster

130
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:29,780
and knocked him over.

131
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,740
It's not like we're rich and powerful

132
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,780
like Je Ni and her family.

133
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,860
Just put your trust in me.

134
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,190
I won't let anything

135
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:39,570
ruin your life.

136
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:47,400
How brazen of you!

137
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:48,860
How dare you come here?

138
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,240
You're both violent and aggressive.

139
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,650
Like daughter, like mother.

140
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:57,570
I'm very sorry, Mr Kim.

141
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,820
I must have gone insane then.

142
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,280
It's all my fault,

143
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,280
so I'll gladly take the punishment, sir.

144
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:08,570
And I'll also cover

145
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:09,990
all of your hospital bills.

146
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,690
So please forgive

147
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,320
Ro Na.

148
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,990
Ro Na

149
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,860
really needs her diploma.

150
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:20,240
Do you think this is a crime

151
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,690
that can be forgiven?

152
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,650
Do you really think so?

153
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,530
What she has done is obviously

154
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,570
an infringement of a teacher's authority.

155
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,150
I will never turn a blind eye

156
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,530
to this incident!

157
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,240
If she knocked out

158
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,490
two of your perfectly good teeth,

159
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:35,570
this should be considered

160
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,320
almost as attempted murder.

161
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,490
You must hold the mother

162
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,990
and the daughter responsible

163
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,360
and nip it completely in the bud.

164
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,900
You have ruined

165
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,240
your daughter's life.

166
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:46,360
You're at fault.

167
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:47,400
Do you get it?

168
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,530
I am here

169
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,240
to apologise to the headmaster.

170
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,860
I'm not here to apologise to you.

171
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,030
What did you say?

172
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,110
Hey, have you gone insane?

173
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,030

All right.

I have ever given you?

If you can't,

183
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,580
you'd better get your act together, okay?

184
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:32,200
Yes.

185
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,660

You refused to take a level test,

250
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,290
so I had to look at your workbook

00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,590
Don't be so rude when your tutor is here.

a lot to lose, don't we?

00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,320
I don't think I can see you at a place

It's the master key.

291

Do they have to get their lessons at home?

You know that

305
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,450
I hate running into outsiders.

306
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,610
Who knows what their shoes caught

307
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,780
and what they touched with their hands?

308
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,240
And they'll come in and touch my things!

309

Throw out everything that's contaminated.

310
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,070
Throw away the cup she used,

311
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,400
and clean the bathroom again. - Yes, sir.

My husband is a germophobe.

317
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,820
Let me apologise on his behalf.

318
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,450
No, you don't have to.

They've been going through puberty,

Sure.

327
00:16:58,570 --> 00:16:59,530

00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,900
I guess I haven't checked in for a while.

331
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,530

an empty answer sheet on your test today.

336

Seok Kyung, what is he saying?

338
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,320
Dad, I'm sure it isn't true.

but you turned in an empty sheet today.

344
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,150
You didn't, right?

345
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:27,070
I must have heard something wrong.

346
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,900
It's true.

347
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,400
I don't want to go to Cheonga Arts High.

348
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:37,950
That's why I did that.

349
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,610
What did you say?

350
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,740
Seok Kyung.

351
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,240
What's with you?

352
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,990
I don't want to study vocal music.

353
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:47,900
You made me sing to this day,

354
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:49,900
and I don't want to do it.

355
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:54,740
I believe our family should have

356
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,320
at least one famous classical vocalist.

357
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,950
That has been my goal for a long time.

358
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,860
If it's your goal, why should I do it?

359
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,320
You never asked me once

360
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,280
what I want to do!

361
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,950
I hate singing on stage.

362
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,490
I hate it to death.

363
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:13,820
I don't want to do it.

364
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,320
I hate my school,

365
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,360
I hate singing,

366
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:17,860
and I hate this house too!

367
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:20,780
They're all suffocating me to death!

368
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,860
In that case,

369
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,900
what do you want to do,

370
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,530
my daughter?

371
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,400
Let us go abroad and study.

372
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,070
"Go abroad"?

373
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,200
Did you say you want to go abroad?

374
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,320
We haven't done this for a while.

375
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,570
Let's spend some time together.

376
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:49,570
Dad, I'm sorry.

377
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,360
I should have looked after her.

378
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:53,280
I'll scold her so she won't do this again.

379
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,320
So please--

380
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,950
No, you're being too noisy.

381
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,070
You already know

382
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,700
I hate hearing boys whine.

383
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,860
I'll change her mind.

384
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:02,950
So please--

385
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:07,530
I warned you.

386
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,780
I hate it when it's noisy.

387
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,610
Did you forget that you must live

388
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,740
abiding by my rules?

389
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:13,950
I'm sure you know

390
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:15,530
what will happen when you break the rules.

391
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,530
You promised you won't beat her again!

392
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,740
Just beat me instead!

393
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,900
If that's your wish,

394
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:24,450
I'll do that.

395
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:26,950
If your twin sister made a mistake,

396
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,400
it could look beautiful

397
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,860
for the brother to get punished.

398
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,530
No. No, Dad.

399
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,650
Dad.

400
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:39,110
Dad, I'm sorry.

401
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,110
Dad.

402
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,030
Seok Hoon, tell him you're sorry. Now!

403
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,200
Come here.

404
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:46,400
Seok Hoon.

405
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:47,860
Seok Hoon.

406
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,240
Dad, I'm sorry.

407
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,280
Dad.

408
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,320
Seok Hoon.

409
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:01,229
Seok Hoon, are you alright?

410
00:21:02,255 --> 00:21:03,493
Answer me!

411
00:21:06,101 --> 00:21:08,987
Dad, I'm sorry.

412
00:21:09,323 --> 00:21:10,892
Please stop.

413
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:14,098
I said stop!

414
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,510
You will be redirected to voicemail.

415
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,720
Why won't anyone pick up the phone?

416
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,640
I'm not sure.

417
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,550
Ms Sim.

418
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,640
What's wrong, Seok Hoon?

419
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:55,890
Are you ill?

420
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,970
Where have you been?

421
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,220
You always leave at the perfect timing

422
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,720
as if you know everything.

423
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:04,350
What do you mean?

424
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:06,970
Is something going on?

425
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:08,100
You can tell me.

426
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,100
Do you even care about us?

427
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:14,390
Move.

428
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,760
Did something happen to them?

429
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:22,890
I'm not sure.

430
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:30,930
Honey.

431
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,970
Did something happen to the kids?

432
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,800
They got into a fight, so I scolded them.

433
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,050
They got into a fight?

434
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,300
Seok Hoon and Seok Kyung never fight.

435
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:41,600
That's why I scolded them.

436
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,470
I guess they've hit puberty.

437
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:46,890
They aren't

438
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,890
giving you a hard time, are they?

439
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:51,640
No, they aren't.

440
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:40,680
Did it hurt a lot?

441
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,260
I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

442
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,220
You know, right?

443
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:50,550
I have no one but you.

444
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:53,050
You are the only one who's on my side.

445
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,800
I'll make sure I keep you safe,

446
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,220
so that no one will mess with you.

447
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:16,800
I'm sorry.

448
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:23,220
The tumour is getting bigger and bigger,

449
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,510
so she'll be in danger soon.

450
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,300
Breast tumour advances quickly.

451
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,260
I have the money.

452
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,510
Please operate on her right away.

453
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:34,100
You said it's 2 million won, right?

454
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:36,100
Where did you get the money?

455
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,640
I thought you didn't have any parents.

456
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,140
You're a middle school student, right?

457
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,720
I think you got a little confused.

458
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,550
The surgery itself is two million won.

459
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,760
It'll be six million won

460
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:49,850
including the hospital bills

461
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:50,970
and rehabilitation fees.

462
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,850
I guess you're in a tough spot,

463
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:53,890
so I'll do it for five million.

464
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,220
But you have to bring me cash.

465
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,930
That much?

466
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,260
Yes.

467
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,010
It's a very difficult surgery.

468
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,100
She might die

469
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,390
if I don't operate before it's too late.

470
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,680
No.

471
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,350
Please save her.

472
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,800
I'll bring the money to you.

473
00:25:20,015 --> 00:25:22,111
Why won't you eat, Sugar?

474
00:25:24,597 --> 00:25:27,049
Alright, I will eat too.

475
00:25:31,875 --> 00:25:33,025
Now, eat it all.

476
00:25:34,328 --> 00:25:36,391
Here you go.

477
00:25:39,979 --> 00:25:42,685
You're such a good girl.

478
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:47,970
I went to Hera Palace today,

479
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:50,130
the most expensive apartment in Korea.

480
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,930
Their lobby is huge,

481
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:54,470
and there was a huge fountain too.

482
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,220
I had to give them my ID to get in.

483
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,630
Isn't that fascinating?

484
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,380
These kids who live there are my age...

485
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,260
but they listen to everything I say.

486
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,180
I'm their tutor.

487
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:15,590
So you don't have to worry about me.

488
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,260
You can focus on

489
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,550
getting your surgery and getting better.

490
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,260
"Gold Prize: Min Seol A"

491
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,840
All finished.

492
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,020
Your Italian tutor will be here.

493
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,060
Get ready.

494
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,150
Right now?

495
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:37,810
It's well over 11 p.m.

496
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,020
Okay. I'll get ready.

497
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,110
Aren't you a bit too harsh on her?

498
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,900
Her practical test will be held soon.

499
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:54,190
You pester her

500
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,810
to do better than Seok Kyung.

501
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:56,810
That's because

502
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:59,940
Joo Dan Tae is one heck of a jerk.

503
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,110
I hate how he's always showing off,

504
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,810
but pretending like he isn't.

505
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:06,020
He might be rich. So what?

506
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,560
How dare he order me around all the time?

507
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:09,560
I'm a chief surgeon

508
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:10,610
at Cheonga Medical Centre.

509
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,360
I heard you got more VIP clients

510
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,520
thanks to Chairman Joo.

511
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:17,110
That's why I let him off.

512
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,860
He's still pretty useful.

513
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,980
Is this the Bordeaux wine he loves?

514
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:25,020
It's awful.

515
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,860
Why does he only drink this?

516
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,690
Then don't drink it.

517
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:31,940
Why do you copy him as you badmouth him?

518
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:33,690
You live in the same building,

519
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:35,110
you drink the wine he drinks,

520
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,900
and you put on T-shirts he wears.

521
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,270
Why do you talk behind his back?

522
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,360
That's called...

523
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,560
an inferiority complex.

524
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,940
If you ever say that again,

525
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:50,860
I'm going to divorce you, understand?

526
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,230
Wait.

527
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:58,980
Is Eun Byeol good enough

528
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,400
to do better than Seok Kyung?

529
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,610
She has many more competitors

530
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:02,980
other than Seok Kyung.

531
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,770
Who else other than the twins?

532
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,770
"Propolis"

533
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:32,110

Don't give up!

Let's get accepted to Cheonga Arts High.

536
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,190
You can do it, Bae Ro Na!

537
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:39,960
I'm sorry, Ro Na.

538
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,210
I tried to stop you

539
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:46,540
but I don't have a right to do that.

540
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:48,580
I'm so sorry.

541
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,580
I'll do

542
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,830
everything I can to fix this situation.

543
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:08,830
I said you're worse than Dad, who's gone.

544
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:13,830
I'm sorry, Mum.

545
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,500
Come here.

546
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,420
Do I look pretty?

547
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,460
You do. - Really?

548
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,790
Did you film this?

549
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:52,750
Have you gone insane?

550
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:58,210
There are many eyes here.

551
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,500
Are you sure it's okay?

552
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,960
How dare you blackmail me?

553
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,120
Do you think you can

554
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:07,710
continue to work in this industry?

555
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:10,330
I don't care about anything right now.

556
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,330
Let me make this simple for you.

557
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,040
If you want to get elected the third time,

558
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,920
you can shut me up with money.

559

You little...

560
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,170
Do you know whom you're messing with?

561
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:24,000
I can make a call

562
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:25,960
and make you disappear

563
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,170
without a trace if I wanted to.

564
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:29,170
Get it?

565
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:33,250
Should I send this video to TV stations

566
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:34,750
and newspapers?

567
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
You had an affair,

568
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,540
refused to pay my commission,

569
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:39,960
and sexually harassed me.

570
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,250
You're living a good life for human trash.

571
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:44,040
You should consider yourself lucky

572
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,170
that I'm willing to shut up with money.

00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:25,420
with a box of energy drinks?

580

how this world works, do you?

00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,960
You should

584
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:33,750
open it up before we talk.

585
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:40,620
You've received a few of these,

586
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,870
so you know how much it is, right?

587
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,920
Goodness, don't say that.

588
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,460
When would I have received

589
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,120
something like this?

590
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:51,040
Everything you got from Je Ni's parents,

591
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:53,120
and I'm sure you've taken a lot more

592
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:54,120
other than that.

593
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:55,120
But, you know,

594
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,920
I'm going to turn a blind eye to it.

595

Once you let Ro Na graduate,

596
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:03,080
I haven't seen a thing even if I have.

597
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,040
I haven't heard a thing even if I have.

598
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,960
Please show her mercy, Mr Kim.

599

Thank you very much for all your help

612
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:47,790
for our school, Mr Joo.

613
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,290
I asked you to leave out

my kids among the scholarship students.

615
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:53,960
Of course they should be included.

616
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,960
They're both top of their class.

617
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,500
They deserve it.

of the remodelling for the gym.

Even the gym?

625
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:14,170
That'll cost quite a lot.

626
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:15,500
Don't worry about the cost.

627
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,790
It's where my kids run around and play.

What is it?

they could ask for.

677
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:42,620
If we report him and get him audited,

678
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:43,960
he won't last long.

679
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,330
His loan is worth

680
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,330
half the value of the building,

681
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:48,670

00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:52,000
I'd say one month at the most.

684
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,620
You should treat your father very well.

685
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:55,830
You don't even have to lift a finger.

686
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,080
Lucky you.

687
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:58,540
Don't you think

688
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,040
it takes skill to graciously accept

689
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,870
what's given to me?

690
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:04,460
Darn it.

691
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:08,330
So this time,

692
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,170
how much can we expect?

693
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,210
The profit.

694
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:12,330
I'd say

695
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,920
at least 15 big bills.

696
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,620
As for the additional deposit...

697
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,750
I got it in gold bars.

698
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,750
Nothing is as honest

699
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:24,750
as gold.

700
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:26,170
My gosh.

701
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:29,710
"1 Kilo Gold 999.9"

702
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,370
Let's wrap this up quickly

703
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,170
and move on to the next deal.

704
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:41,670
The next project

705
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,250
will be a big one.

706
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,330
My goodness. - Cheers.

707
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:11,080
What did you do that the headmaster

708
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,410
is acting like that now?

709
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:14,580
Do you think it can wash away

710
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,040
what your kid did to my daughter?

711
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:17,250
Not a chance.

712
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:19,410
I'll chase you to the end of the Earth.

713
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,120
Sure, you do that.

714
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:25,620
Let's take Je Ni to the hospital.

715
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:29,080
What? - She should get some tests done

716
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,540
to see if her voice is really damaged.

717
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,580
If she actually coughed up blood,

718
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,660
we need to find out what caused it

719
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:36,410
so that we can figure out if I should

720
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,200
compensate you, apologise to you,

721
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,000
or demand an apology from you.

722
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:42,250
Right?

723
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:44,830
Goodness, what has got into you?

724
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,700
You mean Je Ni did something

725
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:49,120
that she should apologise for?

726
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,290
I'm sure you know the answer to that

727
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:53,040
since you're her mother.

728
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,660
You know,

729
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,790
I do not want to meddle in the way

730
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:58,080
you decided to educate your daughter.

731
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,160
But you see,

732
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:02,500
that's not how you should teach kids.

733
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:05,450
Nothing good comes from

734
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:08,000
making someone else's child cry.

735
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:09,950
Who will have more to lose

736
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:11,450
if this becomes an issue?

737
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,120
Think about it carefully

738
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:15,120
and weigh your options.

739
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,250
Hey. Hey, stop right there!

740
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:24,250
Wait! Hey!

741
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:26,500
I'm not done talking!

742
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:28,330
We're not done!

743
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:31,290
Hey!

744
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:54,640
Ma'am.

745
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:57,470
Do you remember me?

746
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,470
Yes, you teach Je Ni.

747
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,930
I got fired.

748
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,550
She's learning from Cheon Seo Jin now.

749
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:07,430
I taught her while she was waiting

750
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:08,970
for an opening.

751
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:10,340
I see.

752
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,640
She has such a great voice.

753
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:16,930
I can see why Je Ni is jealous of her.

754
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,340
Is she practising for the admission exam?

755
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,930
Has she started taking some lessons?

756
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:23,590
No.

757
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,390
She practises on her own.

758
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:26,970
Why?

759
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:28,970
No one wants to teach her.

760
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:32,390
I guess word got out

761
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:33,470
about the incident with Je Ni

762
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:35,340
and the Anti-bullying Committee meeting.

763
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:38,720
But Ro Na didn't do anything bad.

764
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,090
I assure you.

765
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,300
Of course I know.

766
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:42,640
She was wrongfully accused.

767
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:44,840
I'm so sorry I couldn't speak out.

768
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:46,140
I couldn't get involved.

769
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:47,510
I had no choice.

770
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,260
It's okay.

771
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,470
Had you stepped in,

772
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,470
you would've gotten into trouble.

773
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,050
Ro Na is very talented.

774
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,510
Just a little bit of coaching

775
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,140
is all she needs to get into the school.

776
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,680
Would you

777
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,760
let me teach her?

778
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,800
Sorry?

779
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,890
Are you serious?

780
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:10,640
She has much more potential

781
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,590
than Je Ni does.

782
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:13,010
She's got a beautiful voice,

783
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:14,300
and her notes are very precise.

784
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,890
I'd love to teach her.

785
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,510
But if you want a famous instructor

786
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:19,010
like Cheon Seo Jin,

787
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,890
I can't help with that.

788
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:22,260
No, sir.

789
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,010
I really appreciate it.

790
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:25,590
Thank you.

791
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,340
Thank you so much.

792
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:58,050
Very good.

793
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:00,840
Ro Na, you're so good.

794
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:03,800
This will do for the Italian song.

795
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:05,090
What's your German song?

796
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,180
What German song?

797
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,590
I thought I had to pick two Italian songs.

798
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,300
Didn't you see the notice?

799
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:12,640
The exam format has been changed.

800
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:14,890
They added a German song category.

801
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:17,180
Oh, no. I don't speak any German.

802
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:18,640
Oh, my gosh.

803
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,800
Je Ni heard about it a long ago,

804
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:22,640
so she's been practising a lot.

805
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,970
This won't do. Starting today,

806
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:27,340
we'll focus on German songs.

807
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:29,930
Let's interpret a few to get started.

808
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:32,260
But isn't it already too late?

809
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:33,390
You're smart,

810
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:34,890
so you'll catch up in no time.

811
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:35,890
However,

812
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,590
you must practise hard

813
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,220
and follow my instructions to a tee.

814
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:42,390
I'll do my very best.

815
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,840
Let's start with Schubert's "Die Forelle".

816
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:49,204
Ms Jennifer?

817
00:43:01,481 --> 00:43:03,600
Let's try this line first.

818
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,680
That is not how it should be.

819
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,470
You keep going flat.

820
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,140
I told you to use your mask

821
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:31,220
and project your voice forward.

822
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:32,470
Don't clump the notes.

823
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:33,800
Sing each note separately!

824
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:36,430
Why are you repeating the same mistake?

825
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,640
I'll try again.

826
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:38,800
I can do better.

827
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:40,430
I won't mess up this time.

828
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:48,220
Hera. The 35th floor. Garden.

829
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,430
"Nakwon Musical Instruments"

830
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,970
Kyu Jin is home!

831
00:43:58,050 --> 00:43:58,970
Hey. - Look!

832
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,680
My gosh!

833
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:02,640
Min Hyuk's tutor is here.

834
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,800
You can't strip here.

835
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:04,970
Gosh! - Really?

836
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:06,640
Put it on. Goodness.

837
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:08,640
My gosh.

838
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:10,470
Didn't you say you'd be home late

839
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:11,510
because of the trial?

840
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,050
Dad went home early,

841
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:14,340
so I skimmed through the files

842
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:15,640
and escaped the office.

843
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,010
I can't prepare for the trial

844
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:18,550
without my dad anyway.

845
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,720
You need to show him

846
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,390
that you can do things on your own.

847
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:22,800
Only then can he trust you

848
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:24,590
with the law firm.

849
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,930
Do you want to stay

850
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:27,430
a mere employee forever?

851
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:29,340
The firm will be mine anyway.

852
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:31,760
My sisters have no interest in it.

853
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,140
What are you talking about?

854
00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:35,010
Your sister, Cho Won,

855
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:36,680
keeps pestering me to set her up

856
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,340
with Attorney Park at the firm.

857
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:39,640
What?

858
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,140
She just got a divorce.

859
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,340
Isn't it obvious?

860
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:43,840
She's trying to take her share

861
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:45,640
of Father's law firm.

862
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:50,220
You really... You're clueless.

863
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:52,300
Honey.

864
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,390
Are you bad-mouthing my sister?

865
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:57,260
She's my sister, okay?

866
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:00,140
No.

867
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:02,590
I just meant to say that you're too naive.

868
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,930
I'm upset.

869
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,010
You trust your sisters too much.

870
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:07,640
Make me feel better!

871
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,720
If you don't, I'm going to tell Mum!

872
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:12,640
Hurry.

873
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,430
Gosh, my baby. Are you upset?

874
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:16,590
Goodness.

875
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:23,930
Come on.

876
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:28,970
Well...

877
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:30,220
My gosh.

878
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:31,550
Gosh, Ms Lee.

879
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:32,640
I'll be off then.

880
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:34,760
I'm Min Hyuk's father.

881
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:37,300
Hello.

882
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:39,590
Get back here. - Gosh!

883
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:41,390
Hey. - You kill me!

884
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:43,640
Gosh. - What?

885
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:45,430
What is it? - Ms Lee, this is Seok Kyung.

886
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:47,010
Let's delay our session by 30 minutes,

887
00:45:47,090 --> 00:45:48,260
okay?

888
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,470
She could've texted me sooner.

889
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:57,970
My gosh.

890
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:01,930
I had no idea this place existed

891
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:03,470
in Hera Palace.

892
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:05,220
What a pleasant surprise.

893
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:07,760
I participated in designing the building.

894
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:09,890
You can come here whenever you want.

895
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:11,800
You teach my kids,

896
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,550
so you're more than qualified.

897
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:15,180
So is this a bribe?

898
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:18,720
I don't think I need to bribe you

899
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,680
because my kids aren't that bad.

900
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:23,390
All right.

901
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,390
So who will be the top student?

902
00:47:27,590 --> 00:47:29,050
Seok Kyung

903
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:30,680
or Eun Byeol?

904
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,300
These things are usually

905
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,010
decided in advance, right?

906
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,640
It'll be decided after they take the exam.

907
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:38,260
It's going to be fair.

908
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:39,720
"Fair"?

909
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:42,930
I wasn't expecting this.

910
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:56,510
Well...

911
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:21,000
What are you doing?

912
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:27,580
I thought

913
00:48:28,910 --> 00:48:30,000
this would look good on you.

914
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:33,370
Your stupid husband got you the other one.

915
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:35,500
Aren't you tired of it?

916
00:48:43,450 --> 00:48:44,700
This necklace...

917
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:47,580
What does this mean?

918
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:52,200
Don't tell me you want me all to yourself.

919
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:56,540
No, of course not.

920
00:48:57,330 --> 00:48:59,330
I want this to be simple.

921
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,750
No strings attached.

922
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:03,290
And we won't be clingy.

923
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,910
When one of us wants to end it,

924
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:08,120
that will be it.

925
00:49:10,370 --> 00:49:11,370
What do you say?

926
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:17,830
Looks like we just set the rules.

927
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:12,500
Can we finish early today?

928
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:15,450
Did you forget that we started late?

929
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:16,950
If we finish early,

930
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,410
you can squeeze in another session.

931
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,000
You like money, don't you?

932
00:50:25,410 --> 00:50:26,370
You got that right.

933
00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:27,500
I like money indeed.

934
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:28,950
I need to make money.

935
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:30,790
That's why I have to stay and teach you.

936
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,040
If I don't stick to the contract,

937
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,120
I have to pay a penalty.

938
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:35,750
Does that answer your question?

939
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:38,830
"Cheonga Arts High 2020 Admission Form"

940
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:40,700
Hurry up and solve this.

941
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:44,580
I don't want to. What's your problem?

942
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:49,750
Or maybe you can't solve it?

943
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:54,330
I don't understand how

944
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:56,000
you're the top student at your school.

945
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,500
In my honest opinion,

946
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:00,160
you're not that smart.

947
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,290
Get out of my room at once.

948
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:09,370
Now.

949
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:12,250
I think we should finish early today.

950
00:51:12,790 --> 00:51:14,500
We need to fill out our applications.

951
00:51:15,870 --> 00:51:17,410
We already got permission from our mum.

952
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:20,910
Fine.

953
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:23,200
Just today though.

954
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:00,690
What are you doing?

955
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:02,280
People like her

956
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:03,530
need to be taught a lesson.

957
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:07,650
This way, she'll learn to behave herself.

958
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,400
Ms Lee.

959
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:12,230
Thank you for everything.

960
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:14,610
This is just a small gift.

961
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:16,190
My key ring is gone.

962
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:17,690
The limited-edition key ring

963
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:19,030
Dad got me for my birthday.

964
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,360
Ms Lee, did you take it?

965
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,940
I saw it on my desk a minute ago.

966
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:25,030
No, I didn't.

967
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:26,570
Look for it again.

968
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:27,530
Why don't you

969
00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:29,030
just let me search your bag to prove it?

970
00:52:29,110 --> 00:52:30,150
You're okay with that, right?

971
00:52:32,610 --> 00:52:34,400
"Conquer Your Grades, Mathematics"

972
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:37,030
"Conquer Your Grades, Mathematics"

973
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,440
What is this?

974
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:41,030
You are a thief!

975
00:52:41,110 --> 00:52:43,400
You stole my key ring and even snacks.

976
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:44,610
That's enough, Seok Kyung.

977
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:46,320
I'm sorry, Ms Lee.

978
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:48,280
What do you mean it's enough?

979
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:49,440
She stole my stuff.

980
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:50,530
How can I be calm about it?

981
00:52:50,610 --> 00:52:52,150
How could you say that when you saw it

982
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:53,320
with your own two eyes?

983
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:55,230
Don't take it to heart.

984
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,110
I'll scold Seok Kyung.

985
00:52:57,230 --> 00:52:59,280
Mum, whose side are you on?

986
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:01,190
You're siding with this thief?

987
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,650
Even though you're my mum?

988
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:03,940
Seok Kyung!

989
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:06,360
How dare you talk to your mother that way.

990
00:53:07,110 --> 00:53:08,230
My tutor stole my stuff,

991
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:09,860
and Mum is taking her side.

992
00:53:10,610 --> 00:53:11,780
I didn't do it.

993
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,610
I really didn't steal anything.

994
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,860
Why would I steal something?

995
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:20,530
I can list many reasons.

996
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:24,730
I think you should leave.

997
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:26,320
This is a family matter.

998
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:27,610
I'll explain everything, honey.

999
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:29,190
Let me hear what Seok Kyung has to say.

1000
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:30,730
She seems very angry.

1001
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:44,920
Ms Anna Lee?

1002
00:53:45,830 --> 00:53:47,210
Yes? - We received a report.

1003
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:48,630
Please wait here.

1004
00:53:49,210 --> 00:53:50,580
What do you mean?

1005
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:51,580
We were told that

1006
00:53:51,630 --> 00:53:52,790
you were involved in a theft case

1007
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,080
that occurred in the penthouse.

1008
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:56,670
Check again.

1009
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:59,290
It wasn't me. I didn't steal anything.

1010
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:00,790
We should...

1011
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:04,380
let the police investigate that.

1012
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:07,170
When you see something valuable,

1013
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:08,830
it's only natural to want to own it.

1014
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:10,630
I get it.

1015
00:54:11,170 --> 00:54:12,290
We've retrieved the stolen item,

1016
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,000
so if you apologise,

1017
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,040
we'll let it go.

1018
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:17,880
I do not want to apologise

1019
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,500
for something that I didn't do.

1020
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:21,080
Then...

1021
00:54:21,710 --> 00:54:22,830
you're in trouble.

1022
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:24,830
Isn't it strange?

1023
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:26,790
It's not like my daughter's key ring

1024
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,750
could've walked into your bag on its own.

1025
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:30,790
Maybe Seok Kyung put it in my bag.

1026
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:31,880
What are you saying?

1027
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:33,420
Why would I do that?

1028
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:34,830
That is out of line.

1029
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:37,460
Do you think my family is a joke?

1030
00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:44,500
Apologise at once.

1031
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:47,500
For suspecting my daughter

1032
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:48,880
and for stealing

1033
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,210
her belonging.

1034
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:51,630
Apologise now.

1035
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:55,580
Call the Chief of Gangnam Police Station.

1036
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:57,000
Yes, sir.

1037
00:54:57,580 --> 00:54:59,170
If you move, you will also be charged

1038
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:01,460
with attempting to escape.

1039
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:09,540
I didn't steal it.

1040
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:11,540
Come on. - It was a setup.

1041
00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:13,540
I'm not a thief. - Shut up! Come on.

1042
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:15,250
Hey!

1043
00:55:15,330 --> 00:55:16,880
Will you please say something?

1044
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:32,460
Wait.

1045
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:39,830
I will apologise.

1046
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,130
I'll do it.

1047
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,380
Meet me at the pool.

1048
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:56,710
My gosh. - Nice!

1049
00:55:56,830 --> 00:55:58,880
The maths tutor tried to steal something?

1050
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,250
Is she insane?

1051
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,040
I know, right?

1052
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:04,210
Oh, there they are.

1053
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:05,460
This is already so entertaining.

1054
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:07,630
Do it.

1055
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:08,790
Go ahead and apologise.

1056
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:11,250
I'm sorry.

1057
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:15,170
For suspecting you.

1058
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:16,750
And?

1059
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:19,710
What about for stealing my key ring?

1060
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,170
I'm sorry.

1061
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,670
It won't happen ever again.

1062
00:56:28,830 --> 00:56:29,790
All right.

1063
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:31,420
Apology accepted

1064
00:56:31,830 --> 00:56:33,670
although I'm not totally satisfied.

1065
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:37,170
Where do you think you're going?

1066
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:43,960
But you know, Ms Lee...

1067
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:51,080
Do you know that you really stink?

1068
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,880
You make me want to puke.

1069
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:06,250
My gosh, did you really just do that?

1070
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:07,880
You're crazy.

1071
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:17,540
I can't believe we adopted a thief!

1072
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:19,580
You'll be deported from the US.

1073
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:24,236
Here you go. - There.

1074
00:57:24,261 --> 00:57:25,767
My gosh!

1075
00:57:27,677 --> 00:57:29,597
Where are you going?

1076
00:57:30,618 --> 00:57:32,658
My gosh! - Ms Lee

1077
00:57:33,532 --> 00:57:36,592
You should've told me if you were hungry.

1078
00:57:36,625 --> 00:57:37,719
I'm so disappointed that

1079
00:57:37,744 --> 00:57:40,100
you even tried to steal our snacks.

1080
00:57:41,219 --> 00:57:43,419
I guess she likes our imported snacks.

1081
00:57:43,444 --> 00:57:44,753
Are you serious?

1082
00:57:44,778 --> 00:57:46,697
I can't believe she did that.

1083
00:57:46,722 --> 00:57:48,290
This is going to stink. - Ms Lee!

1084
00:57:48,315 --> 00:57:50,949
Ms Lee! Ms Lee!

1085
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:54,190
Here's some money for dry cleaning.

1086
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:55,980
It's okay. Take it.

1087
00:57:57,270 --> 00:57:58,230
Let's go.

1088
00:57:58,770 --> 00:58:00,140
Let's go. - Bye, Ms Lee.

1089
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,290
The tutor is fired as of today.

1090
00:58:44,710 --> 00:58:45,880
Whether she stole or not,

1091
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:47,210
I didn't like her from the start.

1092
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:06,830
Why did you do it, Seok Kyung?

1093
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:10,500
Do what? - You put that in her bag.

1094
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:13,710
What are you talking about?

1095
00:59:15,790 --> 00:59:16,710
Joo Seok Kyung.

1096
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:19,540
I asked you why you did it.

1097
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:21,830
Is this all you can do?

1098
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:23,330
Were you this bad a person?

1099
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:24,580
Enough to hurt others?

1100
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:26,960
So what?

1101
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:28,670
What should I do?

1102
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:30,420
Apologise to Ms Anna Lee properly.

1103
00:59:31,330 --> 00:59:32,710
I'll drag you to her if I must.

1104
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:35,080
No!

1105
00:59:35,290 --> 00:59:37,460
What are you? What right do you have?

1106
00:59:37,710 --> 00:59:39,290
How dare you say that to your mum.

1107
00:59:40,790 --> 00:59:41,670
"Mum"?

1108
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:44,580
You're not my birth mum.

1109
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:47,830
What do you mean?

1110
00:59:48,330 --> 00:59:49,500
Did you think I didn't know?

1111
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,080
That you're not my birth mum?

1112
00:59:52,830 --> 00:59:55,170
That someone else had Seok Hoon and me?

1113
00:59:55,750 --> 00:59:56,710
Seok Kyung.

1114
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:59,540
I don't know what you heard

1115
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:01,130
and from whom, but I'm your mum.

1116
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:03,630
I didn't labour to have you,

1117
01:00:03,710 --> 01:00:04,830
but I raised you from infancy

1118
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:07,000
and I loved you like any other mum.

1119
01:00:08,130 --> 01:00:10,000
I loved you sincerely every single day.

1120
01:00:11,290 --> 01:00:12,170
Sincerely?

1121
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:15,080
My elementary school graduation.

1122
01:00:16,290 --> 01:00:17,380
My school recital.

1123
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:18,880
My birthday last year!

1124
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,130
Each time I needed you,

1125
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:21,630
you were never by my side!

1126
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:24,460
It was all because of her, wasn't it?

1127
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:29,210
Your real daughter lying in a hospital.

1128
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:33,960
How do you know that?

1129
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:35,330
Do you know

1130
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:38,080
how much I liked you?

1131
01:00:41,830 --> 01:00:42,750
But you...

1132
01:00:43,170 --> 01:00:44,210
You deceived me.

1133
01:00:46,170 --> 01:00:47,960
Because of your real daughter,

1134
01:00:49,330 --> 01:00:51,130
you abandoned me every day!

1135
01:00:51,290 --> 01:00:53,000
No, that's not true, Seok Kyung.

1136
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:55,500
I never abandoned you.

1137
01:00:55,580 --> 01:00:57,170
I love you so much.

1138
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:01,040
Never once

1139
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:03,670
did I think you weren't really mine.

1140
01:01:06,290 --> 01:01:07,880
I mean it, Seok Kyung.

1141
01:01:12,830 --> 01:01:14,540
Don't act like my mum ever again.

1142
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:16,750
It's gross and nauseating.

1143
01:01:25,630 --> 01:01:26,500
Wait.

1144
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:27,830
Seok Hoon.

1145
01:01:28,130 --> 01:01:29,290
I just meant to...

1146
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:31,790
Stay out of our business.

1147
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:33,380
From now on.

1148
01:01:58,670 --> 01:02:00,790
That's why the kids were so on edge.

1149
01:02:02,670 --> 01:02:04,040
I had no idea.

1150
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,580
They had to know one day.

1151
01:02:11,170 --> 01:02:12,330
Don't blame yourself too much.

1152
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:14,580
They'll come to understand.

1153
01:02:15,210 --> 01:02:16,250
I'll talk to them.

1154
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:22,500
I'm so sorry to you too.

1155
01:02:24,330 --> 01:02:25,500
For 16 years,

1156
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:27,630
you tried so hard

1157
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:28,960
to care for a sick girl.

1158
01:02:32,330 --> 01:02:33,710
And there's no progress.

1159
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,710
Don't say that around Hye In.

1160
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:41,330
She can't speak,

1161
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:42,380
but she's a sensitive kid.

1162
01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:44,130
She'll hear and feel everything.

1163
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:47,830
I wonder if I'm not trying hard enough

1164
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,080
and that's why she's still sick.

1165
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:51,040
Why would you say that?

1166
01:02:52,130 --> 01:02:53,040
Not even a real dad

1167
01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:54,380
could be that affectionate.

1168
01:03:03,130 --> 01:03:04,920
Whatever others say, Hye In is mine.

1169
01:03:05,630 --> 01:03:07,420
Your child is mine too.

1170
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:09,920
Seok Hoon, Seok Kyung, Hye In.

1171
01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:12,750
They're all our kids.

1172
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:15,130
So let's get through it.

1173
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:19,630
How did

1174
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:22,080
the kids find out?

1175
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:26,290
I don't know.

1176
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:29,040
That's what I find so strange.

1177
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:41,380
Everything you said was true.

1178
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:47,880
It's gross.

1179
01:03:48,830 --> 01:03:50,250
I'm totally unrelated to her,

1180
01:03:50,330 --> 01:03:51,920
and I believed she was my mum.

1181
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,040
Throw away this photo.

1182
01:04:25,130 --> 01:04:27,500
I think it's time to end the play.

1183
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:31,290
You did well playing the daughter,

1184
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:32,960
Joo Hye In.

1185
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:40,130
Has it been 16 years already?

1186
01:04:40,790 --> 01:04:41,750
Yes, sir.

1187
01:04:42,830 --> 01:04:43,830
She hung in there,

1188
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:45,040
replacing the dead kid.

1189
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:46,790
It was perfect.

1190
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:13,965
"Eun Byeol: Thank you,
my math grades improved so much."

01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:52,160
he should ace one

It's been a while, Ms Lee.

1368
01:17:26,250 --> 01:17:27,250
Hello.

1369
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:34,000
The results are out.

1370
01:17:36,660 --> 01:17:38,330
You're in, of course, aren't you?

1371
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:39,540
Yes.

Mum.

1377

The results are out.

1378
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:53,830
But I'm too scared to look.

1379
01:17:53,910 --> 01:17:55,660
Why did you come out in the rain?

1380
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:57,330
Let's go. I'll check for you.

01:18:00,580 --> 01:18:02,200
Seok Hoon came first. Congratulations.

1384
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:04,290
But someone else came first

1385
01:18:04,370 --> 01:18:05,540
in the vocal music department.

1386
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:08,830
Seok Kyung, you're not first place.

1387
01:18:09,410 --> 01:18:10,290
Who is it then?

1388
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:12,080
Was it Eun Byeol who messed up?

1389
01:18:12,790 --> 01:18:13,700
Min Seol A.

1390
01:18:14,620 --> 01:18:15,750
Someone with a GED.

1391
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:20,040

Seok Kyung.

1396
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:44,500
How dare you do this to your tutor.

1397
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:45,790
What tutor?

1398
01:18:45,870 --> 01:18:48,200
I saw her in Cheonga's exam hall.

No way.

Why didn't I make it?

1409
01:19:25,910 --> 01:19:27,370
I didn't make any mistakes, so why?

1419
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:09,840
Are you really Seok Kyung's age?

1420
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:11,250
You're in middle school?

1421
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:12,380
Can't you tell from this?

1422
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:13,960
She's my age.

1423
01:20:14,050 --> 01:20:15,460
And she's not in middle school.

1424
01:20:16,590 --> 01:20:18,880
We don't even know where she's from.

1425
01:20:19,170 --> 01:20:20,460
Does it make sense that

1426
01:20:20,630 --> 01:20:21,630
we called her a tutor

1427
01:20:21,710 --> 01:20:22,800
and took lessons from her?

1428
01:20:25,550 --> 01:20:26,880
You live in a rundown area

1429
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:28,130
and lied and pretended

1430
01:20:28,210 --> 01:20:29,590
to have studied abroad?

1431
01:20:31,050 --> 01:20:32,000
Why did you do that?

1432
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:34,880
Answer me.

1433
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:36,920
I'm sorry that I lied.

1434
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:38,840
But I returned

1435
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:40,420
what you paid me when I was fired,

1436
01:20:40,630 --> 01:20:42,550
and I'm no longer the twins' tutor.

1437
01:20:42,630 --> 01:20:43,670
So you did nothing wrong?

1438
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:45,670
I taught them as much as I was paid,

1439
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:47,170
and I was never late.

1440
01:20:47,550 --> 01:20:49,500
Seok Kyung was the delinquent one.

1441
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:50,800
She framed me

1442
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:52,000
and humiliated me for stealing.

1443
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:54,210
Shut your mouth. - Seok Kyung.

1444
01:20:57,170 --> 01:20:58,090
You got in first place.

1445
01:20:58,800 --> 01:20:59,750
How did you do that?

1446
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:02,000
I got in with my own skill.

1447
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:03,840
Is that a crime too?

1448
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,550
How are we to know

1449
01:21:05,630 --> 01:21:06,840
what a fraud like you pulled?

1450
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,590
Did you come in here on purpose

1451
01:21:08,670 --> 01:21:09,960
to steal information?

1452
01:21:10,050 --> 01:21:10,960
Is there

1453
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:13,460
any information to steal from you?

1454
01:21:15,670 --> 01:21:16,500
Seok Kyung.

1455
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:18,460
That was for mocking

1456
01:21:18,550 --> 01:21:19,960
and ridiculing my family.

1457
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:22,750
What are you doing?

1458
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,500
That's my warning to you

1459
01:21:24,590 --> 01:21:25,630
to live straight.

1460
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,340
What? Do you feel wronged?

1461
01:21:30,050 --> 01:21:32,300
You ran loose like a colt that escaped.

1462
01:21:32,380 --> 01:21:33,750
You must pay for that.

1463
01:21:34,630 --> 01:21:35,920
Give me your parents' number.

1464
01:21:36,380 --> 01:21:37,460
Stop it, please.

1465
01:21:38,210 --> 01:21:39,380
I have no parents.

1466
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:40,750
What?

1467
01:21:41,130 --> 01:21:42,170
You're an orphan?

1468
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:44,550
You are even rootless at that?

1469
01:21:45,050 --> 01:21:47,050
She has nothing to do with us now.

1470
01:21:47,250 --> 01:21:48,500
And she already apologised.

1471
01:21:50,630 --> 01:21:52,670
I didn't like you from the start.

1472
01:21:53,420 --> 01:21:54,710
An untruthful person

1473
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,090
emits a certain energy.

1474
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:59,250
A dirty energy that disgusts others.

1475
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:06,800
It doesn't look like

1476
01:22:07,670 --> 01:22:09,710
you live a truthful life yourself.

1477
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:12,420
What did you just say?

1478
01:22:18,630 --> 01:22:19,710
If you have nothing more to say,

1479
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:20,880
I should get going.

1480
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:23,750
Hey.

1481
01:22:24,050 --> 01:22:25,000
Where are you going?

1482
01:22:25,710 --> 01:22:26,550
Hey!

1483
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:29,090
What a lowlife.

1484
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:31,800
I can't believe we let her in our house.

1485
01:22:41,250 --> 01:22:42,630
I won't end it like this.

1486
01:22:49,090 --> 01:22:51,210
No way. You're lying, aren't you?

1487
01:22:51,670 --> 01:22:52,920
What? That's outrageous.

1488
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:55,670
I'm mad. I treated her like a tutor.

1489
01:22:56,170 --> 01:22:57,800
She's a professional actress.

1490
01:22:58,420 --> 01:22:59,340
No wonder.

1491
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:01,670
I hated her from the start.

1492
01:23:02,050 --> 01:23:03,090
Will you let it go?

1493
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:04,710
What will you do?

1494
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:06,170
I'll make her pay

1495
01:23:06,590 --> 01:23:07,840
for taking us lightly.

"Little Hera Club"

1499
01:23:19,670 --> 01:23:21,210
I'm sorry, ma'am.

1500
01:23:21,710 --> 01:23:24,000
I wanted to apologise to you properly.

1501
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:26,380
Can I ask what your situation is?

1502
01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:29,170
The Anna Lee I know...

1503
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:31,750
I mean, the Min Seol A I know

1504
01:23:32,670 --> 01:23:34,380
doesn't seem like a bad person.

1505
01:23:35,340 --> 01:23:37,380
You might not believe me,

1506
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:40,210
but I needed some urgent cash.

1507
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:42,670
I didn't spend it on something bad.

1508
01:23:43,170 --> 01:23:44,090
Okay.

1509
01:23:45,340 --> 01:23:46,300
I believe you.

1510
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:48,250
But I'd like you

1511
01:23:48,460 --> 01:23:50,670
to apologise to the other parents first.

1512
01:23:51,170 --> 01:23:52,670
If you leave like you're running away,

1513
01:23:53,340 --> 01:23:54,710
you're being irresponsible

1514
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:55,630
for your actions.

1515
01:23:57,170 --> 01:23:58,130
I understand.

1516
01:23:59,750 --> 01:24:01,300
I'll do as you say.

1517
01:24:07,050 --> 01:24:07,920
Right.

1518
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:09,710
I have something for you.

1519
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:10,960
Will you wait here?

1520
01:24:11,670 --> 01:24:12,550
Yes.

1521
01:24:55,460 --> 01:24:56,590
Who are you?

1522
01:24:57,670 --> 01:24:58,880
If you don't want to suffer,

1523
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:00,130
you'd better keep still.

1524
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:01,960
You did wrong,

1525
01:25:02,050 --> 01:25:03,340
so why are you so dignified?

1526
01:25:04,170 --> 01:25:05,880
Are you really the same age as us?

1527
01:25:06,250 --> 01:25:07,500
You got a GED

1528
01:25:07,590 --> 01:25:08,670
and you live in Boseong Village?

1529
01:25:09,250 --> 01:25:10,250
She's an orphan too.

1530
01:25:15,590 --> 01:25:16,500
I'm sorry.

1531
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:18,630
I apologise sincerely.

1532
01:25:18,710 --> 01:25:19,590
You're sorry?

1533
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:21,130
You stabbed us in the back,

1534
01:25:21,210 --> 01:25:23,000
and it's fine if you say sorry?

1535
01:25:23,340 --> 01:25:25,130
I'll return your tutoring fees somehow.

1536
01:25:25,710 --> 01:25:27,300
I'll pay it back. Give me time.

1537
01:25:27,380 --> 01:25:28,750
How shameless.

1538
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:31,550
You give me the chills.

1539
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:33,800
The fact that you tried to tutor us

1540
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:35,590
is a crime in itself.

1541
01:25:35,670 --> 01:25:37,550
You stole Seok Kyung's key ring too?

1542
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:41,250
You're a thief and a fraud.

1543
01:25:41,590 --> 01:25:43,500
How did she come first in Cheonga?

1544
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:45,170
The standards are so low.

1545
01:25:45,460 --> 01:25:46,380
You loser.

1546
01:25:49,170 --> 01:25:50,420
I'll say the facts.

1547
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:51,750
A kid like you

1548
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:53,460
can't go to school with us.

1549
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,170
Your first-place admission

1550
01:25:55,250 --> 01:25:56,550
will be cancelled, of course.

1551
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,420
You con people to make money.

1552
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:00,550
Do you think Cheonga will accept you?

1553
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:03,800
You have the best imagination in Korea.

1554
01:26:05,550 --> 01:26:06,420
Yes.

1555
01:26:06,630 --> 01:26:07,710
I got a GED,

1556
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:08,710
I'm an orphan with nothing,

1557
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:09,670
and I live in Boseong Village.

1558
01:26:10,340 --> 01:26:11,590
I never finished school

1559
01:26:11,670 --> 01:26:13,250
and of course I got no music lessons.

1560
01:26:14,550 --> 01:26:16,050
I worked part-time all day long.

1561
01:26:17,710 --> 01:26:18,630
So what?

1562
01:26:19,670 --> 01:26:21,380
What are you for losing to me?

1563
01:26:23,380 --> 01:26:24,460
Let's be honest.

1564
01:26:25,630 --> 01:26:27,340
Are you angry that an orphan tutored you

1565
01:26:28,300 --> 01:26:29,800
or because you lost to me?

1566
01:26:31,170 --> 01:26:32,710
Who says we lost to you?

1567
01:26:35,420 --> 01:26:37,000
You have everything.

1568
01:26:38,750 --> 01:26:39,750
A nice home,

1569
01:26:40,210 --> 01:26:41,800
parents who support you.

1570
01:26:42,090 --> 01:26:43,300
You have everything you want.

1571
01:26:43,670 --> 01:26:44,710
Why are you

1572
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:46,000
so insistent on crushing me?

1573
01:26:49,460 --> 01:26:50,380
I feel bad for you.

1574
01:26:53,050 --> 01:26:54,130
And sad.

1575
01:27:00,460 --> 01:27:01,300
You feel bad for us?

1576
01:27:02,710 --> 01:27:04,550
What gives you the right to feel that?

1577
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:07,840
What are you?

1578
01:27:11,380 --> 01:27:12,340
Did you bring it?

1579
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:13,840
You bet.

1580
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:18,090
Ta-da.

1581
01:27:18,170 --> 01:27:19,250
Ta-da.

1582
01:27:20,170 --> 01:27:21,130
What are you doing?

1583
01:27:21,210 --> 01:27:22,420
You're a university student.

1584
01:27:23,050 --> 01:27:24,550
You took a break from UCLA.

1585
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,090
Since you're an adult,

1586
01:27:26,170 --> 01:27:27,460
you drink champagne, don't you?

1587
01:27:30,130 --> 01:27:31,460
Please, don't do this.

1588
01:27:32,090 --> 01:27:33,800
Let me go home, will you?

1589
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:34,960
I beg of you.

1590
01:27:35,050 --> 01:27:35,880
Don't be scared.

1591
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:38,670
We're here to celebrate.

1592
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:42,550
Ms Anna Lee, congratulations

1593
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:43,960
on entering Cheonga Arts High

1594
01:27:44,050 --> 01:27:44,920
as first place.

1595
01:27:50,696 --> 01:27:52,474
Ro Na!

1596
01:27:53,629 --> 01:27:55,589
Ro Na, where are you?

1597
01:27:57,099 --> 01:27:58,417
Ro Na!

1598
01:28:01,445 --> 01:28:02,746
My goodness.

1599
01:28:11,420 --> 01:28:13,550
What are you to feel bad for us?

1600
01:28:13,630 --> 01:28:14,710
You should be punished.

1601
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:15,750
You're like this,

1602
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:17,380
and that's why your parents left you.

1603
01:28:17,590 --> 01:28:19,500
Who do you think you are?

1604
01:28:19,590 --> 01:28:20,630
What are you?

1605
01:28:21,340 --> 01:28:23,590
A party's not complete without a cake.

1606
01:28:28,460 --> 01:28:29,670
Do as we say

1607
01:28:30,050 --> 01:28:30,960
and we'll let you go.

1608
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:39,920
Preparations are complete.

1609
01:28:40,380 --> 01:28:42,380
Hey. Save me. Please, save me.

1610
01:28:42,460 --> 01:28:43,710
Look over here.

1611
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:45,300
I'll make you look pretty.

1612
01:28:45,670 --> 01:28:47,710
Nice posture and great face.

1613
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,880
Great. - This is the true face of

1614
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:52,170
Boseong Village's Min Seol A.

1615
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:54,590
This suits you so well!

1616
01:28:54,750 --> 01:28:56,630
How about changing careers?

1617
01:28:56,710 --> 01:28:57,670
Work at a bar.

1618
01:28:58,090 --> 01:28:59,050
It suits you!

1619
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:00,960
You joke! - Stop this!

1620
01:29:01,050 --> 01:29:03,170
How dare you act like our tutor?

1621
01:29:03,250 --> 01:29:05,300
Congratulations

1622
01:29:05,670 --> 01:29:08,000
Congratulations

1623
01:29:08,380 --> 01:29:11,840
Congratulations on getting into school

1624
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:13,210
Let me out!

1625
01:29:15,050 --> 01:29:16,000
Save me!

1626
01:29:21,030 --> 01:29:23,200
Bae Ro Na is first on the waiting list.

1627
01:29:32,450 --> 01:29:33,400
This voice...

1628
01:29:34,740 --> 01:29:35,650
Bae Ro Na?

1629
01:29:53,110 --> 01:29:54,200
"Score Card"

1630
01:29:59,150 --> 01:30:00,240
What about Mr Kwon?

1631
01:30:00,610 --> 01:30:02,280
I passed on the amount you set.

1632
01:30:02,740 --> 01:30:03,570
I also promised

1633
01:30:03,650 --> 01:30:04,610
to finance his recital.

1634
01:30:05,570 --> 01:30:06,650
Well done.

1635
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:08,240
You can go.

1636
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:18,740
Ms Cheon! Ms Cheon.

1637
01:30:18,820 --> 01:30:20,990
Ms Cheon. Have you heard?

1638
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:22,070
What's the matter?

1639
01:30:22,150 --> 01:30:23,200
Min Seol A... No.

1640
01:30:23,610 --> 01:30:24,650
The girl who came first.

1641
01:30:24,990 --> 01:30:27,530
She's the kids' tutor.

1642
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:29,450
What do you mean?

1643
01:30:29,990 --> 01:30:32,110
The maths tutor, Anna Lee.

1644
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:34,110
She got into Cheonga in first place!

1645
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:35,360
She's Min Seol A!

1646
01:30:36,780 --> 01:30:37,650
What?

1647
01:30:37,950 --> 01:30:39,950
What on earth is going on?

1648
01:30:40,490 --> 01:30:41,650
We should be celebrating,

1649
01:30:41,740 --> 01:30:43,280
but my mood is totally ruined.

1650
01:30:44,530 --> 01:30:45,490
Ms Cheon.

1651
01:30:45,990 --> 01:30:47,450
You should've checked before hiring.

1652
01:30:47,530 --> 01:30:49,240
This is so humiliating.

1653
01:30:49,820 --> 01:30:50,780
If word gets out,

1654
01:30:50,860 --> 01:30:52,820
what will people think of us?

1655
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:56,570
We got duped good by a 16-year-old.

1656
01:30:56,650 --> 01:30:57,900
She forged proof of enrolment

1657
01:30:57,990 --> 01:30:59,200
and even an ID card.

1658
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:00,200
What was I to do?

1659
01:31:00,700 --> 01:31:01,610
If you want to blame me,

1660
01:31:01,700 --> 01:31:03,900
find your own tutors from now on.

1661
01:31:05,070 --> 01:31:07,400
Ms Cheon, it's not your fault.

1662
01:31:07,650 --> 01:31:09,400
How could we beat such a sly kid?

1663
01:31:09,490 --> 01:31:10,740
She planned to con us.

1664
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:15,360
Kids these days are so scary. Right?

1665
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:19,700
Soo Ryeon, didn't you study abroad?

1666
01:31:20,450 --> 01:31:22,150
You could've told if you spoke to her.

1667
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:24,610
Did you not notice a thing? Or...

1668
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:27,700
Did you notice and cover it up?

1669
01:31:28,070 --> 01:31:29,030
I didn't know.

1670
01:31:30,740 --> 01:31:32,570
But she seemed to have a reason.

1671
01:31:33,860 --> 01:31:35,820
She promised to apologise.

1672
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:38,150
"Apologise"?

1673
01:31:38,860 --> 01:31:40,200
Did she say that to you?

1674
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:42,240
You don't believe that sly kid, do you?

1675
01:31:43,490 --> 01:31:46,110
Shouldn't we come up with a plan?

1676
01:31:46,740 --> 01:31:47,950
We can't let her sing

1677
01:31:48,030 --> 01:31:49,610
at the entrance ceremony, can we?

1678
01:31:50,490 --> 01:31:51,530
To think that

1679
01:31:51,610 --> 01:31:53,200
the evil brat will study with our kids,

1680
01:31:53,700 --> 01:31:55,200
it gives me the shivers.

1681
01:31:55,610 --> 01:31:56,650
That's right.

1682
01:31:56,900 --> 01:31:59,070
I'm afraid she'll rub off

1683
01:31:59,150 --> 01:32:00,240
on our naive kids.

1684
01:32:05,862 --> 01:32:07,148
Ro Na!

1685
01:32:08,872 --> 01:32:10,444
Ro Na!

1686
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:22,830
Ro Na!

1687
01:32:33,580 --> 01:32:35,450
Why are you here?

1688
01:32:35,500 --> 01:32:37,450
Do you know how hard I looked for you?

1689
01:32:41,750 --> 01:32:43,790
Let's get home quick.

1690
01:32:44,250 --> 01:32:45,870
What if you catch a cold?

1691
01:32:45,950 --> 01:32:47,700
Who cares if I catch a cold?

1692
01:32:47,790 --> 01:32:49,370
I won't have to sing anymore.

1693
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
I don't need my voice anymore!

1694
01:32:55,950 --> 01:32:56,830
Don't do that.

1695
01:32:57,540 --> 01:32:59,660
Please don't do that, Ro Na.

1696
01:33:00,290 --> 01:33:01,950
Why aren't we rich?

1697
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:05,120
Why does Ms Cheon hate you?

1698
01:33:05,700 --> 01:33:07,160
It's all your fault!

1699
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:09,330
If it hadn't been for you,

1700
01:33:09,410 --> 01:33:11,040
Ms Cheon would've taught me.

1701
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:14,000
Then I wouldn't have got conned,

1702
01:33:14,330 --> 01:33:16,620
and I'd have got into Cheonga Arts High!

1703
01:33:16,870 --> 01:33:17,870
Ro Na.

1704
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:19,540
You're first on the waiting list.

1705
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,660
We still have hope.

1706
01:33:21,750 --> 01:33:23,120
It's all over!

1707
01:33:23,330 --> 01:33:25,290
I don't want to see your face.

1708
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:27,870
Please leave me alone!

1709
01:33:32,620 --> 01:33:35,750
Mum's so sorry, Ro Na.

1710
01:33:37,410 --> 01:33:40,080
I'm such a fool. I'm so stupid.

1711
01:33:40,330 --> 01:33:41,500
I'm sorry.

1712
01:33:43,700 --> 01:33:44,750
Mum is...

1713
01:33:45,540 --> 01:33:47,120
so powerless.

1714
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:49,660
I'm sorry I'm your mum, Ro Na.

1715
01:33:50,700 --> 01:33:52,660
I worked almost to my death.

1716
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:55,790
I wish I could just die!

1717
01:33:56,410 --> 01:33:58,370
I really don't want to live!

1718
01:33:59,790 --> 01:34:01,040
Ro Na.

1719
01:34:03,660 --> 01:34:06,000
I'm sorry. Mum's sorry.

1720
01:34:06,290 --> 01:34:07,620
I'm sorry.

1721
01:34:32,910 --> 01:34:35,660
=Penthouse=

1722
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,910
Talent? I don't care for that.

1723
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:38,870
Money is talent

1724
01:34:38,950 --> 01:34:39,870
and background is talent.

1725
01:34:39,950 --> 01:34:41,200
It's fine if I just shut up.

1726
01:34:41,660 --> 01:34:43,080
Why don't you kill one

1727
01:34:43,160 --> 01:34:44,330
to get your daughter in?

1728
01:34:44,790 --> 01:34:45,910
You're a dreadful person.

1729
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:48,450
Mum and daughter are spectacular.

1730
01:34:48,790 --> 01:34:50,500
The 35th floor garden.

1731
01:34:50,580 --> 01:34:51,580
The penthouse guy.

1732
01:34:51,750 --> 01:34:52,620
What a pretty necklace.

1733
01:34:52,700 --> 01:34:53,580
I haven't seen it before.

1734
01:34:53,750 --> 01:34:55,620
I can't deceive my feelings any more.

1735
01:34:55,790 --> 01:34:56,830
She'll pretend she's smart

1736
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,540
and try to use what cards she has,

1737
01:34:59,910 --> 01:35:00,870
not knowing that

1738
01:35:00,950 --> 01:35:02,080
it'll be a blade

1739
01:35:02,500 --> 01:35:03,500
that comes back at her.
