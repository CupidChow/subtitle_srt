that girl on the waiting list.

I'm not sure either.

She didn't tell me anything.

Eun Byeol's name isn't listed.

40

Maybe she got herself in trouble again.

I'm here to pick up the dress.

Please wrap it up.

You must be disappointed.

48
00:02:20,334 --> 00:02:21,768
I heard Seok Kyung caught a cold,

49
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:23,684
so she can't sing the solo part anymore.

50

She caught a terrible cold.

51

She's very disappointed too.

52
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:30,242
Then will Eun Byeol sing the solo part?

53
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,850
What?

54
00:02:32,292 --> 00:02:34,310

for her university graduation recital.

56
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,534
She had it altered for the occasion.

She said Eun Byeol will put this on

With 50 years of tradition, Cheonga High

159
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,394
has been a stepping stone

160
00:07:37,418 --> 00:07:38,534
to get into Seoul University.

161
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:39,893
And Cheonga Art Festival was

162
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,783
in the centre of that process.

163
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:44,034
Cheonga Art Festival has been

164
00:07:44,292 --> 00:07:45,992
a driving force for our school

many reputable artists

167

in music, arts, and dance.

169

But sadly, 25 years ago,

170
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:58,268
an unfortunate incident broke out

171
00:07:58,292 --> 00:08:00,075
due to an overheated competition,

172
00:08:00,917 --> 00:08:02,700
which led to abolition of the festival.

173
00:08:03,292 --> 00:08:04,492
And today,

174
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,200
I decided to bring back

175
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:07,685
Cheonga Art Festival.

176
00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:08,893
"Cheonga Arts High School"

177
00:08:08,917 --> 00:08:10,242
"Admission Ceremony"

178
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:24,435
Every single one who received this trophy

179
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,728
got admitted to Seoul University of Music

180
00:08:25,753 --> 00:08:27,184
as the top of his or her class,

181
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:29,977
and their legacy has been brilliant.

182
00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:32,435
And for the new Cheonga Art Festival,

183
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:33,725
instead of letting

184
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,018
only seniors participate,

185
00:08:35,042 --> 00:08:37,746
all Cheonga students will be able to join.

186
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:43,950
Equal opportunity,

187
00:08:44,084 --> 00:08:45,326
fair judging process,

188
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,117
and endless honour

189
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,367
await all of you.

190

00:08:53,042 --> 00:08:54,754
"Admission Ceremony"

192
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:57,643
Does this mean

193
00:08:57,667 --> 00:08:59,185
she'll have even more influence

194
00:08:59,209 --> 00:09:01,142
as the Head of Arts?

195
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:03,742
Ms Cheon is going to be

196
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:06,408
your life thread from the heavens.

197
00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:08,434
Have I been too rude lately?

198
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:09,559
Who knows what will happen,

199
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:12,451
but I do know you got on her wrong side.

200
00:09:26,292 --> 00:09:27,451
Let's go.

201
00:09:39,411 --> 00:09:40,944
"Bella voce".

202
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,600
Great work.

203
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,934
That was a wonderful ceremony.

204
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,934
You've been preparing this for a while,

205
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,725
so it must feel rewarding.

206
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,449
It's thanks to all the parents' help.

207
00:10:11,792 --> 00:10:13,034
Thank you.

208
00:10:13,834 --> 00:10:15,850
Eun Byeol's solo was perfect today.

209
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,434
It looks like she left a big impression

210
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:19,490
on all the guests you invited today.

211
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,278
Congratulations.

212
00:10:23,126 --> 00:10:25,117
You are a woman

213
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,372
who gets more charming by the day.

214
00:10:30,251 --> 00:10:32,475
Thank you for accepting my suggestion.

215
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,559
Does this mean we have a deal?

216
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,809
I'll tell Seok Kyung to give up

217
00:10:37,834 --> 00:10:39,742
on singing the solo part.

218
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:41,633
Oh, and...

219
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,249
let's put an end to our relationship too.

220
00:10:49,376 --> 00:10:50,985
I had fun while it lasted.

221
00:10:58,583 --> 00:10:59,992
That crazy jerk.

222
00:11:02,042 --> 00:11:03,200
He's insane.

223
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:09,034
Seok Hoon's performance was great too.

224
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,352
I ask for your continuous help

225
00:11:11,376 --> 00:11:12,992
as the Head of Operation,

226
00:11:13,834 --> 00:11:15,034
Chairman Joo.

227
00:11:15,167 --> 00:11:16,326
I'll do my best.

228
00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:19,767
Let's go.

229
00:11:32,917 --> 00:11:34,034
Bae Ro Na.

230
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:37,200
I need to see you.

231
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:41,909
I will have to do volunteer work

232
00:11:42,126 --> 00:11:43,476
and be punished with 10 penalty points?

233

"Chief Director Cheon Myung Soo"

234
00:11:45,126 --> 00:11:46,700
There was an accident.

235
00:11:46,917 --> 00:11:48,810
I could've made it here in time,

236
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:49,851
but the accident--

237
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,060
You make a promise with your audience

238
00:11:51,084 --> 00:11:52,227
when you're scheduled to perform.

239
00:11:52,251 --> 00:11:54,326
The least you can do is be on time.

240
00:11:54,792 --> 00:11:55,810
I can't let personal reasons

241
00:11:55,834 --> 00:11:56,726
be used as an excuse

242
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,768
for an official occasion like this.

243
00:11:57,792 --> 00:11:59,185
You're punished according to our rules.

244
00:11:59,209 --> 00:12:00,559
You can't go in there! - Geez.

245
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,117
I won't be long!

246

"Chief Director Cheon Myung Soo"

247
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,476
Why do you think Ro Na was late?

248
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,618
Mum.

249
00:12:13,709 --> 00:12:15,309
Don't you know best?

250
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,518
What's your ridiculous excuse this time?

251
00:12:17,542 --> 00:12:19,145
A car started following us

252
00:12:19,542 --> 00:12:21,659
as soon as we left home.

253
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:23,227
It kept tailgating me

254
00:12:23,251 --> 00:12:24,809
whenever I switched lanes,

255
00:12:24,834 --> 00:12:26,143
and in the end,

256
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:27,989
it hit my car at an intersection.

257
00:12:28,251 --> 00:12:29,435
Ro Na ran late

258
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:31,285
because of that accident,

259
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,267
and your daughter, Eun Byeol,

260
00:12:33,292 --> 00:12:34,934
got to sing on the stage.

261
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,713
Do you expect me to believe everything was

262
00:12:37,917 --> 00:12:39,316
just a coincidence?

263
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:41,768
Wasn't this your scheme?

264
00:12:41,792 --> 00:12:44,211
You have one amazing imagination.

265
00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:46,788
I guess people...

266
00:12:48,251 --> 00:12:49,727
never change.

267
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:53,184
I'm the one who should be angry.

268
00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:54,143
Your daughter almost ruined

269
00:12:54,167 --> 00:12:55,310
the admission ceremony performance

270
00:12:55,334 --> 00:12:56,476
we'd prepared over two months.

271
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,618
No.

272
00:12:58,084 --> 00:13:00,159
It couldn't have been ruined.

273
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,700
I'm sure your daughter was already set

274
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,544
to perform on that stage.

275
00:13:06,084 --> 00:13:07,794
Listen up, Cheon Seo Jin.

276
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:09,934
I know how Mr Ma Doo Ki made her sing

277
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:11,939
a German song for the audition,

278
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,558
how Ro Na initially didn't make the cut,

279
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,267
and how you called

280
00:13:16,292 --> 00:13:17,352
an emergency parents' meeting

281
00:13:17,376 --> 00:13:18,394
to cancel Ro Na's admission.

282
00:13:18,418 --> 00:13:20,451
All these were schemed by you.

283
00:13:20,709 --> 00:13:23,064
It's not that I was clueless.

284
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:26,352
I knew everything, but I let you do it.

285
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,315
Because right now,

286
00:13:29,834 --> 00:13:31,581
I don't have any power.

287
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,810
I won't change my decision

288
00:13:32,834 --> 00:13:34,367
over your ridiculous argument.

289
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,351
If you continue to insist,

290
00:13:36,376 --> 00:13:37,352
I'll hold her responsible

291
00:13:37,376 --> 00:13:38,310
for defying her teacher's authority

292
00:13:38,334 --> 00:13:40,059
and throw in more penalty points.

293
00:13:40,084 --> 00:13:41,558
You can't do that.

294
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:42,476
I already got 10 penalty points

295
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,141
as soon as I got in the school.

296
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:46,783
Mum, you need to stop.

297
00:13:47,376 --> 00:13:48,492
Fine.

298
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:50,401
Show off your petty power

299
00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:53,145
as much as you want.

300
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:55,534
But don't forget.

301
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,492
If you mess with my daughter,

302
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:01,909
your daughter will

303
00:14:02,834 --> 00:14:04,242
cry tears of blood.

304
00:14:05,667 --> 00:14:07,242
I don't know what you can do,

305
00:14:09,042 --> 00:14:10,451
but do your best.

306
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:15,576
Let's go.

307
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,117
Did you want to see us?

308
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,659
Dad.

309
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,618
You're here.

310
00:14:54,834 --> 00:14:56,451
Seok Kyung, you wanted to study abroad.

311
00:14:57,251 --> 00:14:58,451
If that's your wish,

312
00:14:58,834 --> 00:14:59,893
you should go.

313
00:14:59,917 --> 00:15:01,117
Really?

314
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:03,534
Are you really going to let me go?

315
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,242
Seok Hoon, this is great.

316
00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:07,685
But you're leaving alone.

317
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:08,825
"First Class"

318
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:13,976
What do you mean?

319
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,893
You can't stay

320
00:15:14,917 --> 00:15:16,326
under your brother's shadow forever.

321
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,476
You even got your grades

322
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,700
with your brother's help.

323
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,700
You can't do more damage to him.

324
00:15:20,917 --> 00:15:22,034
No.

325
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:23,576
I can't let her go alone.

326
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:25,825
I wanted to get good grades.

327
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:27,992
I wanted to get on your good side,

328
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,326
but I'm not good at studying.

329
00:15:30,418 --> 00:15:31,435
That's why I did that.

330
00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:33,659
Then you shouldn't have been caught.

331
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:36,851
Gosh, I'm getting tired.

332
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:39,034
I don't want to argue over this anymore.

333
00:15:39,542 --> 00:15:41,159
Take your ticket and get lost, will you?

334
00:15:41,418 --> 00:15:42,726
You must face the consequences

335
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,576
when you destroyed my pride like this.

336
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,909
I'm sorry.

337
00:15:48,334 --> 00:15:49,685
I'm sorry for everything.

338
00:15:49,709 --> 00:15:51,326
I won't do that again.

339
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:53,976
I'll live the life you want from now on.

340
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,618
There's no need to do that.

341
00:15:55,917 --> 00:15:57,476
If you'll bring disgrace to our family,

342
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,476
it'll be better never to see each other.

343
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,476
No.

344
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,659
I can't live away from Seok Hoon!

345
00:16:02,917 --> 00:16:04,992
If you're sending her away, let me go too.

346
00:16:05,167 --> 00:16:07,326
I'll make sure she studies.

347
00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:08,976
She can't be by herself.

348
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,893
She can't even sleep

349
00:16:09,917 --> 00:16:10,810
if there's a thunderstorm.

350
00:16:10,834 --> 00:16:11,934
How can I let her go alone?

351
00:16:13,334 --> 00:16:15,409
This is why I'm separating you two.

352
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,143
You keep disappointing me

353
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:18,267
over Seok Kyung.

354
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,892
Come to your senses.

355
00:16:19,917 --> 00:16:21,851
Joo Seok Hoon, you aren't her brother,

356
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:24,004
but you're Joo Dan Tae's son!

357
00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:26,309
Come in!

358
00:16:29,709 --> 00:16:30,992
Everything is ready, sir.

359
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,393
Mr Cho will take you to the airport.

360
00:16:33,418 --> 00:16:34,673
Take her away.

361
00:16:35,167 --> 00:16:36,309
Seok Hoon.

362
00:16:36,334 --> 00:16:37,310
Seok Hoon.

363
00:16:37,334 --> 00:16:38,700
Seok Hoon, no!

364
00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:42,018
Seok Hoon, no!

365
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,018
No!

366
00:16:43,042 --> 00:16:44,603
Seok Hoon, are you okay?

367
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:46,892
Let her go right now.

368
00:16:46,917 --> 00:16:48,219
Let her go!

369
00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:50,726
What are you doing?

370
00:16:50,751 --> 00:16:52,725
She cheated on her test.

371
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,726
She did something wrong,

372
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:54,935
so she deserves to be punished.

373
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,227
Of course she should be punished.

374
00:16:56,251 --> 00:16:57,601
But this isn't the right way.

375
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:58,950
This is none of your business.

376
00:16:58,975 --> 00:17:00,369
This is between me and the kids.

377
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,056
And they're my kids too!

378
00:17:02,251 --> 00:17:03,518
You gave them so much pressure.

379
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:05,393
That's why she ended up cheating.

380
00:17:05,418 --> 00:17:07,396
Don't just blame the kids for this.

381
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,328
And I'm not sending Seok Kyung abroad.

382
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,476
I'm going to keep her by my side,

383
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,684
scold her, and teach her properly.

384
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:14,200
If you still want to send her away,

385
00:17:14,792 --> 00:17:15,992
I'll go with her.

386
00:17:17,334 --> 00:17:19,284
Are you threatening me right now?

387
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:20,742
You're

388
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,117
threatening me?

389
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,475
I'll study very hard from now on.

390
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,867
I promise, Dad.

391
00:17:25,892 --> 00:17:27,966
How am I supposed to believe you?

392
00:17:30,459 --> 00:17:32,439
What if I get that trophy?

393
00:17:33,042 --> 00:17:34,060
What?

394
00:17:34,084 --> 00:17:36,158
The trophy for Cheonga Art Festival.

395
00:17:37,834 --> 00:17:39,435
I'll win that thing.

396
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:40,975
How are you going to do that?

397
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,018
Will Ha Eun Byeol just sit on her hands?

398
00:17:43,042 --> 00:17:45,370
I can do better than her!

399
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:49,732
If I fail to win that,

400
00:17:50,334 --> 00:17:51,934
I'll leave abroad by myself.

401
00:17:51,959 --> 00:17:53,190
Seok Kyung!

402
00:17:53,215 --> 00:17:54,428
Don't worry.

403
00:17:54,808 --> 00:17:57,303
I'll make sure I get that trophy.

404
00:17:58,459 --> 00:18:00,534
I won't let anyone else take it.

405
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,326
I can do this, Seok Hoon.

406
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:05,992
Trust me.

407
00:18:07,542 --> 00:18:09,700
Give her one more chance, honey.

408
00:18:09,917 --> 00:18:10,893
I ask of you.

409
00:18:10,917 --> 00:18:12,685
How can you take that dumb kid's side?

410
00:18:12,709 --> 00:18:14,601
I made this decision as their dad!

411
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,117
You're too upset right now.

412
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:18,268
You might hurt our kids with your words,

413
00:18:18,292 --> 00:18:19,700
so it'd be better for you to be alone.

414
00:18:21,709 --> 00:18:22,909
Let's go, kids.

415
00:18:25,292 --> 00:18:26,618
What are you doing right now?

416
00:18:26,917 --> 00:18:28,117
Stop right there!

417
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:31,867
Darn it!

418
00:18:37,292 --> 00:18:38,409
Min Seol A.

419
00:18:41,917 --> 00:18:43,492
Did you kill her?

420
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,909
What kind of nonsense are you spewing?

421
00:18:50,418 --> 00:18:51,935
Min Seol A was in the mechanical room

422
00:18:51,959 --> 00:18:53,367
of Hera Palace on that day.

423
00:18:54,917 --> 00:18:56,018
I know that.

424
00:18:56,042 --> 00:18:57,242
Joo Seok Hoon!

425
00:19:00,834 --> 00:19:02,950
Stop bullying my sister.

426
00:19:06,126 --> 00:19:07,867
I won't hold myself back anymore.

427
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:29,950
Hey, lady.

428
00:19:30,917 --> 00:19:33,034
We haven't got the interest yet.

429
00:19:33,709 --> 00:19:34,685
When will you pay back

430
00:19:34,709 --> 00:19:36,034
the interest and the principal?

431
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,367
I said I'll transfer the money soon.

432
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,950
I haven't been paid yet.

433
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,518
It has only been a few days.

434
00:19:44,542 --> 00:19:47,034
Why did you come all the way to my house?

435
00:19:47,542 --> 00:19:51,034
I guess you don't know this is illegal.

436
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:54,960
"Illegal"? Is it?

437
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,618
Illegal?

438
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,950
This is why we don't lend out money.

439
00:19:59,292 --> 00:20:01,351
I told you. - He's going to die.

440
00:20:01,376 --> 00:20:03,601
They beg for money at first,

441
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,475
then change the attitude shortly.

442
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,618
Right?

443
00:20:07,667 --> 00:20:10,394
Korea is a great country, isn't it?

444
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,447
My goodness!

445
00:20:14,792 --> 00:20:17,343
Goodness, a man is dying here.

446
00:20:20,709 --> 00:20:21,867
Don't be late.

447
00:20:22,834 --> 00:20:25,267
If I don't get the principal by this week,

448
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:27,771
I don't know what will happen then.

449
00:20:27,917 --> 00:20:29,034
Okay?

450
00:20:29,709 --> 00:20:30,825
Okay.

451
00:20:34,126 --> 00:20:36,053
Mum, what is this?

452
00:20:36,078 --> 00:20:37,601
"Real Estate Purchase Contract"

453
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,909
We're going to move to Bosong Village?

454
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:43,130
Is this why you took out a private loan?

455
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,475
Where did you get this?

456
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,267
Why did it have to be Bosong Village?

457
00:20:47,292 --> 00:20:48,476
I don't want to go there.

458
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,021
That's where Min Seol A died.

459
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:54,284
Wait.

460
00:20:55,084 --> 00:20:57,341
It's not her old house, is it?

461
00:20:59,251 --> 00:21:01,475
Tell me that it isn't the one!

462
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,659
It's...

463
00:21:04,251 --> 00:21:06,630
What's so bad about that place?

464
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,267
What do you mean?

465
00:21:09,292 --> 00:21:10,559
Mum, have you gone insane?

466
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:13,328
Why do you keep getting involved with her?

467
00:21:13,353 --> 00:21:15,726
I almost became an outcast at school

468
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,810
because of that girl I've never met.

469
00:21:17,834 --> 00:21:20,451
And my admission almost got cancelled!

470
00:21:20,709 --> 00:21:21,935
Yet you're telling me

471
00:21:21,959 --> 00:21:23,809
we're moving to her old apartment?

472
00:21:23,834 --> 00:21:25,018
What were you thinking

473
00:21:25,042 --> 00:21:26,890
when you bought that place?

474
00:21:27,209 --> 00:21:28,618
I'm not moving.

475
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,290
I'm never going there!

476
00:21:30,418 --> 00:21:32,443
It's not like that, Ro Na.

477
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:33,643
Actually, there's a chance

478
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:34,810
that place will be redeveloped

479
00:21:34,834 --> 00:21:36,352
in a bit of time.

480
00:21:36,376 --> 00:21:38,476
Then the housing price will skyrocket--

481
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,476
I don't want to go even if that was true!

482
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,992
I'm never going to move there.

483
00:21:43,561 --> 00:21:45,803
Is it because I look fine right now?

484
00:21:46,149 --> 00:21:49,141
What did I ever do to you, Mum?

485
00:21:49,792 --> 00:21:51,835
If you want to move, go by yourself!

486
00:21:52,167 --> 00:21:54,283
Ro Na, please.

487
00:21:57,277 --> 00:21:58,477
Ro Na.

488
00:22:10,334 --> 00:22:13,475
Mum, Grandpa complimented me today.

489
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,351
He loved my performance today.

490
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:18,505
You made your grandpa very proud today.

491
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:19,647
Great job.

492
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:21,475
It's too early to give her credit.

493
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,062
She made up only a part of her mistakes.

494
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:25,850
Eun Byeol,

495
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:28,226
I hope you won't feel content after this.

496
00:22:28,251 --> 00:22:29,901
What's your next goal?

497
00:22:30,292 --> 00:22:32,483
Of course it's the Cheonga trophy.

498
00:22:40,844 --> 00:22:42,642
If I win the trophy,

499
00:22:42,667 --> 00:22:45,300
Mum will praise me too, right?

500
00:22:46,418 --> 00:22:49,185
Eun Byeol, I'll grant you a wish

501
00:22:49,209 --> 00:22:50,975
for performing so well today.

502
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,326
Do you want anything?

503
00:22:52,709 --> 00:22:55,351
Well, I do have a wish.

504
00:22:55,376 --> 00:22:56,492
What is it?

505
00:22:58,251 --> 00:22:59,367
Why?

506
00:23:00,667 --> 00:23:01,934
Dad.

507
00:23:01,959 --> 00:23:04,477
Can you try to get along with Mum?

508
00:23:05,709 --> 00:23:07,434
What about us?

509
00:23:07,459 --> 00:23:09,142
We're good.

510
00:23:09,167 --> 00:23:10,611
Stop lying.

511
00:23:10,636 --> 00:23:12,960
I know you two fight all the time.

512
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:15,768
My wish is for you and Mum to get along

513
00:23:15,792 --> 00:23:16,935
without getting into fights

514
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:18,117
like the old days.

515
00:23:19,418 --> 00:23:21,409
You have to grant my wish, Dad.

516
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,600
Okay?

517
00:23:24,084 --> 00:23:25,451
Dad, please.

518
00:23:35,209 --> 00:23:36,326
You've done

519
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:38,492
a great job today.

520
00:23:44,418 --> 00:23:45,742
That was unnecessary.

521
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:48,159
Are you bored?

522
00:23:48,917 --> 00:23:50,117
No, I just...

523
00:23:52,459 --> 00:23:54,034
What are you doing this evening?

524
00:23:54,709 --> 00:23:56,618
Do you want to eat out?

525
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,909
Just the two of us.

526
00:24:00,042 --> 00:24:02,950
I mean, Eun Byeol wants to get some rest.

527
00:24:03,292 --> 00:24:04,618
You've worked hard today,

528
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,950
so I'll treat you to something delicious.

529
00:24:12,376 --> 00:24:14,143
I have lessons this evening.

530
00:24:14,167 --> 00:24:15,451
I'll be done at nine.

531
00:24:15,792 --> 00:24:17,242
Oh, really?

532
00:24:18,251 --> 00:24:19,700
We can go out after that.

533
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:21,310
Why don't we grab a glass of cocktail?

534
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:22,451
How's that?

535
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:24,700
I'll get us seats at your favourite place.

536
00:24:42,418 --> 00:24:43,618
That was close.

537
00:24:44,209 --> 00:24:45,309
Go.

538
00:24:46,459 --> 00:24:47,476
Go.

539
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,015
"Joo Dan Tae, Ha Yoon Chul, Lee Kyu Jin"

540
00:24:50,484 --> 00:24:51,105
"Joo Dan Tae, Ha Yoon Chul, Lee Kyu Jin"

541
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:52,992
Yo.

542
00:24:54,418 --> 00:24:55,534
Yo.

543
00:24:57,418 --> 00:24:58,534
Yo.

544
00:24:58,875 --> 00:24:59,975
Yo!

545
00:25:00,418 --> 00:25:02,729
Gosh, have you been practising?

546
00:25:06,042 --> 00:25:07,060
Chairman Joo.

547
00:25:07,084 --> 00:25:09,102
Are you under the weather today?

548
00:25:09,126 --> 00:25:11,950
He can't win all the time.

549
00:25:13,251 --> 00:25:15,117
I guess I'm not in good shape today.

550
00:25:15,792 --> 00:25:17,143
Since you won,

551
00:25:17,167 --> 00:25:18,867
tell us what we're going to do today.

552
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:20,159
Shall I?

553
00:25:20,542 --> 00:25:23,227
Recently, my law firm hired...

554
00:25:23,251 --> 00:25:24,783
Darn it, that condescending jerk.

555
00:25:25,292 --> 00:25:27,768
We got this new annoying attorney.

556
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:29,310
How annoying does he have to be

557
00:25:29,334 --> 00:25:31,534
for you to say things like that?

558
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:32,935
Sounds like a son of a gun.

559
00:25:32,959 --> 00:25:35,075
And that jerk recently

560
00:25:35,126 --> 00:25:36,685
began dating someone too.

561
00:25:36,709 --> 00:25:38,075
And you like her too.

562
00:25:38,959 --> 00:25:40,185
What is this? I got chills.

563
00:25:40,209 --> 00:25:42,159
He deserves to die.

564
00:25:42,334 --> 00:25:44,326
Then we should show him

565
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,601
how things end for a man who covets after

566
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:47,742
what isn't his.

567
00:25:47,917 --> 00:25:49,075
Sounds great.

568
00:25:54,667 --> 00:25:56,576
Darn it.

569
00:25:58,542 --> 00:25:59,700
What is it?

570
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,198
What are you doing, you jerks?

571
00:26:09,126 --> 00:26:10,102
Quiet.

572
00:26:10,126 --> 00:26:11,284
Let me go!

573
00:26:11,459 --> 00:26:12,783
Please stop!

574
00:26:12,917 --> 00:26:14,075
Please!

575
00:26:46,875 --> 00:26:48,576
If you ever see her again,

576
00:26:48,959 --> 00:26:50,117
we'll kill you.

577
00:26:50,583 --> 00:26:51,742
Okay.

578
00:26:52,792 --> 00:26:53,909
Take this.

579
00:26:54,875 --> 00:26:55,992
Go get some diapers.

580
00:26:57,418 --> 00:26:58,700
Bye.

581
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,060
Chairman Joo.

582
00:27:12,084 --> 00:27:14,284
I know something is going on with you.

583
00:27:14,376 --> 00:27:15,851
You're in such a foul mood.

584
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:17,034
If you all have time,

585
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,659
let's grab a drink together.

586
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:19,726
Goodness.

587
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,518
I have plans, so I must go.

588
00:27:21,542 --> 00:27:23,159
At this hour? Why? Who are you meeting?

589
00:27:23,583 --> 00:27:25,227
You're going to meet your first love.

590
00:27:25,251 --> 00:27:26,825
What are you talking about?

591
00:27:27,667 --> 00:27:29,518
I'm going out with my wife.

592
00:27:29,542 --> 00:27:30,825
With Ms Cheon?

593
00:27:31,376 --> 00:27:33,326
Gosh, they're very passionate these days.

594
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,643
You two must be getting along very well.

595
00:27:35,667 --> 00:27:38,071
We always got along well.

596
00:27:38,209 --> 00:27:39,185
I'm leaving.

597
00:27:39,209 --> 00:27:40,326
Goodbye.

598
00:27:43,084 --> 00:27:44,867
Darn it, that jerk.

599
00:28:12,251 --> 00:28:14,101
Yes, I'm leaving now.

600
00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:15,326
It's me.

601
00:28:15,625 --> 00:28:17,134
Can we meet?

602
00:28:43,542 --> 00:28:44,742
I'm waiting for you.

603
00:28:45,334 --> 00:28:46,451
I love you.

604
00:28:49,804 --> 00:28:50,962
"Nakwon Musical Instruments"

605
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:30,476
My dad called me in urgently.

606
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,825
I don't think I can be there.

607
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,406
I'll see you at home.

608
00:30:04,834 --> 00:30:07,133
Yes, Father. It's me, Yoon Chul.

609
00:30:07,251 --> 00:30:08,451
Did you get home all right?

610
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,326
No, I'm at work right now.

611
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,742
Right, I see.

612
00:30:15,167 --> 00:30:16,492
Thank you for your hard work today.

613
00:30:16,625 --> 00:30:18,200
Seo Jin put in all the work.

614
00:30:19,084 --> 00:30:20,242
You two should go out

615
00:30:20,667 --> 00:30:22,576
together on a day like this.

616
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:28,909
Yes, Father.

617
00:30:29,709 --> 00:30:30,909
We'll do that.

618
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,700
Goodbye.

619
00:31:10,126 --> 00:31:11,284
I'll be a little late.

620
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,700
Something came up at work.

621
00:31:13,209 --> 00:31:14,909
Yes, you should go to sleep first.

622
00:31:24,625 --> 00:31:26,367
This is very rude of you, Mr Joo Dan Tae.

623
00:31:26,875 --> 00:31:29,242
You cut off our relationship as you like,

624
00:31:29,917 --> 00:31:31,825
then you called me out like this.

625
00:31:33,459 --> 00:31:35,117
Didn't you come because you also had

626
00:31:35,292 --> 00:31:36,268
some feelings left?

627
00:31:36,292 --> 00:31:37,576
Don't be delusional.

628
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,700
I came here to warn you.

629
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,200
I finally realised today

630
00:31:42,542 --> 00:31:44,476
what kind of a woman Cheon Seo Jin is,

631
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,867
the woman I like.

632
00:31:46,583 --> 00:31:47,825
That you're a charming woman

633
00:31:48,334 --> 00:31:49,726
who gets what she wants

634
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,700
and does whatever she sets her mind to it.

635
00:31:52,542 --> 00:31:53,950
I can

636
00:31:54,334 --> 00:31:56,618
truly be myself when I'm with you.

637
00:31:57,959 --> 00:31:59,059
I like that.

638
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,451
I don't have to pretend when I'm with you.

639
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:05,492
I'm not in dire need of a man.

640
00:32:05,792 --> 00:32:08,783
I'm more than confident with myself.

641
00:32:09,334 --> 00:32:10,726
I just live with a husband

642
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,825
to complete a family like everyone else,

643
00:32:13,292 --> 00:32:14,783
and I have nothing to complain.

644
00:32:15,542 --> 00:32:16,783
Stop lying.

645
00:32:19,959 --> 00:32:22,242
You're a woman who will never be satisfied

646
00:32:22,459 --> 00:32:24,700
with an idiot like Ha Yoon Chul.

647
00:32:27,834 --> 00:32:29,284
You need me.

648
00:32:30,792 --> 00:32:31,950
That's why...

649
00:32:33,834 --> 00:32:35,034
I'll never let you go again.

650
00:32:35,167 --> 00:32:37,284
I make the decisions for our relationship.

651
00:32:37,792 --> 00:32:39,227
I decide if we get back together

652
00:32:39,251 --> 00:32:40,451
or if we break up.

653
00:32:43,684 --> 00:32:46,160
Don't get so cheeky from now on, Dan Tae.

What is it?

662
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,200
It was the first time...

663
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,367
anyone had ever said that to me.

664
00:33:55,583 --> 00:33:57,034
That you love me.

665
00:34:02,292 --> 00:34:03,783
I have a confession to make too.

666
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,700
I decided

667
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,159
to break my rule as of today.

668
00:34:17,292 --> 00:34:19,018
That we won't try to control each other

669
00:34:19,042 --> 00:34:20,700
or get attached to one another.

670
00:34:21,583 --> 00:34:22,950
The rule we made to break it off

671
00:34:23,459 --> 00:34:25,409
when one of us is done with the other.

672

You're the first person

673
00:34:31,709 --> 00:34:32,950
who broke that rule.

674
00:35:40,167 --> 00:35:42,394
Dad, find me a different tutor.

675
00:35:42,418 --> 00:35:43,992
Someone who doesn't teach Eun Byeol.

676
00:35:44,126 --> 00:35:45,643
I want the best tutor you can find.

That's my job as your mum.

678
00:35:47,709 --> 00:35:48,992
I'll look into it.

679
00:35:49,709 --> 00:35:51,518
You're determined to study hard now,

680
00:35:51,542 --> 00:35:53,367
so I should do my best to help you.

681
00:35:54,917 --> 00:35:56,159
I'm off to school.

682
00:35:57,709 --> 00:35:58,992
See you later.

Let me deal with the kids from now on.

685
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,476
They're sensitive now.

686
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,559
If you push them too hard,

687
00:36:14,583 --> 00:36:15,909
they might rebel.

688
00:36:16,292 --> 00:36:17,867
I'll pamper them

689
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,409
and pay more attention to them.

690
00:36:24,126 --> 00:36:26,284
I have something to discuss with you.

691
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:28,618
I'm thinking of taking over

692
00:36:28,917 --> 00:36:30,534
my mum's furniture business.

693
00:36:30,834 --> 00:36:32,159
All of a sudden?

694
00:36:32,542 --> 00:36:33,783
Why?

695
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:35,700
I'm having a hard time

696
00:36:36,042 --> 00:36:38,117
coping with Hye In's death.

697
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,060
The business manager

698
00:36:40,084 --> 00:36:41,685
has been doing a fine job.

699
00:36:41,709 --> 00:36:42,992
You want to work

700
00:36:43,126 --> 00:36:44,476
all of a sudden?

701
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,726
My mum worked hard to build that business,

702
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:47,976
so I no longer want to leave it

703
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,100
in someone else's hands.

704
00:36:49,917 --> 00:36:51,534
Let me do it, please.

705
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:53,992
I'll make sure it doesn't affect you.

706
00:36:54,709 --> 00:36:57,034
What's with you today?

707
00:36:57,334 --> 00:36:58,867
You'll let me do it, right?

708
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,643
Eat up.

709
00:37:01,667 --> 00:37:03,436
I'll have your clothes ready.

710
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:04,601
I bought you a new dress shirt.

711
00:37:04,625 --> 00:37:06,200
You'll like it.

712
00:37:27,774 --> 00:37:29,659
"Cheonga Arts High School"

713
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:33,700
Stand in line. Put your bags down.

714
00:37:34,954 --> 00:37:36,238
What do I do?

715
00:37:37,875 --> 00:37:40,664
I'll get a penalty point for being late.

716
00:37:48,542 --> 00:37:50,049
You're late too?

717
00:37:51,709 --> 00:37:53,159
Joo Seok Hoon?

718
00:37:58,042 --> 00:37:59,326
Get up there.

719
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:00,643
What?

720
00:38:00,667 --> 00:38:02,185
Step on my back and climb over.

721
00:38:02,209 --> 00:38:04,309
You can't be late on your first day.

722
00:38:05,542 --> 00:38:07,629
Okay, thanks in advance.

723
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:14,950
My gosh.

724
00:38:22,959 --> 00:38:25,418
Hey, can you pass me my bag?

725
00:38:26,959 --> 00:38:28,409
Thanks.

726
00:38:28,875 --> 00:38:30,859
You should climb over too.

727
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,476
Hey.

728
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,975
Seok Hoon, what are you doing?

729
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,450
Climb over quickly.

730
00:38:41,925 --> 00:38:42,855
"Don't be late"

731
00:38:49,063 --> 00:38:51,477
"Cheonga Arts High School"

732
00:38:52,251 --> 00:38:53,268
Eun Byeol!

733
00:38:53,292 --> 00:38:55,060
Your video is all over social media.

734
00:38:55,084 --> 00:38:57,102
You looked stunning yesterday.

735
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:58,976
Your dress is from Vera Wang, right?

736
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,935
Yes, my mum wore it when she was

737
00:39:00,959 --> 00:39:02,268
graduating from Seoul University of Music.

738
00:39:02,292 --> 00:39:03,394
I got it altered a little.

739
00:39:03,418 --> 00:39:05,825
I see. It looked so classy.

740
00:39:06,084 --> 00:39:07,960
Hey, Waiting List.

741
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,935
You're awfully late for someone

742
00:39:10,959 --> 00:39:12,517
who was on the waiting list.

743
00:39:12,542 --> 00:39:14,060
Be honest.

744
00:39:14,084 --> 00:39:16,184
You chickened out yesterday, didn't you?

745
00:39:16,209 --> 00:39:18,947
Did you suddenly get scared

746
00:39:18,972 --> 00:39:20,829
of performing on a big stage?

747
00:39:20,854 --> 00:39:22,221
Get out of my way.

748
00:39:22,376 --> 00:39:23,492
Is it true?

749
00:39:24,875 --> 00:39:26,159
Or false?

750
00:39:26,376 --> 00:39:27,310
Were you really

751
00:39:27,334 --> 00:39:29,142
in a car accident yesterday?

752
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:31,326
How come you look totally fine?

753
00:39:31,792 --> 00:39:33,971
Think whatever you want.

754
00:39:35,292 --> 00:39:37,045
You little...

755
00:39:39,959 --> 00:39:41,616
Be honest with yourself.

756
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,476
Are you angry that someone who was

757
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,786
on the waiting list almost performed solo?

758
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,518
Or are you angry that I beat you guys

759
00:39:47,542 --> 00:39:49,352
despite being on the waiting list?

760
00:39:53,917 --> 00:39:55,409
Be honest.

761
00:39:55,542 --> 00:39:57,534
Are you angry that an orphan tutored you?

762
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,081
Or are you angry that I beat you guys?

763
00:40:00,459 --> 00:40:02,351
Is that why you're being so childish?

764
00:40:02,376 --> 00:40:04,134
From the first day of school?

765
00:40:04,959 --> 00:40:06,493
I pity you guys.

766
00:40:09,792 --> 00:40:11,034
I pity you.

767
00:40:12,126 --> 00:40:13,935
This is pitiful and sad.

768
00:40:15,583 --> 00:40:16,559
Watch what you say.

769
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:18,352
Who are you to pity us?

770
00:40:18,376 --> 00:40:20,704
You guys should watch what you say.

771
00:40:26,292 --> 00:40:27,886
This seat is taken.

772
00:40:28,734 --> 00:40:29,934
Really?

773
00:40:29,959 --> 00:40:31,367
Oh, no.

774
00:40:31,901 --> 00:40:33,101
This one's taken too.

775
00:40:33,126 --> 00:40:35,084
This one's taken for sure.

776
00:40:36,334 --> 00:40:37,866
You can sit here.

777
00:40:38,459 --> 00:40:40,432
The seat next to me is empty.

778
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:46,284
Thanks.

779
00:40:49,436 --> 00:40:51,649
Who's free today?

780
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,601
What's going on?

781
00:40:53,625 --> 00:40:55,185
My mum is throwing a party for me.

782
00:40:55,209 --> 00:40:56,643
Come over to my place after school.

783
00:40:56,667 --> 00:40:58,793
I'm coming. - I want to go too.

784
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,475
Why bother asking?

785
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,892
Everyone's invited except for one person.

786
00:41:02,917 --> 00:41:04,227
Then I'll see you all there,

787
00:41:04,251 --> 00:41:05,434
except for her.

788
00:41:05,459 --> 00:41:06,476
Seok Hoon and Seok Kyung.

789
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,089
You're coming, right?

790
00:41:08,917 --> 00:41:11,742
Sorry, I don't think I can make it.

791
00:41:15,625 --> 00:41:16,518
Ro Na.

792
00:41:16,542 --> 00:41:18,558
Do you want to come over to my place?

793
00:41:18,583 --> 00:41:20,492
Me? - Yes, you.

794
00:41:21,251 --> 00:41:22,726
Let's study together at my place.

795
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:23,726
What?

796
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:25,642
Are they now best friends or what?

797
00:41:25,667 --> 00:41:27,600
Since when were they friends?

798
00:41:27,625 --> 00:41:28,992
Since now.

799
00:41:31,126 --> 00:41:32,434
You'll come, right?

800
00:41:32,459 --> 00:41:34,171
Then I'll stay home too.

801
00:41:39,376 --> 00:41:41,036
Everyone, be seated.

802
00:41:45,917 --> 00:41:48,975
I'll be your homeroom teacher.

803
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,394
My name is Ma Doo Ki.

804
00:41:50,418 --> 00:41:52,451
I teach vocal music.

805
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,184
Ma Doo Ki?

806
00:41:55,209 --> 00:41:56,601
Didn't you see the notice?

807
00:41:56,625 --> 00:41:58,351
The exam format has changed.

808
00:41:58,376 --> 00:42:00,185
They added a German song category.

809
00:42:00,209 --> 00:42:02,352
Why? Is he not answering?

810
00:42:02,376 --> 00:42:03,725
We've been fooled.

811
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:06,676
They never added a German song category.

812
00:42:12,917 --> 00:42:14,117
Mr Ma.

813
00:42:15,542 --> 00:42:17,451
Hi, Ro Na. What's up?

814
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:19,409
Don't you have anything

815
00:42:20,042 --> 00:42:21,367
to say to me?

816
00:42:22,209 --> 00:42:23,227
What do you mean?

817
00:42:23,251 --> 00:42:25,618
Shouldn't you at least apologise?

818
00:42:26,583 --> 00:42:27,867
You purposely

819
00:42:27,917 --> 00:42:30,227
made me practise a German song.

820
00:42:30,251 --> 00:42:32,700
Oh, did I?

821
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,559
I must've been mistaken.

822
00:42:34,583 --> 00:42:35,950
I'm sorry.

823
00:42:36,126 --> 00:42:38,102
But you got in anyway.

824
00:42:38,126 --> 00:42:39,268
So it's all good, right?

825
00:42:39,292 --> 00:42:40,534
I'll see you later.

826
00:42:41,709 --> 00:42:43,117
Who put you up to it?

827
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,534
Was it Ms Cheon Seo Jin?

828
00:42:45,959 --> 00:42:47,518
Is that how you got this job

829
00:42:47,542 --> 00:42:49,117
at Cheonga Arts High School?

830
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,700
How cheeky of you.

831
00:42:53,167 --> 00:42:55,867
Refrain from making such dangerous remarks

832
00:42:56,667 --> 00:42:59,117
if you care about your school life.

833
00:42:59,625 --> 00:43:00,825

840
00:43:20,334 --> 00:43:22,242
Do you want to deal with the cops again?

What?

00:43:58,418 --> 00:44:00,825
Why? Am I wrong?

857
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:04,326
You also stole my solo performance.

858
00:44:04,834 --> 00:44:06,700
Deny it if you can.

859
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:10,992
You are

860
00:44:11,418 --> 00:44:12,742
just...

861
00:44:13,209 --> 00:44:14,492
a darned thief.

862
00:44:21,418 --> 00:44:22,950
How dare you!

863
00:44:34,709 --> 00:44:37,326
Things will be easier than we thought.

864
00:44:41,167 --> 00:44:42,534
Can we pull over?

865
00:44:43,251 --> 00:44:45,242
What is it? - I have

866
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,992
a good idea.

867
00:44:48,459 --> 00:44:50,659
Why don't you hit on her?

868
00:44:50,834 --> 00:44:52,518
It'll drive Eun Byeol crazy.

869
00:44:52,542 --> 00:44:54,227
What is this nonsense?

870
00:44:54,251 --> 00:44:55,435
Girls like her quickly fall for guys

871
00:44:55,459 --> 00:44:57,034
who are nice to them.

872
00:44:58,126 --> 00:44:59,476
Let's use her

873
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,159
to mess with Eun Byeol.

874
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,185
You know Eun Byeol has a crush on you.

875
00:45:04,209 --> 00:45:05,409
Forget it.

876
00:45:06,418 --> 00:45:07,601
I don't want to get involved with her.

877
00:45:07,625 --> 00:45:09,352
Come on. Do it for me, please.

878
00:45:09,376 --> 00:45:11,367
I really want to beat Eun Byeol.

879
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:12,685
No, I won't do it.

880
00:45:12,709 --> 00:45:14,659
Don't even bring it up again.

881
00:45:17,709 --> 00:45:19,659
What if I go kill myself? Do you not care?

882
00:45:24,042 --> 00:45:26,242
Bae Ro Na, you intrigue me.

883
00:45:26,418 --> 00:45:27,825
I like you.

884
00:45:32,126 --> 00:45:33,476
What are you two doing?

885
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,768
Ha Eun Byeol! Bae Ro Na!

886
00:45:34,792 --> 00:45:36,284
Stop that now!

887
00:45:38,296 --> 00:45:39,310
What are you doing

888
00:45:39,334 --> 00:45:41,059
on the first day of school?

889
00:45:41,084 --> 00:45:42,893
You'll both get one penalty point.

890
00:45:42,917 --> 00:45:44,159
That's not fair.

891
00:45:44,292 --> 00:45:45,643
She picked a fight with me first.

892
00:45:45,667 --> 00:45:46,768
No, that's not true!

893
00:45:46,792 --> 00:45:48,476
She cursed at me first.

894
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,507
She called me a darned thief.

895
00:45:51,625 --> 00:45:53,492
A fake winner.

896
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:54,970
You, Cheon Seo Jin.

897
00:45:55,126 --> 00:45:59,278
You are just a darned thief.

898
00:46:00,334 --> 00:46:02,138
Did you really say that?

899
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,476
You used such a vulgar word

900
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,132
at school?

901
00:46:08,834 --> 00:46:10,739
Eun Byeol, you're bleeding!

902
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:14,185
Je Ni, take her to the infirmary now.

903
00:46:14,209 --> 00:46:15,394
Eun Byeol, let's go.

904
00:46:15,418 --> 00:46:16,810
Gosh, are you all right?

905
00:46:16,834 --> 00:46:18,726
Keep your head up. - My gosh.

906
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:20,268
Keep your head up. - Let's hurry.

907
00:46:20,292 --> 00:46:21,810
Hey, be careful.

908
00:46:21,834 --> 00:46:22,935
Bae Ro Na.

909
00:46:22,959 --> 00:46:24,060
Did you forget that

910
00:46:24,084 --> 00:46:25,200
you're on probation now?

911
00:46:26,167 --> 00:46:28,394
If problems keep arising around you,

912
00:46:28,418 --> 00:46:30,200
maybe you are the one to blame.

913
00:46:30,583 --> 00:46:32,102
You worked hard to get into this school,

914
00:46:32,126 --> 00:46:33,185
so become a student

915
00:46:33,209 --> 00:46:34,725
that is qualified to be here.

916
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,267
If you don't think you can do that,

917
00:46:36,292 --> 00:46:38,237
you can drop out today.

918
00:46:39,167 --> 00:46:40,726
Why should I drop out?

919
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:41,935
I didn't do anything wrong!

920
00:46:41,959 --> 00:46:44,475
You won't even reflect on your actions?

921
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:45,518
Fine. Three more penalty points

922
00:46:45,542 --> 00:46:47,354
and five more hours of volunteer work.

923

Ms Cheon!

924
00:46:48,339 --> 00:46:49,322
Five additional penalty points

925
00:46:49,347 --> 00:46:51,769
and 10 more hours of volunteer work!

926

Don't you hear the bell?

927
00:46:58,126 --> 00:46:59,476
Go back to your classroom.

928
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:00,783

Where did you have to go this late?

934
00:47:36,059 --> 00:47:38,117
A lesson was booked at the last minute.

935
00:47:38,142 --> 00:47:39,742
I was in the lesson room.

936
00:47:39,767 --> 00:47:40,826
My dad called me in urgently,

937
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:42,317
so I can't be there.

938
00:47:42,476 --> 00:47:43,835
You should go out

939
00:47:44,059 --> 00:47:46,758
on a day like this.

940
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:53,392
Sir.

941
00:47:53,417 --> 00:47:54,468
The patient is losing a lot of blood.

942
00:47:54,492 --> 00:47:55,968
His blood pressure keeps on dropping.

943
00:47:55,992 --> 00:47:56,927
Give him more oxygen.

944
00:47:56,951 --> 00:47:57,843
Got it.

945
00:47:57,867 --> 00:48:00,300
Increase the volume and add inotropes.

at someone's vacation villa last night.

951
00:48:48,117 --> 00:48:50,144
I think the colour should be

952
00:48:50,169 --> 00:48:52,052
similar to that colour over there.

953
00:48:52,076 --> 00:48:54,859
Let's go with those colours.

954
00:48:55,951 --> 00:48:57,176
She was at the factory earlier.

955
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,525
Right now, she's at the showroom.

956
00:48:58,992 --> 00:49:01,279

Don't miss anything.

Yes, sir.

962
00:49:15,992 --> 00:49:17,151
Here, sir.

963
00:49:18,575 --> 00:49:20,010
The file contains forensic results

964
00:49:20,034 --> 00:49:21,675
of Mr Yoon's laptop.

965
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:23,151

"A 17-year-old orphan in Bosong Village

984
00:50:17,034 --> 00:50:19,984
took her own life due to depression.

985

The police searched her house

and found a suicide note

987

blaming the world.

988
00:50:25,826 --> 00:50:28,218
She forged her identity

989
00:50:28,242 --> 00:50:29,676
as a college student

990
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:31,400
and committed fraud.

991
00:50:31,534 --> 00:50:32,968
It seems that she made

992
00:50:32,992 --> 00:50:33,885
such a rash decision

993
00:50:33,909 --> 00:50:35,686
because her crime was exposed."

995
00:50:42,534 --> 00:50:43,885
Sounds pretty persuasive, doesn't it?

996
00:50:43,909 --> 00:50:45,593
Do you think I came here

997

without a backup plan?

998
00:50:47,992 --> 00:50:50,144

If anything bad happens to me,

1000

at that orphanage?

1015
00:51:54,659 --> 00:51:56,343
my mum founded this company.

1016
00:51:56,367 --> 00:51:58,151
What? So your family

1017
00:51:58,727 --> 00:52:00,154
owns this company?

1018
00:52:00,179 --> 00:52:02,712
Hold on. Does that mean your parents

1019
00:52:03,325 --> 00:52:05,759
also own Simwoon Construction?

1020
00:52:05,784 --> 00:52:08,460

We didn't know.

1023
00:52:12,242 --> 00:52:14,277

00:52:25,992 --> 00:52:27,176
No, not really.

1028
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,859
We're just comfortable. That's all.

1029
00:52:29,951 --> 00:52:32,510
What does your dad do?

1030
00:52:32,534 --> 00:52:34,176
He invests in projects

1031
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:35,218
and does other stuff.

1032
00:52:35,242 --> 00:52:36,567
Frankly, I don't really know.

1033
00:52:38,742 --> 00:52:40,927
Next time, invite us over to your place.

1034
00:52:40,951 --> 00:52:42,400
I want to see your place too.

1035
00:52:43,767 --> 00:52:45,009
Okay.

1036
00:52:45,034 --> 00:52:46,259
Welcome.

1037
00:52:46,283 --> 00:52:47,888
You're Ro Na, right?

1038
00:52:48,076 --> 00:52:49,359
Hello.

1039
00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:51,635
You should stay for dinner.

1040
00:52:51,659 --> 00:52:52,635
I didn't know what you like,

1041
00:52:52,659 --> 00:52:54,717
so I cooked whatever I could think of.

1042
00:52:54,742 --> 00:52:55,859
Okay.

1043
00:52:56,159 --> 00:52:57,301
My room is over there.

1044
00:52:57,325 --> 00:52:58,873
Go take a look.

1045
00:53:01,283 --> 00:53:03,117
Why don't you show her around?

1046
00:53:03,909 --> 00:53:05,276
Come with me.

1047
00:53:13,034 --> 00:53:14,234
Gosh, my back hurts.

1048
00:53:21,992 --> 00:53:23,234
Hello?

1049
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:25,026
Who is this?

1050
00:53:25,826 --> 00:53:28,067
Yes, I'm Ro Na's mum.

1051
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,567
Sorry, who?

1052
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:40,560
It's nice to meet you, Ms Oh.

1053
00:53:40,584 --> 00:53:41,726
Welcome.

1054
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:43,060
Hello.

1055
00:53:43,084 --> 00:53:44,601
I didn't want to come empty-handed,

1056
00:53:44,625 --> 00:53:46,225
so I brought some fruit.

1057
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:48,601
My gosh, you didn't have to.

1058
00:53:49,597 --> 00:53:51,650
Thank you for the fruit.

1059
00:53:53,292 --> 00:53:56,326
You have such a nice house.

1060
00:53:57,292 --> 00:54:00,373
Thank you for inviting me.

1061
00:54:01,709 --> 00:54:03,117
How are you feeling?

1062
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:05,159
Were you hurt?

1063
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:07,700
Ro Na told me about the accident

1064
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:10,201
on the day of the admission ceremony.

1065
00:54:10,917 --> 00:54:13,226
Right. Thankfully, I wasn't hurt.

1066
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,435
I heard a car crashed into you

1067
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:16,700
from behind. - Yes.

1068
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:20,017
That's why Ro Na couldn't perform.

1069
00:54:20,042 --> 00:54:22,308
And she even got penalty points.

1070
00:54:22,333 --> 00:54:23,704
It's all my fault.

1071
00:54:23,729 --> 00:54:25,872
Why is that your fault?

1072
00:54:25,897 --> 00:54:27,934
You didn't cause the accident.

1073
00:54:27,959 --> 00:54:29,726
Make sure they investigate it thoroughly,

1074
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:31,997
and do not settle easily.

1075
00:54:32,333 --> 00:54:35,325
Pardon? - Your daughter almost got hurt.

1076
00:54:35,625 --> 00:54:38,383
You must protect your child at all costs.

1077
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:41,944
Because you're her mother.

1078
00:54:43,292 --> 00:54:44,492
If needed,

1079
00:54:44,869 --> 00:54:46,178
a mother can become vicious

1080
00:54:46,203 --> 00:54:49,045
for her child's sake, you know?

1081
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:56,992
I'll call the chancellor.

1082
00:55:06,209 --> 00:55:07,700
Hello, Ms Cheon.

1083
00:55:08,126 --> 00:55:09,226
Security!

1084
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:10,742
Yes, ma'am!

1085
00:55:10,959 --> 00:55:12,700
What's the matter, ma'am?

1086
00:55:13,126 --> 00:55:15,018
What is wrong with the security here?

1087
00:55:15,042 --> 00:55:16,393
You were told to never let in

1088
00:55:16,417 --> 00:55:17,726
those on the black list.

1089
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:18,643
Why do I see strangers

1090
00:55:18,667 --> 00:55:19,852
going in and out of this place?

1091
00:55:19,876 --> 00:55:20,768
Did Hera Palace always have

1092
00:55:20,792 --> 00:55:22,017
such poor security?

1093
00:55:22,042 --> 00:55:24,226
We were invited, Ms Cheon.

1094
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:25,852
From now on, make sure

1095
00:55:25,876 --> 00:55:27,144
the maids cannot use

1096
00:55:27,168 --> 00:55:28,643
the elevators for the residents.

1097
00:55:28,667 --> 00:55:30,326
If this happens again,

1098
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:32,977
you will be held accountable.

1099
00:55:33,001 --> 00:55:34,201
Understood, ma'am.

1100
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:38,476
Hey, lady!

1101
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,867
When did you sneak back in?

1102
00:55:40,917 --> 00:55:43,368
Are you trying to get me fired?

1103
00:55:44,417 --> 00:55:45,575
Get out.

1104
00:55:46,001 --> 00:55:47,185
Leave at once!

1105
00:55:47,209 --> 00:55:48,643
Please leave. - Okay, I'm leaving!

1106
00:55:48,667 --> 00:55:50,768
I will leave on my own!

1107
00:55:50,792 --> 00:55:52,518
Come on! - Don't touch my daughter.

1108
00:55:52,542 --> 00:55:54,309
I said, don't touch her! - Just leave!

1109
00:55:54,333 --> 00:55:55,784
Hands off!

1110
00:55:58,876 --> 00:56:00,185
Get out!

1111
00:56:00,209 --> 00:56:01,685
Gosh, why are you being like this?

1112
00:56:01,709 --> 00:56:03,242
Just get out!

1113
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:06,992
I want to live here too.

1114
00:56:08,042 --> 00:56:09,784
A place like Hera Palace.

1115
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:22,909
I promise you

1116
00:56:23,375 --> 00:56:25,034
that I will make it happen.

1117
00:56:25,959 --> 00:56:27,368
I will do

1118
00:56:28,042 --> 00:56:30,617
whatever it takes

1119
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:32,825
to make sure

1120
00:56:33,126 --> 00:56:34,950
you get to live here one day.

1121
00:56:36,792 --> 00:56:39,117
No one will dare to look down on you

1122
00:56:40,792 --> 00:56:42,533
or think they can walk all over you.

1123
00:56:44,375 --> 00:56:45,533
Then promise me

1124
00:56:45,876 --> 00:56:48,117
that we won't move to Bosong Village.

1125
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:50,450
Hey, we're moving tomorrow.

1126
00:56:50,792 --> 00:56:52,575
We can't cancel the move now.

1127
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:54,742
We have to move out by tomorrow.

1128
00:56:54,792 --> 00:56:56,700
How could you do this to me, Mum?

1129
00:56:57,084 --> 00:56:58,144
How will I go to school

1130
00:56:58,168 --> 00:56:59,450
if the other kids find out?

1131
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,643
It's already so stressful.

1132
00:57:01,667 --> 00:57:03,326
Must you make things worse?

1133
00:57:03,375 --> 00:57:05,393
People live there too, you know.

1134
00:57:05,417 --> 00:57:08,492
We can't keep on wasting money on rent.

1135
00:57:08,584 --> 00:57:10,185
It may be a shabby flat, but it's ours.

1136
00:57:10,209 --> 00:57:11,935
And the price will go up with time.

1137
00:57:11,959 --> 00:57:13,284
Gosh.

1138
00:57:14,084 --> 00:57:15,185
You worked in real estate,

1139
00:57:15,209 --> 00:57:16,409
so you should know better.

1140
00:57:17,459 --> 00:57:19,393
The real estate prices in that area

1141
00:57:19,417 --> 00:57:20,575
will never go up.

1142
00:57:20,625 --> 00:57:21,518
Even if it does,

1143
00:57:21,542 --> 00:57:22,742
I don't want to live there.

1144
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:25,518
Why must I pay for your mistake?

1145
00:57:25,542 --> 00:57:26,643
Ro Na, I'm doing this

1146
00:57:26,667 --> 00:57:28,102
so we can live more comfortably.

1147
00:57:28,126 --> 00:57:29,643
I'm obviously not doing this

1148
00:57:29,667 --> 00:57:31,450
to make you suffer.

1149
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:32,909
Do you not know

1150
00:57:33,459 --> 00:57:34,700
how much I care about you?

1151
00:57:35,667 --> 00:57:36,825
I don't know.

1152
00:57:37,542 --> 00:57:38,992
I hate you,

1153
00:57:39,126 --> 00:57:41,034
Ms Cheon, and everyone else.

1154
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,518
You ruined everything,

1155
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:44,117
including my school life!

1156
00:57:46,375 --> 00:57:47,867
Ro Na.

1157
00:57:48,834 --> 00:57:50,450
Ro Na!

1158
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:15,784
Hello, sir.

1159
00:58:16,459 --> 00:58:17,575
I'm the person

1160
00:58:17,917 --> 00:58:20,242
who bought Unit 501 in Bosong Village.

1161
00:58:20,959 --> 00:58:24,533
Could you actually help me sell it?

1162
00:58:25,709 --> 00:58:28,242
It's kind of urgent.

1163
00:58:29,667 --> 00:58:31,226
Yes, I'm sorry.

1164
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:32,435
Please sell it as soon as you can.

1165
00:58:32,459 --> 00:58:34,284
Okay, thank you.

1166
00:58:45,667 --> 00:58:47,450
What? Who's moving where?

1167
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:49,617
What?

1168
00:58:49,876 --> 00:58:51,450
Oh Yoon Hee, that obnoxious woman,

1169
00:58:51,709 --> 00:58:53,575
is moving to Min Seol A's place?

1170
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:55,533
Why?

1171
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:59,326
My husband told me.

1172
00:58:59,375 --> 00:59:02,242
Gosh, she's so weird.

1173
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:05,351
Isn't she creeped out about living there?

1174
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:08,268
Gosh, it is really creepy.

1175
00:59:08,292 --> 00:59:09,643
I'm getting goosebumps.

1176
00:59:09,667 --> 00:59:11,060
That woman and her daughter

1177
00:59:11,084 --> 00:59:12,742
are both unbelievable.

1178
00:59:12,959 --> 00:59:16,450
Maybe they did something to Min Seol A.

1179
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:18,034
I knew this would happen.

1180
00:59:18,459 --> 00:59:19,643
I'm surprised Oh Yoon Hee

1181
00:59:19,667 --> 00:59:21,368
managed to hold out for this long.

1182
00:59:21,667 --> 00:59:23,034
The plan for the redevelopment

1183
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:24,784
will be announced tomorrow afternoon.

1184
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:26,617
Tomorrow?

1185
00:59:28,584 --> 00:59:31,018
That woman is awfully unlucky.

1186
00:59:31,042 --> 00:59:32,768
She gave up just before the big day

1187
00:59:32,792 --> 00:59:34,992
after holding out for months.

1188
00:59:35,126 --> 00:59:37,450
I suppose fate never helps the poor.

1189
00:59:39,834 --> 00:59:41,575
Once she signs it tomorrow morning,

1190
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:43,076
everything will be over.

1191
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:46,409
After that, we'll have full ownership

1192
00:59:46,459 --> 00:59:48,867
over the 10 units in Bosong Village.

1193
00:59:56,959 --> 00:59:58,326
Take this.

1194
00:59:58,959 --> 01:00:00,492
Ro Na, take this.

1195
01:00:00,959 --> 01:00:02,284
Gosh, Ro Na.

1196
01:00:03,667 --> 01:00:04,950
Come on, Ro Na.

1197
01:00:07,126 --> 01:00:08,825
Take your sandwich.

1198
01:00:09,042 --> 01:00:11,284
You can't sing well on an empty stomach.

1199
01:00:12,209 --> 01:00:13,326
Come to Unit 501

1200
01:00:13,542 --> 01:00:15,159
in Bosong Village after school.

1201
01:00:15,569 --> 01:00:17,170
I'll unpack everything

1202
01:00:17,195 --> 01:00:19,146
and wait for you, okay?

1203
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:32,575
Hey!

1204
01:00:35,084 --> 01:00:36,409
Here, it's heavy.

1205
01:00:42,171 --> 01:00:44,148
Gosh, be careful.

1206
01:00:50,445 --> 01:00:51,645
Hello?

1207
01:00:51,670 --> 01:00:53,644
Hello, this is the real estate office.

1208
01:00:53,669 --> 01:00:55,005
Aren't you coming to sign the agreement?

1209
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:56,225
The person who wants to buy the place

1210
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:57,332
is here with the down payment.

1211
01:00:57,357 --> 01:00:59,310
Sell it when you have the chance.

1212
01:00:59,335 --> 01:01:01,981
Oh, I'm in the middle of a move now.

1213
01:01:02,006 --> 01:01:03,673
Okay, I'll be right there.

1214
01:01:03,698 --> 01:01:04,898
All right.

1215
01:01:05,903 --> 01:01:07,020
She's coming.

1216
01:01:10,001 --> 01:01:11,101
Is he your kid?

1217
01:01:11,375 --> 01:01:12,852
My gosh.

1218
01:01:12,876 --> 01:01:14,450
Look at you.

1219
01:01:14,584 --> 01:01:16,659
You're still young, I guess.

1220
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:20,659
Can you actually

1221
01:01:21,126 --> 01:01:23,533
sign the agreement for me when she comes?

1222
01:01:24,084 --> 01:01:26,226
If I run into her...

1223
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:28,450
Things will get a little awkward.

1224
01:01:48,375 --> 01:01:49,575
Hey, Ro Na.

1225
01:01:49,917 --> 01:01:51,726
Looks like you'll have to skip lunch

1226
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:52,852
starting tomorrow

1227
01:01:52,876 --> 01:01:54,060
to fulfil your volunteer hours.

1228
01:01:54,084 --> 01:01:57,018
Also, come to school an hour early

1229
01:01:57,042 --> 01:01:58,617
and go home an hour late.

1230
01:01:59,042 --> 01:02:00,368
I'll be watching you.

1231
01:02:01,001 --> 01:02:02,284
And don't forget

1232
01:02:03,042 --> 01:02:05,700
to separate all the recyclables.

1233
01:02:14,126 --> 01:02:15,533
Ro Na.

1234
01:02:16,126 --> 01:02:18,326
I told you to separate the recyclables.

1235
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:21,305
Remove the stickers on the bottles.

1236
01:02:22,663 --> 01:02:25,627
"Min Seol A, die! Get lost! You stink."

1237
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:30,159
Hey, look at her face.

1238
01:02:30,333 --> 01:02:31,685
Who did this?

1239
01:02:31,709 --> 01:02:33,928
I heard you live in Bosong Village.

1240
01:02:34,126 --> 01:02:37,163
Gosh, that's not the point.

1241
01:02:37,459 --> 01:02:40,475
She lives where Min Seol A used to live.

1242
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:42,226
That is so creepy. Is that really true?

1243
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:43,931
You're really something.

1244
01:02:44,168 --> 01:02:46,825
See? She can't deny it. It's true.

1245
01:02:46,959 --> 01:02:48,435
Wait, does that mean

1246
01:02:48,459 --> 01:02:50,518
she stole Min Seol A's spot here

1247
01:02:50,542 --> 01:02:52,201
as well as her place?

1248
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:54,144
That's unbelievable.

1249
01:02:54,168 --> 01:02:55,102
I guess her brain

1250
01:02:55,126 --> 01:02:56,684
is just wired differently.

1251
01:02:56,709 --> 01:03:00,617
Maybe your mum really killed Min Seol A.

1252
01:03:01,042 --> 01:03:02,284
Bingo!

1253
01:03:02,459 --> 01:03:04,476
Ro Na killed Min Seol A.

1254
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:06,726
She has something to do with Min Seol A.

1255
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:08,034
I'm getting goosebumps. - Hey.

1256
01:03:08,209 --> 01:03:09,450
Get lost.

1257
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:12,409
I'm embarrassed that you're my classmate.

1258
01:03:13,542 --> 01:03:14,825
I agree. - Totally.

1259
01:03:15,542 --> 01:03:16,659
Hey.

1260
01:03:19,042 --> 01:03:20,617
What did I just hear?

1261
01:03:20,917 --> 01:03:21,893
Did you really move

1262
01:03:21,917 --> 01:03:23,326
to Min Seol A's old place?

1263
01:03:24,542 --> 01:03:25,742
Ro Na.

1264
01:03:26,084 --> 01:03:28,368
We asked you if it's true!

1265
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:33,784
Where are you going, Ro Na?

1266
01:03:36,542 --> 01:03:37,768
Are you trying to run away?

1267
01:03:37,792 --> 01:03:39,201
You're such a coward.

1268
01:03:39,625 --> 01:03:42,950
You never belonged here to begin with.

1269
01:03:43,042 --> 01:03:44,893
Go away! - Don't come near us again.

1270
01:03:44,917 --> 01:03:46,102
You beggar! - Die!

1271
01:03:46,126 --> 01:03:47,617
Get a taste of this!

1272
01:03:49,417 --> 01:03:50,992
Gosh, look at you!

1273
01:03:51,625 --> 01:03:54,825
Where are you off to? You beggar!

1274
01:03:58,417 --> 01:04:00,533
You guys are even worse!

1275
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:06,533
Hey!

1276
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:12,700
Oh, no. - Gosh!

1277
01:04:12,792 --> 01:04:13,726
I'm sorry.

1278
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:15,867
Sir! - We didn't do it on purpose.

1279
01:04:16,168 --> 01:04:17,393
Sorry! - Still...

1280
01:04:17,417 --> 01:04:18,435
I told you. - What is this?

1281
01:04:18,459 --> 01:04:20,242
Get back to work. - Apologise to her.

1282
01:04:20,292 --> 01:04:21,742
Gosh. - My apologies.

1283
01:04:22,084 --> 01:04:23,368
Darn it! - Get back to work.

1284
01:04:23,792 --> 01:04:25,450
I can't believe this.

1285
01:04:26,168 --> 01:04:27,700
Gosh.

1286
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:29,893
What's taking her so long?

1287
01:04:29,917 --> 01:04:32,076
They'll announce the plan this afternoon.

1288
01:04:38,876 --> 01:04:40,076
My gosh.

1289
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:42,226
Ma'am! - Yes?

1290
01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:44,144
I'll push from behind. Keep pulling, okay?

1291
01:04:44,168 --> 01:04:45,688
Okay, thank you. - Let's go.

1292
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:49,076
Gosh.

1293
01:04:52,837 --> 01:04:54,037
Oh, gosh.

1294
01:04:55,126 --> 01:04:56,226
Darn it!

1295
01:04:56,250 --> 01:04:58,060
What's wrong? - Don't mind me.

1296
01:04:58,084 --> 01:05:00,243
I'll be here. Please don't mind me.

1297
01:05:01,081 --> 01:05:02,184
Hello.

1298
01:05:02,333 --> 01:05:03,435
Oh, hello. - Hi.

1299
01:05:03,459 --> 01:05:04,476
I'm sorry I'm late.

1300
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:06,143
Have a seat here. - Thank you.

1301
01:05:06,168 --> 01:05:07,559
Someone dumped water on me

1302
01:05:07,584 --> 01:05:09,253
on my way here.

1303
01:05:09,626 --> 01:05:11,184
Gosh, I'm out of breath.

1304
01:05:11,209 --> 01:05:12,601
Oh, thank you. - First,

1305
01:05:12,625 --> 01:05:15,078
just stamp your seal on that darn thing.

1306
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:16,492
Well...

1307
01:05:17,042 --> 01:05:18,950
The person who wants to buy the place

1308
01:05:19,209 --> 01:05:20,409
had to leave

1309
01:05:20,709 --> 01:05:22,402
because something came up.

1310
01:05:22,542 --> 01:05:23,476
What?

1311
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:26,492
But he left the down payment here,

1312
01:05:26,584 --> 01:05:28,475
and he's already filled out the agreement.

1313
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:30,778
So you just need to stamp your seal now.

1314
01:05:30,803 --> 01:05:32,128
I see.

1315
01:05:32,667 --> 01:05:34,446
Let me get my seal.

1316
01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:38,934
Where's my seal? - Oh boy.

1317
01:05:38,959 --> 01:05:41,159
I'm so out of breath. - It's okay.

1318
01:05:43,345 --> 01:05:44,517
Here, right?

1319
01:05:44,542 --> 01:05:46,046
Yes, right here. - Okay.

1320
01:05:46,488 --> 01:05:48,475
Hurry up, will you?

1321
01:05:48,653 --> 01:05:50,812
She's driving me crazy.

1322
01:06:13,834 --> 01:06:15,226
We have some breaking news.

1323
01:06:15,250 --> 01:06:17,476
The government has announced

1324
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:19,102
its plan to redevelop

1325
01:06:19,126 --> 01:06:20,518
the entire Bosong Village.

1326
01:06:20,542 --> 01:06:21,935
This long-awaited redevelopment project

1327
01:06:21,959 --> 01:06:23,393
had fallen through several times,

1328
01:06:23,417 --> 01:06:26,018
so this announcement

1329
01:06:26,042 --> 01:06:27,893
is making everyone in the construction

1330
01:06:27,917 --> 01:06:29,742
and real estate industry excited.

1331
01:06:30,459 --> 01:06:32,185
This large-scale redevelopment

1332
01:06:32,209 --> 01:06:34,102
will turn Bosong Village into

1333
01:06:34,126 --> 01:06:35,935
a convenient community and Seoul's

1334
01:06:35,959 --> 01:06:39,284
cultural and educational Mecca.

1335
01:06:39,417 --> 01:06:40,643
Due to this announcement...

1336
01:06:40,667 --> 01:06:42,102
Ro Na. - it's expected

1337
01:06:42,126 --> 01:06:43,476
that a fierce competition...

1338
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,242
We made it. - is ahead...

1339
01:06:46,084 --> 01:06:47,768
The projection for...

1340
01:06:47,792 --> 01:06:49,950
We made it!

1341
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:55,659
Sir!

1342
01:06:56,001 --> 01:06:57,726
I'm rich now!

1343
01:06:57,750 --> 01:06:59,992
I'm rich now!

1344
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:03,117
Ouch! - Darn it.

1345
01:07:06,333 --> 01:07:07,742
Gosh! - Hey!

1346
01:07:08,168 --> 01:07:09,268
Come at me.

1347
01:07:09,292 --> 01:07:10,768
What's stopping you? Are you scared?

1348
01:07:10,792 --> 01:07:11,935
Come at me!

1349
01:07:11,959 --> 01:07:14,242
What is wrong with her? - Hey!

1350
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:16,284
Hey! - Get her!

1351
01:07:18,834 --> 01:07:20,825
Gosh! - My goodness.

1352
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:22,059
That's right.

1353
01:07:22,209 --> 01:07:23,742
I live where Min Seol A used to live.

1354
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:25,476
What's wrong with that?

1355
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:27,685
Does it affect any of you?

1356
01:07:27,709 --> 01:07:30,201
What did you guys do to Min Seol A?

1357
01:07:30,667 --> 01:07:32,825
Did she die because you guys bullied her?

1358
01:07:33,084 --> 01:07:35,201
Do you want me to die like she did?

1359
01:07:36,542 --> 01:07:38,393
You know what?

1360
01:07:38,417 --> 01:07:40,242
I will not die like she did.

1361
01:07:40,584 --> 01:07:41,726
I'll tell the whole world

1362
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:42,935
about what you did to me

1363
01:07:42,959 --> 01:07:45,351
and make sure you get punished.

1364
01:07:45,375 --> 01:07:46,601
You little... - How dare you.

1365
01:07:46,625 --> 01:07:47,992
Gosh! - Hey!

1366
01:08:22,459 --> 01:08:25,159
=Penthouse=

1367
01:08:25,209 --> 01:08:26,685
That obnoxious witch

1368
01:08:26,709 --> 01:08:28,768
is going to become rich?

1369
01:08:28,792 --> 01:08:30,102
Who are you? - Me?

1370
01:08:30,126 --> 01:08:31,144
I'm your teacher.

1371
01:08:31,168 --> 01:08:32,226
Thank you in advance

1372
01:08:32,250 --> 01:08:33,935
for all your help and guidance.

1373
01:08:33,959 --> 01:08:36,185
What do you want?

1374
01:08:36,209 --> 01:08:38,518
Don't ask. Don't even be curious.

1375
01:08:38,542 --> 01:08:39,685
Yoon Hee.

1376
01:08:39,709 --> 01:08:41,643
Don't hate me too much.

1377
01:08:41,667 --> 01:08:42,935
What about Hera Palace? - What?

1378
01:08:42,959 --> 01:08:44,393
I told you that a mother should be

1379
01:08:44,417 --> 01:08:46,018
willing to do anything for her child.

1380
01:08:46,042 --> 01:08:48,268
Min Seol A died at Hera Palace.

1381
01:08:48,292 --> 01:08:51,117
I met Min Seol A at Hera Palace.

1382
01:08:51,142 --> 01:08:53,326
What if she's still alive?

1383
01:08:53,888 --> 01:08:57,673
"Until next time..."
