Are you Chairman Joo Dan Tae?

7
00:00:47,876 --> 00:00:49,083
You're under arrest

8
00:00:49,167 --> 00:00:51,208
for embezzlement, investment fraud,

9
00:00:51,292 --> 00:00:52,333
and violation of the Capital Markets Act.

10
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:53,500
Cuff him.

11
00:00:53,584 --> 00:00:54,500
What? - Fraud?

12
00:00:55,667 --> 00:00:56,584
What? - What is happening?

13
00:00:56,667 --> 00:00:57,625
What are you doing? - Fraud?

14
00:00:57,792 --> 00:00:59,542
Embezzlement? Why would I do that?

15
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:01,667
I have never broken the law.

16
00:01:01,792 --> 00:01:02,625
Take him.

17
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:03,834
Who sent you guys?

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,167
Who ordered you to do this?

19
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,958
You're making a big mistake!

20
00:01:07,292 --> 00:01:08,167
Wait!

21
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,292
Chairman Joo! What is this all about?

22
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:11,417
What investment fraud?

23
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,792
Attorney Lee, go look into it right away.

24
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:14,417
Go get dozens of lawyers if you must.

25
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,333
Hurry.

26
00:01:15,834 --> 00:01:16,958
I didn't do anything!

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,876
Chairman Joo.

28
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:18,792
Dr. Ha.

29
00:01:18,876 --> 00:01:20,167
Where did Dr. Ha go?

30
00:01:29,917 --> 00:01:30,876
No.

31
00:01:31,417 --> 00:01:32,542
Could it be Soo Ryeon?

32
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:40,041
Mum.

33
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:54,958
What's the evidence?

34
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:56,792
On what grounds are you arresting me?

35
00:01:56,876 --> 00:01:58,083
You used Logan Lee's name

36
00:01:58,167 --> 00:01:59,834
and gave the investors false information

37
00:01:59,917 --> 00:02:01,083
to secure investments.

38
00:02:01,167 --> 00:02:02,917
What do you mean I used Logan Lee's name?

39
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:04,876
He's my business partner in this project.

40
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,625
Call Logan Lee now.

41
00:02:06,792 --> 00:02:08,458
You can ask him directly!

42
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,792
Were you looking for me?

43
00:02:12,584 --> 00:02:13,458
Logan.

44
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:14,709
Logan!

45
00:02:15,417 --> 00:02:16,333
I'm so glad you're here.

46
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,917
Seems like there's a misunderstanding.

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,958
Sort out this ridiculous situation.

48
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:26,250
You still don't get it now, Mr. Joo?

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,083
I'm the one who reported you,

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Mr. Joo Dan Tae.

51
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:35,834
What...

52
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:37,208
What did you say?

53
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,167
I said,

54
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:41,250
I'm the one who reported you.

55
00:02:44,292 --> 00:02:45,417
I heard you used my name

56
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,917
to secure investments.

57
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,208
You can

58
00:02:48,876 --> 00:02:50,542
speak Korean?

59
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:52,333
I want him to be

60
00:02:52,417 --> 00:02:53,667
punished severely according to the law.

61
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:56,917
I was never involved with him

62
00:02:57,667 --> 00:02:59,709
in any kind of business.

63
00:02:59,792 --> 00:03:00,876
No.

64
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,792
Logan. Hey, Logan.

65
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:04,958
We already signed the contract.

66
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,667
I put my Myeong-dong land as collateral,

67
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,125
then we're going to build a casino...

68
00:03:09,167 --> 00:03:10,167
Maybe this

69
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:11,958
could be used as an answer.

70
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:14,876
What is this?

71
00:03:15,542 --> 00:03:16,458
It's...

72
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,500
I'll see if you'll end up holding me back

73
00:03:20,917 --> 00:03:22,667
or dragging me down.

74
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,625
Or grabbing you in the neck.

75
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:28,584
This is...

76
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,041
Didn't I tell you

77
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,709
that I might grab you in the neck?

78
00:03:36,792 --> 00:03:38,208
You jerk!

79
00:03:38,417 --> 00:03:39,375
Let me go.

80
00:03:39,792 --> 00:03:40,667
Arrest him.

81
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,750
Arrest that jerk.

82
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:43,083
He's the fraud.

83
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:44,584
That jerk is the con man!

84
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,584
Let me go. Gu Ho Dong! You!

85
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:47,625
Chairman Joo. - Get that jerk.

86
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:49,083
Don't say anything for now. - Let me go!

87
00:03:49,167 --> 00:03:50,917
Gu Ho Dong. I'll just... - Remain silent!

88
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,292
You jerk. Hey, you jerk!

89
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,667
Let me go. He's the fraud

90
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,917
That little... - Stay silent!

91
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,333
You need to arrest him.

92
00:03:57,709 --> 00:03:58,958
Gu Ho Dong!

93
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,750
I'm sorry I called you out of the blue.

94
00:04:04,417 --> 00:04:06,125
You're the only one I could ask for help.

95
00:04:06,542 --> 00:04:07,834
I never even imagined

96
00:04:07,917 --> 00:04:09,500
you'd ask me for a favour.

97
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,584
I thought you were living a good life.

98
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,792
How did you go through all this?

99
00:04:14,876 --> 00:04:16,876
I've been living with a monster.

100
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,417
I'm sorry I called you over this.

101
00:04:21,667 --> 00:04:23,167
I stuck around at your place

102
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,083
for five years to finish my studies.

103
00:04:25,542 --> 00:04:26,917
And you paid my tuition too.

104
00:04:29,292 --> 00:04:31,958
I'm glad I can pay you back like this.

105
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,834
Thank you.

106
00:04:37,542 --> 00:04:38,958
What suddenly brings you

107
00:04:39,584 --> 00:04:40,667
all the way here at the TV station?

108
00:04:41,667 --> 00:04:42,792
I was waiting for you.

109
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:45,250
I had to tell you something in a hurry.

110
00:04:45,792 --> 00:04:47,292
Soo Ryeon, by any chance, do you know

111
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,041
Mr. Jung Doo Man of Happy Future Party?

112
00:04:49,292 --> 00:04:50,167
No.

113
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,792
I've never even met him.

114
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,250
I knew it.

115
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,667
There's a rumour going around

116
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,792
about the relationship between you two

117
00:04:58,167 --> 00:05:00,333
in the political and the financial world.

118
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,792
What do you mean?

119
00:05:02,292 --> 00:05:03,584
Why would I be involved with him?

120
00:05:03,667 --> 00:05:04,667
And today,

121
00:05:04,917 --> 00:05:06,041
I finally found out why.

122
00:05:07,417 --> 00:05:08,458
You asked me to find Seok Hoon

123
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:09,584
and Seok Kyung's biological mum.

124
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,041
And did you?

125
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,667
I opened up Joo Dan Tae's vault today

126
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,458
and found this photo.

127
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:17,333
Don't be shocked.

128
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,000
This woman is

129
00:05:21,542 --> 00:05:23,292
the biological mother of the twins.

130
00:05:24,709 --> 00:05:25,709
I can't believe this.

131
00:05:27,709 --> 00:05:28,834
How can this be?

132
00:05:31,417 --> 00:05:32,792
Where is she right now?

133
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,375
You're watching "Reporter Kim's Eye."

134
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:37,625
Chairman Joo of JKING Holdings,

135
00:05:37,709 --> 00:05:39,917
the biggest investment firm in Korea,

136
00:05:40,292 --> 00:05:41,667
has been arrested for embezzlement,

137
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,667
malpractice, and investment fraud.

138
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:45,167
He brought in a huge amount of investments

139
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,958
by using his casino business as a bait

140
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,000
to raise his company's stock price.

141
00:05:49,167 --> 00:05:50,542
Seoul Prosecutors' Office has begun

142
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,958
a search and seizure process

143
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:54,167
of his office in Yeoksam-dong,

144
00:05:54,417 --> 00:05:55,250
as well as summoning

145
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,458
all related people as witnesses.

146
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,500
On tonight's "Reporter Kim's Eye",

147
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:01,750
we'll take a closer look into this case.

148
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,709
A video of their extramarital affair

149
00:06:03,792 --> 00:06:05,458
between Chief Director Cheon of Cheonga

150
00:06:05,542 --> 00:06:06,876
and Chairman Joo of JKING Holdings

151
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,792
went viral. - They played hard.

152
00:06:08,876 --> 00:06:09,917
In the video, the two are...

153
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:10,917
Chief Kang.

154
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:12,125
Are you sure there's no way

155
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,083
to save Chairman Joo?

156
00:06:13,584 --> 00:06:15,167
Is he getting arrested?

157
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,876
Then what about my land in Myeong-dong?

158
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,083
It's as good as toilet paper

159
00:06:19,167 --> 00:06:21,083
once the owner gets arrested.

160
00:06:21,292 --> 00:06:23,000
Hurry up before it goes any lower.

161
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,333
On the other hand, Chief Director Cheon

162
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:25,292
of Cheonga Foundation is

163
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,375
also undergoing investigation

164
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:27,792
for forging grades and rigged admission.

165
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,250
No!

166
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,250
This can't be true!

167
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:34,458
Eun Byeol.

168
00:06:34,542 --> 00:06:36,958
No! - An anonymous informer demanded

169
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,417
a reinvestigation for a mysterious death

170
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,167
of Min, the student who was admitted

171
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,542
to Cheonga Arts High in 2020 as the top.

172
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,333
According to the information,

173
00:06:45,417 --> 00:06:47,208
Min was bullied by a group of students

174
00:06:47,292 --> 00:06:49,083
who were also admitted to Cheonga High,

175
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,792
and she suffered from serious assault

176
00:06:50,876 --> 00:06:52,167
even before attending the school.

177
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:54,375
What's noteworthy is that the assailants

178
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:55,792
are all residents of Hera Palace,

179
00:06:55,876 --> 00:06:58,333
the symbol of wealth in Gangnam.

180
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:00,958
The so-called Little Hera Club

181
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:02,584
has been abusing their absolute power

182
00:07:02,667 --> 00:07:04,208
in every aspect of their school life,

183
00:07:04,292 --> 00:07:05,417
receiving special treatment. - What if

184
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,375
I get kicked out of school, Mum?

185
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:07,625
Ms. Cheon helped me

186
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:09,000
get in too. - These minors used

187
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,208
Don't worry. - their parents' power

188
00:07:10,292 --> 00:07:12,167
I'm here for you. - to abuse others,

189
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,458
turning this case into a modern...

190
00:07:14,542 --> 00:07:15,417
One second.

191
00:07:15,584 --> 00:07:16,584
Hey, wait a moment.

192
00:07:16,667 --> 00:07:19,167
What are you doing? - Let her go!

193
00:07:19,292 --> 00:07:21,041
Hey! - Mum, wait for me!

194
00:07:21,292 --> 00:07:22,250
Let me go!

195
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,500
Let go of me! - Let me go!

196
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:26,542
Will you let me go?

197
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,542
Honey!

198
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:29,584
I'll go. - Darn it!

199
00:07:29,667 --> 00:07:31,000
Let me go! - I'll walk myself.

200
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,125
Hey! Let me go!

201
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:33,208
Let her go!

202
00:07:37,876 --> 00:07:38,792
Mum...

203
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:39,834
Mum.

204
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,250
Dad...

205
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:44,333
Oh, no.

206
00:07:44,834 --> 00:07:47,083
Dad...

207
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:50,584
Dad...

208
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:58,876
"JKING Holdings"

209
00:08:01,834 --> 00:08:02,792
What about the chairman?

210
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:04,208
What happened to him?

211
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,709
The investigation will take a while.

212
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:06,876
All of the secret ledgers were

213
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,000
also confiscated,

214
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,167
so there's absolutely nothing we can do.

215
00:08:11,834 --> 00:08:13,834
I should've done something to stop this.

216
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,167
Everyone at Hera Club was

217
00:08:17,417 --> 00:08:18,876
all arrested as well.

218
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,709
It seems like they'll investigate

219
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:21,958
Min Seol A's death too.

220
00:08:22,876 --> 00:08:24,542
The police barged into Hera Palace

221
00:08:24,876 --> 00:08:25,958
and turned it upside down.

222
00:08:26,917 --> 00:08:27,958
The police?

223
00:08:30,917 --> 00:08:31,876
Ro Na.

224
00:08:32,292 --> 00:08:33,167
What about Ro Na?

225
00:08:43,542 --> 00:08:45,958
The police are currently investigating

226
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,500
Min's death at Hera Palace.

227
00:08:47,709 --> 00:08:48,834
They're narrowing down the suspects

228
00:08:48,917 --> 00:08:50,125
among the people who went in

229
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,958
and out of Hera Palace on that day.

230
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,208
The police will put their focus on finding

231
00:08:54,292 --> 00:08:56,083
anyone - Is this how everything ends?

232
00:08:56,417 --> 00:08:58,208
who met her right before her death

233
00:08:58,292 --> 00:08:59,834
to find out her whereabouts before death.

234
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:02,417
They'll turn this into a murder case...

235
00:09:05,584 --> 00:09:06,958
I was obviously - I was obviously

236
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,958
stating a lie - stating a lie

237
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,584
out of pressure. - out of pressure.

238
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:11,750
I mean, think about it

239
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:13,500
and say something.

240
00:09:13,584 --> 00:09:16,167
Why are we getting questioned here?

241
00:09:16,292 --> 00:09:18,958
Sim Soo Ryeon planned everything to make

242
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,292
the divorce more favourable for her.

243
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,917
The penthouse couple were

244
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,083
preparing for their divorce suit.

245
00:09:24,584 --> 00:09:26,750
In the end, a divorce is all about money.

246
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:29,250
And this family is filthy rich,

247
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:30,958
so Soo Ryeon was desperate

248
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:34,667
to find her husband's weaknesses.

249
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,834
I mean, how desperate was she

250
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:39,208
to lock us up and threaten us like that?

251
00:09:39,292 --> 00:09:41,041
We needed to save our lives.

252
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,958
We had to give her the answer she wanted.

253
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,250
Don't you think so?

254
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,834
And Soo Ryeon is - This is nonsense.

255
00:09:45,917 --> 00:09:47,250
actually out of her mind. - Why am I here?

256
00:09:47,584 --> 00:09:48,792
Does she have any evidence

257
00:09:48,917 --> 00:09:50,917
that the dead girl is her daughter?

258
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,834
You're under suspicion of

259
00:09:53,917 --> 00:09:55,958
years of rigged admission and bribery.

260
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,250
Do you have anything to say?

261
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,167
Mr. Prosecutor.

262
00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:02,167
I'm very rich.

263
00:10:02,584 --> 00:10:03,625
If I used 100 million won a month

264
00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:04,542
until the day I die,

265
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,041
I'd still have some left.

266
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,167
And you're saying

267
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,125
I got someone admitted

268
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,792
without any talent over some money?

269
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:14,167
My pride will not condone that.

270
00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:18,250
I wonder who this whistle-blower is.

271
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:20,709
Was it Gu Ho Dong?

272
00:10:20,917 --> 00:10:21,958
I cannot confirm that for you.

273
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:23,792
He's the only one

274
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,625
who'd bring up such nonsense.

275
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:27,709
But that man is a fraud

276
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,167
who forged his identity

277
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,958
to get a job at the school.

278
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,125
He's trying to hurt my foundation

279
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,041
under his fake name, Gu Ho Dong.

280
00:10:35,292 --> 00:10:36,584
How will you explain the rigged admission

281
00:10:36,667 --> 00:10:37,958
involving your daughter?

282
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,584
We already have a video of her audition

283
00:10:39,667 --> 00:10:41,292
and the original evaluations.

284
00:10:41,876 --> 00:10:43,750
We also have the file you forged yourself

285
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,417
as evidence to prove this.

286
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,917
"Cam 1"

287
00:10:53,834 --> 00:10:55,083
"Cam 3"

288
00:10:58,709 --> 00:10:59,750
Are you

289
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,709
calling this a rigged admission?

290
00:11:03,542 --> 00:11:05,000
Our vocal music department

291
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:07,458
admits students with potential.

292
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:08,958
We listen to the tone of their voice

293
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:10,584
and admit students who have

294
00:11:10,667 --> 00:11:12,083
a great potential in the future.

295
00:11:12,709 --> 00:11:13,834
A small mistake they make in the audition

296
00:11:13,917 --> 00:11:15,542
doesn't automatically drop them out.

297
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:17,375
Did you bring something like this to me

298
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:18,500
as evidence?

299
00:11:19,876 --> 00:11:21,667
Do you realise the scale of damage

300
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,292
you've made on our foundation?

301
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:24,417
I will

302
00:11:24,834 --> 00:11:26,834
make sure I hold you responsible.

303
00:11:27,584 --> 00:11:28,667
I'll charge you for defamation

304
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,958
and demand compensation too.

305
00:11:31,876 --> 00:11:32,834
The whole package.

306
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,167
What are you painting, Mum?

307
00:12:07,292 --> 00:12:08,667
A house I'll live later in my life.

308
00:12:09,667 --> 00:12:10,709
Isn't it pretty?

309
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:12,834
I'd rather live in an apartment.

310
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:15,292
But still, if you're moving there,

311
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:16,375
I'm going to go with you.

312
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,000
I'll live right by your side for life,

313
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:21,958
even after I get married.

314
00:12:23,292 --> 00:12:24,667
It will be tough for Mum.

315
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,709
Hey.

316
00:12:34,792 --> 00:12:36,083
Why are you here?

317
00:12:39,917 --> 00:12:41,208
How dare you come here?

318
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,208
I was worried about you two.

319
00:12:45,417 --> 00:12:46,667
You are a hypocrite.

320
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,417
If you were worried, why did you do that?

321
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,792
And you reported him, didn't you?

322
00:12:52,292 --> 00:12:53,958
Are you trying to ruin our family?

323
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,250
Are you glad that you got your revenge?

324
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:57,667
Dad is

325
00:12:58,625 --> 00:12:59,958
getting punished

326
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,167
for something he did wrong.

327
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,041
That's only fair.

328
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,500
I'm sick of hearing you saying

329
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,208
people did something wrong!

330
00:13:08,834 --> 00:13:10,250
Are we even a real family?

331
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:12,167
If we're family,

332
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,792
aren't we supposed to cover up

333
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:14,750
each other's faults?

334
00:13:15,417 --> 00:13:16,834
You only think of your biological daughter

335
00:13:16,917 --> 00:13:18,000
and don't care about us.

336
00:13:18,709 --> 00:13:20,167
We're your children too.

337
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,125
You were our mum!

338
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:25,250
Was that all a lie?

339
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,500
No.

340
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,625
No, that wasn't a lie.

341
00:13:28,917 --> 00:13:29,876
I swear

342
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,458
there wasn't a moment

343
00:13:31,542 --> 00:13:32,667
I didn't think of you two as my own.

344
00:13:35,584 --> 00:13:37,584
If you really thought we were family,

345
00:13:38,292 --> 00:13:39,667
you couldn't have done this.

346
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,458
I don't want to see you.

347
00:13:42,834 --> 00:13:43,834
Get out of here.

348
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,625
Get out of my house!

349
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,041
Get out!

350
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,458
Seok Kyung, pull yourself together.

351
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:52,041
You need to say something too.

352
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:53,667
Can you understand what this woman did?

353
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,000
And everything she did to us?

354
00:13:57,542 --> 00:13:58,750
Why did you come?

355
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,709
You knew she wouldn't say anything nice.

356
00:14:03,292 --> 00:14:05,083
I'm very sorry for you two.

357
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:08,417
But...

358
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,625
I had to do this.

359
00:14:12,792 --> 00:14:13,792
This was the only way for me

360
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,876
to forgive you two

361
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:18,667
and return to be with you.

362
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,542
I know it's all my fault

363
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:22,834
that you went astray.

364
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,958
I will be...

365
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:28,000
punished for that for the rest of my life.

366
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,083
I will live as your mum until I die.

367
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:39,584
Go ask

368
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,958
that dead girl to call you mum.

369
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:47,375
We need more time.

370
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,834
I'm trying hard to understand you,

371
00:14:50,917 --> 00:14:52,083
so please leave for now.

372
00:14:58,834 --> 00:15:00,167
I'll be here for them.

373
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:02,208
Please don't worry and go.

374
00:15:02,667 --> 00:15:04,958
I'll take good care of them.

375
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Thank you.

376
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,750
If anything happens to them,

377
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:13,375
please let me know.

378
00:15:14,292 --> 00:15:15,208
I'll do that.

379
00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:47,667
Ro Na.

380
00:15:48,792 --> 00:15:50,709
Ro Na? Bae Ro Na!

381
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,709
Why are you here?

382
00:15:58,958 --> 00:15:59,958
Where's Ro Na?

383
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,417
Ro Na.

384
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:12,917
Where is she?

385
00:16:13,292 --> 00:16:14,208
Wait.

386
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,667
Did you do something to her?

387
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,625
What do you think I did to her?

388
00:16:20,792 --> 00:16:21,834
Soo Ryeon!

389
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,083
If you laid a finger on her,

390
00:16:25,876 --> 00:16:27,417
I really won't let it go.

391
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,125
Then what?

392
00:16:30,667 --> 00:16:31,917
Will you kill me too?

393
00:16:33,417 --> 00:16:35,292
I guess your child is precious to you.

394
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:36,375
Tell me now.

395
00:16:36,917 --> 00:16:38,584
Where is Ro Na?

396
00:16:39,834 --> 00:16:41,375
Seol A said you were a good person,

397
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,417
and was grateful for you.

398
00:16:43,542 --> 00:16:45,167
When she was abandoned

399
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,375
by the only one she trusted,

400
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:49,333
how do you think she would have felt?

401
00:16:50,584 --> 00:16:52,417
It's a million times worse

402
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,250
than when I thought Seo Jin killed her.

403
00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:56,292
Nothing happened to Ro Na, right?

404
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,292
If something happens to her,

405
00:16:58,709 --> 00:16:59,667
my life will end too.

406
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:01,667
Just kill me instead

407
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,834
and leave her alone.

408
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,917
No.

409
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,250
You need to know how it feels to lose

410
00:17:09,167 --> 00:17:10,333
your child.

411
00:17:12,167 --> 00:17:13,584
Wouldn't it be only fair

412
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,584
for you to experience the same thing?

413
00:17:17,834 --> 00:17:18,750
Soo Ryeon.

414
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,041
It's all my fault.

415
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:22,667
I did this,

416
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:24,834
so please let Ro Na live.

417
00:17:25,292 --> 00:17:26,958
She's done nothing wrong.

418
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:29,292
Not Ro Na.

419
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,000
She's my life, Soo Ryeon.

420
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,876
Back then, I must have let alcohol

421
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,125
take hold of my sanity.

422
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,792
I was out of my mind.

423
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,958
That day when you told me

424
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,167
Seol A was your daughter,

425
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,834
that's when I remembered everything.

426
00:17:44,917 --> 00:17:46,125
I also couldn't believe

427
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:48,208
I did something like that.

428
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:51,292
I'm serious. Please believe me.

429
00:17:54,667 --> 00:17:55,625
Turn yourself in.

430
00:17:58,458 --> 00:17:59,292
What?

431
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:00,500
Admit to what you did

432
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:01,917
and pay for your crime.

433
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:03,000
Then what about Ro Na?

434
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,250
Are you asking me to let her live

435
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:07,417
as a murderer's daughter?

436
00:18:08,834 --> 00:18:10,542
No, I can't.

437
00:18:10,667 --> 00:18:12,458
Ro Na wouldn't be able to live.

438
00:18:12,584 --> 00:18:15,542
You already know what she's like.

439
00:18:16,167 --> 00:18:18,000
So why did you do that?

440
00:18:19,584 --> 00:18:21,208
Why did you do something you can't undo?

441
00:18:21,292 --> 00:18:22,792
What does Cheonga Arts High mean anyway?

442
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,000
Soo Ryeon.

443
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:25,958
Seol A is already dead.

444
00:18:26,584 --> 00:18:28,083
Those who are alive should move on.

445
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,250
I'll be

446
00:18:29,834 --> 00:18:30,876
really good to you.

447
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,333
I'll live the rest of my life

448
00:18:32,584 --> 00:18:34,167
atoning for what I did to her.

449
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,584
Please, Soo Ryeon.

450
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:39,250
Is life important only for the rest of us?

451
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,250
So you want to cover it up and end this?

452
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,458
Is that why

453
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,917
you took Joo Dan Tae's hand?

454
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:47,625
How could you betray me?

455
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:48,667
How?

456
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,375
I will reveal

457
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,292
the whole truth.

458
00:19:00,917 --> 00:19:01,917
I'll let Seol A know

459
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,375
that she had

460
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,458
a mum.

461
00:19:08,709 --> 00:19:09,625
Soo Ryeon.

462
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:10,958
No, please.

463
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:12,709
Please, I beg you.

464
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:14,458
Please don't let Ro Na find out.

465
00:19:14,667 --> 00:19:15,958
Please, I beg you.

466
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,709
Please give me some time.

467
00:19:18,917 --> 00:19:20,083
Let me send her abroad

468
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:21,834
so that she won't find out.

469
00:19:22,667 --> 00:19:24,458
Then I'll turn myself in as you said.

470
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:26,083
I mean it. Please.

471
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,500
Please, Soo Ryeon.

472
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:28,709
Please, I beg you.

473
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:31,500
Ms. Sim, I got the ice cream.

474
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:36,584
Mum.

475
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,500
What are you doing?

476
00:19:38,917 --> 00:19:39,834
Ro Na.

477
00:19:41,876 --> 00:19:43,000
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

478
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:44,417
I was worried sick.

479
00:19:44,834 --> 00:19:46,167
I left my phone at home.

480
00:19:46,792 --> 00:19:48,125
Mum, what's going on?

481
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,792
Can't you tell me?

482
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:51,876
No, it's nothing.

483
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,375
Go in and get some rest.

484
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:54,500
I'll tell her.

485
00:19:57,584 --> 00:19:59,667
She's having a tough time telling you.

486
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,625
Soo Ryeon!

487
00:20:02,667 --> 00:20:03,584
Please stop.

488
00:20:03,876 --> 00:20:04,876
I get it.

489
00:20:05,709 --> 00:20:06,958
I'll do as you say tomorrow.

490
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:08,375
So please.

491
00:20:08,584 --> 00:20:09,584
Please stop.

492
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,208
Please stop here.

493
00:20:11,792 --> 00:20:12,750
Make sure

494
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:14,958
you keep your promise.

495
00:20:20,292 --> 00:20:21,584
I'll see you later.

496
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,876
Mum, are you okay?

497
00:20:31,584 --> 00:20:32,500
Yes.

498
00:20:33,917 --> 00:20:35,417
I'm just a little dizzy.

499
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:38,709
I need to get some rest.

500
00:20:41,417 --> 00:20:42,417
Oh, Mum.

501
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,041
Did you watch the news?

502
00:20:44,667 --> 00:20:46,125
Hera Palace is in a huge mess.

503
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:47,958
Do you remember Min Seol A?

504
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,041
She was the top student.

505
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,709
That girl died

506
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:53,876
here at Hera Palace.

507
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:56,041
She may not have killed herself.

508
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:57,292
She might've been murdered.

509
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:00,667
What on earth is going on right now?

510
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,208
We lived at her place for a short while.

511
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,584
Mr. Joo of the penthouse, Ms. Cheon,

512
00:21:06,792 --> 00:21:08,417
and Je Ni and Min Hyuk's parents are

513
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:10,834
all getting questioned by the police.

514
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:16,667
I'm going to my room.

What am I going to do, Ro Na?

516
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,041
Once I turn myself in,

517
00:21:31,167 --> 00:21:32,292
the whole world will come after us

518

and try to kill us.

but she's at the prosecutor's office.

Is she going to get kicked out now?

with a golf bag on that day.

How much longer do you have to do this?

544

No.

00:30:53,592 --> 00:30:54,800
That's my everything!

688
00:30:56,217 --> 00:30:58,092
You're still concerned of your position?

689
00:30:59,967 --> 00:31:01,341
Is that why you're holding onto it

690
00:31:01,425 --> 00:31:02,717
as you watch your daughter die?

691
00:31:03,508 --> 00:31:04,884
Is your ambition and greed

692
00:31:04,967 --> 00:31:06,258
more precious than your kid?

693
00:31:06,383 --> 00:31:07,800
Stop saying whatever you want.

694
00:31:07,925 --> 00:31:09,383
What do you think you know?

695
00:31:12,176 --> 00:31:13,592
You need to wake up

696
00:31:13,884 --> 00:31:15,050
if you want to save your kid.

697
00:31:15,967 --> 00:31:17,050
You're a mum too.

698
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:18,633
For you

699
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:20,134
and for Eun Byeol,

700
00:31:20,425 --> 00:31:21,383
give up everything

701
00:31:21,467 --> 00:31:22,383
and pay for what you did.

702
00:31:23,925 --> 00:31:25,425
Before then, I couldn't care less

703
00:31:27,258 --> 00:31:28,341
about Eun Byeol's pain.

704
00:31:47,176 --> 00:31:48,092
Fine.

705
00:31:48,967 --> 00:31:50,009
Go ahead.

706
00:31:50,884 --> 00:31:52,425
Let's take this to the end.

707
00:31:54,092 --> 00:31:56,383
I won't sit around and take this.

708
00:32:00,258 --> 00:32:01,217
Really?

709
00:32:02,467 --> 00:32:03,467
Right.

710
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:05,425
I almost forgot.

711
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:07,675
I exposed

712
00:32:07,758 --> 00:32:09,467
that video of you and Dan Tae's affair

713
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:10,425
a little too late.

714
00:32:11,383 --> 00:32:12,425
I apologise.

715
00:32:14,217 --> 00:32:15,134
What?

716
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,009
Things are already over between you two.

717
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,884
I wasn't considerate.

718
00:32:22,758 --> 00:32:23,717
You didn't know?

719
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:27,467
He's already head over heels for Yoon Hee.

720
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:31,092
Nonsense.

721
00:32:32,092 --> 00:32:33,383
What could Dan Tae ever see

722
00:32:33,467 --> 00:32:34,592
in a girl like Yoon Hee?

723
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,176
I'm not going to let you fool me.

724
00:32:37,341 --> 00:32:38,842
Do you still trust him?

725
00:32:40,592 --> 00:32:41,842
Then go check for yourself.

726
00:32:43,758 --> 00:32:45,383
Did you do that to Eun Byeol

727
00:32:45,925 --> 00:32:47,383
over a man like him?

728
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,425
What a pity, Seo Jin.

729
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:15,258
Get rid of

730
00:33:17,925 --> 00:33:18,884
Sim Soo Ryeon.

731
00:33:20,675 --> 00:33:22,176
What did you just say?

732
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:24,050
Are you asking me

733
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,508
to kill Soo Ryeon?

734
00:33:26,884 --> 00:33:28,134
Soo Ryeon isn't

735
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:31,800
as easy as you think she is.

736
00:33:32,467 --> 00:33:35,176
No, she already has too much power.

737
00:33:35,341 --> 00:33:36,633
What do you mean?

738
00:33:36,717 --> 00:33:38,092
Her helper was

739
00:33:38,467 --> 00:33:39,425
Logan Lee.

740
00:33:40,341 --> 00:33:42,258
She's working with Logan.

741
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,800
I saw them with my own eyes.

742
00:33:43,884 --> 00:33:44,884
I know that already.

743
00:33:45,633 --> 00:33:46,967
He's the one who reported me.

744
00:33:47,842 --> 00:33:49,009
It's infuriating

745
00:33:49,092 --> 00:33:50,717
that I found out a little too late.

746
00:33:51,134 --> 00:33:52,134
If you know that,

747
00:33:52,758 --> 00:33:54,050
will you let her go on?

748
00:33:55,258 --> 00:33:56,467
Soo Ryeon is

749
00:33:57,758 --> 00:33:59,009
a frightening woman.

750
00:33:59,341 --> 00:34:01,092
She won't back out of this fight easily!

751
00:34:01,176 --> 00:34:02,633
You have to stop her now. If you don't,

752
00:34:03,884 --> 00:34:05,258
both you and I

753
00:34:05,842 --> 00:34:06,925
will die.

754
00:34:09,508 --> 00:34:10,425
But

755
00:34:11,425 --> 00:34:12,341
why?

756
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:14,592
Why do you

757
00:34:15,217 --> 00:34:17,050
want to kill her this badly?

758
00:34:18,009 --> 00:34:18,967
I'm curious.

759
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:22,009
It's because...

760
00:34:27,176 --> 00:34:28,842
she knows everything

761
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:30,009
about us.

762
00:34:30,967 --> 00:34:32,341
And that I've been helping you.

763
00:34:32,425 --> 00:34:33,467
She knows everything.

764
00:34:34,092 --> 00:34:35,425
We can't go back now.

765
00:34:36,383 --> 00:34:38,050
She's out of her mind right now,

766
00:34:38,134 --> 00:34:39,800
and she has been threatening Ro Na too!

767
00:34:40,217 --> 00:34:41,467
She might get both of us

768
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,009
locked up for embezzlement!

769
00:34:43,217 --> 00:34:44,341
I'm not going to let them go.

770
00:34:44,967 --> 00:34:45,967
Both Soo Ryeon

771
00:34:46,633 --> 00:34:48,134
and that jerk, Logan.

772
00:34:49,717 --> 00:34:51,009
For Soo Ryeon now,

773
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:54,800
you and I are a thing.

774
00:34:56,967 --> 00:34:57,967
We are a target of her revenge.

775
00:34:58,925 --> 00:34:59,842
Her enemies.

776
00:35:01,675 --> 00:35:02,758
We can't

777
00:35:03,217 --> 00:35:04,717
go down like this.

778
00:35:08,508 --> 00:35:09,425
Don't worry.

779
00:35:10,258 --> 00:35:12,300
If you fell in danger while helping me,

780
00:35:12,925 --> 00:35:14,258
of course I should protect you.

781
00:35:15,592 --> 00:35:17,134
Let me take care of Soo Ryeon.

782
00:35:18,134 --> 00:35:19,176
It won't take long.

783
00:35:25,176 --> 00:35:26,300
Yoon Hee!

784
00:35:31,134 --> 00:35:32,092
Explain this.

785
00:35:32,258 --> 00:35:33,800
Why are you with him right now?

786
00:35:33,967 --> 00:35:34,800
Tell me!

787
00:35:34,884 --> 00:35:36,134
What were you doing with him?

788
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,092
Let me go.

789
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:38,383
What are you doing?

790
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,925
What's going on between you and him?

791
00:35:43,134 --> 00:35:44,092
Did you sleep with him?

792
00:35:44,508 --> 00:35:45,508
Did you?

793
00:35:45,884 --> 00:35:46,967
Did you sleep with him?

794
00:35:48,258 --> 00:35:49,258
Tell me in your own words.

795
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,425
Tell me!

796
00:35:50,508 --> 00:35:52,009
Take your hands off my woman.

797
00:35:55,092 --> 00:35:56,009
What?

798
00:35:59,508 --> 00:36:00,925
What did you just say?

799
00:36:01,884 --> 00:36:03,592
How can you do this to me?

800
00:36:03,675 --> 00:36:04,717
How?

801
00:36:05,758 --> 00:36:07,050
You fooled me?

802
00:36:07,675 --> 00:36:09,176
You said you aren't seeing her.

803
00:36:09,425 --> 00:36:10,675
How dare you deceive me?

804
00:36:10,925 --> 00:36:12,134
How can you?

805
00:36:12,675 --> 00:36:13,550
That's enough!

806
00:36:15,134 --> 00:36:16,633
I'm sick and tired of you.

807
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:18,842
Can you spare enough time

808
00:36:18,925 --> 00:36:19,925
to be jealous of her right now?

809
00:36:20,176 --> 00:36:21,092
If you have time to do this,

810
00:36:21,176 --> 00:36:22,341
go keep your foundation together.

811
00:36:22,425 --> 00:36:23,800
Don't be so clingy.

812
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:36,009
Joo Dan Tae.

813
00:36:36,717 --> 00:36:37,884
You scumbag!

814
00:36:38,258 --> 00:36:39,467
Stop right there!

815
00:36:55,092 --> 00:36:56,383
You!

816
00:36:57,134 --> 00:36:58,300
Get up. Let's go.

817
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:00,467
I said, I'm not going.

818
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,675
Look at the mess our family is in.

819
00:37:01,758 --> 00:37:02,717
I'm embarrassed to go to school!

820
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,884
Listen to me.

821
00:37:03,967 --> 00:37:05,217
This won't get sorted out soon.

822
00:37:05,508 --> 00:37:06,758
I'm your guardian as of today,

823
00:37:06,842 --> 00:37:08,009
so just do as I say.

824
00:37:08,842 --> 00:37:10,092
Why are you her guardian

825
00:37:10,176 --> 00:37:11,176
when I'm here?

826
00:37:15,176 --> 00:37:16,258
Dad, are you okay?

827
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:17,550
Everything's okay, right?

828
00:37:17,633 --> 00:37:18,925
Our family will be fine, right?

829
00:37:19,009 --> 00:37:20,092
I saw the news.

830
00:37:20,633 --> 00:37:21,550
Is it all true?

831
00:37:21,633 --> 00:37:23,134
I'll take care of that,

832
00:37:23,425 --> 00:37:24,675
so don't worry about it.

833
00:37:25,592 --> 00:37:26,675
Just go to school.

834
00:37:27,092 --> 00:37:28,592
Be more confident in times like this.

835
00:37:29,258 --> 00:37:31,425
Show them that no one can mess with us.

836
00:37:32,009 --> 00:37:33,800
I don't care about anything else.

837
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,967
I don't care who you date

838
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:37,134
or how you're criticised.

839
00:37:37,217 --> 00:37:38,300
I really don't care.

840
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:43,758
But if we become poor,

841
00:37:44,341 --> 00:37:45,550
I won't forgive you.

842
00:37:51,341 --> 00:37:53,300
"Cheonga Arts High School"

843
00:37:54,633 --> 00:37:56,300
Birds of a feather sure flock together.

844
00:37:56,383 --> 00:37:57,925
My gosh. - They have no shame.

845
00:37:58,009 --> 00:37:59,176
I wouldn't have come to school.

846
00:37:59,258 --> 00:38:00,508
I mean, it's beyond embarrassing.

847
00:38:00,633 --> 00:38:01,550
Unbelievable. - Their parents

848
00:38:01,633 --> 00:38:02,467
are as nasty as they are.

849
00:38:02,633 --> 00:38:04,508
Wow, I can't believe this.

850
00:38:05,092 --> 00:38:06,217
You actually came to school?

851
00:38:07,009 --> 00:38:08,258
His complete lack of shame

852
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,675
scares me.

853
00:38:12,675 --> 00:38:13,758
Look at this punk.

854
00:38:14,217 --> 00:38:16,176
How dare you block my way.

855
00:38:16,717 --> 00:38:17,550
Hey!

856
00:38:19,592 --> 00:38:20,675
What? Got a problem with that?

857
00:38:20,758 --> 00:38:21,842
Then hit me.

858
00:38:22,176 --> 00:38:25,258
Punch me. Go on. Do it.

859
00:38:25,925 --> 00:38:27,176
Gosh, Seok Hoon, I see that

860
00:38:27,258 --> 00:38:28,925
you've learned to control your temper.

861
00:38:29,176 --> 00:38:31,092
I saw the news. It looks like your family

862
00:38:31,425 --> 00:38:32,967
is about to go bust.

863
00:38:34,258 --> 00:38:35,383
His dad sounds like

864
00:38:35,508 --> 00:38:36,800
a total con artist, doesn't he?

865
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:39,550
He even had an affair on top of that.

866
00:38:39,675 --> 00:38:41,009
So what's going to happen now?

867
00:38:41,758 --> 00:38:44,800
Will you and Eun Byeol become sisters?

868
00:38:46,383 --> 00:38:47,717
Joo Eun Byeol?

869
00:38:48,884 --> 00:38:50,508
Hey! Enough.

870
00:38:50,925 --> 00:38:53,508
Yes, aren't we all friends? Don't be mean.

871
00:38:54,009 --> 00:38:55,300
We have enough to worry about.

872
00:38:55,425 --> 00:38:56,842
No wonder you're worried.

873
00:38:57,592 --> 00:38:59,758
The suspects in the murder of Min Seol A

874
00:38:59,884 --> 00:39:02,009
are you guys and your parents.

875
00:39:02,592 --> 00:39:03,925
Look at Eun Byeol.

876
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:05,258
She's too embarrassed

877
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,217
to even come to school.

878
00:39:06,842 --> 00:39:07,967
Shut your mouth!

879
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:09,800
You pieces of rubbish!

880
00:39:13,675 --> 00:39:16,134
Rubbish! - Rubbish!

881
00:39:16,258 --> 00:39:20,383
Rubbish! - Rubbish!

882
00:39:20,467 --> 00:39:22,050
Get lost! - Seriously.

883
00:39:22,341 --> 00:39:23,550
Stop it!

884
00:39:30,508 --> 00:39:31,633
Can you say you did nothing wrong?

885
00:39:32,009 --> 00:39:33,050
You just stood by and watched

886
00:39:33,134 --> 00:39:34,217
when they were bullying others

887
00:39:34,258 --> 00:39:35,508
not to get on their bad side.

888
00:39:35,592 --> 00:39:36,425
But you're bullying them

889
00:39:36,508 --> 00:39:37,383
now that the situation has changed.

890
00:39:38,258 --> 00:39:39,758
You guys are no better than them.

891
00:39:40,758 --> 00:39:42,884
Hey, are you taking Seok Hoon's side

892
00:39:42,967 --> 00:39:44,134
because he's your boyfriend?

893
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:48,217
Ro Na, his days are over now.

894
00:39:48,884 --> 00:39:51,050
Why don't you be my girlfriend?

895
00:39:51,134 --> 00:39:52,258
Guys, don't we look cute together?

896
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,592
We do, right?

897
00:39:57,176 --> 00:39:58,383
Hey, calm down. - Hey!

898
00:39:58,467 --> 00:39:59,842
Hey! - No!

899
00:40:00,258 --> 00:40:01,592
You witch! - Gosh!

900
00:40:03,258 --> 00:40:04,467
Hey! - Stop it!

901
00:40:05,092 --> 00:40:06,383
No! - Hey!

902
00:40:07,092 --> 00:40:09,717
Guys, enough! - Hey!

903
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:18,092
Stop!

904
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:23,633
The school is a sacred place.

905
00:40:23,717 --> 00:40:25,092
What on earth are you doing now?

906
00:40:25,258 --> 00:40:26,717
They provoked us first!

907
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,092
They even threw rubbish at us.

908
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:29,467
No, Seok Kyung grabbed us

909
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:30,467
by the hair first.

910
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:31,842
All of you, be quiet!

911
00:40:32,633 --> 00:40:34,550
The school is going through a lot now.

912
00:40:34,633 --> 00:40:36,217
Who told you guys to fight like this?

913
00:40:36,758 --> 00:40:38,800
All of you, go back to your classroom.

914
00:40:38,884 --> 00:40:40,050
Now!

915
00:40:40,758 --> 00:40:42,050
Move it!

916
00:40:42,633 --> 00:40:43,592
Darn it.

917
00:40:48,842 --> 00:40:51,217
Joo Seok Hoon, Joo Seok Kyung,

918
00:40:51,258 --> 00:40:52,800
Yoo Je Ni, and Lee Min Hyuk.

919
00:40:52,925 --> 00:40:54,050
Stop.

920
00:40:55,092 --> 00:40:56,800
Where do you think you're going?

921
00:40:57,467 --> 00:40:58,800
Aren't you going to clean this up?

922
00:40:59,009 --> 00:41:00,176
We didn't do this.

923
00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:01,592
They threw the rubbish at us!

924
00:41:01,675 --> 00:41:03,134
We're the victims here!

925
00:41:05,134 --> 00:41:06,341
How dare you talk back to me.

926
00:41:06,425 --> 00:41:07,800
I am your teacher.

927
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:11,467
All of you will get two penalty points.

928
00:41:11,633 --> 00:41:14,176
And you guys have to clean the washrooms

929
00:41:14,258 --> 00:41:15,758
after school today.

930
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:18,425
Bae Ro Na.

931
00:41:18,884 --> 00:41:20,675
Why are you glaring at me like that?

932
00:41:20,884 --> 00:41:22,425
Aren't you friends with these guys?

933
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,633
Come here and pick up all this rubbish.

934
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,383
Now!

935
00:41:27,217 --> 00:41:29,217
You know that you're the worst, right?

936
00:41:36,717 --> 00:41:37,758
Eun Byeol.

937
00:41:39,092 --> 00:41:40,800
I won't go down like this.

938
00:41:42,258 --> 00:41:43,842
I promise you that I'll rise back up.

939
00:41:46,258 --> 00:41:47,383
You trust me, right?

940
00:41:54,884 --> 00:41:56,258
Are you listening?

941
00:41:58,176 --> 00:41:59,300
My dear Eun Byeol.

942
00:41:59,842 --> 00:42:01,176
Wake up soon...

943
00:42:03,717 --> 00:42:06,758
so we can eat something nice together.

944
00:42:08,258 --> 00:42:10,009
I'll make some pasta and wait for you.

945
00:42:46,633 --> 00:42:47,758
Search thoroughly! - Yes, sir.

946
00:42:51,842 --> 00:42:52,675
Where's the guest?

947
00:42:52,758 --> 00:42:54,925
He already checked out.

948
00:42:56,675 --> 00:42:57,842
Go to the airport now.

949
00:42:57,925 --> 00:42:58,800
Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

950
00:43:00,925 --> 00:43:02,758
Find him and bring him to me at all costs!

951
00:43:03,134 --> 00:43:04,134
Yes, sir.

952
00:43:07,258 --> 00:43:08,592
Did you get all my stuff from the hotel?

953
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,633
Good. Thank you, Mr. Hong.

954
00:43:11,925 --> 00:43:12,925
I'll see you in the US.

955
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,925
You should be careful too.

956
00:43:18,508 --> 00:43:20,258
It seems like Oh Yoon Hee

957
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,134
told Joo Dan Tae about our relationship.

958
00:43:22,592 --> 00:43:23,467
I'm not surprised.

959
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:26,800
She probably felt cornered.

960
00:43:27,467 --> 00:43:29,009
Have you reported her to the police yet?

961
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:34,176
She promised to turn herself in today.

962
00:43:35,092 --> 00:43:36,925
Do you think she'll keep that promise?

963
00:43:38,176 --> 00:43:39,675
I know that she'll never

964
00:43:39,758 --> 00:43:40,842
turn herself in voluntarily.

965
00:43:40,925 --> 00:43:42,092
That's...

966
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,425
That's up to her.

967
00:43:47,258 --> 00:43:48,467
I will keep the promise

968
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:50,967
I made to Seol A.

969
00:43:53,134 --> 00:43:55,925
Come to the US with me.

970
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:59,550
You deserve to be happy now.

971
00:44:00,341 --> 00:44:01,341
I promised Seol A

972
00:44:01,925 --> 00:44:04,717
that I'll make sure her mum becomes happy.

973
00:44:09,009 --> 00:44:10,176
I can't leave.

974
00:44:10,258 --> 00:44:12,092
Joo Dan Tae is after you now.

975
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,258
You need to leave and not come back until

976
00:44:15,592 --> 00:44:17,176
he gets the legal punishment he deserves.

977
00:44:18,258 --> 00:44:19,633
What about Seok Hoon and Seok Kyung?

978
00:44:20,592 --> 00:44:22,217
I am their mother.

979
00:44:22,258 --> 00:44:23,258
Do you think

980
00:44:24,717 --> 00:44:26,300
they want you as their mum?

981
00:44:27,258 --> 00:44:28,925
There are things that you can't change.

982
00:44:29,134 --> 00:44:31,633
Didn't you know that you wouldn't be able

983
00:44:32,467 --> 00:44:34,800
to go back to them the moment you decided

984
00:44:34,884 --> 00:44:36,217
to get Seol A's revenge?

985
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,134
I can't leave my kids with him.

986
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:47,425
"Sim Soo Ryeon, First Class"

987
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:48,967
The flight leaves tonight.

988
00:44:49,092 --> 00:44:50,633
I've already prepared everything.

989
00:44:50,717 --> 00:44:52,258
We can't put this off any longer.

990
00:44:53,425 --> 00:44:54,341
I already told Hye In

991
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,884
that you're coming too.

992
00:45:09,633 --> 00:45:10,675
Thank you.

993
00:45:11,884 --> 00:45:12,925
I really mean it.

994
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:20,633
I'll wait for you.

995
00:45:22,341 --> 00:45:23,800
I won't leave without you.

996
00:45:29,508 --> 00:45:31,508
"Korea Air"

997
00:45:31,884 --> 00:45:32,758
Oh, boy.

998
00:45:33,592 --> 00:45:34,592
I'm exhausted.

999
00:45:35,134 --> 00:45:36,258
You told us not to worry.

1000
00:45:36,341 --> 00:45:37,508
What is this mess?

1001
00:45:38,009 --> 00:45:39,258
Why did the cops have to interview me?

1002
00:45:39,341 --> 00:45:40,258
I'm so honest that

1003
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,592
I don't even need the law.

1004
00:45:41,675 --> 00:45:42,967
Ma Ri.

1005
00:45:43,092 --> 00:45:45,258
You're the exact opposite of that.

1006
00:45:46,383 --> 00:45:48,800
Why are you yelling at my husband?

1007
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:50,341
He even bought you hangover soup.

1008
00:45:50,967 --> 00:45:52,383
All of us got grilled by them all night.

1009
00:45:52,592 --> 00:45:54,092
Gosh, I can't even keep my eyes open.

1010
00:45:54,176 --> 00:45:56,217
What in the world... - Also, I helped you

1011
00:45:56,633 --> 00:45:57,800
get away with just being

1012
00:45:57,884 --> 00:45:58,800
a character witness.

1013
00:45:59,009 --> 00:46:01,009
So I don't understand why you're so angry.

1014
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:03,925
Did you do something we don't know about?

1015
00:46:04,675 --> 00:46:05,800
Why were you so intimidated

1016
00:46:05,884 --> 00:46:06,717
in front of the police?

1017
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:07,758
You were all servile to them.

1018
00:46:08,134 --> 00:46:09,967
Gosh, that was embarrassing.

1019
00:46:10,092 --> 00:46:11,258
Watch what you say.

1020
00:46:11,592 --> 00:46:12,592
I wasn't intimidated.

1021
00:46:12,675 --> 00:46:14,842
I'm an attorney, for goodness' sake.

1022
00:46:14,925 --> 00:46:16,508
I'm so upset that I had to be

1023
00:46:17,383 --> 00:46:18,592
interviewed by the police.

1024
00:46:19,383 --> 00:46:21,550
Min Hyuk, that fool. Why did he

1025
00:46:21,633 --> 00:46:23,425
have to hang out with those bad kids?

1026
00:46:23,925 --> 00:46:25,633
No one in our family

1027
00:46:25,717 --> 00:46:28,592
is capable of doing something so horrible.

1028
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:29,675
So?

1029
00:46:30,258 --> 00:46:31,425
Are you saying

1030
00:46:31,925 --> 00:46:33,717
this is all Je Ni's fault?

1031
00:46:34,009 --> 00:46:34,842
What then?

1032
00:46:35,092 --> 00:46:36,508
Do you think this is Min Hyuk's fault?

1033
00:46:36,592 --> 00:46:37,800
What? How dare you!

1034
00:46:39,884 --> 00:46:41,092
What are you all staring at?

1035
00:46:41,176 --> 00:46:42,258
You're making it so obvious

1036
00:46:42,884 --> 00:46:44,592
that I can't even look away.

1037
00:46:45,341 --> 00:46:47,717
You've never seen a famous person before?

1038
00:46:51,009 --> 00:46:52,009
Gosh.

1039
00:46:52,134 --> 00:46:54,050
My name topped the trending keyword chart,

1040
00:46:54,134 --> 00:46:55,176
and my face showed up

1041
00:46:55,258 --> 00:46:56,258
in every news channel.

1042
00:46:56,425 --> 00:46:58,217
I'm like a celebrity now.

1043
00:46:58,758 --> 00:46:59,717
If we stay here, we'll end up

1044
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:00,758
embarrassing ourselves more. Let's go.

1045
00:47:00,842 --> 00:47:03,425
Honey, you must be exhausted.

1046
00:47:13,092 --> 00:47:14,092
Hello, sir.

1047
00:47:15,717 --> 00:47:16,842
Where's her mother?

1048
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:18,967
She stepped out to take care of something.

1049
00:47:19,176 --> 00:47:20,842
What? Knowing her daughter's condition?

1050
00:47:22,967 --> 00:47:24,050
They've washed out her stomach,

1051
00:47:24,217 --> 00:47:25,383
and her breathing and pulse

1052
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:26,425
are back to normal now.

1053
00:47:26,508 --> 00:47:27,592
Shut your mouth.

1054
00:47:28,217 --> 00:47:30,341
Just go to that arrogant boss of yours.

1055
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,258
I'm sorry, Eun Byeol.

1056
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:53,176
I'm so sorry I wasn't there

1057
00:47:53,842 --> 00:47:55,341
to protect you.

1058
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:00,884
I'm sorry.

1059
00:48:11,092 --> 00:48:12,217
Eun Byeol.

1060
00:48:12,884 --> 00:48:13,967
Eun Byeol, you're awake?

1061
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:15,050
It's me, your dad.

1062
00:48:15,134 --> 00:48:16,550
Do you recognise me?

1063
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,233
Eun Byeol, why did you do that?

1064
00:48:21,258 --> 00:48:23,467
Why did you do something so scary?

1065
00:48:29,758 --> 00:48:31,050
Eun Byeol.

1066
00:48:33,884 --> 00:48:35,217
Eun Byeol?

1067
00:48:46,258 --> 00:48:47,592
Of course.

1068
00:48:48,217 --> 00:48:49,758
I'll make sure the foundation's reputation

1069
00:48:49,842 --> 00:48:51,217
is not tainted in any way.

1070
00:48:51,508 --> 00:48:52,717
You trust me, right?

1071
00:48:54,341 --> 00:48:55,842
If you could tell the prosecution

1072
00:48:55,925 --> 00:48:57,467
that you're strongly against

1073
00:48:57,550 --> 00:48:58,508
the investigation...

1074
00:49:01,217 --> 00:49:02,717
it'd be very helpful.

1075
00:49:07,258 --> 00:49:09,258
I'll be in touch then.

1076
00:49:10,425 --> 00:49:11,758
How can you be here right now

1077
00:49:11,925 --> 00:49:13,675
after what happened to Eun Byeol?

1078
00:49:15,675 --> 00:49:17,300
Are you blaming it all on me?

1079
00:49:18,092 --> 00:49:19,884
Don't talk like you did nothing wrong.

1080
00:49:20,134 --> 00:49:21,176
Eun Byeol...

1081
00:49:24,925 --> 00:49:26,217
Eun Byeol won't talk.

1082
00:49:26,967 --> 00:49:27,884
What?

1083
00:49:29,467 --> 00:49:30,717
She woke up?

1084
00:49:31,092 --> 00:49:32,258
She regained her consciousness,

1085
00:49:33,009 --> 00:49:34,009
but she won't talk.

1086
00:49:34,592 --> 00:49:36,050
I think she has psychogenic aphasia.

1087
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:39,176
What? Aphasia?

1088
00:49:45,675 --> 00:49:46,675
She just woke up,

1089
00:49:46,758 --> 00:49:48,633
so I'm sure it's just temporary.

1090
00:49:49,842 --> 00:49:50,758
Don't worry.

1091
00:49:51,717 --> 00:49:53,842
As soon as I deal with the foundation,

1092
00:49:55,009 --> 00:49:56,425
I'll have her receive proper treatment.

1093
00:49:56,758 --> 00:49:58,092
I'm busy, so please leave.

1094
00:50:09,217 --> 00:50:10,341
Seo Jin.

1095
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:13,258
Come to your senses, please.

1096
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:17,300
Why does the foundation even matter?

1097
00:50:18,176 --> 00:50:19,258
It matters to me!

1098
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:21,425
Once everything returns to normal,

1099
00:50:22,592 --> 00:50:24,717
Eun Byeol will recover as well.

1100
00:50:25,217 --> 00:50:27,009
She'll go back to school, study hard,

1101
00:50:27,092 --> 00:50:28,300
eat well,

1102
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:29,800
and practise her singing too.

1103
00:50:31,467 --> 00:50:32,717
I believe in my daughter.

1104
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,050
I'll make Eun Byeol quit school

1105
00:50:38,383 --> 00:50:39,800
and move to my hometown with her.

1106
00:50:41,092 --> 00:50:42,092
I don't need to be

1107
00:50:42,176 --> 00:50:43,633
the director of Cheonga Medical Centre.

1108
00:50:44,884 --> 00:50:46,092
You two-faced jerk.

1109
00:50:48,425 --> 00:50:49,508
You always act like

1110
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:51,383
you're righteous and conscientious.

1111
00:50:52,925 --> 00:50:54,300
Stop being so fake.

1112
00:50:56,633 --> 00:50:58,842
When the cops asked you about Seol A,

1113
00:50:59,717 --> 00:51:01,217
you denied having done anything to her.

1114
00:51:01,967 --> 00:51:03,592
Because you didn't want to be branded

1115
00:51:03,675 --> 00:51:05,258
as a criminal for the rest of your life.

1116
00:51:06,967 --> 00:51:08,341
You're just like everyone else

1117
00:51:08,425 --> 00:51:09,258
at Hera Club.

1118
00:51:09,341 --> 00:51:11,383
No, you're even worse than them.

1119
00:51:11,967 --> 00:51:13,383
You're so quick to condemn others

1120
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,134
while only caring about

1121
00:51:15,217 --> 00:51:16,508
your own personal gain.

1122
00:51:17,383 --> 00:51:19,176
Stop acting like you care about Eun Byeol.

1123
00:51:19,717 --> 00:51:20,925
In the end, I'm the only one

1124
00:51:21,009 --> 00:51:22,258
who can keep her safe.

1125
00:51:22,341 --> 00:51:23,675
Yes, that's right!

1126
00:51:25,176 --> 00:51:26,300
Did you realise that just now?

1127
00:51:27,258 --> 00:51:28,467
That's exactly how I am.

1128
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:30,675
But I won't let you

1129
00:51:30,758 --> 00:51:31,800
take Eun Byeol from me.

1130
00:51:32,675 --> 00:51:35,633
I can't let you raise her.

1131
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:04,967
Oh, hello.

1132
00:52:06,009 --> 00:52:08,176
It's me, Chief Director Cheon Seo Jin.

1133
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:13,258
I'm calling because I need your help.

1134
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:15,134
You know, about the scandal

1135
00:52:16,009 --> 00:52:17,425
surrounding the foundation...

1136
00:52:24,383 --> 00:52:26,425
Please help me out.

1137
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:52,717
It's me, Yoon Hee.

1138
00:52:53,258 --> 00:52:54,258
Everything's okay, right?

1139
00:52:54,717 --> 00:52:56,467
I was worried, so I was about to call you.

1140
00:52:56,758 --> 00:52:58,341
What are you going to do about Soo Ryeon?

1141
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:00,341
I'm so anxious that it's driving me crazy.

1142
00:53:00,425 --> 00:53:02,425
Who knows what she might do?

1143
00:53:02,592 --> 00:53:03,633
Why are you anxious?

1144
00:53:04,134 --> 00:53:05,300
You know who I am.

1145
00:53:06,176 --> 00:53:07,633
She tried so hard to destroy me, but look,

1146
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:09,134
I'm totally fine.

1147
00:53:09,884 --> 00:53:10,842
Sim Soo Ryeon

1148
00:53:11,009 --> 00:53:12,425
can never beat me.

1149
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:14,508
Don't worry. Just wait.

1150
00:53:28,675 --> 00:53:29,633
Yes?

1151
00:53:29,925 --> 00:53:31,050
Unit 4502, right?

1152
00:53:31,176 --> 00:53:32,508
Come down and pick up your package.

1153
00:53:34,633 --> 00:53:36,717
I'm busy now. I'll pick it up later.

1154
00:53:51,592 --> 00:53:52,717
Hello?

1155
00:53:53,758 --> 00:53:54,800
Ms. Oh Yoon Hee?

1156
00:53:55,675 --> 00:53:56,884
I'm calling from Gangnam Police Station.

1157
00:53:58,217 --> 00:53:59,258
How can I help you?

1158
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:01,467
We need you to come in

1159
00:54:01,550 --> 00:54:02,550
to answer a few questions

1160
00:54:02,633 --> 00:54:03,633
regarding JKING Holdings.

1161
00:54:07,009 --> 00:54:08,134
Okay, sure.

1162
00:54:20,383 --> 00:54:21,383
You have until today

1163
00:54:21,467 --> 00:54:22,758
to turn yourself in.

1164
00:54:22,842 --> 00:54:23,675
If you don't do it,

1165
00:54:23,758 --> 00:54:24,842
I can't guarantee anything.

1166
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:31,383
You also need to experience what it's like

1167
00:54:31,592 --> 00:54:32,758
to lose a child.

1168
00:54:33,217 --> 00:54:34,675
You must suffer the same way.

1169
00:54:35,217 --> 00:54:36,592
Wouldn't that be only fair?

1170
00:54:40,425 --> 00:54:41,884
Are you still not ready yet?

1171
00:54:42,341 --> 00:54:44,258
I will not forgive you.

1172
00:54:44,925 --> 00:54:47,009
You'd better go to the police station now.

1173
00:54:47,092 --> 00:54:50,092
"Soo Ryeon"

1174
00:54:50,758 --> 00:54:52,134
If you keep being stubborn like this,

1175
00:54:52,508 --> 00:54:53,758
I will destroy Ro Na as well.

1176
00:54:54,050 --> 00:54:55,425
She'll end up like Seol A.

1177
00:55:09,675 --> 00:55:10,842
Please don't do this.

1178
00:55:11,884 --> 00:55:13,425
If you do anything to my daughter,

1179
00:55:14,258 --> 00:55:16,050
I swear I'll make you pay for it.

1180
00:55:26,009 --> 00:55:28,092
Focusing on vocal music,

1181
00:55:28,176 --> 00:55:29,717
we're studying-- - Ro Na.

1182
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,009
Bae Ro Na!

1183
00:55:33,508 --> 00:55:34,675
Mum.

1184
00:55:34,967 --> 00:55:36,217
Are you okay?

1185
00:55:37,092 --> 00:55:38,258
Nothing happened, right?

1186
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:39,550
What's the matter?

1187
00:55:39,884 --> 00:55:40,925
Why would I not be okay?

1188
00:55:41,092 --> 00:55:42,425
Is her mum going crazy?

1189
00:55:42,508 --> 00:55:43,425
What's with her?

1190
00:55:43,508 --> 00:55:44,925
Ms. Oh.

1191
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:47,258
You can't barge in here during class.

1192
00:55:47,717 --> 00:55:49,300
Ro Na and the kids fought,

1193
00:55:49,383 --> 00:55:50,633
but I swear I didn't hit

1194
00:55:50,717 --> 00:55:52,176
or scold her.

1195
00:55:53,842 --> 00:55:54,800
I'm sorry.

1196
00:55:56,508 --> 00:55:57,842
Mum, what's the matter with you?

1197
00:55:58,134 --> 00:55:59,425
You said everything was okay.

1198
00:55:59,508 --> 00:56:00,967
Why come to school and cause a scene?

1199
00:56:01,592 --> 00:56:02,967
I'm so embarrassed.

1200
00:56:04,425 --> 00:56:05,550
I'm sorry.

1201
00:56:05,967 --> 00:56:07,717
I must've lost my mind for a moment.

1202
00:56:08,717 --> 00:56:10,341
I was just so anxious and worried.

1203
00:56:11,258 --> 00:56:12,425
Don't go anywhere alone

1204
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:14,258
after school, okay?

1205
00:56:15,176 --> 00:56:16,884
Don't meet anyone.

1206
00:56:17,258 --> 00:56:18,758
Don't even go to the academy.

1207
00:56:18,842 --> 00:56:20,258
Just go straight home, okay?

1208
00:56:20,383 --> 00:56:22,300
Mum, are you going somewhere?

1209
00:56:25,009 --> 00:56:25,925
Mum.

1210
00:56:28,258 --> 00:56:29,842
Are you being like this because of Ms. Sim?

1211
00:56:30,758 --> 00:56:32,217
I don't know what's going on,

1212
00:56:32,717 --> 00:56:34,925
but can't you just apologise to her first?

1213
00:56:35,425 --> 00:56:38,633
She's been looking so sad lately.

1214
00:56:38,842 --> 00:56:40,300
Why do you even care?

1215
00:56:41,176 --> 00:56:42,717
Worry about me first.

1216
00:56:44,508 --> 00:56:45,717
To tell you the truth,

1217
00:56:46,884 --> 00:56:47,842
I had a really hard time

1218
00:56:47,925 --> 00:56:48,758
after I dropped out,

1219
00:56:50,341 --> 00:56:52,092
so I thought about taking my own life.

1220
00:56:54,467 --> 00:56:55,800
A car was speeding towards me,

1221
00:56:57,009 --> 00:56:58,258
but I didn't want to move.

1222
00:57:06,258 --> 00:57:08,176
Ro Na, are you okay?

1223
00:57:09,884 --> 00:57:11,884
Ms. Sim saved my life in that moment.

1224
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:15,842
When she held me tightly in her arms...

1225
00:57:17,176 --> 00:57:18,217
"Ro Na, you must live.

1226
00:57:19,134 --> 00:57:20,592
You must live, no matter what."

1227
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,217
I felt like I could hear her say that.

1228
00:57:27,758 --> 00:57:28,884
So...

1229
00:57:29,633 --> 00:57:31,134
if you did anything wrong,

1230
00:57:31,425 --> 00:57:33,009
just apologise to her first.

1231
00:57:34,675 --> 00:57:35,884
Do it for me, please.

1232
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:47,800
Mum.

1233
00:57:48,425 --> 00:57:49,467
Mum!

1234
00:57:56,550 --> 00:57:58,508
"Seoul Gangnam Police Station"

1235
00:58:00,467 --> 00:58:02,176
"Seoul Gangnam Police Station"

1236
00:58:11,717 --> 00:58:13,383
What am I thinking now?

1237
00:58:17,134 --> 00:58:18,467
I must come to my senses.

1238
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:25,425
"Messages, Soo Ryeon"

1239
00:58:25,592 --> 00:58:26,967
You have until 6 p.m. today.

1240
00:58:27,508 --> 00:58:28,758
I won't wait any longer.

1241
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:32,217
Sim Soo Ryeon.

1242

00:59:21,592 --> 00:59:23,592
"My friend"

"Ms. Yang"

1247
00:59:29,884 --> 00:59:30,884
Hello, Ms. Yang.

1248
00:59:31,134 --> 00:59:32,258
Is everything okay?

1249
00:59:32,633 --> 00:59:33,884
Ma'am, Chairman Joo

1250
00:59:33,967 --> 00:59:35,758
took the kids to his study again.

1251
00:59:35,842 --> 00:59:37,050
What should I do?

1252
00:59:42,592 --> 00:59:43,842
"Hera Palace"

1253
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:52,550

1254
00:59:53,050 --> 00:59:54,258
Seok Kyung.

1255
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:39,258
Your attention, please.

1256
01:00:46,921 --> 01:00:48,838
"Soo Ryeon"

1257
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:57,462
The call cannot be connected.

1258
01:01:11,925 --> 01:01:13,300
Soo Ryeon.

1259
01:01:13,758 --> 01:01:15,008
Soo Ryeon.

1260
01:01:19,237 --> 01:01:21,654
Soo Ryeon, are you okay? Soo Ryeon.

1261
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:26,348
What? Soo Ryeon.

1262
01:01:31,475 --> 01:01:32,767
Soo Ryeon.

1263
01:01:33,433 --> 01:01:35,141
Soo Ryeon? Soo Ryeon.

1264
01:01:35,517 --> 01:01:38,684
Soo Ryeon, wake up. Don't die! No!

1265
01:01:38,767 --> 01:01:44,892
No, Soo Ryeon! No, please don't die.

1266
01:02:01,725 --> 01:02:03,308
What's going on? - My gosh.

1267
01:02:04,058 --> 01:02:05,850
What happened? - I have no idea.

1268
01:02:06,809 --> 01:02:09,100
What is going on? - Is someone hurt?

1269
01:02:12,976 --> 01:02:14,517
You're under arrest for murder.

1270
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:15,934
You have the right to remain silent

1271
01:02:16,017 --> 01:02:17,475
and the right to have a lawyer.

1272
01:02:17,809 --> 01:02:19,058
You may also request to have

1273
01:02:19,141 --> 01:02:20,392
the legality of your arrest reviewed.

1274
01:02:21,392 --> 01:02:23,183
Ms. Yang, what happened?

1275
01:02:23,267 --> 01:02:24,475
Your wife is...

1276
01:02:28,058 --> 01:02:29,058
Take her.

1277
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:34,308
You did this?

1278
01:02:35,058 --> 01:02:36,141
You killed my wife?

1279
01:02:36,684 --> 01:02:38,600
How could you do something so cruel?

1280
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:41,767
Hurry up. Take her!

1281
01:02:55,850 --> 01:02:56,767
Mum. - Mum.

1282
01:02:56,850 --> 01:02:57,725
Mum! - Mum!

1283
01:02:57,850 --> 01:02:59,350
Let go! - Mum!

1284
01:02:59,725 --> 01:03:01,600
Mum. Mum!

1285
01:03:01,684 --> 01:03:03,058
Mum. - Mum!

1286
01:03:03,141 --> 01:03:04,934
Get off me! Mum. - Mum!

1287
01:03:05,017 --> 01:03:06,517
Mum. Let go of me.

1288
01:03:06,642 --> 01:03:08,684
I said, let go! Mum. - Mum.

1289
01:03:08,767 --> 01:03:10,225
Mum! - Mum!

1290
01:03:10,308 --> 01:03:11,892
Mum... - Mum!

1291
01:03:13,183 --> 01:03:14,684
Mum! - Let go.

1292
01:03:14,767 --> 01:03:15,892
I said, let go! - Mum!

1293
01:03:15,976 --> 01:03:17,809
Mum. - Calm down!

1294
01:03:17,892 --> 01:03:20,058
Mum. - Guys, calm down.

1295
01:03:20,141 --> 01:03:21,934
Calm down.

1296
01:03:27,558 --> 01:03:29,517
There was a murder in the penthouse?

1297
01:03:29,976 --> 01:03:31,058
How could something like this

1298
01:03:31,141 --> 01:03:32,017
happen at Hera Palace?

1299
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:34,017
My gosh! - Is this a lie?

1300
01:03:34,308 --> 01:03:37,100
Gosh. - Is that really Soo Ryeon?

1301
01:03:37,183 --> 01:03:38,684
My goodness.

1302
01:03:39,058 --> 01:03:41,141
What is going on?

1303
01:03:41,934 --> 01:03:44,017
Wait, isn't that Oh Yoon Hee?

1304
01:03:44,225 --> 01:03:45,183
No way.

1305
01:03:46,517 --> 01:03:49,308
Hold on. Oh Yoon Hee killed her?

1306
01:03:49,976 --> 01:03:51,600
Gosh. - That crazy witch.

1307
01:03:51,850 --> 01:03:53,308
She's not even human!

1308
01:03:54,558 --> 01:03:55,767
I can't believe this.

1309
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:58,642
Search thoroughly.

1310
01:03:58,725 --> 01:03:59,934
Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

1311
01:04:08,308 --> 01:04:09,725
Gosh, look at this. She put her face

1312
01:04:09,809 --> 01:04:10,850
on their family photo.

1313
01:04:11,267 --> 01:04:12,475
She was clearly a stalker.

1314
01:04:15,475 --> 01:04:16,517
This is so creepy.

1315
01:04:18,183 --> 01:04:19,725
Gosh, what is all this?

1316
01:04:19,809 --> 01:04:20,850
Oh, my.

1317
01:04:22,433 --> 01:04:23,433
Look at all these designer bags

1318
01:04:23,517 --> 01:04:24,392
and clothes.

1319
01:04:27,225 --> 01:04:28,642
One knife is missing.

1320
01:04:28,934 --> 01:04:30,058
It matches the one she used.

1321
01:04:30,725 --> 01:04:31,809
Take it as evidence.

1322
01:04:40,642 --> 01:04:43,767
Who are you people?

1323
01:04:45,725 --> 01:04:46,725
Are you Ms. Oh's daughter?

1324
01:04:47,017 --> 01:04:47,934
Yes.

1325
01:04:48,725 --> 01:04:49,767
I am.

1326
01:04:50,934 --> 01:04:52,809
What are you doing here?

1327
01:04:53,805 --> 01:04:54,972
And what about my mum?

1328
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:56,850
Where is she?

1329
01:04:58,017 --> 01:04:59,558
We repeat the announcement.

1330
01:04:59,642 --> 01:05:01,767
Korea Air...

1331
01:05:04,433 --> 01:05:07,433
Please come to Gate One.

1332
01:05:07,517 --> 01:05:09,600
"Sir, you should see this"

1333
01:05:09,684 --> 01:05:12,058
Korea Air 5A1...

1334
01:05:12,308 --> 01:05:14,600
Another horrible incident took place

1335
01:05:14,684 --> 01:05:15,809
at Hera Palace,

1336
01:05:15,892 --> 01:05:16,850
the symbol of Gangnam's wealthiest.

1337
01:05:16,934 --> 01:05:18,517
Sim was murdered

1338
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:20,350
in the penthouse at Hera Palace,

1339
01:05:20,433 --> 01:05:22,433
and Oh, a resident of Hera Palace,

1340
01:05:22,517 --> 01:05:24,058
was arrested at the scene.

1341
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:26,058
Sim, also a resident at Hera Palace,

1342
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:27,767
was pronounced dead at the scene

1343
01:05:27,850 --> 01:05:29,433
due to excessive bleeding.

1344
01:05:36,558 --> 01:05:38,225
Taxi. Taxi!

1345
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:43,892
Taxi!

1346
01:05:54,725 --> 01:05:57,392
"Passport, Logan Lee"

1347
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:59,392
On my way back from the grocery store,

1348
01:06:00,725 --> 01:06:02,767
I saw the woman from the 45th floor

1349
01:06:02,850 --> 01:06:04,934
using the card key to enter the penthouse.

1350
01:06:06,183 --> 01:06:08,308
Just as I was thinking it was odd,

1351
01:06:09,350 --> 01:06:10,892
I suddenly heard a scream

1352
01:06:10,976 --> 01:06:11,934
inside the house.

1353
01:06:12,475 --> 01:06:14,058
So I ran in and saw Ms. Sim...

1354
01:06:16,934 --> 01:06:17,892
That woman killed her.

1355
01:06:17,976 --> 01:06:19,225
I saw it.

1356
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:22,100
I saw her stabbing Ms. Sim with a knife.

1357
01:06:23,475 --> 01:06:24,475
My wife and I

1358
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:27,017
were in the process of getting a divorce.

1359
01:06:28,225 --> 01:06:30,225
She was seeing someone

1360
01:06:31,976 --> 01:06:33,558
and wanted to move to the US with him.

1361
01:06:35,767 --> 01:06:37,725
So she kept demanding a divorce.

1362
01:06:38,934 --> 01:06:39,892
But...

1363
01:06:40,976 --> 01:06:42,392
as soon as Oh Yoon Hee found out

1364
01:06:43,475 --> 01:06:44,600
that we were getting a divorce...

1365
01:06:46,850 --> 01:06:48,350
her obsession began.

1366
01:06:48,767 --> 01:06:50,350
She kept calling me

1367
01:06:51,850 --> 01:06:52,809
and acted like...

1368
01:06:54,141 --> 01:06:56,058
she was my wife.

1369
01:06:58,392 --> 01:07:00,058
And she even sneaked

1370
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:01,642
into our bedroom one night.

1371
01:07:03,058 --> 01:07:04,308
That really creeped me out.

1372
01:07:07,141 --> 01:07:08,892
Are you talking about this?

1373
01:07:09,684 --> 01:07:10,809
Yes, that's right.

1374
01:07:12,058 --> 01:07:13,809
I had installed a camera in our bedroom

1375
01:07:13,892 --> 01:07:15,183
because we had many valuables,

1376
01:07:16,058 --> 01:07:17,225
and that was caught on tape.

1377
01:07:18,558 --> 01:07:21,392
She even tried on your late wife's dress?

1378
01:07:23,642 --> 01:07:26,058
Did she ever threaten you directly?

1379
01:07:28,809 --> 01:07:31,017
She said this to me.

1380
01:07:31,058 --> 01:07:33,642
I recorded it just in case.

1381
01:07:34,183 --> 01:07:36,558
I waited to ask you a favour.

1382
01:07:36,642 --> 01:07:38,433
"Oh Yoon Hee Voice Recording"

1383
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:40,308
Get rid of

1384
01:07:41,809 --> 01:07:42,892
Sim Soo Ryeon.

1385
01:07:44,558 --> 01:07:45,558
Why were you so fixated

1386
01:07:45,642 --> 01:07:46,642
on killing Sim Soo Ryeon?

1387
01:07:49,308 --> 01:07:50,367
To make Joo Dan Tae

1388
01:07:50,392 --> 01:07:51,600
and the penthouse yours?

1389
01:07:54,392 --> 01:07:55,976
Is that what he said?

1390
01:07:58,185 --> 01:07:59,310
That I wanted...

1391
01:08:01,587 --> 01:08:03,046
to make him mine?

1392
01:08:03,692 --> 01:08:05,150
We have solid evidence.

1393
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:08,858
We found your fingerprints

1394
01:08:09,192 --> 01:08:10,984
all over the murder weapon.

1395
01:08:13,109 --> 01:08:14,441
This is your knife, right?

1396
01:08:15,608 --> 01:08:17,276
Answer my question, Ms. Oh.

1397
01:08:17,817 --> 01:08:19,234
Did you kill Sim Soo Ryeon

1398
01:08:19,317 --> 01:08:20,358
with this knife?

1399
01:08:22,567 --> 01:08:23,525
We have a witness,

1400
01:08:23,608 --> 01:08:24,817
so there's no point in denying it.

1401
01:08:34,733 --> 01:08:35,858
Yes.

1402
01:08:39,984 --> 01:08:41,400
I killed her.

1403
01:08:42,358 --> 01:08:43,358
What?

1404
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:44,775
What did you just say?

1405
01:08:48,483 --> 01:08:49,775
I said I killed her.

1406
01:08:52,150 --> 01:08:53,234
Because...

1407
01:08:55,192 --> 01:08:56,483
I hated Soo Ryeon...

1408
01:08:58,441 --> 01:09:00,317
to death.

1409
01:09:27,192 --> 01:09:29,858
=Penthouse=

1410
01:09:29,942 --> 01:09:31,900
Oh Yoon Hee killed Soo Ryeon?

1411
01:09:31,984 --> 01:09:33,358
I admit to everything.

1412
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:35,441
Mum! Mum.

1413
01:09:35,817 --> 01:09:37,317
Dad, are you really okay with this?

1414
01:09:37,358 --> 01:09:38,900
I'm just trying to return everything

1415
01:09:38,984 --> 01:09:39,900
back to its place.

1416
01:09:40,525 --> 01:09:42,567
I envy Chairman Joo and Seo Jin.

1417
01:09:42,650 --> 01:09:44,441
What are you talking about? Explain!

1418
01:09:45,441 --> 01:09:47,109
Soo Ryeon told me everything

1419
01:09:47,192 --> 01:09:48,109
before she died.

1420
01:09:48,192 --> 01:09:49,900
Truly amazing.

1421
01:09:49,984 --> 01:09:50,858
Even the skies

1422
01:09:50,942 --> 01:09:53,109
will side with the rich in the end.
