Wait, Dad!

8
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:45,124
I'd rather die.

9
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:46,666
I can't let you leave like this!

10
00:00:46,749 --> 00:00:47,791
You pathetic fool!

11
00:00:47,874 --> 00:00:48,957
Just look at yourself!

12
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:50,791
You want to be my successor

13
00:00:50,874 --> 00:00:52,041
when you're such a weakling?

14
00:00:52,457 --> 00:00:53,791
Not a chance!

00:00:54,124 --> 00:00:55,666
Cheonga belongs to Seo Young now.

16
00:00:56,582 --> 00:00:58,208
I've had enough of this!

17
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:06,208
If I've lived my life wrong,

18
00:01:07,124 --> 00:01:08,791
it's all your fault!

19
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:10,916
You always

20
00:01:11,457 --> 00:01:13,083
compared me with Seo Young

21
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:14,291
and made us compete against each other.

22
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,499
You were always so hard on me!

23
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:19,749
You never truly loved me.

24
00:01:20,499 --> 00:01:21,957
You used your children

25
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:23,416
for your own reputation!

26
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:25,999
I...

27
00:01:27,528 --> 00:01:30,250
always craved to be loved.

28
00:01:30,497 --> 00:01:32,941
That's why I had an affair.

29
00:01:35,749 --> 00:01:37,879
How dare you talk back to me?

30
00:01:37,904 --> 00:01:40,995
You're no longer my daughter!

31
00:01:43,857 --> 00:01:44,982
No!

32
00:01:45,733 --> 00:01:46,691

You can't take it from me!

35
00:01:49,316 --> 00:01:50,149
Let go!

36
00:01:50,232 --> 00:01:51,441
Let go. I said, let go.

37
00:01:51,524 --> 00:01:52,399
No!

38
00:01:52,775 --> 00:01:53,816
Let go!

39
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,066

to abandon me.

68
00:04:52,316 --> 00:04:53,982
Ms. Cheon, you were with me today.

69
00:04:54,857 --> 00:04:56,608
After that, you were in the lesson room.

70

What?

71
00:04:59,274 --> 00:05:00,775
You must pull yourself together.

72
00:05:02,316 --> 00:05:03,649
Will you fall down like this?

73
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:09,066
No.

74
00:05:11,857 --> 00:05:13,066
I can't let that happen.

75
00:05:13,649 --> 00:05:14,649
You should go.

76
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:16,191
I'll take care of the rest.

77
00:05:31,232 --> 00:05:32,524
I never came here.

78
00:05:35,441 --> 00:05:36,857
I never met my dad either.

79
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,857

00:05:46,024 --> 00:05:46,982
Are you okay?

81
00:05:47,066 --> 00:05:48,566
It's Dad! Seo Jin!

82
00:05:48,691 --> 00:05:49,733
Open the door!

83
00:05:49,857 --> 00:05:50,857
Get the master key.

84
00:05:50,899 --> 00:05:51,982
Give me the key.

85
00:05:52,066 --> 00:05:52,899
Can you come and open the door?

86
00:05:52,982 --> 00:05:53,857
Open this!

87
00:05:54,857 --> 00:05:55,940
- Seo Jin!
- Seo Jin.

88
00:05:56,024 --> 00:05:56,857
What happened?

89
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:57,816
- Seo Jin!
- Seo Jin!

90
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:58,733

91
00:05:58,816 --> 00:05:59,899

- Get her quick.

92
00:05:59,982 --> 00:06:00,857
Get her help.

93
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:01,816
Take her out quickly.

94
00:06:01,857 --> 00:06:02,733
- Over there.
- Hurry up!

95
00:06:02,816 --> 00:06:03,649
- Hurry.
- Go.

96
00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:04,691
Hurry up!

00:06:05,857 --> 00:06:06,857
The CT scan doesn't show

98
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:08,483
any external injury, Chief Director.

99
00:06:09,483 --> 00:06:10,399
What?

100
00:06:10,733 --> 00:06:12,232
Her body was covered in blood.

101
00:06:12,733 --> 00:06:13,649
The other girl's blood

102
00:06:13,733 --> 00:06:15,149
must have got on her as they fought.

103
00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:17,191
She has been thoroughly examined.

104
00:06:17,274 --> 00:06:18,316
You can be rest assured.

105
00:06:19,483 --> 00:06:20,441
But still,

106
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,857
make up something for her diagnosis.

107
00:06:23,608 --> 00:06:24,566
Yes, sir.

108
00:06:32,483 --> 00:06:33,691
Stop putting on an act and get up.

109
00:06:41,608 --> 00:06:42,691
Did you do that?

110
00:06:43,191 --> 00:06:45,191
Oh Yoon Hee bled a lot from the neck.

111
00:06:45,691 --> 00:06:47,149
I'm sorry, Dad.

112
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:51,066
But I couldn't take her anymore.

113
00:06:51,441 --> 00:06:54,149
She went on and even insulted you, so--

114
00:06:57,982 --> 00:06:58,899
Dad.

115
00:06:58,982 --> 00:07:00,483
Do you know why you were slapped?

116
00:07:02,816 --> 00:07:04,649
It's not because you hurt some girl.

117
00:07:06,107 --> 00:07:07,041
What you did wrong is

118
00:07:07,066 --> 00:07:08,274
losing to some girl like her.

119
00:07:09,483 --> 00:07:10,441
Why did you lose?

120
00:07:11,441 --> 00:07:13,066
You're the daughter of the chief director.

121
00:07:13,816 --> 00:07:14,691
But

122
00:07:15,316 --> 00:07:17,399
you let some poor girl without a dad win.

123
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,999
Do you have to make me

124
00:07:20,024 --> 00:07:21,441
fawn over the judges to let you win?

125
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,399
Is that all my daughter can do?

126
00:07:26,441 --> 00:07:27,524
I'm sorry, Dad.

127
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:28,733
I've done wrong.

128
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:31,399
Don't let this happen again.

129
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,940
You must be the best of the best.

130
00:07:34,649 --> 00:07:35,566
If you aren't,

131
00:07:35,899 --> 00:07:37,733
you don't deserve to take the foundation.

132
00:07:39,024 --> 00:07:39,940
Yes.

133
00:07:41,232 --> 00:07:42,816
I'll make sure I become the best.

134
00:08:05,316 --> 00:08:07,149
You turned me into this monster, Dad.

135
00:08:10,274 --> 00:08:12,399
So don't think that you died in vain.

136
00:08:15,524 --> 00:08:16,483
Since you're at least...

137
00:08:19,149 --> 00:08:20,691
leaving me this one thing.

138
00:08:38,024 --> 00:08:38,940
Hello?

139
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:43,399
Hey, Seo Young.

140
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:46,649
It's me.

141
00:08:54,608 --> 00:08:56,149
Don't just stand there.

142
00:08:56,232 --> 00:08:57,816
This can't be happening.

143
00:08:58,107 --> 00:09:00,107
Will you please do something?

144
00:09:01,191 --> 00:09:02,316
Do something.

145
00:09:02,524 --> 00:09:04,232
- Do something to save him.
- Honey.

146
00:09:04,816 --> 00:09:05,816
No.

147
00:09:07,483 --> 00:09:08,483
No, Dad.

148
00:09:08,566 --> 00:09:09,940
No, you can't go like this.

149
00:09:10,191 --> 00:09:11,483
No, Doctor.

150
00:09:11,566 --> 00:09:13,274
He's too young to die like this.

151
00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:14,857
No, honey!

152
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,940
Honey.

153
00:09:16,024 --> 00:09:18,441
- Honey!
- Dad.

154
00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:20,066
No, Dad.

155
00:09:20,191 --> 00:09:21,316
Honey.

156
00:09:21,566 --> 00:09:22,899
No, Doctor.

157
00:09:24,441 --> 00:09:25,441
Please save him.

158
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:27,232
Honey. No, honey.

159
00:09:28,107 --> 00:09:29,107
Honey.

160
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,857
Honey.

161
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,899
Seo Jin.

162
00:09:32,982 --> 00:09:33,857
Honey...

163
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,982
Seo Jin!

164
00:09:35,857 --> 00:09:38,274
Seo Jin. Seo Jin...

165
00:09:38,816 --> 00:09:40,232
- Seo Jin!
- What...

166
00:09:40,316 --> 00:09:41,566
No, Dad.

167
00:09:42,066 --> 00:09:43,024
- happened to him?
- Honey.

168
00:09:43,107 --> 00:09:45,024
He had acute myocardial infarction

169
00:09:45,107 --> 00:09:47,232
and fell down the stairs.

170
00:09:47,566 --> 00:09:48,566
Mr. Kang found him

171
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:49,857
and brought him to the hospital,

172
00:09:50,733 --> 00:09:51,816
but he already passed away

173
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:53,024
before he got here.

174
00:09:54,566 --> 00:09:55,441
Honey, open your eyes.

175
00:09:55,524 --> 00:09:57,857
How dare you humiliate me like that?

176
00:09:58,775 --> 00:10:00,857
You got a divorce and even had an affair?

177
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,357
You're a disgrace to our family.

178
00:10:02,441 --> 00:10:03,899
How dare you want Cheonga all to yourself?

179
00:10:05,524 --> 00:10:06,649
As of this moment,

180
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:09,149
you're removed from the board.

181
00:10:09,691 --> 00:10:10,899
And leave Cheonga Arts High School.

182
00:10:11,191 --> 00:10:12,857
You'll also have to return the inheritance

183
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:13,899
I've passed on to you.

184
00:10:14,857 --> 00:10:15,816
No.

185
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,107
- No!
- Cheonga belongs to Seo Young now.

186
00:10:19,132 --> 00:10:22,066
You're no longer my daughter!

187
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:23,066
No.

188
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:24,857
No!

189
00:10:25,274 --> 00:10:26,232
No!

190
00:10:26,691 --> 00:10:27,691
Seo Jin, calm down.

191
00:10:27,775 --> 00:10:28,857
This is a lie!

192
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:29,982
This can't be real!

193
00:10:30,357 --> 00:10:31,483
Why would my dad die?

194
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,899
Seo Jin...

195
00:10:35,691 --> 00:10:36,649
No!

196
00:10:36,857 --> 00:10:37,857
No!

197
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:45,566
- Seo Jin!
- Seo Jin!

198
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:46,608
Bring a bed.

199
00:10:47,816 --> 00:10:48,691
Now!

200
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:52,357
- Seo Jin...
- Seo Jin, wake up.

201
00:10:52,441 --> 00:10:53,775
- Seo Jin.
- Seo Jin.

202
00:10:53,857 --> 00:10:54,816
Wake up, Seo Jin.

203
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:56,274
- Seo Jin, please.
- Seo Jin.

204
00:10:56,357 --> 00:10:57,316
Seo Jin!

205
00:11:08,357 --> 00:11:09,357
I'm fine.

206
00:11:11,024 --> 00:11:11,982
Mum.

207
00:11:12,274 --> 00:11:13,857
You look really awful.

208
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:15,357
It looks like you'll collapse again.

209
00:11:15,857 --> 00:11:17,232
I'm fine.

210
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:20,524
Are you sure you're okay?

211
00:11:21,775 --> 00:11:23,066
You've been through a lot.

212
00:11:24,232 --> 00:11:25,899
You barely got any sleep for three days.

213
00:11:28,982 --> 00:11:30,441
I'll go get some rest.

214
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:37,274
Could you prepare some abalone porridge?

215
00:11:37,524 --> 00:11:39,733
She hasn't eaten for days.

216
00:11:40,191 --> 00:11:41,149
Yes, Dr. Ha.

217
00:11:53,982 --> 00:11:55,982
I felt so bad for her.

218
00:11:56,441 --> 00:11:58,857
Ms. Cheon is a heartless woman, you know.

219
00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:01,107
And seeing her break down like that

220
00:12:01,191 --> 00:12:02,274
at her father's death

221
00:12:02,357 --> 00:12:03,483
even broke my heart.

222
00:12:03,775 --> 00:12:04,775
How many times did she faint

223
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:05,775
at the funeral?

224
00:12:05,857 --> 00:12:06,775
Tell me about it.

225
00:12:06,857 --> 00:12:08,691
I was surprised to see she was on an IV

226
00:12:08,775 --> 00:12:10,024
and still stayed at the funeral hall.

227
00:12:10,441 --> 00:12:11,816
She was practically half-dead.

228
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:13,149
Why did he fall down

229
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,483
when his secretary wasn't with him?

230
00:12:14,816 --> 00:12:16,232
I heard he could've lived

231
00:12:16,316 --> 00:12:17,566
if he'd been found a bit earlier.

232
00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:19,274
He already had a weak heart.

233
00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:22,066
He was so concerned about his health,

234
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:23,857
enjoying his success and wealth.

235
00:12:24,274 --> 00:12:25,649
I can't believe he died

236
00:12:25,733 --> 00:12:26,857
out on the street in the rain.

237
00:12:27,024 --> 00:12:28,024
Who would believe that?

238
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,399
Anyway,

239
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:31,232
the chief director's position is vacant.

240
00:12:31,483 --> 00:12:33,816
Who'll become the next chief director?

241
00:12:33,857 --> 00:12:35,483
Come on, it has to be Seo Jin.

242
00:12:35,566 --> 00:12:37,316
He made an announcement before.

243
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:38,940
Then Ms. Cheon will rise up

244
00:12:39,232 --> 00:12:40,857
as the Sun King of Cheonga Arts High,

245
00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:43,899
the one who wields absolute power.

246
00:12:43,982 --> 00:12:47,191
Dr. Ha has the worst of luck in his life.

247
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,691
How can his wife be a bigger success

248
00:12:49,775 --> 00:12:51,149
as soon as they got a divorce?

249
00:12:51,441 --> 00:12:54,775
They really signed the divorce papers?

250
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,982
They split up for good?

251
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:58,232
You can't tell anyone.

252
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,399
They're keeping it low for Eun Byeol.

253
00:13:00,483 --> 00:13:01,649
They don't want her to get hurt.

254
00:13:02,316 --> 00:13:03,399
Nonsense.

255
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:05,191
She wouldn't get hurt at all.

256
00:13:05,316 --> 00:13:06,608
Didn't you see her doing her workbook

257
00:13:06,691 --> 00:13:07,857
lying on her stomach

258
00:13:07,982 --> 00:13:09,274
at her grandfather's funeral?

259
00:13:09,608 --> 00:13:11,441
That girl is even more tenacious

260
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:12,899
than her mum.

261
00:13:12,982 --> 00:13:14,608
Why does she study so hard?

262
00:13:14,857 --> 00:13:16,399
Once her mum becomes the chief director,

263
00:13:16,733 --> 00:13:18,399
she'll become the first place in school

264
00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:20,149
even if she sat there doing nothing.

265
00:13:20,441 --> 00:13:21,399
What a good girl.

266
00:13:23,107 --> 00:13:24,232
What do you mean?

267
00:13:24,649 --> 00:13:25,775
Why is it because of you?

268
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,816
I exposed

269
00:13:27,857 --> 00:13:29,649
Seo Jin's affair to the chief director,

270
00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:31,857
then he fell down that night.

271
00:13:32,441 --> 00:13:33,524
Maybe he was too shocked

272
00:13:33,608 --> 00:13:35,857
and had a cardiac arrest.

273
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,691
How did he react when you told him?

274
00:13:39,691 --> 00:13:41,399
He rebuked me instead.

275
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:43,066
He called me crass and rude.

276
00:13:44,733 --> 00:13:45,691
That's odd.

277
00:13:46,566 --> 00:13:47,775
People say

278
00:13:48,066 --> 00:13:49,441
he values his reputation and honour

279
00:13:49,524 --> 00:13:50,982
above anything.

280
00:13:51,857 --> 00:13:52,733
If he found out

281
00:13:52,816 --> 00:13:53,982
about his daughter's divorce and affair,

282
00:13:54,775 --> 00:13:56,691
he wouldn't have let her go in peace.

283
00:13:58,608 --> 00:14:00,940
Soo Ryeon, are you suspicious

284
00:14:01,316 --> 00:14:02,357
of Seo Jin right now?

285
00:14:05,441 --> 00:14:06,733
She benefitted the most

286
00:14:07,024 --> 00:14:09,024
through the chief director's death.

287
00:14:10,232 --> 00:14:11,733
She covered up her shame

288
00:14:12,232 --> 00:14:13,816
and became the chief director.

289
00:14:16,274 --> 00:14:17,733
And the CCTV at Cheonga High

290
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:19,399
broke down two days before his death.

291
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,107
It's a bit odd to be a coincidence.

292
00:14:24,441 --> 00:14:25,566
I'll look into this.

293
00:14:41,857 --> 00:14:43,733
Find out who was on duty as the guard

294
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,483
on the day Cheonga's chief director died.

295
00:14:46,232 --> 00:14:47,816
Cheon Seo Jin is involved in this.

296
00:14:47,857 --> 00:14:50,357
"Mr. Gu Ho Dong"

297
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:52,232
I'll do it as soon as I get to school.

298
00:15:01,232 --> 00:15:02,691
"Security Office"

299
00:15:02,775 --> 00:15:06,066
Goodness, good work, sir.

300
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,816
Have this energy drink

301
00:15:07,857 --> 00:15:09,816
and take it easy, here.

302
00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:11,566
Goodness, thank you, Mr. Gu.

303
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:13,149
Don't mention it. Take this.

304
00:15:15,483 --> 00:15:16,524
Anyway,

305
00:15:16,857 --> 00:15:19,316
I haven't seen Mr. Choi for a few days.

306
00:15:20,232 --> 00:15:21,316
Wasn't he on night duty

307
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:22,357
on the night the chief director died?

308
00:15:24,066 --> 00:15:25,399
Was he too shocked?

309
00:15:25,816 --> 00:15:26,857
He quit.

310
00:15:27,066 --> 00:15:28,816
What? Why?

311
00:15:29,191 --> 00:15:30,857
He became a chief manager somewhere,

312
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,524
and I heard he'll be paid a hefty amount.

313
00:15:32,608 --> 00:15:33,566
Really?

314
00:15:34,775 --> 00:15:35,733
Where did he go?

315
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,107
I have no idea.

316
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:38,691
Maybe he won the lottery.

317
00:15:39,149 --> 00:15:40,857
He even changed his number too.

318
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,691
I see. Is that so?

319
00:15:45,107 --> 00:15:47,566
Anyway, good for him, then.

320
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:50,857
I'm so out of it.

321
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:52,274
Please excuse me.

322
00:15:52,441 --> 00:15:53,691
- Thank you for the drink.
- Sure.

323
00:15:53,775 --> 00:15:54,982
- Take care.
- Bye.

324
00:15:59,816 --> 00:16:01,857
He changed his phone number too?

325
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,399
Did you take care of everything?

326
00:16:05,982 --> 00:16:07,816
I made Attorney Park keep his mouth shut.

327
00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:09,024
Did you meet the school guard

328
00:16:09,107 --> 00:16:10,066
who was on night duty that night?

329
00:16:10,816 --> 00:16:11,733
Keep his mouth shut

330
00:16:11,816 --> 00:16:12,982
so that he won't say anything weird.

331
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,524
I already got him another job.

332
00:16:17,316 --> 00:16:19,316
I'll make sure he doesn't cause a problem.

333
00:16:20,066 --> 00:16:21,107
Thanks for your help.

334
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:24,357
I'll repay you, Secretary Do.

335
00:16:34,483 --> 00:16:35,399
What are you doing?

336
00:16:36,066 --> 00:16:37,608
Why are you here?

337
00:16:38,024 --> 00:16:39,316
I was worried about you.

338
00:16:40,608 --> 00:16:41,566
Are you feeling better?

339
00:16:42,608 --> 00:16:43,940
I'm fine. You can go.

340
00:16:46,191 --> 00:16:47,399
And if you have no business,

341
00:16:47,483 --> 00:16:49,441
do not come into my room.

342
00:16:50,691 --> 00:16:51,608
I'll stay away.

343
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:55,857
You finished

344
00:16:56,483 --> 00:16:57,441
your porridge.

345
00:17:00,191 --> 00:17:01,191
You must've been hungry.

346
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:04,274
I needed to get the energy.

347
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:05,399
I had no other choice.

348
00:17:10,357 --> 00:17:11,274
Wait.

349
00:17:14,899 --> 00:17:15,940
What happened to your hand?

350
00:17:18,107 --> 00:17:19,191
How did you get hurt?

351
00:17:22,399 --> 00:17:23,816
I fell down by mistake.

352
00:17:24,982 --> 00:17:25,857
It's nothing.

353
00:17:27,733 --> 00:17:28,733
Where were you

354
00:17:30,107 --> 00:17:31,316
on that night?

355
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,191
The night your father passed away.

356
00:17:39,441 --> 00:17:41,566
I was practising in the lesson room,

357
00:17:42,232 --> 00:17:43,232
with Secretary Do.

358
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:47,566
What do you want to find out from me?

359
00:17:51,316 --> 00:17:52,857
No, it's nothing.

360
00:17:53,399 --> 00:17:54,232
Get some rest.

361
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:13,232
Did you meet the school guard

362
00:18:13,316 --> 00:18:14,274
who was on night duty that night?

363
00:18:14,816 --> 00:18:15,649
Keep his mouth shut

364
00:18:15,733 --> 00:18:16,649
so that he won't say anything weird.

365
00:18:19,274 --> 00:18:21,483
No, she couldn't have.

366
00:18:22,357 --> 00:18:23,899
That just can't happen.

367
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:28,483
I have to talk to you.

368
00:18:31,857 --> 00:18:33,441
The funeral is over,

369
00:18:33,775 --> 00:18:35,733
so pack up and leave as promised.

370
00:18:37,441 --> 00:18:38,441
What are you talking about?

371
00:18:38,691 --> 00:18:39,857
I told you about Eun Byeol's state.

372
00:18:39,899 --> 00:18:41,274
She needs more therapy.

373
00:18:41,357 --> 00:18:42,232
Will you use her

374
00:18:42,316 --> 00:18:43,816
as an excuse to stay here?

375
00:18:46,149 --> 00:18:47,857
We were going to keep our divorce secret

376
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:48,940
only until the moment

377
00:18:49,024 --> 00:18:50,066
I become the chief director.

378
00:18:51,566 --> 00:18:53,357
There's no reason to hide this anymore.

379
00:18:53,816 --> 00:18:55,107
She's ill.

380
00:18:55,566 --> 00:18:57,441
Your impossible expectations are

381
00:18:57,524 --> 00:18:59,274
eating her alive from the inside!

382
00:18:59,357 --> 00:19:00,399
Eun Byeol isn't

383
00:19:01,191 --> 00:19:03,191
a weakling like you.

384
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:05,775
I can take care of her mental health.

385
00:19:06,232 --> 00:19:08,816
If you got seven billion won as alimony,

386
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:10,232
shouldn't you show some courtesy

387
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:11,316
and leave quietly?

388
00:19:13,024 --> 00:19:14,483
Mum, Dad, you two got divorced?

389
00:19:17,107 --> 00:19:18,024
Eun Byeol.

390
00:19:18,274 --> 00:19:19,982
No, it's not like that, Eun Byeol.

391
00:19:20,066 --> 00:19:21,274
I was going to tell you after your test,

392
00:19:21,357 --> 00:19:22,191
but you already heard me,

393
00:19:22,274 --> 00:19:23,191
so you leave me no choice.

394
00:19:23,483 --> 00:19:24,899
We got divorced.

395
00:19:25,024 --> 00:19:26,107
Dad isn't going to live here anymore.

396
00:19:26,191 --> 00:19:27,232
It's settled.

397
00:19:28,733 --> 00:19:30,524
No, he can't go.

398
00:19:30,691 --> 00:19:31,691
Are you telling me to live

399
00:19:31,775 --> 00:19:33,066
as a girl without a dad like Ro Na?

400
00:19:33,399 --> 00:19:35,274
Other kids are going to talk.

401
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:37,524
Just put up a show and live together.

402
00:19:37,857 --> 00:19:39,899
Please don't split up.

403
00:19:40,775 --> 00:19:41,649
Mum.

404
00:19:41,733 --> 00:19:43,691
Can you give him one more chance?

405
00:19:43,857 --> 00:19:45,816
He has been good to us lately.

406
00:19:46,357 --> 00:19:47,733
Everything is settled already.

407
00:19:48,566 --> 00:19:49,857
We just won't live together.

408
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:50,857
You're still free to meet him

409
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:51,816
whenever you want.

410
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,066
I still don't want this to happen!

411
00:19:53,816 --> 00:19:55,524
Dad, don't go.

412
00:19:55,608 --> 00:19:56,857
You have to live with me.

413
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,107
Don't go anywhere.

414
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:00,775
Don't worry, Eun Byeol.

415
00:20:00,982 --> 00:20:02,024
I won't go anywhere.

416
00:20:02,107 --> 00:20:03,357
I'll stay by your side.

417
00:20:06,441 --> 00:20:07,399
You're now the daughter

418
00:20:07,483 --> 00:20:08,524
of Cheonga Foundation's chief director!

419
00:20:08,649 --> 00:20:09,982
You're Cheon Seo Jin's daughter!

420
00:20:10,566 --> 00:20:12,775
Someone like Ro Na isn't a match for you.

421
00:20:13,316 --> 00:20:15,524
Your dad was nothing but an accessory

422
00:20:15,608 --> 00:20:17,149
that you can live without.

423
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:19,107
I'm all you need.

424
00:20:19,316 --> 00:20:20,566
You've got your mum here

425
00:20:20,649 --> 00:20:21,608
who can do everything for you!

426
00:20:21,899 --> 00:20:23,857
I need Dad in my life too!

427
00:20:24,107 --> 00:20:25,232
I don't want that brat

428
00:20:25,316 --> 00:20:27,024
to take my dad away from me!

429
00:20:27,733 --> 00:20:28,608
What?

430
00:20:29,857 --> 00:20:31,107
I know everything already.

431
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:34,399
You're leaving me to live with Ro Na.

432
00:20:35,483 --> 00:20:36,399
You're disgusting.

433
00:20:37,483 --> 00:20:39,316
It's not like that, Eun Byeol.

434
00:20:40,566 --> 00:20:42,316
Don't be so immature, Eun Byeol.

435
00:20:42,649 --> 00:20:43,649
You can't turn back anything

436
00:20:43,733 --> 00:20:44,899
by throwing a fit.

437
00:20:46,024 --> 00:20:47,399
Get back in there and study!

438
00:20:47,775 --> 00:20:48,691
You already lost minutes of time

439
00:20:48,775 --> 00:20:49,857
over this unnecessary argument.

440
00:20:52,232 --> 00:20:54,316
You can't do this to me.

441
00:20:55,066 --> 00:20:57,399
I'm not going to let him go.

442
00:20:57,816 --> 00:20:59,857
Once he leaves, I'm leaving too!

443
00:21:02,274 --> 00:21:03,691
Eun Byeol. Eun Byeol!

444
00:21:03,899 --> 00:21:04,816
Eun Byeol!

445
00:21:07,816 --> 00:21:08,775
Ha Eun Byeol.

446
00:21:11,649 --> 00:21:12,566
You.

447
00:21:12,857 --> 00:21:14,857
Do you have to take things this far?

448
00:21:16,232 --> 00:21:17,608
We already agreed upon this.

449
00:21:18,316 --> 00:21:20,024
Shut up and pack up your things.

450
00:21:38,899 --> 00:21:39,899
You and your smoking habit.

451
00:21:41,357 --> 00:21:42,607
You still haven't quit?

452
00:21:44,024 --> 00:21:45,149
Things keep happening

453
00:21:45,399 --> 00:21:46,399
whenever I try to quit.

454
00:21:52,691 --> 00:21:55,024
Did the tough days go by all right?

455
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:00,649
How's Seo Jin?

456
00:22:02,233 --> 00:22:04,482
She's fine. Completely.

457
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:06,316
By any chance,

458
00:22:07,275 --> 00:22:09,191
did she tell you?

459
00:22:12,357 --> 00:22:14,191
On the day the chief director died,

460
00:22:15,566 --> 00:22:18,024
she met him with me.

461
00:22:19,191 --> 00:22:20,191
With Father?

462
00:22:20,649 --> 00:22:21,607
Why did he see you?

463
00:22:21,816 --> 00:22:22,899
He found out everything

464
00:22:23,857 --> 00:22:25,399
before he passed away.

465
00:22:27,149 --> 00:22:29,233
He found out his daughter is divorced

466
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,399
and...

467
00:22:33,275 --> 00:22:34,233
she is having an affair

468
00:22:34,816 --> 00:22:36,399
with Joo Dan Tae too.

469
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,399
Thanks for coming to the funeral.

470
00:22:46,149 --> 00:22:47,857
I'm sorry for what happened to him.

471
00:22:48,399 --> 00:22:49,816
He's still too young to die.

472
00:22:51,024 --> 00:22:52,066
Did you get some rest?

473
00:22:52,233 --> 00:22:53,607
I don't have any time to rest.

474
00:22:54,108 --> 00:22:55,607
There's a lot of work with the foundation,

475
00:22:55,691 --> 00:22:56,857
so I've been busy.

476
00:22:57,149 --> 00:22:58,191
The inauguration ceremony

477
00:22:58,275 --> 00:22:59,566
will be held after the board meeting,

478
00:23:00,191 --> 00:23:01,066
but the transition began,

479
00:23:01,149 --> 00:23:02,774
so I have to get to work right away.

480
00:23:04,191 --> 00:23:05,816
Of course the board will say yes.

481
00:23:05,899 --> 00:23:07,024
They will.

482
00:23:07,524 --> 00:23:08,524
There's no reason for Mum

483
00:23:08,607 --> 00:23:09,774
or Seo Young to oppose my appointment.

484
00:23:12,482 --> 00:23:14,399
I finally got everything

485
00:23:15,066 --> 00:23:16,607
I ever wanted,

486
00:23:17,691 --> 00:23:18,983
except for you.

487
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,688
I miss your touch...

488
00:23:25,691 --> 00:23:27,309
to death right now.

489
00:23:28,257 --> 00:23:29,799
I'll wait at the villa tomorrow night.

490
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,095
Don't work too hard.

491
00:23:33,491 --> 00:23:34,408
Bye.

492
00:23:41,033 --> 00:23:42,491
"Wiretapping in progress"

493
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:01,224
You look as if you're going to a party.

494
00:24:01,683 --> 00:24:02,950
You're going to work dressed like that

495
00:24:02,975 --> 00:24:04,391
as soon as his funeral is over?

496
00:24:05,891 --> 00:24:06,933
It looks as if

497
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:09,032
you've been waiting

498
00:24:09,057 --> 00:24:10,266
for your father's death.

499
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,140
Watch what you say.

500
00:24:16,849 --> 00:24:18,474
I'm just hoping you won't commit

501
00:24:18,933 --> 00:24:20,224
an even bigger crime as a mother

502
00:24:20,307 --> 00:24:21,349
who has a daughter.

503
00:24:21,516 --> 00:24:23,307
I wasn't going to say this to you,

504
00:24:24,182 --> 00:24:25,724
but the one who killed my father is...

505
00:24:27,266 --> 00:24:28,224
you.

506
00:24:29,808 --> 00:24:30,891
I'm holding myself back

507
00:24:30,975 --> 00:24:32,099
to avoid making a noise.

508
00:24:32,516 --> 00:24:34,474
Lie low unless you want me to sue you.

509
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:36,099
Are you blaming me right now?

510
00:24:37,891 --> 00:24:39,557
Then who had an affair?

511
00:24:40,307 --> 00:24:42,516
Who's the one that caused his fall?

512
00:24:42,541 --> 00:24:44,156
Complete your daughter's withdrawal

513
00:24:44,181 --> 00:24:45,641
before you mind our family business.

514
00:24:45,975 --> 00:24:46,891
You look pathetic

515
00:24:46,975 --> 00:24:48,057
to lurk around hoping for a change.

516
00:24:49,057 --> 00:24:50,099
Your daughter is

hopeless anyway.

Now that she dropped out,

519
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,641
it might help her to learn her place

Don't be so sure.

We'll have to wait and see

who'll end up leaving this building.

This is Kyu Jin's heart, Ms. Cheon.

How can she be like that as a human?

Tell me about it.

00:31:25,349 --> 00:31:26,933
Seok Kyung is stressed out about midterms.

686
00:31:27,432 --> 00:31:29,182
There's nothing I can do to help as a dad.

687
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,891
It's so heartbreaking.

688
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,975
Yes, of course it is.

689
00:31:34,057 --> 00:31:35,474
It must have been so painful.

690
00:31:36,057 --> 00:31:38,724
So what can I do to help?

691
00:31:40,266 --> 00:31:41,182
The test.

692
00:31:42,307 --> 00:31:43,182
Pardon?

693
00:31:45,933 --> 00:31:47,182
"CEO Joo Dan Tae"

694
00:31:47,266 --> 00:31:48,140
What's up?

695
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:50,474
I need your help.

696
00:31:51,391 --> 00:31:52,849
I can't do this on my own.

697
00:31:53,307 --> 00:31:54,724
I don't care if you kick me out abroad.

698
00:31:54,933 --> 00:31:55,849
But...

699
00:31:56,933 --> 00:31:59,099
I don't want to lose against Eun Byeol.

700
00:32:01,808 --> 00:32:02,808
You know,

701
00:32:03,266 --> 00:32:04,891
I can't bear to see my children

702
00:32:04,975 --> 00:32:06,057
lose to someone,

703
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:07,516
even if

704
00:32:08,016 --> 00:32:08,975
she's up against Eun Byeol.

705
00:32:09,683 --> 00:32:11,182
So...

706
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:12,891
are you asking me

707
00:32:12,975 --> 00:32:15,057
to leak out the test papers?

708
00:32:15,766 --> 00:32:17,808
But this is too dangerous, so...

709
00:32:29,557 --> 00:32:31,516
What is this?

710
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:32,808
Open up.

711
00:32:39,266 --> 00:32:40,766
I never abandon anyone

712
00:32:40,849 --> 00:32:41,891
once I take them in on my side.

713
00:32:42,266 --> 00:32:43,224
If you promise to help

714
00:32:43,349 --> 00:32:44,766
with Seok Kyung's tests for three years,

715
00:32:45,474 --> 00:32:47,474
I'll be your retirement plan.

716
00:32:47,891 --> 00:32:49,057
Until the day I die?

717
00:32:57,724 --> 00:32:58,975
I hope Seok Kyung won't have a problem

718
00:32:59,224 --> 00:33:00,266
on her test tomorrow.

719
00:33:12,933 --> 00:33:14,432
Goodbye, Chairman Joo.

720
00:33:14,766 --> 00:33:15,891
I love you!

721
00:33:17,182 --> 00:33:18,557
That dirty jerk.

722
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:22,891
"JKING Holdings"

723
00:33:22,975 --> 00:33:24,016
Joint investment?

724
00:33:24,683 --> 00:33:25,557
Yes.

725
00:33:25,641 --> 00:33:27,016
Mr. Lee suggests

726
00:33:27,057 --> 00:33:29,016
we join him in this investment.

727
00:33:29,766 --> 00:33:31,307
It seems like

728
00:33:31,391 --> 00:33:32,724
he concluded the Myeong-dong lot is

729
00:33:32,808 --> 00:33:34,140
more suitable as a hotel

730
00:33:34,224 --> 00:33:36,224
and a casino business for tourists

731
00:33:36,474 --> 00:33:37,766
than a shopping district.

732
00:33:39,349 --> 00:33:40,557
A casino business?

733
00:33:40,683 --> 00:33:42,266
In Singapore,

734
00:33:42,349 --> 00:33:44,099
the hotel and casino in the city centre

735
00:33:44,182 --> 00:33:46,140
brought in a huge number of tourists--

736
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:47,933
It's not like I'm not aware of that.

737
00:33:48,016 --> 00:33:49,349
But do you think it'll be easy

738
00:33:49,432 --> 00:33:51,016
to get the casino business approved?

739
00:33:51,057 --> 00:33:52,224
And in the middle of Seoul?

740
00:33:52,432 --> 00:33:53,599
Logan, maybe you aren't well-versed

741
00:33:53,683 --> 00:33:54,808
in how business is done in Korea.

742
00:33:55,849 --> 00:33:57,016
This is my business.

743
00:33:57,224 --> 00:33:58,474
If I didn't have the confidence

744
00:33:58,557 --> 00:33:59,724
to do it in the first place,

745
00:34:00,557 --> 00:34:01,557
I wouldn't have done it.

746
00:34:04,808 --> 00:34:05,724
Now.

747
00:34:06,182 --> 00:34:07,599
This is a business outline

748
00:34:07,683 --> 00:34:09,140
for hotels and casinos

749
00:34:09,307 --> 00:34:10,557
that I'm pushing in New York

750
00:34:10,808 --> 00:34:11,808
and in Seoul.

751
00:34:12,557 --> 00:34:13,808
The estimated budget,

752
00:34:14,766 --> 00:34:15,683
one billion.

753
00:34:17,683 --> 00:34:18,641
Dollars.

754
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:22,432
And since I'm staying in America

755
00:34:22,516 --> 00:34:23,599
most of the time,

756
00:34:23,766 --> 00:34:24,599
and

757
00:34:24,683 --> 00:34:26,724
for better business operations in Korea,

758
00:34:27,057 --> 00:34:28,266
I'm offering you

759
00:34:28,975 --> 00:34:30,016
to be my co-investor.

760
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:34,391
That's over one trillion won.

761
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:40,057
Listen, you have to understand.

762
00:34:40,099 --> 00:34:42,266
This is a massive business idea,

763
00:34:42,432 --> 00:34:43,849
and I'm on the verge of contracting

764
00:34:43,933 --> 00:34:45,808
with some of the biggest, and I mean big,

765
00:34:46,307 --> 00:34:48,432
big corporations, okay?

766
00:34:48,975 --> 00:34:50,016
I only came here today

767
00:34:50,057 --> 00:34:51,432
because Ms. Oh asked me to come.

768
00:34:52,057 --> 00:34:53,016
It was a favour.

769
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:54,641
If you don't want to do it,

770
00:34:55,307 --> 00:34:56,182
you don't have to.

771
00:34:57,057 --> 00:34:57,975
Let's go.

772
00:34:58,808 --> 00:34:59,975
Give me some time to look into this.

773
00:35:00,057 --> 00:35:00,933
No.

774
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:02,683
No.

775
00:35:03,057 --> 00:35:05,432
Business is about information.

776
00:35:06,057 --> 00:35:08,683
Which is something that you don't have.

777
00:35:10,683 --> 00:35:11,933
"JKING Holdings"

778
00:35:12,016 --> 00:35:13,891
Logan, one second.

779
00:35:16,683 --> 00:35:18,057
Will you give this up?

780
00:35:18,849 --> 00:35:20,683
Oseong Group is dying to get this project.

781
00:35:20,766 --> 00:35:22,557
It wasn't easy to get this meeting.

782
00:35:23,057 --> 00:35:23,975
Oseong Group?

783
00:35:28,724 --> 00:35:30,391
"Oseong Group Jumps into Hotel-Casino"

784
00:35:30,516 --> 00:35:32,057
"Oseong and Logan Lee is about to sign..."

785
00:35:32,933 --> 00:35:34,724
Is something moving forward already?

786
00:35:35,016 --> 00:35:36,057
There are a number of articles

787
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,349
that were published this afternoon,

788
00:35:37,849 --> 00:35:39,516
and Oseong's stock price skyrocketed.

789
00:35:41,016 --> 00:35:42,057
Call Logan immediately

790
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,057
and get me a dinner meeting.

791
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,266
Do whatever it takes

792
00:35:44,349 --> 00:35:46,307
to have him seated before me.

793
00:35:46,391 --> 00:35:47,266
Do you understand?

794
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:48,349
I'll trust what you can do.

795
00:35:49,724 --> 00:35:51,057
He probably hasn't left yet.

796
00:35:59,975 --> 00:36:01,307
I have 150 billion won

797
00:36:01,391 --> 00:36:02,766
tied up in Myeong-dong right now.

798
00:36:03,474 --> 00:36:05,016
If I can free that up

799
00:36:05,057 --> 00:36:07,307
and join his casino business,

800
00:36:08,808 --> 00:36:09,933
I'll rake in

801
00:36:10,641 --> 00:36:12,724
at least 50 million dollars a year.

802
00:36:14,808 --> 00:36:16,516
"Jakomo"

803
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:25,933
"Compose new message"

804
00:36:28,016 --> 00:36:29,683
"Please check the email I sent"

805
00:36:30,016 --> 00:36:32,057
I knew it. This is it!

806
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,182
It's so nice.

807
00:36:33,349 --> 00:36:35,474
I wonder what it's made of.

808
00:36:35,557 --> 00:36:37,140
It's incredibly soft.

809
00:36:37,224 --> 00:36:38,391
You're here.

810
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:39,975
Yes! My gosh.

811
00:36:40,474 --> 00:36:42,766
Well, Sang A

812
00:36:42,849 --> 00:36:44,557
wants to buy a new couch.

813
00:36:45,516 --> 00:36:47,349
This is made of the finest material

814
00:36:47,432 --> 00:36:49,266
and also has the highest repurchase rate.

815
00:36:49,474 --> 00:36:50,557
Let me see.

816
00:36:51,182 --> 00:36:52,516
My gosh.

817
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:54,307
- This is the one.
- Where will you put it?

818
00:36:55,016 --> 00:36:56,182
Well...

819
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,391
In my husband's study.

820
00:36:58,474 --> 00:37:00,057
Yes, the study.

821
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,266
"Mr. Gu Ho Dong"

822
00:37:01,641 --> 00:37:02,724
Excuse me for a second.

823
00:37:02,808 --> 00:37:04,182
Gosh, no worries.

824
00:37:04,349 --> 00:37:06,224
Don't mind us and just answer it.

825
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:07,599
Go on.

826
00:37:10,975 --> 00:37:12,099
I'm sure he'll take the bait

827
00:37:12,182 --> 00:37:13,140
because of the money

828
00:37:13,224 --> 00:37:14,891
he's invested in the lot in Myeong-dong.

829
00:37:16,099 --> 00:37:17,391
For a joint investment,

830
00:37:17,516 --> 00:37:19,516
you'll have to start a new company.

831
00:37:19,766 --> 00:37:21,641
Right, I've already thought of something.

832
00:37:21,724 --> 00:37:23,057
He doesn't trust people easily.

833
00:37:23,182 --> 00:37:24,683
You must make sure the executives

834
00:37:24,808 --> 00:37:26,307
of Oseong Group are all in on this.

835
00:37:26,474 --> 00:37:28,266
Chairman Park and I go back a long way,

836
00:37:28,349 --> 00:37:29,641
so I'm sure he'll help me out.

837
00:37:29,849 --> 00:37:30,808
More importantly,

838
00:37:31,016 --> 00:37:32,849
do you have a full list of Joo Dan Tae's

839
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,849
real estate properties and total assets?

840
00:37:35,057 --> 00:37:36,140
No.

841
00:37:36,724 --> 00:37:38,849
He keeps it strictly hidden from me.

842
00:37:41,016 --> 00:37:42,057
Oh, right.

843
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:44,224
In his study, there's a secret room

844
00:37:44,349 --> 00:37:45,641
only he can enter.

845
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:48,933
That's probably where he's keeping

846
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:50,391
all the related documents.

847
00:37:51,724 --> 00:37:52,849
But you can't go in

848
00:37:52,975 --> 00:37:54,307
without his fingerprint.

849
00:37:54,766 --> 00:37:55,849
Fingerprint?

850
00:37:57,057 --> 00:37:58,849
Don't worry. I have an idea.

851
00:37:59,557 --> 00:38:01,307
Hey, wait.

852
00:38:03,891 --> 00:38:05,766
Looks like he's taken the bait.

853
00:38:07,641 --> 00:38:10,683
Can we have a quick talk?

854
00:38:36,391 --> 00:38:37,849
Cheon Seo Jin.

855
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:47,182
Dad.

856
00:38:51,849 --> 00:38:53,307
You're a murderer.

857
00:38:54,474 --> 00:38:57,182
You do not deserve this trophy!

858
00:38:57,766 --> 00:38:59,683
No, it's mine!

859
00:39:20,641 --> 00:39:22,099
Stop tormenting me!

860
00:39:23,808 --> 00:39:26,266
You're dead. You're already dead!

861
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:30,724
Cheonga Foundation is mine!

862
00:39:31,349 --> 00:39:33,099
Ms. Cheon.

863
00:39:33,641 --> 00:39:34,849
My gosh.

864
00:39:38,016 --> 00:39:39,808
You're still here?

865
00:39:40,933 --> 00:39:42,016
What's the matter?

866
00:39:42,182 --> 00:39:43,391
Eun Byeol

867
00:39:43,516 --> 00:39:45,391
is such a strong person mentally.

868
00:39:45,474 --> 00:39:46,975
After Mr. Cheon passed away,

869
00:39:47,057 --> 00:39:50,099
I was worried it'd affect her exam scores,

870
00:39:50,182 --> 00:39:51,975
but she aced all three exams

871
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:52,975
she took today.

872
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,266
As for Seok Kyung,

873
00:39:54,432 --> 00:39:55,724
she bombed her exams.

874
00:39:56,057 --> 00:39:57,057
Really?

875
00:39:57,391 --> 00:39:58,516
She studied hard.

876
00:39:58,933 --> 00:39:59,975
I'm glad.

877
00:40:01,057 --> 00:40:02,057
But...

878
00:40:05,224 --> 00:40:06,474
I understand.

879
00:40:07,432 --> 00:40:09,099
You must be devastated.

880
00:40:09,849 --> 00:40:11,182
I'll clean this up for you.

881
00:40:13,182 --> 00:40:14,474
I'd appreciate that.

882
00:40:17,516 --> 00:40:19,224
I have plans.

883
00:40:19,307 --> 00:40:22,266
Don't worry about a thing. Just get going.

You're looking for

891
00:41:09,808 --> 00:41:10,808
a jacket for men, right?

892
00:41:10,891 --> 00:41:11,808
How about this one?

893
00:41:11,891 --> 00:41:13,474
The colour is exquisite.

894
00:41:13,683 --> 00:41:14,724
It's nice.

895
00:41:15,057 --> 00:41:16,140
I'll take this one too.

896
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,140
I'll take all of them.

897
00:41:21,975 --> 00:41:23,849
Can we reschedule our dinner this evening?

898
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:25,266
Something came up.

899
00:41:29,182 --> 00:41:30,224
Where are you now?

900
00:41:30,516 --> 00:41:31,599
You promised we'd meet up tonight.

901
00:41:32,474 --> 00:41:33,391
Next time.

902
00:41:33,516 --> 00:41:34,808
I can't get out of this.

903
00:41:34,933 --> 00:41:36,641
Forget about next time. Meet me now!

904
00:41:37,474 --> 00:41:39,432
I need you now.

905
00:41:41,266 --> 00:41:42,975
You know what I'm going through.

906
00:41:43,975 --> 00:41:44,891
Come to the villa.

907
00:41:45,057 --> 00:41:46,099
I'll be waiting.

908
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,266
Sorry.

909
00:41:53,516 --> 00:41:54,683
Your wife?

910
00:41:55,391 --> 00:41:57,224
You guys seem to adore each other.

911
00:41:57,432 --> 00:41:59,224
Well, yes.

912
00:42:00,182 --> 00:42:01,474
Then you two have agreed

913
00:42:01,557 --> 00:42:02,849
to this joint investment.

914
00:42:02,975 --> 00:42:04,599
You can't change your mind now.

915
00:42:04,724 --> 00:42:06,057
No turning back.

916
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:09,266
Again, I'm convinced by Ms. Oh.

917
00:42:10,266 --> 00:42:11,808
I'm glad I could be of help.

918
00:42:11,891 --> 00:42:13,057
It's such an honour.

919
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:17,557
To celebrate this, how about

920
00:42:17,641 --> 00:42:18,766
we drink this bottom up?

921
00:42:20,266 --> 00:42:21,516
Why don't we give it a try?

922
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:23,641
Salute.

923
00:42:29,933 --> 00:42:31,016
That's nice.

924
00:42:31,224 --> 00:42:33,266
With this MOU and everything else,

925
00:42:34,683 --> 00:42:36,224
I'm curious as to how Ms. Oh managed

926
00:42:36,307 --> 00:42:38,808
to move your heart and convince you.

927
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:41,975
Well, I would say...

928
00:42:42,975 --> 00:42:44,349
her bravery?

929
00:42:44,766 --> 00:42:46,266
There are many smart people out there,

930
00:42:46,349 --> 00:42:48,557
but brave? Not so much.

931
00:42:48,849 --> 00:42:50,016
Bravery?

932
00:42:51,808 --> 00:42:53,016
Excuse me.

933
00:42:56,099 --> 00:42:59,224
Unfortunately, something urgent came up.

934
00:43:00,224 --> 00:43:01,599
Is it okay to leave you two alone?

935
00:43:01,933 --> 00:43:02,849
Yes, of course.

936
00:43:02,933 --> 00:43:04,224
We have plenty of time.

937
00:43:04,391 --> 00:43:05,808
Yes, please excuse me.

938
00:43:05,891 --> 00:43:06,975
Oh, wait a second.

939
00:43:15,641 --> 00:43:17,057
It's a present.

940
00:43:17,432 --> 00:43:18,474
Oh, thank you.

941
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:19,891
I appreciate it.

942
00:43:20,724 --> 00:43:21,599
Talk to you soon.

943
00:43:21,683 --> 00:43:22,766
Okay.

944

"Success, fingerprint scanned"

945
00:43:49,057 --> 00:43:50,099
Yes, it's ready now.

946
00:43:50,307 --> 00:43:51,474
I'll be on my way.

947
00:43:52,057 --> 00:43:53,140
Here you go, sir.

948
00:44:00,099 --> 00:44:01,516
I'm performance-oriented,

949
00:44:01,975 --> 00:44:02,808
so I always reward

950
00:44:02,891 --> 00:44:04,099
those who produce good results.

951
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:06,808
So I'd like to promote you

952
00:44:06,891 --> 00:44:08,724
to manager of the investment team.

953
00:44:09,891 --> 00:44:11,099
Seriously?

954
00:44:11,266 --> 00:44:12,391
Please keep up the great work.

955
00:44:12,933 --> 00:44:14,975
Our past doesn't matter to me.

956
00:44:15,099 --> 00:44:16,349
What matters is that

957
00:44:16,683 --> 00:44:18,016
I need you right now.

958
00:44:20,516 --> 00:44:21,766
I'll do my best.

959
00:44:22,933 --> 00:44:24,057
I hope you're not getting tipsy yet.

960
00:44:24,849 --> 00:44:25,975
I'm just getting started.

961
00:44:27,099 --> 00:44:28,432
You may never guess this about me,

962
00:44:29,307 --> 00:44:30,474
but I can hold my liquor very well.

963
00:44:31,349 --> 00:44:32,724
Tipsy? Not at all.

964
00:44:43,933 --> 00:44:45,557
- Excuse me for a moment.
- Sure.

965
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:50,683
Are you okay?

966
00:44:51,016 --> 00:44:52,766
Yes, I'm okay. Gosh, this is bad.

967
00:44:52,849 --> 00:44:53,891
I'm sorry.

968
00:44:53,975 --> 00:44:55,224
There's a first-aid kit in my car.

969
00:44:56,099 --> 00:44:56,975
Secretary Cho, where are you?

970
00:44:57,057 --> 00:44:57,975
Are you all right?

971
00:44:58,057 --> 00:44:59,224
- Yes, I'm... My gosh!
- Oh, no!

972
00:45:00,891 --> 00:45:02,349
I'm sorry, sir.

973
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:03,891
Are you all right?

974
00:45:04,391 --> 00:45:05,516
I'm so sorry.

975
00:45:07,474 --> 00:45:08,557
My gosh.

976
00:45:12,307 --> 00:45:14,140
Sir, are you okay?

977
00:45:16,641 --> 00:45:17,933
No.

978
00:45:18,516 --> 00:45:20,724
Please don't die, Mum.

979
00:45:23,474 --> 00:45:25,224
Stop.

980
00:45:28,933 --> 00:45:30,057
Sir!

981
00:45:30,391 --> 00:45:31,849
- Sir, are you okay?
- Go away.

982
00:45:31,933 --> 00:45:33,099
Get away from me!

983
00:45:34,432 --> 00:45:36,599
Sir, what's the matter?

984
00:45:39,808 --> 00:45:40,849
Sir, please...

985
00:45:40,933 --> 00:45:42,224
I told you to stop.

986
00:45:42,307 --> 00:45:44,808
I told you... I told you to stop.

987
00:46:00,099 --> 00:46:01,307
The kids went to the study room,

988
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:02,808
and I sent Ms. Yang home early.

989
00:46:05,349 --> 00:46:06,599
This way.

990
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:51,140
This is...

991
00:46:52,849 --> 00:46:54,683
My furniture company owns this land.

992
00:46:55,557 --> 00:46:57,099
Looks like he wants to build

993
00:46:57,182 --> 00:46:58,557
his own village on that land.

994
00:47:00,057 --> 00:47:01,933
Is that why he tried to kill Hye In?

995
00:47:03,683 --> 00:47:04,683
What do you mean?

996
00:47:05,516 --> 00:47:07,182
Right before my father passed away,

997
00:47:07,975 --> 00:47:11,349
he left the land to Hye In.

998
00:47:14,307 --> 00:47:15,474
There's a safe here.

999
00:47:20,516 --> 00:47:21,516
But this is...

1000
00:47:22,057 --> 00:47:23,182
How are we going to open it?

1001
00:47:25,766 --> 00:47:27,391
I think I know how.

1002
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:32,474
"Searching"

1003
00:47:40,349 --> 00:47:41,808
"Error"

1004
00:47:41,891 --> 00:47:43,099
"Fail"

1005
00:47:45,391 --> 00:47:47,099
Where are we going?

1006
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:49,349
He has a villa nearby.

1007
00:48:06,099 --> 00:48:07,599
We've been doing this for over two hours.

1008
00:48:08,724 --> 00:48:10,016
It's a six-digit number.

1009
00:48:10,057 --> 00:48:11,474
Considering all the possible sequences,

1010
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:13,140
we may not be able to open this tonight.

1011
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:15,474
But we may never get another chance.

1012
00:48:28,057 --> 00:48:30,683
Shouldn't we take him to a doctor?

1013
00:48:30,849 --> 00:48:32,432
There's nothing here.

1014
00:48:32,766 --> 00:48:33,849
He'll wake up soon.

1015
00:48:34,182 --> 00:48:35,474
I'll go pick up some medical supplies.

1016
00:48:36,016 --> 00:48:37,099
Please wait here.

1017
00:48:40,057 --> 00:48:41,349
There are fresh clothes in the closet.

1018
00:48:41,641 --> 00:48:42,724
You can get changed.

1019
00:49:04,224 --> 00:49:06,057
Secretary Cho, is that you?

1020
00:49:42,099 --> 00:49:43,182
Hey!

1021
00:49:45,516 --> 00:49:46,557
What do you think you're doing?

1022
00:49:46,641 --> 00:49:47,808
Look who's talking!

1023
00:49:48,224 --> 00:49:49,432
Why are you here?

1024
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:51,474
And why are you wearing my clothes?

1025
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:53,391
There was a bit of a situation.

1026
00:49:54,182 --> 00:49:56,224
Don't get any funny ideas.

1027
00:49:56,307 --> 00:49:57,599
What kind of situation?

1028
00:49:58,474 --> 00:50:00,307
I suppose you think you're important

1029
00:50:00,391 --> 00:50:01,933
now that you work for him,

1030
00:50:02,391 --> 00:50:05,099
but Joo Dan Tae is mine.

1031
00:50:05,724 --> 00:50:07,099
How dare you set eyes on him!

1032
00:50:09,016 --> 00:50:10,182
Take off my clothes at once.

1033
00:50:11,975 --> 00:50:14,266
You have no shame.

1034
00:50:14,432 --> 00:50:16,432
You can't stand him cheating on you?

1035
00:50:17,391 --> 00:50:19,432
Don't act like you're his wife.

1036
00:50:21,432 --> 00:50:22,891
Don't you dare judge me

1037
00:50:23,057 --> 00:50:24,349
by your lowly standards.

1038
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:26,057
Oh Yoon Hee.

1039
00:50:26,099 --> 00:50:27,140
Are you that insecure?

1040
00:50:30,057 --> 00:50:32,057
That ruthless Cheon Seo Jin I know

1041
00:50:32,182 --> 00:50:34,307
is totally head over heels for this man.

1042
00:50:36,224 --> 00:50:39,724
I'm suddenly getting very curious about

1043
00:50:41,057 --> 00:50:42,641
what kind of man

1044
00:50:43,349 --> 00:50:44,891
Joo Dan Tae is.

1045
00:50:45,099 --> 00:50:46,057
Shut your mouth.

1046
00:50:46,849 --> 00:50:48,724
Know your place.

1047
00:50:55,808 --> 00:50:57,391
How about you know your place first?

1048
00:50:59,391 --> 00:51:01,224
You're a mere mistress.

1049
00:51:02,766 --> 00:51:04,391
Don't you dare mess with me.

1050
00:51:07,307 --> 00:51:10,057
Chairman Joo needs to get some rest now,

1051
00:51:10,182 --> 00:51:11,224
so stop causing a scene here

1052
00:51:11,307 --> 00:51:12,432
and just get lost.

1053
00:51:13,391 --> 00:51:15,057
I'm telling you this as the manager

1054
00:51:15,099 --> 00:51:16,891
of JKING Holdings' investment team.

1055
00:51:18,432 --> 00:51:19,474
Have you lost your mind?

1056
00:51:19,557 --> 00:51:21,808
You don't deserve such a position!

1057
00:51:25,683 --> 00:51:27,641
What are you waiting for? Drag her out.

1058
00:51:28,224 --> 00:51:30,057
I'm afraid she'd wake Chairman Joo.

1059
00:51:31,391 --> 00:51:32,474
Please come with me, ma'am.

1060
00:51:36,391 --> 00:51:38,474
Let go. Let go of me! I said, let go!

1061
00:51:38,808 --> 00:51:39,683
Oh Yoon Hee.

1062
00:51:39,766 --> 00:51:41,933
Tell Chairman Joo to come outside!

1063
00:51:43,057 --> 00:51:44,182
That crazy witch.

1064
00:51:52,016 --> 00:51:53,140
You woke up.

1065
00:51:55,683 --> 00:51:57,057
Are you all right?

1066
00:51:57,516 --> 00:51:58,724
I know you have no interest

1067
00:51:58,808 --> 00:51:59,683
in my private life,

1068
00:52:00,391 --> 00:52:01,641
but I've shown you too much.

1069
00:52:03,057 --> 00:52:04,474
My wife doesn't know about my condition.

1070
00:52:05,182 --> 00:52:06,391
You've regained your consciousness,

1071
00:52:06,474 --> 00:52:07,557
so I'll be off now.

1072
00:52:08,182 --> 00:52:09,224
Why didn't you tell her?

1073
00:52:09,307 --> 00:52:10,432
I mean, Seo Jin.

1074
00:52:11,683 --> 00:52:12,766
About what happened today.

1075
00:52:15,057 --> 00:52:16,766
It seemed like you had a painful past.

1076
00:52:17,849 --> 00:52:19,557
I could tell from your face.

1077
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:23,975
I'd never tell others

1078
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:25,057
about your personal scars.

1079
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:26,307
I'm not that crude.

1080
00:52:27,391 --> 00:52:30,224
I saw nothing today.

1081
00:52:31,057 --> 00:52:32,474
So don't worry

1082
00:52:33,224 --> 00:52:35,266
and just take care of that lady outside.

1083
00:52:35,432 --> 00:52:36,516
Good night.

1084
00:52:39,099 --> 00:52:40,766
Let me talk to Chairman Joo!

1085
00:52:41,057 --> 00:52:42,891
Let go! I said, let go!

1086
00:52:48,224 --> 00:52:49,099
Oh Yoon Hee.

1087
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:50,808
Where do you think you're going?

1088
00:52:51,057 --> 00:52:52,474
Get back here and explain what happened!

1089
00:52:52,641 --> 00:52:54,391
Hey! Oh Yoon Hee!

1090
00:52:55,057 --> 00:52:57,224
Let go. I told you to let go!

1091
00:53:05,224 --> 00:53:06,933
Calm down. It's no big deal.

1092
00:53:07,057 --> 00:53:08,099
It's no big deal?

1093
00:53:08,933 --> 00:53:10,349
This villa is a private place

1094
00:53:10,432 --> 00:53:11,557
for just the two of us.

1095
00:53:12,016 --> 00:53:14,057
What the heck was she doing here?

1096
00:53:15,057 --> 00:53:16,557
Yoon Hee, that witch...

1097
00:53:18,016 --> 00:53:19,891
She left wearing my clothes.

1098
00:53:21,016 --> 00:53:23,016
What were you doing in your bed?

1099
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:24,057
It's not what you think.

1100
00:53:24,099 --> 00:53:25,016
We met up for work.

1101
00:53:25,099 --> 00:53:26,432
I told you to fire her.

1102
00:53:27,349 --> 00:53:28,933
You said you'd kick her out right away.

1103
00:53:29,683 --> 00:53:31,016
Why let her drag you around?

1104
00:53:31,099 --> 00:53:33,140
It's my company, so I decide what to do!

1105
00:53:38,057 --> 00:53:39,474
Some stuff happened,

1106
00:53:40,266 --> 00:53:42,016
so I had no choice.

1107
00:53:42,975 --> 00:53:43,933
Don't get so worked up.

1108
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:45,057
Let's talk inside.

1109
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:46,057
Oh Yoon Hee!

1110
00:53:49,683 --> 00:53:51,933
She gets on my nerves.

1111
00:53:54,016 --> 00:53:55,557
How many times do I have to tell you?

1112
00:53:57,266 --> 00:53:58,432
I came here

1113
00:53:59,349 --> 00:54:01,140
because I wanted to be comforted by you.

1114
00:54:03,474 --> 00:54:06,057
Did you have to ruin my mood like this?

1115
00:54:11,224 --> 00:54:12,557
You'll have to give me

1116
00:54:15,057 --> 00:54:16,057
a proper explanation

1117
00:54:16,082 --> 00:54:17,432
as to what happened today.

1118
00:54:26,432 --> 00:54:28,724
Drive Ms. Oh home.

1119
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:30,849
I'll go separately.

1120
00:54:31,391 --> 00:54:32,849
"Joo Dan Tae Village"

1121
00:54:33,474 --> 00:54:34,307
"Detailed Information"

1122
00:54:34,432 --> 00:54:35,599
"To be completed on May 19, 2023"

1123
00:54:38,766 --> 00:54:39,849
Hold on.

1124
00:54:44,557 --> 00:54:46,182
Safe unlocked.

1125
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:48,182
How did you figure it out?

1126
00:54:49,182 --> 00:54:50,724
May 19, 2023.

1127
00:54:50,849 --> 00:54:52,140
It's right here under aerial view.

1128
00:55:01,057 --> 00:55:02,975
There are tons of real estate documents

1129
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:04,849
and billions of won in cash.

1130
00:55:12,641 --> 00:55:13,683
What's this?

1131
00:55:14,224 --> 00:55:15,599
It's a photo of Seok Hoon and Seok Kyung

1132
00:55:15,683 --> 00:55:16,766
when they were babies.

1133
00:55:17,724 --> 00:55:18,724
Who's this woman?

1134
00:55:19,307 --> 00:55:20,849
There's an unusual tattoo on her shoulder.

1135
00:55:21,391 --> 00:55:22,432
Is she the twins' mother?

1136
00:55:23,975 --> 00:55:25,182
He told me their mother

1137
00:55:26,057 --> 00:55:27,432
died right after giving birth

1138
00:55:27,516 --> 00:55:28,891
due to sepsis.

1139
00:56:25,808 --> 00:56:28,933
Honey, what are you doing here?

1140
00:56:30,182 --> 00:56:31,057
Well...

1141
00:56:31,683 --> 00:56:32,933
I told you not to enter my study

1142
00:56:33,016 --> 00:56:34,516
without permission.

1143
00:56:51,099 --> 00:56:52,432
What is this?

1144
00:56:55,808 --> 00:56:56,724
This ring.

1145
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:58,641
Hye In's dad and I got this

1146
00:56:58,766 --> 00:56:59,849
as our wedding ring.

1147
00:57:01,432 --> 00:57:02,933
Why is this here?

1148
00:57:06,432 --> 00:57:09,307
You finally found it.

1149
00:57:11,224 --> 00:57:13,391
I was excited and thrilled every day,

1150
00:57:13,474 --> 00:57:15,557
wondering when you'd find it.

1151
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,432
Don't tell me...

1152
00:57:20,766 --> 00:57:22,057
Did you...

1153
00:57:23,724 --> 00:57:25,182
kill him?

1154
00:57:29,099 --> 00:57:30,516
How could you?

1155
00:57:33,099 --> 00:57:34,933
How could you kill an innocent man

1156
00:57:35,016 --> 00:57:36,933
and keep his finger as a souvenir?

1157
00:57:37,016 --> 00:57:38,474
You don't deserve to be called human!

1158
00:57:38,557 --> 00:57:39,933
The moment I saw that wedding ring

1159
00:57:40,016 --> 00:57:41,391
on that jerk's finger...

1160
00:57:44,016 --> 00:57:45,933
I totally lost it.

1161
00:57:47,016 --> 00:57:49,182
How dare he steal you from me.

1162
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:51,266
The fact that you were pregnant

1163
00:57:51,349 --> 00:57:52,474
with his child

1164
00:57:52,557 --> 00:57:54,349
made me want to tear his heart

1165
00:57:54,432 --> 00:57:55,724
to shreds.

1166
00:57:55,808 --> 00:57:56,975
You...

1167
00:57:58,057 --> 00:57:59,349
You're insane.

1168
00:57:59,432 --> 00:58:01,099
How could I stay sane

1169
00:58:01,474 --> 00:58:03,057
when my woman betrayed me?

1170
00:58:03,683 --> 00:58:04,808
How dare you leave me

1171
00:58:04,891 --> 00:58:06,266
for that lowlife.

1172
00:58:11,016 --> 00:58:13,349
You and I never loved each other.

1173
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:15,599
Our parents forced us

1174
00:58:15,683 --> 00:58:16,849
to get engaged.

1175
00:58:16,933 --> 00:58:19,432
And I never once opened up to you.

1176
00:58:22,182 --> 00:58:23,432
You killed someone.

1177
00:58:24,349 --> 00:58:26,975
How could you be so shameless?

1178
00:58:29,933 --> 00:58:31,307
You're evil.

1179
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:32,599
Evil?

1180
00:58:33,266 --> 00:58:34,391
Evil...

1181
00:58:35,724 --> 00:58:36,724
You betrayed me,

1182
00:58:36,808 --> 00:58:38,307
but I took care of your daughter

1183
00:58:38,599 --> 00:58:40,182
for 16 years.

1184
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:41,474
I did that for you.

1185
00:58:42,557 --> 00:58:43,557
You're the one who said

1186
00:58:43,641 --> 00:58:44,641
even her biological father

1187
00:58:44,724 --> 00:58:46,724
wouldn't have been that good to her.

1188
00:58:47,683 --> 00:58:49,557
So you have no right

1189
00:58:49,641 --> 00:58:50,891
to ask me for a divorce.

1190
00:58:51,349 --> 00:58:53,224
So what if I had an affair with Seo Jin?

1191
00:58:53,557 --> 00:58:54,849
I'm sorry,

1192
00:58:54,933 --> 00:58:56,349
but you betrayed me first!

1193
00:59:02,891 --> 00:59:04,182
I think that's enough

1194
00:59:05,016 --> 00:59:07,683
to make up for this finger.

1195
00:59:08,391 --> 00:59:10,683
Let's forget everything and start over.

1196
00:59:11,057 --> 00:59:13,016
I know we can be happy again.

1197
00:59:13,307 --> 00:59:14,182
Love?

1198
00:59:14,266 --> 00:59:15,724
We can start now.

1199
00:59:17,724 --> 00:59:19,557
We've betrayed each other once,

1200
00:59:19,975 --> 00:59:20,933
so that makes us even.

1201
00:59:22,808 --> 00:59:26,182
Well, I'll take that as a yes.

1202
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:28,849
I'm going to wash up.

1203
01:00:31,724 --> 01:00:33,057
Can I see your ID?

1204
01:00:33,975 --> 01:00:35,057
I'm a college student.

1205
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:36,307
Please just cash me out.

1206
01:00:36,474 --> 01:00:38,182
We have to check everyone's ID

1207
01:00:38,266 --> 01:00:39,808
before selling alcohol.

1208
01:00:40,557 --> 01:00:41,933
- Do you mind...
- Hey, is that you?

1209
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:43,099
Waiting List?

1210
01:00:43,641 --> 01:00:44,724
- My gosh!
- My gosh!

1211
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:46,766
It really is Bae Ro Na.

1212
01:00:47,349 --> 01:00:48,975
Gosh, look at her makeup and hair.

1213
01:00:50,057 --> 01:00:51,349
Did you run away from home?

1214
01:00:52,391 --> 01:00:54,057
Gosh, we're so stressed out

1215
01:00:54,182 --> 01:00:55,641
studying for the exams.

1216
01:00:57,724 --> 01:00:58,891
My gosh.

1217
01:00:58,975 --> 01:01:00,432
You even drink alcohol now?

1218
01:01:00,557 --> 01:01:01,599
Mind your own business.

1219
01:01:03,099 --> 01:01:04,099
What's with her?

1220
01:01:04,349 --> 01:01:05,933
She must've lost it after dropping out.

1221
01:01:06,057 --> 01:01:07,057
Hold on.

1222
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:17,766
Why are you getting in so late?

1223
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:21,391
Do you know what time it is now?

1224
01:01:24,057 --> 01:01:26,057
What on earth did you do to your hair?

1225
01:01:39,557 --> 01:01:40,933
Ro Na!

1226
01:01:54,599 --> 01:01:57,182
Why did I bother working so hard?

1227
01:02:01,557 --> 01:02:02,766
What's the use of being promoted

1228
01:02:02,849 --> 01:02:03,683
to manager

1229
01:02:05,057 --> 01:02:07,099
and living in a fancy house?

1230
01:02:09,766 --> 01:02:12,891
I've totally ruined my daughter's life.

1231
01:02:28,057 --> 01:02:29,432
Can we meet for a moment?

1232
01:02:30,266 --> 01:02:32,474
Come to the 47th floor at Hera Palace.

1233
01:02:46,766 --> 01:02:48,182
"Hera Palace"

1234
01:03:06,891 --> 01:03:09,224
Min Seol A, 47th floor.

1235
01:03:10,933 --> 01:03:12,849
Min Seol A, 47th floor...

1236
01:03:18,975 --> 01:03:20,349
"Beware, Risk of Falling"

1237
01:03:25,516 --> 01:03:26,849
Joo Dan Tae.

1238
01:03:27,182 --> 01:03:28,683
It was Joo Dan Tae.

1239
01:03:29,557 --> 01:03:30,432
Die!

1240
01:03:51,349 --> 01:03:53,182
"Hera Palace, 47th floor"

1241
01:04:02,766 --> 01:04:05,349
"Beware, Risk of Falling"

1242
01:04:06,557 --> 01:04:07,808
Ms. Oh?

1243
01:04:10,933 --> 01:04:12,599
It was you?

1244
01:04:14,307 --> 01:04:16,849
Are you the one who saved me?

1245
01:04:20,349 --> 01:04:21,683
Thank you.

1246
01:04:45,649 --> 01:04:46,857
If you're gone,

1247
01:04:47,441 --> 01:04:49,274
Ro Na can get in.

1248
01:04:49,357 --> 01:04:50,483
If you're gone for good...

1249
01:04:56,441 --> 01:04:57,524
That wasn't a dream.

1250
01:04:58,733 --> 01:04:59,816
Seol A

1251
01:05:00,608 --> 01:05:02,691
fell at Hera Palace.

1252
01:05:05,024 --> 01:05:08,566
I... I killed her.

1253
01:05:14,441 --> 01:05:15,566
Yoon Hee.

1254
01:05:16,149 --> 01:05:17,149
Soo Ryeon.

1255
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:20,149
You're early.

1256
01:05:28,857 --> 01:05:31,816
Well, why did you

1257
01:05:32,857 --> 01:05:33,940
want to meet here?

1258
01:05:34,857 --> 01:05:36,399
I have something to tell you.

1259
01:05:39,483 --> 01:05:40,608
To tell you the truth,

1260
01:05:42,816 --> 01:05:44,483
I used you all this time.

1261
01:05:45,357 --> 01:05:48,899
What... What do you mean?

1262
01:05:49,857 --> 01:05:50,775
The person who sent you

1263
01:05:50,857 --> 01:05:52,232
to Seol A's place in Bosong Village.

1264
01:05:53,441 --> 01:05:54,566
That was me.

1265
01:05:56,566 --> 01:05:57,608
And I arranged everything

1266
01:05:57,691 --> 01:05:58,857
so you'd move to Hera Palace.

1267
01:06:00,274 --> 01:06:01,816
I used you.

1268
01:06:02,857 --> 01:06:04,107
I really needed you

1269
01:06:05,816 --> 01:06:07,857
for my revenge.

1270
01:06:15,191 --> 01:06:16,191
I am

1271
01:06:17,796 --> 01:06:19,212
Seol A's mother.

1272
01:06:41,899 --> 01:06:44,066
=Penthouse=

1273
01:06:44,733 --> 01:06:45,940
I saw it with my own two eyes.

1274
01:06:46,024 --> 01:06:47,524
Off the railing on the 47th floor.

1275
01:06:47,691 --> 01:06:49,232
I decide whether we keep seeing each other

1276
01:06:49,857 --> 01:06:50,733
or break up.

1277
01:06:50,816 --> 01:06:51,857
Bae Ro Na is back.

1278
01:06:51,899 --> 01:06:52,857
I'm going out with Ro Na.

1279
01:06:52,940 --> 01:06:54,191
I haven't even started yet.

1280
01:06:54,274 --> 01:06:55,733
I look forward to working with you,

1281
01:06:55,816 --> 01:06:57,066
Chief Director Cheon Seo Jin.

1282
01:06:57,149 --> 01:06:58,441
It's time to put an end to this.

1283
01:06:58,524 --> 01:07:00,316
Don't trust anyone but yourself.

1284
01:07:00,399 --> 01:07:01,691
I must become stronger and tougher

1285
01:07:01,940 --> 01:07:03,316
since I'm a mother.
