I had a favour to ask,

7
00:00:42,824 --> 00:00:44,208
so I waited for you.

8
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:46,829
Get rid of

00:00:47,587 --> 00:00:49,287
Sim Soo Ryeon.

10
00:00:50,447 --> 00:00:51,552
Why were you so fixated

11
00:00:51,576 --> 00:00:53,276
on killing Sim Soo Ryeon?

12
00:00:54,825 --> 00:00:55,759
To make Joo Dan Tae

13
00:00:55,783 --> 00:00:57,609
and the penthouse yours?

14
00:00:59,034 --> 00:01:01,359
Is that what he said?

15
00:01:02,576 --> 00:01:04,442
That I wanted...

16
00:01:06,075 --> 00:01:07,676
to make him mine?

17
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,650
We have solid evidence.

18
00:01:11,284 --> 00:01:13,051
We found your fingerprints

19
00:01:13,075 --> 00:01:15,567
all over the murder weapon.

20
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,234
This is your knife, right?

21
00:01:22,724 --> 00:01:24,507
Soo Ryeon.

22
00:01:26,742 --> 00:01:28,676
Answer my question, Ms. Oh.

23
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,759
Did you kill Sim Soo Ryeon

24
00:01:29,783 --> 00:01:31,817
with this knife?

25
00:01:34,242 --> 00:01:35,403
Yes.

26
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,567
I killed her.

27
00:01:38,992 --> 00:01:40,050
What?

28
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:42,807
What did you just say?

29
00:01:45,618 --> 00:01:47,483
I said I killed her.

30
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:50,609
Because...

31
00:01:52,034 --> 00:01:53,900
I hated Soo Ryeon...

32
00:01:55,311 --> 00:01:57,095
to death.

33
00:02:07,326 --> 00:02:08,594
Well...

34
00:02:08,618 --> 00:02:10,318
It's all because of me.

35
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,692
It's all my fault.

36
00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:17,567
I should've put my foot down firmly.

37
00:02:19,783 --> 00:02:21,302
But it's all too late.

38
00:02:21,326 --> 00:02:22,885
It's...

39
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:25,135
It's not your fault.

40
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:26,176
There's no way

41
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,026
you can stop a psychopath.

42
00:02:29,284 --> 00:02:30,468
Then...

43
00:02:30,492 --> 00:02:32,359
I hope you feel better soon.

44
00:02:32,742 --> 00:02:34,400
You may go home.

45
00:02:44,992 --> 00:02:47,986
How am I supposed to drink this garbage?

46
00:03:02,867 --> 00:03:04,051
Sir.

47
00:03:04,075 --> 00:03:05,718
Where's my mum?

48
00:03:05,742 --> 00:03:07,676
Please let me see her.

49
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,483
Is she okay?

50
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,427
Why did you arrest someone who's innocent?

51
00:03:12,451 --> 00:03:14,552
Why is my mum here?

52
00:03:14,576 --> 00:03:16,552
She admitted to everything.

53
00:03:16,576 --> 00:03:17,549
What?

54
00:03:19,075 --> 00:03:20,395
No.

55
00:03:22,242 --> 00:03:24,234
She wouldn't do that.

56
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,759
No.

57
00:03:25,783 --> 00:03:26,908

at the most expensive apartment in Korea,

in the same apartment. - Rest in peace.

66
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,260

67

never forget you.

Goodness.

71
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:04,801
Our house prices will hit the rock bottom.

72
00:04:04,825 --> 00:04:06,692
It's plummeting every day.

73
00:04:07,061 --> 00:04:09,262
How can a disaster like this happen?

74
00:04:09,742 --> 00:04:14,609
My goodness.

75
00:04:15,825 --> 00:04:17,385
What the heck is wrong with you?

76
00:04:17,409 --> 00:04:20,026
What if someone hears you?

77
00:04:20,117 --> 00:04:22,302
There are numbers of cameras in here.

78
00:04:22,326 --> 00:04:23,718
Exactly.

79
00:04:23,742 --> 00:04:25,260
Someone died here.

80
00:04:25,284 --> 00:04:26,343
It's a murder case.

81
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:28,676
That's exactly why I'm worried.

82
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,594
It's a shocking case of a resident

83
00:04:30,618 --> 00:04:32,968
murdering another resident.

84
00:04:32,992 --> 00:04:35,843
The house price is plummeting every day,

85
00:04:35,867 --> 00:04:37,176
and I'm scared to death

86
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,801
because it won't stop dropping.

87
00:04:39,825 --> 00:04:41,968
The house price isn't the problem.

88
00:04:41,992 --> 00:04:43,759
I'm too scared

89
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,144
to use the toilet at night.

90
00:04:46,492 --> 00:04:49,343
How can Yoon Hee kill Soo Ryeon?

91
00:04:49,367 --> 00:04:51,218
Soo Ryeon was the only one

92
00:04:51,242 --> 00:04:53,010
who looked after and worried about her.

93
00:04:53,034 --> 00:04:54,635
She must've been out of her mind

94
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:56,606
after she fell for that man.

95
00:04:57,367 --> 00:04:59,510
Poor Soo Ryeon.

96
00:04:59,534 --> 00:05:01,984
This is a total betrayal.

97
00:05:02,409 --> 00:05:03,552
Did you watch the news?

98
00:05:03,576 --> 00:05:04,843
Yoon Hee decorated her house

99
00:05:04,867 --> 00:05:07,093
exactly like the penthouse.

100
00:05:07,117 --> 00:05:09,926
And she coveted after her husband.

101
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,427
I was appalled when I saw how she pasted

102
00:05:12,451 --> 00:05:14,385
her face on Soo Ryeon's family photo.

103
00:05:14,409 --> 00:05:15,968
That's why she went to work

104
00:05:15,992 --> 00:05:17,468
for Chairman Joo's company.

105
00:05:17,492 --> 00:05:19,318
She gives me the creeps.

106
00:05:19,492 --> 00:05:21,015
But you know...

107
00:05:22,242 --> 00:05:25,385
this isn't too bad for us.

108
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:26,676
At this point,

109
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,843
the reinvestigation of Min Seol A's death

110
00:05:28,867 --> 00:05:30,302
will be closed.

111
00:05:30,326 --> 00:05:31,718
Really? - Really?

112
00:05:31,742 --> 00:05:33,302
Soo Ryeon is dead.

113
00:05:33,326 --> 00:05:34,990
How can they keep the investigation going?

114
00:05:35,015 --> 00:05:35,950
The victim is dead,

115
00:05:35,975 --> 00:05:37,843
and so is the victim's biological mother.

116
00:05:37,867 --> 00:05:39,302
We should be

117
00:05:39,326 --> 00:05:41,676
thanking Yoon Hee right now.

118
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,759
Come to think of it,

119
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:45,260
everyone I couldn't stand is

120
00:05:45,284 --> 00:05:46,759
all gone at once.

121
00:05:46,783 --> 00:05:48,759
Sim Soo Ryeon, Oh Yoon Hee,

122
00:05:48,783 --> 00:05:50,323
and Bae Ro Na too.

123
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:54,318
But don't make it too obvious.

124
00:05:54,492 --> 00:05:55,759
We still spent

125
00:05:55,783 --> 00:05:58,567
so many years here together.

126
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:00,800
If you think about it,

127
00:06:00,825 --> 00:06:04,010
we aren't completely unlucky.

128
00:06:04,034 --> 00:06:06,093
Don't you think so, Attorney Lee?

129
00:06:06,117 --> 00:06:07,968
If we weren't lucky,

130
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:11,026
we couldn't have lived here anyway.

131
00:06:11,576 --> 00:06:13,400
After all,

132
00:06:14,367 --> 00:06:17,234
fate is on the rich people's side.

133
00:06:17,325 --> 00:06:19,426
The world can function

134
00:06:19,451 --> 00:06:20,926
thanks to the tax we pay to the state.

135
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,609
Of course.

136
00:06:26,534 --> 00:06:29,302
Goodness!

137
00:06:29,326 --> 00:06:31,759
No. - Oh, no.

138
00:06:31,783 --> 00:06:33,968
Goodness, Soo Ryeon.

139
00:06:33,992 --> 00:06:37,192
Oh, no...

140
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,067
You've done well through the funeral.

141
00:06:45,326 --> 00:06:46,343
You can stay here for a while

142
00:06:46,367 --> 00:06:47,635
until the house gets cleaned.

143
00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:50,525
Ms. Yang will bring the things you need.

144
00:06:54,034 --> 00:06:55,692
Get some rest, then.

145
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,483
So what's going to happen now?

146
00:07:01,492 --> 00:07:02,468
What do you mean?

147
00:07:02,492 --> 00:07:04,968
Are we going back to the penthouse?

148
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:06,135
I'll get everything sorted

149
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,400
as if nothing had happened.

150
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,567
You don't have to worry.

151
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,718
Nothing will change.

152
00:07:13,742 --> 00:07:15,926
Mum died there.

153
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,067
How can nothing change?

154
00:07:19,367 --> 00:07:21,817
Are you really unaffected by all this?

155
00:07:25,576 --> 00:07:27,594
If it's hard to deal with, take a leave

156
00:07:27,618 --> 00:07:29,567
and go study abroad for a year.

157
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,109
Give it a thought.

158
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,942
It's always like this.

159
00:07:45,284 --> 00:07:46,718
There's no one who is

160
00:07:46,742 --> 00:07:48,609
truly concerned about us.

161
00:07:48,867 --> 00:07:50,260
Mum said she'll protect us,

162
00:07:50,284 --> 00:07:51,984
but she died.

163
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,859
Everyone is a liar.

164
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:57,109
They all drive me insane.

165
00:07:57,367 --> 00:07:59,026
I hate everyone.

166
00:08:03,451 --> 00:08:05,234
Let's not go back

167
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:07,525
there.

What are you talking about?

170
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,051
Your medical accident

171
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,302
from a few months ago.

"Emergency Meeting: Medical Accident"

173
00:08:15,242 --> 00:08:17,302
It's causing controversy once again.

174
00:08:17,326 --> 00:08:18,926
We already closed that case.

175

The patient is

00:08:20,217 --> 00:08:21,294
suffering from bad aftereffects,

177
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:23,343
so they want to file a suit against us.

178
00:08:23,367 --> 00:08:24,594
On top of that,

179
00:08:24,618 --> 00:08:26,801
you got questioned by the police

180
00:08:26,825 --> 00:08:29,442
over the girl who died at Hera Palace.

181
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,218
Why didn't you tell us?

182
00:08:31,242 --> 00:08:32,801
We've been getting

183
00:08:32,825 --> 00:08:34,135
tens of requests a day on our website

184
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,900
demanding the truth of the matter.

185
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,609
What do you want?

186
00:08:43,242 --> 00:08:45,192
Don't you understand?

187
00:08:45,742 --> 00:08:47,051
He's asking you to step down

188
00:08:47,075 --> 00:08:49,109
from the director position.

189
00:08:49,134 --> 00:08:50,843
You should have that much responsibility

190
00:08:50,867 --> 00:08:53,594
as the director of this medical centre.

191
00:08:53,618 --> 00:08:55,218
Are you behind this?

192
00:08:55,242 --> 00:08:57,264
Did you bring up that old accident again?

193
00:08:57,289 --> 00:08:58,322
Your licence will be

194
00:08:58,347 --> 00:09:01,151
suspended for a year or two.

195
00:09:01,176 --> 00:09:02,135
I got you a place

196
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,427
at Johns Hopkins University.

197
00:09:03,451 --> 00:09:05,963
Use that time to go abroad and study.

198
00:09:05,988 --> 00:09:09,092
If you caused a medical accident,

199
00:09:09,117 --> 00:09:12,126
doesn't that mean you aren't good enough?

200
00:09:14,069 --> 00:09:16,670
I already found his replacement.

201
00:09:16,695 --> 00:09:18,218
Please take care of the paperwork

202
00:09:18,242 --> 00:09:19,843
to speed up the takeover.

203
00:09:19,867 --> 00:09:21,525
Yes, ma'am.

204
00:09:30,143 --> 00:09:32,926
You're kicking me out of the hospital

205
00:09:34,918 --> 00:09:37,368
and taking everything from me?

206
00:09:41,178 --> 00:09:43,920
Is this the end of the story you wanted?

207
00:09:44,578 --> 00:09:46,387
I just want to bring everything

208
00:09:46,412 --> 00:09:48,092
back to its place,

209
00:09:48,117 --> 00:09:50,594
including the hospital, the foundation,

210
00:09:50,618 --> 00:09:52,359
and Eun Byeol.

211
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:55,997
You aren't good enough for any of those.

212
00:10:02,236 --> 00:10:05,295
So why did you get overly ambitious?

213
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,812
There is absolutely nothing

214
00:10:09,451 --> 00:10:11,234
you can have.

215
00:10:25,867 --> 00:10:27,692
How are you feeling?

216
00:10:28,576 --> 00:10:30,302
I got some cake

217
00:10:30,326 --> 00:10:32,593
from your favourite dessert place.

218
00:10:32,618 --> 00:10:34,359
Do you want some?

219
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:41,483
You really won't talk to me?

220
00:10:44,659 --> 00:10:46,276
Fine.

221
00:10:46,492 --> 00:10:47,468
Once you get frustrated enough,

222
00:10:47,492 --> 00:10:49,400
you'll say something.

223
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,801
Eat it when you get hungry.

224
00:10:53,825 --> 00:10:56,323
I ordered a chocolate cake just for you.

225
00:11:48,825 --> 00:11:50,567
Whoa.

226
00:11:53,075 --> 00:11:54,968
Who killed Soo Ryeon?

227
00:11:54,992 --> 00:11:57,734
Why do you look so awful?

228
00:11:58,492 --> 00:12:00,594
I kept telling my boys

229
00:12:00,618 --> 00:12:02,302
to treat you with some respect.

230
00:12:02,326 --> 00:12:03,968
This place isn't like a hotel, is it?

231
00:12:03,992 --> 00:12:06,942
Who killed Soo Ryeon?

232
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,093
Gosh, even a billionaire looks scruffy

233
00:12:13,117 --> 00:12:15,093
after starving for a few days.

234
00:12:15,117 --> 00:12:16,843
Who cares about your buildings in New York

235
00:12:16,867 --> 00:12:18,801
if you don't have a hamburger right now?

236
00:12:18,825 --> 00:12:20,176
Isn't that so?

237
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,552
Answer me, Logan.

238
00:12:21,576 --> 00:12:23,594
Wait, no.

239
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:26,318
Kang Ho Dong... No. You were Gu Ho Dong.

240
00:12:28,409 --> 00:12:30,192
You scumbag.

241
00:12:35,284 --> 00:12:37,843
How dare you try to deceive me?

242
00:12:37,867 --> 00:12:38,957
Did you want to take

243
00:12:38,982 --> 00:12:41,308
my land in Myeong-dong like that?

244
00:12:43,825 --> 00:12:45,576
Thanks to you,

245
00:12:45,601 --> 00:12:46,618
I got humiliated,

246
00:12:46,643 --> 00:12:47,911
went to the prosecutors' office,

247
00:12:47,936 --> 00:12:49,454
and got my private life exposed,

248
00:12:49,479 --> 00:12:52,704
then I almost got locked up in prison.

249
00:12:52,729 --> 00:12:55,180
Why is that my fault?

250
00:12:55,205 --> 00:12:56,764
It's your fault for living your life

251
00:12:56,789 --> 00:12:58,057
like a scumbag.

252
00:12:58,082 --> 00:12:59,657
Right.

253
00:13:19,809 --> 00:13:21,926
I'm not looking to kill you

254
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,576
or make you disabled.

255
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,659
I'm only letting you live

256
00:13:25,683 --> 00:13:27,342
for this one reason.

257
00:13:27,725 --> 00:13:28,868
I just talked to your father,

258
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:30,717
James Lee, on the phone.

259
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,383
What have you done, you crazy jerk?

260
00:13:36,975 --> 00:13:39,701
I made a deal with your father

261
00:13:39,725 --> 00:13:41,383
over Min Seol A.

262
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:44,535
That little brat, Seol A.

263
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:46,327
She ended up helping me again.

264
00:13:46,351 --> 00:13:48,176
Shut up!

265
00:13:48,309 --> 00:13:51,160
Your father has done something

266
00:13:51,184 --> 00:13:53,993
very heartrending for his son's sake.

267
00:13:54,017 --> 00:13:55,826
He adopted Seol A from the orphanage,

268
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,576
got bone marrow transplantation,

269
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,659
then as if it wasn't enough

270
00:13:58,683 --> 00:14:00,160
to kick her out penniless,

271
00:14:00,184 --> 00:14:01,410
he even framed her for theft

272
00:14:01,434 --> 00:14:03,634
when he got her deported to Korea.

273
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:05,550
On top of that,

274
00:14:05,725 --> 00:14:07,494
I even found the transaction between him

275
00:14:07,518 --> 00:14:09,592
and the broker, Cho Sang Heon.

276
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:14,218
And I got it in my hands.

277
00:14:16,476 --> 00:14:19,509
Gosh, if the world finds out

278
00:14:19,934 --> 00:14:20,993
about this crazy secret,

279
00:14:21,017 --> 00:14:22,967
what will happen to your father?

280
00:14:24,243 --> 00:14:25,576
Hey.

281
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,993
Are you ready to lock him up in prison?

282
00:14:28,017 --> 00:14:29,494
Just kill me instead.

283
00:14:29,518 --> 00:14:31,743
No way.

284
00:14:31,767 --> 00:14:34,951
I don't want to kill you at all.

285
00:14:34,975 --> 00:14:36,494
I don't think you realise it,

286
00:14:36,518 --> 00:14:37,868
but the price on your life is

287
00:14:37,892 --> 00:14:40,535
unbelievably huge.

288
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:42,576
Your father sent me a lot of money

289
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,160
for letting you go in one piece.

290
00:14:46,184 --> 00:14:47,576
And of course,

291
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,800
he returned the Myeong-dong land too.

292
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,884
Just forget about Korea,

293
00:14:58,059 --> 00:14:59,410
Seol A,

294
00:14:59,434 --> 00:15:01,051
and Soo Ryeon too.

295
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:02,710
Then...

296
00:15:03,226 --> 00:15:05,300
adios, amigo.

297
00:15:05,934 --> 00:15:08,118
You scumbag!

298
00:15:08,142 --> 00:15:10,784
Who killed Soo Ryeon?

299
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:12,028
It was you, right?

300
00:15:12,053 --> 00:15:13,634
You did it!

301
00:15:13,659 --> 00:15:14,968
I'll risk my life if I must

302
00:15:14,992 --> 00:15:17,885
and make sure I take your life!

303
00:15:17,909 --> 00:15:20,192
Joo Dan Tae, you jerk!

304
00:15:20,909 --> 00:15:22,635
Stop right there!

305
00:15:22,659 --> 00:15:23,946
You!

306
00:15:46,492 --> 00:15:48,635
It has been so long since we spent

307
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:50,276
some time alone.

308
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,151
And whose fault is it?

309
00:15:54,075 --> 00:15:55,676
I'm sorry.

310
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,051
What's important is that we're reunited

311
00:15:58,075 --> 00:15:59,885
after many twists and turns.

312
00:15:59,909 --> 00:16:01,609
Isn't that so?

313
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,635
I now know this for sure.

314
00:16:04,659 --> 00:16:05,926
You are

315
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:08,567
the best partner I've ever had.

316
00:16:08,992 --> 00:16:10,692
Should we make a toast?

317
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:18,192
I love you.

318
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:34,817
Yoon Hee!

319
00:16:37,367 --> 00:16:38,510
Explain this.

320
00:16:38,534 --> 00:16:40,218
Why are you with him right now?

321
00:16:40,242 --> 00:16:41,135
Tell me!

322
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:42,385
What were you doing with him?

323
00:16:42,409 --> 00:16:43,343
Let me go.

324
00:16:43,367 --> 00:16:45,400
What are you doing?

325
00:16:46,618 --> 00:16:48,942
What's going on between you and him?

326
00:16:49,451 --> 00:16:50,759
Did you sleep with him?

327
00:16:50,783 --> 00:16:52,135
Did you?

328
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:53,942
Did you sleep with him?

329
00:16:54,534 --> 00:16:55,552
Tell me in your own words.

330
00:16:55,576 --> 00:16:56,759
Tell me!

331
00:16:56,783 --> 00:16:59,026
Take your hands off my woman.

332
00:17:01,326 --> 00:17:02,942
What?

333
00:17:04,492 --> 00:17:06,176
How can you do this to me?

334
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,260
How can you?

335
00:17:07,284 --> 00:17:08,984
That's enough!

336
00:17:09,451 --> 00:17:11,135
I'm sick and tired of you.

337
00:17:11,159 --> 00:17:12,093
If you have time to do this,

338
00:17:12,117 --> 00:17:13,427
go keep your foundation together.

339
00:17:13,451 --> 00:17:15,567
Don't be so clingy.

340
00:17:25,992 --> 00:17:27,676
Joo Dan Tae.

341
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,302
You scumbag!

342
00:17:29,326 --> 00:17:31,234
Stop right there!

343
00:17:44,284 --> 00:17:45,942
Get a good rest.

344
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,900
Keep a close eye

345
00:17:52,992 --> 00:17:54,692
on Oh Yoon Hee.

346
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:00,192
How dare you come here?

347
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,635
Is the great Cheon Seo Jin

348
00:18:05,659 --> 00:18:07,984
suspicious of me?

349
00:18:08,825 --> 00:18:11,385
Do I look like a man

350
00:18:11,409 --> 00:18:13,427
who would fall for a woman like her?

351
00:18:13,451 --> 00:18:15,151
What do you mean?

352
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,926
I was planning on using her.

353
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:20,218
Where else could I find a better prey

354
00:18:20,242 --> 00:18:21,759
than her?

355
00:18:21,783 --> 00:18:24,192
Tell me what your plan is.

356
00:18:25,576 --> 00:18:26,885
I have to pay Soo Ryeon back

357
00:18:26,909 --> 00:18:28,676
for everything she did.

358
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,885
That's how we can patch up everything,

359
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:32,010
including my company,

360
00:18:32,034 --> 00:18:33,594
your foundation,

361
00:18:33,618 --> 00:18:35,318
and Min Seol A's case.

362
00:18:39,117 --> 00:18:41,609
Are you going to get rid of Soo Ryeon?

363
00:18:43,075 --> 00:18:44,817
What about Yoon Hee?

364
00:18:46,242 --> 00:18:48,676
She's going to be used and dumped.

365
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,843
If we play along with her,

366
00:18:49,867 --> 00:18:52,483
she'll do everything the way we want.

367
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:55,176
Don't you think she's a perfect bait

368
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,859
to get to Soo Ryeon?

369
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:00,302
So that's why you needed

370
00:19:00,326 --> 00:19:01,984
Yoon Hee?

371
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,026
I knew it.

372
00:19:08,284 --> 00:19:10,650
You still got your game, Dan Tae.

373
00:19:12,242 --> 00:19:14,400
How can I help you?

374
00:19:16,825 --> 00:19:19,151
I need some money right now.

375
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:20,510
My accounts are frozen because of Logan,

376
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,483
so there's nothing I can do.

377
00:19:35,284 --> 00:19:36,676
It has been a while, Mr. Assemblyman.

378
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,885
Chairman Joo.

379
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:40,026
You know the situation right now.

380
00:19:48,576 --> 00:19:50,385
It's too dangerous

381
00:19:50,409 --> 00:19:52,067
to meet up like this.

382
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,510
It's impossible to cover up this case.

383
00:19:55,534 --> 00:19:57,260
You shouldn't try too hard because of me.

384
00:19:57,284 --> 00:20:00,359
I wouldn't want you to lose your position.

385
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:04,010
Then I take that as your understanding.

386
00:20:04,034 --> 00:20:05,734
This is a list

387
00:20:06,326 --> 00:20:08,775
of my little token of loyalty

388
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,817
I've shown you regularly.

389
00:20:14,753 --> 00:20:16,745
"Assemblyman Sim Jun Ho, Secret Ledger"

390
00:20:18,665 --> 00:20:20,842
The total comes to quite an amount.

391
00:20:20,867 --> 00:20:22,343
May I

392
00:20:22,367 --> 00:20:25,109
send this to the prosecutor general?

393
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:29,276
Chairman Joo, what is this nonsense?

394
00:20:36,242 --> 00:20:37,759
I'm Cheon Seo Jin,

395
00:20:37,783 --> 00:20:40,353
the chief director of Cheonga Foundation.

396
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,385
You should

397
00:20:45,409 --> 00:20:47,442
make more connections

398
00:20:48,326 --> 00:20:50,650
and rise up higher in power.

399
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,276
I'll provide my full support as well.

400
00:20:58,075 --> 00:20:59,734
Make your decision.

401
00:21:00,284 --> 00:21:02,801
I'm not going down alone.

402
00:21:02,825 --> 00:21:04,525
You need to save me

403
00:21:05,284 --> 00:21:07,483
in order to save yourself.

404
00:21:27,242 --> 00:21:28,218
Come up with a story

405
00:21:28,242 --> 00:21:29,968
to wrap up the investigation

406
00:21:29,992 --> 00:21:31,801
for the cases involving JKING Holdings

407
00:21:31,825 --> 00:21:33,759
and the corruption

408
00:21:33,783 --> 00:21:35,525
in Cheonga Foundation.

409
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:49,968
"Seoul Gangnam Police Station"

410
00:21:49,992 --> 00:21:51,650
"Seoul Gangnam Police Station"

411
00:21:52,825 --> 00:21:54,218
You have until today

412
00:21:54,242 --> 00:21:55,900
to turn yourself in.

413
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,817
You'd better go to the police station now.

414
00:22:00,492 --> 00:22:02,775
If you keep being stubborn like this,

415
00:22:03,075 --> 00:22:05,343
I will destroy Ro Na as well.

416
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:07,400
She'll end up like Seol A.

417
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,102
"Seoul Gangnam Police Station"

418
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,676
Goodness, Secretary Cho.

419
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,218
What brings you here?

420
00:22:26,242 --> 00:22:27,260
The chairman asks you

421
00:22:27,284 --> 00:22:28,968
to come to the penthouse now.

422
00:22:28,992 --> 00:22:30,859
It's important.

423
00:22:37,618 --> 00:22:39,218
Ms. Yang, you are finally

424
00:22:39,242 --> 00:22:41,650
proving yourself as a useful person.

425
00:22:43,825 --> 00:22:46,359
You gave me

426
00:22:46,618 --> 00:22:48,483
an amazing inspiration.

427
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,692
Let me put this right here.

428
00:22:53,034 --> 00:22:54,692
Looks beautiful.

429
00:22:56,451 --> 00:22:58,984
I just need you to call Soo Ryeon now.

430
00:23:01,326 --> 00:23:02,676
What are you doing?

431
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,343
Call her.

432
00:23:04,367 --> 00:23:06,609
She'll run over in an instant

433
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,718
if you say the kids are in danger.

434
00:23:08,742 --> 00:23:10,400
Yes, Chairman Joo.

435
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,051
Hello, Ms. Yang.

436
00:23:20,075 --> 00:23:21,385
Is everything okay?

437
00:23:21,409 --> 00:23:22,385
Ma'am, Chairman Joo

438
00:23:22,409 --> 00:23:24,385
took the kids to his study again.

439
00:23:24,409 --> 00:23:26,026
What should I do?

440
00:23:48,618 --> 00:23:50,442
She just arrived.

441
00:23:50,825 --> 00:23:52,483
She'll be there soon.

442
00:23:56,044 --> 00:23:57,635
Seok Hoon.

443
00:23:57,659 --> 00:23:59,318
Seok Kyung!

444
00:24:29,326 --> 00:24:31,276
How can you...

445
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:36,234
You're the one who made me do this.

446
00:24:57,301 --> 00:24:59,337
How unfortunate.

447
00:25:00,283 --> 00:25:02,259
Your revenge ended

448
00:25:02,283 --> 00:25:04,275
in your death.

449
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,916
But you know,

450
00:25:06,191 --> 00:25:08,384
you'll soon be reunited

451
00:25:08,409 --> 00:25:10,094
with your daughter

452
00:25:10,118 --> 00:25:11,942
you missed so much.

453
00:25:12,087 --> 00:25:13,705
Happy, aren't you?

454
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:16,571
Chairman Joo, I'm here.

455
00:25:23,183 --> 00:25:24,842
Chairman Joo.

456
00:25:27,309 --> 00:25:28,925
Farewell.

457
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,871
Chairman Joo, are you in...

458
00:25:57,298 --> 00:25:58,998
Soo Ryeon.

459
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,030
Soo Ryeon.

460
00:26:16,792 --> 00:26:18,310
Soo Ryeon?

461
00:26:18,334 --> 00:26:19,951
Soo Ryeon.

462
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:24,810
Soo Ryeon, are you okay?

463
00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:26,450
Soo Ryeon.

464
00:26:27,667 --> 00:26:28,685
What did you say?

465
00:26:28,709 --> 00:26:29,976
I can't hear you, Soo Ryeon.

466
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,742
I can't hear you.

467
00:26:36,834 --> 00:26:38,450
Soo Ryeon.

468
00:26:38,667 --> 00:26:40,810
Soo Ryeon? Soo Ryeon.

469
00:26:40,834 --> 00:26:42,185
Soo Ryeon, wake up.

470
00:26:42,209 --> 00:26:43,394
Don't die! No!

471
00:26:43,418 --> 00:26:44,726
No, you can't die!

472
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,018
Soo Ryeon, No!

473
00:26:46,042 --> 00:26:47,601
No, Soo Ryeon!

474
00:26:47,625 --> 00:26:49,185
No, please don't die.

475
00:26:49,209 --> 00:26:51,909
Please don't die, Soo Ryeon.

476
00:27:06,251 --> 00:27:07,909
Soo Ryeon...

477
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,660
You did this?

478
00:27:41,685 --> 00:27:43,329
You killed my wife?

479
00:27:43,354 --> 00:27:46,012
How could you do something so cruel?

480
00:27:46,792 --> 00:27:48,784
Hurry up. Take her!

481
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:54,036
Were you ever shaken by Yoon Hee?

482
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,893
Not even once?

483
00:27:55,917 --> 00:27:58,534
I swear. Not even once.

484
00:27:59,126 --> 00:28:01,851
Those who are dirt poor fall so easily

485
00:28:01,875 --> 00:28:04,242
when I show them some kindness.

486
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,643
Why would I fall for a woman like her?

487
00:28:06,667 --> 00:28:08,450
Me, Joo Dan Tae?

488
00:28:12,418 --> 00:28:14,784
Thanks to her delusion,

489
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:18,162
we could keep what's ours safe and sound.

490
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,060
But why did Yoon Hee

491
00:28:22,084 --> 00:28:23,643
admit to her charges

492
00:28:23,667 --> 00:28:25,143
without putting up a fight?

493
00:28:25,167 --> 00:28:26,810
The evidence is too solid,

494
00:28:26,834 --> 00:28:28,617
so she must have given up.

495
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:31,450
But

496
00:28:31,542 --> 00:28:33,851
something was definitely going on

497
00:28:33,875 --> 00:28:36,159
between Soo Ryeon and Yoon Hee.

498
00:28:36,334 --> 00:28:37,559
It looks like

499
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:40,060
Yoon Hee made a huge mistake.

500
00:28:40,084 --> 00:28:42,685
Something that can't be

501
00:28:42,709 --> 00:28:43,893
undone.

502
00:28:43,917 --> 00:28:45,492
A mistake?

503
00:28:45,917 --> 00:28:47,227
What could it be?

504
00:28:47,251 --> 00:28:49,409
Who knows?

505
00:28:50,709 --> 00:28:52,367
But

506
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,409
that wasn't bad news for us.

507
00:28:54,542 --> 00:28:55,559
Yoon Hee will be sent

508
00:28:55,583 --> 00:28:57,534
to the prosecution tomorrow.

509
00:28:57,834 --> 00:28:59,976
I heard a public defender took her case.

510
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,476
Then we won't have any problem

511
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,200
in convicting her as the culprit.

512
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,118
After that,

513
00:29:08,325 --> 00:29:10,900
everything will be settled.

514
00:29:17,875 --> 00:29:20,242
You are

515
00:29:21,875 --> 00:29:23,784
such a frightening man.

516
00:29:24,709 --> 00:29:26,476
And that's why you're so charming.

517
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,492
You give me so much credit.

518
00:29:29,251 --> 00:29:30,643
I'm already getting excited.

519
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:32,367
But I hope

520
00:29:32,542 --> 00:29:35,242
you didn't get blood on your hands.

521
00:29:35,334 --> 00:29:38,118
I heard she was killed brutally.

522
00:29:40,084 --> 00:29:41,893
How could I do that?

523
00:29:41,917 --> 00:29:44,909
How can I do something that cruel?

524
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,784
You know that I can't even kill an ant.

525
00:29:48,127 --> 00:29:49,686
I made sure there won't be any trouble,

526
00:29:49,711 --> 00:29:51,411
so you don't have to worry.

527
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,911
But there's still another mystery.

528
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,893
Then who killed Min Seol A?

529
00:29:58,917 --> 00:30:00,700
Who cares?

530
00:30:01,459 --> 00:30:02,851
What's important is that

531
00:30:02,875 --> 00:30:05,325
someone we can't have around is now gone.

532
00:30:05,459 --> 00:30:07,102
Both Min Seol A

533
00:30:07,126 --> 00:30:09,367
and her mother.

534
00:30:09,583 --> 00:30:11,200
Bye-bye.

535
00:30:11,875 --> 00:30:13,534
Bye-bye.

536
00:30:21,914 --> 00:30:24,781
"Gangnam Police Station"

537
00:30:30,542 --> 00:30:31,849
Sir.

538
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:34,268
You're still here?

539
00:30:34,292 --> 00:30:36,768
There's no use in sticking around.

540
00:30:36,792 --> 00:30:39,325
Please let me see my mum.

541
00:30:40,042 --> 00:30:42,102
Something must be wrong.

542
00:30:42,126 --> 00:30:44,325
She wouldn't do that.

543
00:30:44,667 --> 00:30:46,559
I know her best,

544
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:48,018
and she really loved

545
00:30:48,042 --> 00:30:49,784
Ms. Sim of the penthouse.

546
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,867
This can't be true.

547
00:30:52,709 --> 00:30:55,034
I'll talk to her in person.

548
00:30:55,251 --> 00:30:57,659
Please let me see her.

549
00:30:58,834 --> 00:31:00,909
She doesn't want to see you.

550
00:31:01,042 --> 00:31:02,476
We kept asking her, but she said no.

551
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,200
What more can we do?

552
00:31:04,625 --> 00:31:06,476
You can go to your grandma's place.

553
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,367
She asked her to look after you.

554
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,200
I'm not leaving.

555
00:31:12,875 --> 00:31:14,976
I'm not going to move an inch

556
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,325
until I see her.

557
00:31:26,418 --> 00:31:28,367
I'm your public defender.

558
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:31,435
So much evidence was found at your home

559
00:31:31,459 --> 00:31:34,518
that you'd been stalking Joo Dan Tae.

560
00:31:34,542 --> 00:31:36,685
You've come in and out of the penthouse,

561
00:31:36,709 --> 00:31:38,643
stealing Sim Soo Ryeon's belongings,

562
00:31:38,667 --> 00:31:40,268
trying on her clothes,

563
00:31:40,292 --> 00:31:41,935
and pretending to be her.

564
00:31:41,959 --> 00:31:44,227
Everything was caught on the CCTV.

565
00:31:44,251 --> 00:31:46,643
You'll be sent to a detention centre

566
00:31:46,667 --> 00:31:48,992
as soon as your warrant is issued.

567
00:31:49,583 --> 00:31:51,768
I never asked for a lawyer.

568
00:31:51,792 --> 00:31:53,310
Well,

569
00:31:53,334 --> 00:31:56,118
I know this trial is pointless,

570
00:31:56,251 --> 00:31:58,435
but try to look remorseful

571
00:31:58,459 --> 00:32:00,601
for your daughter's sake.

572
00:32:00,625 --> 00:32:03,951
That's how you can reduce your sentence.

573
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,435
Your daughter has been here for days

574
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:09,575
without going home.

575
00:32:09,917 --> 00:32:12,159
You really aren't going to see her?

576
00:32:14,042 --> 00:32:15,867
No, I'm not.

577
00:32:16,875 --> 00:32:18,476
Just

578
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,200
tell her to go.

579
00:32:21,126 --> 00:32:23,575
I admit to all my charges.

580
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,159
Just...

581
00:32:27,292 --> 00:32:29,784
put an end to everything quickly.

582
00:32:30,376 --> 00:32:31,935
She's coming out.

583
00:32:31,959 --> 00:32:33,227
Do you admit murdering her?

584
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:34,227
Why did you kill her?

585
00:32:34,251 --> 00:32:35,476
Was this over a love affair?

586
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,060
Why did you kill her so brutally?

587
00:32:37,084 --> 00:32:38,726
Why did you stab her over and over again?

588
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:39,976
Is the reason of your murder

589
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,227
the anger against those who are rich?

590
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:43,559
How long have you been jealous of her?

591
00:32:43,583 --> 00:32:45,394
Were you envious or hateful?

592
00:32:45,418 --> 00:32:46,476
A comment, please.

593
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,476
Don't you want to apologise to the victim?

594
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,559
Mum! You didn't do this.

595
00:32:50,583 --> 00:32:52,476
It wasn't you.

596
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,143
Tell them that it wasn't you, please!

597
00:32:55,167 --> 00:32:56,476
Please tell them.

598
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,726
Mum.

599
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,409
Mum...

600
00:32:59,834 --> 00:33:01,352
Mum, look at me.

601
00:33:01,376 --> 00:33:02,310
Mum!

602
00:33:02,334 --> 00:33:05,185
Mum, please just look at me.

603
00:33:05,209 --> 00:33:07,726
Just look at me once, Mum.

604
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:10,310
Mum, please.

605
00:33:10,334 --> 00:33:11,518
Mum.

606
00:33:11,542 --> 00:33:14,118
Mum. Mum!

607
00:33:49,963 --> 00:33:51,976
"Murderer"

608
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,325
"Take responsibility and leave"

609
00:33:55,583 --> 00:33:56,893
"Psychopath"

610
00:33:56,917 --> 00:33:58,227
"Go back to Bosong Village"

611
00:33:58,251 --> 00:33:59,613
"Leave Hera Palace"

612
00:34:00,792 --> 00:34:01,810
"Wicked Oh Yoon Hee! Disgusting family!"

613
00:34:01,834 --> 00:34:03,330
"A murderer lives here"

614
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:07,726
"Get out of Hera Palace"

615
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:08,640
"Murderer"

616
00:34:18,813 --> 00:34:20,763
When will you give that to me?

617
00:34:23,797 --> 00:34:25,581
It's nothing expensive.

618
00:34:27,376 --> 00:34:28,992
It's cute.

619
00:34:38,111 --> 00:34:39,686
Hey.

620
00:34:41,209 --> 00:34:42,893
Where have you been?

621
00:34:42,917 --> 00:34:45,242
It was really chaotic while you were gone.

622
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,700
I couldn't deal with all the noise.

623
00:34:48,042 --> 00:34:49,643
I thought you ran off somewhere too.

624
00:34:49,667 --> 00:34:51,283
So what?

625
00:34:51,917 --> 00:34:52,935
Do you want to attack me

626
00:34:52,959 --> 00:34:54,700
and call me a murderer's daughter?

627
00:34:54,917 --> 00:34:57,476
Go ahead. Say what you want.

628
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,076
I'll stand here and listen, so go ahead!

629
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,076
Did you

630
00:35:02,917 --> 00:35:04,575
eat anything?

631
00:35:04,709 --> 00:35:05,882
What?

632
00:35:06,451 --> 00:35:07,761
Go pig out on this.

633
00:35:07,786 --> 00:35:09,652
You'll need energy to cry.

634
00:35:10,209 --> 00:35:12,559
Stay quiet at home as if you're dead.

635
00:35:12,583 --> 00:35:14,826
People might come back to attack you.

636
00:35:17,286 --> 00:35:18,928
"Leave this place! Murderer"

637
00:35:18,953 --> 00:35:20,096
"A murderer made of inferiority complex!"

638
00:35:20,121 --> 00:35:21,461
"Wicked woman, leave this place"

639
00:35:48,709 --> 00:35:50,367
Mum.

640
00:35:50,542 --> 00:35:52,242
What am I going to do?

641
00:35:53,427 --> 00:35:55,835
What am I going to do now?

642
00:36:10,875 --> 00:36:13,414
"Six months later"

643
00:36:13,439 --> 00:36:14,810
"Mari Sauna"

644
00:36:14,834 --> 00:36:16,726
Thanks to you and your friends,

645
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:19,310
I think I'll be acquitted.

646
00:36:19,334 --> 00:36:22,167
How can I possibly repay you?

647
00:36:22,192 --> 00:36:24,517
I told you

648
00:36:24,542 --> 00:36:27,200
that I'll be there when you need my help.

649
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,331
This is nothing.

650
00:36:30,356 --> 00:36:33,202
I promise you that I'll stay loyal to you

651
00:36:33,226 --> 00:36:35,804
and your friends for the rest of my life.

652
00:36:38,142 --> 00:36:41,701
And you know, those things on the news...

653
00:36:41,725 --> 00:36:43,597
They're not true at all.

654
00:36:43,622 --> 00:36:45,285
The woman who died

655
00:36:45,309 --> 00:36:47,452
made it up to receive settlement money

656
00:36:47,476 --> 00:36:48,993
for their divorce.

657
00:36:49,017 --> 00:36:50,368
What?

658
00:36:50,392 --> 00:36:52,910
What was the condition she had?

659
00:36:52,934 --> 00:36:54,243
Right, delusional disorder.

660
00:36:54,267 --> 00:36:56,243
She used to blabber on about a daughter

661
00:36:56,267 --> 00:36:57,951
that didn't even exist.

662
00:36:57,975 --> 00:36:59,494
I didn't even know

663
00:36:59,518 --> 00:37:02,176
such an illness existed.

664
00:37:02,341 --> 00:37:04,791
Really? - Yes.

665
00:37:06,017 --> 00:37:07,494
Chairman Joo of JKING Holdings,

666
00:37:07,518 --> 00:37:08,868
who was charged with embezzlement

667
00:37:08,892 --> 00:37:10,118
and investment fraud,

668
00:37:10,142 --> 00:37:13,285
has been acquitted.

669
00:37:13,309 --> 00:37:15,011
The police have found out that Sim,

670
00:37:15,036 --> 00:37:16,743
the victim of the Hera Palace murder,

671
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:18,701
meticulously fabricated all the documents

672
00:37:18,725 --> 00:37:20,202
in order to gain the upper hand

673
00:37:20,226 --> 00:37:22,035
in the divorce litigation

674
00:37:22,059 --> 00:37:23,974
against Chairman Joo.

675
00:37:23,999 --> 00:37:25,701
For the investment-related documents,

676
00:37:25,725 --> 00:37:27,333
Sim hired...

677
00:37:31,586 --> 00:37:35,187
Mum, can I please stop now?

678
00:37:35,212 --> 00:37:37,787
My arms are about to break.

679
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,191
Mother, please forgive us.

680
00:37:41,216 --> 00:37:43,826
We've been cleared of our charges.

681
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:45,517
Do you know how much I spent

682
00:37:45,542 --> 00:37:46,785
to make that happen?

683
00:37:46,809 --> 00:37:50,051
I had to hire 10 lawyers.

684
00:37:50,187 --> 00:37:52,950
And you ruined your father's reputation.

685
00:37:52,975 --> 00:37:54,576
It'll never happen again.

686
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,951
Forgive us now.

687
00:37:55,975 --> 00:37:58,743
Gosh. Please, Mi Ja.

688
00:37:58,767 --> 00:38:00,884
Don't you think this is enough?

689
00:38:03,767 --> 00:38:05,452
Son.

690
00:38:05,476 --> 00:38:06,452
Don't get involved

691
00:38:06,476 --> 00:38:08,019
in something so nasty again.

692
00:38:08,044 --> 00:38:09,869
Okay?

693
00:38:10,423 --> 00:38:12,315
It looks like your father wants you

694
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,248
to get into politics.

695
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,327
Politics? Me?

696
00:38:16,351 --> 00:38:18,535
It's about time someone in our family

697
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:20,575
became a politician.

698
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,701
Which is why

699
00:38:21,725 --> 00:38:23,576
you must be careful at all times

700
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,118
not to be dragged into scandals

701
00:38:25,142 --> 00:38:27,300
or rumours, okay?

702
00:38:27,568 --> 00:38:28,777
You too.

703
00:38:29,518 --> 00:38:31,300
Sure thing, Mother.

704
00:38:32,392 --> 00:38:34,717
An assemblyman...

705
00:38:37,062 --> 00:38:38,929
That sounds awesome.

706
00:38:46,184 --> 00:38:47,910
Being investigated by the prosecution

707
00:38:47,934 --> 00:38:50,342
must've been very stressful, ma'am.

708
00:38:50,617 --> 00:38:52,260
Thank you all for doing your best

709
00:38:52,285 --> 00:38:53,748
to help me uncover the truth.

710
00:38:53,773 --> 00:38:55,035
Everyone in the alumni association

711
00:38:55,059 --> 00:38:56,202
did their best to help you

712
00:38:56,226 --> 00:38:57,576
clear your name.

713
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,868
And those in the music industry

714
00:38:58,892 --> 00:39:00,494
showed their support by consistently

715
00:39:00,518 --> 00:39:03,148
doing interviews with the media.

716
00:39:03,173 --> 00:39:04,701
That's no surprise.

717
00:39:04,725 --> 00:39:06,826
She was repaid for all her kind deeds,

718
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:07,951
donations,

719
00:39:07,975 --> 00:39:09,743
and contributions to our community

720
00:39:09,767 --> 00:39:11,452
over the years.

721
00:39:11,476 --> 00:39:13,460
I, Ma Doo Ki, firmly believe so.

722
00:39:13,485 --> 00:39:15,286
I suppose I didn't live my life wrong.

723
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:17,266
I'm glad to see that.

724
00:39:18,376 --> 00:39:20,060
There will be no more scandals

725
00:39:20,084 --> 00:39:22,325
involving Cheonga Foundation.

726
00:39:23,192 --> 00:39:25,475
We'll start on a clean slate.

727
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,601
Please do your best

728
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:28,768
for Cheonga Foundation's better future.

729
00:39:28,792 --> 00:39:30,951
Of course, ma'am.

730
00:39:33,593 --> 00:39:35,038
By the way,

731
00:39:35,376 --> 00:39:37,118
how's Eun Byeol doing?

732
00:39:37,938 --> 00:39:39,185
She's finally back from her trip,

733
00:39:39,209 --> 00:39:40,643
safe and sound.

734
00:39:40,667 --> 00:39:42,367
She'll return to school

735
00:39:42,764 --> 00:39:45,131
next week.

736
00:39:54,542 --> 00:39:55,810
Now that you're back, you'll return

737
00:39:55,834 --> 00:39:57,476
to school starting next week.

738
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,060
The doctor said you're fine,

739
00:39:59,084 --> 00:40:01,102
so you'll have no problem studying.

740
00:40:01,126 --> 00:40:02,310
I'll book special lessons for you

741
00:40:02,334 --> 00:40:03,768
so you can catch up.

742
00:40:03,792 --> 00:40:05,967
You'll be busy for a while.

743
00:40:09,418 --> 00:40:11,159
Ha Eun Byeol.

744
00:40:12,229 --> 00:40:14,747
How much longer will you stay silent?

745
00:40:14,772 --> 00:40:16,972
I'm losing my patience.

746
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,785
What do you want?

747
00:40:21,809 --> 00:40:23,626
Will you quit school and singing?

748
00:40:23,651 --> 00:40:24,764
You don't care about going to college?

749
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:26,218
Is that it?

750
00:40:40,376 --> 00:40:42,283
Hi, honey.

751
00:40:43,292 --> 00:40:45,951
What? A party?

752
00:40:46,217 --> 00:40:48,360
Everything's been sorted out, you know.

753
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,485
Even for the embezzlement,

754
00:40:49,509 --> 00:40:50,347
it's been concluded that

755
00:40:50,372 --> 00:40:52,235
Oh Yoon Hee did it with Logan.

756
00:40:52,259 --> 00:40:53,943
Since it's all over now,

757
00:40:53,967 --> 00:40:55,068
I want to have a small party

758
00:40:55,092 --> 00:40:56,776
with the people of Hera Club.

759
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,360
It's been stressful for everyone.

760
00:40:58,384 --> 00:41:00,609
Right, sounds good.

761
00:41:00,633 --> 00:41:01,906
All right.

762
00:41:01,931 --> 00:41:03,692
We'll talk later.

763
00:41:03,717 --> 00:41:04,981
Okay.

764
00:41:07,925 --> 00:41:09,430
Gosh.

765
00:41:11,421 --> 00:41:13,247
Go in and get some rest.

766
00:41:15,161 --> 00:41:16,668
Mum.

767
00:41:21,717 --> 00:41:23,444
Eun Byeol.

768
00:41:23,468 --> 00:41:26,693
Did you just say "Mum"?

769
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:28,943
Yes! I'm so glad.

770
00:41:28,967 --> 00:41:30,068
I knew it, sweetie.

771
00:41:30,092 --> 00:41:32,412
I knew you'd overcome this.

772
00:41:32,437 --> 00:41:34,026
Is there anything else you wanted to say?

773
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:35,152
Is there something you want to eat?

774
00:41:35,176 --> 00:41:37,026
I'll make it for you.

775
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:38,792
Why won't you ask me

776
00:41:39,092 --> 00:41:41,417
the reason I took those pills?

777
00:41:41,967 --> 00:41:43,560
About that...

778
00:41:45,509 --> 00:41:47,250
Just forget about it.

779
00:41:47,509 --> 00:41:49,375
You can start over.

780
00:41:49,675 --> 00:41:51,693
Nothing happened to you.

781
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:54,068
But that won't make the past disappear

782
00:41:54,383 --> 00:41:55,293
will it?

783
00:41:55,317 --> 00:41:56,585
If you live in the past,

784
00:41:56,609 --> 00:41:57,960
you can't do anything.

785
00:41:57,984 --> 00:42:00,293
It's the most foolish thing anyone can do.

786
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:02,684
What about you? Have you moved on?

787
00:42:03,276 --> 00:42:05,517
I'm talking about Grandpa's death.

788
00:42:07,376 --> 00:42:08,438
What?

789
00:42:10,075 --> 00:42:13,465
You're no longer my daughter!

790
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:15,990
No! Cheonga is mine!

791
00:42:16,015 --> 00:42:18,461
You can't take it from me! - Let go!

792
00:42:18,486 --> 00:42:21,092
No! - Let go!

793
00:42:21,117 --> 00:42:23,817
I said, let go! - Dad.

794
00:42:24,251 --> 00:42:26,951
Dad! No!

795
00:42:39,274 --> 00:42:42,237
If I called an ambulance,

796
00:42:42,262 --> 00:42:44,545
he'd still be alive.

797
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:46,130
Now that I think about it,

798
00:42:46,155 --> 00:42:47,756
I feel terrible.

799
00:42:47,781 --> 00:42:50,439
I kept it to myself to protect you, Mum.

800
00:42:51,176 --> 00:42:52,917
Why are you suddenly

801
00:42:53,426 --> 00:42:55,209
talking about your grandpa?

802
00:42:55,426 --> 00:42:57,526
I took those pills

803
00:42:57,550 --> 00:43:00,250
because I missed Grandpa too much.

804
00:43:00,384 --> 00:43:02,250
What do you mean?

805
00:43:04,018 --> 00:43:06,634
What are you talking about? Explain!

806
00:43:08,883 --> 00:43:10,164
See?

807
00:43:10,509 --> 00:43:13,209
You haven't completely moved on either.

808
00:43:13,509 --> 00:43:16,001
You miss Grandpa too, don't you?

809
00:43:19,695 --> 00:43:21,770
Gosh, I'm hungry.

810
00:43:23,009 --> 00:43:24,526
I'm craving pasta.

811
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:26,444
With a lot of garlic.

812
00:43:26,468 --> 00:43:28,333
You'll make me some, right?

813
00:43:44,653 --> 00:43:46,853
Thank you for everything.

814
00:43:47,786 --> 00:43:49,736
You should move to a nicer place.

815
00:43:54,509 --> 00:43:57,110
I didn't expect to get paid for it.

816
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,818
Just take it.

817
00:43:58,842 --> 00:44:02,084
You've become an important person to me.

818
00:44:12,925 --> 00:44:17,202
"100 million won"

819
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:36,277
Gosh, sweetie.

820
00:44:36,301 --> 00:44:37,277
When will you stop

821
00:44:37,301 --> 00:44:39,235
putting your books in upside down?

822
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:40,735
What will you do without me?

823
00:44:40,759 --> 00:44:42,776
You can organise them for me every day.

824
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,709
Why should I be worried?

825
00:44:46,921 --> 00:44:48,474
My gosh.

826
00:44:48,499 --> 00:44:50,434
Were you twirling your hair again?

827
00:44:50,459 --> 00:44:52,435
I don't know. When I study, I can't stop

828
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:55,035
twirling and pulling my hair out.

829
00:44:55,842 --> 00:44:57,709
Shall I just chop it off?

830
00:44:57,734 --> 00:44:59,377
Why would you chop it off?

831
00:44:59,402 --> 00:45:00,919
Don't you know how much I love

832
00:45:00,944 --> 00:45:02,753
tying your hair for you?

833
00:45:02,965 --> 00:45:05,088
Your hair is so soft, sweetie.

834
00:45:05,113 --> 00:45:06,980
It's because I take after you.

835
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:08,618
I'm running late.

836
00:45:08,642 --> 00:45:09,826
Tie my hair for me, Mum.

837
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:11,076
Okay, have some juice.

838
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:12,721
I'll be quick.

839
00:45:15,476 --> 00:45:17,160
This is good.

840
00:45:17,184 --> 00:45:18,418
Is it?

841
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:20,951
Finish it.

842
00:45:20,975 --> 00:45:23,592
I put in a lot of healthy ingredients.

843
00:45:31,073 --> 00:45:32,933
This is all useless.

844
00:45:33,502 --> 00:45:34,983
I hate this!

845
00:45:35,559 --> 00:45:36,516
Seok Kyung, what's wrong?

846
00:45:36,541 --> 00:45:37,785
Calm down, Seok Kyung!

847
00:45:37,809 --> 00:45:38,934
Let go. - Seok Kyung.

848
00:45:38,959 --> 00:45:41,817
Let go. I said, let go!

849
00:45:41,842 --> 00:45:43,860
Calm down. What's wrong?

850
00:45:43,884 --> 00:45:45,485
I hate her.

851
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:48,126
I hate her like crazy.

852
00:45:50,826 --> 00:45:53,943
Seok Kyung. Please! Just calm down.

853
00:45:53,967 --> 00:45:55,562
She left me.

854
00:45:55,587 --> 00:45:58,746
Please... - I'll never forgive her for it.

855
00:45:59,486 --> 00:46:01,789
It's okay. Calm down.

856
00:46:01,814 --> 00:46:04,514
Calm down, Seok Kyung.

857
00:46:07,076 --> 00:46:12,776
I hate her. I resent her so much.

858
00:46:13,285 --> 00:46:15,176
It's okay. It's all right.

859
00:46:16,114 --> 00:46:19,509
Mum...

860
00:46:19,984 --> 00:46:21,444
Mum...

861
00:46:21,469 --> 00:46:24,917
It's okay. Everything will be okay.

862
00:46:25,924 --> 00:46:29,525
Mum... - It's okay.

863
00:47:06,983 --> 00:47:08,975
See?

864
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:11,800
You haven't completely moved on either.

865
00:47:12,154 --> 00:47:14,592
You miss Grandpa too, don't you?

866
00:47:16,975 --> 00:47:19,051
Does Eun Byeol

867
00:47:19,351 --> 00:47:21,550
know something?

868
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:23,634
No.

869
00:47:24,402 --> 00:47:26,144
There's no way.

870
00:48:26,009 --> 00:48:27,277
I heard Dr. Ha

871
00:48:27,301 --> 00:48:28,402
will resign from his job

872
00:48:28,426 --> 00:48:29,651
and move to the US.

873
00:48:29,675 --> 00:48:31,152
Is it true?

874
00:48:31,176 --> 00:48:32,735
He wants to go back to school,

875
00:48:32,759 --> 00:48:34,318
so I have no reason to stop him.

876
00:48:34,342 --> 00:48:35,860
But rumour has it that he's leaving

877
00:48:35,884 --> 00:48:37,959
because Seo Jin is forcing him to.

878
00:48:38,574 --> 00:48:40,775
Honey, are you drunk?

879
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:41,818
Did I say it out loud?

880
00:48:41,842 --> 00:48:43,750
Yes, you did.

881
00:48:43,925 --> 00:48:44,901
I heard Seok Hoon and Seok Kyung

882
00:48:44,925 --> 00:48:46,068
will go to a school abroad.

883
00:48:46,092 --> 00:48:47,068
They want to do it,

884
00:48:47,092 --> 00:48:49,026
so I'm planning to send them for a year.

885
00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:50,776
Come on. That's a lie.

886
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,776
You just want the kids gone

887
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,985
so the two of you can move in together.

888
00:48:55,009 --> 00:48:56,444
I envy you,

889
00:48:56,468 --> 00:48:58,444
Chairman Joo and Seo Jin.

890
00:48:58,468 --> 00:48:59,526
Now that your spouses

891
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:00,609
are out of the picture,

892
00:49:00,633 --> 00:49:02,558
there's nothing stopping you.

893
00:49:03,259 --> 00:49:04,609
Oh, right.

894
00:49:04,633 --> 00:49:06,651
My gosh. - Today's the day.

895
00:49:06,675 --> 00:49:09,519
Oh Yoon Hee's sentencing hearing.

896
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:12,318
Is it today?

897
00:49:12,342 --> 00:49:13,444
I totally forgot.

898
00:49:13,468 --> 00:49:14,693
Are you sure you forgot?

899
00:49:14,717 --> 00:49:17,235
I thought you picked today on purpose

900
00:49:17,259 --> 00:49:18,776
so we could celebrate winning the war

901
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,818
at Hera Palace.

902
00:49:20,842 --> 00:49:22,402
"Celebrate"? What do you mean?

903
00:49:22,426 --> 00:49:24,375
People might get the wrong idea.

904
00:49:25,302 --> 00:49:26,567
I was just kidding.

905
00:49:26,592 --> 00:49:28,375
It was a joke!

906
00:49:29,468 --> 00:49:30,222
What do you think

907
00:49:30,247 --> 00:49:32,193
the court's decision will be?

908
00:49:32,217 --> 00:49:33,568
Given the atrocity of what she did,

909
00:49:33,592 --> 00:49:35,149
she'll get a heavy sentence, right?

910
00:49:35,174 --> 00:49:36,901
She obviously has no hope.

911
00:49:36,925 --> 00:49:38,735
She's already admitted to the murder,

912
00:49:38,759 --> 00:49:39,987
so they're holding the hearing

913
00:49:40,012 --> 00:49:41,193
just for formality's sake.

914
00:49:41,217 --> 00:49:43,068
We can't be so sure yet though.

915
00:49:43,092 --> 00:49:44,568
With all trials and hearings,

916
00:49:44,592 --> 00:49:45,609
you just never know

917
00:49:45,633 --> 00:49:47,500
until it's really over.

918
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:59,569
I'm Kim Jung Min, a reporter from SBC.

919
00:50:00,426 --> 00:50:01,901
I'd like to speak

920
00:50:01,925 --> 00:50:03,164
with Ms. Oh.

921
00:50:03,189 --> 00:50:04,235
She has to be in the courtroom now,

922
00:50:04,259 --> 00:50:05,735
so she has no time.

923
00:50:05,759 --> 00:50:07,110
And as you can see,

924
00:50:07,134 --> 00:50:09,667
she does not want to talk to you.

925
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:15,667
Soo Ryeon asked me to do this.

926
00:50:23,579 --> 00:50:27,112
Then I'll give you exactly five minutes.

927
00:50:32,489 --> 00:50:35,105
It wasn't easy for me to come here.

928
00:50:35,426 --> 00:50:37,084
How...

929
00:50:37,301 --> 00:50:39,834
How could you kill her like that?

930
00:50:39,884 --> 00:50:42,001
Just tell me why you're here.

931
00:50:43,301 --> 00:50:45,693
What is it that Soo Ryeon

932
00:50:45,717 --> 00:50:47,375
asked you to do?

933
00:50:51,595 --> 00:50:53,636
"Petition"

934
00:50:53,661 --> 00:50:55,318
What is this?

935
00:50:55,342 --> 00:50:57,001
A petition.

936
00:50:57,550 --> 00:50:59,985
Make sure Oh Yoon Hee gets it.

937
00:51:00,009 --> 00:51:01,485
Oh Yoon Hee?

938
00:51:01,509 --> 00:51:03,026
Who's that?

939
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:05,250
A close friend of mine.

940
00:51:06,217 --> 00:51:09,126
She'll turn herself in tomorrow.

941
00:51:10,009 --> 00:51:11,818
And once she does that,

942
00:51:11,842 --> 00:51:13,959
she'll be punished by the law.

943
00:51:17,301 --> 00:51:19,693
But I thought she may need this.

944
00:51:19,717 --> 00:51:23,292
Then you can give it to her yourself.

945
00:51:24,468 --> 00:51:27,277
I'm worried I'd change my mind.

946
00:51:27,301 --> 00:51:28,638
"Petition"

947
00:51:28,663 --> 00:51:30,488
Petition.

948
00:51:30,717 --> 00:51:33,485
The Oh Yoon Hee I know

949
00:51:33,509 --> 00:51:35,152
is a warm-hearted person

950
00:51:35,176 --> 00:51:37,625
who fights against injustice.

951
00:51:38,301 --> 00:51:40,250
I truly hope

952
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:42,277
that she can soon go home

953
00:51:42,301 --> 00:51:44,667
to her daughter.

954
00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:47,735
I hope she gets the chance

955
00:51:47,759 --> 00:51:50,417
to build happy memories with her daughter,

956
00:51:50,967 --> 00:51:52,913
which I never got to do

957
00:51:52,938 --> 00:51:54,972
with my daughter, Seol A.

958
00:51:55,301 --> 00:51:57,068
And thus, I earnestly ask for leniency

959
00:51:57,092 --> 00:51:59,126
at her sentencing.

960
00:51:59,426 --> 00:52:00,943
From Min Seol A's mother,

961
00:52:00,967 --> 00:52:02,792
Sim Soo Ryeon.

962
00:52:03,592 --> 00:52:06,042
I don't care what you did in the past.

963
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,609
Why did you kill someone

964
00:52:08,633 --> 00:52:10,750
who was this worried about you?

965
00:52:12,675 --> 00:52:15,318
I'm here because of my promise to her,

966
00:52:15,342 --> 00:52:16,277
but it's awful

967
00:52:16,301 --> 00:52:17,526
to have to see you like this.

968
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:19,193
How could you do something like that

969
00:52:19,217 --> 00:52:20,485
just to take her place?

970
00:52:20,509 --> 00:52:23,250
I heard she was very nice to you.

971
00:52:23,509 --> 00:52:25,110
Did you think

972
00:52:25,134 --> 00:52:26,776
both the penthouse and Joo Dan Tae

973
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,229
would become yours once you killed her?

974
00:52:49,342 --> 00:52:50,769
"Court"

975
00:53:02,871 --> 00:53:04,052
Mum.

976
00:53:15,195 --> 00:53:16,421
Defendant Oh Yoon Hee

977
00:53:16,446 --> 00:53:17,922
yearned to have the life

978
00:53:17,947 --> 00:53:19,256
that the victim had,

979
00:53:19,281 --> 00:53:20,840
and she has confessed that she hated Sim

980
00:53:20,865 --> 00:53:22,800
to the point that she wanted to kill her.

981
00:53:22,825 --> 00:53:24,884
Also, she sneaked into the penthouse

982
00:53:24,909 --> 00:53:26,484
and even tried on Sim's dress.

983
00:53:26,509 --> 00:53:30,276
It was all caught on the CCTV footage.

984
00:53:30,301 --> 00:53:31,526
Counsel, is there anything

985
00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:33,209
you'd like to say?

986
00:53:33,842 --> 00:53:35,485
The defendant has already admitted

987
00:53:35,509 --> 00:53:37,876
to everything.

988
00:53:38,426 --> 00:53:40,339
However, I'd like to ask you

989
00:53:40,364 --> 00:53:41,634
to please take into consideration

990
00:53:41,659 --> 00:53:43,351
that she struggled financially

991
00:53:43,376 --> 00:53:45,121
for a very long time and that

992
00:53:45,146 --> 00:53:46,620
she had to raise her daughter

993
00:53:46,645 --> 00:53:48,971
all on her own as a single mother.

994
00:53:49,667 --> 00:53:51,659
This is so much fun.

995
00:53:53,717 --> 00:53:56,250
Yes! - Let's go!

996
00:54:01,592 --> 00:54:03,459
Dance!

997
00:54:12,301 --> 00:54:13,985
I will announce the court's decision.

998
00:54:14,009 --> 00:54:15,693
Defendant Oh Yoon Hee

999
00:54:15,717 --> 00:54:17,735
was jealous of the victim

1000
00:54:17,759 --> 00:54:19,860
who trusted her and helped her.

1001
00:54:19,884 --> 00:54:21,776
She brutally murdered the victim

1002
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,568
by stabbing her multiple times.

1003
00:54:23,592 --> 00:54:25,485
Given the atrocity of her crime,

1004
00:54:25,509 --> 00:54:26,943
her ill intention,

1005
00:54:26,967 --> 00:54:28,318
and the emotional trauma

1006
00:54:28,342 --> 00:54:29,901
she has caused the bereaved,

1007
00:54:29,925 --> 00:54:31,985
a severe punishment is unavoidable.

1008
00:54:32,009 --> 00:54:33,360
The Department of Justice

1009
00:54:33,384 --> 00:54:35,235
has concluded that she must be

1010
00:54:35,259 --> 00:54:36,877
permanently isolated from society

1011
00:54:36,902 --> 00:54:38,900
due to the brutal murder she committed.

1012
00:54:38,925 --> 00:54:40,526
Ergo, we sentence her

1013
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:42,792
to life imprisonment.

1014
00:54:59,594 --> 00:55:01,828
"Seoul Gangnam Police Station"

1015
00:55:02,592 --> 00:55:04,860
Oh, Secretary Cho.

1016
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:05,985
Chairman Joo wants you

1017
00:55:06,009 --> 00:55:08,042
at the penthouse immediately.

1018
00:55:09,009 --> 00:55:10,792
Chairman Joo.

1019
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:21,084
Chairman Joo, are you in...

1020
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:33,342
Soo Ryeon?

1021
00:55:52,784 --> 00:55:56,025
Soo Ryeon. Soo Ryeon.

1022
00:55:58,717 --> 00:56:01,167
Soo Ryeon, wake up.

1023
00:56:01,634 --> 00:56:03,501
Soo Ryeon!

1024
00:56:04,717 --> 00:56:06,818
I'll call an ambulance for you.

1025
00:56:06,842 --> 00:56:09,334
Hang in there, okay?

1026
00:56:09,634 --> 00:56:11,459
Soo Ryeon...

1027
00:56:14,717 --> 00:56:16,109
What? Soo Ryeon.

1028
00:56:16,133 --> 00:56:18,626
I can't hear you.

1029
00:56:19,467 --> 00:56:21,334
Run...

1030
00:56:21,884 --> 00:56:24,125
Run.

1031
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:25,434
Soo Ryeon.

1032
00:56:37,884 --> 00:56:40,042
I didn't...

00:56:41,842 --> 00:56:44,084
kill Soo Ryeon.

1034
00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:46,652
Mum.

1035
00:56:46,676 --> 00:56:50,125
What did you say, Ms. Oh?

1036
00:56:50,842 --> 00:56:52,709
I, Oh Yoon Hee,

1037
00:56:53,634 --> 00:56:57,167
did not kill Sim Soo Ryeon, Your Honour.

1038
00:56:59,509 --> 00:57:02,193
I really didn't kill her.

1039
00:57:02,217 --> 00:57:04,875
I swear on my daughter's name.

1040
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:07,250
I'm not the killer.

1041
00:57:07,425 --> 00:57:09,818
Please reinvestigate the case.

1042
00:57:09,842 --> 00:57:12,542
Everything was fabricated!

1043
00:57:12,884 --> 00:57:14,318
I'm not the culprit.

1044
00:57:14,342 --> 00:57:16,631
I did not kill Sim Soo Ryeon!

1045
00:57:16,656 --> 00:57:18,530
Reinvestigate the case, Your Honour!

1046
00:57:18,555 --> 00:57:20,468
I'm not the culprit!

1047
00:57:20,493 --> 00:57:22,126
Mum!

1048
00:57:22,151 --> 00:57:25,084
Ro Na. Ro Na...

1049
00:57:25,109 --> 00:57:27,126
I didn't kill her!

1050
00:57:27,150 --> 00:57:30,184
I'm not the killer!

1051
00:57:31,001 --> 00:57:33,643
It wasn't me. I didn't kill her!

1052
00:57:33,667 --> 00:57:35,309
This hearing doesn't count.

1053
00:57:35,342 --> 00:57:38,043
This doesn't count. Tell the judge!

1054
00:57:38,068 --> 00:57:39,568
I want another hearing!

1055
00:57:39,593 --> 00:57:41,376
Please, this is wrong!

1056
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:43,044
I didn't kill her.

1057
00:57:43,068 --> 00:57:44,752
I'm innocent.

1058
00:57:44,776 --> 00:57:46,168
I didn't kill her.

1059
00:57:46,192 --> 00:57:48,586
No, please! It wasn't me!

1060
00:57:48,611 --> 00:57:50,709
"Ministry of Justice"

1061
00:57:50,734 --> 00:57:52,333
Quick, they're leaving!

1062
00:57:57,062 --> 00:57:59,617
"Ministry of Justice, Emergency Convoy"

1063
00:59:02,737 --> 00:59:05,142
We need help. Send backup.

1064
00:59:05,167 --> 00:59:06,082
2607 Oh Yoon Hee

1065
00:59:06,107 --> 00:59:08,101
has escaped during transport.

1066
00:59:08,126 --> 00:59:10,826
Send backup immediately.

1067
00:59:49,092 --> 00:59:50,151
Logan.

1068
00:59:50,175 --> 00:59:52,125
What are you doing here?

1069
00:59:53,092 --> 00:59:55,084
What's going on?

1070
01:00:02,870 --> 01:00:03,777
Breaking news.

1071
01:00:03,801 --> 01:00:05,787
A defendant who received a life sentence

1072
01:00:05,812 --> 01:00:06,675
in court earlier today

1073
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:07,944
has escaped the escort vehicle

1074
01:00:07,968 --> 01:00:09,765
during a rollover accident while being

1075
01:00:09,790 --> 01:00:11,652
transported back to the detention centre.

1076
01:00:11,676 --> 01:00:13,360
Oh, the defendant who is now on the run,

1077
01:00:13,384 --> 01:00:14,610
is the assailant

1078
01:00:14,634 --> 01:00:16,137
in the Hera Palace murder case.

1079
01:00:16,162 --> 01:00:18,026
She stood trial for six months... - Ro Na.

1080
01:00:18,050 --> 01:00:20,372
but she suddenly denied all charges today

1081
01:00:20,397 --> 01:00:23,218
and caused a scene in the courtroom.

1082
01:00:23,242 --> 01:00:25,926
The police are searching the vicinity...

1083
01:00:25,950 --> 01:00:27,832
Ro Na. - and checking CCTV footage...

1084
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:29,401
No!

1085
01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:32,775
Where are you going?

1086
01:00:32,826 --> 01:00:34,968
Logan, Ro Na...

1087
01:00:34,992 --> 01:00:36,593
I need to see Ro Na.

1088
01:00:36,617 --> 01:00:38,301
I must let her know that I'm alive.

1089
01:00:38,325 --> 01:00:39,385
The cops are camping out

1090
01:00:39,409 --> 01:00:40,984
in front of your place.

1091
01:00:43,450 --> 01:00:45,343
You can go if you want to get caught.

1092
01:00:45,367 --> 01:00:47,802
No... Ro Na.

1093
01:00:47,826 --> 01:00:49,900
What will happen to Ro Na now?

1094
01:00:53,926 --> 01:00:56,875
You are worried about your daughter

1095
01:00:57,384 --> 01:01:00,459
when you've killed two people?

1096
01:01:00,842 --> 01:01:03,917
I must say, you really

1097
01:01:04,259 --> 01:01:07,042
give me the creeps.

1098
01:01:07,092 --> 01:01:09,526
Two? What are you talking about?

1099
01:01:09,550 --> 01:01:12,276
Now that the only witness is gone,

1100
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:13,318
you must've thought

1101
01:01:13,342 --> 01:01:15,542
you could cover it up forever.

1102
01:01:16,259 --> 01:01:18,042
I'm sorry to disappoint you,

1103
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:20,109
but Soo Ryeon told me everything

1104
01:01:20,133 --> 01:01:22,000
before she died.

1105
01:01:22,425 --> 01:01:24,109
She told me that you

1106
01:01:24,133 --> 01:01:26,485
killed my little sister.

1107
01:01:26,509 --> 01:01:28,209
"Little sister"?

1108
01:01:29,009 --> 01:01:30,276
Your little sister?

1109
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:31,652
That's right.

1110
01:01:31,676 --> 01:01:33,542
My sister.

1111
01:01:33,676 --> 01:01:36,584
My sister, Min Seol A.

1112
01:01:41,550 --> 01:01:44,417
Finally, we meet.

1113
01:01:44,968 --> 01:01:47,360
I came all the way to Korea to track down

1114
01:01:47,384 --> 01:01:49,943
the person who killed my sister.

1115
01:01:49,968 --> 01:01:51,833
And that person...

1116
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:54,728
was you?

1117
01:01:56,509 --> 01:01:59,584
Why did you do it? Why?

1118
01:02:00,312 --> 01:02:03,429
Why did you kill her?

1119
01:02:03,753 --> 01:02:06,994
Why did you have to kill that poor thing?

1120
01:02:08,834 --> 01:02:10,291
Soo Ryeon

1121
01:02:10,504 --> 01:02:12,938
trusted you and waited for you.

1122
01:02:13,050 --> 01:02:15,273
She trusted you'd turn yourself in.

1123
01:02:15,298 --> 01:02:16,610
Even though she knew

1124
01:02:16,634 --> 01:02:17,985
that you killed Seol A,

1125
01:02:18,009 --> 01:02:19,485
she trusted you

1126
01:02:19,509 --> 01:02:21,083
and waited for you until the end.

1127
01:02:21,108 --> 01:02:24,542
How could you backstab her like that?

1128
01:02:24,567 --> 01:02:27,446
Had she not stopped me,

1129
01:02:27,926 --> 01:02:28,985
I would've killed you

1130
01:02:29,009 --> 01:02:30,985
in that very moment.

1131
01:02:31,009 --> 01:02:33,970
Then Soo Ryeon wouldn't have died in vain.

1132
01:02:33,995 --> 01:02:37,026
No, I didn't kill Soo Ryeon!

1133
01:02:37,050 --> 01:02:39,042
Stop lying!

1134
01:02:40,005 --> 01:02:42,275
You joined hands with Joo Dan Tae

1135
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,709
and tried to get rid of Soo Ryeon.

1136
01:02:45,013 --> 01:02:46,693
But you know what?

1137
01:02:46,717 --> 01:02:49,276
She knew all about it,

1138
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:50,708
but she still tried to protect you

1139
01:02:50,733 --> 01:02:52,459
until her final moments.

1140
01:02:52,801 --> 01:02:54,875
So how could you

1141
01:02:55,092 --> 01:02:57,275
do something like that to her?

1142
01:02:57,300 --> 01:02:59,580
Don't even call yourself human.

1143
01:03:00,369 --> 01:03:02,325
You deserve to die.

1144
01:03:02,888 --> 01:03:04,485
You don't deserve the air you breathe,

1145
01:03:04,509 --> 01:03:06,367
you evil woman.

1146
01:03:11,909 --> 01:03:14,692
What? I can't hear you.

1147
01:03:15,425 --> 01:03:17,250
Run...

1148
01:03:17,550 --> 01:03:19,917
Run.

1149
01:03:22,133 --> 01:03:24,042
You're right.

1150
01:03:25,884 --> 01:03:29,125
I am responsible for Soo Ryeon's death

1151
01:03:30,337 --> 01:03:33,329
because I wanted her gone.

1152
01:03:35,026 --> 01:03:36,726
You're right.

1153
01:03:37,009 --> 01:03:38,109
Just kill me.

1154
01:03:38,133 --> 01:03:39,985
I deserve to die.

1155
01:03:40,009 --> 01:03:41,401
But just wait

1156
01:03:41,425 --> 01:03:44,584
until I get Soo Ryeon's revenge.

1157
01:03:45,092 --> 01:03:46,658
You can kill me after I get back

1158
01:03:46,683 --> 01:03:48,571
at Joo Dan Tae and Cheon Seo Jin

1159
01:03:48,596 --> 01:03:49,902
for killing her.

1160
01:03:49,926 --> 01:03:52,235
I'll let you kill me after I do that.

1161
01:03:52,259 --> 01:03:53,902
I give you my word.

1162
01:03:53,926 --> 01:03:55,568
So please,

1163
01:03:55,592 --> 01:03:57,777
let me go.

1164
01:03:57,801 --> 01:04:00,026
Please help me. Please.

1165
01:04:00,050 --> 01:04:01,068
I beg you.

1166
01:04:01,092 --> 01:04:03,084
Do you seriously expect me

1167
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:05,668
to believe you again?

1168
01:04:05,801 --> 01:04:07,568
No.

1169
01:04:07,592 --> 01:04:10,167
You'll die here today.

1170
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:12,526
The police will never find you,

1171
01:04:12,550 --> 01:04:13,735
so you'll be remembered

1172
01:04:13,759 --> 01:04:17,167
as a brutal murderer and fugitive forever.

1173
01:04:17,759 --> 01:04:19,401
Just let people remember you

1174
01:04:19,425 --> 01:04:20,902
as a cold-blooded mother

1175
01:04:20,926 --> 01:04:23,459
who even abandoned her own daughter.

1176
01:04:23,801 --> 01:04:26,626
What can I do to earn your trust?

1177
01:04:27,425 --> 01:04:29,370
I didn't kill her.

1178
01:04:29,395 --> 01:04:31,900
I swear, I didn't kill Soo Ryeon!

1179
01:04:31,925 --> 01:04:34,317
Joo Dan Tae framed me for everything!

1180
01:04:34,342 --> 01:04:36,109
Don't you dare try to trick me!

1181
01:04:36,133 --> 01:04:38,401
You must suffer the same way!

1182
01:04:38,425 --> 01:04:40,833
Just like how Soo Ryeon died!

1183
01:04:41,842 --> 01:04:45,042
And just like how Seol A died.

1184
01:04:45,592 --> 01:04:47,443
A miserable,

1185
01:04:47,467 --> 01:04:49,709
gruesome death.

1186
01:05:01,509 --> 01:05:03,334
Fine.

1187
01:05:03,634 --> 01:05:06,542
I'll stop asking you to believe me.

1188
01:05:08,968 --> 01:05:11,875
It is true that I killed Min Seol A,

1189
01:05:12,801 --> 01:05:16,209
and I will get the punishment I deserve.

1190
01:05:17,509 --> 01:05:18,985
Kill me.

1191
01:05:19,009 --> 01:05:20,833
Go ahead and kill me now.

1192
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:23,250
But don't forget.

1193
01:05:24,384 --> 01:05:26,250
Even if you kill me,

1194
01:05:26,509 --> 01:05:28,959
the person who killed Soo Ryeon

1195
01:05:29,676 --> 01:05:31,792
will stay alive.

1196
01:06:21,182 --> 01:06:22,559
Ro Na.

1197
01:06:23,628 --> 01:06:27,328
I'm sorry.

1198
01:07:53,726 --> 01:07:56,160
"My friend"

1199
01:07:56,184 --> 01:07:57,826
Soo Ryeon.

1200
01:07:57,850 --> 01:08:00,202
Since we have a lot to celebrate,

1201
01:08:00,227 --> 01:08:02,331
why don't we take a picture together?

1202
01:08:03,850 --> 01:08:05,244
Sure.

1203
01:08:07,892 --> 01:08:09,550
All right.

1204
01:08:10,350 --> 01:08:13,301
Come on. That's lame.

1205
01:08:18,309 --> 01:08:19,201
Ta-da.

1206
01:08:19,225 --> 01:08:21,076
Polaroid?

1207
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:23,384
Gosh, you're so old-fashioned.

1208
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:26,842
I like all things classic.

1209
01:08:27,476 --> 01:08:29,368
Since this is our first picture together,

1210
01:08:29,392 --> 01:08:31,426
I wanted it to be more meaningful.

1211
01:08:31,726 --> 01:08:33,452
A one-of-a-kind photo.

1212
01:08:33,476 --> 01:08:36,035
Gosh, how corny.

1213
01:08:36,059 --> 01:08:37,243
This is why it's dangerous

1214
01:08:37,267 --> 01:08:38,493
to hang out with the rich.

1215
01:08:38,517 --> 01:08:41,592
You people live in your own la-la land.

1216
01:08:42,350 --> 01:08:44,744
All right. My beautiful friend, Soo Ryeon.

1217
01:08:44,768 --> 01:08:46,588
I love you!

1218
01:08:47,642 --> 01:08:50,134
I hope we look good. - I know.

1219
01:08:50,309 --> 01:08:51,562
Let's see.

1220
01:09:24,511 --> 01:09:27,830
=Penthouse=

1221
01:10:06,191 --> 01:10:09,392
"Thank you for watching Penthouse"

1222
01:10:11,369 --> 01:10:18,001
"Penthouse will be back with Season 2"
