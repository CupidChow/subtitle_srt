Hello?

00:01:06,169 --> 00:01:07,877
What? Where are you calling from?

00:01:09,877 --> 00:01:10,794

Yes, okay.

What did you just say?

Once she goes out and speaks up,

45

it'll be turned into a social issue

46
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:03,752
that children from rich families

47
00:04:03,836 --> 00:04:05,169
bullied another kid as a group.

You're right. These days,

49
00:04:06,752 --> 00:04:08,836
it's a weakness to be rich.

But you know,

51
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:13,585
I can't really have any fun at this party

Hey, look. - Wait.

64
00:04:36,086 --> 00:04:37,502

since this is a special occasion.

Wow.

68
00:04:43,502 --> 00:04:45,252
I got this off an auction on Only Watch.

69
00:04:45,335 --> 00:04:46,252
And the final price

70
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,128
came to 1.5 billion won!

71
00:04:48,252 --> 00:04:49,210
All right!

72
00:04:49,752 --> 00:04:50,794

73
00:04:50,877 --> 00:04:52,627
Goodness, what if you lose it?

74
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,210
You're showing off a bit too much.

75
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,627
All right, then.

00:04:56,002 --> 00:04:57,752

Forget all the depressing thoughts.

79
00:05:01,252 --> 00:05:03,710

She was adopted to the US,

90
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:24,210
so why did she come back?

Why did he take a photo with Min Seol A?

99

Dang, what's weird about an assemblyman

100

taking a photo with an orphan?

101
00:05:41,293 --> 00:05:42,252
Darn it.

102
00:05:45,128 --> 00:05:45,961
I took care of her

103
00:05:46,044 --> 00:05:46,961
after her parents abandoned her.

104
00:05:47,128 --> 00:05:48,210
How dare you make a scene here?

105
00:05:48,293 --> 00:05:50,128
There must be a reason she was sent back.

106
00:05:50,752 --> 00:05:52,210
Who adopted her?

107
00:05:52,377 --> 00:05:53,669
Will you let me go?

108
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,044
Who were those people?

109
00:05:56,169 --> 00:05:57,419
Please tell me anything.

110
00:05:57,502 --> 00:05:59,752
Darn it. You're unbelievably annoying!

111
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:02,585

140
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,293
Everyone would think

145

She's not an ordinary girl.

I'm sorry, ma'am.

152
00:08:43,335 --> 00:08:44,710
You didn't answer when I called out,

153
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:46,460
so I was afraid you might have collapsed.

154

Honey, come here. Honey.

174
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,194
What's wrong?

175
00:13:27,277 --> 00:13:28,277
Look at that.

176
00:13:33,602 --> 00:13:35,019
My goodness. One second.

177
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:36,810
I can't believe this.

178
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,068
Dr Ha, hurry. - Awesome.

179
00:13:39,093 --> 00:13:41,343
What is it? What's going on?

180
00:14:09,152 --> 00:14:10,485
It looks like she died on the spot.

181
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:14,636
That's...

182
00:14:15,385 --> 00:14:16,677
It's her.

183
00:14:17,135 --> 00:14:18,594
You know, that girl.

184
00:14:18,969 --> 00:14:20,177
Who is it? Who?

185
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:21,769
Min Seol A.

186
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:23,227
The fake tutor who taught our kids.

187
00:14:24,143 --> 00:14:25,060
This is insane.

188
00:14:25,594 --> 00:14:27,636
Why did she die?

189
00:14:27,719 --> 00:14:29,510
Does she know how much that statue cost?

190
00:14:29,677 --> 00:14:31,886
Why did she die there of all places?

191
00:14:31,969 --> 00:14:34,010
She's nothing but trouble to the end.

192
00:14:34,093 --> 00:14:35,552
Today was a very important day.

193
00:14:35,928 --> 00:14:36,886
She fell and died there

194
00:14:36,969 --> 00:14:38,510
on purpose to get us in trouble

195
00:14:38,594 --> 00:14:39,510
by putting herself on display.

196
00:14:39,594 --> 00:14:41,260
You said we had nothing to worry about.

197
00:14:41,385 --> 00:14:42,510
I thought she was locked up.

198
00:14:42,844 --> 00:14:44,636
Did you let her go?

199
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:46,010
Are you insane? Why would I do that?

200
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,677
Then who is it? Who let her go?

201
00:14:48,969 --> 00:14:50,844
That's not what's important right now.

202
00:14:51,093 --> 00:14:52,135
It won't help the situation

203
00:14:52,219 --> 00:14:53,802
if we get suspicious of each other.

204
00:14:53,886 --> 00:14:54,802
First off,

205
00:14:55,177 --> 00:14:56,469
we need to remove her body.

206
00:14:56,928 --> 00:14:58,010
In two hours,

207
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,594
Hera Palace's first anniversary ceremony

208
00:14:59,677 --> 00:15:00,928
will be held around this fountain.

209
00:15:01,344 --> 00:15:02,385
We invited all kinds of famous people.

210
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:03,928
Are you going to let them see that?

211
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:04,928
Exactly.

212
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:07,010
So let's report this to the police first.

213
00:15:07,052 --> 00:15:08,135
Once the police get here,

214
00:15:08,219 --> 00:15:09,677
they'll put us down as suspects

215
00:15:09,761 --> 00:15:11,052
as well as our kids.

216
00:15:11,385 --> 00:15:12,385
What about our kids?

217
00:15:12,969 --> 00:15:13,844
Wait.

218
00:15:14,636 --> 00:15:15,802
Are you saying our kids killed her?

219
00:15:15,886 --> 00:15:17,719
We know that they didn't.

220
00:15:17,886 --> 00:15:19,219
But the police won't share the same idea.

221
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:20,677
If we get unlucky

222
00:15:20,761 --> 00:15:22,302
and the police end up finding her phone,

223
00:15:22,761 --> 00:15:24,302
that moment will be

224
00:15:24,385 --> 00:15:26,344
the end of our children's future.

225
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:28,052
You all need to listen up.

226
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:30,302
Min Seol A has

227
00:15:30,761 --> 00:15:32,928
never been to Hera Palace at this hour.

228
00:15:33,552 --> 00:15:34,510
What do you mean?

229
00:15:34,761 --> 00:15:36,302
I'm saying Min Seol A

230
00:15:37,219 --> 00:15:38,844
didn't fall down and die right here.

231
00:15:39,969 --> 00:15:42,010
Did she say she lives in Bosong Village?

232
00:15:43,052 --> 00:15:44,469
Are you suggesting

233
00:15:44,552 --> 00:15:45,886
that we dispose of her dead body?

234
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,594
Article 161 of the Criminal Code says

235
00:15:48,677 --> 00:15:50,135
anyone who abandons, hides, or takes away

236
00:15:50,469 --> 00:15:52,052
someone's dead body, bones, remains,

237
00:15:52,135 --> 00:15:54,010
and other articles in the burial place

238
00:15:54,677 --> 00:15:56,844
will face up to seven years in prison.

239
00:15:57,135 --> 00:15:58,093
We don't have any other choice

240
00:15:58,177 --> 00:15:59,427
to protect our children.

241
00:15:59,886 --> 00:16:01,636
That girl can't come back alive anyway.

242
00:16:01,719 --> 00:16:02,844
And all of us

243
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:05,177
can't suffer just because of her.

244
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:06,385
I'm for that idea.

245
00:16:06,802 --> 00:16:07,719
We must protect

246
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:09,469
our kids and Hera Palace.

247
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:10,677
Let's follow the majority rule.

248
00:16:11,052 --> 00:16:12,010
However,

249
00:16:12,469 --> 00:16:13,677
whatever the result may be,

250
00:16:14,052 --> 00:16:15,677
we must all go with the result.

251
00:16:15,928 --> 00:16:16,886
Let's vote by a show of hands.

252
00:16:18,093 --> 00:16:19,010
Who's for it?

253
00:16:25,677 --> 00:16:26,636
All right.

254
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:27,969
We have

255
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,636
an hour and 50 minutes until the ceremony.

256
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:31,928
We can't lose a minute or even a second.

257
00:16:32,427 --> 00:16:34,010
Gentlemen, we'll move the body.

258
00:16:34,302 --> 00:16:36,135
Ladies, take charge of the fountain.

259
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,385
Leave it to me.

260
00:16:38,636 --> 00:16:39,469
I can definitely do that.

261
00:16:39,594 --> 00:16:42,010
Ma Ri, please take charge of the scene.

262
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,427
Remember.

263
00:16:43,552 --> 00:16:45,427
Everything must look perfect

264
00:16:45,802 --> 00:16:47,344
before the anniversary ceremony begins.

265
00:16:47,427 --> 00:16:48,594
Wait.

266
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:51,969
Why should we listen to what you say?

267
00:16:54,219 --> 00:16:55,177
Because none of us is

268
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,427
free from the responsibility

269
00:16:56,969 --> 00:16:57,969
for Min Seol A's death.

270
00:17:10,719 --> 00:17:12,427
Is this big enough?

271
00:17:16,552 --> 00:17:17,427
This is perfect.

272
00:17:17,844 --> 00:17:18,802
Let's clean that up first.

273
00:17:19,219 --> 00:17:21,928
Don't you think we should call 119?

274
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,844
I already told you. We can't do that!

275
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,177
If the news reports

276
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,260
on the death of a kid at Hera Palace,

277
00:17:26,344 --> 00:17:27,719
our house price will drop in an instant.

278
00:17:29,636 --> 00:17:31,385
On top of that, she recorded

279
00:17:31,469 --> 00:17:33,385
our kids' mischief on her phone.

280
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:35,636
Do you want Min Hyuk to get expelled

281
00:17:35,886 --> 00:17:37,260
and live his entire life

282
00:17:37,344 --> 00:17:38,469
as an assailant of a group assault?

283
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,969
I didn't say that!

284
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:42,802
Darn it.

285
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,510
Let's dry her up.

286
00:17:46,844 --> 00:17:48,469
It's not supposed to rain until tomorrow.

287
00:17:48,552 --> 00:17:49,427
The police will get suspicious

288
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,469
if she's found wet.

289
00:17:52,552 --> 00:17:54,427
What are you doing? Dry her up with me.

290
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,344
Goodness. - Oh dear.

291
00:17:55,427 --> 00:17:56,385
My gosh.

292
00:17:57,344 --> 00:17:58,385
You expect me to do it too?

293
00:18:14,728 --> 00:18:16,979
Let's take off.

294
00:18:19,805 --> 00:18:21,680
"1 hour 25 minutes left"

295
00:18:21,705 --> 00:18:23,289
"until the anniversary ceremony"

296
00:18:29,436 --> 00:18:30,352
What?

297
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:33,394
What's going on?

298
00:18:33,727 --> 00:18:34,602
Why did it stop?

299
00:18:42,727 --> 00:18:43,643
Excuse me.

300
00:18:43,894 --> 00:18:44,727
The police.

301
00:18:47,528 --> 00:18:48,569
"Police"

302
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:49,528
Wow.

303
00:18:50,944 --> 00:18:53,069
You're all dressed wonderfully.

304
00:19:09,714 --> 00:19:10,881
"Sugar and me"

305
00:19:21,969 --> 00:19:23,802
I heard an assemblyman will be

306
00:19:23,885 --> 00:19:25,760
attending the anniversary ceremony.

307
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,219
Attorney Lee asked for extra security

308
00:19:28,302 --> 00:19:29,261
at our patrol division,

309
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:30,969
so I came to visit you first.

310
00:19:33,552 --> 00:19:35,593
Right, we received a report that

311
00:19:35,677 --> 00:19:36,635
they heard someone

312
00:19:36,719 --> 00:19:38,177
screaming in the building.

313
00:19:41,469 --> 00:19:42,802
The residents were cheering loudly

314
00:19:42,927 --> 00:19:44,760
during the fireworks.

315
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,510
Someone must have misunderstood

316
00:19:46,593 --> 00:19:47,677
and made a report.

317
00:19:48,136 --> 00:19:49,927
And I asked our security team

318
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,094
to guard the assemblyman,

319
00:19:51,177 --> 00:19:52,469
so you can return to your post.

320
00:19:53,136 --> 00:19:55,052
I see. In that case, I'll leave.

321
00:19:57,969 --> 00:19:58,844
Wow.

322
00:19:59,302 --> 00:20:01,261
Are you taking a golf trip?

323
00:20:01,428 --> 00:20:02,302
Goodness.

324
00:20:05,052 --> 00:20:06,136
Yes, you're right.

325
00:20:08,719 --> 00:20:09,593
What can I do?

326
00:20:09,885 --> 00:20:10,802
Yes.

327
00:20:11,219 --> 00:20:12,219
I'm going out this weekend,

328
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:14,010
so I wanted to put it in my car now.

329
00:20:14,094 --> 00:20:15,094
I see.

330
00:20:15,219 --> 00:20:16,219
A golf trip.

331
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:20,969
Are you all right?

332
00:20:21,052 --> 00:20:24,344
Goodness, I guess you had a lot to drink.

333
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,969
You're all dressed very nicely.

334
00:20:30,052 --> 00:20:33,302
So why are you wearing latex gloves?

335
00:20:36,844 --> 00:20:38,052
We helped the staff carry

336
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:40,010
the champagne bottles for the party.

337
00:20:40,428 --> 00:20:41,552
In this day and age,

338
00:20:41,635 --> 00:20:43,719
we have to be very kind to our employees.

339
00:20:45,302 --> 00:20:47,386
You have great manners.

340
00:20:48,469 --> 00:20:49,552
I see. - Yes.

341
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:52,510
You should go first.

342
00:20:52,802 --> 00:20:54,094
You must be busy on duty.

343
00:20:54,969 --> 00:20:55,885
Shall I, then?

344
00:21:11,677 --> 00:21:12,593
Let's go.

345
00:21:24,219 --> 00:21:25,344
That's Min Seol A's bag.

346
00:21:26,052 --> 00:21:27,428
I wrote down her suicide note.

347
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,510
You can put it there with her.

348
00:21:28,844 --> 00:21:29,719
"A suicide note"?

349
00:21:29,802 --> 00:21:31,302
I knew it, Seo Jin.

350
00:21:31,386 --> 00:21:32,302
Not only are you pretty,

351
00:21:32,386 --> 00:21:33,593
you're also astute.

352
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:37,136
"I shouldn't have been born.

353
00:21:37,219 --> 00:21:39,136
I want you all dead."

354
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:40,510
That's a nice phrase.

355
00:21:41,344 --> 00:21:42,885
How's the fountain coming along?

356
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,677
Why did she die here of all places

357
00:21:46,052 --> 00:21:48,719
and make us do so much work?

358
00:21:49,052 --> 00:21:51,094
I never liked her from the get-go.

359
00:21:51,177 --> 00:21:52,052
Don't you think

360
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:54,302
you're too harsh on the dead girl?

361
00:21:54,719 --> 00:21:55,969
She's still a little kid.

362
00:21:56,219 --> 00:21:57,302
That's odd.

363
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:59,927
Why do you keep taking her side?

364
00:22:00,677 --> 00:22:01,885
Do you somehow feel guilty?

365
00:22:02,885 --> 00:22:04,302
What are you talking about?

366
00:22:05,261 --> 00:22:09,052
Do you really want to bring it on?

367
00:22:09,136 --> 00:22:10,344
Wait, don't do that. - Hey.

368
00:22:10,428 --> 00:22:11,635
Bring it on. - No, wait.

369
00:22:11,719 --> 00:22:12,844
Bring it on. - Goodness!

370
00:22:13,052 --> 00:22:15,010
We have no time to get into a fight.

371
00:22:15,428 --> 00:22:17,386
When will you wipe all the bloodstain?

372
00:22:20,802 --> 00:22:21,844
We're in a total hurry.

373
00:22:21,927 --> 00:22:23,552
Why is there so much traffic at this hour?

374
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:25,844
There's no traffic.

375
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:26,885
It's a drink drive checkpoint.

376
00:22:26,969 --> 00:22:28,552
"Sobriety Checkpoint"

377
00:22:28,635 --> 00:22:29,510
What? Why?

378
00:22:29,927 --> 00:22:31,552
Why did we forget about this?

379
00:22:31,969 --> 00:22:34,094
We all had a drink today.

380
00:22:34,677 --> 00:22:36,219
Should we have called for a chauffeur?

381
00:22:36,719 --> 00:22:38,802
This will be the end of our lives.

382
00:22:38,885 --> 00:22:40,010
Calm down, will you?

383
00:22:41,094 --> 00:22:42,010
If there's any problem,

384
00:22:42,261 --> 00:22:43,469
I'll do anything to cover it up.

385
00:22:43,813 --> 00:22:45,522
"Sobriety Checkpoint"

386
00:22:47,136 --> 00:22:48,261
"Police"

387
00:22:50,885 --> 00:22:51,760
Hello, sir.

388
00:22:51,844 --> 00:22:52,844
This is a sobriety checkpoint.

389
00:22:53,802 --> 00:22:54,677
Blow into it.

390
00:22:55,927 --> 00:22:56,802
Wait.

391
00:22:57,719 --> 00:22:58,760
Officer.

392
00:22:59,593 --> 00:23:00,844
I can't believe this.

393
00:23:01,428 --> 00:23:02,510
You look exactly like

394
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,635
my late brother who recently died.

395
00:23:05,927 --> 00:23:07,719
My goodness, Mother. My goodness.

396
00:23:08,844 --> 00:23:09,802
Take this.

397
00:23:10,052 --> 00:23:11,844
You should have a team dinner with this.

398
00:23:12,344 --> 00:23:13,844
Are you bribing me?

399
00:23:15,052 --> 00:23:16,510
The world isn't like that now.

400
00:23:16,885 --> 00:23:18,719
You can't pull this anymore.

401
00:23:19,677 --> 00:23:20,635
Come on, blow.

402
00:23:34,469 --> 00:23:35,428
Let him go.

403
00:23:42,469 --> 00:23:43,344
What happened?

404
00:23:43,927 --> 00:23:44,844
I didn't drink.

405
00:23:45,552 --> 00:23:47,802
Darn it. Why are you saying that now?

406
00:23:48,386 --> 00:23:49,677
You scared me.

407
00:23:49,969 --> 00:23:50,927
You never asked.

408
00:23:51,386 --> 00:23:52,261
Anyway,

409
00:23:53,052 --> 00:23:54,094
Lady Luck is on our side too.

00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:58,010
"Bosong Village"

411
00:24:04,885 --> 00:24:06,052
Cut off the security camera.

"Bosong Village, On patrol duty"

413
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,760
Okay.

414
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:31,136
Darn it.

415
00:24:33,927 --> 00:24:35,219
Dang. Go.

416
00:24:36,885 --> 00:24:38,136
Get in there.

00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,510
What a relief.

423
00:25:00,052 --> 00:25:01,510
We wiped away all the bloodstain.

424
00:25:01,885 --> 00:25:03,844
Let's hope the men get their job done.

425
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,302
It's too early to jump to conclusions.

426
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,428
Look at that wimpy stream.

427
00:25:08,719 --> 00:25:10,136
When will this huge fountain

428
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:12,010
be filled up again?

429
00:25:24,386 --> 00:25:26,094
Fill it up in the toilet, then drop it in.

430
00:25:26,469 --> 00:25:28,010
What? - You want me to do this too?

431
00:25:38,094 --> 00:25:39,760
Hurry. We're running out of time.

Be careful. Careful.

434
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,593
It's over there.

435
00:25:57,344 --> 00:25:58,302
Put her down carefully.

436
00:25:58,386 --> 00:25:59,510
Careful, your hands.

437
00:26:02,052 --> 00:26:02,885
My gosh.

438
00:26:06,469 --> 00:26:07,927
That's Min Seol A's house.

439
00:26:08,885 --> 00:26:10,010
Let's say she jumped from there.

440
00:26:11,094 --> 00:26:12,428
It won't do us any good

441
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:13,969
if her body is found too soon.

442
00:26:17,136 --> 00:26:18,261
Let's put her up there.

443
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:21,010
What? Up there?

444
00:26:21,261 --> 00:26:22,177
Yes.

445
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:23,719
Let's just put her here.

446
00:26:27,635 --> 00:26:29,344
Push me up. Almost there.

447
00:26:30,719 --> 00:26:32,428
You need to use your power.

448
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,885
Kyu Jin, you need to do this right.

449
00:26:37,094 --> 00:26:38,136
Darn it, come on.

450
00:26:48,885 --> 00:26:49,719
All done.

451
00:26:51,593 --> 00:26:52,510
The other shoe.

452
00:26:52,635 --> 00:26:53,552
What?

453
00:26:53,635 --> 00:26:54,510
Where's her other shoe?

454
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,428
Darn it.

455
00:26:56,927 --> 00:26:58,261
One of her shoe is gone.

456
00:26:59,719 --> 00:27:00,593
Darn it.

457
00:27:01,344 --> 00:27:02,719
Is her other shoe down there?

458
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,719
"Hera Palace"

459
00:27:11,719 --> 00:27:12,677
It's not here.

460
00:27:13,969 --> 00:27:14,969
It's not here either.

461
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,969
No, it's nowhere to be found.

462
00:27:21,052 --> 00:27:22,219
It's not in the fountain either.

463
00:27:22,969 --> 00:27:24,302
We can't lose more time.

464
00:27:25,094 --> 00:27:26,635
Let's do our best to wrap this up.

465
00:27:44,677 --> 00:27:46,719
Put her bag on the rooftop.

466
00:27:47,469 --> 00:27:48,927
So they will find her suicide note.

467
00:27:52,052 --> 00:27:53,010
Then

468
00:27:53,386 --> 00:27:54,302
are we all done?

469
00:27:54,386 --> 00:27:55,510
We have to do one more thing

470
00:27:56,094 --> 00:27:57,177
to complete her suicide note.

471
00:28:15,802 --> 00:28:17,219
Man, what's this mess?

472
00:28:18,593 --> 00:28:20,219
Gosh, look at this.

473
00:28:20,428 --> 00:28:22,386
What if there are bugs here?

474
00:28:23,469 --> 00:28:24,428
Gosh.

475
00:28:26,635 --> 00:28:28,010
Be quiet!

476
00:28:28,136 --> 00:28:29,302
This house is way too tiny.

477
00:28:29,386 --> 00:28:30,510
Try to be careful.

478
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:33,261
I mean,

479
00:28:33,719 --> 00:28:35,552
the government should redevelop

480
00:28:35,635 --> 00:28:36,844
houses like these.

481
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,469
Gosh, that darned dog.

482
00:28:44,344 --> 00:28:45,261
There's...

483
00:28:46,677 --> 00:28:47,635
something right here.

484
00:28:47,927 --> 00:28:48,802
What is it?

485
00:28:54,719 --> 00:28:55,593
It's dog poop.

486
00:28:56,261 --> 00:28:57,261
Darn it!

487
00:28:58,593 --> 00:28:59,552
Stop being so loud.

488
00:29:01,593 --> 00:29:02,719
What's that?

489
00:29:03,969 --> 00:29:05,635
Is... Is that an eye?

00:29:23,927 --> 00:29:24,885
We have...

493
00:29:26,177 --> 00:29:27,469
exactly 25 minutes left.

494
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:36,094
Since we haven't found her phone,

495
00:29:37,052 --> 00:29:38,010
this is probably for the best.

496
00:29:39,885 --> 00:29:41,261
And now, all the evidence

497
00:29:43,177 --> 00:29:44,719
will burn away.

498
00:29:57,344 --> 00:29:58,635
Mum. - No.

499
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,635
Mum!

500
00:30:06,969 --> 00:30:08,302
Are you all right, Ms Sim?

501
00:30:11,177 --> 00:30:12,177
What happened?

502
00:30:12,552 --> 00:30:14,302
You collapsed in the elevator.

503
00:30:14,719 --> 00:30:16,261
Do you not remember that?

504
00:30:21,261 --> 00:30:22,593
Did anything happen?

505
00:30:23,219 --> 00:30:24,052
No.

506
00:30:24,136 --> 00:30:25,802
The ceremony is still going smoothly.

507
00:30:35,428 --> 00:30:36,302
Ms Sim.

508
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:45,760
Ms Sim is heading downstairs.

Are you feeling better?

511
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,635
I heard you were ill.

512
00:31:29,386 --> 00:31:30,677
Did anything happen here?

513
00:31:31,677 --> 00:31:32,677
Like what?

514
00:31:33,261 --> 00:31:34,136
What is it?

515
00:31:34,219 --> 00:31:35,261
Should we expect to see something?

516
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:36,719
You should tell me about it.

517
00:31:43,719 --> 00:31:45,094
I heard you collapsed in the elevator.

518
00:31:45,552 --> 00:31:46,593
Ms Yang told me.

519
00:31:48,136 --> 00:31:49,552
You still don't look too well.

520
00:31:50,219 --> 00:31:51,261
You should get some rest after this.

521
00:31:51,927 --> 00:31:52,844
But I'm relieved you're fine.

522
00:31:52,969 --> 00:31:54,136
The lighting ceremony will begin soon.

523
00:32:03,552 --> 00:32:05,386
"Hera Palace"

524
00:32:13,219 --> 00:32:14,261
I'd like to thank you

525
00:32:14,885 --> 00:32:15,885
for coming out to celebrate

526
00:32:15,969 --> 00:32:16,885
the first-year anniversary

527
00:32:16,969 --> 00:32:18,177
of Hera Palace at such a late hour

528
00:32:18,386 --> 00:32:19,261
on behalf of all of our residents

529
00:32:19,344 --> 00:32:20,386
as a representative.

530
00:32:26,593 --> 00:32:27,510
I'd especially like to thank

531
00:32:27,677 --> 00:32:28,510
Mr Cho Sang Heon,

532
00:32:28,593 --> 00:32:29,885
the assemblyman of our district.

533
00:32:30,428 --> 00:32:31,302
Thank you.

534
00:32:37,344 --> 00:32:38,261
And now,

535
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:40,635
let us begin the lighting ceremony

536
00:32:40,719 --> 00:32:41,969
that will make this fountain perfect

537
00:32:42,302 --> 00:32:43,219
as Hera Palace's symbol.

538
00:32:44,094 --> 00:32:45,593
Keep your eyes on the statue of Hera,

539
00:32:45,927 --> 00:32:47,386
sculpted by a famous Italian artist.

540
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:53,927
Mr Cho?

541
00:33:01,927 --> 00:33:03,010
One second. - Sure.

542
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,719
I saw her

543
00:33:32,136 --> 00:33:33,552
fall down onto the fountain.

544
00:33:35,052 --> 00:33:36,344
Had I been dreaming?

545
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:41,177
Now, please hold up your glasses.

546
00:33:43,844 --> 00:33:44,677
For Hera, the goddess

547
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,677
of marriage and fidelity,

548
00:33:45,969 --> 00:33:48,010
and the glory and honour of Hera Palace.

549
00:33:48,219 --> 00:33:49,593
Cheers! - Cheers!

550
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,635
Great job. - My gosh.

551
00:33:53,094 --> 00:33:54,094
Cheers.

552
00:34:03,261 --> 00:34:05,677
This is a wonderful ceremony, Mr Joo.

553
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,927
It's unusually grandiose.

554
00:34:07,428 --> 00:34:08,885
I heard you shot up fireworks

555
00:34:08,969 --> 00:34:10,136
from Han River as well.

556
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:11,052
I did.

557
00:34:11,136 --> 00:34:12,510
It's all thanks to your help, Mr Cho.

558
00:34:12,802 --> 00:34:13,719
Thank you.

559
00:34:15,802 --> 00:34:17,302
She must be your wife.

560
00:34:17,885 --> 00:34:19,844
You're as beautiful as people say.

561
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:21,344
Honey?

562
00:34:21,428 --> 00:34:22,344
You should say hello to him.

563
00:34:33,052 --> 00:34:33,969
This man.

564
00:34:34,177 --> 00:34:35,719
This is Assemblyman Cho Sang Heon, right?

565
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:37,719
Why did he take a photo with Min Seol A?

566
00:34:42,593 --> 00:34:44,344
She's not feeling well today.

567
00:34:44,927 --> 00:34:45,885
Please understand.

568
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:47,510
I see.

569
00:34:50,927 --> 00:34:51,844
Honey.

570
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:53,052
Is this blood?

571
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:57,510
Oh, this is...

572
00:34:58,552 --> 00:35:01,010
I spilled some wine on him today.

573
00:35:01,177 --> 00:35:03,010
I stepped on my dress by accident.

574
00:35:03,677 --> 00:35:04,635
I'm sorry

575
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:05,719
I ruined your shirt.

576
00:35:06,386 --> 00:35:07,844
It's all right. Don't mind me.

577
00:35:08,052 --> 00:35:10,094
You were worried about your ruby ring.

578
00:35:10,677 --> 00:35:12,136
Look at how big that thing is.

579
00:35:12,219 --> 00:35:13,969
How much did that cost?

580
00:35:15,302 --> 00:35:17,802
You're way too dressed up today, Ms Cheon.

581
00:35:23,802 --> 00:35:24,802
Two, three.

582
00:35:27,177 --> 00:35:28,469
We look great.

583
00:35:31,386 --> 00:35:32,885
Gosh, we look awesome.

584
00:35:32,969 --> 00:35:33,844
"Are you okay?"

585
00:35:33,927 --> 00:35:34,802
"Please call me"

586
00:35:34,885 --> 00:35:35,760
"I have to tell you something"

587
00:35:36,844 --> 00:35:38,344
Where are you, Seol A?

588
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:40,635
Please send me a reply.

589
00:35:47,677 --> 00:35:49,469
What's going on? - Please step back.

590
00:35:49,969 --> 00:35:51,136
What's going on?

591
00:35:51,261 --> 00:35:52,969
Isn't that where the orphan girl lives?

592
00:35:53,052 --> 00:35:54,635
The girl who walks around at night. - Yes.

593
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,469
I heard she lives alone with her dog.

594
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:57,719
Why did she set her house on fire?

595
00:35:59,802 --> 00:36:01,677
The fire won't die down.

596
00:36:02,677 --> 00:36:03,844
My goodness. - Look at that.

597
00:36:03,927 --> 00:36:04,844
My gosh.

598
00:36:04,927 --> 00:36:05,802
What happened?

599
00:36:05,885 --> 00:36:07,177
Goodness, what's that? - What?

600
00:36:07,261 --> 00:36:08,677
There's a person! - Where?

601
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,844
My goodness! - What?

602
00:36:09,969 --> 00:36:11,219
Please step back.

603
00:36:27,344 --> 00:36:30,677
Is that training shoe behind Lady Hera

604
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,219
also from Italy?

605
00:36:32,428 --> 00:36:33,844
What do you mean?

606
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:35,510
What? - What's that?

607
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:36,677
What's he saying?

608
00:36:47,593 --> 00:36:49,510
I guess the kids pulled a prank.

609
00:36:51,052 --> 00:36:52,386
I wasn't seeing things.

610
00:36:52,927 --> 00:36:54,261
That was definitely Seol A.

611
00:36:55,927 --> 00:36:57,635
Hey! Who did this?

612
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:00,386
My gosh, you rascals.

613
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,927
Kids do that out of curiosity.

614
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:05,261
They're so adorable.

615
00:37:06,177 --> 00:37:07,010
All of you.

616
00:37:08,052 --> 00:37:09,844
What have you done to Seol A?

617
00:37:12,844 --> 00:37:13,969
What are you doing? Get that thing out.

618
00:37:19,219 --> 00:37:21,052
My gosh, these kids.

619
00:37:24,094 --> 00:37:25,510
A fire in Bosong Village?

620
00:37:28,593 --> 00:37:31,510
Okay, an orphan lives there alone.

621
00:37:31,635 --> 00:37:32,802
What do you expect me to do?

622
00:37:33,219 --> 00:37:34,261
I'm not a fireman.

623
00:37:54,219 --> 00:37:55,094
My goodness!

624
00:38:07,261 --> 00:38:08,510
We have breaking news.

625
00:38:08,885 --> 00:38:09,885
A fire broke out on the fifth floor

626
00:38:09,969 --> 00:38:10,969
in a building in Bosong Village.

627
00:38:11,052 --> 00:38:12,593
It took about 30 minutes

628
00:38:12,677 --> 00:38:14,760
for the firefighters to put it out.

629
00:38:15,136 --> 00:38:17,136
No one seemed to be inside the house

630
00:38:17,219 --> 00:38:18,428
when the fire broke out,

631
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:21,010
but about 100 residents had to evacuate

632
00:38:21,094 --> 00:38:22,719
because of the fire.

633
00:38:23,428 --> 00:38:24,719
The police and fire authorities

634
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:27,386
are investigating what caused the fire...

635
00:38:27,677 --> 00:38:28,593
Thick, grey smoke

636
00:38:28,677 --> 00:38:30,010
seeps through the windows.

637
00:38:30,428 --> 00:38:32,094
While working on putting out

638
00:38:32,177 --> 00:38:33,510
the fire on the fifth floor,

639
00:38:33,593 --> 00:38:34,719
the firefighters found

640
00:38:34,802 --> 00:38:36,136
a dead body on top of a gazebo,

641
00:38:36,219 --> 00:38:37,469
which has shocked the residents.

642
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:39,386
The victim is a teenage girl who was

643
00:38:39,469 --> 00:38:41,927
a resident of the apartment building.

644
00:38:42,136 --> 00:38:43,510
The police are combing through

645
00:38:43,552 --> 00:38:44,677
CCTV footage from the building

646
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,469
to determine if it was a homicide.

647
00:38:46,677 --> 00:38:49,136
Gosh, that poor thing.

648
00:38:49,219 --> 00:38:50,635
I feel so bad.

649
00:38:50,844 --> 00:38:52,802
My goodness, I can't believe this.

650
00:38:52,885 --> 00:38:54,802
Gosh, that poor thing.

651
00:38:54,885 --> 00:38:56,635
She's so young.

652
00:38:56,719 --> 00:38:58,177
Her parents are horrible

653
00:38:58,261 --> 00:38:59,969
for abandoning their young daughter.

654
00:39:00,094 --> 00:39:01,469
Terrible. - They're awful people.

655
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:03,844
She died? - My gosh.

656
00:39:05,094 --> 00:39:06,177
Seol A died?

657
00:39:10,136 --> 00:39:11,593
We found a suicide note on the roof.

658
00:39:12,052 --> 00:39:13,469
It looks like she died by suicide.

659
00:39:15,136 --> 00:39:17,386
"I shouldn't have been born"?

660
00:39:17,411 --> 00:39:19,911
Gosh, she must've been a spiteful kid.

661
00:39:20,386 --> 00:39:21,510
So she started a fire at her place

662
00:39:21,802 --> 00:39:23,010
and jumped from the roof?

663
00:39:23,302 --> 00:39:24,261
What about the missing shoe?

664
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:25,593
We haven't found it yet.

665
00:39:26,094 --> 00:39:27,219
No, that is nonsense.

666
00:39:27,344 --> 00:39:28,802
She'd never kill herself. - Ma'am, don't.

667
00:39:28,927 --> 00:39:29,969
"I shouldn't have been born."

668
00:39:30,052 --> 00:39:32,261
Gosh, what on earth are you doing?

669
00:39:32,344 --> 00:39:33,510
You can't just go ahead

670
00:39:33,552 --> 00:39:34,510
and touch evidence!

671
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,177
This is obstruction of justice.

672
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:37,760
I saw it with my own two eyes.

673
00:39:37,927 --> 00:39:38,969
That hand...

674
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:44,052
There is no way

675
00:39:44,136 --> 00:39:45,593
Seol A took her own life.

676
00:39:53,844 --> 00:39:56,302
No, wait! Please!

677
00:39:56,386 --> 00:39:58,219
Wait, please!

678
00:41:47,364 --> 00:41:49,738
Excuse me. Can you help me?

679
00:41:50,597 --> 00:41:52,014
Help me untie this.

680
00:41:53,635 --> 00:41:54,844
I have to go.

681
00:41:55,344 --> 00:41:56,593
Excuse me.

682
00:41:56,844 --> 00:41:58,136
Can't you hear me?

683
00:42:05,552 --> 00:42:06,510
Mr Yoon?

684
00:42:08,927 --> 00:42:10,010
What are you doing here?

685
00:42:11,802 --> 00:42:12,927
Don't get so worked up.

686
00:42:13,802 --> 00:42:14,969
It won't do you any good.

687
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,844
You were told that you'd all die

688
00:42:17,219 --> 00:42:18,719
if you did anything reckless.

689
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:21,969
If you want to find your daughter,

690
00:42:22,302 --> 00:42:23,428
you must do as I say.

691
00:42:24,094 --> 00:42:25,469
If you do anything reckless,

692
00:42:25,927 --> 00:42:27,302
Joo Hye In and your daughter

693
00:42:27,386 --> 00:42:28,469
will both die.

694
00:42:29,386 --> 00:42:30,428
That was you?

695
00:42:32,635 --> 00:42:33,927
Are you the one who called me?

696
00:42:36,635 --> 00:42:37,635
Answer my question!

697
00:42:39,428 --> 00:42:40,844
Are you the one who told me that Hye In

698
00:42:40,927 --> 00:42:41,760
isn't my real daughter?

699
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:44,635
Why?

700
00:42:46,261 --> 00:42:47,469
Why did you tell me?

701
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:52,219
If Chairman Joo finds out,

702
00:42:52,969 --> 00:42:54,344
you'll be put in danger.

703
00:42:54,927 --> 00:42:56,177
I don't care.

704
00:42:57,219 --> 00:42:58,552
My daughter is dead.

705
00:42:58,635 --> 00:42:59,969
What's the use of staying alive?

706
00:43:04,052 --> 00:43:05,469
My daughter...

707
00:43:08,219 --> 00:43:09,885
My daughter is dead.

708
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:17,719
You've helped Dan Tae

709
00:43:18,136 --> 00:43:20,510
do all sorts of evil things, so why?

710
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:23,344
Do you suddenly feel guilty?

711
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:27,719
This won't undo your sins!

712
00:43:39,094 --> 00:43:40,261
You're right.

713
00:43:41,635 --> 00:43:43,136
I work for Chairman Joo,

714
00:43:43,219 --> 00:43:44,469
so I must do as he says.

715
00:43:45,552 --> 00:43:47,052
Since my life is in his hands,

716
00:43:48,302 --> 00:43:49,760
I will continue to obey his orders

717
00:43:49,844 --> 00:43:50,677
until the day I die.

718
00:43:50,802 --> 00:43:52,510
Then why are you doing this to me?

719
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:55,094
What do you want from me?

720
00:43:57,428 --> 00:43:58,469
I may be his hound

721
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,136
and a piece of rubbish,

722
00:44:01,719 --> 00:44:03,719
but I figured you deserve to know

723
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,927
what really happened 17 years ago.

724
00:44:09,177 --> 00:44:11,219
She was born at 32 weeks,

725
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:13,052
but all her organs including her heart

726
00:44:13,136 --> 00:44:14,469
are perfectly normal.

727
00:44:14,635 --> 00:44:16,219
She's truly blessed.

728
00:44:16,677 --> 00:44:17,927
Everything's normal?

729
00:44:20,927 --> 00:44:22,010
Living things can be

730
00:44:22,094 --> 00:44:23,510
very persistent, can't they?

731
00:44:25,593 --> 00:44:28,052
That baby was also born at 32 weeks,

732
00:44:28,469 --> 00:44:30,386
but her condition is getting worse.

733
00:44:30,635 --> 00:44:31,885
The mother is a single mum,

734
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:33,510
so she doesn't know what to do.

735
00:44:34,386 --> 00:44:36,386
She can't afford the hefty hospital bill.

736
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,802
This is a good thing for your baby.

737
00:44:43,052 --> 00:44:44,469
So don't cry, okay?

738
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:46,386
You made the right choice.

739
00:44:46,677 --> 00:44:48,302
Trust me. You did the right thing.

740
00:44:49,664 --> 00:44:51,248
"Mother: Sim Soo Ryeon"

741
00:44:57,469 --> 00:44:58,635
"Mother: Kim Jung Bin"

742
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:04,677
He switched the newborn babies

743
00:45:04,844 --> 00:45:06,510
in the neonatal unit.

744
00:45:06,593 --> 00:45:07,552
"Mother: Sim Soo Ryeon"

745
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:11,302
But I couldn't kill that baby

746
00:45:11,844 --> 00:45:12,927
because I felt like it was

747
00:45:12,952 --> 00:45:14,203
desperately struggling to live.

748
00:45:15,635 --> 00:45:16,844
So I left the baby

749
00:45:16,869 --> 00:45:18,661
in front of the children's home.

750
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,386
I, too, had no idea

751
00:45:24,219 --> 00:45:25,386
that Min Seol A was that baby.

752
00:45:25,844 --> 00:45:28,552
No! Stop!

753
00:45:40,261 --> 00:45:41,719
I'll give you a tranquillizer.

754
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:43,635
Get some sleep.

755
00:45:46,927 --> 00:45:49,428
No, don't leave. Get this off me.

756
00:45:50,094 --> 00:45:51,510
How could you call yourself human?

757
00:45:51,969 --> 00:45:53,593
Mr Yoon!

758
00:45:56,469 --> 00:45:58,136
Mr Yoon!

759
00:46:25,802 --> 00:46:28,635
"Always be healthy, Sugar!"

760
00:46:36,969 --> 00:46:40,052
"Let's be happy together for many years."

761
00:46:41,927 --> 00:46:44,177
Joo Dan Tae.

762
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,261
I will kill you.

763
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:53,089
I will kill you with my own two hands.

764
00:46:53,821 --> 00:46:55,446
I will kill you!

765
00:47:11,802 --> 00:47:13,010
Just like the suicide note says,

766
00:47:13,386 --> 00:47:14,386
I made the necessary arrangements

767
00:47:14,469 --> 00:47:16,010
to make sure the media will conclude it

768
00:47:16,802 --> 00:47:18,010
as a depressed girl setting her place

769
00:47:18,094 --> 00:47:19,760
on fire and taking her own life.

770
00:47:19,927 --> 00:47:21,052
"Hera Club Chat Room"

771
00:47:21,136 --> 00:47:22,719
Gosh, that darn dog.

772
00:47:23,219 --> 00:47:25,469
No! Don't come near me!

773
00:47:25,635 --> 00:47:26,969
Woof, woof! Go away!

774
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:28,469
Gosh! - It's okay.

775
00:47:29,469 --> 00:47:30,802
Even if her last location

776
00:47:30,885 --> 00:47:32,386
shows up as Hera Palace,

777
00:47:32,927 --> 00:47:34,469
they won't find any evidence

778
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:36,094
that directly connects us to her.

779
00:47:36,969 --> 00:47:38,344
So we have nothing to worry about.

780
00:47:38,969 --> 00:47:39,969
That girl is just a loser

781
00:47:40,386 --> 00:47:42,552
who acted up and ended up killing herself.

782
00:47:44,593 --> 00:47:45,635
Do you think that girl

783
00:47:46,261 --> 00:47:47,593
really took her own life?

784
00:47:51,344 --> 00:47:53,094
Do you think someone killed her?

785
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,593
I don't trust Joo Dan Tae.

786
00:47:57,010 --> 00:47:59,302
Do you trust him?

787
00:47:59,977 --> 00:48:00,977
That jerk?

788
00:48:01,186 --> 00:48:02,227
Gosh.

789
00:48:02,643 --> 00:48:05,019
Look how he even forged her suicide note.

790
00:48:05,977 --> 00:48:08,269
I have to say, you creeped me out earlier.

791
00:48:08,769 --> 00:48:10,060
Did you really have to do that?

792
00:48:10,144 --> 00:48:11,852
As if you're that psycho's loyal dog?

793
00:48:15,552 --> 00:48:17,344
I don't care whether or not

794
00:48:17,369 --> 00:48:18,593
she took her own life.

795
00:48:19,177 --> 00:48:21,677
I did it for Eun Byeol, and you know that.

796
00:48:23,469 --> 00:48:25,510
I don't even want to hear that name again.

797
00:48:39,677 --> 00:48:41,510
Hey, did you see this? Look.

798
00:48:41,927 --> 00:48:43,136
This is Min Seol A, right?

799
00:48:43,469 --> 00:48:44,927
"The arsonist was a middle school girl

800
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:46,760
suffering from depression."

801
00:48:47,219 --> 00:48:48,177
They found a suicide note

802
00:48:48,261 --> 00:48:49,177
blaming the world.

803
00:48:49,386 --> 00:48:51,302
"I want you all dead"?

804
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,052
Gosh, I can't believe this girl.

805
00:48:54,136 --> 00:48:55,261
Talk about being resentful.

806
00:48:55,344 --> 00:48:56,302
How creepy.

807
00:48:56,386 --> 00:48:58,386
Well, then our incident

808
00:48:58,469 --> 00:49:00,428
will be buried naturally.

809
00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:01,719
Right?

810
00:49:02,094 --> 00:49:03,593
Of course.

811
00:49:04,219 --> 00:49:06,386
Who would mourn the death

812
00:49:07,261 --> 00:49:08,510
of a sociopath like her?

813
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:10,677
Shut it!

814
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:12,635
Stop talking about that dead girl.

815
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:22,386
She has nothing to do with us now,

816
00:49:22,593 --> 00:49:24,386
so let's just plan our trip.

817
00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:26,302
You've been so on edge since yesterday.

818
00:49:29,136 --> 00:49:30,136
Did you kill her?

819
00:49:30,261 --> 00:49:31,344
Min Seol A.

820
00:49:32,802 --> 00:49:33,760
What?

821
00:49:35,802 --> 00:49:36,719
No, why would I?

822
00:49:36,802 --> 00:49:38,927
Gosh. Then why are you overreacting?

823
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:40,719
Of course you didn't kill her. That girl

824
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:42,760
took her own life.

825
00:49:42,844 --> 00:49:44,635
Darn, this is ruining my day.

826
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:46,219
Let's stop talking about that swindler.

827
00:49:47,177 --> 00:49:48,677
We'll soon have to deal with a bomb

828
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:49,677
that's worse than her.

829
00:49:50,136 --> 00:49:51,302
What do you mean?

830
00:49:51,969 --> 00:49:53,635
The girl who's taking Seol A's spot.

831
00:49:53,927 --> 00:49:56,386
She's dumb and obnoxious. I hate her.

832
00:49:57,635 --> 00:49:59,510
Why do you hate her so much?

833
00:50:00,219 --> 00:50:01,177
Are you jealous?

834
00:50:01,386 --> 00:50:03,010
Gosh, are you crazy?

835
00:50:03,177 --> 00:50:04,885
Why would I be jealous of her?

836
00:50:05,635 --> 00:50:06,885
You'll know what I mean.

837
00:50:06,969 --> 00:50:08,510
She has nothing, but she's so arrogant.

838
00:50:09,052 --> 00:50:10,510
I hate her more than Seol A.

839
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,177
The wishy-washy ones are more annoying.

840
00:50:13,469 --> 00:50:15,261
Really? I look forward to meeting her.

841
00:50:17,969 --> 00:50:19,219
Right, Seok Hoon?

842
00:50:28,469 --> 00:50:29,510
Gosh.

843
00:50:43,094 --> 00:50:44,386
Hello?

844
00:50:44,885 --> 00:50:46,510
What? Where are you calling from?

845
00:50:48,552 --> 00:50:50,927
Cheonga Arts High School? Okay.

846
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,010
What...

847
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:58,510
What did you just say?

848
00:50:59,635 --> 00:51:01,593
We have an extra slot for Bae Ro Na

849
00:51:01,677 --> 00:51:03,302
in the vocal music department.

850
00:51:04,802 --> 00:51:06,552
An extra slot?

851
00:51:07,593 --> 00:51:08,760
But why...

852
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:10,302
I mean, how?

853
00:51:11,177 --> 00:51:12,428
One of the kids

854
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:14,344
who got accepted died yesterday.

855
00:51:58,510 --> 00:52:00,593
No-- No way.

856
00:52:00,677 --> 00:52:02,719
Did I do it?

857
00:52:10,052 --> 00:52:11,802
"Hera Palace"

858
00:52:14,844 --> 00:52:17,510
"Hera Palace"

859
00:52:20,969 --> 00:52:23,177
Hey! Kids!

860
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:27,719
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

861
00:52:27,802 --> 00:52:29,760
What are you doing, lady?

862
00:52:30,177 --> 00:52:31,927
Gosh, why are you back here?

863
00:52:32,261 --> 00:52:33,552
You're really annoying.

864
00:52:34,428 --> 00:52:36,094
It's pretty impressive.

865
00:52:36,552 --> 00:52:37,510
How could a girl die

866
00:52:37,552 --> 00:52:38,885
as if it was all planned out?

867
00:52:39,552 --> 00:52:41,510
Ro Na is unbelievably lucky.

868
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:43,052
Thank goodness

869
00:52:43,677 --> 00:52:45,261
you girls are okay.

870
00:52:47,386 --> 00:52:48,760
What the heck are you talking about?

871
00:52:49,428 --> 00:52:50,428
You heard, right?

872
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:51,635
Min Seol A is dead.

873
00:52:54,844 --> 00:52:55,760
Min Seol A?

874
00:52:55,844 --> 00:52:58,593
The one who got in with the highest score?

875
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:01,052
How did she die?

876
00:53:01,844 --> 00:53:03,802
Maybe you killed her,

877
00:53:03,885 --> 00:53:05,510
and you're just playing dumb now.

878
00:53:05,552 --> 00:53:06,552
They're saying it was a suicide,

879
00:53:06,635 --> 00:53:08,052
but I find it very hard to believe.

880
00:53:09,969 --> 00:53:11,302
You really didn't do it?

881
00:53:12,927 --> 00:53:14,094
If it wasn't you...

882
00:53:15,094 --> 00:53:16,719
My gosh! Did Ro Na do it?

883
00:53:19,344 --> 00:53:20,177
You'd better not say

884
00:53:20,261 --> 00:53:21,510
anything like that about Ro Na!

885
00:53:21,844 --> 00:53:23,302
I will teach you a lesson.

886
00:53:23,386 --> 00:53:25,344
Have you lost your mind?

887
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:26,510
Gosh!

888
00:53:26,802 --> 00:53:28,177
What is this?

889
00:53:29,719 --> 00:53:32,510
Ms Oh, there's blood on your hand.

890
00:53:39,677 --> 00:53:41,552
Did you really do something last night?

891
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:43,302
Enough, Je Ni.

892
00:53:43,719 --> 00:53:45,302
Let's go. Everyone's waiting.

893
00:53:46,177 --> 00:53:47,219
This is an expensive dress.

894
00:53:47,386 --> 00:53:48,760
I'm so upset!

895
00:53:51,552 --> 00:53:53,552
What-- What is this?

896
00:53:54,428 --> 00:53:57,635
No way. Did I really...

897
00:53:58,302 --> 00:54:00,219
No, no way. That can't be.

898
00:54:01,552 --> 00:54:04,052
Why don't I remember anything?

899
00:54:14,469 --> 00:54:16,344
Hi, Ro Na.

900
00:54:17,052 --> 00:54:18,719
Mum, I've been accepted

901
00:54:18,844 --> 00:54:21,386
to Cheonga Arts High School!

902
00:54:26,469 --> 00:54:27,677
Yes!

903
00:54:30,052 --> 00:54:32,844
Hey, I got in!

904
00:54:40,052 --> 00:54:42,302
I've been thinking hard,

905
00:54:42,386 --> 00:54:43,593
but that girl...

906
00:54:44,469 --> 00:54:46,136
She had no reason to kill herself.

907
00:54:46,719 --> 00:54:48,344
She got in as the top student,

908
00:54:48,428 --> 00:54:49,510
so she would've gotten a scholarship.

909
00:54:49,593 --> 00:54:52,010
She had a bright future ahead of her.

910
00:54:52,510 --> 00:54:53,677
Why would she take her own life?

911
00:54:53,969 --> 00:54:55,052
Then are you saying

912
00:54:55,719 --> 00:54:57,261
one of us killed her?

913
00:54:57,635 --> 00:54:59,344
Who would do something like that?

914
00:54:59,428 --> 00:55:00,593
That is insane.

915
00:55:00,844 --> 00:55:03,802
Who knows?

916
00:55:07,593 --> 00:55:11,136
I know you stepped out last night.

917
00:55:11,469 --> 00:55:12,927
You seemed to be in a rush.

918
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:14,177
Dr Ha!

919
00:55:16,469 --> 00:55:18,177
Are you suspecting me?

920
00:55:19,386 --> 00:55:21,802
I went to the loo!

921
00:55:21,885 --> 00:55:23,969
For that long?

922
00:55:24,428 --> 00:55:25,428
What?

923
00:55:25,552 --> 00:55:26,635
That reminds me.

924
00:55:27,177 --> 00:55:29,552
Didn't you also step out, Ma Ri?

925
00:55:29,635 --> 00:55:30,927
Goodness.

926
00:55:31,593 --> 00:55:32,635
I went outside

927
00:55:32,802 --> 00:55:34,010
to throw up because I was too drunk.

928
00:55:34,094 --> 00:55:35,469
I can't believe this.

929
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,094
Right, Attorney Lee.

930
00:55:37,552 --> 00:55:39,177
Who did you talk on the phone with

931
00:55:39,261 --> 00:55:40,261
for so long?

932
00:55:40,386 --> 00:55:43,094
It seemed like an intimate call. - Yes.

933
00:55:43,219 --> 00:55:45,177
What are you talking about?

934
00:55:45,261 --> 00:55:46,428
That was my mum.

935
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:48,719
What? Do you want to see my call history?

936
00:55:49,052 --> 00:55:52,094
I talk with my mum every hour.

937
00:55:52,177 --> 00:55:53,219
Right? - That's right.

938
00:55:53,302 --> 00:55:54,552
What are you all doing?

939
00:55:54,969 --> 00:55:56,219
Show us! - Are you provoking us?

940
00:55:56,510 --> 00:55:57,844
Let me see. - What are you doing?

941
00:55:57,927 --> 00:55:59,969
Show me! - How dare you suspect me!

942
00:56:00,052 --> 00:56:01,593
Hey! - Let me see your phone.

943
00:56:01,677 --> 00:56:02,719
What's your problem? - Stop it!

944
00:56:02,802 --> 00:56:04,552
Show me now! - What's with that attitude?

945
00:56:04,844 --> 00:56:06,010
Gosh! - My goodness.

946
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:13,552
The cops

947
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:15,760
will arrive at Hera Palace shortly.

948
00:56:16,469 --> 00:56:17,469
Min Seol A

949
00:56:18,386 --> 00:56:19,552
took her own life.

950
00:56:20,219 --> 00:56:22,177
What we say is the truth.

951
00:56:33,302 --> 00:56:34,593
Min Seol A's phone records

952
00:56:34,802 --> 00:56:36,510
show that you two spoke quite often.

953
00:56:36,927 --> 00:56:38,760
She was my kids' math tutor.

954
00:56:38,969 --> 00:56:41,094
She died in Bosong Village,

955
00:56:41,844 --> 00:56:43,302
but her phone was last pinged

956
00:56:43,386 --> 00:56:44,593
at Hera Palace.

957
00:56:44,844 --> 00:56:46,136
Why do you think that is?

958
00:56:46,593 --> 00:56:47,844
How would I know?

959
00:56:48,677 --> 00:56:51,089
Isn't it your job to find that out?

960
00:56:51,114 --> 00:56:52,277
Turns out,

961
00:56:52,302 --> 00:56:54,344
everything was a lie.

962
00:56:54,552 --> 00:56:57,177
She told us she went to UCLA

963
00:56:57,261 --> 00:56:59,552
and that her name was Anna.

964
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,177
So you must've been angry with her.

965
00:57:01,677 --> 00:57:03,261
Because she totally deceived you.

966
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:06,010
Why would people like us

967
00:57:06,094 --> 00:57:07,885
let that bother us?

968
00:57:08,136 --> 00:57:09,444
We have a ton of other things

969
00:57:09,469 --> 00:57:10,386
to worry about.

970
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:13,374
She was just like a fruit fly.

971
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:16,361
Sure, she was annoying.

972
00:57:16,386 --> 00:57:17,498
But that was it.

973
00:57:17,523 --> 00:57:18,647
So we just let her be.

974
00:57:18,969 --> 00:57:20,302
Was she accepted to Cheonga Arts High

975
00:57:20,386 --> 00:57:21,428
with the highest score?

976
00:57:21,802 --> 00:57:22,760
Is it true?

977
00:57:22,844 --> 00:57:23,844
Yes.

978
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:25,428
I was very surprised,

979
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:26,760
but I still congratulated her.

980
00:57:27,052 --> 00:57:28,219
Are you sure?

981
00:57:29,094 --> 00:57:30,677
Rumour has it that you tried

982
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:31,760
to get her admission cancelled.

983
00:57:31,844 --> 00:57:33,344
That is a groundless rumour.

984
00:57:33,844 --> 00:57:34,844
Had I wanted to do that,

985
00:57:34,927 --> 00:57:36,094
it would've been done a long time ago.

986
00:57:36,635 --> 00:57:38,302
I sincerely congratulated her

987
00:57:38,386 --> 00:57:39,593
on being accepted.

988
00:57:39,969 --> 00:57:41,094
I just feel bad

989
00:57:41,510 --> 00:57:42,969
that I couldn't protect her

990
00:57:43,052 --> 00:57:44,344
as an adult.

991
00:57:46,302 --> 00:57:47,344
Mr Joo.

992
00:57:47,469 --> 00:57:49,386
You talked to Min Seol A on the phone

993
00:57:49,469 --> 00:57:50,719
the day before she died.

994
00:57:50,885 --> 00:57:52,219
Did you meet her that day?

995
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:53,677
I called and asked her to stop by,

996
00:57:53,927 --> 00:57:55,094
but she didn't show up.

997
00:57:55,177 --> 00:57:56,261
I'm upset that

998
00:57:56,344 --> 00:57:57,469
she deliberately lied to us,

999
00:57:57,510 --> 00:57:58,885
but it's very unfortunate

1000
00:57:59,428 --> 00:58:00,510
that she took her own life.

1001
00:58:00,719 --> 00:58:02,802
Your wife, Ms Sim,

1002
00:58:02,969 --> 00:58:04,552
kept calling her too.

1003
00:58:05,635 --> 00:58:06,760
My wife?

1004
00:58:10,844 --> 00:58:12,010
There was

1005
00:58:12,593 --> 00:58:13,510
a misunderstanding

1006
00:58:13,552 --> 00:58:14,760
between her and our kids,

1007
00:58:14,844 --> 00:58:15,719
so my wife was probably

1008
00:58:15,802 --> 00:58:16,885
trying to get that sorted out.

1009
00:58:17,428 --> 00:58:19,927
She's a very tender-hearted person.

1010
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:09,677
Are you ready to talk now?

1011
00:59:10,261 --> 00:59:11,510
Where is your phone?

1012
00:59:13,593 --> 00:59:14,885
If you want to go home,

1013
00:59:14,969 --> 00:59:16,844
you'd better tell me now.

1014
00:59:17,344 --> 00:59:19,469
Are you doing this because of the video

1015
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:20,677
of you cheating?

1016
00:59:23,010 --> 00:59:24,386
It's awfully lame

1017
00:59:25,302 --> 00:59:26,344
that you're being this pathetic

1018
00:59:26,428 --> 00:59:27,344
just because of that.

1019
00:59:29,802 --> 00:59:32,344
Hey, who do you think you are?

1020
00:59:34,136 --> 00:59:35,927
I already know enough about you.

1021
00:59:36,927 --> 00:59:38,219
Your adoptive parents abandoned you,

1022
00:59:38,302 --> 00:59:40,136
and you got deported from the US.

1023
00:59:41,052 --> 00:59:42,386
The reason for deportation

1024
00:59:43,177 --> 00:59:44,677
was also theft, I heard.

1025
00:59:45,261 --> 00:59:46,969
No, I never stole anything.

1026
00:59:47,635 --> 00:59:49,927
I was framed by people like you.

1027
00:59:50,177 --> 00:59:52,719
Who would believe an orphan like you?

1028
00:59:53,927 --> 00:59:55,052
Just tell me already.

1029
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,094
Where is your phone?

1030
00:59:57,593 --> 00:59:58,677
What can you possibly do

1031
00:59:58,760 --> 00:59:59,969
by keeping your mouth shut?

1032
01:00:00,302 --> 01:00:01,510
Who knows?

1033
01:00:03,177 --> 01:00:04,927
I may know much more

1034
01:00:05,177 --> 01:00:06,927
than you think.

1035
01:00:08,802 --> 01:00:10,593
What could you possibly know?

1036
01:00:10,885 --> 01:00:12,302
The admission process was rigged.

1037
01:00:13,428 --> 01:00:14,969
I know all about it.

1038
01:00:23,302 --> 01:00:24,261
You'd better stop

1039
01:00:24,344 --> 01:00:25,802
before I lose my patience.

1040
01:00:26,261 --> 01:00:27,302
You obviously feel guilty.

1041
01:00:28,261 --> 01:00:29,552
Your daughter, Ha Eun Byeol.

1042
01:00:30,177 --> 01:00:32,094
Was she accepted fairly?

1043
01:00:32,677 --> 01:00:33,760
Are you sure she didn't

1044
01:00:33,844 --> 01:00:35,052
steal someone else's spot?

1045
01:00:35,344 --> 01:00:37,219
Did you think no one would know?

1046
01:00:38,428 --> 01:00:40,261
Shut your mouth before I kill you.

1047
01:00:49,052 --> 01:00:53,844
Die! Die! Just die!

1048
01:01:07,469 --> 01:01:08,552
Meet me at the penthouse

1049
01:01:08,844 --> 01:01:09,844
at 9.

01:01:16,885 --> 01:01:17,927
I just finished interviewing

01:01:18,010 --> 01:01:19,302
all the residents at Hera Palace.

1055
01:01:19,593 --> 01:01:20,760
Should we do an autopsy, sir?

1056
01:01:20,969 --> 01:01:22,844
Hey, are you out of your mind?

1057
01:01:23,428 --> 01:01:25,261
You know how many cases we already have.

1058
01:01:25,677 --> 01:01:26,635
Why waste time on an orphan

1059
01:01:26,719 --> 01:01:27,635
who killed herself?

1060
01:01:30,302 --> 01:01:31,510
Conclude it as suicide

1061
01:01:31,593 --> 01:01:32,593
and process it as an unclaimed body

1062
01:01:32,719 --> 01:01:33,552
with no family.

1063
01:01:34,052 --> 01:01:35,635

She's being cremated now.

1074
01:02:48,635 --> 01:02:49,802
Okay.

1075
01:03:08,635 --> 01:03:09,802
The immediate cause of death

1076
01:03:09,927 --> 01:03:11,428
was the damage to her brain

1077
01:03:12,094 --> 01:03:13,136
as well as to her cervical spine

1078
01:03:13,219 --> 01:03:14,094
due to the fall.

1079
01:03:20,386 --> 01:03:21,927
There's something unusual though.

1080
01:03:22,302 --> 01:03:23,428
I found this

1081
01:03:23,844 --> 01:03:25,510
inside her body.

1082
01:03:32,010 --> 01:03:33,136
What is this?

1083
01:03:33,428 --> 01:03:34,635
Looks like she swallowed it

1084
01:03:35,136 --> 01:03:36,552
minutes before her death.

1085
01:03:55,635 --> 01:03:56,927
Seol A.

1086
01:03:58,052 --> 01:03:59,802
Mum is so sorry.

1087
01:04:02,885 --> 01:04:04,593
For coming for you too late

1088
01:04:05,177 --> 01:04:07,428
and for not recognising you.

1089
01:04:09,927 --> 01:04:12,428
I'm so sorry for leaving you all alone.

1090
01:04:18,010 --> 01:04:19,261
This is all my fault.

1091
01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:21,344
It's all my fault.

1092
01:04:21,969 --> 01:04:23,635
I was too foolish.

1093
01:04:25,136 --> 01:04:27,219
I'm a fool.

1094
01:04:36,428 --> 01:04:37,719
Seol A.

1095
01:04:38,261 --> 01:04:42,052
Who did this to you?

1096
01:04:42,136 --> 01:04:43,094
Tell me.

1097
01:04:44,052 --> 01:04:47,469
I'll find out who did this to you

1098
01:04:47,927 --> 01:04:51,052
and tear that person to shreds.

1099
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:54,844
Seol A...

1100
01:05:10,094 --> 01:05:11,386
Hey!

1101
01:05:12,010 --> 01:05:13,302
Hey. - What?

1102
01:05:13,386 --> 01:05:14,593
It's gone.

1103
01:05:14,677 --> 01:05:15,760
What's gone?

1104
01:05:16,052 --> 01:05:18,386
I can't find it. It's gone.

1105
01:05:19,469 --> 01:05:20,760
What are you talking about?

1106
01:05:21,052 --> 01:05:23,635
My antique pocket watch.

1107
01:05:25,885 --> 01:05:27,386
What? You idiot!

1108
01:05:27,526 --> 01:05:28,485
Gosh.

1109
01:05:28,510 --> 01:05:29,819
You're unbelievable.

1110
01:05:30,184 --> 01:05:32,017
Hey! Lee Kyu Jin!

1111
01:05:32,094 --> 01:05:33,152
What is wrong with you?

1112
01:05:33,177 --> 01:05:34,649
What will you do now?

1113
01:05:34,674 --> 01:05:36,316
That hurts! - Lee Kyu Jin!

1114
01:05:36,341 --> 01:05:38,090
You're unbelievable! - That hurts!

1115
01:05:45,927 --> 01:05:47,469
Why did you want to meet at your place?

1116
01:05:48,469 --> 01:05:49,510
Don't worry.

1117
01:05:50,177 --> 01:05:51,344
The kids are away on a trip,

1118
01:05:51,677 --> 01:05:52,969
and I gave the housekeepers a day off.

1119
01:05:54,510 --> 01:05:56,677
My wife won't be coming home tonight.

1120
01:05:57,010 --> 01:05:58,177
So it's just you and me.

1121
01:05:58,593 --> 01:05:59,635
Just the two of us.

1122
01:06:01,769 --> 01:06:03,182
Still, this is your place,

1123
01:06:05,186 --> 01:06:06,525
and I don't feel comfortable here.

1124
01:06:07,144 --> 01:06:08,977
We finally got rid of that headache,

1125
01:06:09,269 --> 01:06:11,269
so we should enjoy some wine.

1126
01:06:11,810 --> 01:06:12,935
We'll have a small party.

1127
01:06:13,602 --> 01:06:15,685
But we haven't found Seol A's phone yet.

1128
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:17,560
There's a video of us on that phone.

1129
01:06:18,769 --> 01:06:20,019
I keep getting a bad feeling.

1130
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:22,560
Why? There's nothing to worry about.

1131
01:06:22,727 --> 01:06:24,436
The police closed the case as suicide,

1132
01:06:24,602 --> 01:06:27,311
and she's already been cremated.

1133
01:06:28,352 --> 01:06:29,394
Are you serious?

1134
01:06:30,394 --> 01:06:31,852
She's already been cremated?

1135
01:06:31,935 --> 01:06:33,019
Yes, of course.

1136
01:06:33,269 --> 01:06:34,977
I have influence over everything.

1137
01:06:35,935 --> 01:06:38,560
But I do feel a little bad for her.

1138
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:40,102
Had she stayed clueless,

1139
01:06:40,186 --> 01:06:41,394
she wouldn't have died.

1140
01:06:41,977 --> 01:06:44,144
But then again,

1141
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:46,810
she's probably better off dead anyway.

1142
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:49,560
How dare she record a video of us

1143
01:06:49,585 --> 01:06:50,852
and use it to blackmail us.

1144
01:06:51,478 --> 01:06:52,478
She basically

1145
01:06:52,769 --> 01:06:54,311
brought it upon herself.

1146
01:06:55,186 --> 01:06:57,227
Let's forget about it and celebrate.

1147
01:06:57,694 --> 01:06:59,111
Here's to our good luck.

1148
01:06:59,352 --> 01:07:00,436
Cheers.

1150
01:08:28,969 --> 01:08:30,552
I will not forgive anyone

1151
01:08:30,635 --> 01:08:32,885
who tries to shake up Hera Palace.

1152
01:08:32,969 --> 01:08:34,261
That means there's a witness.

1153
01:08:34,344 --> 01:08:35,760
I saw Dr Ha.

1154
01:08:35,844 --> 01:08:38,136
Did Dr Ha do something to her?

1155
01:08:38,227 --> 01:08:39,827
Are you hiding something from me?

1156
01:08:39,852 --> 01:08:41,370
It'll be our secret.

1157
01:08:41,395 --> 01:08:42,152
You got that?

1158
01:08:42,177 --> 01:08:44,231
We'll be punished for what we did to her.

1159
01:08:44,256 --> 01:08:45,494
I will not forgive

1160
01:08:45,519 --> 01:08:46,635
those who did this to you.

1161
01:08:46,660 --> 01:08:48,993
Maybe your mum pushed Seol A.

1162
01:08:49,018 --> 01:08:50,934
Why are you all doing this?

1163
01:08:50,959 --> 01:08:52,468
There's no way I killed her.

1164
01:08:52,493 --> 01:08:54,399
The day Seol A died at Hera Palace...

1165
01:08:54,424 --> 01:08:55,652
Where were you?

1166
01:08:55,677 --> 01:08:58,136
Do you not remember?
