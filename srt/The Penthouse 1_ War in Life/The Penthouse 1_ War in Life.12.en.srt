Right.

did you just say?

13
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,267
You have another daughter.

Look at yourself!

25
00:01:57,942 --> 00:01:59,543
I'm not at fault here.

26
00:01:59,567 --> 00:02:01,626
Eun Byeol started this.

27
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,335
She tried to stab me with her hairpin.

28
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:06,600
I'll report her for school violence.

29
00:02:09,151 --> 00:02:10,294
Did anyone see her do that?

30
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:11,210
What?

31
00:02:11,234 --> 00:02:14,043
Is there evidence to support your claim?

32
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:15,043
If there's no witness,

33
00:02:15,067 --> 00:02:16,418
you might well be lying.

34
00:02:16,442 --> 00:02:18,876
You've always been jealous of her.

35
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,726
And right now...

36
00:02:20,942 --> 00:02:22,291
Look.

37
00:02:22,734 --> 00:02:25,434
Anyone can see that you're the attacker.

38
00:02:26,442 --> 00:02:28,876
Seeing the way you react

39
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,376
just helped me understand

40
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,835
how frustrated, lonely, and pressured

41
00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:33,626
my mum must have felt

42
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,376
25 years ago.

43
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,376
If you were someone who could admit

44
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,168
to what you did and apologise,

45
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:41,726
your daughter would've been more decent!

46
00:02:43,026 --> 00:02:43,960
What did you say?

47
00:02:43,984 --> 00:02:45,252
How dare you talk like that to her.

48
00:02:45,276 --> 00:02:47,225
Don't look at her like that!

49
00:02:47,692 --> 00:02:49,252
You'd better watch your language.

50
00:02:49,276 --> 00:02:51,600
I'm the Head of Arts in this school.

51
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,252
You should remember

52
00:02:53,276 --> 00:02:55,684
that I can suspend you

53
00:02:56,026 --> 00:02:58,183
over what happened today.

54
00:02:58,775 --> 00:03:00,392
Let's go, Eun Byeol.

55
00:03:04,734 --> 00:03:06,376
Don't run away. Tell me.

56
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,100
Who are you?

57
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:10,002
How do you know Seol A?

58
00:03:10,026 --> 00:03:11,002
No,

59
00:03:11,026 --> 00:03:13,475
how did you find out she's my daughter?

60
00:03:14,567 --> 00:03:15,626
How dare you touch me

61
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,585
with your dirty hands, lady.

62
00:03:17,609 --> 00:03:19,626
And what makes you so confident?

63
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,376
Can the whole world find out about her?

64
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,168
Then why did you hide it to this day?

65
00:03:24,192 --> 00:03:26,434
I don't care who you are.

66
00:03:26,525 --> 00:03:29,100
But don't meddle with my business.

67
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:32,100
If you say a word about Seol A,

68
00:03:32,151 --> 00:03:33,543
I won't let it go.

69
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:35,267
Then what?

70
00:03:35,775 --> 00:03:37,876
Is that how you got rid of everyone

71
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,726
who figured out the truth?

72
00:03:39,859 --> 00:03:41,501
People like Cho Sang Heon

73
00:03:41,525 --> 00:03:43,183
and Director Min?

74
00:03:44,109 --> 00:03:45,459
Don't dream

75
00:03:45,483 --> 00:03:47,668
for a second that I'll let you kill me

76
00:03:47,692 --> 00:03:49,960
like those idiots.

77
00:03:49,984 --> 00:03:52,183
But I will give you a chance.

78
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,767
A chance to share the truth yourself.

79
00:03:56,817 --> 00:03:59,851
Tell them Min Seol A is your daughter.

80

To your dearly beloved husband and kids.

81

This is none of your business.

82

She's my daughter,

83
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,267

84
00:04:11,734 --> 00:04:13,392
Very interesting.

00:04:14,817 --> 00:04:17,350
your happy family to fall apart?

87
00:04:18,109 --> 00:04:19,335
Will this

88
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,559
make me qualified to meddle with it?

You have to find her.

Why do you want to find her that badly?

93
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,418
She abandoned you.

94

she's living a miserable life like me.

she's living a miserable life like me.

she's living a miserable life like me.

Do you get it now?

Do you understand how much she hated you?

105
00:05:03,567 --> 00:05:04,797
She was...

106
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,434
looking for me?

107
00:05:11,234 --> 00:05:13,851
She was dying to find you!

108
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,668
She had no idea the mum that abandoned her

109
00:05:19,692 --> 00:05:20,585
was around all along.

110

111
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:24,018
for you!

112
00:05:25,567 --> 00:05:28,475
You couldn't even recognise your daughter.

113
00:05:28,692 --> 00:05:30,809
You don't deserve to be her mum.

114

I'm going to make her last wish come true.

That should give you enough time to think.

If you don't,

00:11:42,609 --> 00:11:44,392
No!

175
00:11:47,942 --> 00:11:49,934
She'd never...

176
00:11:50,817 --> 00:11:53,267
She'd never kill herself.

177
00:12:07,234 --> 00:12:10,309
Mr Gu hit Seok Hoon? Why?

178
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:12,418
He got his revenge on Eun Hoo

179
00:12:12,442 --> 00:12:14,059
because Seok Hoon hit him.

180
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:16,043
Who does he think he is?

181
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:18,043
He already took my bribe.

182
00:12:18,067 --> 00:12:20,252
He's really weird.

183
00:12:20,276 --> 00:12:21,501
He keeps making us run laps

184
00:12:21,525 --> 00:12:22,793
and gives us penalty points.

185
00:12:22,817 --> 00:12:25,392
He's especially harsh on Seok Hoon.

186
00:12:26,026 --> 00:12:28,309
It's as if he holds a grudge.

187
00:12:28,859 --> 00:12:30,294
Please fire him right away.

188
00:12:30,318 --> 00:12:31,976
He makes me feel icky.

189
00:12:32,067 --> 00:12:33,684
I'll take care of this.

190
00:12:46,192 --> 00:12:47,793
It's me, Mr Gu.

191
00:12:47,817 --> 00:12:50,350
Can you spare some time right now?

192
00:12:57,638 --> 00:12:59,236
"Life begins at 2 outs at the 9th inning"

193
00:12:59,261 --> 00:13:01,458
My gosh.

194
00:13:04,067 --> 00:13:05,668
Do you like baseball?

195
00:13:05,692 --> 00:13:06,835
I was going to work out a little

196
00:13:06,859 --> 00:13:08,392
with this friend of mine.

197
00:13:08,525 --> 00:13:09,793
I thought it'd be fun to play together.

198
00:13:09,817 --> 00:13:11,376
Baseball?

199
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,876
Gosh, look at these bats.

200
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,543
I can already see how good you are.

201
00:13:15,567 --> 00:13:17,096
"We only speak with our talent"

202
00:13:17,121 --> 00:13:18,652
Goodness.

203
00:13:19,234 --> 00:13:22,085
You're obviously the youngest, Mr Gu.

204
00:13:22,109 --> 00:13:23,002
You got the upper hand.

205
00:13:23,026 --> 00:13:24,085
You're a PE teacher,

206
00:13:24,109 --> 00:13:26,585
so I'm sure you're very athletic.

207
00:13:26,609 --> 00:13:27,960
You'll get three pitches.

208
00:13:27,984 --> 00:13:31,168
Whoever hits the most bases wins.

209
00:13:31,192 --> 00:13:33,085
Are we playing for something?

210
00:13:33,109 --> 00:13:35,127
The winner gets a wish.

211
00:13:35,151 --> 00:13:36,085
What do you think?

212
00:13:36,109 --> 00:13:37,376
I want a blank cheque.

213
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,376
I'm not sure.

214
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,043
I'm not a guy who enjoys

215
00:13:40,067 --> 00:13:42,267
playing ball games.

216
00:13:42,814 --> 00:13:44,556
Who's the pitcher?

217
00:13:48,192 --> 00:13:50,018
Who is that?

218
00:13:50,192 --> 00:13:52,876
BK! That's Kim Byung Hyun.

219
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:56,376
He's close friends with Chairman Joo.

220
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,751
He's that legendary pitcher.

221
00:13:58,775 --> 00:14:00,252
It's that Kim Byung Hyun!

222
00:14:00,276 --> 00:14:03,600
Goodness, Byung Hyun. Nice to meet you.

223
00:14:06,214 --> 00:14:07,713
"Gu Ho Dong, Joo Dan Tae, Lee Kyu Jin"

224
00:14:11,878 --> 00:14:12,939
"Gu Ho Dong, Joo Dan Tae, Lee Kyu Jin"

225
00:14:12,964 --> 00:14:15,251
"Gu Ho Dong versus Joo Dan Tae"

226
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:23,267
He's your friend. Go easy on him.

227
00:14:26,595 --> 00:14:28,565
"Gu Ho Dong versus Joo Dan Tae"

228
00:14:31,109 --> 00:14:33,142
Great job!

229
00:14:36,483 --> 00:14:38,317
"Gu Ho Dong versus Joo Dan Tae"

230
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,267
My goodness.

231
00:14:58,385 --> 00:15:00,329
"Gu Ho Dong: One fail"

232
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,127
My goodness. Watch out.

233
00:15:04,151 --> 00:15:06,809
Mr Gu, you'd be out if you do that!

234
00:15:24,961 --> 00:15:26,207
"Gu Ho Dong versus Joo Dan Tae"

235
00:15:27,128 --> 00:15:29,355
"Gu Ho Dong: Two fails"

236
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,084
"Joo Dan Tae: One fail, two hits"

237
00:15:31,109 --> 00:15:32,726
What was that?

238
00:15:36,067 --> 00:15:38,168
Home run! That's a home run!

239
00:15:38,192 --> 00:15:40,002
"Gu Ho Dong: Home run"

240
00:15:40,026 --> 00:15:41,663
All right!

241
00:15:44,367 --> 00:15:45,025
"Gu Ho Dong: Home run"

242
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:48,154
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

243
00:15:48,179 --> 00:15:49,543
I won.

244
00:15:49,567 --> 00:15:51,585
Mr Gu, did you just fool us?

245
00:15:51,609 --> 00:15:53,835
You're as good as a baseball player.

246
00:15:53,859 --> 00:15:55,043
It was really weird.

247
00:15:55,067 --> 00:15:57,851
The ball looked oddly huge today.

248
00:15:58,067 --> 00:15:59,835
Chairman Joo, that was disappointing.

249
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:01,626
Is that all you can do?

250
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:03,043
Forget it.

251
00:16:03,067 --> 00:16:04,892
Tell me what your wish is.

252
00:16:11,567 --> 00:16:13,294
I just texted it to you.

253
00:16:13,318 --> 00:16:14,892
And to you too.

254
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,835
"Camera 08"

255
00:16:20,859 --> 00:16:22,585
Hey, this is...

256
00:16:22,609 --> 00:16:25,127
What are you trying to do?

257
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:26,918
You said you deleted everything.

258
00:16:26,942 --> 00:16:27,960
I lied.

259
00:16:27,984 --> 00:16:28,876
You lied?

260
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,835
My wish is

261
00:16:29,859 --> 00:16:32,726
for the world to see this video.

262
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,751
How dare you take my money

263
00:16:34,775 --> 00:16:36,418
then try to avoid doing your part.

264
00:16:36,442 --> 00:16:37,376
Money?

265
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,100
What money?

266
00:16:39,442 --> 00:16:42,335
Are you talking about the golden turtles?

267
00:16:42,359 --> 00:16:45,793
I left those on your sofa that day.

268
00:16:45,817 --> 00:16:47,892
I guess you haven't seen them yet.

269
00:16:49,567 --> 00:16:52,043
How dare you try to pull this prank on me.

270
00:16:52,067 --> 00:16:53,918
My gosh, Dan Tae.

271
00:16:53,942 --> 00:16:55,710
You have an awful temper.

272
00:16:55,734 --> 00:16:58,100
Don't call me that. I'm not your friend.

273
00:16:58,234 --> 00:16:59,501
Anyway,

274
00:16:59,525 --> 00:17:00,918
a bet is a bet.

275
00:17:00,942 --> 00:17:03,100
You have to keep your promise.

276
00:17:03,775 --> 00:17:05,668
I have an early class.

277
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:07,350
Please excuse me.

278
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:08,626
That little... - Hey, you.

279
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,684
You! Stop right there!

280
00:17:10,817 --> 00:17:12,252
Are you sure

281
00:17:12,276 --> 00:17:14,434
he's just a teacher?

282
00:17:14,525 --> 00:17:16,501
He's a total nutcase.

283
00:17:16,525 --> 00:17:18,726
That cheeky jerk.

284
00:17:18,817 --> 00:17:21,018
I should've nipped him in the bud.

285
00:17:21,567 --> 00:17:23,684
Darn it, that jerk.

286
00:17:46,026 --> 00:17:47,626
Honey, how do I look?

287
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,392
Do I look beautiful?

288
00:17:51,109 --> 00:17:52,835
Don't look at me like that.

289
00:17:52,859 --> 00:17:54,543
You're making me embarrassed.

290
00:17:54,567 --> 00:17:56,183
Again?

291
00:18:00,234 --> 00:18:03,559
Your moustache hurts me, Dan Tae.

292
00:18:04,775 --> 00:18:08,095
Honey, stop it.

293
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:08,780
"Anticipated Profit and Loss"

294
00:18:08,805 --> 00:18:11,043
This one isn't too risky,

295
00:18:11,067 --> 00:18:13,294
but it won't guarantee a big profit.

296
00:18:13,318 --> 00:18:14,668
Think of it

297
00:18:14,692 --> 00:18:16,350
as a savings account.

298
00:18:16,442 --> 00:18:18,210
I don't have any income right now,

299
00:18:18,234 --> 00:18:20,418
so I'd like to make some profit.

300
00:18:20,442 --> 00:18:22,418
Have you heard of the phrase

301
00:18:22,442 --> 00:18:24,059
"high risk, high return"?

302
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:32,002
This is an item that only insiders know.

303
00:18:32,026 --> 00:18:33,684
If things go well,

304
00:18:33,859 --> 00:18:36,350
it'll be a huge success very soon.

305
00:18:36,734 --> 00:18:38,392
A huge success?

306
00:18:39,567 --> 00:18:41,002
It's a company called Dr BioGen.

307
00:18:41,026 --> 00:18:42,418
It is the first Korean company

308
00:18:42,442 --> 00:18:43,585
that developed gene therapy

309
00:18:43,609 --> 00:18:44,710
for respiratory illnesses.

310
00:18:44,734 --> 00:18:46,213
Take a look.

311
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,335
You have an audition tomorrow.

312
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,642
Why aren't you practising right now?

313
00:19:00,234 --> 00:19:01,793
Mum.

314
00:19:01,817 --> 00:19:04,626
What if Ro Na does better than me?

315
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:07,543
She has good pronunciation,

316
00:19:07,567 --> 00:19:09,294
she's pretty,

317
00:19:09,318 --> 00:19:11,934
and she doesn't get very nervous.

318
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,918
I get scared when I'm in front of a crowd,

319
00:19:14,942 --> 00:19:17,168
feeling as if my heart will blow up.

320
00:19:17,192 --> 00:19:19,851
Is that why you did that to Ro Na?

321
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,684
You attacked her with a hairpin.

322
00:19:24,692 --> 00:19:26,376
It could've gone so much worse.

323
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,851
She keeps getting on my nerves!

324
00:19:32,067 --> 00:19:34,726
I can't live another day with her!

325
00:19:34,942 --> 00:19:36,835
I hate how she lives here,

326
00:19:36,859 --> 00:19:39,976
and I hate how we go to the same school!

327
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:44,294
You saw her talking back to you today.

328
00:19:44,318 --> 00:19:47,851
I want her to disappear for good!

329
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,838
You can't become the best singer

330
00:19:51,863 --> 00:19:53,334
with a weak mind like yours!

331
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,835
You have to be bold in front of thousands

332
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,668
to sing in opera houses in Europe.

333
00:19:57,692 --> 00:20:00,274
Is this the best you can do as my girl?

334
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,458
I'm scared.

335
00:20:02,483 --> 00:20:04,002
What if I mess up tomorrow

336
00:20:04,026 --> 00:20:06,085
before the judges?

337
00:20:06,109 --> 00:20:09,183
I heard they were all famous announcers.

338
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:12,726
I really don't want to lose against Ro Na.

339
00:20:17,609 --> 00:20:18,875
Take a look.

340
00:20:19,609 --> 00:20:21,392
What is this?

341
00:20:23,318 --> 00:20:25,183
The audition script.

342
00:20:26,067 --> 00:20:28,100
Where did you get this?

If the script wasn't leaked out,

Who could have possibly leaked it out?

shouldn't we change the script

to have a fair audition?

If you can't do this,

you can give up on the audition alone.

No.

It looks like

563
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:56,960
you should change the audition script

685
00:35:00,483 --> 00:35:02,459
I thought it was you, Ma Ri.

686
00:35:02,483 --> 00:35:04,100
No?

687
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,876
Why would I ever take your side?

688
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,127
When you hate someone, they grow on you.

689
00:35:09,151 --> 00:35:10,835
I thought you kind of liked me.

690
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:12,517
Didn't you?

691
00:35:12,609 --> 00:35:14,002
Our kids knew each other

692
00:35:14,026 --> 00:35:15,376
since middle school,

693
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,918
and we live across the hall now.

694
00:35:16,942 --> 00:35:18,376
Let's be friends, Ma Ri.

695
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,059
Goodness.

696
00:35:20,276 --> 00:35:21,210
Do you always do that

697
00:35:21,234 --> 00:35:23,059
to get people on your side?

698
00:35:23,859 --> 00:35:25,376
Getting a bit clingy.

699
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,558
Honey.

700
00:35:29,276 --> 00:35:32,042
She's here to celebrate with our kids.

701
00:35:32,067 --> 00:35:33,668
It's all right.

702
00:35:33,692 --> 00:35:36,960
I don't get clingy with everyone I see.

703
00:35:36,984 --> 00:35:39,418
I don't do that to just anybody.

704
00:35:39,442 --> 00:35:40,376
What did you say?

705
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,187
That was a bit rude on your part.

706
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,043
What he said wasn't very courteous

707
00:35:45,067 --> 00:35:46,726
or funny.

708
00:35:47,483 --> 00:35:48,876
My gosh.

709
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,626
What happened to Eun Byeol?

710
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:52,168
I heard she collapsed.

711
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:56,793
I'm sure Ms Cheon is devastated.

712
00:35:56,817 --> 00:35:57,751
People are suspicious

713
00:35:57,775 --> 00:35:58,751
that she rigged the audition,

714
00:35:58,775 --> 00:36:00,835
Eun Byeol didn't make the cut,

715
00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:02,127
and Dr Ha

716
00:36:02,151 --> 00:36:04,100
packed up and left...

717
00:36:04,359 --> 00:36:05,543
Packed up?

718
00:36:05,567 --> 00:36:07,543
Dr Ha did that? Why?

719
00:36:07,567 --> 00:36:09,376
What's going on?

720
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,876
Honey, you should tell them.

721
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:11,835
My gosh.

722
00:36:11,859 --> 00:36:13,976
Why did you say that?

723
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,793
There is

724
00:36:15,817 --> 00:36:17,294
a lot of drama with that family.

725
00:36:17,318 --> 00:36:19,018
How can I put this?

726
00:36:19,276 --> 00:36:20,793
Roses.

727
00:36:20,817 --> 00:36:22,501
Thorns. It hurts.

728
00:36:22,525 --> 00:36:23,585
Then tears.

729
00:36:23,609 --> 00:36:25,210
Me, feeling like they'll be my clients.

730
00:36:25,234 --> 00:36:27,059
And Dr Ha!

731
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:38,600
Where's Eun Byeol?

732
00:36:39,734 --> 00:36:40,751
She's asleep.

733
00:36:40,775 --> 00:36:42,392
You can see her later.

734
00:37:30,221 --> 00:37:32,334
Eun Byeol, lie down on your back...

735
00:37:33,151 --> 00:37:34,127
Stop laughing!

736
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:35,668
Stop laughing at me!

737
00:37:35,692 --> 00:37:37,294
Eun Byeol, what's wrong?

738
00:37:37,318 --> 00:37:39,751
This sound. Their laughter.

739
00:37:39,775 --> 00:37:41,294
They're all laughing at me!

740
00:37:41,318 --> 00:37:44,100
Be quiet! You need to stop!

741
00:37:44,483 --> 00:37:46,252
Eun Byeol, pull yourself together.

742
00:37:46,276 --> 00:37:47,668
I don't hear anything right now.

743
00:37:47,692 --> 00:37:48,876
Eun Byeol, look at me.

744
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,809
Hey, Eun Byeol!

745
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,501
Dad.

746
00:38:00,525 --> 00:38:01,918
When did you get here?

747
00:38:01,942 --> 00:38:03,767
Is your conference over?

748
00:38:04,192 --> 00:38:06,043
Eun Byeol, are you okay?

749
00:38:06,067 --> 00:38:07,002
Why?

750
00:38:07,026 --> 00:38:09,100
I'm totally fine.

751
00:38:09,567 --> 00:38:10,543
Dad.

752
00:38:10,567 --> 00:38:13,085
I couldn't be the ambassador. Sorry.

753
00:38:13,109 --> 00:38:14,210
But don't worry.

754
00:38:14,234 --> 00:38:16,168
I'll be the best student for the midterm.

755
00:38:16,192 --> 00:38:18,335
And I'll win the trophy at the festival.

756
00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:20,434
Then you won't hate me, will you?

757
00:38:20,984 --> 00:38:23,376
Why would I ever hate you?

758
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,252
You don't have to be the first place.

759
00:38:25,276 --> 00:38:27,684
No, I don't want that. I won't have it.

760
00:38:29,234 --> 00:38:31,976
It's great to have you here, Dad.

761
00:38:35,192 --> 00:38:36,127
Eun Byeol.

762
00:38:36,151 --> 00:38:38,517
If you're up, you need to start studying.

763
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:41,043
You have to do well on the midterm

764
00:38:41,067 --> 00:38:42,376
to make up for your mistake this time.

765
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,661
Okay.

766
00:38:46,984 --> 00:38:48,085
I set up everything for you,

767
00:38:48,109 --> 00:38:49,459
yet you manage to ruin that?

768
00:38:49,483 --> 00:38:50,751
You shouldn't have let anyone find out!

769
00:38:50,775 --> 00:38:51,918
Why did you let her find out

770
00:38:51,942 --> 00:38:53,127
and make me look this ridiculous?

771
00:38:53,151 --> 00:38:54,085
Stop it.

772
00:38:54,109 --> 00:38:55,252
She's obviously ill right now.

773
00:38:55,276 --> 00:38:56,168
How can you say that to her

774
00:38:56,192 --> 00:38:57,335
after seeing her condition?

775
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:58,668
How can she survive

776
00:38:58,692 --> 00:39:00,876
in this harsh world without a strong mind?

777
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,043
Eun Byeol.

778
00:39:02,067 --> 00:39:03,668
You have to get some rest. Don't do it.

779
00:39:03,692 --> 00:39:05,376
No, I have to study.

780
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,376
I can't become the first place

781
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,376
if I rest like everyone else.

782
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,142
I'm fine, Dad.

783
00:39:20,192 --> 00:39:21,418
Are you out of your mind?

784
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,043
She's ill right now!

785
00:39:23,067 --> 00:39:24,294
She also said something weird

786
00:39:24,318 --> 00:39:25,335
in her sleep.

787
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:26,626
She ruined her audition.

788
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:28,294
She can't make any excuses.

789
00:39:28,318 --> 00:39:29,876
Do you know how humiliated I was

790
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,376
before other parents?

791
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,876
She damaged her grandpa's reputation,

792
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,043
so the least she can do

793
00:39:34,067 --> 00:39:34,960
is do well on her midterms.

794
00:39:34,984 --> 00:39:37,517
Who cares about that darned test?

795
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:39,918
Do you ever

796
00:39:39,942 --> 00:39:42,142
actually worry about Eun Byeol?

797
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:48,543
It's not something you should say

798
00:39:48,567 --> 00:39:50,559
when you abandoned her and left.

799
00:39:51,276 --> 00:39:52,710
I won't let Eun Byeol

800
00:39:52,734 --> 00:39:55,684
grow up as a loser like you.

801
00:39:55,859 --> 00:39:58,018
So don't mess with her education.

802
00:39:58,859 --> 00:40:00,517
How...

803
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:02,851
did you end up becoming like this?

804
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:06,976
No.

805
00:40:07,109 --> 00:40:10,059
You've always been like this, Seo Jin.

806
00:40:10,817 --> 00:40:12,459
Stop acting like you are

807
00:40:12,483 --> 00:40:13,918
a dignified man of conscience.

808
00:40:13,942 --> 00:40:16,183
Don't be such a hypocrite.

809
00:40:16,525 --> 00:40:17,793
The moment you left Yoon Hee

810
00:40:17,817 --> 00:40:19,876
and chose to be with me,

811
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,252
you've always been

812
00:40:21,276 --> 00:40:23,475
much more covetous than me.

813
00:40:24,734 --> 00:40:26,376
I don't care

814
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,809
if you treat me like an idiot or whatever.

815
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,210
But...

816
00:40:31,234 --> 00:40:33,642
I can't let you ruin Eun Byeol.

817
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:47,585
So you're back now?

818
00:40:47,609 --> 00:40:49,934
You made the right choice.

819
00:40:49,984 --> 00:40:51,168
If you want a divorce,

820
00:40:51,192 --> 00:40:52,960
you should gather solid evidence first.

821
00:40:52,984 --> 00:40:55,100
Then you can stab her in the back.

822
00:40:55,817 --> 00:40:57,434
You're enjoying this.

823
00:40:57,825 --> 00:41:00,218
Gosh, Dr Ha.

824
00:41:00,242 --> 00:41:02,509
You're a wreck.

825
00:41:02,533 --> 00:41:03,593
Oh, dear.

826
00:41:03,617 --> 00:41:05,260
About the medical malpractice lawsuit,

827
00:41:05,284 --> 00:41:06,801
I think it'll go well.

828
00:41:06,825 --> 00:41:08,468
Your wife...

829
00:41:08,492 --> 00:41:10,968
I mean, Seo Jin.

830
00:41:10,992 --> 00:41:12,135
She met the patient's family

831
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:13,718
and got it all sorted out.

832
00:41:13,742 --> 00:41:16,150
Dr Ha is lucky to have her.

833
00:41:21,034 --> 00:41:22,520
My gosh.

834
00:41:24,326 --> 00:41:25,551
What's the matter with you?

835
00:41:25,575 --> 00:41:28,442
You're scaring me. What's wrong?

836
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:30,426
We should watch what we say

837
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:32,509
in front of a man holding a knife.

838
00:41:32,533 --> 00:41:35,150
What's wrong with what I said?

839
00:41:36,617 --> 00:41:37,551
I complimented his wife.

840
00:41:37,575 --> 00:41:39,275
Shouldn't that make him happy?

841
00:41:40,117 --> 00:41:41,593
Why is it taking so long

842
00:41:41,617 --> 00:41:43,843
to settle the Myeong-dong deal?

843
00:41:43,867 --> 00:41:45,676
If it's beyond your ability,

844
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:48,068
just tell us now.

845
00:41:50,201 --> 00:41:52,942
Dr Ha, you keep crossing the line.

846
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:55,509
It's awful to see Hera Club falling apart.

847
00:41:55,533 --> 00:41:58,593
I'm meeting Logan Lee this afternoon.

848
00:41:58,617 --> 00:42:00,260
Since you brought it up,

849
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:01,218
I want to let you know

850
00:42:01,242 --> 00:42:02,635
that I'll be leaving Hera Club as soon as

851
00:42:02,659 --> 00:42:05,026
the Myeong-dong deal is sorted out.

852
00:42:05,909 --> 00:42:08,052
I asked to meet up today to tell you this.

853
00:42:08,076 --> 00:42:09,551
So do what you do best

854
00:42:09,575 --> 00:42:11,817
and get it done already.

855
00:42:13,825 --> 00:42:14,658
Hey.

856
00:42:15,117 --> 00:42:16,052
That brazen punk.

857
00:42:16,076 --> 00:42:17,593
How dare he act up like that.

858
00:42:17,617 --> 00:42:19,942
Gosh, calm down.

859
00:42:20,034 --> 00:42:21,135
He's like a sensitive boy

860
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,426
with teenage angst these days.

861
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:23,969
Is that my fault?

862
00:42:23,994 --> 00:42:25,503
Why take his anger out on me?

863
00:42:25,528 --> 00:42:26,996
I can't believe this.

864
00:42:27,021 --> 00:42:28,401
Hey, come on.

865
00:42:28,426 --> 00:42:30,594
Let's finish our food-- - Get lost.

866
00:42:31,326 --> 00:42:33,782
Why throw a tantrum at me?

867
00:42:34,034 --> 00:42:36,567
Also, it is your fault.

868
00:42:36,825 --> 00:42:38,218
Gosh, that jerk.

869
00:42:38,242 --> 00:42:41,218
His brazenness is beyond me.

870
00:42:41,242 --> 00:42:43,344
Should I just-- My gosh.

871
00:42:43,368 --> 00:42:46,279
Should I just expose everything? Should I?

872

873

00:43:00,909 --> 00:43:03,984
Go tell your family the truth.

876
00:43:07,284 --> 00:43:09,635
A family photo is missing. Did you see it?

877
00:43:09,659 --> 00:43:10,593
No.

878
00:43:10,617 --> 00:43:11,760
Tell Ms Yang to find it.

879
00:43:11,784 --> 00:43:13,302
It's one of my favourite photos.

880
00:43:13,326 --> 00:43:15,150
Will do.

881
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:35,233
Only eight more days.

882
00:43:35,742 --> 00:43:37,551
I don't have time.

883
00:43:37,575 --> 00:43:39,609
I must move fast.

884
00:43:49,659 --> 00:43:51,164
Dr BioGen? Do you mean

885
00:43:51,189 --> 00:43:53,138
the respiratory illness treatment?

886
00:43:55,201 --> 00:43:58,218
Only we know about this.

887
00:43:58,242 --> 00:44:00,260
It'll be a huge success.

888
00:44:00,284 --> 00:44:02,317
Dr BioGen.

889
00:44:04,659 --> 00:44:06,010
If it's awaiting FDA approval,

890
00:44:06,034 --> 00:44:07,901
I should move fast.

891
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:09,218
This information is from you,

892
00:44:09,242 --> 00:44:10,968
so I have no doubt at all, sir.

893
00:44:10,992 --> 00:44:12,426
I'll buy some right away as well.

894
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:14,275
Yes, thank you.

896
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:26,290
This is it, Dr BioGen.

897
00:44:30,409 --> 00:44:32,442
I want to withdraw the entire balance.

898
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:36,760
With the money from my savings account

899
00:44:36,784 --> 00:44:38,344
and a mortgage loan,

900
00:44:38,368 --> 00:44:41,010
I can gather about a billion won.

901
00:44:41,034 --> 00:44:42,468
That's all I have.

902

You're making a smart choice.

I'll buy you a nice meal later on.

904

He's staying at this hotel?

905
00:44:57,159 --> 00:44:59,635
This is a six-star luxury hotel.

906
00:44:59,659 --> 00:45:00,760
That's right.

907
00:45:00,784 --> 00:45:02,426
On top of that, he's staying at a suite

908
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:05,359
that costs millions of won a night.

909

But his fellow teachers

910
00:45:07,742 --> 00:45:09,901
call him a cheapskate.

911
00:45:10,117 --> 00:45:12,344
Is he extorting money from someone?

912
00:45:12,368 --> 00:45:14,135
Didn't he grow up in the children's home?

913
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:15,260
No.

914
00:45:15,284 --> 00:45:16,468
There was no one named Gu Ho Dong

915
00:45:16,492 --> 00:45:18,567

Please dig deeper.

917
00:45:20,368 --> 00:45:22,525
Gu Ho Dong may not be his real name.

918
00:45:25,284 --> 00:45:27,010
Find out as soon as possible.

Hi, guys.

How have you been?

926
00:45:48,285 --> 00:45:49,120
What?

Seok Kyung, what is it?

929
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:55,192
Is something wrong?

930
00:45:56,076 --> 00:45:57,901
No, it's nothing.

931
00:46:02,742 --> 00:46:03,968
What is this message?

932
00:46:03,992 --> 00:46:05,593
Did Min Seol A really send it?

933
00:46:05,617 --> 00:46:07,509
No way. It's obviously a prank.

934
00:46:07,533 --> 00:46:08,718
Who would pull a prank like this,

935
00:46:08,742 --> 00:46:10,650
impersonating a dead person?

936
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:11,718
This creeps me out.

937
00:46:11,742 --> 00:46:12,676
I keep getting invited back

938
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,177
into the chat room.

939
00:46:14,201 --> 00:46:15,718

Look over here.

942
00:46:26,368 --> 00:46:27,930
I'll make you look pretty.

943
00:46:27,955 --> 00:46:30,533
Nice posture and great face.

944
00:46:30,558 --> 00:46:32,118
This is the true face

945
00:46:32,143 --> 00:46:34,045
of Bosong Village's Min Seol A.

946
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:35,954
This suits you so well!

947
00:46:35,979 --> 00:46:37,871
How about changing careers?

948
00:46:37,896 --> 00:46:39,248
You're a joke! - Stop this!

949
00:46:39,273 --> 00:46:41,258
How dare you act like our tutor.

950
00:46:41,283 --> 00:46:44,392
Let me out! - Turn it off! Now!

951
00:46:44,417 --> 00:46:47,322
Didn't we delete this file?

952
00:46:47,347 --> 00:46:48,592
Who in this world...

953
00:46:48,617 --> 00:46:50,177
The phone.

954
00:46:50,201 --> 00:46:52,135
Seol A probably recorded it on her phone.

955
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,926
Then is she really alive?

956
00:46:53,950 --> 00:46:55,260
Seol A isn't dead?

957
00:46:55,284 --> 00:46:57,468
Don't be absurd. She's dead.

958
00:46:57,492 --> 00:46:59,468
She took her own life. Remember?

959
00:46:59,492 --> 00:47:00,551
Someone who found her phone

960
00:47:00,575 --> 00:47:02,192
is pulling a prank on us.

Don't let this confuse you.

962
00:47:04,034 --> 00:47:05,338
Leave the chat room at once

963
00:47:05,363 --> 00:47:06,718
and block her ID.

964
00:47:06,742 --> 00:47:07,801
And don't tell anyone,

965
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,609
especially your parents.

966
00:47:12,286 --> 00:47:14,069
Hey, what's wrong?

967
00:47:16,201 --> 00:47:18,635
You acted strange that time as well.

968
00:47:18,659 --> 00:47:21,150
You must know something about Seol A.

969
00:47:22,402 --> 00:47:25,254
No way. Did you kill Seol A?

970
00:47:25,279 --> 00:47:28,395
No! I don't know anything!

976

at Hera Palace.

978
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:57,260
She didn't die in Bosong Village.

Are you really the same age as us?

Yes, I'm okay.

Don't lie to me. I heard everything.

Are they the students you're tutoring?

I won't let them get away with this.

How could they do this to you?

So stay still.

1014
00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:53,177
I told you not to tutor those kids.

1015
00:49:53,201 --> 00:49:54,551
I offered to send you money.

1016

Why didn't you listen to me?

1024
00:50:25,533 --> 00:50:28,259
I'm glad I helped you regain your health.

1025
00:50:28,284 --> 00:50:30,150
It makes me so happy.

1026
00:50:30,742 --> 00:50:32,280
I'm coming for you.

1027
00:50:32,305 --> 00:50:33,530
Okay?

1028
00:50:33,617 --> 00:50:35,484
I'll go there

1029
00:50:35,992 --> 00:50:38,068
and teach those kids a lesson.

1030
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:41,109
So stay still, okay? I'm coming over.

1031
00:50:43,896 --> 00:50:46,115
I hope you really do teach them a lesson.

1032
00:50:46,769 --> 00:50:48,594
Keep that promise, okay?

1033
00:50:56,533 --> 00:50:59,525
I will make your lives miserable.

1034
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:01,984
Brace yourselves.

1035
00:51:08,284 --> 00:51:09,635
It's time.

1036
00:51:09,659 --> 00:51:11,426
Let's make sure we sign the deal today.

1037
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:13,150
Yes, sir.

1038
00:51:17,659 --> 00:51:20,734
Negotiations are temporarily suspended.

1039
00:51:22,450 --> 00:51:24,052
Are you not getting things done properly?

1040
00:51:24,076 --> 00:51:25,885
Why won't he show up?

1041
00:51:25,909 --> 00:51:27,635
Did you send him a proper proposal?

1042
00:51:27,659 --> 00:51:28,718
Yes, sir.

1043
00:51:28,742 --> 00:51:29,843
We sent him a perfect proposal

1044
00:51:29,867 --> 00:51:31,010
that lays out the investment plan

1045
00:51:31,034 --> 00:51:32,010
and future expectations.

1046
00:51:32,034 --> 00:51:33,509
If it was perfect,

1047
00:51:33,533 --> 00:51:36,484
Logan Lee should be here now.

1048
00:51:36,784 --> 00:51:38,218
Mr Kang.

1049
00:51:38,242 --> 00:51:41,359
Looks like you're no longer useful to me.

1050
00:51:42,242 --> 00:51:43,302
Please give me one more chance.

1051
00:51:43,326 --> 00:51:45,344
I've given you plenty of chances.

1052
00:51:45,368 --> 00:51:46,426
There are many people

1053
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:48,192
who are more competent than you.

1054
00:51:48,409 --> 00:51:49,885
If this deal falls through,

1055
00:51:49,909 --> 00:51:51,984
you should all be ready to resign.

1056
00:51:54,492 --> 00:51:56,317
Darn it.

1057
00:51:59,242 --> 00:52:01,468
Who pulled such an awful prank?

1058
00:52:01,492 --> 00:52:04,068
My housekeeper.

1059
00:52:04,201 --> 00:52:05,218
Gosh, this is why

1060
00:52:05,242 --> 00:52:07,509
you must be careful with who you hire.

1061
00:52:07,533 --> 00:52:09,260
Can it be restored?

1062
00:52:09,284 --> 00:52:10,426
Don't worry.

1063
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:12,635
I'll put your face back in.

1064
00:52:12,659 --> 00:52:15,609
No one will even be able to tell.

1065
00:52:17,368 --> 00:52:20,843
My gosh, you have good-looking children.

1066
00:52:20,867 --> 00:52:21,926
Right?

1067
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:23,984
They both take after me.

1068
00:52:24,909 --> 00:52:26,968
Seok Kyung is studying vocal music.

1069
00:52:26,992 --> 00:52:29,734
She has an amazing voice.

1070
00:52:29,784 --> 00:52:31,801
And Seok Hoon is very smart.

1071
00:52:31,825 --> 00:52:33,093
He's always the top-ranking student

1072
00:52:33,117 --> 00:52:34,093
at Cheonga Arts High School.

1073
00:52:34,117 --> 00:52:38,776
I see. You must be proud of your kids.

1074
00:52:40,659 --> 00:52:42,859
It's all done.

1075
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:45,192
Here, ma'am.

1076
00:52:46,742 --> 00:52:48,260
Finally, we're back to being

1077
00:52:48,284 --> 00:52:49,859
a perfect family.

1078
00:52:51,117 --> 00:52:52,676
My gosh.

1079
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:54,426
It looks so real.

1080
00:52:54,450 --> 00:52:56,359
Who are you?

1081
00:53:02,242 --> 00:53:03,926
You're...

1082
00:53:03,950 --> 00:53:06,718
This is such a great photo.

1083
00:53:06,742 --> 00:53:08,260
Ms Yang.

1084
00:53:08,284 --> 00:53:09,885
If the chairman finds out about this,

1085
00:53:09,909 --> 00:53:11,468
he'll freak out.

1086
00:53:11,492 --> 00:53:14,385
You're his housekeeper at the penthouse.

1087
00:53:14,409 --> 00:53:15,885
But when you're not there,

1088
00:53:15,909 --> 00:53:17,817
you act like you're his wife.

1089
00:53:17,867 --> 00:53:19,302
Please don't tell him, Mr Gu.

1090
00:53:19,326 --> 00:53:20,426
I beg you, please.

1091
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:23,109
Looks like you've done this many times.

1092
00:53:23,326 --> 00:53:25,135
You've been working for that family

1093
00:53:25,159 --> 00:53:26,551
for almost 20 years.

1094
00:53:26,575 --> 00:53:28,650
Does that mean... Gosh.

1095
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:30,359
No way.

1096
00:53:30,617 --> 00:53:33,400
Are you in love with Chairman Joo?

1097
00:53:33,659 --> 00:53:35,442
Well...

1098
00:53:35,825 --> 00:53:38,551
All I did was love him.

1099
00:53:38,575 --> 00:53:40,984
I never coveted anything that isn't mine.

1100
00:53:42,284 --> 00:53:43,718
What about that outfit?

1101
00:53:43,742 --> 00:53:46,093
Isn't that Ms Sim's?

1102
00:53:46,117 --> 00:53:48,734
And you say you never coveted anything?

1103
00:53:49,368 --> 00:53:51,135
My goodness.

1104
00:53:51,159 --> 00:53:52,635
I'm sorry,

1105
00:53:52,659 --> 00:53:55,885
but Chairman Joo and I are very close,

1106
00:53:55,909 --> 00:53:58,468
so I can't let you get away with this.

1107
00:53:58,492 --> 00:54:01,026
What do you want?

1108
00:54:03,159 --> 00:54:05,509
Tell me everything you know

1109
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:07,942
about Joo Dan Tae, Sim Soo Ryeon,

1110
00:54:08,034 --> 00:54:11,109
and that dead girl, Min Seol A.

1111
00:54:11,368 --> 00:54:13,525
Or shall I call her Anna?

1112
00:54:14,992 --> 00:54:17,177
What do you mean she died at Hera Palace?

1113
00:54:17,201 --> 00:54:18,801
It was all over the news.

1114
00:54:18,825 --> 00:54:21,068
She jumped to her death in Bosong Village.

1115
00:54:22,533 --> 00:54:25,135
If she actually died at Hera Palace,

1116
00:54:25,159 --> 00:54:27,984
why was her body found in Bosong Village?

1117
00:54:28,076 --> 00:54:31,109
Someone must've moved her body there.

1118
00:54:34,409 --> 00:54:36,926
The day of the lighting ceremony

1119
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:38,052
at the fountain.

1120
00:54:38,076 --> 00:54:39,676
November 14th of last year.

1121
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:41,385
Do you remember that day?

1122
00:54:41,409 --> 00:54:42,718
That night, there was

1123
00:54:42,742 --> 00:54:45,484
a lighting ceremony at the fountain.

1124
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:47,484
Yes.

1125
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:49,484
I remember.

1126
00:54:50,242 --> 00:54:51,468
It was Hera Palace's

1127
00:54:51,492 --> 00:54:53,260
first-year anniversary,

1128
00:54:53,284 --> 00:54:55,635
so there were many guests.

1129
00:54:55,659 --> 00:54:59,275
It was an extravagant party.

1130
00:55:00,117 --> 00:55:02,010
Can I see some photos from that night?

1131
00:55:02,034 --> 00:55:04,776
Sure, of course.

1132
00:55:05,742 --> 00:55:07,218
There it is.

1133
00:55:07,242 --> 00:55:08,942
Here.

1134
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:23,609
I bought her these trainers.

1135
00:55:24,867 --> 00:55:26,942
Where are these trainers now?

1136
00:55:32,201 --> 00:55:33,885
Gosh, what is this?

1137
00:55:33,909 --> 00:55:34,968
It's filthy.

1138
00:55:34,992 --> 00:55:37,010
Where did you get this piece of rubbish?

1139
00:55:37,034 --> 00:55:40,233
This belonged to Seol A.

1140
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:45,177
I found it in the lost and found bin

1141
00:55:45,201 --> 00:55:46,093
at Hera Palace.

1142
00:55:46,117 --> 00:55:47,052
What?

1143
00:55:47,076 --> 00:55:48,509
It was found by the fountain on the day

1144
00:55:48,533 --> 00:55:50,359
of the first anniversary party.

1145
00:55:51,242 --> 00:55:53,192
I found a photo of it on my phone.

1146
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:56,426
My gosh! Yes, I remember now.

1147
00:55:56,450 --> 00:55:59,509
Seol A used to wear those dirty trainers.

1148
00:55:59,533 --> 00:56:01,635
They always looked filthy.

1149
00:56:01,659 --> 00:56:03,260
Does this mean

1150
00:56:03,284 --> 00:56:06,484
Seol A actually died at Hera Palace?

1151
00:56:08,117 --> 00:56:09,426
Darn it.

1152
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:11,525
Let's call the police right away.

1153
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:13,509
This is a murder case.

1154
00:56:13,533 --> 00:56:15,218
Maybe the person who sent those messages

1155
00:56:15,242 --> 00:56:16,942
knows who did it.

1156
00:56:16,992 --> 00:56:18,926
We must find out who killed her.

1157
00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:20,567
Are you an idiot?

1158
00:56:21,284 --> 00:56:23,609
One of our parents

1159
00:56:24,492 --> 00:56:26,468
killed Min Seol A.

1160
00:56:28,326 --> 00:56:31,885
What kind of nonsense is that?

1161
00:56:31,909 --> 00:56:33,135
He's right.

1162
00:56:33,159 --> 00:56:36,218
Someone at Hera Palace killed her.

1163
00:56:36,242 --> 00:56:38,026
Other than that,

1164
00:56:38,409 --> 00:56:40,859
there's no reason to move her body.

1165
00:57:00,034 --> 00:57:04,260
Schubert left more than 1,200 works,

1166
00:57:04,284 --> 00:57:06,385
including songs

1167
00:57:06,409 --> 00:57:08,635
and piano pieces.

1168
00:57:08,659 --> 00:57:10,718
His most characteristic works

1169
00:57:10,742 --> 00:57:12,926
are his secular vocal works,

1170
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:15,068
which consist of over 620 pieces.

1171
00:57:15,867 --> 00:57:18,302
Started as modified versions of Singspiel,

1172
00:57:18,326 --> 00:57:20,817
a form of German language music drama,

1173
00:57:21,242 --> 00:57:22,885
these pieces are more unconventional

1174
00:57:22,909 --> 00:57:24,801
and freer in their expressions.

1175
00:57:24,825 --> 00:57:28,109
All right, that's all for today.

1176
00:57:30,770 --> 00:57:31,776
"Min Seol A"

1177
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:39,778
I see that you finally

1178
00:57:39,803 --> 00:57:41,670
found my shoe.

1179
00:57:43,327 --> 00:57:44,902
What is happening?

1180
00:57:55,742 --> 00:57:57,052
Who is doing this?

1181
00:57:57,076 --> 00:57:58,885
Who's pulling this prank on us?

1182
00:57:58,909 --> 00:58:00,609
Show yourself!

1183
00:58:00,825 --> 00:58:03,150
It's definitely someone around us.

1184
00:58:17,284 --> 00:58:19,359
This confirms

1185
00:58:19,784 --> 00:58:22,609
that Seol A was killed at Hera Palace.

1186
00:58:23,950 --> 00:58:26,218
Those who have cardiovascular diseases

1187
00:58:26,242 --> 00:58:27,760
will also have to take

1188
00:58:27,784 --> 00:58:30,260
exceptional care of their health.

1189
00:58:30,284 --> 00:58:32,135
The clinical trials of the nation's first

1190
00:58:32,159 --> 00:58:33,385

This news is making

1194
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:40,551
the company's stock price plummet.

1195
00:58:40,575 --> 00:58:42,509
The stock market stopped

1196

all their transactions

1197
00:58:43,742 --> 00:58:45,426
and called for an official meeting...

1198
00:58:45,450 --> 00:58:46,760
What? - to decide whether or not

1199
00:58:46,784 --> 00:58:47,801
the company should be delisted.

1200

Delisted?

A high-ranking officer

1203
00:58:58,188 --> 00:58:59,472
The phone is turned off.

1204
00:58:59,497 --> 00:59:01,242
Pick up. - Please leave a message

1205

after the tone.

1206
00:59:02,368 --> 00:59:04,400
Why isn't he picking up?

1207
00:59:04,845 --> 00:59:08,295
Answer your phone, you scumbag!

1208
00:59:11,804 --> 00:59:13,312
No.

1209
00:59:15,659 --> 00:59:17,317
My money!

1210
00:59:17,803 --> 00:59:19,310
My money...

1211
00:59:23,201 --> 00:59:25,801
It was reported on the news just now.

1212
00:59:25,825 --> 00:59:28,984
Oh Yoon Hee must've found out by now.

1213
00:59:43,950 --> 00:59:45,426
Did she think I'd let her get away

1214
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:47,026
with taking my money?

1215
00:59:47,409 --> 00:59:49,093
I can't believe I let her fool me.

1216

Enough. You can't change anything

How much did you invest?

1223
01:00:09,034 --> 01:00:11,150
The money I made through the auction.

1224
01:00:11,450 --> 01:00:13,150
And I even took out a mortgage loan.

1225
01:00:13,175 --> 01:00:15,708
I invested everything I had.

1226
01:00:15,936 --> 01:00:17,966
Soo Ryeon, I invested a billion won,

1227
01:00:17,991 --> 01:00:21,024
and I'm about to lose all of it.

1228
01:00:22,201 --> 01:00:24,817
Who gave you the information?

1229

Dr BioGen? Do you mean

the respiratory illness treatment?

1234
01:00:43,284 --> 01:00:44,635
If it's awaiting FDA approval,

1235
01:00:44,659 --> 01:00:46,260
I should move fast.

Your husband

1239
01:00:52,117 --> 01:00:54,509
also got a call about that company.

1240
01:00:54,533 --> 01:00:56,968
Seeing that convinced me

1241
01:00:56,992 --> 01:00:59,150
to invest in their stock.

1242
01:01:01,878 --> 01:01:03,437

What then? Sit here and do nothing?

1254
01:01:25,450 --> 01:01:27,593

01:08:50,950 --> 01:08:51,821
Tell everyone

1359
01:08:51,846 --> 01:08:53,593
that you're Min Seol A's mother.

1360
01:08:53,617 --> 01:08:54,801
It's not nice to be secretive

1361
01:08:54,825 --> 01:08:55,718
and hide things.

1362
01:08:55,742 --> 01:08:57,083
Wait and see.

1363
01:08:57,108 --> 01:09:00,226
It'll be a party you'll never forget.
