Why did Dr Ha pull the plug

on something we almost had finished?

I don't understand.

I can

00:01:17,767 --> 00:01:19,433
totally understand.

20
00:01:20,684 --> 00:01:23,325
Do you think our kids will be disciplined?

21

We'll minimise the damage by any means.

exposed an affair between Cho Sang Heon,

an assemblyman in his second term,

you've committed to this day.

147

Why is this considered a crime?

148
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,350
They got adopted to rich families

and enjoyed living a luxurious life

150

were abandoned again,

Yes.

162

He's a bit ill.

163
00:08:31,142 --> 00:08:33,380
So you need to help him a little, Anna.

Can you do that?

165

166
00:08:42,767 --> 00:08:44,270
I had a sick brother.

167
00:08:55,934 --> 00:08:56,825
Come on.

00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:57,976
It wasn't me!

169
00:08:58,101 --> 00:08:59,159
I didn't steal it! - Shut up!

170
00:08:59,184 --> 00:09:00,534
Come on. - You get in there.

171
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:01,909
He's my brother! Tell them!

172

Say something to them, please!

173
00:09:04,809 --> 00:09:06,534
All these kids were given up

174
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,201
as soon as the bone marrow transplant

175
00:09:08,226 --> 00:09:09,096
was finished.

176
00:09:09,121 --> 00:09:10,652
They were all deported!

177
00:09:11,309 --> 00:09:13,159
Did you let these poor kids get adopted

178
00:09:13,184 --> 00:09:14,441
to use them as donors?

179
00:09:15,642 --> 00:09:17,408
Then they framed them and kicked them out

180
00:09:17,433 --> 00:09:18,367
once they served their purpose?

181
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:19,575
Hey, lady.

182
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,600
I have no idea what this is about.

183
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,700
How would I know what the adoptive parents

184
00:09:23,725 --> 00:09:24,976
did to them?

185
00:09:25,517 --> 00:09:26,951
Everything had been planned already

186
00:09:26,976 --> 00:09:28,334
before you sent them.

187
00:09:28,392 --> 00:09:29,492
That's how you built your building

188
00:09:29,517 --> 00:09:30,776
that cost you 10 billion won.

189
00:09:31,268 --> 00:09:32,742
Do you have evidence?

190
00:09:32,767 --> 00:09:34,269
Are you guilty of your crime

191
00:09:35,226 --> 00:09:36,968
only when there's evidence?

192
00:09:42,142 --> 00:09:43,350
This is evidence of a connection

193
00:09:43,392 --> 00:09:44,840
between you and Director Min.

194
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,350
I already knew he had been

195
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,126
laundering your slush fund.

196
00:09:52,517 --> 00:09:54,725
You've done your share of work, Ms Sim.

197
00:09:55,677 --> 00:09:57,277
Are you this desperate

198
00:09:57,302 --> 00:09:59,257
not to get kicked out of your house?

199
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:02,407
Hey, you know what?

200
00:10:02,767 --> 00:10:04,742
You're the one who did that to her.

201
00:10:04,767 --> 00:10:06,268
You killed her.

202
00:10:06,293 --> 00:10:08,127
You abandoned her first.

203
00:10:08,433 --> 00:10:10,184
You don't even know anything.

204
00:10:11,017 --> 00:10:12,867
You need to ask for forgiveness

205
00:10:12,892 --> 00:10:15,426
and get punished for your dirty crimes.

206
00:10:17,226 --> 00:10:18,325
I'll expose everything

207
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,441
you've done to Seol A.

208
00:10:22,408 --> 00:10:24,325
I've been in politics long enough.

209
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,700
There are many out there who can save me.

210
00:10:26,725 --> 00:10:27,992
And one of those people

211
00:10:28,017 --> 00:10:30,309
is your husband, Joo Dan Tae.

212
00:10:30,892 --> 00:10:31,951
If you want to know,

213
00:10:31,976 --> 00:10:34,026
I'll call him myself and ask.

214
00:10:40,637 --> 00:10:41,762
Let go.

215
00:10:41,787 --> 00:10:42,742
Let go.

216
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,282
I said let go!

217
00:10:54,392 --> 00:10:55,309
Get up.

218
00:11:02,767 --> 00:11:03,684
I will

219
00:11:03,809 --> 00:11:05,059
kill you.

220
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:37,522
Mr Cho, I'm here.

221
00:11:41,692 --> 00:11:42,917
Mr Cho!

222
00:11:42,942 --> 00:11:44,167
This is Oh Yoon Hee.

223
00:11:44,192 --> 00:11:45,527
Are you in there?

224
00:11:49,568 --> 00:11:52,828
Mr Cho, I'm coming in.

225
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:58,137
Mr Cho. Are you here?

226
00:12:03,025 --> 00:12:04,264
Mr Cho.

227
00:12:41,484 --> 00:12:42,814
"Oh Yoon Hee's family"

228
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:48,251
Why is Ro Na's photo here?

229
00:12:48,276 --> 00:12:49,907
"Bae Ro Na, vocal music lesson room"

230
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:53,775
You need to get here now

231
00:12:54,025 --> 00:12:55,484
and hand me all the money I gave you.

232
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:57,195
If you don't, that'll be

233
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,965
the end of your daughter's life!

234
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:02,906
"Bae Ro Na, vocal music lesson room"

235
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:16,568
"Husband"

236
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:20,526
I know that woman.

237
00:14:21,442 --> 00:14:22,650
You should get out of here.

238
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,526
I'll manage the rest.

239
00:14:25,317 --> 00:14:26,984
A man just died.

240
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:28,442
Trust me

241
00:14:28,775 --> 00:14:29,859
and leave this place.

242
00:14:34,733 --> 00:14:35,733
You need to leave.

243
00:14:36,568 --> 00:14:37,526
Hurry.

244
00:14:48,484 --> 00:14:51,733
"Soo Ryeon"

245
00:14:58,317 --> 00:14:59,817
Your call cannot be connected.

246
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,859
Where are you?

247
00:15:14,192 --> 00:15:16,276
I... I didn't see anything.

248
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,526
I don't know anything.

249
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,025
I haven't seen anything.

250
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,317
Are you sure everything is resolved?

251
00:15:33,484 --> 00:15:34,526
Our school's reputation

252
00:15:34,609 --> 00:15:35,900
could've fallen into the gutter.

253
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,317
Group assault?

254
00:15:38,733 --> 00:15:40,109
And why is my granddaughter

255
00:15:40,192 --> 00:15:41,150
involved in this ruckus?

256
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:43,234
Don't you know what our school is like?

257
00:15:44,359 --> 00:15:45,526
We have 50 years of history

258
00:15:45,609 --> 00:15:46,609
as the most prestigious private school.

259
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:47,775
I'm sorry, Dad.

260
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,817
Something like this won't happen again.

261
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,568
Why did Eun Byeol do that?

262
00:15:53,817 --> 00:15:55,025
As if she was raised without proper care.

263
00:15:55,568 --> 00:15:56,942
Stop it, Mum.

264
00:15:57,317 --> 00:16:00,442
Dad, my husband arranged

265
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:02,067
this special occasion

266
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,650
to help you two feel better.

267
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,775
You're right.

268
00:16:05,025 --> 00:16:07,859
I heard your resort is doing very well.

269
00:16:07,942 --> 00:16:08,775
Yes.

270
00:16:08,859 --> 00:16:10,401
We recorded our highest sale last month.

271
00:16:12,067 --> 00:16:13,733
You must've taken after your father

272
00:16:13,817 --> 00:16:15,692
in your knack for running a business.

273
00:16:18,859 --> 00:16:20,692
This is why one's family is important.

274
00:16:21,234 --> 00:16:22,568
Please excuse me.

275
00:16:22,942 --> 00:16:24,317
I need to go back to the hospital.

276
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,775
Sit down.

277
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,192
Enjoy your dinner.

278
00:16:27,317 --> 00:16:28,442
I said sit down.

279
00:16:32,067 --> 00:16:33,942
We aren't done eating.

280
00:16:35,775 --> 00:16:37,150
What did I tell you?

281
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,442
I told you he wouldn't like

282
00:16:39,526 --> 00:16:40,859
eating a course meal.

283
00:16:41,733 --> 00:16:43,817
Seo Jin, is something going on?

284
00:16:44,276 --> 00:16:45,609
Did you two get into a fight?

285
00:16:45,859 --> 00:16:46,942
I heard your parents' grape farm

286
00:16:47,025 --> 00:16:47,859
isn't doing so well.

287
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:50,234
Do you need money?

288
00:16:51,568 --> 00:16:53,067
Is that why you're protesting?

289
00:16:53,401 --> 00:16:54,276
Father.

290
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:56,609
Goodness, a narrow-minded man like him

291
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,234
isn't good for anything.

292
00:17:01,733 --> 00:17:02,733
I'm sorry.

293
00:17:03,025 --> 00:17:04,942
That's as big as my mind gets.

294
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:06,609
Please excuse me.

295
00:17:13,025 --> 00:17:14,900
If you continue to disappoint me,

296
00:17:15,192 --> 00:17:16,359
I'll hand over Cheonga Foundation

297
00:17:17,276 --> 00:17:18,484
to Seo Young.

298
00:17:22,568 --> 00:17:24,067
What do you mean?

299
00:17:25,067 --> 00:17:26,276
Why would Seo Young take over?

300
00:17:27,526 --> 00:17:28,526
No.

301
00:17:29,109 --> 00:17:30,733
I'll succeed the foundation anyway.

302
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,900
I'll wrap up my business and work there.

303
00:17:33,109 --> 00:17:34,733
In order to build up the foundation,

304
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:36,942
it might be better for her to take over

305
00:17:37,025 --> 00:17:38,484
since her in-laws have enough power.

306
00:17:38,733 --> 00:17:39,900
If you leave it to me,

307
00:17:39,984 --> 00:17:41,942
I can do a great job too, Dad.

308
00:17:42,025 --> 00:17:42,859
Don't be greedy.

309
00:17:42,942 --> 00:17:43,984
That place is mine.

310
00:17:44,775 --> 00:17:47,109
Why did you marry such a useless man?

311
00:18:04,526 --> 00:18:06,568
He never lets a day pass by in peace.

312
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:07,733
Your father.

313
00:18:11,942 --> 00:18:13,109
"Your father"?

314
00:18:13,568 --> 00:18:14,484
Yes!

315
00:18:14,568 --> 00:18:16,192
Your majestic father and mother.

316
00:18:16,692 --> 00:18:18,234
How can they never forget to show

317
00:18:18,317 --> 00:18:19,650
that they do not approve

318
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:21,276
of their eldest son-in-law?

319
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:26,109
What exactly is your problem?

320
00:18:26,484 --> 00:18:27,900
If I got rid of your countrified nature,

321
00:18:27,984 --> 00:18:29,692
the least you can do is try harder!

322
00:18:30,775 --> 00:18:33,067
What more do I have to do to try harder?

323
00:18:36,317 --> 00:18:37,609
I've done everything I could.

324
00:18:38,109 --> 00:18:40,025
What do they hate so much about me?

325
00:18:40,401 --> 00:18:41,484
Because my parents

326
00:18:41,568 --> 00:18:42,484
are uneducated and poor?

327
00:18:42,692 --> 00:18:43,900
Or because they have a grape farm?

328
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:45,609
If they hated that so much,

329
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:47,192
they shouldn't have let me marry you.

330
00:18:47,442 --> 00:18:48,859
If I'd known they'd torment me like this,

331
00:18:48,942 --> 00:18:50,609
I wouldn't have married you!

332
00:18:55,984 --> 00:18:57,859
I guess you regret it to death.

333
00:18:59,025 --> 00:19:00,401
Do you have nothing to hide

334
00:19:00,484 --> 00:19:01,650
now that everyone knows

335
00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:03,733
you gave 100 million won to Yoon Hee?

336
00:19:04,609 --> 00:19:05,984
You betrayed the woman you loved

337
00:19:06,067 --> 00:19:07,568
and came to be with me!

338
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,192
You made this choice yourself!

339
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,067
Do you know that

340
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,568
you're becoming lousier by the day?

341
00:19:16,733 --> 00:19:18,442
I hate everything about you,

342
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:21,359
but what I hate the most

343
00:19:22,067 --> 00:19:23,150
is this inferiority complex

344
00:19:23,234 --> 00:19:24,150
engraved in your mind.

345
00:19:26,401 --> 00:19:27,359
That's the worst.

346
00:19:29,609 --> 00:19:30,526
Hey.

347
00:19:31,568 --> 00:19:32,526
Hey!

348
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:33,984
Stop right there!

349
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:38,025
Darn it.

350
00:19:41,401 --> 00:19:42,859
You!

351
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,067
You're home.

352
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:54,484
When did you get home?

353
00:19:55,109 --> 00:19:56,025
Just now.

354
00:19:57,401 --> 00:19:58,401
You called, right?

355
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:01,109
I fell asleep while getting a massage.

356
00:20:01,317 --> 00:20:02,234
I'm sorry.

357
00:20:04,192 --> 00:20:05,526
You must be very tired

358
00:20:06,401 --> 00:20:08,234
if you went to get a massage at this hour.

359
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:10,276
On top of that,

360
00:20:10,526 --> 00:20:11,609
you fell asleep too.

361
00:20:12,109 --> 00:20:13,650
I haven't slept well lately.

362
00:20:14,401 --> 00:20:15,733
I guess I was a bit tired.

363
00:20:16,692 --> 00:20:18,234
Kyu Jin is in your study.

364
00:20:19,609 --> 00:20:21,692
I prepared wine and a light snack.

365
00:20:22,067 --> 00:20:23,025
Okay.

366
00:20:23,526 --> 00:20:24,442
Thanks.

367
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:36,317
Goodness.

368
00:20:37,442 --> 00:20:38,442
I'll take it.

369
00:20:38,692 --> 00:20:39,650
Thanks.

370
00:20:41,025 --> 00:20:41,984
Thank you.

371
00:20:56,067 --> 00:20:57,276
I wasn't expecting your call

372
00:20:57,359 --> 00:20:58,359
all of a sudden.

373
00:20:58,650 --> 00:20:59,568
What now?

374
00:20:59,984 --> 00:21:01,359
Did something happen to our kids again?

375
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:02,359
No.

376
00:21:02,442 --> 00:21:04,359
I wanted to discuss our business today.

377
00:21:07,526 --> 00:21:08,442
In three months,

378
00:21:08,526 --> 00:21:09,568
the redevelopment of Bosong Village

379
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:10,609
will be announced.

380
00:21:11,234 --> 00:21:13,526
I plan on building the second Hera Palace.

381
00:21:14,317 --> 00:21:15,359
Wasn't the redevelopment plan

382
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:17,568
for Bosong revoked many times already?

383
00:21:17,775 --> 00:21:19,192
And there's trouble over compensation.

384
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:20,276
I heard

385
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:21,942
Changryong Village is the most likely.

386
00:21:22,692 --> 00:21:23,984
Bosong Village currently has

387
00:21:24,067 --> 00:21:25,609
a total of seven units on sale.

388
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,859
If we do our best,

389
00:21:26,942 --> 00:21:28,025
we can purchase up to 10 units.

390
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:30,650
This is a beautiful chance to make

391
00:21:30,692 --> 00:21:32,442
eight billion won in a short period

392
00:21:32,526 --> 00:21:33,942
by putting in just two billion won.

393
00:21:34,109 --> 00:21:35,067
That much?

394
00:21:35,733 --> 00:21:37,568
But what about the titles?

395
00:21:37,692 --> 00:21:39,317
Of course we'll use different names.

396
00:21:39,609 --> 00:21:40,733
I already got the people.

397
00:21:41,526 --> 00:21:43,276
Goodness, Chairman Joo.

398
00:21:43,442 --> 00:21:45,192
You're a man with a great initiative.

399
00:21:45,276 --> 00:21:46,526
You remind me of my mum.

400
00:21:47,067 --> 00:21:48,859
But wait, Bosong Village.

401
00:21:49,915 --> 00:21:50,957
Min Seol A.

402
00:21:51,609 --> 00:21:53,192
It's where that kid used to live.

403
00:21:53,984 --> 00:21:54,942
You're right.

404
00:21:55,234 --> 00:21:57,692
That's why Dr Ha isn't in this plan.

405
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,733
Our kids got punished

406
00:22:00,067 --> 00:22:01,067
with 20 hours of volunteer work

407
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:02,379
after the Min Seol A incident,

408
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,237
so he must pay for disappointing us.

409
00:22:04,893 --> 00:22:05,935
I'm glad you did.

410
00:22:07,276 --> 00:22:09,109
"Stop the witch hunt, please.

411
00:22:09,568 --> 00:22:11,276
Framing an innocent person

412
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:13,817
won't do the school any good."

413
00:22:14,609 --> 00:22:15,609
I'll meet you at the garden.

414
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:16,568
What was that guy saying?

415
00:22:16,692 --> 00:22:18,792
I get that she's his first love,

416
00:22:18,817 --> 00:22:20,167
but his wife was right there

417
00:22:20,192 --> 00:22:21,317
with her eyes wide open.

418
00:22:21,526 --> 00:22:23,209
He must have gone insane from

419
00:22:23,234 --> 00:22:24,668
his in-laws repeatedly killing his spirit.

420
00:22:24,693 --> 00:22:26,200
Goodness. That loser.

421
00:22:26,401 --> 00:22:28,000
I'm not done talking yet.

422
00:22:28,025 --> 00:22:28,984
Our plan includes

423
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,859
Min Seol A's old house too.

424
00:22:31,109 --> 00:22:32,025
What?

425
00:22:32,775 --> 00:22:34,733
There's no need to buy a house

426
00:22:34,817 --> 00:22:36,955
where someone has died.

427
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:39,359
She set it on fire and killed herself,

428
00:22:39,442 --> 00:22:41,359
so the owner put it up like a giveaway.

429
00:22:42,317 --> 00:22:43,501
He's looking for a quick sale,

430
00:22:43,526 --> 00:22:45,859
so I plan on purchasing it this week.

431
00:22:47,526 --> 00:22:48,692
All right.

432
00:23:03,984 --> 00:23:05,234
This is a great opportunity for us.

433
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:06,942
We can do the work ourselves

434
00:23:07,025 --> 00:23:08,442
to wipe out Min Seol A's traces.

435
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:09,568
Okay.

436
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:10,526
Let's take that house.

437
00:23:11,984 --> 00:23:14,025
She ended up doing us some good.

438
00:23:20,109 --> 00:23:21,150
Joo Dan Tae.

439
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,192
Things won't go the way you want.

440
00:23:27,234 --> 00:23:29,025
I won't let that happen.

441
00:23:51,775 --> 00:23:52,692
What's going on?

442
00:23:53,442 --> 00:23:54,733
Why are you so passionate today?

443
00:23:56,442 --> 00:23:57,568
Don't say another word

444
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:58,900
and play along with me.

445
00:24:00,442 --> 00:24:02,484
Why did a charming woman like you

446
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:04,900
marry a guy like Ha Yoon Chul?

447
00:24:06,775 --> 00:24:08,733
I wanted him because I couldn't have him.

448
00:24:10,109 --> 00:24:11,733
And I thought that was love.

449
00:24:13,025 --> 00:24:14,568
I was foolish and immature.

450
00:24:16,733 --> 00:24:17,650
Come here.

451
00:24:26,109 --> 00:24:27,900
There won't be a thing you can't have

452
00:24:28,609 --> 00:24:29,650
from now on.

453
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:52,317
Assemblyman Cho Sang Heon

454
00:24:52,401 --> 00:24:53,317
of Happy Future Party,

455
00:24:53,442 --> 00:24:54,859
who was suspected to be in an affair,

456
00:24:54,984 --> 00:24:56,650
was found dead in the bathroom

457
00:24:56,692 --> 00:24:57,984
of his vacation home.

458
00:24:58,568 --> 00:25:00,025
The police began the investigation

459
00:25:00,109 --> 00:25:01,234
with the possibility of slipping

460
00:25:01,317 --> 00:25:03,234
and suffering from cerebral haemorrhage,

461
00:25:03,317 --> 00:25:04,359
which could've led to his death.

462
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:06,401
At this point, there is no evidence

463
00:25:06,484 --> 00:25:08,067
pointing to the possibility of homicide.

464
00:25:08,317 --> 00:25:10,109
The NFS plans on conducting an autopsy

465
00:25:10,234 --> 00:25:11,650
to find the details of the incident.

466
00:25:12,067 --> 00:25:12,984
The actress who was suspected...

467
00:25:13,067 --> 00:25:14,859
He was found in the bathroom?

468
00:25:14,942 --> 00:25:16,192
of having an affair with Mr Cho

469
00:25:16,276 --> 00:25:17,609
has not made a statement at this point.

470
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:18,733
He wasn't there.

471
00:25:20,317 --> 00:25:21,733
The police will make another report

472
00:25:21,817 --> 00:25:23,484
as soon as they have further information.

473
00:25:29,367 --> 00:25:30,326
Hello?

474
00:25:30,534 --> 00:25:32,217
This is Songpa Police Station.

475
00:25:32,242 --> 00:25:34,117
We'd like to question you as a witness

476
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,700
regarding Mr Cho Sang Heon's death.

477
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,625
Could you come to the station?

478
00:25:38,034 --> 00:25:38,967
You were the last person

479
00:25:38,992 --> 00:25:40,075
he talked to before his death.

480
00:25:40,451 --> 00:25:41,783
We need you here immediately.

481
00:25:42,867 --> 00:25:43,783
Ms Oh.

482
00:25:44,229 --> 00:25:45,075
Ms Oh?

483
00:26:08,075 --> 00:26:09,700
I'll kill you if you scream.

484
00:26:10,909 --> 00:26:12,284
Do not look back.

485
00:26:20,742 --> 00:26:22,451
Who are you?

486
00:26:23,034 --> 00:26:25,150
You'll only answer my questions.

487
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,842
Why did you run away

488
00:26:27,867 --> 00:26:29,675
from Cho Sang Heon's house?

489
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,700
That's...

490
00:26:32,534 --> 00:26:34,200
I didn't kill him.

491
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:36,175
When I got there,

492
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,342
he was already dead.

493
00:26:37,367 --> 00:26:38,842
I mean it. Please trust me.

494
00:26:38,867 --> 00:26:40,359
Why were you there?

495
00:26:40,659 --> 00:26:42,687
He had been blackmailing me.

496
00:26:43,242 --> 00:26:44,742
He had a wrong idea

497
00:26:45,242 --> 00:26:47,350
that I leaked out his love affair.

498
00:26:47,659 --> 00:26:48,576
That's why

499
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,361
I went there to explain myself.

500
00:26:51,909 --> 00:26:53,451
"Bae Ro Na, vocal music lesson room"

501
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,534
Someone was there.

502
00:26:57,867 --> 00:27:00,213
I heard someone's phone vibrate,

503
00:27:00,783 --> 00:27:03,092
and there was a bag on the sofa.

504
00:27:03,117 --> 00:27:04,225
What you saw

505
00:27:04,909 --> 00:27:06,700
is of no importance.

506
00:27:07,409 --> 00:27:08,950
Head over to the police station

507
00:27:09,242 --> 00:27:10,551
and tell them Cho Sang Heon

508
00:27:10,576 --> 00:27:12,072
was already dead in the bathroom.

509
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,700
Other than that,

510
00:27:14,117 --> 00:27:15,721
you have seen or heard

511
00:27:16,242 --> 00:27:17,810
absolutely nothing.

512
00:27:18,909 --> 00:27:22,034
Why... Why do I have to lie?

513
00:27:24,117 --> 00:27:25,117
If you want

514
00:27:26,242 --> 00:27:28,200
you and your daughter to live,

515
00:27:29,618 --> 00:27:31,284
you'd better do as I say.

516
00:27:34,326 --> 00:27:35,497
Instead,

517
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,975
I'll give you important information.

518
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,800

My son, you're the best.

525
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:45,392
Eat just one serving. - I love you!

526
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:46,684
You need to lose weight. - Have fun!

527
00:29:46,709 --> 00:29:47,812
I love you too!

528
00:29:47,837 --> 00:29:48,796
Good luck. - Okay.

00:29:51,417 --> 00:29:53,376
Soo Ryeon, I'm so jealous.

530
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:54,684
I heard Seok Hoon will play

531
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:55,892
the solo for the admission recital,

532
00:29:55,917 --> 00:29:57,434
and Seok Kyung will sing the solo too.

535
00:30:00,792 --> 00:30:01,875
Ms Cheon. - Hello.

536
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,774
Ms Cheon.

537
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:04,036
Ms Cheon.

538
00:30:04,209 --> 00:30:06,501
Why did Dr Ha do that?

539
00:30:06,668 --> 00:30:07,792
I can't believe he took her side.

540
00:30:08,028 --> 00:30:10,694
He made everything go haywire.

541
00:30:10,719 --> 00:30:12,136
I talked to the chief director

542
00:30:12,292 --> 00:30:13,542
and made the punishment

543
00:30:13,567 --> 00:30:14,668
as light as possible.

544
00:30:14,693 --> 00:30:16,611
So let's wrap it up at that.

545
00:30:16,959 --> 00:30:18,833
It's 20 hours of volunteer work!

546
00:30:19,034 --> 00:30:21,451
How can Je Ni do such rough work?

547
00:30:21,742 --> 00:30:23,034
This isn't the first time

548
00:30:23,117 --> 00:30:24,492
we got in trouble for trusting you.

549
00:30:24,576 --> 00:30:26,492
Then you can draw a line between us,

550
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:28,075
and don't get involved with me.

551
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,842
Fine, do that.

552
00:30:29,867 --> 00:30:31,534
Let's draw a line!

553
00:30:31,783 --> 00:30:32,842
Do you think I'm scared?

554
00:30:32,867 --> 00:30:34,284
I can always find another teacher.

555
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,012
Head of Arts, time to begin your class.

556
00:30:39,242 --> 00:30:40,777
Are the kids all there?

557
00:30:46,659 --> 00:30:47,534
Wait.

"Head of Arts"?

559
00:30:49,242 --> 00:30:50,117
Who?

560
00:30:50,451 --> 00:30:52,242
Ms Cheon became the new Head of Arts

561
00:30:52,326 --> 00:30:54,075
for Cheonga starting this semester.

562
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:55,576
What? - What?

563
00:30:59,075 --> 00:31:00,925
I'm the Head of Arts,

564
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:01,992
in charge of your admission recital.

565
00:31:02,409 --> 00:31:03,534
As you all know,

566
00:31:03,618 --> 00:31:05,534
we do not have the first place this year.

567
00:31:05,867 --> 00:31:07,242
So the second place, Joo Seok Kyung,

568
00:31:07,326 --> 00:31:08,367
will sing the solo.

569
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:09,825
Give her a hand.

570
00:31:14,409 --> 00:31:16,367
Cheonga's admission recital is

571
00:31:16,451 --> 00:31:17,825
an important event with a long tradition.

572

Many important figures of the industry

573

will be there as honoured guests.

574
00:31:20,825 --> 00:31:22,534
I hope everyone, not just Seok Kyung,

575
00:31:22,825 --> 00:31:24,075
will practise very hard.

behind years of support for an orphanage

579
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,117
made by Assemblyman Cho Sang Heon.

580
00:32:02,618 --> 00:32:04,492
Cho was involved in the overseas adoption

581
00:32:04,576 --> 00:32:05,700
for a bone marrow transplant.

582
00:32:05,783 --> 00:32:07,242
The children were sent back afterwards

583
00:32:07,409 --> 00:32:08,618
and he made tens of billions of won

584
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,576
through the process.

I'm assuming you know about the accident.

689
00:38:54,383 --> 00:38:55,299
What accident?

Come on.

691

A young girl lived there alone,

692
00:38:58,409 --> 00:38:59,509
but she set the place on fire

693
00:38:59,534 --> 00:39:00,426

Thank you.

703
00:39:36,609 --> 00:39:37,800
I just let her off the hook.

704
00:39:37,825 --> 00:39:39,409
I could've totally punched her back.

705
00:39:39,783 --> 00:39:41,534
Why let her off the hook?

706
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:42,733

708
00:39:44,492 --> 00:39:45,884
What if she demands

709

compensation like last time?

00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:10,792
Hey!

860
00:47:10,875 --> 00:47:11,792
You should've looked

861
00:47:11,917 --> 00:47:12,833
more thoroughly! - You little...

862
00:47:13,209 --> 00:47:15,209
Gosh, I want to punch you right now.

863
00:47:15,292 --> 00:47:16,292
Goodness. - Hey.

864
00:47:16,376 --> 00:47:18,417
Geez, you piece of...

865
00:47:22,042 --> 00:47:23,542
From the sign that was hanging

866
00:47:23,626 --> 00:47:24,584
above the fountain

867
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:25,750
to the recording

868
00:47:25,833 --> 00:47:27,334
uploaded on the school website.

869
00:47:28,084 --> 00:47:29,125
Something's not right.

870
00:47:30,709 --> 00:47:31,542
Maybe Min Seol A

871
00:47:31,626 --> 00:47:32,668
didn't actually kill herself.

872
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:34,792
What if one of us killed her?

873
00:47:34,917 --> 00:47:35,833
Isn't that why

874
00:47:35,917 --> 00:47:37,125
we're being threatened like this?

875
00:47:37,209 --> 00:47:38,417
Let's be honest.

876
00:47:39,084 --> 00:47:40,626
Wasn't Chairman Joo the one

877
00:47:40,709 --> 00:47:41,917
who started and led the whole thing?

878
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,125
You suggested that we should

879
00:47:44,209 --> 00:47:47,292
move the body to Min Seol A's place.

880
00:47:47,417 --> 00:47:48,833
Did you want to take care of it quickly

881
00:47:48,917 --> 00:47:49,750
because you felt guilty?

882
00:47:49,917 --> 00:47:51,376
So you dragged us into it

883
00:47:51,459 --> 00:47:53,209
and set Min Seol A's place on fire.

884
00:47:53,668 --> 00:47:55,292
You started that fire?

885
00:47:55,833 --> 00:47:56,833
My gosh.

886
00:47:56,917 --> 00:47:59,334
Chairman Joo, you really scare me.

887
00:47:59,417 --> 00:48:01,584
Come to think of it, didn't Seok Kyung

888
00:48:01,668 --> 00:48:03,125
benefit the most from this?

889
00:48:03,626 --> 00:48:04,626
She became the top student

890
00:48:04,709 --> 00:48:05,750
because Min Seol A died.

891
00:48:05,833 --> 00:48:08,334
And she even has a solo performance now.

892
00:48:09,167 --> 00:48:10,875
This is exactly what this person wants.

893
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:12,959
Doubting each other and becoming divisive.

894
00:48:13,459 --> 00:48:15,250
So what's important now? The fountain,

895
00:48:15,334 --> 00:48:16,626
the recording, and the pocket watch!

896
00:48:16,959 --> 00:48:19,000
Someone knows what we did.

897
00:48:19,084 --> 00:48:20,334
Somebody knows.

898
00:48:20,417 --> 00:48:22,750
That means there's a witness.

899
00:48:22,917 --> 00:48:24,542
We must find out who it is.

900
00:48:24,959 --> 00:48:26,250
Our number one priority is finding out

901
00:48:26,334 --> 00:48:27,209
who's threatening us.

902
00:48:28,292 --> 00:48:29,917
There's someone I'm suspicious of.

903
00:48:30,875 --> 00:48:31,917
Who?

904
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,750
Someone with the recording

905
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:35,584
who isn't here right now

906
00:48:35,668 --> 00:48:37,042
and wasn't involved in the incident at all

907
00:48:37,125 --> 00:48:39,042
on the night of the party.

908
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:41,959
Are you talking about Soo Ryeon?

909
00:48:42,376 --> 00:48:43,334
Why would she do that?

910
00:48:43,417 --> 00:48:45,000
Her kids are involved in this too.

911
00:48:45,292 --> 00:48:46,750
You're right!

912
00:48:47,084 --> 00:48:49,501
She's the only person who wasn't there.

913
00:48:49,584 --> 00:48:50,750
And she got all worked up

914
00:48:50,833 --> 00:48:52,000
whenever Min Seol A's name came up.

915
00:48:52,084 --> 00:48:53,209
Am I wrong?

916
00:48:53,292 --> 00:48:54,833
She didn't come to the party that evening

917
00:48:54,917 --> 00:48:56,750
and even left during the ceremony.

918
00:48:58,125 --> 00:48:59,334
What if

919
00:49:00,584 --> 00:49:01,917
Soo Ryeon really saw us?

920
00:49:02,792 --> 00:49:03,917
That day, she wasn't

921
00:49:04,792 --> 00:49:06,584
feeling well, so she stayed in...

922
00:49:16,709 --> 00:49:17,917
Your wife, Ms Sim Soo Ryeon,

923
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,334
kept calling Min Seol A as well.

924
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:28,584
I'm excited thinking about

925
00:49:28,668 --> 00:49:29,750
our date in a while.

926
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:31,209
Don't mind me.

927
00:49:31,292 --> 00:49:32,750
Take your time and finish your work.

928
00:49:35,501 --> 00:49:37,917
Chairman Joo! Where are you going?

929
00:49:38,167 --> 00:49:39,501
What's going on?

930
00:49:49,746 --> 00:49:51,913
"Camtech Viewer"

931
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:16,292
"CEO Joo Dan Tae"

932
00:50:21,292 --> 00:50:22,334
When did you start

933
00:50:22,917 --> 00:50:24,340
doing things behind my back?

934
00:50:25,584 --> 00:50:26,850
I guess you didn't know

935
00:50:26,875 --> 00:50:28,773
I had CCTV cameras in my office.

936
00:50:30,125 --> 00:50:31,334
I'm sorry, sir.

937
00:50:31,833 --> 00:50:32,917
You're sorry?

938
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:35,626
Tell me what you are scheming

939
00:50:35,651 --> 00:50:36,817
with my wife!

940
00:50:37,042 --> 00:50:38,100
I saved you from the streets

941
00:50:38,125 --> 00:50:39,059
and gave you a proper job.

942
00:50:39,084 --> 00:50:40,725
How dare you betray me.

943
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:41,792
You'd better tell me.

944
00:50:41,875 --> 00:50:43,792
What did you tell my wife?

945
00:50:44,467 --> 00:50:46,815
You can never get away from me. Got it?

946
00:50:47,084 --> 00:50:48,715
Thank you for everything

947
00:50:49,209 --> 00:50:50,598
over the years.

948
00:50:53,334 --> 00:50:54,542
"End Call"

949
00:50:55,209 --> 00:50:56,626
Darn it!

950
00:51:02,875 --> 00:51:03,875
Secretary Cho.

951
00:51:03,959 --> 00:51:05,626
Get in here!

952
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:13,084
Bring Yoon Tae Ju to me at once.

953
00:51:13,167 --> 00:51:14,292
Dead or alive, I don't care.

954
00:51:14,376 --> 00:51:15,501
Just bring him to me!

955
00:51:15,584 --> 00:51:16,501
Yes, sir.

956
00:51:16,584 --> 00:51:17,750
Did you look into that thing?

957
00:51:17,833 --> 00:51:19,750
Here's your wife's call log.

958
00:51:20,668 --> 00:51:21,584
Anything unusual?

959
00:51:21,668 --> 00:51:23,668
I looked up the number she called often,

960
00:51:25,209 --> 00:51:26,417
and it's a detective agency.

961
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:29,542
A detective agency?

962
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,125
Well...

963
00:51:36,542 --> 00:51:39,542
Do we really have to do this?

964
00:51:39,626 --> 00:51:40,750
This is so pathetic.

965
00:51:40,792 --> 00:51:42,668
Come on. I'm sure she's up to something.

966
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:44,417
You need to help us out

967
00:51:44,542 --> 00:51:46,668
since you're an attorney.

968
00:51:47,042 --> 00:51:48,875
Oh, there she is.

969
00:51:48,959 --> 00:51:50,084
Gosh.

970
00:51:54,584 --> 00:51:55,709
Let's hurry. We might lose her.

971
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:56,750
Go! - Gosh.

972
00:51:56,833 --> 00:51:58,209
Let's go. Put on your seat belt.

973
00:52:04,584 --> 00:52:05,792
"Aram Detective Agency"

974
00:52:06,709 --> 00:52:07,792
Who are you? - Move!

975
00:52:14,668 --> 00:52:16,000
Who are you guys?

976
00:52:21,209 --> 00:52:22,334
You know this woman, right?

977
00:52:24,292 --> 00:52:26,167
What did she ask you to find out?

978
00:52:31,668 --> 00:52:32,542
I will ask again.

979
00:52:32,626 --> 00:52:34,959
Why did she come to see you?

980
00:52:35,084 --> 00:52:36,750
That's confidential information,

981
00:52:36,833 --> 00:52:38,042
so I can't tell you.

982
00:52:41,376 --> 00:52:42,626
You'd better tell us

983
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:44,250
before I break all your limbs.

984
00:52:44,792 --> 00:52:46,042
Okay, I'll tell you.

985
00:52:46,125 --> 00:52:47,209
I'll tell you everything,

986
00:52:47,292 --> 00:52:49,209
so please don't kill me.

987
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:53,084
How have you been?

988
00:52:54,167 --> 00:52:56,917
I'm sorry for not visiting you often.

989
00:53:11,417 --> 00:53:13,084
I knew it!

990
00:53:16,376 --> 00:53:17,917
What on earth are you doing here?

991
00:53:18,459 --> 00:53:19,959
What brings you here?

992
00:53:20,042 --> 00:53:21,334
What is this?

993
00:53:21,417 --> 00:53:22,709
You even got

994
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:24,626
a columbarium niche for Min Seol A?

995
00:53:24,709 --> 00:53:25,750
Why are you

996
00:53:25,792 --> 00:53:28,417
so obsessed with that girl?

997
00:53:28,626 --> 00:53:30,125
What is your relationship to her?

998
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:32,626
What are you talking about?

999
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:35,084
Are you the one who's been threatening us?

1000
00:53:35,167 --> 00:53:36,584
And did you upload that recording?

1001
00:53:36,668 --> 00:53:37,917
Was it all you?

1002
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,376
I trusted you!

1003
00:53:39,459 --> 00:53:40,875
How could you do this to us?

1004
00:53:40,959 --> 00:53:42,709
I... - Calm down.

1005
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:44,626
Gosh. - My goodness.

1006
00:53:44,709 --> 00:53:47,292
You even got a columbarium niche for her.

1007
00:53:47,626 --> 00:53:50,917
Are you her mother or what?

1008
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:52,959
Let me see.

1009
00:53:53,501 --> 00:53:55,833
This isn't Min Seol A.

1010
00:53:57,626 --> 00:53:59,125
Who is this girl?

1011
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,042
She's my daughter.

1012
00:54:04,875 --> 00:54:05,917
What?

1013
00:54:06,709 --> 00:54:08,833
My daughter died recently.

1014
00:54:16,875 --> 00:54:18,542
Gosh. - Say something.

1015
00:54:19,209 --> 00:54:20,376
Well...

1016
00:54:20,459 --> 00:54:21,709
You see, we were just...

1017
00:54:22,542 --> 00:54:23,750
Gosh. - Are you okay?

1018
00:54:24,417 --> 00:54:26,750
Ma Ri, what's the matter with you?

1019
00:54:27,334 --> 00:54:28,542
Goodness.

1020
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:30,292
Just be quiet.

1021
00:54:36,125 --> 00:54:37,334
What did you just say?

1022
00:54:38,501 --> 00:54:39,501
"An affair"?

1023
00:54:39,584 --> 00:54:41,501
Yes, the lady in that photo asked me

1024
00:54:41,584 --> 00:54:43,459
to find out about her husband's affair.

1025
00:54:43,542 --> 00:54:44,750
She thought her husband

1026
00:54:44,833 --> 00:54:45,833
was cheating on her.

1027
00:54:46,292 --> 00:54:47,750
Look, I really cannot disclose

1028
00:54:47,833 --> 00:54:50,668
personal information like this.

1029
00:54:52,792 --> 00:54:55,292
That was really it. Please believe me.

1030
00:54:57,813 --> 00:54:59,549
"JKING Holdings"

1031
00:55:01,209 --> 00:55:02,584
If this man comes here,

1032
00:55:02,668 --> 00:55:04,417
tell him I suspected that my husband

1033
00:55:04,442 --> 00:55:05,726
was cheating on me.

1034
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:09,522
"JKING Holdings"

1035
00:55:19,275 --> 00:55:20,275
And?

1036
00:55:20,875 --> 00:55:21,822
Did you find anything?

1037
00:55:21,847 --> 00:55:22,888
No.

1038
00:55:23,334 --> 00:55:24,584
I tried but gave up.

1039
00:55:24,917 --> 00:55:25,808
He's not the type

1040
00:55:25,833 --> 00:55:27,311
to leave behind evidence.

1041
00:55:27,709 --> 00:55:29,792
I kept digging but found nothing.

1042
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:36,459
I can't believe Chairman Joo.

1043
00:55:36,917 --> 00:55:38,100
How could he hide

1044
00:55:38,125 --> 00:55:39,351
his ill daughter in the hospital

1045
00:55:39,376 --> 00:55:40,459
all this time?

1046
00:55:40,601 --> 00:55:42,601
That's what I'm saying. My gosh.

1047
00:55:42,626 --> 00:55:45,042
You must've been heartbroken, Soo Ryeon.

1048
00:55:45,125 --> 00:55:46,792
Even I'm so upset.

1049
00:55:47,626 --> 00:55:49,647
You always said you were busy.

1050
00:55:49,672 --> 00:55:51,975
Was that all because of your daughter?

1051
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,167
I'm sorry

1052
00:55:53,501 --> 00:55:54,559
for not telling you.

1053
00:55:54,584 --> 00:55:56,709
Gosh, why are you sorry?

1054
00:55:56,750 --> 00:55:57,934
The jerk who told you to hide it

1055
00:55:57,959 --> 00:55:59,184
is the one to blame.

1056
00:55:59,209 --> 00:56:02,167
I did hear about Seol A's suicide.

1057
00:56:02,959 --> 00:56:05,224
But I was preoccupied with my daughter

1058
00:56:05,833 --> 00:56:07,808
because she was so ill.

1059
00:56:07,833 --> 00:56:09,725
It must've been so hard for you.

1060
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:11,643
Think of me as your big sister.

1061
00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:12,850
You can rely on me from now on.

1062
00:56:12,875 --> 00:56:14,972
We've known each other for years.

1063
00:56:15,959 --> 00:56:20,152
Was she born out of wedlock?

1064
00:56:23,042 --> 00:56:24,434
I mean, why else would Chairman Joo

1065
00:56:24,459 --> 00:56:26,792
try so hard to hide her?

1066
00:56:27,626 --> 00:56:29,125
Am I wrong? - Ms Cheon.

1067
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:31,417
What on earth are you talking about?

1068
00:56:31,584 --> 00:56:32,750
How could you say such a thing

1069
00:56:32,833 --> 00:56:34,542
knowing she lost her child?

1070
00:56:42,792 --> 00:56:43,875
There you are.

1071
00:56:44,584 --> 00:56:46,236
Why didn't you answer my calls?

1072
00:56:58,363 --> 00:56:59,488
Let's go.

1073
00:57:14,833 --> 00:57:15,875
I'm sorry.

1074
00:57:17,542 --> 00:57:19,267
They followed me to the columbarium,

1075
00:57:19,292 --> 00:57:20,852
so I had no choice.

1076
00:57:21,833 --> 00:57:23,298
We already lost her,

1077
00:57:23,668 --> 00:57:25,896
so I wanted to keep it a secret forever.

1078
00:57:26,292 --> 00:57:28,534
They should apologise for following you.

1079
00:57:29,501 --> 00:57:31,059
Anyway, take this as an opportunity

1080
00:57:31,084 --> 00:57:33,292
to befriend the ladies at Hera Club.

1081
00:57:35,792 --> 00:57:36,808
I don't care about what happened,

1082
00:57:36,833 --> 00:57:38,394
so don't worry.

1083
00:58:01,084 --> 00:58:02,540
Where are you now?

1084
00:58:03,167 --> 00:58:04,601
I think my husband is on to something.

1085
00:58:04,626 --> 00:58:06,487
You should leave immediately.

1086
00:58:06,709 --> 00:58:08,688
Take the first flight-- - I already

1087
00:58:09,209 --> 00:58:10,709
packed up. I'm actually

1088
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:12,309
headed to the airport now.

1089
00:58:12,334 --> 00:58:13,501
I'm relieved.

1090
00:58:14,376 --> 00:58:15,850
Make sure you call me when you arrive.

1091
00:58:15,875 --> 00:58:19,376
No, our deal ends here.

1092
00:58:20,293 --> 00:58:23,376
You will never hear from me again.

1093
00:58:25,917 --> 00:58:28,668
Take good care of yourself.

1094
00:58:29,167 --> 00:58:30,722
Thank you for everything,

1095
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,209
Mr Yoon.

1096
00:58:42,774 --> 00:58:43,816
Chairman Joo.

1097
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:47,917
This is my final act of loyalty.

1098
00:59:04,536 --> 00:59:06,786
"2 months later"

1099
00:59:14,167 --> 00:59:15,250
What is this?

1100
00:59:26,626 --> 00:59:27,601
This phone

1101
00:59:27,626 --> 00:59:29,084
was inside the air handling unit.

1102
00:59:29,376 --> 00:59:30,334
I see.

1103
00:59:31,292 --> 00:59:32,250
Who is this?

1104
00:59:33,042 --> 00:59:34,292
She doesn't live here.

1105
00:59:34,959 --> 00:59:36,084
I'm sure she'll come back for it.

1106
01:00:04,584 --> 01:00:06,959
Seok Kyung, your cold got worse.

1107
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:08,725
The admission ceremony is tomorrow,

1108
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:10,725
but you can't perform solo like this.

1109
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:12,273
You should go see a doctor.

1110
01:00:12,668 --> 01:00:14,100
I don't think Seok Kyung

1111
01:00:14,125 --> 01:00:15,586
can perform tomorrow.

1112
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,643
I know you practised really hard,

1113
01:00:18,668 --> 01:00:19,892
but what can you do?

1114
01:00:19,917 --> 01:00:21,476
We can't ruin this important performance

1115
01:00:21,501 --> 01:00:22,949
because of you.

1116
01:00:25,417 --> 01:00:26,975
We need someone to sing

1117
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,643
Seok Kyung's solo part instead of her,

1118
01:00:28,668 --> 01:00:30,363
but we don't have much time.

1119
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:32,396
Any volunteers?

1120
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:34,565
I'll give it a try.

1121
01:00:35,833 --> 01:00:36,833
Really?

1122
01:00:37,209 --> 01:00:38,392
Are you confident?

1123
01:00:38,417 --> 01:00:40,142
Yes, I'll give it a shot.

1124
01:00:40,167 --> 01:00:42,601
Then Eun Byeol will do the solo part--

1125
01:00:42,626 --> 01:00:43,885
I'd also like

1126
01:00:44,833 --> 01:00:46,134
to give it a try.

1127
01:00:52,997 --> 01:00:54,636
Ro Na, have you lost your mind?

1128
01:00:55,376 --> 01:00:57,876
Know your place. How dare you.

1129
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:01,971
All right.

1130
01:01:02,626 --> 01:01:04,601
Then why don't we listen to both of you

1131
01:01:04,626 --> 01:01:06,992
and go with the one who's better?

1132
01:01:08,584 --> 01:01:09,986
Who wants to go first?

1133
01:01:49,542 --> 01:01:51,184
I enjoyed both of your performances.

1134
01:01:51,209 --> 01:01:52,892
Now, here's my decision.

1135
01:01:52,917 --> 01:01:54,000
This song...

1136
01:01:57,209 --> 01:01:58,892
was better performed by Ro Na

1137
01:01:58,917 --> 01:02:00,332
in all aspects.

1138
01:02:01,084 --> 01:02:02,142
Ro Na.

1139
01:02:02,167 --> 01:02:04,501
You will perform solo tomorrow.

1140
01:02:05,376 --> 01:02:06,668
Thank you, Ms Cheon.

1141
01:02:06,917 --> 01:02:08,417
I'll do my very best.

1142
01:02:13,042 --> 01:02:15,184
The performance has to be perfect.

1143
01:02:15,209 --> 01:02:16,863
You can do a good job, right?

1144
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:18,087
Yes.

1145
01:02:19,584 --> 01:02:20,750
Don't let me down.

1146
01:02:29,292 --> 01:02:30,850
I borrowed it at the last minute,

1147
01:02:30,875 --> 01:02:32,351
but it fits you perfectly.

1148
01:02:32,376 --> 01:02:34,137
My princess, you look stunning.

1149
01:02:34,162 --> 01:02:35,537
I can't believe

1150
01:02:36,084 --> 01:02:38,517
I'm performing at the admission ceremony.

1151
01:02:38,542 --> 01:02:40,601
Mum, this isn't a dream, right?

1152
01:02:40,626 --> 01:02:41,892
I heard many famous vocalists

1153
01:02:41,917 --> 01:02:43,288
will be there.

1154
01:02:43,792 --> 01:02:44,975
I'll do a fantastic job.

1155
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,559
Just like you, Mum.

1156
01:02:46,584 --> 01:02:47,934
Watch, I'll teach those kids a lesson

1157
01:02:47,959 --> 01:02:48,975
for making fun of me

1158
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,309
that I was on the waiting list.

1159
01:02:50,334 --> 01:02:52,725
Okay. I'm so proud of you, my princess.

1160
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:55,417
Thanks to you, I get to smile like this.

1161
01:02:55,887 --> 01:02:56,970
Thank you.

1162
01:02:57,459 --> 01:03:00,125
Mum, you look so downcast these days.

1163
01:03:00,697 --> 01:03:02,175
Is something bothering you?

1164
01:03:02,709 --> 01:03:03,892
No.

1165
01:03:03,917 --> 01:03:05,592
Not at all.

1166
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,601
Let's hurry. - Okay.

1167
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:17,978
Are you ready?

1168
01:03:18,209 --> 01:03:19,725
We're almost there.

1169
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:20,792

Okay.

All right, thanks.

Get ready, Eun Byeol.

1178
01:04:11,750 --> 01:04:13,750
This was supposed to be your stage.

Ro Na, are you all right?

1183
01:04:40,917 --> 01:04:43,125
Hey, Ro Na. Let me see.

1184
01:04:44,376 --> 01:04:46,167
Let me take you to the hospital.

1185
01:04:49,334 --> 01:04:51,750
No, Mum. I'm okay.

1186
01:04:51,917 --> 01:04:53,167
I have to perform.

1187
01:04:53,417 --> 01:04:54,959
Ro Na, you're badly injured.

1188
01:04:55,042 --> 01:04:56,542
You need to see a doctor first.

1189
01:04:56,750 --> 01:04:59,042
I said I'm fine!

1190

Hurry. I need to go to school.

1191

I can't be late. Hurry, Mum.

1192
01:05:11,709 --> 01:05:13,417
What do I do?

1193
01:05:36,833 --> 01:05:38,750
Ro Na, hold on tight.

1194
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:57,000
We will now begin

1195

01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,167
You can't enter now.

1197
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:11,417
Get out of my way. I must perform.

1198
01:06:11,501 --> 01:06:13,125
The performance hasn't begun yet.

1199
01:06:13,209 --> 01:06:14,351
You cannot go in.

1200
01:06:14,376 --> 01:06:16,042
I'm singing the solo part.

1201
01:06:16,417 --> 01:06:17,542
I must go in!

1202
01:06:17,567 --> 01:06:19,084
I said, you can't go in!

1203
01:06:33,626 --> 01:06:35,000
Gosh, please!

1204
01:06:35,125 --> 01:06:37,875
I must go in. Let me in!

1205
01:06:38,292 --> 01:06:41,626
Hey! Why can't you let her in?

1206
01:06:41,709 --> 01:06:43,167
Gosh, back off!

1207
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:45,875
You! - Ouch!

1208
01:06:47,125 --> 01:06:48,497
Are you all right? - Let's go.

1209
01:06:48,522 --> 01:06:49,772
Get them!

1210
01:06:51,542 --> 01:06:52,875
Gosh! - Stop!

1211
01:06:54,641 --> 01:06:56,016
Get off me!

1212
01:06:56,041 --> 01:06:57,749
Hey, let her go!

1213
01:06:58,250 --> 01:06:59,334
Ro Na, go!

1214
01:07:06,917 --> 01:07:09,026
Mum. - Ro Na, just go!

1215
01:07:12,875 --> 01:07:14,009
Go away!

1216
01:07:37,861 --> 01:07:39,445
Hey, are you okay?

1217
01:08:23,917 --> 01:08:26,626
=Penthouse=

1218
01:08:27,031 --> 01:08:28,033
Sim Soo Ryeon.

1219
01:08:28,058 --> 01:08:30,392
What on earth are you thinking?

1220
01:08:30,417 --> 01:08:31,845
That was my first time hearing

1221
01:08:31,870 --> 01:08:33,017
"I love you".

1222
01:08:33,042 --> 01:08:34,267
Oh Yoon Hee moved

1223
01:08:34,292 --> 01:08:35,684
to Min Seol A's place?

1224
01:08:35,709 --> 01:08:37,643
She has something to do with Min Seol A.

1225
01:08:37,668 --> 01:08:39,434
Did she die because you guys bullied her?

1226
01:08:39,459 --> 01:08:41,225
Do you want me to die like she did?

1227
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:43,142
Protect your child at all costs.

1228
01:08:43,167 --> 01:08:45,559
Did you kill Min Seol A?

1229
01:08:45,584 --> 01:08:46,892
I want to live here too.

1230
01:08:46,917 --> 01:08:48,184
A place like Hera Palace.

1231
01:08:48,209 --> 01:08:50,142
I will do whatever it takes to make sure

1232
01:08:50,167 --> 01:08:52,247
you get to live here one day.
