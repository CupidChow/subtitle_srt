00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,439
Hello, everyone.

2
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,479
Welcome to the press conference...

3
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,480
of "Magpie Bridge".

4
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,718
"Magpie Bridge" is a film...

5
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:47,120
based on ancient Chinese folklore.

6
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,040
It's a fusion of opera and reality.

7
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,839
We also have a popular actress...

8
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,318
as our female lead.

9
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:57,078
Next, let's give her a big round of applause.

10
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:58,120
Ms. Han Hui.

11
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,000
("Magpie Bridge" Launching Ceremony)

12
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,039
Before you ask any questions,

13
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,119
I have one more announcement to make.

14
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,560
Today is not just the press conference of "Magpie Bridge".

15
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:16,918
But it's also the day we're signing a contract...

16
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:18,530
with the internationally renowned film star, Ms. Han Hui.

17
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:24,638
All right.

18
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:26,598
We'll take questions from the media one by one.

19
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:28,879
We won't hold back any answers.

20
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:35,638
You, please.

21
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:36,639
Ms. Han Hui.

22
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,639
Why did you choose Aurora Film?

23
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,809
As an actress,

24
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,089
choosing which company to sign with is very simple.

25
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,360
Firstly, I look at professionalism.

26
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:47,680
I'll see if the company pays attention to their production.

27
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,999
Secondly, I'll see...

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,399
whether they employ people based on merit...

29
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,120
rather than nepotism.

30
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,519
I'm confident in "Magpie Bridge".

31
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,840
"Magpie Bridge" is a big challenge for me too.

32
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,439
I thank Mr. Jiang for inviting me to join.

33
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,840
Ms. Han Hui.

34
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,559
When you say nepotism,

35
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,599
are you referring to Wen Xiao Nuan, the female lead of "Blue Galaxy"?

36
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:07,400
I didn't mean that.

37
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,599
But to each his own.

38
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,159
Everyone has their own interpretation.

39
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:13,598
"Blue Galaxy" and "Magpie Bridge" have the same theme.

40
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,758
Why is it announced after "Blue Galaxy"?

41
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:17,159
Are you going to compete with Anning?

42
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:19,360
Is Aurora Film not afraid of losing the lead?

43
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:22,359
Personally,

44
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,360
I don't like to compare myself to others.

45
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,479
I'm very confident in "Magpie Bridge".

46
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,280
I hope Wen Xiao Nuan...

47
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:29,840
doesn't feel too pressured...

48
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,000
and can put all her energy into her performance.

49
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,960
Okay, our launching ceremony will begin.

50
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:48,280
Three, two, one, go.

51
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,438
("Magpie Bridge", Han Hui's first film after returning from abroad)

(They also revealed her new look in the period costume.)

59
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:46,199
Director, we still have to adjust today's schedule.

60
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,279
Wen Xiao Nuan is needed in these scenes.

61
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,959
No need to adjust. I'm back.

62
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:57,279
- Xiao Nuan. - Xiao Nuan is back.

63

- Xiao Nuan. - Xiao Nuan.

64
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,759
Why are you out of the hospital?

65
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:05,079
Director, I'm fine now.

66
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,480
Look.

67
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,439
Okay.

68

- Okay. - Okay.

72
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,800
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,759
I delayed the shoot.

74
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:21,360
I'll do my best to catch up.

75
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,120
Welcome back, Xiao Nuan.

76
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,360
We're finally filming together.

77
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,600
I've been looking forward to it.

78
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,120
Please take good care of me.

79
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,279
Let's do our best.

80
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Xiao Nuan.

81
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:45,879
Here's a fan.

82
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,920
Thank you.

83
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,639
I have coffee here.

84
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,560
Thank you.

85
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:53,839
Xiao Nuan.

86
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,560
Your acting was really good.

87
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,319
I almost cried watching you.

88
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:59,639
That's not true. You led the scene well.

89
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,480
I'm really happy to work with you.

90
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,879
Then...

91
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,399
who do you like more?

92
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,560
Me or Fei Mo?

93
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:14,720
Who would like that big iceberg?

94
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,439
So you don't like him.

95
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,639
Come with me after the shoot is done then.

96
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,920
I'll tell him now.

97
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,999
- Hello? - No, don't tell him.

98
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,639
Xiao Nuan has agreed to come with me.

99
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,240
- You went to the hospital? - I didn't tell him...

100
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,040
I didn't go to the hospital.

101
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,680
I'm on set.

102
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:34,919
Xiao Nuan is on set too.

103
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,439
I didn't tell him I was here.

104
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,560
Wen Xiao Nuan is filming?

105
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,560
Looks like she really doesn't like you.

106
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:42,279
She didn't even tell you her schedule.

107
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:44,120
All right, you two. Let's start filming.

108
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,839
- Coming. - Fei Mo, we're going to work.

109
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,920
Bye.

110
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,720
She's acting tough again.

111
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:58,920
These documents need your approval.

112
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,399
You take care of them. I have something to do.

113
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,000
Are you going to the hospital again?

114
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,000
I've been working overtime to get the work done for you.

115
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,720
As a vice president, I've become the CEO's special assistant.

116
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:09,000
Look at my dark circles.

117
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,639
Keep up the good work.

118
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:13,800
You...

119
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,319
Cut.

120
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,040
Cook a pot of fish soup for my sister.

121
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:04,480
It's delicious.

122
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,319
Xiao Nuan.

123
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,600
Xiao Nuan, you're off work.

124
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,600
How's your injury?

125
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:15,318
I made you fish soup. It's really fresh.

126
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:16,438
Come and try it.

127
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,758
Fish soup is a heaty food.

128
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,160
It's not good for recovery.

129
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,399
I wonder if you're heartless or just dumb.

130
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,119
I made the fish soup for my sister.

131
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,559
What does it have to do with you?

132
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,120
Xiao Kai, don't be rude.

133
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,600
Okay, superstar.

134
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,359
You've brought my sister home.

135
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,639
Your mission is accomplished.

136
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,878
Goodbye. I won't see you out.

137
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,000
The exit is to your left after the door.

138
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,600
Xiao Bai is a guest.

139
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,450
Come on, Xiao Bai. Let's go inside.

140
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,519
I didn't prepare his share of fish soup.

141
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,600
Xiao Nuan, you're still injured.

142
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,840
You shouldn't go to work anymore.

143
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,279
The crew is fine with it.

144
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,480
What's important is your health.

145
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,279
I'm fine.

146
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,559
Director Li told us today...

147
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:56,000
that we've done more than our expected tasks.

148
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,479
It's because I delayed the shoot.

149
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,639
Since I'm fine now, I should make up for it.

150
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,210
You're so dedicated.

151
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,279
You're so fake.

152
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,240
Xiao Kai.

153
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,210
Get Xiao Bai a glass of water.

154
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,450
It's okay. He's not thirsty.

155
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,240
It's okay, Xiao Nuan.

156
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,159
- I'm not thirsty. - See?

157
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,559
Xiao Kai, hurry up.

158
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,759
What are you getting? I'll help you.

159
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,239
Since the brother doesn't want to do it,

160
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,600
the sister has to do it for him.

161
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:27,999
You're doing this again.

162
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,039
Fine, I'll get it.

163
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:30,679
You win.

164
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,719
Xiao Bai, I'm sorry.

165
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,360
That's how Xiao Kai is.

166
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:36,480
It's okay. Your brother...

167
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,600
is quite cute.

168
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:44,720
Xiao Nuan.

169
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,480
You need to put some ice on your bruise.

170
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,519
What's-his-name.

171
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,039
Bring me an ice pack.

172
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,840
- Who are you calling? - You.

173
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,279
Superstar.

174
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,090
Be careful not to choke to death.

175
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:01,559
Xiao Kai.

176
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:05,879
Why are you so rude?

177
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,279
Here, Xiao Nuan. Let me help you.

178
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,450
No need.

179
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:09,519
There's no need.

180
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,159
What are you doing? Get up.

181
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:13,720
- Open the door. - Open the door.

182
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:15,450
- Hurry up. - He's nearer.

183
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,330
Fine. It's always me.

184
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,960
Fei Mo!

185
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,399
You're finally here, Fei Mo.

186
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:26,679
Mo Xiao Bai has gone too far.

187
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,399
Don't worry, I'll help you.

188
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,039
Fei Mo, why are you here?

189
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,559
Fei Mo.

190
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:42,639
Why did you get physical?

191
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:45,000
I've given you a warning.

192
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:46,799
I won't repeat myself.

193
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,639
We'll become a family sooner or later.

194
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,799
Isn't it good to take her around now?

195
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,519
Mind your own business.

196
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:55,600
What's with you?

197
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:56,960
I'm going to tell Aunt on you.

198
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,200
Go now. Close the door behind you.

199
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,839
Fine, I'm going.

200
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,039
Yes, go now. Close the door behind you.

201
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:06,320
I'm not going anymore.

202
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,320
It's comfortable staying by Xiao Nuan's side.

203
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,919
Who said you could be comfortable?

204
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:13,959
If you're comfortable, I'm not.

205
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,999
I don't care if you're comfortable.

206
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,479
No, why should you be comfortable?

207
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,759
- I'm staying here today. - Why are you staying here?

208
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:19,159
All right.

209
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,399
So noisy.

210
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,559
Let's go inside.

211
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,960
Yes, Fei Mo. It's comfortable inside.

212
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,399
This place is not good for resting.

213
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:30,720
So noisy.

214
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,679
Childish.

215
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,119
They are my sister and brother-in-law.

216
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,559
Why are you listening?

217
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,200
They are...

218
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:52,120
my cousin and cousin-in-law.

219
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:53,360
Why are you listening?

220
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:54,600
Get out of the way.

221
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:00,440
Here.

222
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,200
Slowly.

223
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,919
Does it hurt?

224
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:13,919
No.

225
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,480
Listen.

226
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:19,960
If you continue to act tough,

227
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,600
I'll get you replaced.

228
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,840
I've almost recovered.

229
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,080
Can you stop making me worry?

230
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:41,080
Ye Fei Mo.

231
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,480
When was...

232
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:46,080
the proudest moment in your life?

233
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:51,639
I don't have one yet.

234
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,000
Then do you know...

235
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,279
when my proudest moment was?

236
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,840
When was it?

237
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,159
It's right now.

238
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,600
I get to work with such a professional crew,

239
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,080
actors, and director.

240
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,240
I feel so proud...

241
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:21,960
to have their trust.

242
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:25,639
So compared to that,

243
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:27,960
this injury is nothing.

244
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:31,240
I really want to act for this film.

245
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:41,320
So Ye Fei Mo...

246
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,480
can you just let me continue acting?

247
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,720
He finally got the hang of it.

248
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,039
Fei Mo has finally found his love.

249
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,879
My sister is so lucky...

250
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,240
to have found such a good man.

251
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:07,960
Of course.

252
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,720
Although Fei Mo is a bit slow when it comes to love,

253
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,519
he has excellent character.

254
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:13,919
What's wrong with my sister?

255
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,159
She's not bad either.

256
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:16,679
She's beautiful.

257
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:19,599
- My sister... - That's my sister. Not yours.

258
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,639
My sister is my sister.

259
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:35,960
What are you doing?

260
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,240
If I said...

261
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,720
that we were practicing dancing, would you believe me?

262
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,360
Fei Mo, is my sister asleep?

263
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,399
Is her injury serious?

264
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,960
Fei Mo, I might go back to my hometown tomorrow.

265
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,200
To the fishing village.

266
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:25,360
I'm counting on you to take care of my sister.

267
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,039
My sister...

268
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,200
has a bad temper.

269
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,879
Please bear with her.

270
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,480
Thanks.

271
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,440
Fei Mo.

272
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,759
You must take good care of Xiao Nuan.

273
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,759
Otherwise, Aunt and I won't let you off.

274
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:41,240
Both of you...

275
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,558
are just as nagging, unreliable,

276
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:44,639
and gossipy.

277
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,519
What a perfect match.

278
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:48,480
- I'm different from him. - No way.

279
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:49,799
Stop kidding me, Fei Mo.

280
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,080
This place is nice.

281
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:12,439
Hello. What would you like to drink?

282
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,440
Nothing.

283
00:16:13,441 --> 00:16:14,840
You can't sit here if you're not ordering.

284
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,600
Didn't you hear me say no? Get lost.

285
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:21,319
Mr. Xu is such a primp.

286
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,759
He picked such an elegant place.

287
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:26,279
Why isn't he here yet? It's so hot.

288
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,639
Mr. Xu, you're here.

289
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:37,919
This guy.

290
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,320
Remember his face.

291
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,840
Okay.

292
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,360
He's in the area now.

293
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,879
Have you figured out what to do?

294
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:51,879
We'll handle it. Don't worry.

295
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:54,840
Let's go.

296
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:17,650
Go.

297
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,359
Go on. Don't you want the money?

298
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,200
Gu Yun Zhou, how does it taste?

299
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,559
Your pretty face has been ruined.

300
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,960
Yun Zhou!

301
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,039
Jia Yi.

302
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:05,410
Go after them!

303
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,319
Just you wait.

304
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,559
Ms. Wang Jia Yi.

305
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:34,000
I'm impressed.

306
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,720
Mr. Gu Yun Zhou, don't be afraid.

307
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:38,359
I'll protect you from now on.

308
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,239
Let's talk about the online and offline promotion.

309
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,079
There are also posters to go with them.

310
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,680
Jiang Fang.

311
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,680
Jiang Fang, I have an idea.

312
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,318
When we're preparing for the wedding,

313
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:22,319
we can do a livestream.

314
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,240
- A livestream? - Yes.

315
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,000
It's good publicity for the company.

316
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:27,890
It can also increase the interest in the project.

317
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:29,649
But the promotional plan for "Magpie Bridge"...

318
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:30,679
has just been submitted.

319
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,359
If we add a livestream at the last minute,

320
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,559
the flow of the promotion might be disrupted.

321
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,119
What's wrong with that?

322
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,319
It's better to promote through multiple channels.

323
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,078
The core of the promotion is the film,

324
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:42,279
not us.

325
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:45,890
Our wedding and the film.

326
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:48,170
Your life is on the right track now.

327
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:50,199
We'll let everyone know that we're getting married.

328
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,240
Isn't that good?

329
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:55,799
Are you afraid that my brother won't agree?

330
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,798
I'll talk to him. I'm sure he'll agree.

331
00:20:58,799 --> 00:20:59,890
There's no need.

332
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,480
I promise you.

333
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:02,839
I'll do it.

334
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:09,440
Let's pick the ring first, then the wedding dress.

335
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:11,119
Then we can prepare for the wedding.

336
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,720
All right, we'll do as you say.

337
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,278
Xiao Nuan, are you tired?

338
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:25,279
No.

339
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,890
It's almost the end of the shoot.

340
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,119
It's a little hard to let go.

341
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,119
We're shooting the wedding scene today.

342
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:38,680
You'll be even sadder when it's over.

343
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,960
Why?

344
00:21:39,961 --> 00:21:41,599
You're marrying Mo Xiao Bai.

345
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,599
It's a dream come true for so many girls.

346
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:45,359
Look.

347
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,650
Look, Xiao Nuan.

348
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:49,598
Who wouldn't want to get married...

349
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:50,880
in such a beautiful dress?

350
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:34,319
Speaking of getting married,

351
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,239
the way a rich heiress prepares for her wedding is indeed different.

352
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,559
It's being streamed online.

353
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:40,039
Which rich heiress?

354
00:22:40,279 --> 00:22:41,640
The heiress of Aurora Film...

355
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:43,279
and the company's executive, Jiang Fang.

356
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:47,920
(Jiang Fang and Jiang Ling Er, soon to be wed)

357
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,239
A rose wall and a garden wedding.

358
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,639
That's so extravagant.

359
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,640
It's fake.

360
00:22:58,641 --> 00:23:00,319
No one gets married like that in real life.

361
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,359
Actually, a wedding is just a ceremony.

362
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:05,759
The most important thing is the couple's marriage.

363
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,559
You're all I need for my wedding.

364
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:10,440
Silly girl.

365
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:16,279
Xiao Nuan, don't worry.

366
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,039
With your looks,

367
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:20,920
you'll be the most beautiful bride in the world.

368
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:23,160
No, the whole universe.

369
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:37,160
What are you looking at?

370
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:39,400
Aurora Film's heiress is getting married.

371
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,559
It's the hottest topic today.

372
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:42,839
Look.

373
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,960
(Jiang Fang and Jiang Ling Er, soon to be wed)

374
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,639
My goodness.

375
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,199
This is so crazy.

376
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,240
I know, right?

377
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:06,680
(Ye Fei Mo)

378
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,159
Fei Mo, the shoot will be wrapping today.

379
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,480
I'm getting married to Xiao Nuan.

380
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:18,680
What do you think? Am I handsome?

381
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:23,359
- Have some water. - Thank you.

382
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,039
Why aren't you replying?

383
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,920
Are you jealous?

384
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,200
Xiao Nuan is here.

385
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,679
She looks so pretty.

386
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,359
The dress is so pretty.

387
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,200
So beautiful.

388
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:17,480
Xiao Nuan.

389
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:18,640
You look so pretty today.

390
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:21,200
Do I?

391
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,200
She and Mo Xiao Bai are a good match.

392
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,640
Are you looking for your Mr. Right?

393
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:31,160
Don't be ridiculous.

394
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,279
Fei Mo must be jealous that we're getting married today,

395
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:38,039
so he didn't come on purpose.

396
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,880
It's okay. He's always been petty like that.

397
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,960
Xiao Nuan.

398
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,240
Director.

399
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:48,519
You're beautiful.

400
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,720
We're shooting the last scene of "Blue Galaxy" today.

401
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:53,880
I'll do my best.

402
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
- Let's go. - Let's go.

403
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:02,640
- Let's go. - Let's go.

404
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,319
What is love?

405
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,519
Holding hands...

406
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:15,319
and growing old together?

407
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,000
Or...

408
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,200
A love can last and stand the test of time...

409
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,160
that there's no need to stay together every day.

410
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,960
To me,

411
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:39,279
love is the most beautiful thing.

412
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:44,000
It has nothing to do with being human or immortal.

413
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,960
It has nothing to do with time.

414
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:51,200
It has nothing to do with material things.

415
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,599
It has nothing to do with experience.

416
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,160
As long as two hearts are together,

417
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,680
they can overcome anything.

418
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,519
Whether it's sweet, sour, bitter, or spicy,

419
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,720
it's all happiness.

420
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:58,599
First, bow to heaven and earth.

421
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,960
Second, bow to your parents.

422
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,799
Husband and wife, bow to each other.

423
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,759
Cut.

424
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:26,919
It's a wrap!

425
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,239
- Great! - Great!

426
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,039
- Good job. - Thank you.

427
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,440
Good job.

428
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:40,359
Congratulations.

429
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:42,519
You did it.

430
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,759
You're right.

431
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,400
Wen Xiao Nuan will be successful.

432
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:02,519
Let's congratulate "Blue Galaxy" on a successful wrap.

433
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,839
Let's take a photo.

434
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,519
Director.

435
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:09,680
- Let's go. - Come here.

436
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,798
Let's have the director stand between us.

437
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:12,960
- Here. - Come.

438
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,319
Director, stand in the middle.

439
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:20,359
One, two, three.

440
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,440
Jump!

441
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,558
One more.

442
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:33,839
Hurry.
