1
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,079
What are you doing?

2
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,359
Gu Yun Zhou, why did you bring me here?

3
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,079
I've never brought anyone here before.

4
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:49,640
You're the first.

5
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:53,640
This is my secret garden.

6
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:54,959
Jia Yi.

7
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,519
I admit.

8
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,560
I'm not a poor guy who's working part-time.

9
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,599
I've lived a privileged life since I was young.

10
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,519
But...

11
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,280
the responsibilities I have and the pressure I face...

12
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,199
are not what ordinary people can imagine.

13
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:11,759
So...

14
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,530
I'd come here on my own...

15
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,038
to clear my mind.

16
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:16,090
I don't have to think about anything.

17
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,000
Just like when I was a kid.

18
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,439
Jia Yi.

19
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,120
The reason I brought you here...

20
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,960
is because I wanted to show you...

21
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,960
the most real, direct, and pure side of my heart...

22
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:32,400
without anything holding me back.

23
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,680
Why didn't you tell me before?

24
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:36,840
Before this,

25
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,319
I've always wanted to be honest with you.

26
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,919
But I was afraid you wouldn't accept me.

27
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:43,680
So...

28
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:51,759
Jia Yi.

29
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,719
Be with me.

30
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,879
From the moment I first saw you,

31
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,280
I couldn't get you out of my head.

32
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,240
I'm always laughing and joking around.

33
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:04,000
But since I met you,

34
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,120
you made me understand...

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,080
what it means to be serious...

36
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:10,280
and what it means to care.

37
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,000
And I'm even more certain...

38
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,599
that you're the one I've been waiting for.

39
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,439
Let's be together.

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,039
Okay?

41
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:23,639
Gu Yun Zhou, I...

42
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,879
Stop being willful.

43
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,719
I mean...

44
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:47,479
we're not kids anymore.

45
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,520
We have to be responsible for our own actions.

46
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,280
I know.

47
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,840
We may not be the best match.

48
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,800
But compared to the arguments in the future,

49
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,318
what I care about more now...

50
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:03,000
is to be happy every day.

51
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,240
So...

52
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,960
are you saying yes?

53
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:12,959
I guess so.

54
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,000
Really?

55
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,159
Yes.

56
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:37,560
You fainted due to low blood sugar.

57
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,920
Your body is too weak.

58
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,050
Drink it.

59
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,050
Why did you stop?

60
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:07,879
Why are you apologizing?

62
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,240
Because of me,

63
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:15,680
the male lead of "Blue Galaxy" quit.

64
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,560
Such a big investment...

65
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,319
might go down the drain just like that.

66
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,730
So that's why you're training so hard...

67
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,610
and torturing yourself.

68
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,199
Turns out you're so vulnerable.

69
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:37,040
Wen Xiao Nuan.

70
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:38,600
I overestimated you.

71
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,519
You were the one who swore to me...

72
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:44,120
that you'd do your best with your first female lead role...

73
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:46,480
and not let down those who have expectations of you...

74
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:49,319
nor your passion and effort.

75
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:52,079
I didn't expect you to break down...

76
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,680
over such a trivial matter.

77
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,839
I didn't.

78
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,360
Don't deny it.

79
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:59,119
You fainted in front of me.

80
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,160
I was the one who brought you back.

81
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,160
Do you know how scary that was?

82
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,399
Are you angry?

83
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,720
It's not like what you think.

84
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,360
It's because...

85
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,360
I didn't want to embarrass myself...

86
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:21,040
And I don't want to embarrass you.

87
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,279
That matter with the male lead...

88
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,560
has been resolved.

89
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,920
An international movie star...

90
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,920
has agreed to play the male lead.

91
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,680
International movie star? Who is it?

92
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,680
You don't need to know for now.

93
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:45,519
What you should do is leave all your worries behind...

94
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,560
and focus on taking care of yourself.

95
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,680
The male lead going on strike...

96
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,040
was not your fault.

97
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,600
They just chose the wrong person.

98
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,600
You told such a white lie for me...

99
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,560
and took on all the pressure on your own.

100
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,319
Rest assured.

101
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:08,439
I won't make you worry anymore.

102
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Thank you.

103
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:34,879
You're an S-class artist of Anning.

104
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,079
You're an important asset to the company.

105
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:39,319
No matter what happens,

106
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,120
you can't hurt yourself.

107
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:43,319
Do you understand?

108
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:48,800
All right, I have something to attend to.

109
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,360
Zhou Xiao Jing is downstairs.

110
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:51,680
She'll come up and take care of you.

111
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:53,319
Are you leaving?

112
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,360
I mean...

113
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,480
do you want to eat something before you go?

114
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,360
No.

115
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,240
Let's meet up.

116
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:38,120
I knew Mr. Ye still had you in his heart.

117
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,399
See? He took the initiative to ask you out.

118
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,159
Fei Mo.

119
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,000
Sit.

120
00:08:58,519 --> 00:08:59,678
The salad here is not bad.

121
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:00,840
I'll tell them to serve it.

122
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,919
I'll let you two talk.

123
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,039
Linda, order an Americano with an extra shot for Mr. Ye.

124
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,960
You used to only drink this.

125
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:10,090
People change.

126
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,960
I drink mocha now.

127
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,480
You called me.

128
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:27,799
I was really happy.

129
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,330
You've been back for so long.

130
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,960
It's about time we sat down and talked.

131
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:35,679
So many things happened abroad.

132
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:37,210
I want to tell you all about them.

133
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:39,210
Even three days and nights won't be enough.

134
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,759
Thank you.

135
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,959
In Hollywood, I honed my acting skills...

136
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,000
and expanded my network.

137
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,240
I also got up close with professional teams.

138
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:05,039
I could choose the opportunities that suit me better too.

139
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,039
I'm different now.

140
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,360
The person I am now...

141
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:10,519
don't leave a place...

142
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:12,279
just because someone tells me to.

143
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,519
Your acting has indeed gotten better.

144
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,090
And...

145
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:19,840
it's different.

146
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,330
Then...

147
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:29,759
Can we...

148
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,450
start over this time?

149
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:37,120
The one who needs to start over...

150
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,279
is you.

151
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:44,759
The male lead of "Blue Galaxy" is on strike.

152
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:46,240
You know about that, right?

153
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:50,039
I heard.

154
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:52,799
You asked me to come...

155
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,519
because of this?

156
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:57,320
I want to hear your opinion.

157
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,679
The male lead is on strike.

158
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,720
You're in a passive position now.

159
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,959
Wen Xiao Nuan is just a rookie.

160
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,519
She can't handle such a big role.

161
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,000
But don't worry.

162
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,799
If you need help,

163
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,639
I'm always available.

164
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:17,320
You're very good at accusing others...

165
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,279
when you're the wrongdoer yourself.

166
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:40,080
This is Jiang Ling Er.

167
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:43,679
I heard she's Jiang Fang's current girlfriend.

168
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,719
And Jiang Fang is Wen Xiao Nuan's ex-boyfriend.

169
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,840
So...

170
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,159
Keep scrolling.

171
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,279
Aurora Film is investing in a new movie...

172
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:07,159
with Wen Xiao Nuan as the female lead?

173
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:08,879
Who told you that?

174
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,840
Everyone knows.

175
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:12,999
Director Li Can kicked Bai Xiu Wen...

176
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,918
out of the set in front of everyone.

177
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:16,399
Are you talking about "Blue Galaxy"?

178
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:19,039
I thought you would become the female lead instead.

179
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,758
After all, in terms of looks and family background,

180
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:22,960
in every aspect,

181
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,799
you and her are worlds apart.

182
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,159
Why are you looking at me like that?

183
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,558
It's just girl gossip.

184
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:35,039
It doesn't mean anything.

185
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:37,919
Fei Mo.

186
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,000
I know you're anxious and angry right now.

187
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,159
So you're suspicious of this and that.

188
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:45,200
But of all, you shouldn't be suspicious of me.

189
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,038
I'll say it again.

190
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:48,279
I'm here if you need help.

191
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,960
You don't have to pay me.

192
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,879
I'm just here to give you a friendly warning.

193
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,639
You know the whole story best.

194
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,919
As for "Blue Galaxy",

195
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:03,320
I'm just a producer in name.

196
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:05,279
The actual project...

197
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,000
is under the sole responsibility of Ms. Cheng.

198
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,159
If you want to play the female lead,

199
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:11,960
you can talk to my mom directly.

200
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,759
That might work better.

201
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,200
Well? Any breakthroughs?

202
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:37,639
He knows Cheng An Ya has a problem with me,

203
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,440
but he still pushed me to her.

204
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,799
He's so cruel.

205
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:47,799
Okay.

206
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:55,679
Not bad.

207
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,600
It's quite comfortable.

208
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:01,320
Okay, I'll take this pair.

209
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:03,759
Let's see.

210
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:06,039
Any new arrivals?

211
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:08,480
This dress is this year's latest.

212
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,120
It'll look good on you.

213
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,720
It does look good.

214
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:19,959
But it's too girly.

215
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,398
It doesn't suit me.

216
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:24,759
(Cheng An Ya)

217
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:31,080
(Cheng An Ya)

218
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,000
Ms. Cheng, your phone is ringing.

219
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:34,519
Okay, thank you.

220
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:38,480
Who's calling me at this time?

221
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,399
They're distracting me from shopping.

222
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,240
(Han Hui)

223
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,799
Hello, Ms. Cheng. This is Han Hui.

224
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,320
I'd like to talk to you about "Blue Galaxy".

225
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,480
Are you interested in it?

226
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,320
When is a good time for you?

227
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,519
Let's meet and talk.

228
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:09,559
When is a good time?

229
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:14,480
Tomorrow night then.

230
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:16,039
The restaurant at GK Hotel.

231
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,759
Okay. See you there.

232
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:28,200
I'll take the dress.

233
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,720
I'll buy it for my daughter-in-law.

234
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:32,798
Okay, I'll wrap it up for you.

235
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:33,799
Okay, thank you.

236
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,080
Contact the stylist for me.

237
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:43,159
Tomorrow night,

238
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,559
I must win.

239
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,159
You're done?

240
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:56,679
Yes.

241
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:58,200
Do you still feel unwell?

242
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:02,240
Xiao Jing, I think I've almost recovered now.

243
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,120
I was too weak before this.

244
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:07,240
When anything happens in the future,

245
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:08,759
I'll get through it.

246
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:13,000
These few days have been tough on you.

247
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,039
Not at all.

248
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,200
As long as I can play my role in "Blue Galaxy" well.

249
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,799
Then rest well tonight.

250
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:26,039
Hello, Ms. Cheng.

251
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,840
Okay, I understand.

252
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,879
Good night, Ms. Cheng.

253
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:48,879
Xiao Nuan.

254
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:51,120
Tomorrow, come to the office early.

255
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,360
Continue your training.

256
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,480
At night,

257
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:55,559
you have a big battle to face.

258
00:16:58,759 --> 00:16:59,759
Okay, Xiao Jing.

259
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,840
No matter what it is, I'll make it through.

260
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:07,519
Relax.

261
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,599
Pay attention to your facial expression.

262
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:14,480
Open your shoulders.

263
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,359
Relax your arms.

264
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,000
Tuck in your chin.

265
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,799
Xiao Jing, what big battle am I going to take part in tonight?

266
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:30,680
Isn't this basic training?

267
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:31,799
It's a banquet.

268
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:52,170
Ms. Han.

269
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,240
This dress is our newest design.

270
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:56,720
It's a dress fit for a queen. Noble and elegant.

271
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:58,518
Not many people can pull off this style...

272
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:00,000
apart from you.

273
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:01,599
You're right.

274
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,559
This dress suits you so well.

275
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:09,200
- This one. - Okay.

276
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,240
Why? It's nowhere near as good as this one.

277
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:18,559
Of course I know this dress suits me better.

278
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,839
But I'm going to see Cheng An Ya.

279
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:23,890
That woman has always been tough.

280
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:26,319
I have to be weak at times like this...

281
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,519
to get what I want.

282
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,240
Dear.

283
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,838
Give her a good fix...

284
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:38,000
from head to toe, inside and out.

285
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:39,279
Understood.

286
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,039
Looks like our body training...

287
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,440
wasn't in vain.

288
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,960
Look at yourself.

289
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,559
Wasn't all that hard work worth it?

290
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:37,440
Ms. Han, you're absolutely beautiful.

291
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:41,119
So when doing my makeup,

292
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,519
tone down my beauty.

293
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:46,650
I'd like some softer charm.

294
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,559
Even better if you make me look pitiful.

295
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:52,679
Ms. Han, your features and skin are perfect for makeup.

296
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,200
You can pull off any look.

297
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:56,118
You're born to look like an international star.

298
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:57,359
Why should I tone down your beauty?

299
00:19:57,799 --> 00:19:58,890
I want to keep a low profile.

300
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,319
I don't want to intimidate others.

301
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:01,680
Okay, I got it.

302
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:06,759
Xiao Jing, where are we going?

303
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:08,890
GK Hotel's rooftop restaurant.

304
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:11,519
What kind of banquet is this? It's so formal.

305
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,200
Ms. Cheng is treating you to a meal.

306
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,039
Really? Ms. Cheng is treating me to a meal?

307
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,319
There's a lot of good food at GK Hotel.

308
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,170
You didn't let me eat all day.

309
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:26,599
If Ms. Cheng tells me to eat,

310
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,890
but I don't eat,

311
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:29,599
that would be disrespectful to my boss.

312
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:31,759
That's right.

313
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:34,720
There's penalty if you exceed the body fat limit.

314
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:40,650
I won't eat then.

315
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,798
When you see Han Hui later,

316
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:07,279
you've got to behave like a female lead.

317
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:10,890
Xiao Jing, aren't we meeting Ms. Cheng?

318
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:12,119
And Han Hui.

319
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,480
She's here for the female lead role of "Blue Galaxy".

320
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,119
I want you to prove...

321
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:18,920
that you're the best candidate for the female lead of "Blue Galaxy".

322
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:26,920
Xiao Jing, Han Hui is an international star.

323
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,200
I'm but an ugly duckling in front of her.

324
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:31,680
Besides,

325
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,559
she's definitely the right choice for the female lead.

326
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,650
How can I compete with her?

327
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:37,920
Let's go back now.

328
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,759
Wen Xiao Nuan.

329
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,200
Look at how unconfident you are.

330
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:48,480
In this aspect,

331
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:51,720
you're really no match for Han Hui.

332
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,799
She has such a high status in the industry now.

333
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,880
But she still works hard for the female lead role.

334
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,599
You're not doing your best at all.

335
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:01,200
That's how realistic this industry is.

336
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,719
Countless actresses out there want to take your place.

337
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,920
Can you avoid them all?

338
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:08,519
No one can easily take down the female lead.

339
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,479
There will be more difficulties and challenges in the future.

340
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,880
You can't avoid them all.

341
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:16,079
If you can't even take this step,

342
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:17,720
then I advise you...

343
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:19,759
to give up on your so-called dream.

344
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,799
You always ask me...

345
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:29,440
what else you can do...

346
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,079
when you're not training.

347
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,078
Right now, everyone in the company...

348
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:34,319
is paving the way for you.

349
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,480
What do you think is the right attitude you should give me?

350
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,960
Xiao Nuan.

351
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,440
I know you're a woman of honor.

352
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:50,160
A girl who won't admit defeat.

353
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:51,480
This battle...

354
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,039
isn't just for you.

355
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,759
It's also for everyone who has devoted themselves to you.

356
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:58,279
That includes Mr. Ye and me.

357
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,039
I'll go.

358
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:05,720
I'll go see Han Hui...

359
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,440
and those who don't believe in me.

360
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,240
I'll prove it to them.

361
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:11,519
Xiao Jing, I won't let you down.

362
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:13,440
Not even Ms. Cheng, Director Li,

363
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,680
and those who support me.

364
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,839
We all know you're the best.

365
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,400
You have to believe in yourself.

366
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:19,920
Prove to everyone...

367
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:22,160
that you deserve everything you have.

368
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,920
Go for it.

369
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:37,119
Fei Mo, have you heard?

370
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:39,440
Han Hui is going to meet Ms. Cheng.

371
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,240
There's going to be a bloodbath.

372
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:44,640
So what?

373
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,599
I'm not worried about my mom's combat strength at all.

374
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:49,200
Attack me all you want.

375
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,440
I have love to heal me anyway.

376
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,400
Ever since you fell in love,

377
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,480
you've become much more nosy.

378
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,559
You're no better than me.

379
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:00,720
Be honest with me.

380
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,078
You weren't at work all day.

381
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:03,880
What did you do with your little nurse?

382
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,839
I'm not as free as you. Get out.

383
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,039
I'm busy.

384
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,000
Hello, Mr. Ye.

385
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:34,839
How's Wen Xiao Nuan doing?

386
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,640
Xiao Nuan is much better.

387
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,720
She's with me and Ms. Cheng now.

388
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:41,119
My mom?

389
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,079
Isn't she with Han Hui?

390
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,440
She is.

391
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,000
Why did you bring Wen Xiao Nuan?

392
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,480
She's still sick.

393
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:50,240
Ms. Cheng arranged this.

394
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,799
What is my mom trying to do?

395
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,480
She wants Wen Xiao Nuan to compete with Han Hui?

396
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:57,720
Why didn't you stop her?

397
00:24:57,799 --> 00:25:00,119
Mr. Ye, I'm just an employee.

398
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:02,079
I do as the boss says.

399
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,480
Zhou Xiao Jing.

400
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,240
Wen Xiao Nuan is just a rookie.

401
00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:07,799
My mom...

402
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:10,440
She's putting her out there too soon.

403
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,119
It'll backfire.

404
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,440
Mr. Ye.

405
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:14,680
Don't underestimate Nuan.

406
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,720
- She can do it. - But...

407
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:18,358
You should trust Ms. Cheng's arrangement.

408
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:19,680
She admires Xiao Nuan.

409
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,880
Mr. Ye, I'm hanging up.

410
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,079
Ms. Cheng is waiting for us.

411
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,640
Nuan Nuan, you're here.

412
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:46,720
Come, have a seat.

413
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:55,919
Sorry for keeping you waiting, Ms. Cheng.

414
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,160
It's all right. Have a seat.

415
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,720
Ms. Han.

416
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,319
What are you waiting for?

417
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:19,640
Come in.

418
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:30,359
Ms. Cheng.

419
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,160
It's been a while.

420
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:36,400
I brought you a souvenir from the US.

421
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,920
I hope you like it.

422
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,759
Thank you, Han Hui.

423
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:57,960
It's a diamond brooch.

424
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:02,440
What a pity.

425
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,160
I'm not young anymore.

426
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,680
I think...

427
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,559
pearls are more suitable for me.

428
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:09,119
Diamonds...

429
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:11,640
make me look frivolous.

430
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,000
But I think it looks good...

431
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:19,519
on Nuan Nuan.

432
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,319
She looks so lively and cute.

433
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,240
Don't you think so, Ms. Han?

434
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,039
I'll gift it to you, Nuan Nuan.

435
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,759
Put it on.

436
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,999
It's okay, Ms. Cheng.

437
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Xiao Nuan.

438
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,319
It's from Ms. Cheng. Put it on.

439
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,440
Come on, put it on.

440
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,920
Thank Ms. Han.

441
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:41,640
Thank you, Ms. Cheng.

442
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,200
Thank you, Ms. Han.

443
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:45,319
Sit.

444
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:50,119
Put it on.

445
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,279
Wonderful.

446
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:56,880
It's pretty.

447
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:00,359
Nuan Nuan.

448
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,559
That day, Fei Mo insisted that you wear Rose's Tear to the banquet.

449
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,200
He even announced you as his girlfriend.

450
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,960
What's going on?

451
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,880
What's wrong?

452
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,960
The coffee is too bitter.

453
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:14,319
I'm not used to it.

454
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,039
Waiter.

455
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,759
Add some milk to my daughter-in-law's coffee.

456
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,160
No, Ms. Cheng. You've misunderstood.

457
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:23,160
There's nothing between Mr. Ye and me.

458
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:24,838
He said that the other day...

459
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:26,319
just to help me out of a situation.

460
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:28,399
And he only lent me the necklace...

461
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,400
to match my dress.

462
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,400
I returned it the next day.

463
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,920
So please don't get the wrong idea, Ms. Cheng.

464
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,119
Don't be nervous, Nuan Nuan.

465
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,960
I'm not against you two dating.

466
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,000
Since Fei Mo has announced...

467
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:44,799
that you're his girlfriend in front of everyone,

468
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,999
From now on, just go ahead and act like...

469
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,839
the daughter-in-law of the Ye family.

470
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:50,159
Don't worry.

471
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,799
I won't give you a hard time.

472
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,159
Do I look like I want to be...

473
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,119
Ye Fei Mo's fiancée that much?

474
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:01,400
I hope Ms. Cheng doesn't have a misunderstanding about me.

475
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,518
Xiao Jing too.

476
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:06,160
She didn't tell me anything and dressed me up so formally.

477
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,920
What's the reason for all this?
