1
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,280
("Blue Galaxy" sneakily changes its female lead)

2
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,199
(Weibo's Trending Topics)

3
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,280
Look at this.

4
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:47,438
(Actress Bai Xiu Wen's replacement by newcomer Wen Xiao Nuan...)

5
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,560
(led to the male lead dropping out.)

6
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,958
- Mr. Ye! - Mr. Ye!

7
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:50,959
Is Anning Culture...

8
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,199
Training?

9
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:20,719
You have to take it one step at a time.

10
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:22,960
Otherwise, you'll get hurt.

11
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:24,479
Xiao Jing.

12
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,438
This is all I can do...

13
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:27,680
for Anning right now.

14
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:32,879
I see.

15
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:34,478
Get up now.

16
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:35,530
Go get changed.

17
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,879
You have to go to an event with me.

18
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,759
Okay.

19
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:41,039
I'll go get changed now.

20
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:57,199
Xiao Jing.

21
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:59,280
Aren't you taking me to an event?

22
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,919
Why did you bring me home?

23
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,400
If you don't go home and rest,

24
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:04,120
your body won't be able to take it.

25
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,000
I'll go home, then.

26
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:11,638
Call me if you have any problems.

27
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:12,879
My phone is on 24 hours a day.

28
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,319
Xiao Jing, I'm leaving.

29
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,680
Bye.

30
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,120
Xiao Nuan.

31
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,319
Stop watching the news.

32
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:27,240
Eat well and sleep well.

33
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:28,719
Get yourself in shape.

34
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:30,879
Okay.

35
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,360
Wen Xiao Nuan.

36
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,319
Why are you here?

37
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,919
Wen Xiao Nuan, you should back out.

38
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,800
Don't get yourself caught up...

39
00:03:57,801 --> 00:03:58,918
in the media's whirlpool.

40
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:00,680
You can't handle this pressure.

41
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,840
Mr. Jiang,

42
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,960
you never understood me.

43
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,559
Wen Xiao Nuan, I'm looking out for you.

44
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,959
This isn't how you dream of stardom.

45
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,400
This isn't how you make money.

46
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:14,638
Anning will find out soon...

47
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:15,718
that you're just a burden.

48
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:17,319
They'll get rid of you in no time.

49
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,050
I've always been a burden to you.

50
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,438
Wen Xiao Nuan, don't think...

51
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:27,319
that Ye Fei Mo is someone you can rely on.

52
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:29,278
Yes, he can promote you all he wants now.

53
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:30,839
It's his right. It doesn't matter.

54
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:32,730
Look at what happens after that.

55
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,278
The male lead quits.

56
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:36,049
The box office flops. The stock market is in turmoil.

57
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,399
How many good days does Anning have ahead?

58
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:42,759
Wake up, Nuan Nuan.

59
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,610
Ye Fei Mo is just a playboy.

60
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:47,439
He doesn't know anything...

61
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,680
about film production.

62
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,198
He can't control...

63
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:51,439
the current situation.

64
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,278
Yes, he can give up everything for a woman.

65
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,398
That's his problem. What about you?

66
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:57,120
If you go along with it, you'll end up harming yourself.

67
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:58,639
Wait.

68
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:02,279
Besides,

69
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,239
if it weren't for you,

70
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,050
Ye Fei Mo wouldn't have cast a new actress...

71
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,560
as the female lead of "Blue Galaxy", right?

72
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,559
Then none of this would have happened.

73
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,319
You're dragging him down, you know?

74
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,610
Don't come to me again.

75
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:25,319
Wen Xiao Nuan!

76
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:27,719
I'm the only one who cares about you!

77
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,120
I'm the only one who can protect you!

78
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,720
Arrange a meeting with Ye Fei Mo.

79
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,360
The sooner the better.

80
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:16,639
Nuan Nuan.

81
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,279
Jia Yi.

82
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,519
Cry if you want to.

83
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:27,800
Jia Yi, I'm fine.

84
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,999
But the more you act like this,

85
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,160
the more I worry about you.

86
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:33,519
Jia Yi.

87
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,160
Actually, a lot of people...

88
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,120
envy me for signing with Anning...

89
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,120
and for having the chance...

90
00:06:41,121 --> 00:06:42,879
to be the female lead of "Blue Galaxy".

91
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:49,720
But they have no idea...

92
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,319
how much pressure I'm under,

93
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:54,519
being pushed to this position...

94
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,319
as a rookie.

95
00:06:58,839 --> 00:06:59,879
Nuan Nuan,

96
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:03,160
nothing is more important than happiness.

97
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,719
If you really can't handle it, we...

98
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,800
No.

99
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,720
No matter how much pressure I'm under,

100
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,560
no matter how many people scold me,

101
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,279
I have to keep going.

102
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,480
Because of you,

103
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,600
Ye Fei Mo.

104
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,319
Xiao Jing, and Director Li.

105
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:23,519
So many seniors have supported me.

106
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:26,000
It wasn't easy for me to get to where I am today.

107
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:28,040
So...

108
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,800
I can't let you guys down.

109
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,198
Mr. Ye.

110
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:01,279
Director Li is calling.

111
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:10,279
Hello.

112
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:11,279
Fei Mo,

113
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,040
there's a lot of controversy about this.

114
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,480
The company must be under a lot of pressure.

115
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:17,000
All projects are under pressure.

116
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,199
Continue with the preparations as planned.

117
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:21,359
Don't worry about the male lead.

118
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,399
Leave it to me.

119
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:24,600
Okay, I'm relieved to hear that.

120
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,600
Mr. Jiang from Aurora is waiting for you.

121
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,279
Tell him to come in.

122
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,399
Okay.

123
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,559
Okay.

124
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,450
Reverse.

125
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,039
Here.

126
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,209
"Blue Galaxy"'s male lead is on strike.

127
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,449
- Again. - It's all over the news.

128
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,720
- Reverse. - It makes our job hard, Mr. Ye.

129
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,480
For example, business partnerships,

130
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:03,159
product placement,

131
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,399
theatrical release, and word of mouth from audiences...

132
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,159
will be greatly affected.

133
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:09,879
- Again. - Mr. Ye.

134
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,039
Faster.

135
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,799
- Reverse. - Mr. Ye, I'm talking to you.

136
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,600
- Come on. - What ideas do you have, Mr. Jiang?

137
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,679
I suggest...

138
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:22,210
replacing the female lead, Wen Xiao Nuan.

139
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:24,450
Replace her with a more famous actress...

140
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:26,279
who will bring her own popularity and buzz.

141
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:27,599
This way,

142
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,360
we can change the direction of public opinion.

143
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,720
Sure.

144
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,159
Reverse.

145
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:34,450
What did you say?

146
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,450
Step in.

147
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:49,279
There's no need.

148
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,450
I'm here to talk to you about work.

149
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,279
Okay.

150
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,120
I'll spar a bit with you.

151
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:09,000
Prepare the thickest protective gear...

152
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:10,639
for Mr. Jiang.

153
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,159
Ye Fei Mo,

154
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:20,519
what's the meaning of this?

155
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,120
You agreed to replace Wen Xiao Nuan.

156
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,799
It's fine to replace Wen Xiao Nuan.

157
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,240
But...

158
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:28,330
the whole cast and crew will have to be replaced.

159
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,159
That includes Aurora.

160
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,759
Replace Aurora?

161
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:37,480
Are you giving up your upfront investments?

162
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:39,960
Anning has no problem with it.

163
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:41,639
But you...

164
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:43,279
can't afford it.

165
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:53,639
Mr. Ye, you're really cunning.

166
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,960
You know Aurora invested so much in this.

167
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:57,919
We can't possibly back out.

168
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,159
We're all businessmen.

169
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,879
We all make money from our work.

170
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,519
Now that it's come to this,

171
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,639
why don't we compromise?

172
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,799
Wen Xiao Nuan can play the supporting actress.

173
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,159
But the leading actress...

174
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,759
has to be Han Hui.

175
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,159
Otherwise,

176
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,638
no actor in this country...

177
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:15,960
will take on this mess.

178
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,720
This film is centered on the female lead.

179
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,639
Changing it to something completely different...

180
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,279
is also a dead end.

181
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:22,639
You know that.

182
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,000
It's my turn to strike.

183
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,519
Can you give me a straight answer, Mr. Ye?

184
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:33,559
You're right.

185
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,558
"Blue Galaxy"...

186
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:36,799
is an international production.

187
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,519
The male lead...

188
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:40,519
must be an international A-list actor.

189
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:43,039
Don't worry.

190
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:44,960
I'll take care of it.

191
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:46,399
As for you,

192
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,600
go back to being a leech.

193
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,720
Say that again.

194
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,080
Let's have a duel, man to man.

195
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,518
If you win,

196
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:02,999
Wen Xiao Nuan will be the female lead.

197
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
If I win...

198
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,360
I'm in.

199
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Ye Fei Mo.

200
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,360
Ye Fei Mo!

201
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:33,279
There's a movie that suits you.

202
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,960
Come back to China.

203
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:45,960
(Mo Xiao Bai)

204
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,080
So beautiful.

205
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,840
You're really beautiful.

206
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,720
You're practically...

207
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,919
a classic beauty straight out of a painting.

208
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,759
You're so beautiful. Stunning.

209
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,120
- Han Hui, - Here. Good.

210
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,320
Let's take a break.

211
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:15,159
Ms. Han, go ahead.

212
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,279
Mr. Jiang.

213
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,879
Ms. Han,

214
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,240
I'm at my wit's end...

215
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,960
with Ye Fei Mo.

216
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,440
As everyone knows,

217
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,559
you're the most suitable candidate for the female lead.

218
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,320
But now,

219
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,039
Ye Fei Mo just wants to make Wen Xiao Nuan a star.

220
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:43,879
He doesn't care about anything else.

221
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:45,919
It's obvious...

222
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:47,960
that he wants Wen Xiao Nuan to use you as a stepping stone.

223
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:51,320
I think...

224
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,399
you're the only one...

225
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:55,320
who can change his mind now.

226
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,120
Ms. Han Hui, can we start now?

227
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,919
Ms. Han Hui isn't feeling well.

228
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,320
Why don't you take a break?

229
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:17,120
Okay.

230
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:23,879
Han Hui.

231
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:41,399
I can understand why Mr. Ye is angry.

232
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:43,319
But how could he humiliate you...

233
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,320
with a stand-in?

234
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,559
That's a bit too much.

235
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,239
Could Mr. Ye have really fallen...

236
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,600
for that stand-in?

237
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:55,759
No way.

238
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:57,918
When would Mr. Ye fall...

239
00:14:57,919 --> 00:14:59,039
for a girl like that?

240
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,879
Do you want some water?

241
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,240
Actually,

242
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,480
you two have been at a standoff for so long.

243
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:13,600
You're both waiting for each other to give a way out.

244
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,559
This is a critical moment.

245
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:19,079
I think...

246
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,479
we should take the initiative...

247
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,759
and give Mr. Ye a chance.

248
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,840
Maybe we can score "Blue Galaxy"...

249
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:26,720
and win back Mr. Ye's heart too.

250
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,440
How can I take the initiative?

251
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,519
Mr. Ye still has you in his heart.

252
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:33,240
Otherwise,

253
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,960
he wouldn't have hired a stand-in...

254
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,480
just to spite you.

255
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:44,039
It's hard to see it from the inside.

256
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,559
It's clearer from the outside.

257
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:04,039
That's enough for today.

258
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:05,759
Go home and get some rest.

259
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:08,639
It's okay, Xiao Jing. I can practice a bit more.

260
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:11,199
I said so much to you yesterday.

261
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,720
Do you still not understand?

262
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,000
Regarding the male lead,

263
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,320
you don't have to blame yourself for it.

264
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,360
Wen Xiao Nuan, are you listening to me?

265
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:26,960
Xiao Jing,

266
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,559
I just want to get the basics down...

267
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,639
and act well.

268
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:32,159
I'll let my skills speak for themselves.

269
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,399
Don't stay up too late.

270
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,279
Your health comes first.

271
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,920
Besides,

272
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:08,799
if it weren't for you,

273
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,680
Ye Fei Mo wouldn't have cast a new actress...

274
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,799
as the female lead of "Blue Galaxy", right?

275
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,118
Then none of this would have happened.

276
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,799
You're dragging him down, you know?

277
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,119
Mr. Ye,

278
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,000
can you talk to Wen Xiao Nuan for me?

279
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:33,079
She has to bear this pressure.

280
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:35,599
It's a requirement for an S-class artist.

281
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:41,359
Maybe...

282
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:43,480
for now,

283
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:45,170
focusing on training...

284
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:48,000
can relieve her stress.

285
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:51,920
Compared to your last relationship,

286
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:53,359
you've matured a lot.

287
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:55,799
Actually,

288
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:58,170
I don't know if I should ask you this.

289
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,440
You're so nice to Wen Xiao Nuan.

290
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:02,720
Is it because...

291
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:05,039
she looks like Han Hui in the past?

292
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,558
I'm hanging up if there's nothing else to report.

293
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:12,559
Mr. Ye.

294
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:14,680
Wen Xiao Nuan is a good girl.

295
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,319
She shouldn't be anyone's replacement.

296
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:00,920
Jia Yi, I'm going to practice some more.

297
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,680
Don't wait up for me. Go to bed first.

298
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,559
Where is today's bedtime photo?

299
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:18,119
She's still practicing. She hasn't gone home yet.

300
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:43,359
Did Nuan Nuan not come home all night?

301
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:46,200
This won't do.

302
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:08,279
(She's still practicing. She hasn't gone home yet.)

303
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:55,839
I did it.

304
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,680
Wen Xiao Nuan.

305
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:14,839
What's wrong?

306
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:19,680
What's wrong with you?

307
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,359
I'm fine.

308
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,170
The patient is fine.

309
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,720
It's just fatigue.

310
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:41,240
She fainted from low blood sugar.

311
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:43,319
Let's replenish some glucose first.

312
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:44,839
Get some rest.

313
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:46,960
Replenish some nutrients.

314
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:49,799
Mr. Ye, I'll get going, then.

315
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,319
Dr. Bai, I'll walk you out.

316
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,480
You guys talk.

317
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:12,599
I'll take care of her.

318
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,999
Mr. Ye, who is always calm and collected...

319
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,559
even when handling projects worth hundreds of millions of yuan,

320
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,278
gets so anxious...

321
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:39,440
seeing Wen Xiao Nuan sick.

322
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,480
She's one of Anning's S-class artists.

323
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,720
She's the company's...

324
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:48,359
important asset.

325
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,720
I think Wen Xiao Nuan...

326
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:51,960
is a nice girl.

327
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,559
So there's something you need to understand.

328
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,119
Do you see her as a substitute for Han Hui?

329
00:22:58,079 --> 00:22:59,839
Or do you see her as Wen Xiao Nuan herself?

330
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:17,078
Han Hui's imprint in your heart...

331
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:18,680
couldn't be erased all these years.

332
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,160
That's why you kept rejecting all the girls...

333
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,518
until Wen Xiao Nuan,

334
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:26,640
who looks exactly as Han Hui did when she debuted,

335
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,599
appeared in your life.

336
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,079
If Wen Xiao Nuan finds out...

337
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,720
that she's Han Hui's stand-in,

338
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,559
she'll be really sad.

339
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,559
Do you think others are as cold-hearted as you?

340
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,599
I'm very kind-hearted.

341
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:52,799
I won't abandon you.

342
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:01,759
No.

343
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,519
She's different from Han Hui.

344
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,200
It's good that you've figured this out.

345
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:10,400
And let me remind you.

346
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,960
Even though everything that Wen Xiao Nuan has now...

347
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,039
is because of you,

348
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,440
everything that she is enduring...

349
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:18,400
is also because of you.

350
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,720
Maggie.

351
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,880
Use all the company's resources...

352
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:36,559
to find out...

353
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,319
why the male lead of "Blue Galaxy" is on strike.

354
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:03,319
Jia Yi,

355
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,160
I have something to tell you.

356
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:25,480
Mr. Gu, what do you want to say?

357
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,319
I'm sorry, Jia Yi.

358
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,319
I lied to you.

359
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:32,119
I hid my real identity.

360
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,880
And besides that?

361
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,240
I know you were hurt before.

362
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,039
You don't like rich men.

363
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:42,000
- So I... - I gave you a chance.

364
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,599
I wanted you to tell me on your own.

365
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:46,880
But you didn't.

366
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,319
You chose to keep lying to me.

367
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:50,839
What?

368
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,159
You can't hide it anymore, can you?

369
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,599
No, Jia Yi. Jia Yi.

370
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,799
Let me take you somewhere.

371
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:35,119
By the way,

372
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,200
for the new movie that Aurora invested in,

373
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,200
Wen Xiao Nuan was cast as the female lead.

374
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,000
I thought it would be you instead.
