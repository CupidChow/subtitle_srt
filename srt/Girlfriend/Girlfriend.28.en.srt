00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,760
(Episode 28)

2
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,959
Yun Zhou, I'm sorry.

3
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:42,798
- I'll wipe it for you. - It's okay.

4
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,518
- I'm sorry. I'll wipe it for you.
- It's okay.

5
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:45,680
I'll do it myself.

6
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:49,560
Who is this?

7
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,560
Jia Yi, she's my...

8
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:58,159
I'm Yun Zhou's childhood sweetheart,

9
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,079
also his mother's appointed daughter-in-law.

10
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,400
Who are you?

11
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:02,640
Zhao Di.

12
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,920
Yun Zhou, what's wrong?

13
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,719
Who's your daughter-in-law? No...

14
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,439
Whose daughter-in-law are you?

15
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,399
Yesterday, your mom held my hand and said...

16
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,919
she wanted me to be her daughter-in-law.

17
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,319
Listen up.

18
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,199
She's my girlfriend.

19
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,759
Stop talking nonsense.

20
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,718
So you're the woman who overestimated herself...

21
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:29,479
and kept pestering Yun Zhou.

22
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,039
I overestimated myself?

23
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,960
I pestered Yun Zhou?

24
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,960
Yun Zhou, what's going on exactly?

25
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,319
That's right. If you didn't pester him,

26
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:45,360
he wouldn't have come to complain to me.

27
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,718
When did I complain to you?

28
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:50,800
Just now.

29
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,039
You said she was unreasonable and throwing a tantrum.

30
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:54,479
You had to coax her and accommodate her.

31
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,639
Jia Yi.

32
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:57,279
I never said that to her.

33
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,400
She made it all up.

34
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,520
It's true.

35
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,360
Ms. Wang.

36
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,280
Yun Zhou and I grew up together.

37
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:08,400
We're childhood friends.

38
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,199
Our families have always been friends.

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,800
Our parents have long decided for us to get married.

40
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:16,759
So please leave Yun Zhou.

41
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,560
Don't get in the way of our relationship, okay?

42
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,560
Zhao Di, are you done?

43
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:26,120
This problem is between you two.

44
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:27,240
You solve it.

45
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:29,479
Jia Yi.

46
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,400
Just you wait.

47
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:36,960
Jia Yi.

48
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,280
Jia Yi.

49
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:39,560
Let me explain.

50
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,718
She was talking nonsense. Don't believe her.

51
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:42,719
Nonsense?

52
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,159
You two were so in sync.

53
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:46,280
We're not in sync.

54
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,479
If you want to talk about sync,

55
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:50,759
I'm only in sync with you.

56
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,120
Jia Yi.

57
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:55,439
Please believe me.

58
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:57,800
My feelings for you are true.

59
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,120
If I'm lying to you,

60
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,000
I swear I'll be a panda in my next life.

61
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,479
I'll dance the seaweed dance for you every day.

62
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,280
Don't be ridiculous.

63
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,319
Jia Yi.

64
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,360
Are you still mad?

65
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,318
"Blue Galaxy" is about to premiere.

66
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,439
Are you coming?

67
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,240
Yes.

68
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,120
Hello, miss. Which seat do you want?

69
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:26,639
Have you chosen?

70
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,919
Okay.

71
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,240
It's very popular.

72
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,999
Are we watching "Blue Galaxy" or "Magpie Bridge"?

73
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,198
It has to be the "Magpie Bridge".

74
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,398
Han Hui is the lead actress.

75
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:35,680
But the lead actor in "Blue Galaxy" is Mo Xiao Bai.

76
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:37,278
That's right. What do you know?

77
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:39,319
The main point is the lead actress.

78
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:41,799
Besides, the lead actress in "Blue Galaxy" is a rookie.

79
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,800
I've never heard of her.

80
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,800
That's true.

81
00:04:43,801 --> 00:04:45,838
I heard "Blue Galaxy" is a Huangmei opera.

82
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:47,518
That doesn't sound good to watch.

83
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:48,638
Let's just watch "Magpie Bridge".

84
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:49,800
Don't think too much.

85
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,359
The opinions of a few people are not the opinions of the public.

86
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,519
The ratings for "Blue Galaxy" and
"Magpie Bridge" aren't even close.

87
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,999
Look, "Blue Galaxy" is the only movie screening...

88
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,279
at Aurora Film today.

89
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:00,078
Good thing we didn't go to Aurora Film.

90
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:01,879
Yes, or we'd have lost out.

91
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,519
Let's watch "Magpie Bridge" then.

92
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,920
The word of mouth will get better.

93
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,079
I'm sorry.

94
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,480
I'm tired. I want to go home.

95
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:18,638
Watch it with me.

96
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,170
Which movie do you want to watch?

97
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,199
Nuan Nuan.

98
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:45,920
What's wrong?

99
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,800
You look upset.

100
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,079
I'm fine.

101
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,079
Is it because of the box office?

102
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,759
Don't worry. It'll be fine.

103
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,560
Did Gu Yun Zhou tell you?

104
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,839
We went to watch your movie.

105
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,639
I think it was great.

106
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,160
Especially the wedding scene.

107
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:08,680
I almost cried my eyes out.

108
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:12,160
Don't worry. Things will get better.

109
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,120
Thank you, Jia Yi.

110
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:19,480
Didn't you go on a date with Gu Yun Zhou?

111
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,479
Why do you look so down?

112
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,759
I'm okay. Don't worry.

113
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm just a little tired.

114
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,519
When you're tired,

115
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,278
you tend to overthink things.

116
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:30,240
Overthink things? What happened?

117
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,759
(I'm waiting for you downstairs.)

118
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:42,480
Hurry up and go.

119
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,000
Don't let him worry too much.

120
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,519
At times like this, telling him how you feel...

121
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,959
might be the best solution.

122
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,199
Let's talk another day.

123
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:03,839
Did you cry?

124
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,519
No.

125
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,959
Ye Fei Mo.

126
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,680
I'm sorry.

127
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,079
Why are you apologizing?

128
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,959
I was the one who suggested...

129
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,279
to add Huangmei opera to "Blue Galaxy".

130
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:36,480
But the box office isn't doing well now.

131
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:38,199
Part of the reason...

132
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,519
is that many audiences can't accept Huangmei opera.

133
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:44,439
That's why that's happening.

134
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,759
Silly girl.

135
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:51,879
It's only been two days.

136
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,439
It's too early to be discouraged.

137
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,040
Besides,

138
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,959
Li Can and I have been in showbiz for years.

139
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:01,160
We are very experienced producers and directors.

140
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:02,959
We won't dictate the format of a movie...

141
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,360
just by your words alone.

142
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,000
Do you believe...

143
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,439
that a butterfly flapping its wings...

144
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,319
can cause a tornado?

145
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:18,279
Do you mean the butterfly effect?

146
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,959
Butterflies may be weak,

147
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:23,519
but they can emit a lot of energy.

148
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,360
Huangmei opera is the butterfly?

149
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,920
No.

150
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,639
It's you.

151
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,840
Me?

152
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,559
Everyone thinks I'm a rookie...

153
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,799
and the public is not familiar with Huangmei opera.

154
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,090
They all say they won't go to the cinema to watch it.

155
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,399
The box office sales...

156
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,759
will decrease then, right?

157
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,450
Then why did you...

158
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,639
perform Huangmei opera back then?

159
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,240
Why did you...

160
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:07,240
persist until now?

161
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:12,159
Because when I was young,

162
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,840
I sang on stage with my parents.

163
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:17,330
I watched the audience be influenced...

164
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:20,519
by the emotions in the play.

165
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,519
It made me so happy.

166
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,120
Also,

167
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:27,240
the older I get,

168
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:30,480
the more I feel that the Huangmei tune is graceful.

169
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:33,450
There's a deep charm in it.

170
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:36,679
It's worth savoring carefully.

171
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,240
You said it yourself.

172
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,240
It's worth savoring carefully.

173
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,960
It takes time.

174
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,840
You grew up in a theater troupe with your parents.

175
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:50,039
You know best...

176
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:52,000
what the essence of theater is.

177
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:55,120
Once the gong is sounded on stage,

178
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,759
you have to keep singing.

179
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,600
Come rain or shine,

180
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,159
whether there's an audience or not,

181
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:01,679
you have to keep singing.

182
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,159
That's the spirit of theater.

183
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,960
Nuan Nuan.

184
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:08,330
You're the butterfly.

185
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,279
Huangmei opera...

186
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:11,759
is the tornado.

187
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:13,799
You can back down.

188
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:15,279
But not Huangmei opera.

189
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,919
Adding Huangmei opera to a commercial movie...

190
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:24,450
is something new to the audience.

191
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,480
And you're a rookie.

192
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,600
It's normal...

193
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,330
for people to doubt you.

194
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,799
Everything that's new...

195
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,480
needs time for people to accept it.

196
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:39,639
What you need to think about now...

197
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:42,519
is how to make people accept it faster.

198
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:44,399
Understand?

199
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:50,210
Have you figured it out?

200
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,840
If you have, go run ten laps.

201
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:56,799
Your face looks so big on the screen.

202
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,360
You need to exercise more.

203
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:00,720
Ye Fei Mo.

204
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,440
Did you think I asked you to come down to talk?

205
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:04,960
Don't slack off.

206
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,360
I'll ask Xiao Jing to check.

207
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:09,679
Come on. Let's go.

208
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:16,999
(Haven't watched it. I think it's so-so.)

209
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,440
("Blue Galaxy", 4.5 rating)

210
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:20,798
Box office sales for "Blue Galaxy" is far lower than expected.

211
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:23,240
Has Director Li Can's career fallen apart?

212
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,840
(Even Mo Xiao Bai can't save "Blue Galaxy")

213
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,439
To promote "Blue Galaxy",

214
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,439
in two days, we'll need to go...

215
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,320
to some major cities in a couple of days.

216
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,360
Okay. I'll adjust to your schedule then.

217
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:37,559
And some interviews with newspapers and new media.

218
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:39,359
I'll email you...

219
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,639
the details and the time.

220
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:51,159
You've worked hard these past few days.

221
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,799
It's what I should do.

222
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,798
We all hope that more people...

223
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:56,039
will watch "Blue Galaxy".

224
00:11:58,679 --> 00:11:59,799
Get some rest.

225
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,519
It breaks my heart seeing you like this.

226
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:07,559
Come in.

227
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:12,960
Nuan Nuan.

228
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:18,720
Xiao Jing, Director Li.

229
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,120
Have some coffee.

230
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:22,960
Here.

231
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:25,559
What's this?

232
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,679
These are my promotional ideas for Huangmei opera.

233
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,120
It's quite detailed.

234
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,600
I hope it's helpful.

235
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:48,240
Are you feeling a lot of pressure these past two days?

236
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,679
I didn't expect...

237
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,599
so many negative comments online...

238
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,039
about "Blue Galaxy".

239
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,320
It's normal. You have to go through it.

240
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,558
If you feel confident...

241
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:03,799
after completing a piece of work,

242
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,600
then you should be more worried.

243
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:07,080
Why?

244
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:09,759
What does it mean if you're not worried about your work?

245
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:13,960
Either you're repeating what you've done before,

246
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:15,878
or you're repeating...

247
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,320
what someone else has done before.

248
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,960
I suppose that makes sense.

249
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,079
So all our worries and anxieties right now...

250
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,720
are because we're doing something that has never been done before.

251
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,798
This time on "Blue Galaxy",

252
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:31,959
we used a modern way...

253
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,480
to express the beauty of traditional art.

254
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,119
People tend to resist things...

255
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,720
that they don't understand.

256
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,798
"Blue Galaxy" uses...

257
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:41,919
the art form of Huangmei opera.

258
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:43,479
So it will take some time...

259
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,960
for the audience to accept it.

260
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,519
So during this time,

261
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,600
you turn on your Do Not Disturb mode.

262
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,120
Just try to relax.

263
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,878
Since it takes time for the public to accept it,

264
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:58,119
we can start with the basics...

265
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,399
to help them understand.

266
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,480
Interesting.

267
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,039
Let's hear it then.

268
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,600
We can make some videos...

269
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,239
to help them understand...

270
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,240
the body, the tone,

271
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,679
and the origin of Huangmei opera.

272
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:22,799
I heard the opening week of "Blue Galaxy" was a flop.

273
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:25,679
Many cinemas have reduced their screening.

274
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,279
However,

275
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,360
Aurora Film is still determined...

276
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:32,120
to maintain 100% of the screening.

277
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,879
The company has released a similar movie,

278
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:36,879
but it's still so supportive "of Blue Galaxy".

279
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,000
I really don't get it.

280
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:41,199
This won't do.

281
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,840
- I'll call Jiang Fang now. - Ling Er.

282
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,158
If Mr. Jiang won't reduce the screenings,

283
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:46,639
he must have his reasons.

284
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,480
Reasons?

285
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:49,960
After all,

286
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,559
the lead actress of "Blue Galaxy" is Wen Xiao Nuan.

287
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:56,200
Men...

288
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,039
always cherish the past.

289
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,480
Han Hui, I'm busy. I have to go.

290
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,360
Ling Er.

291
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:08,519
Don't be rash.

292
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:10,799
Remember.

293
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:12,239
What you have to do now...

294
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,000
is to make him forget Wen Xiao Nuan...

295
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,519
and love only you.

296
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,279
If you rush to him now,

297
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,240
you'll only push him away.

298
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,240
Han Hui, you mean...

299
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,399
You can't force him.

300
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,559
You have to coax him.

301
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,919
Once he's happy,

302
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:33,759
if you ask for anything,

303
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:35,559
I'll agree to it.

304
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,519
I'm sorry, Ms. Jiang.

305
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,279
Mr. Jiang is in a meeting.

306
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,679
It's okay. I'll wait for him inside.

307
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:00,518
Send this to the Project Department for approval.

308
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:01,959
Then give me the system evaluation feedback.

309
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,080
Okay, Mr. Jiang.

310
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,319
Send this over first.

311
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,000
We'll talk about the other evaluations later.

312
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:08,039
Go on.

313
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,440
You've been in meetings all day.

314
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:21,039
- Have some water. - Thank you.

315
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,720
Why are you looking for me?

316
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,679
Can't I look for you if there's nothing?

317
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,360
I just miss you.

318
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,039
I know you too well.

319
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,759
Tell me. Why did you want to see me?

320
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,480
Is the box office for "Blue Galaxy" not doing well?

321
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,639
The first week's box office isn't doing well.

322
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:45,720
Many cinemas have reduced their screenings.

323
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,039
Aurora Film should reduce it too.

324
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,879
That way, we'll suffer less losses.

325
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,878
Actually, Anning's promotion is accurate and on point.

326
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:53,480
I'm still quite optimistic about "Blue Galaxy".

327
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,480
I think it's definitely a late-stage dark horse.

328
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,600
And Aurora Film is the producer and partner.

329
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,279
I'm sure we'll benefit from it.

330
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:04,599
You have to trust my professional judgment.

331
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,410
Jiang Fang.

332
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:10,410
Aurora Film is the joint producer of "Blue Galaxy".

333
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:11,920
But don't forget.

334
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,799
Anning is in charge after all.

335
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,650
"Magpie Bridge" is our true investment.

336
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,359
Now "Magpie Bridge" is competing with "Blue Galaxy".

337
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:21,410
It'll be hard for you to answer to the company.

338
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,038
I'm doing this for your sake.

339
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,169
How is that possible?

340
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,480
"Magpie Bridge" isn't affected.

341
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,479
"Magpie Bridge" has a good box office and word of mouth.

342
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,039
Why would the board disapprove?

343
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,410
You have an ulterior motive.

344
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:35,759
It's not "Blue Galaxy" you're optimistic about.

345
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:36,960
It's Wen Xiao Nuan.

346
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,479
You don't want to reduce the screening...

347
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,759
because you want to help her.

348
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:41,359
What are you talking about?

349
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,079
Wen Xiao Nuan and I broke up a long time ago.

350
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,920
According to industry customs,

351
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:49,650
if the movie doesn't do well on premiere,

352
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,410
as the producer,

353
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:53,170
Aurora Film has the right to reduce the screenings.

354
00:17:56,519 --> 00:17:57,838
This is business.

355
00:17:57,839 --> 00:17:59,798
I have an agreement with Anning.

356
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:01,409
Everything is going according to the agreement.

357
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:02,680
I can't just reduce it.

358
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,410
As the company's second-largest shareholder,

359
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,759
I can apply for arbitration...

360
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:07,799
as the box office sales for "Blue Galaxy" are too low...

361
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,650
and it's harming the company's interests.

362
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:11,559
I'll reduce the screenings.

363
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,119
You don't have to take responsibility for this.

364
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,039
Ling Er.

365
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,720
You...

366
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:27,170
Mr. Ye.

367
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:29,759
The first week's box office sales of "Blue Galaxy" are really bad.

368
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:31,200
We have to cut our losses in time.

369
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,838
The more publicity we invest,

370
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:34,839
the more we lose.

371
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,650
We'll lose control of the cost.

372
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,650
Both word of mouth and box office failed.

373
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:41,039
This is unprecedented for Anning.

374
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:43,319
Judging from the comments online,

375
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:44,559
the main reason is...

376
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:46,039
the Huangmei opera format.

377
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,960
It's hard for the audience to accept.

378
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:50,410
We can't make up for it...

379
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:51,920
based on promotions alone.

380
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,039
"Blue Galaxy" is the project I personally led.

381
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,039
I'm confident in its quality.

382
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:01,559
It's not an ordinary commercial film.

383
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,720
We need to give the audience more time to accept it.

384
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:09,649
Aside from Aurora Film,

385
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,480
all major cinemas are reducing the screening.

386
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:13,960
But according to Aurora Film's insider information,

387
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,680
the higher-ups have gone to Jiang Fang...

388
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,319
and forcefully asked him to reduce the screening.

389
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:19,039
I'm guessing...

390
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:20,679
he won't hold on for long.

391
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,759
Anning signed a distribution contract with Aurora Film.

392
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,440
I don't think Jiang Fang will break the contract so easily.

393
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:34,200
(Jiang Fang)

394
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:38,839
The day after tomorrow at 3:00 pm.

395
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,079
See you at the boxing gym.

396
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:41,759
Okay.

397
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:05,170
Let's get down to business.

398
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:08,279
You know why I asked you to come.

399
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,170
You want to reduce the screening.

400
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:15,000
You're a trustworthy partner.

401
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:17,170
I'll keep my promise...

402
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,480
and go according to the contract.

403
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:20,720
I guarantee "Blue Galaxy" will keep screening.

404
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:26,480
So why are you here today? What do you want to say?

405
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:30,650
I want to ask you...

406
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:32,759
to solve this emergency.

407
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,720
I don't know how long I can hold out.

408
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:39,039
Don't worry.

409
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:41,170
Moving forward,

410
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:42,799
leave things to me.

411
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,759
Okay.

412
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:47,359
I'll get going.

413
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,119
Are you still unhappy?

414
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:08,480
The company is already promoting it so much.

415
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,759
But the movie's word of mouth...

416
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,519
and box office sales aren't improving at all.

417
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,839
Promoting the movie...

418
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,759
is like the flour you're making right now.

419
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:18,920
It needs time to ferment.

420
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:20,799
Don't worry.

421
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,119
Things will get better.

422
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:27,079
What's wrong? Is there something on my face?

423
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,359
What are you laughing at?

424
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:35,000
Stop filming me.

425
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,558
Don't film me.

426
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,319
- I'll record a video. - Don't.

427
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,839
I'm recording.

428
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,758
A man and a woman

429
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:49,960
Go to the ridge of the field in a pair

430
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,838
A seed is thrown

431
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:53,680
A bud sprouts

432
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,838
Feed it, feed it

433
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:57,479
It has to be fed

434
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,480
What kind of flower is it?

435
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:02,598
Stop laughing.

436
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:03,599
It's so funny. Look.

437
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:07,440
What happened to my face?

438
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:10,000
I didn't know Huangmei opera could be so interesting.

439
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,598
Of course.

440
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:13,759
What you know about Huangmei opera is just the surface.

441
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:25,838
A man and a woman

442
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:31,000
Go to the ridge of the field in a pair

443
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,999
A seed is thrown

444
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,759
A bud sprouts

445
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,920
Feed it, feed it

446
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,719
It has to be fed

447
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,640
What kind of flower is it?

448
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,920
Okay.

449
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,079
What do you all think?

450
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,920
I didn't know Huangmei opera could be sung like this.

451
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:50,119
It's quite interesting.

452
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:52,680
It's totally different from what we thought.

453
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:55,279
But...

454
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:56,799
Mr. Ye.

455
00:23:57,319 --> 00:23:58,400
I don't understand.

456
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,679
What does this have to do...

457
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,720
with the movie's promotion?

458
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,920
If this video is posted online,

459
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:06,160
I believe...

460
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,480
it will change the perception of Huangmei opera.

461
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,079
But...

462
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:13,559
isn't this too childish?

463
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,480
It's not something we can show on TV.

464
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,200
I think so too.

465
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,000
It's enough to watch it for fun.

466
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,720
I have a question for everyone.

467
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,400
When you watch this video,

468
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,960
do you feel happy?

469
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:28,199
When I was watching it, I did feel happy.

470
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,279
It was fun.

471
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
What about the others?

472
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,240
I think it was fun too.

473
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,239
Something that can make people happy...

474
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,359
and make them comment and share the video on their own,

475
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,680
is good publicity.

476
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:42,880
Our industry is evolving.

477
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:45,440
There are many ways to go about promotion.

478
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,960
We can choose a way that's acceptable to the audience...

479
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,519
to promote our movie.

480
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,240
That shouldn't be a problem, right?

481
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,119
Mr. Ye, you're right.

482
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,759
I understand now.

483
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:02,160
A way that's acceptable to the audience...

484
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,279
is the best way to promote our movie.

485
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,439
Mr. Ye.

486
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,880
I'll adjust the online and offline promotions right away.

487
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:10,559
We'll coordinate it with the short video.

488
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,000
Look.

489
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,639
I didn't know Huangmei opera could be like this.

490
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,799
It's so interesting.

491
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:22,480
It's really fun.

492
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:32,680
What kind of flower is it?

493
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,680
You're gaining popularity so fast.

494
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:37,680
Yesterday, you only had 300,000 followers.

495
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,558
Take more of the videos. We'll release them accordingly.

496
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:41,680
Okay.

497
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:47,479
(So cute!)

498
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,680
(I've discovered a treasure.)

499
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:02,119
Pick a flower casually

500
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,798
("Blue Galaxy", 86,000 people wants to watch)

501
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:07,960
("Blue Galaxy", 8.2 rating)

502
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:10,200
Look at the numbers. Not bad.

503
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,639
- Hello, Mr. Ye. - Mr. Ye.

504
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,359
How are the numbers for today's short video?

505
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:17,039
Mr. Ye, take a look.

506
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,479
Wen Xiao Nuan's video has the most views today.

507
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,480
It's number one again.

508
00:26:20,481 --> 00:26:22,240
"Blue Galaxy" is also the most talked about.

509
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,278
Big names in Huangmei opera have also shared the videos.

510
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,758
They're all supporting Wen Xiao Nuan.

511
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:28,439
Recently, Huangmei operas...

512
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,079
have been getting a lot of views online.

513
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,038
What about the attendance rate of "Blue Galaxy" at Aurora Film?

514
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:35,838
It's up ten percent from last week.

515
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:37,880
And the demographic is getting younger.

516
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,719
Look. The snobby boss seems to have become gentler lately.

517
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,799
Yes, I think he was smiling just now.

518
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,160
He's so handsome.

519
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,720
How nice.

520
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,160
Don't we have any events today?

521
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,519
There are no promotional events today.

522
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,079
I'm giving you a day off.

523
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,440
Day off?

524
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:05,479
I'm not done training yet.

525
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,759
I have to go back.

526
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,400
You've been in the practice room for days.

527
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:10,640
- Get some rest. - Look.

528
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:12,679
Excuse me, are you Ms. Wen Xiao Nuan?

529
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,239
My goodness. I can't believe I met you here.

530
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,440
- My goddess, Wen Xiao Nuan.
- I really like you.

531
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,440
- Can I take a photo with you?
- I really like you.

532
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:20,759
I'll always support you, Wen Xiao Nuan.

533
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:22,558
I want to take a photo too.

534
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:23,759
Wen Xiao Nuan, look over here.

535
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:27,759
Excuse me.

536
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,119
- Wen Xiao Nuan, don't go. - Don't go.

537
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,519
Wen Xiao Nuan.

538
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,759
It's good.

539
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:48,720
The way you acted just now...

540
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,759
is not like you.

541
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,119
Didn't you want to make our relationship public?

542
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,239
Making our relationship public...

543
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,519
has always been part of my plan.

544
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,119
But not right now.

545
00:27:58,519 --> 00:27:59,839
Now is a crucial time.

546
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:01,920
It's also the rising period of your career.

547
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,759
If we make our relationship public now,

548
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,880
everyone will ignore or even deny your efforts.

549
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:08,880
They'll think that everything you have today...

550
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,559
is because of Anning.

551
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,680
Ye Fei Mo.

552
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:19,519
I'm who I am today...

553
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,119
because of you.

554
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,799
Because of you,

555
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:26,720
the board agreed to use the videos on Huangmei opera...

556
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,000
and do something new.

557
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,960
Because of you,

558
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:32,079
so many people like me.

559
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:34,640
I told you.

560
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,519
I'll always be by your side.

561
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:41,240
Because you're by my side,

562
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:43,480
I'm not afraid of anything.

563
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,839
(No .2 "Magpie Bridge", No. 4 "Blue Galaxy")

564
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,319
(Aurora Film Distribution Department)

565
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,640
("Blue Galaxy")

566
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:08,119
Jiang Fang.

567
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,319
Who do you take me for?

568
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,759
- Hello, Ms. Jiang. - Hello, Ms. Jiang.

569
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:25,319
Mr. Jiang.

570
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,480
I'm asking you.

571
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,078
You tried so hard to get me to sign with Aurora Film.

572
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:32,400
You said you would use all your resources to support me.

573
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:36,400
Is this your sincerity?

574
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:37,519
Ms. Han.

575
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:39,239
The word of mouth of a movie...

576
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,720
is not under anyone's control.

577
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,038
"Magpie Bridge" has a good word of mouth and influence.

578
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,880
Why are you so hung up on "Blue Galaxy"?

579
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,079
You know what I'm talking about.

580
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,239
Both movies were released at the same time.

581
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,479
But you insist on 100 percent screening of "Blue Galaxy".

582
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,720
Is this how you support your fellow artists?

583
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,199
I've told you before.

584
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,999
That's the agreement between us and Anning.

585
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,240
I have to abide by it. I can't break the contract.

586
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:04,640
Why do I feel like...

587
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,319
you still have feelings for Wen Xiao Nuan?

588
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:09,240
I think you're using your position...

589
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:11,400
to make your ex-girlfriend popular.

590
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:13,640
You're just like Jiang Ling Er.

591
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,999
I'm Aurora Film's executive. I have to do this.

592
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,999
I can't let people say that Aurora Film goes back on its word...

593
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,319
and treats the contract like garbage.

594
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,879
Besides, if "Blue Galaxy" does well in the box office,

595
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,959
Aurora Film will also profit.

596
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,720
This means my decision isn't wrong.

597
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:25,160
Mr. Jiang.

598
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:27,839
Don't forget who you are.

599
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,599
You're Aurora Film's future son-in-law.

600
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,119
Have you thought about this?

601
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,400
If you do this,

602
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,519
what will Jiang Ling Er think?

603
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:36,640
Ms. Han.

604
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,000
You're just an artist signed by Aurora Film.

605
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:40,759
Don't meddle in other matters.

606
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:42,400
Is that so?

607
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:44,359
If people find out...

608
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:45,879
about the entanglement...

609
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,599
between you, Wen Xiao Nuan, and Ms. Jiang,

610
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:50,518
and that the future son-in-law of Aurora Film...

611
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:53,240
is abusing the company's resources for his ex-girlfriend,

612
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,480
what do you think would happen then?

613
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,559
Ms. Jiang would be put in a difficult place.

614
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,839
And what would Mr. Jiang think?

615
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,799
Ms. Jiang, this is...

616
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,880
This is evidence of Ye Fei Mo and Wen Xiao Nuan's relationship.

617
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:21,480
Ms. Jiang, you mean...

618
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:24,559
It's such a big scoop.

619
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,799
I'm sure it will be sensational.

620
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:29,680
I understand what you mean.

621
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,960
Don't worry, you'll be satisfied.

622
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:43,039
You want to embarrass me?

623
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,759
It won't be that easy.
