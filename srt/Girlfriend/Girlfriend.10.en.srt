1
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:10,439
Today, I would like to update everyone...

2
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,810
on the recent business progress of the company.

3
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,810
With the cooperation...

4
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,560
of everyone in the company,

5
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,879
Anning's most important project...

6
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:21,639
this year,

7
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,560
"Blue Galaxy",

8
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:25,319
has successfully launched.

9
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,090
Filming will begin soon.

10
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,599
Furthermore,

11
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,639
when "Blue Galaxy" is released,

12
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,960
we will get 100 percent...

13
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,000
of Aurora's theatrical release.

14
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,198
Aurora will also give up its share of the first week's box office...

15
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:43,280
for promotional expenses.

16
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,080
The agreement has been signed.

17
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,000
It has been filed with the Legal Department.

18
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:55,918
We were able to get 100 percent...

19
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:58,680
of Aurora's theatrical release...

20
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,680
mainly thanks to one person.

21
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:08,240
That person is...

22
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,960
my executive assistant, Mr. Lin.

23
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:15,120
He helped Mr. Jiang of Aurora...

24
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,400
steal the fake script I prepared on purpose.

25
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,839
That's why Aurora...

26
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,719
registered a fake "Blue Galaxy".

27
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,080
That's how I was able to obtain a series of evidence...

28
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,639
to make them sign this screening agreement.

29
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,840
Mr. Ye, I...

30
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,159
Mr. Lin.

31
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:36,039
You're the hero of Anning.

32
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,719
Mr. Ye,

33
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,800
I didn't work with Jiang Fang.

34
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:39,840
Don't be nervous.

35
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:41,879
I'll reward you.

36
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:44,400
Of course,

37
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:46,479
there is also...

38
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:48,039
our Vice President Chen...

39
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,039
and Mr. Li.

40
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,599
Starting now,

41
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,800
you have one hour...

42
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,400
to pack up your things...

43
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,919
and leave Anning.

44
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,400
Otherwise,

45
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:01,919
you'll bear the consequences.

46
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:03,960
Mr. Ye,

47
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,479
please give me another chance.

48
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:06,919
- I promise... - Especially you.

49
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,960
Mr. Lin.

50
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,680
Come in.

51
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,399
Mr. Ye, I'm Maggie.

52
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,800
I'll be taking over Mr. Lin's duties from now on.

53
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:44,240
These are the documents you must approve today.

54
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:48,519
These need to be approved this week.

55
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:50,920
As my special assistant,

56
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:52,959
work more, talk less.

57
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,170
- Understand? - Yes.

58
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:56,839
Get out.

59
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,170
Take a look.

60
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,559
My goodness.

61
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,679
(It's so cliche, but I envy this lucky girl! I wish it were me!)

62
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,759
(Dream on! But Ye Fei Mo really kept her under tight wraps.)

63
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,279
What's going on?

64
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:10,609
Who is this girl?

65
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,639
I don't know.

66
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,279
Maggie, did you see the gossip in the group chat?

67
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,479
The picture of Mr. Ye's kiss.

68
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,560
I left the group chat.

69
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,198
It's such big news.

70
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:19,560
Don't you want to know?

71
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:20,959
I'm not interested.

72
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:37,319
What did she say?

73
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,839
Nothing much.

74
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:41,800
She just insisted that I return it to you.

75
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,800
Give it back to her.

76
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,560
Let her handle it herself.

77
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,240
If she wants to return it,

78
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,839
out of procedure or courtesy,

79
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,480
she should be the one standing here.

80
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,839
Mr. Ye,

81
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,240
after all,

82
00:05:58,241 --> 00:05:59,800
this is your personal business.

83
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,519
I shouldn't get involved.

84
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,040
If there's nothing else,

85
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,759
I'll get back to work.

86
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,600
Hi, Xiao Kai.

87
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,600
Hi, Xiao Nuan.

88
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,279
I have good news for you.

89
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,560
I've raised enough money.

90
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:41,398
I'll wire it to you tomorrow.

91
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:42,639
Hurry up and pay off the debt.

92
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,120
Okay, Xiao Nuan.

93
00:06:44,121 --> 00:06:45,240
It must've been hard on you.

94
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:46,399
It's nothing.

95
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,240
Take care of yourself.
Don't worry about me.

96
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:49,519
Take care of yourself.

97
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:21,120
Look.

98
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,439
This view of the Milky Way...

99
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,720
is so beautiful.

100
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,160
It has been a long time...

101
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:30,958
since I've cleared my mind,

102
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,079
not thought about anything,

103
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,399
and just looked at the stars.

104
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:35,680
It's really comfortable.

105
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,800
Seriously?

106
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,959
Why are you always so cold?

107
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,120
Haven't you ever felt anything?

108
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:06,480
But there's a method to everything.

109
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,000
You can't empathize too much.

110
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:11,399
It's the same with movies and people.

111
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:55,210
It still doesn't taste right.

112
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,559
Find another shop.

113
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,039
All right.

114
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:13,960
What do you want?

115
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
How is she lately?

116
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:22,450
Who?

117
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,330
Wen Xiao Nuan, right?

118
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:29,999
How would I know if you don't know?

119
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,090
I don't know her that well.

120
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:32,360
Get out.

121
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,330
But I know her best friend.

122
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,360
Come back.

123
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,960
Her name is Wang Jia Yi.

124
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,159
She's Aurora's artist.

125
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:44,840
Wen Xiao Nuan is staying with her.

126
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:48,450
Give me a day off.

127
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:50,638
I promise I'll investigate...

128
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:52,398
Wen Xiao Nuan's situation for you.

129
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,119
Okay, I can give you a day off.

130
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,120
Make up for it this weekend.

131
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,879
I'm helping you.

132
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,480
You're making me work overtime?

133
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,119
Don't think I don't know...

134
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,960
who you kept looking at during the banquet.

135
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,210
It's done. Nice.

136
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:20,210
What do you think?

137
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:23,000
What smells so good?

138
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:24,799
I think you're talking about this.

139
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:27,360
Here, smell it.

140
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,039
- Yes, it's this. - Right?

141
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,038
This is recommended by our boss.

142
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:34,960
It's Adolf Smooth and Silky Shampoo.

143
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:36,119
It smells really good.

144
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,209
Let me put it this way.

145
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:40,039
If you use it, your charm will go through the roof.

146
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,799
- Not bad. - Not bad, right?

147
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,759
Let me ask you.

148
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,719
Do Aurora's artists...

149
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,360
often come here to get their hair done?

150
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:49,679
Yes.

151
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,360
There's a girl named Wang Jia Yi.

152
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,450
Do you know her?

153
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:54,120
Wang Jia Yi?

154
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,840
Wang Jia Yi?

155
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,519
Are you talking about her?

156
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,039
Quick.

157
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:08,639
I have an appointment.

158
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,799
Okay, this way, please. Let's wash your hair first.

159
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,200
We have a customer.

160
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,798
Do you want me to apply for a card?

161
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:19,919
- Of course. - Diamond card, maximum amount.

162
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,320
Of course I would like that.

163
00:11:21,321 --> 00:11:23,200
I'll buy a truckload of Adolf shampoo too.

164
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,519
That's great.

165
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,759
Take off your clothes.

166
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:28,919
Take... Take off my clothes?

167
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:41,799
Hello, Ms. Wang.

168
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,559
Why are you here?

169
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:47,840
It's a part-time job.

170
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:51,600
How badly do you need money?

171
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,240
Then can we...

172
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,480
Down here.

173
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,240
Yes.

174
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,120
Sorry.

175
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,399
I'm sorry.

176
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,320
I'll just get a trim.

177
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,480
Okay.

178
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,559
Trim.

179
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,960
Trim.

180
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,439
A little less.

181
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,440
A little less.

182
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,600
Okay.

183
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,720
A little less.

184
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:25,759
Ms. Wang,

185
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:27,919
that day at the banquet,

186
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:30,360
was the girl next to Mr. Ye your friend?

187
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:31,720
I saw you two chatting.

188
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:34,200
You're talking about Wen Xiao Nuan, right?

189
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,200
How is she lately?

190
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:39,360
Why aren't you two together?

191
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,600
Do you like her?

192
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,279
No.

193
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,039
Why would I like her?

194
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,719
It's just that...

195
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,239
she stole the limelight at the banquet,

196
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,839
and she's Ye Fei Mo's girlfriend.

197
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,799
She's not Ye Fei Mo's girlfriend.

198
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:56,240
Ye Fei Mo...

199
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:58,240
doesn't seem like someone to mess with.

200
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,240
I wish...

201
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,720
Nuan Nuan would stay away from him.

202
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,840
What's so bad about Ye Fei Mo?

203
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,679
That guy is just a paper tiger.

204
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:07,039
He's easy to deal with.

205
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:09,120
"That guy"?

206
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,879
Do you know him well?

207
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,279
No.

208
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:22,639
I've been Director Li Can's driver a few times.

209
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,320
They're good friends.

210
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:26,399
So I met him a few times.

211
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:28,320
I don't know him well at all.

212
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:32,479
But when I saw him the other day,

213
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,639
he seemed to be in low spirits.

214
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,960
Did he have a fight...

215
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,200
with your friend?

216
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:41,759
I'm not sure what exactly happened.

217
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:43,758
Nuan Nuan...

218
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:45,799
probably hasn't figured out what her heart wants yet.

219
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,960
Sometimes,

220
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,440
you can see your heart clearly...

221
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:57,320
just with one look.

222
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,600
How much longer do you need?

223
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,600
You've been cutting for two hours.

224
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,519
I'm almost done.

225
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,120
You...

226
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,240
It's done.

227
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:39,840
Thank you.

228
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:42,039
Han Hui,

229
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,200
I have something to tell you.

230
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:57,840
What is it?

231
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,599
I just got the news.

232
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,399
Mr. Ye broke up with Wen Xiao Nuan.

233
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,120
Is the news accurate?

234
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,039
Absolutely.

235
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,600
Wen Xiao Nuan has moved out...

236
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:10,080
of Mr. Ye's villa.

237
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,120
I knew it.

238
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,919
She and Fei Mo wouldn't last.

239
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:21,919
Even if she looks like me,

240
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,559
she's still not me.

241
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,879
You're Mr. Ye's first love.

242
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,518
After he broke up with you,

243
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,039
he hasn't been with another woman.

244
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,158
He must have found Wen Xiao Nuan...

245
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,759
to spite you this time.

246
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,879
Now that the original is back,

247
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,039
naturally, she stepped down.

248
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,038
Fei Mo and I...

249
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:42,840
have so many memories together.

250
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:44,879
And I can help him.

251
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,120
That Wen Xiao Nuan...

252
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,559
is not capable at all.

253
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:02,399
Okay, cut.

254
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:12,799
Thank you, everyone.

255
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,079
Thank you, everyone.

256
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:16,480

Thank you, Director.

259
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,599
I think this one is good.

260
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:32,200
It's okay, I think.

(Transfer, 1,000 yuan)

262
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,680
Hello?

263
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,680
Ms. Wen Xiao Nuan,

264
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,038
the director wants me to inform you...

265
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:51,359
to come and play a role tomorrow.

266
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Really?

267
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,039
Okay, I'll be there tomorrow.

268
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:56,359
Thank you.

269

270
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,000
Yes!

Let's go.

272
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,240
Fei Mo,

273
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:23,559
I've paid a huge price this time...

274
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:24,798
to bring you...

275
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,410
this valuable information.

276
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,079
You got injured while flirting,

277
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,410
not while working.

278
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,410
Tell me if you have any news.

279
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,200
If that's what you think,

280
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:35,759
this is the last time I'll help you.

281
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:36,890
Tell me.

282
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,480
Wang Jia Yi said...

283
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:40,999
Wen Xiao Nuan already has someone she likes.

284
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,359
She doesn't know who it is.

285
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,559
But it's not you.

286
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:48,079
Ms. Han Hui accepted my invitation...

287
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:50,000
and returned to our homeland...

288
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,839
Yes, I do want to get back together with him.

289
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:58,319
I do still love him.

290
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,079
Whether he has a girlfriend or not, I still love him.

291
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,240
Fei Mo, what's wrong?

292
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
If you ask me,

293
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,239
knowing how Wen Xiao Nuan really feels...

294
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,240
is a good thing.

295
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:24,439
It's better to aim at the right target...

296
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,240
than to rush around blindly.

297
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:30,558
She already has someone she likes,

298
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,170
so stop pestering her.

299
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,079
It's beneath you. Right?

300
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,599
- Jia Yi. - Nuan Nuan.

301
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,240
Come.

302
00:19:48,241 --> 00:19:49,279
Slowly.

303
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:56,119
Jia Yi.

304
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,518
I went from historical to modern sets today.

305
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:01,759
I was in three productions. Isn't that amazing?

306
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,119
Why are you still working so hard?

307
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,319
You're taking on so many jobs.

308
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,889
To make more money, of course,

309
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,440
to help with the troupe's expenses.

310
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,410
The troupe is safe now.

311
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,799
It's time to think about your own plans.

312
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,240
Don't you have a role you want to play?

313
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:23,000
Of course, there are many roles I want to play.

314
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,440
But I don't know which one suits me.

315
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,039
You can sign with an agency.

316
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:30,720
They can help you plan.

317
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,359
Why don't you come to Aurora too?

318
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,799
No, Jiang Fang...

319
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,960
It's okay. I know you mean well.

320
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:41,839
How about Shiliang Culture?

321
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:44,480
They treat their artists well.

322
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,759
What about Liju Films?

323
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:48,240
They've been growing rapidly over the years.

324
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:50,999
And Qingxin Films and Reliang Group...

325
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,039
are also pretty good.

326
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:54,999
You must have mentioned...

327
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,240
all the film companies.

328
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,719
But I think I'm forgetting...

329
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,680
someone's favorite company.

330
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:04,890
What?

331
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,409
If I had a favorite company,

332
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:07,650
I would've stopped worrying about it a long time ago.

333
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,680
Don't you like Anning?

334
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:12,650
They're the best in everything.

335
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:15,440
Anning is Ye Fei Mo's company.

336
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,839
I don't want anything to do with Ye Fei Mo anymore.

337
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,599
Jia Yi, I know you're good to me.

338
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:24,999
The best thing you can do for me now...

339
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,890
is to let me lie in your arms for a while longer.

340
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,240
Okay.

345
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,480
Mr. Ye,

346
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,039
Wen Xiao Nuan submitted her resume.

347
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:19,519
Her resume is so perfunctory.

348
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:20,759
Subtract points for a bad attitude.

349
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,559
Mr. Ye,

350
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:26,559
through my interactions with Wen Xiao Nuan,

351
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,118
I really feel...

352
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:29,960
that she has the potential to be an outstanding artist.

353
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,358
So when she returned the necklace,

354
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:33,879
I made her an offer.

355
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,440
I hope she can join Anning Culture.

356
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:37,880
I think when she submitted her resume this time,

357
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:40,960
she must have thought about it carefully before deciding.

358
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:43,079
You have a point.

359
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,799
Prepare an S-class artist contract for her at once.

360
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,720
S-class.

361
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,559
Mr. Ye, I don't think that's appropriate.

362
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,240
- Wen Xiao Nuan is a rookie. - I know.

363
00:22:56,519 --> 00:22:57,519
It is indeed inappropriate.

364
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,200
I'll go myself.

365
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:06,799
Get ready.

366
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:12,839
S-class?

367
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:14,279
Go.

368
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Wen Xiao Nuan,

369
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:25,319
long time no see.

370
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,720
Wen Xiao Nuan,

371
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,078
I didn't expect you to be so interested...

372
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,160
in Anning Culture.

373
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,799
I'll give you a chance.

374
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,759
Wen Xiao Nuan,

375
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,480
sign this contract.

376
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:50,400
Wen Xiao Nuan.

377
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:54,759
Let's talk.

378
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,279
This is for you.

379
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,039
Me?

380
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:05,799
It's Anning's management contract for S-class artists.

381
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:08,880
Only the top stars can have it.

382
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,439
You're just a rookie actress.

383
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,759
You wouldn't get a chance.

384
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,079
But...

385
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,919
since you so sincerely submitted...

386
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,240
your resume to Anning,

387
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:20,839
I'll reluctantly...

388
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,200
When did I submit my resume?

389
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,359
(Wen Xiao Nuan)

390
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:36,559
I didn't send this.

391
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,799
(Wen Xiao Nuan's resume)

392
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:43,920
Last night?

393
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:47,160
Jia Yi.

394
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,400
If you didn't send it,

395
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,159
then how did your resume...

396
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,639
end up in Anning's inbox?

397
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,960
I didn't send it.

398
00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:55,279
The resume is yours.

399
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,799
The message is yours.

400
00:24:57,799 --> 00:24:59,799
The email came from your email address.

401
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,599
Now you're saying you didn't send it.

402
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:03,880
Mr. Ye,

403
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,239
not everyone...

404
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,720
is interested in joining Anning.

405
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,119
If you came here to see me today because of this,

406
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:11,400
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

407
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:12,599
Then please tell me.

408
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,799
Why aren't you interested?

409
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:16,359
Because of you.

410
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,000
Because of you, I don't want to join Anning.

411
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,759
What a fool.

412
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,200
So because you didn't want to see me,

413
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:29,039
you even asked someone else to return Rose's Tear for you.

414
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,599
Don't you know how precious it is?

415
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:36,039
Why didn't you return it yourself?

416
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:38,279
Since it's so precious,

417
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,920
why didn't you come and get it yourself?

418
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,160
Ye Fei Mo,

419
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,798
are you apologizing to me?

420
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:54,839
What do I have to apologize for?

421
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,400
We're talking about work now.

422
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,118
Don't get your personal feelings involved.

423
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:03,960
But I'm an emotional person.

424
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:07,839
Don't you need money?

425
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,880
You signed a contract with Anning previously.

426
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,400
You performed very well.

427
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:14,240
You can sign another one now...

428
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:15,960
and keep up the good work.

429
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:20,680
It's true...

430
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,200
that we started off in a contractual relationship.

431
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:26,880
When Xiao Jing gave me the documents,

432
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:28,680
she said you were a very difficult person.

433
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,000
But later on,

434
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,440
I found a different side of you.

435
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:38,200
If it hadn't been for that bad start,

436
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,599
you wouldn't have misunderstood me.

437
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,240
I...

438
00:26:44,241 --> 00:26:46,559
While you were helping me fulfill my contract,

439
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:48,759
I didn't get to thank you properly.

440
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,200
I apologize.

441
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:56,079
I didn't return Rose's Tear to you myself.

442
00:26:57,599 --> 00:26:58,640
I apologize.

443
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:01,599
I misunderstood you.

444
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,039
I apologize.
