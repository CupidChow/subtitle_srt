1
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,599
(Ye Fei Mo)

2
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:23,198
We come here with great sincerity...

3
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:25,680
and hope to collaborate with your company.

4
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:28,158
For the starring role,

5
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:29,718
we have contacted...

6
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:33,279
the internationally influential actress,

7
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,680
Ms. Han Hui.

8
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:45,799
She's one of the most successful actresses...

9
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,840
in China.

10
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:49,399
And she also conquered Hollywood audiences.

11
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,400
I disapprove.

12
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:11,199
I disapprove.

13
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,919
- Hello, Ms. Cheng. - Hello, Ms. Cheng.

14
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,560
Mom.

15
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:18,400
You would rather offend Fochs...

16
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:19,800
than use Han Hui.

17
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,158
Many overseas companies...

18
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,639
are watching the Chinese market.

19
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,000
I don't care who I work with.

20
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,039
What? Are you still hung up on Han Hui?

21
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,038
Is she back in China...

22
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,638
because you extended an olive branch?

23
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:34,718
You're overthinking it.

24
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:35,758
Since I'm overthinking it,

25
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:36,878
you should find a girl...

26
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:37,919
and be in a relationship.

27
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,919
I don't want you to get hurt again.

28
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,680
Lin Zheng, help her up.

29
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,680
Okay.

30
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:48,800
Why do I feel that this girl...

31
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,198
is a bit like Han Hui when she had just debuted?

32
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:52,319
A little bit.

33
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,239
Recently, Han Hui and the crew of "Storm Sniper"...

34
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,639
walked the red carpet together at the Cannes Film Festival.

35
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:01,119
She's the frontrunner for the Best Female Lead.

36
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,680
Han Hui is really coming back to China.

37
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:03,879
As far as I know,

38
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,758
she has already contacted...

39
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:07,639
a few top production companies in China.

40
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,719
Ever since Fei Mo broke up with Han Hui,

41
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,879
he hasn't dated anyone.

42
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,960
I'm worried...

43
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:18,639
You're worried that after Han Hui comes back,

44
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,199
she'll keep pestering Mr. Ye.

45
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,319
We have to do something.

46
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,639
Come in.

47
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,439
Hello, Mr. Ye. I'm your new secretary.

48
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,959
Lin Zheng,

49
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,439
escort this girl out.

50
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,360
Mr. Ye, Ms. Cheng arranged this. I...

51
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,319
You'll lose your job if she is my secretary.

52
00:04:58,879 --> 00:04:59,920
Please.

53
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,360
Is everything all right?

54
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,560
I can't seem to get up.

55
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,639
I mean, is my car all right?

56
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,839
My dashcam recorded everything.

57
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:24,240
You jumped out of nowhere.

58
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,360
Tell my mom not to play these tricks again.

59
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,199
Hello.

60
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:37,040
(Big Princess)

61
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,600
Didn't you want to have a meal with me?

62
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:44,439
Something came up. I can't make it.

63
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:46,480
I asked a girl to keep you company.

64
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,839
Son, she's a nice girl.

65
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,519
She studied with the famous pianist Maxim.

66
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,599
(Sea Feast)

67
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,600
I heard that...

68
00:06:03,601 --> 00:06:06,279
Ms. Cheng has been looking for pretty girls for you lately.

69
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,680
You've rejected all of them.

70
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Is that true?

71
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,199
Nonsense.

72
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,439
You can give them to me if you don't want them.

73
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,639
Do you need it?

74
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,560
The more, the merrier.

75
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,480
But, Fei Mo,

76
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,160
ever since Han Hui left you,

77
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:26,599
there hasn't been a single woman...

78
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,800
by your side all these years.

79
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,600
Are you...

80
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,560
still not over her?

81
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,679
I don't get it. What's so good about Han Hui?

82
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,680
Do you want to fight?

83
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,360
I'll hit you.

84
00:06:38,361 --> 00:06:39,560
As if you can win.

85
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:44,398
I don't like it when you say that.

86
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:45,519
Why don't we...

87
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,920
go outside and give it a try?

88
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:48,000
How childish.

89
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,519
Fei Mo,

90
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,839
you need to listen to others.

91
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,319
We grew up together.

92
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,439
What's so good about Han Hui? Right?

93
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:00,399
Yes, she's a bit tall and has a nice figure.

94
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,120
What are you doing?

95
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,120
I'm going to the restroom.

96
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,839
Jiang Fang!

97
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,959
I knew you would come back.

98
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,600
I don't want you to get hurt again.

99
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:40,839
Lin Zheng, help her up.

100
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:41,839
Okay.

101
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,000
Why do I feel that this girl...

102
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,438
is a bit like Han Hui when she had just debuted?

103
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:49,439
A little bit.

104
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:00,639
Jiang Fang.

105
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,399
- Why are you here? - Eat up.

106
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,480
Let me do it.

107
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,279
Look at you.

108
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,480
Here.

109
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,160
Is it good?

110
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,040
How is it? Did the shoot go well?

111
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:18,439
It's okay.

112
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,879
I'm the main character of the commercial today.

113
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,439
I can tell.

114
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:25,359
You're playing a strawberry, right?

115
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,398
Yes.

116
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:27,638
It's a strawberry milk commercial.

117
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:29,040
Of course, the main character is the strawberry.

118
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:32,558
But I made a few mistakes just now.

119
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,758
The director said...

120
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:35,399
I have to do a good job in a bit.

121
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,600
Nuan Nuan, from now on,

122
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,398
don't take on these jobs.

123
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:42,679
Look how tired you are.

124
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,159
I'm not tired.

125
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:46,210
Advertisements pay quickly.

126
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,679
Your family's Huangmei Opera Troupe...

127
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,879
Just give up on it.

128
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,638
Tell Xiao Kai to close down the troupe...

129
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:55,719
and come to Beijiang...

130
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,960
to take care of you.

131
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,239
The troupe isn't a burden to me.

132
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,839
It's my strong support.

133
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,480
Besides, I still have you.

134
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:05,759
Enough about me.

135
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:07,639
How did it go for you? You went to Aurora today.

136
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:11,480
Aurora?

137
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:15,090
Aurora hired me.

138
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:16,918
Really?

139
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:18,119
Let's celebrate tonight.

140
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,158
What gift do you want?

141
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,209
I don't want a gift. What do you want to eat?

142
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,278
Come on, it's about to start.

143
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,719
Jiang Fang, they're calling me. I'll get going.

144
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,798
You should get back to work too.

145
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:24,879
Okay, take your time.

146
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:26,360
Coming!

147
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:37,038
You can just scan this.

148
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:38,090
Okay.

149
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,839
Can I split it into two payments?

150
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,918
Sure.

151
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:50,719
I'll use my bank card for the remaining half.

152
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,720
Okay.

153
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,000
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

154
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,879
Jiang Fang must not know that I came to see him.

155
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,480
Mr. Jiang doesn't trust me.

156
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,558
Don't worry.

157
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:13,599
As long as I'm here,

158
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,038
the production director position at Aurora...

159
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:16,090
will surely be yours.

160
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:17,330
My brother can't win against me.

161
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,279
Don't worry.

162
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,210
As long as you leave Aurora to me,

163
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,758
I'll make sure that Aurora...

164
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:29,639
becomes the best in the industry.

165
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,559
Jiang Fang.

166
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:02,559
Are you Wen Xiao Nuan?

167
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:04,119
Let me introduce myself.

168
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,158
I'm Jiang Ling Er.

169
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:07,200
I'm the sister of Jiang Hao, the CEO of Aurora.

170
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,480
But you probably know me.

171
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,879
The drama I'm starring in has been trending.

172
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,200
Jiang Fang.

173
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,679
Who is she?

174
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,320
What's wrong with you?

175
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,399
Don't you understand?

176
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:26,959
I'm Jiang Fang's girlfriend.

177
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,440
We're together now.

178
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,279
Girlfriend?

179
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,600
What am I, then?

180
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,000
Nuan Nuan, I...

181
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,519
Ms. Wen Xiao Nuan,

182
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:42,559
do you know you're holding Jiang Fang back?

183
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,758
Jiang Fang is full of talent.

184
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:45,960
He just needs a chance.

185
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,319
I can give him that chance.

186
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,840
You can only hold him back.

187
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,000
If you truly love him,

188
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,799
you should let him go.

189
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,480
So,

190
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,720
you told me before...

191
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,000
not to be burdened by the past.

192
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:08,200
You already think I'm a burden,

193
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,440
don't you?

194
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:13,320
I...

195
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:43,080
Jia Yi.

196
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,839
Nuan Nuan, where are you?

197
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,399
Are you having fun with Jiang Fang?

198
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,919
I'm not with Jiang Fang.

199
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:01,679
Jiang Fang doesn't want me anymore!

200
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:18,440
Jiang Fang!

201
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:21,080
I knew you would come back.

202
00:13:58,159 --> 00:13:59,279
Look.

203
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,440
I bought you a pin.

204
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:03,440
It's to celebrate...

205
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,559
your new job at Aurora.

206
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:08,000
Doesn't it look nice?

207
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,720
Why did you...

208
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:12,039
say you didn't want me...

209
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,039
all of a sudden?

210
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,960
Why did you cheat on me?

211
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,199
I'm talking to you!

212
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,960
Why are you ignoring me?

213
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,519
I'm sorry.

214
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:31,000
Did I hurt you?

215
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:37,159
Weren't you going to the restroom?

216
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,479
This is...

217
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,759
Move her off me. Hurry.

218
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,320
Doesn't she look...

219
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:50,480
Doesn't she look like Han Hui?

220
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,439
By the way, Fei Mo,

221
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,518
the company is in big trouble.

222
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,519
Let's go.

223
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:56,000
Hurry up.

224
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,159
Let's go.

225
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,240
Original footage of "Hannan's Past" was leaked.

226
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,678
Five minutes ago, a 1080p HD version...

227
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:12,720
was uploaded online.

228
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,158
We invested a lot on this movie.

229
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:17,279
It's a huge blow to the box office.

230
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,519
And we won't be able...

231
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,080
to answer to Aurora.

232
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:23,080
Their theaters will be affected too.

233
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:25,720
If we lose this battle,

234
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,639
we'll still be under Aurora's thumb.

235
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:30,840
What should we do?

236
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,639
Don't panic. Let's think about it.

237
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:53,518
Wen Xiao Nuan!

238
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,360
What's wrong with you? Get up.

239
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,918
She has been saying Jiang Fang's name all night.

240
00:15:57,919 --> 00:15:59,039
She has been drinking.

241
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,559
What's going on?

242
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:02,159
You're here.

243
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:03,960
Did you have a fight?

244
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,360
I'll call Jiang Fang now.

245
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:07,919
Don't call him.

246
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,959
What's wrong?

247
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,039
He said...

248
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:12,360
I'm a burden to him.

249
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,480
It's just a little spat. Don't take it to heart.

250
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:18,639
All right.

251
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,719
It's really over this time.

252
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,798
All right.

253
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:22,879
All right, Nuan Nuan.

254
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,600
Let's go. I'll take you home.

255
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:26,879
I'll take you home.

256
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,159
First,

257
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,720
take down all the resources online.

258
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:35,200
Block the distribution channels.

259
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,279
Second,

260
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,600
arrange video updates...

261
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:38,759
and release them as soon as possible.

262
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,038
Third,

263
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:41,960
contact the media for an exclusive interview with me.

264
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:43,638
Maybe we can get sympathy votes...

265
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:44,840
from the public.

266
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,000
That way, we can minimize the damage.

267
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,639
Okay, I'll arrange it right away.

268
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,840
Do as I say.

269
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,159
I have something to do.

270
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:29,559
(Xiao Kai)

271
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,200
(Xiao Kai)

272
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:39,199
Hey, Xiao Kai, what's wrong?

273
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,199
Xiao Nuan, the landlord wants
me to prepare one million yuan.

274
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,279
Otherwise, he'll sell the theater's land.

275
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,920
What?

276
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:47,119
One million yuan?

277
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,650
What should we do now?

278
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,519
Don't worry.

279
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,720
I'll think of something.

280
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:02,078
Three, two, one.

281
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:03,079
Action!

282
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:07,079
Cut!

283
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,200
Fiercer, okay? Fiercer.

284
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,480
Add more water. Let's do it again.

285
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,000
Action!

286
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:15,599
Cut!

287
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,799
Cut!

288
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,170
Fiercer, okay?

289
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:24,439
She's the one who can't act.

290
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,518
I'm sorry. I'll do better.

291
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:27,519
I'm sorry.

292
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,680
Refill the water. Let's go again.

293
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,759
Action.

294
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:39,279
Thank you.

295
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:40,599
Thank you, everyone.

296
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:01,558
Star Painting Jewelry.

297
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:03,318
Purity knows no bounds.

298
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:05,039
Beauty knows no bounds.

299
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,118
Who is this?

300
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:13,838
He spent so much to put up an advertisement here.

301
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:14,839
5203.

302
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,920
Ye Fei Mo?

303
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,999
I'm waiting for you.

304
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,919
He's the boss of Anning Culture.

305
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,680
He's handsomer than all the male celebs in his agency,

306
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:23,319
so he's very famous.

307
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,759
Is this how missing person notices are done now?

308
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:29,680
5203,

309
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:31,119
I'm waiting for you.

310
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,279
Look at this.

311
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,680
I'm waiting for you.

312
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:36,440
5203.

313
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:37,719
- I'm waiting for you.
- It's the CEO of Anning.

314
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,999
Today, Ye Fei Mo, the CEO of Anning Culture,

315
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,319
released a missing person notice.

316
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:44,599
5203.

317
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:46,440
I'm waiting for you.

318
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,680
Yun Zhou.

319
00:19:58,119 --> 00:19:59,759
Fei Mo is such a low-profile person.

320
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,839
Why did he make such a big fuss?

321
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:03,480
What's going on?

322
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:05,799
Well,

323
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:09,200
Fei Mo and I went out to eat that day.

324
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,890
He went to use the restroom.

325
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:12,480
When he came back, he entered the wrong room.

326
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:13,650
He...

327
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,279
He was forcibly kissed...

328
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:17,440
by a girl.

329
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:18,650
Forced?

330
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,838
That girl was drunk.

331
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:22,119
She looked quite sad.

332
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:24,720
Is this girl...

333
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,079
anything special?

334
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,239
That girl...

335
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,440
didn't seem special.

336
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:32,558
Maybe it's because that girl...

337
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:33,720
looks a bit like Han Hui.

338
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,039
Like Han Hui?

339
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:41,118
Why do I feel that this girl...

340
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:42,959
is a bit like Han Hui when she had just debuted?

341
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,960
Thank you.

342
00:20:58,759 --> 00:20:59,759
Hello, Ms. Cheng.

343
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,479
Xiao Jing,

344
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,650
I heard the date of Han Hui's return has been confirmed.

345
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,319
She's coming back in two weeks.

346
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,479
I heard Aurora is throwing...

347
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,960
a grand welcome dinner for her.

348
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:11,479
But don't worry.

349
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,920
Mr. Ye doesn't seem to want to go.

350
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:16,079
I hope he does go.

351
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:20,960
But he can't show up alone.

352
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:22,170
Ms. Cheng,

353
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,559
what do you mean?

354
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:25,240
Help me find someone.

355
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,319
Okay, cut.

356
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:42,920
Okay, thank you.

357
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,079
Take a break.

358
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,239
Thank you.

359
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,598
- Thank you. - Thank you.

360
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:48,318
Thank you, everyone. Good work.

361
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:49,410
Thank you.

362
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,920

363
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:55,598
- Hello. - Anning Culture.

364
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:56,599
Zhou Xiao Jing.

365
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,880
Hello.

366
00:21:58,039 --> 00:21:59,199
Anning Culture?

367
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,479
Do you have a job for me?

368
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,480
Sort of.

369
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:03,118
Let's make a deal.

370
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:04,639
If you can complete the mission,

371
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,759
I'll pay you handsomely.

372
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,920
What kind of deal?

373
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,799
In 15 days,

374
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,240
attend a banquet with Mr. Ye, the CEO of Anning Culture,

375
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,880
as his girlfriend.

376
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,079
Mr. Ye?

377
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,400
Anning Culture's Ye Fei Mo.

378
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:22,960
Ye Fei Mo?

379
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,880
Are you joking with me?

380
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,200
I don't have time...

381
00:22:28,201 --> 00:22:29,640
to come all the way here just to joke with you.

382
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:35,880
I'm sorry.

383
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:38,279
I already have someone I like.

384
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,480
Even though he dumped me,

385
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,999
I won't fall in love with someone else so quickly,

386
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,319
much less date anyone else.

387
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,079
Besides,

388
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:49,839
love can't be traded.

389
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,839
Why don't you look for someone else?

390
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:55,319
Wait.

391
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,400
This is my business card.

392
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:02,079
Call me if you change your mind.

393
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,880
(Zhou Xiao Jing, Artist Brokerage Director)

394
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,200
The video is encrypted,

395
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,839
but it still got leaked.

396
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,480
There must be a mole.

397
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,839
And this mole is quite high-ranking.

398
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,119
Go back to the office tomorrow.

399
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,720
Tell the board that I'm taking a leave.

400
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,079
Tell them I'm sick.

401
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,558
You'll pretend to be sick...

402
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:27,880
so that the mole will give himself away.

403
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:34,160
Did that 5203 girl contact you?

404
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:37,519
No.

405
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,639
There's no other girl...

406
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,200
who doesn't give you the time of day, Ye Fei Mo.

407
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,640
I have to drink to that.

408
00:23:58,839 --> 00:23:59,839
Fei Mo,

409
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,559
who do you think the mole is?

410
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:06,640
I do have a suspect in mind.

411
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:08,880
- Lin Zheng. - Lin Zheng.

412
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:13,640
Then why are you still pretending to be sick?

413
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:15,719
I'm more concerned...

414
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,759
about the person pulling his strings.

415
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,519
While I'm on leave these few days,

416
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,479
he'll have the time and space...

417
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,480
to do something.

418
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:23,839
No.

419
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,519
I think you'll use your sick leave...

420
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,440
to find your 5203 girl.

421
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,359
It's none of your business what I do on my sick leave.

422
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,160
To be honest,

423
00:24:32,161 --> 00:24:33,199
I didn't know you had room...

424
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,480
in your heart for another girl.

425
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,519
I thought you only cared about Han Hui.

426
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:38,680
After all, it was a passionate kiss,

427
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:40,880
the white moonlight that saved your life.

428
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,400
Han Hui isn't her.

429
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,359
Didn't you say she had a butterfly birthmark?

430
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:48,480
That's the only memory you have of her in the water.

431
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:56,079
That's not the only memory.

432
00:24:58,519 --> 00:24:59,599
There's also that kiss.

433
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,440
Maybe this time,

434
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,680
I've really found her.

435
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:21,599
I'm so tired.

436
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,359
Hi, Xiao Kai.

437
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:30,279
Don't move! Put it down!

438
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,358
Xiao Kai, what's wrong?

439
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:34,799
Xiao Nuan, the landlord sent movers!

440
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:37,039
There's a bulldozer outside to level the theater!

441
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,039
Put the landlord on the phone.

442
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,519
Hi, Mr. Dong.

443
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,599
Can you give me more time?

444
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,798
Give me 15 more days.

445
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:46,799
That's all I need.

446
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,119
I'll get you the money.

447
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,919
Okay, for the sake of your parents,

448
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,400
I'll trust you one last time.

449
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,000
Xiao Nuan, I'm also having a hard time.

450
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,079
Don't make things difficult for me.

451
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,480
Okay.

452
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,039
I'm glad you changed your mind.

453
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,200
Xiao Jing,

454
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,640
I have another question.

455
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,039
Well,

456
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,519
why did you pick me?

457
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,799
We have our reasons.

458
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,279
You don't need to know for now.

459
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:45,160
Just tell me.

460
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:47,240
Are you in or not?

461
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,319
I'm in. Of course I'm in.

462
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,960
Deal.

463
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:57,359
This is all the information on Mr. Ye.

464
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,159
Read it all in three days.

465
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,200
Then we'll take action.

466
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,519
That's easy. I can memorize it in a day.

467
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,518
Let me remind you.

468
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:06,359
Mr. Ye has a weak stomach.

469
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:08,440
You need to pay more attention to his diet.

470
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,240
I'll take good care of him.

471
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:11,599
Very good.

Pretend to be a nurse? But I don't have...

It shouldn't matter if I take a look around, right?

This person...

505

really does only drink these two types of sparkling water.

506

Is this any way to live?

00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,519
This handshake is a bit too formal.

514
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,440
Mr. Ye.

515
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,480
Mr. Ye.

516
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,880
Mr. Ye.

517
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:18,880
Mr. Ye.

518
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,480
Mr. Ye.

519
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:24,240
This won't do.

520
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,559
Mr. Ye.
