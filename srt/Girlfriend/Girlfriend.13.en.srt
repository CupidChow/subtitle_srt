1
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,359
I got up half an hour early.

2
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,760
Why can't I get a cab still?

3
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,560
Wen Xiao Nuan,

4
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:53,159
I was afraid all the bikes would get taken,

5
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,120
and it would affect your fitness training,

6
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:57,560
so I specially reserved one for you.

7
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,352
No need to thank me.

8
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,079
Mr. Ye.

9
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,479
Can I get a ride in your car?

10
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:26,810
Why don't you take me to the parking lot?

11
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,199
My time is precious.

12
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,810
What should I do, then?

13
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:33,719
I'm doomed.

14
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:35,479
Mr. Ye.

15
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:42,239
I'm doomed.

16
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,370
What should I do?

17
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,919
Ms. Wen, please get out of the car.

18
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,319
I have to park Mr. Ye's car.

19
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:51,039
Mr. Ye's assistant is opening the door for Wen Xiao Nuan.

20
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,038
Could Wen Xiao Nuan really be...

21
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,159
Mr. Ye's girlfriend?

22
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,360
Why don't I go to the parking lot with you?

23
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,878
I'll be fine on my own.

24
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,000
Ms. Wen, please get out of the car.

25
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,240
(Anning)

26
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,839
Mr. Ye, are you looking for me?

27
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,639
How is Wen Xiao Nuan's training going?

28
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,800
Is she improving?

29
00:04:40,801 --> 00:04:42,560
She's talented and hardworking.

30
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:44,199
The fitness instructor thinks highly of her.

31
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,079
Her physical quality is one thing,

32
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,639
but her perspective and experience are also important.

33
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:53,730
"Blue Galaxy" is shooting a trailer during these few days.

34
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,240
Make some time to take her to visit the set.

35
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:57,639
Visit the set?

36
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,050
Show her...

37
00:05:00,051 --> 00:05:02,119
what it's like to be on set and be a female lead.

38
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,239
Broaden her horizons.

39
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,519
But Director Li doesn't seem to like anyone visiting the set.

40
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,279
You're not just anyone.

41
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,879
Besides, this is for work.

42
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:13,000
Do it under my name.

43
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,730
I'll talk to Li Can.

44
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,000
As Wen Xiao Nuan's manager,

45
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:18,519
you have to make her understand...

46
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:20,050
the level she should be at...

47
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,610
as Anning's S-class artist.

48
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,120
Okay, I'll arrange it right away.

49
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:45,398
Hanging fruit

50
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:48,799
On the shelf

51
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,879
Cut.

52
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,959
Bai Xiu Wen.

53
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,480
Pay attention to your character's state.

54
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,198
Okay, let's pay attention to the character's state.

55
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,240
Let's do it again.

56
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:15,958
Hanging fruit

57
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:21,560
On the shelf

58
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:25,360
The wind blows...

59
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Cut.

60
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,959
What are you singing?

61
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:30,439
Where's the aria and gait?

62
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:33,318
Director, you can dub it later.

63
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:34,319
We don't have to sing for real.

64
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,398
It doesn't matter.

65
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:36,679
Your role has to complete...

66
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,800
all the aria and gait.

67
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Isn't it the most basic quality of an actor...

68
00:06:39,001 --> 00:06:40,559
to fulfill their role well?

69
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,919
Director, this opera...

70
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,480
requires a certain level of skill.

71
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,039
But I don't have that background.

72
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,800
I'm doing very well already.

73
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,679
A month ago, I hired a teacher to teach you, didn't I?

74
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,878
But you were either slacking off or participating in activities.

75
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:53,999
You didn't go to a single class.

76
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What do you want?

77
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,758
Director, please understand me.

78
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:58,239
I'm already trying my best.

79
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,078
Huangmei opera is really hard to learn.

80
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:02,318
Any random person here can be better than you. Do you believe me?

81
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,240
Then go ahead.

82
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:06,399
Who can sing Huangmei opera?

83
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,399
Step forward!

84
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:08,399
Me!

85
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,959
Little nurse?

86
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,759
Hello, Director Li.

87
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,319
Come here.

88
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:25,719
Improvise and seize the opportunity.

89
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,199
It's a must-have quality for an S-class artist.

90
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,399
You can do it.

91
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,000
I still remember.

92
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,560
"Jump in..."

93
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,920
"and I'll let you be the female lead."

94
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,240
Give it a try first.

95
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,439
M...Me?

96
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,680
Try it.

97
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,759
Get ready.

98
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:01,839
Three, two, one.

99
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,040
Action.

100
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:08,239
Let's see how she sings.

101
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:14,078
Hanging fruit

102
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:19,439
On the shelf

103
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:27,398
The wind blows the rice

104
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:33,330
And the sea dances the golden waves

105
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:41,158
I ask the crescent moon in the sky

106
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:48,039
Who can be better than my Cowherd?

107
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:53,330
Bravo!

108
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:55,330
- Good. - Thank you.

109
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,450
Very good.

110
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:59,330
Based on that performance,

111
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:01,879
you are the Weaver Girl herself.

112
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,360
Xiu Wen, what do you think?

113
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,599
What can I think?

114
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,329
If you think she's the Weaver Girl herself,

115
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:11,360
then let her do it.

116
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,960
What am I doing here?

117
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:15,879
Let's go.

118
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:19,879
She's not doing it.

119
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:21,960
You do it.

120
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:23,879
Me?

121
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,679
I can't. Director, I can't do it.

122
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,000
I... I can't do it.

123
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:28,479
Director,

124
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,559
she can do it.

125
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:32,120
Xiao Jing?

126
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,360
What are you doing here?

127
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:35,518
Wen Xiao Nuan is now...

128
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,039
Anning's S-class artist.

129
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,120
Mr. Ye asked me to bring her to visit the set.

130
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:42,039
I should thank you for giving her a chance.

131
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,210
Don't thank me yet.

132
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:45,159
Who the female lead is...

133
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,519
is not up to me.

134
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,159
I have to ask Wen Xiao Nuan what she thinks.

135
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:51,559
The opinion of the investors is important too.

136
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,919
She is very grateful to you for giving her this opportunity.

137
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:55,278
And on behalf of Anning,

138
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,559
I would like to sincerely and responsibly express...

139
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,039
that we highly agree with you.

140
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,000
Wen Xiao Nuan,

141
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,600
this is a difficult role.

142
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,000
You're talented for a rookie.

143
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,159
But if you want to play this role well,

144
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,559
you'll still have to work hard.

145
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:19,240
You can give it a try.

146
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,759
But let me make this clear.

147
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:22,759
If you don't meet my expectations,

148
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,559
I'll replace you at any time.

149
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:26,879
Do you want to try?

150
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,090
Yes.

151
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:38,840
Director, I'll do my best.

152
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:42,239
(Loud noises strictly prohibited)

153
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,360
It must've been hard for you.

154
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:44,719
- I'm fine. - Have some water.

155
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,759
Okay.

156
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:48,038
Director Li asked you to give "Blue Galaxy" a try.

157
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:49,799
It's a great opportunity for you.

158
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,519
Xiao Jing,

159
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,398
I've never played such an important role before.

160
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,719
There's a first time for everything.

161
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,278
But opportunities only last for three seconds.

162
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,959
That's how this industry works.

163
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,000
It changes in an instant.

164
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,039
Director Li will talk to you tomorrow...

165
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,519
about the movie, "Blue Galaxy".

166
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,038
Read the script thoroughly tonight.

167
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,039
Understand the character...

168
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,360
and seize this opportunity.

169
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:09,639
I'll make good use of it.

170
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,000
That painting earlier was nice. What do you think?

171
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,080
Are you interested?

172
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,798
The composition of the painting is okay.

173
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:16,799
But the concept...

174
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:17,879
is lacking.

175
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:19,878
The artist has been very popular in the past few years.

176
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,120
It has great potential to go up in value.

177
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:23,919
If you want to buy it, go ahead.

178
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:25,999
You know I'm not interested in art speculation.

179
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You said it.

180
00:11:27,001 --> 00:11:28,639
I'll really buy it, then. Don't regret it.

181
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,279
Where are you going?

182
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,399
My clothes.

183
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,080
How much do you earn a day?

184
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:13,840
300 yuan. Why?

185
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,600
I'll give you 3,000 yuan.

186
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,440
What do you want me to do?

187
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,120
Take off your clothes.

188
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,559
You're so cute.

189
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,440
Hey.

190
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,200
Time flies when you're alone in a room full of clouds.

191
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,720
Time flies when you're alone...

192
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,639
Hello, Xiao Jing.

193
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:24,000
How is the script reading going?

194
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,120
I've read it several times.

195
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,519
What do you think?

196
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:30,239
I think this movie...

197
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,840
with elements of Huangmei opera...

198
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,960
was tailor-made for me.

199
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,119
Am I being too arrogant?

200
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,200
No, it's good to have feelings.

201
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,679
You need to practice the Huangmei opera scenes more.

202
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:43,360
That's the best part of the movie.

203
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,480
It's also what Director Li values the most.

204
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:48,278
Why were elements of Huangmei opera...

205
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:50,559
suddenly added to this movie?

206
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,039
This is what Mr. Ye decided at the last meeting.

207
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,479
He said he wants a clash of traditional culture...

208
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,759
and modern culture.

209
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,480
Mr. Ye?

210
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,319
Many of the board members were against it,

211
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,399
but Mr. Ye insisted.

212
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:03,439
He said that emotions are the driving force...

213
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,600
that makes people empathize.

214
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:08,878
Okay, Xiao Jing.

215
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:09,959
I understand.

216
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,039
Don't worry too much.

217
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,878
Get ready and get some rest.

218
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:13,960
Okay, bye.

219
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,720
Huangmei tune?

220
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:28,159
If it were in a movie...

221
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:29,919
What?

222
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,879
Nothing.

223
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:34,000
I think I've found the soul.

224
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:40,840
Could it be?

225
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:56,039
My husband,

226
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,720
take good care of our child.

227
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,120
Cut.

228
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:08,440
Have a seat.

229
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:13,759
Thank you. Get back to work.

230
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:20,079
You must have done your homework...

231
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,480
on the script yesterday.

232
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:23,719
Yes.

233
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,518
Because I really like this script.

234
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,559
There are also elements of Huangmei opera in it.

235
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:29,638
There aren't many young people...

236
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:30,639
who like Huangmei opera these days.

237
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:33,918
It's because the story of Cowherd and Weaver Girl...

238
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:35,039
is a favorite of mine.

239
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,399
No wonder.

240
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,758
During your performance yesterday,

241
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:39,799
your eyes,

242
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,639
vocals, and body language...

243
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,200
were all on point.

244
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,360
Thank you, Director.

245
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,720
Xiao Jing showed me your resume.

246
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:49,240
It looks like you've been in a lot of movies and dramas.

247
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,279
I was just an extra.

248
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:53,799
I didn't have any lines.

249
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:55,679
My face wasn't even shown.

250
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,240
Let me ask you a cliché question.

251
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:01,720
What is your idea of an actor?

252
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,519
Actors bring their characters to life.

253
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:08,119
The roles I've played so far were small,

254
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:10,519
but I took every scene and every role...

255
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,039
very seriously.

256
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:13,799
For an actor your age...

257
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,960
to have that kind of awareness and attitude...

258
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,119
is quite rare.

259
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:20,799
I will tell Fei Mo...

260
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:22,599
that you have a lot of potential.

261
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,480
Director Li.

262
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:31,000
I have a question for you.

263
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:33,319
This might be a bit abrupt.

264
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,240
Did you choose me as the female lead...

265
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,119
because of Mr. Ye?

266
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:44,889
Do you really have no confidence in yourself?

267
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:46,558
Or are you questioning my taste in casting?

268
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,038
No, that's not what I meant.

269
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:50,200
You know, if you are the slightest bit unconfident,

270
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:53,079
it will be shown and magnified by the camera.

271
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:54,960
Do you trust me?

272
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:57,079
Then you should trust yourself too.

273
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,169
I'm sure we'll be able to shoot...

274
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:01,200
an amazing "Blue Galaxy".

275
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:02,480
Okay, Director.

276
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,319
Okay. Is the set ready?

277
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:12,599
Did you hear?

278
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,798
Wen Xiao Nuan has been cast...

279
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:14,839
as the lead actress for "Blue Galaxy".

280
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
No way.

281
00:18:16,001 --> 00:18:18,118
Wen Xiao Nuan has never even played a supporting actress role.

282
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:20,199
How can she be the female lead in Director Li's movie?

283
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,240
Didn't you know?

284
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:22,999
The rumor has spread all over the set.

285
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,759
I heard the character photo shoot is already done.

286
00:18:24,922 --> 00:18:25,759
That's right.

287
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,118
It was a walk in the park for her.

288
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:28,890
Is Wen Xiao Nuan's acting any good?

289
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,170
I heard Mr. Ye handpicked her.

290
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,759
It doesn't matter if she's a good actress.

291
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Don't talk nonsense.

292
00:18:36,001 --> 00:18:37,410
I know what really happened.

293
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,000
- What happened? - Good morning, Mr. Ye.

294
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:41,960
- Good morning, Mr. Ye.
- Good morning, Mr. Ye.

295
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:51,279
Why didn't you tell me?

296
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,410
I didn't know either.

297
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,079
Why are you here, Mr. Ye?

298
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:08,650
You've been full of ideas lately.

299
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:14,410
In your dictionary,

300
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:16,758
is that a good thing or a bad thing?

301
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:17,890
I need an explanation.

302
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,409
The casting of Wen Xiao Nuan...

303
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,999
as the female lead of "Blue Galaxy"...

304
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,200
was Director Li's decision.

305
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,358
We were still auditioning,

306
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:27,038
so I didn't have time to report to you.

307
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,598
If there were to be any changes...

308
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:29,759
to the casting,

309
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:31,650
you should have asked me.

310
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,078
It was so sudden.

311
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:34,410
But don't worry, Mr. Ye.

312
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,518
Wen Xiao Nuan was cast...

313
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:36,889
only because she has potential...

314
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:37,919
and a good fit.

315
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,999
It has nothing to do...

316
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,839
with our personal feelings or selfishness.

317
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,119
Then what's the basis for your decision?

318
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:45,599
First of all,

319
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,759
as Anning's artist director,

320
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,518
it's my duty to provide the best...

321
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:50,889
and most suitable job opportunities...

322
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,079
for artists.

323
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:54,240
I also base my decisions on my professional insight...

324
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,279
and absolute loyalty to Anning Culture.

325
00:19:57,559 --> 00:19:58,890
These are not enough for me.

326
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:02,720
What kind of answer do you want, Mr. Ye?

327
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:04,758
Do you really think...

328
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:06,799
Wen Xiao Nuan doesn't deserve this opportunity?

329
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:11,200
Mr. Ye,

330
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,479
during this time...

331
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,000
that Wen Xiao Nuan and I have been together,

332
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,000
she never ceased to surprise me.

333
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,199
Her performance on set yesterday...

334
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,278
was also very impressive.

335
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:20,720
Director Li couldn't stop praising her.

336
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,720
Mr. Ye,

337
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,200
I believe Wen Xiao Nuan can do it.

338
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,200
But Anning's interests...

339
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,720
can't rely on your feelings.

340
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,240
I trust your judgment.

341
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:32,890
But I need more assurance.

342
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,079
Mr. Ye, what do you mean?

343
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:36,960
Data doesn't lie.

344
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:38,719
Let Wen Xiao Nuan star...

345
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,039
in the trailer of "Blue Galaxy".

346
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,518
I want her to get the same number of likes and shares...

347
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:45,039
to be the same as those of the current top ten actresses.

348
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,200
If she achieves that,

349
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:47,559
she can play the female lead.

350
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:49,439
But Mr. Ye,

351
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,440
this is a tall order for Wen Xiao Nuan.

352
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,890
She's just a rookie.

353
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:54,118
She doesn't have any works.

354
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,279
The audience doesn't know her.

355
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:56,650
A trailer is a work.

356
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,519
If our resources...

357
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:00,038
and Director Li Can's talent...

358
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:02,240
are not enough to make Wen Xiao Nuan known to everyone,

359
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:03,959
then she's not suitable...

360
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,480
to play the female lead in "Blue Galaxy".

361
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,720
Mr. Ye,

362
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,079
we'll do our best.

363
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,759
In three days,

364
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,599
show me the proposal for the trailer.

365
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:17,599
No problem.

366
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:19,890
("Blue Galaxy" Trailer, Male Lead Casting Meeting)

367
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:23,519
There's a kissing scene?

368
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,758
Mr. Ye,

369
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:29,959
before we planned the trailer,

370
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,518
we got the opinions of Director Li...

371
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:33,410
and the Operations Department.

372
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:35,200
In the end, we all agreed...

373
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:36,479
that adding this kiss scene...

374
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,318
could play up the core highlights...

375
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:39,319
of our trailer.

376
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:40,839
It can also increase the marketing element.

377
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,358
Also, we conducted a statistical survey...

378
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:44,599
on all domestic movie trailers...

379
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:46,170
in the last three years.

380
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:47,559
The result showed that...

381
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,558
the internet traffic for trailers with kissing scenes...

382
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:51,519
was about 30 percent higher than those without kissing scenes.

383
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,679
In order to meet the target...

384
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,119
you set for us,

385
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:57,079
we included this kissing scene.

386
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,920
Let's move on...

387
00:22:04,921 --> 00:22:06,160
to the profiles of the male lead candidates.

388
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Next.

389
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,240
Next.

390
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:39,079
Next.

391
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,960
Mr. Ye, that's all.

392
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:45,680
Why don't we look over it again?

393
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:53,159
Mr. Ye, these are the most suitable male lead candidates...

394
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,200
that I could find.

395
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:56,919
In such a tight timeframe,

396
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,959
we need to find someone who meets your requirements...

397
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,279
in all aspects of popularity,

398
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:02,880
looks, acting, and availability.

399
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,039
I think it's nearly impossible.

400
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,680
That's not true.

401
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:13,000
Isn't there a suitable candidate right in front of us?

402
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,200
You just mentioned...

403
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,118
looks, acting,

404
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:25,440
popularity, and availability.

405
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,640
Doesn't Fei Mo check all the boxes?

406
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,240
I think Ms. Cheng is right.

407
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,440
In terms of popularity and looks,

408
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,400
no one can beat Mr. Ye.

409
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,519
I think it's decided.

410
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:43,680
We'll start filming in three days.

411
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:50,400
It's doable.

412
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,960
There's no problem with the proposal.

413
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,480
But the target numbers that Fei Mo set for this trailer...

414
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,680
are too high.

415
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:09,720
After all, Wen Xiao Nuan is a rookie.

416
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:11,400
Wen Xiao Nuan is a rookie,

417
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:13,039
but her manager isn't.

418
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,920
Han Hui was a rookie back then.

419
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:17,880
- We... - Us back then.

420
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,680
I haven't forgotten.

421
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,919
The day we agreed on...

422
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,920
is getting closer.

423
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,559
Director Li,

424
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,960
can we not talk about matters unrelated to work?

425
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:35,400
Okay, we won't.

426
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:39,679
So now we...

427
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,880
Now we are...

428
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,960
You're a famous director in China.

429
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,759
And I'm still a professional agent.

430
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:47,799
To me,

431
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,518
the most important thing right now...

432
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:50,879
is to help my artist, Wen Xiao Nuan,

433
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,959
secure this female lead role...

434
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,559
that I believe is perfect for her.

435
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,279
Xiao Jing,

436
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,720
it's like I'm seeing your old self again.

437
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,480
Determined.

438
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:01,680
Refreshing.

439
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,759
Can we just talk?

440
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:11,640
You already have a plan, right?

441
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:13,319
There's a charity show tomorrow.

442
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,679
A lot of famous actors, including Han Hui,

443
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,719
will be there.

444
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,839
Wen Xiao Nuan will be there too.

445
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,960
One, it'll generate buzz for her in advance.

446
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,839
Two, I'll train her...

447
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:23,279
to face the public.

448
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,160
Jia Yi, I'm so glad you're here.

449
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:49,559
What's wrong?

450
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:52,839
Are you okay?

451
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:56,839
Han Hui!

452
00:25:58,559 --> 00:25:59,599
Han Hui!

453
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,240
Han Hui, do you remember me?

454
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,839
Wen Xiao Nuan has no manners.

455
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,160
She's always playing dumb to attract attention.

456
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,400
Okay, come on.

457
00:26:25,401 --> 00:26:26,639
Let's take a group photo in the middle.

458
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,680
Time for a group photo.

459
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,880
Okay, look at the camera.

460
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:30,400
Look here.

461
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,440
Come on, gather in the middle.

462
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:38,319
Jia Yi, are you okay?

463
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,000
- I'm fine. - Come on.

464
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:42,319
Three, two, one.

465
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,319
How is it? Does it still hurt?

466
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:53,079
It's okay. It's all right.

467
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:05,160
Is it better?

468
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,440
It's a bit better.

469
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:19,559
How can there be...

470
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,079
such a low-class lounge?

471
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,920
There are even random people here.

472
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:26,519
Nuan Nuan, let's go.

473
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,200
This is a public lounge.

474
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,160
What a knucklehead.

475
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:40,000
Didn't you see what others did?

476
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,959
Jia Yi's leg is injured.

477
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,599
Can't we take a break here?

478
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,079
Han Hui.

479
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:52,479
Jia Yi sprained her ankle, so she's resting here.

480
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,559
Is that okay?

481
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,399
I didn't know there would be other people...

482
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,720
in this lounge.

483
00:27:57,319 --> 00:28:00,079
Linda, let them rest here.

484
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,240
Thank you.

485
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,039
Nuan Nuan.

486
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,519
Why don't we...

487
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,680
Let's go.

488
00:28:07,681 --> 00:28:09,358
- Newbies these days... - Take a break.

489
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:11,079
are getting ruder and ruder.

490
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:13,880
Ling Er.

491
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:15,079
Let's go.

492
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,400
I was looking for you.

493
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:31,279
Who's the organizer of this event?

494
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:32,400
What are they doing?

495
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:35,240
How could they arrange for you to be in the public lounge...

496
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:36,920
with low-level actors?

497
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,559
It's okay. I just returned to China.

498
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,759
This treatment is good enough.

499
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:45,479
Some people think they're all that...

500
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,558
because they have a big company...

501
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:47,720
backing them up.

502
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:52,559
And you.

503
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,119
You're a traitor.

504
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,799
Why are you pretending to be hurt?

505
00:28:57,559 --> 00:28:58,559
Nuan Nuan.

506
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,519
Let's go.

507
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:03,839
Come on.

508
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:05,359
Let's go.

509
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:14,799
Jia Yi.

510
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:17,479
Look at how arrogant they are.

511
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,680
They need to be taught a lesson.

512
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,879
Jia Yi, slow down.

513
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,200
Can you walk?

514
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,000
Why don't I carry you?

515
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:26,160
- No. - Does your leg hurt?

516
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,240
Lean there for a bit.

517
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,640
They've gone too far.

518
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,359
Why didn't you let me say anything?

519
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,480
Nuan Nuan.

520
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:38,319
I'm Aurora's artist.

521
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,200
Wait here.

522
00:29:44,201 --> 00:29:45,559
I'll get Xiao Gu to take us home.

523
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:56,160
Hey, Xiao Gu. Where are you?

524
00:29:57,319 --> 00:29:58,839
Jia Yi hurt her leg.

525
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,318
We're at an event.

526
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:01,359
Come pick us up.

527
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,680
I don't get it.

528
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,599
Why did Anning sign this kind of artist?

529
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:05,799
In Aurora,

530
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,000
this kind of thing would never happen.

531
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:10,079
Aurora lives up to its reputation.

532
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:11,519
The young lady of Aurora...

533
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,440
is their walking advertisement.

534
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,799
I'm slow to warm up to others.

535
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,960
We still weren't acquainted at the homecoming banquet.

536
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:19,159
When you're free,

537
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,240
let's have tea together.

538
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,400
Sure.

539
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,599
If you can join us,

540
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,680
Aurora would be like a tiger with wings.

541
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,400
By the way,

542
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,839
for the new movie that Aurora invested in,

543
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:37,599
Wen Xiao Nuan was cast as the female lead.

544
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,519
Who told you that?

545
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,119
Everyone knows, right?

546
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,278
Director Li Can...

547
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:48,119
publicly chased Bai Xiu Wen away on set.

548
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:50,079
Are you talking about "Blue Galaxy"?

549
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,359
I thought she would be replaced with you instead.

550
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,278
After all, in terms of looks and background,

551
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:58,359
in every aspect,

552
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,640
you and her...

553
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:01,759
are worlds apart.
