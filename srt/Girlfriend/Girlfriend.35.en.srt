Nuan Nuan.

3
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,519
Catch.

4
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:05,519
What are you doing?

5
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,639
You hit me!

6
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,680
You did it again.

7
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,479
How dare you?

8
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,478
I've had enough of you two.

9
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,810
Stop showing off your love!

10
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,560
I'll leave you two alone.

11
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,370
Let go.

12
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:30,280
Hello, Xiao Jing.

13
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:32,599
Xiao Nuan, I have good news for you.

14
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,158
You've been nominated for the Best Actress Award...

15
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:35,919
for your role in "Twin Flowers".

16
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,199
Hello?

17
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,759
Xiao Nuan, are you there?

18
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,199
I'm here.

19
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,758
If you're feeling better,

20
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:52,879
come back soon.

21
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:54,280
The award ceremony is coming up.

22
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:55,719
This is very important to you.

23
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,000
All right, I got it.

24
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,840
What is it?

25
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,360
I've been nominated for the Best Actress Award.

26
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,039
Aren't you surprised?

27
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,360
I expected it.

28
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,399
I'm so happy.

29
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,280
I've been nominated for the Best Actress Award!

- Wen Xiao Nuan is here!
- Wen Xiao Nuan!

34
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,399
You've been nominated for the Best Actress Award.

35
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,400
How do you feel?

36
00:03:27,401 --> 00:03:28,840
Do you have anything to say to your fans?

37
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,599
I'm grateful for the judges' recognition...

38
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,520
and the support from my fans.

39
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,879
I'll continue to work hard.

40
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,878
- Keep it up! - Keep it up, Xiao Nuan!

41
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,560
- Nuan Nuan, keep it up!
- Nuan Nuan, keep it up!

42
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,080
Nuan Nuan, keep it up!

(Han Hui and Wen Xiao Nuan to compete for the Best Actress Award)

44
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,919
Hello, Ms. Cheng.

45
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:05,080
You're the one who stirred up the news...

46
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:06,919
that Nuan Nuan is your substitute.

47
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,599
It's not a publicity stunt.

48
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:11,039
It's the truth.

49
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,479
Back then,

50
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,719
it was you who made me leave Fei Mo.

51
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,199
Ms. Han Hui.

52
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,360
Please get this straight.

53
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,480
That was your choice.

54
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:23,919
You gave up Fei Mo...

55
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,559
and followed an American Hollywood director...

56
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,759
to travel far away.

57
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,879
Why are you blaming me for it?

58
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,999
You sent that American director to approach me.

59
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,199
Yes. I won't deny that.

60
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,279
But to be honest,

61
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,170
I didn't intend...

62
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:42,279
to separate you and Fei Mo back then.

63
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,800
What?

64
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:48,399
I founded Anning Culture with my own hands.

65
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,239
I've seen too much of the snobbery and vanity...

66
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,560
in this industry.

67
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,399
I went to that American...

68
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,839
just to test you.

69
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,480
But when that man told you...

70
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,398
that he was a Hollywood director...

71
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,639
who can help you...

72
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:06,639
break into the international market and make it big,

73
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:08,610
you fell for it right away.

74
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:10,879
I wasn't wrong.

75
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,800
In the face of your ambition,

76
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,050
love is insignificant.

77
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:18,438
Fei Mo is something that you can give up...

78
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:20,240
at any time.

79
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,480
So...

80
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:22,879
all of this...

81
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:24,360
is your own fault.

82
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,170
As for...

83
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,040
whether there was a substitute or not,

84
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:31,600
you know it in your heart.

85
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,240
Fei Mo fell in love with you back then...

86
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:39,040
only because he thought you saved his life.

87
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,319
But unfortunately,

88
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:43,519
that was...

89
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,439
also a lie you made.

90
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,560
So in the end,

91
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,639
you're the impostor.

92
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,000
Just give up, Ms. Han.

93
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:01,560
I know my son.

94
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,839
He loves Wen Xiao Nuan.

95
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,680
In this life,

96
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,639
you and him are impossible.

97
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,199
(Wen Xiao Nuan)

98
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,800
All the best!

99
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,519
You're beautiful!

100
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,079
Director Li.

101
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,040
- Director Li. - Director Li.

102
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:47,000
Look here, Director Li.

103
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,078
Look here.

104
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:51,199
Look here.

105
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,800
Director Li.

106
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,680
Wen Xiao Nuan!

107
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,759
Wen Xiao Nuan!

108
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,040
Nuan Nuan, I love you!

109
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,319
Nuan Nuan!

110
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,519
Nuan Nuan!

111
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,959
I love you, Xiao Nuan!

112
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,360
- I love you! - Xiao Nuan!

113
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,319
You're beautiful!

114
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,518
- I love you! - I love you!

115
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:21,279
- You're so pretty! - Nuan Nuan!

116
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,360
Nuan Nuan!

117
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:27,240
Wen Xiao Nuan!

118
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,519
- Nuan Nuan! - Look here!

119
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,160
You're so pretty, Nuan Nuan!

120
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,959
Nuan Nuan, you're the prettiest!

121
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,839
Nuan Nuan!

122
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,279
Wen Xiao Nuan, you're beautiful!

123
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:50,480
Nuan Nuan!

124
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,120
I love you!

125
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,079
Nuan Nuan!

126
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,839
Nuan Nuan, I love you forever!

127
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,639
We'll always support you!

128
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,680
I love you!

129
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,759
Good luck!

130
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:08,560
- Han Hui! - I love you!

131
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,879
Good luck!

132
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,920
Nuan Nuan, I love you!

133
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,759
Han Hui, look here!

134
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,279
Look here!

135
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:25,319
Han Hui!

136
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,318
Han Hui, look here!

137
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:29,199
- Han Hui! - Han Hui!

138
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:31,560
- I will always support you! - Han Hui!

139
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,120
Look here!

140
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,159
Han Hui!

141
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:40,038
- Han Hui! - All the best!

142
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,279
All the best, Han Hui!

143
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,919
- So pretty! - All the best, Han Hui!

144
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,120
You're the best!

145
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,919
Han Hui!

146
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,210
All the best, Han Hui!

147
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,639
Ms. Wen, this way, please.

148
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,120
This way, please.

149
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,720
It's just a nomination.

150
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,279
We don't know...

151
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:22,759
who will win.

152
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,799
To me,

153
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,360
being nominated is already the biggest recognition.

154
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:30,210
It doesn't matter if I win or not.

155
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,919
I believe...

156
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,679
as long as I keep working hard,

157
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:36,159
I'll win one day.

158
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:40,519
And thank you...

159
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,840
for recommending me for "Twin Flowers".

160
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,159
That's how I got this opportunity.

161
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,480
Right.

162
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:51,450
There's something you probably don't know yet.

163
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:53,209
Ye Fei Mo has had a woman...

164
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,960
in his heart all these years.

165
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,159
This woman is not someone...

166
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,559
any of us can replace.

167
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,120
Both of us...

168
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:01,679
are just substitutes.

169
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,480
Neither of us...

170
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,000
is better than the other.

171
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:10,799
Han Hui.

172
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,159
As long as you don't think of yourself as a substitute,

173
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,519
no one will think of you as a substitute.

174
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,960
It's the same in acting.

175
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:21,639
And so in life.

176
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:38,679
(Wen Xiao Nuan)

177
00:10:52,450 --> 00:11:00,039
(Han Hui)

178
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,080
Xiao Nuan, do you want some water?

179
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:13,679
Xiao Jing.

180
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:15,039
Is everything ready?

181
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:22,678
I want to talk to Xiao Nuan alone.

182
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:23,720
Okay.

183
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,159
Are you nervous?

184
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,600
It's my first time being nominated after all.

185
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,120
I'm a little nervous.

186
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:39,840
Do you remember...

187
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:41,480
when you first joined Anning?

188
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:43,960
When I first joined Anning?

189
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,600
It's not that easy...

190
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,960
to become an S-class artist of Anning.

191
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:50,960
If you can't do it,

192
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,440
you can leave now.

193
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,440
How can there be such a low-class waiting room?

194
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:10,240
There are outsiders too.

195
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:18,199
Dark circles under your eyes.

196
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,240
A lot of wrinkles.

197
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,960
Hunched over and a bad posture.

198
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:35,799
I remember.

199
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,639
That was the old you.

200
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,440
The current you...

201
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,120
have been through so much.

202
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:43,600
You've long transformed into another you.

203
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,080
You should be confident. Don't you think?

204
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,919
It doesn't matter if you win or not.

205
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:53,240
This is just a moment in your life.

206
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,159
But the person you are in the future...

207
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:56,559
is destined for good.

208
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,558
All these years,

209
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:07,638
for the Gold Medal Awards Ceremony,

210
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:09,960
we can pretty much guess who the Best Actress is.

211
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:12,279
But this only year is a mystery.

212
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,159
Who do you think the Best Actress will be this year?

213
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:16,840
Want to make a guess?

214
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,119
It's 50-50.

215
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,678
Honestly, if I were a judge,

216
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:20,840
I wouldn't know who to pick.

217
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,479
Anyway, when I watch movies,

218
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,639
I prefer Wen Xiao Nuan.

219
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,879
She has a certain aura.

220
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:26,240
I'm rooting for Wen Xiao Nuan.

221
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:27,879
I agree.

222
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,319
But Han Hui is an international star after all.

223
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,759
The judges will give her face.

224
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,200
Do you think...

225
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,878
there will be the first double winner...

226
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:36,039
in the history of the Gold Medal Award Ceremony?

227
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:37,558
That would be even better.

228
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:39,200
- Let's wait and see. - Yes.

229
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,639
There's just one problem I can't figure out.

230
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,599
Aurora Film has prepared...

231
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,039
a much better project for you.

232
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,719
But you insist...

233
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,038
on choosing "Blue Galaxy".

234
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:13,080
Why is that?

235
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,639
Fei Mo and I have so many memories together.

236
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,679
And I can help him.

237
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,960
Wen Xiao Nuan...

238
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:24,039
can't do it at all.

239
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,279
If one day, I, Ye Fei Mo, am in a relationship,

240
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,440
I will announce it to everyone.

241
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,039
Mr. Ye never cared about scandals before.

242
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:45,719
So many people have taken advantage of his fame,

243
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,200
but he never clarified anything.

244
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:50,759
Fei Mo, give me a chance.

245
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,320
I'll love you more than Wen Xiao Nuan.

246
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:57,679
That's not necessary.

247
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:00,000
We won't see each other anymore.

248
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:01,639
Ms. Han.

249
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,480
Fei Mo fell in love with you back then...

250
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:08,879
only because he thought you saved his life.

251
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,600
So in the end,

252
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,000
you're the impostor.

253
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,639
Han Hui.

254
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,120
As long as you don't think of yourself as a substitute,

255
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,519
no one will think of you as a substitute.

256
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,159
It's the same in acting.

257
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,399
And so in life.

258
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:45,120
(Han Hui)

259
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,600
Hello.

260
00:15:49,601 --> 00:15:50,839
Please go out for a moment.

261
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,840
Okay.

262
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,360
What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?

263
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,240
Linda.

264
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:15,679
I'm going back to the US.

265
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:18,679
Settle things here as soon as possible.

266
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:20,959
Did something happen?

267
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,519
Why are you suddenly going back to the US?

268
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:23,720
It's nothing.

269
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,840
I'm just tired.

270
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:29,840
It's time for me to leave.

271
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,600
What about the award ceremony?

272
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:36,320
In the past,

273
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,799
I never took Wen Xiao Nuan seriously.

274
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,000
But now that I've seen her acting,

275
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:45,480
I'm no longer 100 percent confident...

276
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:47,519
that I can win the Best Actress Award.

277
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:51,559
Han Hui.

278
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:52,919
Don't think too much.

279
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,759
You're an excellent actress.

280
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:57,480
If Wen Xiao Nuan wins,

281
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,480
to me,

282
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:01,519
it's an utter loss.

283
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,650
Even if we both win,

284
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,169
to me, it's still a loss.

285
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:08,200
Do you understand?

286
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:10,559
Han Hui.

287
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,680
Leaving now...

288
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:21,890
is the last dignity I have left for myself.

289
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,358
Congratulations to Ms. Wen Xiao Nuan...

290
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:21,599
on winning the Gold Medal Award for Best Actress!

291
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:28,410
At one time,

292
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:30,839
I was just a random extra.

293
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,079
I never thought...

294
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,119
I would get this honor one day.

295
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,650
This award means a lot to me.

296
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:43,200
Here, I'd like to thank...

297
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:46,680
everyone who has helped me in the past...

298
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,759
and shared with me good fortune.

299
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:51,720
Thank you.

300
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:53,480
(Ye Fei Mo and Wen Xiao Nuan expresses their love openly)

301
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:00,650
Lastly,

302
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:04,039
I want to thank this person the most.

303
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,480
I'm sure you all know who it is.

304
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,079
I want to tell him this.

305
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:13,359
Ye Fei Mo.

306
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,890
You made me who I am today.

307
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:18,960
A better me.

308
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:22,079
I promise you.

309
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:25,319
No matter what happens in the future,

310
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:27,960
we'll always be together.

311
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:36,839
- Nuan Nuan's here.
- Congratulations, Nuan Nuan.

312
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,599
What a grand celebration. There's even an after-party.

313
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,199
Of course. You're now the Best Actress.

314
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,558
It calls for a celebration.

315
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,559
Jia Yi's right.

316
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,079
Congratulations, Wen Xiao Nuan.

317
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,199
We should all celebrate.

318
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,200
Thank you, everyone.

319
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:52,200
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations, Nuan Nuan.

320
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,200
Let's welcome our lead actor.

321
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:11,519
(The Brilliant Best Actress)

322
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:36,319
Thank you.

323
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:41,119
Nuan Nuan, congratulations.

324
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,039
My best actress.

325
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,410
Here. To our best actress.

326
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,359
- Thank you. - Cheers.

327
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:54,920
First of all,

328
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,279
I'd like to thank Director Li Can.

329
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,079
Thank you for acknowledging me...

330
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:02,359
and trusting me.

331
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,200
I'll work even harder...

332
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:05,960
to become a good actress.

333
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,720
Xiao Jing.

334
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:18,480
You raised an ignorant me...

335
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,410
to be who I am today.

336
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,000
I hope you'll always be there...

337
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:25,240
on my future journey.

338
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,039
Being your manager...

339
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,480
is the greatest pride of my life.

340
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:45,650
My Jia Yi.

341
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,759
Thank you for always being there for me.

342
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:52,880
For crying with me,

343
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:54,640
laughing with me,

344
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,720
going crazy with me,

345
00:21:58,079 --> 00:21:59,079
playing with me.

346
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:02,920
I'm so blessed to have you.

347
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:07,079
Gu Yun Zhou.

348
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:08,640
Be good to my best friend.

349
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,920
Or else, you'll be in trouble.

350
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:11,798
She's violent, you know?

351
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:12,919
What are you talking about?

352
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,319
I was wrong.

353
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:25,440
Ye Fei Mo.

354
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,599
Thank you for everything you've done for me.

355
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:31,319
Thank you for making me a better me.

356
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,279
Nuan Nuan.

357
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:51,559
From now on,

358
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,119
I'll spend...

359
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,480
every important moment of your life...

360
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:58,640
with you.

361
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:01,680
I'll share your joy...

362
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:03,839
and your accomplishments.

363
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,920
For the days to come,

364
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:10,200
we'll walk together...

365
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,319
through thick and thin.

366
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,399
- Wen Xiao Nuan! - Wen Xiao Nuan!

367
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,439
- Wen Xiao Nuan! - Xiao Nuan's here!

368
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,598
- Nuan Nuan! - Nuan Nuan!

369
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:42,640
- Nuan Nuan! - All the best!

370
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:55,519
(New film and television superstar, Wen Xiao Nuan)

371
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,279
Triple espresso latte?

372
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:16,079
Can you fall asleep at night?

373
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,519
I've been so tired lately.

374
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,960
I need a pick-me-up.

375
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,079
It's true that work has been stressful lately.

376
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:25,199
But it's something that every rising star...

377
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,279
has to go through.

378
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,559
You just won the award.

379
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,400
You're getting all the attention now.

380
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,160
We have to strike while the iron is hot...

381
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:33,920
and increase your popularity and traffic.

382
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,759
Also,

383
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,358
I've received contracts and scripts...

384
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:42,039
from famous production companies.

385
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,920
They're all good projects.

386
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,719
But the shooting cycles clash.

387
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,479
So I need you to go through them all...

388
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,480
and make your choice.

389
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,519
Okay.

390
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:52,640
I'll go back and take a look, then I'll let you know.

391
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,960
Xiao Nuan.

392
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,480
There's one more thing.

393
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Here.

394
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,118
It's an offer from a famous French director,

395
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:06,559
Jean Jacques.

396
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:08,920
Jean Jacques?

397
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:14,759
The Best Director winner at the Cannes Film Festival?

398
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,759
This offer is valuable.

399
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:19,279
I don't need to tell you that.

400
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,720
It's true.

401
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,279
Of course.

402
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,960
However...

403
00:25:31,012 --> 00:25:32,599
if we accept this job,

404
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:35,305
we'll be abroad for a year.

405
00:25:37,554 --> 00:25:38,460
A year?

406
00:25:42,209 --> 00:25:43,200
Ye Fei Mo...

407
00:25:45,067 --> 00:25:45,747
As you know,

408
00:25:46,501 --> 00:25:48,920
Han Hui broke up with Mr. Ye...

409
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:49,960
because she wanted to pursue her career overseas.

410
00:25:50,453 --> 00:25:52,119
It took Mr. Ye years to get over it.

411
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:53,894
That's why...

412
00:25:54,354 --> 00:25:55,920
when I received this offer,

413
00:25:57,127 --> 00:25:58,000
I was hesitant too.

414
00:26:01,776 --> 00:26:03,400
Xiao Jing, what should I do?

415
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,835
This is indeed a great opportunity.

416
00:26:07,448 --> 00:26:08,435
It's now or never.

417
00:26:09,828 --> 00:26:10,799
As an actress,

418
00:26:11,349 --> 00:26:13,000
sometimes it's hard to balance...

419
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:14,359
love and work.

420
00:26:15,089 --> 00:26:16,160
But the decision is yours.

421
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,160
I will respect your choice.

422
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:21,880
Think about it carefully.

423
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,039
Let's eat.

424
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,599
I've read Jean Jacques's contract.

425
00:27:57,319 --> 00:27:58,599
It's a good opportunity.

426
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:02,200
But...

427
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,079
I haven't decided yet.

428
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:07,278
What's there to think about?

429
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:08,480
It's a good opportunity.

430
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,400
It is a good opportunity.

431
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,559
But...

432
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,319
I'll be abroad for a year.

433
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:18,720
I don't want to leave you.

434
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:24,640
Silly girl.

435
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,440
I know what you're worried about.

436
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:29,119
But I trust you.

437
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,160
You're different from the others.

438
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:32,759
You have to trust me too.

439
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,839
My love for you...

440
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:36,480
is not about controlling you...

441
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:37,640
or possessing you.

442
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,799
I hope will all my heart that you can become better.

443
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:44,559
Your talent and flair...

444
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,559
deserve a bigger stage.

445
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,440
Besides,

446
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,839
it's only 12 months.

447
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:51,480
It'll be over before you know it.

448
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:52,640
But I...

449
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:54,000
No buts.

450
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:55,519
Be good.

451
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,240
Let me be the knight...

452
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,359
who escorts you to the throne,

453
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:02,240
not the stumbling block on your way to success.

454
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,319
If I go,

455
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,279
I'll have to leave in two days.

456
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,920
Then for these two days,

457
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:26,680
you'll belong only to me, Ye Fei Mo.
