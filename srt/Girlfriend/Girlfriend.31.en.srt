1
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,760
(Episode 31)

2
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:55,680
Fei Mo.

3
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:56,920
Why are you looking for me?

4
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,480
What are you trying to do?

5
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:02,480
What are you talking about?

6
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,159
Why did you pick her?

7
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,480
You want Wen Xiao Nuan to play in "Twin Flowers".

8
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,400
Don't you think the script is good?

9
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,400
You know that's not what I'm talking about.

10
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:19,159
"Twin Flowers" is the new work of the famous screenwriter, Mr. Liu.

11
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:22,199
Wen Xiao Nuan is a rookie.

12
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:23,719
It's a great opportunity for her.

13
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:25,599
Moreover,

14
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:27,280
if her popularity increases,

15
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,530
it's good for Anning too.

16
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,039
As the boss, you should thank me.

17
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,560
Anning and Aurora Film...

18
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,560
are business rivals.

19
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,840
There are so many artists at Aurora Film.

20
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:40,159
Why must you choose Wen Xiao Nuan?

21
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,240
What's your motive?

22
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,519
"Twin Flowers" tells the story...

23
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,438
of an emotional battle between a look-alike substitute...

24
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:48,159
and the original person.

25
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,038
Don't you all say...

26
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,599
that Wen Xiao Nuan looks like me?

27
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,280
That's why I think...

28
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,280
she's perfect for this role.

29
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:57,439
No matter what your motive is,

30
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:59,439
Wen Xiao Nuan won't accept the role.

31
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:03,639
I'm afraid that's not for you to decide.

32
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,919
She's not under your wing.

33
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,520
Stay out of our business.

34
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,199
I'm warning you.

35
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:12,520
You'd better not do anything.

36
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:16,039
If my guess is right,

37
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,319
you're very against it,

38
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:21,080
but she insists on taking the role.

39
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:22,840
Look.

40
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:24,360
Her love for you...

41
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:26,960
is not even as much as for a character.

42
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:29,360
She doesn't love you as much as I do.

43
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,159
With me,

44
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,199
you don't deserve to talk about love.

45
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,039
Jia Yi.

46
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,719
- How are you? - Nuan Nuan.

47
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,080
I saw my ex-boyfriend the other day.

48
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,879
You saw that jerk?

49
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,279
Yes.

50
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:23,079
I saw how happy he was...

51
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,000
after his family's arranged marriage.

52
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:27,800
He even has a cute little daughter.

53
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,360
Are you sad about it?

54
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:36,920
You were so good to him,

55
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,169
but he abandoned you just like that.

56
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,439
Just thinking about it makes me angry.

57
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:43,730
I thought I'd be sad too.

58
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,679
But when I saw the three of them...

59
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,319
so happy together,

60
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:50,279
I suddenly felt...

61
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:53,759
that he was right to leave me back then.

62
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:02,240
He and I are from different worlds.

63
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,000
Everyone has the right to choose a better life.

64
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,079
He's no different.

65
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,639
Time has proved...

66
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:12,800
that he made the right choice.

67
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,758
Is that why...

68
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,519
you broke up with Yun Zhou?

69
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,000
I think he's different from that jerk.

70
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:24,680
Gu Yun Zhou?

71
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,759
Yun Zhou likes rock climbing.

72
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,680
But he knows I'm afraid of that,

73
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,160
so he gave up his hobby for me.

74
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:40,839
I know nothing about art.

75
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,439
He doesn't want to embarrass me,

76
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:48,160
so he won't discuss it with me.

77
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,800
And I don't have any childhood memories with him.

78
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:56,120
Maybe...

79
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:59,120
Zhao Di is the right one for him.

80
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:00,959
Jia Yi.

81
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:02,399
That's just what you think.

82
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,560
Gu Yun Zhou doesn't think that way.

83
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,399
Yun Zhou's mom came to me.

84
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,680
She was right.

85
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:13,920
Zhao Di and Yun Zhou belong to the same world.

86
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,680
He deserves better.

87
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,439
I don't want Yun Zhou to give up on himself because of me.

88
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,199
I don't want to be a burden to him.

89
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,040
So...

90
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,600
I want to give them my blessing.

91
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,399
Giving up because of love...

92
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,319
will only hurt the two people who love each other.

93
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,600
No matter how painful the wound is,

94
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,000
it will eventually heal.

95
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,199
No matter how much you love someone,

96
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:55,560
it will all be in the past.

97
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,839
I believe Yun Zhou...

98
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:03,240
will understand my feelings.

99
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:08,360
I respect your choice.

100
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,839
I just want you to be happy.

101
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:15,120
What about you?

102
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,800
What about you and Ye Fei Mo?

103
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,079
I want to be in "Twin Flowers".

104
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:25,199
But Ye Fei Mo disagrees.

105
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:30,839
I don't know if he doesn't trust me...

106
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,439
or himself.

107
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:36,920
Or...

108
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,160
he's still not over that relationship.

109
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,720
Everyone chooses the person who makes them sweeter.

110
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,279
Mr. Ye is the same.

111
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,519
He won't let you star in "Twin Flowers"...

112
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,439
not because he can't get over his ex.

113
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,800
It's because he cares about you.

114
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,879
He doesn't want you to get hurt.

115
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:23,399
But knowing Wen Xiao Nuan,

116
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:25,319
she won't give up such a good script.

117
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,040
Even if I reject her in person,

118
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:28,879
she'll still fight for it with you.

119
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:31,920
I hope it won't affect your relationship.

120
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,919
Fei Mo.

121
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,919
I don't want to live under your wings forever.

122
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,758
I want to do what I like.

123
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:44,639
I want to play the role I like.

124
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,279
I want to be as brilliant as you.

125
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:51,120
I want to stand side by side with you one day.

126
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,039
That's why I have to work harder.

127
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,519
Who is it?

128
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,759
Why are you here?

129
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:13,759
I promise you.

130
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,840
I'll let you be in "Twin Flowers".

131
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,519
Really?

132
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:20,399
That's great!

133
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,919
However,

134
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,559
I have a condition.

135
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,360
You must agree to it.

136
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,799
I have to get someone to protect you.

137
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:39,209
Are you still worried about Wen Xiao Nuan...

138
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,450
starring in "Twin Flowers"?

139
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:42,960
Am I that obvious?

140
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,450
Is there something you want to ask me?

141
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:53,519
Why did you agree with Aurora FIlm to direct "Twin Flowers"?

142
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,720
The script is too good.

143
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I want to do it.

144
00:09:58,279 --> 00:09:59,960
Can you put the past behind you...

145
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,720
and continue to work with Han Hui?

146
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,879
I'm a professional director.

147
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,399
I'll only see if I'm interested in the script.

148
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:10,919
Everything else comes after.

149
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,360
You know what?

150
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:18,679
Every time we talk about work,

151
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:20,480
you look...

152
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,679
especially charming.

153
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,039
Perhaps your choice is right.

154
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,879
I support you.

155
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,330
Wen Xiao Nuan is also a professional actress.

156
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:35,519
I believe she can handle everything.

157
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:38,000
Besides, I'm here.

158
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,999
No matter what happens on set,

159
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,330
I won't just sit back and watch.

160
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:47,759
All right.

161
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:49,919
I'll leave my Xiao Nuan to you.

162
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,960
You don't have to go. I'll go by myself.

163
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,399
You can't do that.

164
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:07,519
This morning, you've told all the staff not to come.

165
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:09,120
If I'm not there too,

166
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:11,079
wouldn't that make us look like...

167
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,399
we have nothing to show for?

168
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:14,120
That's the point.

169
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,879
Do you know the saying, take a step back to advance?

170
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,879
See you.

171
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,919
Jiang Fang, I have something to talk to you about.

172
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,359
There's a VIP visiting today.

173
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,519
Let's talk outside.

174
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,360
Why did you cast Wen Xiao Nuan in "Twin Flowers"?

175
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,879
It was the company's decision.

176
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,559
What company's decision?

177
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:02,039
I think it's your own decision.

178
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:03,918
You're the producer.

179
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:05,720
You let Wen Xiao Nuan act in your movie.

180
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,360
That way, you'll have a legitimate reason to see her...

181
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,039
and prepare for the rekindling of your old love.

182
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,519
I have nothing to say to you.
I'm going to meet a client.

183
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:15,719
Jiang Fang.

184
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,360
Explain yourself. Don't go.

185
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:18,840
Let go!

186
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,080
Jiang Fang.

187
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,600
Jiang Fang.

188
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,360
Wake up, Jiang Fang!

189
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,279
Jiang Fang!

190
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,080
Wake up!

191
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,360
Thank you.

192
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,038
- Wen Xiao Nuan.
- She even brought bodyguards.

193
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,759
- What a show-off. - Yes.

194
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:58,359
Thank you for your hard work, sirs.

195
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,839
I can go in by myself.

196
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,960
There's no need to trouble you.

197
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:05,279
- Does she think she's a big shot? - I know, right?

198
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,999
Xiao Mei.

199
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,638
Let them go back first.

200
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:10,758
Don't follow me.

201
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:12,879
As a rookie, I have two bodyguards with me.

202
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,799
People will gossip if they see me.

203
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:16,080
Xiao Nuan.

204
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,439
Have you forgotten that you were injured on set...

205
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,200
and hospitalized because of Han Hui?

206
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:21,879
Mr. Ye arranged all this.

207
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,480
If we don't protect you,

208
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:25,159
we will all be in trouble.

209
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:26,759
But I...

210
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:28,000
Whenever Han Hui comes on set,

211
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,759
she employs more than a dozen bodyguards.

212
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,240
We only have two bodyguards.

213
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:33,399
That's nothing.

214
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,559
Don't worry.

215
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,080
Come on, let's go in.

216
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,519
Why did I promise Ye Fei Mo this?

217
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,678
Okay.

218
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:54,120
- Xiao Nuan. - The sooner the better.

219
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:56,519
- And mop the floor here. - Okay.

220
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,798
Let's go over everything as soon as possible.

221
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:59,720
- Good morning, Director. - You're here.

222
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,200
Has the overbearing CEO in love always been so childish?

223
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:11,360
With me here, Fei Mo is still worried about you.

224
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,679
It can't be helped.

225
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,559
What is Fei Mo worried about?

226
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,159
Han Hui.

227
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:24,919
You're early.

228
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,840
I didn't wait long.

229
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,799
It's a habit I developed in Anning.

230
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,799
I always arrive 15 minutes early.

231
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:37,159
We came on time.

232
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,360
We're not late.

233
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:40,759
Being on time is late.

234
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,879
Look. Han Hui is such a big shot,

235
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,159
but she didn't even bring an assistant.

236
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,399
Look at Wen Xiao Nuan.

237
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,120
She has bodyguards everywhere.

238
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,759
She even brought an assistant.

239
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:52,959
How arrogant.

240
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,120
Lower your voice.

241
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,399
Director Li, we're going to do our makeup.

242
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:58,600
Go ahead.

243
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,080
Her status is different now.

244
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:04,759
Okay, I got it.

245
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,799
Director Li.

246
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:19,559
- It's okay. I'll go up by myself. - Okay.

247
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,918
Let's get into the main scene.

248
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:30,159
- Director Li, are we rehearsing? - Yes.

249
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,679
Let's rehearse first.

250
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:33,960
Come on, get ready.

251
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:44,519
It's nothing.

252
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:46,200
What's wrong?

253
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:47,919
Director Li.

254
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,440
There was a confetti on the floor.

255
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,639
I just picked it up.

256
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:56,960
Get down.

257
00:15:57,919 --> 00:15:58,919
All right.

258
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,519
No outsiders are allowed in the picture.

259
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,200
I'm sorry.

260
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:04,639
She's putting on airs.

261
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,840
Keep it down.

262
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,240
She's the queen of Anning Culture now.

263
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,600
Didn't you see how Han Hui looked in front of her?

264
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,440
We're filming officially.

265
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:17,519
Is the patient's family here?

266
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,600
Doctor, how is he?

267
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,038
We've done a thorough examination.

268
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:25,159
Mr. Jiang has a slight concussion.

269
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,799
But he'll be fine.

270
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,759
He just needs some rest.

271
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,759
But he lost a lot of blood.

272
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,080
The wound on his head is quite big.

273
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,960
We've cleaned it and stitched him up.

274
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,279
He needs to rest and eat well.

275
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,519
There's not a big problem.

276
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,360
- Really? - Yes.

277
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:24,480
I'm glad to know that you're fine.

278
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,480
But...

279
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,650
I'm too ashamed...

280
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,960
to face you when you wake up.

281
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,799
I'm so tired.

282
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,920
You're tired?

283
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:30,650
Come here.

284
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,319
Let me give you a massage.

285
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:33,599
Relax.

286
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:35,039
What?

287
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,319
Did filming go well today?

288
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,119
Yes, it did.

289
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:41,559
It's just that...

290
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:43,920
Fei Mo.

291
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,119
Can you not assign me bodyguards?

292
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:48,890
It's putting me in a difficult position.

293
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,039
No.

294
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,839
I can't let you get hurt.

295
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,758
Why would I get hurt?

296
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:56,000
There are so many people there.

297
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:57,410
What can anyone do to me?

298
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:00,170
Have you forgotten that you got hit by the light last time?

299
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,839
This matter is not negotiable.

300
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,359
Which one do you think looks nice?

301
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,240
None of them.

302
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,039
Are you blind?

303
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:26,519
I'll just buy them all for her.

304
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:30,279
But I don't even know her ring size.

305
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,920
Buddy.

306
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:37,799
Has being in love made you stupid?

307
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:39,410
If you don't know, just ask her.

308
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
You're the stupid one.

309
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:42,559
It's a proposal.

310
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,119
How can it be a surprise if I ask her?

311
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:47,200
Ye Fei Mo.

312
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,240
Do you really want me to die?

313
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:51,720
Wang Jia Yi just dumped me.

314
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,200
You want me to help you look at your proposal ring.

315
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,890
Are you even human?

316
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,680
You can get her back.

317
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:01,279
What's the point of being sad here?

318
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:03,650
Did you think I wanted to?

319
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:06,000
But she doesn't want to see me at all.

320
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:09,720
And until now, I still don't understand why.

321
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:20,479
I'm heartbroken and sad here.

322
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,839
Are you going to sit idly by?

323
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:32,890
Fei Mo.

324
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,519
Why don't you...

325
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,119
ask Wen Xiao Nuan to find out for me?

326
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:43,119
No.

327
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:49,799
Aren't we buddies? You...

328
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,200
Do you think that Mr. Ye...

329
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:02,680
is really dating her?

330
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,650
We've been filming for so long.

331
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,079
But he has never visited the set.

332
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,000
Xiao Mei.

333
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,319
It's okay. Sit down.

334
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,440
Xiao Nuan, we're starting.

335
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,599
- Let's go. - Let's go.

336
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:17,319
How nice.

337
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,410
When I see you,

338
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:22,039
I feel like I'm looking at myself.

339
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,079
Cut.

340
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:27,799
Wen Xiao Nuan.

341
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:31,410
You can take it down a notch with this part.

342
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:37,239
Xiao Nuan, in this scene,

343
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,799
you should take it easy.

344
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,199
Because at this point, the character is confused.

345
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,799
She doesn't know what's going on.

346
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,839
So you have to control your emotions.

347
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,410
Stand in my place.

348
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,839
I'll show you.

349
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:54,440
What are you doing?

350
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
This is a film set.

351
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:57,240
Sorry, Director.

352
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,358
What are you doing?

353
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,758
Get down. Go!

354
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:02,079
Get down.

355
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:03,559
Are you all right?

356
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,960
I'm sorry.

357
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,119
They're too crude. I'm sorry.

358
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,039
I just wanted to talk to you about the act.

359
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:12,400
I'm sorry.

360
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,839
Han Hui, don't be mad.

361
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,039
I'm sorry.

362
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:30,440
Let's take a break.

363
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,000
We'll start at 4pm sharp.

364
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:33,519
Director, I'm sorry.

365
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:34,879
Let's take a break.

366
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,000
We'll start at 4pm sharp.

367
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:39,160
Xiao Mei, those two...

368
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:40,598
It's so awkward.

369
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:42,200
What will people think?

370
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:49,480
Isn't that Mr. Ye from Anning Culture?

371
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,558
He came as soon as Han Hui got hurt.

372
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:53,000
What a coincidence.

373
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,400
What happened?

374
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,200
Well, Han Hui came close and grabbed Xiao Nuan.

375
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,119
The bodyguards got impatient...

376
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,839
and twisted her arm red.

377
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,879
Han Hui just wanted to talk to me about the scene.

378
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,279
She didn't want to hurt me.

379
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:12,479
Fei Mo, I'm an adult.

380
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,920
I can protect myself.

381
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,118
Stop having those two bodyguards follow me.

382
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:17,119
Okay?

383
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,039
All right.

384
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,640
I promise you.

385
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,399
Yue, let me ask you.

386
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,880
You have to answer me honestly.

387
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,599
- You approached... - You must be tired.

388
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:41,839
Have a drink.

389
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:43,759
Leave it there. I'll drink it later.

390
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:51,440
Have you heard of this?

391
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,078
Someone who can put a can tab...

392
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:55,119
through their ring finger,

393
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,920
they're especially favored by the heavens.

394
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:08,318
Don't you have anything better to do?

395
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:10,480
I asked you to practice lines with me. Come on.

396
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:11,839
Read the lines.

397
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:14,720
- Give that back to me first. - Okay.

398
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:17,640
Hurry up.

399
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,559
I'll start.

400
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,440
Yue.

401
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,359
Let me ask you.

402
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,319
You have to answer me honestly.

403
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,440
You approached me at first...

404
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,440
because I look like her.

405
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:48,440
Now,

406
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,240
you see more and more of her in me.

407
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:55,720
You think she's always by your side.

408
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,440
That's why you asked me to stay, right?

409
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:05,640
Why aren't you answering me?

410
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:08,960
Why aren't you saying anything?

411
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:14,279
Ye Fei Mo, read the lines.

412
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,000
Sorry.

413
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,480
I was distracted.

414
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,880
Do it again.

415
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:24,039
Do you think I look like Han Hui?

416
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,920
Do I?

417
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,119
("Twin Flowers")

418
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:36,680
What do you think?

419
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:41,279
I think just a little.

420
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,480
But I'm asking you.

421
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:54,160
I think...

422
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,920
you look more like this chicken.

423
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:59,598
You're the one who looks like a chicken!

424
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:00,959
I don't look like a chicken. You do.

425
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,558
- That's enough. - How could you hit me?

426
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,279
You look like a chicken.

427
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:18,440
Hello, sir.

428
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:21,200
You're Mr. Ye.

429
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,720
Welcome.

430
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,719
This is the scene we shot last time.

431
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,160
The first time you two met.

432
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:30,919
And in the eating scene after that,

433
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,479
just act according to that emotion.

434
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,519
It's very good.

435
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,719
When Man first meets Zhang Xuan,

436
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,640
she doesn't know that she's in a relationship with Yue.

437
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:39,399
But you can tell from her eyes...

438
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,559
because she knows that you're with Yue now.

439
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:43,278
So you can tell from her eyes...

440
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,480
the sensitivity of a woman.

441
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,358
You'll find something similar to disdain.

442
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:47,440
Give her more lines then.

443
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,119
Thank you for liking me, Ms. Xiao Man.

444
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:51,759
When I see you,

445
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,799
I feel a sense of familiarity too.

446
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,480
Is that so?

447
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,559
I'm glad to hear that.

448
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:02,000
I'm not just saying that.

449
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:05,119
I do think we look quite similar.

450
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,400
It's just that you're younger than me.

451
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:12,039
Is that a compliment?

452
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,440
How nice.

453
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,279
When I see you,

454
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,480
I feel like I'm looking at myself.

455
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,880
The 20-year-old me,

456
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:45,759
how are you doing?

457
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:58,239
(Han Hui's Personal Film Studio)

458
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,920
(The 20-year-old me, how are you doing?)
