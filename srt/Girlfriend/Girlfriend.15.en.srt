- Look at this. - A new actress.

5
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:54,878
I've never seen this actress before.

6
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:55,958
She's so pretty.

7
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:57,120
It has so many views.

8
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:06,200
Five minutes,

9
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:09,039
and it has over a million views on every platform.

10
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,599
We...

11
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:13,370
We've set a new record!

12
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,119
- Yes! - Okay!

13
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,840
- That's great! - That's amazing!

14
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,529
(It's so good! Looking forward to believing in love again!)

15
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:33,718
(When will it be released?)

16
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:34,719
(It's so beautiful!)

17
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,360
Wen Xiao Nuan.

18
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,280
It's your birthday tomorrow, right?

19
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:51,919
How did you know?

20
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,318
She's from Human Resources.

21
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:54,319
She read your file.

22
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,039
Well? Let's celebrate.

23
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,038
Why are you hesitating?

24
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:59,119
It's our company's tradition...

25
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,158
to celebrate employees' birthdays.

26
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,520
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

27
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,279
- I suggest a party at her house. - Sure.

28
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,080
First, your trailer broke the record.

29
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,280
Second, it's your birthday.

30
00:03:07,281 --> 00:03:08,799
It's a double celebration.

31
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,559
We have to celebrate.

32
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,560
That's right.

33
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,759
Let's take this opportunity...

34
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:13,879
to have a good time.

35
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:14,879
Yes.

36
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,439
I live on the 35th floor now.

37
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:21,960
I'm your upstairs neighbor.

38
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,039
I can't let them know...

39
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:26,800
that Ye Fei Mo lives upstairs from me.

40
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,280
Why are you hesitating?

41
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,680
Is it the company?

42
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,000
I live with my best friend.

43
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,719
I don't want to inconvenience her.

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,079
Since she's your best friend,

45
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,198
what's inconvenient about it?

46
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,199
Give her a call and ask her.

47
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,959
She should still be at work at this hour.

48
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,438
Why don't I ask her tonight?

49
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:43,718
I'll tell you tomorrow.

50
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:44,758
Ask her now.

51
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:45,759
If it's inconvenient,

52
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,438
we'll book another place.

53
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:48,879
Don't delay tomorrow's party.

54
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,318
That's right.

55
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,359
Come on.

56
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,159
- Call quickly. - Come on.

57
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,400
Okay.

58
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,439
Hi, Jia Yi.

59
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,800
Nuan Nuan, I was just about to call you.

60
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,319
I saw your trailer. It's amazing.

61
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,918
And it's your birthday tomorrow.

62
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,039
Why don't we celebrate?

63
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,000
My colleagues said...

64
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:15,039
they want to have a party at our place tomorrow.

65
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:18,240
Is it inconvenient for you?

66
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:20,049
No, that's great.

67
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,079
The more, the merrier.

68
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,240
It's settled, then.

69
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:25,050
Okay, all right.

70
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,560
What should I do?

71
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,399
Come in.

72
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:49,319
Mr. Ye,

73
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:51,000
Wen Xiao Nuan's birthday is tomorrow.

74
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:52,729
As usual, the company will buy a cake...

75
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:53,839
to celebrate with her.

76
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,920
Would you like to join us?

77
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:56,079
No need.

78
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,318
Okay, when we have cake tomorrow,

79
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:01,439
we won't invite you.

80
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,170
I meant...

81
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,279
there's no need to order a cake.

82
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,958
Then...

83
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,169
I'm going on an urgent business trip tomorrow.

84
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,170
I'm going to Los Angeles.

85
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,638
Do you need me to do anything?

86
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,680
No.

87
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,319
Keep an eye on Wen Xiao Nuan for me.

88
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:15,079
While I'm gone,

89
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:16,360
don't let her slack off.

90
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:18,170
Make sure to remind her.

91
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:20,800
Okay, I'll remember that.

92
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:22,120
You may go.

93
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,878
What do you want as a gift?

94
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:38,919
- That's right. - Don't.

95
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,680
- What do you want as a gift?
- Just tell us.

96
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:42,720
Xiao Jing.

97
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,720
- Xiao Jing. - Xiao Jing.

98
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:46,639
Nuan Nuan.

99
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,560
Mr. Ye is going on a business trip to LA tomorrow.

100
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,600
Don't slack off on your training.

101
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,040
Don't let Mr. Ye down.

102
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,439
I'll do my best.

103
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:57,680
Carry on, then.

104
00:05:58,839 --> 00:05:59,920
- Don't delay your training. - Bye.

105
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,040
That's great.

106
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,398
Once Mr. Ye leaves,

107
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,958
we'll have the right to breathe freely.

108
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:07,439
- Yes! - Come by after work tomorrow.

109
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,199
- Okay. - Great! I'll inform everyone.

110
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,398
Keep it down.

111
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:12,399
Don't let...

112
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,198
- Don't worry.
- Don't worry. We're experienced.

113
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:15,720
- Don't worry. - Bye.

114
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,480
Jia Yi, can you take a bedtime photo for me?

115
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,240
One, two, three.

116
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,639
Maggie,

117
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:44,240
buy a bouquet of flowers for me tomorrow.

118
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:45,439
Okay.

119
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,839
Xiao Nuan,

120
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,000
we've checked.

121
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,758
Mr. Ye didn't come to work today.

122
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:03,759
Yes.

123
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,159
Come straight to my house after work.

124
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,079
- I'll send you the address.
- Okay, no problem.

125
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,160
- We'll get going. - Bye.

126
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:31,480
This bouquet is for you.

127
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:32,919
Happy birthday.

128
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,720
Happy birthday.

129
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,519
Come on.

130
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,599
This is on.

131
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,600
This is off.

132
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,000
Is this on or off?

133
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:47,278
- Off. - On.

134
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,359
- Off. - On.

135
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,360
It's definitely on.

136
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,480
- Why? - It's on.

137
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:52,360
- No, tell me. Isn't it on?
- I said it's on.

138
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,519
- Go on. - That's just on.

139
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,399
This bouquet is for you.

140
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,879
Happy...

141
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,159
Mr. Ye?

142
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,450
I knew...

143
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:07,679
this day would come for me.

144
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,210
- Mr. Ye. - Mr. Ye.

145
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:30,559
Have a seat.

146
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:32,399
Have fun.

147
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,639
Don't stay up too late.

148
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:35,639
Don't be late tomorrow.

149
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,360
I'll get going, then.

150
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:40,798
- Take care, Mr. Ye. - Goodbye, Mr. Ye.

151
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:42,000
Mr. Ye, do you want to join us?

152
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,360
Sure.

153
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:56,450
That's great.

154
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,039
- Who is it? - Mr. Ye.

155
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,600
I'll ask him.

156
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,360
I'll ask.

157
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:06,799
Mr. Ye.

158
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:10,209
You and Wen Xiao Nuan's trailer.

159
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,330
We all saw it.

160
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,600
So tell us.

161
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:14,799
What was the taste...

162
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,279
of your most unforgettable and best kiss?

163
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:20,798
- Yes, what does it taste like?
- Yes, what taste is it?

164
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,639
- What does it taste like? - Yes.

165
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,840
The best kiss...

166
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:27,210
tasted like seawater.

167
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:29,759
Seawater?

168
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,399
The taste of seawater?

169
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:33,090
The most unforgettable kiss...

170
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,450
tasted like garlic.

171
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:40,759
- Garlic? - Garlic?

172
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,038
Garlic?

173
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:43,090
The taste of garlic?

174
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,479
Why would it taste like garlic?

175
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,159
- Why would it taste like garlic?
- That's right.

176
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,159
- What does that mean?
- I'm going to the bathroom.

177
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,449
How could it taste like garlic?

178
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,450
What does that mean?

179
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,450
Wait.

180
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:56,279
I remember now.

181
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,679
Xiao Nuan.

182
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,678
When we were filming the trailer of "Blue Galaxy",

183
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:03,159
you asked me for pickled garlic, didn't you?

184
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:07,360
What's this?

185
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:10,119
Nuan Nuan, you're really good at hiding it.

186
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,199
Be honest with us.

187
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,558
How long have you two been together?

188
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:13,559
- How long? - How long?

189
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,839
I didn't eat it.

190
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,960
That's right.

191
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,440
I really didn't eat it.

192
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,558
When you asked me for it,

193
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:21,159
you said that pickled garlic is your favorite.

194
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:23,039
I...

195
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,200
I used it to repel mosquitoes.

196
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,319
- Repel mosquitoes? - Who are you kidding?

197
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,798
- There were no mosquitoes on set.
- That's right.

198
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:29,839
- Tell us the truth. - That's right.

199
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,959
- Tell us the truth. - Tell us the truth.

200
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,039
- Tell us. - Tell us.

201
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:33,199
I didn't.

202
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,758
I didn't.

203
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:35,798
- Tell us! - Tell us!

204
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:36,878
- We're waiting to hear it. - I didn't.

205
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:38,678
- Why don't you believe me? - Tell us!

206
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:40,158
- Tell us. - Tell us quickly.

207
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,879
- Just say it. - That's right.

208
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,039
Tell us.

209
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:46,559
Hurry up and say it.

210
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:48,600
I really...

211
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,000
Do you still remember the creative concept of our trailer?

212
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,240
No matter how many obstacles we face...

213
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:09,200
or how badly conflicted or indecisive our hearts are,

214
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:11,519
we have to have faith...

215
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,480
and bravely pursue love.

216
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:17,080
Isn't it like this?

217
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,279
It's like this!

218
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,799
True love is priceless.

219
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,080
I'm not a professional actor.

220
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:25,679
In order to better express this conflicted love...

221
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,720
and to convey this feeling more accurately,

222
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,639
I asked Wen Xiao Nuan...

223
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:31,840
to help me.

224
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,440
She used garlic to stimulate me.

225
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,879
I didn't know you guys were so imaginative.

226
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,039
It looks like our company doesn't have to worry...

227
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,399
about coming up with creative ideas.

228
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,639
I see.

229
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,000
Wen Xiao Nuan, why didn't you say so earlier?

230
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:48,120
That's right. That's Mr. Ye for you.

231
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,919
- He's so creative. - That's impressive.

232
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,360
Nuan Nuan.

233
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:54,159
Jia Yi, you're finally back!

234
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,919
- I've missed you so much.
- There are so many people.

235
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:57,759
Hello, Mr. Ye.

236
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,119
I bought a cake. Let's eat it together.

237
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,399
- Okay! - Come on.

238
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:03,079
Make a wish.

239
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,039
I hope Fusheng will be fine.

240
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:07,200
I hope Xiao Kai will be healthy and happy.

241
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:10,320
I hope the shooting of "Blue Galaxy" goes well.

242
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:12,639
I hope I can fulfill my mission...

243
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:14,639
and live up to everyone's expectations.

244
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:26,840
- Happy birthday! - Happy birthday!

245
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:29,119
Yes!

246
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,199
Yes!

247
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,278
Happy birthday!

248
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,480
What did you wish for?

249
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:36,480
I wished...

250
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:38,918
that I can pay off my debt soon...

251
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,279
and be free again.

252
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,558
- Pay off her debt and be free?
- Pay off her debt and be free?

253
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:43,638
Pay off what debts?

254
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:45,080
It won't come true if you say it out loud.

255
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,038
Nice! Happy birthday!

256
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:59,240
- Happy birthday! - Happy birthday!

257
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,360
Happy birthday.

258
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:08,159
According to big data analysis,

259
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,119
the release of the trailer was a success.

260
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,199
It's caused an uproar on the internet.

261
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,240
It's getting good reviews.

262
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:15,360
Also,

263
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,799
the audiences' expectations for "Blue Galaxy"...

264
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
are very high.

265
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,878
All the data has surpassed...

266
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:23,879
the standards that Mr. Ye set for Wen Xiao Nuan.

267
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,519
So...

268
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:32,559
I agree with casting Wen Xiao Nuan...

269
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,039
as the female lead in "Blue Galaxy".

270
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,679
I suggest...

271
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,799
that while the trailer is still popular,

272
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,279
we release another promotional clip...

273
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,158
featuring Wen Xiao Nuan as the female lead.

274
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:45,200
What do you think?

275
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:46,440
I agree.

276
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,439
This way, before the film is released,

277
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,639
we can keep up the exposure.

278
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:51,719
Yes, since this method is effective,

279
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,080
we should continue with it.

280
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:54,799
I agree too.

281
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:56,639
I wonder what you think, Mr. Ye.

282
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:01,279
I disagree.

283
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:04,200
Why?

284
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:05,639
The trailer...

285
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:08,480
was shot by you, Mr. Ye.

286
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:10,519
Yes, the response is so good.

287
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:12,080
It would be a shame not to continue.

288
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:15,639
The promotional purpose of the trailer has been achieved.

289
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,360
Continuing filming and releasing...

290
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:18,720
will likely...

291
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,279
have a negative impact on its reputation.

292
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,158
Expectations for "Blue Galaxy"...

293
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:24,200
have already peaked.

294
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,799
Continuing filming and releasing...

295
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:27,440
won't have a more prominent effect.

296
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:31,480
And if it doesn't meet the quality of the first trailer,

297
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:33,080
it will ruin our reputation.

298
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,519
Moreover, the actors...

299
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,120
must retain a sense of mystery.

300
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,919
That's true.

301
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,360
We should focus...

302
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,840
on the filming and production of "Blue Galaxy".

303
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,000
The production...

304
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,278
is always the most important.

305
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,720
Yes, you're right.

306
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,559
Yes. Let's all work hard.

307
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,759
- Mr. Ye has good foresight. - You're right.

308
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:56,080
- Yes. - You're right.

309
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,200
- I support it. - Yes, you're right.

310
00:15:57,201 --> 00:15:59,360
- I support it. - Me too.

311
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:09,518
(Newcomer Wen Xiao Nuan confirmed as female lead in "Blue Galaxy")

312
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:10,959
(Following the trailer's success, Anning officially casts newcomer)

313
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,199
(This is Anning's first time starring a newcomer...)

314
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,679
(in a major production.)

315
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:16,919
Anning made an announcement.

316
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,120
Because of the success of the trailer,

317
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,480
Wen Xiao Nuan has been cast as the female lead of "Blue Galaxy".

318
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:26,039
Did you know about this?

319
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,479
Anning arranged for Wen Xiao Nuan to shoot the trailer.

320
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,878
We weren't informed.

321
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:33,639
Why would they tell me this in advance?

322
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:35,559
Are you very happy right now?

323
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:37,679
Why would I be happy?

324
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,279
After all, you used to like her.

325
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:40,759
Maybe you still do.

326
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:42,559
Ling Er, can you trust me for once?

327
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:43,959
This is a company matter.

328
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,600
Don't make it personal, all right?

329
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,840
Does Anning get the final say?

330
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,480
What about Aurora's say?

331
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:51,639
Aurora has a share in "Blue Galaxy" too.

332
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,960
Why should we let Ye Fei Mo use it to promote new talent?

333
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,679
Don't worry.

334
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:58,159
I won't let Anning mess around.

335
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,960
Jiang Fang, that's not what I meant.

336
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,319
It's just that Wen Xiao Nuan is too manipulative.

337
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,559
She was pestering you before.

338
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,920
Now Anning's CEO...

339
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,650
has been bewitched by her.

340
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,358
The female lead of such a major production...

341
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,440
was changed just like that.

342
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,519
Aurora and Anning will go down because of her.

343
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:19,518
I know. I'll take care of it.

344
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:20,519
Don't worry.

345
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,410
For the new movie that Aurora invested in,

346
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,319
Wen Xiao Nuan was cast as the female lead.

347
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,839
I thought she would be replaced with you instead.

348
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:36,719
After all, in terms of looks and background,

349
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,919
in every aspect,

350
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,000
you and her...

351
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,960
are worlds apart.

352
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,359
Jiang Fang, I'm going shopping.

353
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,279
- Pick me up after your meeting. - Okay.

354
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:05,650
I want to meet the male lead of "Blue Galaxy"

355
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:12,118
Ms. Jiang,

356
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:13,960
did you ask me to come here for a good reason?

357
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,959
I can't say it's a good reason.

358
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,410
I just want to give you a reminder.

359
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:19,318
Do you know that the female lead of "Blue Galaxy"...

360
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:20,440
is Wen Xiao Nuan?

361
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:21,839
I know.

362
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,519
Director Li notified me first.

363
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:25,440
Don't you care at all?

364
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:27,079
What's there to care about?

365
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:29,000
I just need to act my part well.

366
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,278
That's what you think.

367
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:32,079
Ye Fei Mo doesn't think so.

368
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:35,240
What do you mean?

369
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:36,440
Don't you know?

370
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:39,960
Ye Fei Mo acted in the trailer himself...

371
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:41,890
with Wen Xiao Nuan.

372
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,119
He said your image is too obscene to be the male lead.

373
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:46,519
They're considering replacing you.

374
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,039
If you dare to take this role,

375
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,839
don't assume you'll survive it.

376
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,119
I'm just warning you.

377
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:57,599
The final decision is up to you.

378
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,410
Hi, Nuan Nuan.

379
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,319
I'm at Anning for an audition.

380
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:09,720
Why aren't you here?

381
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:11,799
I'm on set now.

382
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:13,919
How did it go? What did the director say?

383
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,480
It went okay. He told me to wait for news.

384
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:16,960
That's good.

385
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,650
You went to Anning.

386
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,000
Did you see Gu Yun Zhou?

387
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,960
Gu Yun Zhou?

388
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:28,799
Why did you suddenly bring him up?

389
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,240
Jia Yi,

390
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,680
I have something to tell you.

391
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,839
Actually, Gu Yun Zhou...

392
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:44,079
isn't some part-timer.

393
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:46,480
He's the vice president of Anning.

394
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,119
Yes.

395
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:49,599
I know.

396
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:51,038
When did you find out?

397
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,200
Why didn't you tell me?

398
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:53,410
Nuan Nuan,

399
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,960
I once lost everything.

400
00:19:58,359 --> 00:19:59,890
That's why I know...

401
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,039
who really cares about me.

402
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:06,079
You lied to me with good intentions.

403
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:08,279
I understand.

404
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,000
But don't worry.

405
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:12,480
I never blamed you.

406
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:16,410
Jia Yi, why didn't you say anything?

407
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:18,599
Because I want him...

408
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:21,170
to tell me the truth.

409
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:23,359
I want to wait for him to tell me himself.

410
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:26,960
Wen Xiao Nuan, are you ready?

411
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,079
Coming!

412
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:30,409
Jia Yi, I'm heading into the set. I'll talk to you later.

413
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:32,409
Okay, I'll leave you to it. Let's talk at home.

414
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:33,480
Okay, bye.

415
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:48,650
Mr. Gu.

416
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,038
The release status of the "Blue Galaxy" trailer...

417
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,759
in second-tier cities is out.

418
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,359
I'll report it to you.

419
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,240
Let's talk later.

420
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:00,279
Okay.

421
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,240
Mr. Gu, this way.

422
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,798
By the way,

423
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:11,889
finish the statistics on third and fourth-rank cities...

424
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:12,960
as soon as possible too.

425
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:15,649
- Yes. - Tomorrow...

426
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,279
No, email it to me tonight.

427
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:18,890
I'll try to get it done.

428
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,799
Come here.

429
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:28,079
Mr. Gu, are you not feeling well?

430
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:32,919
Everyone, move back. Give him some air.

431
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,960
- Okay. - Don't.

432
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:36,839
You can't see me.

433
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:40,799
Gu Yun Zhou?

434
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:07,558
Today, you are...

435
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:08,598
a security guard.

436
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:09,679
Yes.

437
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,880
A part-time security guard.

438
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Security guard.

439
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:17,400
- A security guard. - A security guard.

440
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,960
Xiao Gu,

441
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,319
did you see a friend?

442
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,999
You've been working hard lately.

443
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Today,

444
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,720
I'll give you half a day off.

445
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:31,920
I think you should take it.

446
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,079
Our company has a lot of filming duties lately.

447
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,999
The Security Team has a tough job.

448
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,558
- That's right. - Xiao Gu has been performing well.

449
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:39,639
He has a bright future.

450
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,160
Thank you, sir.

451
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:46,599
Look, as soon as you came,

452
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,959
the boss gave me a day off.

453
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,960
You're my lucky charm.

454
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:50,440
It's okay. Get back to work.

455
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,278
I was just here for an audition. I'm going home now.

456
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:53,319
Don't.

457
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:56,118
It's not easy for me to get paid leave.

458
00:22:56,119 --> 00:22:57,119
Don't ruin it for me.

459
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:58,119
Really?

460
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,160
- Yes. - All right, then.

461
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:02,160
Thank you for taking care of...

462
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:03,880
Xiao Gu.

463
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,519
- You're welcome. - You're welcome.

464
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:06,880
Xiao Gu deserves it.

465
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,799
How about this? Let the young people have fun.

466
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:10,319
Let's go over there.

467
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,919
- Let's go. - Okay.

468
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,920
Let's go.

469
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,680
Jia Yi,

470
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,319
it's my day off.

471
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:20,559
Why don't we go have a meal?

472
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,119
- I know a really good restaurant. - Okay.

473
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:24,559
Let's go.

474
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:29,519
"Blue Galaxy" is developing smoothly.

475
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:31,400
Director Li is also very pleased with Nuan.

476
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:33,480
So she'll be setting up her makeup this afternoon.

477
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,598
Get the company's best makeup artist,

478
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:37,999
stylist, and costume designer.

479
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,279
Assign all of them to Wen Xiao Nuan.

480
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,199
But our company's best stylist team...

481
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,400
is participating in the film festival.

482
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,519
Tell them to come here.

483
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:50,079
I mean...

484
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,640
they'll just be icing on the cake over there.

485
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,079
It's meaningless.

486
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,680
If Wen Xiao Nuan succeeds,

487
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,440
Anning will benefit greatly.

488
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,358
Maximizing profits...

489
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:03,200
is the nature of capitalism.

490
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:09,839
Mr. Ye,

491
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:13,400
you don't have to explain to me.

492
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:14,960
I want the best for Wen Xiao Nuan too.

493
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,319
I'll get on it right away.

494
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,920
Is it that obvious?

495
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:25,599
Here. Congratulations on your successful audition.

496
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:26,759
Thank you.

497
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:32,400
You seem to know a lot about food.

498
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,078
Not really.

499
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:36,598
I used to work...

500
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:38,118
at all kinds of restaurants.

501
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:39,479
So I've seen a lot of good food.

502
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,720
But I've never tasted it myself.

503
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:42,480
You're splurging today.

504
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,680
Not at all.

505
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,759
It's my honor to treat you to a meal.

506
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,038
Actually, what makes me the happiest...

507
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:49,519
is having a meal with a friend.

508
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:51,559
Since we're friends,

509
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:53,640
sincerity is the most important.

510
00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:55,359
Don't you think so?

511
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:01,160
Yes.

512
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,480
Then...

513
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,559
don't you have anything to say to me?

514
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,519
Well...

515
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,759
Are you full? Should we order more?

516
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:20,799
It's okay.

517
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:22,279
Let's call it a day.

518
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:27,079
I'll take you home.

519
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,640
It's okay. I can go on my own.

520
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:31,279
That's right.

521
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:33,359
The photos from that day are ready.

522
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,160
I'll give them to you another day.

523
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:12,119
(Trending today: "Blue Galaxy" trailer)

524
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:44,359
Hello?

525
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:55,079
Han Hui,

526
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,519
the male lead of "Blue Galaxy" withdrew from the role.

527
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,440
Mr. Jiang from Aurora...

528
00:26:58,559 --> 00:26:59,838
has been calling us lately.

529
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:01,319
He wants to work with you.

530
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,359
What do you think?

531
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:10,160
Arrange a meeting with Jiang Fang as soon as possible.

532
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,519
Okay, I'll do it right away.

533
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,559
Wen Xiao Nuan is really good at expressing herself.

534
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:39,720
You still have such good taste.

535
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,240
When did you learn to be so slick?

536
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,960
I've matured.

537
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:48,319
You think I'm not as childish as I used to be, right?

538
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:51,039
I hope...

539
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,160
we can take this opportunity...

540
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,039
to officially start...

541
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,240
working.

542
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:03,240
I've always admired you...

543
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:06,319
your dedication to your work.

544
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,720
Xiao Nuan.

545
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:18,359
How did it go?

546
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,039
- Director. - Hold on.

547
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:21,759
It's great.

548
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,799
Is this outfit hot?

549
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,439
No, not at all.

550
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,960
Good. You're not finicky at all.

551
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:28,400
I'll do my best.

552
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,640
Learn more from Director Li.

553
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:30,839
Be confident.

554
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:32,920
I still have a lot to learn.

555
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:35,038
Director, we have a problem.

556
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,118
The male lead dropped out.

557
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:37,160
Who told you that?

558
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,079
He even released a statement.

559
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,439
(Statement from Liu Chen Hao's Personal Studio)

560
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,680
(I hereby declare the termination of my contract with "Blue Galaxy"...)

561
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,200
That jerk went straight to releasing a statement?

562
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,599
Where's his professional integrity?

563
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,279
What? Does he think the world can't go on without him?

564
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,160
Director.

565
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,359
Is it because of me?

566
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:12,680
It has nothing to do with you.

567
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:13,799
Don't mind him.

568
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:15,440
Director Li is right.

569
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:16,880
You don't need to feel burdened.

570
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,559
Just focus on your acting.

571
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:19,839
Yes.

572
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,278
(Male lead of "Blue Galaxy" quits)

573
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,959
(I hereby declare the termination of my contract with "Blue Galaxy"...)

574
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,920
(produced by Anning Culture Media Group.)

575
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,079
Ms Han,

576
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,079
do you want me to push this story...

577
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,440
one more time?

578
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:37,119
That's right.

579
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,159
If I can star...

580
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,640
as the female lead in "Blue Galaxy",

581
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,999
then I'll seriously consider...

582
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,640
the terms that Aurora offered me.

583
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,640
I did want to replace Wen Xiao Nuan.

584
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,039
I just didn't have an excuse.

585
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,160
If you are willing to play the leading actress,

586
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,240
I think...

587
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:55,960
there will be no opposition.

588
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,640
Mr. Jiang,

589
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,400
do you have a problem with Wen Xiao Nuan?

590
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:03,200
To be honest,

591
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:05,119
Wen Xiao Nuan is my ex-girlfriend.

592
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:07,480
She can't handle this kind of pressure.

593
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:10,039
I'm afraid she'll be used...

594
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,640
and become a target.

595
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,798
So you think...

596
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:15,200
Wen Xiao Nuan is being used.

597
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:18,400
You know Ye Fei Mo's methods better than I do.

598
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,399
There's just one problem...

599
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,559
I can't figure it out.

600
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,118
Aurora has prepared...

601
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:25,200
a better project for you.

602
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:26,798
But you are insistent...

603
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,239
on choosing "Blue Galaxy".

604
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,240
Why is that?

605
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,680
I came back...

606
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,119
for a heart.

607
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,960
Okay.

608
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:45,559
I get it.

609
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:47,359
We have the same goal.

610
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,039
Give me some time.

611
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,000
Let me take care of "Blue Galaxy".

612
00:30:54,279 --> 00:30:56,160
You're a smart man, Mr. Jiang.

613
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:58,160
I hope we can work well together.

614
00:30:58,359 --> 00:30:59,359
Okay.

615
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,559
Let's work well together.
