1
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,760
(Episode 34)

2
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:31,810
Ling Er.

3
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:35,120
What do you plan to do next?

4
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:37,919
Go back to the fishing village.

5
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:41,560
I believe...

6
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,810
you can get the old Jiang Fang back.

7
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,439
Bye.

8
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,599
Fei Mo.

9
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:24,719
Fei Mo.

10
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,520
I still want to tell you something.

11
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:31,199
You're hiding the truth from Wen Xiao Nuan.

12
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,520
You think you're protecting her.

13
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,960
But to her,

14
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:36,520
this is lying to her.

15
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:42,080
How is it a lie?

16
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:46,639
I don't have to tell her.

17
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,439
We all know.

18
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:55,159
You don't want to drag her down.

19
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:57,080
That's why you drove her away.

20
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,840
We know how much you love Wen Xiao Nuan.

21
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,560
We all see it.

22
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,680
You're hiding it from her now.

23
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,120
But when she finds out,

24
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,240
she'll hate you for the rest of her life.

25
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,319
You're just acting tough.

26
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,919
You worry about her more than anyone else.

27
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,360
What's wrong?

28
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,050
What's wrong, Fei Mo?

29
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,560
Doctor!

30
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:25,920
Hang in there.

31
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,959
Fei Mo, hang in there.

32
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,120
Doctor!

33
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,920
- Fei Mo! - Family members, please leave.

34
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,839
Nuan Nuan.

35
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:56,079
Nuan Nuan!

36
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,759
Nuan Nuan.

37
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:02,279
Nuan Nuan, I...

38
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,480
I know you don't want to see me.

39
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,730
I understand.

40
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,610
After all,

41
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,800
I couldn't keep many of the promises I made.

42
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:15,079
I even hurt you...

43
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,079
and betrayed you.

44
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:20,120
I'm sorry.

45
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:25,050
I'm not asking for your forgiveness by apologizing to you.

46
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,480
I just want you to know...

47
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,318
that I've realized...

48
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:33,000
how outrageous I was.

49
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:35,519
I used to say...

50
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:37,519
that I wanted to be a big shot.

51
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,920
I wanted to dominate the film and television industry.

52
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,360
I wanted to be the best.

53
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:44,639
But now?

54
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:47,759
I didn't achieve any of them.

55
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:52,319
Because I was too ambitious.

56
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,959
I always wanted to take shortcuts.

57
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,439
But you're different.

58
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,319
You're always down to earth.

59
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,838
For your dream,

60
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:09,199
you could take one step at a time.

61
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:13,399
Back then, you said...

62
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,240
you wanted to save Fusheng Theater Troupe.

63
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:16,879
You wanted to be an actress.

64
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,279
I didn't care about your little dream.

65
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,480
But you did it.

66
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,199
And you've done very well.

67
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,600
Look at me.

68
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:35,720
It's like everything was a dream.

69
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,079
Okay.

70
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,759
I just wanted to tell you...

71
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,480
that I know how much I owe you.

72
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,160
I hope that one day,

73
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,000
you'll give me a chance to make it up to you.

74
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,199
You must take good care of yourself.

75
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:01,600
I'll get going.

76
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,199
Jiang Fang!

77
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:06,680
Xiao Kai.

78
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,559
Xiao Kai.

79
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,878
- Jiang Fang, you jerk! - Xiao Kai.

80
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:11,198
- You just won't disappear!
- Xiao Kai, let go!

81
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,599
Why are you still looking for my sister?

82
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,600
Xiao Kai.

83
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:15,198
I just wanted to talk to your sister.

84
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,199
That's it.

85
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,958
Xiao Kai, go back to your room first.

86
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:21,600
- No. - Go.

87
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,240
Nuan Nuan.

88
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,399
I just want to talk to you.

89
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:28,839
Come with me.

90
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,279
The troupe is still the same.

91
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,040
It hasn't changed much.

92
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,040
You did it.

93
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,160
Nuan Nuan, I...

94
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,759
I'm here to sincerely apologize.

95
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,519
I'm sorry.

96
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,959
I've hurt you so much.

97
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,240
It's okay.

98
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,560
I've gotten over it.

99
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:03,600
We should forget about the unhappy things.

100
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,639
It's good now.

101
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,600
We can still talk like old friends.

102
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,600
Yes.

103
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:13,959
We should look forward...

104
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,519
and not live in the past.

105
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Yes.

106
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,399
We shouldn't live in the past.

107
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:27,720
But I still have to make up for my mistakes.

108
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,360
I broke up with Jiang Ling Er.

109
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,240
And...

110
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,159
I left Aurora Film.

111
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:36,519
I plan...

112
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,519
to go back to where I started...

113
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,039
and start afresh.

114
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,159
Jiang Fang.

115
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,360
I feel like...

116
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,679
I'm seeing the same fight you had back then.

117
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,879
I'll still believe in you...

118
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:54,840
just like before.

119
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,559
You can surely succeed.

120
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,360
Okay. Thank you for your well wishes.

121
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,519
All right. That's all...

122
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:04,039
I have to say.

123
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:05,240
I'll take you home.

124
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,159
It's okay. You can go first.

125
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,840
I want to stay longer.

126
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,559
Okay.

127
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,039
I'll get going then.

128
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,559
Nuan Nuan.

129
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,480
There's something...

130
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:24,279
I must tell you.

131
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,519
Ye Fei Mo, he...

132
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,399
He has stomach cancer.

133
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,519
He told me not to tell you, but I think...

134
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:38,240
you have the right to know.

135
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:40,960
And you have the ability...

136
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:42,480
to make your own judgment.

137
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,330
(CT scan report)

138
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,840
Fei Mo.

139
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,090
Why are you here?

140
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,450
Don't you have to work today?

141
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:16,450
Well, I'm here to report to Mr. Ye.

142
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,720
The materials for "Twin Flowers".

143
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:22,600
"Twin Flowers" is quite good.

144
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,559
Wen Xiao Nuan's performance was excellent.

145
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,279
I edited a clip.

146
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:27,919
Do you want to see it?

147
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,679
There's no need.

148
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:35,919
I trust...

149
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,919
your capability.

150
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:39,519
Fei Mo.

151
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:41,279
Running away won't solve the problem.

152
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:43,450
Don't run away from Wen Xiao Nuan.

153
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,240
And don't run away from your love.

154
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:24,799
You promised me.

155
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:27,919
No matter what happens,

156
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:30,519
you'll always be by my side.

157
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,840
To keep me company.

158
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,840
To protect me.

159
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,000
So that I won't be alone and afraid anymore.

160
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,360
But now,

161
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:47,320
why are you running away from me?

162
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,919
You're carrying all the burden by yourself.

163
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,080
You think that leaving me...

164
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:56,879
is the best way to protect me.

165
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,000
But you know what?

166
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,039
What I want is very simple.

167
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,480
A lifetime,

168
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:08,600
forever.

169
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,639
Both of us together.

170
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,279
Even at the end of our lives,

171
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:18,200
we won't be apart.

172
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,720
Wen Xiao Nuan, are you stupid?

173
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:24,440
There were already signs of Ye Fei Mo's stomach problems.

174
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,240
Why are you so stupid?

175
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,600
You didn't even think of it.

176
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:30,639
Why didn't you trust Ye Fei Mo?

177
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:33,840
He's such a bad actor.

178
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:35,359
You can't even see through him.

179
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,600
How can you call yourself an actress?

180
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,720
You just ran away.

181
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,679
You hid and disappeared.

182
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:45,639
You left Ye Fei Mo alone in the hospital...

183
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:47,559
to suffer in pain.

184
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,440
Xiao Nuan, what's wrong?

185
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,518
Did Jiang Fang bully you?

186
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:24,558
I'll deal with him for you.

187
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:25,919
Ye Fei Mo has stomach cancer.

188
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:28,279
I have to go back to him.

189
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:34,960
Xiao Nuan, your phone...

190
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:40,679
Hello?

191
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,398
Why aren't you in the hospital?

192
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:14,720
What are you doing here?

193
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,559
Nuan Nuan.

194
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,840
I...

195
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:29,919
I'm sorry.

196
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,120
I know it was my fault.

197
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,399
I said hurtful things to you.

198
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:39,919
Can you forgive me?

199
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,559
- Come with me to the hospital. - Nuan Nuan.

200
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,240
Listen to me.

201
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,879
Even if this is my last day on earth,

202
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,120
I want to spend it with you.

203
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,039
I love you.

204
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,559
From now on,

205
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:06,399
don't be apart from me...

206
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,200
for a minute or a second.

207
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:11,600
Is that okay?

208
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,519
If only time would freeze.

209
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,039
It feels as if the whole world has stopped.

210
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:56,360
There's just the two of us.

211
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,410
I'm sorry, Nuan Nuan.

212
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,170
We promised to be together forever.

213
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,279
I'm afraid I can't keep that promise anymore.

214
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:22,720
Don't say that.

215
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,480
You'll get better.

216
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:34,119
We still have a lot of places to go together.

217
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:37,170
We still have a lot of things to do together.

218
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:42,319
They say,

219
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:44,599
when life comes to an end,

220
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,960
you want to see the whole world.

221
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,240
But I don't want to go anywhere.

222
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:55,480
I just want to be with you.

223
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,000
To me,

224
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:07,720
you're the best scenery.

225
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,119
Xiao Nuan!

226
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,000
Fei Mo!

227
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:24,170
Xiao Nuan!

228
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,599
Xiao Nuan!

229
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:26,920
What is it?

230
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,480
What are you two doing here?

231
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:35,440
Are you planning to end your lives together?

232
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:37,240
Or confess your love?

233
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:38,920
What nonsense are you talking about?

234
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:42,519
Fei Mo, what's wrong with your phone?

235
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,650
No one can reach you.

236
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:47,170
Not a call went through.

237
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,720
The whole world is looking for you.

238
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:51,119
What's wrong?

239
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:53,920
Everyone in the hospital is looking for him.

240
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:55,519
It's because...

241
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,720
the hospital wants to apologize to him.

242
00:18:57,839 --> 00:18:59,039
They said it was a misdiagnosis.

243
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:01,440
He doesn't have stomach cancer at all.

244
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,720
Really?

245
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:04,759
Yes.

246
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:08,559
That's great!

247
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:11,480
I'll be gentle.

248
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:15,440
That's great.

249
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:40,359
Mister, miss. How about a flower?

250
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:41,519
Okay.

251
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,920
Thank you.

252
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,559
Mister, miss. How about a flower?

253
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:52,890
Sure.

254
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:54,839
Thank you.

255
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,359
Mister, how about a flower?

256
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,440
No.

257
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:00,960
No?

258
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,838
Miss, do you want to buy a rose?

259
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:04,890
No.

260
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,200
Miss.

261
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:17,799
Are you talking to me?

262
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,079
You're as pretty as the flower.

263
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,358
Don't be sad.

264
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:25,319
It breaks my heart to see you sad.

265
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,960
Yun Zhou, is that you?

266
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,319
Miss, are you lost?

267
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:14,039
It's okay if you are.

268
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,680
As long as you go back to where it started,

269
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:17,359
everything can start afresh.

270
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:19,319
Right.

271
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,759
Heart.

272
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,410
I'll always be waiting for you at where we started.

273
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,319
No matter when you turn around,

274
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:33,890
I'll be there.

275
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,239
(I'll always be waiting for you at where we started.)

276
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,480
(No matter when you turn around, I'll be there.)

277
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:04,640
It's a prank.

278
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,039
It must be a prank.

279
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,759
You threw him away yourself.

280
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:13,759
What are you expecting?

281
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,119
Jia Yi.

282
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:35,400
You don't have to say anything.

283
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:37,839
I understand.

284
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:40,079
I know you're scared.

285
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,000
I know you're suffering.

286
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:44,799
I know you're running away.

287
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,720
I understand.

288
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:49,199
I also know...

289
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,799
that you are most concerned...

290
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,559
about my family background.

291
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,440
We grew up in different environments.

292
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:56,759
So in terms of perspective,

293
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,319
there are some differences.

294
00:22:58,799 --> 00:22:59,920
But...

295
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:02,680
Wang Jia Yi.

296
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:06,200
I love you.

297
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,279
I'm sure my love for you...

298
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:12,200
even outweighs...

299
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:14,359
my fear of an uncertain future.

300
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:17,119
I don't want to give up...

301
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,358
every minute and every second with you...

302
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:20,640
because of the unknown future.

303
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,480
As long as I can be with you,

304
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:26,640
I'm not afraid of anything.

305
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,519
Didn't you say...

306
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:32,480
that we're all grown up...

307
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:33,839
and not kids anymore?

308
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:36,319
So we should think carefully about what we do.

309
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,359
So I'm going to make...

310
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,920
the biggest decision of my life.

311
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,920
Jia Yi.

312
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,759
Will you marry me?
