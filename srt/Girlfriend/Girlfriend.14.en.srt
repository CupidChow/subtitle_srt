1
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:41,560
Your foot is red.

2
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:44,719
Does it hurt?

3
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:03,480
I'll take you to the hospital.

4
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,199
I'm fine.

5
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,799
Take us home first.

6
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,478
You're badly injured. How can you go home?

7
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,479
Let's go to the hospital first.

8
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,639
(Emergency Room)

9
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,960
- Are you feeling better? - I'm fine.

10
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,599
Thank you.

11
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,639
You're welcome.

12
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,039
Nurse, the bill has been paid.

13
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,198
She's not seriously injured, right?

14
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:42,918
It's fine. It's just a sprain.

15
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:44,000
Nothing is broken.

16
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,079
She'll be fine after a few days of cold compresses.

17
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,080
Thank you.

18
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:47,478
I told you I'm fine.

19
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,598
Why did you insist on coming?

20
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:50,240
Coming to the hospital to get it checked out is better...

21
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,319
for peace of mind.

22
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,599
Thank you.

23
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:56,799
Your suit is quite nice.

24
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,800
It must be expensive.

25
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,120
How can I afford this?

26
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,839
I rented it.

27
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,878
I just came back...

28
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:09,879
from a job at a wedding.

29
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:13,878
Wasn't that Director Li's car?

30
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:15,280
Are you still driving it today?

31
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,319
Yes, that's...

32
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,879
Here's the thing about Director Li's car.

33
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,280
He...

34
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,758
He's busy today.

35
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:27,319
So he asked me to wash his car.

36
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,679
Well...

37
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,318
How much is the hospital bill? I'll wire it to you.

38
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,359
It's okay.

39
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,999
- No way. - It's okay.

40
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,239
You work part-time to make money, right?

41
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,759
I have to make this worth your while.

42
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,639
Fei Mo.

43
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,918
Do you still have the imported medicine...

44
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:53,680
that you used when you got injured from boxing?

45
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,120
Are you injured?

46
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,080
It's not me. It's Jia Yi.

47
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,119
She walked the red carpet at an anniversary party.

48
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,199
She sprained her ankle.

49
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,119
It's not easy...

50
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,158
to be an actress these days.

51
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,439
They have to wear high heels everywhere.

52
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,919
They can easily get injured.

53
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,960
Jia Yi's and Wen Xiao Nuan's heels...

54
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:09,800
are too high.

55
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:11,639
Hold on.

56
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,799
I have to get Jia Yi a pair of sneakers.

57
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,559
From now on, if she doesn't have to wear high heels,

58
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,610
then she shouldn't.

59
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,758
Especially on set.

60
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,560
There are items all over the place. She could get hurt easily.

61
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:23,839
Is this it?

62
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,000
It can be applied externally or taken orally.

63
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,730
Okay. Well, I won't give it back.

64
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,680
Hello, sir.

65
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,439
Are you Mr. Ye from Anning?

66
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,360
Show me your best women's shoes.

67
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,000
Okay, Mr. Ye. Please wait a moment.

68
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:07,838
Mr. Ye, these two pairs of sneakers...

69
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:09,240
are this year's latest styles.

70
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,759
They're also the best in our store.

71
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,559
The white one.

72
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,560
Size 37.

73
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:21,518
Mr. Ye, this is in a couple's set.

74
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:22,800
We have a matching pair of men's shoes.

75
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:24,559
If you're giving it to your girlfriend or wife,

76
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,609
why don't you buy two pairs?

77
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:26,610
You can get a discount too.

78
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,839
I'm buying it for my mom.

79
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,199
I'll wrap it up for you.

80
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,040
Come back.

81
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,879
Those men's shoes.

82
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,639
Wrap them up for me too.

83
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,359
They're...shoes for couples.

84
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,480
I'm buying it for my dad.

85
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:55,679
Mr. Ye, you're so filial.

86
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,759
Just a moment.

87
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,720
Mr. Ye, this is Wen Xiao Nuan's bedtime photo today.

88
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:36,920
Wen Xiao Nuan,

89
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,359
the company's special training regulations...

90
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,439
have been modified.

91
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:40,720
In the future,

92
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:43,199
wear this pair of shoes to work.

93
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:48,560
Wen Xiao Nuan,

94
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,759
this pair of shoes really suits you.

95
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,959
Take them.

96
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:57,319
Take them.

97
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:40,839
This...

98
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,360
Why is there so much water?

99
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,680
I don't know.

100
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:46,839
I'm doomed.

101
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,479
The new shoes the company bought...

102
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,600
are going to get dirty.

103
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,240
Take off your shoes.

104
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,040
Take off your shoes.

105
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,759
That's right.

106
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,800
I'll take off my shoes...

107
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:00,000
and walk across barefoot.

108
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
What are you doing?

109
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,560
Helping me?

110
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,679
You did something unnecessary.

111
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,519
Now I have no shoes to wear.

112
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,039
How can I work on set?

113
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,278
There's a pair next to you.

114
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,960
I can't wear your shoes.

115
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:47,759
Women's shoes?

116
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,840
But these are flat.

117
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,239
Didn't you say...

118
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,599
I have to wear high heels...

119
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,799
when I'm not sleeping or dancing?

120
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,639
An artist's posture is very important.

121
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:58,519
Otherwise, you'll deduct my points again.

122
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,959
No, take me home now.

123
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,120
I'm going to pick up my shoes.

124
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:14,839
Put them on.

125
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,239
I can't wear flat shoes.

126
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,518
I have to wear high heels.

127
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,558
If you don't take me home,

128
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,720
I'll run back barefoot.

129
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:22,878
Ye Fei Mo, listen.

130
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:23,918
Don't be like this.

131
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:25,360
I'll scream if you don't stop.

132
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:26,450
Don't move.

133
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:31,679
Try them out.

134
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:43,240
It seems...

135
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,039
to fit quite well.

136
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:06,798
Are you afraid...

137
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,918
I'll sprain my ankle like Jia Yi?

138
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:09,279
Is that why you gave me the shoes?

139
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,440
You're thinking too much.

140
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,120
Ye Fei Mo.

141
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,000
Mr. Ye.

142
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,360
Well,

143
00:11:52,361 --> 00:11:54,399
can you promise me something?

144
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:55,519
What is it?

145
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,638
Promise me first.

146
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:57,720
You tell me first.

147
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,839
Promise me first.

148
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,879
Then don't say anything.

149
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,600
Ye Fei Mo, you...

150
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,518
Well, look.

151
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:11,878
Can you stop the car...

152
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:14,039
in a secluded spot?

153
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,239
Because I'm afraid...

154
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,679
my colleagues will see me...

155
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,600
get out of your car.

156
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,320
That's not good.

157
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:30,879
You're heartless.

158
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:43,919
Get out of the car.

159
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,440
There are few people here.

160
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:48,840
Thank you, Mr. Ye.

161
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,279
Ready, action.

162
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,440
Cut.

163
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:44,359
Director, did I do it wrong again?

164
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,480
No, you didn't.

165
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,360
But...

166
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:49,878
It's not perfect enough.

167
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:50,919
It's not the best.

168
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,840
Wen Xiao Nuan, if it's not the best,

169
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,399
it's meaningless.

170
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,360
Understand?

171
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:01,839
I understand.

172
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,879
Go touch up your makeup.

173
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,239
Adjust your condition.

174
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,480
Let's do it again later.

175
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,279
Okay.

176
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,999
Xiao Nuan.

177
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,319
Xiao Mei? Why are you here?

178
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,398
Xiao Jing asked me...

179
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,519
to be your assistant from now on.

180
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:25,158
Really? Have a seat.

181
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:26,319
It's okay. I'll stand.

182
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,239
Sit down and rest. I'm fixing my makeup. It's fine.

183
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,440
Thank you, Xiao Nuan.

184
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,879
Xiao Nuan, water.

185
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:34,240
I'll drink it later.

186
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,120
Xiao Nuan, you've been running all morning.

187
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,679
There's enough material for a trailer for a marathon.

188
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:44,558
What's wrong with Director Li?

189
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:45,559
He didn't even ask...

190
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,559
Don't talk like that again.

191
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:48,758
Director Li just wants...

192
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:50,359
to make the shoot to come out better, right?

193
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,320
Xiao Nuan, I feel bad for you.

194
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,119
Look how tired you are.

195
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,398
It's too hard.

196
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:56,599
How is it hard?

197
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,518
Tell me. What job isn't hard now?

198
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:00,079
It's hard to be my assistant too.

199
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,000
I don't think Mr. Ye has it hard.

200
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,240
Mr. Ye works the hardest.

201
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:07,758
He has so many people working for him every day.

202
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:09,039
What's so hard for him?

203
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,518
He has a long face every day.

204
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:11,558
If anything comes up,

205
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:12,840
he has to keep a straight face.

206
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,319
He has to come up with evil ideas...

207
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,359
on how he can prank others.

208
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,679
He's working so hard.

209
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,320
Wen Xiao Nuan, are you ready?

210
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Yes.

211
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,639
Let's go.

212
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,320
One more take.

213
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,200
Cut.

214
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,440
Thank you, everyone.

215
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,320
Let's eat first.

216
00:16:05,321 --> 00:16:06,679
We'll resume filming in an hour.

217
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,079
Okay, let's eat.

218
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,759
We'll resume filming in an hour.

219
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:11,758
This is the following script.
Familiarize yourself with it.

220
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:12,799
Okay.

221
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:17,638
Turn up the light on the left.

222
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:19,798
Director, is there a kissing scene after this?

223
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:20,799
Yes, there is.

224
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,319
Who's the male lead?

225
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,320
Anning's top guy.

226
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,878
Anning's top guy?

227
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:25,960
And the one in the middle.

228
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,440
Move it a little to the right.

229
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:31,558
Xiao Mei, I might have a kissing scene...

230
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:32,559
with Mo Xiao Bai!

231
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,158
Is Mo Xiao Bai the male lead?

232
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,360
The director just said so himself.

233
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:36,840
What should I do?

234
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:38,679
Mo Xiao Bai is handsome and a good actor.

235
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:40,720
I can't believe I'll be working with him so soon!

236
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,158
And it's even a kissing scene!

237
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:43,159
No way.

238
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:44,960
Hurry, give me gum.

239
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,080
Hurry.

240
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,600
Water.

241
00:16:51,601 --> 00:16:52,960
Give me some water.

242
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,200
Okay.

243
00:16:54,201 --> 00:16:56,199
No, give me some lipstick first.

244
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,279
I'll drink water after I put on lipstick.

245
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:58,759
Take this.

246
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,200
What should I do?

247
00:17:04,201 --> 00:17:06,359
What will the director want?

248
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,079
No, I have to get ready in advance.

249
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:12,680
Xiao Nuan, you seem to be trembling.

250
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:16,410
No, I'm just excited!

251
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:17,919
Let's go. I'll touch up my makeup.

252
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,039
- Okay. - Touch up my makeup.

253
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:31,410
What?

254
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,680
How can you be Anning's top guy?

255
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:36,959
Am I not?

256
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,170
- Yes, you are. - Yes, you are.

257
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,480
I strongly oppose this arrangement.

258
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:52,039
This is clearly an abuse of power.

259
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,439
You should know...

260
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,838
that the company has set a target...

261
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:56,920
for the number of likes and comments for this trailer.

262
00:17:57,559 --> 00:17:59,169
According to a survey,

263
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:01,169
the number of clicks for a trailer with a kiss scene...

264
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:02,318
is over 30 percent higher...

265
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:03,890
than those without kissing scenes.

266
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,919
Therefore, setting up this kiss scene...

267
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,518
was both for the sake of the drama...

268
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:09,839
and for your sake.

269
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,038
You should show...

270
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,318
the basic professionalism...

271
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:13,650
that an actor should have.

272
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,038
Ye Fei Mo, you're obviously...

273
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:19,480
abusing your power for personal gain.

274
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:21,170
You're overthinking it.

275
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,279
Mr. Ye, please get changed.

276
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,919
This is our plan for Ms. Han's development...

277
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,479
in the next three years.

278
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,519
Please take a look.

279
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:39,599
I need to take this. Hold on.

280
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:43,319
Hello?

281
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:50,650
Okay.

282
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,799
(Personal Style)

283
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:55,359
I got it.

284
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,519
I just got some news.

285
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,440
The female lead of the trailer for "Blue Galaxy"...

286
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,720
is Wen Xiao Nuan.

287
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,480
I knew it.

288
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:15,519
I was wondering why she has been doing so many events lately.

289
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,599
They want to promote her.

290
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,079
But...

291
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:23,319
there's something even more surprising.

292
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:24,890
What is it?

293
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:27,039
The male lead is Ye Fei Mo.

294
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:29,720
- Fei Mo? - Yes.

295
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Rumor has it that...

296
00:19:31,001 --> 00:19:32,799
he's taking the role himself for Wen Xiao Nuan.

297
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,240
Of course, it could be...

298
00:19:37,241 --> 00:19:38,319
that I was misinformed.

299
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:40,000
They're filming right now.

300
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,759
I get news anytime and anywhere.

301
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,240
Where are they filming?

302
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,240
The New Element Factory.

303
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:46,920
Even for a trailer,

304
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:48,960
they're spending a lot on "Blue Galaxy".

305
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:50,480
Mr. Jiang, excuse me.

306
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,240
Ms. Han.

307
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,240
Ms. Han, where are you going?

308
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,169
You said I have no professionalism.

309
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,318
What about your own professionalism...

310
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,410
as a boss?

311
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,680
What did you eat?

312
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,799
All departments, take your positions.

313
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:31,799
All departments, take your positions.

314
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:34,440
Scene 7, Shot 1, Take 1.

315
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:47,650
Cut.

316
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:48,799
Fei Mo,

317
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,599
this is the person you love the most.

318
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,170
You would appreciate her and care about her.

319
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,720
Show more tenderness.

320
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:56,559
Scene 7, Shot 1, Take 2.

321
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:13,359
Cut.

322
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:17,200
Fei Mo, this time,

323
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,479
relax your expression more.

324
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,559
Don't frown.

325
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:24,279
Scene 7, Shot 1, Take 3.

326
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:28,039
Three, two, one, action.

327
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:36,079
Cut.

328
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:38,410
Cut.

329
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,920
Cut.

330
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:46,839
Fei Mo, you are deeply in love.

331
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,680
Don't close your mouth so tightly.

332
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,079
Fei Mo.

333
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:56,359
How about this?

334
00:21:57,759 --> 00:21:59,000
Let's fake it with camera angles.

335
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,400
Good idea.

336
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,480
Mr. Ye.

337
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,479
In front of the camera,

338
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,400
you're a professional actor.

339
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,319
How can you be so unprofessional?

340
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,680
How can you fake it?

341
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,480
Han Hui.

342
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:50,680
- Xiao Nuan! - Xiao Nuan!

343
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:54,999
Did you kiss Mr. Ye?

344
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,480
Did you kiss Mr. Ye?

345
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,598
We were just filming.

346
00:22:58,599 --> 00:22:59,879
You kissed Mr. Ye.

347
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,000
What is there to be embarrassed about?

348
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:04,240
- Let's go. - Let's go.

349
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:26,400
In half an hour,

350
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,679
the first trailer for "Blue Galaxy"...

351
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,200
will be released worldwide.

352
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:32,759
To the company, this project...

353
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,599
has extraordinary significance and value.

354
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,400
I know...

355
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,439
that everyone has been putting in great efforts...

356
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,518
and working overtime...

357
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:40,680
on this trailer recently.

358
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,160
So in this last moment,

359
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:45,920
I hope everyone can be prepared...

360
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:48,000
and conduct a final confirmation of the materials.

361
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:49,960
We must make no mistakes.

362
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,519
Let's win this battle together.

363
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,758
Are you confident?

364
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:54,798
- Yes. - Yes.

365
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:55,879
Good.

366
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,880
All departments, report.

367
00:23:56,881 --> 00:23:58,598
The three major domestic video platforms are ready.

368
00:23:58,599 --> 00:23:59,679
The ten major video platforms...

369
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,798
in Europe, America, and Australia...

370
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:01,838
are ready.

371
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:04,038
Our official site and social media pages are ready.

372
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:06,159
Ground promotional materials have been deployed.

373
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,798
Airports, high-speed train stations, and bus stations...

374
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,719
in 34 provincial cities are all covered.

375
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,799
Very good.

376
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,839
Keep up the good work, everyone.

377
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,079
You're quite calm.

378
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,880
This is Wen Xiao Nuan's debut.

379
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,799
Aren't you worried at all?

380
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,440
Li Can directed it.

381
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:35,000
Anning produced it.

382
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,720
I starred in it.

383
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:38,079
Should I be worried?

384
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:41,839
Aren't you worried that this trailer...

385
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,799
doesn't do well online...

386
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,880
and hurts Wen Xiao Nuan's feelings?

387
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,880
Among all the segments,

388
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,960
the weakest link...

389
00:24:48,961 --> 00:24:50,959
is the commander who left his post without permission,

390
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,039
Gu Yun Zhou.

391
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:53,720
If anything goes wrong,

392
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,319
he'll be the one to blame.

393
00:24:56,839 --> 00:24:58,558
So you've already found a scapegoat.

394
00:24:58,559 --> 00:24:59,599
Let me tell you.

395
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:01,598
All my departments...

396
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:02,758
are ready.

397
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:04,119
We're just waiting for the final countdown.

398
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,519
Don't frame me.

399
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,200
Okay, I won't bother you.

400
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,319
I'll get going.

401
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:15,599
By the way,

402
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:17,558
there's something...

403
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:18,680
I need to remind you of.

404
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,440
For a newbie,

405
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:22,599
this is the toughest time for her.

406
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,119
Why can't I stand on tiptoes?

407
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:15,400
Are you nervous?

408
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:21,199
What would I be nervous about?

409
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,719
Why would I be? Listen up.

410
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,838
I'm not afraid of you now.

411
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:25,440
About the launch of the trailer.

412
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,119
I'm a little nervous.

413
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:37,680
I'm afraid that if it doesn't turn out well,

414
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,279
I'll have let everyone down.

415
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,759
I personally reviewed the work.

416
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:44,519
There's no chance that it won't turn out well.

417
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:48,679
I'm talking about the off chance.
What if it does turn out bad?

418
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,279
Then it must be your fault.

419
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:53,999
It must be because you ate pickled garlic...

420
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,480
before filming the kissing scene.

421
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:23,038
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five,

422
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:27,079
four, three, two, one.

423
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,400
