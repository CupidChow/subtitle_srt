1
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,719
I made a reservation at a restaurant.

2
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,319
We can talk over a meal.

3
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,640
I have something to do.

4
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:46,799
See her out.

5
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:47,799
Where are you going?

6
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:49,680
Ms. Han, this way, please.

7
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,560
Now I know what relationship they have.

8
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:56,400
None at all.

9
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,680
How did it go?

10
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,090
Okay, I got it.

11
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:41,680
Ms. Han.

12
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:44,080
What a coincidence.

13
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:47,239
Mr. Jiang, you've come looking for Ms. Han...

14
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,800
all the way to Anning's door.

15
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,638
You've really put in a lot of effort.

16
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:52,400
A coincidence. Truly just a coincidence.

17
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,959
Mr. Ye asked me to come here...

18
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,080
to talk about "Blue Galaxy".

19
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,280
What's the matter, Ms. Han?

20
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:57,599
Are you here to see Mr. Ye too?

21
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,839
We just happened to pass by.

22
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,439
We just dropped by to visit her former workplace.

23
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:07,280
Ms. Han, you're really nostalgic.

24
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:09,878
By the way, there's a cafe nearby...

25
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:11,240
if you're willing to go.

26
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,960
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

27
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:17,520
Don't mention it.

28
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,360
It's my honor to buy you coffee.

29
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,560
Please.

30
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,560
It's only right...

31
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,639
that you pay your debts.

32
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:43,159
Haven't we already paid our debts?

33
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,400
Xiao Kai,

34
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:47,599
didn't you give the money to the landlord?

35
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:50,280
I did give the money to the landlord, Xiao Nuan.

36
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,519
The landlord raised the amount.

37
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,959
He demanded even more money from us.

38
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,999
I couldn't pay him back.

39
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,199
Xiao Nuan, I didn't want to burden you.

40
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:59,159
So I borrowed some money from them.

41
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,919
I didn't expect that I couldn't pay him back later.

42
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,560
How much more do you need?

43
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,360
How much more?

44
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,800
One million yuan?

45
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,680
I've already paid off one million.

46
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,199
Look carefully.

47
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,920
Penalty for breach of contract.

48
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,000
Another one million yuan.

49
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,120
Xiao Kai.

50
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,049
Sir, where are we going to get one million yuan...

51
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,680
to pay you back?

52
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:48,999
We grew up without parents.

53
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,559
Where can I get you another one million yuan?

54
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,518
- Sir, let me off.
- I know you don't have money.

55
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:53,610
Xiao Kai.

56
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,050
You're his sister, right?

57
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:58,759
You can pay off your brother's debt.

58
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:05,560
Stay away from my sister!

59
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,879
Don't go near my sister!

60
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,170
Let go!

61
00:05:09,171 --> 00:05:10,279
- Xiao Kai! - Hit him!

62
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:12,399
- Xiao Kai! - Don't go over there.

63
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,639
- Ye Fei Mo. - Yun Zhou.

64
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:36,319
How much does she owe you?

65
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,199
One million yuan.

66
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:42,720
Get lost.

67
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Let's go.

68
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,560
Are you hurt?

69
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:53,480
I'm fine.

70
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,160
Xiao Kai.

71
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,719
- Xiao Kai. - Xiao Nuan.

72
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,359
- Xiao Kai, are you all right? - I'm fine.

73
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,360
- How are you? - I'm fine.

74
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:00,600
- How's your injury? - I'm fine.

75
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:06,079
- What are you doing? - Brother-in-law.

76
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:08,198
Who's your brother-in-law? Don't talk nonsense.

77
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:10,160
He must be my brother-in-law!

78
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,519
Did you see that?

79
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,800
His kick just now.

80
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:15,360
He's so cool.

81
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,360
And did you see how he tossed that check?

82
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,679
- He's so cool. - Xiao Kai.

83
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,999
Don't say anything.

84
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,239
I saw how he was concerned about you.

85
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,279
That gentle gaze.

86
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,759
You're so cool, my brother-in-law!

87
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:31,720
Drum roll. Here's the main point.

88
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,399
I have an announcement to make!

89
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:36,279
From now on, I, Wen Kai,

90
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,800
have a brother-in-law.

91
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,479
It's Mr. Ye.

92
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,839
Mr. Ye is my brother-in-law.

93
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,040
My brother-in-law is a CEO!

94
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,160
Do you know me?

95
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,920
I recognize you.

96
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,000
But I only saw you on TV.

97
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:59,480
This is my first time seeing you in person.

98
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,560
But...

99
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,800
even the screen can't diminish your handsomeness.

100
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:04,719
You're too handsome.

101
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,839
How does the saying go?

102
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:08,479
You're just great.

103
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,079
Don't talk nonsense.

104
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,519
Jia Yi, help me check Xiao Kai's injury.

105
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:18,519
I have to talk to you.

106
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,560
Ye Fei Mo.

107
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:26,479
That's enough. Does your face hurt?

108
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,800
It doesn't hurt much.

109
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,480
- Sit down. - He's so manly.

110
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:31,879
Ms. Han,

111
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,719
these are the projects...

112
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,519
that Aurora plans to invest heavily in.

113
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,839
If you're interested,

114
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:39,319
we'll plan around you...

115
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,920
for the next few years.

116
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,319
It seems like you don't know me well.

117
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,800
I always look at the person first...

118
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,240
before I talk business.

119
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,120
Do you have a bad impression of me?

120
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,160
That's not what I mean.

121
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,399
It's just that...

122
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,560
I haven't had much chance to get to know you.

123
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,800
I hope you can...

124
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,360
give me more time.

125
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:05,480
You mean...

126
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,040
build trust first...

127
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,879
before discussing benefits, right?

128
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,079
You're a smart man.

129
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,079
No problem.

130
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:16,879
I believe both Aurora and I...

131
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,360
won't disappoint you.

132
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,159
Thank you for what you did just now.

133
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:35,450
You're welcome.

134
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,159
I just can't stand seeing a man...

135
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,720
bullying a girl.

136
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,240
Also, my brother has no filter.

137
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:44,480
I hope you don't mind.

138
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:47,600
You're indeed bound to those who give you gifts.

139
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,240
Your attitude changes...

140
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:51,000
when you owe someone money.

141
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,480
I'll definitely pay the one million yuan back to you.

142
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,879
How will you repay me?

143
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,279
What are you doing?

144
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,639
Let me tell you.

145
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,519
No matter how rich you are,

146
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:10,480
don't even think about taking advantage of me.

147
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:12,799
Don't misunderstand.

148
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:14,240
And don't overthink it.

149
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,960
I just want to ask you.

150
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,210
How are you going to pay me back?

151
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,639
Play the little nurse again?

152
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:23,279
Ye Fei Mo,

153
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,679
it's true that I don't have money right now.

154
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,480
But I'll make enough to pay you back.

155
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:29,450
You don't even have a job now.

156
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:30,799
How are you going to make money?

157
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,480
I can get acting jobs and commercials.

158
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,089
I don't care if I have to be a strawberry or an orange.

159
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:36,120
I'll do it.

160
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,399
You're just a rookie.

161
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,000
When you make a million dollars,

162
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,799
when will that be?

163
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,759
If that doesn't work,

164
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,639
I'll go to the amusement park...

165
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,330
and play a zombie...

166
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,559
or an animal.

167
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:53,759
And then?

168
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:57,090
I'll definitely pay you back.

169
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:05,000
Sign this contract.

170
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:07,090
I'll forget about the money you owe me.

171
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,450
I won't sign it.

172
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,279
Then pay me back now.

173
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,120
I'm your creditor.

174
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,120
Ye Fei Mo,

175
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:20,119
you're taking advantage of me.

176
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,959
You're kicking me when I'm down.

177
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,090
Ms. Wen.

178
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:25,038
This isn't my first time...

179
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:26,090
inviting you to join Anning.

180
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:28,210
What I value...

181
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:29,840
is an artist's potential.

182
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,090
I'm a businessman.

183
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,279
I paid off your debt...

184
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:35,960
because I believe...

185
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,240
you can help Anning...

186
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:38,559
make even more money.

187
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,450
But you keep misunderstanding me...

188
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,600
based on your small-mindedness.

189
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:46,919
You can take a good look at this contract.

190
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:49,480
There are no unjustified clauses.

191
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:51,679
For a rookie like you,

192
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,279
this must be a dream opportunity.

193
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,200
If I make a million dollars,

194
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:19,278
can I terminate the contract anytime?

195
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,279
Yes.

196
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,399
When you make a million dollars,

197
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:23,960
you'll have wings...

198
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,639
and can fly freely.

199
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:28,200
All right.

200
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:29,759
I'll sign it.

201

(Anning Culture Media Group, S-class Management Contract)

202
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,960
Good. Now you can help me apply ointment.

203
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:51,320
I signed a management contract, not an indenture.

204
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:52,960
Come on, miss.

205
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,639
I saved a damsel in distress and got hurt.

206
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,600
Can't you be a little more humanitarian?

207
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,360
Thank you so much for today.
I'm sorry to have troubled you.

208
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:13,879
It's fine.

209
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,519
- Are you okay? - Are you okay?

210
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,360
I'm fine.

211
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:32,200
Today,

212
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,200
you were quite cool.

213
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,038
I have something to do.

214
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:42,039
I'll get going.

215
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,240
Don't rush.

216
00:12:43,241 --> 00:12:44,879
Go on. Good luck.

217
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,960
Let me walk you out.

218
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,320
I really thought it was marble.

219
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,039
It smells so good.

220
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:11,679
Xiao Nuan.

221
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,320
- Are you okay? - I'm fine.

222
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:23,679
Why are you alone?
Where's my brother-in-law?

223
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,639
What brother-in-law? Don't call him that.

224
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:29,278
We're boss and employee now.

225
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,360
What brother-in-law?

226
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,159
An S-class artist!

227
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:40,679
Xiao Nuan!

228
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,200
Xiao Nuan.

229
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:45,519
I think it's necessary for me...

230
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,639
to have a serious talk with you.

231
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,479
Xiao Nuan, you're not yourself anymore.

232
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,480
Do you know that?

233
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,879
You're the whole village's hope now.

234
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,679
You're about to reach the peak of your life, Xiao Nuan.

235
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:59,000
You have to learn to protect yourself, all right?

236
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:02,279
As for me, Wen Kai,

237
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,759
I'm no longer just Wen Kai.

238
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:06,600
My brother-in-law...

239
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:08,240
is a CEO.

240
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:11,000
My sister is a big star.

241
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,840
Of course, Xiao Nuan, don't look down on me.

242
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,320
I'm going to do my own thing soon.

243
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,200
I'm going to lead our small troupe.

244
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:19,240
I'm going to do something.

245
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:22,080
An intangible cultural heritage heir or something.

246
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:23,480
You're not seriously injured, right?

247
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,960
If not, then go back to the troupe.

248
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm telling you.

249
00:14:27,001 --> 00:14:28,440
Don't cause me any more trouble.

250
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,879
What do you mean by trouble, Xiao Nuan?

251
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:33,399
I'm going to say something that will upset you.

252
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,480
Back then, Jiang Fang...

253
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:37,158
Didn't I tell you?

254
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:38,558
I said you two wouldn't last long.

255
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:40,159
I got angry just looking at him.

256
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:42,758
It just didn't feel right to call him my brother-in-law.

257
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:44,319
He's skinny like a monkey.

258
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,559
How could he protect you?

259
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:47,639
Look at my brother-in-law now.

260
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,918
He's also slim,

261
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:50,720
but his slimness is different.

262
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,399
It's pleasant on the eyes.

263
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,720
It feels right to call him my brother-in-law.

264
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,720
My brother-in-law, the CEO. Listen, Xiao Nuan.

265
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,360
My brother-in-law, the CEO.

266
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,599
Stop it. Are you going back or not?

267
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,678
- Are you going back now? - I'm going back.

268
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:04,239
- I won't disturb your happy life. - Go.

269
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,558
- I'm going back.
- Stop saying CEO brother-in-law.

270
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:06,638
Who the heck is that?

271
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,398
How many times have I told you? He's not.

272
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,440
Wait.

273
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,600
There's one more thing.

274
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:12,600
I was in a hurry.

275
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,320
Give me some money.

276
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,999
I'll go, then.

277
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,519
Gosh, you're always like this.

278
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:18,639

Hello, Xiao Jing.

281

Wen Xiao Nuan,

282
00:15:51,441 --> 00:15:53,039
did you get the email I sent you?

283
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:56,080

As Anning's S-class artist,

287

you have to be on standby 24 hours a day...

288

00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,119
I'm getting up now. I'll be there soon.

You're just in time.

I'm leaving at the same time.

302
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,320
I can consider...

303

giving you a ride.

304
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,890
Sorry, the subway was too crowded.

Mr. Ye.

321

You're an Anning S-class artist.

322
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,039
You're late on your first day of work.

323
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,000
That means you have poor self-management.

324
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,839
Half a day's pay will be deducted...

325

as punishment.

326

I wasn't late.

327

It's company policy.

to any job assigned to them.

If you're on time,

331
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:01,839
that means you're late.

332
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,240
Then...

333
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,039

from the Production Department.

339
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,200
No mistakes are allowed.

340
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:28,038
This is our Project Department.

341
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:29,409
All of our company's projects...

342
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:30,680
are incubated here.

343
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:33,680
This is our dance studio and rehearsal studio.

344
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,519
So this is the training of an S-class artist.

345
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:39,838
From now on, all your training and rehearsals...

346
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:41,118
will take place here.

347
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,649
For every subject,

348
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,999
we'll hire the best teachers in China.

349
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,479
As an S-class artist,

350
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,680
you must excel in every subject.

351
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,279
I'll do my best.

352
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:53,518
Let's start with a basic evaluation.

353
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:55,078
Based on your test results,

354
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:56,519
we'll come up with a training course.

355
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,920
Mr. Ye?

356
00:18:57,921 --> 00:18:59,000
What are you...

357
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Mr. Ye.

358
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,719
S-class artists...

359
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,319
are the main focus of Anning's management business.

360
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:06,999
I've decided to personally supervise...

361
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,519
the artist's first day of classes.

362
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:14,650
- Hello, Mr. Ye. - Hello, Mr. Ye.

363
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,319
Be gentle, ma'am.

364
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:20,559
It hurts.

365
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:24,920
Flexibility,

366
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:26,170
physical ability,

367
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:27,480
and coordination...

368
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,720
are all bad.

369
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,358
Body fat is off the charts.

370
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:33,169
Serious dark circles under the eyes. A lot of wrinkles.

371
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:34,439
Hunched over. Poor posture.

372
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,078
You must go to sleep before 11pm every day.

373
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:37,558
Before going to bed, you must take a picture of yourself...

374
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:38,649
and send it to the agency.

375
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,118
During training, your phone is confiscated.

376
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:41,278
You can't make any calls.

377
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:42,279
The Management Department will monitor that.

378
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:43,279
Yes.

379
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,078
Except for when you are sleeping and dancing,

380
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:46,119
you have to wear high heels every day.

381
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,680
It's not easy...

382
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:50,839
to be Anning's S-class artist.

383
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:52,759
If you can't do it,

384
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,319
you can leave right now.

385
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,359
I can definitely do it!

386
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,720
I...

387
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:04,000
Don't try to scare me.

388
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:23,960
Let's order this one.

389
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,000
- Settle the bill. - Okay.

390
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,680
Well...

391
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,599
Mr. Jiang already paid.

392
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:43,599
You turned down so many sponsorships from high-end dress brands.

393
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:45,319
You only choose the brands you like.

394
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:47,170
That's entirely your style.

395
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,279
Very impressive.

396
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,359
It's something I like.

397
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,319
You shouldn't have, Mr. Jiang.

398
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:56,599
You're welcome, Ms. Han.

399
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,240
It's my honor...

400
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,720
to do something for you.

401
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,720
Choosing a dress requires a lot of energy.

402
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,719
This is a private restaurant.

403
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,759
The environment is not bad.

404
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,719
If you're interested,

405
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,839
you can give it a try.

406
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:18,480
The restaurant has been cleared out.

407
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,960
I guarantee you will have...

408
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:22,119
a quiet and comfortable environment.

409
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:25,119
You're so thoughtful, Mr. Jiang.

410
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:27,039
If there's nothing else,

411
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:28,359
I'll leave you be.

412
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:33,920
Are you free tonight?

413
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,679
We can have dinner together.

414
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,680
We can talk about our collaboration.

415
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:40,440
It would be my honor.

416
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:07,319
Mr. Ye.

417
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,879
I can send the documents to your office.

418
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,279
You don't have to come in person.

419
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:14,640
I'm here to inspect the department.

420
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,118
Mr. Ye, there are a lot of projects...

421
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:43,480
that need your signature lately.

422
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,880
As for the schedule,

423
00:22:44,881 --> 00:22:46,519
do you need me to move up...

424
00:22:58,079 --> 00:22:59,079
Mr. Ye.

425
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:01,598
This is the fifth time...

426
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:03,079
you've come to inspect our work today.

427
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:06,279
Your attention...

428
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,039
is motivation for our artists,

429
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,359
but it's also pressure.

430
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:11,920
In order to meet your requirements as soon as possible,

431
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,039
I suggest...

432
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:15,039
giving her more personal space.

433
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:21,319
I told you I didn't want to go this way.

434
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:22,920
Why did you drag me here?

435
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,720
Why do you have Wen Xiao Nuan's phone?

436
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,359
Mr. Ye, have you forgotten?

437
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:54,720
You're the one who made the rule.

438
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,319
Artists' phones are confiscated...

439
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,480
during training.

440
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,880
They can't answer the phone.

441
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,039
Mr. Ye, what is it?

442
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:30,759
Don't our artists...

443
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,119
usually get off work at 8pm?

444
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:33,440
It's already 9pm.

445
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,640
Why hasn't Wen Xiao Nuan left yet?

446
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,558
Wen Xiao Nuan didn't complete...

447
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,759
today's training target.

448
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,960
According to your rules,

449
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:40,599
she has to practice longer.

450
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:11,759
Get in.

451
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:13,759
Mr. Ye is taking Wen Xiao Nuan home.

452
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,559
- Really? - Get in.

453
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,400
It's okay. I can go home by myself.

454
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,480
It's hard to get a cab at this hour.

455
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,000
I didn't say I was getting a cab.

456
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,400
Is someone giving you a ride?

457
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,039
No.

458
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,519
Didn't you all say I'm not in good shape?

459
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,118
I'll rent a bike share to get home.

460
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:43,119
It'll be exercise.

461
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:47,920
Can you even ride a bike...

462
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,240
in high heels?

463
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,559
It's none of your business.

464
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,160
I support you.

465
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,240
Why do you keep following me?

466
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:11,559
I'm just researching...

467
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,640
the effectiveness of the training of our company's S-class artists.

468
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:17,680
Do CEOs have nothing better to do?

469
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:18,920
It's just part of my job.

470
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:08,680
Who is it?

471
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:10,839
Coming.

472
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,559
Why didn't you answer the phone?

473
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,400
Phone?

474
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,078
Mr. Ye, according to your rules,

475
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,239
the company's S-class artists...

476
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,278
cannot answer the phone...

477
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:29,519
during working hours.

478
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,119
You're off work now.

479
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,798
After work,

480
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:37,759
I still have a lot of homework to do.

481
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,400
I don't have time to check my phone.

482
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,960
I'm sorry.

483
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,880
What is it, Mr. Ye?

484
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:04,639
The delivery man made a mistake.

485
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,118
He delivered two hot pot dishes.

486
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,119
Do you want some?

487
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:09,599
Hot pot?

488
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:10,599
Sure.

489
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,960
Wait.

490
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,999
As an S-class artist,

491
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,758
I can only eat what the nutritionist prescribes.

492
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:19,440
So, Mr. Ye, you'll have to eat on your own.

493
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:24,720
You're quite determined.

494
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,920
What? Are you testing me?

495
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,240
What else?

496
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,599
Since you're on a diet,

497
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:39,880
let's go jogging at night.

498
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:41,799
Jogging at night? Sure.

499
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,960
I want to get some fresh air too.

500
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:46,799
Wait.

501
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,400
It's already 10:40pm.

502
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,318
According to your instructions,

503
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:52,159
I have to be in bed by 11pm...

504
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,640
because my dark circles are too serious.

505
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:55,640
So, Mr. Ye, you will have to jog by yourself.

506
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,759
Good luck. Good night.

507
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:13,919
Mr. Ye.

508
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,118
Anning's S-class artists' special training regulations...

509
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:17,319
are still incomplete.

510
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,598
Go ahead.

511
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:21,759
I'll write it down.

512
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,039
Add one more clause.

513
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:25,239
The right to final interpretation...

514
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,720
shall belong to the CEO.

515
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:33,839
Okay.

516
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:39,839
It's 10:54pm. That's perfect.

517
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,160
Let's take a photo and go to sleep.

518
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:53,078
The sleep photo is a fail.

519
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:54,799
Look sweeter. Retake it.

520
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,400
Sweeter?

521
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,039
Failed. Look weirder.

522
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:15,599
Jia Yi.

523
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,160
Jia Yi!

524
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,799
What?

525
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,160
Can you take a picture of me?

526
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,318
Why are you taking pictures at this hour?

527
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:29,758
Xiao Jing told me to send a photo before sleeping every day.

528
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:31,558
I just sent her two, but she said they weren't good.

529
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:33,200
- Take a better picture of me. - Okay.

530
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,279
Come on.

531
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:49,399
- Sleep soon. - Go to bed.

532
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,559
- Good night. - Good night.

533
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,319
This one should do it.

534
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,559
Ask her to send another cute photo.

535
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,200
No good. Look cuter. Retake it.

536
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,720
It's not good enough. I want a cooler one.

537
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,880
Hello?

538
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:49,879
Mr. Ye, you're undermining my professionalism...

539
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,519
as an artist director.

540
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:53,079
I told you.

541
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,119
For Anning's S-class artists' special training regulations,

542
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,839
the final interpretation is up to the CEO.
