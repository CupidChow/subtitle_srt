1
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,280
Han Hui is stopped by the security guard downstairs.

2
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:43,480
Bring her up.

3
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,959
Yes, sir.

4
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,519
I'll give you a satisfactory explanation.

5
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:55,200
Explanation? What explanation?

6
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:56,719
Ridiculous.

7
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:04,319
Look.

8
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,358
- My goodness. - This way, please.

9
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,240
So the news about Mr. Ye and Han Hui is true.

10
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,318
No, why is she here?

11
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,370
Are you stupid? She's marking her territory.

12
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,038
She should've been here long ago.

13
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,239
Now that she's been exposed,

14
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,919
of course she can come openly.

15
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:18,758
We should think of a way...

16
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:20,319
to please the new boss lady.

17
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:22,120
- Hurry up. - Hurry up.

18
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,439
What?

19
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,090
If we're late, we won't get to see her.

20
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:26,879
If we're late, we won't get to see her.

21
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:32,879
Wen Xiao Nuan.

22
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,759
Why care about gossip?

23
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,439
Your goal is to become a good actress.

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,370
Pay off your debt as soon as possible...

25
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,759
and be free.

26
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:53,479
Ms. Han, please.

27
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,439
Linda.

28
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,479
Now you know...

29
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,599
what Ms. Han's relationship with Mr. Ye is.

30
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,280
Fei Mo.

31
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,240
I'm here to return your shirt.

32
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,039
You didn't have to.

33
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,639
You should know that I won't wear this shirt anymore.

34
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:30,719
Don't worry.

35
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,919
I've already dry-cleaned and ironed it.

36
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,159
You're not mad at me, are you?

37
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,159
I didn't know things would turn out this way.

38
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,800
It's not what I wanted either.

39
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,840
I don't want you to feel any pressure.

40
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:55,960
Are you here to apologize?

41
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,000
You still don't trust me.

42
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,599
This kind of publicity is only for rookies.

43
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,479
It's not necessary for me at all.

44
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Look.

45
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,199
In order not to disrupt your plan,

46
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,879
I didn't even post a statement.

47
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:12,840
You just don't want to make a statement too soon.

48
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,439
Whatever you say.

49
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,639
No matter what you decide,

50
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,079
I'll fully cooperate with you.

51
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,050
As long as you need me to,

52
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,519
I can face the media anytime.

53
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:29,920
Just like back then, for you,

54
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,240
I was willing to risk my life.

55
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:38,879
If I didn't fall into the water back then,

56
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:42,199
I wouldn't have given you the chance...

57
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:43,560
to hurt Wen Xiao Nuan today.

58
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:44,920
Fall into the water?

59
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,439
Looks like Cheng An Ya was telling the truth.

60
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,279
So think about the time we first met.

61
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,518
Can you bear to talk to me like this?

62
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,959
Stop talking about the past.

63
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:04,680
I agreed to see you today...

64
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:07,170
to make it clear to you.

65
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,120
Stop having fantasies.

66
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,279
And stop hurting Wen Xiao Nuan.

67
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,560
She's the one I want to be with forever.

68
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,050
You also said it yourself...

69
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,000
that you wanted to be with me forever.

70
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,800
You're the one who gave up.

71
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,759
All right. I've said what I had to say.

72
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,680
You can go.

73
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,559
Why don't we go for a meal?

74
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,920
- Yes, let's go together. - Yes.

75
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:18,839
I know a restaurant...

76
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,159
- Ms. Han Hui. - Ms. Han Hui.

77
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,199
Excuse us.

78
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,680
Okay.

79
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:24,639
So pretty.

80
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:54,079
You have a good foundation.

81
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,480
But the feeling is wrong.

82
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:58,759
It's always...

83
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,759
a little off.

84
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:06,079
Wen Xiao Nuan, do you know what "a little" means?

85
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,800
A little.

86
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:13,279
That means you can never fully reach it.

87
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,439
Ms. Han, you're so nice...

88
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:21,079
to have the time...

89
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:23,079
to give advice to a nobody like me.

90
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,600
Actually,

91
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,920
I've always been puzzled too.

92
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,000
What is it...

93
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:34,279
that's missing?

94
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,920
Maybe it's talent.

95
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,360
Of course,

96
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,600
it could also be luck.

97
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,399
I heard...

98
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:48,279
that you work hard...

99
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,560
both in acting...

100
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:52,480
and relationships.

101
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:56,600
I feel so sorry for you.

102
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,959
What are you trying to say?

103
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:08,040
Reality is cruel.

104
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,519
Because...

105
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,519
whether it's talent...

106
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:14,519
or luck,

107
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:18,560
they can be summed up in one word.

108
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,079
Destiny.

109
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:32,919
Ms. Han.

110
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,240
Can you leave if you're done?

111
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,759
I need to go back to training.

112
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:45,330
Wen Xiao Nuan.

113
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,519
Your destiny is...

114
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:50,240
to live forever...

115
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,559
in my shadow.

116
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:58,480
Good luck.

117
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,000
What happened?

118
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,159
It hurts.

119
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:20,799
It hurts.

120
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:21,919
I'll be done soon.

121
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:26,879
You...

122
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,120
Why did you suddenly want to cook?

123
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:33,639
Because I want to be your bride.

124
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,398
Jiang Fang, how about not eating it?

125
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,440
I'll order takeout for you.

126
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:04,519
It's your first time cooking.

127
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,279
Of course I have...

128
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,399
to support you, right?

129
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:13,720
Look, it's burnt.

130
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,599
But if you cut that part away,

131
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,759
it's still edible.

132
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,759
You're not good with knives,

133
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,120
but you can still practice.

134
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:22,759
Look at these two.

135
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,559
They're well-seasoned.

136
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,559
Really?

137
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,120
I've signed up for cooking classes.

138
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,398
In a few days, you'll get to taste my cooking.

139
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,519
Okay.

140
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:33,840
By the way,

141
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:36,120
I've spent a lot of time picking out my wedding dress.

142
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,240
I really like their fairy-style dress.

143
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:40,240
We can buy one to wear at the reception.

144
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,759
This is beige.

145
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:43,360
I can match it with a pair of crystal shoes.

146
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,759
The shoes are in another photobook.

147
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:47,960
Let's pick the outfit first...

148
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,399
then match them with the shoes.

149
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:50,519
Okay.

150
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,639
And this.

151
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,240
This one.

152
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,879
This design is really nice.

153
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,440
We can wear it for the toast.

154
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,879
One dress won't be enough.

155
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,480
There has to be two or three.

156
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,679
It's better to be prepared.

157
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,600
- Okay. - Yes, and this.

158
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,600
And this.

159
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:09,240
This dress is a great deal.

160
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:11,159
We can make this the sending-off dress.

161
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,159
Let's order them together.

162
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,320
Okay.

163
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,080
I think this dress is nice too.

164
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:21,559
Look.

165
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:23,679
I really like this lace design.

166
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,879
Here.

167
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,519
Have you seen the trending searches?

168
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,679
About Fei Mo and Han Hui?

169
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,279
Don't worry. It's fake.

170
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,000
The person Ye Fei Mo likes is the little nurse.

171
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,080
Wen Xiao Nuan.

172
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,879
Then what happened last night?

173
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:03,279
He was set up.

174
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,279
Why isn't he clarifying it?

175
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,399
He has his reasons.

176
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:10,679
If he really likes Nuan Nuan,

177
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:12,759
I don't think there are any good reasons...

178
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,360
to just let the rumors spread.

179
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:18,399
Does he not even want to explain it to her?

180
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:19,799
He does.

181
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,279
He wants to explain it.

182
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,798
But Wen Xiao Nuan won't give him a chance...

183
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:24,000
and keeps avoiding him.

184
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,360
All right, now.

185
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:29,759
They'll be fine.

186
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:33,758
Didn't you say...

187
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:35,918
you wanted to take photos of the meteor shower?

188
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:37,000
When are we leaving?

189
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,519
Forget it. I don't want to go anymore.

190
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:41,360
I have to be with Nuan Nuan. Bye.

191
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:49,440
Goodness, Ye Fei Mo.

192
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,159
Your scandal has affected my date.

193
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,759
(Ye Fei Mo)

194
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,360
(Ye Fei Mo)

195
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:26,960
(Ye Fei Mo)

196
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:39,799
(Wang Jia Yi)

197
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:46,000
Hey, Jia Yi.

198
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:48,480
Nuan Nuan, I'm near your office.

199
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,120
You're near my office?

200
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,440
Yes, let's have a drink.

201
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:57,200
I don't feel like drinking right now.

202
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,240
What's wrong? Come and accompany me.

203
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,200
Okay, I'll see you later.

204
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,798
(Wen Xiao Nuan)

205
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:19,839
Hello.

206
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,480
The subscriber you have dialed is unavailable.

207
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:23,840
Sorry.

208
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:02,639
Why are you out here?

209
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,039
I've been feeling strange lately.

210
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,399
How so?

211
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,679
Loss of control, emotions affected,

212
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,720
and poor judgment.

213
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,919
Maybe that's what they call love.

214
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,039
All right.

215
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,000
Anyway, my date today has been ruined by you.

216
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:32,120
Let's find a quiet place.

217
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,720
I need to talk to you.

218
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:53,759
Nuan Nuan.

219
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,879
Are you okay?

220
00:16:57,679 --> 00:16:58,720
I'm fine.

221
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,960
I heard from Gu Yun Zhou...

222
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:07,440
that the news about Ye Fei Mo and Han Hui aren't true.

223
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,079
They're true.

224
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,200
I saw them with my own eyes.

225
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,319
I ran into them in the elevator...

226
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,240
that morning.

227
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,410
Han Hui was wearing Ye Fei Mo's shirt.

228
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,960
No way.

229
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:35,650
They spent the night together.

230
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,279
Then Han Hui went to see Ye Fei Mo at the office.

231
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,000
She told me a lot of things out of the blue.

232
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,079
I don't know what she's up to.

233
00:17:58,559 --> 00:17:59,559
Nuan Nuan.

234
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:03,680
Have you really fallen for Ye Fei Mo?

235
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:08,799
How is that possible?

236
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:10,650
How could I possibly like him?

237
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:15,359
He's so fierce.

238
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,680
He kicked me out...

239
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:19,759
the first time we met.

240
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:22,960
He picks his words so carefully.

241
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,839
And he always complains about my cooking.

242
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,960
It's terrible.

243
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:42,890
He's not considerate at all.

244
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,680
He's very petty...

245
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:01,519
and scheming.

246
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,920
Did you make all this?

247
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,759
You fainted due to low blood sugar.

248
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,119
Your body is too weak.

249
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:18,240
Drink it.

250
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,200
Besides...

251
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,559
He likes Han Hui.

252
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:30,440
He signed me to Anning...

253
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,000
just to spite Han Hui.

254
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:40,650
Nuan Nuan.

255
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:44,720
Saying that you don't like him when you do...

256
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:46,680
is lying to yourself.

257
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:55,410
I don't want to talk about this.

258
00:19:58,319 --> 00:19:59,319
Nuan Nuan.

259
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,839
There's a Geminid meteor shower in the next two days.

260
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:03,519
Let's go see it together.

261
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,559
Nuan Nuan.

262
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:13,890
What's wrong?

263
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,239
Gu Yun Zhou and Ye Fei Mo.

264
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,409
- One Americano. - Mocha.

265
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:17,440
Okay, one moment.

266
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:21,680
When did you start drinking mocha?

267
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:23,119
It's so cloying.

268
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,559
I've gotten used to it.

269
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:25,920
Used to it?

270
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:29,079
Haven't you always been used to drinking black coffee?

271
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:32,839
I get it now.

272
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,480
It's Wen Xiao Nuan, right?

273
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:36,200
Cut the crap.

274
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:38,559
Looks like Wen Xiao Nuan...

275
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:40,960
has changed many of your habits.

276
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:43,680
She didn't change anything.

277
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:45,759
You're lying to yourself.

278
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,759
You're the one to talk.

279
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,359
You pretended to be some kind of chauffeur...

280
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,890
to pursue Wang Jia Yi.

281
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,078
Now I know...

282
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:59,200
how much free time the Vice President of Anning has...

283
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,410
that there's time for a side job.

284
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:04,170
I lied about my identity to court Jia Yi...

285
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:06,680
because I wanted her to get to know me first.

286
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:08,319
Besides,

287
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:10,759
I've come clean to her and she has forgiven me.

288
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:12,319
What's wrong with that?

289
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,279
Aren't we talking about you today?

290
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:18,000
Why are we talking about me?

291
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:19,759
Okay.

292
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:21,410
Give me some good advice then.

293
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:24,240
The ones you gave me were from the Internet.

294
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:25,890
So what if I found them online?

295
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:27,358
They still work better than you do.

296
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:28,519
At least I put in effort.

297
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,480
I don't get it.

298
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,079
A virtuous,

299
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:34,319
faithful,

300
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,480
and humorous man like me...

301
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:37,279
would still be despised by women.

302
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:40,559
But they like such an unromantic guy like you.

303
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:42,079
The scandals keep coming.

304
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:45,200
Even Han Hui kissed you first...

305
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:46,839
and forced her way into your house.

306
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:48,480
I really don't get it.

307
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:50,599
Thank you.

308
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,240
Don't talk nonsense.

309
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:54,119
She was drunk that night.

310
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,839
She was drunk, but you weren't.

311
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,319
Why didn't you reject her?

312
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,960
It was a misunderstanding.

313
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,039
- A misunderstanding.
- You're criticizing me?

314
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:02,559
What about you?

315
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,319
You're always searching for those tricks online...

316
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,200
to please girls.

317
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,680
Once you get her, you're no longer interested in her.

318
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,240
I'm really curious.

319
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,720
Do you like the pursuit itself...

320
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:15,119
or the girl?

321
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:19,039
What's the difference?

322
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:22,960
I enjoy the courtship.

323
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:25,839
Let me tell you.

324
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,319
It's not hard to guess...

325
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:28,519
what a girl is thinking.

326
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,799
They're easy to please.

327
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,039
How so?

328
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,839
Take Jia Yi, for example.

329
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:35,960
She likes outdoor photography.

330
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:37,920
So I buy a camera and accompany her everywhere.

331
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,720
She likes to take photos at viral shops.

332
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,920
So I make reservations there.

333
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,559
- That's it. - Jia Yi.

334
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:18,319
I'm okay.

335
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:20,960
That's how you got Wang Jia Yi?

336
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:22,119
That's right.

337
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,240
She likes refined men.

338
00:23:23,241 --> 00:23:24,880
I'll go to the opera with her.

339
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:26,839
She likes penniless men.

340
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I'll play the penniless man.

341
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:30,439
She likes to read.

342
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,599
I'll go to the bookstore with her.

343
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,160
Let me tell you.

344
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:35,519
It's just a few tricks to win a girl's heart.

345
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,559
Give it a try. I'm sure it'll work.

346
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,719
Believe me. I've tried it myself.

347
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,000
There won't be a problem.

348
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:50,359
Jia...

349
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,519
Jia Yi, that's not it. I...

350
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,000
Jia Yi!

351
00:23:58,039 --> 00:23:59,119
Jia Yi!

352
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,319
It's their problem. Let them handle it.

353
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,960
Why didn't you answer my calls...

354
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:07,440
or reply to my messages?

355
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,240
I was training.

356
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:12,519
I can't use the phone.

357
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,960
Your eyes are wandering. You're lying.

358
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:19,039
Didn't you make that rule?

359
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:20,758
Artists can't pick up the phone...

360
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,079
when they're training.

361
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,118
(Actress Han Hui and CEO of Anning Culture, Ye Fei Mo...)

362
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:29,240
(were caught kissing.)

363
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:35,359
You're so popular, Mr. Ye.

364
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:37,799
Do you care?

365
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,039
No.

366
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,199
You look good in the photo.

367
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,240
It's so romantic.

368
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,480
Are you angry?

369
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,078
Me? Angry?

370
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:49,200
Why would I be angry? What's there to be angry about?

371
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,079
If you admit that you're angry,

372
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,680
then I'll tell you the truth.

373
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
There's no need.

374
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,680
I'm just an artist of Anning.

375
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,200
Your matters are not my business.

376
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,799
We used to get along very naturally.

377
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,039
If you had any thoughts,

378
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:12,640
you'd tell me directly.

379
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:16,000
Why aren't you being honest now?

380
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,199
Because I don't want to be a fool anymore...

381
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,440
and be used as a tool.

382
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:25,278
I used to think...

383
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,440
that I got into Anning and became an S-class artist,

384
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:30,079
became the female lead of "Blue Galaxy",

385
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,999
and got invited to dinner by Ms. Cheng...

386
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,480
were all because I was lucky.

387
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,640
But I realized today...

388
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,240
that all my luck...

389
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,599
was just your goal.

390
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,920
Wen Xiao Nuan.

391
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,400
She cares about me.

392
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,240
She cares about me.

393
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,000
Jia Yi.

394
00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:55,559
What do you want?

395
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,118
Jia Yi, let me explain.

396
00:25:58,119 --> 00:25:59,358
What I said just now...

397
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:01,079
was just to make Fei Mo take the initiative.

398
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,400
So in your heart,

399
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:05,960
you ate with me, went shopping, and took photos...

400
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,479
just to please me.

401
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,599
No, I...

402
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:12,680
I'm used to talking nonsense.

403
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:14,960
It's not what you think, Jia Yi.

404
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,640
You're exactly like those rich guys.

405
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,759
You're just doing this on a whim...

406
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,680
to satisfy your desire to conquer.

407
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:33,680
Is that what you really think?

408
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,279
You think I'm just like them?

409
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:38,119
We've known each other for so long.

410
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,680
Don't you know what kind of person I am?

411
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:45,920
I don't know which one is the real you.

412
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,959
I don't even know...

413
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,920
which one of your words is true...

414
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,000
and which is a lie.

415
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,680
So...

416
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,039
you put me into the same category as them?

417
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:00,240
I'm not as smart as you.

418
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:03,999
I can't simply switch...

419
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,160
between so many characters.

420
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,759
I just want to live a simple life.

421
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,839
So I'm disturbing you by showing up.

422
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:21,559
We're from two different worlds.

423
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,359
So you don't see me as a friend at all.

424
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,359
You don't want to get to know me at all.

425
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:38,799
Okay.

426
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,000
I get it.

427
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I get it now.

428
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:42,839
When I look at the clouds, I don't...

429
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,400
Coming.

430
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:53,720
Mr. Ye, what's the matter?

431
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,119
Why didn't you wait for me to get off work?

432
00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:57,319
You didn't tell me to.

433
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:01,759
Sorry, my phone ran out of battery.

434
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,000
As an S-class artist of Anning,

435
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,440
you have to reply to every message.

436
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,480
My manager is Xiao Jing.

437
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,278
If you have any instructions,

438
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:11,640
please go to my manager first.

439
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,559
My stomach hurts.

440
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:18,799
My stomach hurts.

441
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:22,919
According to Anning's artist contract,

442
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,879
it doesn't say that I'm responsible for Mr. Ye's health.

443
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,880
So you'd better go to the hospital.

444
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:28,319
Can you take me there?

445
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,598
I'm sorry. I'm busy today.

446
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:31,759
I have to memorize my lines.

447
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,559
- I'll help you. - No need.

448
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:36,599
Mr. Ye, you're still in your honeymoon phase.

449
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,919
It's not convenient for you to come to my house.

450
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,318
I don't want your girlfriend to get the wrong idea.

451
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,720
So please leave.

452
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:02,400
I don't see you.

453
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,999
(Relationship Counselling Tree Hole)

454
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,039
(Posts)

455
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:24,919
She obviously cares about me.

456
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,000
Why won't she admit it?

457
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:27,999
You're reading her wrong.

458
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,720
Maybe she's just playing hard to get.

459
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,799
Maybe she's just casting a wide net.

460
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,079
You're just a small fish in her pond.

461
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,799
A small fish in her pond?

462
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,519
No need to think. You're just a backup plan.

463
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,759
Next question.

464
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,920
Girls are shy.

465
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,839
They probably met a fish pond owner.

466
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:45,799
They care, but they won't admit it.

467
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:47,079
Are they a kid?

468
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,759
Having a cold war with my girlfriend. How do I comfort her?

469
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,400
I'll be waiting online. It's urgent.

470
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,680
A cold war with your girlfriend? That's easy.

471
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:37,839
Take her shopping.

472
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:39,759
Women can't resist shopping.

473
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:45,200
I've used that trick before.

474
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,318
The poster must be poor.

475
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:51,920
How much have you spent on your girlfriend?

476
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,839
Buy clothes, jewelry, and bags.

477
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:56,839
I'm not poor.

478
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,359
Create some romance.

479
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:01,440
Like holding roses on a rainy day,

480
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:02,640
standing in the rain and apologizing.

481
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,000
Women can't resist roses and sentimental things.

482
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,279
Standing in the rain with roses and apologizing on a rainy day...

483
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:11,519
will get me sick.

484
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:12,680
I'll torture myself.

485
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:15,079
Cook for your girlfriend.

486
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:16,839
Prepare a candlelight dinner.

487
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,559
I don't know how to cook.

488
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:21,240
She prepares all the meals.

489
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,279
Take her on a vacation.

490
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,239
A romantic trip to the Maldives.

491
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,440
I'm sure she'll be fine.

492
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,279
I'm busy. I have work.

493
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:35,640
I have meetings.

494
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,959
What kind of man is the poster?

495
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,279
He has a girlfriend, but I'm single.

496
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:44,199
Poster, just be single.

497
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,559
Don't hurt your girlfriend.

498
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,199
Poster, learn your lesson.

499
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,240
You deserve to be criticized.
