1
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:41,479
The door is right there.

2
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,480
Leave right now!

3
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,480
I'm not leaving!

4
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,480
I'm not leaving!

5
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
What's wrong with you?

6
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,519
I only threw half an apple core at you.

7
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,519
Are you trying to scam me?

8
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,079
Are you all right?

9
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,919
What's wrong, Ye Fei Mo?

10
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,120
Don't scare me.

11
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,000
I'll call Xiao Jing now.

12
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:12,479
Don't.

13
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:13,960
Don't call Zhou Xiao Jing.

14
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,999
Call the doctor.

15
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,158
Doctor? What's the doctor's number?

16
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:19,159
I don't know it.

17
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:25,530
Give me a moment.

18
00:02:25,531 --> 00:02:26,560
(Doctor Lu)

19
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,439
(Phone number)

20
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:34,039
It's okay. I'm here.

21
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,639
It's okay.

22
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,199
Hang in there.

23
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,199
Doctor.

24
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:43,198
I don't know what's wrong with Ye Fei Mo.

25
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:45,560
He suddenly fell ill and collapsed.

26
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,400
Mr. Ye...

27
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,759
What did Mr. Ye eat?

28
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,240
Why does he have so much indigestion?

29
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,638
Serious indigestion...

30
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:19,719
caused an acute gastrointestinal attack.

31
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,439
He has a weak stomach.

32
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,439
Not only can he not starve,

33
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,199
he can't overeat either.

34
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:27,039
Overeat?

35
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,080
He didn't eat much.

36
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,639
That's strange.

37
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,318
All right, take good care of him.

38
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:34,359
We'll get going.

39
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,400
- Okay. - All right?

40
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,560
Let's go.

41
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,280
The ill Ye Fei Mo is such a good boy.

42
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:08,719
He's not so annoying anymore.

43
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,759
Your mental defenses are about to collapse.

44
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,050
It's a bit dangerous.

45
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,560
Water.

46
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:26,319
Water.

47
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,000
It's a bit cold now.

48
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,000
Wait for me. I'll get you some hot water.

49
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:56,730
Where's my food?

50
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:57,730
I tossed it.

51
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,839
It tastes so bad.

52
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:00,079
Why keep it?

53
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,639
So he didn't throw out my food.

54
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,319
He ate it all.

55
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,599
Acute gastroenteritis...

56
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,639
can easily lead to dehydration.

57
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:43,560
But he can't drink too much at once.

58
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:46,040
Otherwise, his diarrhea will worsen.

59
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,959
So you have to control...

60
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,360
the amount of water he drinks.

61
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,720
Slowly.

62
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:58,040
Secondly, you have to monitor his temperature.

63
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,679
Once inflammation occurs,

64
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,720
there will be a fever.

65
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:04,240
If his temperature exceeds 38.5℃,

66
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,879
then he needs an injection to reduce his fever.

67
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:27,319
Is it bitter?

68
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,439
Hang in there.

69
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,560
Slowly.

70
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,600
You're awake. How are you feeling?

71
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:42,079
Much better.

72
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,439
Did you pinch me?

73
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:48,959
I...

74
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:51,759
No, the doctor told me to do this.

75
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,439
Pressing this acupuncture point can relieve pain.

76
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,879
Look if you don't believe me.

77
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,079
I wrote down what the doctor said.

78
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:04,839
You can't move yet.

79
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,040
What do you want? Your phone or water?

80
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,879
I'm going to the bathroom.

81
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,240
Which one do you prefer?

82
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,120
You're good at taking care of people.

83
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,079
I'm all right.

84
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:22,439
Look. Is this okay?

85
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:24,519
Help me to the bathroom!

86
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:33,559
Mr. Ye, hurry up.

87
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,450
Mr. Ye, how are you doing?

88
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:39,360
Mr. Ye, hurry up.

89
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,159
I really can't hold it anymore.

90
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,639
Mr. Ye?

91
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,450
Are you okay?

92
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,918
Ye Fei Mo, if you don't make a sound,

93
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:51,960
I'll come in.

94
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:01,360
Can't you let me go to the toilet in peace?

95
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:03,039
Do you know how noisy you are?

96
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:04,840
I'm just...

97
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,159
Let's go back.

98
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,518
Jiang Fang.

99
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,519
Ling Er.

100
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,559
Your ex-girlfriend is quite capable.

101
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,918
Anning and Aurora are rivals and
have never been on good terms.

102
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:27,480
But neither of them dares to go head-to-head.

103
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,600
Just because I slapped her a few times in the scene,

104
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:31,399
Ye Fei Mo wants to replace me.

105
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,330
Did you hit Nuan Nuan?

106
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:34,879
Nuan Nuan?

107
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,840
You're still calling her so affectionately.

108
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,678
No, that's not what I meant.

109
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:39,679
What's wrong with hitting her?

110
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:41,519
I was just acting out what the script says.

111
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:42,879
Do you even feel sorry for her?

112
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,759
Are you still thinking about Wen Xiao Nuan?

113
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,799
Ling Er, listen to me. I...

114
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,360
She's really something.

115
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,450
She's flirting with you and Ye Fei Mo at the same time.

116
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:54,120
I couldn't figure it out after investigating for a long time.

117
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:57,039
Then I found out that she's staying at Ye Fei Mo's house.

118
00:09:57,879 --> 00:09:59,879
She sounded like she had a backbone.

119
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,918
But she just quietly seduced...

120
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:03,360
Anning's CEO.

121
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:05,159
A woman like her...

122
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:07,240
might have gotten with Ye Fei Mo...

123
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,158
before you two broke up.

124
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:10,159
Are you done?

125
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:11,330
Am I wrong?

126
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:18,039
Ling Er, listen to me.

127
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,159
I...

128
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:21,840
Wen Xiao Nuan and I are in the past.

129
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,360
I only care about you now.

130
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,919
How she is doing...

131
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,519
is none of my business.

132
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,639
Enough. Aren't we going on a date?

133
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:32,000
Didn't you want to eat...

134
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:33,399
at that popular restaurant?

135
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,559
Let's go.

136
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,840
Let's go.

137
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:42,089
Mr. Ye, you're still sick.

138
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,720
Why don't you lie down first?

139
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:45,799
I'm fine.

140
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:47,639
I can't stand lying down for too long.

141
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:51,240
What do you want to watch? I'll play it for you.

142
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:54,480
Choose a few movies with historical mystical elements.

143
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,759
Play it for me.

144
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,240
I'm going to be making a movie...

145
00:10:57,679 --> 00:10:59,120
about the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl.

146
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,320
I want some reference material.

147
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,679
The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl?

148
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,720
It's a classic segment in Huangmei opera.

149
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,759
If you're making something traditional,

150
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:10,240
you need to draw inspiration from traditional opera.

151
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,799
But I'm making a commercial movie.

152
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:14,440
There are rules in business.

153
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,039
The main consumer is young people.

154
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:17,799
So the things I make...

155
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,960
must be in line with the aesthetics of today's youth.

156
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,000
Traditional things are outdated.

157
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:23,798
How is it outdated?

158
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:25,159
I can show it to you now.

159
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:26,719
But I don't have that video at home.

160
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,159
You can find it online.

161
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:36,480
("The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl")

162
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:37,559
Seriously?

163
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:45,399
Aren't you touched?

164
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,919
I'm more interested in the cinematography...

165
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,320
and the camera language.

166
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:56,799
The story itself is the most touching.

167
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:59,519
The filming technique is secondary.

168
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,039
But there's a method to everything.

169
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,480
You can't empathize too much.

170
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,799
It's the same with movies and people.

171
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,200
I don't agree.

172
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,919
Why are you always so cold?

173
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:19,039
Haven't you ever felt anything?

174
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,840
I have something...

175
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:50,960
to return to you.

176
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,000
Did you like the food?

177
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,559
It's not bad.

178
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,039
Drive slowly.

179
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,799
She's really something.

180
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,799
She's flirting with you while seducing Ye Fei Mo.

181
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,120
Then I found out that she's staying at Ye Fei Mo's house.

182
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:21,080
Now Ye Fei Mo has a 24-hour companion.

183
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,960
I saw them hugging just now.

184
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:28,279
No, I have to see it for myself.

185
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,320
Why do you have this?

186
00:14:57,879 --> 00:14:59,240
I found it at a restaurant.

187
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,840
It was in Room 5203.

188
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,120
So was the ad you posted...

189
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,279
to find me?

190
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:17,600
But I got the wrong person.

191
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,559
You're not the one I'm looking for.

192
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:22,200
So...

193
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,279
I'm returning it to its owner.

194
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:34,440
All right.

195
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:35,600
I've returned it to you.

196
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,879
This should put an end to this.

197
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,840
I'm hungry. Go and cook.

198
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:45,959
There's no food in the fridge.

199
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,960
Go buy some.

200
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:04,960
I didn't give away this brooch.

201
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,759
Why am I holding on to it?

202
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,159
Jiang Fang?

203
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,879
Are you really staying at Ye Fei Mo's house?

204
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,240
Given your current position,

205
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:41,440
you have no right to tell me what to do.

206
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,758
Even if we've broken up,

207
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,559
you don't have to degrade yourself like this.

208
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:47,840
Degrade myself?

209
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,398
That's right. Do you know that you've betrayed yourself?

210
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,558
For that lousy theater,

211
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:53,080
have you thrown away your pride?

212
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,399
In order to become Aurora's director,

213
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,559
you gave up on our relationship of many years.

214
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,799
You have no right to criticize me.

215
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,359
You've always been the most important person to me.

216
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,239
I told you to give me time.

217
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,679
I asked you to wait for me. And then what?

218
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,519
You turned around and sold yourself to Ye Fei Mo.

219
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:14,039
Do you know how upset I am that you did that?

220
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:18,959
Nuan Nuan, don't leave me.

221
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,000
- Let go of me! - Nuan Nuan.

222
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,279
Let go of me, Jiang Fang!

223
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,359
What are you doing?

224
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,759
What are you doing, Jiang Fang?

225
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,960
It was my fault all these years.

226
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,920
I didn't get to know you properly.

227
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,359
I bought this for you as a gift for getting a new job.

228
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,279
I'm giving it to you now.

229
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,000
It represents the love I once had for you.

230
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,039
Take it.

231
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,170
From now on,

232
00:17:48,171 --> 00:17:49,650
we have nothing to do with each other.

233
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:54,119
Hello, miss.

234
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:55,959
This is the Adolph ginseng shampoo.

235
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,119
It's our best-selling product.

236
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:59,119
Not only does it strengthen your hair,

237
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,720
but it also smells really good.

238
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,038
After using it,

239
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:03,409
it's said that your attractiveness will increase.

240
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,798
Attractiveness will increase?

241
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:05,799
Yes.

242
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:11,758
Then give me one bottle of each.

243
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:12,799
Okay.

244
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:15,890
I think Ye Fei Mo uses this.

245
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:20,599
Here.

246
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,720
Thank you.

247
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:44,720
She's weird. What is she holding?

248
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,839
That's right. Let's go.

249
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:07,599
Young lady.

250
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:10,119
Are you buying a tumbler?

251
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:14,079
What's the matter?

252
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:18,279
Your voice sounds familiar.

253
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,720
Really?

254
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:23,119
You seem a bit unsure.

255
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:26,170
Yes, I want to buy a tumbler for a friend.

256
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:28,890
But I think a tumbler in his hand...

257
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:30,519
doesn't match his style.

258
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,039
A friend?

259
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:34,039
Is he your boyfriend?

260
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:35,719
No, he's not my boyfriend.

261
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,079
Tumblers have nothing to do with style.

262
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,650
But I'm afraid he won't use it.

263
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:42,798
If he won't use it,

264
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,119
why are you buying it for him?

265
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:45,679
He has a weak stomach.

266
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,170
I want him to drink more hot water.

267
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:51,599
You're quite thoughtful.

268
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:53,359
Not at all.

269
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:54,680
I'll buy it, then.

270
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,519
Buy it and force him to use it.

271
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:06,039
An Ya, thank you for giving me a ride home.

272
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,239
You have so much stuff.

273
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,410
How are you going to carry it all?

274
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:13,839
Why don't you ask your friend to come out to get you?

275
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,680
I can carry it myself.

276
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,920
My friend is spoiled.

277
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:20,039
I can't order him around.

278
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,440
Why are you out here?

279
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,000
I'm getting some fresh air.

280
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:33,440
Go back inside.

281
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:35,200
I can't carry you if you faint again.

282
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,119
You don't have to worry about me.

283
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:39,799
Do you think others are as cold-hearted as you?

284
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:41,960
I'm very kind-hearted.

285
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:43,319
I won't abandon you.

286
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:45,799
I think you're the reason I'm sick.

287
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,960
Ye Fei Mo, you...

288
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:48,410
I'm just stating the facts.

289
00:21:57,319 --> 00:21:58,319
Fei Mo.

290
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,919
I heard you were sick.

291
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,960
I came to see you.

292
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:03,759
You seem to be in good condition.

293
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,799
I don't need to worry.

294
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:08,759
The person you sent held out until now.

295
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,160
You should be satisfied.

296
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:12,599
Mom.

297
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:15,799
My judgment is never wrong.

298
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,440
Xiao Nuan.

299
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,519
An Ya... No.

300
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:51,880
Mom... No.

301
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,680
It's okay.

302
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:57,200
Call me whatever you want. Don't be nervous.

303
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:01,880
Ms. Cheng, I'm sorry.

304
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:04,358
I answered your call before...

305
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:06,000
and was so rude.

306
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:07,599
It's okay.

307
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:09,759
I agree with everything you said.

308
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,119
Great minds think alike.

309
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
It's true.

310
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:17,680
You are such an adorable child.

311
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,960
Let me tell you.

312
00:23:18,961 --> 00:23:20,038
Fei Mo...

313
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:21,920
has always been very solitary.

314
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:23,358
His dad and I...

315
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:24,359
are very busy with work.

316
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,079
That's why we don't spend much time with him.

317
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:30,279
But you've only been here for a few days.

318
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:32,559
He already seems different from before.

319
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,599
He seems much more cheerful.

320
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,480
I don't think so.

321
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,480
He is.

322
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,519
Thank you, really.

323
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,440
What are you talking about?

324
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,279
We were badmouthing you.

325
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,680
Right?

326
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,759
All right. That's all.

327
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,039
I just came to see you.

328
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,558
If you're still alive,

329
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:54,960
come back to work as soon as possible.

330
00:23:57,359 --> 00:23:58,680
This brat needs to be taught a lesson.

331
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,960
Don't spoil him too much.

332
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:01,279
I'll leave him to you.

333
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,720
I'm leaving.

334
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:31,480
How dare she pester Jiang Fang?

335
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:35,519
Wen Xiao Nuan.

336
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:37,599
Just you wait.

337
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,480
Do you understand?

338
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:02,920
Mr. Ye, it's time for your medicine.

339
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,160
It's time for your medicine.

340
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:15,799
It's time for your medicine.

341
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:18,759
Leave it.

342
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:23,160
I'm confiscating this. Take medicine before you work.

343
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,519
What are you doing?

344
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:31,960
This was the last packet of medicine!

345
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,279
(Order details, Wait time)

346
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,719
(I went to buy medicine.
I'll be right back!)

347
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:52,240
(Nepstar Drugstore)

348
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,720
Luckily, there's a pharmacy.

349
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,960
Otherwise, Ye Fei Mo would scold me again.

350
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,920
He's so mean.

351
00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:07,880
I wonder how Ye Fei Mo is doing now.

352
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:28,640
It's so late, and she's still not back.

353
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,000
Did something happen?

354
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:01,039
(Wen Xiao Nuan)

355
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:10,640
Ye Fei Mo, why aren't you picking up?

356
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:15,200
Ye Fei Mo, come and save me.

357
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:16,598
I'm on the path in front of the villa.

358
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:17,799
I'm being followed.
