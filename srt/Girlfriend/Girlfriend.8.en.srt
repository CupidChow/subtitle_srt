1
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:39,799
Han Hui is coming out.

2
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,079
Han Hui!

3
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,280
Do you like Han Hui?

4
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,599
Of course.

5
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,840
She's been making a name for
herself in Hollywood alone for years.

6
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,680
Her results speak for themselves.

7
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:13,919
She's my idol!

8
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:19,840
- Ms. Han Hui.
- Ms. Han Hui.

9
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,759
Ms. Han Hui.

10
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:23,919
Ms. Han Hui.

11
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:27,879
She's so pretty.

12
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,680
Yes, she is.

13
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,318
- She's pretty. - Nuan Nuan.

14
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,399
- Nuan Nuan. - She's so elegant.

15
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,530
- This way. - She's so pretty.

16
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:38,960
Jia Yi?

17
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,090
What are you doing here?

18
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,918
Do you remember the mission...

19
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:42,960
I told you about?

20
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,239
I have to accompany Ye Fei Mo...

21
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,438
to tonight's banquet.

22
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:46,918
I'll get paid if I complete the mission.

23
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:48,479
I can go home after tonight.

24
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,560
That's great.

25
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:50,960
I'll finally have someone to keep me company.

26
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,319
Ms. Han Hui.

27
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:00,639
Ms. Han, this is our company's new project.

28
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,679
This female lead role is perfect for you. Take a look.

29
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,799
Ms. Han, this is a global collaboration project.

30
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,840
It's perfect for you.

31
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,080
She's so pretty.

32
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,080
Everyone, thank you...

33
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:09,639
for your love and support for Ms. Han Hui.

34
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,878
But our time is limited.

35
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,039
Please introduce the project in one sentence.

36
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,280
If Ms. Han Hui is interested, we can talk in depth.

37
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,159
If not, let's not waste each other's time.

38
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,399
Okay, I'll go first.

39
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,038
A princess of a fallen country has been dormant for years...

40
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,360
and successfully restores her country.

41
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:22,800
A female spy infiltrates and takes down the mastermind.

42
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,360
The love story of a female doctor in a war zone.

43
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,000
- Ms. Han Hui. - Ms. Han Hui.

44
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,598
- Han... - Thank you for your support.

45
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,599
Ms. Han Hui...

46
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,319
doesn't like these projects.

47
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,919
Let's work together another time.

48
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,840
Well...

49
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:41,840
I want to become an actress like Han Hui.

50
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:44,080
I'm sure you will.

51
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,159
It's okay. Let's talk next time.

52
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,319
It's okay.

53
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,360
It's all right.

54
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,438
Wang Jia Yi.

55
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,758
What are you doing here? Come with me.

56
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:55,839
You should get back to work.

57
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,879
Let's talk at home.

58
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,560
Han Hui.

59
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,718
I'm Bai Xiu Wen.

60
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:01,759
I'm your fan.

61
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,479
- I'll be right back. - Okay.

62
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,039
What do you want to do?

63
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:15,718
It's not easy for me to meet my idol.

64
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:17,079
I have a chance to talk to her. I...

65
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,680
You're my dance partner today.

66
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,399
Don't forget your mission.

67
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,519
Hurry up.

68
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,240
Mr. Xu.

69
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,560
Sorry, I had trouble finding her.

70
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,838
Simon,

71
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,120
is she your new artist?

72
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:34,959
Yes.

73
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,240
Let me introduce you.

74
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:38,559
This is our artist, Jia Yi.

75
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,610
This is Mr. Xu.

76
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:40,999
Mr. Xu's family is rich.

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,050
His dad is very powerful.

78
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:45,879
Hello.

79
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,279
Say hello.

80
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:49,360
Hello, Mr. Xu.

81
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:00,279
I'm sorry.

82
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,920
I'm not interested in rich people.

83
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,240
Wait, you...

84
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,438
Mr. Xu, I'm sorry.

85
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:09,319
Our artist doesn't know better.

86
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:11,360
You don't know better either.

87
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,319
I'll bring her back.

88
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,399
She's such a pain in my side.

89
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Ms. Han Hui.

90
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:24,319
May I have a word with you?

91
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,799
It's okay. I'll leave you to it.

92
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,120
I'll talk to you another time.

93
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,720
Well, Ms. Han Hui,

94
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:38,279
our company has a new project.

95
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,720
Sir.

96
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,199
Please send the project to our work email.

97
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:44,399
We'll contact you if we're interested.

98
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,519
Let me explain.

99
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:59,279
That was my fault.

100
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,759
I won't let such people get close to you again.

101
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,199
Mr. Ye.

102
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,959
Mr. Ye.

103
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:08,879
You're willing to bring a date today.

104
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:12,079
This lady looks unfamiliar.

105
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,439
Is she new at Anning?

106
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:15,519
Who is she?

107
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,079
Her name is Wen Xiao Nuan.

108
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,199
She's new.

109
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,839
She's just an extra.

110
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,759
Mr. Ye,

111
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,319
how about we do this today?

112
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:25,999
Let's switch partners today.

113
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
What do you think?

114
00:06:27,001 --> 00:06:29,160
Let Wen Xiao Nuan be my partner.

115
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,758
Take your pick...

116
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:32,759
from my pretty girls.

117
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,480
Come on.

118
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,878
Mr. Ye. Mr. Ye, let go.

119
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:37,639
You can't joke about this.

120
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,439
I think Mr. Dong is drunk.

121
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:40,959
Help him sober up.

122
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,160
Mr. Ye, don't.

123
00:06:42,161 --> 00:06:43,398
Mr. Ye, I'm not drunk.

124
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,399
Then you did it on purpose.

125
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,559
Mr. Ye, don't be mad.

126
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,560
Calm down.

127
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,000
Ms. Ye, let go.

128
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,000
Let go of me!

129
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,959
- Don't. - How dare you touch my fiancée?

130
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,919
You want to retire early, don't you?

131
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,639
- Fiancée? - Fiancée?

132
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:59,800
Ye Fei Mo's fiancée?

133
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,839
- Fiancée? - Fiancée?

134
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,639
- Are you all right? - I'm fine.

135
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,839
Do you want to say hi?

136
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:14,720
The speech is about to start.

137
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,240
Later.

138
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,240
Did you see Han Hui's face?

139
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,800
She hurt Fei Mo so badly back then.

140
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,680
I bet she didn't know this day would come.

141
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:29,919
Rose's Tear...

142
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,920
can only be worn by the mistress of Anning Culture.

143
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:34,000
Now it is around Wen Xiao Nuan's neck.

144
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:36,240
It's impossible for Han Hui to look happy.

145
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:37,919
But Wen Xiao Nuan...

146
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,720
looks a lot like the Han Hui back then.

147
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,879
Do you think he did this...

148
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,759
to provoke Han Hui?

149
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,838
Or does he really like...

150
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,879
this little nurse?

151
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,560
Why are you so nosy now?

152
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,600
Why are you more anxious than he is?

153
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,680
I'm not the anxious one.

154
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,638
The speech is about to start.

155
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:04,679
Let's go and take a look.

156
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,800
Let's go and see.

157
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,120
Let's watch.

158
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,560
Folks,

159
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,639
the one standing next to me...

160
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,160
is Ms. Han Hui.

161
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:20,319
I suppose Ms. Han Hui...

162
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,279
doesn't need any introduction.

163
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:23,759
This time,

164
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,439
Ms. Han Hui accepted my invitation...

165
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,240
and returned to our homeland...

166
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,839
and our entertainment circle.

167
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:32,519
That's why...

168
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,239
I would like to propose...

169
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,799
a toast to Ms. Han Hui.

170
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,120
Let's welcome her home.

171
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,240
- Welcome home, Ms. Han.
- Welcome home, Ms. Han.

172
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,840
This time...

173
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,360
What's wrong with you?

174
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,090
It's an honor for our entertainment circle.

175
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,839
What are you doing?

176
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,918
You just said I'm your fiancée.

177
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:03,039
I haven't even gotten on your case about that yet.

178
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,519
- Let go. - It'll be over soon.

179
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,480
The commission is right in front of you.

180
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,120
Are you giving up?

181
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:10,879
That's strange.

182
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,879
What's wrong with Ye Fei Mo today?

183
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:14,959
Of course, all the producers...

184
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,479
and collaborators...

185
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,480
working with Aurora...

186
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,600
are in the audience.

187
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:21,158
So you can discuss among yourselves.

188
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:22,159
If you have any projects,

189
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,558
you can share your resources...

190
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:24,559
and network amongst yourselves.

191
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,759
Lastly, I hope everyone...

192
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:28,399
will have a good time.

193
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,840
- Cheers. - Cheers.

194
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:48,799
About the project you mentioned before,

195
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,330
I think if we launch it this year,

196
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:51,679
we might run into some problems.

197
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,090
Why don't we put it on hold...

198
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,120
and see what other resources,

199
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,879
better scripts, and teams that we have...

200
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,360
can be integrated.

201
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:00,480
Let's see...

202
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,600
how we can continue working together.

203
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:04,120
What do you think?

204
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,399
Okay.

205
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:06,799
Okay.

206
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:08,960
I'll also have a meeting back at the office.

207
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,120
You can see if you have any other ideas.

208
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:14,000
Didn't you have a project...

209
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:15,639
about passersby?

210
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,399
I think it's quite interesting.

211
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,879
Thank you.

212
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:24,679
If you have any good suggestions,

213
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:25,919
please let us know.

214
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,210
I think...

215
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:28,960
we should combine this project with the previous one.

216
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:58,039
So beautiful.

217
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:05,080
Thank you, Ms. Han.

218
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,360
Ms. Han, I'm your fan.

219
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,600
I have a favor to ask.

220
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,440
There's a theater troupe in my hometown.

221
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:13,360
Can you record a promotional video...

222
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,799
for my hometown theater troupe?

223
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,959
But if it's inconvenient for you,

224
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,960
it's okay.

225
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:19,559
No problem.

226
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,240
Fei Mo and I are good friends.

227
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:23,639
I'll definitely help you...

228
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,200
with this favor.

229
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,240
You're friends? Thank you, Ms. Han.

230
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,159
We've known each other for a long time.

231
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,039
We used to be very close.

232
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:36,119
Then I went abroad to develop my career,

233
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,360
and we lost touch.

234
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,639
You're his fiancée.

235
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,960
Didn't he tell you about me?

236
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:44,000
- I'm not. - I wanted to introduce you two.

237
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,120
But you two are already chatting.

238
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,679
Fei Mo.

239
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,679
This is my fiancée,

240
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:52,720
Wen Xiao Nuan.

241
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,919
I...

242
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,840
I love her very much.

243
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,879
My mom...

244
00:11:58,159 --> 00:11:59,240
likes her too.

245
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,759
Right?

246
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,519
Ms. Han,

247
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,159
if you're willing,

248
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,440
make sure to come to our wedding.

249
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,879
I'm busy.

250
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,919
Talk to you later.

251
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,879
Ms. Han, I...

252
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,080
What are you doing?

253
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,639
Let go.

254
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,360
Ye Fei Mo.

255
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,199
What are you talking about? Who's your fiancée?

256
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,240
What?

257
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:29,039
Are you eager to get rid of me,

258
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,080
complete your mission,

259
00:12:30,081 --> 00:12:31,320
and get back to Jiang Fang?

260
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:33,320
What are you talking about?

261
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,679
Accompanying me to this banquet...

262
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:36,960
and obeying my orders...

263
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,200
is your mission.

264
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:40,960
Don't tell me you're going to give up...

265
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,320
right at the end, right?

266
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:43,519
Fine.

267
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,799
After I finish today's mission,

268
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,918
you'll go your way,

269
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:46,919
and I'll go my way.

270
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,039
Let's just ignore each other.

271
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,159
You provoked me first.

272
00:12:58,799 --> 00:12:59,879
It's not up to you.

273
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:02,159
For the next movie,

274
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,959
I've decided to upgrade...

275
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,000
the cast and line-up.

276
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:13,039
Move.

277
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:16,759
Mr. Jiang?

278
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,840
Come on. Cheers.

279
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:29,359
I think...

280
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,080
the movie industry will get better.

281
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,840
- Yes. - Yes.

282
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,039
She looks so much like me.

283
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,960
And she's wearing my dress.

284
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,039
Fei Mo,

285
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,519
you hired a stand-in to humiliate me, didn't you?

286
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,200
Give me a glass of water.

287
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:12,799
Fei Mo.

288
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,200
I want to talk to you.

289
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,799
I don't think that's a good idea, Ms. Han.

290
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:23,039
If a scandal breaks out,

291
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,558
it won't be good...

292
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:25,639
for your return to China.

293
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,679
How have you been...

294
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,200
all these years?

295
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:56,759
Quite well.

296
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,360
Back then,

297
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:04,720
I had no choice.

298
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:09,639
You cheated.

299
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,159
You went abroad.

300
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:12,879
Which one did you have no choice in?

301
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,360
Everything that happened back then...

302
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:20,240
was manipulated by your mom.

303
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,600
I didn't cheat on you.

304
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:24,559
That's enough.

305
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:27,639
What I said...

306
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:29,559
was the truth.

307
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,519
Then why did my mom do that?

308
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:34,679
Back then, why didn't you...

309
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,080
say anything?

310
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:38,080
I don't know why she did that.

311
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,159
I didn't say anything...

312
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,079
because I didn't want...

313
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,840
to cause a rift between you and your mom.

314
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,559
I think she did that...

315
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,120
because I was not good enough.

316
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,439
That's why she treated me that way.

317
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,840
That's why I worked so hard.

318
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,799
I thought she would accept me if I did that.

319
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:58,279
My mom isn't like that.

320
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:00,799
But Ms. Han,

321
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,799
after going to Hollywood,

322
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,559
your acting...

323
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:06,240
has really improved.

324
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:12,879
Fei Mo.

325
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,399
Now that I'm back,

326
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,159
can you stop using a stand-in to make me angry?

327
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,720
Don't flatter yourself.

328
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:27,279
You're lying to yourself.

329
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,759
The girl you found...

330
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:32,360
looks so much like I did back then.

331
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,360
She's even wearing the dress I reserved.

332
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,120
If she's not a stand-in, what is she?

333
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,879
Don't be so cold to me, all right?

334
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:52,038
Do you know that all these years,

335
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:53,200
I've always loved you?

336
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,200
I've been in so much pain.

337
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,240
Your pain...

338
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:05,890
has nothing to do with me.

339
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,240
Ye Fei Mo!

340
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,200
Do you dare say you don't love me?

341
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,839
As long as you say you don't love me,

342
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,170
I'll give up.

343
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,279
I won't pester you anymore.

344
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,279
The big ice cube that is Ye Fei Mo...

345
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,079
has been melted by a little nurse.

346
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,480
That little nurse is quite capable.

347
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:33,358
Of course.

348
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:35,000
She can break into houses and scale walls.

349
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:36,679
She can even make all kinds of delicious food...

350
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,759
for Fei Mo.

351
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:39,240
How can she be ordinary?

352
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:41,920
It seems like I don't know a lot of stories.

353
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:43,650
Tell me.

354
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:45,279
Do I have to do as you say?

355
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:46,890
You're such a good friend.

356
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:47,890
Of course.

357
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:54,410
Han Hui, where were you?

358
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,359
I ran into an old friend.

359
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,410
We had a chat.

360
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,039
What happened?

361
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,240
Nothing.

362
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:01,279
Han Hui.

363
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,240
Ms. Han.

364
00:18:06,241 --> 00:18:07,479
Let me introduce you.

365
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,079
This is my fiancée, Jiang Ling Er.

366
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,279
Hello.

367
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,758
I didn't have time...

368
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:13,839
to chat with you earlier.

369
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,719
I've heard about you from Jiang Fang.

370
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,079
Seeing you today, it's true that you're exceptional.

371
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:19,039
Here's the thing.

372
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,890
I want to ask you to make a promotional video.

373
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,200
Mr. Jiang,

374
00:18:23,201 --> 00:18:24,239
for work-related matters,

375
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,480
you should talk to me.

376
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:29,598
Next week is Aurora's 10th anniversary.

377
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:31,409
So I want to invite Ms. Han...

378
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,439
to shoot Aurora's promotional video...

379
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,759
with Ling Er.

380
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:39,318
Ling Er is not just the young lady of Aurora.

381
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:40,960
She is also an actress.

382
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:43,410
An actress?

383
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,278
Ms. Han's collaborators...

384
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:46,720
are all international superstars.

385
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,650
I know Ms. Han's status.

386
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:51,719
But in China,

387
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,440
Aurora is also one of the top film companies.

388
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:55,319
Shooting a promotional video for Aurora...

389
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,200
can increase Ms. Han's popularity.

390
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,558
It can also help Ms. Han...

391
00:18:58,559 --> 00:18:59,720
in her plan to return home.

392
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,319
Thank you for the recommendation, Mr. Jiang.

393
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:05,039
But with Ms. Han's current popularity,

394
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:07,890
we don't need a collaborative promotional video.

395
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:13,919
Ms. Han, Mr. Li from Orange Sky...

396
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,319
wants to talk to you about a movie.

397
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:18,410
Excuse me.

398
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,039
Bear with it.

399
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:39,559
Go over there.

400
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,480
Wang Jia Yi.

401
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,960
Wang Jia Yi.

402
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,960
Why didn't you change your dress?

403
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,798
Why are you all covered up...

404
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:51,799
like a dumpling?

405
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,079
Are you pretending to be a mummy?

406
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,439
This is an important occasion.

407
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,559
It's a rare opportunity.

408
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,759
Let me tell you.

409
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,599
Apologize to Mr. Xu.

410
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,319
Simon.

411
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,720
Come here.

412
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:07,440
Director He, I'm coming!

413
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,410
Ms. Jiang.

414
00:20:43,411 --> 00:20:44,440
Enjoying the music?

415
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,318
Aurora asked you to come to the banquet...

416
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:49,720
to entertain clients,

417
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,279
not hide here and listen to music.

418
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,409
No wonder you're not popular.

419
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:54,720
You've always been ungrateful.

420
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Ling Er.

421
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,960
You can say it when we get
back. This is inappropriate here.

422
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,079
Why is it inappropriate?

423
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:01,558
She's Aurora's contracted artist.

424
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:02,799
I have the right to teach her a lesson anywhere.

425
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,240
Jia Yi, go walk around somewhere else.

426
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,960
Jiang Fang.

427
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,480
Hey.

428
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:33,119
Have you lost your mind?

429
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,119
Isn't that Wang Jia Yi?

430
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,720
Do you like her?

431
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:44,650
Listen, she's so pitiful.

432
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,200
Mr. Xu.

433
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,759
Ms. Wang.

434
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:05,838
Playing hard to get...

435
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:07,240
is not fun if you use it too much.

436
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,799
Yes or no? Tell me.

437
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:12,640
Mr. Xu, I told you.

438
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,039
I'm not interested in rich people like you.

439
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,640
Please behave yourself.

440
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,640
Why are you pretending to be innocent?

441
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,519
Don't think I don't know who you are.

442
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,920
You're lucky that I like you.

443
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:31,200
Take note of where we are.

444
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,279
Don't lose your dignity.

445
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:36,359
Mr. Xu.

446
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,640
Here, a toast to you.

447
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:40,200
- It has been a long time.
- It has been a long time.

448
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:49,599
You don't even have to speak to pick up girls now.

449
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,759
Impressive.

450
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,480
She said...

451
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:55,000
she doesn't like rich people.

452
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,519
Then you fit the criteria.

453
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,798
Are you stupid?

454
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:01,199
She said she doesn't like rich people.

455
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,680
I'm very rich.

456
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,319
Do you want to know why?

457
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,759
Tell me.

458
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:11,799
Do I have to do as you say?

459
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:14,799
Just tell me.

460
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:16,279
Actually,

461
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,640
I looked her up online before.

462
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,240
But there isn't much information on her.

463
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,680
Why is that?

464
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:26,119
Wang Jia Yi...

465
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,319
had potential when she debuted.

466
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:29,599
In her senior year of college,

467
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,519
she was in the movie of an international director.

468
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:33,559
She even won the Best Newcomer Award.

469
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:36,798
She was getting a lot of offers.

470
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:37,879
The company was promoting her,

471
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,880
but she suddenly dropped out.

472
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:40,599
Why?

473
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:43,358
Because she got a boyfriend...

474
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:44,400
from a rich family.

475
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,680
That boyfriend...

476
00:23:45,681 --> 00:23:46,960
didn't want her to be an actress.

477
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,999
So she really did withdraw from the industry...

478
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,319
and stayed home with her boyfriend.

479
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,680
In the end,

480
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:53,480
for the sake of his family's interests,

481
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,240
the rich boy married a rich girl.

482
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,959
Returning to the industry now,

483
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,960
she has lost all her resources...

484
00:23:57,961 --> 00:23:59,039
and become invisible.

485
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:00,599
So look.

486
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,759
No one knows about her.

487
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:05,079
That guy is such a jerk.

488
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
But...

489
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:09,440
not all rich people are like that.

490
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,759
I'm not like that.

491
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:14,720
She doesn't know you.

492
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,759
Wait.

493
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:25,920
Sir, do you need anything?

494
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:31,839
Take off your clothes.

495
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:36,599
Sir, what did you say?

496
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:38,599
Take off your clothes.

497
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,959
This is your homecoming party.

498
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,160
You can't drink too much.

499
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:06,680
Everyone is watching you.

500
00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:07,880
It's not good to drink like this.

501
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,558
Mr. Ye definitely wouldn't like...

502
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:14,720
that little bit player.

503
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,079
I think he's just putting on an act for you.

504
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:18,640
How about this?

505
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:20,319
Take the initiative.

506
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:22,000
Maybe if you show him goodwill,

507
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:23,400
he'll make up with you.

508
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:34,799
I heard...

509
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,240
"Blue Galaxy" has been rebooted.

510
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:38,920
I see that Li Can is here too.

511
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:41,999
You aren't thinking of starring...

512
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,119
in "Blue Galaxy" again, are you?

513
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,640
Right now,

514
00:25:48,641 --> 00:25:50,440
there are a lot of good projects that want us.

515
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,480
And many of them...

516
00:25:51,481 --> 00:25:53,160
are major international movies.

517
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,319
Why would you give up on such good projects...

518
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,200
to start all over again?

519
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,240
That's the only way...

520
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,319
that I can get back to him.

521
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:11,279
Ms. Han Hui.

522
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,880
I'm from Golden Harvest Films.

523
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:15,119
We...

524
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,160
Sir,

525
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:17,799
you can talk to me about work.

526
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,200
- It's a very good film. - What's your project?

527
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:27,479
"Fei-hung, A Legacy".

528
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,359
- I'm sorry. - "Mulan versus Canada".

529
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,440
I don't think Han Hui will be interested.

530
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,758
Our company...

531
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:43,400
has a new management section.

532
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:44,640
I'm preparing to sign some newcomers.

533
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,039
I think you're quite suitable.

534
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,119
Do you have any thoughts on that?

535
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,240
But my contract hasn't expired yet.

536
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:53,519
So what?

537
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:54,519
You can terminate it.

538
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,480
We can pay the termination fee.

539
00:26:57,319 --> 00:26:58,319
It's just that...

540
00:26:58,599 --> 00:26:59,599
you...

541
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:03,119
Are you blind?

542
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,519
This is high-end and bespoke!

543
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,960
I'm sorry.

544
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,000
What are you doing?

545
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,079
This is...

546
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:19,680
Mr. Ye,

547
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,880
did you read the proposal I sent you last time?

548
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:23,519
What do you think?

549
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:24,960
Is there a chance for us to work together?

550
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,839
You, come and help me get something.

551
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,559
Mr. Ye.

552
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,319
Mr. Xu.

553
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,759
What about the contract?

554
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:33,319
What contract?

555
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:35,839
What contract?

556
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,559
What are you doing?

557
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,079
Cosplay?

558
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:43,479
I have my reasons.

559
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,519
Don't worry about it.

560
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,318
Just keep it a secret for me.

561
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:47,480
I'll explain it to you later.

562
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:54,640
Director Li.

563
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,079
Ms. Han, you're back from Hollywood.

564
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,960
I didn't think you would remember me.

565
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,960
It seems like...

566
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:15,720
you're still mad at me.

567
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:20,319
Ms. Han, you're now a Hollywood VIP.

568
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:22,799
All the investors treat you like royalty.

569
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,279
How could I dare to be angry?

570
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Back then,

571
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,759
I had no choice either.

572
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:32,400
The whole crew...

573
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:33,919
had to bear your burden...

574
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,960
the day before the shoot.

575
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,440
What an honor.

576
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,838
Now that the movie has been rebooted, I...

577
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:42,680
You've returned in glory from Hollywood.

578
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,039
You have an even bigger reputation.

579
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:45,440
My productions are small.

580
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,519
I can't afford you.

581
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,039
But I'm the best choice.

582
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:55,799
You seem to have come prepared...

583
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,400
to see me.

584
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:00,758
"Han Hui and Director Li Can break the ice..."

585
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:01,839
"and continue where they left off."

586
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:04,119
It's the best way to promote the movie.

587
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,199
Besides, my current resources and popularity...

588
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,640
combined with your influence in the industry,

589
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:11,720
the movie's success is evident.

590
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,160
I can't think of a reason for you to reject me.

591
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,559
Ms. Han, you're still as smart as before.

592
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,079
You're good at reading the situation.

593
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:24,200
If you agree to cast me,

594
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,200
I'll accept any conditions.

595
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:28,160
Okay.

596
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,519
There's a scene in the movie where you fall into the water.

597
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,720
To evaluate your acting skills,

598
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,519
please do an audition now.

599
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,720
Director Li,

600
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,200
you're being unreasonable.

601
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:45,480
I'm a man of my word.

602
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,359
Whoever jumps in will be the female lead.

603
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,880
Director Li, you're so funny.

604
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:01,079
Wen Xiao Nuan.

605
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,720
Someone jumped into the water!

606
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,640
Who jumped into the water?

607
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,759
Look!

608
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,200
Fei Mo.

609
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:24,200
Isn't that Mr. Ye's fiancée?

610
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,318
She was exquisite earlier.

611
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:28,160
Why is she soaking wet now?

612
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,200
Wen Xiao Nuan.

613
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:31,720
You're pretty good.

614
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,240
- Director Li. - I've said it.

615
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,519
Whoever jumps in...

616
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,799
gets to be the female lead.

617
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:38,279
The female lead?

618
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:39,319
That's right, Wen Xiao Nuan.

619
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:40,440
You didn't hear it wrong.

620
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,599
I'm casting you as the female lead of my new movie.

621
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:44,199
Goodness.

622
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,480
That got her the female lead role?

623
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,839
I should've jumped in too.

624
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:49,519
Why is it her?

625
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
That's right.
