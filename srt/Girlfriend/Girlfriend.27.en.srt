1
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,920
Did you hear?

2
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,239
Mr. Ye is dating someone.

3
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,040
Is Mr. Ye really dating someone?

4
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:46,200
How do you know?

5
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,000
Yesterday, there were 999 roses at the reception.

6
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,920
A bouquet this big.

7
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,239
At first, I thought it was a gift for a girl.

8
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,920
But when I found out, it was crazy.

9
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,000
It's said that some popular girl...

10
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,159
gave it to Mr. Ye.

11
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,239
What's going on?

12
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,480
Isn't it obvious?

13
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,200
Someone is pursuing him.

14
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:06,719
He received flowers yesterday,

15
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,000
and he's acting strange today.

16
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,639
He doesn't usually talk to people.

17
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,960
But he greeted others this morning.

18
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:14,810
Do you think there's a connection?

19
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,199
Yes, definitely.

20
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,280
Mr. Ye.

21
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:26,439
If you keep pouring, the coffee will overflow.

22
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:32,439
Who made you angry?

23
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,280
Pour me a cup.

24
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,719
Mr. Ye, the movie screening is about to start.

25
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,319
Xiao Nuan, hurry up and get changed. Don't be late.

26
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,598
I saw someone deliver flowers to Mr. Ye this morning.

27
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:00,239
Again? I'll sit and wait for more tea.

28
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,918
Mr. Ye is so popular with girls.

29
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,560
I feel like a gourd. Because I'm bitter.

30
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,199
Fei Mo.

31
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:11,280
I'm begging you, please watch your behavior in the company.

32
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:14,479
I can smell your love from ten miles away.

33
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,960
It's none of your business.

34
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:19,560
The screening is about to start. Where are you?

35
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:21,839
Didn't I tell you? I'm seeing my mom today.

36
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,520
Otherwise, she'll come to Anning for me.

37
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,800
Have a good chat. Take your time.

38
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,159
Don't fight.

39
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,240
Even if you fight, don't drag Anning into it.

40
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,199
Can't you be a better person?

41
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,800
Why do I have such a friend?

42
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,639
Have a seat.

43
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,839
- Do you mind? - No.

44
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,560
("Blue Galaxy")

45
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:10,920
Director, this is bad.

46
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,120
The male lead walked out.

47
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:13,680
(Declaration from Liu Chen Hao's Personal Studio)

48
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,519
Is it because of me?

49
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:16,639
It has nothing to do with you.

50
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:18,319
Wen Xiao Nuan, I'm looking out for you.

51
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,169
This isn't how you achieve stardom.

52
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,360
This isn't how you make money.

53
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,758
Anning will soon find out that you're nothing but a burden.

54
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,170
They'll get rid of you in no time.

55
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:27,879
You were the one who swore to me...

56
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,519
that you'd do your best with your first female lead role...

57
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,680
and not let down those who have expectations of you...

58
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,439
nor your passion and effort.

59
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,518
If you really can't handle it, we...

60
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:39,959
No. No matter how much pressure there is,

61
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:41,839
no matter how many people scold me,

62
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,639
I have to persevere.

63
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,439
It's a wrap!

64
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,759
Sister, I'm not leaving.

65
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,879
You won't come with me.

66
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:14,879
Is it because you can't bear to part with that mortal?

67
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,279
Foolish.

68
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,560
Do you know you've committed a grave sin?

69
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:23,680
Queen Mother already knows about your love for a mortal.

70
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,518
If you don't come back with me,

71
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,360
she will send Heavenly Soldiers to capture you.

72
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,079
The Cowherd will also lose his life.

73
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:33,159
Come back to Heaven with me.

74
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,560
Ask Queen Mother for forgiveness...

75
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,680
and for her to spare your life.

76
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,480
Sister, I can't go with you.

77
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,639
Ever since I came to the mortal realm...

78
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,879
and met the Cowherd,

79
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:46,759
my heart has long left Heaven.

80
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,399
- The Cowherd and I... - Hey.

81
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:50,839
- are deeply in love. - What are you doing?

82
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,240
- I have faith in it.
- I just want to sit with you.

83
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,199
For the sake of your lover,

84
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:57,359
you're giving up thousands of years of cultivation.

85
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,680
You're giving up being an immortal.

86
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:01,839
You're willing to wash clothes, cook, and be a mortal's wife.

87
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,160
I'm so disappointed in you.

88
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,600
Sister.

89
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,319
Before I met the Cowherd,

90
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:12,399
I thought being an immortal in Heaven was the best thing ever.

91
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,399
After I met the Cowherd,

92
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,600
I realized how beautiful the world is.

93
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:21,720
One house for two, three meals a day, and four seasons.

94
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,319
It's that simple.

95
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,519
- What's wrong?
- We'll grow old with each other...

96
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,199
- Figure it out yourself. - and be the most ordinary...

97
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,720
husband and wife.

98
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,600
Please give us your blessing.

99
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:55,800
First, bow to heaven and earth.

100
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,319
Second, bow to your parents.

101
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,759
Husband and wife, bow to each other.

102
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,799
You did a good job.

103
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,159
Mr. Ye.

104
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:45,679
Why are you sitting here?

105
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,240
I'm discussing Wen Xiao Nuan's performance with her.

106
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,919
Yes, we were discussing my performance.

107
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:59,120
You did a great job. Yes.

108
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:02,919
Director Li, what do you think?

109
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,759
That goes without saying. But are you happy with it, Mr. Ye?

110
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,759
There's nothing to criticize when it comes to you, Director Li.

111
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,559
You're right.

112
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,639
Let's prepare to submit it to all the film festivals.

113
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,840
I think this movie has a good chance of winning.

114
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,090
I agree.

115
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,240
Nuan Nuan.

116
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:27,879
Are you confident after watching the final cut?

117
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,799
Yes.

118
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:33,799
You guys talk. I'm going to rehearse.

119
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,720
Mom.

120
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,209
Why did you ask me to come home so urgently?

121
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,480
I'm busy.

122
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:54,720
Busy?

123
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:57,639
What are you busy with all day?

124
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,600
You don't even care about the family business.

125
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,559
You're always hanging out with the Ye family's son.

126
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,919
You haven't been home in a long time.

127
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,330
If I didn't call the Ye family,

128
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:06,000
I wouldn't be able to see my own son.

129
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:08,720
Didn't you tell my dad to stay out of my business?

130
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,759
We agreed to stay out of your business,

131
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:14,090
but you can't do this to us.

132
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,120
What did I do?

133
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,960
How old are you now?

134
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:20,639
When I was your age,

135
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,330
you were already born.

136
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:25,840
Look at you. When are you going to get married?

137
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:26,918
Have children.

138
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:28,759
Let me enjoy the joy of family too.

139
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:30,450
Soon.

140
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:32,480
Your messy relationships don't count.

141
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,879
I'll get to the point.

142
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,159
Mr. Zhao's daughter has returned from abroad.

143
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:40,559
All these years, she has been thinking about you.

144
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,960
You should go see her.

145
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:43,879
I'm not going.

146
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:45,360
I have a girlfriend.

147
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:49,240
The Zhao family business is growing rapidly.

148
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,720
If the Zhao family can work with us,

149
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,799
- our future will... - Mom.

150
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:55,919
I'm your son.

151
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:57,398
Not your bargaining chip.

152
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:59,000
If you really want me to get married, sure.

153
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,679
I have to choose the person I like.

154
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:03,759
Look at the people you've dated in the past.

155
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,440
Mom, let me tell you.

156
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:08,000
It's different this time.

157
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,519
I guarantee it.

158
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:14,799
Stop joking around.

159
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,600
In short,

160
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,879
you have to meet Zhao Di whether you want to or not.

161
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,200
If you're not willing,

162
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:22,480
come back and take over your dad's company.

163
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:24,519
Serve the family business.

164
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:27,840
Mom, don't do this.

165
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,600
Mom.

166
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:44,080
What did I do to make her angry?

167
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:05,799
(I miss you)

168
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,080
Maggie, ask Wen Xiao Nuan to come in.

169
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,559
Yes, Mr. Ye.

170
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,080
Why do you have time to eat with me today?

171
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,399
Ye Fei Mo is madly in love.

172
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:24,720
He has his hands full.

173
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,080
I sneaked out.

174
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,000
What happened? Did you hit something?

175
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:38,399
You're asking me? It's all your fault.

176
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,080
I think you should wear a mask.

177
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:44,440
Me? Why?

178
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:47,480
Because I keep wanting to look at you when I'm driving.

179
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,240
It's too dangerous.

180
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,399
Just focus on driving.

181
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:52,720
So annoying.

182
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,519
Mr. Ye, are you looking for me?

183
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,600
Come here.

184
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,639
What are you doing?

185
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:41,120
We're in the office.

186
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,639
You're playing hard to get with me.

187
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,720
You pretend to be unhappy...

188
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:56,440
to make me rack my brains.

189
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:58,799
Then you give me a surprise to cheer me up.

190
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,840
When did you put it in my pocket?

191
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,240
You tell me first.

192
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:16,360
What's going on with that suitor?

193
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,399
What suitor?

194
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,960
Don't you have one?

195
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,480
I don't.

196
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:24,519
Then where did the 999 roses come from?

197
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,519
Silly girl.

198
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:33,639
She gave me flowers.

199
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:35,000
But I didn't do anything.

200
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:38,519
What? Are you afraid someone will take me away from you?

201
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,639
I'm not afraid.

202
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,320
I told Maggie to throw them away.

203
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:48,679
I'll only accept flowers from Ms. Wen from now on.

204
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,759
Who wants to give you flowers?

205
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:55,799
Nuan Nuan.

206
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,279
Let's announce our relationship.

207
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,559
I want the whole world to know...

208
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:03,360
that you're my girlfriend.

209
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,120
I haven't decided yet.

210
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:14,440
Why don't we wait for the right time?

211
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,000
Don't be angry.

212
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,559
I can forgive you.

213
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,840
But you have to give me a reward.

214
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:29,519
A reward?

215
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,519
I'll reward you with a date tomorrow.

216
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,519
What kind of reward is that?

217
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,480
We're a couple. Going on dates is normal.

218
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,399
Then...

219
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,120
Check these again.

220
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,320
Okay.

221
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:02,679
Ms. Zhou.

222
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,960
Mr. Ye is in a meeting right now.

223
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,080
Why don't you see him later?

224
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,559
I'll wait for him upstairs.

225
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:12,320
He might take a long time.

226
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,519
Why don't you come back later?

227
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:18,000
- Xiao Nuan. - Xiao Jing.

228
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,919
Maggie.

229
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,519
Mr. Ye.

230
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,159
What's going on? You look so happy.

231
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,480
What's the matter?

232
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,759
This is the summary of performance of our artists for this quarter.

233
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:51,840
Mr. Ye.

234
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,480
If there's nothing else, I'll get back to work.

235
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:37,839
Fei Mo, I just sent you the report.

236
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,039
Take a look at it when you can.

237
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:42,079
It's the weekend. Don't bother me even if the sky falls.

238
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:31,599
Childish.

239
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,720
I got it!

240
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,519
I'm not riding it.

241
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,839
It's for girls.

242
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,649
It's been my wish since I was little...

243
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,890
to ride the merry-go-round with someone I like.

244
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:06,680
Didn't you ride it last time?

245
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:08,319
I rode it alone.

246
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,409
Legend has it that if two people who truly love each other...

247
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:12,559
ride the merry-go-round together,

248
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,359
it will take them to a perfect paradise.

249
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:17,319
Their love will last forever.

250
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:21,170
It's just a gimmick to trick young girls like you.

251
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,799
But you brought me here to confess your love last time.

252
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,759
Come on.

253
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:13,599
Do you want to come in for a while?

254
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:15,170
I'm not going in.

255
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:16,519
Get some rest.

256
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,039
I'll watch you go upstairs.

257
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:22,170
No, I'll watch you go in.

258
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,799
I'll walk you to the elevator.

259
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,960
No.

260
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,480
Be good, my little rabbit.

261
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:31,440
Go to sleep. Get some rest.

262
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:33,919
Come on.

263
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,479
Go in.

264
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,200
Go in.

265
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:40,240
Don't forget to send me bedtime photos.

266
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,039
Why did you open the door again?

267
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:01,170
"Blue Galaxy" is about to premiere.

268
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,170
I'm a bit nervous.

269
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:08,170
Silly girl, don't be nervous.

270
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,279
All the relevant information about the movie...

271
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,480
and the cooperation with the PR department...

272
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,960
have been arranged.

273
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,559
You don't have to think about anything.

274
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:17,920
I'll go to watch it with you by then.

275
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,960
Good night.

276
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:34,319
Good night.

277
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:50,920
Excuse me, miss. Your longevity noodles.

278
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,160
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

279
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:55,839
Even though you're alone on your birthday,

280
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,200
you won't be lonely with us accompanying you.

281
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,119
Mr. Bear will be sitting across from you.

282
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,319
Mr. Bear?

283
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:05,440
Happy birthday to you

284
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,359
Happy birthday to you

285
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,239
Happy birthday to you

286
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,960
Happy birthday to you

287
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:25,839
Happy birthday.

288
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,400
I knew you'd be here.

289
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,200
Do you mind if Mr. Bear sits across from you?

290
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,799
Of course.

291
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,920
Then can he sit next to you?

292
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,599
Please enjoy your time.

293
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,960
Thank you.

294
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:07,079
Thank you.

295
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,640
Dig in.

296
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:24,839
Is it good?

297
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,160
This is the promotional timeline for "Blue Galaxy".

298
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,239
On August 18th, the day of its release,

299
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,039
we'll need a lot of movie schedule information...

300
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,359
and promotional shelves in all major theaters.

301
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:42,079
This is the second roadshow plan for "Blue Galaxy".

302
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:44,758
Xiao Mei will be in charge of Shanghai.

303
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:46,880
Xiao Lu will be in charge of Shaanxi.

304
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:48,480
Tang Tang will be in charge of Tianjin.

305
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,000
Lastly, I'll be in charge of Ping Yao.

306
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:51,758
On August 20th, two days after the premiere,

307
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:53,599
adequate roadshow plans are needed.

308
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,558
On August 24th, six days after the premiere,

309
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,200
we need to update the online advertisements,

310
00:23:57,359 --> 00:23:59,039
the information, and topic direction.

311
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,880
You need to practice signing autographs from now on.

312
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:08,319
You have to sign these too.

313
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,439
Xiao Jing, when I came to the company today,

314
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,319
I saw the promotional posters and roll-up banners outside.

315
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,839
Everyone is busy preparing for the premiere.

316
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:21,838
I'm so nervous.

317
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:23,759
I'm afraid I'll disappoint everyone's hard work.

318
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:25,119
Don't be nervous.

319
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,639
"Blue Galaxy"...

320
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,880
has good reviews from those in the industry.

321
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:30,558
As the lead actress,

322
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,880
you've done your best and accomplished your task.

323
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:35,599
- All of us can see that. - Yes.

324
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,680
Thank you, Xiao Mei.

325
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,519
Real-time box office sales for the first day are out.

326
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,839
It's much lower than expected.

327
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:45,799
It's not ideal.

328
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,440
I saw it. I'll talk to you later.

329
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,960
Are you done?

330
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,440
Let's go watch my movie.

331
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:55,319
I have a last-minute meeting. Let's watch it another time.

332
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,440
("Blue Galaxy")

333
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,160
Are you afraid I won't be able to handle it?

334
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,240
It's just the first day.

335
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:13,559
It doesn't mean anything.

336
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,039
But "Blue Galaxy" is my first time as the lead actress.

337
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,640
It's like my child.

338
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,359
So whether it's good or bad,

339
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,960
I want to see it with my own eyes.

340
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,680
Come with me.

341
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,039
Okay?

342
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,200
Here.

343
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,079
- Is it good? - Yes.

344
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:42,119
One more bite.

345
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:46,319
Here.

346
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:48,319
It's good, right?

347
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:52,880
- I'm going to the restroom. - Okay.

348
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:08,640
Why are you here?

349
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,599
Mrs. Gu asked me to come.

350
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,720
You didn't come to see me, so I came to see you.

351
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:17,400
I'm busy. Leave now.

352
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,079
You're so heartless.

353
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,039
I haven't seen you in years.

354
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,319
Why are you so cold to me?

355
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:25,559
I even missed you and brought you a gift.

356
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,000
I know you.

357
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:29,160
Don't give me that.

358
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,440
Get out of here.

359
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,519
What?

360
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,200
Are you afraid I'll ruin your date?

361
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:38,440
Why are you still sitting here if you know?

362
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:42,160
I'm going to catch up with you today.

363
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,559
Yun Zhou, it has been years.

364
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:47,839
You're more handsome and composed than before.

365
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:49,758
I like you even more.

366
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:50,759
Don't.

367
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,359
Miss, I'm begging you.

368
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:53,599
Hurry up and leave.

369
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:54,599
When my girlfriend comes back,

370
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,799
it'll be a problem again, okay?

371
00:26:58,279 --> 00:26:59,559
Are you that afraid of your girlfriend?

372
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,880
Gu Yun Zhou, you weren't like this.

373
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,759
This girl is amazing.

374
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:08,720
She has tamed you so well, Mr. Gu.

375
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:11,480
I'm even more curious now. What should I do?

376
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:12,720
What should you do?

377
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,000
Hurry up and leave. What else?

378
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:27,799
You...

379
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:30,119
Yun Zhou, I'm sorry.

380
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:31,959
- I'll wipe it for you. - It's okay.

381
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,399
- I'm sorry. I'll wipe it for you. - It's okay.

382
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,960
I'll do it myself.

383
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,680
Who is this?

384
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,920
Jia Yi, she's my...

385
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,200
I'm Yun Zhou's childhood sweetheart,

386
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,200
also his mother's appointed daughter-in-law.
