00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,760
(Episode 36)

2
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,439
Mr. Ye.

3
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,878
I'll brief you on the progress...

4
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:46,640
of the new project we've been working on.

5
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:49,799
How much time do you need?

6
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,760
About 40 minutes.

7
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,920
I'll give you four minutes.
I'll get off work at 6pm sharp.

8
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,480
Okay.

9
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:58,799
Mr. Ye, let me explain.

10
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,158
Okay, that's enough.

11
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,159
Let's talk tomorrow.

12
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,318
I have something urgent. Meeting adjourned.

13
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:04,000
- I'm not done yet. - Meeting adjourned.

14
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,079
Fei Mo.

15
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,280
Why are you in such a hurry to go?

16
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,840
Isn't Wen Xiao Nuan leaving in two days?

17
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,719
- It's none of your business. - Yes.

18
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,090
It's none of my business.

19
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:16,759
That's why I'm gloating.

20
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,599
Our Mr. Ye...

21
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:21,089
is going to suffer...

22
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,120
for the next 365 days in the throes of love.

23
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:26,399
Zhou Xiao Jing is Wen Xiao Nuan's manager.

24
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,159
She'll be going with her on this trip.

25
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,159
She didn't tell me.

26
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,090
Looks like I'm not the only one who has to suffer...

27
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,240
in the throes of love.

28
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:44,800
We have interviews with fashion magazines next week.

29
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:47,198
We need to warm up our fan base.

30
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:49,039
That way, when the article is out, we can...

31
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,120
Come with me.

32
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,680
What are you doing?

33
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:55,520
Can't you see I'm in a meeting?

34
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,680
What meeting?

35
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:01,800
You...

36
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,800
- See that? - I'm sorry.

37
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,279
My goodness.

38
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,360
- What is happening? - Put me down.

39
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,599
What are you doing?

40
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:13,759
I'm working.

41
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,840
Can't I do this?

42
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:16,839
- Hello, I'm here to buy something.
- Sir, what do you need?

43
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,919
A diamond ring.

44
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:21,759
- You... - Quiet.

45
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,120
What do you think of this one?

46
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:30,719
The cut, color, and clarity are top-notch.

47
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,599
- I'll pay by card. - Okay.

48
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,400
If you don't make yourself clear,

49
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:37,840
I'll leave.

50
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,599
Zhou Xiao Jing, stop right there.

51
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:48,879
Marry me.

52
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,000
You...

53
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,159
Okay.

54
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,560
You've agreed.

55
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
My wife.

56
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,759
Who's your wife?

57
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:16,199
I know everything.

58
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,800
You're going abroad with Wen Xiao Nuan.

59
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,920
Once you leave,

60
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,480
you'll be gone for one year.

61
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:26,519
With you by my side,

62
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:29,240
I'll wait 10 years or 20 years.

63
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,120
I'll even wait a hundred years.

64
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,120
But this one year...

65
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,360
is too long.

66
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,680
I'm afraid you'll run away with someone else.

67
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,560
So I made the first move.

68
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,920
Then aren't you afraid...

69
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:47,319
of me running away with someone else while wearing this ring?

70
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,050
You'll lose everything.

71
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,560
Even if I lose everything in the future,

72
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,610
right now,

73
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:00,480
I have to give my wife the best.

74
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,800
Let's go.

75
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,120
Let's register our marriage.

76
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,959
I have to go to an event with Xiao Nuan.

77
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,610
After the event,

78
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:16,120
we'll go right away.

79
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,480
I didn't expect Mr. Ye...

80
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,839
to agree to let you go.

81
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,720
He said...

82
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,600
he wants to be the knight who escorts me to the throne,

83
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,079
not a stumbling block on my way to success.

84
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,240
Mr. Ye has changed a lot for you.

85
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,920
Here.

86
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:09,839
But when I think of leaving him for a year,

87
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,079
I...

88
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,120
You can't bear to leave him.

89
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:23,079
Xiao Jing, your ring.

90
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:26,800
It's from Director Li, isn't it?

91
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,480
Looks like you're going wed soon.

92
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:34,079
I'm going away with you for a year.

93
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,160
He was anxious. He's afraid I'll run away.

94
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,800
How nice.

95
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,240
Congratulations.

96
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:41,839
By the way,

97
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:43,560
Li Can told me...

98
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,839
Mr. Ye got a ring custom-made for you.

99
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,319
He was going to propose to you.

100
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:49,199
But then something happened,

101
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:51,199
so he never picked up the ring.

102
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,680
Hello, Fei Mo.

103
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,240
When are you coming back?

104
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:45,360
I have something to take care of outside.

105
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,759
I'll tell you when I get back.

106
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,240
Are you Wen Xiao Nuan?

107
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:06,160
Ms. Wen, welcome.

108
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,480
What can I get you?

109
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,959
I'm not here to buy anything.

110
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,278
I just want to know if Mr. Ye...

111
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:14,600
ordered a ring here before.

112
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:18,078
You mean Mr. Ye Fei Mo?

113
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,079
Yes.

114
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,319
Mr. Ye ordered a ring from us.

115
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,439
Did he come to collect it?

116
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,120
No.

117
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,240
I don't know why he never came to collect it.

118
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,240
When we called him,

119
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:33,639
Mr. Ye told us to get rid of the ring.

120
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,480
Get rid of the ring?

121
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,159
- Yes. - Then you...

122
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,480
Ms. Wen, don't worry.

123
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,638
It's such a precious item.

124
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:40,999
We won't get rid of it carelessly.

125
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's safe with us.

126
00:08:42,001 --> 00:08:43,480
I'll get it for you. This way, please.

127
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,359
This is the purest natural diamond.

128
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,480
It's the best cut.

129
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:03,279
As for the design,

130
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,239
it was designed by our head designer,

131
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,330
Dennis.

132
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,158
The design concept was requested by Mr. Ye Fei Mo.

133
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:10,240
The purest love.

134
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,840
My ring...

135
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,918
must be designed by your head designer,

136
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:21,960
Dennis.

137
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,960
What I want to convey is...

138
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:25,360
the purest love.

139
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:27,279
My love...

140
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:28,960
without any impurities.

141
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,840
The purest love.

142
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:36,678
Ms. Wen.

143
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:38,450
Mr. Ye really loves you.

144
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,209
How do you know...

145
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,600
that this ring is for me?

146
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:46,330
You'll know when you put it on.

147
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:53,758
It fits perfectly.

148
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,840
Yes. Mr. Ye came with a can tab.

149
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,879
He said to size the ring according to the can tab.

150
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,480
We were so surprised.

151
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:04,330
Have you heard of this?

152
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,398
Someone who can put a can tab...

153
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,678
through their ring finger,

154
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:10,279
they're especially favored by the heavens.

155
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,330
You had planned it all along.

156
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:14,399
Xiao Jing.

157
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,559
- You're up. - You're home.

158
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,440
Why are you so late?

159
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,120
- Have you eaten? - No.

160
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,600
I made steak.

161
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,200
Come.

162
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:51,840
When you're there,

163
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,159
remember to eat regularly.

164
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,399
If you're not used to the food there,

165
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:56,600
let me know.

166
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:58,600
I'll fly a chef over...

167
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,879
to cook for you.

168
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:05,799
If you can't overcome the language barrier,

169
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:08,080
I can hire a personal interpreter for you.

170
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,200
It seems to rain a lot over there.

171
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,879
You should always have an umbrella in your bag.

172
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,440
Also,

173
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:19,919
I heard that Jean Jacques has a bad temper.

174
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,440
But geniuses are always like that.

175
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,840
People like that are like children.

176
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:25,960
They're easy to coax.

177
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:33,519
When you're out and about,

178
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:34,879
you have to be careful.

179
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:38,000
Tell Zhou Xiao Jing if you need anything.

180
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,840
You can tell me too.

181
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:41,480
My phone is on 24 hours a day.

182
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:42,879
You'll find me.

183
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,960
Okay.

184
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:47,639
One more thing.

185
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:50,000
The most important thing.

186
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,519
Remember to miss me.

187
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:40,440
Mr. Ye, I've made all the arrangements at the villa.

188
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,799
The car is ready.

189
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'll walk home myself.

190
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,399
Yes, Mr. Ye.

191
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:29,799
(To Mr. Ye Fei Mo)

192
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:41,119
Surprise!

193
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,359
Mr. Ye Fei Mo.

194
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,240
Your girlfriend has arrived.

195
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:11,480
Please sign for it.

196
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:19,119
Why are you here?

197
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,440
Am I dreaming?

198
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:23,920
You should be arriving in France by now.

199
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,410
I sent you to the airport myself.

200
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,799
I don't want to go abroad.

201
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:34,119
I don't want to leave you.

202
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,279
I want to be with you forever.

203
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,170
Ye Fei Mo.

204
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,720
I did well doing the rehearsal.

205
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:42,720
Because this should be done by men.

206
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:56,480
From now on,

207
00:20:57,759 --> 00:20:59,039
every word I say...

208
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,319
will be the most important...

209
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,920
and serious words...

210
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:06,440
in my life.

211
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,170
Listen carefully.

212
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:12,799
You and I didn't know each other.

213
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,240
You barged into my world...

214
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:18,720
because of a contract.

215
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:22,359
I'm glad you changed your mind.

216
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,079
(Wen Xiao Nuan)

217
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:35,650
I'm someone...

218
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:37,279
who's cold,

219
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,279
selfish, conceited,

220
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,599
and insensitive.

221
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,170
It's you...

222
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:46,839
who melted me...

223
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,559
one day after the other.

224
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,039
You made me feel another person's warmth...

225
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,119
and care...

226
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,359
that I had never felt before.

227
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:02,599
You made me realize...

228
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:07,759
that life could be so beautiful.

229
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:10,960
You make me want to try...

230
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:13,559
to be good to someone else.

231
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,920
Wen Xiao Nuan.

232
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,440
You opened up another world for me.

233
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,359
You made my life complete.

234
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,279
You're the star of my night sky.

235
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:31,599
You make my life...

236
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,960
incredible.

237
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:36,720
This galaxy...

238
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,039
is so beautiful.

239
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:40,640
I wonder if the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl...

240
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,599
are missing each other.

241
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:06,359
Nuan Nuan.

242
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,799
I want to hold your hand...

243
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,240
and walk with you forever.

244
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:18,400
Will you?

245
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:26,759
Yes.

246
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,720
Kiss.

247
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:26,279
Kiss.

248
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:20,400
Hello, I'll have an iced Americano.

249
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,440
Okay.

250
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,598
Take this number and I'll bring it to you.

251
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:24,599
Okay.

252
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,160
Is it sweet?

253
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,399
Yes.

254
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,559
I asked them to put in a lot of sugar.

255
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,200
You scared me.

256
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:45,039
Am I that scary?

257
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,240
Jia Yi.

258
00:25:49,241 --> 00:25:50,278
Don't get the wrong idea.

259
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:52,640
There's nothing going on between us.

260
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,279
Hey, we shared a bed after all.

261
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,239
Do you have to push me so far away?

262
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,639
What are you talking about?

263
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,680
What bed?

264
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,559
Aren't you angry?

265
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:09,160
Why would I be?

266
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:10,519
I trust Yun Zhou.

267
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:11,799
See?

268
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,758
Jia Yi and I are closer than ever now.

269
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:14,799
Nothing you say will change that.

270
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:17,358
All right.

271
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:19,079
Congratulations, you passed the test.

272
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,000
Sorry.

273
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:25,400
I'm really not interested in this guy.

274
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:27,078
However,

275
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:28,598
we did share a cradle bed...

276
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:29,640
and grow up together.

277
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,278
I have to be concerned for him.

278
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,838
Don't you think so?

279
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:35,199
So the bed was a cradle bed.

280
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,239
Of course.

281
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,240
What did you think it was?

282
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,240
I wouldn't fall for him.

283
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,518
Listen.

284
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:41,200
Don't be fooled by his good looks now.

285
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,679
He used to have snot...

286
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,000
- that could go on for three feet. - Stop.

287
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:47,000
You should get back to what you were doing.

288
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,318
Don't cause trouble here.

289
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:50,279
How am I causing trouble?

290
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,880
She wants me to know you better. Right?

291
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:55,559
Why are you two siding with each other?

292
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,278
I have a lot of dirt on him.

293
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:01,679
- Do you want to hear it? - Yes.

294
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,920
- Let me tell you. - Wait.

295
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:05,240
Jia Yi and I have work to do.

296
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,400
Tell it to yourself if you want.

297
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,440
Let's go.

298
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:09,799
Wait.

299
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,480
- Let's go. - I...

300
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:16,599
(Zhao Group)

301
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,079
Ms. Zhao.

302
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:29,640
Hello, Ms. Zhao.

303
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,559
Hello, Mr. Jiang.

304
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:36,200
I've read your resume.

305
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:37,599
It's excellent.

306
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:39,920
You're more than qualified for this position.

307
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,359
You flatter me, Ms. Zhao.

308
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,440
However, I have another question.

309
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:45,519
Go ahead.

310
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,159
Based on your resume,

311
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,359
you should have a lot of choices.

312
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,159
Actually, you don't have to settle...

313
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,799
for my start-up.

314
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:54,640
I wonder if you...

315
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,160
In the past,

316
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,160
every decision I made...

317
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:01,039
was laced with multiple motives.

318
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:03,279
So in the end,...

319
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:04,839
I lost my way...

320
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,960
and forgot my original intention.

321
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
This time,

322
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,559
I want to grow with the projects...

323
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,519
and work with my team side by side.

324
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:17,440
I want to give the love I had,

325
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,759
the love I received,

326
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:22,160
and the love I'll have in the future,

327
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:24,759
a sincere...

328
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,680
and satisfactory answer.

329
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,079
Welcome to the team.

330
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,799
I also just started my business.

331
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,079
Let's do our best in the future.

332
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:36,400
Okay.

333
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,920
Okay. Lower your head.

334
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,279
Look this way.

335
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,519
Okay, smile.

336
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,319
Smile a little. Okay.

337
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,519
Look this way.

338
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,759
Smile.

339
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,479
Very good.

340
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,279
- I'll hold your dress for you.
- Let's change poses, okay?

341
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,400
Good.

342
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,720
Fei Mo!

343
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:42,640
Fei Mo!

344
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,480
Sir.

345
00:29:58,119 --> 00:29:59,119
Sir.

346
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:08,680
Is anyone there?

347
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:11,240
Is anyone there?

348
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:15,680
Help!

349
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,680
Have you seen a lady with a birthmark like this?

350
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:20,599
No.

351
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,480
Excuse me.

352
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,640
Have you seen a birthmark like this?

353
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,680
(Model Han Hui)

354
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,319
Please make it look real.

355
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:41,839
Don't worry.

356
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:02,680
Fei Mo, are you okay?

357
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:33,519
You don't even remember saving me.

358
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,759
I've saved a lot of people at the beach.

359
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:37,279
Do you think you're cool?

360
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,440
Why should I remember you?

361
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,000
Wen Xiao Nuan!
