1
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,760
(Episode 32)

2
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,560
Xiao Nuan.

3
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:42,959
Isn't this you?

4
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,239
What?

5
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Look.

6
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,439
The young Han Hui looks so much like you.

7
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,920
I didn't notice it before,

8
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:52,640
but now I do.

9
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,680
(The 20-year-old me, how are you doing?)

10
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,199
You approached me at first...

11
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:16,280
because I look like her.

12
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,199
I do think we look quite similar.

13
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:22,280
It's just that you're younger than me.

14
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,758
Hey, they really do look alike.

15
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:22,800
Yes.

16
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,360
I didn't notice because their aura was so different before.

17
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:27,679
Now that their styles are the same, I do notice it.

18
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,960
That's right. It's like looking in the mirror.

19
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,000
In that case,

20
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,198
aren't both of them and Mr. Ye...

21
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,879
just like the story in this script?

22
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,280
Yes.

23
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:38,478
This is what they call a drama of life.

24
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,639
Amazing.

25
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,119
Look at her. She's just like a substitute.

26
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,199
She doesn't even know it.

27
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,120
What's going on?

28
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:55,959
It's not like that, Director.

29
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,039
What's not like that?

30
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,680
Ms. Han Hui's hair and makeup...

31
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,559
is not the look for this scene.

32
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,919
Yes, they look so alike.

33
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,119
Director.

34
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,680
Since when did we have two Han Huis?

35
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,800
I know, right?

36
00:04:05,801 --> 00:04:07,198
We didn't notice it before,

37
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,520
but they look so much alike.

38
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,239
That's right.

39
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,560
They look so alike.

40
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:14,560
Han Hui, who did your hair and makeup?

41
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,319
Why is it the same as Wen Xiao Nuan's?

42
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,759
- They look so alike. - Right.

43
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:24,680
- Ms. Han! - Ms. Wen!

44
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,240
They really look alike.

45
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:29,519
Yes, they look so alike!

46
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,078
So the story of "Twin Flowers"...

47
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:33,000
tells your own story, is that right?

48
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,279
What did you come for?

49
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,519
Director Li.

50
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:39,000
Aurora Film arranged this visit.

51
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,839
This is my set.

52
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,318
You're disturbing the filming.

53
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:44,050
No one is allowed in here!

54
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:45,920
And you, Han Hui.

55
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,170
Why did you change your hair and makeup?

56
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:48,560
You know very well...

57
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,639
that look doesn't suit this scene at all.

58
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,839
Director Li.

59
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:54,359
This scene...

60
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,319
is the ultimate battle between the two lead actresses.

61
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,360
It's a spiritual choice.

62
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,198
Similar makeup and hair...

63
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:02,730
exudes the spirit of the performance.

64
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,480
I'm just trying to portray this scene better.

65
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,639
Wen Xiao Nuan.

66
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,240
You're one of the lead actresses as well.

67
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,680
What do you think?

68
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,920
Art creation...

69
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,639
is a collision of inspirations.

70
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,279
If you have your own idea,

71
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:24,920
you can share it with us.

72
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:30,399
Director.

73
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,079
I think Han Hui is right.

74
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,720
This is the most important scene.

75
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:40,480
Having similar hair and makeup...

76
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,079
will make it a huge hit.

77
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:44,600
Please shoot the scene as it is.

78
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,319
Are you sure?

79
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,680
As an actress,

80
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,279
I have to be able...

81
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:57,920
to handle anything that happens.

82
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:10,680
Look at this little face. So beautiful.

83
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:11,959
Those eyes...

84
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,040
look just like mine.

85
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:17,319
No wonder Yue likes you.

86
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:20,800
I admit.

87
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:23,240
I do look a bit like you.

88
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:26,079
But the one Yue loves is me.

89
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,600
You overestimate yourself.

90
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,078
Yue is the son of a wealthy family.

91
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:33,879
Why would he like a girl like you...

92
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:35,879
who comes from a fisher family?

93
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:38,600
You don't know, do you?

94
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,759
Even your appearance is because of me.

95
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,800
His family doesn't like me.

96
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:48,318
So they arranged for you to stay by his side...

97
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,199
to drive me away.

98
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:54,079
Although my family background is different from Yue's,

99
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:56,839
I know him better than you do.

100
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:58,680
I love him more than you do.

101
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:01,040
I'm willing to give up everything for him.

102
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:03,720
But all you've done is betray and abandon him.

103
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:08,000
During the years I was away,

104
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,759
Yue has never been with another woman.

105
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:14,519
That shows how much he loves me.

106
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:22,040
When you first met him,

107
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,958
he was like an iceberg...

108
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,519
that wouldn't melt.

109
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:27,680
He pushed you far away.

110
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:30,439
You tried so hard to get close to him.

111
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:32,519
Gradually,

112
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,759
it seemed like he opened up.

113
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:38,079
You thought...

114
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,958
you moved him...

115
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,319
and he fell in love with you.

116
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,680
But you're just being delusional.

117
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,000
He just takes you for me.

118
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:54,399
He takes you as a temporary comfort.

119
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,240
Only because...

120
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:00,319
you have a face that looks like mine.

121
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,079
How pathetic.

122
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,439
The man you love with all your heart,

123
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,120
from beginning to end,

124
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,920
has only thought of you as a substitute.

125
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,319
If I were you,

126
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,240
I'd let go.

127
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,920
Let go of Yue.

128
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:26,319
Let go of yourself too.

129
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:45,450
I can see why you're a movie star.

130
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,919
You almost convinced me with your words...

131
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,919
that Yue truly loves you.

132
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,399
What do you mean?

133
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:56,240
Back then, for the sake of your future,

134
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,600
and wealth and fame,

135
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,159
you abandoned Yue.

136
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,240
He was devastated.

137
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:05,879
All these years,

138
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:08,519
he's been shutting himself off.

139
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:12,090
Now that you're back,

140
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:14,279
you can't let him go.

141
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:16,399
You want him back.

142
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,919
But Yue is human.

143
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:21,799
He's not a toy that you can control.

144
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,798
You can't just abandon him...

145
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:26,279
and get back whenever you want to.

146
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,399
You don't deserve his love.

147
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,720
I was Yue's first love.

148
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:36,090
We had been through a lot together.

149
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,679
Who are you to criticize me?

150
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,000
Because it's me...

151
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,960
who showed up...

152
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,759
when Yue was in his saddest...

153
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,330
and hardest time.

154
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:50,120
I'm the one who helped him through the tough times.

155
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,519
I'm the one who made him believe...

156
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:54,679
in a beautiful love again.

157
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:57,330
What about you?

158
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:59,679
You only selfishly possess him.

159
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,639
You don't love him at all.

160
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:04,330
You just can't accept it.

161
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:06,999
You can't accept that the toy you threw away...

162
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,450
is now someone else's treasure.

163
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:12,799
Remember this.

164
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,120
Even if you look like me...

165
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:17,090
and have Yue now,

166
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:19,279
you'll always be my substitute.

167
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,279
You'll forever be my substitute!

168
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,840
Do you know what the saddest thing is about you?

169
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:32,330
You don't know anything about love.

170
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,919
You don't know how to love.

171
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:37,519
- You don't deserve love. - You...

172
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:44,120
I'm giving it back to you.

173
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,879
Cut.

174
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,480
Wonderful.

175
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,799
Bravo.

176
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,440
Wen Xiao Nuan's slap at the end...

177
00:10:58,759 --> 00:10:59,799
was on point.

178
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:03,159
"Twin Flowers"...

179
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,559
is wrapping up!

180
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,480
Congratulations.

181
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:13,360
Thank you.

182
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,759
That was great.

183
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,239
She left.

184
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,519
Why did she leave?

185
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,279
Don't go.

186
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,519
Fei Mo, I...

187
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:29,840
Mr. Ye!

188
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,639
Ms. Han...

189
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,600
Even if you look like me...

190
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,600
and have Yue now,

191
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:38,719
you'll always be my substitute.

192
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,440
You'll forever be my substitute!

193
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:45,759
Nuan Nuan.

194
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,840
What's wrong?

195
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:54,840
Why are you crying?

196
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,759
Are you okay?

197
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,200
Why did you run out all of a sudden?

198
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,039
Man,

199
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:04,000
Yue,

200
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,120
and Zhang Xuan's story is over.

201
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:12,200
Man still admitted in the end...

202
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,840
that she's just a substitute for Zhang Xuan.

203
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:20,559
I'm tired.

204
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,080
I know.

205
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,559
You've worked hard on this movie.

206
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:26,000
But it's over now.

207
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,559
Tonight,

208
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,960
I'll take you to eat something delicious.

209
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,080
Don't cry.

210
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:37,080
Aren't you tired?

211
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,639
You're here with me.

212
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,279
How can I be tired?

213
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,480
I'm talking about...

214
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,279
you being with me,

215
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,000
but you're thinking about Han Hui.

216
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:55,639
Are you not tired?

217
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,240
What nonsense are you talking about?

218
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,720
The shoot is over.

219
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,399
Don't get caught up in the story, Nuan Nuan.

220
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:09,639
Yes.

221
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,559
Han Hui is right.

222
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:16,240
"Twin Flowers"...

223
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:19,759
is the story of the three of us.

224
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,360
On and off the movie,

225
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:28,200
I've always been a substitute.

226
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,399
Don't overthink it.

227
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,360
I didn't want you to take this project at first...

228
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:39,399
because I didn't want you to have wild thoughts.

229
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:48,798
Can you say that you've never looked for someone else in me?

230
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:49,840
I...

231
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,039
- I... - So it's true.

232
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,879
Nuan Nuan.

233
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,559
The shoot has ended.

234
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,960
Stop making things difficult for yourself.

235
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:06,559
Yes.

236
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,559
I should stop making things difficult for myself.

237
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:15,679
Nuan Nuan.

238
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:22,960
Nuan Nuan!

239
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:25,639
Nuan Nuan!

240
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:27,840
Nuan Nuan, don't go!

241
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:29,639
Let go of me!

242
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,240
Stop messing around.

243
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:32,840
Let's go back and talk.

244
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,039
I told you.

245
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,799
I don't want to be anyone's substitute!

246
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,080
That's just a movie. It's not real.

247
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,360
Nuan Nuan!

248
00:14:44,419 --> 00:14:45,500
Nuan Nuan!

249
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,080
Nuan Nuan!

250
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,600
Nuan Nuan!

251
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,360
Nuan Nuan!

252
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:52,559
Nuan Nuan!

253
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,879
Nuan Nuan!

254
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,000
Nuan Nuan!

255
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:10,960
Nuan Nuan!

256
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,120
Nuan Nuan!

257
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:19,080
Nuan Nuan!

258
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,840
Nuan Nuan!

259
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,240
Nuan Nuan!

260
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:03,919
Nuan Nuan...

261
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,159
Stomach cancer?

262
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,320
Based on the test results, I'm afraid so.

263
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:22,279
But we still need to wait for the final biopsy result...

264
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,480
to confirm it further.

265
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,840
Fei Mo.

266
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
What?

267
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,360
I'm not dead yet.

268
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,440
Life is unpredictable.

269
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,080
There's nothing I can't accept.

270
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,000
But from now on,

271
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:54,759
the company will be counting on you two.

272
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,559
What are you talking about?

273
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,200
You just said you weren't dead yet.

274
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:07,410
You guys go back first.

275
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:11,279
I want to clear my head on my own.

276
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:16,890
Go.

277
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:30,839
By the way,

278
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,119
keep this a secret from my mom...

279
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:36,680
and Wen Xiao Nuan for now.

280
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,720
(Big Princess)

281
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:12,359
(Fei Mo, why aren't you answering the phone?)

282
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,319
(What did the test result say?)

283
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,559
(I'm fine. It's the same old illness.)

284
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:23,079
(I'll be discharged in a day or two.)

285
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,920
Nuan Nuan...

286
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:56,799
Why Fei Mo?

287
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,039
Why did he get cancer?

288
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,720
Don't think like that.

289
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:03,650
Wasn't he fine just now?

290
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,680
Couldn't you see that he was just acting tough?

291
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:09,960
He's been like this since he was a kid.

292
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:11,440
He thinks highly of himself.

293
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:13,920
He thinks he can solve anything.

294
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:16,319
But actually, the weakest one...

295
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:18,410
is himself.

296
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:20,519
What we need to do now...

297
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:22,799
is to treat his illness.

298
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,279
Medical technology is so advanced now.

299
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:26,960
He'll be fine.

300
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:29,410
Li Can.

301
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:32,440
Can we stop lying to ourselves?

302
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:34,839
Fei Mo has stomach cancer. It's cancer!

303
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:36,920
He'll have to go through chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

304
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,798
Then the cancer will spread throughout the body.

305
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,000
It's incurable.

306
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:42,519
Will it help if we sit down and worry about it here?

307
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:51,000
He needs our support the most now.

308
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:53,799
He's worried about Anning.

309
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,410
We'll give him peace of mind by supporting Anning.

310
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,319
He's already in this state.

311
00:19:58,519 --> 00:19:59,798
He still wants us to keep it from Ms. Cheng...

312
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,000
and even from Wen Xiao Nuan.

313
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,519
Has he thought about what will happen to him in the future?

314
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,200
This is Ye Fei Mo we're talking about.

315
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,200
Where are you going?

316
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:11,240
I'm going to tell Wen Xiao Nuan.

317
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:13,679
She has the right to know.

318
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,358
And Fei Mo needs her company now.

319
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:16,409
No.

320
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:18,480
Wen Xiao Nuan is not in a good mental state now.

321
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,410
She has gone too deep in her acting.

322
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,359
The movie is over,

323
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:23,439
but she hasn't gotten over it.

324
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,200
She still thinks she's a substitute for Han Hui.

325
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,480
If you go to her now
and tell her that Ye Fei Mo is seriously ill,

326
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,680
it'll only make things worse for her.

327
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:31,393
Then what do you want?

328
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,825
Do you want Wen Xiao Nuan to feel guilty...

329
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,038
for the rest of her life when she finds out about this?

330
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:37,799
This is something for Ye Fei Mo consider.

331
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:42,890
He's asking us to keep this from Wen Xiao Nuan...

332
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:44,519
to make the misunderstanding worse.

333
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:49,039
I think he's determined to break up with Wen Xiao Nuan.

334
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:50,599
Compared to the separation of life and death,

335
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:52,359
spending the rest of her life in resentment...

336
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,680
can make Wen Xiao Nuan feel more at ease.

337
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,240
You thought...

338
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:17,720
you moved him...

339
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,200
and he fell in love with you.

340
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,480
But you're just being delusional.

341
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:25,890
He just takes you for me.

342
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,200
He takes you as a temporary comfort.

343
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:32,319
Only because...

344
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,440
you have a face that looks like mine.

345
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:42,960
Even if you look like me...

346
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,839
and have Yue now,

347
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:47,078
you'll always be my substitute.

348
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:48,759
You'll forever be my substitute!

349
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,480
Nuan Nuan?

350
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,440
Nuan Nuan, you're home.

351
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:03,880
Why didn't you turn on the lights?

352
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:07,359
What's wrong?

353
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,118
I thought you were at the hospital.

354
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:13,279
Is Mr. Ye all right?

355
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,960
Hospital?

356
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,119
What happened to Ye Fei Mo?

357
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,480
Don't you know?

358
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,240
The media is all over it.

359
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,999
He fainted on the street.

360
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,079
He's in the hospital now.

361
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,240
Fainted on the street?

362
00:22:24,241 --> 00:22:25,720
is his gastroenteritis acting up again?

363
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,480
I'm not sure.

364
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,799
- You... - Yun Zhou.

365
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,199
Which hospital is Ye Fei Mo in?

366
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,279
Which ward is he in?

367
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:11,279
How are you?

368
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:14,400
Why are you here?

369
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,839
Can't I visit you when you're sick?

370
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:21,519
You've seen me now.

371
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:23,400
You can go.

372
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:25,279
I need to rest.

373
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,039
You've always had a bad stomach.

374
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:32,920
No one took care of you...

375
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,240
while I was gone all these years.

376
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:36,599
I heard your stomach has gotten worse.

377
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,359
You have to take good care of yourself.

378
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:45,799
Here.

379
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:48,000
I bought you your favorite seafood porridge.

380
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,880
- Have some. - I told you to leave.

381
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:53,839
I'll leave after you eat.

382
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,720
Nuan Nuan.

383
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,200
Since you already have porridge,

384
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:16,160
I won't bother you anymore.

385
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,000
- Nuan Nuan. - Fei Mo.

386
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:25,359
Nuan Nuan!

387
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,839
Nuan Nuan.

388
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:37,160
Let me explain.

389
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,759
Explain what?

390
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:42,680
That Han Hui's porridge is better than mine?

391
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,559
Or that it's true love between you two?

392
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:51,799
No.

393
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,400
I...

394
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,680
Stomach cancer?

395
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:03,160
Keep this a secret from my mom...

396
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,359
and Wen Xiao Nuan for now.

397
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,400
I have stomach cancer.

398
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,599
I don't have much time left.

399
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:15,200
I can't let Nuan Nuan stay with me until the end.

400
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:17,799
Instead of seeing her suffer with me,

401
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:20,319
I'd rather let her leave me in hatred.

402
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,599
Is there anything else you want to say?

403
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,000
Let's break up.

404
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:53,400
What did you say?

405
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:56,400
Let's break up.

406
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,000
Is it because of her?

407
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:06,599
Yes.

408
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:09,160
It's because of her.

409
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,400
She's the one I love.

410
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,039
She was,

411
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:18,640
she still is,

412
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,279
and she always will be.

413
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:26,720
Has she always been the one you love?

414
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:29,319
What about me?

415
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,000
What am I to you?

416
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,440
Am I her substitute?

417
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,480
Ms. Wen.

418
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:39,920
He has said what he has to say.

419
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,559
Everything is clear now.

420
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,680
Don't pester Fei Mo anymore.

421
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,279
This is between me and Ye Fei Mo.

422
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:50,359
It has nothing to do with you.

423
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,720
- You... - Yes.

424
00:26:58,279 --> 00:26:59,359
You're a substitute.

425
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:07,440
No.

426
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:09,960
I don't believe you.

427
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:12,880
I admit.

428
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,200
During this period,

429
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,759
I saw your cute side.

430
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:23,279
A side that made me happy.

431
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:26,079
I thought I was in love with you too.

432
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,279
That you could replace her.

433
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,599
It wasn't until Han Hui came back...

434
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:34,559
that I realized...

435
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:37,359
I didn't love you...

436
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,480
for a minute...

437
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:41,240
or even a second.

438
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:44,559
You're just a replacement.

439
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:56,640
Ye Fei Mo.

440
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:00,839
I don't want to see you ever again.

441
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,039
I hate you.

442
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,000
You have me in your heart, don't you?

443
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:25,480
We can be together again now.

444
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,839
Thank you for your help, Ms. Han.

445
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,480
You can go now.

446
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:48,680
Fei Mo, give me a chance.

447
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,519
I'll love you more than Wen Xiao Nuan.

448
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,839
That's not necessary.

449
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,920
We won't see each other anymore.

450
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:00,559
Ms. Han.
