1
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:46,319
Ms. Jiang, I'm sorry.

2
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,079
I couldn't do what you asked me to do.

3
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:49,719
You can't even do such a simple task.

4
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:50,920
What's the use of hiring you?

5
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,400
It was going well.

6
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,400
But Mr. Ye suddenly showed up.

7
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:55,599
Ye Fei Mo?

8
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:56,959
Ye Fei Mo again?

9
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:58,280
Ms. Jiang,

10
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,518
if Wen Xiao Nuan...

11
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,799
is with Ye Fei Mo,

12
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,480
you don't have to worry about Mr. Jiang.

13
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:04,078
Who do you think you are?

14
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,920
Who are you to teach me?

15
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,439
Do you think I'm afraid of him?

16
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,039
Why would my brother send
a loser like you to follow me?

17
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,400
I'll ask him myself.

18
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,120
Let's go.

19
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,360
Does it look good?

20
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,240
Yes.

21
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:52,400
Let me see.

22
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,879
I think it'll be just right with a little tailoring.

23
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,199
Jiang Fang.

24
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,199
Ling Er.

25
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:21,639
Have you seen Wen Xiao Nuan lately?

26
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,079
Yes, I have.

27
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,080
I went to Ye Fei Mo's house to get some information...

28
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,519
to confirm if they're together.

29
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,759
Are you still thinking about her?

30
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:32,239
Of course not.

31
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,839
I went there to get information about Ye Fei Mo.

32
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,718
I did it for Aurora...

33
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:36,879
and our future.

34
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:38,439
Really?

35
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:40,919
Jiang Fang,

36
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:42,560
I truly love you.

37
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,280
And you can only love me.

38
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,759
I'll trust you this time.

39
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,039
But remember this.

40
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,280
You can't lie to me.

41
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,599
If I find out,

42
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,919
I don't even know what I'll do.

43
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,680
All right.

44
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,159
Why would I lie to you?

45
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:57,240
I wouldn't.

46
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,520
You're thinking too much.

47
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Jiang Fang,

48
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,520
why don't I tell my brother...

49
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,039
to renovate the Linjiang condo?

50
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:13,519
I have a meeting at the office. I have to go.

51
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,560
Be good.

52
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,050
Okay, I know.

53
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:35,120
Jiang Fang,

54
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:36,920
what's wrong with you?

55
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,439
Why didn't you bring an umbrella?

56
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:21,480
I didn't have time.

57
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,519
But you're still sick.

58
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:34,920
This will worsen it.

59
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,360
It's all your fault.

60
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,839
You have to take responsibility.

61
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:56,040
Actually, the twisted Mr. Ye isn't that bad.

62
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:58,639
He saved my life.

63
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,879
Shouldn't I be nicer to him?

64
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,279
Mr. Ye.

65
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,480
Mr. Ye?

66
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:38,319
Come in.

67
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,079
Mr. Ye.

68
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:12,959
Mr. Ye.

69
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,120
Mr. Ye.

70
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,360
Let me help you up.

71
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:19,959
Slowly.

72
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:33,439
Open your mouth.

73
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:36,600
Here, have some water.

74
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:42,160
Slowly.

75
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:57,439
Mr. Lin.

76
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,800
You said...

77
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:05,720
you wanted to turn the tables.

78
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,920
How exactly do you propose that?

79
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,879
Content is king in a project.

80
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,518
For the "Blue Galaxy" project,

81
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,959
the most important thing is the script.

82
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:15,800
Rumor has it that the script is really good,

83
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:18,279
so it has attracted many
overseas production companies.

84
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,959
Otherwise, even Anning...

85
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,399
wouldn't have received so much attention.

86
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,480
So whoever has the script has the upper hand.

87
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:30,319
Do you mean...

88
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,559
we'll get our hands on the script...

89
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,039
and copyright it first?

90
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,159
That's right.

91
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,360
I'll do it myself if he won't let me in.

92
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:40,960
That's turning the tables.

93
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,210
I'll reap what he has sown.

94
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,039
A very nice move.

95
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:48,919
But...

96
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,879
Gu Yun Zhou seems to be
keeping a close eye on the script.

97
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,039
It won't be easy...

98
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,840
to get the script.

99
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:57,679
It's okay.

100
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,759
We still have another pawn.

101
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:01,120
Another pawn?

102
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:04,090
Wen Xiao Nuan.

103
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,840
Help me up.

104
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,600
Your fever has gone down.

105
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,360
Bring me some clean pajamas.

106
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,240
Where are they?

107
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:10,960
Over in that cabinet.

108
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,240
Is this it?

109
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:30,679
How about...

110
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,600
I help you?

111
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,799
I'm sorry.

112
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:07,080
You pinched my flesh.

113
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,080
I'm sorry.

114
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:14,399
Didn't you claim to be made of iron?

115
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,519
Why do you have a fever?

116
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:20,200
("Blue Galaxy")

117
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,279
How are you? Did you take medicine?

118
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:25,759
That's good.

119
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:30,039
It seems that this little nurse...

120
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,320
is quite attentive.

121
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,240
Okay.

122
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,240
See you later.

123
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,399
Bye.

124
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,479
This script...

125
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,600
that the major companies are raving about...

126
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:48,639
does make me a bit curious.

127
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:50,919
Of course.

128
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,959
There are a lot of people out there...

129
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,120
with an eye on our scripts.

130
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,559
Lin Zheng,

131
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,279
you're a senior in the company.

132
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,360
At this critical moment,

133
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:02,200
don't make any mistakes.

134
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,120
I understand.

135
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,320
Mr. Gu, you're right.

136
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:07,600
I'll be more careful in the future.

137
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,439
Okay.

138
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,639
Let's go see your boss.

139
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,039
We'll give this to him on the way.

140
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:26,000
It's you, little nurse.

141
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:27,639
Where's Fei Mo?

142
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,200
He's here.

143
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,080
- Mr. Ye. - You don't have a bad fever.

144
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:35,759
You came downstairs by yourself.

145
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,240
Cut the crap. Let's go.

146
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:50,960
Please have a seat.

147
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:00,440
Han Hui's welcome party is in two days.

148
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:01,960
So? Are you going or not?

149
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
No.

150
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,039
That was quick.

151
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,600
You were devastated because of Han Hui back then.

152
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,919
Has the little nurse cured you?

153
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:13,960
But...

154
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:16,398
this little nurse must be the longest-lasting...

155
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,559
out of everyone your mom sent your way.

156
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,359
Actually, I think she's quite a nice person.

157
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,360
She's cute too.

158
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:22,919
Maybe...

159
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:24,600
I should get her number.

160
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,360
Ye Fei Mo,

161
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,720
you don't even like her.

162
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,320
Why don't you introduce her to me?

163
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:36,960
She's my personal nurse.

164
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,159
Too bad for you.

165
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,000
Personal nurse?

166
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,919
How dare you say that?

167
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,600
You order her around.

168
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:45,759
Have you even treated her to a meal?

169
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,840
It's none of your business.

170
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:57,879
Thank you.

171
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,720
Ms. Wen, this is...

172
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,279
our second time meeting.

173
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,720
Yes.

174
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,519
I really admire you.

175
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,639
Because Mr. Ye...

176
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,519
is very high-maintenance.

177
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:11,839
I'm his assistant.

178
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,840
You know how it is.

179
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:14,919
It's all right.

180
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,080
It's all right. It's not bad.

181
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,480
Mr. Ye...

182
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,519
has never had women around him.

183
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,440
Ms. Wen,

184
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,159
there must be something special about you.

185
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:30,039
No.

186
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:31,600
No.

187
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,558
This project is going well.

188
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:40,639
But...

189
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:44,879
something seems to be missing.

190
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:47,799
What's missing?

191
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,679
It's missing...

192
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
some soul.

193
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:55,879
Soul.

194
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,999
Are you okay?

195
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,919
Didn't you only care about the commercial merchandise?

196
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:01,799
I'll think about this project some more.

197
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:03,559
By the way,

198
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,559
has Lin Zheng...

199
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,879
made any moves?

200
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,799
He's making big moves.

201
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:10,039
Didn't you see?

202
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,159
His eyes are practically glued to this.

203
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,679
He can't wait anymore.

204
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,518
Mr. Lin...

205
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:17,720
never disappoints.

206
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,159
Once he gives himself away,

207
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:23,159
we'll proceed as planned.

208
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Ms. Wen,

209
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:33,399
how is Mr. Ye's condition?

210
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,879
He hasn't gone to work for so long.

211
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,840
Everyone in the company is concerned about him.

212
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:42,119
Why don't you sit for a while?

213
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,120
I'll go and see...

214
00:15:43,121 --> 00:15:44,159
if they need anything.

215
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:46,200
Stay here for a while. I'll go check.

216
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Mr. Ye.

217
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:54,039
Lin Zheng,

218
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,120
you've been pestering me about our boss's health.

219
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,840
So? Are you relieved now?

220
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,960
Mr. Ye,

221
00:15:59,961 --> 00:16:01,240
I hope you get well soon.

222
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,600
Everyone in the company needs you.

223
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,480
I don't like what you're saying.

224
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,240
I'm still in the office.

225
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,799
While Fei Mo hasn't been around,

226
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:10,879
has anything gone wrong?

227
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:11,919
No.

228
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:14,360
Mr. Gu, you're also an elite.

229
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:15,799
Leading the company...

230
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,919
is a piece of cake for you.

231
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,440
Okay, stop sucking up. Let's go.

232
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,360
Take care, Mr. Ye.

233
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,000
By the way, little nurse,

234
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,839
Fei Mo's health...

235
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,200
is in your hands.

236
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,320
Thank you.

237
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,480
Get lost.

238
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,360
- Bye. - Bye.

239
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:17,559
Mr. Ye,

240
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:18,799
it's windy at night.

241
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,170
Why are you out here?

242
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,920
To get some fresh air.

243
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:24,759
Drink the ginger tea.

244
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,279
Sweat it out and you'll get better.

245
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:29,839
I don't like ginger tea.

246
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,889
Bitter medicine is good for your health.

247
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,720
You can't refuse to drink it just because you don't like it.

248
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:02,720
It's pretty.

249
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:09,119
It has been a long time...

250
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,518
since I've cleared my mind,

251
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:11,599
not thought about anything,

252
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:13,119
and just looked at the stars.

253
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:15,359
It's really comfortable.

254
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,720
Yes.

255
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,240
Me too.

256
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:22,759
I've been feeling very busy.

257
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:25,960
My parents passed away early on.

258
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:29,039
I raised Xiao Kai too.

259
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Look.

260
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,079
This view of the Milky Way...

261
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:44,599
is so beautiful.

262
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:48,480
I wonder if the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl...

263
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,079
are thinking of each other right now.

264
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,650
That's just a story made up by the ancients.

265
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,759
The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl don't really exist,

266
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,119
but their love story is beautiful.

267
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,559
The oceans will dry up.

268
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:07,890
The rocks will crumble.

269
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:09,889
Such a beautiful story...

270
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,480
has been passed down in people's hearts.

271
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,039
This is the legacy of civilization.

272
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:18,440
I didn't expect you...

273
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,079
to be so philosophical.

274
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm not being philosophical.

275
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,000
You'll understand once you listen to it.

276
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,680
Listen to it?

277
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:27,649
As if you understand.

278
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:28,799
Of course I do.

279
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,719
I grew up in a theater troupe.

280
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,200
I sing Huangmei opera very well.

281
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:35,759
Do you not believe me?

282
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,200
If you don't believe me, I'll sing it for you now.

283
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:48,518
Hanging fruit

284
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:53,680
On the shelf

285
00:19:55,279 --> 00:20:01,959
The wind blows the rice

286
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:07,799
And the sea dances the golden waves

287
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:33,559
It's so noisy.

288
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:35,649
No, it's not.

289
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,170
Huangmei opera is so beautiful.

290
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:39,199
Such a beautiful Huangmei tune...

291
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,000
was very popular in the fifties and sixties.

292
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,650
Huangmei tune?

293
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:47,440
If it were in a movie...

294
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:49,279
What?

295
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,240
Nothing.

296
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,039
I think I've found the soul.

297
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:56,799
Thank you.

298
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,720
I'm getting sleepy.

299
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,799
I'm going inside to bed.

300
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:29,759
Personal nurse?

301
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,410
How dare you say that?

302
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,319
You order her around.

303
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,480
Have you even treated her to a meal?

304
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:45,799
Blue Dream Hotel.

305
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:47,890
I'm Ye Fei Mo.

306
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:51,240
Why did I...

307
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,599
feel that way just now?

308
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,079
Tomorrow is the deadline.

309
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,240
How is your progress?

310
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,359
How did time go by so fast?

311
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,559
How can it be the last day?

312
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:45,440
I'm going out.

313
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,319
Where are you going?

314
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,480
I'm going to the office.

315
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,799
Aren't you on sick leave?

316
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:54,519
Today,

317
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,000
I have a very important meeting.

318
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:58,279
No, you still have a fever.

319
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,000
You can't overwork yourself.

320
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:01,839
I know what I'm doing.

321
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,359
Wait! Wait a minute.

322
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:07,279
Eat your breakfast first.

323
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:17,079
Drink the milk too.

324
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:25,079
I'm leaving.

325
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:40,440
What should I do?

326
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:42,838
Over these days,

327
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:44,640
I've really been thinking of myself as a nurse.

328
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:48,559
Today is the last day of the mission.

329
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,279
If I can't complete the mission,

330
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,519
what will happen to Fusheng Theater Troupe?

331
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,880
But for the past two days,

332
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,640
Ye Fei Mo seemed to be quite agreeable.

333
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:18,359
Why don't I ask him to help me?

334
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,559
He should be able to say yes, right?

335
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:28,119
I'll talk to him tonight.

336
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,160
Ye Fei Mo left the house.

337
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:33,640
This is your chance.

338
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,359
Hello?

339
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,000
Ms. Wen.

340
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,680
Mr. Ye is in the office for a meeting today.

341
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:01,160
He forgot to bring his script.

342
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,838
It's the script that Mr. Gu and I...

343
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:05,439
brought to him yesterday.

344
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,880
Can you deliver it for him?

345
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:10,160
Okay, no problem.

346
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:11,559
Okay.

347
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,319
I want more flowers on the wall.

348
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,759
- Okay. - One more thing.

349
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:27,319
Arrange them more nicely on the table.

350
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:29,558
I want that on the left. A little higher.

351
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:30,880
- Okay. - Okay.

352
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,960
(Wen Xiao Nuan)

353
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,799
Why isn't he picking up?

354
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,119
What's wrong with him?

355
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,319
He didn't even bring the script to the meeting.

356
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:05,359
Wen Xiao Nuan will be here soon.

357
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,518
We'll get the script soon.

358
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:09,160
Let's wait. There's no rush.

359
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:11,200
Don't be nervous.

360
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:15,720
Add one more bouquet here.

361
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:17,680
Do as I say for the outside.

362
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,799
Okay, I'll go get ready.

363
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,920
(MIssed call, Wen Xiao Nuan)

364
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,920
Go ahead.

365
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:53,359
This way.

366
00:26:56,519 --> 00:26:57,519
Thank you, Ms. Wen.

367
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,039
- Thank you. - Sorry for the trouble.

368
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:00,119
Thank you.

369
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:01,559
Bye.

370
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:15,359
I got it.

371
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:19,799
Good.

372
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,439
(Wen Xiao Nuan)

373
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,359
(12:30pm, Blue Dream Hotel.)

374
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,960
(Gu Yun Zhou)

375
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,160
Hello.

376
00:27:36,161 --> 00:27:37,200
Hi, Fei Mo.

377
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:39,119
Lin Zheng got the script.

378
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,640
He gave it to Jiang Fang.

379
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,960
It looks like Aurora really is behind this.

380
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,200
Aurora.

381
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,000
I'm not surprised.

382
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:47,799
There's more.

383
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,119
It was Wen Xiao Nuan who gave them the script.

384
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,440
"12:30pm, Blue Dream Hotel."

385
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,839
Why is Ye Fei Mo suddenly taking me out to eat?

386
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:17,358
Maybe I can take this opportunity...

387
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:18,519
to ask him to do me this favor.

388
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,880
But how should I tell him?

389
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,239
Wait, I should...

390
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,400
dress up first.

391
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,440
This is...

392
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,720
It's for you.

393
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,279
For me?

394
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:27,079
Come here.

395
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:27,999
The atmosphere is so nice now.

396
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,119
Say it.

397
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:31,880
Mr. Ye,

398
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:34,200
I'm wondering...

399
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,400
if you can...

400
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,479
(Breaking news)

401
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,959
(Aurora Film is registering the script copyright...)

402
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,319
(of "Blue Galaxy".)

403
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:55,359
(Aurora's new production director will be serving as chief producer.)

404
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:56,359
(This will be his first project since joining Aurora.)

405
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,519
Aurora got the script copyright first.

406
00:30:58,839 --> 00:31:00,559
Jiang Fang is the chief producer?

407
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,440
I gave the script to Lin Zheng this morning.

408
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,039
Why does Jiang Fang have it?

409
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:07,920
This won't do.

410
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:09,680
I have to ask Jiang Fang.
