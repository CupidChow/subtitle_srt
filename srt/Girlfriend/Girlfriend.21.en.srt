1
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:41,999
Jia Yi.

2
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,480
Tonight, let's watch the Geminid meteor shower.

3
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:47,640
Nuan Nuan, I don't want to go anymore.

4
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,640
Come on, let's go. We agreed.

5
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:54,640
Okay then.

6
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:08,719
Maggie.

7
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,000
I have a friend,

8
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,879
a buddy.

9
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,370
He...

10
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,810
He and his girlfriend had a conflict recently.

11
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:22,560
But technically, she's not his girlfriend.

12
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,319
They're not officially in a relationship.

13
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:25,960
Well, his girlfriend-to-be...

14
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:27,680
is giving him the silent treatment.

15
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:29,810
How do you think he should appease her?

16
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,090
What kind of conflict is it?

17
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,599
I have no idea either.

18
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,159
She suddenly lost her temper.

19
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,479
Then take her shopping.

20
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,959
Shopping again?

21
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,159
Then apologize to her sincerely.

22
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:45,439
No.

23
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:46,840
He didn't do anything wrong.

24
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,159
Then get a new girlfriend.

25
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,719
Never. She's the one.

26
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,280
His girlfriend...

27
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:00,479
is quite nice.

28
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:03,879
Mr. Ye.

29
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,520
Actually, girls are easy to please.

30
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:07,598
As long as you give her a sense of security,

31
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,759
she won't throw a tantrum.

32
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,120
She throws a tantrum sometimes...

33
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:12,280
because she feels insecure.

34
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,878
If I were your girlfriend...

35
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,279
and saw so many scandals about you,

36
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,719
I would definitely feel terrible.

37
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:20,240
Gossip can really hurt a relationship.

38
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:23,759
I told you it wasn't me.

39
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,639
I understand.

40
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:28,679
I was just using you as an example.

41
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,719
Okay, you may go.

42
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,639
(Wen Xiao Nuan: From the banks of the blue galaxy in the autumn)

43
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:50,159
Come to my office.

44
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:53,800
The Geminid meteor shower...

45
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,360
is tonight.

46
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,680
Is she going with someone?

47
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,159
Yes.

48
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,840
Don't worry.

49
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:05,120
It's Jia Yi.

50
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,479
Jia Yi and I were supposed to see the meteor shower together.

51
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,319
But we had a fight, so...

52
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,879
Do you know where they're going?

53
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,240
I do.

54
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,610
But what's the point?

55
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,438
I said so many horrible things to Jia Yi.

56
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:22,170
I don't even know what to do now.

57
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,839
Do you still love her?

58
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:26,800
Of course I do.

59
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,799
It's just that I was too impulsive...

60
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,199
and couldn't control myself.

61
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,519
Then you have to seize the opportunity.

62
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:34,959
Opportunity?

63
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,240
Come here.

64
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:55,519
- What are you doing? - Come with me.

65
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,170
Where are we going?

66
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,000
Where are you taking me?

67
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,959
I have an appointment with Jia Yi.

68
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,720
Ye Fei Mo.

69
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,800
Where is this place?

70
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,720
Ye Fei Mo!

71
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,199
Ye Fei Mo!

72
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:56,800
Ye Fei Mo.

73
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,800
Scaredy-cat.

74
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:04,480
You're a bully.

75
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,480
You're avoiding and ignoring me.

76
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,199
Who's bullying who?

77
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,959
Come.

78
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,399
What are you up to?

79
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,839
I drove for so long...

80
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,399
to bring someone to see the stars,

81
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,120
but I was wronged.

82
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,040
Thank you.

83
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:28,079
Come.

84
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:44,480
When did Nuan Nuan prepare this?

85
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,319
Nuan Nuan.

86
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,959
Nuan Nuan.

87
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,199
Nuan Nuan.

88
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,160
Why are you here?

89
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,758
It was my fault yesterday. I was too impulsive.

90
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:11,800
I made you sad.

91
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,720
Can you forgive me?

92
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,199
Mr. Gu.

93
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:20,399
Which one of your strategies is this?

94
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,319
I'm just a nameless actress.

95
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,120
No need to go through so much trouble for me.

96
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,720
Jia Yi.

97
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,759
You misunderstood what I said to Fei Mo yesterday.

98
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:32,278
I only wanted him to take the initiative.

99
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,399
It's all fake.

100
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,960
Fake?

101
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,679
Your words are fake.

102
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,679
Your identity is fake.

103
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,279
Which part of you is real?

104
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,679
My feelings for you are real.

105
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,159
Jia Yi.

106
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,330
Please believe me. I didn't mean to lie to you.

107
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:51,919
Jia Yi.

108
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,240
It's true.

109
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,090
I don't want to be deceived by you anymore.

110
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,879
I don't want to believe you.

111
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,000
Let's just go our separate ways.

112
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:10,720
Jia Yi!

113
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,600
Wen Xiao Nuan.

114
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,330
Do you trust me?

115
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:47,279
Many people...

116
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,120
don't think you're good enough for "Blue Galaxy".

117
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,679
But I kept insisting...

118
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,600
that you should be the lead actress.

119
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,210
Do you know why?

120
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:03,450
Because I trust you.

121
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:07,720
I believe in your ability...

122
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,519
and your perseverance.

123
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,559
Now, it's your turn to trust me.

124
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:17,559
Nothing happened between me and Han Hui.

125
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:19,330
She was drunk that night...

126
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,600
and was being harassed.

127
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,919
The waiter called me,

128
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:24,679
so I went to help her.

129
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,879
That's all.

130
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:31,330
Why are you telling me this?

131
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,090
Because I want you to know...

132
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,919
that Han Hui and I have ended a long time ago.

133
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,879
And...

134
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,159
my life...

135
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:44,879
has already started afresh.

136
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,600
A sky lantern?

137
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:00,120
Let's make a wish together.

138
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,240
Hold this for me.

139
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,440
Ready?

140
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,398
I'll count to three.

141
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,559
Okay.

142
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,279
One,

143
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,960
two,

144
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:31,039
three.

145
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,440
I've made my wish.

146
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:08,759
What about you?

147
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:10,799
Me too.

148
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:21,759
My nights...

149
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,159
used to be just darkness.

150
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,480
But since you appeared,

151
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,639
there have been stars...

152
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:32,639
and bright lights.

153
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,360
Wen Xiao Nuan.

154
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,240
Will you...

155
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,879
be the Milky Way in my night forever?

156
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:31,360
I fell asleep.

157
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,080
We should go back.

158
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:57,080
"Blue Galaxy" will start shooting in a week.

159
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:58,720
Be prepared.

160
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,960
- Has the male lead been decided? - Of course.

161
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,200
Really?

162
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,038
I'm all fired up now.

163
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:06,120
I'm just waiting for the shoot.

164
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,720
But after the shooting starts,

165
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,799
I'll be on set every day.

166
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,279
Work hard.

167
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:25,840
Also,

168
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,039
send me work photos every day.

169
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:29,679
I have to supervise you.

170
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:33,519
Then you have to send me your work photos too.

171
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,279
Why?

172
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,558
Your face is so cold.

173
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:42,240
I have to look at your photos in the summer...

174
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:43,720
to cool down.

175
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,240
Xiao Jing.

176
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,120
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

177
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,360
You can go now.

178
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:12,519
The filming will start soon. Don't be nervous.

179
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,879
I'm not nervous.

180
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:19,559
Xiao Jing, I have a question for you.

181
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,159
Do artists need to report that they're dating someone?

182
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,919
Who are you seeing?

183
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,120
I'm not...

184
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,359
I'm not dating.

185
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm not seeing anyone.

186
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,398
An artist's career is short to begin with,

187
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:38,919
let alone a female artist's.

188
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,360
Xiao Nuan.

189
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,159
You have good resources now.

190
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,960
You must make good use of them.

191
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,320
I know.

192
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,639
- Keep practicing. - Okay.

193
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,039
Let me tell you.

194
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:10,480
Men are all unreliable.

195
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,159
Jia Yi.

196
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:16,960
- Jia Yi. - Let me.

197
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,480
Jia Yi.

198
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:21,759
Jia Yi, open the door.

199
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:23,639
Jia...

200
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:24,639
She's not home.

201
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,758
Xiao Nuan, let me see her.

202
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:30,239
She's really not home.

203
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,518
If you have something to tell her, come back another day.

204
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:33,840
- I'm going to bed. - Wait.

205
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,279
Jia Yi.

206
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,120
What are you thinking?

207
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,720
You've been avoiding Gu Yun Zhou.

208
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,440
It's not a solution.

209
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,320
I don't know.

210
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,279
I want to calm down.

211
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,279
Give me some time to think.

212
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,559
(Filming commencement)

213
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,319
Let's invite the director to say a few words.

214
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,519
A round of applause.

215
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:37,839
Thank you.

216
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,759
Thank you for coming...

217
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,839
to our filming commencement.

218
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:42,960
We won't let every frame down.

219
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,119
We'll tell you a great story.

220
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,758
Director Li,

221
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:48,439
the male lead of "Blue Galaxy" walking out...

222
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,519
has been the focus of the public's attention lately.

223
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,720
Anning has never announced a new male lead.

224
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:55,279
Why didn't the male lead show up for the filming commencement?

225
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,889
Director Li, can you tell us...

226
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,318
who the new male lead is?

227
00:17:58,319 --> 00:17:59,440
The male lead...

228
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,039
will arrive next week.

229
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:02,839
You'll all know the answer by then.

230
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:04,650
But we can promise...

231
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,479
that we won't let you down.

232
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,480
As for the rest of the questions,

233
00:18:07,481 --> 00:18:08,960
please reserve them for the media question session.

234
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:11,199
Next, let's welcome the CEO of Anning Culture,

235
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,359
Mr. Ye Fei Mo.

236
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,240
Thank you, everyone.

237
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:25,000
"Blue Galaxy" is a beautiful and touching love story.

238
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:26,680
It moved me...

239
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:28,359
and all the crew members.

240
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:30,480
I promise you...

241
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,480
that Anning Culture will do its best...

242
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:35,000
to see "Blue Galaxy" to its completion.

243
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:36,959
I'd also like to thank everyone for your attention...

244
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,440
on the casting of "Blue Galaxy".

245
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,518
Next, I'd like to invite...

246
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:41,960
Anning Culture's S-class artist,

247
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:43,559
lead actress of "Blue Galaxy",

248
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:44,839
Wen Xiao Nuan,

249
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,319
to give a speech.

250
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,480
I come from humble beginnings.

251
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:12,079
I used to not know...

252
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,440
where my future lay.

253
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:17,039
I worked hard,

254
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,720
but I just couldn't get anywhere.

255
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,720
But I met Anning Culture...

256
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:24,319
and "Blue Galaxy".

257
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,000
They helped me find my way.

258
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:30,558
So I'll work a hundred times harder...

259
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,119
to seize this opportunity.

260
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:35,170
I'll cooperate with the director and all the staff...

261
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,119
to give you the best performance.

262
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:39,799
Thank you.

263
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:03,039
Action.

264
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:07,000
Cowherd and I have wed in the mortal world.

265
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:08,650
Please let us go.

266
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,720
Impudence!

267
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,519
You're not repenting and talking nonsense.

268
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:12,960
Come with us to Heaven to be punished.

269
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,000
Cut!

270
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:29,598
- Thank you for your hard work. - Thank you.

271
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:30,919
- It's really good. - Really?

272
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,960
Xiao Nuan.

273
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,559
Xiao Nuan, have some water.

274
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:36,200
Thank you.

275
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,000
Have you eaten?

276
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:49,890
(Wen Xiao Nuan)

277
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,559
Have you eaten?

278
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,200
I have.

279
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,890
Where are your work photos?

280
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,079
- Wen Xiao Nuan, hurry up. - Coming.

281
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:48,680
Can I help you?

282
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:52,279
Documents.

283
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,000
(Imperial Garden)

284
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:15,960
- Xiao Nuan, I'll go ahead. - Okay.

285
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,960
(Where are your work photos?)

286
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:24,480
Men are pigs.

287
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:27,039
He didn't send me a photo.

288
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:54,559
Jia Yi, you...

289
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,480
Jia Yi, let me explain.

290
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:00,319
Jia Yi.

291
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,240
You're mistaken. It's not like that.

292
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:03,640
Mr. Gu.

293
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,240
I told you.

294
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:08,359
Please don't show up in front of me again, okay?

295
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,400
Jia Yi.

296
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:12,839
Jia Yi.

297
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,720
Give me a chance.

298
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:15,880
Okay?

299
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,799
Jia Yi.

300
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:45,960
When I look at the clouds, I don't see you.

301
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:53,639
Who can I tell my troubles to?

302
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,640
Cut.

303
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,680
Very good.

304
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,559
Thank you for your hard work. Let's eat.

305
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,038
We're finally eating.

306
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:04,240
- Sit. - Xiao Nuan, this is yours.

307
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,319
- Thank you. - This is mine.

308
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,799
- Let's eat together. - It must taste good.

309
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,720
- It smells good. - Mr. Ye is here.

310
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,559
- Mr. Ye. - Mr. Ye.

311
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,279
I bought food and drinks for everyone.

312
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:14,359
Thank you for your hard work.

313
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,919
- Thank you, Mr. Ye. - Thank you, Mr. Ye.

314
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,039
- You're so handsome, Mr. Ye.
- Can we take a photo with you?

315
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:21,119
Three, two, one.

316
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,960
- Thank you, Mr. Ye. - Thank you, Mr. Ye.

317
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,439
You came all the way here to visit us.

318
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,838
Yes. How are things? Is everything going well?

319
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:28,359
- Very well. - What about Wen Xiao Nuan?

320
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,199
Wen Xiao Nuan did a great job.

321
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,240
That's good.

322
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,959
You're all working so hard in this hot weather.

323
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,039
Thank you.

324
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:35,640
Check out the rough cut when you have time.

325
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:37,400
- No problem. - It's done.

326
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,919
I'll take you to see it later.

327
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,359
- Okay. - But this rice is good too.

328
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,559
I haven't had hamburgers in a while.

329
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,558
This place is so good. I love it.

330
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:45,799
I like it too.

331
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:49,880
- Hurry up and eat. - It's so good.

332
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:51,999
Our crew's food is so good.

333
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,599
- Right? - Yes.

334
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,119
Give me some of yours,.

335
00:24:57,519 --> 00:24:59,519
He left without saying goodbye.

336
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:13,240
What's wrong?

337
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:20,680
Xiao Nuan, the director says...

338
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:24,240
we're filming.

339
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,680
Coming.

340
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,118
Mr. Ye and Wen Xiao Nuan?

341
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:34,200
No way.

342
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:35,838
Why not?

343
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:37,118
He came to visit her.

344
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,640
Besides, they were caught.

345
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,720
The lead actress "Blue Galaxy" is still Wen Xiao Nuan.

346
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,200
Mr. Jiang.

347
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:47,559
What about your promise to me?

348
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:53,000
I got some inside information before they started filming.

349
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,959
Ye Fei Mo...

350
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,559
hired Mo Xiao Bai to be the male lead.

351
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,160
He's Wen Xiao Nuan's co-star.

352
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,319
Mo Xiao Bai?

353
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,160
Doesn't he have...

354
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:04,078
a Hollywood sci-fi mega-production...

355
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:05,400
that's about to start filming?

356
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:11,559
Because of Wen Xiao Nuan,

357
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,160
Ye Fei Mo has lost his mind.

358
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,720
We can't let them go on like this.

359
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,079
What do you plan to do next?

360
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,759
Ye Fei Mo has never clarified...

361
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:25,160
the scandal between you and him.

362
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,559
Why don't you give it another push...

363
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,200
to achieve our goal?

364
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,519
- Deal. - Deal.

365
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,400
(Ye Fei Mo and Han Hui were together intimately!)

366
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,799
What's the relationship between Mr. Ye and Han Hui?

367
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,960
I don't know.

368
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,919
Did you see the news yesterday?

369
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,960
Yes.

370
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,960
- Ms. Han. - Ms. Han.

371
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,640
Excuse me, please make way.

372
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:00,160
- Ms. Han. - Ms. Han.

373
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,719
Ms. Han Hui, did you come to visit the set of "Blue Galaxy"...

374
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,758
because of Mr. Ye?

375
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:05,000
Okay, thank you.

376
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:10,000
- Han Hui is here. - Han Hui is here?

377
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,359
Cut!

378
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,799
What's going on?

379
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,200
How can we film when it's so noisy?

380
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,839
Let's stop. Take a break.

381
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:19,960
You're still so calm.

382
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:21,880
Don't you know the news that's spreading?

383
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:23,160
What news?

384
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,920
Han Hui visited the set of "Blue Galaxy".

385
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:28,599
What?

386
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,879
The reporters are going crazy about it.

387
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,240
They said the real girlfriend showed up to mark her territory.

388
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:35,880
Han Hui is really something.

389
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,880
Didn't you tell her clearly?

390
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,240
Tell her what? It's long over.

391
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:43,319
That's not how she acted.

392
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,000
But if that's the case,

393
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:48,000
the popularity of "Blue Galaxy"...

394
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:49,440
will go up.

395
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,599
Prepare for a press conference right away.

396
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,200
What are you doing?

397
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:54,640
You're going to clarify it?

398
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,159
Didn't you say...

399
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,640
you wouldn't let Han Hui get what she wants?

400
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,039
If I don't clarify it now,

401
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,200
Wen Xiao Nuan will be the target of criticism.

402
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,960
- Han Hui is here. - Go take care of it.

403
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:05,079
Okay.

404
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:08,319
If we're striving for perfection,

405
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:10,160
we have to take this detail into consideration.

406
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,038
Swing your sword inside the railing.

407
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:13,440
- Director, Ms. Han Hui is here. - Right?

408
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:19,920
So when you swing your sword,

409
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:21,160
you're inside the railing.

410
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,559
Look over the railing.

411
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:24,799
Director Li.

412
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,359
Kick, slash, block, stab.

413
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,200
That's the strength of the turn.

414
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,399
The whole body and the eyes...

415
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,720
are pointing to the sky.

416
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:38,119
Director Li.

417
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,598
I heard from Fei Mo that "Blue Galaxy" started filming.

418
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:42,759
I came to take a look.

419
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,200
All the best, Mr. Li.

420
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,880
All the best, Ms. Wen.

421
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,440
Everyone, please calm down.

422
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,640
Take a break.

423
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:51,039
Okay.

424
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:57,119
Ms. Wen.

425
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:01,400
- Come and see. - Will they fight?

426
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:06,119
This is going to be a show.
