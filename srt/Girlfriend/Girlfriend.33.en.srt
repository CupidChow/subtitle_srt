1
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,760
(Episode 33)

2
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,599
I thought I was in love with you too.

3
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:07,000
That you could replace her.

4
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,199
It wasn't until Han Hui came back...

5
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,280
that I realized...

6
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,090
I didn't love you...

7
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:17,919
for a minute...

8
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:19,680
or even a second.

9
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,360
In my eyes,

10
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,840
you don't deserve my love.

11
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,800
You're just a girl from a small fishing village.

12
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,439
And I'm...

13
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,000
the CEO of Anning Culture.

14
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:00,000
Did you really think I would fall in love with you?

15
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:12,759
It's just a lie a rich man tells...

16
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,520
to little girls like you.

17
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:17,639
You're just a replacement.

18
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:59,038
- Did you see the news? - Yes.

19
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,560
- About Han Hui. - Yes.

20
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:02,158
They look so much alike.

21
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,198
Why didn't I notice it before?

22
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,199
I know, right?

23
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,318
Didn't you see the photo?

24
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:10,638
- No. - It's really amazing.

25
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,078
- I didn't see it. - Stop it.

26
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,680
Nuan Nuan, what's wrong?

27
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,079
Nuan Nuan, are you okay?

28
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,838
- Have you heard? - What?

29
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:22,999
A big scoop from the set of "Twin Flowers".

30
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,360
It's said that Han Hui has always been the one Mr. Ye loves.

31
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:27,079
Wen Xiao Nuan is just her substitute.

32
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,359
- Really? - Yes.

33
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,560
That's so sad.

34
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,680
I know.

35
00:05:31,681 --> 00:05:33,480
Wen Xiao Nuan has only been with him for a short time.

36
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,079
How pathetic.

37
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,800
The man you love with all your heart,

38
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,079
from beginning to end,

39
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,519
has only thought of you as a substitute.

40
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:51,480
Let's break up.

41
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:53,839
You're a substitute.

42
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:09,758
Xiao Nuan, what are you doing?

43
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,759
Where are you going?

44
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:14,439
Xiao Jing.

45
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:16,399
I'm sorry.

46
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:19,000
I can't fulfill the contract anymore.

47
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,799
No. What's wrong?

48
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,878
Tell me.

49
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:22,920
Xiao Nuan!

50
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,800
Han Hui.

51
00:06:30,801 --> 00:06:33,040
The comments online are all on your side.

52
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,160
Han Hui.

53
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,519
What's wrong?

54
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,040
Linda.

55
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,120
To you,

56
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:50,439
what kind of person am I?

57
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,360
Han Hui.

58
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,120
You're already very successful.

59
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:07,079
You have everything you want.

60
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:10,360
I got what I wanted.

61
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,759
But...

62
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:17,040
I lost what was most precious to me.

63
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:23,879
Mr. Ye...

64
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,040
When I was with Fei Mo back then,

65
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:29,639
I didn't cherish him.

66
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,719
At that time, for my dream,

67
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,360
I had sacrificed too much.

68
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,240
I couldn't accept it.

69
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,920
I took my career very seriously.

70
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,519
Now that you've returned,

71
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,000
you can get Mr. Ye back.

72
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,000
He already has Wen Xiao Nuan.

73
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:58,120
That girl has melted it.

74
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,120
She melted the ice...

75
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,959
I put in his heart.

76
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:09,160
That Wen Xiao Nuan...

77
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:11,720
is just a substitute.

78
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,800
When she's gone,

79
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:16,279
Mr. Ye will come back for you.

80
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,959
Two people who truly love each other...

81
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,639
should become each other's dependence,

82
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,480
each other's weakness,

83
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,330
and each other's armor.

84
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:34,960
But I...

85
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:39,919
I don't think I've ever felt this way before.

86
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:43,000
So do I really love him?

87
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:44,480
Han Hui.

88
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:45,879
What's wrong?

89
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,960
I always thought...

90
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:54,840
that Wen Xiao Nuan took away my Fei Mo.

91
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,759
But now I realize...

92
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:04,240
that I had lost him a long time ago.

93
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:08,720
I owe Fei Mo an apology.

94
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,720
So you...

95
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,600
Are you going to give up?

96
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:37,600
- Hello? - Hello, Mr. Ye.

97
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:39,039
This is your jewelry designer.

98
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,679
Your custom-made ring is ready.

99
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:42,450
May I know when you can pick it up?

100
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:45,799
Ye Fei Mo.

101
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:48,720
I don't want to see you ever again.

102
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:50,210
I hate you.

103
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:01,519
Mr. Ye, are you there?

104
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,879
I don't want the ring anymore.

105
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:11,559
Please get rid of it for me.

106
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:59,159
Fruits and vegetables

107
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:04,639
Hang from the racks

108
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:13,039
The wind blows the sea of rice

109
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,919
With waves of gold

110
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:34,679
Hearing laughter in the quiet of the night

111
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,840
Fruits and vegetables

112
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,840
Hang from the racks

113
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:55,600
The wind blows the sea of rice

114
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:00,559
With waves of gold

115
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,159
It smells so good.

116
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,480
What do you think? Has my sister's cooking improved?

117
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:32,119
It's delicious.

118
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,600
Our a small fishing village...

119
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,960
has produced a golden phoenix.

120
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,758
Nuan Nuan, you acted in such a big production movie...

121
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:40,360
with an international superstar.

122
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,119
You're the pride of our small fishing village...

123
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,600
and our theater troupe.

124
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:44,679
That's right.

125
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,719
Nuan Nuan, you can't be too focused on work...

126
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,360
and delay your marriage.

127
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:51,759
Jiang Fang is too wild.

128
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,840
He won't do.

129
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,840
Nuan Nuan...

130
00:13:53,841 --> 00:13:55,558
has to find someone who cares about her, right?

131
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:56,600
That's right.

132
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:59,439
Nuan Nuan, did you meet anyone...

133
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,159
that you like out there?

134
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,799
I have something to say on that matter.

135
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:05,279
There really is one...

136
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,919
- It's nothing.
- Eat up. Don't listen to him.

137
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,480
What nonsense are you talking about?

138
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:16,919
Let's eat.

139
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:22,278
Why won't you tell them about you and Fei Mo?

140
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:23,279
What are you afraid of?

141
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,960
Isn't it good to let them be happy?

142
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,039
We're not in that kind of relationship.

143
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,278
Stop talking nonsense.

144
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:29,398
What if everyone believes you?

145
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:30,558
We didn't get together.

146
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:32,239
Everyone will be worried about me again.

147
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,519
Look at you.

148
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:36,519
Why didn't Fei Mo come back with you this time?

149
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,039
- Did you two fight?
- I don't want to talk about it.

150
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,759
At this time,

151
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,240
my career just started.

152
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,879
I don't have the mood to date.

153
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,999
Besides, I just hope...

154
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,439
for everyone to be healthy...

155
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,440
and for our troupe to do well.

156
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,919
- I don't think about anything else. - All right.

157
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,759
Come on.

158
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,038
- Come on, let's toast. - Come on.

159
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:00,200
- Cheers. - Cheers.

160
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:14,759
(Ye Fei Mo)

161
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,759
(Wen Xiao Nuan)

162
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,200
(Ye Fei Mo)

163
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,410
Ling Er.

164
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,650
I'm here to see how you're recovering.

165
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:30,200
Can you be discharged already?

166
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,440
The doctor said...

167
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,359
I can be discharged...

168
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,680
after two more days of observation.

169
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:49,890
Jiang Fang.

170
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:53,170
I'm sorry.

171
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:54,920
I messed everything up.

172
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,480
It's not your fault.

173
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,240
Love is meant to be between two people.

174
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,359
I didn't...

175
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,759
pay enough attention to you.

176
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,039
I didn't care about you enough.

177
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:09,650
I even caused you...

178
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,650
to suffer a lot.

179
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,920
I don't blame you.

180
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:18,839
I forced myself to keep you by my side.

181
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:21,960
We've come so far.

182
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,240
But I don't know what I'm after anymore.

183
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,200
Me neither.

184
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,759
We were both blinded...

185
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,920
by what we were after.

186
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:47,680
After I'm out of the hospital,

187
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,319
I'm going to find someone.

188
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:53,599
Wen Xiao Nuan, right?

189
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:58,200
It's...

190
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,759
the long-lost Jiang Fang.

191
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,960
Jiang Fang.

192
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,240
I begged for this ring.

193
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:32,279
I'm returning it to you now.

194
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:41,799
I also want to find...

195
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:43,680
the lost me.

196
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,319
Jiang Fang, I'll be fine.

197
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,759
Don't worry about me.

198
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:10,519
It's okay, Ling Er.

199
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,279
From now on,

200
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,839
if you need my help...

201
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:15,960
with anything,

202
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,319
just let me know.

203
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,279
I'll do my best to help.

204
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:24,890
Jiang Fang.

205
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,920
There's something I should tell you.

206
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:34,410
Wen Xiao Nuan and Ye Fei Mo have broken up.

207
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:35,799
They broke up?

208
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:39,920
If you still like her,

209
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:41,680
go get her back.

210
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,720
Ye Fei Mo?

211
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,680
Don't you like her?

212
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:21,119
Why did you leave her? Why did you hurt her?

213
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:27,170
It's none of your business.

214
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:34,119
It's me.

215
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:35,599
Is Ye Fei Mo sick?

216
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,519
It's said that he fainted on the street...

217
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:39,960
and was sent to the hospital.

218
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:42,240
We're still waiting for further updates.

219
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,240
What's the situation at Anning?

220
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,680
Mr. Jiang.

221
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:47,278
Ye Fei Mo is the backbone of Anning.

222
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:49,240
This kind of news must be kept under wraps.

223
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:50,680
The outside world knows nothing about it.

224
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:52,598
Okay, I got it.

225
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:54,200
Report to me if anything happens.

226
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:55,640
Okay, Mr. Jiang.

227
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:26,079
You're sick.

228
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:34,160
Ye Fei Mo.

229
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,640
It's only now...

230
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:41,160
that I can truly let go of my prejudice against you.

231
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:44,759
Fortunately, this hospitalization...

232
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:47,799
has given me time...

233
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,039
to reflect on what I've done recently.

234
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:56,920
You seem to have learned a lot.

235
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,000
Yes.

236
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,160
I've learned a lot.

237
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,839
In order to pursue the success I thought I had,

238
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,079
I made a lot of mistakes,

239
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,880
including clinging to Jiang Ling Er...

240
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,720
and Aurora Film.

241
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,160
I obtained...

242
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:18,799
those meaningless titles...

243
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:20,759
and wealth.

244
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:23,640
Unfortunately, I hurt Nuan Nuan's feelings.

245
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Even though I still don't like you,

246
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,720
I know in my heart...

247
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,480
that it's jealousy.

248
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,559
You deserve her more than I do.

249
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:38,000
Because what you can give her...

250
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,640
is endless tolerance and support.

251
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,039
So I hope...

252
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,000
she can be happy.

253
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,720
And I hope you won't abandon her.

254
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:54,079
Thank you for your best wishes.

255
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,960
But...

256
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,279
But I've already broken up with Nuan Nuan.

257
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,240
I no longer have the right to make her happy.

258
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:15,160
I really,

259
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,799
really,

260
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,200
really want to cherish her.

261
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:25,039
But...

262
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,839
But I have stomach cancer.

263
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:38,559
I don't even know how much longer I can live.

264
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,799
I can't bear to leave her alone...

265
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:46,319
after I die.

266
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,039
I don't want her to take on the suffering alone.

267
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,279
So...

268
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,039
I'd rather she hates me...

269
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,160
and leaves me.

270
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,440
At least,

271
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:03,000
it'll be easier for her to get over it...

272
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,880
and find happiness again.

273
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:08,200
That's just your one-sided thinking.

274
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:09,839
You're selfish.

275
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,279
Selfish?

276
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:16,640
How am I selfish?

277
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:19,720
Who are you to say I'm selfish?

278
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,640
Because you and I are the same.

279
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,880
We both use our own values...

280
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,319
to limit Wen Xiao Nuan's feelings.

281
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:29,759
I'm just using my own way...

282
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,440
to protect Nuan Nuan.

283
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,598
What's wrong with that?

284
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:34,879
Listen. For two people who truly love each other,

285
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,359
compared to separation and death,

286
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,440
abandonment is the most painful.

287
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,960
Because she was abandoned by the person she loves.

288
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,279
Not because of anything else.

289
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:57,839
I just don't want her...

290
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:00,559
to get hurt in any way.

291
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:03,599
You're hurting her right now.

292
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,359
What she wants is very simple.

293
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:08,798
She just wants to be together,

294
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,240
sharing the joys and sorrows.

295
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:12,960
Think about it.

296
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:33,839
Ms. Han.

297
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,279
Mr. Jiang.

298
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:38,839
It has been a while.

299
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,000
You got discharged so soon.

300
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:43,079
Thank you for your concern.

301
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,720
I'm here...

302
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:46,319
to say goodbye.

303
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,119
I'm leaving Aurora Film.

304
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,240
Your cooperation with the company...

305
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,559
will be handled by the new manager.

306
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,558
Don't worry.

307
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,640
I'll make all the arrangements before I leave.

308
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,400
You're leaving Aurora Film?

309
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,359
I thought...

310
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,480
we were allies.

311
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:11,599
Mr. Jiang.

312
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,679
You know, I signed with Aurora Film...

313
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,880
because I thought...

314
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,519
we were the same kind of people.

315
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,839
We could reach a better consensus.

316
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,279
You're right.

317
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:23,160
We are the same kind of people.

318
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:24,920
We both...

319
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,240
gave up on love...

320
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,039
for money.

321
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,799
But I regret it now.

322
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,240
I finally understand.

323
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:37,880
Once you've made your choice,

324
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:40,160
everything...

325
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,920
will be irreversible.

326
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,960
Ms. Han, good luck.

327
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,039
Is that so?

328
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,079
Take care, Ms. Han.

329
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,799
I'll get going now.
