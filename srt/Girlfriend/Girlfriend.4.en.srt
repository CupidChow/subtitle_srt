1
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,120
Mr. Ye, come down for breakfast.

2
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:49,560
Are you having breakfast?

3
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,519
There you are.

4
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:01,319
Let's have the meeting first.

5
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,680
The nurse.

6
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,640
We've met before.

7
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,159
Stop chatting. Come down.

8
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,159
Have we?

9
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:20,400
What's wrong with Ye Fei Mo today?

10
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,280
Do I not look good?

11
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,319
I look good.

12
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,120
What do you think?

13
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:32,240
Are you getting along with 5203?

14
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:36,639
Cut the crap.

15
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,599
Thank you.

16
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,439
I'm sorry.

17
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,800
I'm sorry.

18
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,280
I'm sorry.

19
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,439
Go away.

20
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,039
Get out.

21
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,280
I'm going to get changed.

22
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:38,199
It looks like having a nurse...

23
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,639
has made your life more colorful.

24
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:41,879
Cut the crap.

25
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,879
Is there anything going on in the company lately?

26
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,960
Not really.

27
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:47,759
Then bear in mind...

28
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,719
our current relationship.

29
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,080
When I'm not in the office,

30
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,560
they'll keep an eye on you.

31
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,119
You have to be careful.

32
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,280
Don't let them find out.

33
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:57,400
Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.

34
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,599
Remember.

35
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,000
Don't let them find out...

36
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,400
about our relationship.

37
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:04,879
I know.

38
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,599
- Bye. - Bye.

39
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,050
This nurse has been staying here for a long time.

40
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,959
She's a pain.

41
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:30,279
Don't you know that girls nowadays...

42
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:32,399
have a rebellious mentality?

43
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,609
The more you reject her,

44
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,319
the more she'll think you're interested in her.

45
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,959
If you really want to reject her,

46
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,079
just give her a scare.

47
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,000
Let me tell you.

48
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,049
No wonder he doesn't feel a thing...

when a fairy is in front of him.

50
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:09,560
I'll leave the sweeping to you today.

51
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,730
I have more important things to think about.

53
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,120

00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,758
Okay, thank you.

Are you scared?

77
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,639
Since you're scared,

78
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,960
get lost.

79
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:01,919
Okay.

let's have a video conference.

82
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,639
I have to have a big project.

83
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,279
That way, I'll have a firm foothold in Aurora.

84
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,278
But Mr. Jiang...

85
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,759
won't allow me to work on any core projects.

86
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:27,759
It looks like I have to take the initiative.

89
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,518
Fei Mo, the market closed this morning...

90
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,839
with our stock down by 2.5 points.

91
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,119
I think someone is deliberately driving down...

92
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,210
Anning's stock price.

93
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,518
But don't worry.

94
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:02,158
I'll bring it back up during the noon market.

95
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:03,759
It shouldn't be a problem.

96
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,329
If they are driving down the stock price,

97
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,399
that means they took the bait.

98
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:10,918
Should I spread the good news?

99
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:11,919
No.

100
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,679
Let's wait and see.

101
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,559
By the way, there's one more thing.

102
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,918
Aurora's new production director...

103
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:19,038
suddenly came to see me.

104
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:21,600
He wants to talk about "Blue Galaxy".

105
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,639
The new production director?

106
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:26,399
We've only worked with Aurora...

107
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:28,919
on theater chains in the past.

108
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,119
His name is Jiang Fang. He's quite young.

109
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,159
He doesn't have much experience.

110
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,719
I think he's not familiar...

111
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,000
with Aurora and Anning's past.

112
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:39,239
He wants to achieve something on his own.

113
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,240
That's why he suddenly came to us.

114
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:43,159
Young and inexperienced?

115
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:45,450
How did he become the production director?

116
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:47,120
Don't judge him by his age.

117
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:49,639
He's Ms. Jiang's fiancé.

118

The future son-in-law of Aurora.

119
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,799
Why did you lie to me?

120
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,638
Why are you going out...

121
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:56,878
with Jiang Ling Er from Aurora?

122
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:58,319
Why, Jiang Fang?

123
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,600
Say whatever you want.

124
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:01,840
I've got everything I want now.

125
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,320
So it's him.

126
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:06,320
What? Do you know him?

127
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:09,039
Let him talk to me directly.

128
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,759
Do you want to let Aurora in?

129
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:14,759
"Blue Galaxy" is our key project.

130
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,440
Why should we share it with him?

131
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:17,639
I want to meet him.

132
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,759
Tell him to call me in 10 minutes.

133
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:22,200
I won't answer if he's late.

134
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,639
Okay, got it.

135
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,440
Hello, Mr. Ye.

136
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:52,839
I'm Jiang Fang, Aurora's new production director.

137
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,600
I didn't expect to be able to talk to you directly.

138
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:56,120
I'm honored.

139
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,080
You want to join "Blue Galaxy".

140
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,600
I'll give you two minutes...

141
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,480
to impress me.

142
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,320
Mr. Ye, two minutes might be a bit rushed.

143

Regarding this project,

144
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:10,359
I have a lot of ideas and thoughts.

145
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,360
I think we can...

146
00:12:11,361 --> 00:12:12,480
Thirty seconds have passed.

147
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,398
Mr. Ye, I think you know...

148
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:18,480
Aurora's capabilities.

149
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,959
We have our own theater chain.

150
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,199
If we work together...

151
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,200
We've worked together on
theater chains over the years.

152
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,599
You don't have to tell me that.

153
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,720
You just need to tell me...

154
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:27,558
what your core competence is...

155
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:28,879
in production.

156
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:31,440
That will determine whether I work with you or not.

157
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:34,839
Mr. Ye, should we...

158
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,200
meet up in person?

159
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:37,599
Let's sit down and talk.

Here's the thing.

00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:05,079
In terms of production resources,

166
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,159
you can't help me in any way.

167
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:09,519
But if you really want to join,

168
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,639
I'll welcome you.

169
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,000
I can give you five percent of the shares.

170
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,679
at a 200 percent premium.

171
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:16,600
If you accept it, we'll work together.

172

173
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,600
you're belittling me.

00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,600
Come here.

175
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:35,959
Mr. Ye, why did you want to see me?

176
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,038
Come here.

177
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:38,039
Wen Xiao Nuan.

178
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,360
Come here.

179
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,519
Sit closer.

180
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,559
Wen Xiao Nuan!

181
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,080
Sit closer.

182
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,039
I just want to tell you.

183
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:02,360
You've been so tired lately.

184
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:03,960
Remember to rest.

185
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,600
Wen Xiao Nuan!

186
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,879
Mr. Ye, what's wrong?

187
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:13,120
There's sand in my eyes.

188
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:14,720
Let me blow it out for you.

189
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,279
Wen Xiao Nuan!

190
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,360
Wen...

191
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,559
This Wen Xiao Nuan.

192
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:35,240
What does she want to do?

193
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,799
Okay, you can go now. You can stop blowing.

194
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,879
Go.

195
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,519
Mr. Ye, what's wrong?

196
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,199
There's sand in my eyes.

197
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,200
Let me blow it out for you.

198
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,960
Mr. Lin, there you are.

199
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,119
Vice president of Aurora, Jiang Fang.

200
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,758
Yes, Ms. Ling Er's fiancé.

201
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:55,799
Nice to meet you.

202
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:00,439
I didn't expect Mr. Jiang...

203
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,960
to have such a major figure...

204
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,799
in Anning.

205
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,960
I really admire him.

206
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,199
Mr. Jiang asked me to see you.

207
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,840
That means you already have his trust.

208
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,519
I still have a lot to learn from you.

209
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,919
I hope you will teach me.

210
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,119
You're too kind.

211
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,080
You're young and talented with a bright future ahead of you.

212
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:21,879
Anning is the top film company in China.

213
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:23,840
It has always been Aurora's rival.

214
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,639
If we don't get rid of Anning,

215
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,679
Aurora will always be in second place.

216
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:35,918
Mr. Lin, I will be needing your help a lot...

217
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:36,919
in the future.

218
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,199
Mr. Jiang, if you need anything,

219
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,200
just let me know.

220
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,519
I heard that there was recently a girl...

221
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:56,879
at Ye Fei Mo's house.

222
00:16:57,639 --> 00:16:58,679
Do you know anything about that?

223
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,480
A girl?

224
00:17:00,481 --> 00:17:01,519
Yes.

225
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:04,720
Ye Fei Mo never lets girls into his house.

226
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,960
So...

227
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,838
I would like you to investigate this for me.

228
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,279
Don't worry, Mr. Jiang.

229
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,519
Leave it to me.

230
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,079
- Here's to our collaboration.
- Here's to our collaboration.

231
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,240
Mr. Gu.

232
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,039
Does this need Fei Mo's signature?

233
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,239
Then leave this document here.

234
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,680
I'll bring it to him when I'm free.

235
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,679
Mr. Gu, this is urgent.

236
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,720
If you're busy,

237
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:47,960
why don't I go there?

238
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:51,559
Okay.

239
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:53,599
Then I'll have to trouble you.

240
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,079
Hi, Fei Mo.

241
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,200
Lin Zheng is on his way to you.

242
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:12,240
He hasn't heard from me for so long.

243
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:13,680
He can't wait anymore.

244
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,170
That's why it's showtime.

245
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:22,170
Fei Mo, I have a call.

246
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,170
I have to go.

247
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,359
Hello. Did you find out?

248
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,920
Wang Jia Yi?

249
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,559
Aurora's artist?

250
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,759
She even won the Gold Medal Award for Best Newcomer?

251
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:46,920
How come I've never heard of her?

252
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,518
Well, if she makes any moves,

253
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:51,599
report it to me immediately.

254
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:07,170
Hello.

255
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:15,650
Hello. Who are you?

256
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,319
I'm Mr. Ye's assistant.

257
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:19,650
And you are?

258
00:19:19,651 --> 00:19:21,079
I'm his personal nurse.

259
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,410
Personal nurse?

260
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:28,039
Do you have an appointment with him?

261
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,000
- Then come with me. - Okay.

262
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:44,440
Mr. Ye.

263
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,480
Why did you come back together?

264
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,319
We met at the door.

265
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,890
You two can talk. I'll go wash the vegetables.

266
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,240
Mr. Ye.

267
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,839
Mr. Ye, are you feeling better?

268
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:25,799
Nuan Nuan.

269
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,720
Come here.

270
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:33,960
Come here.

271
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:39,410
Come.

272
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,240
- What's wrong?
- Come here.

273
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,720
Come on.

274
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,650
Don't move. I'm ticklish.

275
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:56,440
Look at you. You're sweating.

276
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:57,890
Are you exhausted?

277
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,480
I feel so bad for you.

278
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,959
Mr. Ye, do you need anything else?

279
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,440
If there's nothing else,

280
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,119
I'll go back to the office to return the documents.

281
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,999
It's so hot today. Have some water before you go.

282
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,319
It's okay. Thank you.

283
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,480
Go and cook.

284
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:56,359
Hello.

285
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,480
Ye Fei Mo and Wen Xiao Nuan are very flirty with each other.

286
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:02,519
I saw them hugging just now.

287
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,279
Ye Fei Mo and Wen Xiao Nuan are flirting?

288
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:06,680
Yes.

289
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,558
Now Ye Fei Mo has a 24-hour companion.

290
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:11,720
This is quite disadvantageous to us.

291
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:13,799
It'll be hard for us...

292
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,559
to get close to Ye Fei Mo.

293
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,838
Not necessarily.

294
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:19,720
Perhaps she can be our way in.

295
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,119
Do you mean...

296
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,279
Don't worry about Wen Xiao Nuan. I'll handle it.

297
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:43,720
Hi. Look into someone for me.

298
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,999
Wen Xiao Nuan.

299
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,519
What's going on with her lately?

300
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,880
Mr. Ye, dinner is ready.

301
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:51,559
Try it.

302
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:53,118
This is my specialty.

303
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:54,359
My dad taught me everything.

304
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,680
It should taste better than the flashy dishes you ordered.

305
00:23:58,039 --> 00:23:59,079
Try it.

306
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,200
How is it?

307
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:15,119
It's bad.

308
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:16,599
Make something else.

309
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,359
Where's my food?

310
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:09,359
I tossed it.

311
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:11,440
You tossed it?

312
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:13,319
It tastes so bad.

313
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,480
Why keep it?

314
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,559
I can eat it if you won't.

315
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,519
It's such a waste if you throw it away.

316
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:49,680
(Big Princess)

317
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,119
Ye Fei Mo?

318
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,640
He's clearly a three-year-old.

319
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,240
(Big Princess)

320
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:06,079
Hello?

321
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:07,839
Sorry, I dialed the wrong number.

322
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,079
Hello?

323
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,680
Sorry, I didn't dial the wrong number.

324
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,720
I'm looking for Fei Mo.

325
00:26:23,721 --> 00:26:24,759
He's not here.

326
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,519
He's here. He's taking a shower.

327
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,160
Did you two have a fight?

328
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:34,160
That's how our Fei Mo is.

329
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,440
Please understand.

330
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:38,960
Your Fei Mo?

331
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:41,559
Which girlfriend of his are you?

332
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,759
The first one.

333
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:47,079
The first one?

334
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:48,920
First love, miss?

335
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,038
But I think...

336
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,519
you were blinded by first love.

337
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,240
He's rude and uncultured.

338
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,960
He's sharp-tongued, narcissistic, and twisted.

339
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,440
Why would you fall for him?

340
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,758
Let me tell you.

341
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:02,038
When you're looking for a partner,

342
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:03,880
you should be wiser, really.

343
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:12,479
I'm sorry. Am I talking too much?

344
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,558
No.

345
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:15,920
I totally agree with you.

346
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,279
Thank you.

347
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:21,119
I had a great time chatting with you.

348
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:22,839
I really look forward to seeing you.

349
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:24,200
I'm hanging up.

350
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:27,519
Weren't you looking for Ye Fei Mo?

351
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,480
Why did you hang up just like that?

352
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:34,319
I'm rude and uncultured.

353
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,799
I'm sharp-tongued, narcissistic, and twisted.

354
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,319
What did you say about me?

355
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,960
Say it again.

356
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,960
Are you stupid?

357
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,480
Why would you want to hear criticisms about you again?

358
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:01,119
Wen Xiao Nuan.

359
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:02,599
Don't come near me.

360
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,599
If you do, I'll throw an apple at you.

361
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:06,839
You answered the phone
when you didn't know who it was.

362
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,400
Isn't she your first ex-girlfriend?

363
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:11,119
I think she's quite nice.

364
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,199
She's nicer than you.

365
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,880
I saw that you were sick,
so I kindly took you in.

366
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,599
You're not only interfering with my life,

367
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:17,079
you're even invading my privacy.

368
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:19,799
You have to leave.

369
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,240
You have to leave now!

370
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:22,598
I'm sorry, Mr. Ye.

371
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:24,318
Please forgive me. I won't do this again.

372
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:25,758
I won't answer your calls again.

373
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:26,759
You have to leave.

374
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
You...

375
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I'm not leaving.

376
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,680
The door is right there.

377
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:31,759
Leave right now!

378
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,038
I'm not leaving!

379
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,079
I'm not leaving!

380
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:40,599
What's wrong with you?
