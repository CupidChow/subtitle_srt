1
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:00,920
Take a photo of this.

2
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,480
What's going on with Mr. Ye?

3
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:07,359
I was only away for a while.

4
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,439
You got yourself into such a mess.

5
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,840
Are you hurt?

6
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,370
He kissed her!

7
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,280
Don't worry about what others think.

8
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,370
Who cares?

9
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,560
How manly!

10
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:44,680
Wen Xiao Nuan, I have faith in you.

11
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,120
Remember to contact me.

12
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:09,240
Why did you kiss me?

13
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,520
I kissed my fiancée.

14
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,759
What's wrong with that?

15
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,638
Ye Fei Mo, who's your fiancée?

16
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:18,199
I'm helping you out.

17
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,120
You're being ungrateful.

18
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,680
Thank you.

19
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,800
Get changed.

20
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:49,000
Be mindful of your words and actions.

21
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,560
Don't embarrass Anning.

22
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,400
Ye Fei Mo!

23
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,120
Nuan Nuan.

24
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,729
I heard you fell into the water.

25
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,050
I had someone make ginger tea.

26
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:30,800
Drink it.

27
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:32,170
Don't catch a cold.

28
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,279
Take it away. I don't want it.

29
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:36,480
Nuan Nuan, you...

30
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,959
Do you hate me that much now?

31
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:45,519
Nuan Nuan, look at me.

32
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:53,120
You gave me this brooch.

33
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,480
I'm wearing it now.

34
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:03,959
Since I've given it to you,

35
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:05,439
what you do with it...

36
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:06,519
is your business.

37
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,519
Nuan Nuan.

38
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,000
This brooch really suits me.

39
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:17,480
Because you know me best.

40
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:21,360
Nuan Nuan, how are you doing?

41
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:26,639
Leave Ye Fei Mo.

42
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,319
He'll hurt you.

43
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,040
Mr. Jiang,

44
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,720
I'll be the one who gets hurt.

45
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,279
You don't have to worry.

46
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,600
Besides,

47
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,199
Ye Fei Mo is not like you.

48
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:42,439
Nuan Nuan,

49
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,999
I've seen too many rich people...

50
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,319
like Ye Fei Mo.

51
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,800
They don't care about love at all.

52
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,078
Once he gets bored, he'll move on.

53
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:51,160
What about you?

54
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,560
You can't afford it.

55
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,199
Nuan Nuan, come to your senses.

56
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:56,240
Don't be fooled by him, okay?

57
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,040
Mr. Jiang, you've been talking to my fiancée.

58
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:20,199
I wonder how Ms. Jiang will feel...

59
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,160
if she were to find out.

60
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,240
Ye Fei Mo, thank you.

61
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,879
Do you like talking to your ex-boyfriend that much?

62
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,719
He came to me.

63
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,519
- He and I... - You don't have to tell me.

64
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,079
I don't want to know.

65
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:54,839
I just want to remind you.

66
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,879
Don't forget how he treated you.

67
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:58,800
Don't humiliate yourself.

68
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,679
Who's humiliating themself?

69
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,799
Let's make this clear.

70
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,839
Isn't it true?

71
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,560
Then why does he have the brooch?

72
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,439
Didn't you give it to him?

73
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,600
Yes, I gave him the brooch.

74
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,800
But that's because...

75
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,519
Wait.

76
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,199
Why am I explaining to you?

77
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:22,799
The brooch is mine.

78
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,560
I can give it to whomever I want.

79
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,879
Do you want to go back to him?

80
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,199
Do you want to get back together with him?

81
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,680
Don't forget.

82
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,360
He has a girlfriend now.

83
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,600
Don't interfere in his relationship.

84
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,480
Is that what you think of me?

85
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,600
Yes.

86
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,360
I do want to get back together with him.

87
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,720
I do still love him.

88
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,680
Whether he has a girlfriend
or not, I still love him.

89
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:47,759
All right?

90
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,240
Hello, Mr. Ye.

91
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,680
It has been a while.

92
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:56,160
Thank you for last time.

93
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,480
Mr. Ye, I'll let you get back to it.

94
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,800
Let's continue working together
if the chance arises, okay?

95
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:50,720
Do you know who Mr. Xu is?

96
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,038
He's the heir of Shengtian Media.

97
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:55,638
You've offended him.

98
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:57,720
Do you still want to be in showbiz?

99
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,000
He harassed me first.

100
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,398
Now that you've offended him,

101
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:05,799
how can we work with Shengtian in the future?

102
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:07,090
Wang Jia Yi,

103
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:10,330
please know your position, okay?

104
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,878
You can't offend just anyone.

105
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:15,879
I really want to strangle you to death.

106
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,240
Mr. Xu.

107
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,039
Mr. Xu,

108
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,210
our artist doesn't know any better.

109
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,919
She offended you earlier.

110
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,089
But she regretted it a lot,

111
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:39,720
so she came to apologize to you.

112
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,210
Go.

113
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,090
Ms. Wang,

114
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,090
how are you going to apologize?

115
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:51,039
I didn't do anything wrong.

116
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,120
Why should I apologize?

117
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,240
Jia Yi,

118
00:09:57,241 --> 00:09:58,360
what did we just say?

119
00:09:58,519 --> 00:09:59,720
Apologize to Mr. Xu at once.

120
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,330
There's no need for that.

121
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,879
Ms. Jia Yi, how about this?

122
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,398
Let's find a nice place...

123
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,399
and have a good talk.

124
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:13,879
What do you mean by this?

125
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,518
She might be a bit...

126
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,879
You harassed me first.

127
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:17,960
Why should I apologize?

128
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:22,720
- Mr. Xu, she is just... - Okay.

129
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,279
You just wait.

130
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,210
Mr. Xu.

131
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:30,679
Mr. Xu, let me explain.

132
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:31,839
Mr. Xu!

133
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,278
Mr. Xu, it's not like that!

134
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,360
Mr. Xu!

135
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,159
Wang Jia Yi!

136
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:41,879
Do you think you're all that now?

137
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,090
I can't control you anymore, can I?

138
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,210
Fine, I don't care!

139
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:51,559
Don't follow me!

140
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:53,638
Drive!

141
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:55,158
Simon!

142
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:56,159
Si...

143
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:58,559
Simon!

144
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,879
(Waitlist for rush hour ride, No. 101 out of 129)

145
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,599
Hello, the number you have dialed is unavailable.

146
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,639
Sorry.

147
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,959
(Where are you?)

148
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,000
(Message sent but was rejected by the receiver)

149
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,519
(Where are you?)

150
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:15,840
Hello.

151
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,799
It's hard to get a taxi here.

152
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,320
Why don't I give you a ride?

153
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:24,120
Do you know me?

154
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,158
I'm Director Li's driver.

155
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,600
We met at the banquet.

156
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,799
Hello, Director Li.

157
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,159
No wonder you look familiar.

158
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,518
Yes.

159
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,519
Director Li was afraid you would be in danger,

160
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,320
so he asked me to pick you up.

161
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:43,679
Thank you, Director Li.

162
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:45,840
Let's go, then.

163
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:47,200
Okay.

164
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,000
Ms. Wang.

165
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,600
Have some water.

166
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:14,799
Thank you.

167
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:27,839
I'm sorry.

168
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,840
What are you doing?

169
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,240
Who are you?

170
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,759
I...

171
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,759
I'm Director Li Can's driver.

172
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:37,799
What's wrong, Ms. Wang?

173
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,120
I remember now.

174
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,159
You were a waiter at the banquet, right?

175
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,960
You followed me around at the banquet hall.

176
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,719
Now you've tricked me into getting in the car.

177
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,799
What are you trying to do?

178
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:48,519
No, Ms. Wang.

179
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,638
Let me explain.

180
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:50,719
- What are you doing? - Don't.

181
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,919
What are you doing?

182
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,279
Open the door. Hurry up and open the door!

183
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,518
If you don't open the door, I'll call the police!

184
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:02,799
I am a waiter at the hotel.

185
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,170
But I'm also Director Li Can's driver.

186
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,920
What?

187
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:11,839
I'm an orphan.

188
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,519
I grew up in an orphanage.

189
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:17,889
I want to make more money,

190
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,650
so I work several part-time jobs every day.

191
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,170
I'm a waiter at banquets...

192
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,039
and a driver-for-hire.

193
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:25,838
Today,

194
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,519
Director Li got drunk but didn't bring his chauffeur.

195
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,650
So he hired me to take him home.

196
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,240
If you don't believe me,

197
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:33,410
you can ask Director Li.

198
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:39,410
Director Li,

199
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,440
say something.

200
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:44,680
That's right.

201
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,519
I hired Xiao Gu.

202
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:48,480
I asked him to give you a ride.

203
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,079
I saw you...

204
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:53,519
trying to flag a cab by the roadside.

205
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,039
I just wanted to give you a ride.

206
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,519
I didn't expect...

207
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:00,079
that you would consider me a bad person.

208
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,319
I'm sorry.

209
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,079
I'm being paranoid.

210
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,890
How about...

211
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,359
I give you a red packet?

212
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:10,000
Consider it the ride fare, okay?

213
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,650
Add me on WeChat, then.

214
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,240
Okay.

215
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Done.

216
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:09,680
I was abandoned at the manor's entrance.

217
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:11,039
I can't get a cab now.

218
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,960
(Wen Xiao Nuan)

219
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:22,359
(Wen Xiao Nuan)

220
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,319
Jia Yi, where are you?

221
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:29,720
Why aren't you picking up?

222
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,799
Nuan Nuan, I'm fine.

223
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,279
I got a ride now.

224
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:43,119
Is your ride safe?

225
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:44,559
It's so late.

226
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,960
Don't get on an unlicensed ride.

227
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,239
Don't worry.

228
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,650
I'm in Director Li Can's car.

229
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,959
I'm heading back now.

230
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,079
I'll be there in half an hour.

231
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:54,319
Thank you.

232
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,439
Get some rest. Bye.

233
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,519
Bye.

234
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,240
Nuan Nuan.

235
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:07,680
Why are you out here?

236
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,598
Jia Yi, what took you so long?

237
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:10,680
I was so worried.

238
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:14,559
What are you looking at?

239
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,410
I'm looking...

240
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:18,838
at your driver.

241
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:19,959
Why does he look so familiar?

242
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,239
Of course he looks familiar.

243
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,559
He was a waiter at the banquet.

244
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,410
If it weren't for him and Director Li,

245
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,410
I wouldn't know how to get home.

246
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:29,318
Your company is too outrageous.

247
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:30,799
How could they leave you on the street at this hour?

248
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
All right, let's go.

249
00:21:32,001 --> 00:21:33,480
I've prepared a room for you.

250
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:34,839
You're finally moving back in.

251
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:36,359
I have someone to keep me company.

252
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,240
Nuan Nuan.

253
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,680
Did Mr. Ye give you Rose's Tear?

254
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,640
No.

255
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,640
He...

256
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,480
He only lent it to me to wear.

257
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:01,519
I'll put it away.

258
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:05,960
I left in a hurry.

259
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,119
I'll have to ask Xiao Jing to give it back to him.

260
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,839
So you're not going to see him?

261
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,880
Our contractual relationship...

262
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,799
ends tonight.

263
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:18,959
I'll get paid...

264
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,079
and save the troupe.

265
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,720
And...

266
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,440
he said himself that we're even now.

267
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:27,079
I just want to take things one step at a time...

268
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,880
and get my life back on track.

269
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,279
I'm not asking about the contract.

270
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,038
I'm asking...

271
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,319
if you'll see him again.

272
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:43,839
Do you still...

273
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:45,640
have Jiang Fang in your heart?

274
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,680
To me,

275
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,358
Jiang Fang is a thing of the past.

276
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:50,359
Look.

277
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,680
You don't avoid the question
when I ask you about Jiang Fang.

278
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:54,079
When I mention Ye Fei Mo,

279
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,519
you won't give me a straight answer.

280
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,160
What do you really think?

281
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,680
He and I...

282
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:09,079
are just acting according to the script.

283
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,000
How can I follow my heart?

284
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,480
Although...

285
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,839
I'm touched sometimes,

286
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,159
that's because I'm in character.

287
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,400
What about Ye Fei Mo?

288
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,680
Is he just in character too?

289
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:27,839
I don't know about that.

290
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:29,839
All right.

291
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,000
Don't think about it.

292
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:32,359
Let's put away your things.

293
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:38,319
Here.

294
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:47,000
(Wen Xiao Nuan)

295
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,480
(Wen Xiao Nuan)

296
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:18,799
(When should I give the necklace back to you?)

297
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,000
It feels like...

298
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:22,400
I'm looking for an excuse to see him.

299
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:24,559
No.

300
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:31,399
(I'll leave the necklace at your front desk.)

301
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,839
It's not safe at the front desk.

302
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,200
No.

303
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:42,160
(Send someone to fetch the necklace from me.)

304
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:43,640
If he comes in person,

305
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,119
wouldn't it be awkward for me?

306
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:49,160
Forget it.

307
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,880
What should I do?

308
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,079
What should I do?

309
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,480
Yes.

310
00:25:15,481 --> 00:25:17,079
I do want to get back together with him.

311
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:18,399
I do still love him.

312
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,200
Whether he has a girlfriend or not, I still love him.

313
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,759
All right?

314
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,240
How dare you touch my fiancée?

315
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,000
You want to retire early, don't you?

316
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:55,960
This is my fiancée,

317
00:25:57,319 --> 00:25:58,319
Wen Xiao Nuan.

318
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:15,558
(Ms. Han, it was Aurora's honor to host your homecoming party.)

319
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:17,680
(Get some rest. Let's meet sometime to discuss "Blue Galaxy".)

320
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:35,558
Thank you...

321
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:37,200
for fulfilling our agreement.

322
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:38,720
On behalf of Ms. Cheng,

323
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,240
we now complete our end of the deal.

324
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,240
This is one million yuan.

325
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:46,599
Thank you, Xiao Jing.

326
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:47,599
You deserve it.

327
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:51,279
Xiao Nuan,

328
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,119
do you have any plans for your future?

329
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:57,039
No.

330
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,680
I think you're great overall.

331
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,119
If you're ready...

332
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:02,839
to become a professional actress,

333
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,079
you can contact me.

334
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,359
Thank you, Xiao Jing.

335
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:08,519
I don't plan to do that yet.

336
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,519
Xiao Jing, if there's nothing else, I'll get going.

337
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:21,160
Xiao Jing,

338
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,319
can you return this to Mr. Ye for me?

339
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:32,680
Do you know...

340
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:34,559
the significance of this necklace?

341
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:37,039
No.

342
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,720
It's very important to Mr. Ye.

343
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,960
To all of us,

344
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:44,038
only the mistress of Anning Culture...

345
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:45,200
has the right to wear it.

346
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:55,240
Are you going to return it?

347
00:27:57,799 --> 00:27:59,079
Mr. Ye lent me...

348
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,759
this necklace to wear...

349
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,200
to make him look good.

350
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,519
But I didn't know...

351
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,799
only the mistress of Anning Culture can wear it.

352
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,920
That's all the more reason to return it to Mr. Ye.

353
00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:11,079
After all,

354
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,559
our relationship is only contractual.

355
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:16,880
Are you sure...

356
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:20,559
your relationship with Mr. Ye is only contractual?

357
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:27,759
Mr. Ye is a good person.

358
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:29,880
Actually,

359
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:31,960
I've learned a lot from him.

360
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,240
Also,

361
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:36,440
Mr. Ye once said...

362
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:39,240
not to let your emotions get the best of you.

363
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,039
I really like this necklace,

364
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:45,319
but...

365
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:48,000
Cinderella has to return to reality eventually.

366
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:51,359
Okay.

367
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,518
On behalf of Anning,

368
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:53,880
I'll take this necklace back.

369
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,559
Xiao Jing, if there's nothing else,

370
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,880
I'll get going.

371
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,039
Bye, Xiao Jing.
