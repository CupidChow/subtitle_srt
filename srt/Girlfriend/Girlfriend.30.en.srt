00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,760
(Episode 30)

2
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,089
Mr. Ye, your mother has been waiting for you.

3
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,810
Ms. Wen, please.

4
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,840
Why are you holding my hand so tightly?

5
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,370
Are you nervous?

6
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,319
There's no need to be.

7
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,840
My mom is not a tigress.

8
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,400
Why are you holding it so tightly?

9
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:41,280
- I'm not. - You're so nervous.

10
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,120
Is that how you talk about your mom?

11
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,439
Aren't you afraid of being laughed at by Nuan Nuan?

12
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,719
Hello, Ms. Cheng.

13
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:51,919
That's not right.

14
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:53,840
Shouldn't you call me Auntie now?

15
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,520
Hello, Auntie.

16
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,719
That's more like it.

17
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:01,159
This is a small gift for you.

18
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,639
Thank you. Have a seat.

19
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,080
I heard from Ye Fei Mo...

20
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,400
that you like perfume,

21
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,240
so I specially made one for you at the perfume shop.

22
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,759
But I don't know if you'll like it.

23
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,000
The packaging is so pretty.

24
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,360
I'll accept it.

25
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:23,759
Ms. Cheng.

26
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,520
Your guest is here.

27
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,360
- Show her in. - Okay.

28
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:35,319
- Hello, Ms. Cheng. - Hello, you're here.

29
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,919
Okay, have a seat.

30
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:38,080
Thank you.

31
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,120
Take a look.

32
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,360
What's this?

33
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:54,159
I forgot to introduce you.

34
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,240
This is an international top wedding planner.

35
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:59,119
I've especially invited her...

36
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,840
to plan your wedding.

37
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:03,439
- Wedding? - Wedding?

38
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,240
You've already announced your relationship.

39
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:10,800
Of course you have to plan your wedding soon.

40
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,960
It's a big deal after all.

41
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,560
It's once in a lifetime.

42
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,759
You have to prepare it well, right?

43
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,560
Nuan Nuan.

44
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:21,759
What do you think?

45
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,480
It's a bit sudden.

46
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:28,319
I'm...

47
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,199
I'm not ready yet.

48
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,240
Is it because you haven't proposed to Nuan Nuan yet?

49
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:37,199
Of course I haven't, Mom.

50
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,920
She's such a nice girl. What are you waiting for?

51
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,360
To be single again?

52
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,079
Hurry up and propose to her.

53
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,170
What a loser.

54
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:52,519
Ms. Mu.

55
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,838
Take the planner with you...

56
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,730
to save the wedding planning documents.

57
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,800
Let them pick when they have time.

58
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,199
- Okay. - I'm sorry.

59
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,800
Please.

60
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,730
Okay. Let's eat first.

61
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,480
We'll talk at the table.

62
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,050
Come.

63
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:24,730
This is Mr. Liu Xin He's newest work.

64
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,639
It has two lead actresses. It's going to be a hit.

65
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:28,160
I've decided...

66
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,319
to let you produce it, Mr. Jiang.

67
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,079
Okay.

68
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:35,560
Don't worry. I'll do my best.

69
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,959
However,

70
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,800
I only have one condition.

71
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,920
Just name it.

72
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:46,480
I want Wen Xiao Nuan to play the other lead actress.

73
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:49,639
I'll leave this matter to you, Mr. Jiang.

74
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,759
You want Wen Xiao Nuan to play the role?

75
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,639
Is there a problem, Mr. Jiang?

76
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,719
Compared to you and other A-list actresses,

77
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,240
Wen Xiao Nuan's acting skills and popularity...

78
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,560
are no match.

79
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,360
Why do you want her to play the role?

80
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:11,800
I like this story.

81
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,000
It's of a substitute.

82
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,680
No matter how skilled she is,

83
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:19,839
she can't compete with the righteous.

84
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,279
I just want to get back what's mine.

85
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:30,920
Mr. Jiang.

86
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,759
If you get this movie,

87
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,479
your position in Aurora Film...

88
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,199
will be untouchable.

89
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:38,040
It all comes down to this.

90
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:40,959
Think carefully.

91
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,079
I only have one request.

92
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,480
Don't hurt Wen Xiao Nuan.

93
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:58,879
Don't worry, Mr. Jiang.

94
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:01,319
Our collaboration...

95
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,040
is mutually beneficial.

96
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:05,120
We both get what we want.

97
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:07,560
Okay.

98
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,759
Leave it to me.

99
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:21,480
Nuan Nuan, eat more.

100
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,720
Okay.

101
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:24,920
Mom.

102
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:26,959
You were never this nice to me.

103
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,040
It's not easy to find a girl who truly likes you.

104
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:34,119
Of course I have to be nice to her.

105
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,120
Right?

106
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:36,919
I don't want you to be single again...

107
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,240
right after you've started dating.

108
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,319
Am I adopted?

109
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,319
Nuan Nuan, let me tell you.

110
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,839
Fei Mo...

111
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,360
may have a bad temper,

112
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,360
but he has a good character.

113
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:52,240
As for his shortcomings,

114
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,078
I'm sure he has some.

115
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:56,000
For example, he's childish.

116
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,040
His nickname is Three-Year-Old Ye.

117
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:00,800
However, since you've fallen for him,

118
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,958
then you're my daughter-in-law now.

119
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,160
You can't run away.

120
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,759
I'm Three-Year-Old Ye with a bad temper.

121
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,639
Was that a question?

122
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,480
Nuan Nuan, I really like you.

123
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,079
Did you hear that?

124
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,560
You have to control your bad temper.

125
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,759
Listen.

126
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:22,879
With your attitude,

127
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:24,879
if you don't tell anyone that you're my son,

128
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,360
you'll surely get beaten up.

129
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,279
My appetite is gone.

130
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,519
Ignore him.

131
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,600
Listen, Nuan Nuan.

132
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:37,639
When Fei Mo was little,

133
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:39,159
when he was just born,

134
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:42,039
I really wanted to shove him back in and have him born again.

135
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,120
Do you know how annoying he was?

136
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:46,999
He was always expressionless as a kid.

137
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,450
He didn't cry or smile.

138
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,559
He just stared at me with his eyes...

139
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,450
as if he was so cool.

140
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,879
So annoying.

141
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:02,600
Hello. Are you Ms. Wang Jia Yi?

142
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,759
Hello. Who are you?

143
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,279
Hello, Ms. Wang.

144
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,359
I'm Mrs. Gu's secretary.

145
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,679
She would like to meet you.

146
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:11,330
Mrs. Gu?

147
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:15,399
You mean Yun Zhou's mom?

148
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,720
Yes, Ms. Wang.

149
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,519
Please come with me.

150
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,960
Be careful.

151
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:42,879
Mrs. Gu, this is Ms. Wang Jia Yi.

152
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,240
Ms. Wang.

153
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,799
Nice to meet you. Please have a seat.

154
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,039
Hello.

155
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,480
What did you want to see me for?

156
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,480
Ms. Wang.

157
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,879
You're a smart person.

158
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:01,399
I won't beat around the bush.

159
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,720
This time, I took the liberty of asking you out...

160
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,159
to discuss about Yun Zhou and Zhao Di.

161
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,879
The Gu and Zhao families are old friends.

162
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,159
Our families...

163
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,120
have long planned for them to get married.

164
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,759
Neither family wants anything to go wrong.

165
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:19,720
Ms. Wang.

166
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:21,159
You and Yun Zhou...

167
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,330
are from different worlds.

168
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,330
You're not compatible with each other.

169
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,360
I'll give you examples.

170
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,960
You can think about it.

171
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,879
To win you, Yun Zhou...

172
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,279
hasn't done something that he really likes in a long time.

173
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,759
He might be able to accommodate you for a day or two,

174
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:42,919
or even for a year or so.

175
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:46,039
Even if he's willing to do so for the rest of his life,

176
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,879
if you really love him,

177
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,519
can you really bear...

178
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,279
to let him accommodate you for the rest of his life?

179
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,519
I...

180
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,320
You're still young.

181
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:58,200
But I've had experience.

182
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,840
I understand better than you do.

183
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,519
When two people from different worlds get together,

184
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:04,279
they won't last long.

185
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,480
Ms. Wang.

186
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,639
Yun Zhou is a stubborn person.

187
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,320
But I believe...

188
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,000
that you'll make the right decision.

189
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,600
I'm going to the office to take care of something.

190
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:34,879
Where are you going?

191
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:36,960
I want to go home.

192
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,720
I'll get the driver to take you home.

193
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:39,919
I'll drive myself.

194
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:42,360
I'll have dinner with you tonight.

195
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,960
(Jiang Fang)

196
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,639
(Jiang Fang)

197
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,679
Hello, Nuan Nuan.

198
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:29,679
What is it?

199
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:31,839
I want to talk to you about work.

200
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,918
Are you available?

201
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:33,960
If it's about work,

202
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,720
you can talk to my manager, Xiao Jing.

203
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:38,639
The thing is, I have a really good project on hand.

204
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,159
The script is excellently written.

205
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,080
There's a role that's perfect for you.

206
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,759
I'll send it to you and your manager.

207
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,799
Contact me when you're done going through it, okay?

208
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:49,919
Okay.

209
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,080
Han Hui.

210
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,799
Do you think Mr. Jiang can get Wen Xiao Nuan...

211
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,559
to star in "Twin Flowers"?

212
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,480
Jiang Fang...

213
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:11,558
has no reason to turn down this chance...

214
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:13,399
that can turn his life around.

215
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:16,840
But he's Wen Xiao Nuan's ex-boyfriend after all.

216
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,240
And Wen Xiao Nuan just announced her relationship.

217
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,559
She might have reservations.

218
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,039
That depends...

219
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,440
on how much Wen Xiao Nuan loves Fei Mo.

220
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:31,600
As a rookie,

221
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,519
she can't turn down such a good opportunity.

222
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,440
Sorry, I'm late.

223
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,120
There was a traffic jam.

224
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,720
It's okay. I just got here too.

225
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:01,320
You know what?

226
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,480
Fei Mo didn't even tell me...

227
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:05,000
that he was going to announce his relationship.

228
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:08,519
But Ms. Cheng should be very happy now.

229
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,799
She's probably forcing Fei Mo to take Wen Xiao Nuan home.

230
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm so happy for them.

231
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:16,840
Jia Yi.

232
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,120
What if I told you...

233
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,399
that I want to take you home too?

234
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You...

235
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,279
Jia Yi.

236
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,080
What's wrong?

237
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:30,440
Jia Yi.

238
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,440
Nothing.

239
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:35,080
Let's talk about that next time.

240
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,320
I'm not ready yet.

241
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:41,758
Yun Zhou, you haven't gone rock climbing in a while...

242
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:43,320
or visited art exhibitions.

243
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:45,600
I've been busy with work lately.

244
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:48,720
Besides, I must first spend time with you when I'm free.

245
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:49,879
Right?

246
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:50,960
By the way,

247
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:52,799
this bakery just released a new red velvet cake.

248
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,240
It's really good.

249
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,440
I bet you'll like it,

250
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:56,759
so I ordered one for you.

251
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,200
Try it later.

252
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,240
Here, try it.

253
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,960
How is it?

254
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,039
Don't go. Don't leave me.

255
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,599
Don't go.

256
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,840
Calm down, Jia Yi.

257
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,240
My parents were right.

258
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:25,759
We're from two different worlds.

259
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:27,679
- What? - Besides,

260
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,600
a love without our parents' blessing won't last long.

261
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:34,759
Don't go!

262
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,798
Is our five-year relationship...

263
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:39,519
nothing compared to your arranged marriage?

264
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,399
What's wrong, Jia Yi?

265
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,519
- Do you know them? - No.

266
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,120
I just think...

267
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,000
the little girl is pretty cute.

268
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:03,679
Do you like girls?

269
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,559
What a coincidence.

270
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:06,679
I like girls too.

271
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:54,600
(Script of "Twin Flowers")

272
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:07,839
Xiao Li.

273
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,519
Help me investigate something.

274
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,599
Mr. Ye, are you available?

275
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:20,079
I have something to report to you.

276
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,519
Have a seat.

277
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,799
Have you read the script of "Twin Flowers"?

278
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,720
Yes.

279
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:30,799
What do you think?

280
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,919
The scriptwriter of "Twin Flowers"...

281
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,519
is the famous Mr. Liu.

282
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,170
The script is good.

283
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,200
But I won't allow Nuan Nuan...

284
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:39,359
to participate in this project.

285
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,079
I agree with you.

286
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:42,519
And I've done my investigation.

287
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:45,599
The other lead actress for this project is Han Hui.

288
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:48,079
She asked Jiang Fang to invite Wen Xiao Nuan for the role.

289
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,319
I think there's something fishy going on.

290
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:51,720
As you know,

291
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,319
Xiao Nuan looks a lot like the young Han Hui.

292
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,519
I'm afraid Han Hui will use this point...

293
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:58,440
and the plot of the movie...

294
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,119
to project the relationship between you three...

295
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,240
and cause malicious publicity.

296
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:03,039
She'll throw the dirt on Xiao Nuan.

297
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:06,240
We must protect Nuan Nuan...

298
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:08,279
and not let her get hurt.

299
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,920
But knowing Wen Xiao Nuan,

300
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,890
she won't give up such a good script.

301
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:15,410
Even if I reject her in person,

302
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:16,960
she'll still fight for it with you.

303
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,559
I hope it won't affect your relationship.

304
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:46,359
Nuan Nuan.

305
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,559
Mr. Jiang.

306
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:52,839
I've read the script.

307
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:55,079
I'm very touched.

308
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:58,559
I'm very interested in this role.

309
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:00,410
Okay.

310
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,319
I'm glad you're accepting the role.

311
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,200
The two lead actresses are decided then.

312
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,440
Who's the other lead actress?

313
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:08,960
It's Ms. Han Hui.

314
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,518
Then...

315
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:17,319
let me talk to my manager before making a decision.

316
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,170
Okay, bye.

317
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,119
Okay, Mr. Ye. I got it.

318
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,410
Bye.

319
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,599
Xiao Jing.

320
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,079
Xiao Jing.

321
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:46,170
Have you read the script of "Twin Flowers"?

322
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:48,839
What do you think of this project?

323
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:51,240
Professionally speaking,

324
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,890
it's a good project.

325
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:54,720
The character suits you too.

326
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:59,079
I like the character too.

327
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:02,079
I really want to do it.

328
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:05,079
But putting aside the project,

329
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:07,079
do you know...

330
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:10,410
that the other lead actress of this movie is Han Hui?

331
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:14,959
If you're in this movie,

332
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,278
it's inevitable...

333
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:17,650
for you to interact with Han Hui on set.

334
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:19,649
She's Mr. Ye's ex-girlfriend.

335
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:20,920
You're Mr. Ye's current girlfriend.

336
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,240
I'm afraid she'll cause trouble on purpose...

337
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:25,440
and cause speculation about your relationship.

338
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:27,650
Have you considered this?

339
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,679
I chose "Twin Flowers"...

340
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,599
because I liked the script itself.

341
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:35,200
I'll prove it with my acting.

342
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:36,960
As for the rest,

343
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,440
the truth will speak for itself.

344
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,680
A lot of things can't be predicted.

345
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:43,410
I don't recommend it.

346
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:45,319
Why?

347
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,119
To protect you.

348
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,960
Hello.

349
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,920
Hello, I have an appointment with Yun Zhou.

350
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,680
I said, I have an appointment with Mr. Gu.

351
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:09,890
Hold on.

352
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:15,200
Mr. Gu, someone is looking for you at the front desk.

353
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:17,079
Okay.

354
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,169
Mr. Gu said he'll come to get you right away.

355
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:20,170
Okay.

356
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,039
Cheng.

357
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:23,680
Di Di.

358
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,439
It has been a while. Why are you here?

359
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,440
When did you come back? You didn't tell me.

360
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,680
It has just been a few days.

361
00:21:28,681 --> 00:21:31,078
You only contacted Yun Zhou as soon as you came back.

362
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:32,240
You didn't even look for me.

363
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,799
- You prioritize men over friends.
- Don't talk nonsense.

364
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,119
I didn't.

365
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,680
Are you and Yun Zhou...

366
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,598
No.

367
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:42,798
Why not?

368
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,119
You two were the most popular in school.

369
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:47,598
If you hadn't gone abroad to study,

370
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:49,359
you two would be married by now.

371
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:53,200
Enough, or someone will be unhappy.

372
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:55,079
Who?

373
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,759
All right, I'll take you to Yun Zhou.

374
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,000
Cheng.

375
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,720
Yun Zhou.

376
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,160
Long time no see, buddy.

377
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:07,559
Long time no see.

378
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,479
How have you been?

379
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,519
I'm still the same.

380
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,279
I heard you got married. Is that true?

381
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,999
- It's true. - Don't lie to me.

382
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,319
How are you so well-informed?

383
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:17,240
- Let's go upstairs. - Let's go.

384
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:22,839
Miss. How can I help you?

385
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:44,919
(Gu Yun Zhou and Zhao Di)

386
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,758
(A marriage between childhood sweethearts of two families)

387
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:48,160
(A lovely young couple)

388
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:53,319
(What a lovely couple, congrats!)

389
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,480
Ms. Wang.

390
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,279
Yun Zhou and I grew up together.

391
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,559
We're childhood friends.

392
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:03,839
Our parents have long decided for us to get married.

393
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,720
So please leave Yun Zhou.

394
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:08,759
Don't get in the way of our relationship.

395
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:10,880
Ms. Wang.

396
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,160
You and Yun Zhou...

397
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,519
are from different worlds.

398
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:16,319
You're not compatible with each other.

399
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:18,400
If you really love him,

400
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,039
can you really bear...

401
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,679
to let him accommodate you for the rest of his life?

402
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,038
You haven't gone rock climbing in a while...

403
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:25,640
or visited art exhibitions.

404
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,440
I've been busy with work lately.

405
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:30,358
Besides, I must first spend time with you when I'm free.

406
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:31,400
Right?

407
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,799
You two were the most popular in school.

408
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,239
If you hadn't gone abroad to study,

409
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,000
you two would be married by now.

410
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,359
I heard you got married. Is that true?

411
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:02,279
(Let's break up)

412
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:14,559
(Wang Jia Yi)

413
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,079
(Let's break up)

414
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,680
(Switch off)

415
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:31,599
(Let's break up)

416
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,240
(Jia Yi)

417
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:40,759
Hello.

418
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,399
The subscriber you dialed is unavailable.

419
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,480
Sorry.

420
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:48,639
Hello.

421
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,118
The subscriber you dialed is unavailable.

422
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:52,119
Sorry.

423
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,400
Jia Yi.

424
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,039
Jia Yi, are you in there?

425
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,880
Why won't you answer my calls?

426
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:37,119
Jia Yi.

427
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:38,440
Go away.

428
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,200
I don't want to see you again.

429
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,680
Jia Yi.

430
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:46,799
Did I do something wrong?

431
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,880
What's going on?

432
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:49,839
Jia Yi.

433
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,480
We don't belong to the same world.

434
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:00,240
Let's break up.

435
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:05,559
Jia Yi, has there been a misunderstanding?

436
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,880
Open the door.

437
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,079
Let's talk about this.

438
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,359
Jia Yi.

439
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:13,920
Jia Yi.

440
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:15,599
Yun Zhou.

441
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:18,039
You have your own world.

442
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,279
You have your family responsibilities.

443
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,720
Love and passion...

444
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,319
will fade one day.

445
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:36,599
When that time comes, you'll realize...

446
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:41,160
that I'm not the one you want.

447
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:48,200
What you need is someone...

448
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,640
who is well-matched with you.

449
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,559
Instead of this,

450
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,200
let's end amicably.

451
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:06,039
Let's not hurt each other.

452
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:09,359
Jia Yi.

453
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:10,960
Can you open the door, Jia Yi?

454
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,240
Jia Yi!

455
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,119
Open the door, Jia Yi!

456
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,759
Jia Yi!

457
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:33,680
Jia Yi.

458
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:35,599
Listen carefully.

459
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:38,000
I won't give up.

460
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:40,799
I'm going to prove to you with my actions...

461
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:43,079
that my love for you is real.

462
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,440
Fei Mo.

463
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,400
I have something to talk to you about.

464
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,839
If it's about "Twin Flowers",

465
00:28:58,119 --> 00:28:59,279
you don't have to tell me.

466
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,598
Why are you and Xiao Jing...

467
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:05,240
so against this project?

468
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,240
This project doesn't suit you.

469
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,440
We'll find you a better project.

470
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:14,799
You know it's a good project.

471
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,920
And the role suits me.

472
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,720
You're not letting me do it...

473
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,759
because of your ex-girlfriend, right?

474
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,640
Yes.

475
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,759
You know what Han Hui is capable of.

476
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,200
You're no match for her.

477
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,599
I'm a professional actress.

478
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,640
I choose my work because of the work itself.

479
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:43,400
Not because of anything else.

480
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:46,200
I just want to do a good job.

481
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:48,400
You don't think Anning has the capability...

482
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,039
to find better scripts?

483
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,720
No matter how well I play Anning's productions,

484
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:54,879
everyone will think...

485
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,039
I got the chance because of you.

486
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,720
But this is different.

487
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:01,399
This is the first resource I personally received.

488
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,400
It's very meaningful.

489
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,440
Is proving yourself...

490
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:06,960
really that important?

491
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,240
Fei Mo.

492
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,599
I don't want to live under your wings forever.

493
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,279
I want to do what I like.

494
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,039
I want to play the role I like.

495
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,880
I want to be as brilliant as you.

496
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:29,920
I want to stand side by side with you one day.

497
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:32,079
That's why I have to work harder.

498
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,078
"Twin Flowers"...

499
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:36,119
is Aurora Film's investment with Han Hui as the lead role.

500
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,318
The control...

501
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:40,440
is entirely in Jiang Fang and Han Hui's hands.

502
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,359
I don't want you to get hurt.

503
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,319
I want you to consider it from the boss's perspective,

504
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,160
not as my boyfriend.

505
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,558
As an artist of Anning,

506
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,160
I'm formally requesting you...

507
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,200
to let me act in "Twin Flowers".

508
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,480
Please consider my request.
