1
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,439
What do you think of the data?

2
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,200
Are you deaf?

3
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,120
Listen. The data is not good at all.

4
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:49,159
If you think it's good,

5
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,439
then where's your standard?

6
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:51,560
What's going on?

7
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,239
Mr. Gu.

8
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:56,239
Good luck.

9
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,319
Go back.

10
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,439
- Redo it. - Yes.

11
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,370
What's wrong?

12
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:25,439
What did Gao Ming do this time?

13
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,758
Based on the report,

14
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:34,438
the popularity of "Blue Galaxy" is quite good.

15
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:35,599
You think it's good too?

16
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,159
Did you have a fight with Wen Xiao Nuan?

17
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:53,840
You can't drag the innocent into your lovers' quarrel.

18
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:58,960
I just remembered I have work to do.

19
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:00,439
I have to go.

20
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,199
It's so scary.

21
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,280
Too scary.

22
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,879
What's wrong?

23
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:22,479
You don't know.

24
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:24,638
Ever since Wen Xiao Nuan left,

25
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,680
it's as if all the warmth in the world is gone.

26
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,879
Now Anning is as cold as ice.

27
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,478
Nuan Nuan went to work.

28
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,960
It's not like she's not coming back.

29
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:35,878
But she left without saying goodbye...

30
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:37,120
right after Fei Mo confessed his feelings.

31
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,280
But I really didn't expect...

32
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:42,759
Mr. Ye to have such a childish side.

33
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,800
Fei Mo looks cold and unaffable.

34
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,240
Over the years,

35
00:03:48,241 --> 00:03:50,719
there aren't many people he has liked.

36
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,639
How many people have you liked?

37
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,439
Jia Yi, I can swear to you.

38
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,199
It doesn't matter who or how many people I liked in the past.

39
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,439
You're the only one I love now.

40
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,120
Really.

41
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:10,520
I believe you.

42
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,480
By the way,

43
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,240
do you think Wen Xiao Nuan...

44
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:24,480
is a spy of Aurora Film?

45
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,839
She's here to bring down Anning.

46
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,240
The current overbearing CEO is barely recognizable now.

47
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,049
If this goes on,

48
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,879
Anning will fall apart.

49
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,439
This must be Aurora Film's scheme.

50
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,759
You should become a screenwriter.

51
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm the screenwriter of our love.

52
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:49,799
Aren't I?

53
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,959
You're so annoying.

54
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,759
Xiao Jing, I'm back.

55
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,240
Let me take a look at you.

56
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:28,199
You didn't get much of a tan.

57
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,800
You look good.

58
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,240
It must've been tough.

59
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,439
It's not hard. I've endured it anyway.

60
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,360
Has my paycheck arrived?

61
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,480
Yes.

62
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,878
I've transferred it to you along with the balance of "Blue Galaxy".

63
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:41,000
Check it.

64
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,879
Look at how anxious you are.

65
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,959
That's enough.

66
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,639
Enough?

67
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,120
That's a lot of money.

68
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,360
What do you need it for?

69
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,560
I have a big use for it.

70
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:57,839
Thank you, Xiao Jing.

71
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,120
I'm going to cash the check.

72
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,759
Ye Fei Mo.

73
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:19,519
Is there a matter?

74
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,560
Yes, I'm back.

75
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:23,560
I don't deal with artists directly.

76
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:25,519
Talk to Zhou Xiao Jing if you need anything.

77
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:28,639
- No, I... - Anything else?

78
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:31,839
If not, leave.

79
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:33,120
There's something else.

80
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:37,920
This is the money I owe you.

81
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,319
I'll pay you back now.

82
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,360
You left without a word...

83
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:42,680
for a month just for this?

84
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,399
Yes.

85
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,800
I got it. You can go now.

86
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,079
You haven't seen me for so long.

87
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,199
Don't you have anything to say to me?

88
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:55,319
No.

89
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:16,839
Nuan Nuan, you're back.

90
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,279
You bought shampoo?

91
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,160
This is the endorsement I just signed.

92
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:28,319
Adolph sent me a few shampoo sets.

93
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,519
I saw that you were out of them,

94
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,000
so I brought a set back for you.

95
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:32,560
Thank you, Nuan Nuan.

96
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:34,759
How is it? Are you tired?

97
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,120
Did everything go well?

98
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,240
Everything else is going well.

99
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,160
But when I came back to pay Ye Fei Mo's debt,

100
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:44,319
he ignored me.

101
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,040
What's going on?

102
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:49,160
Nuan Nuan, this is your fault.

103
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:50,639
Think about it.

104
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,000
You confess your love,

105
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,920
but the other person leaves without a response.

106
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,079
The next day, he suddenly disappears.

107
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:57,559
He comes back a month later...

108
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,518
and suddenly wants to pay off his debt...

109
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:00,720
and draw a clear line.

110
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:02,639
What would you think?

111
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,039
I'd think he's dumping me.

112
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,160
That's right.

113
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,759
Knowing Ye Fei Mo,

114
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:11,839
I'm sure he'll act as if nothing happened.

115
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,319
But for the past month, he hasn't been doing well.

116
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,040
You should think of a way to cajole him.

117
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,199
Okay.

118
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:43,639
(Sure-fire approaches)

119
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,559
Breakfast is ready.

120
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:35,799
How did you get in?

121
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,679
The password to your house isn't hard to guess.

122
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:39,720
It's my birthdate.

123
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,720
I made your favorite seafood porridge...

124
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:43,209
and soy milk and youtiao...

125
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,240
for a change of taste.

126
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:56,279
The attentiveness approach.

127
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,919
Express love anywhere and everywhere,

128
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,799
and drown him in the tenderness of love.

129
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:17,120
The absent-minded straw approach.

130
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:21,519
Seductive eyes and pouty lips.

131
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,679
With intermittent sucking sounds,

132
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:27,720
exude a fatal seduction.

133
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:30,159
Fatal index, five stars.

134
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:31,840
My goodness.

135
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,679
He's drawn to me.

136
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:36,519
The straw approach is so effective.

137
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,210
Are you sick?

138
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:44,759
Go see a doctor if you have a fever.

139
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,039
What are you doing here?

140
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:08,919
Mr. Ye.

141
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,440
Let's go to work together.

142
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,759
Aren't you afraid our colleagues will see us?

143
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:15,840
No.

144
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:17,279
The 30-second get closer approach.

145
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:18,479
Sit in the passenger seat...

146
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,960
and guide him to put on the seatbelt for me,

147
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:21,080
then apologize.

148
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,840
Okay.

149
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,480
You drive.

150
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:29,039
I'll drive?

151
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,240
It says in your profile that you have a driving license.

152
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:32,959
I do have a license.

153
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,840
But after I got my license, I...

154
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:37,600
I've never driven before.

155
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,199
Let's go or we'll be late.

156
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,360
I'll deduct your pay.

157
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,919
Change your shoes before you drive.

158
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,080
Be careful.

159
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:15,000
I told you to be careful!

160
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,240
- Drive steadily. - I know.

161
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,159
Don't get too close.

162
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,080
I told you to be steady!

163
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,480
I know.

164
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,639
Slow down!

165
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:55,960
Be careful!

166
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,519
Wen Xiao Nuan!

167
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:23,960
Mr. Ye.

168
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:25,279
Are you okay?

169
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:28,559
Miss.

170
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,639
Do you really have a driver's license?

171
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,320
I do.

172
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,559
But this is my first time driving after getting the license.

173
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,039
Let's see how long you can avoid me.

174
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,159
What a coincidence.

175
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,879
Let's take the elevator home together.

176
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:56,879
Ye Fei Mo, I have something to tell you.

177
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,519
I'm busy.

178
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:01,759
Let's take the elevator together then.

179
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:04,639
I want to be alone.

180
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:06,120
I'll take the stairs.

181
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,080
But you live on the 35th floor.

182
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,960
Why are you here?

183
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,559
I've been waiting for you.

184
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,960
Why?

185
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,159
Weren't you happy out there?

186
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,759
I'm pursuing you.

187
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,679
It's been a month.

188
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,039
You're being so cold to me.

189
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:55,159
You're the one who killed my fire.

190
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,320
I'm sorry.

191
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:00,440
I went to work at Changbai Mountains...

192
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,919
because I wanted us to start on an equal footing.

193
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:10,679
We first started because of a contract.

194
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:14,039
This first beginning is also a contract.

195
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:17,600
But this time, I can prove myself.

196
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,639
We can have a different start.

197
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:27,399
I told you that you didn't have to pay me back.

198
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:31,879
But to me, love is equal.

199
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:34,159
I want to stand with you...

200
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,639
as an equal.

201
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,679
Why didn't you say this earlier?

202
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,039
Is this what you have to say?

203
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,159
Sorry, you're too late.

204
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,480
Get out.

205
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:51,720
Go.

206
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:53,639
Get out.

207
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:11,919
Nuan Nuan.

208
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,279
Why are you crying?

209
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,960
- Jia Yi.
- What's wrong? Why are you crying?

210
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,000
Jia Yi.

211
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,399
- It's okay.
- Is Ye Fei Mo really dumping me?

212
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:26,240
We haven't seen each other for a month.

213
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,120
No matter how I try to cajole him,

214
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,039
it won't work.

215
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,840
- He's ignoring me. - All right, don't cry.

216
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,919
All right, don't cry.

217
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,200
Let's think of something.

218
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,120
Maybe that's not what he really thinks.

219
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,600
Who cares what he thinks? I don't care.

220
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,559
Don't cry.

221
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,360
You really don't care?

222
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,638
Don't cry.

223
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:57,639
Don't cry.

224
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:03,080
Ye Fei Mo, why are you like this?

225
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,039
Ye Fei Mo!

226
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,000
All right now.

227
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,410
Ye Fei Mo, don't ignore me.

228
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:25,200
- Jia Yi. - Yun Zhou.

229
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:28,650
I think Nuan Nuan has done her best this time.

230
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,410
She still can't appease Mr. Ye.

231
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,240
Is that so?

232
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:34,359
Looks like it's my turn to perform.

233
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:50,240
Mr. Jiang, please confirm this promotion plan.

234
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,278
The poster concept is too outdated.

235
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:56,679
Although we're telling a traditional story,

236
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,038
we need to introduce a modern concept too.

237
00:17:58,039 --> 00:17:59,440
It shouldn't be old-fashioned. Redo it.

238
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:00,920
Yes.

239
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,079
Jiang Fang.

240
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:15,039
You can handle things by yourself in the company now.

241
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:18,279
That's because Mr. Jiang trusts me.

242
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:20,680
Otherwise, those people wouldn't listen to me.

243
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,519
When you're working hard,

244
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,000
you look really cool.

245
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:32,559
It feels so good.

246
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:34,649
I'm just too busy every day...

247
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:35,839
that I don't have time for you.

248
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,649
It's okay. I'm free.

249
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,680
I can keep you company.

250
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,680
- That's nice. - Are you tired?

251
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,599
I'll get you some coffee.

252
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,359
She didn't take her phone.

253
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:01,359
Anning has good taste.

254
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,518
Wen Xiao Nuan is so photogenic.

255
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:05,440
Yes, she's so pretty.

256
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:07,119
I can't wait to see the movie.

257
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,319
I hope it comes out soon.

258
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,890
Who told you to put this here?

259
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:12,319
Ms. Jiang.

260
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,038
Ms. Jiang, this is Mr. Jiang's order.

261
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:15,358
He chose the poster himself.

262
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:17,359
Put it away now. I don't want to see her face.

263
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:18,759
Yes.

264
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:37,799
Wen Xiao Nuan told me to give this to you.

265
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:41,079
She told me to make sure you finish it.

266
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:47,960
Leave it here.

267
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,240
Are you two still fighting?

268
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,079
We're fine now.

269
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:55,799
Stop lying.

270
00:19:57,559 --> 00:19:59,920
Wen Xiao Nuan is doing so much for you every day.

271
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:01,319
Are you still mad at her?

272
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:02,680
I'm not.

273
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,119
Then why are you ignoring her?

274
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,440
To teach her a lesson.

275
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:10,650
Don't you think the current Wen Xiao Nuan is very cute?

276
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,799
No.

277
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,000
Have you forgotten how you were a month ago?

278
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,960
Love is not a business negotiation.
There is no winning or losing.

279
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:23,680
If you keep going like this,

280
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:25,319
Wen Xiao Nuan will be heartbroken.

281
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:26,960
If she really leaves you,

282
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,720
you'll regret it.

283
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:04,680
Ye Fei Mo.

284
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,559
See you this weekend. I have something to tell you.

285
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,519
Close your eyes.

286
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,000
Give me your hand.

287
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:37,839
No peeking.

288
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:46,920
Are you ready?

289
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:50,440
Three, two, one.

290
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,279
It's beautiful.

291
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:02,359
Please.

292
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:54,480
So...

293
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:57,640
are you not mad at me anymore?

294
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,319
Didn't you say...

295
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,519
that you want to stand in front of me...

296
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,240
as an equal?

297
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,640
In our relationship,

298
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,960
have you always thought that you were beneath me?

299
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,880
I've never felt that way.

300
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,920
You have your stubbornness.

301
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,079
You have your pride.

302
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:19,599
You are you.

303
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,000
You're Wen Xiao Nuan.

304
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,039
Be careful.

305
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:51,400
Thank you.

306
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:53,319
Ye Fei Mo.

307
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:57,119
Ever since you showed up,

308
00:23:57,839 --> 00:23:59,440
my life has changed.

309
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:04,119
Happiness came too suddenly.

310
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,559
I want to prove myself so badly...

311
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,960
because I want to prove that I'm worthy of you.

312
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,000
Silly girl.

313
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:25,839
What is this?

314
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:38,519
(We'll walk together, and share honor and disgrace.)

315
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,680
No matter what you've been through,

316
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,440
or how you've been hurt,

317
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,119
you don't have to prove anything to me...

318
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,799
from now on.

319
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:55,319
Because in my heart,

320
00:24:56,759 --> 00:24:57,880
you're the best.

321
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:01,200
You're a blessing from the heavens.

322
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,559
Congratulations, Wen Xiao Nuan.

323
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:08,839
Ye Fei Mo is yours now.

324
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:37,359
Are you up?

325
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:38,680
Let's go to work together.

326
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,920
Good morning.

327
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:18,680
Good morning.

328
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,319
Well...

329
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:53,559
Stop.

330
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,960
What is it?

331
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,319
Let's split up. I'll go from here, you go from the door.

332
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,079
No, let's go in together.

333
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:01,759
Why are you hiding it?

334
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,639
I'm the rookie. You're the boss.

335
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,920
If everyone sees us,
they'll gossip about me.

336
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:09,319
We're in a relationship.
What's there to be afraid of?

337
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,119
Besides, I've told the media...

338
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:14,480
that I'll make it public if I'm in a relationship.

339
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,278
Our relationship is between us.

340
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:18,399
Why do we have to make it public?

341
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,720
It's fine as long as we keep it to ourselves.

342
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:28,200
See you.

343
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:44,358
What do you want for lunch today?

344
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:45,480
I'm fine with anything.

345
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,480
Thank you, Mr. Ye.

346
00:29:56,119 --> 00:29:57,359
My goodness.

347
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,999
Mr. Ye just smiled at me.

348
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,799
Mr. Ye didn't just smile at you.

349
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,358
He smiled at all of us.

350
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:04,240
- That's right. - He even greeted us.

351
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,079
But Mr. Ye...

352
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,880
picked up the pen and gave it to me.

353
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,480
And his eyes clearly said...

354
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:14,039
that I've placed...

355
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,038
Nuan Nuan. Come.

356
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:17,079
Let me tell you.

357
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,479
Do you know how nice Mr. Ye is?

358
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,240
He picked up my pen for me.

359
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:23,279
That's right. Do you know?

360
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,240
Mr. Ye even smiled at us today.

361
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:27,799
He usually looks so cool with a straight face.

362
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:29,839
My goodness. But when he smiles,

363
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,559
he can melt people's hearts.

364
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,119
I was wearing my sunglasses, so I didn't see it.

365
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,839
Do you think Mr. Ye is in a relationship?

366
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,200
No way. That's impossible.

367
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,319
That's right. How is that possible?

368
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,799
Mr. Ye is mine.

369
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,079
Yours?

370
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:50,960
You should stop dreaming.

371
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,200
That's right.

372
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:55,480
Stop laughing. Mr. Ye won't be yours either.

373
00:30:57,119 --> 00:30:58,240
You're right.

374
00:30:58,359 --> 00:30:59,960
How can Mr. Ye be mine?

375
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,400
I'll get going. Bye.

376
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,160
- Let's go. - Let's go.

377
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,680
What?

378
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,039
I'm here to see how training is going...

379
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:47,359
for our S-class artist.

380
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:53,839
There are people here.

381
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,680
What?

382
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,799
Are you afraid people will know that I'm your boyfriend?

383
00:31:58,559 --> 00:31:59,640
No.

384
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:01,759
If those ladies out there...

385
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,559
see that I've taken away their dream man,

386
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,519
they'll eat me alive.

387
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,519
Aren't you afraid that I'll eat you alive?

388
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,319
Hurry up and leave.

389
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,039
You're disturbing my training.

390
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,480
I'm thirsty too.

391
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,839
I want water too.

392
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,279
Hello, Mr. Ye.

393
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:37,759
The company has high hopes for Wen Xiao Nuan.

394
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,440
- You must be strict with her. - Okay.

395
00:32:57,319 --> 00:32:59,160
Wen Xiao Nuan, let's start the class.
