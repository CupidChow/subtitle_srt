1
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,518
It's Mr. Ye's treat today. Make sure to thank him.

2
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:45,560
Thank you, Fei Mo.

3
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,079
Look who I brought.

4
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,279
- Nuan Nuan. - Jia Yi, why are you here?

5
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,680
It's your wrap party today.

6
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:53,280
- We came to see you. - Come.

7
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:54,599
Let's go.

8
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,400
Mr. Ye.

9
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,000
Mr. Ye, take the main seat.

10
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,920
You're the director. You can sit there.

11
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,598
Don't be shy. If it weren't for you,

12
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:10,119
the movie might not have started filming.

13
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,319
Don't be modest. Come on.

14
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,279
- Come on. - Don't be shy.

15
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,039
- You sit over there. - Hurry up.

16
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,479
- You sit over there. - Don't be shy.

17
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:22,840
Hello.

18
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:31,919
Xiao Nuan.

19
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,680
Xiao Nuan, sit here.

20
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,960
You contributed too.

21
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:38,439
Okay.

22
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,919
Come, Nuan Nuan. Sit next to me.

23
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,879
What?

24
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,159
Are you unhappy about Xiao Nuan sitting next to me?

25
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:51,919
Jia Yi.

26
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,520
Let's go.

27
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,080
- Hello, Mr. Ye. - Mr. Ye.

28
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,960
- Hello, Director. - Director.

29
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,000
We've been through so much...

30
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,719
and overcome so many obstacles.

31
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:27,039
We finally wrapped up.

32
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:29,680
Let's welcome Director Li to say a few words.

33
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,159
- Okay. - Okay.

34
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,560
A thousand words can be concluded in one sentence.

35
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:36,759
Thank you.

36
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:39,199
Thank you for your hard work and perseverance, everyone.

37
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,000
That's why we're here today.

38
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,520
I especially want to thank our female lead, Wen Xiao Nuan.

39
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,718
As a rookie, her performance this time...

40
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:52,000
exceeded our expectations.

41
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,599
And she persisted with an injury.

42
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,400
We should all learn from you.

43
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:58,759
Come on. Let's toast to Wen Xiao Nuan.

44
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,960
Nuan Nuan, you're the best.

45
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,319
Thank you, everyone.

46
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:04,159
I just did what I had to do.

47
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,079
Everyone has worked so hard.

48
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,719
I couldn't drag the team down.

49
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,999
Thank you for taking care of a rookie like me.

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,120
Here's to you all.

51
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,680
Mr. Ye, say something.

52
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:29,610
- I also want to...
- There's nothing to say.

53
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,680
We're all here today to have fun.

54
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:33,480
Let's play a game.

55
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,439
How about Truth or Dare?

56
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:38,610
- Okay? - Okay.

57
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:47,920
Will it be me?

58
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:49,399
If it's me,

59
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:50,959
I'll tell Wen Xiao Nuan that I...

60
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:59,279
- Mo Xiao Bai. - Mo Xiao Bai.

61
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:01,519
I choose truth.

62
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,120
Mo Xiao Bai, do you have someone you like?

63
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:05,560
Me?

64
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,199
I don't have someone I like yet.

65
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,730
But...

66
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:14,730
I like someone like Wen Xiao Nuan.

67
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:23,878
Fei Mo, why did you kick me?

68
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:24,879
I...

69
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,839
Wen Xiao Nuan is so cute and talented.

70
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,279
Don't you like her?

71
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,759
Wen Xiao Nuan, what kind of guys do you like?

72
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,839
Me?

73
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:46,120
What do you think of Mo Xiao Bai?

74
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:58,799
He's not bad.

75
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,279
- Be together. - Be together.

76
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,719
- Be together. - Be together.

77
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:13,240
- Be together. - Be together.

78
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,160
It's Mr. Ye! What do you choose?

79
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,079
- Dare. - I'll give him the task.

80
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,879
Mr. Ye, confess to the first person...

81
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:25,879
in your WeChat messaging history.

82
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:30,438
- Confess. - Confess.

83
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:36,039
- Confess. - Confess.

84
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:41,599
- Confess. - Confess.

85
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,040
Hurry up.

86
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,560
It's Wen Xiao Nuan.

87
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,120
They're messaging each other on WeChat.

88
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:53,240
So romantic.

89
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,279
Answer it.

90
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:21,079
Wen Xiao Nuan.

91
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,639
I...

92
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,120
Don't drink too much.

93
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,920
Cheers.

94
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,240
How much should I pour?

95
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:06,199
My idol is pouring me wine.

96
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,759
- Bye, Mr. Ye. - Bye, Director Li.

97
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,560
Bye.

98
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,600
- Bye, Mr. Ye. - Bye, Director Li.

99
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:20,638
Let's go home.

100
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,639
I'll take you home.

101
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,199
Fei Mo, take care of Xiao Nuan.

102
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,480
- Let's go. - Get some rest.

103
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:26,759
Let's go.

104
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,160
Let's go.

105
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,838
I...

106
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:32,210
I'll take Xiao Nuan home.

107
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,120
Step aside.

108
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,090
Fei Mo, you...

109
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,559
You're bullying me again.

110
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,360
I'll take you home.

111
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:43,759
Fei Mo.

112
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,879
Fei Mo, are you abandoning me?

113
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:06,090
Xiao Bai.

114
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,330
Aunt.

115
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,840
Fei Mo is bullying me again.

116
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,720
How did he bully you?

117
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:13,360
Put him on the phone.

118
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:14,919
I'll scold him.

119
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,279
He prioritized a girl over me.

120
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,279
We were having a wrap party...

121
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:19,840
and everyone got drunk.

122
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,210
He only helped Wen Xiao Nuan and left.

123
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,120
He didn't even care about his cousin.

124
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,519
Really? That's great.

125
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,090
He did a great job.

126
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:30,840
Aunt.

127
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,450
Xiao Bai.

128
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:35,960
I was just saying...

129
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,330
I'll send a car to pick you up.

130
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:40,120
Wait there. Don't go anywhere.

131
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:48,450
He has finally come to his senses.

132
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,919
We're home. Be careful.

133
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,000
Watch your head.

134
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:09,919
Steady.

135
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,090
Come on.

136
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,759
Walk properly.

137
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:20,240
Why don't I carry you?

138
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,240
No.

139
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,679
Be good. I'll carry you.

140
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,480
Come on, get on.

141
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:31,210
Hold on tight.

142
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,279
You smell so good.

143
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,600
What are you saying?

144
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:46,840
Don't move.

145
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,240
Ye Fei Mo, I'm so happy.

146
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,399
Everyone is happy today.

147
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,200
It's not because the shoot is over.

148
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,320
I'm happy right now.

149
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:07,720
Say it, Ye Fei Mo.

150
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,279
Say it.

151
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:13,919
Wen Xiao Nuan.

152
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,759
Actually, I've always...

153
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,120
What?

154
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,758
Ye Fei Mo, I really want to crack your head open...

155
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:49,399
and see what's inside.

156
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:50,798
The mood was so good,

157
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:52,120
yet you didn't say anything.

158
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,798
Do you want to wait until Wen Xiao Nuan...

159
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:56,960
becomes your sister-in-law before you say anything?

160
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:58,399
Mo Xiao Bai wouldn't dare.

161
00:11:58,679 --> 00:11:59,679
Mo Xiao Bai.

162
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,080
Even if it's not him, there are other guys.

163
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,519
I really don't know what's on your mind.

164
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,519
Cut the crap.

165
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,919
You're still so stubborn.

166
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:11,079
Everyone knows...

167
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,799
that Mr. Ye is romantic and dashing.

168
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:14,919
But in reality, you're all bark and no bite.

169
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,440
You're just a paper tiger.

170
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,200
Shut up.

171
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,159
I'll leave you alone then. I'm going out with Jia Yi.

172
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,159
Come back. Sit down.

173
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,639
Let's talk business.

174
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,840
Don't be too busy dating...

175
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,159
that you forget about work.

176
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,720
I know.

177
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,840
"Blue Galaxy" is in full swing now. I'm monitoring it.

178
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,799
Aurora Film's "Magpie Bridge"...

179
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,200
is getting a lot of attention.

180
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:39,440
Han Hui is determined...

181
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:40,919
to compete with us.

182
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,279
Yes. But "Blue Galaxy" has the upper hand.

183
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,960
We have more time in the latter half.

184
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:47,120
The result won't be bad.

185
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:49,959
Besides, Wen Xiao Nuan's performance this time...

186
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,360
was outstanding.

187
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:53,320
She will definitely win.

188
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:00,080
That's the plan for now.

189
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:02,399
"Magpie Bridge" has wrapped up.

190
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:04,279
The expectation of the market is really high.

191
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:06,119
I think adding Han Hui to the team...

192
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,519
was a great decision.

193
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:09,479
Han Hui signed with Aurora Film.

194
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,000
It's all thanks to you, Mr. Jiang.

195
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,480
Young people are formidable.

196
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,758
Yes, Mr. Jiang even called that day...

197
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:17,200
and praised you for not letting him down.

198
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:19,158
Mr. Jiang and the directors...

199
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:21,360
gave me the title of production director.

200
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,600
I, Jiang Fang, will not fail my duty.

201
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,199
The achievements I have made today...

202
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,440
is not worth mentioning compared to those of you present here.

203
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:29,879
I will continue to work hard...

204
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,039
and create more wealth for the company.

205
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,360
Well...

206
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,960
That's all for today's meeting.

207
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:49,080
Jiang Fang.

208
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:52,839
There are so many people.

209
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,879
It's not a good image.

210
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,320
What's the big issue? Everyone knows you're my fiancé.

211
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,000
Jiang Fang.

212
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:01,200
Did my brother and the board praise you today?

213
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:05,360
- Come, let's go shopping. - Okay.

214
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:11,559
Jia Yi.

215
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,840
Come. Sit here.

216
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,960
Here.

217
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,679
See what you want to drink.

218
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,879
I'm not looking. Just get to the point.

219
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,278
What's wrong, Jia Yi?

220
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,639
Are you in a bad mood?

221
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,960
Look at me.

222
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:32,279
Are you still angry at Mr. Xu...

223
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,080
over that thing last time?

224
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,399
It's a misunderstanding.

225
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,679
It's all a misunderstanding.

226
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,518
Mr. Xu drank too much that day.

227
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:43,558
Misunderstanding?

228
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:44,639
Whether it's a misunderstanding or not,

229
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:46,200
you know it yourself.

230
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,320
Jia Yi, that's enough.

231
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:52,599
Then do you want me to call Mr. Xu here...

232
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,678
to apologize to you?

233
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:54,679
Apologize?

234
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,120
It's not a problem of apologizing.

235
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,399
That's a crime. A crime, you know?

236
00:14:58,519 --> 00:14:59,600
Wang Jia Yi.

237
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:01,000
Don't be so shameless.

238
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,559
All right.

239
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,639
From now on,

240
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,000
I won't let you see Mr. Xu again, okay?

241
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:11,960
Look.

242
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:13,679
I got you a new gig.

243
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,879
Take a look. It's a good variety show.

244
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,080
I'm not looking at it.

245
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:19,279
What's wrong with you?

246
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,519
You won't stop.

247
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:21,679
I want to terminate the contract.

248
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:23,199
My gosh.

249
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,919
Are you a big shot now?

250
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:27,480
Who are you to terminate a contract Aurora Film?

251
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,080
Did you find yourself a backer?

252
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,720
- I... - Yes.

253
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,559
I am...

254
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,000
her backer.

255
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,799
Mr. Gu.

256
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,120
If you needed anything,

257
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,239
you could have just called.

258
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,759
You didn't have to come in person.

259
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,119
I didn't know...

260
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,559
that Aurora Film could hide the truth from the masses.

261
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,519
Listen up.

262
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:55,000
Jia Yi has terminated her contract.

263
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:57,519
As for what you did with that scumbag,

264
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,240
we'll leave it to the police.

265
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:00,639
One more thing.

266
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:03,159
I don't want you to appear in front of Jia Yi anymore.

267
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:04,960
Do you understand?

268
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,519
As for the future matters,

269
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,080
my assistant will deal with you.

270
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:22,360
I'll bite you both to death.

271
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,960
This one.

272
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,519
Jiang Fang, is this pretty?

273
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,080
Yes.

274
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:46,080
This one.

275
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,759
What about this one?

276
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,200
It's quite nice.

277
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:01,919
This one.

278
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:09,960
This one is quite stylish.

279
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:11,759
What do you think?

280
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,650
Yes, it is.

281
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,440
It's nice. It's pretty.

282
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,200
Don't you have anything else to say?

283
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,079
Are you listening to me?

284
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:30,240
Things are busy at work.

285
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:33,960
From planning the wedding...

286
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,799
to booking the banquet and picking the hotel,

287
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:37,279
I've been taking care of it all by myself.

288
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:39,960
Now you're giving me an attitude while picking the ring.

289
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,650
Do you want to marry me or not?

290
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:43,358
I put my work aside...

291
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:44,479
to come here with you to look at rings.

292
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,559
What else do you want?

293
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:51,170
Ling Er.

294
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:52,759
Ling Er.

295
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,079
Ling Er.

296
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,839
Stop it, okay?

297
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:57,890
Ever since the shoot for "Magpie Bridge" ended,

298
00:17:58,599 --> 00:17:59,649
you've been getting busier.

299
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:00,799
You don't care about me anymore.

300
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:03,999
Do you think now that your position in the company is stable,

301
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,119
you don't need me anymore?

302
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:06,518
What are you talking about, Ling Er?

303
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:07,920
How is that possible?

304
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:10,759
After Han Hui joined Aurora Film,

305
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:11,839
my responsibility increased.

306
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,240
I'm just very busy.

307
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:14,599
Listen to me.

308
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,000
After "Magpie Bridge" is released,

309
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:17,279
the dividends will arrive.

310
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,889
Do you remember what I said?

311
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,440
I'll provide for you with my own money.

312
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:22,319
You always say that.

313
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:23,919
You said...

314
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,559
I had to wait for my brother's approval.

315
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:27,480
I had to wait for Han Hui to be signed.

316
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:29,440
I had to wait for the shoot of "Magpie Bridge" to end.

317
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:31,359
Now I have to wait for the movie to be released...

318
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,079
and wait for you to get the dividend.

319
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:35,279
There's always something to wait for.

320
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,359
I can't wait anymore.

321
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:47,278
I don't want to hear about the future.

322
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:48,359
I only want to hear about the present.

323
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,599
Do you want to marry me or not?

324
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,279
Is it pretty?

325
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,720
What's wrong, Fei Mo?

326
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,759
You don't seem to be in a good mood.

327
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,519
Let me guess.

328
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:42,410
Xiao Nuan must be too busy training...

329
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:43,890
and has no time for you.

330
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:45,279
You're the one who set the rules,

331
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,410
so you can't break them yourself.

332
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,240
Hence...

333
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,318
you dug your own grave.

334
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:51,650
No one will think you're mute if you don't talk.

335
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,410
Fei Mo.

336
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,319
You should be happy.

337
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,079
Xiao Nuan is so ambitious.

338
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,480
She'll make it big in the future.

339
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:18,119
Aunt, Fei Mo is troubled by love.

340
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,410
If you don't help him,

341
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,200
your daughter-in-law will be gone.

342
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:25,170
(Aunt)

343
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,759
(Big Princess)

344
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,410
Fei Mo, come back for dinner tonight.

345
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:46,680
No.

346
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:49,079
Nuan Nuan will come.

347
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:50,680
Wait for me.

348
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,170
Useless.

349
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,519
Nuan Nuan.

350
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,480
The filming of "Blue Galaxy" has wrapped up.

351
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:45,279
Why don't you take some time off?

352
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:48,440
I heard that you're still the same.

353
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,759
Training hard every day.

354
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,160
I'm still a rookie after all.

355
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,839
I have a lot to learn.

356
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,319
I can't slack off.

357
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,079
It's good that you're motivated.

358
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:04,359
But you can't tire yourself out.

359
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:05,519
Right?

360
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,680
If you do this, I'll feel sorry for you.

361
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:11,359
Thank you, Ms. Cheng. I'll be careful.

362
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:43,319
Are you done looking?

363
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:47,799
I wasn't looking.

364
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,000
I wasn't.

365
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:53,240
Let's eat.

366
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,680
Aunt, Fei Mo, Xiao Nuan.

367
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,720
Why are you everywhere?

368
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,960
Aunt.

369
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,200
Fei Mo doesn't seem to welcome me.

370
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:07,640
Don't mind him.

371
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,039
Come, sit next to Nuan Nuan.

372
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:10,160
Okay.

373
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,278
Come, I'll switch with you.

374
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:20,279
Okay.

375
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:21,519
Mom.

376
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,640
Nuan Nuan.

377
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:27,680
It's been a few days.

378
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,720
I missed you.

379
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:34,640
Come with me.

380
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:42,798
Come.

381
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:43,799
- Yes! - Yes!

382
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,079
- We did it! - We finally did it!

383
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:47,799
Fei Mo has finally come to his senses.

384
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,000
It wasn't easy.

385
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,559
You did a great job.

386
00:23:57,119 --> 00:23:58,480
Ye Fei Mo, what are you doing?

387
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,079
I have something serious...

388
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,920
to tell you.

389
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,400
What is it?

390
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,160
Something very serious.

391
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,000
Extremely serious.

392
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,160
So serious...

393
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:13,920
that it has disrupted the order of my life.

394
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,799
So serious...

395
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,839
that I can't sleep well or eat well.

396
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:20,359
Even at work,

397
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,119
I'm often absent-minded.

398
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,319
It's so serious...

399
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,880
that I'm no longer who I used to be.

400
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:31,519
Or perhaps...

401
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:33,559
this is the real me.

402
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,240
What is it?

403
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,680
Listen carefully.

404
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,880
Wen Xiao Nuan.

405
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,759
I like you.

406
00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:11,160
Be with me.

407
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,839
I'm so envious of Fei Mo.

408
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:27,839
Xiao Bai.

409
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,279
I've booked your flight ticket for tonight.

410
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:30,480
You can go home now.

411
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:31,920
Aunt.

412
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:33,599
You're burning your bridges after the task is done.

413
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,960
(Boss Mo Yao)

414
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:01,559
(Boss Mo Yao)

415
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,480
Hello?

416
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,759
When are you coming back?

417
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:27,640
Soon.

418
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:29,599
Wait for me.

419
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:51,400
My goodness.

420
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,799
He said...

421
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,359
he likes me.

422
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:22,480
Let's go to work together.

423
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,359
Let's go to work together.

424
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,519
Let's go to work together.

425
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,519
Xiao Nuan.

426
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:45,240
Let's go to work together.

427
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:47,680
Mr. Ye.

428
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,480
I'm looking for Nuan Nuan.

429
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,920
She went to work early this morning.

430
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:55,160
Don't you know?

431
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,680
Never mind then.

432
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,079
Take good care of yourself over there.

433
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:37,680
Call me if you need anything.

434
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,000
Okay. Bye.

435
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:42,680
What's the matter, Mr. Ye?

436
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,799
Where's Wen Xiao Nuan?

437
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,720
She should be training.
Why isn't she in the office?

438
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,558
Wen Xiao Nuan has accepted the commercial shoot...

439
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:50,720
for Adolph Shampoo.

440
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:52,480
She has left for Changbai Mountains today.

441
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,039
Changbai Mountains?

442
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:55,480
Why don't I know about this?

443
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,200
Mr. Ye.

444
00:28:57,519 --> 00:28:59,880
I'm the one in charge of the artists' schedules.

445
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,480
You didn't stipulate...

446
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,480
that I had to report everything to you.

447
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,400
Then...

448
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:06,680
Then when is she coming back?

449
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:07,880
After a month.

450
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,639
The shoot at Changbai Mountains is arduous and tiring.

451
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,359
I initially wanted to turn it down for her,

452
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,318
but Adolph was very sincere.

453
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:16,559
They kept us in communication.

454
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,680
In the end, it was Xiao Nuan who insisted on accepting the job.

455
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,640
Actually,

456
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,440
I quite like this energy in Wen Xiao Nuan.

457
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,480
Goodbye, Mr. Ye.

458
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,160
Hello, Ye Fei Mo.

459
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:54,000
You finally picked up.

460
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,240
Ye Fei Mo.

461
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:56,920
What did you say?

462
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,640
Why is it so noisy there?

463
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,598
Early? No, it's not.

464
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:02,880
It's already afternoon.

465
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,240
Why didn't you tell me...

466
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:07,160
that you were going to Changbai Mountains?

467
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:09,960
Don't worry, I'm dressed warmly.

468
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,799
Be careful and come back early.

469
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,960
What did you say? I can't hear you.

470
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:21,640
I said, come home early.

471
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:23,160
I...

472
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:32,640
I miss you.
