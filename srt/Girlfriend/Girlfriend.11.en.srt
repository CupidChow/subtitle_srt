1
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,840
Thank you.

2
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,519
Ye Fei Mo?

3
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,079
Why are you here?

4
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,719
He's not here to apologize to me, is he?

5
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,280
Let me tell you.

6
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,158
We're even now.

7
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,439
Stop harassing me.

8
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,799
Don't flatter yourself, Ms. Wen.

9
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,040
I live on the 35th floor now.

10
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,760
I'm your upstairs neighbor.

11
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:09,719
What?

12
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,879
He really closed the doors.

13
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,159
Nuan Nuan, you're back.

14
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,318
Are you tired?

15
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,919
Don't mention it. I just...

16
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,840
Why are you...

17
00:02:39,841 --> 00:02:41,718
He's the one I told you about.

18
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:43,039
Director Li's driver, Xiao Gu.

19
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,559
We went to the supermarket together.

20
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,599
So I asked him to have hot pot with us.

21
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:47,759
He's the driver? He's not...

22
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,199
Hello.

23
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,759
I'm Gu Yun Zhou.

24
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,479
Nice to meet you.

25
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:58,120
I'll let you two talk.

26
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,679
You must be tired after a day of work.

27
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,599
Let me put your bag down, okay?

28
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:07,479
By the way,

29
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,039
Jia Yi and I bought a lot of Adolph shampoo...

30
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:10,599
at the supermarket today.

31
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,319
You can have one.

32
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,039
Hold on. Why are you with Jia Yi?

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,240
Why are you here?

34
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,680
Why don't you two sit down and talk?

35
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,280
- Please don't tell her. - Come here.

36
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,280
Okay. Let's talk over there. Come.

37
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,759
Nuan Nuan, come here.

38
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,759
Come here.

39
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,360
- Have a seat. - Okay.

40
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:47,478
Nuan Nuan, didn't you say you wanted to have hot pot two days ago?

41
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:48,719
I prepared it especially for you.

42
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:50,639
Yes.

43
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:52,399
Let's also welcome our new friend,

44
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,840
the driver Xiao Gu.

45
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,120
What else do you want to eat?

46
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:59,360
I'll get it for you.

47
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,439
I think the pork balls are good.

48
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That's right.

49
00:04:05,001 --> 00:04:06,879
I bought them with him.
They're quite fresh, right?

50
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:08,919
No wonder.

51
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:12,079
Pork balls taste like meatballs,

52
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,400
but they're full of starch and elastin.

53
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,609
These pork balls pretend to be meatballs to fool us.

54
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:19,610
Isn't it tired?

55
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:26,078
Who cares if it's tired?

56
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:27,610
All that matters is that it's delicious, right?

57
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,438
The only difference...

58
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:32,439
between pork balls and meatballs is the taste.

59
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,239
So tell me.

60
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,559
If a wolf...

61
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,480
puts on sheep's clothing and mingles with the sheep,

62
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,399
is it good or bad?

63
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:51,839
The wolf...

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,199
just wants to be friends with the sheep.

65
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,680
Why does it deceive others?

66
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:02,278
- It... - Nuan Nuan, what are you saying?

67
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:03,519
I don't understand.

68
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's nothing.

69
00:05:05,001 --> 00:05:07,319
I'm just studying this pork ball.

70
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:11,079
Why do I feel like you're insinuating something?

71
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,560
Here.

72
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,639
- Eat up. - Jia Yi.

73
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,279
A dinner table is a society.

74
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,879
That's why...

75
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,610
you always have to be careful.

76
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,439
Here, I'll give you a pork ball.

77
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,839
Okay, thank you.

78
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,560
Let's have a toast.

79
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,039
- Here. Let's welcome our driver. - Welcome.

80
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,198
- Xiao Gu. - Xiao Gu.

81
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,720
Nice to meet you.

82
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:57,920
Nuan Nuan,

83
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:00,119
I remember when I was in college,

84
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,439
my first acting job...

85
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,519
was the role of a woman...

86
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,439
mourning for her late husband.

87
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,999
I was so nervous.

88
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,279
I was even stuttering.

89
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,000
I made all the actors laugh.

90
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,719
I turned a funeral scene...

91
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,079
into a comedy.

92
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,518
Let me tell you.

93
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:45,519
One time,

94
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,439
I played a Godzilla monster.

95
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,120
Then they made me fight Ultraman.

96
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,999
I didn't know how to fight Ultraman.

97
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
How could I do it?

98
00:06:54,001 --> 00:06:55,599
The dinosaur was so angry.

99
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,920
Then I said...

100
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,639
Who's that? I'll go check.

101
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:01,120
I'll do it. You can keep eating.

102
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,800
Slow down.

103
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:08,920
Why are you here?

104
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:10,399
Have you been drinking?

105
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,439
You're disturbing me.

106
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,079
Disturbing you?

107
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:18,040
Ye Fei Mo, don't pick a fight.

108
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:20,398
We are drinking, chatting, and eating normally.

109
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,519
It's none of your business.

110
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:22,920
"We"?

111
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,839
I'm warning you. Don't disturb us.

112
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,560
We're going to bed now. Good night.

113
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:34,160
Drinking with a man in the middle of the night?

114
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:36,519
Nuan Nuan, what's wrong?

115
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,720
Was that Mr. Ye just now?

116
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,439
Don't mind him. He's a nuisance.

117
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:44,600
Let's eat.

118
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,480
- Eat more. - Why did Mr. Ye come here?

119
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:50,879
He has too much free time.

120
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,759
How dare she chase me away?

121
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,120
And "we"?

122
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,319
Here.

123
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,759
Be careful, it's hot.

124
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,240
Have some vegetables.

125
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,680
You should eat too.

126
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:18,000
(Come to my place. I need your help with something.)

127
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:19,480
The hot pot is delicious.

128
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,920
(I'm having dinner. Talk later.)

129
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,878
(My address is Apt. 3501, Unit 1, Building 133,)

130
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:41,209
(Lihu Xiangzhang Garden, Ningze South Rd., Beijiang.)

131
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,279
(Come now.)

132
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,919
Eat more.

133
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,399
It's rush hour for designated drivers, isn't it?

134
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,090
You should go. Don't worry about us.

135
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,799
I'll get going, then.

136
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,878
It's not easy to be a designated driver.

137
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:58,960
Go on.

138
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:01,279
I'll get going, then.

139
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:03,039
- It was nice to meet you. - Bye.

140
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:04,960
- I'll see him out. - Go ahead.

141
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:09,879
Drive safely.

142
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You don't have to walk me out.

143
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Go back. Bye.

144
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,450
Bye.

145
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:35,159
That was fast.

146
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,240
You told me to come.

147
00:09:37,241 --> 00:09:38,519
I had to come right away.

148
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:41,840
This is nice.

149
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,720
Why are you wearing this?

150
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,210
What's wrong with it?

151
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:54,090
It's unsightly.

152
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:56,090
Do my clothes offend you?

153
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:58,480
Do me a favor.

154
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,600
I'm throwing a party.

155
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,759
You want to throw a party?

156
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,480
Are you okay?

157
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,159
Cut the crap.

158
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,720
Help me find as many people as possible.

159
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,279
When?

160
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:10,759
Now. Here.

161
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,240
Now?

162
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:14,759
What time is it?

163
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:15,759
Where can I find people for you?

164
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,799
I don't care.

165
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,519
Just gather everyone in an hour.

166
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:20,039
It doesn't matter who is coming.

167
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,639
The more, the merrier.

168
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,600
Okay.

169
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,000
Jia Yi.

170
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,639
Let me ask you something.

171
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:48,239
Did you submit my resume...

172
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,919
to Anning?

173
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,000
How did it go? Did you get a reply?

174
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:55,039
Ye Fei Mo came to see me.

175
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:58,279
He offered me an S-class management contract.

176
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,840
But I turned it down.

177
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,279
You turned it down?

178
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:04,039
Anning's S-class contract?

179
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,799
Are you stupid?

180
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,038
That's a dream offer...

181
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:09,799
for so many people.

182
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:13,759
But Anning belongs to Ye Fei Mo.

183
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,159
So what?

184
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:19,200
Isn't it better to have him take care of you in the company?

185
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,600
Him take care of me?

186
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,479
I'll be lucky if he doesn't torture me.

187
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,518
You don't know what an evil demon he is.

188
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,639
Evil demon?

189
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:28,239
I think this demon...

190
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,039
is very docile in front of you.

191
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,158
Don't be fooled by him.

192
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,278
Enough. Let's not talk about him before bed.

193
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,518
I can't sleep when I'm angry.

194
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:38,079
- Okay? Let's go to bed early. - Okay.

195
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,159
- Good night, Jia Yi. - Good night.

196
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:41,679
Lie down.

197
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,519
- Good night. - Good night.

198
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,840
- Good night. - Good night.

199
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,879
Everyone is here.

200
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,120
Let's get started.

201
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:21,200
Aren't you going to say anything?

202
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,720
Say what?

203
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:24,799
The more, the merrier.

204
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,720
Lead the dance.

205
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,480
You want me to lead?

206
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,159
I finally know what you want.

207
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,239
Listen to me, everyone.

208
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,079
I'll play some music in a bit.

209
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,240
Just have fun, all right?

210
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,320
You, come here.

211
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:35,600
Okay.

212
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:41,079
Didn't you tell me that they're all clubbers?

213
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,919
How come they're not moving?

214
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:45,840
Maybe your song is too unfamiliar.

215
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:47,440
No one is familiar with it.

216
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:50,440
How about this? Play something they know.

217
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:51,919
I can dance to anything.

218
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,039
Go. Play it yourself.

219
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,080
Okay.

220
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,559
Let's dance!

221
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:14,399
I live on the 35th floor now.

222
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:16,120
I'm your upstairs neighbor.

223
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:21,919
Ye Fei Mo.

224
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,639
Nuan Nuan,

225
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:32,759
why is it so noisy upstairs?

226
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:35,639
Ye Fei Mo.

227
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,159
You just wait.

228
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,240
Nuan Nuan.

229
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Nuan Nuan!

230
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:01,679
Jump!

231
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,879
Ms. Wen.

232
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:10,679
What is it?

233
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,600
Nuan Nuan.

234
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:23,759
- It stopped. - Who is that?

235
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:24,959
What are you doing?

236
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,319
What's going on?

237
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,960
Ye Fei Mo, what do you want?

238
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,399
Ms. Wen,

239
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,278
you came to my place and interrupted my gathering.

240
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,558
I should be the one asking you that.

241
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:33,559
You...

242
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,039
Forget it. What a killjoy.

243
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,600
That's all for today. You may go.

244
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:41,558
That's it for today.

245
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:42,840
Thank you, everyone.

246
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,159
Get going. Thank you.

247
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,879
Let's go.

248
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,518
Sir.

249
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,759
Sir, it's over. Sir.

250
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
We're giving out money.

251
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,279
Go outside.

252
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,799
- Get your money outside. - Get my money.

253
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,279
It's outside.

254
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:03,879
Nuan Nuan.

255
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,650
What's going on?

256
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,720
Don't go.

257
00:17:10,721 --> 00:17:12,118
You haven't paid me yet.

258
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,170
What's the rush?

259
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,319
Gu Yun Zhou.

260
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,480
You

261
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:19,920
Jia Yi, I...

262
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,119
Jia Yi.

263
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:26,410
Where's the money? Give it to me.

264
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,359
Here.

265
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,240
Jia Yi.

266
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:38,960
Let me explain.

267
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:50,720
I'm sorry.

268
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:53,799
Actually, I was hiding something from you.

269
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:55,890
Actually, I...

270
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:57,759
Can you not do this kind of part-time job anymore?

271
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,119
I know you're short of money.

272
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:03,889
But this kind of thing harms you more than it benefits you.

273
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,079
Can you stop doing it?

274
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,960
Okay.

275
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,319
I won't do it anymore.

276
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,039
Mr. Ye did it on purpose.

277
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,518
Besides, I'm just a worker.

278
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:15,598
There's nothing I can do.

279
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:17,799
Rich people are so unreasonable.

280
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,039
They have such a love-hate relationship.

281
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,599
I thought you didn't like rich people.

282
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:28,440
It's fine as long as he's serious about Nuan Nuan.

283
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,119
I should have told him sooner.

284
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:37,890
Nothing.

285
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,319
Don't blame yourself.

286
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,758
Maybe Mr. Ye did it...

287
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:46,079
to attract Nuan Nuan's attention.

288
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,599
But I'm afraid...

289
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,119
it will backfire.

290
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,680
Backfire?

291
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,759
It's getting late. Go home and rest.

292
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,170
Okay, you rest early too.

293
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:01,839
- Bye. - Bye.

294
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:14,759
What were you all doing here?

295
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:16,759
Having a party.

296
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,240
A party in the middle of the night?

297
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,599
You can have hot pot with someone.

298
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:23,170
Why can't I have a party with people?

299
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,358
Sir, it's almost 2am.

300
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:27,410
You're disturbing people.

301
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:30,318
You're knocking on my door at 2am.

302
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:31,518
That's disturbing people too.

303
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:32,519
Please get out.

304
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:35,079
You're doing this on purpose, aren't you, Ye Fei Mo?

305
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:36,839
- Get out.
- What are you doing? Don't push me.

306
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:40,599
Open the door!

307
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:43,319
Ye Fei Mo, open the door.

308
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,440
Open the door!

309
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,440
Ye Fei Mo.

310
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,480
What are you doing?

311
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:52,278
Our partnership is terminated.

312
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:53,319
We're even now.

313
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,359
I just want to do what I like now.

314
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:56,920
Stop pestering me.

315
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:00,650
What are you doing?

316
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:01,889
It's so noisy.

317
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:03,839
Tenants have filed complaints against you.

318
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,240
I'm having a party, okay?

319
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:07,839
Fei Mo,

320
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,558
I told you we should go to bed early.

321
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:11,680
Look, it's so awful that we've disturbed everyone.

322
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,889
I'm sorry, sir.

323
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:15,358
My boyfriend is arguing with me.

324
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:16,409
He's mad at me.

325
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:17,519
I'm coaxing him now.

326
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,118
Maybe we were a bit loud.

327
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:21,440
I'm really sorry for disturbing the neighbors.

328
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:23,079
You have a way with words.

329
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,759
You have such a sensible girlfriend.

330
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,559
Why are you still so hot-tempered?

331
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:31,079
That's right.

332
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:32,200
Well,

333
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:33,889
I'm sorry for disturbing you, sir.

334
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:34,960
You should get back and rest.

335
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,480
Fight and make up.

336
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,240
It's getting late.

337
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,079
What were you doing?

338
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:52,480
Can't you see I'm covering for you?

339
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:55,000
You're covering for me by saying you're my girlfriend.

340
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,960
You like me.

341
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,719
You left your mansion and moved here.

342
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,169
Do you like me?

343
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:02,650
I can live wherever I want.

344
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:04,440
Don't flatter yourself.

345
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,649
The object of your affections...

346
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:07,720
is really unlucky.

347
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:08,759
You...

348
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,318
Ms. Cheng, I'm sorry I'm late. I was held up at the office.

349
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:25,650
It's all right. Have a seat.

350
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,519
Ms. Cheng, why did you ask me to come?

351
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,239
I wanted to see you...

352
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,439
because I wanted to ask you...

353
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,890
about this management contract.

354
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:39,920
This contract was personally authorized by Mr. Ye.

355
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:42,359
Fei Mo?

356
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,720
Then why wasn't it signed in the end?

357
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:47,279
Logically speaking,

358
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,890
Wen Xiao Nuan has no reason to reject it.

359
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:53,880
I think Wen Xiao Nuan...

360
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,920
doesn't want to have anything to do with Mr. Ye anymore.

361
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,518
By the way, Ms. Cheng,

362
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:02,558
do you know?

363
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,519
Mr. Ye moved into the apartment above Wen Xiao Nuan's home.

364
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,240
Really?

365
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,839
It looks like Fei Mo...

366
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:17,480
has fallen in love this time.

367
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:20,720
Do you mean...

368
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,640
After so many years,

369
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:24,599
Fei Mo can finally...

370
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,799
step out of that woman's shadow.

371
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:30,160
Isn't Huangmei opera outdated?

372
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:33,359
It doesn't suit young people's preferences nowadays.

373
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:35,279
Instead of catering to them,

374
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,440
it's better to create a unique trend.

375
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:39,479
Vintage and nostalgia...

376
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,480
have been the talk of the town lately.

377
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,200
It's also a breakthrough that everyone wants to try.

378
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:45,839
I think "Blue Galaxy"...

379
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,720
is perfect for Huangmei opera.

380
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,838
Mr. Ye, you've always valued...

381
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:52,559
big data commercialization elements.

382
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,240
Why are you suddenly talking about emotions?

383
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:04,160
Hanging fruit on the shelf

384
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:06,798
If you're making something traditional,

385
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,240
you need to draw inspiration from traditional opera.

386
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,359
Because emotions...

387
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:14,759
are the resonating force...

388
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,319
that drives audiences.

389
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,079
They can also help us...

390
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:22,640
be more successful in business.

391
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,960
Hello, Linda.

392
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,960
It's Aurora's Jiang Fang.

393
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,680
Hello, Mr. Jiang.

394
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,839
How can I help you?

395
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,400
Here's the thing.

396
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:44,400
Last time, at Ms. Han Hui's homecoming party,

397
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,639
I invited her to be in Aurora's promotional video.

398
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,759
I wonder what she thinks about it.

399
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:51,960
Mr. Jiang, it's like this.

400
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:54,920
Ms. Han Hui just came back.

401
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,519
She has to handle a lot of things herself.

402
00:23:57,599 --> 00:23:58,880
She can't find the time.

403
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:02,279
Why don't we forget about this collaboration?

404
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:06,039
Can I talk to her?

405
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,000
I'm sorry.

406
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:13,400
Ms. Han is having dinner with a friend.

407
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,200
Maybe next time.

408
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:17,000
What bad timing.

409
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,960
I'll talk to you next time.

410
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:24,240
She's not even answering her phone.

411
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,119
Isn't she afraid of offending Aurora?

412
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,680
I'll tell my brother...

413
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,999
not to play any of Han Hui's movies in our theaters...

414
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
in the future.

415
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,519
Doing that will just make me look incompetent.

416
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:35,440
What then? Just let her be?

417
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:37,960
I made the wrong decision.

418
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:40,279
I didn't give her what she wanted.

419
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,160
What else do you want to give her?

420
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,278
We've already given her...

421
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:45,920
the best treatment and contract terms.

422
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:47,759
With her qualifications,

423
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,039
she can get that from any company.

424
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,880
What do you mean?

425
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,319
What she wants is Ye Fei Mo.

426
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,279
But Ye Fei Mo will never sign her again.

427
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:04,000
At the homecoming banquet,

428
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,640
I could tell.

429
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:09,119
Their relationship is very delicate.

430
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:14,039
Do we have to give Ye Fei Mo to her...

431
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:16,160
to get her to sign with Aurora?

432
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:17,400
We can't give him to her.

433
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,720
If we give him to her, we won't get what we want.

434
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:22,559
She wants what she can't have.

435
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:25,279
This is an opportunity for us.

436
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:27,798
We must create...

437
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:29,240
a good opportunity...

438
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:31,119
to intervene in their relationship.

439
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,880
Who is it? I'm coming.

440
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,160
Wen Xiao Nuan, don't open the door!

441
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,000
Xiao Kai?

442
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,240
Don't open the door!

443
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,719
You...

444
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,799
Get inside.

445
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:45,879
- Come here. - Xiao Kai!

446
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,880
You...

447
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,920
What's wrong?

448
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,440
Xiao Kai, are you all right?

449
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,480
I'm fine.

450
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:58,200
(Xiao Nuan is in trouble. Come quickly to my place.)

451
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,440
Let me tell you.

452
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,200
You can hit me, but don't bully my sister.

453
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:09,279
What are you doing?

454
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,359
Jia Yi.

455
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,279
Who are you people?

456
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,079
Who are we?

457
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,759
You'll have to ask your good brother.

458
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,640
Xiao Kai, what's going on?

459
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,799
What are you doing?

460
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:28,039
Xiao Nuan, they're debt collectors.

461
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,399
Hello, do you have an appointment?

462
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,639
- Isn't this the famous Han Hui?
- I think so.

463
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,839
You can't enter without an appointment.

464
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,559
You can't enter without an appointment.

465
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,200
Are you new here?

466
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:45,759
How dare you stop Ms. Han?

467
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:47,358
Do you know what relationship...

468
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:48,559
Ms. Han and Mr. Ye have?

469
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:53,639
Fei Mo, something happened at Wen Xiao Nuan's home.

470
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,839
I'm on my way there.

471
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,640
Okay, you go first. I'll be right there.

472
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:03,160
- Fei Mo. - Why are you here?

473
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,439
I heard the "Blue Galaxy" project is being rebooted.

474
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,518
I'm here to talk to you about a collaboration.

475
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:07,598
Ms. Han,

476
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:09,279
we have a designated project manager for such things.

477
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,400
But "Blue Galaxy" is our project.

478
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,759
Not anymore.

479
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:15,719
I made a reservation at a restaurant.

480
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,160
We can talk over a meal.

481
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:18,359
I have something to do.

482
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,880
See her out.

483
00:27:19,881 --> 00:27:20,920
Where are you going?
