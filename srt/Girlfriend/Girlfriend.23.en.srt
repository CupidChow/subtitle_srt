1
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,120
The lead actor of "Blue Galaxy" is Mo Xiao Bai?

2
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,400
My goodness.

3
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,040
Who is it?

4
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:58,439
Who is it?

5
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:01,359
Don't come any closer.

6
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,560
If you come any closer, I'll call the nurse.

7
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,000
Xiao Nuan, it's me.

8
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:10,919
Mo Xiao Bai?

9
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:12,399
Why are you here?

10
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,530
Have a seat.

11
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,038
I'm sorry. I didn't tidy up today.

12
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:23,159
I'm a bit ugly.

13
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,370
It's all right.

14
00:02:25,371 --> 00:02:26,479
My cousin-in-law always looks good.

15
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:29,639
Cousin-in-law?

16
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:30,960
Yes.

17
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:33,120
Ye Fei Mo is my younger cousin.

18
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,399
Aren't you his girlfriend?

19
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,400
So you're my cousin-in-law.

20
00:02:35,401 --> 00:02:36,599
We're not...

21
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,120
Sooner or later, you will be.

22
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,199
But it's not easy to get the iceberg...

23
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,719
to confess his love.

24
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,960
Xiao Nuan, don't worry.

25
00:02:44,961 --> 00:02:46,000
I'll help you.

26
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:48,360
Wait.

27
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,439
You said Ye Fei Mo is your cousin.

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,560
Why didn't he tell me?

29
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,919
And you're the lead actor of "Blue Galaxy".

30
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,439
I didn't know either.

31
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,520
Can I have your autograph?

32
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,439
Well...

33
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,719
I've seen all your movies.

34
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,879
And you look more handsome one after the other.

35
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:17,919
You're even more handsome in person.

36
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:21,080
You can get my autograph.

37
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,560
When you've recovered,

38
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:24,519
I'll eat, drink, and sleep with you.

39
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,240
As long as you like it, I'll go through with it.

40
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:28,240
No. That's not necessary.

41
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:34,360
Thank you.

42
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,878
By the way,

43
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,159
thank you for bringing me to the hospital.

44
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,039
It's okay. It's what I should do.

45
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,520
I'm being held up by something.

46
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,479
If I had joined the team earlier,

47
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,639
I would have been able to protect you.

48
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,680
Xiao Nuan.

49
00:03:47,681 --> 00:03:48,839
Your injury this time...

50
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,360
really scared my cousin.

51
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,080
He was pale and his hands were shaking.

52
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,400
He didn't know what to do and was all over the place.

53
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:57,758
He couldn't sit still.

54
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:59,000
It's the first time I've seen him like this.

55
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,879
His face and hands...

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,319
were all pale and trembling.

57
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:13,120
The patient needs to rest. Leave now.

58
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,049
The patient's mood is important too.

59
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,170
Look how happy Xiao Nuan is.

60
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,240
If you don't leave now,

61
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,480
I'll call the nurse.

62
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:25,879
FIne.

63
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,800
Both of you are the same.

64
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:30,639
You love to call the nurse.

65
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:31,759
Bye, Xiao Nuan.

66
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,239
Bye, Xiao Bai.

67
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,730
- I'll miss you. - I'll miss you too.

68
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:37,439
- Bye. - Bye.

69
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,199
I...

70
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,839
I wasn't like what Xiao Bai said.

71
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,439
Like what?

72
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,610
What else do you want to eat?

73
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,560
I'll buy it for you.

74
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,319
There's nothing I want to eat.

75
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,050
But I have a request.

76
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,319
What is it?

77
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:14,439
I want to be discharged.

78
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,050
No.

79
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,399
But other requests can be discussed.

80
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:19,879
Look, I've recovered...

81
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,680
Are you okay?

82
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:26,680
I told you not to push yourself.

83
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,799
Director Li, will "Blue Galaxy" change its female lead?

84
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,438
During the casting process, Han Hui was a popular choice.

85
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:33,439
Will you consider Han Hui?

86
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,639
As the director of "Blue Galaxy",

87
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,399
I never received any notification about any casting change.

88
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:00,600
Han Hui, what's wrong?

89
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,480
Anning refuses to replace her.

90
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:06,599
Wen Xiao Nuan is badly injured.

91
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,958
He still doesn't want to replace her?

92
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:10,279
In Ye Fei Mo's heart, I'm no match for a rookie!

93
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,240
Han Hui.

94
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,480
Go and see who it is. Tidy up.

95
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,480
Ms. Han.

96
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:43,759
How can I help you?

97
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,519
I'm here to talk to you about the contract.

98
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,040
Take a look at this.

99
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,399
("Magpie Bridge")

100
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:11,000
Thank you.

101
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,079
Let me.

102
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,720
What do you think, Ms. Han?

103
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:42,360
Are you interested?

104
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,959
From storytelling to character design,

105
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:47,879
to the scheduling.

106
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:50,839
Mr. Jiang.

107
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,319
You couldn't get "Blue Galaxy",

108
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,759
so you got me a bootleg.

109
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,079
As long as you're in it,

110
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,759
then it's the real deal.

111
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,120
Ms. Han.

112
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,439
Are you really willing...

113
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,920
to be outdone by a rookie?

114
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,319
Don't you want to win?

115
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,800
You want to win against Anning.

116
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,600
If you agree to sign with Aurora Film,

117
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,519
our team will be the best.

118
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,079
I look forward to our cooperation.

119
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:27,480
Likewise.

120
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,480
Come in.

121
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,330
Nuan Nuan.

122
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:52,799
Why are you here?

123
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:55,879
Nuan Nuan, don't be angry.

124
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,679
I'm here on behalf of the investors of "Blue Galaxy".

125
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,559
Thank you, Aurora Film and Mr. Jiang.

126
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,679
I'm a little tired. I want to rest.

127
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:04,799
You can go back.

128
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,799
Nuan Nuan.

129
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:28,960
Do we really have nothing to say to each other?

130
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,799
What do you think?

131
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,120
I always thought...

132
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,279
that you were gentle,

133
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,240
attentive,

134
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,039
and considerate.

135
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:48,720
You listened to everything I said.

136
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,120
What bad taste.

137
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:55,090
I used to think...

138
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,210
that we could be together forever.

139
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,480
We'd get married,

140
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,480
have kids,

141
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,600
and grow old together.

142
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,240
But now I know...

143
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:10,639
that all my feelings were wrong.

144
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:13,360
You chose another path.

145
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,559
I don't understand.

146
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:20,679
But I respect your choice.

147
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,879
If you're still sincere to me,

148
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:26,279
if you still respect me,

149
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:30,159
please leave me alone.

150
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:32,559
Nuan Nuan.

151
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,330
Everything I did was for you.

152
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,360
I wanted us to have a better future.

153
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:40,758
I wanted to pamper you each and every day.

154
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:42,209
I wanted to buy us a bigger house.

155
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,329
I wanted you to buy whatever you wanted.

156
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:45,360
I'm just...

157
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,120
choosing a path...

158
00:10:47,121 --> 00:10:49,159
that's easier to achieve my goals.

159
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,089
I don't want to give you these when you're old.

160
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,120
Do you understand?

161
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,159
- Nuan Nuan, I... - Jiang Fang.

162
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,039
No matter how much I hate Jiang Ling Er,

163
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,120
she's already your fiancée.

164
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,720
You've already let me down.

165
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,679
Don't let another woman down.

166
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,039
So I can only let myself down?

167
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,559
That's your problem.

168
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:31,919
It has nothing to do with me.

169
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:39,240
Wen Xiao Nuan.

170
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:41,759
Have you fallen for Ye Fei Mo?

171
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,200
That's my business.

172
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:53,960
It's none of yours.

173
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,120
Okay.

174
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,840
Take care.

175
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:33,759
Mr. Ye.

176
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:36,720
You and Wen Xiao Nuan are from two different worlds.

177
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,320
You'll only hurt her.

178
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,440
You're the one who has hurt her so much.

179
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,600
You have no right to say that to me.

180
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,039
Stay away from Wen Xiao Nuan.

181
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:54,840
There are so many scandals revolving around you.

182
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,080
It's easy for you to find a girlfriend.

183
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,000
Your feelings for her is just a whim.

184
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,960
Why are you so persistent?

185
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,120
I'm not the one who's persistent.

186
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,039
It's you.

187
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,399
She and I were childhood friends.

188
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,000
I know everything about her.

189
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,320
Can you compete with that?

190
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:12,919
I know what she likes.

191
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,558
I know what movies she likes to watch,

192
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:15,559
what songs she likes to sing,

193
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,320
what she likes and doesn't like to eat.

194
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,320
Wen Xiao Nuan is a sentimental person.

195
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,720
She will come back to me.

196
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:29,039
Only people who are not confident will bluff.

197
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:41,360
Wen Xiao Nuan likes champagne roses,

198
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,720
not lilies.

199
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,360
Are you angry?

200
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,360
Ye Fei Mo.

201
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:24,918
Are you here to see the patient...

202
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:26,320
or make them angry?

203
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:36,159
What do you like?

204
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,159
What do you hate?

205
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,480
What movies do you like to watch?

206
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,240
What songs do you listen to?

207
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,759
What food do you like to eat?

208
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:44,720
What food do you hate?

209
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,399
- What do you like? - You...

210
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:58,759
I like acting.

211
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:02,000
What movies do you like?

212
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,119
"Blue Sea and Blue Sky."

213
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,240
"Blue Sea and Blue Sky."

214
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,600
What color do you like?

215
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:10,720
Blue.

216
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:11,799
What do you hate?

217
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:15,200
I hate chauvinism.

218
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,519
What food do you not like?

219
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,720
I like all kinds of food.

220
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,799
Then what kind of food do you like?

221
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,519
Crawfish.

222
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,919
Do you like small animals?

223
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,799
I like cats and dogs.

224
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,279
What songs do you like?

225
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:33,719
"Cowherd and Weaver Girl".

226
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,279
Who was your elementary school language teacher?

227
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:39,600
Why are you asking so many questions these days?

228
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,519
Well...

229
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,279
The company is making profiles for our artists.

230
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:47,200
Do you have experience raising animals?

231
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,600
Ye Fei Mo, it's time for my check-up.

232
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,519
I'll wait for you. We'll continue when I get back.

233
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:57,320
There's more?

234
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,320
On my beloved scooter

235
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,960
I never get stuck in traffic

236
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,639
My goodness.

237
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,080
Isn't this a supercar?

238
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,279
Hello, everyone.

239
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,799
I just came to the big city,

240
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,919
and my sister already bought me a car.

241
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,440
I said I didn't need it.

242
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,919
My sister said it's a means of transportation.

243
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,639
Look, the sports car isn't even as tall as me.

244
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:45,999
I said she spent too much.

245
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,038
But my sister couldn't help it.

246
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,399
She's doing too well.

247
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:50,480
So...

248
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,879
My goodness.

249
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:55,639
Sorry, I didn't touch it. It just came up itself.

250
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:02,919
You're that...

251
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:05,650
Aren't you that...

252
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,118
That...

253
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,240
That one who sings.

254
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:09,959
That one. Who is it again?

255
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,079
It's on the tip of my tongue.

256
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:12,839
The influencer-singer.

257
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:14,559
Right?

258
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,440
Your jaw has recovered well.

259
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:19,000
Are you still dating that model girlfriend?

260
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,119
When did you buy a used car?

261
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,000
Take a good look...

262
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,599
at who I am.

263
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,410
My goodness.

264
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,118
If you didn't let me take a good look,

265
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:31,359
I wouldn't have noticed.

266
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,039
You had eye surgery.

267
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:36,200
My goodness, you're doing good.

268
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:37,440
Did you get it done in Korea?

269
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,170
Everything is 100% original.

270
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:40,650
Come on.

271
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,839
Everyone knows what you used to look like.

272
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:44,359
There's no one else here now.

273
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:45,559
It's just the two of us.

274
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,920
Let's have a heart-to-heart talk.

275
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:50,649
Tell me what you influencers do every day.

276
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:52,410
Give me some tea of your circle.

277
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,920
- Do you want to hear it? - Yes.

278
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:06,440
Ridiculous.

279
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:09,480
Idiot.

280
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:11,599
You...

281
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,078
I didn't touch the car.

282
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:15,999
It wasn't me. It...

283
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,839
Look, it moved on its own.

284
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,920
That little influencer has quite a temper.

285
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,960
I can do it too.

286
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,480
Ridiculous.

287
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:42,279
- Here to see your sister again? - Yes.

288
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:43,599
I...

289
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,599
Go in. Wen Xiao Nuan is inside.

290
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:46,839
- Okay. - Okay.

291
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:50,799
- You're here for my cousin-in-law? - You're here for my sister?

292
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,039
Rest well.

293
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,410
Remember what the doctor said.

294
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,680
Okay.

295
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:14,559
Xiao Nuan, Fei Mo.

296
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:16,359
Xiao Nuan, Fei Mo.

297
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,000
Why are you here together?

298
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:19,599
I...

299
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,409
Xiao Nuan, I made this bone soup for you.

300
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,680
Drink it while it's hot. It's nutritious.

301
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,200
Xiao Nuan, I made noodles for you.

302
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,480
You must eat this first.

303
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:29,559
She can't eat noodles now.

304
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,720
That thing is fattening.

305
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:32,838
The patient has to drink nutritious soup now.

306
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:33,839
Xiao Kai.

307
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:34,890
It's fattening.

308
00:19:34,891 --> 00:19:37,039
My cousin-in-law said I'm her idol.

309
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,358
Her idol made her noodles.

310
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:39,440
Of course she has to eat mine first.

311
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:40,559
Right, Xiao Nuan?

312
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,200
Fei Mo, the soup comes first, right?

313
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,799
She has already eaten.

314
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,599
And how many times have I told you?

315
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:50,759
Don't call her your cousin-in-law.

316
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:52,839
Has she really eaten?

317
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:54,759
Fei Mo.

318
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:56,359
You haven't confessed yet?

319
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,170
Aunt is anxious.

320
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,759
It's none of your business.

321
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,170
Since you're not anxious...

322
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:10,599
Xiao Nuan.

323
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,359
A man who hesitates so much...

324
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:14,359
must not love you enough.

325
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,039
Look at him.

326
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:18,410
He's not affable,

327
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,279
not funny or humorous.

328
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:22,359
He's perverted and evil.

329
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:25,480
My cousin-in-law... No.

330
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:27,650
Nuan Nuan.

331
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:29,759
Give it a thought.

332
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,319
Come to the US with me after the shoot.

333
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:33,319
I guarantee I have more merits than him.

334
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,799
You'll be happier than being with him.

335
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:41,409
Let go of her.

336
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:42,558
Why aren't you doing anything, Fei Mo?

337
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,480
No, who do you think you are?

338
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,000
I'm telling you. Stay away from my sister.

339
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,519
In my heart, I only have one brother-in-law.

340
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,960
Give me your hand.

341
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:55,079
And that's Ye Fei Mo.

342
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,410
Xiao Kai.

343
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:03,680
Simon.

344
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:05,440
I'm here. Where are you?

345
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:07,079
It's good.

346
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:08,559
Okay.

347
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:10,960
I wonder if you're interested...

348
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:12,079
in the project I just mentioned.

349
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:17,319
Mr. Gu.

350
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,118
Mr. Chen, what you mentioned is very novel.

351
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:22,119
I think it has a lot of potential.

352
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:31,240
Come on, let's go up.

353
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:32,680
Up?

354
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:33,759
That's right.

355
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:36,319
The investor we're meeting today is a big shot.

356
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,759
It's impossible for him to show up in such a public place.

357
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,519
Fei Mo and I think...

358
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,279
it's quite good.

359
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:53,680
- This way, please. - Okay, please.

360
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,200
What are you doing?

361
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,480
They say...

362
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:17,160
if I keep looking at a food,

363
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,119
through my imagination,

364
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,200
in my mind and in my mouth,

365
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:22,759
I'll be able to taste that food.

366
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,640
Childish.

367
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:30,599
Crawfish.

368
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,000
- You don't like it? - I do.

369
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,039
But I can't peel it with my hands.

370
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,880
It smells so good.

371
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:28,720
What are you doing? Stop it.

372
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,480
It's delicious.

373
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,759
Here.

374
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:51,160
What are you eating?

375
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,519
What are you eating?

376
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,758
You can't eat spicy food because of your injury.

377
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:01,039
It's not good for your recovery.

378
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:02,559
Didn't I tell you?

379
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,079
Why didn't you tell me?

380
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:08,160
All right.

381
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,440
If you want to recover soon, stop eating it.

382
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,160
Well, it's a rare occasion for you to peel crayfish for me.

383
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,920
You...

384
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,920
I can't eat the crayfish anymore.

385
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,279
And my recovery is delayed.

386
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,000
You have to compensate me.

387
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,880
How so?

388
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,240
Help me with my rehabilitation.

389
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,920
Go away!

390
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:44,279
Let go of me!

391
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,480
Let go!

392
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:47,119
Who is it?

393
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,200
Room service.

394
00:24:48,201 --> 00:24:49,240
I don't need it.

395
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:01,599
Wait for me.

396
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,720
Who are you? Do you know who I am?

397
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:17,359
Who are you?

398
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:20,680
You're a despicable thing.

399
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,680
Even a rat in the toilet is cleaner than you.

400
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,640
If you try to do something to Jia Yi again,

401
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,880
I'll do more than just beat you up.

402
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,160
Remember.

403
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,319
I'm the one who beat you up.

404
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:44,119
Gu Yun Zhou.

405
00:25:57,119 --> 00:25:58,119
Jia Yi.

406
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,599
Yun Zhou.

407
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,680
Let's go.

408
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,720
Let's go.

409
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,279
Here.

410
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:04,839
Jia Yi.

411
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:06,559
Trust me.

412
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,200
I won't let you suffer anymore.

413
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,000
It's okay now.

414
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,559
Don't tell Nuan Nuan about this.

415
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:29,559
She's still sick.

416
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:31,880
All right.

417
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:33,839
Get some rest.

418
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,599
That's enough practice.

419
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:48,799
Let's go back.

420
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,880
No.

421
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,759
I'll practice ten more minutes a day.

422
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:53,279
That way, I'll recover faster.

423
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:54,640
I can go back to the set earlier.

424
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,160
No, your health comes first.

425
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:02,559
I'm already holding up the filming schedule.

426
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,000
You'll lose a lot of money.

427
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:12,000
Anning doesn't care about that.

428
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:13,640
To Anning,

429
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,279
you're the most important asset.

430
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,880
I'm fine. I'm in great shape.

431
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:22,078
When I was in Fusheng Theater Troupe,

432
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:23,279
I always got injured.

433
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,960
Fusheng Theater Troupe?

434
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:29,518
I played five roles at once.

435
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:31,200
I get injured on one side of the stage,

436
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:32,758
went around the stage,

437
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:34,400
and continued to do somersaults on the other side.

438
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:35,599
Aren't I amazing?

439
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,960
The Fusheng Theater Troupe was by the sea.

440
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,759
It was beautiful.

441
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,519
By the sea?

442
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,680
Then you must be a good swimmer.

443
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,279
Of course.

444
00:28:57,519 --> 00:28:58,799
I saved people all the time.

445
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,199
There were always tourists...

446
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,719
who went into the sea even though they couldn't swim.

447
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,839
It was very dangerous.

448
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:09,160
I've saved so many people that I can't even remember.

449
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,200
Everyone in the troupe has saved people.

450
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,319
The boys saved more lives.

451
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:16,319
They're better swimmers.

452
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,920
Be careful.

453
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:24,359
Slowly.

454
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,400
- Are you okay? - I'm fine.

455
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,960
Let me try by myself.

456
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:38,480
Wen Xiao Nuan seems like a nice girl.

457
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:40,680
Are you taking her as a substitute for Han Hui,

458
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:43,319
or are you taking her for Wen Xiao Nuan herself?

459
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,359
Wen Xiao Nuan is different from her.

460
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,440
Wen Xiao Nuan is Wen Xiao Nuan.

461
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,119
The one and only Wen Xiao Nuan.

462
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,480
I don't just like Wen Xiao Nuan.

463
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:53,680
I must have her.
