1
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,280
It's you.

2
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:55,439
It's me.

3
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,719
What took you so long?

4
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,599
I was held up by something.

5
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:04,760
Didn't I tell you to contact me?

6
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,039
I'm sorry.

7
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,439
What are you talking about?

8
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,159
Didn't you see the missing person notice?

9
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,598
A missing person notice? Who is this?

10
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,639
5203, I'm waiting for you.

11
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,319
I saw it.

12
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:24,639
What does it have to do with me?

13
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,199
What are you doing?

14
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:35,530
You have a habit of kissing people randomly.

15
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:37,280
Where did you learn it?

16
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,719
What are you talking about?

17
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:43,280
Have you lost your memory at such a young age?

18
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:46,439
Mr. Ye.

19
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,719
Well,

20
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,240
these are...

21
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,680
health supplements that Ms. Cheng asked me to give you.

22
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,879
I'll leave them here.

23
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,759
Xiao Nuan,

24
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:01,159
take good care of Mr. Ye.

25
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:26,479
How did it go?

26
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:27,879
Have a seat.

27
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:30,039
He let her stay.

28
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:31,479
But...

29
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,080
But what?

30
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:35,680
I don't know if I was mistaken.

31
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,120
Mr. Ye seemed...

32
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,400
He seemed what? Tell me.

33
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,639
He seemed to want to kiss Wen Xiao Nuan.

34
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,999
Xiao Jing,

35
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,079
that proves we didn't get the wrong person.

36
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,120
But...

37
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:54,559
could it be that Mr. Ye still has feelings for Han Hui?

38
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,318
This Wen Xiao Nuan looks so much...

39
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,400
like Han Hui in the past.

40
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,319
Anyway, I won't allow Fei Mo...

41
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,240
to have anything to do with Han Hui again.

42
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Take off your clothes.

43
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,438
Take off your clothes.

44
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:25,680
No, Mr. Ye, you've misunderstood.

45
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,049
I'm not like that.

46
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,078
I'm a nurse.

47
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,170
I'm a senior nurse.

48
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:30,879
You're a nurse?

49
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,519
Well,

50
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:34,199
Ms. Zhou asked me to come.

51
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,518
I'm a senior nurse at Kangtai Nursing Center.

52
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:37,519
My name is Wen Xiao Nuan.

53
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:39,399
Mr. Ye,

54
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,049
Ms. Zhou said you're not feeling well.

55
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,239
Why don't you show me...

56
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,319
your medical report?

57
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,120
I can't give you my medical report.

58
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:48,170
There are many competitors out there...

59
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:49,839
who are keeping an eye on my health.

60
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:51,439
But...

61
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,759
you can examine me yourself.

62
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,759
There's a medical kit in the back room.

63
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,439
Go get it.

64
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,360
Is this it?

65
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,560
Please measure my blood pressure.

66
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Okay.

67
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:16,920
Mr. Ye,

68
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,759
is there an electronic blood pressure monitor?

69
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:19,959
What's wrong?

70
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,799
Do nurses these days not know...

71
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,519
how to use old-school instruments?

72
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:26,279
I can. Of course, I can.

73
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,560
Do you have any birthmarks?

74
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:42,079
Birthmarks?

75
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,360
No.

76
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,199
Are you sure?

77
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,600
Yes.

78
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,159
Do you really not have anything on your shoulders?

79
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,160
On my shoulders?

80
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,279
There is.

81
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,279
The responsibility of taking care of you.

82
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,560
You didn't put on the stethoscope.

83
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,920
I'm sorry.

84
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,319
You should be measuring blood pressure.

85
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,720
Blood...

86
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,160
I'm sorry.

87
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,359
Mr. Ye, your blood pressure is a bit high.

88
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,560
High blood pressure?

89
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,079
Look.

90
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:42,759
If it's not congenital,

91
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,759
then it's because...

92
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,479
of bad lifestyle habits...

93
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,679
and irregular routines...

94
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,919
such as staying up late, smoking, and drinking.

95
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,600
These are all the causes of high blood pressure.

96
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:56,800
I don't have high blood pressure.

97
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,399
And you're not a real nurse.

98
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:00,680
I am a nurse.

99
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:02,120
Get out.

100
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:04,639
I really am a nurse, Mr. Ye.

101
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,040
I really am!

102
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,719
- I really am a nurse. - Get out.

103
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,000
- I'm not leaving. - Come here.

104
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:12,959
Mr. Ye.

105
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,239
Mr. Ye.

106
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,479
Don't be like this.

107
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,480
Mr. Ye!

108
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:18,600
Mr. Ye, it's because...

109
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,399
Wait.

110
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,838
I'm like this because I'm too nervous.

111
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:23,839
In the past...

112
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,239
I'm really not like this, Mr. Ye.

113
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,318
Get out.

114
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,360
- Get out. - Mr. Ye.

115
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:30,838
- Mr. Ye, listen.
- Tell Xiao Jing that I fired you.

116
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:32,438
Mr. Ye, listen to me.

117
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:33,679
Mr. Ye, I really...

118
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,160
Give me another chance, Mr. Ye!

119
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,079
Fei Mo.

120
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:48,560
I already kicked out your fake nurse.

121
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,399
I don't have time to play these ridiculous games with you.

122
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,199
Wen Xiao Nuan.

123
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,839
Hello?

124
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,399
Hello, Xiao Jing.

125
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,119
Mr. Ye kicked me out.

126
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,638
Do you know the passcode?

127
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:11,799
I used a one-time visitor passcode.

128
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,439
Just find another way to get in.

129
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,758
Figure it out myself?

130
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:18,839
I...

131
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,319
If I get in,

132
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:21,919
I'll be trespassing.

133
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,959
No.

134
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,479
The owner of this property...

135
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,120
is Mr. Ye's mother, Ms. Cheng.

136
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,680
She gives you permission to go in.

137
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:29,600
Find a way to get in.

138
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,120
But I...

139
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:32,518
Hello?

140
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:33,559
Hello?

141
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:40,449
Why is Ye Fei Mo acting like a child?

142
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:41,758
How can he get angry...

143
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:43,240
at the drop of a hat?

144
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,999
I just got in, and now I've been kicked out.

145
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,559
The mission ended before it even started.

146
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:36,799
Ye Fei Mo's home passcode...

147
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:38,759
is quite simple.

148
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:40,840
Done.

149
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,480
Here I come.

150
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,759
How can I open this?

151
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,330
Delivery!

152
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,000
Delivery.

153
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,879
Deliv...

154
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:56,159
Surprise!

155
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,759
Young lady,

156
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:01,200
you had better leave.

157
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:03,960
I've seen a lot of people like you.

158
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:05,479
Every now and then,

159
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,759
I have to deal with one.

160
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:08,678
I don't understand.

161
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:11,039
Why are young girls like you...

162
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:13,398
so intent on marrying rich men?

163
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,918
Sir, I'm not that kind of person.

164
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:16,120
What do you mean you're not?

165
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,638
If not, why are you coming up with ways...

166
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:18,798
to sneak into Mr. Ye's house?

167
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:19,839
You don't understand.

168
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,959
You don't even know what is going on.

169
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,960
Do I not understand?

170
00:12:21,961 --> 00:12:23,279
You are trespassing!

171
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,120
Let's go.

172
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,200
Let's go to the police station.

173
00:12:26,201 --> 00:12:27,599
- Let's go. - I'm not going.

174
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,639
Go! Let's go.

175
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:31,080
What's wrong?

176
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,200
What...

177
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,840
What's wrong?

178
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,000
What's wrong?

179
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,159
Say something.

180
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,720
Are you being bullied?

181
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,559
Yes!

182
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,879
- Mr. Ye bullied me. - This...

183
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:54,799
Sir,

184
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:57,039
I'm actually...

185
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,960
I'm actually Mr. Ye's ex-wife.

186
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,440
Mr. Ye's ex-wife?

187
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,878
Recently, Aurora Film Co. has launched several projects.

188
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:10,959
They have shown their ambition
to replace Anning Culture...

189
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,600
as the industry's leader.

190
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,360
Sir.

191
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,278
Don't you think...

192
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:27,720
I should ask him for an explanation?

193
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,399
Yes.

194
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,600
You should.

195
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,840
Sir, can you lend me a ladder?

196
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:51,399
(Gu Yun Zhou invites you to a video call)

197
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,398
Fei Mo, have you seen the news?

198
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,399
Yes.

199
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,840
Aurora has been making...

200
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:00,200
big moves lately.

201
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,519
Are they trying to take advantage
of our trouble with "Hannan's Past"...

202
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:05,360
to become the industry's top dog?

203
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:06,879
They overestimate themselves.

204
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:08,200
What do you want?

205
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,200
I heard...

206
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,000
your mom got you a nurse.

207
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,639
She's gone.

208
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,399
Isn't it nice to have someone to take care of you?

209
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,320
Besides, Ms. Cheng won't harm you.

210
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:48,919
Fei Mo,

211
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,440
there's someone behind you.

212
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,240
There's a burglar in your house, Fei Mo!

213
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:57,039
So the nurse is back.

214
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,320
Wait.

215
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,080
Isn't she that 5203 girl?

216
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,799
I don't know her.

217
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,840
No matter what she says, just ignore her.

218
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,639
Young lady,

219
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:35,759
I really can't help you.

220
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,120
Let's go.

221
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:41,759
Let's go.

222
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:10,799
It's finally quiet.

223
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,159
Is Ye Fei Mo a demon?

224
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,120
Hi, Jia Yi.

225
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,639
Nuan Nuan, why aren't you home yet?

226
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,719
I'm on set.

227
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,960
I'm filming late at night.

228
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,279
It's so late, and you're still working.

229
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,840
Have you eaten?

230
00:16:57,841 --> 00:16:58,879
Are you hungry?

231
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,000
It's pouring outside.

232
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,000
Do you have an umbrella? I'll pick you up.

233
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,480
I'm fine, Jia Yi.

234
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:08,680
Don't worry.

235
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,240
You...

236
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:12,599
Have you made up with Jiang Fang?

237
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,039
Jiang Fang and I...

238
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,960
broke up.

239
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,960
So that's why you went drinking that day.

240
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,920
Why did you break up?

241
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:25,890
Weren't you two doing well?

242
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,199
Hello?

243
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,240
Hello, Jia Yi?

244
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,078
The signal is bad.

245
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:31,480
- I have to go. - Nuan Nuan.

246
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,798
All right, I'll call you if I need anything.

247
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,519
Okay, I'll call you sometime.

248
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,598
Jiang Fang, this is the most upscale neighborhood...

249
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:57,650
in Beijiang.

250
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,359
I think it suits us.

251
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,118
It's near the rivers and mountains.

252
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:02,480
I like the interior design too.

253
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,279
It's the perfect home for newlyweds.

254
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,169
Are you really going to buy this...

255
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:07,480
to be our home?

256
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:09,839
Yes, I've had my eye on it for a while.

257
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,839
I'll take this opportunity to tell my brother.

258
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,358
I've been interested in a flat in Linjiang.

259
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:15,759
I want my parents to live there.

260
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,649
It took me a long time to save up the money.

261
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:18,759
It's not even enough for the down payment.

262
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:21,440
How big is the Linjiang flat?

263
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:24,079
It's about 80m².

264
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,839
The down payment can't be much for 80m².

265
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,079
Jiang Fang, I didn't mean it.

266
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,959
It's okay. You're not wrong.

267
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,278
I'm just not good enough.

268
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:40,598
What are you talking about?

269
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:41,919
If you're not good enough,

270
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,480
I wouldn't be interested in you.

271
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:46,118
Also, you're now Aurora's production director.

272
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:47,119
What are you worried about?

273
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,078
It's pouring. Wait for me here. I'll get the car.

274
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,410
- Go. - Wait for me.

275
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:08,480
Dear God,

276
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:11,680
you're crying for me too,

277
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:13,720
aren't you?

278
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:16,319
Your family's Huangmei Opera Troupe...

279
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:17,759
Just give up on it.

280
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:20,169
The troupe is the life's work...

281
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,960
of my parents and grandparents.

282
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:24,319
The troupe isn't a burden to me.

283
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:25,890
It's my strong support.

284
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:27,480
One million yuan?

285
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:34,079
Where can I get that much money?

286
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,079
It's raining so heavily.

287
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,279
Is she still here?

288
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:10,599
Let's make a deal.

289
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,358
If you can complete the mission,

290
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:14,359
I'll pay you handsomely.

291
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:15,919
In 15 days,

292
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,410
attend a banquet with Mr. Ye,
the CEO of Anning Culture,

293
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:20,359
as his girlfriend.

294
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:40,170
Nuan Nuan.

295
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,920
What are you doing out here alone?

296
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:44,650
Hold this.

297
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:50,170
Are you cold?

298
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,639
Nuan Nuan,

299
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,759
are you stupid?

300
00:21:57,599 --> 00:21:58,599
What?

301
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,079
Why did you lie to me?

302
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,798
Why are you going out...

303
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:05,799
with Jiang Ling Er from Aurora?

304
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,919
Why are you going out...

305
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,920
with Jiang Ling Er from Aurora?

306
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,839
I'm asking you why, Jiang Fang!

307
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,559
It's for our sake!

308
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:23,400
That Linjiang flat?

309
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:26,199
We had been saving up for so long.

310
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,400
I couldn't save up enough.

311
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,920
And now?

312
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:31,400
I can easily buy an apartment.

313
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,720
Nuan Nuan, I'm not breaking up with you.

314
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,640
If you hadn't come across us that day,

315
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,400
you wouldn't have had to know anything.

316
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,480
You could have been a happy woman.

317
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,960
Nuan Nuan, I love you.

318
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:44,079
Can't you feel it?

319
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:48,319
You love me?

320
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:53,279
How dare you say you love me?

321
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,358
If you love me, would you
use another woman's money...

322
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:57,400
to support me?

323
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,240
Say whatever you want.

324
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:01,960
I've got everything I want now.

325
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:03,559
But what about you?

326
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:05,680
All you do is play extras.

327
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:06,879
You can't bear to spend money...

328
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,920
on food or clothing.

329
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:09,798
Your family's lousy theater...

330
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:11,039
is a bottomless pit.

331
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:12,319
Your brother...

332
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,400
is a good-for-nothing!

333
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,519
Every time he calls you, he only cries to you.

334
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:17,759
I'm the only one in this world...

335
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:19,879
who is truly good to you.

336
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,000
Do you understand?

337
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:25,079
The two of us are working hard together.

338
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,680
There's a future.

339
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,920
Why don't you believe me?

340
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,720
A future?

341
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,200
How many years are we going to work hard for?

342
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:35,319
How many years are we going to be young?

343
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,279
We came to this unfamiliar city.

344
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:39,880
It's okay.

345
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:41,799
We'll have to rely on me to succeed.

346
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:45,119
So...

347
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,720
I hope...

348
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,839
you can be more understanding of me.

349
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:51,359
Give me some more time.

350
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:04,359
I love you.

351
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,000
It's Ling Er.

352
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:28,559
Well...

353
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,240
She...

354
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:39,079
I have to take it.

355
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,400
Hi, Ling Er.

356
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,798
Jiang Fang, where is your car?

357
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:49,960
Why aren't you here to pick me up?

358
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:52,679
I'll be right back.

359
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,758
Wait for me for a second.

360
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:54,759
I'll be right there.

361
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:56,079
Bye.

362
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,519
Nuan Nuan, take this card.

363
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,240
Take the umbrella too. Go home first.

364
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:06,359
I'll come back for you when I'm done.

365
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,519
What are you doing?

366
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,279
Listen to me, all right?

367
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:11,279
Go.

368
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:15,680
You'll be in trouble if you don't go now.

369
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:16,400
What am I thinking?

370
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,000
It's none of my business.

371
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,279
Mom.

372
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:21,079
"Mom"?

373
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,000
Don't worry.

374
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,240
I'll take good care of Xiao Kai.
