1
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:54,200
(How could you let Wen Xiao Nuan and Han Hui meet?)

2
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:00,439
Ms. Cheng, since you brought it up,

3
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,480
I need to vent to you.

4
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,158
Because of Xiao Nuan,

5
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,039
Mr. Ye is too strict with the management department.

6
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,679
He nags us every day and keeps an eye on us...

7
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,199
in case Xiao Nuan gets bullied and suffers.

8
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,000
The room can't be too hot or too cold.

9
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:18,840
We have to pick the best co-stars to work with.

10
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,680
You know, we're only employees.

11
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:22,919
At this rate,

12
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,479
even ten Zhou Xiao Jing won't be able to handle him.

13
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:25,810
Ms. Cheng.

14
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:28,759
You have to say something on behalf of the management department.

15
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,840
All right, I got it.

16
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,960
It's the hardest on you.

17
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,090
I know.

18
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,560
Ms. Han.

19
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:44,439
Why did you want to see me today?

20
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:47,800
Ms. Wen.

21
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:51,479
Ms. Zhou.

22
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,239
I have something...

23
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,560
to discuss with Ms. Cheng in private.

24
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,039
Please excuse us for a moment.

25
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:00,759
- Okay. - Ms. Han, you might have forgotten.

26
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,520
I was the one who managed you back then.

27
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:06,400
I know your matters like the back of my hand.

28
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,599
I don't think I need to leave.

29
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:12,759
I'll get going then.

30
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,439
Wait.

31
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:16,960
You're the daughter-in-law of the Ye family.

32
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,560
Why do you need to leave?

33
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,360
Sit down.

34
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,439
Sit.

35
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,639
Ms. Cheng.

36
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:37,840
I'm the only person Fei Mo has ever loved.

37
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:43,759
My goodness.

38
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,520
So Han Hui and Ye Fei Mo...

39
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:48,400
Wen Xiao Nuan, why are you upset?

40
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:51,439
Remember. Don't get too immersed in your role.

41
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,039
Ye Fei Mo is nothing but your employer.

42
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:57,439
(How could you let Wen Xiao Nuan and Han Hui meet?)

43
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,159
How's the situation?

44
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:12,719
I know Fei Mo's temper best.

45
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:15,879
When he found out it was you who saved his life,

46
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:17,360
he insisted on being with you...

47
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,079
to repay your kindness.

48
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,359
But how could the Fei Mo back then...

49
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,050
understand what love is?

50
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:26,199
He's different now.

51
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,639
Fei Mo is all grown up.

52
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,758
He knows what he wants...

53
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:33,319
and what kind of person he wants to love.

54
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:35,240
Look at Nuan Nuan.

55
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:36,959
She just made her debut,

56
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,920
and Fei Mo has been protecting her all this time.

57
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:41,519
So...

58
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:43,560
I want to make one thing clear.

59
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:46,958
I don't want any nonsense gossip...

60
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:49,360
to affect Nuan Nuan, my son,

61
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,759
and Anning Culture.

62
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,240
Ms. Han, for old times' sake,

63
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:56,759
I hope you know when to stop.

64
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,680
Don't embarrass everyone.

65
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,170
I must be out of my mind.

66
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,518
How could we talk about your past relationship...

67
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:11,050
with Fei Mo in front of Nuan Nuan?

68
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,759
It's too disrespectful to Nuan Nuan.

69
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:16,360
Sorry, Nuan Nuan.

70
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,878
Okay, let's drop that.

71
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:22,879
Let's talk about what you truly came here for.

72
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:26,680
If you had known about Fei Mo's background back then,

73
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:28,839
you would have brought this up way earlier.

74
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,240
It'd be too long...

75
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,959
to wait until today.

76
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:33,758
Ms. Cheng, I've never taken advantage of you.

77
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,759
Of course.

78
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,360
Ms. Han, back then,

79
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,759
even without Mr. Ye,

80
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:40,480
you'd still be successful.

81
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,040
But now,

82
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,838
Anning Culture is finally...

83
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:46,040
in your good graces.

84
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,600
Naturally, you won't belittle Mr. Ye's resources.

85
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,319
Ms. Cheng, don't worry.

86
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,360
Ms. Han will get to the point soon.

87
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,519
Ms. Cheng.

88
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,480
I know you're prejudiced against me.

89
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,199
But this is business.

90
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,839
I hope...

91
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,439
you have the future of Anning Culture in mind.

92
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,560
To be blunt,

93
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:18,160
with my current status in the local film industry...

94
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:19,839
and box office appeal,

95
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,680
if I join "Blue Galaxy",

96
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:23,800
I'll be of great help to it.

97
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:26,638
Be it for Anning Culture...

98
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,519
or "Blue Galaxy",

99
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:31,560
I'm the best candidate for the female lead.

100
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,120
Speaking of which,

101
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,600
when was the last time I cared about our company's business?

102
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,519
Who's the director of this movie?

103
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,680
Ms. Cheng.

104
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,360
The director of this movie is Li Can.

105
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,600
But you know Li Can's temper.

106
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,720
He's used to doing the casting himself.

107
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:48,519
He never listens...

108
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,959
to anyone's opinion.

109
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,040
How could it be him?

110
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:54,680
He's notorious for being a pain in the butt.

111
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:58,040
He won't even give in for a so-called boss like me.

112
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,120
This is not going to be easy.

113
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,759
These two are too good.

114
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:05,000
Even I can tell they're passing the buck.

115
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,319
Han Hui is smart. How could she fall for it?

116
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,720
What's wrong, Nuan Nuan?

117
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,079
Do you have something to say?

118
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,879
Why are you always choking today?

119
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:19,958
The coffee has milk in it.

120
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:21,279
I'm not used to it either.

121
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,680
It's still too bitter.

122
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,600
Fei Mo likes bitter coffee the most.

123
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:30,800
Really?

124
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:34,720
Maybe Mr. Ye has been influenced by me.

125
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,199
When I'm with him,

126
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:39,959
we both like having mocha.

127
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:41,959
Is that so, Nuan Nuan?

128
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,759
Fei Mo changed for you.

129
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,958
Really? When did he change?

130
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:48,240
Ms. Cheng, you're not aware.

131
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:51,039
Lately, Mr. Ye has started to smile more.

132
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,079
Really?

133
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:53,680
That's great.

134
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,639
Nuan Nuan, you're amazing.

135
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:57,519
Thank you, Ms. Cheng.

136
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:00,519
Ms. Cheng, I'm a bit hungry.

137
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:01,879
May I have something to eat?

138
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Of course.

139
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,360
Of course you can eat.

140
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,879
Waiter, serve the food.

141
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,720
We can't let Nuan Nuan starve.

142
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:13,639
(How's the situation?)

143
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:21,000
(Big Princess)

144
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:27,079
Hello.

145
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,800
The subscriber you have dialed is unavailable.

146
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:36,879
Ms. Cheng.

147
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,720
About what I just mentioned,

148
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,559
I hope you'll think about it.

149
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,960
Ms. Han, aren't we done with our business?

150
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,759
Can you let me have a meal with my daughter-in-law in peace?

151
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:01,639
Enjoy.

152
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,279
Ms. Cheng.

153
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,519
Do you think Han Hui would believe us?

154
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,840
Why should I care?

155
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,039
I'm full.

156
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:30,519
You're full?

157
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:32,279
Won't you have some more?

158
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:33,799
No, it's okay.

159
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,840
Okay then. You can go ahead.

160
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,278
I need to talk to Xiao Jing.

161
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,279
Okay.

162
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:43,399
Wait for me in the parking lot.

163
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,210
Okay.

164
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:46,519
Thank you for the meal, Ms. Cheng.

165
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:47,879
Xiao Jing, I'll get going first.

166
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,519
Ms. Han.

167
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:10,679
You're still here.

168
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:18,799
Ms. Wen.

169
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,720
I underestimated you.

170
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:23,240
I didn't expect you to fit in with the Ye family so quickly.

171
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,759
Don't think you can fool me with just a couple of acts.

172
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:29,519
Fei Mo won't like you.

173
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,450
The title of daughter-in-law...

174
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,210
is just Cheng An Ya's wishful thinking.

175
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,450
Don't you get carried away.

176
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,759
Ms. Han.

177
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:43,720
I'm not getting carried away.

178
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,879
But you,

179
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,480
what are you so nervous about?

180
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:48,919
I...

181
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,330
Let me remind you.

182
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,799
You're an international star.

183
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,600
Arguing with a rookie like me...

184
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:55,799
is beneath you.

185
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,240
I see.

186
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,080
So this is what's going on.

187
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,639
Ms. Wen.

188
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,600
You're really something.

189
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,600
In front of Cheng An Ya and Zhou Xiao Jing,

190
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:15,879
you pretend to be all innocent.

191
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:17,679
It turns out...

192
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,159
you're not as innocent and kind as you look.

193
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,240
You're smart...

194
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:25,279
for knowing how to get on their good side.

195
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:28,000
You want fame...

196
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,759
yet you suck up to them.

197
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,039
Ms. Han.

198
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:36,600
Actually, there was a time...

199
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,240
when I thought of you as my goal.

200
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,758
If I could be one-tenth of what you are,

201
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:42,960
I'd be satisfied.

202
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,799
But I realized today...

203
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,360
that making you my goal...

204
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:49,679
was truly a shallow choice.

205
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,559
- You... - Don't get mad.

206
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,240
I'm only telling the truth.

207
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:56,799
Whether I suck up to Ms. Cheng or not,

208
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,440
that's my business.

209
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,679
There are so many people who want to please her.

210
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:02,440
If I can truly make her happy,

211
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:04,159
that's my ability.

212
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,600
Unlike some people.

213
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,399
She tries to please them,

214
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:09,919
but they don't accept it.

215
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,120
Wen Xiao Nuan.

216
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,039
You'll pay for what you said today.

217
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:25,679
Thank you for your kind advice.

218
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,799
Fei Mo.

219
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:45,240
You've got a good eye.

220
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,480
I like Wen Xiao Nuan.

221
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:50,279
She's soft yet strong.

222
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:52,279
She's resilient and has a bright future.

223
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,120
I can give her full marks right now.

224
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,240
Listen.

225
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,279
I've accepted Wen Xiao Nuan as my daughter-in-law.

226
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:03,919
If you dare to play games with me,

227
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:06,679
I won't go easy on you.

228
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,759
I'll teach you a lesson.

229
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,679
- Go. - Okay.

230
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,120
Get in.

231
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,759
Bye.

232
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,320
Why were you there?

233
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,519
Why can't I be there?

234
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,960
Yes.

235
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:18,200
Everything you do is a matter of course.

236
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,639
I heard you had dinner with my mom...

237
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:25,639
and Han Hui today.

238
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,440
You were in a relationship with Han Hui before?

239
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:38,919
Actually, we...

240
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:42,080
Why didn't you tell me this gossip?

241
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,720
I really thought you were a monk.

242
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,279
Your mom... No.

243
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,679
It was the first time I've seen Ms. Cheng...

244
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:55,279
so domineering.

245
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,960
Xiao Jing too.

246
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:59,000
She was so calm at passing the knife around.

247
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,600
They were so in sync.

248
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:03,159
What about you?

249
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,159
Were you just listening like a fool?

250
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,519
No.

251
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,799
Xiao Jing's instruction for me today...

252
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,440
was to just sit there quietly.

253
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:14,399
A supporting actor who steals the scene is not a good actor.

254
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,080
Is this what you've learned after the meal?

255
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,440
Of course not.

256
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,679
I really get it this time.

257
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,399
The female lead role in "Blue Galaxy"...

258
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:29,119
is a very rare opportunity.

259
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,519
I'll make the most of it.

260
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,240
I'll give Anning Culture a satisfactory answer.

261
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:35,399
I won't let Ms. Cheng down.

262
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,279
Only Ms. Cheng?

263
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:42,720
And Xiao Jing and Director Li.

264
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,360
And you.

265
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:49,080
Don't be petty.

266
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:11,720
Ms. Han.

267
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,120
Well?

268
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,159
How did it go with Cheng An Ya?

269
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,320
Your ex-girlfriend is quite something.

270
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:19,720
Cheng An Ya...

271
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,840
already sees her as her future daughter-in-law.

272
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,440
Ms. Han.

273
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,240
Has Ye Fei Mo's heart...

274
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,600
ever truly belonged to you?

275
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:34,840
What do you mean?

276
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,200
I think maybe we're going in the wrong direction.

277
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:41,600
You should learn from Wen Xiao Nuan.

278
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:44,399
As long as you can get into Ye Fei Mo's house,

279
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,960
I can block Wen Xiao Nuan's path forward...

280
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,039
and cut off Ye Fei Mo's escape route.

281
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:01,480
(One hour later)

282
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,960
Excuse me.

283
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:10,318
Alcohol, please. The strongest one.

284
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,359
Okay.

285
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,960
Mr. Ye, thank you for sending me home.

286
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,240
Nuan Nuan, were you training again?

287
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,480
You're home so late.

288
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,000
Jia Yi, let me tell you.

289
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:35,359
What happened today was amazing.

290
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,890
What happened?

291
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:38,279
Look how excited you are.

292
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,960
Hello, I'm calling from Junxin Bar.

293
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:45,759
Ms. Han Hui is drunk here.

294
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:47,650
What does that have to do with me?

295
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,119
Ms. Han has been recognized by the customers at the bar.

296
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:52,279
It's easy for a top star like her to cause a commotion.

297
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,079
Can you come and pick her up?

298
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:55,920
You should call her manager.

299
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:57,410
Don't call me again.

300
00:17:57,519 --> 00:17:58,559
Wait.

301
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:59,839
Her manager said she's out of town.

302
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:01,200
Ms. Han is drunk.

303
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:02,599
She's been crying for Fei Mo.

304
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,480
I saw that she talked to you on the phone just now.

305
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:05,839
I had no choice but to bother you.

306
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:07,319
Fine.

307
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,758
More alcohol.

308
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:32,960
Miss, you're drunk. You should stop drinking.

309
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:34,650
I'm not drunk.

310
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:35,799
Fill it up.

311
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:45,240
Fei Mo.

312
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:47,890
You're here.

313
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,170
You're finally here.

314
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,599
You're here for me.

315
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,279
Look, everything is still the same.

316
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:55,200
Except for that annoying waiter,

317
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:56,440
nothing has changed here.

318
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,119
Have you changed?

319
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:00,650
You shouldn't be here.

320
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,759
I'll send you back. Come on.

321
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:04,799
I'm not drunk.

322
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:06,119
I'm not drunk.

323
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,410
Who says I'm drunk?

324
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:11,039
Be careful.

325
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:16,680
Do you know?

326
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,039
I've always loved you.

327
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,519
What about you?

328
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,599
What are you doing?

329
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,839
Let's go back. Be careful.

330
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:51,599
Careful.

331
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,519
Stand still.

332
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:02,799
Come on.

333
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:07,759
Fei Mo.

334
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:12,170
Fei Mo.

335
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,279
I dreamt of you again.

336
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:19,960
Tell me.

337
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,960
What happened back then between Ye Fei Mo and Han Hui?

338
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:26,720
It's a sad story.

339
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,720
Back then,

340
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:30,920
when Han Hui and Ye Fei Mo first met,

341
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,799
Han Hui was just an unknown actress.

342
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:36,119
But she wasn't satisfied with her then status.

343
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,279
She worked hard to climb up the ladder.

344
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:39,839
She wanted to reach the top.

345
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:41,410
Thank you, everyone.

346
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:42,759
Thank you.

347
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:44,519
But Ye Fei Mo...

348
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:46,319
never revealed his background.

349
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:48,559
So Han Hui thought Ye Fei Mo...

350
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,519
was just a poor kid who hadn't graduated yet.

351
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:55,170
But Cheng An Ya kept an eye on Han Hui.

352
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,920
So she arranged an American director for Han Hui...

353
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,480
to invite her to the US to develop her career.

354
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:03,440
Actually, at that time,

355
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:05,598
Ye Fei Mo was already preparing...

356
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:07,319
to reveal his identity to Han Hui.

357
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,410
And through Zhou Xiao Jing,

358
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:10,889
he arranged for her...

359
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:12,440
to be the female lead in an S-class project.

360
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:14,319
That's "Blue Galaxy".

361
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:16,650
Unfortunately,

362
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,889
it's obvious that the olive branch Cheng An Ya offered...

363
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:21,000
was more tempting.

364
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:23,720
In the end, Han Hui chose to go to Hollywood.

365
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:28,759
Was Cheng An Ya testing Han Hui?

366
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:32,410
No one knows what Cheng An Ya thinks.

367
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:36,519
At most, she just kicked out a daughter-in-law she didn't like.

368
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:41,319
Say, Fei Mo.

369
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,319
Why doesn't Ms. Cheng like me?

370
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,650
She doesn't want me to be with you.

371
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,519
But she doesn't want you to hate her either.

372
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:57,519
So she tricked me into going to the US.

373
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,559
When I was in the US and found out that it was all a lie,

374
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:07,559
I was so devastated.

375
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,599
Let me get you some water.

376
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,480
Han Hui must have regretted it.

377
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,519
There was no turning back for her then.

378
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:23,000
She had no choice but to hang on.

379
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,599
But it's true that she was talented.

380
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,799
That's how she got to where she is today.

381
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,640
But Ye Fei Mo became her only regret in life.

382
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,880
Fei Mo.

383
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:48,039
I didn't have a choice back then.

384
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,000
We were together for so long.

385
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,920
But...

386
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,039
you kept it from me.

387
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:02,839
I didn't even know your true identity.

388
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,400
Suddenly, such a good opportunity was thrown at me.

389
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,200
Say.

390
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:14,960
If you were me,

391
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:17,400
what would you choose?

392
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,680
Get some rest.

393
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,680
Fei Mo.

394
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,279
Fei Mo.

395
00:23:58,119 --> 00:23:59,160
Fei Mo.

396
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:18,319
We're just going to film a movie.

397
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,759
We'll be back soon.

398
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:22,640
Must you go?

399
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,480
You know me.

400
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:30,839
Ever since I joined this industry,

401
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:33,079
I've been through so much.

402
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:35,079
I've suffered so much...

403
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,319
just to wait for this opportunity.

404
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,039
So I won't give it up.

405
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,039
Please stay.

406
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,680
We can work hard together.

407
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:48,440
I'll help you get everything you ever wanted.

408
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,319
Don't be like this.

409
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:54,799
Let's be realistic.

410
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,279
Have you ever thought about this?

411
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:03,640
If you go to the US,

412
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,000
our relationship might be over.

413
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,039
(Fei Mo)

414
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:45,359
