00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,760
(Episode 29)

2
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:52,719
Hello.

3
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,040
Stay home today. Don't go anywhere.

4
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,759
Why?

5
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,200
I have training today.

6
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,319
Hello?

7
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,239
(Wen Xiao Nuan came in between Fei Mo and Han Hui's relationship)

8
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,918
(Anning's rookie actress, Wen Xiao Nuan...)

9
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:14,119
(came in between Ye Fei Mo and Han Hui's relationship...)

10
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,810
(in order to gain fame)

11
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:21,759
Xiao Nuan, stay home today.

12
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,530
Don't come to the office, okay?

13
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:25,370
There are reporters downstairs.

14
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:26,840
My goodness.

15
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,840
Tell me if you need anything.

16
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,599
I'll bring it to you, okay?

17
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:32,479
My goodness.

18
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,280
Wen Xiao Nuan came in between...

19
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:40,719
Han Hui and Ye Fei Mo's relationship.

20
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:43,280
No wonder she's an S-class artist after signing with Anning.

21
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,879
So that's the connection.

22
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:46,679
I feel sorry for Han Hui.

23
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,559
Anyway, I won't watch "Blue Galaxy".

24
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,560
- Me too. - I won't watch it either.

25
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,759
(Wen Xiao Nuan came in between Fei Mo and Han Hui's relationship)

26
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:56,560
I can't let Ye Fei Mo face the pressure alone.

27
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,000
I have to go to him.

28
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,239
Mr. Ye, rumors about you and Wen Xiao Nuan...

29
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,080
are all over the Internet.

30
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:19,360
The news revealed a lot of details.

31
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,240
This is no ordinary exposé.

32
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,399
I suggest we do crisis PR immediately.

33
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,120
We can't let this drag on.

34
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,800
Wen Xiao Nuan's career is on the rise.

35
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,159
I never agreed to her being in a high-profile relationship.

36
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,879
Sorry, Mr. Ye.

37
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,519
I'm just worried...

38
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,120
that if we don't handle this well,

39
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:42,719
Wen Xiao Nuan's future could be ruined.

40
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,919
Wen Xiao Nuan is here!

41
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,679
Wen Xiao Nuan.

42
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,639
Did you get in between Mr. Ye and Han Hui's relationship?

43
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,080
Thank you, sir.

44
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,800
Nuan Nuan.

45
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,319
Sir, please wait a moment.

46
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,159
Excuse me.

47
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,479
Nuan Nuan!

48
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,840
Move! Nuan Nuan!

49
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,279
Come with me. This way.

50
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,680
Sir, let's go.

51
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,800
I know how serious this is.

52
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:29,959
When the PR department conducts crisis PR,

53
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:32,639
the Promotion and Publicity departments will fully cooperate.

54
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,170
Also, find the source of the news...

55
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,730
through our company's media channels...

56
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,519
and get to the bottom of this.

57
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,759
Okay, I'll get right on it.

58
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:49,959
It's all my fault.

59
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:52,050
I couldn't protect her.

60
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,170
Nuan Nuan.

61
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:06,879
Jia Yi.

62
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,680
Thank goodness you were there.

63
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,279
I don't know what would've happened otherwise.

64
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,609
Get some rest.

65
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:13,759
Don't think too much.

66
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:18,519
The public opinion is really scary.

67
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:20,759
They can turn what's right into what's wrong.

68
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,279
I had promised Ye Fei Mo that I wouldn't be afraid anymore.

69
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,160
But I still chickened out.

70
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:31,160
I'm such a coward.

71
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:36,160
Actually, we're the same.

72
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,800
We're both cowards.

73
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,920
Who released this news?

74
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:45,079
Could it be Anning's publicity stunt?

75
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,680
It can't be.

76
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:49,800
Fei Mo would never use his personal relationship for publicity.

77
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:53,920
Could it be a one-sided publicity stunt by Wen Xiao Nuan?

78
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,560
Wen Xiao Nuan is a rookie.

79
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,479
Even if she wanted to create publicity,

80
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,199
she wouldn't expose herself as the other woman.

81
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,399
She'd be ruining her own career.

82
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,599
Could it be that Aurora Film's Jiang Fang...

83
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,040
is trying to get back at Mr. Ye?

84
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:13,120
Jiang Fang still has feelings for Wen Xiao Nuan.

85
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:15,559
Even if he wants revenge on Fei Mo,

86
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,120
he wouldn't hurt Wen Xiao Nuan.

87
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,199
No matter who it was,

88
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,000
the current public opinion online is very favorable to us.

89
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,639
I'm an international star.

90
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,160
But a rookie interfered with my relationship.

91
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,479
I'm being misunderstood by Fei Mo...

92
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,838
and pitied as the abandoned wife of a rich family.

93
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:36,279
You think it's very good?

94
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:51,000
Are you still worried about Wen Xiao Nuan?

95
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,639
If we can't solve this crisis,

96
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,879
Wen Xiao Nuan's future will be ruined.

97
00:06:58,879 --> 00:06:59,879
What's done is done.

98
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,079
Why don't you just announce their relationship?

99
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,519
Public opinion...

100
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,318
will disappear in a few days.

101
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:07,879
No. It's too risky to announce it now.

102
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:10,199
I can't let Xiao Nuan follow in the footsteps of Han Hui.

103
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,438
I've already failed with Han Hui once.

104
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:14,079
I can't fail again.

105
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,199
Why do you always let other people's lives tie you down?

106
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,120
You may look tough on the outside,

107
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,759
but you're actually more timid than anyone else.

108
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Han Hui and Wen Xiao Nuan are braver than you.

109
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:37,039
For love, Han Hui can leave Hollywood behind...

110
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,759
and come back to China.

111
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,560
Wen Xiao Nuan started as an ordinary extra.

112
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,160
She endured the pressure to come this far.

113
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,000
But you only live in your own world.

114
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,639
You don't dare to step out of your own confinement.

115
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,759
I've liked you since I entered school ten years ago.

116
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:04,759
For the past ten years,

117
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,800
you've always thought that I'm immature.

118
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,720
You just won't give me an answer.

119
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:00,960
Step out of your confinement bravely.

120
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,039
You'll realize that the outside world is really sweet.

121
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:11,559
Childish.

122
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,600
Since the first time I confessed to you,

123
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:23,158
in 12 hours, 12 minutes, and 8 seconds,

124
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,210
it'll be exactly ten years.

125
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:27,240
The ten-year promise is coming up.

126
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,720
You promised to give me an answer.

127
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:35,090
This time,

128
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:38,210
it's your turn to come to me.

129
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:36,090
Come in.

130
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,679
What's the matter?

131
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:55,919
I'm sorry.

132
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,639
I couldn't protect you.

133
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,039
I was a little scared.

134
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,079
Didn't you tell me before...

135
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,440
that you're not afraid of anything?

136
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:11,440
What's wrong? You're scared now?

137
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,759
But I'm not afraid anymore with you here.

138
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,399
Why did you want to make our relationship public before?

139
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,120
It's simple.

140
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:25,360
Because we're truly together.

141
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:27,759
There's no need to hide it from the public.

142
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:32,399
Let's make it public then.

143
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:33,679
No.

144
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,679
I don't want to announce it anymore.

145
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:37,959
Because...

146
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,840
I have a soft spot now.

147
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,600
I don't want her to get hurt.

148
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:49,440
But your soft spot...

149
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,000
is about to become stronger.

150
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,600
Let's announce it.

151
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:07,159
Are you ready?

152
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:13,000
He's coming out. Hurry.

153
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:16,240
- Mr. Ye. - Mr. Ye.

154
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,440
Please explain.

155
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,398
Mr. Ye, what's your relationship with Wen Xiao Nuan?

156
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:20,719
Please let us know.

157
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,439
Mr. Ye.

158
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,638
Mr. Ye.

159
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:25,319
- Please say something. - Mr. Ye.

160
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,199
Wen Xiao Nuan came between you and Han Hui.

161
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,559
Is that true?

162
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:30,798
Ms. Wen, you're an S-class artist as soon as you signed with Anning.

163
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:32,240
Is it because of the relationship between you and Mr. Ye?

164
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,999
Mr. Ye, why did you choose Wen Xiao Nuan,
and not Han Hui?

165
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,279
Is there a reason behind this?

166
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,240
Yes.

167
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,639
Ye Fei Mo and I are in a relationship.

168
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,240
But I didn't meddle in anyone's relationship.

169
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,360
I told the media before.

170
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:51,960
I'll announce it when I'm in a relationship.

171
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,440
I'm officially announcing...

172
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,159
that Wen Xiao Nuan is my girlfriend.

173
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:58,959
Mr. Ye, did Wen Xiao Nuan...

174
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,799
get in the way of your relationship with Han Hui?

175
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:03,039
She's not a meddler.

176
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:05,919
She's the one I love.

177
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:11,759
I hope everyone will support my movie.

178
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,039
Thank you for supporting me and Fei Mo.

179
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,158
Mr. Ye, how long have you been together?

180
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,440
- Mr. Ye. - Mr. Ye.

181
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,440
Mr. Ye.

182
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:24,679
Mr. Ye.

183
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,440
- Hello, Mr. Ye. - Hello, Mr. Ye.

184
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:29,399
How did I do just now?

185
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:31,240
You were great.

186
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:33,039
How nice.

187
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,360
I heard Wen Xiao Nuan came in between Mr. Ye and Han Hui.

188
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,480
Is that true?

189
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,200
Don't talk nonsense.

190
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:41,080
If Wen Xiao Nuan was the other woman,

191
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,199
would Mr. Ye announce their relationship?

192
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,319
Ridiculous. It's Mr. Ye's relationship.

193
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,759
What does it have to do with you?

194
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,639
Public figures have the right to pursue happiness too.

195
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,720
Compared to the negative media coverage,

196
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,839
not being able to be with the one you love...

197
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,120
is the most painful.

198
00:13:57,559 --> 00:13:59,440
Han Hui and Wen Xiao Nuan are braver than you.

199
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:02,720
But you only live in your own world.

200
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,399
You don't dare to step out of your own confinement.

201
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:07,799
Since the first time I confessed to you,

202
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,758
in 12 hours, 12 minutes, and 8 seconds,

203
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:12,759
it'll be exactly ten years.

204
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:26,000
(Timer)

205
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:44,399
(August 17, Saturday)

206
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:53,320
(Timer)

207
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,600
Director.

208
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,240
Is this scene okay?

209
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:23,558
Yes. Take a break.

210
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:25,080
- Thank you, Director.
- Thank you, Director.

211
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,679
Right on time.

212
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,919
No. You're late.

213
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,720
We were in Bangkok when you confessed to me.

214
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:20,000
Technically, I'm an hour early.

215
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,159
Will you finish this cotton candy with me?

216
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,758
Miss, I'm sorry. I got it wrong.

217
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:16,078
It's okay, Mrs. Ye.

218
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,410
You did very well.

219
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:20,919
Miss.

220
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,920
Why are you playing along with them?

221
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,480
I'll get going then.

222
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,239
Why is your face so red?

223
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,240
Do you have a fever?

224
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,680
I don't have a fever.

225
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,078
They are so sweet.

226
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:49,999
Fei Mo, can you tell everyone...

227
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,480
not to call me Mrs. Ye?

228
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:52,960
Just call me Wen Xiao Nuan.

229
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:56,598
Maggie.

230
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:58,319
- Yes, Mr. Ye. - Notify the whole company...

231
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:00,719
not to call Wen Xiao Nuan Mrs. Ye from now on.

232
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,410
- Yes. - No, there's no need.

233
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,960
Maggie, cancel the notice.

234
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:08,359
Yes.

235
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:11,039
No, I mean...

236
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:16,479
It's fine. I'll go back to my training.

237
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,559
Wait.

238
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:19,359
Come here.

239
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:21,079
Your shoelace is untied.

240
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:31,719
I didn't know Mr. Ye was so warm.

241
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,319
He knows to tie his girlfriend's shoelace.

242
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,440
Mr. Ye is cold because you're not someone he wants to be warm to.

243
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,598
We badmouthed Mr. Ye so much...

244
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:40,279
in front of Wen Xiao Nuan before.

245
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:43,279
She won't tell Mr. Ye on us, will she?

246
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,558
- No. - I don't think so.

247
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:45,799
Wen Xiao Nuan isn't that nosy.

248
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Get up.

249
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:58,519
My goodness. Look at that.

250
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,039
Mr. Ye is smiling.

251
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,960
Let's go.

252
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:08,559
Your relationship with Wen Xiao Nuan has been exposed.

253
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,039
Will it affect our box office sales?

254
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,480
Yes.

255
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,039
It has a very positive effect.

256
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,680
This relationship...

257
00:19:16,681 --> 00:19:19,410
will continue to increase our box office sales.

258
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:20,680
Let it sit for a while.

259
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,919
I think in about three days.

260
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,518
In three days, the Promotion Department...

261
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:28,519
Mr. Gu, this is the latest online data.

262
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,680
"Blue Galaxy" has bounced back strongly.

263
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,720
It's continuing to rise.

264
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,798
Today's single-day box office sales...

265
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:35,650
are already five times its official peak.

266
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,078
The total box office sales...

267
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:38,410
might be the highest in this genre.

268
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,519
Okay. Good.

269
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,359
We'll continue with the promotional plan.

270
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,480
Let's keep going.

271
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,078
When this is over,

272
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:47,558
I'll pay...

273
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:49,518
to send everyone on a team-building trip abroad.

274
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:51,890
- Okay? - Yes!

275
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,759
(Box office sales of "Blue Galaxy" continue to rise)

276
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,960
Ms. Jiang.

277
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:09,889
Why did the box office sales go up instead of down?

278
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,239
What are you doing?

279
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,599
Things were going according to our plan.

280
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,518
But who knew that Ye Fei Mo and Wen Xiao Nuan...

281
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:16,960
would suddenly announce their relationship?

282
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:19,480
Wen Xiao Nuan's sincerity has won the hearts of the netizens.

283
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:20,890
You're useless.

284
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:23,410
(Xiao Tian)

285
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,410
- Ms. Jiang. - What is Jiang Fang doing now?

286
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:31,559
Mr. Jiang is having a meeting with the executives...

287
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:34,000
to discuss the next step of promoting "Blue Galaxy".

288
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:35,170
What?

289
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:41,038
"Blue Galaxy" is doing well now. It's a good opportunity.

290
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,240
Aurora Film can do post-publicity work...

291
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:45,650
to raise awareness.

292
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:49,599
I completely agree with Mr. Jiang.

293
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,359
I'll supervise the Theater department.

294
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:53,759
Okay.

295
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,039
Does anyone have anything to add?

296
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:02,000
Jiang Fang, I have something to say.

297
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:04,649
Ling Er, I'm in a meeting.
Wait for me in the office, okay?

298
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:05,920
I want to say it here.

299
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:11,000
Mr. Jiang, we'll get going then.

300
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:35,079
What's the matter?

301
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,599
Why are you so concerned about "Blue Galaxy"?

302
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:43,199
"Blue Galaxy" is a theatrical release of Aurora Film.

303
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,518
As the company executive,

304
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:46,650
what's wrong with being concerned about it?

305
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,170
I'm afraid you're concerned about the person in the movie.

306
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,960
Jiang Ling Er, what are you trying to say?

307
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,160
Don't take me for a fool.

308
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,000
Anyone can see it.

309
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:57,720
You care about "Blue Galaxy"...

310
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,440
because of Wen Xiao Nuan.

311
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,879
It was you who announced...

312
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,480
Wen Xiao Nuan and Ye Fei Mo's relationship, right?

313
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,759
Yes, it was me.

314
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,799
I want to ruin Wen Xiao Nuan's reputation.

315
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,599
I want you to give up on her.

316
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,199
You're being unreasonable.

317
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,559
I'm being unreasonable?

318
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:15,199
If you think Wen Xiao Nuan is good,

319
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,200
then go to her.

320
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:19,240
She's with Ye Fei Mo now.

321
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,960
I'm afraid she has long forgotten about you.

322
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:24,919
Jiang Ling Er, don't go too far!

323
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,160
Jiang Fang, how dare you yell at me?

324
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:29,559
I'm afraid you've forgotten.

325
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,319
Everything you have now was given to you by me.

326
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:34,078
I worked hard...

327
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:35,640
for everything I have now!

328
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,440
Worked hard?

329
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,160
Without me,

330
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:42,240
my brother wouldn't even glance at you...

331
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:44,000
or have given you your current position.

332
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:49,079
I'm afraid you've forgotten.

333
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,720
Back then, in order to woo me, the daughter of the Jiang family,

334
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:55,358
you tried so hard to flatter me.

335
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:56,359
They're fighting.

336
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:57,838
Be quiet.

337
00:22:57,839 --> 00:22:58,839
Let me tell you.

338
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,880
Listen.

339
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,720
Ms. Jiang is so mad.

340
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:04,959
Mr. Jiang must be having an affair.

341
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,960
No way.

342
00:23:05,961 --> 00:23:06,999
My goodness.

343
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,880
That's shocking.

344
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:14,319
Jiang Fang, you can't leave.

345
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,200
Jiang Fang.

346
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:18,838
If you dare to step out of this door today,

347
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:20,119
I'll ruin your reputation.

348
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:32,439
She's not a meddler.

349
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,479
(Wen Xiao Nuan and Ye Fei Mo announce relationship)

350
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,480
She's the one I love.

351
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,319
The situation has changed.

352
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:58,519
Many people were moved by Wen Xiao Nuan's honesty.

353
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,039
The box office sales of "Blue Galaxy" has bounced back.

354
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:04,240
Han Hui, what should we do?

355
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,599
Contact the screenwriter, Mr. Liu.

356
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,960
Ask him to come to the studio tonight.

357
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,680
Okay.

358
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,960
(Big Princess)

359
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:32,519
What is it, Mom?

360
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:36,319
Can't I call you if there's nothing?

361
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,839
You've forgotten about me now that you have a wife.

362
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,079
I saw the news.

363
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,919
Bring Nuan Nuan home for dinner tomorrow.

364
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,920
I want to see her.

365
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:46,960
It's not like you haven't seen her before.

366
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:49,440
She's the daughter-in-law of the Ye family now.

367
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,759
Of course I have to meet her formally.

368
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:53,079
It's etiquette.

369
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,640
I'll wait for you at home tomorrow.

370
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,960
Okay.

371
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:14,720
Two, three, four, five, six, seven.

372
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:16,319
Coming.

373
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,119
Why are you here?

374
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:25,200
My mom wants to see you tomorrow.

375
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:27,758
She said...

376
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:30,480
she wants you to meet her formally as her daughter-in-law.

377
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,798
Then should I bring a gift...

378
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:35,279
for the first official meeting?

379
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:37,278
Don't worry about the gift.

380
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,318
I'll ask Maggie to buy it...

381
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:39,319
and deliver it tomorrow morning.

382
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,440
No, I have to prepare it myself.

383
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,839
My mom loves perfume.

384
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,559
Why don't you give her a bottle of perfume?

385
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,679
Thank you for coming to the studio, Mr. Liu.

386
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,680
Don't mention it.

387
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,720
It's an honor to have dinner with you, Ms. Han.

388
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:04,559
I've always been a fan of you.

389
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,039
In all the characters I've created,

390
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,960
there are traces of you in them.

391
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:11,959
No wonder every time I read your work,

392
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,400
I can relate to them so deeply.

393
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,640
It's not just that the script is good.

394
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:17,960
I could also see myself in it.

395
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,999
The story you told me the last time we met,

396
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,039
I've turned it into a movie script.

397
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,880
It's called "Twin Flowers".

398
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:27,839
I'm sure you'll like it.

399
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,439
I'll read it carefully then.

400
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,440
Of course.

401
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:38,119
It's my honor. Cheers.

402
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,440
Okay.

403
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:52,480
(Ling Er)

404
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:56,799
Come in.

405
00:26:57,759 --> 00:26:58,759
Mr. Jiang.

406
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,118
This is the latest attendance rate and box office ratings...

407
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:04,759
of "Blue Galaxy" and "Magpie Bridge".

408
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:07,960
Currently, all major box office evaluators believe...

409
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,758
that the single-day ticket sales of our two films...

410
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:11,799
still have room for growth.

411
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,200
Not bad.

412
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:17,159
Both projects were secured by you.

413
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,518
Aurora Film's vice president position...

414
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:19,880
is yours for sure this time.

415
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,160
(Jiang Hao)

416
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,799
Mr. Jiang probably wants to praise you after seeing the reports.

417
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,359
You can go now.

418
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,160
Mr. Jiang.

419
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,400
Jiang Fang.

420
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:43,799
I just saw the company's report.

421
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,519
Your projects "Blue Galaxy" and "Magpie Bridge" did very well.

422
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,920
Congratulations.

423
00:27:48,921 --> 00:27:50,200
It's all thanks to you, Mr. Jiang.

424
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,079
It's all thanks to Ling Er's good taste.

425
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,079
She chose you to be the general manager.

426
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:55,599
That's why you're here today.

427
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,920
Yes, Mr. Jiang.

428
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,680
My little sister grew up under my care.

429
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:03,400
Although she's willful,

430
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:05,559
she's devoted to you.

431
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:07,680
She even reminded me yesterday...

432
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:09,680
that you're working hard for the company.

433
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:10,839
You're always working overtime.

434
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,880
She feels bad for you.

435
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,960
She asked me to promote you.

436
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:15,279
Everyone knows how capable you are.

437
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,239
Ling Er supports you a lot.

438
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,440
As a big brother, I feel sorry for my sister.

439
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:21,160
So I'll support you all the way.

440
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,720
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

441
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:47,319
Mr. Jiang, please call me back when you're available.

442
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,359
Hello.

443
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,680
Ms. Han.

444
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,599
I've got a weapon in my hand...

445
00:28:58,039 --> 00:29:00,960
that can separate Wen Xiao Nuan and Ye Fei Mo forever.
