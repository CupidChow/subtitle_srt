1
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,760
Is Mr. Ye...

2
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,280
going to announce his relationship with Han Hui?

3
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:45,158
Mr. Ye has never held a press conference...

4
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:46,239
because of personal matters.

5
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:48,239
Those who came are all entertainment reporters.

6
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,680
I'm sure it's not about work.

7
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,120
- Looks like there's a big scoop. - Yes.

8
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:53,560
Mr. Ye is here.

9
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:56,318
- Mr. Ye. - Mr. Ye.

10
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:58,039
Mr. Ye, are you in a relationship with Han Hui?

11
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,680
Mr. Ye, what's your relationship with Han Hui?

12
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,000
- Please tell us, Mr. Ye.
- This press conference...

13
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:04,079
is called on to clarify one thing.

14
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,840
So far,

15
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:08,759
all the rumors about my relationship...

16
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,199
are false.

17
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,840
So please stop spreading false rumors.

18
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,479
I'd also like the rumor-monger to stop.

19
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,599
Stop speculating.

20
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,560
Else,

21
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,370
Anning Culture...

22
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,560
will send a lawyer's letter.

23
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,319
If one day, I, Ye Fei Mo, am in a relationship,

24
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:32,090
I will announce it to everyone.

25
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,599
Thank you.

26
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,370
- Mr. Ye! - Wait, Mr. Ye!

27
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:40,719
Come and see.

28
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,439
Look, it's Han Hui.

29
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,159
- Come and see. - Will they fight?

30
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:47,479
Come and see. What do you think?

31
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:49,199
Mr. Ye has clarified.

32
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:51,759
What is going on?

33
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:53,800
What is happening?

34
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:56,000
It's your first time playing the female lead.

35
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,919
You must be excited.

36
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,879
Han Hui.

37
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,159
It's Mr. Ye.

38
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,280
So please stop spreading false rumors.

39
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,120
I'd also like the rumor-monger to stop.

40
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:15,560
Mr. Ye never cared about scandals before.

41
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:17,158
So many people have taken advantage of his fame,

42
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,800
but he never clarified anything.

43
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,039
What's going on?

44
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,800
Han Hui.

45
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,319
Calm down.

46
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,759
You're in public.

47
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:39,639
Give them two more racks later.

48
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,279
And reinforce the fence for safety.

49
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,280
- Okay. - Go.

50
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,840
Buddy.

51
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,239
I have a question.

52
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,479
- Who is Wen Xiao Nuan? - Wen Xiao Nuan?

53
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,280
Up there.

54
00:03:55,281 --> 00:03:56,439
She's Wen Xiao Nuan.

55
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,520
So this is my cousin-in-law.

56
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,240
Beautiful.

57
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:11,280
- Aren't you... - No, I'm not.

58
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,560
Xiao Nuan, I'll get you some water.

59
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,279
So please stop spreading false rumors.

60
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:26,680
If one day, I, Ye Fei Mo, am in a relationship,

61
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:28,680
I will announce it to everyone.

62
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,319
- Thank you. - Mr. Ye.

63
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:33,199
- Mr. Ye! - Wait, Mr. Ye!

64
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,800
What's up? I'm on set.

65
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,610
You're on set?

66
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:40,758
Don't speak without thinking.

67
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:41,799
Do you hear me?

68
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,680
You mean, I can't call her my cousin-in-law?

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Go home.

70
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,480
I'm filming with my cousin-in-law.

71
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:50,730
Her acting is good.

72
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:52,319
I'm looking forward to acting with her.

73
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,199
I'm warning you.

74
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:56,519
Don't cause trouble.

75
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,839
Okay.

76
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,439
Mr. Ye, it's time for the meeting.

77
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,879
I am alone and have no one to rely on.

78
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,800
I wonder what year it is.

79
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,000
When I...

80
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,680
When I look at the clouds, I don't see you.

81
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,120
Who can I tell my troubles to?

82
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:45,040
Who should I tell my troubles to?

83
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,360
Xiao Nuan.

84
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,719
I was just listening.

85
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,160
There's a line of yours that needs a little more meaning.

86
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,279
Why is she here?

87
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,639
This is it.

88
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,199
I wonder...

89
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,240
what year it is.

90
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,199
- Han Hui! - What happened?

91
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:22,239
Call an ambulance!

92
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,800
- Go! Call an ambulance! - Xiao Nuan!

93
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,800
I'm sorry. I didn't do it on purpose.

94
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,759
- What happened? - I'm sorry.

95
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:28,959
Get out of the way.

96
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,240
Who is this?

97
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,399
Who are you?

98
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,360
It's me.

99
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:36,920
Xiao Bai?

100
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:39,040
Xiao Bai!

101
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,279
- Get out of the way! - Han Hui.

102
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,480
Xiao Nuan.

103
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,000
Be careful.

104
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:50,399
Xiao Bai.

105
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,879
Here, Xiao Bai.

106
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:54,079
- Xiao Bai. - Xiao Bai.

107
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,800
Mr. Ye.

108
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,078
(Wen Xiao Nuan gets injured on set)

109
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:03,160
(Mo Xiao Bai shows up at "Blue Galaxy")

110
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:13,639
(Emergency)

111
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,759
Mr. Ye.

112
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,519
What's the situation?

113
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,720
The doctor is examining her.

114
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,439
Zhou Xiao Jing.

115
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:24,639
What are you doing?

116
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,398
Did you hire the assistant for nothing?

117
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,438
Sorry, Mr. Ye.

118
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:28,480
- It's my fault. - Why are you yelling?

119
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:30,079
It's not something in her control.

120
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:31,559
There were too many people at the scene.

121
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,759
It's inevitable that she'd lose focus.

122
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:36,079
No one wanted any accidents.

123
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,439
(Mr. Gao)

124
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:41,360
- Hello, Mr. Gao. - Xiao Jing.

125
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,040
News about Mo Xiao Bai taking Wen Xiao Nuan to the hospital...

126
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:45,079
on the headlines.

127
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,120
It's all over the Internet.

128
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:51,199
Mr. Gao, please give me a minute.

129
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,720
Mr. Ye, Mr. Gao is on the phone.

130
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:01,800
Rumors about Xiao Nuan are spreading.

131
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,439
I suggest the PR Department to issue a press release...

132
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,839
stating that Xiao Nuan was injured while filming...

133
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,199
and announce that Mo Xiao Bai is the male lead of "Blue Galaxy".

134
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,480
He was just kind enough to take Xiao Nuan to the hospital.

135
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,518
We can prevent the netizens from making assumptions...

136
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,959
or creating a bigger issue.

137
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,318
Mr. Ye, what do you think?

138
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,439
Go take care of it.

139
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,319
- Okay. - Xiao Jing.

140
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:25,120
Wen Xiao Nuan is an S-class artist.

141
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
To me...

142
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:31,199
To Anning,

143
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,159
she's an important talent resource.

144
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
She's very important.

145
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:45,919
Mr. Gao.

146
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:48,840
Issue a press release right away.

147
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:52,639
Fei Mo.

148
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,799
I'll get going too to avoid suspicion.

149
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:57,519
I'll come back to see Xiao Nuan after things have calmed down.

150
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:59,159
Don't go out without my permission.

151
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,639
Okay.

152
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:02,360
At least I can have tea with Aunt.

153
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:04,840
Don't be photographed by reporters.

154
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:05,919
Okay.

155
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:18,799
Han Hui, will they find out that it was us?

156
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,000
What are you afraid of?

157
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,330
Everyone knows...

158
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,240
that it was just an accident.

159
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:27,720
What should we do now?

160
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,159
The lead actress is injured.

161
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,450
We can't let the crew to wait for her and burn the money.

162
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,090
It's fate that let Han Hui get this role.

163
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,519
Get in.

164
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:46,759
Let's go to the hospital and see our poor heroine.

165
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,090
Luckily, we were cautious...

166
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:03,960
and came straight from the parking lot.

167
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,240
I didn't expect so many reporters to be here.

168
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,960
They're all here for Mo Xiao Bai.

169
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:17,639
Wen Xiao Nuan is just a rookie.

170
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:19,000
She doesn't have that much influence.

171
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,679
What's wrong, Han Hui?

172
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:36,639
Mr. Ye, Xiao Jing.

173
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,039
Director.

174
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,399
The reporters are outside the hospital.

175
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,519
They're waiting for an interview.

176
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:41,840
I've sent people to disperse them.

177
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,679
But they said they're waiting to write the news.

178
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,090
Mr. Ye, I'll handle it.

179
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:48,720
It's better for me to handle it.

180
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,120
Okay, please wait.

181
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,840
Please wait. Director Li will come out...

182
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:14,119
and give everyone an explanation.

183
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,159
Director Li will be here soon.

184
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,720
Step back.

185
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,479
Is Wen Xiao Nuan seriously injured?

186
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,959
Will it affect the filming of "Blue Galaxy"?

187
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,558
Is it true that Mo Xiao Bai is the male lead of "Blue Galaxy"?

188
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:23,599
Will "Blue Galaxy" change its female lead?

189
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,120
During the casting process, Han Hui was a popular choice.

190
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,240
Will you consider Han Hui?

191
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,159
As the director of "Blue Galaxy",

192
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,840
I've never received any notification about the casting change.

193
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,320
Director Li, why was Mo Xiao Bai on set?

194
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,000
What's his relationship with Wen Xiao Nuan?

195
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,399
- Director Li. - They're just co-workers.

196
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:37,720
They must be in a relationship.

197
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,519
This isn't the right place for this makeup.

198
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,120
The color of the lips is too strong.

199
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:45,720
Why didn't you remind me?

200
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:55,679
How about this?

201
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:05,919
Get me some gauze.

202
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,960
Okay.

203
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:39,720
Fei Mo.

204
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,240
How's Wen Xiao Nuan?

205
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,399
Is she badly hurt?

206
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,360
She's still in the emergency room.

207
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:56,840
There were too many people on set.

208
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,639
It was so chaotic.

209
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,399
Everyone rushed up to me.

210
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,559
I was so scared.

211
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:05,320
If it weren't for Linda,

212
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:07,679
I too would've...

213
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,639
No wonder you were in such a hurry.

214
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,320
If you didn't show up,

215
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:27,279
your wound would've already healed.

216
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,480
Ms. Han.

217
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,600
You're a good actress.

218
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,480
So...

219
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,440
you've already decided that I did it.

220
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:47,039
How did Wen Xiao Nuan get hurt?

221
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:48,720
You know it best.

222
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:50,720
I'm warning you.

223
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:51,960
Stay away from her.

224
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:54,320
Don't use your tricks on her.

225
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,919
You've already decided that it was me.

226
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:00,919
There's nothing I can say.

227
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,360
But Fei Mo...

228
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Fei Mo.

229
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,239
Do you remember how much you trusted me back then?

230
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,080
But now, we...

231
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,440
Are you Wen Xiao Nuan's family?

232
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,279
Please pay the bill.

233
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,440
From now on,

234
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,279
I don't want to hear any more of the past.

235
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,279
You...

236
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:26,279
don't want to know what I'm capable of.

237
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,879
Whether you believe me or not,

238
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,320
it's up to you.

239
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,279
I really didn't do it on purpose.

240
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,039
Han Hui.

241
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:57,200
No one...

242
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:59,000
can take away what's mine from me.

243
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:08,239
Director Li, why was Mo Xiao Bai on set?

244
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,398
What's his relationship with Wen Xiao Nuan?

245
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:10,399
They're just co-workers.

246
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,799
How can they just be co-workers?

247
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,398
That's right. They were so intimate.

248
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:14,639
Are they in a relationship?

249
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:25,080
Xiao Tian, have the flowers arrived?

250
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,519
Almost, Mr. Jiang.

251
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,519
Free up your afternoon.

252
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,759
Okay.

253
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,639
(Jiang Hao)

254
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,080
Mr. Jiang.

255
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,158
I was just on my way to see you to report to you in person...

256
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:54,360
about the situation of "Blue Galaxy".

257
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,480
You let Ye Fei Mo lead you by the nose.

258
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,960
Aurora Film couldn't even get a finger in the door.

259
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,960
And you want to report to me in person?

260
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,440
Report what?

261
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:04,039
Report how incompetent you are?

262
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:06,158
Li Can publicly admitted...

263
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:07,799
that Mo Xiao Bai is the male lead.

264
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:10,200
Why didn't you get any advance information?

265
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,080
Also, have you signed Han Hui?

266
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,679
I'm preparing the documents.

267
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:17,200
Jiang Fang.

268
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,599
I made you Aurora Film's vice president...

269
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,159
for Ling Er's sake.

270
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:22,399
I'm only giving you this chance...

271
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,039
because I heard you're a capable person.

272
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,039
I can give you this position,

273
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:27,519
but I can also give it to someone else.

274
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:42,320
Mr. Jiang, the flowers are here.

275
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,279
Forget the flowers.

276
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:46,439
Take the script to Linda.

277
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,600
Ask her what Han Hui thinks.

278
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:48,919
Okay.

279
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,639
Mr. Jiang, what about this afternoon?

280
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,559
- Proceed as usual. - Okay.

281
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:15,839
Con Panna plus two shots of espresso.

282
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,039
You still remember.

283
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:30,319
Xiao Jing.

284
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:31,799
Are you worried...

285
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,079
that Wen Xiao Nuan will get involved with Fei Mo?

286
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,240
No.

287
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,039
We've known each other for so long.

288
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,240
When have you ever been able to fool me?

289
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:45,200
If you're really worried about this,

290
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,479
why did you send Wen Xiao Nuan...

291
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,480
to Fei Mo back then?

292
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:52,799
Just because she looked like Han Hui back then?

293
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,319
I admit.

294
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,119
When I signed Wen Xiao Nuan,

295
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,650
it was because she looks like Han Hui back then.

296
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:03,839
But now, whatever happens between Wen Xiao Nuan and Mr. Ye...

297
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:06,000
is beyond my control.

298
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:09,519
Don't you think it's like drinking poison to quench your thirst?

299
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,920
So until I'm sure...

300
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,719
that Mr. Ye isn't using Wen Xiao Nuan...

301
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,240
as a substitute for Han Hui,

302
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:17,359
I don't dare to bet on anything.

303
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:19,559
What about you?

304
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:21,650
You're the one who trained Han Hui.

305
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,409
Now you're going to train Wen Xiao Nuan...

306
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:24,650
to be the next Han Hui.

307
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,319
To you,

308
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:27,920
isn't she also a substitute for Han Hui?

309
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:30,000
Wen Xiao Nuan and Han Hui are different.

310
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,680
You also know they're different.

311
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,000
So how can you be so sure...

312
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:35,119
that this medicine called Wen Xiao Nuan...

313
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:36,890
can't cure Fei Mo's mental illness?

314
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,278
Perhaps Fei Mo won't change...

315
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:40,480
for Wen Xiao Nuan.

316
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:43,559
Just like...

317
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:45,680
how you refuse to believe...

318
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,599
that I'd change for you.

319
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:52,920
The patient is awake.

320
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:54,170
Please take a look at her.

321
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:55,650
Okay.

322
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:57,440
Xiao Jing!

323
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:00,319
Where's my sister? How is she?

324
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,558
She's awake. Go see her.

325
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:02,680
How's my sister?

326
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:22,598
- Nuan Nuan. - Xiao Nuan.

327
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:24,170
- You're awake, Xiao Nuan.
- You're awake.

328
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,279
Who are you looking for?

329
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,440
I'm not looking for anyone.

330
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,240
Xiao Nuan, are you looking for your husband?

331
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,799
Is it that handsome guy?

332
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:42,240
Where's my handsome brother-in-law?

333
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:45,199
Xiao Kai, stop talking nonsense.

334
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,200
He's in the doctor's office.

335
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,759
He'll be here soon.

336
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,559
Do you want to sit up?

337
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:53,920
Slowly.

338
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:56,759
Can you do it?

339
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:00,890
Is this okay?

340
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:02,960
Xiao Jing.

341
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:06,200
When can I be discharged?

342
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,559
I'm afraid...

343
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:10,759
I'll delay the filming.

344
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,598
Xiao Jing, you're injured.

345
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:14,169
Why are you worried about other things?

346
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,920
Your health is the most important.

347
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,319
It's okay.

348
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:18,650
I can do it.

349
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:19,759
You can't.

350
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:22,799
My handsome brother-in-law.

351
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,649
Fei Mo, do you still remember me?

352
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:28,118
I'm her younger brother, Wen Kai.

353
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:29,240
Do you remember me?

354
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:31,240
Xiao Kai, stop it.

355
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:33,960
Fei Mo.

356
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:35,119
Go.

357
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:37,839
Fei Mo.

358
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:45,599
Fei Mo.

359
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,410
All the best.

360
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:49,410
Xiao Kai.

361
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,919
I'll get his autograph for you when he comes back.

362
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,920
Sure.

363
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:06,599
Handsome, right?

364
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,200
- Aunt. - Handsome guy.

365
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,440
You're back.

366
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,559
- You look good. - Aunt.

367
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,479
Just half a year and you've gotten prettier.

368
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,679
- Have I? - You look younger.

369
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,719
Really?

370
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,920
If we go out for a walk,

371
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:27,119
everyone will think we're dating.

372
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:28,919
All right.

373
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,959
You're such a sweet talker.

374
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,079
- Let's go. - Let's go.

375
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:32,359
Let's go inside.

376
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,839
So I rejected the other jobs...

377
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,240
and came back.

378
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,039
That's how he coaxed you to come back to ac?

379
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:42,559
Tell me about it.

380
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:45,119
For his little girlfriend, Wen Xiao Nuan,

381
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:47,200
I came back from abroad to act.

382
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:48,650
And this is how he treats me.

383
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,170
He won't let me go out...

384
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,959
or get photographed by the reporters.

385
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,839
I really don't know how she puts up with him.

386
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:56,039
Wen Xiao Nuan?

387
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:00,440
I wonder when Fei Mo will pursue her successfully.

388
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,319
They're not official?

389
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,200
You know his temper.

390
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:08,559
Making him say nice things...

391
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:10,559
is harder than climbing to the sky.

392
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:12,599
However,

393
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:15,559
I quite like Wen Xiao Nuan.

394
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:18,359
If things work out between them,

395
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,480
I'd be happy to see it happen.

396
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,358
You're praising her.

397
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:24,359
She must be nice.

398
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,640
A hero rescuing a damsel in distress.

399
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,960
What a great opportunity.

400
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:29,319
He didn't make it in time.

401
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:32,319
Fei Mo? Forget it.

402
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:35,079
It's good enough that he didn't make her angry.

403
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:38,599
That reminds me.

404
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,880
Listen.

405
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,279
You have to help him.

406
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,119
No problem. Leave it to me.

407
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,879
- Okay. - Aunt, have some tea.

408
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,959
It's a deal then.

409
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,440
- It's a deal. - Okay.

410
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,519
You're not going anywhere until the splint is removed.

411
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,519
Mr. Ye, are you here to see me?

412
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:09,720
I'm here to see an uncle.

413
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:11,960
I'm only seeing you in passing.

414
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,839
I want some of Jia Yi's soup.

415
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,518
It's hot. So hot.

416
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:53,720
Blow on it.

417
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:11,880
I'm talking about the soup.

418
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:13,799
It's hot.

419
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,079
Then...

420
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,359
are you still going to drink it?

421
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:34,480
I want to go back to the set soon.

422
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:35,839
No.

423
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:38,319
The doctor said you can't go anywhere.

424
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,720
You have to stay here and recuperate.

425
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:41,880
How do you know what the doctor said?

426
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,799
Aren't you only seeing me in passing?

427
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,400
In short, you're not going anywhere.

428
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,279
You can only stay here and recuperate.

429
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,720
Don't think too much.

430
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,400
What are you so happy about?

431
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,960
Nothing.

432
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,480
Nothing?

433
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:45,359
Come on, slowly.

434
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Jia Yi.

435
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,200
Say.

436
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,559
Does he like me...

437
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:57,079
a little bit?

438
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,799
You like him.

439
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,439
I don't like him.

440
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,200
Why would I like him?

441
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:10,160
He's sharp-tongued and picky.

442
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:12,519
He's a monster and a pervert.

443
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,480
No, he's not that kind of person.

444
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,640
He's not?

445
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:19,640
Jia Yi, you've gone bad.

446
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,720
Okay. Easy now.

447
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:22,920
Don't hurt yourself.

448
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:25,119
Silly girl.

449
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,879
Nuan Nuan, take care.

450
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,880
I'm leaving.

451
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,440
Xiao Nuan.

452
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,799
Why are you here?

453
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:45,000
Jia Yi just left.

454
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,920
I'm just here to visit you.

455
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,039
Just to visit me?

456
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,200
Yes.

457
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,359
But since Jia Yi just left,

458
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,519
I can only talk to these fruits.

459
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,599
No, Xiao Nuan.

460
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:09,640
I'm sorry.

461
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,799
Xiao Nuan.

462
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:16,079
I really don't know what to do.

463
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:20,039
I went to see Jia Yi.

464
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,720
She's been cold to me.

465
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,278
I didn't want to upset her,

466
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,359
so I stopped bothering her.

467
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:30,119
She's really mad this time.

468
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,160
But I swear. I'm serious about her.

469
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,519
Can you help me?

470
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,359
Jia Yi is a kind girl.

471
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,200
She trusts people easily.

472
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,559
She's also very smart.

473
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,759
She knew everything about you, but she didn't expose you...

474
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,839
and waited for you to confess.

475
00:28:56,599 --> 00:28:58,880
I helped you hide it from her...

476
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,200
because I thought...

477
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,799
she was happy during that time.

478
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,559
I also hoped that someone...

479
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,839
could take her out of the past...

480
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,480
and start over.

481
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,079
We all saw...

482
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,960
what you've done for her.

483
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,720
I believe that you truly love her.

484
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,279
Actually, that day,

485
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,319
what you said at the cafe...

486
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,680
might have just been for fun.

487
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,359
You might think it's a bit silly...

488
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,279
that things turned out this way.

489
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,160
But I know her too well.

490
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:39,839
Because of what she's been through,

491
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,039
she has become less confident.

492
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,440
She's afraid she's not that important to you.

493
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,440
She's afraid she'll get hurt again.

494
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:53,400
So if you really love her,

495
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,559
when she takes a step back,

496
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:59,000
you have to take one more step forward.

497
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,039
You have to show her that you love her with your actions.

498
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:06,759
Give her the courage and confidence...

499
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,920
to open her heart again.

500
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,319
Are you even listening to me?

501
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,599
Can you...

502
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,440
get me Jia Yi's...

503
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,720
recent schedule?

504
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:26,960
Now we're talking.

505
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,880
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

506
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,359
But I'm telling you.

507
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:31,680
If you...

508
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,680
Be careful.

509
00:30:33,681 --> 00:30:35,278
If you make her sad again,

510
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:36,319
you're done for.

511
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:38,200
Don't worry.

512
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:40,160
I'll make her happy.

513
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,039
I believe you.

514
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,640
Come in.

515
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,039
Mr. Jiang.

516
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:51,480
You got rejected again?

517
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,119
Ms. Linda said it's not a good time.

518
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:57,119
That's just an excuse.

519
00:30:57,759 --> 00:30:58,799
What did Han Hui say?

520
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,558
Are there any other projects recently?

521
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:07,119
A few good ones are here.

522
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,759
What's all this?

523
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,160
("Magpie Bridge")

524
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:59,318
This script is also about Cowherd and Weaver Girl.

525
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:01,559
And it's of good quality.

526
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,720
I suppose there's always a way out.
