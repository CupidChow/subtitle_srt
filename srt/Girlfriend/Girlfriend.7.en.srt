1
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,119
Jiang Fang, you said you have a gift for me.

2
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,200
What's the gift?

3
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:44,359
Hold on.

4
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,840
("Blue Galaxy")

5
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,238
("Blue Galaxy" Screenplay Copyright)

6
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:01,840
"'Blue Galaxy' Screenplay Copyright"?

7
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:03,640
Isn't this Anning's movie?

8
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,879
It's no longer Anning's movie.

9
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,680
I've registered the copyright.

10
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,399
Do you mean...

11
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,479
that Aurora has the screenplay copyright now?

12
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:12,919
Does that mean...

13
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,810
Aurora has all rights to the project?

14
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,840
Yes.

15
00:02:15,841 --> 00:02:17,400
Jiang Fang, you're amazing.

16
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:19,879
- Here, have a drink. - Here.

17
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:26,919
Who is it?

18
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:30,879
I'm coming.

19
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,680
Jiang Fang.

20
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:37,879
Ms. Wen.

21
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,680
This is my and Jiang Fang's house.

22
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:40,759
What are you doing here?

23
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,680
("Blue Galaxy")

24
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,039
Jiang Fang.

25
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,639
Why do you have the script for "Blue Galaxy"?

26
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:02,240
I've registered the copyright.

27
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,879
Are you here to congratulate me?

28
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,158
Doesn't this belong to Anning?

29
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,520
Why did you register it?

30
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You took it from Ye Fei Mo.

31
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,840
You contributed to Aurora's honor.

32
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,520
I gave the script to Ye Fei Mo's assistant.

33
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,080
So you colluded with Lin Zheng.

34
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,840
You used me to steal the script, didn't you?

35
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,479
"Steal the script"?

36
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,960
I don't know what you're talking about.

37
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:29,199
I don't care who it belonged to before.

38
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:30,438
I've registered it now.

39
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:31,878
The regulations are very clear.

40
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,240
It's protected by the law.

41
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,759
Jiang Fang,

42
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,520
when did you become so despicable?

43
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,080
Ms. Wen.

44
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:44,479
You can't just say whatever you want.

45
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,840
I could sue you for defamation.

46
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,439
You know what you did.

47
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,199
This is despicable.

48
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,680
It's the lowest form of filth.

49
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,439
Filthy?

50
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,159
No one is filthier than you, Ms. Wen.

51
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:01,120
You seduced Ye Fei Mo for money.

52
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,038
You have a new lover, but
you can't forget the old one.

53
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,520
You harass my fiancé every day.

54
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:05,919
Ms. Jiang,

55
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,080
don't assume others are the same as you.

56
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,599
You...

57
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,199
Mr. Ye.

58
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,480
You two...

59
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:17,800
are so bold.

60
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,959
You messed with my project and my people.

61
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,638
If you're talking about "Blue Galaxy",

62
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,680
I'm sorry.

63
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:25,050
It's not yours anymore.

64
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:28,680
I thought...

65
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:30,079
you had some tricks up your sleeve.

66
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:32,319
But it's just a bunch of underhanded tricks.

67
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:33,610
The means don't matter.

68
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:34,800
The result is all that matters.

69
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,518
Aurora can use this project...

70
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:37,959
to steal overseas resources.

71
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,800
Anning's days of monopolizing the industry...

72
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,079
are gone forever.

73
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,438
What?

74
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:53,518
I met up with an old friend.

75
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,839
Are you going to interfere too?

76
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,610
Don't you know yet?

77
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,279
What you registered...

78
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,920
isn't the real screenplay of "Blue Galaxy".

79
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,199
(Declaration)

80
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:14,610
You set me up.

81
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:16,439
If this evidence...

82
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:18,610
gets out,

83
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,120
I'm afraid you and Aurora...

84
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:23,170
will be ruined.

85
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,439
What do you want?

86
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,480
When "Blue Galaxy" is released,

87
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:29,319
Aurora must give up 100 percent of screenings.

88
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,360
That's impossible.

89
00:05:30,361 --> 00:05:31,638
Mr. Jiang, haven't you always wanted...

90
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:32,959
to be a part of "Blue Galaxy"?

91
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:34,319
I'll give you a chance.

92
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,399
Give up on your share of the first week's box office...

93
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,199
for publicity expenses.

94
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,600
The choice is yours.

95
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,040
Mr. Jiang.

96
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:44,439
Ms. Jiang.

97
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'll get going.

98
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,119
Right.

99
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,399
I'll leave this appraisal with you.

100
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,240
Study it.

101
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,120
What's wrong?

102
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:20,040
Did you know about Jiang Fang's plan?

103
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,279
Yes.

104
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:27,600
That's why you set a trap.

105
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,119
You used me to lull Lin Zheng...

106
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,560
so Jiang Fang would take the bait, right?

107
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:33,439
Yes.

108
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:36,160
So you're all the same.

109
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,480
Explain.

110
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,720
How are we the same?

111
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,160
You're both using me.

112
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:45,920
You and Jiang Fang...

113
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,720
are no different.

114
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,000
How can we be no different?

115
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,319
He set me up first.

116
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:55,079
I'm just giving him a taste of his own medicine.

117
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,360
What's wrong with that?

118
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,240
That's right.

119
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,839
It's my honor...

120
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,560
to be used by you.

121
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,879
Jiang Fang used you to steal the script.

122
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:07,439
Instead of being mad at him,

123
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,560
you're here throwing a tantrum.

124
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,839
So in your eyes,

125
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:13,399
am I throwing a tantrum?

126
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,560
Aren't you?

127
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,439
Or maybe...

128
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,920
you still have feelings for him.

129
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:25,519
Whether I have feelings for Jiang Fang...

130
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,278
and whether you're using me...

131
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:28,360
are two different matters.

132
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,399
Two different matters?

133
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:33,359
Fine.

134
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,600
I'll settle this with you.

135
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:36,758
Didn't you approach me...

136
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:37,839
with a mission from my mom?

137
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:39,120
How noble is that?

138
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,439
You're right.

139
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:44,000
I have no right to criticize you.

140
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,639
Between us, we're just pawns who used each other.

141
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,680
We didn't have any feelings for each other.

142
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,720
I signed a contract with Xiao Jing.

143
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,560
According to our agreement,

144
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,920
I was supposed to get on your good side...

145
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,879
and accompany you to tonight's banquet.

146
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,839
I'll get paid for completing my mission.

147
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,240
That's all.

148
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,720
Am I just a mission to you?

149
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,040
Yes.

150
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,879
Nothing more.

151
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,079
What's going on?

152
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,759
I got the script from Lin Zheng.

153
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
He said he got authorization from the scriptwriter.

154
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:28,959
How could you be so careless?

155
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,839
This concerns Aurora's reputation.

156
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:32,239
Couldn't you verify it further?

157
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,089
That's enough, Ling Er. It's useless to say all this now.

158
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,879
What's important now is to think of a way to fix it.

159
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,360
How will we fix it?

160
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,000
The news has already been released.

161
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,759
For now, we'll promise Anning
to give 100 percent of screenings.

162
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:45,759
Do you think my brother will agree?

163
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:47,480
I'll deal with Mr. Jiang.

164
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:48,839
The most important thing now...

165
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,679
is to prevent this scandal from spreading...

166
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,210
and affecting Aurora's reputation.

167
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:54,479
Then what? You'll just let him get away with it?

168
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,480
How is that possible?

169
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:57,330
Ye Fei Mo played me for a fool.

170
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:58,519
I must get back at him.

171
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,960
I'll bring him down from his position as top dog.

172
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,210
What can you do?

173
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:08,399
Tonight is Han Hui's homecoming banquet...

174
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:09,878
If we win over Han Hui...

175
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:11,240
and get her to sign with Aurora,

176
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:13,360
then even without "Blue Galaxy",

177
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,559
I can still make our company...

178
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:17,210
number one in the industry.

179
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,678
- Slowly. - Slow down.

180
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:22,799
Run slowly.

181
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,960
Stop! Don't run!

182
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,000
Hello, Xiao Kai.

183
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,279
Xiao Nuan,

184
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,518
the landlord is here to collect the debt.

185
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,638
You guys, take everything away.

186
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,360
When can you transfer the money?

187
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,450
What?

188
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,719
Why is it so soon?

189
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,759
Sir!

190
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,158
Take everything away.

191
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:00,239
You can't take that drum!

192
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,278
Xiao Kai.

193
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,599
My mom left that drum for me!

194
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,480
- Don't take this! - Go away!

195
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:05,960
Mr. Dong!

196
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:07,210
Xiao Kai.

197
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:08,639
Xiao Kai!

198
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:10,759
Hey, Xiao Nuan.

199
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:12,678
They took all the valuable items...

200
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,240
in the theater!

201
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:18,210
I'm sorry.

202
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,210
I'm useless.

203
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:23,159
This troupe...

204
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:25,879
I might not be able to save this troupe.

205
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,399
Xiao Kai.

206
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,879
Xiao Kai?

207
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:13,000
Ye Fei Mo, strategic plan.

208
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,399
Ye Fei Mo.

209
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,759
CEO of Anning Culture.

210
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,240
Arrogant and ruthless.

211
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,278
Within a few years of taking over,

212
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,519
he brought Anning to the top of the industry.

213
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:25,799
But his personal life is a mess.

214
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,279
He has had countless scandals.

215
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,798
He likes extreme sports.

216
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:29,879
He's good at rock climbing.

217
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,600
I put a lot of effort into cooking today.

218
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,360
But he said it was bad.

219
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,199
He said a lot of nonsense too.

220
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,279
He's crazy.

221
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:40,480
He has a stomachache today.

222
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,039
It's so scary.

223
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,120
He's so strong,

224
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:46,399
but he's so fragile when he's sick.

225
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:48,639
It breaks my heart to see him like that.

226
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:51,240
I have to take good care of him.

227
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,840
(Nutritious recipe)

228
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:01,200
(Acute gastroenteritis)

229
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,279
(Add plenty of ladybell root and lily bulbs)

230
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,159
(Wen Xiao Nuan)

231
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,320
Sorry, the number you dialed is unavailable.

232
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:31,240
(Wen Xiao Nuan)

233
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,720
Sorry, the number you dialed is unavailable.

234
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:43,600
(Zhou Xiao Jing)

235
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:47,119
Hello, Mr. Ye.

236
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,320
Do you know where Wen Xiao Nuan is?

237
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,440
Isn't she with you?

238
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:52,879
She didn't go back to the villa.

239
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:54,679
Where could she be?

240
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,759
She gave me an address before.

241
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,960
I'll send it to you now.

242
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,360
(Wen Xiao Nuan's address)

243
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,799
Music Fountain Park.

244
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,399
It's my favorite place.

245
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:39,679
I'll take you there next time.

246
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,359
Ms. Cheng,

247
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,398
Mr. Ye called and said...

248
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:46,759
he had a fight with Wen Xiao Nuan.

249
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,320
Wen Xiao Nuan is missing now.

250
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:50,080
Do you think something happened?

251
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,120
They're just young people having a spat.

252
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:53,279
Don't be so nervous.

253
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:55,798
But Han Hui's homecoming banquet is tonight.

254
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:57,679
I'm worried something might happen.

255
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,679
Should we make other plans?

256
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,519
No need.

257
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,360
I believe Wen Xiao Nuan can do a good job.

258
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,679
Do you think so highly of Wen Xiao Nuan?

259
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,519
Yes.

260
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:12,479
Because I've never seen...

261
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,039
Fei Mo care so much about a girl before.

262
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:27,799
I've been looking all over for you.

263
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,600
Why didn't you answer your phone?

264
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,679
I'm not your slave.

265
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,240
Why should I answer your call?

266
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:42,240
You have a contract with Zhou Xiao Jing.

267
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,440
You have one day left.

268
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:44,879
You have to execute it.

269
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:46,879
Come with me.

270
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,600
International superstar Han Hui arrived at the airport today.

271
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,079
Aurora will hold a welcome party...

272
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,919
for Han Hui at 12pm today.

273
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,079
Han Hui was once a contracted artist at Anning Culture.

274
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,518
Now she's with Aurora Film.

275
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,840
This change is intriguing.

276
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,439
We look forward to seeing Han Hui...

277
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,918
on domestic screens again...

278
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:35,799
and bringing us great works.

279
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:38,360
What are you doing?

280
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:39,879
What are you doing?

281
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,399
Be gentle. I'm ticklish.

282
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:45,919
It's so ticklish.

283
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,440
It hurts!

284
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,279
This one will do.

285
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:17,889
Mr. Ye,

286
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:20,170
this dress has been reserved by another customer.

287
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,599
She will be picking it up in 10 minutes.

288
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,039
It's okay.

289
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,079
I think the previous ones are okay.

290
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:31,410
I'll take it.

291
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,039
But...

292
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:37,410
Okay.

293
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,480
Hello.

294
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:21,038
I'm here to pick up Han Hui's dress.

295
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,170
Okay, just a moment.

296
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:27,079
These two.

297
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,039
One is missing.

298
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:31,200
The sea blue one.

299
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:33,169
I'm really sorry.

300
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:35,519
Another customer just bought that dress.

301
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,079
Han Hui wanted that dress.

302
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,759
We even reserved it.

303
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,798
Why did you let another customer buy it?

304
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:45,960
I'm really sorry.

305
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:47,889
You only paid the deposit.

306
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,359
But you didn't say which dress you wanted.

307
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:52,000
So there's nothing I can do.

308
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,000
What do you mean there's nothing you can do?

309
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:56,720
Today's banquet is very important to Ms. Han.

310
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,720
Can you take responsibility if something goes wrong?

311
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,410
I'm really sorry.

312
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:02,439
But that dress is gone.

313
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,799
These two are pretty too.

314
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:27,410
Wait.

315
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:33,119
What are you doing?

316
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,720
Turn around.

317
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,758
This is too expensive. I can't...

318
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:04,799
Turn around.

319
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:07,920
Come on.

320
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,559
You're my date tonight.

321
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,359
Ye Fei Mo's woman.

322
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:18,960
You have to be pretty.

323
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,559
After tonight,

324
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,279
your job is done.

325
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:33,839
Soon,

326
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:36,599
you'll get your commission.

327
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,480
Let's go.

328
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,200
This way, please.

329
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:12,920
Hello, Mr. Ye.

330
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:16,119
This way, please.

331
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:36,519
Who is this?

332
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:38,359
Isn't this Mr. Ye from Anning Culture?

333
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,679
Who's the girl next to him?

334
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,680
She's so pretty.

335
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,160
She's even wearing Rose's Tear.

336
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:04,160
Fei Mo is going all out this time.

337
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,000
What's Rose's Tear?

338
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,279
It's a Ye family heirloom.

339
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:09,440
Fei Mo.

340
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,519
- You're late. - You're late.

341
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,920
Director Li Can.

342
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,680
I can't believe I ran into him here.

343
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:30,720
Am I dreaming?

344
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:35,359
Say hello.

345
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,640
Mr. Gu, hello.

346
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,720
Wen Xiao Nuan,

347
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:44,200
you're so pretty today.

348
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,920
I almost didn't recognize you.

349
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:47,079
You don't look like yourself.

350
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,440
Who's this?

351
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,079
The little nurse.

352
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:55,559
Hello.

353
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,559
Hello, I'm Wen Xiao Nuan.

354
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,920
Wen Xiao Nuan.

355
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,279
Sure enough, she didn't disappoint me.

356
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,079
Ms. Cheng,

357
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,798
why did Mr. Ye put Rose's Tear...

358
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:37,039
on Wen Xiao Nuan?

359
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,039
It's just what I wanted.

360
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,358
(A glorious star is coming)

361
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:04,400
(On Aurora's night)
