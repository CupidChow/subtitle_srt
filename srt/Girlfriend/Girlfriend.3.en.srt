(Gu Yun Zhou)

3
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:12,719
Fei Mo,

4
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,120
are we having the video conference or not?

5
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:16,199
I'm a bit busy today.

6
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,090
- You take care of it. - Are you serious?

7
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:57,719
Yes!

8
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:58,919
I got to stay.

9
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:30,400
Thank you for taking me in, Mr. Ye.

10
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,800
Do you know Jiang Ling Er from Aurora...

11
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,199
and her fiancé?

12
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:38,439
Why aren't you saying anything?

13
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,039
That's my personal business.

14
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,718
You were in the rain all night.

15
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:49,719
Do you want to die?

16
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,080
Take some medicine.

17
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,319
- Thank you. - Get well and leave.

18
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,120
(Aurora Film Co. Ltd.)

19
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,519
Hello, Mr. Jiang.

20
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,759
- Hello, Mr. Jiang.
- Hello, Mr. Jiang.

21
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,439
Hello, Mr. Jiang.

22
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,480
Hello, Mr. Jiang.

23
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,759
Hello, Mr. Jiang.

24
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:42,920
(Today last year, Jiangcheng,
plum blossom viewing in May)

25
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,839
Nuan Nuan,

26
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,519
I'll succeed for sure.

27
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,240
Wait for me.

28
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,480
Mr. Ye said...

29
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,759
I have to leave when I get better.

30
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:14,480
That means...

31
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:16,639
I'm staying.

32
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,050
Yes!

33
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:21,279
Step one was a success.

34
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,680
Step two.

35
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,680
Find a base of operations.

36
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:17,000
Luckily, I have Mo Xiao Bai with me.

37
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:36,560
You're sleeping well.

38
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:43,360
You even had time to do your hair.

39
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,160
You've changed your clothes too.

40
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,398
My hair and clothes were too dirty,

41
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:56,199
so I refreshed myself.

42
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,439
Your fever is gone. Get going.

43
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,680
No, I...

44
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,279
I still have a fever, Mr. Ye.

45
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:18,519
Mr. Ye,

46
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,999
if you don't believe me,

47
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,240
I'll measure it for you.

48
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,240
Mr. Ye,

49
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,920
I'll take my temperature.

50
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,920
Let me see. Give it to me.

51
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,959
It's still so high even after taking medicine.

52
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,360
How pitiful.

53
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,639
I think you need a shot.

54
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:06,959
A shot?

55
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,199
No! Gently, Mr. Ye! Gently!

56
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,720
If your fever were to reach 42℃,

57
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,600
you would be a corpse.

58
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,840
Why did my mom send someone...

59
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:36,240
who doesn't stand a fighting chance?

60
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,158
Tell Zhou Xiao Jing,

61
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,239
"Game over."

62
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,278
Mr. Ye, give me another chance.

63
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,559
This job is really important to me.

64
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,759
I really need that money.

65
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,000
How much are they paying you?

66
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,090
I'll pay you double.

67
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:54,278
It's not about the money.

68
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:56,039
Honesty is very important.

69
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,210
Honesty?

70
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,799
How dare you talk to me about honesty?

71
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:02,330
Mr. Ye,

72
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,278
please give me another chance.

73
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,878
I'll do my best.

74
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:06,879
No way.

75
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,399
I'm not the first, am I?

76
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:13,450
What do you mean?

77
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:15,960
I mean the people they sent.

78
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,398
Think about it.

79
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,479
If you replace me,

80
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,559
won't your mom send someone else?

81
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:23,398
Each one will keep being replaced.

82
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:24,799
Aren't you tired of it?

83
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,330
Just keep using me.

84
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:27,960
I'll be your shield.

85
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,480
Won't you have peace that way?

86
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,840
I can take care of your meals too.

87
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,360
I'll stay in the nanny's room.

88
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,879
I won't bother you.

89
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:42,840
Stuffed bean sprouts.

90
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:44,039
Stir-fried pork with egg whites.

91
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:47,679
Do you not know how to make those?

92
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,918
Leave if you don't know how to make those.

93
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:50,239
I know how to make those.

94
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,279
I'll go now.

95
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,919
Wait.

96
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:54,039
I'm not done yet.

97
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:56,039
Drunken shrimp.

98
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:57,039
Braised pufferfish.

99
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,089
Butterfly fish maw.

100
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,158
Shrimp with truffles.

101
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:00,239
Stuffed bitter gourd.

102
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,278
Pork tripe stuffed with chicken.

103
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,479
American roast duck.

104
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,518
Foie gras in red wine.

105
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,559
Braised duck feet.

106
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,239
Got it?

107
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,330
I won't repeat it.

108
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:11,799
Got it.

109
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:13,719
Stuffed bean sprouts,
stir-fried pork with egg whites,

110
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,119
drunken shrimp, braised pufferfish,

111
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,679

112
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:18,278
stuffed bitter gourd, pork tripe stuffed with chicken,

00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:19,638
American roast duck, foie gras in red wine,

114
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:20,759
and braised duck feet.

115
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,120
Something like that.

116
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:27,450
Well,

117
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,759
Mr. Ye,

118
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:31,600
how about something more homely?

119
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:33,279
Do it or leave.

120
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:34,960
Dinner will be ready.

121
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:48,089
Shrimp with truffles.

122
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,720
Braised pufferfish.

123
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,000
Where can I find it?

124
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,330
And foie gras in red wine.

125
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,279
(7 Missed Calls from Xiao Kai)

126
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,079
Hey, Xiao Kai, why did
you call me so many times?

127
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,279
Did something happen to the troupe?

128
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,600
No, the troupe is fine. It's just that...

129
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,798
The landlord comes to check on us every day.

130
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:18,440
But since that day,

131
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,519
no one has come to cause trouble.

132
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,519
But I'm a bit worried about you, Xiao Nuan.

133
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,839
I haven't heard from you in the past two days.

134
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,878
Are you all right?

135
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:27,960
I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

136
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:29,519
Just protect the troupe.

137
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:31,679
I'll get the money after this.

138
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,039
Xiao Nuan, don't do anything stupid.

139
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,600
What are you talking about?

140
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,678
I just took on...

141
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:39,600
a challenging job.

142
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:44,599
What would you do if your boss asked you...

143
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,120
to prepare a bunch of fancy dishes?

144
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,679
Buy them for him, then.

145
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,079
Don't they sell everything...

146
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,120
in your big city?

147
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,480
That's right.

148
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:57,840
Why do I have to buy groceries and cook them myself?

149
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,479
I have to go, Xiao Kai.

150
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,159
- I'm hanging up. Bye. - Bye.

151
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,879
I must succeed this time.

152
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,600
If he keeps eating like this,

153
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,960
I'll go broke...

154
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,639
before I get my reward.

155
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:19,279
(Peony Pavilion)

156
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:37,559
Mr. Ye.

157
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,960
Mr. Ye, come down and eat.

158
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:58,759
Mr. Ye, try this.

159
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,240
Did you make all this?

160
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,080
I did.

161
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,080
It tastes like Peony Pavilion.

162
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,918
If you're ordering food elsewhere...

163
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:22,080
to take care of my meals,

164
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:24,600
how is it different from ordering takeout myself?

165
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,639
Is he not eating it?

166
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:36,799
I spent a lot of money on it.

167
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,200
Hello?

168
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:54,840
Nuan Nuan, are you free?

169
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:56,638
What is it, Jia Yi? What's wrong?

170
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,079
I was on my way to the set.

171
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,519
I was in a minor accident.

172
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:01,519
The driver won't let me leave.

173
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,720
I'm waiting for the traffic police.

174
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:05,159
What? Are you okay?

175
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,038
I'm fine. I'm physically fine.

176
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:08,080
I'm not hurt.

177
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,878
But I can't make it to the set.

178
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:12,519
Can you fill in for me?

179
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:13,719
There aren't many lines.

180
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,798
I already agreed to take the role.

181
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:15,840
I can't flake now.

182
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:17,919
I've sent you the address.

183
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,639
Okay, let me take a look.

184
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,600
(Studio No. 7, 11 minutes, 3.5km)

185
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,918
Hey, Jia Yi, I'm nearby.

186
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:27,960
I can go now.

187
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,399
Thank you.

188
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:30,759
Okay, bye.

189
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,558
Miss, I'm sorry.

190
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:49,119
You can hit me or punish
me. I have no complaints.

191
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,638
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

192
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,720
I...

193
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:55,799
Give me a hand.

194
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,039
Coming.

195
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,279
Why is it her?

196
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:02,440
Ling Er,

197
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,719
you've been filming for so long.

198
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,600
You must be tired. Hang in there.

199
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:06,719
When this scene is over,

200
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,799
you can go home.

201
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,360
All right.

202
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,639
Maid,

203
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:14,038
why are you just standing there?

204
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:15,080
Turn around.

205
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:26,200
It's you.

206
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:29,600
Do you know each other?

207
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,919
Yes.

208
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,038
We're familiar with each other.

209
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:34,639
I'll take good care of her.

210
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,720
All right.

211
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,600
Everyone, get ready.

212
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:47,719
Three, two, one.

213
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,799
Action.

214
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,279
Miss, I'm sorry.

215
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,320
It's all my fault.

216
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,000
Miss, please calm down.

217
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,360
You can hit me or punish me.

218
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,759
I have no complaints.

219
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,240
No complaints?

220
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,080
Ling Er,

221
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,639
the script is...

222
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,440
the young lady kicks the maid out.

223
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:15,960
Just kick her out.

224
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:17,959
Director, I'm sorry.

225
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,159
I'm making a last-minute change.

226
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,518
I think the character can be more perfect this way.

227
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,759
That wasn't a good take.

228
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:24,039
Let's do it again.

229
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,080
Okay.

230
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,080
Okay, retake. One more time.

231
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:37,320
Miss, I'm sorry.

232
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:38,799
It's all my fault.

233
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,320
Let's get some more light here.

234
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,678
- Mr. Gu, why are you here?
- Miss, please calm down.

235
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:46,278
- It's nothing. I'm just observing.
- Okay.

236
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:47,600
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

237
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:51,879
No complaints?

238
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,239
Miss, please calm down.

239
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,440
You can hit me or punish me.

240
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:08,599
I have no complaints.

241
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,720
Director.

242
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,240
Is this slapping...

243
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,720
going to continue?

244
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,278
Mr. Gu, as you know,

245
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:17,960
Ling Er is the young lady of Aurora.

246
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:19,358
If she wants a do-over,

247
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,440
there's nothing we can do.

248
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,278
Okay, let's do it again.

249
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:26,279
Okay, get ready.

250
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:27,410
(Ye Fei Mo)

251
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,410
(Video call)

252
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:29,410
(Ye Fei Mo)

253
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:34,039
(Gu Yun Zhou invites you to a video call)

254
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,240
Fei Mo,

255
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,799
your little nurse is being bullied.

256
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:44,799
What does that have to do with me?

257
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,650
All right, get ready. Come on.

258
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,799
Miss, please calm down.

259
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,319
You can hit me or punish me.

260
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:59,680
I have no complaints.

261
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:02,119
Stop.

262
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,440
That's enough, Ling Er.

263
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:05,798
You've already slapped her several times.

264
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:06,799
That's a pass.

265
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
That won't do.

266
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:10,000
I'm a perfectionist.

267
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:11,680
It has to be perfect.

268
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:17,599
All right, then. Well...

269
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,319
Let's do one more take.

270
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,799
How many takes has it been?

271
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,170
Almost 10.

272
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:29,680
Are you just watching?

273
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,758
Fei Mo,

274
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:32,759
if you don't say anything,
I don't dare to interfere.

275
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,039
Director.

276
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:41,000
I think that's enough.

277
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,319
It's not easy for the girl.

278
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:43,440
That's enough.

279
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,759
I think so too.

280
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:49,318
Ling Er, we have enough material.

281
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:50,319
That's enough.

282
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:52,119
Okay, I'm tired too.

283
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:53,839
Let's do one last take.

284
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Get ready.

285
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,479
Ready, let's go again. Come on.

286
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,680
Three, two, one. Action.

287
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:28,798
Director, I'm sorry.

288
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,319
I dropped my handkerchief.

289
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:31,479
It's okay.

290
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,680
We can use the previous take.

291
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,200
Mr. Wang,

292
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:53,039
for the "Smiling Beauty" project,

293
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,440
either replace Jiang Ling Er...

294
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:57,680
or Anning will withdraw our investment.

295
00:19:58,279 --> 00:19:59,279
It's up to you.

296
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:00,890
You have until the end of today...

297
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,039
to give me an answer.

298
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,318
It's finally over. I'm so tired.

299
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:11,319
That's right.

300
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,680
Are we still shooting tomorrow?

301
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,680
We'll see.

302
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:17,078
You made me look bad.

303
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:18,440
You want to leave just like that?

304
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:19,960
I didn't have enough fun acting just now.

305
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,599
It hurts.

306
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,799
So you know it hurts.

307
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:31,170
Do you want to know...

308
00:20:31,171 --> 00:20:32,410
how it feels to be slapped?

309
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:52,000
In front of the camera,

310
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:53,279
I let you hit me...

311
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:55,000
because of my professional integrity.

312
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,278
But that doesn't mean...

313
00:20:56,279 --> 00:20:57,440
you can keep bullying me off-camera.

314
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:00,200
You're richer and more influential than me,

315
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,480
but at the core, you and I are equals.

316
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,200
You're doing this to me because of Jiang Fang.

317
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:06,890
Fine, let me tell you.

318
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,650
From the day you started dating Jiang Fang,

319
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:11,279
I didn't want him anymore.

320
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,200
You can have him if you want.

321
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,318
Don't play such a dirty trick...

322
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:16,410
to degrade yourself.

323
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:18,920
Don't provoke me anymore,

324
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,319
Ms. Jiang.

325
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:23,319
You...

326
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:29,240
Yes, I'll listen to you.

327
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,680
Director,

328
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,960
I think everything else is fine.

329
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:48,359
But the costumes don't look good.

330
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,799
I think the costumes...

331
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,039
Hello, Director.

332
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,519
I heard Jiang Ling Er hit Wen Xiao Nuan today.

333
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,880
Wen Xiao Nuan.

334
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,319
The one who came to replace you?

335
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:20,759
- Yes. - We're done for the day. She left.

336
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,000
That poor girl.

337
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,279
Jiang Ling Er bullied her badly today.

338
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:27,519
She's probably in a bad mood.

339
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,640
Jia Yi,

340
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,880
even though you recommended her,

341
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,119
my hands were tied.

342
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,639
It's okay. Thank you, Director.

343
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,279
- I'll go find my friend, then. - Okay.

344
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,319
Mr. Gu.

345
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:49,559
Mr. Gu?

346
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:50,680
Mr. Gu?

347
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:53,000
We were talking about the costumes.

348
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:56,319
The costumes.

349
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,200
The costumes...

350
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,200
look nice.

351
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:01,880
They look nice?

352
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,119
Didn't you just say they don't look good?

353
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:17,079
Nuan Nuan!

354
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,920
- Nuan Nuan. - Jia Yi.

355
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:21,279
I'm sorry.

356
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,119
I'm sorry.

357
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,160
My goodness. Why is your face so swollen?

358
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,079
It's my fault. I shouldn't
have asked you to fill in.

359
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:30,759
You've suffered so much because of me.

360
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:33,359
It's all right, Jia Yi.
It's not your fault.

361
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,759
Jiang Ling Er is the young lady of Aurora.

362
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,119
She has always been overbearing.

363
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,119
She's such a bully.

364
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:41,680
She has gone too far.

365
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:47,000
Jiang Ling Er was targeting me.

366
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,319
Targeting you?

367
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:50,359
Why?

368
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:52,680
I broke up with Jiang Fang.

369
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,880
The woman he cheated on me with...

370
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,200
is Jiang Ling Er.

371
00:23:58,799 --> 00:23:59,799
Jiang Ling Er?

372
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:03,400
You two...

373
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,759
It's all right, Jia Yi.

374
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,279
I've calmed down a lot.

375
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:09,880
Between love and money,

376
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:11,599
he chose money.

377
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:14,399
He's not worth my heartbreak.

378
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,599
There's nothing to miss.

379
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,480
All I can think about now...

380
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,240
is Fusheng Theater Troupe.

381
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,919
If I can't raise money soon,

382
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,239
the landlord will sell the theater.

383
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,480
We won't be able to keep the troupe.

384
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,880
Is it that serious?

385
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,160
Why didn't you tell me?

386
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,078
It's all my fault. I've been working out of town.

387
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:35,559
I didn't have time to care about you.

388
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,319
How could I blame you?

389
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,439
I'm already grateful...

390
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,680
that you let me stay at your place.

391
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,240
I shouldn't add to your stress.

392
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,240
By the way, I still have some savings.

393
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:47,758
I don't know if it's enough.

394
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:48,799
It's fine.

395
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,319
I got a job.

396
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,479
As long as I can get Ye Fei Mo...

397
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,518
within the allotted time,

398
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:55,879
I'll get a lot of money.

399
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,000
Then the troupe will be saved.

400
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,640
Ye Fei Mo?

401
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:00,960
The CEO of Anning Culture?

402
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:04,519
Nuan Nuan,

403
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,679
you can't become a rich man's plaything...

404
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,119
just to get back at Jiang Fang.

405
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,159
How is that possible?

406
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,319
Am I that kind of person?

407
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,999
I forgot I went to the supermarket
to buy groceries for Ye Fei Mo.

408
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Supermarket?

409
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:20,798
They must be closed at this hour.

410
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:21,838
Closed?

411
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:22,839
I'm doomed.

412
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,239
Jia Yi, you should go home too.

413
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,558
Let me know when you get home. I'm leaving. Bye.

414
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:27,039
- Let me know if you need anything. - Okay.

415
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:59,559
Is this for me?

416
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,400
How did he know?

417
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,038
That's right. I said I would cook for him.

418
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:07,039
I didn't buy any groceries.

419
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,599
Should I make something simple for him?

420
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,559
There's nothing.at all.

421
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,559
Be careful, it's hot.

422
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,000
How is it?

423
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,160
How do you know how to make this?

424
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,519
My dad taught me.

425
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,680
Just boil seafood in plain porridge.

426
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:37,799
Is it good?

427
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:56,319
One more bowl.

428
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,640
Mr. Ye, what are you doing?

429
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:35,559
Your hair is messy.

430
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,960
I'll tie it for you.

431
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,960
Do you have a hair tie?

432
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,240
It's in my apron.

433
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:11,039
It looks like you really don't have a birthmark.

434
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,079
A birthmark?

435
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,038
I told you before.

436
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,039
I don't have one.

437
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:21,759
Why aren't you her?
