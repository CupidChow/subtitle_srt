1
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
(Actress Han Hui and CEO of Anning Culture, Ye Fei Mo...)

2
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,238
(were caught kissing, and they stayed a night...)

3
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:00,040
(at a building under Ye Fei Mo's name.)

4
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,478
- Xiao Nuan. - Xiao Jing.

5
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,599
What brings you here?

6
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,960
Are you feeling better?

7
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:22,370
Much better.

8
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,240
What's the matter, Xiao Jing?

9
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:27,199
Are you all right?

10
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,370
You mean...

11
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,599
the matter about Mr. Ye and Han Hui, right?

12
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:39,439
The scandal broke out in the middle of the night.

13
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,758
By the time our company realized it,

14
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:42,960
it was all over the Internet.

15
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,199
I'm really worried about you.

16
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:47,239
You just fainted two days ago.

17
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,520
I want you to rest at home today.

18
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:50,960
You don't have to go to the office for training.

19
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:52,960
There's no need.

20
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,599
I'm fine.

21
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:57,560
I'll get changed and we'll go to the office.

22
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:15,800
Han Hui and Ye Fei Mo are a couple.

23
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,359
They look so good together.

24
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,360
They're taken now.

25
00:03:18,361 --> 00:03:20,599
My husband has a girlfriend.

26
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:21,919
Sob, sob.

27
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,359
But since it's Han Hui,

28
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,560
I'll reluctantly agree.

29
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:28,079
Who else besides Han Hui is worthy of Ye Fei Mo?

30
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,280
I hope they have a happy marriage and a baby soon.

31
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,680
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,800
Thank you for last night.

33
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:02,680
If there's anything next time,

34
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:04,879
just call your manager.

35
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:10,159
You still came to pick me up...

36
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:11,479
and take care of me.

37
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:12,840
I know...

38
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,960
I'm still in your heart.

39
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,519
I think you're mistaken.

40
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,879
I picked you up out of courtesy.

41
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,199
Nothing else.

42
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,959
I have nothing to do with you anymore.

43
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,680
Please understand that.

44
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,120
- Fei Mo. - Leave if there's nothing else.

45
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,170
Can you...

46
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,279
lend this shirt to me?

47
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,120
My clothes are dirty.

48
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:38,519
I can't go out with it.

49
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,240
Thank you, Mr. Ye.

50
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,240
Ms. Wen.

51
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:06,759
I almost didn't recognize you.

52
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,920
So you live downstairs from Fei Mo.

53
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,000
I thought you two lived together.

54
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,800
You must be joking.

55
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,480
How could I possibly be living with Mr. Ye?

56
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,399
I misunderstood then.

57
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,399
Let's go, Xiao Jing.

58
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:45,000
Did you really not mind it?

59
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:47,560
Why didn't you ask me anything?

60
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:10,000
Fei Mo, can you give me a ride?

61
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,079
It's not on my way.

62
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:12,879
I'm meeting a friend...

63
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,240
near Anning.

64
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:15,800
I'm not going to the office.

65
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:20,160
You're not with Wen Xiao Nuan.

66
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:21,519
Why did you lie to me?

67
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,639
It's none of your business.

68
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:25,958
Do you still have feelings for me?

69
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,199
Are you trying to make me jealous?

70
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Answer me.

71
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:56,198
After you went to Cheng An Ya's dinner last night,

72
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:57,360
you never came back.

73
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,839
I was so worried about you.

74
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:01,680
I didn't expect you to progress so fast.

75
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:17,199
Xiao Nuan.

76
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:20,439
Xiao Nuan.

77
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,240
Yes?

78
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:24,279
What's on your mind?

79
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:26,360
Nothing.

80
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:28,680
You're just starting out.

81
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,839
The prime time of an actress...

82
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,039
are the first few years.

83
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,919
You must hold on to them.

84
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:37,330
I know.

85
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:40,039
You're very smart and perceptive.

86
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,039
At your current stage,

87
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:44,960
nothing is more important than work.

88
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:48,679
Including love.

89
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:53,330
Xiao Jing, I think you're talking to the wrong person.

90
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:56,399
You should be saying that to Han Hui instead.

91
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:58,090
You know what I'm saying.

92
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:09,799
(Han Hui and Ye Fei Mo are a good match!)

93
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:12,840
The hot searches now are all about you and Mr. Ye.

94
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,329
I saw the comments.

95
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:17,279
They all say you're a match made in heaven.

96
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,879
Most of your fans are happy for you.

97
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,600
But I'm afraid Mr. Ye will come out and clarify it.

98
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:23,919
He won't.

99
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:26,639
I'm a highly popular and positive star.

100
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,559
This scandal won't affect Anning's reputation.

101
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,360
Instead, it'll keep them on the radar.

102
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,600
He won't say anything.

103
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:36,090
You want more than that, don't you?

104
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,960
I don't have many chances to get close to him.

105
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:43,959
This way,

106
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,600
he can see me all the time.

107
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,399
It's good.

108
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:12,158
I thought you and Ms. Cheng...

109
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,600
would come back with a victory.

110
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,720
What's going on now?

111
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,879
News about you and Han Hui are all over the Internet.

112
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,639
There are so many reporters downstairs.

113
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,360
What are you going to do? Will you give them a response?

114
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,159
There's no need.

115
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,639
You want to use this as a publicity stunt?

116
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,279
Yes, you're doing fine.

117
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,330
But pity the little nurse.

118
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:38,279
Seems like what I said before was in vain.

119
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,210
Do I even need publicity?

120
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:45,279
You want to use this opportunity to see the little nurse's reaction.

121
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,240
You're so sly.

122
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,450
You're overthinking it.

123
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:54,799
I guessed it right, didn't I?

124
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:57,559
Don't worry.

125
00:10:58,039 --> 00:10:59,278
Today, I'll keep you updated...

126
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,000
on the little nurse's reaction.

127
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:02,919
Are you done?

128
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,600
If you're done, please leave.

129
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,720
I'm not going anywhere.

130
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,879
Actually, you can refuse my help.

131
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,720
Get out.

132
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,679
All right, Fei Mo.

133
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:14,080
Let's get down to business.

134
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,279
Yesterday, were you...

135
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,239
set up?

136
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,960
Or did you really...

137
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,080
What do you think?

138
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,240
Me?

139
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:32,480
I think there are only two people in this world...

140
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,879
who can set you up.

141
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,279
One is Ms. Cheng...

142
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:37,038
because she watched you grow up.

143
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:38,439
The other one is Wen Xiao Nuan...

144
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,559
because you'd fall into her trap willingly.

145
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,158
But you fell for Han Hui's trap.

146
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:44,399
I really don't get it.

147
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,840
Did Han Hui get better...

148
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,440
or do you still have feelings for her?

149
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:52,720
I don't.

150
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,120
She didn't get better either.

151
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,439
It's just that I didn't see through her.

152
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,440
Right?

153
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,000
When Han Hui went abroad,

154
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:00,039
you blamed Ms. Cheng.

155
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,799
Now you understand her good intentions, don't you?

156
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,320
All right, let's not dig up the past.

157
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:09,919
What do you plan to do next?

158
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:11,679
Clarify the matter?

159
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,399
And help her get publicity?

160
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:15,320
Isn't that what she wants?

161
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,399
So...

162
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,120
do you intend to keep this up?

163
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,080
You're fine with it,

164
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:25,200
but it'll be tough on the little nurse.

165
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,159
Fei Mo.

166
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,079
Actually, the company...

167
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,240
needs to make a stand too.

168
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:36,120
This kind of scandal doesn't harm you...

169
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,399
or the company at all.

170
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:39,119
In fact, many people in the company are willing...

171
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,600
for Han Hui to take over "Blue Galaxy".

172
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:42,959
Should the PR department do PR?

173
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,319
Should the production team proceed?

174
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,159
Who will be the female lead?

175
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,918
You need to make a statement...

176
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:49,639
to make things easier or everyone.

177
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,600
Besides,

178
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:55,440
if you don't make a statement, everyone in the company will gossip.

179
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:57,720
The little nurse will take on so much pressure.

180
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:58,799
Have you thought about it?

181
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:04,519
You're very smart today.

182
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,399
It's not that I'm smart.

183
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,879
It's that your attention is all on the little nurse.

184
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,518
Everything seems normal on the outside,

185
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:14,519
but inside, your heart has already turned upside down.

186
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,120
If you ask me, don't think about anything and just go to her.

187
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,080
Cut the crap.

188
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,360
Go to the meeting.

189
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:25,960
Mr. Ye, Mr. Jiang from Aurora Film wants to see you.

190
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,679
As expected.

191
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,559
You go to the meeting.

192
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,960
I'll go and meet him.

193
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,240
Okay.

194
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,200
Mr. Ye.

195
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,200
You have to give Aurora Film an explanation.

196
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:52,159
What for?

197
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,960
Mr. Ye, you're so forgetful.

198
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,639
How could you forget our agreement so quickly?

199
00:13:58,039 --> 00:13:59,799
The clause we signed back then.

200
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,319
Aurora Film and Anning Culture...

201
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,159
will work together to build "Blue Galaxy".

202
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,799
Aurora Film's theaters...

203
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:06,639
will provide 100% of the screenings.

204
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,279
I remember.

205
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,639
You begged me for that.

206
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,279
What we agreed on back then...

207
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:19,479
was that during the operation of the project,

208
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,039
there shouldn't be any scandals...

209
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,320
or negative news.

210
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:23,919
But now?

211
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,399
The cameramen, writers, and directors...

212
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,120
are all top-tier.

213
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:30,279
But the male lead flopped.

214
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,079
The male lead walked out.

215
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,199
The female lead is a rookie.

216
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,038
The filming is infinitely delayed.

217
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:36,120
Mr. Ye.

218
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,960
Don't you owe me an explanation?

219
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,120
Mr. Jiang, what do you want?

220
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:45,320
According to our previous agreement,

221
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:47,759
we can either replace the male lead with someone of the same calibre...

222
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:49,320
or make Han Hui the female lead.

223
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,320
We're taking more time to prepare for the movie,

224
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,158
so that we can progress more smoothly during the filming.

225
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:57,119
You're not even sure about the male lead.

226
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,519
How can you guarantee me that?

227
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,559
Anning always keeps its promise to the end.

228
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:03,359
If we say we can start filming as scheduled,

229
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,720
we'll shoot as scheduled.

230
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:06,600
Mr. Ye, that's easy for you to say.

231
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,678
First, you changed the female lead.

232
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:10,120
Now, the male lead dropped out.

233
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,000
Do you know how much damage this will do to "Blue Galaxy"?

234
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:15,919
You owe Aurora Film an explanation.

235
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:20,600
I've always been curious.

236
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,359
Why did the scandal break out...

237
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,600
at this time?

238
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,240
After Han Hui returned,

239
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,519
she has had a lot of contact with you, Mr. Jiang.

240
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,360
It proves to be quite effective.

241
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,960
What do you mean?

242
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:38,759
Nothing.

243
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:02,440
Nuan Nuan.

244
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,840
I think your elbow pads are on backwards.

245
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,039
- Let me help you. - No need.

246
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,960
(Han Hui was drunk last night.)

247
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,440
(Come to my office.)

248
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:46,399
Come to my office.

249
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,679
You should know by now.

250
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,639
Since the beginning, Ye Fei Mo never had feelings for you.

251
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,758
He doesn't care about your feelings.

252
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:58,240
He can abandon you at any time.

253
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:04,680
Mr. Jiang, I'll tell you one last time.

254
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,319
There's nothing between me and Ye Fei Mo.

255
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:10,000
So no one will abandon anyone.

256
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,410
Please don't say that again.

257
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,410
I know you don't understand me yet...

258
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,920
and you still can't forgive me.

259
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,519
But as long as you realize that you and Ye Fei Mo can't be together,

260
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,200
my plan will be successful.

261
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,079
(Come to my office.)

262
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:43,598
There are still many factors to consider.

263
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:44,719
- Yes. - Right.

264
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,518
Let's follow up on this.

265
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:48,240
- Okay, got it. - Thanks.

266
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,199
- Mr. Ye. - Mr. Ye.

267
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,200
Hello, Mr. Ye.

268
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,720
Have a seat.

269
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:02,410
Today,

270
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,119
my personal news has made a big fuss.

271
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,359
I'm sure you've all heard about it.

272
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:09,680
Let me make this clear.

273
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:11,839
There's nothing between me...

274
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:13,519
and Han Hui.

275
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:16,480
I don't want any rumors...

276
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,480
to spread in our company.

277
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,519
Understand?

278
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:24,440
This scandal is spreading so fast...

279
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,519
that it's out of our control.

280
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,439
When the photo was released,

281
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,519
it was three in the morning.

282
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:32,240
Our PR department didn't catch it in time...

283
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,410
to control it.

284
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,519
It spread like wildfire...

285
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:38,839
and became the talk of the town.

286
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:40,720
Here,

287
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,359
I'd like to reflect on myself.

288
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,890
I'll take responsibility.

289
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:46,279
This was an accident.

290
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,039
It's no one's fault.

291
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,410
The production team needs to follow up.

292
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,440
Wen Xiao Nuan has to come in as soon as possible.

293
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:55,440
We have to start filming on time.

294
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,720
Mr. Ye.

295
00:18:57,119 --> 00:18:58,240
Do we need...

296
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:00,480
to hold a press conference...

297
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:01,799
to clarify this matter?

298
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,039
No.

299
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,839
Why should we give Aurora Film and Han Hui...

300
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:07,650
a chance to continue the hype?

301
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,890
That's all for today. Meeting adjourned.

302
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,410
Xiao Jing, you can go too.

303
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:26,650
Okay.

304
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:33,839
Tell me.

305
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,240
Is the photo real or fake?

306
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:38,079
Are you the one who's willing to stoop so low...

307
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,079
to destroy the Ye family and Anning Culture?

308
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:42,200
Or are you too arrogant...

309
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:44,000
and think that Wen Xiao Nuan isn't good enough for you?

310
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:45,920
The photo is real.

311
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,279
Everything else is fake.

312
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:51,519
I didn't think you'd dare to do anything.

313
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:56,799
I just told her yesterday...

314
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,679
not to touch the daughter-in-law of Anning.

315
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,960
But today, she slapped me in the face.

316
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,440
What's your stand on this?

317
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:05,919
Will you settle it yourself...

318
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,410
or should I take care of it for you?

319
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,079
This matter involves "Blue Galaxy".

320
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,319
It's not the right time to clarify the scandal.

321
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:15,890
Is Aurora Film involved too?

322
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:19,720
Don't worry, Mom.

323
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,039
I'm confident...

324
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,200
that it won't last long.

325
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,200
Fei Mo.

326
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:30,440
I'm a woman.

327
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:31,920
I've been through it too.

328
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:33,559
I've experienced everything.

329
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:35,890
I know what you're thinking.

330
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,960
You can look at the big picture, but...

331
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:41,599
you have to control the situation.

332
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,359
Don't you ever hurt Nuan Nuan.

333
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,359
I don't think...

334
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,200
that she's even affected.

335
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,079
Maybe she won't be hurt at all.

336
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:00,359
You're too slow, Fei Mo.

337
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:02,679
Given the Ye family's background,

338
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,960
Nuan Nuan isn't taking the initiative to do anything.

339
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,890
That's what's great about her.

340
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:08,890
If you don't take the initiative,

341
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:11,170
you'll miss out on this good girl.

342
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:15,078
Actually, I hardly care about Anning anymore.

343
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:16,890
As for the game between you and Aurora Film,

344
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,410
I'm not interested at all.

345
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:21,410
But Nuan Nuan is my ideal daughter-in-law.

346
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:23,279
If you let her go,

347
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:26,119
you'll never set foot in the Ye family again.

348
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:28,839
Think about it.

349
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,359
(Come to my office.)

350
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:03,079
Jiang Fang.

351
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,240
This time,

352
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:08,759
there's such a big fuss.

353
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,359
It's a breach of contract.

354
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,639
I've already given him an ultimatum.

355
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,278
If he can't find a top actor...

356
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:16,559
to be the male lead within the allotted time,

357
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,479
as Aurora Film,

358
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,039
I'll order him to cast Han Hui as the female lead.

359
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,400
What did Ye Fei Mo say?

360
00:22:22,401 --> 00:22:23,959
He said he can guarantee the filming will start as scheduled.

361
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,279
- Start as scheduled? - That's right.

362
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,480
Is he dreaming?

363
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,278
Usually, actors have to be booked six months in advance.

364
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:30,598
What's more, most top actors...

365
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,200
would be booked until the next year.

366
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,879
There's only a week left.

367
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,160
Where can he find an actor?

368
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:37,319
That's why...

369
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,440
victory is in our hands this time.

370
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,720
As long as we get Han Hui...

371
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:44,920
to be the female lead of "Blue Galaxy",

372
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:46,920
she'll have to sign with Aurora Film.

373
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:49,039
That way,

374
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,039
no one will dare to mock me anymore.

375
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,319
Jiang Fang.

376
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,839
You're so busy with work every day.

377
00:22:58,079 --> 00:22:59,798
You don't even have time to think about us.

378
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:01,480
Aren't we together every day?

379
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:02,599
That's not enough.

380
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:05,199
I want to be with you every minute and second of every day.

381
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,799
I want you to be completely mine.

382
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,160
Silly girl.

383
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:12,240
Jiang Fang, let's get married.

384
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:14,559
No, I mean...

385
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,839
I mean, it's so sudden.

386
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:18,160
How is it sudden?

387
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:19,839
We've been engaged for some time.

388
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:21,839
No, I...

389
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:23,680
Look, I have so much work now.

390
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:24,960
I'm quite busy.

391
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,160
Work is never-ending.

392
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:29,720
I haven't been filming lately. I have plenty of time.

393
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,278
I'll plan the wedding.

394
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:32,279
You don't have to worry about it.

395
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,319
Okay, I'll listen to you.

396
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:49,279
Don't drink so much coffee.

397
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,880
Why are you here?

398
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,319
I'm discussing with Mr. Ye about the script.

399
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,079
You stayed up all night again?

400
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,440
I have no choice.

401
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:01,200
There have been too many changes in the project lately.

402
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,200
I have to keep revising the proposal.

403
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,000
Otherwise, I can't answer to the investors.

404
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,000
"Blue Galaxy" is having so many ups and downs.

405
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,200
There's about the thing that happened yesterday.

406
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,720
Regarding this,

407
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,319
I have more confidence in Fei Mo and Wen Xiao Nuan...

408
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,559
than I am in you.

409
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,160
You're overthinking it.

410
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,518
Trust me.

411
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,480
"Blue Galaxy" will be able to launch smoothly.

412
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,240
And there will be a huge reaction.

413
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:27,640
You're so confident.

414
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:30,799
Ability is the ultimate support.

415
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:35,079
I'm different now.

416
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:40,319
Thanks.

417
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,960
(Nanfang Entertainment)

418
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,559
Mr. Ye's shirt is ironed.

419
00:25:57,759 --> 00:25:58,799
Han Hui.

420
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,400
It's such a big issue,

421
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,839
but there's no reaction from Anning.

422
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,200
Has Mr. Ye come to his senses?

423
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,079
It's not that simple.

424
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:09,839
It won't be easy...

425
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,319
dealing with Cheng An Ya.

426
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,439
By the way,

427
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,319
Cheng An Ya told me yesterday...

428
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,199
that Fei Mo and I got together...

429
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,440
because I saved him.

430
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,400
But I don't remember that at all.

431
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:25,960
Maybe you saved Mr. Ye before,

432
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:27,400
but you didn't notice.

433
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:28,839
No

434
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,160
I would remember if it happened.

435
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,039
There must be some misunderstanding

436
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,119
Or...

437
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:40,599
Fei Mo lied to Cheng An Ya...

438
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,000
to be with me.

439
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:45,160
Or...

440
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,759
Or what?

441
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,119
Let's go return Fei Mo's shirt.

442
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,039
We can't give Wen Xiao Nuan a chance to breathe.

443
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,680
Take the shirt.

444
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,879
Her body fat percentage seems to have dropped.

445
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,920
Yes.

446
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:27,359
- Hello, Mr. Ye. - Hello, Mr. Ye.

447
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:37,000
Why do you keep avoiding me?

448
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:39,960
I'm not avoiding you. I've been training.

449
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:41,240
Don't you have anything to ask me?

450
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,440
What's there to ask?

451
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,639
I can ask Xiao Jing about work...

452
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,880
or even Director Li.

453
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:48,599
What about outside of work?

454
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,759
We only talk about work in Anning.

455
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:53,078
Mr. Ye.

456
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:54,999
If there's nothing else, please excuse me.

457
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,160
I'm going to practice.

458
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,599
Although you're not going to ask,

459
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,480
you still need to know.

460
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:02,640
- Last night, I... - Mr. Ye.

461
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,279
What is it?

462
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,279
Han Hui is stopped by the security guard downstairs.

463
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:18,359
Bring her up.

464
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:22,599
Yes, sir.

465
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,640
I'll give you a satisfactory explanation.
