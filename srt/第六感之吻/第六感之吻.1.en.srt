NOEL ORPHANAGE

WE GIVE YOU A HEARTY WELCOME
I'LL GO TO HOLLYWOOD! I'LL WIN IT

4
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,728
I didn't know someone was here.

5
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,317
I'm sorry.

6
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:49,318
Have a good day.

7
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:57,083
The e-mail.

00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:58,698
PLANNING TEAM 1,
PRODUCTION TEAM 1

9
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,115
YOUR MESSAGE HAS BEEN SENT SUCCESSFULLY

10
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,142
Why are my joints cracking so much?

11
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:21,892
EPISODE 1

00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:41,489
BASED ON THE WEBNOVEL
KISS SIXTH SENSE BY GOT W

00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:15,737
<i>♪ I like the way you look at me ♪</i>

14
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,695

<i>♪ If you ask me out tonight I'm free ♪</i>

16
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,465
Are you coming to work
or getting off?

17
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:43,143
LEE DOJOON

18
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,683
I'll have the usual, please.

19
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:47,604
Ms. Hong.

20
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,848
Boy, that's not right.

21
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,820
I don't think you should go
for that combination today.

22
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:58,453
No.

23
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,280
It's necessary today.

24
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,592
It's fine.

25
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:17,804
Five shots of espresso, please.
In one cup.

26
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,937
Oh, shit.

27
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,225
The lobby on a rainy day.
Isn't it so nice?

28
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,358
Have you finally lost your mind
due to lack of sleep?

29
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:43,655
It's sunny. What do you mean, a rainy day?

30
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:45,951
It's going to rain.

31
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,035
What?

32
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:51,043
I saw it. The rain.

33
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,416
For goodness' sake. How silly.

34
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:58,672
Five.

35
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,007
Four.

36
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:01,428
Three.

37
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,051
Two.

38
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,257
One.

39
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,284
What?

40
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,740
How did you know?

41
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,068
My sixth sense.

42
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,203
What?

43
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,159
Ms. Yoon!

44
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:30,083
Oh, my goodness!
You must be so embarrassed.

45
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,253
Get up. Hurry.
What's wrong? Are you embarrassed?

46
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,082
Just get up. Your hair is so messy,
for goodness' sake.

47
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,287
What should I do with you?

48
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:37,304
Goodness.

49
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:55,521
Why is the summer rain...

50
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,981
always so loud?

51
00:06:58,918 --> 00:06:59,998
<i>I know.</i>

52
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,673
<i>When this door opens,</i>

53
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:03,256
<i>we'll make love.</i>

54
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:15,137
<i>I'll open this door, go in,</i>

55
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,557
<i>and kiss him.</i>

56
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,855
<i>And I know that we'll lie down on the bed</i>

57
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,871
<i>and make love.</i>

58
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,448
<i>My sixth sense.</i>

59
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,124
<i>I've foreseen it several times.</i>

60
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,910
<i>That he and I will end up like this.</i>

61
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:39,827
<i>That I will make love with him after all.</i>

62
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,590
<i>And after that,</i>

63
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,471
<i>I will regret it.</i>

64
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,717
<i>Even though I know it,</i>

65
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,512
<i>I'll end up doing it.</i>

66
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:57,099
You didn't stay up
all night, did you?

67
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:01,979
You wouldn't say you worked hard on it
or things like that, would you?

68
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:06,034
If this was the result of hard work,

69
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,320
that would make me angrier

70
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:10,704
than hearing you say you loafed
the whole time and hurriedly made it

71
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,781
in five minutes this morning.

72
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:16,075
Do you really want to sleep on that?

73
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,663
Nothing in this satisfies
the client's needs.

74
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,713
All I see is this cheesy copy. Why?

75
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,632
You reinterpreted
the client's needs as you pleased.

76
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,085
It's funny.

77
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:30,885
And next.

78
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:31,928
TV COMMERCIAL

79
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,596
Our AD.

80
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,680
You satisfied your selfish needs and greed

81
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,426
by overspending our budget

82
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,098
on this cheap script.

83
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,855
Wow.

84
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,019
It's funny. Right?

85
00:08:58,287 --> 00:08:59,367
<i>The next target</i>

86
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,041
<i>is me.</i>

87
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,290
Ms. Hong Yesool.

88
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,416
What's your job title?

89
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,341
It's AE.

90
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,261
What does an AE do?

91
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,589
AE is the leader of an advertising team

92
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,508
that makes commercials
on behalf of advertisers.

93
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:18,676
They encourage members of the production,
media, and many other teams

94
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,936
to work with limited time and budgets

95
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,809
and plan advertising strategies.

96
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,225
They're coordinators
who help advertising firms meet

97
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:27,864
- the needs of advertisers...
- You don't respect me, do you?

98
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,438
Sorry?

99
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:30,815
You don't.

100
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:34,782
That's why you did nothing
until it ended up like this

101
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,115
and presented it as an outcome.

102
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,331
Proudly.

103
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,616
Even though you're the person
in charge. Huh?

104
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:43,618
Well, but we...

105
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:47,338
We're encouraging each other
to create something new...

106
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,840
You copied the two sentences
from last season's proposal.

107
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,302
The tone, colors, and font.

108
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,882
You copied page 32 of the reference.

109
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,428
And the background music is similar

110
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:58,431
to the one in KS Electronics'
recent campaign for about two seconds.

111
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,516
If you're going to work
like some college students,

112
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,862
pay tuition
instead of getting paid every month.

113
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,188
All right?

114
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,067
Do it again.

115
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,068
I'll give you one more day.

116
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:13,738
- The end.
- The end.

117
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:24,826
Ms. Hong Yesool.

118
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,668
Yes, Mr. Cha?

119
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,086
Your sixth sense.

120
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,337
Didn't it tell you?

121
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:36,299
You're an AE. How did you not know
that it would turn out like this?

122
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,642
If you don't have an eye for it,
just quit.

123
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,602
The deadline is too tight.

124
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,194
And our CD hasn't been feeling well, so...

125
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:45,138
Ms. AE.

126
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:46,853
Use your tongue to work.

127
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,401
Not to blame others.

128
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:49,979
You.

129
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,403
Is it too early to be a PM?

130
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:55,612
I'm sorry, sir.

131
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,695
I wasn't able to meet your expectations.

132
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:00,158
I had no expectations of you.
Don't overestimate yourself.

133
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:01,579
Get out.

134
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,683
How did you know Master Cha
would bash the proposal?

135
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,390
I've worked with him for five years.
It's a piece of cake to read his mind.

136
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:21,511
Yesool.

137
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,347
Is that why you prepared Plan B?

138
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,890
Huh? Did you go to Plan A
even though you knew he'd bash it?

139
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,980
He would've bashed it
no matter what we showed him.

140
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,816
It's better to show him
the worst one first.

141
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,569
Then we'll get scolded less
when we show him a better one next time.

142
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,650
Ah, that was your plan.

143
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,775
Cha, that crazy asshole.

144
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,584
I really want to kill him,

145
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,540
but I'll have mercy on him today.

146
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:54,052
That's one way to do it.
It's always like this.

147
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,340
I'm short on ideas.

148
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,264
Jeez.

149
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,006
Everyone.

150
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:03,468
We need to revise the proposal
in 24 hours.

151
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,100
Now click your mouse
on the folder named Billy.

152
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,984
Really Seriously Crazy Last One 18.

153
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:15,816
The Final Plan A. Next to that.

154
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,242
The file we carefully created.

155
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,280
We Won't End Up Clicking This, Will We?

156
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,195
Nineteen. Plan B.

157
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,374
Open it.

158
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:27,791
Click.

159
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:29,833
Click!

160
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:32,497
Eighteen. The final version.

161
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,040
Brown-eyed Bulbul...

162
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:38,053
Really. Seriously. Crazy.

163
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,092
- Gosh, eighteen.
- Last One Eight...

164
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,716
Eighteen. Eighteen. Eighteen. Eighteen.

165
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,183
Oh, gosh!

166
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,563
The Nephew Pad!

167
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,889
Nephew... Nephew Pa...

168
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,524
160

169
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,874
Something soft. That's what this is.

170
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,497
Are you listening to me? Huh?

171
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,590
Yesool.

172
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,549
I'm doing a vlog about my intern life.

173
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,308
Please tell me the secret to becoming
the youngest PM in this company.

174
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,516
Mr. Intern.
Get an idea of what's going on now.

175
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:32,902
Forget this vlog

176
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,268
or whatever. Turn off your phone

177
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,815
and at least pretend to search
for references.

178
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,189
Well, to search for references,

179
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:42,356
I need to know what the role of an AE is
or advertising vocabulary...

180
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:43,776
What do you not understand?

181
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:46,744
What are Deities and what's Master Cha?

182
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:50,913
We call advertisers "Deities"
because they are deities to us.

183
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,996
And Master Cha
is Mr. Cha Minhu's nickname.

184
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:54,915
And the role of an AE is...

185
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,050
Oh, I learned that from you earlier.
When you were being scolded by Master Cha.

186
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:00,168
Thank you.

187
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,732
- Hello.
- Hello.

188
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,317
<i>I learned about the duties of an AE</i>

189
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,116
<i>mostly from that punk.</i>

190
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,794
<i>The punk who is called Master Cha.</i>

191
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,922
A life of luxury.
Transforming your dream into reality.

192
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,210
This is the house you want to live in.

193
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,749
We'll pioneer a new genre.

194
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,458
Thank you for your attention.

195
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,838
I'm AD and Assistant Manager
Lee Dahee. Thank you.

196
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:46,968
<i>Actually, he is...</i>

197
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,813
<i>a deity in the advertising industry.</i>

198
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:53,484
Use your sixth sense.

199
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,139
By the clients' words,
the looks on their faces,

200
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,727
and their tones,
you can tell whether or not

201
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:58,943
you'll win the contract.

202
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,356
Only those who can do
that survive in this industry.

203
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,282
I DID USE MY SIXTH SENSE
AND READ THE SIGNS

204
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:08,324
THE NATURAL FOREST COMES INTO YOUR ROOM

205
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,777
I DID USE MY SIXTH SENSE
AND READ THE SIGNS

206
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,656
<i>Cha, that asshole.</i>

207
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,914
<i>If he starts with a smile
when he's obviously pissed off,</i>

208
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,996
<i>that's a sign that our proposal
will be turned down.</i>

209
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,291
<i>If he touches his neck,
that means his next target is me.</i>

210
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,673
Read the signs
and make the impossible possible.

211
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:22,764
That's the job of an AE.

212
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:27,553
<i>I did read the signs,
but I guess I'm not experienced enough.</i>

213
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,053
<i>I know what's going to happen,</i>

214
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,216
<i>but I get frustrated
when it actually happens.</i>

215
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,724
CHA, THAT ASSHOLE.

216
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:34,055
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

217
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,941
<i>Hey, I think you're mistaken.</i>

218
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,138
<i>It's not just today
that you were frustrated.</i>

219
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:38,147
<i>You've been frustrated
for the last five years.</i>

220
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:41,904
<i>That's true.</i>

221
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:43,975
<i>I felt it on the first day.</i>

222
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,358
FIVE YEARS AGO

223
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,880
I'm your mentor.

224
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:09,715
Oh.

225
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:23,649
You can't go anywhere dressed like that.

226
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:25,568
Sorry?

227
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,651
Change the way you dress.
Your makeup and hairstyle too.

228
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,820
The look in your eyes, the way you speak,

229
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:29,954
and your facial expressions.
Fix all of them.

230
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,490
When we meet our clients
for the first time,

231
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:34,623
we should be able to show them
our expertise and confidence visually.

232
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,252
You can't wear a suit
that looks too stiff.

233
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,158
Nor something casual
that makes you look less reliable.

234
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,417
Definitely not...

235
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,461
what you're wearing now.

236
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,930
Then h-how...

237
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,301
Do I have to spoon-feed you?

238
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,222
Should I start by telling you
what AE stands for?

239
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,386
AE...

240
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:00,773
Follow me.

241
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:05,149
Hurry!

242
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:07,034
Okay.

243
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:12,565
He seems to have a lot of anger.
Be careful.

244
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,953
He's so scary.

245
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,235
He's so scary.

246
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:18,867
Oh, dear.

247
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,334
Oh, no.

248
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,045
Go get dressed.

249
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,799
I am dressed.

250
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,224
Get dressed properly.

251
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,060
SBC
MR. CHA MINHU

252
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,439
Well...

253
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,649
<i>I knew from the get-go</i>

254
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,648
<i>that I should never mess with him.</i>

255
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,492
THREE YEARS AGO

256
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,820
You worked all night on this proposal?

257
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,155
That doesn't mean you can be forgiven
for submitting a piece of shit like this.

258
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,946
Why are you crying? Are you getting fired?

259
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,372
Did you get dumped by your boyfriend?

260
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,293
Are you so sick
that you can't help crying?

261
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,048
If it's not one of these three cases,
don't cry.

262
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,378
At least not at your workplace.

263
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,723
<i>A jerk who enjoys humiliating me.</i>

264
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,837
<i>A jerk who can't sleep</i>

265
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,549
<i>unless he points out my mistakes.</i>

266
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,676
Come on.

267
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,722
Are you going to cry every time
you get criticized?

268
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,216
You can't cry for 24 hours.

269
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,517
Learn to fight back tears.

270
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:22,810
Here.

271
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,897
What's this?

272
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,167
Open the door.

273
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:59,183
Did the production chief go nuts
when you said you'd change the proposal?

274
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,265
You begged him like crazy and got an okay,

275
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,976
but did the media chief complain
about the schedule?

276
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,516
Yesool.

277
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:11,975
I don't think I can be an AE.

278
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,494
Come on out.

279
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,701
Why are you crying?

280
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,413
Are you getting fired?
Did you get dumped by your boyfriend?

281
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:25,655
Are you so sick
that you can't help crying?

282
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,669
If it's not one of these three cases,
don't cry.

283
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,500
At least not at your workplace.

284
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:38,467
Here. Go to a hair salon
and take a two-hour nap.

285
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,222
Go to a hair salon
and take a two-hour nap.

286
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,564
The way you look now,

287
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,349
you won't be able to convince anyone.

288
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:46,312
The way you look now,
you won't be able to convince anyone.

289
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,154
Here.

290
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,028
<i>I learned</i>

291
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:01,869
<i>all of this damn stuff from my mentor.</i>

292
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,660
<i>I cursed that asshole
when I first heard it.</i>

293
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:08,002
<i>But now I'm doing
the same thing to my junior.</i>

294
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,714
It's not true, right? Right?

295
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:11,792
Naturally.

296
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,457
- Ms. Hong. I told him to do this.
- Bye.

297
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,193
I wasn't slacking off. Don't watch me.

298
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,187
Get lost.

299
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:37,691
You finish three hours earlier
if I stand next to you, Ms. AD.

300
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,198
You're like a ghost.

301
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:40,608
You psychic bitch.

302
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,701
A bitch who is just like Cha Minhu.

303
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,618
TO MAKE YOUR PRIVATE SPACE SOFT
BILLY, THE SPACE THAT COVERS YOUR SECRETS

304
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,287
Eomji.

305
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:51,077
Isn't it better
that I come instead of Cha Minhu?

306
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,418
Anyway,

307
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,128
another all-nighter,
and we'll all be free.

308
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,923
Alrighty.

309
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,466
For goodness' sake.

310
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,803
Jeez.

311
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,312
By the way, how did you know
that it was going to rain this morning?

312
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,230
-Oh, that?
-Yes.

313
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,023
Well, it's a secret, but I'll tell you.

314
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,853
Baloney. She says everything
she tells me is a secret.

315
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:13,898
I...

316
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:16,817
can see the future.

317
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:27,490
Working all night is really bad for you.

318
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:30,502
Everyone is going crazy.

319
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,472
Just a second!

320
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,452
AUTOMATIC OPERATION

321
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:21,547
<i>It's true
that I can see the future.</i>

322
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:24,721
<i>No one may believe me,</i>

323
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:27,303
<i>but I have a sixth sense.</i>

324
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:31,429
<i>When my lips touch someone else's body,</i>

325
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,270
<i>I can see that person's future.</i>

326
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:37,855
<i>I found out about this ability
22 years ago.</i>

327
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:41,648
<i>But I have no idea how I got it.</i>

328
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:46,366
I'm his guardian. Wait.

329
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:47,908
Honey.

330
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:00,915
Kiss me on the cheek.

331
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,839
<i>I don't know when it'll happen.</i>

332
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,512
<i>But one thing for sure is</i>

333
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:08,547
<i>that the future I see</i>

334
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,221
<i>always happens without fail.</i>

335
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,642
Ta-da.

336
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:14,935
Thank you.

337
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:16,848
All I want is a kiss on the cheek.

338
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:18,647
Well...

339
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,860
<i>How unfortunate I am</i>

340
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:27,031
<i>to be able to see someone else's future.</i>

341
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:29,117
<i>What a cursed ability.</i>

342
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,699
<i>I'm well aware of that.</i>

343
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:36,497
<i>Whenever I kissed someone I loved,</i>

344
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,830
<i>I wasn't in their future.</i>

345
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,675
Well...

346
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:48,684
I mean...

347
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:50,763
let's...

348
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:53,432
break up.

349
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,806
Okay. Let's do that.

350
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,020
Good.

351
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:02,768
I was sick of you anyway.

352
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,546
What an asshole. I bought that drink.

353
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,144
What a ridiculous jerk.

354
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,307
Gosh.

355
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:42,442
<i>So not using this horrible ability
is my ironclad rule.</i>

356
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,629
Oh, dear.

357
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,268
Let's break up.

358
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,066
All right? We're over.

359
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:28,486
I have no idea what you want.

360
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:29,568
How can you...

361
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,493
How can you still have a cold?
It's been three months.

362
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:33,321
I've never seen a girl like you.

363
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,029
This is the right thing to do.
Let's break up.

364
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:43,754
Kiss! Shit!

365
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:58,721
<i>I promised myself that
I'd never kiss someone in my life again.</i>

366
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,596
And I tried.

367
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:04,561
But no matter how hard I try,
there are times it just happens.

368
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:09,439
That's beyond my control.

369
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:28,707
Man.

370
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,183
Thank you for your hard work.

371
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:38,716
I apologize for delaying it by one day.

372
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:39,925
Before you present it to the deity,

373
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,015
you need to get an okay
from Master Cha, don't you?

374
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:44,392
That's right. If we get an okay from him,

375
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:46,517
it'll be a piece of cake
to get one from the deity.

376
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:48,726
Okay, okay.

377
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:49,975
I'll get going.

378
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:56,866
Hi, Mr. Yeom.

379
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,081
Cha Minhu isn't here.

380
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:01,371
He's not here, right?

381
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,706
I'm a busy person, for God's sake.

382
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:06,964
Hey.

383
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,342
Why isn't he here with you today?

384
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:12,127
You two are usually joined at the hip.

385
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,416
We've finished checking it.

386
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:16,724
Please take a final look at it, Mr. Yeom.

387
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:21,013
I'm sure you did a good job.

388
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,979
Videos for PPMs are pretty much the same.

389
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:27,896
Mr. Yeom.

390
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:29,981
Can we talk outside for a minute?

391
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:36,528
What did she say?

392
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:37,985
She wants to talk to you outside.

393
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:40,993
Jeez. Who does she think she is?
Someone who can order me around?

394
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,326
For God's sake.

395
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:50,791
Mr. Yeom. We had over
a hundred meetings before the PPM.

396
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,667
Do you know how many of them you attended?

397
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:57,928
Exactly.

398
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:02,345
Why do you keep holding
such unnecessary meetings?

399
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,850
Planning Team 1.

400
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:06,429
That's why I hate to work with you guys.

401
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:10,273
Hey. You're worse than Cha Minhu.
You know that?

402
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,355
Jeez.

403
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:14,479
You need to attend
the final confirmation PT tomorrow.

404
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:15,821
Okay?

405
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,447
Don't you know what I'm like?

406
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,696
I'm going to be thoroughly prepared
to impress our client...

407
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:22,992
Please make sure to follow
the manual this time.

408
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:26,043
You checked what I e-mailed you, right?

409
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:28,119
Oh, shit.

410
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:30,961
Well, okay. All right. Here.

411
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:34,672
Wait. Gosh, this is not good.

412
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:37,626
That's disgusting, for God's sake.

413
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:38,716
SOBER UP HANG IN THERE
HANGOVER HELPER HOVENIA DULCIS TEA

414
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:57,671
Come on in.

415
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:38,634
Do you really like it?

416
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,376
Does it look like it's advertising a bed,

417
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:43,224
not a washing machine
or an air-conditioner?

418
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:48,601
I tried to meet the client's needs
as much as possible.

419
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:54,808
All right.

420
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:57,521
Since this is your first project as a PM,

421
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,226
take full responsibility
for the process and the result.

422
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:02,569
By the way,

423
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:05,986
the color of the brand logo is wrong.

424
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,044
No, it's not.

425
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:14,745
Look.

426
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,250
Do you see the difference
in brightness and chroma?

427
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,169
Didn't you check that?

428
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:22,713
And here.

429
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,297
Extend the last shot by 0.2 seconds

430
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:27,385
and add the copy.

431
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:28,847
Make the logo bigger too.

432
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:30,636
Okay?

433
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,391
Ms. Hong.

434
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:36,522
Yes?

435
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,153
Go get changed.

436
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,145
What?

437
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,612
Are my clothes still tacky?

438
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:45,986
Well...

439
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:48,699
these are quite expensive
brand-name clothes though.

440
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,276
No, I mean...

441
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:53,235
Huh?

442
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:16,345
Tissues. Tissues. Tissues. Hurry.

443
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:18,274
Tissues? Here, I've got some toilet paper.

444
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:20,983
I'm bleeding a lot from the nose.

445
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,614
-Well...
-I need to hurry.

446
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,646
You need to hurry? What...

447
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:28,399
Is she getting an urgent call of nature?

448
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:31,739
Anyway, stop...

449
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:43,751
RED BOMB

450
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:03,018
YEAR 2022 BILLY MARKETING PPM

451
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,260
If you put an air-conditioner
in that space,

452
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,012
it'd be an air-conditioner commercial.

453
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:36,184
And with a washing machine,
it'd be a washing machine commercial.

454
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:38,684
Doesn't it lack identity

455
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:40,976
as a bed commercial?

456
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:43,104
It's kind of ordinary.

457
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:45,109
Well, I think...

458
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,897
it's important
to make people curious about our brand.

459
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:51,902
What do you think, Mr. Cha?

460
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:57,986
You're right.

461
00:33:58,703 --> 00:33:59,913
But highlighting nature

462
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:02,416
is something that
Billy has never tried before,

463
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:04,578
so I'm sure it'll bring
about the desired effect.

464
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,880
Okay.

465
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:09,878
I count on you, Mr. Cha.

466
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:19,271
Shit.

467
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:23,063
Mr. Cha.

468
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,768
-I have high expectations for this.
-Thank you.

469
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:32,357
It's Yesool who did the presentation.

470
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,735
Why do they want to sign
the contract with Mr. Cha?

471
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:38,079
He's been in charge of this brand
for years. It's only natural.

472
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,869
He surely is amazing.

473
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:43,083
You know, their attitude completely
changes when Master Cha is present.

474
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:45,794
Master Cha has the upper hand

475
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,835
even when deities are present.

476
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:49,916
Look at my chief.

477
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:52,304
He left as soon as the meeting ended.

478
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:53,971
-That cunning bastard.
-Exactly.

479
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,842
I think we can go home straight
from here today. No overtime work.

480
00:34:57,136 --> 00:35:01,176
Go home and spend some time
with your parents, meet your lovers,

481
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,265
and do piled-up laundry.

482
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:06,732
-Oh, wait. Wait.
-Now what?

483
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:09,523
We should throw a welcome party
for our intern before he'll get sulky.

484
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,357
-Do we have to do that too?
-Sanggoo will buy us meat!

485
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:15,907
Yesool.

486
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:17,738
You'll come to the party, right?

487
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,124
Well...

488
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:22,156
We'll do the shoot this weekend.

489
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:24,082
What?

490
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:25,463
We'll have a meeting.
Let's go back to the office.

491
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,540
Well...

492
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,131
What the hell.

493
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,380
What's going on?

494
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,420
What about the party?

495
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:34,553
Hong Yesool.

496
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:35,927
Follow me.

497
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:40,967
I've got to go.

498
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:42,805
Sure. You go first.

499
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,939
When did I say I'd buy you meat?
I never said that.

500
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,016
What do you know
about my savings account? Jeez.

501
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:58,532
<i>What's going on?</i>

502
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:00,533
<i>Where is he taking me?</i>

503
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,079
<i>I didn't do anything wrong.</i>

504
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:05,619
Mr. Cha. Where are we going?

505
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:08,205
What's the first prerequisite for an AE?

506
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:09,421
Pardon?

507
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,461
Oh.

508
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:13,804
Communication skills, sir.

509
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:17,339
But why do you not have them?

510
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,090
I did pretty well

511
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,717
with my presentation today, didn't I?

512
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:23,433
You were so nervous that you couldn't
even answer our client's questions.

513
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:24,644
And you think you did well?

514
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:28,015
<i>That's because they asked you
all the questions</i>

515
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:29,732
<i>and didn't give me a chance to answer.</i>

516
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:32,481
What's the second prerequisite for an AE?

517
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,360
-Planning and budgeting...
-Physical strength.

518
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:40,947
Build up your physical strength.

519
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:48,785
DAEHAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

520
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:54,798
See a doctor.

521
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,209
And then come back to the office.

522
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,465
<i>What's wrong with him?</i>

523
00:36:58,758 --> 00:36:59,968
<i>Did he eat something funny?</i>

524
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,180
Aren't you getting out?

525
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,260
Oh, okay.

526
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,320
DAEHAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

527
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:25,617
How did he know
this is the hospital I go to?

528
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,880
THANK YOU CONTACT THE PROPS
AND LIGHTING TEAMS TO CHECK...

529
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:41,341
I'm a little busy now.

530
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:43,972
Ms. Hong Yesool.

531
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:47,555
This is my tenth time saying it.
You need to get more sleep.

532
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:50,232
I can't allow you to sleep less than this.

533
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:51,519
Never. Never.

534
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:54,402
I said "never" twice.
You know what that means, right?

535
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:56,821
Listen.

536
00:37:58,067 --> 00:37:58,937
Insomnia.

537
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:00,784
Nervous breakdown.

538
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:04,066
You have both of these.

539
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:05,946
Having both of these

540
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:07,993
is really, really dangerous.

541
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:08,947
Really!

542
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:10,706
I said "really" twice too.

543
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:13,248
I'm fine, doctor. For God's sake.

544
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,670
Well, Red Bomb.

545
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:20,551
Did you drink it or not?

546
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:24,264
Today? Yesterday? In the morning?
Or at night?

547
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:25,803
When?

548
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:28,718
You obviously drank it.
I told you many times not to drink it.

549
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,426
Something serious could happen

550
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:32,476
if you drink it
while you're on medication.

551
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,475
Don't you remember
what happened two years ago?

552
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,402
You were carried here
completely unconscious.

553
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,860
Gosh, this damn advertising company
is harsher than the medical industry.

554
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:45,275
And why do AEs
never listen to their doctors?

555
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:46,324
Why?

556
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,327
Do you have another AE as your patient?

557
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:49,289
Well...

558
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,630
You aren't the only one

559
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,249
who cares about your health.

560
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,956
Please don't make me suffer anymore.

561
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:02,797
If you make
that son of a gun call me again...

562
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:04,132
That son of a gun?

563
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:08,755
Oh, nothing.

564
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,006
Well, it's nothing.

565
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:12,306
Don't drink Red Bomb and espresso.

566
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:13,681
Never, never.

567
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,852
Don't just take pep pills

568
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:17,806
from your drug packets
and get caught by me.

569
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:19,317
I won't. I won't.

570
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:22,232
I won't drink Red Bomb and coffee anymore.

571
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:23,775
I'll stop drinking them.

572
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:27,655
Promise me.

573
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,239
Pop.

574
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,460
Wow.

575
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,511
This is what I want.

576
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:51,135
I can't stop drinking you, though.

577
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:55,847
Hong Yesool.

578
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:58,813
Pull out of the Morphis campaign.

579
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,306
Wait, what?

580
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:03,234
I'm doing my best to be the PM
of that project too.

581
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:05,189
The proposal is almost complete.

582
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:07,197
I've been staying up several nights
to work on that one and the Billy project.

583
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:09,699
You can't even take care of your health.
You're not reliable.

584
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,034
But did I

585
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:13,294
ever mess with the plan?

586
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:14,874
I'm doing my best

587
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:16,164
to hang tough, you know?

588
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,457
Exactly. Don't hang tough. Just rest.

589
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,383
Wait, Mr. Cha.

590
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:33,511
Damn it!

591
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:35,019
Damn it!

592
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,944
Ms. Hong!

593
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:44,652
-Are you okay?
-Oh, no.

594
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:47,106
Yes.

595
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:48,284
I'm fine.

596
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:52,159
I was just checking the continuity.

597
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:53,528
The bed.

598
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:56,083
Oh, it's so comfortable.

599
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:57,959
Redo the layout.

600
00:40:58,038 --> 00:40:59,708
And contact the production team
to make sure that the lights are LEDs.

601
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,250
The layout? He's being ridiculous.

602
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:02,753
Readability, clarity,
and attractiveness. Consider all these.

603
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:04,375
<i>Lights are LEDs? I want him to die.</i>

604
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:05,712
Don't forget to highlight
the beauty of space.

605
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:06,876
<i>The beauty of space? What a crazy jerk.</i>

606
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:07,974
Lastly, contact the agency manager.

607
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:08,918
<i>Should I beat him up and go to prison?</i>

608
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:11,258
And get a written progress report.

609
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:13,223
<i>Agency manager?
What should I do with that asshole?</i>

610
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,814
THE LAYOUT? HE'S BEING RIDICULOUS
LIGHTS ARE LEDS? I WANT HIM TO DIE...

611
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:16,639
Oh, Ms. Hong.

612
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:18,475
Yes, Mr. Cha?

613
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:20,439
Go survey the shooting
location tomorrow morning.

614
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:21,559
With the AD.

615
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:22,725
A...

616
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,523
We'll make sure everything is okay.

617
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:26,147
Hey. Why me, all of a sudden?

618
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,277
Congrats.

619
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,490
You're the best.

620
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:30,950
Dang it.

621
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,574
Did you write all that down?

622
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:36,407
Why does he always speak so fast?

623
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:42,075
Hey, maybe Master Cha likes you.

624
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:43,958
Are you crazy?

625
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:44,883
Jeez.

626
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,710
That asshole wants to kill me.

627
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:49,257
He almost killed me on the stairs.

628
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,130
What happened? Did he push you?

629
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,297
No.

630
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,760
It's not that.

631
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,095
I think

632
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,641
you hate Master Cha for no reason.

633
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:00,937
Right?

634
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,940
Why would he help someone
he wants to kill build a career?

635
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:05,901
Oh, sir. Hello. Thank you
for your hard work. We'll do our best.

636
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:06,981
Hi.

637
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,690
Hey, you're the most successful
one among our colleagues.

638
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:13,278
None of us have a portfolio
as impressive as yours.

639
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:15,949
Do I look like I'm successful?

640
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:19,543
Red Bomb and pep pills
make my head spin all the time.

641
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,120
Now all I have left are a gastric ulcer,
menstrual irregularity,

642
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,996
and extreme insomnia.

643
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:29,879
Hey, guys usually pick on girls
when they like them.

644
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:33,929
Then does he like everyone in our company?

645
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:35,339
He picks on just about everyone.

646
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:38,387
He just picks on me more often. That's it.

647
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:41,312
Wow! The view is amazing here. Wait. Stop.

648
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:42,642
One, two, three.

649
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,306
Cut.

650
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,555
Gosh, it's so nice.

651
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,106
Wait for me!

652
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:54,070
Hey, I suggest that you date someone.

653
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:57,695
Spend some time with a guy on a bed

654
00:42:57,783 --> 00:43:00,123
so you can get some sleep.

655
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:01,746
Hey, let's try to seduce someone

656
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,499
at our company's
upcoming anniversary party.

657
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,791
-Hello.
-Oh, hello.

658
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,295
Media Team 2.
Assistant Manager Kim Choongmo.

659
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,460
He graduated from a prestigious university
and owns real estate.

660
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:13,757
Besides, his parents... live abroad.

661
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:16,681
Wow, wow!

662
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,350
He's perfect.

663
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:21,429
Goodness. My background is as good as his.

664
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:23,635
I don't care if his parents live abroad.

665
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:26,597
My dear friend.

666
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:28,766
How long has it been...

667
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:34,108
since you used your tongue with a guy?

668
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:35,398
What?

669
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:37,237
How long...

670
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:40,989
...has it been since your tongue...

671
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:46,206
...last wrestled with a guy's tongue?

672
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:50,000
I mean, how long has it been
since you lied down on a bed

673
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:52,955
and did this with a guy?

674
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:59,932
I don't believe what guys say in bed.

675
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:04,144
I don't bet my life on such a fantasy.

676
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:07,898
I would rather bet on my abilities,
brain, and achievements.

677
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:09,614
It's good.

678
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:12,975
If I work hard, I get rewards.
Nothing is as rewarding as work.

679
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:15,322
You're so inflexible.

680
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:17,362
I want to kiss a guy so badly.

681
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:19,816
- "I love you, darling." And kiss. Bam.
- Ms. Jang.

682
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:21,197
-Oh, yes?
-There's something I need to ask you.

683
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:22,993
I'm coming. Oh, my back hurts.

684
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:31,707
<i>There were times when I thought</i>

685
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:35,014
<i>I could enjoy romance
if I put in the effort.</i>

686
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:37,378
<i>But...</i>

687
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:47,555
Hello?

688
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:19,469
I don't like things like this.

689
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,510
Ouch!

690
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:21,974
Hey, be gentle.

691
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:23,262
- I'm sorry.
- Are you okay, Jiyoung?

692
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:24,175
For goodness' sake.

693
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:26,813
<i>Dealing with a mode
is one of the easiest tasks of an AE.</i>

694
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:27,810
Let me see. You're fine, right?

695
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:29,521
<i>And I've done it many times.</i>

696
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:31,151
Are you sure this glittery thing
looks good on me?

697
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:32,808
Yes, it's pretty.
You look so beautiful.

698
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:33,856
Hello.

699
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:37,943
I'm AE Hong Yesool,
the PM of this Billy commercial.

700
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:44,241
I guess I didn't complain hard enough.

701
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:48,155
The person in charge didn't come
but sent someone else.

702
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:53,205
When is Minhu, my darling, coming?

703
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:54,792
<i>"My darling?"</i>

704
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:58,383
<i>- What's that supposed to mean?</i>
- Have a seat.

705
00:45:58,714 --> 00:45:59,634
Oh.

706
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:02,468
Mr. Cha is on his way here.

707
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:04,641
He said he'd be a little late,
so I came first.

708
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,560
I guess you have poor judgment.

709
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:10,138
You're making a commercial
with Oh Jiyoung,

710
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:11,482
but purity?

711
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:13,515
I've never

712
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,691
tried such a concept since I was 22.

713
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:18,483
All the dramas and movies I was in
as a pure and innocent girl

714
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:21,493
completely bombed. Didn't you know?

715
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:23,242
What do you mean, bombed?

716
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:25,282
I love "Hello Again,"
the one that you're in.

717
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:29,914
I personally love it when you appear
as a pure and innocent girl.

718
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:32,962
But unfortunately,
the theme of this commercial isn't purity.

719
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:35,713
It's just about you.
Oh Jiyoung as an individual.

720
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:45,836
We're also planning to hold

721
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:49,218
a social media event
where we sell a package of goods

722
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:51,806
that you use at night before going to bed.

723
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:53,852
What does this have to do

724
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:55,773
with the bed commercial?

725
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:59,864
People are curious to know
where you sleep and what you eat.

726
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:02,994
Things that you do before going to bed,
the tea that you drink,

727
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,820
and even the cosmetics that you use.

728
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:07,735
This event isn't just about the bed.

729
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,825
It's about Oh Jiyoung as well.

730
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:12,410
Through this commercial, you'll be able

731
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,996
to show the values of Oh Jiyoung
that people admire.

732
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:20,750
It's not bad.

733
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,880
Now I see why Minhu keeps you around.

734
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:27,587
I'll take that as a compliment.

735
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,810
I'll get going then.

736
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:31,268
By the way, Ms. Hong.

737
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:33,389
What lipstick

738
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:35,234
do you use?

739
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:37,104
I like the color.

740
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:45,606
<i>Okay. Good.</i>

741
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:49,533
The one you use is a much better one.

742
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:51,616
Oh, Ms. Oh. Just a minute.

743
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:56,707
Hey, let's resume.

744
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:36,869
Ms. Oh.

745
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:47,301
Oh, well...

746
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:49,972
Well, I was just...

747
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:53,062
Oh, I got something for you.

748
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:55,432
You said you liked
the color of my lipstick,

749
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:56,765
so I bought one for you.

750
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:59,144
I'll leave it there,

751
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:00,936
so please continue what you were doing.

752
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:10,025
It flew.

753
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,695
I'm sorry to interrupt you.

754
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:19,918
I'll leave right now.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

755
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:22,458
Ms. Oh. I'll see you
on the day of the shoot.

756
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:23,712
Bye, Mr. Cha.

757
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:25,628
I'll get going.

758
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:32,087
Jiyoung. It's time to go.

759
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:33,717
Go ahead and do the shoot.

760
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:34,854
Minhu.

761
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:38,392
Please check her hair once more.
Bring the dress too.

762
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:39,475
The dress, please.

763
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:43,153
What was that?

764
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,070
What was he doing with Oh Jiyoung?

765
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:46,978
By any chance, are they...

766
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:49,862
They must be crazy.

767
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:52,361
Ms. Hong.

768
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:54,617
-What happened earlier was...
-It's all right.

769
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:57,242
I'm the one who should be sorry
for ruining the mood.

770
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:01,118
It's your private life.
I shouldn't have barged in like that.

771
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:03,922
You're old enough, you know?

772
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:06,751
There's nothing wrong
with kissing this girl and that girl.

773
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:09,379
This girl and that girl? And what?

774
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:11,842
No, nothing.

775
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:18,564
I did it with that girl,

776
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:20,226
but not with this girl.

777
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:25,108
It's a misunderstanding,
so watch your mouth.

778
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:26,188
All right?

779
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:32,898
Come back in.

780
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:47,667
By the way, when is Yesool coming?

781
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:49,593
She said she'd come, so I came too.

782
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:52,589
This is my welcome party,
and you're not here for me?

783
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:53,594
No.

784
00:50:54,634 --> 00:50:57,644
All Kim Minhee cares about is Hong Yesool.

785
00:50:57,721 --> 00:51:00,351
She's not interested in people like you.

786
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:02,768
So...

787
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:06,861
So are you getting used
to the planning team?

788
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:08,518
How do you like the AE work?

789
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:12,855
You know AEs are the flower
of an advertising company.

790
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:15,818
The flower is in full bloom.

791
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,156
What do you think you're doing?

792
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,030
That's not how you do it.
What the heck are you doing?

793
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:20,737
That's right. AEs are like flowers.

794
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:22,997
They get snapped off all the time.

795
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,870
They gradually wither away and get dumped.

796
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:25,866
Just like me.

797
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:28,537
Did you say goodbye
to your parents and lover?

798
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:32,213
Work-life balance, my foot.

799
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:33,917
It's not easy for us
to have free time in the evening.

800
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:35,427
Our life is all about overtime work.

801
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:37,219
All right. Let's have a toast.

802
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:40,425
- All right!
- Bottoms up! Bottoms up.

803
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:44,104
- It's not over yet, is it?
- I feel drunk.

804
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:46,354
- I like it so much. I do. It feels good.
- Wow!

805
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:49,192
- What took you so long?
- Go take those.

806
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:54,320
I haven't drunk for a while.

807
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:57,533
By the way,

808
00:51:58,031 --> 00:52:00,451
why is Mr. Cha Minhu not here today?

809
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:04,044
You know, it's the first
and last welcome party for me.

810
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:05,211
Roma.

811
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:08,919
Just like families and classes
have their own mottoes,

812
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,420
our team has a motto too.

813
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:11,882
That's right!

814
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:15,222
Don't ever think of having a meal
with Mr. Cha.

815
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:18,050
Our team never had a meal together
for the past five years.

816
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:19,386
What?

817
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:21,431
I'll give you some handy tips.
Write them down quickly.

818
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:22,813
-Write them down.
-Okay.

819
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:24,889
Don't talk too much
when Mr. Cha is present.

820
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:26,765
Don't use your tongue but bring results.

821
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:29,272
And when you're with Mr. Cha,
your memory is always wrong.

822
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:31,274
Always write down what he says.

823
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:32,863
Record it too if you can.

824
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:34,901
You know what?

825
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,645
Mr. Cha never meets people
outside of work.

826
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:38,736
He neither has a hobby
nor belongs to a social club.

827
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:40,952
Besides, it seems
that he's not seeing anyone.

828
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:44,082
How does he figure out
the needs of every client?

829
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:46,331
-I get goose bumps.
-"I get goose bumps."

830
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:48,833
He can read other people's minds.

831
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:50,334
-Really?
-Uh-huh.

832
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:52,457
You'll see that when you follow him
to presentations.

833
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:55,424
He has the ability to shut people up
by figuring out what they'll say

834
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:56,915
before they even open their mouths.

835
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:59,127
He even distinguished

836
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:01,386
a heavy rain from a shower
during post-sync.

837
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:03,719
He's a five-sense freak who knows

838
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:05,175
the color of every sound.

839
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:07,675
Well, do sounds have different colors?

840
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:09,477
How would I know?

841
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:13,234
-Ms. Hong has many abilities too.
-Huh?

842
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:15,775
It was a commercial
for camping supplies last month.

843
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:18,069
I wonder how she knew that
the model's outfit would be ripped.

844
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:21,113
She prepared an extra,
so the shoot went very smoothly.

845
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:26,287
She's a precognition freak.

846
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:28,909
She always says she foresees the future.

847
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:31,287
I'm so sick of hearing her say that.
For goodness' sake.

848
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:34,214
From now on, I'm just going
to follow you guys around.

849
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:36,554
Don't do that.

850
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:38,717
Mr. Cha doesn't take just anyone with him.

851
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:41,934
Just follow me around.
I can take you with me.

852
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:43,720
-That's mine!
-You're daring.

853
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:45,473
This fellow is quite daring.

854
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:47,715
- Now I can see that.
- All right! Let's have a toast!

855
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:50,394
Just a second.

856
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:54,267
Rock! Yes!

857
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:56,776
<i>Gosh, we'll just set it up tonight.</i>

858
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,648
No, Mr. Yeom.

859
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:01,073
Please follow the directions
on the manual.

860
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:02,664
There's nothing impossible.

861
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:05,581
Hey, everyone is on the set right now
to set up the bed.

862
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:07,619
You can't set it up outside already.

863
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:09,412
What if something happens
before the shoot tomorrow...

864
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:12,706
Come on! Nothing will happen. Hey.

865
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:15,253
If we set it up early tomorrow morning,

866
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:17,745
everyone will be too tired
to do the shoot.

867
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:19,297
Why are you so inflexible? Jeez.

868
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:21,841
I told our staff that we'd set it up
early tomorrow morning.

869
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,215
And that's what I notified Mr. Cha of...

870
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:25,511
Hey! Forget it! All right?

871
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:27,885
-But...
-I'll take care of it all,

872
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:29,853
so don't worry!

873
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:32,273
Sleep tight.
I'll see you at seven tomorrow.

874
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:34,439
For God's sake.

875
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:35,812
Here you go, darling.

876
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:37,067
Oh.

877
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:40,282
Gosh.

878
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:44,025
I'll have mercy on him
until tomorrow's shoot.

879
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:47,868
Boy.

880
00:54:48,576 --> 00:54:49,946
What? Where did everyone go?

881
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:51,872
Rock, paper, scissors.

882
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:53,826
Yes!

883
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:02,049
Hello.

884
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:08,103
Hello!

885
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:10,268
Take a break to have this.

886
00:55:10,348 --> 00:55:11,848
Here.

887
00:55:11,933 --> 00:55:14,233
The production team
will come soon to do a final check.

888
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:16,561
Why do you guys keep coming?
You're on the planning team.

889
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:18,356
Ms. Hong stopped by too a while ago.

890
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,610
Well, this is my job.

891
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:21,992
Boy, you're now a chief.
But you haven't changed at all.

892
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:24,608
You take care of everything from A to Z.

893
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:26,026
Guys.

894
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:28,704
Mr. Cha brought some food for us.
Let's eat.

895
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:29,833
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

896
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:30,829
-Hello.
-Guys. Come.

897
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:33,750
I've brought enough food for everyone.
Please help us until the end.

898
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:35,667
Mr. Cha.

899
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:40,206
If it doesn't look abundant enough,
we have more here, so add them.

900
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:41,705
Okay. It looks good.

901
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:44,673
We just need to fill this.
Then we can go home.

902
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:45,968
-Thank you for the food.
-Sure. Go ahead and eat.

903
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:46,931
Yes.

904
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:02,154
CHIEF CHA MINHU

905
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:04,863
Gosh, why is this punk calling me again?

906
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:07,491
Hi, Mr. Cha.

907
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:09,322
Are you ready for the shoot tomorrow?

908
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:12,293
I checked with the directing
and production teams and the models.

909
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:15,039
I don't think there's going to be
any problem with the shoot tomorrow.

910
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:16,955
You think? Or are you sure?

911
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:21,588
Make sure there's no problem at all.

912
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:25,761
Okay.

913
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,090
Oh, and Mr. Cha.

914
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:29,586
Can you please take a look
at my project proposal

915
00:56:29,677 --> 00:56:30,797
<i>for the Morphis Campaign...</i>

916
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:32,893
HONG YESOOL
CALL ENDED

917
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:48,201
I need some sugar.

918
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:05,838
Ramyeon is filling.

919
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:10,178
What are you doing here?

920
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,260
What's up with you being at home?
You scared me.

921
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:15,219
What's so scary about me being
at my mom's house?

922
00:57:15,306 --> 00:57:17,976
Please answer Auntie's calls, will you?

923
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:21,309
She calls me from the US all the time
because you won't answer her calls.

924
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:24,396
Okay.

925
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:32,735
I was away from home for several days.

926
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:34,244
But you didn't even care, did you?

927
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:37,246
I didn't come home for an entire week.

928
00:57:37,328 --> 00:57:38,578
Did you care?

929
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:42,924
I'm sure you worked all night
with Cha Minhu.

930
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:47,549
What's that?

931
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:50,757
You don't know?

932
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:57,389
You broke your promise with me again.

933
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,854
I don't have much time left.
Don't you feel sorry for my life?

934
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:02,901
You're mean.

935
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,819
You're so mean.

936
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:16,952
GETTING A TATTOO
STAYING AT HOME FOR A WEEK

937
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:33,552
Are you mad?

938
00:58:36,804 --> 00:58:38,014
Come on.

939
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:41,478
I want to spend time with you too.

940
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:44,060
When this campaign is over, let's...

941
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:45,232
Yesool.

942
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:47,020
Now,

943
00:58:47,565 --> 00:58:49,475
I don't have much time left.

944
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:52,027
You know...

945
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:54,702
what my future will be like.

946
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:01,037
So what's your next mission?

947
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:02,788
I'll do that with you.

948
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:04,171
No.

949
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:06,214
You can't do it.

950
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:17,931
You still think so?

951
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:25,518
Yesool.

952
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:28,193
I love you, Yesool. Thank you!

953
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:31,816
Oh, come on. Don't do that.
How many are these?

954
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:34,284
Thank you.

955
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:35,912
For goodness' sake.

956
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:38,069
I love you, Yesool.

957
00:59:38,157 --> 00:59:40,737
ZEU AD PLANNING TEAM 1,
ZEU AD PRODUCTION TEAM 1...

958
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:48,081
It's strange.

959
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:50,545
Everything is set perfectly.

960
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,510
Why do I have a bad feeling about it?

961
01:00:02,682 --> 01:00:03,732
What was that?

962
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:06,353
How could he play around with a girl
at our sacred workplace?

963
01:00:07,228 --> 01:00:08,398
What a douchebag.

964
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,940
I should go to sleep.

965
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:22,078
But why can't I...

966
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:25,750
...get to sleep?

967
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:37,883
CHIEF CHA MINHU

968
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:41,049
<i>My sixth sense.</i>

969
01:00:41,929 --> 01:00:43,969
<i>Cha the Jerk is calling me
at this hour of night?</i>

970
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:46,144
<i>That means something has happened.</i>

971
01:00:50,438 --> 01:00:52,108
Hi, Mr. Cha. I'm on my way...

972
01:00:53,941 --> 01:00:54,981
What?

973
01:01:20,551 --> 01:01:22,351
PRODUCTION TEAM 1 CHIEF YEOM KYUNGSEOK
CALLING

974
01:01:27,308 --> 01:01:28,888
Why isn't he picking up?

975
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:32,056
PRODUCTION TEAM 1 CHIEF YEOM KYUNGSEOK
KIM MINHEE

976
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:37,985
How come none of them is picking up?

977
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:43,779
- Sir. Please go faster.
- Okay.

978
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:50,249
This is driving me crazy.

979
01:02:14,605 --> 01:02:15,855
Mr. Cha.

980
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:28,445
First, keep calling the production
and directing teams.

981
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:31,785
-I'll help you.
-Call them first!

982
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:06,235
I was able to reach
some of the people on both teams,

983
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:07,834
and they're on their way here.

984
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:11,909
Who said you could set things up
like this?

985
01:03:12,538 --> 01:03:14,538
Just because you didn't want
to come an hour earlier,

986
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:16,134
you put the bed outside?

987
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:21,093
I checked the weather forecast.
It said nothing about rain.

988
01:03:23,382 --> 01:03:25,222
And the production team
wouldn't listen to me.

989
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:27,011
I'm just an assistant manager.

990
01:03:27,094 --> 01:03:28,814
Thinking that I know nothing
about technical things,

991
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:30,718
both the production and directing teams
never follow my orders. You know that.

992
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:32,807
Is making an excuse all you can do
in a situation like this?

993
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:33,852
Mr. Cha.

994
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:36,773
I'm on the planning team.
But production, marketing,

995
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:39,733
and even odd jobs like this...
Why do I have to do all those?

996
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:42,185
If you still don't know why,

997
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:44,109
pull out of this campaign.

998
01:03:51,035 --> 01:03:52,195
I'm sorry.

999
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:57,037
Think about what you can do now
and tell me.

1000
01:04:00,586 --> 01:04:01,956
When the production team arrives...

1001
01:04:02,046 --> 01:04:03,796
Let's say you bring some people.
Then what?

1002
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:05,720
Can anyone replace you on this project?

1003
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:09,804
All you can do now

1004
01:04:09,887 --> 01:04:12,597
is to bring someone and ask them
to take care of the mess you made?

1005
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:14,888
No, sir.

1006
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:17,687
I'll make a revision for the shoot.

1007
01:04:18,646 --> 01:04:19,976
Good.

1008
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:44,546
Mr. Cha.

1009
01:05:28,883 --> 01:05:30,223
<i>My sixth sense.</i>

1010
01:05:31,469 --> 01:05:33,139
<i>I've never foreseen something like this.</i>

1011
01:05:35,848 --> 01:05:38,388
<i>I foresaw a future
that should never happen.</i>
