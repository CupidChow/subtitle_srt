00:00:05,468 --> 00:00:07,468
(dramatic music)

2
00:00:10,848 --> 00:00:12,018
Let's break up.

3
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:20,648
(sighs)

4
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:23,898
I said let's break up.

5
00:00:24,398 --> 00:00:26,698
(dramatic music)

6
00:00:33,618 --> 00:00:35,368
PILYO: Hong Yesool, you seriously...

7
00:00:37,418 --> 00:00:38,838
(sighs)
Do you...

8
00:00:41,378 --> 00:00:43,208
seriously not trust me? Is that why?

9
00:00:46,548 --> 00:00:48,138
I told you.

10
00:00:50,468 --> 00:00:51,968
We're bound to...

11
00:00:55,598 --> 00:00:57,148
break up anyway.

12
00:01:03,148 --> 00:01:05,068
YESOOL: <i>I've thought of this before.</i>

13
00:01:05,818 --> 00:01:08,158
<i>"Was this bound to happen?</i>

14
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,908
<i>Or did I make it happen?"</i>

15
00:01:24,508 --> 00:01:25,668
(moans)

16
00:01:26,218 --> 00:01:28,428
(breathes deeply)

17
00:01:32,178 --> 00:01:34,768
(ominous music)

18
00:01:37,058 --> 00:01:38,438
(gasps)

19
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:42,438
How did I get here?

20
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:46,238
(theme music)

21
00:02:28,438 --> 00:02:29,358
BIRTH OF ZELUS

22
00:02:36,998 --> 00:02:38,828
-What's wrong with you?
-(laughs)

23
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:40,748
How are you going
to face me tomorrow, huh?

24
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:43,288
I see the future when I kiss someone.

25
00:02:43,378 --> 00:02:44,628
Okay, sure.

26
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,498
I saw it.

27
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:50,218
You and I will be sleeping together
in the future.

28
00:02:51,548 --> 00:02:54,008
So I wanted to double-check it.

29
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,888
-Double-check?
-Yes.

30
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,478
BASED ON THE WEBNOVEL
KISS SIXTH SENSE BY GOT W

31
00:02:59,558 --> 00:03:01,478
WRITTEN BY JEON YURI

32
00:03:01,558 --> 00:03:03,058
(sighs)

33
00:03:13,738 --> 00:03:14,948
(gasps)

34
00:03:16,658 --> 00:03:17,788
(gasps in surprise)

35
00:03:18,748 --> 00:03:19,828
(sighs)

36
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:22,538
(pants)

37
00:03:25,418 --> 00:03:26,668
(gasps)

38
00:03:30,798 --> 00:03:31,968
Man.

39
00:03:36,798 --> 00:03:37,928
(sighs)

40
00:03:39,718 --> 00:03:40,848
Mr. Cha.

41
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,148
How much do you remember about last night?

42
00:03:46,608 --> 00:03:48,188
You were the only one drinking.

43
00:03:48,778 --> 00:03:50,318
(chuckles awkwardly)

44
00:03:51,028 --> 00:03:54,528
Then you must remember everything
I said last night,

45
00:03:54,608 --> 00:03:55,818
so I'll cut to the chase.

46
00:03:56,488 --> 00:03:59,738
Fine. So you can see the future?

47
00:04:01,288 --> 00:04:03,368
-It sounds absurd, but...
-And...

48
00:04:04,618 --> 00:04:06,748
you saw us sleeping together
in the future?

49
00:04:06,828 --> 00:04:09,918
I'm sure it's hard to believe,
but we really are...

50
00:04:09,998 --> 00:04:11,628
That's why you...

51
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:15,338
you tried to kiss me that night
at my house.

52
00:04:17,258 --> 00:04:18,218
(sighs)

53
00:04:19,508 --> 00:04:20,638
And

54
00:04:21,718 --> 00:04:22,638
last night too.

55
00:04:23,768 --> 00:04:27,268
But you kissed me first last night.

56
00:04:27,358 --> 00:04:28,518
I'm sure you...

57
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:31,978
So I wanted to double-check it.

58
00:04:32,608 --> 00:04:33,778
Can I?

59
00:04:35,528 --> 00:04:37,658
-Well, that was...
-(sucks air)

60
00:04:38,318 --> 00:04:39,698
Do you have feelings for me?

61
00:04:39,908 --> 00:04:40,868
Pardon?

62
00:04:42,038 --> 00:04:45,248
(scoffs)
I'm not interested in you at all.

63
00:04:45,328 --> 00:04:47,078
Exactly! So how do we...

64
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:49,708
end up, you know?

65
00:04:50,288 --> 00:04:54,838
So I have no idea how we get that far
and it's driving me crazy.

66
00:04:56,128 --> 00:04:58,588
But what I saw is true.

67
00:04:59,428 --> 00:05:02,888
Somehow we'll end up like that.

68
00:05:04,518 --> 00:05:05,688
(sighs)

69
00:05:10,108 --> 00:05:11,438
(rustling)

70
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:15,068
Here.

71
00:05:17,858 --> 00:05:19,698
Well...
(sighs)

72
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:21,198
You do have to go to work, you know.

73
00:05:23,828 --> 00:05:25,078
Get changed.

74
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,578
(quirky music)

75
00:05:30,078 --> 00:05:31,588
(door opens)

76
00:05:34,378 --> 00:05:35,468
(door closes)

77
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:38,678
(sighs)

78
00:05:44,968 --> 00:05:47,438
(light music)

79
00:06:01,158 --> 00:06:02,448
AUTOMATED VOICE: <i>Going down.</i>

80
00:06:03,078 --> 00:06:04,408
(sighs)

81
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:14,418
So, can you really see the future
if you kiss someone?

82
00:06:15,878 --> 00:06:18,008
I mean, what have you been
listening to all along?

83
00:06:18,968 --> 00:06:21,718
Then when we kissed last night

84
00:06:23,548 --> 00:06:25,428
in my car,

85
00:06:26,268 --> 00:06:28,098
what did you see?

86
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:32,518
Umm.

87
00:06:32,608 --> 00:06:34,438
(quirky music)

88
00:06:35,018 --> 00:06:36,068
Oh!

89
00:06:37,738 --> 00:06:38,778
Huh?

90
00:06:40,778 --> 00:06:41,698
(exhales uncertainly)

91
00:06:41,778 --> 00:06:43,948
What? You didn't see anything?

92
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,328
Well...

93
00:06:47,288 --> 00:06:50,158
I do see the future when I kiss someone.

94
00:06:50,248 --> 00:06:51,828
It happens consistently

95
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:55,588
but I guess I just can't remember.
I'm not sure what's going on...

96
00:06:56,248 --> 00:06:57,208
(scoffs)

97
00:06:57,588 --> 00:06:58,708
(elevator dings)

98
00:06:59,758 --> 00:07:01,218
(exhales deeply)

99
00:07:01,298 --> 00:07:03,298
(dramatic music)

100
00:07:24,368 --> 00:07:26,028
(sighs deeply)

101
00:07:26,118 --> 00:07:27,328
AUTOMATED VOICE: <i>Going down.</i>

102
00:07:33,118 --> 00:07:35,958
(breathes deeply)

103
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,798
Mr. Cha Minhu, I didn't get
a chance to say hello last night.

104
00:07:43,928 --> 00:07:46,298
-I'm Lee Pilyo.
-Oh, I'm Cha Minhu.

105
00:07:46,388 --> 00:07:47,808
I don't have a business card on me.

106
00:07:47,888 --> 00:07:49,968
-I'll introduce myself properly next time.
-Sure.

107
00:07:53,558 --> 00:07:54,598
(sighs)

108
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:58,018
I'm staying on the sixth floor
of this hotel.

109
00:07:58,438 --> 00:08:02,188
(inhales)
Their breakfast is great here.

110
00:08:02,568 --> 00:08:04,528
I often have meetings here too.

111
00:08:05,198 --> 00:08:06,568
The advertising industry
must be pretty demanding too.

112
00:08:06,658 --> 00:08:07,988
You're starting out so early
in the morning.

113
00:08:08,078 --> 00:08:09,368
(chuckles)

114
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:10,488
(elevator dings)

115
00:08:10,578 --> 00:08:11,998
We'll get going.

116
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,288
(dramatic music)

117
00:08:31,808 --> 00:08:33,308
(shoes screech)

118
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:36,018
SEUNGTAEK: Huh? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

119
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,898
(stuttering)
What are you doing here at this hour?

120
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,478
(sighs)

121
00:08:41,568 --> 00:08:44,698
YESSOL: <i>How many people are we running
into in this hotel?</i>

122
00:08:47,108 --> 00:08:50,158
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
The two of you...

123
00:08:50,578 --> 00:08:51,698
The two...

124
00:08:51,788 --> 00:08:53,158
Why are you two here?

125
00:08:53,788 --> 00:08:55,828
(quirky music)

126
00:08:56,618 --> 00:08:58,788
Oh. Oh!

127
00:08:58,878 --> 00:09:02,918
You must be working off-site. Off-site.
I'm making a house call here.

128
00:09:03,008 --> 00:09:05,088
-I got a call from the hotel today.
-Bye.

129
00:09:05,168 --> 00:09:06,338
Oh, okay.

130
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:10,848
Bye.

131
00:09:16,728 --> 00:09:18,598
Is he nuts? Huh?

132
00:09:19,478 --> 00:09:20,728
-Boo!
-Hey, you startled me.

133
00:09:20,818 --> 00:09:22,688
(giggles)

134
00:09:22,778 --> 00:09:24,188
Should we get some breakfast?

135
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,858
Sure. Shall we?

136
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:28,488
-Let's go.
-Okay.

137
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:37,458
(chuckles)

138
00:09:37,538 --> 00:09:40,748
You know, I don't usually do this.

139
00:09:40,838 --> 00:09:44,958
I'm actually a very discreet person.
But last night was...

140
00:09:45,048 --> 00:09:46,838
Are you busy this week?

141
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:48,718
Sorry?

142
00:09:48,798 --> 00:09:51,548
Do you plan to get hospitalized,
move out of the country, or get married

143
00:09:51,928 --> 00:09:52,928
this week?

144
00:09:54,098 --> 00:09:55,138
What did you say?

145
00:09:55,218 --> 00:09:57,308
Anyway, if you've got
nothing else going on,

146
00:09:58,938 --> 00:09:59,978
do you want to go out with me?

147
00:10:00,398 --> 00:10:01,268
(clanks)

148
00:10:01,898 --> 00:10:03,148
Just for a week.

149
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:04,568
Passionately.

150
00:10:06,938 --> 00:10:09,778
(quirky music)

151
00:10:14,368 --> 00:10:16,658
After you left like that last night,
everyone's wondering

152
00:10:16,748 --> 00:10:18,788
if you've got something going on
with Lee Pilyo.

153
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,128
It's him, huh? Lee Pilyo.

154
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:22,708
Your ex-boyfriend.

155
00:10:24,038 --> 00:10:25,048
(sighing)
Yeah.

156
00:10:25,128 --> 00:10:26,168
(sighs)

157
00:10:26,628 --> 00:10:29,338
(sobs)
What a persistent bond.

158
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:31,638
You went through so much
crying your heart out.

159
00:10:31,718 --> 00:10:33,638
And to bump into him like this...

160
00:10:35,388 --> 00:10:38,268
Cha Minhu on the right
and Lee Pilyo on the left.

161
00:10:38,348 --> 00:10:39,768
Is this a drama or something?

162
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:42,768
So, which one?
Which channel should I watch?

163
00:10:42,858 --> 00:10:45,438
-Don't change the channel!
-Neither one of them.

164
00:10:45,518 --> 00:10:47,778
So that's what Mr. Cha said?

165
00:10:47,858 --> 00:10:50,198
(stuttering)
Well, it is...

166
00:10:50,278 --> 00:10:52,068
(gasps)
Yesool!

167
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:54,778
Isn't this a Lisa?

168
00:10:55,578 --> 00:10:57,238
Huh? Oh, yes. It is.

169
00:10:57,328 --> 00:11:00,038
I pretty much have to give away
my entire month's salary

170
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,868
so I only had my eye on it.

171
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:04,458
-And it's a new collection at that!
-Hmm.

172
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,128
When did you buy it?

173
00:11:08,048 --> 00:11:10,218
(inhales)
Do you want some chocolate?

174
00:11:10,508 --> 00:11:12,838
No thanks. I'm going on a diet.

175
00:11:12,928 --> 00:11:15,348
Minhee is so interested in fashion.

176
00:11:15,428 --> 00:11:16,638
An amazing person.

177
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:18,348
-EOMJI: Get back to work.
-MINHEE: Okay.

178
00:11:18,968 --> 00:11:20,638
Oh, I came for some tea.

179
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:22,138
(tuts)

180
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:24,148
(sighs in frustration)

181
00:11:24,978 --> 00:11:26,228
(tuts)

182
00:11:29,028 --> 00:11:31,448
Oh, no. Mr. Cha bought it.

183
00:11:32,738 --> 00:11:34,658
-Minhu did?
-Yeah.

184
00:11:34,948 --> 00:11:37,408
He called me early this morning
and took it,

185
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,328
even telling me the exact size.

186
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:41,788
Including heels. The whole shebang.

187
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,498
Jiyoung, because you spent
too much time overseas,

188
00:11:46,588 --> 00:11:48,418
your schedule is very tight.
I'll get you the outfit later...

189
00:11:48,498 --> 00:11:49,628
Hey! Shit.

190
00:11:50,758 --> 00:11:52,588
Do you think he bought it for you?

191
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:56,968
Come to think of it,
it wasn't your size, though.

192
00:12:00,018 --> 00:12:01,178
Oh, no.

193
00:12:01,728 --> 00:12:03,558
He did get it for me.

194
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:07,978
But how can you not remember
your VIP's size?

195
00:12:08,068 --> 00:12:09,778
(chuckles)

196
00:12:09,858 --> 00:12:11,608
What are you saying?

197
00:12:11,688 --> 00:12:14,198
Your shoe size is 235 mm, hon.

198
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:17,948
I remember clearly.
The ones he took this morning were 240 mm.

199
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:22,578
You can't spill my personal info
just like that.

200
00:12:23,038 --> 00:12:28,208
(scoffs)
And why am I your "honey"?

201
00:12:28,288 --> 00:12:29,588
-(inhales)
-(Jiyoung tuts)

202
00:12:29,668 --> 00:12:30,628
(clears throat)

203
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,208
(scoffs)

204
00:12:33,088 --> 00:12:34,428
(sighs)

205
00:12:34,508 --> 00:12:36,888
I think I'm going to stop shopping here.

206
00:12:38,548 --> 00:12:39,558
Bye.

207
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,768
(sighs deeply)

208
00:12:42,308 --> 00:12:43,638
(Sanggoo inhales deeply)

209
00:12:43,728 --> 00:12:46,688
SANGGOO: If the target audience
is in the 20s and 30s...

210
00:12:46,768 --> 00:12:49,768
Then isn't it someone like me,
a young professional starting out?

211
00:12:49,858 --> 00:12:51,818
Something like,
"Rooting for the golden youth."

212
00:12:51,898 --> 00:12:54,318
No, this car isn't for people
who are just starting out.

213
00:12:54,738 --> 00:12:57,988
It's for young bosses
who were born with silver spoons.

214
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,778
It's insanely expensive.

215
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:06,828
(exclaims)
This car is so sexy.

216
00:13:06,918 --> 00:13:09,378
It makes me want to ram into it. Goodness.

217
00:13:09,838 --> 00:13:10,788
(sighs)

218
00:13:11,548 --> 00:13:12,958
Ms. Jang.

219
00:13:13,588 --> 00:13:14,508
Yes?

220
00:13:14,588 --> 00:13:16,678
You're not even on our team.
Why are you always here?

221
00:13:16,758 --> 00:13:18,008
I'm just curious. Really.

222
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:20,348
Gosh, you complain
even when I come to help out.

223
00:13:20,428 --> 00:13:21,888
What's wrong with you?

224
00:13:22,308 --> 00:13:24,678
Actually, V9 is pricy,

225
00:13:24,768 --> 00:13:26,888
but I think we can go trendy
and appeal to young people.

226
00:13:26,978 --> 00:13:28,518
-Car camping is in these days.
-(sighs)

227
00:13:28,598 --> 00:13:30,688
How about we keep the wheels
turning in that direction?

228
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:31,858
-Hmm.
-Hmm.

229
00:13:31,938 --> 00:13:33,108
Car camping...

230
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:36,698
What if a car turns into a bed?

231
00:13:36,778 --> 00:13:38,778
EOMJI: Huh. Hmm.

232
00:13:38,858 --> 00:13:41,238
I just came up with that.
Did you see that?

233
00:13:41,328 --> 00:13:43,158
I can come up with the copy right away.
(snorts)

234
00:13:43,238 --> 00:13:44,828
-Ms. Jang.
-Yes?

235
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:47,208
That's like the idea you came up
with for Billy.

236
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:49,038
What's wrong with you these days?

237
00:13:49,118 --> 00:13:50,918
Do you have something
boiling inside of you?

238
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:54,338
(inhales)
I mean, what can't you do in that car?

239
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:56,048
There's a bed.

240
00:13:56,128 --> 00:13:57,678
A guy and music.

241
00:13:58,428 --> 00:14:01,718
What more do you need in that tight space?

242
00:14:01,798 --> 00:14:03,138
Haven't you done it?

243
00:14:04,388 --> 00:14:05,468
No?

244
00:14:05,768 --> 00:14:09,768
You guys have never done it in a car?

245
00:14:10,228 --> 00:14:12,768
I mean, you honestly haven't done it?
You'd better be straight with me.

246
00:14:12,858 --> 00:14:13,898
Well, actually,

247
00:14:14,268 --> 00:14:16,818
I had my first kiss in my boyfriend's car.

248
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:18,448
(laughs, mutters)

249
00:14:19,778 --> 00:14:22,068
That's what I'm saying.
The day you kiss in a car,

250
00:14:22,158 --> 00:14:25,118
-you go straight to a hotel. Jeez.
-Come on, sit down.

251
00:14:26,248 --> 00:14:27,498
(sniffles)

252
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:31,418
EOMJI: Jeez.

253
00:14:31,498 --> 00:14:32,708
(clears throat)

254
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:35,498
The most private and secretive space.

255
00:14:35,878 --> 00:14:38,628
A space for two that stimulates
all five senses.

256
00:14:38,718 --> 00:14:39,718
(inhales deeply)

257
00:14:39,798 --> 00:14:41,888
I love it. I really like it.

258
00:14:41,968 --> 00:14:43,428
What do you think, Ms. Hong?

259
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:44,808
Good, huh?

260
00:14:44,888 --> 00:14:46,018
(mouthing)
Say you like it.

261
00:14:46,098 --> 00:14:47,558
Well...
(chuckles awkwardly)

262
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:49,138
Let's wrap up the meeting here.

263
00:14:49,228 --> 00:14:51,438
Let's put everything down on paper
and set up another meeting.

264
00:14:51,518 --> 00:14:56,278
Except don't throw everything out there
that you can't justify.

265
00:14:57,028 --> 00:15:00,028
Let's not pull together something
that sounds so unbelievably ridiculous

266
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:01,818
that you can't be accountable for.

267
00:15:01,908 --> 00:15:03,028
Please take responsibility

268
00:15:03,118 --> 00:15:05,908
for every sentence
that's written up in the proposal.

269
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:08,288
Only write down things
that are convincing.

270
00:15:08,368 --> 00:15:11,118
"I don't care if I use the backspace key
to delete it."

271
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:12,458
I hate this type of attitude.

272
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:13,998
-The end.
-(taps on table)

273
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:15,248
SANGGOO: Okay.

274
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:18,758
(door opens)

275
00:15:18,838 --> 00:15:20,918
He always says that when I say something.

276
00:15:21,008 --> 00:15:22,508
(tuts)
Shit.

277
00:15:25,798 --> 00:15:27,008
I'll prove it.

278
00:15:29,848 --> 00:15:32,638
You don't believe me. Right?

279
00:15:32,728 --> 00:15:34,188
That I can see the future.

280
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:36,608
(sighs)
And what you said after that.

281
00:15:37,268 --> 00:15:38,438
Let me prove it to you.

282
00:15:38,528 --> 00:15:40,028
I'll make you believe me.

283
00:15:40,108 --> 00:15:41,448
Let's meet after work.

284
00:15:42,568 --> 00:15:43,818
By the way,

285
00:15:45,448 --> 00:15:46,948
when did you start wearing perfume?

286
00:15:47,408 --> 00:15:48,488
What?

287
00:15:48,578 --> 00:15:52,578
Did you wear the same perfume
on the day of the Billy shoot?

288
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,288
I don't use perfume.

289
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:57,708
(door opens)

290
00:15:58,798 --> 00:16:00,548
-(door closes)
-(sniffs)

291
00:16:04,008 --> 00:16:05,678
How come I don't feel sick?

292
00:16:06,718 --> 00:16:08,678
How come...
(sucks air)

293
00:16:09,388 --> 00:16:10,808
How come I'm feeling fine?

294
00:16:11,928 --> 00:16:14,478
(quirky music)

295
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,488
MINHU: It's weird.

296
00:16:23,568 --> 00:16:25,318
My...

297
00:16:25,858 --> 00:16:27,238
darling.

298
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:28,278
HOWOO

299
00:16:28,368 --> 00:16:31,368
Man, Cha Minhu, that jerk.
His timing sucks.

300
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:32,698
Damn it!
(tuts)

301
00:16:32,788 --> 00:16:33,788
(deep inhale)

302
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,708
Hey, I know you think it's really weird
but at the hotel earlier, I was just...

303
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:38,788
MINHU (on phone): <i>Hey.</i>

304
00:16:38,878 --> 00:16:40,548
-Did you change my medication?
-SEUNGTAEK (on phone): <i>Huh?</i>

305
00:16:40,628 --> 00:16:43,258
Why? Did you faint again?

306
00:16:43,338 --> 00:16:45,718
No. I'm feeling fine. That's why.

307
00:16:45,798 --> 00:16:48,928
If my symptoms disappeared suddenly,
could I be cured naturally?

308
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,808
What? You have no symptoms?

309
00:16:51,888 --> 00:16:52,768
MINHU (on phone): <i>No.</i>

310
00:16:52,848 --> 00:16:55,728
To be exact, I had them,
but they disappeared.

311
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,108
(moans in pain)

312
00:17:04,778 --> 00:17:07,818
(faint laughter)

313
00:17:07,908 --> 00:17:09,278
(moans in pain)

314
00:17:12,828 --> 00:17:15,118
(heart beats)

315
00:17:16,918 --> 00:17:18,878
(laughing continues)

316
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:28,548
(pants)

317
00:17:30,468 --> 00:17:31,928
Where is it?

318
00:17:32,008 --> 00:17:34,728
(exhales deeply)

319
00:17:34,808 --> 00:17:36,478
(groans)

320
00:17:40,188 --> 00:17:41,398
Hold it.

321
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:43,528
(panting)

322
00:17:44,858 --> 00:17:47,068
How much does she weigh?
Don't move! Don't move.

323
00:17:47,148 --> 00:17:48,028
Don't move.

324
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:50,698
(panting)
Here it is.

325
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,828
(panting)

326
00:17:53,618 --> 00:17:55,618
(grunts)

327
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,418
(pants)

328
00:18:01,078 --> 00:18:02,088
Holy crap!

329
00:18:02,168 --> 00:18:04,588
(breathes deeply)

330
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:06,298
-What is it?
-It's hot.

331
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:08,928
What? No, wait a minute! Wait!

332
00:18:09,008 --> 00:18:11,178
-(Minhu groans)
-(Yesool moans)

333
00:18:12,428 --> 00:18:15,428
(Minhu continues panting)

334
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:18,018
(moans)

335
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:19,438
(groans in relief)

336
00:18:19,978 --> 00:18:20,938
Man.

337
00:18:21,808 --> 00:18:23,728
(sighs)

338
00:18:25,978 --> 00:18:28,398
(Minhu pants)

339
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:32,778
(sighs)

340
00:18:40,538 --> 00:18:42,418
(Minhu breathes heavily)

341
00:18:55,428 --> 00:18:56,928
(breathes deeply)

342
00:19:04,938 --> 00:19:07,728
(breathes rapidly)

343
00:19:08,858 --> 00:19:10,068
MINHU: <i>Wait a minute...</i>

344
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:13,868
<i>What's happening?</i>

345
00:19:15,078 --> 00:19:17,448
(pensive music)

346
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:27,298
SEUNGTAEK (on phone):
<i>Hey, Cha Minhu. Hey.</i>

347
00:19:27,378 --> 00:19:29,628
Why aren't you saying anything?
Answer me. Minhu. Hey.

348
00:19:39,138 --> 00:19:40,638
Email it to me when you're done.

349
00:19:45,188 --> 00:19:46,478
(sighs)

350
00:19:56,868 --> 00:19:58,038
(sighs)

351
00:19:58,118 --> 00:20:01,078
YESOOL: <i>Think before you do
anything, you moron.</i>

352
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:05,828
<i>Should I just take it back,
saying I was kidding?</i>

353
00:20:06,588 --> 00:20:08,088
(smacking lips)

354
00:20:09,498 --> 00:20:12,758
<i>Mr. Cha, I think I just rambled
on earlier...</i>

355
00:20:12,838 --> 00:20:14,218
MINHU: <i>How are you going to prove it?</i>

356
00:20:19,058 --> 00:20:20,558
YESOOL: <i>Let's meet in the reference room
right now.</i>

357
00:20:20,638 --> 00:20:22,478
LET'S MEET AT THE REFERENCE ROOM
RIGHT NOW

358
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:32,568
Excuse me for a moment.

359
00:20:34,908 --> 00:20:36,408
-What?
-(smooches)

360
00:20:39,448 --> 00:20:42,948
Dr. Oh Seungtaek is in your room.

361
00:20:43,658 --> 00:20:45,498
That's because he's a friend. Of course.

362
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,208
I can guess stuff like that myself.

363
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:49,338
I think you'll work late again tomorrow.

364
00:20:50,498 --> 00:20:53,048
Dr. Seungtaek has a nosebleed.

365
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:55,758
Perhaps you two are going to beat up
on each other and fight?

366
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,218
(sighs)

367
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:00,258
You still don't believe me, do you?

368
00:21:00,348 --> 00:21:01,808
Excuse me again.

369
00:21:02,808 --> 00:21:04,058
(smooches)

370
00:21:09,058 --> 00:21:10,318
What is it?

371
00:21:11,268 --> 00:21:13,188
You and me...

372
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:15,398
Are we in another country? Is it a desert?

373
00:21:16,238 --> 00:21:18,408
I don't know where we are.

374
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:21,538
Is it dust or sand?

375
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,998
Anyway, we're standing
in the middle of nowhere.

376
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:28,708
Are we shooting a commercial?

377
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:32,458
Well, I don't even know
when this is, either.

378
00:21:32,548 --> 00:21:35,168
It's not like I can see everything
just because I want to.

379
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:42,218
(smooches)

380
00:21:42,308 --> 00:21:44,808
(dramatic music)

381
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,318
Where is this now?

382
00:21:56,858 --> 00:22:01,868
Anyway, I trip over something,
and you hold me.

383
00:22:01,948 --> 00:22:04,408
And because of that, your cellphone screen

384
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:07,208
-cracks.
-What?

385
00:22:07,288 --> 00:22:08,458
(sighs)

386
00:22:09,248 --> 00:22:10,828
I'm also annoyed and feel wronged.

387
00:22:10,918 --> 00:22:13,298
I wish I could see
the winning lottery numbers

388
00:22:13,378 --> 00:22:16,298
or something grand and movie-like.

389
00:22:16,588 --> 00:22:18,428
All I see are useless
and worthless things.

390
00:22:18,758 --> 00:22:21,258
-What? Worthless?
-Think about it.

391
00:22:21,338 --> 00:22:23,348
It gets me anxious
and causes misunderstanding.

392
00:22:23,718 --> 00:22:25,968
Standing here talking to you like this

393
00:22:26,058 --> 00:22:28,228
is also thanks to my damn ability.

394
00:22:28,308 --> 00:22:29,638
What? Damn?

395
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:33,518
Then what did you see
when you were in my car that night?

396
00:22:36,778 --> 00:22:37,898
(groans in frustration)

397
00:22:37,988 --> 00:22:39,858
Well, I really don't know
about that night.

398
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:44,118
But anyway, I proved it to you.

399
00:22:44,868 --> 00:22:47,578
It's up to you
whether you'll believe me or not.

400
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:01,128
Huh? I'm not in any pain.

401
00:23:04,348 --> 00:23:08,098
(Howoo moans)
Really?

402
00:23:08,978 --> 00:23:13,558
If Seungtaek is happy, Howoo is happy too.

403
00:23:13,648 --> 00:23:15,358
SEUNGTAEK (on phone):
<i>If my Howoo is happy,</i>

404
00:23:15,438 --> 00:23:17,478
that makes me happier.

405
00:23:18,278 --> 00:23:24,448
Huh. But we're going out only for a week
when we're so happy together?

406
00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:26,198
My goodness!

407
00:23:26,278 --> 00:23:28,038
What is it? What happened?

408
00:23:28,118 --> 00:23:30,868
Were we on the phone for 13 hours?

409
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:37,128
Umm, I almost burned my face.

410
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:38,338
SEUNGTAEK (on phone): <i>Oh, no.</i>

411
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:41,718
Oh, my baby shouldn't get a burn.

412
00:23:41,798 --> 00:23:44,428
Should I run over to you right now?
(giggles)

413
00:23:44,678 --> 00:23:46,638
Run over. Come on...

414
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:48,058
(door opens)

415
00:23:50,018 --> 00:23:51,638
SEUNGTAEK (on phone): <i>Hello? Hello?</i>

416
00:23:51,728 --> 00:23:53,308
<i>Howoo, did you fall asleep...</i>

417
00:23:56,858 --> 00:23:58,818
-What's going on?
-Huh?

418
00:23:59,398 --> 00:24:02,028
What? Huh?
Aren't you here to talk about that?

419
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:03,318
Did you do it with Cha Minhu?

420
00:24:04,988 --> 00:24:06,908
(sighs)
We only kissed.

421
00:24:07,528 --> 00:24:08,538
What?

422
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:11,708
You only kissed at a hotel? That's it?

423
00:24:12,538 --> 00:24:14,498
(scoffs)
Are you crazy? Are you still a kid?

424
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,038
How can you possibly stop there?

425
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:18,378
By the way,

426
00:24:19,048 --> 00:24:21,588
was I unable to see the future
if I got drunk?

427
00:24:22,048 --> 00:24:23,878
Gosh, no way.

428
00:24:23,968 --> 00:24:25,548
Don't you remember
what happened with Pilyo?

429
00:24:25,638 --> 00:24:29,178
You said you didn't have the guts,
so you got drunk and kissed him.

430
00:24:29,258 --> 00:24:31,888
Then you bawled,
saying you saw the future.

431
00:24:32,428 --> 00:24:34,558
You were an emotional mess then.

432
00:24:35,478 --> 00:24:36,648
I was.

433
00:24:37,228 --> 00:24:39,818
Being as smart as I am,
I realized it then.

434
00:24:39,898 --> 00:24:41,188
(sighs)

435
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:43,568
"You have to know
when to end a relationship.

436
00:24:44,488 --> 00:24:47,318
Long-term relationships
could get messy like that."

437
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:52,828
So I'm only going out with him for a week.

438
00:24:54,498 --> 00:24:55,328
Huh?

439
00:24:56,038 --> 00:24:57,748
-With whom?
-Don't know.

440
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:01,588
-Huh? Spill it. Who?
-(chuckles)

441
00:25:01,668 --> 00:25:04,338
-I won't tell you.
-Tell me. Spill it. Who is it?

442
00:25:05,508 --> 00:25:06,548
Nope!

443
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:08,718
-Oh-ho?
-(giggles)

444
00:25:28,778 --> 00:25:30,658
(pensive music)

445
00:25:31,948 --> 00:25:36,038
YESOOL: <i>I'm sure it's hard to believe,
but in your room, we really are...</i>

446
00:25:44,838 --> 00:25:49,588
Gosh, so annoying. I revised it 20 times.

447
00:25:49,678 --> 00:25:50,888
(sighs)

448
00:25:50,968 --> 00:25:55,728
I seriously have updated
the file name 20 times.

449
00:25:55,808 --> 00:25:57,558
But he wants to go
for the first one, right?

450
00:25:57,638 --> 00:25:58,978
How did you know?

451
00:25:59,438 --> 00:26:02,818
He asked me to write up more,
saying he wanted to see more variations.

452
00:26:02,938 --> 00:26:04,978
Gosh, I want to put up a barricade
and thrash him.

453
00:26:05,068 --> 00:26:06,188
(soft chuckle)

454
00:26:06,818 --> 00:26:09,238
I think you can reveal
the design just slightly

455
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:12,328
and emphasize the functionality instead.
Look at these references.

456
00:26:12,658 --> 00:26:13,788
(exhales deeply)

457
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:19,958
Yesool, I guess we're really working
with Director Lee Pilyo.

458
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:25,918
I noticed that you two
were standing together

459
00:26:26,008 --> 00:26:27,918
from the pictures
at the anniversary party.

460
00:26:28,008 --> 00:26:29,508
Do you know each other?

461
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:33,258
You do, huh?

462
00:26:33,638 --> 00:26:34,848
Get back to work.

463
00:26:38,478 --> 00:26:39,558
(snickers)

464
00:26:39,888 --> 00:26:40,848
I'm right.

465
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:49,278
I'm sure you had many other offers,

466
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:50,988
but why did you choose us...

467
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:53,488
PILYO: Because you're highly reputable.

468
00:26:53,578 --> 00:26:55,698
I've wanted to work with you.

469
00:26:55,788 --> 00:26:57,408
(chuckles)

470
00:26:57,498 --> 00:26:58,708
And I also have...
(sighs)

471
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:02,288
...personal reasons
that I don't want to regret later.

472
00:27:04,538 --> 00:27:05,748
(exhales)

473
00:27:09,218 --> 00:27:10,718
I've only worked in the film industry,

474
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:13,338
so I'm apprehensive about working
in this unfamiliar field.

475
00:27:13,428 --> 00:27:16,468
Everyone says that I'm a genius
and whatnot.

476
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:18,768
But I'm actually a wimp. Timid too.

477
00:27:18,848 --> 00:27:22,688
(sucks air)
So I think I'll need a manager.

478
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:24,558
A manager?

479
00:27:24,808 --> 00:27:27,398
I thought it'd be good to have someone
to ask questions,

480
00:27:27,478 --> 00:27:29,238
who can help me out.

481
00:27:29,318 --> 00:27:32,028
I was wondering if I could ask
Ms. Hong Yesool to do that for me.

482
00:27:33,158 --> 00:27:35,118
I really liked the Billy commercial.

483
00:27:36,028 --> 00:27:37,118
Hmm.

484
00:27:38,158 --> 00:27:41,958
Ms. Hong will be overseeing
the entire Mopix project.

485
00:27:42,038 --> 00:27:45,878
Please feel free to contact anyone
on Planning Team 1 if you need anything.

486
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:49,668
And if you still need a manager,
I can do that for you.

487
00:27:49,758 --> 00:27:51,128
But you're busy.

488
00:27:51,218 --> 00:27:53,008
I've watched all your interviews.
So I know.

489
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:56,508
You're on your way to becoming ZEU AD's
youngest executive director.

490
00:27:56,928 --> 00:27:58,138
(chuckles awkwardly)

491
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:00,978
I'm inadequate in many ways,
so I'll need a lot of help.

492
00:28:01,058 --> 00:28:02,058
But...

493
00:28:03,388 --> 00:28:04,978
I would never embarrass you

494
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,358
with something that has my name on it.

495
00:28:07,688 --> 00:28:08,728
So don't worry about that.

496
00:28:08,818 --> 00:28:11,568
(dramatic music)

497
00:28:18,078 --> 00:28:21,408
So I ask that we do not mess
with each other's domain,

498
00:28:21,498 --> 00:28:23,708
our own professional domain.

499
00:28:23,788 --> 00:28:25,168
(chuckles)

500
00:28:25,248 --> 00:28:26,998
I hope that applies
to you as well, Director,

501
00:28:27,088 --> 00:28:30,958
the respect you have for our domain.

502
00:28:32,588 --> 00:28:34,298
As you all know,
this is Director Lee Pilyo

503
00:28:34,378 --> 00:28:36,638
who will be working with us
on the Mopix project.

504
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:41,808
-This is Planning Team 1's...
-Mr. Kang Sanggoo.

505
00:28:41,888 --> 00:28:44,058
The coffee commercial
that was a big hit three years ago.

506
00:28:44,138 --> 00:28:45,438
I still remember that.

507
00:28:45,518 --> 00:28:48,108
I switched to that coffee
after watching that commercial.

508
00:28:48,188 --> 00:28:50,228
Oh, thank you.

509
00:28:51,068 --> 00:28:52,108
Ms. Kim Minhee.

510
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:54,488
The recent Fancy ad slogan
that went viral was great.

511
00:28:54,568 --> 00:28:55,658
(soft gasp)

512
00:28:56,358 --> 00:28:59,118
Mr. Kim Roma. I always
enjoy watching your vlogs.

513
00:28:59,198 --> 00:29:01,038
I subscribed to your channel
and clicked "like."

514
00:29:02,948 --> 00:29:03,958
And...

515
00:29:05,158 --> 00:29:07,828
Ms. Hong Yesool.
(sighs)

516
00:29:08,838 --> 00:29:10,628
Do you know the Billy commercial
was the reason

517
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:12,338
I decided to take on this project?

518
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:17,718
And the new V9 about to launch,

519
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:20,848
I'd like to check the shooting location
and take the car for a test drive.

520
00:29:22,178 --> 00:29:23,468
It hasn't been launched yet,

521
00:29:23,558 --> 00:29:25,438
so we must abide by the security
and confidentiality policy.

522
00:29:25,518 --> 00:29:27,848
Launching a new model
is still kept under wraps...

523
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:31,938
As you know, I'm not good
at filming things I don't know about.

524
00:29:32,358 --> 00:29:34,688
You know that I personally
check out places I have to film

525
00:29:34,778 --> 00:29:37,028
and use the products I'll be filming.

526
00:29:44,788 --> 00:29:46,288
I saw one of your interviews.

527
00:29:46,788 --> 00:29:49,828
You had lied down in a coffin
for 15 hours to shoot a short film.

528
00:29:49,918 --> 00:29:50,878
-(chuckles)
-SANGGOO: Oh.

529
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:53,958
Oh, well... isn't there a way?
It's not like this never happened before.

530
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,208
Should I look into it? Huh?

531
00:29:55,758 --> 00:29:58,838
I'm very creative and adventurous.

532
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:01,718
I think I can picture it
if I go to the location myself.

533
00:30:02,388 --> 00:30:03,718
PILYO: Will that be possible?

534
00:30:05,598 --> 00:30:06,978
I'll prepare for that.

535
00:30:13,268 --> 00:30:14,938
PILYO: A handshake. Don't you know?

536
00:30:15,028 --> 00:30:17,528
-(indistinct chatter)
-Let's do a good job.

537
00:30:17,988 --> 00:30:19,448
As a director and staff.

538
00:30:21,118 --> 00:30:23,578
(birds chirping)

539
00:30:28,788 --> 00:30:29,788
(mutters)

540
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:33,208
You asked for a handshake.
Why are you holding my hand?

541
00:30:33,288 --> 00:30:34,958
Why would I shake your hand?

542
00:30:35,048 --> 00:30:36,338
I'd rather hold your hand.

543
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:38,088
No, just let go.

544
00:30:38,468 --> 00:30:40,128
Just walk.

545
00:30:45,848 --> 00:30:47,978
(chuckling)
A handshake. Don't you know?

546
00:30:48,598 --> 00:30:51,438
I said let's do a good job,
Ms. Hong Yesool.

547
00:30:52,438 --> 00:30:54,648
(light music)

548
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:06,288
-(heart beats)
-(pensive music)

549
00:31:10,958 --> 00:31:12,128
(sighs)

550
00:31:16,128 --> 00:31:17,418
(sighs softly)

551
00:31:22,508 --> 00:31:24,548
MINHU: Will you drag
your personal feelings into your work?

552
00:31:27,888 --> 00:31:29,308
I'm not sure what you mean...

553
00:31:30,228 --> 00:31:32,098
Whatever your personal reasons may be,

554
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:35,308
if you let your feelings drag you around
throughout this campaign,

555
00:31:35,398 --> 00:31:36,768
I'll take you out.

556
00:31:37,438 --> 00:31:39,818
Gosh, what do you take me for...

557
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:42,278
I can see that you still have
a lot of feelings for him

558
00:31:42,488 --> 00:31:46,278
enough to throw you off like this
ever since the anniversary party.

559
00:31:46,908 --> 00:31:47,988
No, that's not it.

560
00:31:48,078 --> 00:31:50,118
It's not because I still have a lot
of feelings for him.

561
00:31:50,198 --> 00:31:51,328
Then...

562
00:31:52,418 --> 00:31:54,248
do something about
the sound of your heartbeat.

563
00:31:54,958 --> 00:31:56,088
It's so loud.

564
00:31:56,628 --> 00:31:59,088
(quirky music)

565
00:32:02,298 --> 00:32:03,588
-(door opens)
-He can hear?

566
00:32:04,008 --> 00:32:05,298
(door closes)

567
00:32:05,388 --> 00:32:06,888
What's he talking about?

568
00:32:09,058 --> 00:32:10,018
My goodness.

569
00:32:10,098 --> 00:32:11,058
BIRTH OF ZELUS

570
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:12,138
(sighs)

571
00:32:14,438 --> 00:32:16,688
(slurps)

572
00:32:18,188 --> 00:32:20,188
(somber music)

573
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:29,038
(scoffs)

574
00:32:30,788 --> 00:32:31,828
(sighs deeply)

575
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:34,208
I knew you'd be here.

576
00:32:35,168 --> 00:32:38,168
You always came here
when you were angry and upset.

577
00:32:39,498 --> 00:32:43,508
When you were frustrated,
happy, or excited too.

578
00:32:46,008 --> 00:32:47,548
We always came here together.

579
00:32:51,138 --> 00:32:52,348
(chuckling)
Wow.

580
00:32:52,768 --> 00:32:54,728
I can't believe this is still here.
(laughs)

581
00:32:54,808 --> 00:32:55,978
Did you see this?

582
00:32:56,728 --> 00:32:59,108
I guess we really are successful.

583
00:33:00,688 --> 00:33:03,688
We even get to shoot Hong Yesool's
dream commercial together.

584
00:33:04,898 --> 00:33:06,608
Why did you come here?

585
00:33:07,818 --> 00:33:08,738
Just because.

586
00:33:08,828 --> 00:33:12,288
I came because I missed you.
And here you are.

587
00:33:12,948 --> 00:33:14,038
I'm happy.

588
00:33:15,078 --> 00:33:16,788
It's not like we just broke up yesterday.

589
00:33:17,248 --> 00:33:18,498
I know, right?

590
00:33:18,958 --> 00:33:21,248
But it feels like it was just yesterday.
(chuckles)

591
00:33:21,798 --> 00:33:22,958
Do you feel the same way?

592
00:33:26,008 --> 00:33:27,338
Stop it.

593
00:33:29,138 --> 00:33:30,928
I'm not the same person I was then.

594
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:33,808
You're not the same person
you were then, either.

595
00:33:33,888 --> 00:33:35,598
Come on. Just because I got an award,

596
00:33:35,688 --> 00:33:38,188
it doesn't mean that I'm not the person
you used to know.

597
00:33:38,478 --> 00:33:39,858
(sighs)

598
00:33:42,648 --> 00:33:44,988
I don't know why you chose
to work with ZEU AD.

599
00:33:45,068 --> 00:33:47,698
No, I don't even want to know.

600
00:33:47,778 --> 00:33:50,068
I hope you don't let your
personal feelings and our past

601
00:33:50,158 --> 00:33:51,238
get in the way of our work.

602
00:33:51,328 --> 00:33:52,488
Be professional.

603
00:33:53,238 --> 00:33:55,248
25.73 million won.

604
00:33:59,828 --> 00:34:01,838
The stuff you broke
in my studio apartment.

605
00:34:02,628 --> 00:34:05,008
It roughly came out to be that much.

606
00:34:05,508 --> 00:34:07,968
Jeez, I wish you didn't break Teica MP.

607
00:34:08,048 --> 00:34:10,298
You knew I went through a lot to get it.

608
00:34:10,388 --> 00:34:13,098
Well, you knew.
That's probably why you broke it.

609
00:34:13,178 --> 00:34:14,058
Boy.

610
00:34:14,138 --> 00:34:17,268
How could you destroy
only the things that I treasure?

611
00:34:17,348 --> 00:34:18,558
(chuckling)
That's a skill.

612
00:34:18,638 --> 00:34:20,558
Why are you bringing that up now?

613
00:34:22,608 --> 00:34:26,028
Well, I want to get a new Teica MP,

614
00:34:26,108 --> 00:34:28,068
but I still can't find one.

615
00:34:28,148 --> 00:34:30,028
Man, I should've taken a picture of it.

616
00:34:30,108 --> 00:34:32,738
By chance, are you asking me
to pay for that?

617
00:34:33,828 --> 00:34:34,738
Three dates.

618
00:34:37,618 --> 00:34:39,168
Let's go on just three dates.

619
00:34:40,168 --> 00:34:41,128
What?

620
00:34:41,748 --> 00:34:43,958
I'll forget about the Teica MP.

621
00:34:44,048 --> 00:34:45,918
Just go on three dates with me.

622
00:34:46,008 --> 00:34:48,048
Are you threatening me right now?

623
00:34:48,298 --> 00:34:49,508
No.

624
00:34:50,008 --> 00:34:52,048
I'm clinging to you,
trying to get you back.

625
00:34:53,178 --> 00:34:54,678
Let's go on just three dates.

626
00:34:55,808 --> 00:34:57,428
Between you and me, that much...

627
00:34:59,768 --> 00:35:02,228
You can do that much for me, can't you?

628
00:35:07,028 --> 00:35:08,948
DAEHANRO

629
00:35:09,198 --> 00:35:11,358
HOWOO: We only have four days left,
so let's do as many things

630
00:35:11,448 --> 00:35:12,988
as other couples do in four years, okay?

631
00:35:13,068 --> 00:35:15,278
Howoo, it's not like
our relationship is terminal.

632
00:35:15,368 --> 00:35:17,158
Why do you keep saying
such horrible things?

633
00:35:17,868 --> 00:35:21,038
From here to here.

634
00:35:21,118 --> 00:35:22,498
We'll hit
all the popular date spots, okay?

635
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:24,458
Hey, we can't go to all these places
all at once.

636
00:35:24,538 --> 00:35:25,588
We can do it.

637
00:35:31,048 --> 00:35:32,298
(chuckles awkwardly)

638
00:35:32,928 --> 00:35:34,968
Shall we go shopping first?

639
00:35:35,048 --> 00:35:37,098
Wow, this looks so cool.
(laughs)

640
00:35:37,178 --> 00:35:39,018
(shouts in surprise)
Huh? What? What? What?

641
00:35:39,098 --> 00:35:40,098
Seungtaek, put that back.

642
00:35:41,478 --> 00:35:43,518
How about this one? No, not this one.

643
00:35:43,598 --> 00:35:46,398
-Howoo, I like this one.
-No, that one looks weird, Seungtaek.

644
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:48,648
What do you think? Looks cute, huh?

645
00:35:48,728 --> 00:35:49,898
(chuckling)
I look weird in pink.

646
00:35:49,988 --> 00:35:52,108
Looks nice. It looks good on you.
Let's go.

647
00:35:52,198 --> 00:35:53,028
Gosh.

648
00:35:53,528 --> 00:35:55,278
(sighs)
Whatever.

649
00:35:56,908 --> 00:35:58,538
(Howoo cheers)

650
00:35:58,618 --> 00:36:00,498
-Wow!
-Nice! Yeah!

651
00:36:00,578 --> 00:36:02,498
-What the heck? You said you're bad!
-(cheers)

652
00:36:02,578 --> 00:36:04,328
One, two.

653
00:36:05,078 --> 00:36:06,038
SEUNGTAEK: Go!

654
00:36:06,128 --> 00:36:08,708
(both cheer)

655
00:36:13,508 --> 00:36:14,798
Here.

656
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:16,758
-Say ah.
-Ah.

657
00:36:16,848 --> 00:36:19,218
Ah. Mmm.

658
00:36:20,098 --> 00:36:21,558
-(exclaims)
-How do you like it?

659
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:23,188
-Delicious. It's delicious.
-It is?

660
00:36:23,268 --> 00:36:25,438
(slurps)

661
00:36:25,938 --> 00:36:28,818
-Oh, come on.
-(both laugh)

662
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:31,898
PLAYING BOWLING
FEEDING MY BOYFRIEND

663
00:36:40,748 --> 00:36:41,828

664
00:36:43,458 --> 00:36:44,418
(moans)

665
00:36:48,168 --> 00:36:49,838
-(gasps)
-(both scream)

666
00:36:49,918 --> 00:36:51,668
(man breathes deeply)

667
00:36:51,758 --> 00:36:53,838
Sorry. We're sorry. We're sorry.
What's wrong?

668
00:36:53,918 --> 00:36:55,128
A nightmare. I had a nightmare.

669
00:36:55,218 --> 00:36:56,468
-You had a nightmare?
-Yeah.

670
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:58,008
Chicken feet. And a glass of soju.

671
00:36:58,098 --> 00:36:59,508
-Should we get some?
-Let's go.

672
00:36:59,598 --> 00:37:01,638
-Okay!
-(laughs)

673
00:37:06,018 --> 00:37:07,398
Huh?

674
00:37:10,608 --> 00:37:15,278
<i>♪ I get on the floor ♪</i>

675
00:37:15,738 --> 00:37:18,908

676
00:37:20,528 --> 00:37:25,498
<i>♪ Counting up the years ♪</i>

677
00:37:25,578 --> 00:37:29,128

(groans)

679
00:37:32,128 --> 00:37:33,258
(music fades)

680
00:37:33,708 --> 00:37:35,298
(breathes deeply)

681
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,428
-It's okay.
-Mmm.

682
00:37:38,508 --> 00:37:40,388
(both sigh)

683
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:44,428
Come.

684
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:47,438
Mmm.

685
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:51,978
-It's okay.
-I'm not usually like this.

686
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:55,108
(dog barking in distance)

687
00:37:57,068 --> 00:37:58,278
Here we are.

688
00:37:58,358 --> 00:37:59,618
-Is this your place?
-Yeah.

689
00:38:01,118 --> 00:38:02,328
-(clears throat)
-Give me that.

690
00:38:02,408 --> 00:38:03,328
Huh?

691
00:38:03,658 --> 00:38:04,788
Hmm?

692
00:38:07,788 --> 00:38:08,748
Mmm.

693
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,208
(laughs softly)

694
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:13,338
Bye.

695
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:17,338
Goodness. What are you doing?

696
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:19,088
-(shouts)
-My goodness.

697
00:38:19,178 --> 00:38:21,508
-(shouting continues)
-Seungtaek.

698
00:38:22,298 --> 00:38:24,348
(upbeat music)

699
00:38:26,138 --> 00:38:27,978
Sure. Go in. Bye.

700
00:38:29,898 --> 00:38:31,228
(moans in pain)

701
00:38:37,318 --> 00:38:38,358
(grunts)

702
00:38:41,368 --> 00:38:42,278
(sighs)

703
00:38:43,198 --> 00:38:45,038
-(groans in frustration)
-Seungtaek!

704
00:38:49,498 --> 00:38:52,248
(upbeat tense music)

705
00:38:54,418 --> 00:38:55,458
Come on!

706
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:57,798
(shouts)

707
00:39:01,008 --> 00:39:02,298
(exclaims)

708
00:39:02,638 --> 00:39:04,598
(screams)

709
00:39:07,018 --> 00:39:09,978
Seeing that you're here often lately,
you must've wrapped up a campaign.

710
00:39:10,058 --> 00:39:10,978
Mm-hmm.

711
00:39:11,058 --> 00:39:12,398
Just do one thing at a time.

712
00:39:12,478 --> 00:39:14,518
Who drinks alcohol like coffee
when they work?

713
00:39:14,608 --> 00:39:17,528
I want to drink and don't want
to waste my weekend

714
00:39:17,608 --> 00:39:18,488
but I have to work.

715
00:39:18,568 --> 00:39:20,778
I'm trying to do everything I want to do.
What's wrong with that?

716
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:21,858
Oh, boy.

717
00:39:22,658 --> 00:39:24,198
(inhales deeply)

718
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,618
PILYO: <i>Let's go on just three dates.</i>

719
00:39:29,118 --> 00:39:30,788
Between you and me, that much...

720
00:39:33,668 --> 00:39:36,048
You can do that much for me, can't you?

721
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:39,168
-(dramatic music)
-(keyboard clacking)

722
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:43,138
Do you have feelings for me?

723
00:39:43,218 --> 00:39:45,928
MINHU: <i>Do you have feelings for me?
Do you have feelings for me?</i>

724
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:47,808
(sighs)

725
00:39:48,768 --> 00:39:49,928
MINHU: <i>Do you have feelings for me?</i>

726
00:39:50,018 --> 00:39:51,638
(gasps)

727
00:39:51,728 --> 00:39:53,018
YESOOL: <i>This is a sign.</i>

728
00:39:53,098 --> 00:39:54,858
<i>A sign that things are getting twisted.</i>

729
00:39:55,938 --> 00:39:57,568
<i>Come to your senses, Hong Yesool.</i>

730
00:39:59,648 --> 00:40:02,658
(exclaims)
Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers.

731
00:40:02,738 --> 00:40:04,068
(both laugh)

732
00:40:04,158 --> 00:40:05,988
(slurps)

733
00:40:07,078 --> 00:40:08,158
(both exhale)

734
00:40:08,238 --> 00:40:10,328
Why does beer taste
so good tonight, Jiyoung?

735
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,998
Hey, Jiyoung, do you know this?

736
00:40:12,708 --> 00:40:14,918
I can't stop thinking about her.
I keep missing her.

737
00:40:14,998 --> 00:40:17,838
I miss her even though I see her.
I keep missing her. Again and again!

738
00:40:17,918 --> 00:40:19,588
-(moans in frustration)
-Of course, I do!

739
00:40:20,008 --> 00:40:21,418
You like that person so much

740
00:40:21,508 --> 00:40:22,878
and keep thinking about her
when she's not with you.

741
00:40:22,968 --> 00:40:25,798
(gasps)
And you go nuts worried about the person!

742
00:40:25,888 --> 00:40:28,558
Hey. How come you and I are in sync today?

743
00:40:28,638 --> 00:40:29,638
-(chuckles)
-Huh?

744
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:30,808
Hey, you know this too?

745
00:40:31,308 --> 00:40:32,638
After staying up all night for surgery,

746
00:40:32,728 --> 00:40:34,308
I feel like I'm going to fall over
from exhaustion.

747
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:37,608
But then I run over to her in the morning
to see her for five minutes and come back!

748
00:40:37,688 --> 00:40:39,528
(sighs)
How could I not know that?

749
00:40:39,608 --> 00:40:41,648
I missed him so much
when I was on a shoot overseas

750
00:40:41,738 --> 00:40:43,608
so I canceled everything else
in my schedule.

751
00:40:43,698 --> 00:40:46,818
And here I am right now...

752
00:40:48,408 --> 00:40:49,368
right here.

753
00:40:49,448 --> 00:40:51,868
Hey. Do you know that feeling?

754
00:40:51,948 --> 00:40:53,828
I want to see it to the end

755
00:40:53,908 --> 00:40:57,418
but she has already decided
when things will end.

756
00:40:57,498 --> 00:40:59,128
JIYOUNG: You know that feeling?

757
00:40:59,208 --> 00:41:02,088
He won't open up to me at all.

758
00:41:03,088 --> 00:41:04,928
I can't even start.

759
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:07,298
Do you know that?

760
00:41:07,388 --> 00:41:09,008
I'll change my passcode tonight.

761
00:41:09,098 --> 00:41:10,348
(gasps)

762
00:41:10,428 --> 00:41:12,638
Don't you guys dare come over
to my place again. Damn it.

763
00:41:13,308 --> 00:41:16,598
Hey, hey. Hey, man! That jerk.

764
00:41:16,688 --> 00:41:18,978
I've listened
to so many of your sob stories, man.

765
00:41:19,058 --> 00:41:20,478
Yet you can't even hear me out once?

766
00:41:20,898 --> 00:41:22,528
(moans with fatigue)

767
00:41:23,988 --> 00:41:25,988
(sighs deeply)

768
00:41:27,238 --> 00:41:29,448
Whoa, you're such a jerk.

769
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:31,368
SEUNGTAEK: Hey, pay me for therapy.

770
00:41:31,448 --> 00:41:33,118
-(slurps)
-No money? You have it?

771
00:41:33,198 --> 00:41:36,248
You don't, right?
You won't pay me even if you do, right?

772
00:41:36,328 --> 00:41:37,748
Then I'll just sleep over tonight.

773
00:41:38,038 --> 00:41:39,588
Don't you dare!

774
00:41:39,668 --> 00:41:42,418
(groans)

775
00:41:42,498 --> 00:41:44,418
(pants)
Are you okay?

776
00:41:44,508 --> 00:41:45,968
Are you okay, Seungtaek?

777
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:48,298
Shit.

778
00:41:48,758 --> 00:41:50,218
-(Jiyoung gasps)
-Huh?

779
00:41:51,888 --> 00:41:54,768
Dr. Seungtaek has a nosebleed.

780
00:41:54,848 --> 00:41:57,268
Perhaps you two are going to
beat up on each other and fight?

781
00:41:58,398 --> 00:41:59,228
What?

782
00:42:00,438 --> 00:42:01,608
Huh?

783
00:42:04,358 --> 00:42:06,238
Shit. You!

784
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:08,778
-Come!
-(Jiyoung gasps)

785
00:42:09,488 --> 00:42:10,988
Hey, Seungtaek.

786
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,338
Huh?

787
00:42:31,348 --> 00:42:32,598
(smacks lips)

788
00:42:33,808 --> 00:42:34,808
By the way, Ms. Hong.

789
00:42:35,638 --> 00:42:37,138
What lipstick

790
00:42:37,228 --> 00:42:39,228
do you use? Looks nice.

791
00:42:40,598 --> 00:42:41,518
Huh?

792
00:42:41,608 --> 00:42:42,608
(gasps)

793
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:49,358
MY MOM
VIDEO CALL

794
00:42:50,278 --> 00:42:51,198
(chuckles)

795
00:42:53,448 --> 00:42:55,328
-Mom.
<i>-My daughter.</i>

796
00:42:55,408 --> 00:42:57,708
<i>Congrats on your first project as a PM.</i>

797
00:42:57,788 --> 00:43:00,498
I cried watching the commercial you made.

798
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,418
I'm so proud of you.

799
00:43:02,498 --> 00:43:03,628
<i>Thank you.</i>

800
00:43:05,168 --> 00:43:07,968
<i>By the way, you seem
to have gained some weight.</i>

801
00:43:08,048 --> 00:43:09,468
You must be very happy.

802
00:43:09,548 --> 00:43:12,718
<i>You know Chulyong is a chef.
So it's not like I can refuse his food.</i>

803
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:15,178
(chuckles)
How's the wedding planning going?

804
00:43:15,258 --> 00:43:16,968
You're coming back
after your exhibit, right?

805
00:43:17,468 --> 00:43:19,768
How about you?
Are you seeing anyone or not?

806
00:43:19,848 --> 00:43:23,558
Gosh, come on. Why are you always
asking me that stuff, Mom?

807
00:43:24,228 --> 00:43:26,648
Mom, remember the commercial

808
00:43:27,228 --> 00:43:28,358
Dad made?

809
00:43:29,188 --> 00:43:32,158
I'll be making a commercial
for Mopix this time.

810
00:43:33,278 --> 00:43:34,408
(mumbles)

811
00:43:34,488 --> 00:43:37,448
You must miss your dad, sweetheart.

812
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:40,658
(clicks tongue)
Yeah, I miss him a lot lately.

813
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:44,208
Well, that doesn't mean
I'm not happy for your marriage.

814
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:46,918
SARA:
<i>I see some liquor bottles next to you.</i>

815
00:43:46,998 --> 00:43:48,548
<i>I highly recommend it.</i>

816
00:43:48,628 --> 00:43:51,798
<i>Getting a little buzzed
will help you meet men.</i>

817
00:43:51,878 --> 00:43:55,178
(sighs)
I have a lot to tell you, Mom.

818
00:43:55,508 --> 00:43:58,718
You have no idea how complicated
my life got because of drinks.

819
00:44:00,018 --> 00:44:01,978
(sighs)
That's even more desirable.

820
00:44:02,058 --> 00:44:05,478
Be a little bit tipsy at times.
And fall in love passionately too.

821
00:44:05,808 --> 00:44:07,608
Don't be such a stickler
and work all the time.

822
00:44:07,688 --> 00:44:10,568
Waste your life a little. Okay?

823
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,698
How could a mom say that to a daughter?

824
00:44:12,778 --> 00:44:15,988
<i>So what if you waste it a little bit?
How can you learn without wasting it?</i>

825
00:44:16,068 --> 00:44:18,488
<i>That's how you meet
your true love along the way.</i>

826
00:44:18,948 --> 00:44:20,118
(tuts)
Never mind.

827
00:44:20,748 --> 00:44:22,118
Have you picked out your wedding dress?

828
00:44:22,208 --> 00:44:24,628
I have, but it's a little tight now.

829
00:44:24,708 --> 00:44:26,378
(gasps)
What?

830
00:44:26,788 --> 00:44:29,508
Ah, then you should lose some weight, Mom.

831
00:44:29,588 --> 00:44:31,218
-MAN: Sir.
-Yes.

832
00:44:31,298 --> 00:44:32,168
(chuckles)

833
00:44:33,258 --> 00:44:35,588
(laughs)

834
00:44:35,678 --> 00:44:37,258
SEUNGTAEK: Ouch. Ouch.

835
00:44:37,348 --> 00:44:39,308
Hey, I'm going to tell my honey
about this.

836
00:44:39,388 --> 00:44:41,848
-You're dead. Huh? Jeez.
-(moans in pain)

837
00:44:41,928 --> 00:44:43,388
What? "You're dead"?

838
00:44:43,478 --> 00:44:44,938
How can you speak so harshly.

839
00:44:45,018 --> 00:44:47,058
I'm really going to tell my honey
what you did.

840
00:44:47,148 --> 00:44:49,188
Asshole.
(whimpers)

841
00:44:49,608 --> 00:44:50,728
(smacking lips)

842
00:44:51,528 --> 00:44:52,778
Minhu.

843
00:44:53,448 --> 00:44:56,568
Hong Yesool seems all right.

844
00:44:56,658 --> 00:44:57,908
She's a good AE,

845
00:44:58,778 --> 00:44:59,948
and I like her too.

846
00:45:00,488 --> 00:45:01,658
Oh, yeah?

847
00:45:01,748 --> 00:45:04,498
So did Hong Yesool...

848
00:45:05,668 --> 00:45:06,828
ever come to your place?

849
00:45:10,798 --> 00:45:11,798
Why?

850
00:45:12,338 --> 00:45:14,798
What do you mean, why?

851
00:45:15,128 --> 00:45:16,678
(laughs)

852
00:45:16,758 --> 00:45:18,348
What's with your reaction?

853
00:45:18,428 --> 00:45:20,468
"Why?" doesn't seem like
the right thing to say.

854
00:45:20,558 --> 00:45:22,428
Why would you say, "Why?" Minhu.

855
00:45:22,518 --> 00:45:24,228
"Why? Why?"

856
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:27,598
What do you mean, "Why?"
What kind of question is that?

857
00:45:27,688 --> 00:45:31,188
-Huh? My baby's not picking up.
-"Why?" Whoa...

858
00:45:31,778 --> 00:45:33,238
(Seungtaek groans)

859
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:39,908
HONEY (MY MAN FOR 7 DAYS)

860
00:45:42,288 --> 00:45:44,578
-Do you have a lover?
-(scoffs)

861
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:46,618
"A lover"? You're so old school.

862
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:50,708
(smacking lips)
I enjoyed your movie.

863
00:45:50,788 --> 00:45:52,498
Don't mention it.
(scoffs)

864
00:45:52,588 --> 00:45:53,758
(slurps, smacks lips)

865
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:55,258
But is it okay for me
to see you like this?

866
00:45:55,588 --> 00:45:57,798
Yesool will call me a traitor
if she finds out about this.

867
00:45:58,298 --> 00:46:01,138
Hey, I've put a lot of work into you.
I bought you a lot of drinks too.

868
00:46:01,218 --> 00:46:02,678
I pretty much raised you.
Don't you know that?

869
00:46:02,758 --> 00:46:04,728
I even tutored you,
so you could get into college.

870
00:46:04,808 --> 00:46:06,138
(both scoff)

871
00:46:06,228 --> 00:46:07,558
Pilyo.

872
00:46:07,638 --> 00:46:09,808
-Do you know what my IQ is?
-(sighs)

873
00:46:09,898 --> 00:46:12,978
What tutoring?
You never came out of Yesool's room.

874
00:46:13,068 --> 00:46:14,608
(scoffing)
My goodness.

875
00:46:15,318 --> 00:46:17,698
(signs)
Whatever. Stop talking about the old days.

876
00:46:17,778 --> 00:46:18,658
If Yesool finds out...

877
00:46:18,738 --> 00:46:21,158
Come on. You can't do this to me.

878
00:46:21,238 --> 00:46:22,698
Who's the traitor here?

879
00:46:22,778 --> 00:46:24,078
Who's the traitor?

880
00:46:24,158 --> 00:46:25,998
You helped her ghost me
for crying out loud.

881
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:29,498
Just be glad
that I'm a very understanding person.

882
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:30,918
I'm such a pushover.

883
00:46:31,338 --> 00:46:33,548
I can't believe I'm begging for your help.

884
00:46:34,248 --> 00:46:36,048
(inhales)
You know, Yesool...

885
00:46:36,128 --> 00:46:38,628
Do you know how much she struggled
after you two broke up?

886
00:46:42,098 --> 00:46:43,468
How much did she struggle?

887
00:46:44,638 --> 00:46:46,268
Seriously, she cried every day.

888
00:46:46,848 --> 00:46:49,478
She drank every day
and barely made it to work.

889
00:46:50,598 --> 00:46:51,558
(sighs deeply)

890
00:46:51,648 --> 00:46:53,938
Whenever I think about that time...
Gosh, seriously.

891
00:46:57,028 --> 00:47:00,238
Do you think she'll still cry for me?

892
00:47:03,948 --> 00:47:05,198
(sighs)

893
00:47:06,078 --> 00:47:08,158
You don't even know
why she had to do that.

894
00:47:09,328 --> 00:47:10,578
(inhales deeply)

895
00:47:12,378 --> 00:47:14,038
I came back to find that out.

896
00:47:14,538 --> 00:47:15,628
(sighs deeply)

897
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:18,088
I'm going to hear
her reason going forward.

898
00:47:22,338 --> 00:47:23,888
(slurps)

899
00:47:26,598 --> 00:47:28,598
SITUATION ANALYSIS
MOPIX'S PARTNERS...

900
00:47:33,268 --> 00:47:35,268
(keyboard clacking)

901
00:47:44,118 --> 00:47:45,368
What is it?

902
00:47:45,778 --> 00:47:47,908
Why are you standing there
without saying anything?

903
00:47:48,698 --> 00:47:50,538
(inhales deeply)

904
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:52,918
If you had told...

905
00:47:53,918 --> 00:47:55,708
Pilyo about your secret,

906
00:47:56,208 --> 00:47:57,918
would it have made any difference?

907
00:47:59,798 --> 00:48:01,798
(somber music)

908
00:48:03,298 --> 00:48:04,338
(sighs)

909
00:48:04,428 --> 00:48:05,428
(inhales)

910
00:48:05,508 --> 00:48:08,218
How would it have been different
had I told him?

911
00:48:09,598 --> 00:48:10,768
(sighs deeply)

912
00:48:12,938 --> 00:48:14,938
(somber music)

913
00:48:24,028 --> 00:48:25,158
(sighs)

914
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:32,248
They say they want a young vibe.

915
00:48:32,908 --> 00:48:35,378
Then their design should look young.

916
00:48:36,668 --> 00:48:39,208
(sighs)
What do they want us to do...

917
00:48:39,298 --> 00:48:40,458
(groans)

918
00:48:41,008 --> 00:48:44,258
What if you barely show the design

919
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:47,758
and emphasize the fact
that it's comfortable to wear?

920
00:48:47,848 --> 00:48:49,928
-Make it look sexy and young.
-Goodness.

921
00:48:50,018 --> 00:48:52,638
-(moans in pain)
-That's pretty good.

922
00:48:52,728 --> 00:48:54,518
Learn from her, you guys.

923
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:56,228
(laughs)

924
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:59,108
Gosh, I always appreciate your feedback.

925
00:48:59,188 --> 00:49:02,278
Minhee, can you join our team?

926
00:49:02,818 --> 00:49:04,648
(laughs awkwardly)
That's too...

927
00:49:04,738 --> 00:49:07,448
(chuckles)
"That's too..."

928
00:49:07,528 --> 00:49:11,328
Minhee, Ms. Hong is only
a few years older than you, right?

929
00:49:11,408 --> 00:49:12,498
Yes.

930
00:49:12,578 --> 00:49:15,168
People like you should grow
by leaps and bounds.

931
00:49:15,918 --> 00:49:19,538
You haven't been able to advance
because Cha Minhu only favors Yesool.

932
00:49:19,628 --> 00:49:21,838
It looks like it's been decided
that Yesool will be the PM

933
00:49:21,918 --> 00:49:24,508
on the Mopix project too.

934
00:49:24,588 --> 00:49:27,468
(sighs deeply)

935
00:49:27,548 --> 00:49:28,848
Think about it.

936
00:49:28,928 --> 00:49:32,018
Considering her experience and her rank,

937
00:49:32,098 --> 00:49:35,728
how could Hong Yesool
be the PM every time?

938
00:49:35,808 --> 00:49:38,228
-(banging on table)
-How? Every time?

939
00:49:39,018 --> 00:49:40,148
(sighs)

940
00:49:40,438 --> 00:49:42,818
That's why you need connections.

941
00:49:42,898 --> 00:49:45,698
You guys too.
If not, you'll end up like me.

942
00:49:47,908 --> 00:49:51,788
It looks like you
especially despise Ms. Hong.

943
00:49:52,828 --> 00:49:54,578
That's because she abandoned me.

944
00:49:55,208 --> 00:49:56,208
Excuse me?

945
00:49:56,288 --> 00:49:58,168
She left running
when Cha Minhu called for her.

946
00:49:58,668 --> 00:50:00,918
I really adored her.

947
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:02,668
(whispers)
What do you mean?

948
00:50:02,748 --> 00:50:04,628
(sighs)
Never mind that.

949
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:08,428
From what I saw at the party,

950
00:50:09,088 --> 00:50:12,258
I think something's up
between Lee Pilyo and Hong Yesool.

951
00:50:12,348 --> 00:50:13,678
Do you know anything?

952
00:50:14,268 --> 00:50:16,178
I don't know either.

953
00:50:16,268 --> 00:50:20,268
I just know they took the new car
for a test drive today.

954
00:50:20,728 --> 00:50:22,608
-That's all I know.
-Just the two of them?

955
00:50:22,688 --> 00:50:24,568
CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT

956
00:50:25,778 --> 00:50:27,318
Here you go.
(exhales deeply)

957
00:50:27,778 --> 00:50:30,068
I even had to see our legal team
to get approval for this.

958
00:50:30,488 --> 00:50:32,328
We'll be in huge trouble
if anything goes wrong.

959
00:50:32,408 --> 00:50:34,288
Okay, I'll keep that in mind.

960
00:50:36,288 --> 00:50:37,828
I UNDERSTAND THE STATEMENT ABOVE
AND THEREFORE SIGN HERE

961
00:50:37,908 --> 00:50:38,868
(sighs)

962
00:50:46,208 --> 00:50:47,378
Okay.
(grunts)

963
00:50:53,758 --> 00:50:54,928
Shall we go?

964
00:50:56,518 --> 00:50:57,678
(sighs)

965
00:51:04,018 --> 00:51:09,358
MOPIX independently developed
Dynamic Damper Control for this new model.

966
00:51:09,738 --> 00:51:13,028
This car operates in different modes.
Comfort mode for city driving,

967
00:51:13,118 --> 00:51:15,408
off-road mode for off-road driving,
and sports mode on highways.

968
00:51:15,488 --> 00:51:18,538
Oh, then we should test
how it operates in those modes.

969
00:51:18,618 --> 00:51:20,578
As I said the other day,

970
00:51:20,668 --> 00:51:23,208
maintaining confidentiality
is paramount for this project.

971
00:51:23,288 --> 00:51:24,128
(sighs)

972
00:51:24,208 --> 00:51:25,588
Please do not remove the cover

973
00:51:25,668 --> 00:51:28,128
or take pictures
with an unsecured phone...

974
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:29,258
Please get in the car.

975
00:51:34,638 --> 00:51:35,928
(sighs)

976
00:51:38,478 --> 00:51:40,728
(exhales)
Just sit in the front.

977
00:51:41,688 --> 00:51:43,898
I'm sorry. I get terrible car sickness.

978
00:51:43,978 --> 00:51:46,398
I get carsick if I sit in the front seat.

979
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:47,858
PILYO'S PLAYLIST

980
00:51:48,148 --> 00:51:49,648
You used to like this singer's songs.

981
00:51:49,948 --> 00:51:51,608
No, I only listen to pansori.

982
00:51:53,778 --> 00:51:55,578
You used to like this chocolate a lot.

983
00:51:55,658 --> 00:51:57,488
I went to the store
near our school to buy it.

984
00:51:57,578 --> 00:52:00,118
No. I don't eat chocolates.

985
00:52:01,408 --> 00:52:03,538
But wait, are we going on a picnic
or something?

986
00:52:03,628 --> 00:52:06,498
Boy, we didn't have anything back then
and couldn't afford a car.

987
00:52:06,588 --> 00:52:08,548
So all we did was walk
around holding hands.

988
00:52:08,628 --> 00:52:10,218
(snorts)

989
00:52:15,718 --> 00:52:17,468
I think I'll have to drive.

990
00:52:17,558 --> 00:52:19,888
The confidentiality policy
is very strict this time.

991
00:52:19,978 --> 00:52:22,688
My job is to prevent anything unexpected
from happening.

992
00:52:23,308 --> 00:52:28,528
Since you're so creative and adventurous,
I'll have to support you as a manager.

993
00:52:29,818 --> 00:52:31,068
(sighs)

994
00:52:31,988 --> 00:52:34,278
(upbeat music)

995
00:52:45,788 --> 00:52:47,088
(clears throat)

996
00:52:52,258 --> 00:52:53,548
(Minhu clears throat)

997
00:52:55,548 --> 00:52:58,678
Ms. Hong. How is your car sickness?

998
00:53:01,558 --> 00:53:03,978
You drive quite aggressively.

999
00:53:04,978 --> 00:53:08,228
I think I should drive myself
to get some great ideas.

1000
00:53:08,608 --> 00:53:10,898
I haven't gotten into a car accident
in the last 10 years.

1001
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,318
Where are you going?

1002
00:53:17,028 --> 00:53:19,738
As you know, I'm creative and adventurous.

1003
00:53:20,908 --> 00:53:23,038
You'll see when we get there.

1004
00:53:23,708 --> 00:53:24,958
(sighs)

1005
00:53:26,918 --> 00:53:28,708
(upbeat music)

1006
00:53:54,488 --> 00:53:56,318
(tires screech)

1007
00:54:18,638 --> 00:54:20,928
(tires screech)

1008
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:30,858
(music fades)

1009
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:37,358
(wind blowing)

1010
00:54:37,448 --> 00:54:39,448
(pensive music)

1011
00:54:42,328 --> 00:54:43,328
This is it.

1012
00:54:45,368 --> 00:54:46,698
I saw this.

1013
00:54:47,458 --> 00:54:49,458
You and me...

1014
00:54:50,128 --> 00:54:52,378
Are we in another country? Is it a desert?

1015
00:54:52,668 --> 00:54:54,798
I don't know where we are.

1016
00:54:55,548 --> 00:54:58,048
Is it dust or sand?

1017
00:54:58,468 --> 00:55:00,758
You see the dust?

1018
00:55:01,428 --> 00:55:03,348
It's exactly how I described it.

1019
00:55:03,638 --> 00:55:05,848
I told you
I saw us standing here like this.

1020
00:55:06,268 --> 00:55:08,228
It's exactly what I had said.

1021
00:55:11,438 --> 00:55:13,608
(cell phone vibrates)

1022
00:55:15,858 --> 00:55:16,858
Yes.

1023
00:55:18,358 --> 00:55:19,648
Just a moment, please.

1024
00:55:20,488 --> 00:55:21,358
Unbelievable.

1025
00:55:28,788 --> 00:55:29,998
What's he doing?

1026
00:55:32,788 --> 00:55:34,128
What do you think you're doing?

1027
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,498
I told you, you can't do this!

1028
00:55:36,588 --> 00:55:39,548
Come on, just 10 shots. No one comes here.
They won't get leaked.

1029
00:55:39,628 --> 00:55:40,838
How can you be so sure?

1030
00:55:41,128 --> 00:55:44,178
If the new design leaks out,
all hell will break loose.

1031
00:55:44,798 --> 00:55:45,888
(chuckles)

1032
00:55:46,558 --> 00:55:47,928
-(gasps)
-(camera shutter clicks)

1033
00:55:50,768 --> 00:55:51,768
(sighs)

1034
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:53,398
What are you doing?

1035
00:55:53,648 --> 00:55:55,188
I just came up with an idea.

1036
00:55:56,148 --> 00:55:57,358
(sighs)

1037
00:55:58,988 --> 00:56:01,988
(camera shutter clicks)

1038
00:56:02,738 --> 00:56:04,778
(light music)

1039
00:56:23,798 --> 00:56:26,048
(in English)
Okay, you guys are perfect.

1040
00:56:26,138 --> 00:56:28,428
Scene 1, take 5, let's roll!

1041
00:56:29,678 --> 00:56:31,308
You look so cool.

1042
00:56:32,478 --> 00:56:34,688
(light music)

1043
00:56:43,698 --> 00:56:44,778
Cool, huh?

1044
00:56:45,988 --> 00:56:46,988
Yeah, cool.

1045
00:56:52,288 --> 00:56:56,748
This is how cool the new model V9
from Mopix is.

1046
00:56:57,248 --> 00:56:59,668
It drives very dynamically and is sporty.

1047
00:56:59,748 --> 00:57:02,628
With a sexy design emphasizing
the lower part of the car,

1048
00:57:02,718 --> 00:57:06,548
its locking differential
and ELSD are fabulous,

1049
00:57:06,638 --> 00:57:09,258
-and goes from 0 to 60 mph in 3.9 seconds.
-(scoffs)

1050
00:57:09,348 --> 00:57:12,978
So please make sure to highlight
these great functions and design.

1051
00:57:13,808 --> 00:57:15,558
Yes, Ms. Hong.

1052
00:57:22,608 --> 00:57:24,858
I'll make sure to do it perfectly.

1053
00:57:25,568 --> 00:57:26,858
Hi, Dr. Oh.

1054
00:57:27,318 --> 00:57:28,368
I'm fine now.

1055
00:57:28,448 --> 00:57:29,828
I'm not showing any symptoms.

1056
00:57:30,578 --> 00:57:32,618
I'll tell you the details when I see you.

1057
00:57:32,698 --> 00:57:35,248
I want to ask you something
about that day too.

1058
00:57:37,328 --> 00:57:38,248
PILYO: Be careful.

1059
00:57:39,378 --> 00:57:40,998
-Bye.
-(phone beeps)

1060
00:57:47,178 --> 00:57:49,298
PILYO: When will you keep your promise,
by the way?

1061
00:57:50,928 --> 00:57:52,348
You said you'd accept...

1062
00:57:53,518 --> 00:57:54,888
my proposal if I win the award.

1063
00:57:55,558 --> 00:57:56,728
Don't you remember?

1064
00:57:57,228 --> 00:58:00,898
PALME D'OR, HOLLYWOOD!
I'LL ACHIEVE ALL OF THEM!

1065
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:05,738
Propose to me if you win the award.

1066
00:58:06,358 --> 00:58:07,568
With a ring.

1067
00:58:07,658 --> 00:58:08,868
Do you really mean that?

1068
00:58:09,568 --> 00:58:11,658
-Then I'm really going to win the award.
-Sure, win it.

1069
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:14,658
-I'll get one from Hollywood.
-Sure, I said go ahead.

1070
00:58:14,748 --> 00:58:17,538
-(screams)
-I'm going to go to Cannes!

1071
00:58:17,618 --> 00:58:18,538
Go!

1072
00:58:18,628 --> 00:58:20,248
Wait for me, Cannes!
(laughs)

1073
00:58:20,338 --> 00:58:21,628
YESOOL: <i>Let's go!</i>

1074
00:58:21,958 --> 00:58:24,208
(light music)

1075
00:58:27,048 --> 00:58:29,258
I always carry the ring with me.

1076
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:32,508
Why are you doing this?

1077
00:58:32,598 --> 00:58:34,718
Did you forget how we broke up?

1078
00:58:35,308 --> 00:58:36,178
Yeah.

1079
00:58:36,848 --> 00:58:37,938
I forgot.

1080
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:41,268
I only thought about
how we can get back together.

1081
00:58:45,528 --> 00:58:47,108
The thought of coming to get you.

1082
00:58:47,198 --> 00:58:49,488
And the thought
of never making you cry again.

1083
00:58:49,948 --> 00:58:51,618
That's what kept me going.

1084
00:58:56,868 --> 00:58:58,158
So I'm back...

1085
00:58:59,998 --> 00:59:01,208
not just to date you.

1086
00:59:02,088 --> 00:59:03,798
I'm here to marry you.

1087
00:59:06,208 --> 00:59:07,548
What a crazy nut.

1088
00:59:08,418 --> 00:59:09,798
(soft chuckle)
So I'm saying...

1089
00:59:10,968 --> 00:59:13,298
just go on three dates
with this crazy nut.

1090
00:59:16,558 --> 00:59:17,728
PILYO: As for this...

1091
00:59:19,268 --> 00:59:21,808
I plan to carry it with me
until you accept my proposal.

1092
00:59:26,568 --> 00:59:27,688
(gasps)

1093
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:33,528
(Yesool groans)

1094
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:36,118
Are you okay, Yesool?

1095
00:59:42,578 --> 00:59:45,208
(mellow music)

1096
01:00:06,688 --> 01:00:08,688
The car got dirty, but there is no damage.

1097
01:00:08,778 --> 01:00:09,648
Okay.

1098
01:00:10,028 --> 01:00:11,448
-Should I sign here?
-Yes.

1099
01:00:12,068 --> 01:00:13,238
CONFIRMATION

1100
01:00:14,988 --> 01:00:17,078
-Here's the key.
-Okay.

1101
01:00:19,038 --> 01:00:20,038
(sighs)

1102
01:00:20,118 --> 01:00:22,458
Let's go eat.
I made a reservation at a restaurant.

1103
01:00:22,538 --> 01:00:24,168
You've been wanting to go there.

1104
01:00:24,248 --> 01:00:25,538
Excuse me, Director Lee Pilyo.

1105
01:00:25,628 --> 01:00:27,458
We broke up three years ago.

1106
01:00:27,998 --> 01:00:31,258
I'm not the same Hong Yesool who used
to pester you, wanting to go places.

1107
01:00:32,088 --> 01:00:33,088
Right now, I'm...

1108
01:00:33,178 --> 01:00:36,138
You're still the same Hong Yesool,
from back then and even now.

1109
01:00:36,218 --> 01:00:37,308
Am I wrong?

1110
01:00:37,928 --> 01:00:39,058
(sighs)

1111
01:00:39,558 --> 01:00:43,268
Hong Yesool will go with me
in order to pull her proposal together.

1112
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:44,348
All right then.

1113
01:00:45,148 --> 01:00:46,058
Let's go.

1114
01:00:50,568 --> 01:00:51,898
(sighs)

1115
01:00:58,238 --> 01:00:59,618
(sighs deeply)

1116
01:01:07,708 --> 01:01:10,088
(light music)

1117
01:01:18,928 --> 01:01:20,218
(gasps)

1118
01:01:25,728 --> 01:01:26,768
(Yesool groans)

1119
01:01:35,608 --> 01:01:37,698
(pensive music)

1120
01:01:44,788 --> 01:01:47,958
I trip over something, and you hold me.

1121
01:01:48,208 --> 01:01:50,708
And because of that, your cellphone screen

1122
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:52,258
cracks.

1123
01:01:53,258 --> 01:01:54,418
(sighs)

1124
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:56,298
(exhales deeply)

1125
01:02:26,538 --> 01:02:28,078
-Hong Yesool.
-Mr. Cha.

1126
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:30,498
(sighs softly)

1127
01:02:32,378 --> 01:02:34,838
I think I should hear about that day.

1128
01:02:36,168 --> 01:02:37,258
What you saw...

1129
01:02:37,338 --> 01:02:38,968
I believe you now.

1130
01:02:40,388 --> 01:02:42,638
Our future that you saw.

1131
01:02:44,018 --> 01:02:45,058
So, tell me.

1132
01:02:45,138 --> 01:02:47,768
(gentle music)

1133
01:02:51,688 --> 01:02:53,768
We kiss each other...

1134
01:02:54,898 --> 01:02:56,438
and go into your apartment.

1135
01:02:58,448 --> 01:03:03,238
I mean, in your bedroom, we will...

1136
01:03:04,198 --> 01:03:07,368
Your bed sheets, the walls,
your comforter in your bedroom.

1137
01:03:08,118 --> 01:03:10,828
I even remember the lamp
stand next to your bed clearly.

1138
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:15,588
You saw that all the future events
that I saw came to be, right?

1139
01:03:16,298 --> 01:03:18,338
We'll keep getting involved like that.

1140
01:03:19,628 --> 01:03:22,138
Of course, you don't like
getting involved with me.

1141
01:03:22,218 --> 01:03:23,968
-So...
-I never said I don't like it.

1142
01:03:26,218 --> 01:03:29,058
Come on, don't play around.

1143
01:03:29,518 --> 01:03:31,308
I really feel like I'm dying.

1144
01:03:32,648 --> 01:03:34,268
I really like our company

1145
01:03:34,358 --> 01:03:37,358
and want to focus on work without
any personal feelings getting in the way.

1146
01:03:38,278 --> 01:03:41,528
At this rate, never mind work.
I don't think I can do anything.

1147
01:03:43,068 --> 01:03:44,528
-So let's just...
-All right.

1148
01:03:46,158 --> 01:03:47,538
(sighs)
Let's do it.

1149
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:49,828
Pardon?

1150
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:51,748
Let's do it.

1151
01:03:57,208 --> 01:03:59,508
YESOOL: <i>I've thought of this before.</i>

1152
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:01,678
Tonight is good.

1153
01:04:03,928 --> 01:04:06,928
<i>"Was this bound to happen?</i>

1154
01:04:07,638 --> 01:04:09,638
<i>Or did I make it happen?"</i>

1155
01:04:11,228 --> 01:04:13,938
But I have one condition.

1156
01:04:14,938 --> 01:04:17,108
(gentle music)

1157
01:04:28,998 --> 01:04:30,998
(gentle music continues)
