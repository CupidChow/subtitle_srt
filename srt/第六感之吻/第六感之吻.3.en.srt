1
00:00:03,461 --> 00:00:04,751
(breathes deeply)

2
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:10,968
(dramatic music builds)

3
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:13,345
YESOOL: <i>Just once.</i>

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,890
<i>I just want to check one more time.</i>

5
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:17,984
(dramatic music)

6
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:48,472
(theme music)

7
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:31,472
BIRTH OF ZELUS

8
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:41,269
What are you doing?

9
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:44,193
(smooching)

10
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,567
EPISODE 3

11
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,399
What are you trying to do to me right now?

12
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:59,115
Oh, you were drenched

13
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:03,332
and looked pale,
so I was trying to see if you were okay.

14
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,536
In any case, I brought you some water.

15
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,285
I think you should eat porridge
or something before you take medicine.

16
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,628
Should I get you some food?

17
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,222
I guess that'd make you feel
more uncomfortable.

18
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,220
I'm sure you would prefer me
to leave, right?

19
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,813
(inhales)
Anyway, thank you so much for today.

20
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:22,019
I'll get going then.

21
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,100
(upbeat music)

22
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,067
My purse.

23
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,909
(upbeat music continues)

24
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,258
Cha Minhu and me?

25
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,352
So that's how it's going to be, huh?

26
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,515
SEUNGTAEK (on phone):
<i>Why did you even bother?</i>

27
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,691
What?

28
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,099
Jeez, you're pissing me off again.

29
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,688
Hey, you were woozy

30
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,733
and I was working
so I couldn't take you home.

31
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:15,947
You hate being hospitalized.
What could I do? What? What could I do?

32
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,029
(sighs)

33
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,203
SEUNGTAEK: <i>Hey.</i>

34
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,371
Wasn't Yesool appalled
when she saw your place?

35
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,990
Man, I'm shocked every time I go there.

36
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:25,117
SEUNGTAEK (on phone): <i>You know?</i>
(chuckles)

37
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:28,625
I just asked her to give you the medicine.

38
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,292
Did something happen?

39
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,496
<i>-Huh?</i>
-I'm hanging up.

40
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,691
(sighs deeply)

41
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,479
Oh, my god. This is totally unexpected.

42
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,267
HOWOO: I can't believe I was totally off.

43
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:56,108
-Cha Minhu and you?
-I know.

44
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:59,784
How do I get myself to go that far
with Cha Minhu?

45
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:02,156
Why? When? How?

46
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,202
What leads up to that?
What makes us do it?

47
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:07,285
(groans in frustration)
Why did I do that?

48
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,535
What? What? What is it this time?

49
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:13,094
I mean, I was horrified by the thought
of sleeping with Cha Minhu.

50
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:15,129
So I tried to foresee again

51
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:17,673
-but he opened his eyes.
-(gasps)

52
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:18,927
Damn it.

53
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:21,008
What if he thinks I'm interested in him?

54
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,554
-(bottle clanks)
-Yesool.

55
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,886
-Just sleep with him.
-What?

56
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,433
Just do it. Okay?

57
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,056
What you foresaw always came to pass.

58
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,522
You said you saw his scar
and where you'll sleep with him too.

59
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,060
(sighs)

60
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:34,654
Don't you remember that time?

61
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:37,112
You just wanted to see the future
one more time,

62
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,203
and you ended up
becoming an emotional mess!

63
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,659
Why are you bringing that up again?

64
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,491
(Haejin tuts)

65
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,449
-Well...
-When you two get together,

66
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:48,706
all you ever talk about is Cha Minhu.

67
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,418
So, you're dating Cha Minhu?

68
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,208
-(clears throat)
-No, I'm not.

69
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,712
Jeez, you were talking crap
about him every time you were here.

70
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,804
I knew this would happen.
Hatred stems out of affection.

71
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,432
So when will you go out with him?

72
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:03,928
(sighs)
Haejin! Didn't I tell you?

73
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,559
I messed up my own life
and how it turned out.

74
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,932
-Are you talking about Lee Pilyo?
-No!

75
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,688
-Well, that's...
-(sighs softly)

76
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,100
I mean...

77
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,650
What? Did you tell him
all about Pilyo too?

78
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:20,607
Whoa, Yesool, don't drink
with just anybody.

79
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,735
You tell everyone everything. Jeez.

80
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,155
(hair dryer buzzing)

81
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,576
(sighs)

82
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,208
(clicks)

83
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,471
Just sleep with him once and end it.

84
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,551
It's not like you'll be in a relationship
for sleeping with him.

85
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,062
Right?

86
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:50,138
Like kissing once doesn't always lead
to a relationship.

87
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,734
Exactly.

88
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:56,193
You can't do anything about the future
and Cha Minhu could care less.

89
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:59,032
Will you be the only one
stressing out over it?

90
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,784
(hair dryer buzzing)

91
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:11,118
(cars honking)

92
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,382
(beeps)

93
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,256
-(beeps)
-(whirs)

94
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,684
Oh! Hold it!

95
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:32,024
(quirky music)

96
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:34,730
AUTOMATIC OPERATION

97
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:35,851
(Minhu sighs)

98
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,481
YESOOL: <i>Damn it.</i>

99
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,895
<i>Why did I have to run into him?</i>

100
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:45,147
<i>What should I say?</i>

101
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,569
Are you feeling better?

102
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:53,504
It was so crazy yesterday,
so I didn't get to thank you.

103
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:56,496
Thank you so much

104
00:06:56,582 --> 00:07:00,802
-for saving me at the pop-up store...
-What are the KPIs you expect?

105
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,879
And what about ROAS?

106
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:06,381
Based on the sales after the release
of the commercial

107
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,087
and the pop-up store event,

108
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:12,927
the KPIs are expected to increase
by 140 percent compared to last month.

109
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:16,436
We expect the ROAS
to increase accordingly...

110
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,649
How about ROI?

111
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,978
Labor and materials costs
for the pop-up store were high

112
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:24,486
so we'll have to see the sales data,

113
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,609
but it should be fine
with the sales on the rise.

114
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,119
(sighs)

115
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,655
YESOOL: <i>How come he doesn't ask me
about last night?</i>

116
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,122
MINHU: Hong Yesool.

117
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,580
Yes?

118
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,337
You were amazing.

119
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,625
If you mean about last night...

120
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:46,665
(door opens)

121
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:49,177
(quirky music)

122
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,063
Shit, this is driving me crazy.

123
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,020
(Eomji gasps)
Oh, my goodness.

124
00:07:58,102 --> 00:07:59,232
(gasps)

125
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,902
Oh, my goodness.

126
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,939
Yesool, you look so pretty in the picture.

127
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,645
Gosh, I'm so jealous.

128
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,446
EOMJI: Again.

129
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:11,739
(rapping)
<i>♪ Again, I got all dressed up for once ♪</i>

130
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,704
<i>♪ They never hang a big picture
of me like that ♪</i>

131
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,124
<i>♪ Even if I get dolled up every day ♪</i>

132
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,953
<i>♪ They never hang a big picture
of me like that ♪</i>

133
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,958
<i>♪ Again. How was my rap?
Oh, yeah, my friend ♪</i>

134
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,001
-(in English) Good job.
-Oh, yeah. Thank you.

135
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:23,174
(sighs)

136
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:24,632
(indistinct chatter)

137
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:27,472
Your former subordinates,
Cha Minhu and Hong Yesool.

138
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,178
Why are they all over the place?

139
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,378
(sighs)

140
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,468
SANGGOO: Hey, guys. I'm here too.

141
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,103
I'm on Planning Team 1 too.

142
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,479
Oh, here's our
ultimate optimistic colleague.

143
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,559
Aren't you as insignificant
as dust on Planning Team 1?

144
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:42,556
(scoffs)

145
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,477
Have some self-respect, you know.

146
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:45,605
(inhales deeply)

147
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,277
They give me so many bonuses
just for breathing.

148
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,741
Who cares about self-respect?

149
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,319
Oh.

150
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:54,525
Didn't you see our team receive
a special cash bonus

151
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,157
from our vice-president this morning?

152
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,504
Cash bonus?

153
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,708
Hey, just your team?

154
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,251
Some people might think you deserved it.

155
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,127
I'm part of the team. We're a team.

156
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,250
When my team excels,
it means I'm doing a good job.

157
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,917
-(indistinct chatter in distance)
-It's only a matter of time

158
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:11,006
before Hong Yesool surpasses you.

159
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,642
Aren't you humiliated?

160
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,178
No, I'm not.

161
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:18,854
At some point, I told myself
that I'd be a doormat for our company.

162
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,443
Please tread on me and pass right by me.

163
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,939
Hey, figure out if you want
to be trodden or jumped over.

164
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:26,691
So... are you really starting
the Mopix campaign?

165
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:28,574
Oh, that?
(flicks tongue)

166
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:29,531
Which production team are they going with?

167
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,530
That?
(flicks tongue)

168
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:31,821
-What the hell?
-That stupid tongue.

169
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,454
You know what?
(flicks tongue)

170
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,371
-Jeez.
-I should just pull his tongue out.

171
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:36,489
-(flicks tongue)
-Hey.

172
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,616
Hey, hey.

173
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,252
-SANGGOO: Oh.
-Oh, there he is.

174
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,580
EOMJI: Wow.

175
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,129
-SANGGOO: Hey, hey. I have to go.
-EOMJI: He's asking for you.

176
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,128
KYUNGSEOK: Hey, which production team...

177
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,460
(sighs)
He's moving up fast.

178
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,716
(sighing)
Look at him chase after him.

179
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:53,218
Are they Cha Minhu's posse or what? Jeez.

180
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,301
(cheerful music)

181
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,506
The beds for display were all sold out.

182
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,557
The premium product sales went up by 180%.

183
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,480
It's all thanks to you believing in us.

184
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,515
A bed commercial without a bed.

185
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,856
To be honest,
I was a little confused at first.

186
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,991
But look how we’re rewarded for it.

187
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:13,028
The storefront, the press,
and social media.

188
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,032
They're all going crazy.
But look how we're rewarded for it.

189
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:18,333
The pop-up store and Oh Jiyoung's
goods event were excellent too.

190
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,832
You're something else, Mr. Cha.

191
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:24,372
Ms. Hong was the lead on this project

192
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,037
and I only watched from afar.

193
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:27,594
MANAGER: Really?

194
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:32,174
I'd better get on your good side
from now on, Ms. Hong.

195
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,177
(chuckles)

196
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:36,218
And other team members
who trusted Ms. Hong

197
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,352
and followed her lead
took a big part in it as well.

198
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:43,682
(cheerful music continues)

199
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,520
A bed, a mattress, or a sofa.

200
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:49,475
Just name it.

201
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,275
We'll send one

202
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:52,942
to everyone on Planning Team 1.

203
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,067
Yay! Oops.

204
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:56,659
Bye.

205
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,235
(all cheer)

206
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,075
SANGGOO: I want all three of them.

207
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,500
Me too.
(laughs)

208
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,123
This is Mr. Cha's treat.

209
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,957
For all your hard work.

210
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,126
(cheers)

211
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,551
-EOMJI: Don't clap.
-SANGGOO: Oh, okay.

212
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,459
-EOMJI: Let's eat.
-ROMA: Wow.

213
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:16,047
I've only seen this place on social media.

214
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,680
I know. You have to make reservations
two months in advance to eat here.

215
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:21,933
(Minhee exclaims)

216
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:25,097
SANGGOO:
He must've known it two months ago.

217
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:27,561
That our PM would pull it off.

218
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:30,765
Two months.
He must've known it two months ago. Wow.

219
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:34,027
(laughs)
He's extraordinary. Way above the rest.

220
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,950
(sighs)
I wish I could be on his team forever.

221
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,950
You saw earlier, right?
He gave us all the credit.

222
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,583
He's hardcore when it comes to working,

223
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,910
but he goes all out
rewarding us afterward. Right?

224
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,211
After making us work late
for ten days straight, right?

225
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:49,379
But he treats you big time like this. Bam.

226
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,128
Yeom Kyungseok, that ass.

227
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,380
You know, tteokbokki?

228
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:54,131
-That's all he orders in for us. Damn it.
-(chuckles)

229
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,837
Can I be honest with you?

230
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:59,592
I seriously want to join Planning Team 1.
It's a secret.

231
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,677
-I'd say we're part of Planning Team 1.
-Right?

232
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,012
(laughs)

233
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:10,604
Ms. Hong. Why are you so quiet today?

234
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:11,768
Oh.

235
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:13,895
EOMJI: I know.

236
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:17,322
Hong Yesool is not chiming in on Mr. Cha.

237
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,911
-(chuckles awkwardly)
-SANGGOO: Ms. Hong.

238
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,237
What happened yesterday?

239
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:27,117
Did you take Mr. Cha home
from the hospital?

240
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:30,004
Oh, yes. I drove him home.

241
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,962
-I see.
-(laughs softly)

242
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,132
MINHEE: How is it?

243
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:36,051
Such a mysterious place. I'm so curious.

244
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:39,050
-(Eomji crunching)
-Well, it wasn't...

245
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,260
all that ordinary, but...

246
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,394
How does it look?

247
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,508
It's all the same, you know.
(inhales)

248
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,308
I was so out of it
since I just put him to bed...

249
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,441
ALL: Put him to bed?

250
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,649
MINHEE (whispers): What?

251
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:54,016
Well...

252
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,566
-He was out, so what else would I do?
-(both gasps)

253
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,240
ALL: He was out?

254
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,279
(Eomji blows raspberry)

255
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,741
And? What happened next? Huh?

256
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,870
I can't listen to this with a clear head.
Let's drink first.

257
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:06,953
Okay, go on.

258
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,254
Mm. Oh.
(munching)

259
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,632
Are you feeling better, Mr. Cha?

260
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,669
I heard there was an accident
at the pop-up store.

261
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,343
(chuckles)
I'm fine.

262
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,881
(inhales deeply)
Billy was an amazing success.

263
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,585
Mr. Cha, you never disappoint.

264
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,756
The PM of that project
was Ms. Hong Yesool, not me.

265
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:27,175
VICE PRESIDENT: Hmm. Ms. Hong Yesool?

266
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:31,524
Hmm. Then are you working with her
on the Mopix project as well?

267
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:32,942
(Sunhee chuckles)

268
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,730
For Ms. Hong's first project as a PM,

269
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:39,435
everyone knows
how much Mr. Cha helped out.

270
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,397
-(Sunhee laughs softly)
-(clears throat)

271
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,696
You know, Mr. Cha pretty much carries
Planning Team 1 himself.

272
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:46,161
-(both laugh)
-KYUNGSEOK: That's right.

273
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,656
So why aren't other chiefs
pulling their weight in their teams?

274
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,205
(both coughs in bewilderment)

275
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,672
Ms. Jo Sunhee, didn't Mr. Cha
work under you before?

276
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,002
(laughs awkwardly)
Yes.

277
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,207
(clears throat)
I was his mentor.

278
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,933
Mm. At this rate, I think

279
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:07,048
he's going to be
the youngest executive director.

280
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,886
-Then what happens to the hierarchy?
-(manager chuckles awkwardly)

281
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,524
His seniors are all still ahead of him.
That's too...

282
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,771
-(chuckles awkwardly)
-What does it matter?

283
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:18,689
Zeu Ad is financially sound,
thanks to Planning Team 1.

284
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,400
(inhales deeply)

285
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:24,405
You must pull off another success
for Mopix

286
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,238
and bring up our sales. Okay?

287
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,120
I'll do my best.

288
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,871
(laughs)
Good.

289
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,957
(sighs deeply)
I wish there were

290
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,959
10 Cha Minhus in our agency.

291
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,381
Huh?
(laughs)

292
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:40,669
-Mm, it's fresh. Try the sashimi.
-Yes, sir.

293
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,633
HOWOO: All right. Here you go.

294
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:48,854
MAN: It's not easy to catch rock bream.

295
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,639
Did you really catch this in a week?

296
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,938
Even when we go to Gangwon-do
and stay there for a month,

297
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,309
we can barely catch this.

298
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,895
I have many talents.

299
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,230
It must be a piece of cake for you
to catch black porgies

300
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,896
-and red seabream too at this speed.
-Hmm.

301
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,864
MAN: All right. Then...

302
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:06,034
why don't you join
our One Love Fishing Club?

303
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:09,985
No. I'll give you everything.

304
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,825
I'll give you all this.

305
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,201
I'm done as of today.

306
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:16,332
Enjoy.

307
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,790
Huh?

308
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:23,054
She's cool. Something about her is cool.

309
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:25,505
MINHU:
At the anniversary party next week,

310
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,471
they'll introduce the Mopix project
that we'll be taking on.

311
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:31,142
The client won't be providing us
with any OT briefings.

312
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:33,601
They said they'd fully go
with our proposal.

313
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:37,482
Oh, then is your proposal all ready?

314
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,441
Are you going to be the PM
on this project again?

315
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:42,481
No. I'm going to assign
this project to the one

316
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,530
who brings me the best proposal.

317
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,324
Gosh, this is
a large-scale project, though.

318
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:49,284
You realize that the success
of this project

319
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,985
will lead to bonuses
and promotions, right?

320
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:51,905
Yes.

321
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,952
I'll accept proposals
until the end of next week.

322
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:57,116
I look forward to end results
that won't disappoint me.

323
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,036
That'll be all.

324
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,333
SANGGOO: Yes, sir.

325
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,248
(Sanggoo grunts)

326
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,013
Yesool!

327
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,931
You joined Zeu Ad
for the Mopix project, right?

328
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,760
-Yeah.
-I hope you land the PM on this again.

329
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,636
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

330
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:16,769
Ms. Hong.

331
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,851
You don't have
any other plans today, do you?

332
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,647
(stuttering)
Why... why do you ask?

333
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,110
Let's go to the event hall.

334
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,614
Get ready.

335
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,413
(indistinct chatter)

336
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:38,624
Coming out to help us take things down
on the last day.

337
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,666
You're just like Mr. Cha.

338
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:43,379
An AE's job isn't to do something
from A to E

339
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,960
but to do everything from A to Z.

340
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:47,415
That's what Mr. Cha says all the time...

341
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:50,926
But I guess Mr. Cha must really value you.

342
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,390
He must've been concerned
since it was your PM project.

343
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,099
He came out the day before the shoot

344
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,270
and checked everything,
including the wiring.

345
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,484
(chuckles awkwardly)
I should move this, right?

346
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,943
-Yeah. Thank you.
-Sure.

347
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,283
-Oh, boy.
-(grunts)

348
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,034
(romantic music)

349
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:31,972
What the hell.

350
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,715
What was that?

351
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,648
(light music)

352
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,161
(sighs)

353
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,831
YESOOL: <i>I'm glad it ended well.</i>

354
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:04,955
(smacks lips)

355
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:13,878
(camera shutter clicks)

356
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:17,808
(gasps)

357
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,731
(Minhu breathes deeply)

358
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,274
(scoffs)

359
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:27,816
I guess you're satisfied?

360
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:29,944
Oh.

361
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,192
(sighs)

362
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,413
Taking on PM for the first time
was rough, huh?

363
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,370
YESOOL: <i>What? All of a sudden?</i>

364
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,700
You lost sleep
and had to rely on Red Bomb.

365
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,497
That must've been tough.

366
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,960
(inhales deeply)

367
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:51,956
YESOOL: <i>What the hell.</i>

368
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,167
<i>What is he trying to say now?</i>

369
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:56,298
You worked hard.

370
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,722
MINHU: You worked hard
missing the client's needs

371
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,814
and setting the wrong direction
for the project.

372
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,770
Good job failing to manage
the model and staff.

373
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:07,102
Good job paying 20 million won

374
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:09,977
for the damage to the bed
and wrecking the budget.

375
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,355
As a consequence, you set the scene

376
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:13,071
for an unexpected incident
at the pop-up store,

377
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,822
and displayed your capacity as a PM.

378
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:17,613
You did a terrific job.

379
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,370
Oh.

380
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,252
I apologize.

381
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,623
I told you a hundred times.

382
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,500
A PM should be able
to forecast all possible variables.

383
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,376
(scoffs)
Yet you can't even read the signs.

384
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:35,302
Could you possibly handle
being the PM for Mopix?

385
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:39,927
My goodness.

386
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,019
Let's go.

387
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,688
Okay.

388
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:52,611
(sighs)

389
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,282
(Minhu tuts)

390
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,696
(mumbles)

391
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:04,704
(Minhu sighs)

392
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,995
(Yesool sighs deeply)

393
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:09,711
YESOOL: <i>I should've known.</i>

394
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,791
<i>There is no way this asshole
would fall for me.</i>

395
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,627
(clicks tongue)

396
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:15,963
(sighs)

397
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,840
(Minhu clicks tongue)

398
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,045
(sighs)

399
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,264
Hong Yesool.

400
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:21,929
Yes?

401
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,724
Last night, why did you...

402
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:25,465
(stuttering)
Last night?

403
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:26,427
Yeah.

404
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,056
At my place, why...

405
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:33,320
Oh, I guess you're wondering what happened
at your place last night. It was...

406
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,358
Why did you come to my place last night?

407
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:38,702
You should've returned
and wrapped up the pop-up event as the PM.

408
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:40,703
So unnecessary.

409
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,157
Don't do that again.

410
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:45,826
Oh, okay.

411
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:51,963
YESOOL: <i>Does he know or not?
This is so uncomfortable.</i>

412
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,212
(sighs)

413
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:00,723
(sighs)

414
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,265
LEE PILYO IS THE YOUNGEST
ASIAN FILM DIRECTOR...

415
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,690
I'M SO HONORED TO WIN THIS AWARD
AT THE CANNES FILM FESTIVAL

416
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,649
(dramatic music)

417
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:36,132
THANK YOU SO MUCH!

418
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,591
I SHED TEARS EVERY TIME I KISS YOU

419
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:41,585
HAROO

420
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,347
Don't you know how to shake hands?

421
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,561
Let's cooperate as a director and staff.

422
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,771
(gentle music playing)

423
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:03,953
(exhales deeply)

424
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:15,878
(sighs)

425
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:17,957
(gulps)

426
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,261
(smooches)

427
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:42,738
You wouldn't believe me
even if I told you.

428
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:47,283
Do you think
we'd be different if I told you?

429
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,026
What are you talking about, Haroo?

430
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,950
Tell me, so I can understand.

431
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:53,908
I saw it.

432
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:55,578
No, I can see it.

433
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:58,205
(sobbing)
Never mind what I just said.

434
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,169
It's nothing. Forget it.

435
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,717
Let's break up.

436
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:11,224
(dramatic music playing)

437
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:25,946
(breathes heavily)

438
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:28,623
(smooching)

439
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:35,332
(breathes nervously)

440
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,177
(breathes heavily)

441
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,890
(sobbing)

442
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:08,487
HAROO

443
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,660
All right. You just watched
a 120-minute story

444
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:15,452
about a man's romantic relationship

445
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:18,327
and breakup with a woman named Haroo.

446
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:21,165
The world is watching the director.
A genius.

447
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:24,801
We'll hear from Director Lee Pilyo
about the movie's hidden,

448
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,880
behind-the-scenes stories.

449
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,764
You can ask me anything.
I'll tell you everything as is.

450
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:33,183
Oh, yes.

451
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:34,563
(clears throat)

452
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,644
Director Lee, I really enjoyed the movie.

453
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,266
I was very impressed

454
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:42,812
by the mise-en-scéne
of the locations in your film.

455
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,028
Throughout the movie,

456
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:47,068
you portrayed metaphors
and symbols beautifully,

457
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,202
from the protagonist's studio apartment

458
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,239
to the snowy, desolate streets of England.

459
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:52,781
Oh, that.
(chuckles)

460
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:56,541
I was on a tight budget,
so the only places I could film

461
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,830
were a studio apartment
or in desolate streets.

462
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:02,504
I had no other choice but fortunately,
they came out beautifully.

463
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,094
(laughing)

464
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,250
Oh, I see.
(chuckles awkwardly)

465
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,628
-MAN: The mic, please.
-HOST: Please pass him the mic.

466
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,215
Hi, Director Lee.

467
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:14,220
Your detailed portrayal
of how suspicion and mistrust could

468
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:17,184
drive one to the destruction left quite
an impression on me.

469
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:20,685
Especially, the female lead Haroo's lines
felt very much alive.

470
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:26,024
Because an actual person said those lines.

471
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:28,187
(crowd murmuring)

472
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:30,646
All right. That brings us
to the end of Cine Talk.

473
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:33,277
Oh, let's hear from the lady back,
raising her hand.

474
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,485
HOST: Oh, okay.

475
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:39,254
The ending is a dream scene
that gives hints

476
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:42,539
at the reunion
between Haroo and her lover.

477
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:46,384
So there are various opinions
on whether they meet again or not.

478
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,590
I'd like to hear
how you interpret the ending scene.

479
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:53,888
I want to try to find out going forward.

480
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,393
The end of a movie
is the beginning of reality.

481
00:25:57,472 --> 00:26:00,182
(inhales deeply)
Since the credits have gone up,

482
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,227
I'm sure a new movie will start playing.

483
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:03,726
(scoffs)

484
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:05,271
DIRECTOR: Director Lee.

485
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:09,027
If you keep this up,
I can't schedule interviews anymore.

486
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,949
Whoa, good.
I didn't want to do interviews anyway.

487
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:13,948
Every time you open your mouth,

488
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,370
do you know how much
the investors start talking?

489
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:17,739
That I'm good-looking?

490
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,196
Do they want me to be an actor?

491
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,826
(laughs awkwardly)

492
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,252
You're kidding me, right?

493
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,630
Oh, come on.
We're on a tight schedule as is.

494
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:32,417
(sighs deeply)

495
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:36,007
You're killing me, Director.

496
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,560
(gentle music)

497
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:54,696

EOMJI (on phone): <i>Gosh, scared me.</i>

504
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:23,482
(scoffs)
Why are you so startled?

505
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,348
Hey. How can I not be?

506
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:26,385
Huh?

507
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,148
You finished Billy project
barely three hours ago,

508
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:29,689
yet you're still at work.

509
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:31,861
(smacking lips)
Whatever.

510
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:35,321
The first-generation Zelus ad.
Do you know its model and location?

511
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:37,663
I'm older than you are.

512
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:40,989
(inhales deeply)
But I wasn't even born in 1976.

513
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,826
Check the reference room.

514
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:45,004
All right.
(sighs)

515
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:46,535

523
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:24,826
What's going on?

524
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,578
Oh, no. I didn't even bring my cellphone.

525
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,666

YESOOL (murmus): Shoot.

528
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:11,171
-(Yesool screams)
-Hong Yesool. It's me.

529

PEOPLE WHO WRITE A NEW HISTORY

530
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,506
(dramatic music)

531
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:33,984
MINHU: Are you okay?

532
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,900
Oh, yes.

533
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:38,443
Can you walk?

534
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:40,526
(breathes deeply)

535
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:43,699
(breathes deeply)
Follow me.

536
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:54,286
YESOOL: <i>Oh, so this is how it goes, huh?</i>

537
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:57,246
<i>He's going to tell me
how he feels about me?</i>

538
00:29:57,337 --> 00:30:00,417
<i>But just like that? Out of the blue?
Cha Minhu?</i>

539
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:01,667
<i>To me?</i>

540
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,178
MINHU: Watch your steps.

541
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:06,259
-MINHU: Hong Yesool.
-YESOOL: Yes?

542
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:09,306
What are you thinking
about that you can't hear me?

543
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,480
I said, watch your steps.

544
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,350
Oh, okay.

545
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:19,858
You can't fall on your face again.

546
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:23,111
The stairs.

547
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,870
YESOOL: Mr. Cha.

548
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,622
It's pitch-dark. Can you see anything?

549
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:31,963
You're not hesitant at all.

550
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:34,868
I've walked this way hundreds of times.
How can I not know?

551
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:39,049
(mumbles)

552
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:44,553
(electricity hums)

553
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:48,223
(sighs)

554
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,097
(gasps)

555
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:58,984
You're working on the proposal, right?

556
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:01,534
Oh. Yes.

557
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,326
(snorts)

558
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,786
YESOOL: <i>So, since when did he
start liking me?</i>

559
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,341
(gasps)
<i>Is he a pervert who feels ecstatic</i>

560
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:23,884
<i>when harassing someone?</i>

561
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,585
Number one in consumer satisfaction
and quality survey.

562
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,337
Generation MZ's favorite brand.

563
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,141
These are brand evaluation results
that came out

564
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,221
before we took on this project.

565
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:35,387
Why did they bother putting together
something you can easily Google?

566
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:37,146
The Mopix campaign is your dream project.

567
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,267
Didn't you write in your resume

568
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:41,565
that you joined this agency to work
on Mopix ultimately?

569
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:45,605
You think you can just go through sites
and embellish it with words?

570
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:47,992
If you're going to do it, do it right.

571
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,283
(sighs)

572
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:52,831
Are you not feeling well?

573
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:56,621
It's nothing.

574
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:58,423
MINHU: Fix it and bring it back.

575
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,040
(grunts)

576
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:08,550
BRAND EVALUATION NUMBER 1 MOPIX...

577
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:10,804
(sighs)

578
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,969
(rain pattering)

579
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:33,658
(exhales)
You said so.

580
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:36,081
Pardon?

581
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:37,706
TWO YEARS AGO

582
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,789
The lobby on a rainy day. Isn't it nice?

583
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:45,464
So why is the summer rain always so loud?

584
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:48,625
I feel like the sound of rain
will suck me in.

585
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:53,299
(sighs)
Maybe it's because I worked all night.

586
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:56,723
I want to put a bed here and sleep on it,

587
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,885
with the sound of the rain
in the background.

588
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:04,364
You still remember that?

589
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:07,068
Did it ever occur to you
that you're the one

590
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:09,111
who can't seem to remember
pretty much everything?

591
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:13,026
Bye.

592
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:18,202
(gentle music)

593
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,005
YESOOL: <i>What the heck.</i>

594
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:32,303
EOMJI: <i>We have to go for it
at the anniversary party.</i>

595
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,215
-(laughs)
-(tuts)

596
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:35,892
So, many people get together there?

597
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,767
(Eomji whispering)
Don't you know?

598
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:41,059
Ms. Lee from Production Team 2,
Ms. Park from Planning Team 3.

599
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:42,904
Even a college student working

600
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:45,519
-as a server picked up someone there.
-Goodness.

601
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:47,436
So you're going to see your
new boyfriend there. All right?

602
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:48,895
Just count on me. Okay?

603
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:51,895
Wait... Isn't that Mr. Cha?

604
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:52,908
EOMJI: Huh?

605
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,739
MINHEE: Over there! Over there!

606
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:56,124
Right? Right?

607
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,950
My, was he seeing someone?

608
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,077
You knew, huh?

609
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
EOMJI: Hey, why are you so shocked?
What's so shocking about it?

610
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,086
MINHEE: It's just so fascinating.

611
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:10,211
-EOMJI: Oh, come on.
-MINHEE: That necklace!

612
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,298
EOMJI: You're being weird.

613
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,337
-(Eomji exclaims)
-MINHEE: But what do you think...

614
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,180
Mr. Cha was buying over there?

615
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,517
Who knows.

616
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,810
There's something
you don't know about him?

617
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:27,153
Gosh, how could I know everything
about him?

618
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:31,316
That's strange.

619
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:35,913
Yesool, you used to be firm and clear
in your responses to everything,

620
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,659
but you seem off these days.

621
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:42,118
You often space out,
and your mind is elsewhere.

622
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:47,415
Is something the matter these days?

623
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:51,011
(chuckles awkwardly)
No, nothing like that.

624
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,259
-Guys, can you take a look at me?
-(Minhee gasps)

625
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,011
(squealing)
So cute! Cute!

626
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,303
So cute. Stop it.

627
00:34:57,386 --> 00:35:01,136
Enough. I do tend to be busty...

628
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:03,434
-I'll pay in full.
-(both laugh)

629
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,688
Ms. Hong, you really
aren't buying anything?

630
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:07,982
No. I'm fine.

631
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:10,194
-You'll regret it. Jeez.
-(moans in disappointment)

632
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:13,744
Did I sign it? Oh, you're so kind.
Thank you.

633
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,543
(light music)

634
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,514
YESOOL: <i>I put myself in that situation.</i>

635
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:41,715
-Why isn't it there?
-Hey.

636
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:46,139
-What are you doing right now?
-Well, hold on.

637
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,937
-I clearly saw it earlier.
-Get out!

638
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,360
YESOOL: <i>And I caused a misunderstanding.</i>

639
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,280
Why do you keep staring
at my back since that day?

640
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,030
Well, no, no. It's nothing.

641
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:59,243
What are you trying to do to me right now?

642
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:02,793
Oh, you were drenched

643
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:06,909
and looked pale,
so I was trying to see if you were okay.

644
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:11,844
YESOOL: <i>I came across as ridiculous
having to come up with a lame excuse.</i>

<i>All I remember is struggling
while living in the present.</i>

648
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,404
(light music)

649
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,124
(door opens)

650
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:54,205
Ta-da.

651
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,045
Yesool, how do I look?

652
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:58,626
What is it this time?

653
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,466
I'll tour all the hot clubs in Seoul.

654
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:03,601
And what comes after is a secret.

655
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,015
Bye!

656
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,137
Oh, Yesool.

657
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,597
Go to bed first.

658
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,983
Oh, dear.
(scoffs)

659
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,034

-You have a pimple on your back.

Well, it's an important night.

Oh, it is? Who is it? Who did you pick?

Gosh, pick whom? Who did you pick, Eomji?

683
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:38,274

Why are you looking at me like that?

701
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:08,948
What do you mean?

702
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:15,959
YESOOL: What the...

703
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:18,252
Did he get a haircut

704
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:21,092
while making up his mind
to ask me out tonight, or what?

705
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:27,086
(cheering)

706
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:29,644
(dance music playing)

707
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,271
(cheers)

708
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,529
(cheers)

709
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,040
(cheers)

710
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:58,791
Oh, you're a good dancer.

711
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:01,173
Oh, you're a great dancer!

712
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:06,259
-Are you here by yourself?
-Yes, I am.

713
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:08,298
(exclaims in surprise)
Me too!

714
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:09,302
(exclaims)

715
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:10,683
(cheers)

716
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:17,848
By any chance, are you the type who tends
to get clingy and stuff like that?

717
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:20,557
No, I have no time to spare as is.
Why would I do that?

718
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:22,523
Me too.

719
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:25,435
I don't have much time left, either.

720
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:27,743
You're totally my type.

721
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,318
Shall we go somewhere else?

722
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:31,783
(dance music continues playing)

723
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:35,243
(classical music playing)

724
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,236
YESOOL:
The president of Piaget likes whiskey.

725
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,538
Always prepare one as a gift.

726
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:39,541
Whiskey.

727
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:43,456
Over there. Do you see
the man in his 50s with a cobalt-blue tie?

728
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:44,672
Oh. Yes.

729
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,092
He's the director at Mopix.

730
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:50,382
He likes getting thoughtful
handwritten letters, so prepare one.

731
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:52,296
It'll help at our next meeting.

732
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:54,054
MINHEE: Handwritten letters.

733
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,231
(upbeat romantic music)

734
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,566
(indistinct chatter)

735
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:10,900
He looks like he's from a different world
when you see him like that.

736
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,855
Oh, I wonder why he got a haircut.

737
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:16,448
He looks totally different.
(giggles)

738
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:24,577
GUARD: Please wait.

739
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:26,708
Excuse me.

740
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,421
Do you guys all have IDs on you?

741
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:31,795
-I'm a police officer.
-Oh, okay.

742
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:34,262
-Have you ever seen this man?
-No, I haven't.

743
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:37,013
Since you haven't,
let me go in and look for him.

744
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:40,466
-Oh, sure. Go ahead. You can go this way.
-Thanks. Okay.

745
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,346
-HOWOO: Cheers.
-Cheers.

746
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:46,556
(dance music playing)

747
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:48,939
(exclaims)

748
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:53,030
Neither of us has a lot of time.
We're in sync!

749
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:56,452
There are so many things
to do in life, you know.

750
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:58,162
I don't want my life
to end like this either,

751
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,242
so I try to experience
and learn whatever I can.

752
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:04,787
Fortunately, I'm super smart,
so I master things in a week.

753
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:07,083
People used to call me a genius
ever since I was little.

754
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:09,247
I got complimented on whatever I did.

755
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:10,916
But "you suck" or "get lost."

756
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:13,415
They're always
making personal attacks at work,

757
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:15,804
so I just want to hide somewhere.

758
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:18,847
(crowd cheers)

759
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:26,601
-I'm sorry. Just a second.
-Sorry? Oh, my. Wait. Hey! Hey!

760
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:27,897
Hey!

761
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:31,435
What's with that moron?

762
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:33,492
Oh.

763
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:35,985
(crowd cheers)

764
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:37,531
(upbeat music playing)

765
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,115
Where did that punk go?
Did he take off already?

766
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,790
(groans in frustration)

767
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:42,789
Oh!

768
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,330
I've seen this man.

769
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:48,002
I know him.

770
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:49,924
What's going on?

771
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:52,247
(gasps)
Does he owe you money?

772
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:56,259
You're a creditor, aren't you?
No wonder he was acting weird.

773
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,644
-Do you want me to help you find him?
-What?

774
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:08,647
Over there. That man! Isn't that him?

775
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:11,359
Right? Go. Let's go. That's him, right?

776
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,440
-Hey, Kim Joonho!
-Get him! Get him!

777
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:16,241
(upbeat music playing)

778
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:22,953
Kim Joonho! That punk! That asshole!

779
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:33,087
(screams)
Go get him! Go, go! Get him!

780
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,010
-Where did he go?
-Well... To the right? Right or left?

781
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:36,879
Jeez, I don't know. Just go.

782
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:41,434
-SEUNGTAEK: Man, where did this punk go?
-Huh? Didn't he run this way? Maybe not.

783
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:42,932
-Oh, here.
-There's another club here.

784
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:44,223
-This one. Let's check this one out.
-Okay.

785
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:45,386
Don't you think he might be in here?

786
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:48,058
Jeez, that jerk...

787
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:50,233
(dance music playing)

788
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:57,646
-I don't think he's here.
-Have you seen this man?

789
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:01,945
Oh! Right there.

790
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:04,122
There, there. Isn't that him?

791
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:07,906
Man, that punk.

792
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:12,956
Hey.
(gasps)

793
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:17,131
(tuts)

794
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:18,764
(inhales deeply)

795
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:21,011
(sighs)
It's all right.

796
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:24,813
If we can't find him after all this,
I don't think he's in this area.

797
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:27,274
Well... Let's quit here.

798
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:30,140
Anyway, it was fun.

799
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:31,647
Well, thanks.

800
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:34,019
Wait. Wait a minute.

801
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:36,977
Come on. Are you kidding me?

802
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:39,527
I spent so much of my time
trying to help you out

803
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:40,861
and you want to quit like this?

804
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:44,277
(scoffing)
Well, I appreciate your help.

805
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:45,906
But it's not like...
(scoffs)

806
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:49,294
I asked for your help. Right?

807
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:54,787
By the way, you were coughing
earlier over there.

808
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:58,207
I take this from time to time. Take it.

809
00:45:58,714 --> 00:45:59,804
(Seungtaek clears throat)

810
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:02,433
(scoffs)

811
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:05,801
Then why didn't you say no
when I offered to help earlier?

812
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:07,718
I gave up my precious time to help you.

813
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:11,483
Wait, I thought you were doing that
out of the goodness of your heart.

814
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,100
(scoffing)
Jeez.

815
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:16,899
Check out three to four places
out of the goodness of my heart?

816
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:18,692
-(Seungtaek shouts)
-(Howoo screams)

817
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:20,736
(light music)

818
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:42,168
-(moans in bewilderment)
-(Howoo clears throat)

819
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:43,837
(chuckles awkwardly)

820
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:47,006
-(clears throat)
-Well, why don't you

821
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:49,005
buy me a drink
out of the goodness of your heart?

822
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:50,601
Follow me.

823
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:52,480
What?

824
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:54,769
(cheeky music)

825
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,074
Come.

826
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:01,355
(Seungtaek snorts)

827
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:04,069
(classical music playing)

828
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:09,033
(phone buzzing)

829
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:16,252
HOWOO
HOW IS IT GOING? DID HE ASK YOU OUT?

830
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:24,508
GOOD LUCK
I'M NOT GOING HOME TONIGHT. BYE

831
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:28,054
(tongue clicks)

832
00:47:28,136 --> 00:47:29,466
(sighs)

833
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:35,306
(lipstick cap closes)

834
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:36,774
(purse clattering)

835
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:42,649
(classical music playing)

836
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:52,741
PILYO: Hong Yesool.

837
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:55,208
(romantic music)

838
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:03,173
YESOOL: <i>Is it time?</i>

839
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:12,602
<i>He's finally going to ask me out?</i>

840
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:16,728
<i>Well, should I see how he does it?</i>

841
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:26,067
(romantic music fades)

842
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:29,655
PILYO: I'm back.

843
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:34,367
(sighing)
I'm back.

844
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:36,285
No.

845
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,287
I missed you.

846
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:44,842
(sighing)
Man.

847
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,626
I practiced over a hundred times.

848
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:50,764
(sighing)
I suck.

849
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:53,809
It took me three years to give you

850
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:57,976
what you wanted so badly.

851
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:03,479
(scoffs)

852
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:05,525
(light music)

853
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:23,246
(dramatic music)

854
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:35,012
(sighing deeply)

855
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:41,845
Mopix has led the Korean
automobile industry for half a century,

856
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:46,984
and Planning Team 1 of Zeu Ad
will take on the advertising campaign

857
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:49,487
for the new model V9,
which is about to launch.

858
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:52,662
Oh, and the commercial will be directed

859
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:54,951
by Director Lee Pilyo,

860
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:58,497
a world-renowned director.

861
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:01,076
(applause)

862
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:06,712
Hello.

863
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:09,625
I'm Lee Pilyo, and I will be directing

864
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:11,884
the Mopix V9 commercial.

865
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:16,257
I'm so honored to take on
the Mopix commercial since

866
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:19,346
-it has a special meaning for me.
-(inhales deeply)

867
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:21,443
(indistinct chatter)

868
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:23,098
(classical music playing)

869
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:27,187
Can I ask you something?

870
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:29,233
Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me.

871
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:32,737
EOMJI: An actor?
Stop talking nonsense. Goodness.

872
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:36,030
He's handsome enough to star
in his own film.

873
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:38,866
-He looks so cool.
-Can I talk to you for a...

874
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:40,372
How do you do.

875
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:46,290
It's not the first time for me, but sure.

876
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:47,786
(indistinct chatter)

877
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:50,298
I'm Hong Yesool,
an AE for Planning Team 1.

878
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,880
I look forward to working with you,
Director Lee Pilyo.

879
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:55,795
The same goes for me
as well going forward...

880
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:58,176
-And can you spare a moment...
-All right then.

881
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:05,563
(somber music)

882
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:24,712
YESOOL: <i>Yes. It was the same back then.</i>

883
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:32,919
MY DIRECTOR LEE
CALLING

884
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:35,341
Thanks for wrapping it up.

885
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:36,715
-Good work. Good work.
-Good work.

886
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,182
-Director Lee.
-Oh, hey. Excuse me, Assistant Director.

887
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:40,511
Please check on the conditions before
we shoot this tunnel scene tomorrow.

888
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:41,427
-Bye now.
-Okay.

889
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:42,345
-Yes.
-The lighting...

890
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:44,602
AUTOMATED VOICE: <i>The person you are
trying to reach is not available...</i>

891
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:47,648
PILYO: Thank you.

892
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:48,859
ASSISTANT: Bye.

893
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,729
Director Lee, we have to be on the move.

894
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:52,776
Okay. Go ahead and have dinner first.

895
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:54,399
-STAFF: Oh, okay.
-PILYO: Yes.

896
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:02,084
PILYO: What brings you here?

897
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:03,907
Why won't you answer my calls?

898
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:07,459
I didn't get a call. The phone...

899
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:09,131
I called you so many times! Give it to me.

900
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:10,289
No, wait.

901
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:11,957
-Let me see it!
-Wait!

902
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:15,419
(sighs)

903
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:17,547
Hey, I was working!

904
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,800
So you don't answer calls
when you're working?

905
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:20,966
Don't you even eat?

906
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:23,184
Did you come all the way here
to check that?

907
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:24,095
I did.

908
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:25,812
-For real?
-That's right!

909
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:28,352
-Oh, come on!
-What?

910
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:30,897
YESOOL: <i>I put myself in that situation.</i>

911
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:40,526
Hong Yesool.

912
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:44,084
Why are you doing this?
You have to tell me, so I'd know.

913
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:46,581
You've been acting weird since that day.

914
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:50,538
YESOOL: <i>And I caused a misunderstanding.</i>

915
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:52,205
And what if I tell you?

916
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:54,496
If I tell you, what can you do to fix it?

917
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:56,758
(sighs deeply)

918
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:59,591
You wouldn't believe me
even if I told you.

919
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:01,718
Do you think...

920
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:05,346
we'd be different if I told you?

921
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:13,360
YESOOL: <i>Making lame excuses
and looking ridiculous.</i>

922
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:18,145
(Pilyo sighs)

923
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:21,615
(exhales deeply)

924
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:26,747
Let's break up.

925
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:34,461
YESOOL: <i>I ran away as I wanted
to avoid what was to come.</i>

926
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:37,714
<i>That was me back then.</i>

927
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:44,262
(somber music continues)

928
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:56,271
(car horn honking)

929
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,610
(tires screech)

930
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:02,283
(whooshing)

931
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:06,367
(pants)

932
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:09,294
Are you crazy? Get a hold of yourself!

933
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:16,168
Why are you crying?

934
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:19,456
Why? Why?

935
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:21,421
(sobbing)
I'm just...

936
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:23,088
Why are you crying?

937
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:26,177
Why are you yelling at me?

938
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:27,563
(whimpers)

939
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:29,519
I was startled as is.

940
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:32,019
Why are you yelling at me?

941
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:35,438
(sobbing)

942
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:37,397
Sorry.

943
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:44,655
(sobbing continues)

944
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:50,452
What?

945
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,827
(mumbles)

946
00:54:52,914 --> 00:54:54,464
(sobs)

947
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:56,631
(scoffs)
Are you crazy?

948
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:01,510
RIB EYE STEAK, PRIME RIBS,
FLAT IRON STEAK, TENDERLOIN

949
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:07,929
(exhales deeply)
It just melts in my mouth.

950
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:12,179
This is delicious. Why aren't you eating?

951
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:13,979
You eat.

952
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:16,650
I didn't know you liked rib eye that much

953
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,650
that you'd cry
in the middle of the street for it.

954
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:20,226
Boy.

955
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:21,987
(sobs)

956
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:24,067
I'm hungry.

957
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:26,490
What?

958
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:28,703
Rib eye steak.

959
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:30,583
(sobs)

960
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,290
(scoffs)
Are you crazy?

961
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:34,289
(chuckles awkwardly)

962
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:37,462
Gosh, I can't believe
you're buying me rib eye.

963
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:41,302
By the way,
how did you know that I was here?

964
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:47,427
(clears throat)

965
00:55:50,096 --> 00:55:53,476
I've been craving meat since earlier.

966
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:57,230
But I was in a bind since I left my wallet
and purse at the party.

967
00:55:57,645 --> 00:55:58,555
How come?

968
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:01,266
Well, I just forgot.

969
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:05,857
Just like that day.

970
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:11,825
(clears throat)

971
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,869
(smacks lips)

972
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:20,088
(exhales)

973
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:22,126
Mr. Cha.

974
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:25,762
I have to go somewhere after this.

975
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:29,177
Can you lend me some money?

976
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:31,854
(scoffs)

977
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:35,385
(chuckles awkwardly)

978
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:38,225
-(indistinct chatter)
-(classical music playing)

979
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,820
My goodness.

980
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:47,490
Where did she go
leaving her purse and cellphone here?

981
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:50,162
(clinks)

982
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:56,155
Do Director Lee Pilyo
and Ms. Hong know each other?

983
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:58,674
Well? I'm not sure.

984
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:02,129
(breathes deeply)

985
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:04,424
I noticed earlier when they said hello

986
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:07,384
that it didn't seem
like it was their first time meeting.

987
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:09,594
(tongue clicks)

988
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:12,346
Did you sense something slightly odd?

989
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:17,891
Well? I'm not sure about that.

990
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:20,596
I guess you don't know.

991
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:23,567
Hey, you're drunk. Let's go.
You're wasted.

992
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:25,978
-Okay.
-Let go. Let go!

993
00:57:26,067 --> 00:57:28,187
No, this is...
No, I was going to take it home.

994
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:30,448
Let go! Let go of it!

995
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,870
-Shit.
-I was going to take it home.

996
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:35,449
Gosh, girl. You're killing me.

997
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:41,118
(sighs)

998
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:44,253
(gulps)

999
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:47,335
(clicks tongue, exhales deeply)

1000
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:53,756
But why do you keep following me?

1001
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:55,637
You don't like places like this.

1002
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:57,894
In case you won't pay me.

1003
00:57:58,766 --> 00:58:00,306
Gosh, I'll pay you back.

1004
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:03,560
You're not even going to drink with me.
So why are you...

1005
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:05,476
Because you're going to drink a lot.

1006
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:06,942
Sorry?

1007
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:09,986
Don't you remember that night?

1008
00:58:10,778 --> 00:58:12,948
(whimpers)
What an asshole.

1009
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:13,871
(sobs)

1010
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:15,658
THREE YEARS AGO

1011
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:22,669
(sobbing continues)

1012
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:26,344
What?

1013
00:58:33,426 --> 00:58:34,716
(blows)

1014
00:58:34,802 --> 00:58:36,392
(slurps)

1015
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:39,056
(whimpers)

1016
00:58:43,144 --> 00:58:46,064
-It's hot. Oh, it's hot.
-It's hot?

1017
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:48,154
Hot. Drink water.

1018
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:50,443
(whimpers)

1019
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:53,113
(slurps)

1020
00:58:56,157 --> 00:58:58,787
(gulps, whimpers continues)

1021
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:12,836
(sighs)

1022
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:15,224
Seriously...
(sniffles)

1023
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:17,887
I'm never going to date again.

1024
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:20,431
Never in my life.

1025
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,730
There will never be
another romantic relationship.

1026
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:24,809
But still...

1027
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:28,273
What do you mean, still?

1028
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:32,939
I'm just going to work

1029
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:34,990
like crazy from now on.

1030
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:37,776
(sniffles)

1031
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:40,367
Hey, hey!

1032
00:59:40,451 --> 00:59:42,001
-(gulping)
-Hey! Hey!

1033
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:43,118
(spitting)

1034
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:44,908
Oh.

1035
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:47,577
Are you really bipolar or what?

1036
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:49,214
What?

1037
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:52,919
It's really tough to figure you out.
That's why.

1038
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:56,216
Did you decide to pick on me
on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays

1039
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:58,968
and console me
on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays?

1040
00:59:59,053 --> 01:00:00,563
I should know, so I could be prepared.

1041
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:01,968
Be prepared for what?

1042
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:04,022
You're confusing me.

1043
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:07,353
What? How am I confusing you?

1044
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:11,271
Why did you get a haircut?
And why didn't you...

1045
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:15,611
My hair? What are you talking about?

1046
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:20,697
(sucks air)
You've been acting like a different person

1047
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:23,333
for the last few weeks compared
to the last five years I've known you.

1048
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:25,247
What's with you these days?

1049
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:31,132
(sighs)

1050
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:32,920
YESOOL: <i>I want to tell him everything.</i>

1051
01:00:39,218 --> 01:00:41,388
-YESOOL: One more bottle, please.
-OWNER: Sure.

1052
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:45,979
YESOOL: One more bottle.

1053
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:47,559
MINHU: Hong Yesool, that's enough.

1054
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:48,564
Let's go.

1055
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:51,645
Come on. What's your problem?

1056
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:53,441
You drank too much.

1057
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:58,403
(moans)

1058
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:00,198
(sighs)

1059
01:01:01,032 --> 01:01:02,992
You're acting weird lately.

1060
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:05,453
-(tongue clicks)
-Are you hiding something from me?

1061
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:09,829
You're much weirder, Mr. Cha.

1062
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:12,916
Saving me at the pop-up store too.

1063
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:15,632
It's also weird that you pop up out
of nowhere at times.

1064
01:01:15,713 --> 01:01:17,633
Like when there was a blackout
and today too.

1065
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:20,086
Oh, and your place.

1066
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:22,045
What's wrong with your house?

1067
01:01:22,136 --> 01:01:25,256
No TV and no food in the fridge.

1068
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:27,635
Do you even eat?

1069
01:01:28,976 --> 01:01:30,596
Oh, right!

1070
01:01:30,978 --> 01:01:32,938
Why do you have so many pill bottles...

1071
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:38,402
Oh, I'm sorry.

1072
01:01:40,154 --> 01:01:41,414
For what?

1073
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:46,661
You don't like it when I touch you.
You always make a face when I do that.

1074
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:51,366
I'm all right now.

1075
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:54,134
Now?

1076
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:56,546
YESOOL: What do you mean by that?

1077
01:01:57,463 --> 01:01:59,093
(quirky music)

1078
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:03,257
My goodness. See?

1079
01:02:03,928 --> 01:02:05,558
YESOOL: You're so weird.

1080
01:02:06,514 --> 01:02:10,734
When you think about it,
you're the weirdest person in the world.

1081
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:14,233
You're the weird one, not me.

1082
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:18,653
-Ever since that day...
-Oh, that. I had my reasons.

1083
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:22,280
If you heard my reasons,
you'd get me 100 percent.

1084
01:02:23,614 --> 01:02:26,874
But then again, you are pretty weird.

1085
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:30,792
I kind of want to tell you
why I've been weird.

1086
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:33,077
Is it because I'm drinking?

1087
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:37,207
But I can't tell you
because it's about you.

1088
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:39,094
It's about me?

1089
01:02:39,672 --> 01:02:42,222
Yes. You wouldn't believe me
even if I told you.

1090
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:44,389
I will.

1091
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:48,139
I'll believe you.

1092
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:52,731
Well...

1093
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:54,650
What do you mean you'll believe me?

1094
01:02:55,563 --> 01:02:57,943
-I have to go.
-Hey, be careful.

1095
01:02:58,024 --> 01:02:59,234
-Oh.
-Man.

1096
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:03,532
-Ma'am, how much is it?
-It's 48,000 won.

1097
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:04,953
-48,000 won?
-Yes.

1098
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:07,121
-It's pricy. Here you go.
-The change...

1099
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,620
MINHU: Hey, Hong Yesool!

1100
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:11,499
-(Yesool shouts)
-MINHU: Hey. Hey!

1101
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:14,619
Are you crazy? Hey, hey, hey.

1102
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:17,497
-What's wrong with you?
-(laughs)

1103
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:20,125
-Jeez, shit.
-I feel good!

1104
01:03:20,713 --> 01:03:21,763
Get in the car.

1105
01:03:22,256 --> 01:03:23,626
I'll drive you home.

1106
01:03:23,716 --> 01:03:24,926
(gasps)

1107
01:03:25,718 --> 01:03:28,178
You didn't drink,
so you could drive me home?

1108
01:03:28,262 --> 01:03:31,682
-Oh, my. You're so sweet.
-(scoffs)

1109
01:03:31,766 --> 01:03:34,266
How are you going to
face me tomorrow, huh?

1110
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:35,852
What do you mean?

1111
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:38,187
Why can't I face you?

1112
01:03:38,272 --> 01:03:39,982
(gasps)
Why can't I?

1113
01:03:40,399 --> 01:03:42,739
Why not? What does that mean?

1114
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:45,239
Jeez, hey, hey. Get in. Get in.

1115
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:47,201
-(moans)
-Watch your head. Hey, hey.

1116
01:03:47,281 --> 01:03:49,161
-(Yesool laughs)
-(Minhu grunts)

1117
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:51,082
-(laughs)
-Jeez.

1118
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:53,745
(moans)

1119
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:02,383
(both sigh)

1120
01:04:02,463 --> 01:04:03,673
(exhales deeply)

1121
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:06,050
But Mr. Cha.

1122
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:10,557
-Will you really believe me?
-(sighs)

1123
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:15,888
You really, really wouldn't believe me.
I said "really" twice.

1124
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:17,647
I'll believe you.

1125
01:04:17,937 --> 01:04:21,017
You will believe me? No matter what I say?

1126
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:22,067
Yeah.

1127
01:04:23,776 --> 01:04:27,486
You'll be pretty shocked, though.

1128
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:28,492
(sighs)

1129
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:29,913
You know...

1130
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:33,372
I see the future when I kiss someone.

1131
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:35,155
I saw it.

1132
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:38,877
You and I will be sleeping together
in the future.

1133
01:04:42,003 --> 01:04:44,463
To be honest, I can't believe it, either.

1134
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:45,757
Think about it.

1135
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,760
You and me doing that.

1136
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:51,508
So I wanted to double-check it.

1137
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:55,681
-Double-check?
-Yes.

1138
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:58,193
Can I?

1139
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:03,148
(pensive music)

1140
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:06,688
(sighs)

1141
01:05:09,947 --> 01:05:11,617
You asked for it first, all right?

1142
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:17,620
(romantic music)

1143
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:40,059
(romantic music continues)
