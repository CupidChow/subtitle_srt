(doorknob rattles)

3
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,078
(door creaks)

4
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,582
(ominous music)

5
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:44,711
What happened?

6
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,844
(ominous music continues)

7
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,402

00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,288
(theme music)

00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,800
HONG YESOOL, PLANNING TEAM 1

10
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:26,232
And about your suggestion for us
to go on three dates last time.

11
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,110
Fine. Let's do that.

12
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:31,725
PILYO: Be careful.

13
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,663
It took me three years to give you...

14
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,582
what you wanted so badly.

15
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,752
(dramatic music)

16
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:57,804
(breathes nervously)

00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,256
EPISODE 6

00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,470
(gasps)

19
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:02,933
How...

20
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,976
(gasps)

21
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,439
(sighs)

22
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:11,766
HONG YESOOL

23
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,905
BASED ON THE WEBNOVEL
KISS SIXTH SENSE BY GOT W

24
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,370
(sighs deeply)

25
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,285
Oh, no. What is this?

26
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,870
(foreboding music)

27
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:28,205
(plastic rustling)

28
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,010
Who...

29
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,628
(stuttering)
Who's there?

30
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,546
YESOOL (echoing): <i>Who's there?</i>

31
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:51,519
(shaky breathing)

32
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,735
(nervous breathing)

33
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,821
(ominous music)

34
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,327
(screams)

35
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:11,214
MINHU: Hong Yesool!

36
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:13,837
Shit.

37
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,093
Hey!

38
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,893
(pants)

39
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,180
Yesool.

40
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,353
Are you okay?

41
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,432
Mr. Cha.
(pants)

42
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:28,937
(siren blaring in distance)

43
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,398
(clamoring)

44
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:33,438
You said no money
or valuables were stolen.

45
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:35,151
Did you see his face by chance?

46
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:36,566
No.

47
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,855
(sighing)
It looks like there's

48
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,565
a surge of break-ins
of empty houses in this area.

49
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,316
It's the same MO,

50
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,448
so I think it's the same perp.

51
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,445
Get some rest tonight,

52
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,157
and please come to the station tomorrow
and tell us the details.

53
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,458
Okay.

54
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:55,042
(neighbors chatting)

55
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:06,136
(heartbeats)

56
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:13,602
MINHU: Are you okay? Are you sure
you don't need to see a doctor?

57
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,978
Yes, I'm fine.

58
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,566
But Mr. Cha, how did you know
when to come here?

59
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,488
Oh.

60
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,661
You didn't pick up the phone, so...
(inhales)

61
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,330
I got a call from Mopix
regarding the PPM schedule.

62
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:27,951
You called?

63
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,081
Oh, I didn't get any calls.

64
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,673
What do you mean?
I called you so many times.

65
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:36,091
-I don't think so. I'm sure...
-Ah, forget it.

66
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,553
That's not important right now.

67
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:40,717
Do you have a place to sleep tonight?

68
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,759
(light music)

69
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,724
You're not going to sleep here, are you?

70
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:48,183
(light music)

71
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,398
I can go by myself.

72
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:07,155
It's not my first time
sleeping in the office. I'm really okay.

73
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:09,831
I have to turn in a proposal
by tomorrow too.

74
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,163
Oh, I see.

75
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:17,502
I'll email the schedule
to Mopix in the morning.

76
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:24,296
(car horn honking)

77
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,014
(tires screech)

78
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,724
-(grunts)
-(tires screech)

79
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,764
(gasps)

80
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,427
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

81
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:33,517
Oh.

82
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,941
(stuttering)
No, I'm fine.

83
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:42,694
(whimsical music)

84
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:47,874
(chuckles)

85
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,291
(giggles)

86
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,424
YESOOL: <i>What was that? The future?</i>

87
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,705
(sighs)

88
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,302
(inhales deeply)

89
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,759
(sighs)
Okay.

90
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,176
I'll go now.

91
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,404
(gentle music)

92
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,994
YESOOL: <i>What the heck?</i>

93
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,492
<i>What's going on?</i>

94
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:40,917
(breathes deeply)

95
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,672
(heartbeats)

96
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,884
(breathes heavily)

97
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:50,928
(heartbeats)

98
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,143
Yesool.

99
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:03,111
YESOOL:
<i>Do I really get together with Cha Minhu?</i>

100
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,361
Are you hurt? Do you want to see a doctor?

101
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,153
YESOOL: <i>No way.</i>

102
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,032
<i>How could that be...</i>

103
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,780
Are you sure you're okay?

104
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,697
(heartbeats)

105
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:24,958
(coughs)

106
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,168
I'm sorry.

107
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:34,931
Oh.

108
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,774
(stuttering)
You were here.

109
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:40,558
(luggage rattling)

110
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:51,528
(door opens)

111
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,666
(sighs)

112
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,303
EOMJI: <i>Are you going out with Cha Minhu?</i>

113
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,050
-It's not like that.
-If not, what did I just see?

114
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,257
Tell me everything.

115
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,057
Or else, I'll spread the word
in the morning.

116
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,230
You know I have a big mouth.

117
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,478
(Yesool sighs)

118
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,805
YESOOL: <i>A burglar broke into my house.</i>

119
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,727
What?
(breathes nervously)

120
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,282
-A burglar?
-That's right.

121
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:31,279
If it weren't for Mr. Cha,
I'd be in bad shape right now.

122
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:34,372
He called me to discuss Mopix,
but I couldn't pick up.

123
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,278
So he ended up coming all the way
to my place.

124
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,367
(sighs)

125
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:40,331
Thanks to that,
here I am talking to you right now.

126
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,963
(sighs deeply)
Jeez, you must've been so scared.

127
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,379
But why did he touch
your forehead earlier?

128
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,264
And he was looking at you so tenderly.

129
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:55,433
YESOOL: <i>What do you mean, tenderly?</i>

130
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:57,971
Eomji, stop watching so many dramas.

131
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:02,475
He did that out of worry
because I was so out of it.

132
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,770
Is that the type of reaction one
has out of worry?

133
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,314
Jeez, if it's not a worry, then what?

134
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:09,147
What? Do you think we're really
seeing each other or something?

135
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,863
That could happen.
Hey, let's be blunt here.

136
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,454
Cha Minhu is a perfect ten
on a scale of one to five, no?

137
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:18,334
Eomji, but still,
how could I ever date Cha Minhu...

138
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,580
(light music)

139
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:31,881
You.

140
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,884
(scoffs)
I wasn't going to say this.

141
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:37,348
You know what? Let me tell you this.

142
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,008
Growing a soft spot for a guy

143
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,716
despite all the bad
and the ugly could be scary.

144
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,387
Huh? Think about it.

145
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,943
How many years
have you been working with him?

146
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:51,611
It's all because
something about you two click.

147
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:54,112
EOMJI: <i>That's why you're working together,
don't you think?</i>

148
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,195
<i>Don't you think?</i>

149
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,079
I'm tired of having to spell it out
for you. Do you get it?

150
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,278
Eomji.

151
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:04,502
You said Cha Minhu looked at me
tenderly earlier, right?

152
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,460
Not just tenderly.

153
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,880
His eyes were dripping
so much sweetness like honey.

154
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,419
(inhales deeply)

155
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:16,375
By chance,
are you already going out with him?

156
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,391
Not right now...

157
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,102
If not now,
are you saying you could be going out

158
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,392
with him in the future or what?

159
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:27,273
(sighs deeply)

160
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,443
I wish I didn't remember it for good.

161
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,322
Oh, I should've drank more that night.

162
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,479
(sighing)
Why did I have to remember...

163
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:37,605
Remember... Remember what? Shit!

164
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,567
It's just something, okay?

165
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,078
Jeez, seriously...

166
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,449
Goodness...

167
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,906
Of all people...

168
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,673
(sighs)
This is driving me crazy.

169
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,288
(shouts in frustration)

170
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,339
(grunts)

171
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:55,514
EOMJI: <i>I'm going nuts here!</i>
(shouts in frustration)

172
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,260
(sighs)

173
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,761
<i>Oh, come on! Spill it!</i>

174
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:07,436
(snores)

175
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,744
If I tell you, what can you do to fix it?

176
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,077
(sighs)

177
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:26,945
I told you.

178
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:29,581
We're bound to break up anyway.

179
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,290
I saw it.

180
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,089
(sobbing)
I can see it.

181
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,376
(laughs)

182
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:46,928
(gentle music)

183
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,556
YESOOL: <i>It was my first time</i>

184
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,562
<i>seeing myself smile.</i>

185
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,225
(gentle music continues)

186
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,510
Welcome.

187
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,425
Ten bacon and egg sandwiches,
ten turkey avocado sandwiches,

188
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,058
and ten hot Americanos to go, please.

189
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,895
-Yes, sir.
-Oh, wait.

190
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,323
Please add cold BBQ and shrimp.

191
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:40,815
And these.

192
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,532
I'll take these too.

193
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:47,445
-With the drinks, the total is 3...
-Wait.

194
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,664
Do you have any yogurt?

195
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,655
Oh, yogurt is down there.

196
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,415
MINHEE: So did you sleep here last night?

197
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,375
Yeah.

198
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:03,134
Ms. Jang happened to be working late too.
So we ended up sleeping here together.

199
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,847
Wow. Whoever that burglar is,
he's really gutsy.

200
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,560
There are surveillance cameras
in every alley these days.

201
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,639
So, Ms. Hong, did they catch the burglar?

202
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:14,654
No. Speaking of which,
I need to go to the station about that.

203
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:16,478
The whole neighborhood is chaotic.

204
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,824
Ms. Hong, is this an unlucky year for you?

205
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,529
You're getting caught up
in so many things.

206
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,910
I mean, should I keep my distance
from you for the time being or something?

207
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,989
Oh, come on, Mr. Kang.

208
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,905
MINHU: You all came in early this morning.
Good morning.

209
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,124
(Sanggoo gasps)

210
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:34,285
You didn't have breakfast yet, right?
Let's meet after you eat.

211
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,043
How did you know
that I skipped breakfast this morning?

212
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,285
Thank you for this.
I really appreciate it.

213
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,786
-Thank you for the food.
-Thank you.

214
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,875
MINHEE: What is all this?

215
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:44,591
Aren't you going to eat?

216
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,428
Oh, I'll eat later.

217
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,560
VICE-PRESIDENT

218
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:58,727
Yes.

219
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,194
Come, Ms. Hong. These are delicious.

220
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,526
-The sandwiches we had the other day.
-Oh, okay.

221
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,777
(sighs)

222
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:11,155
It's definitely the picture from that day.

223
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:16,372
But I made sure we deleted it
right after sharing it.

224
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:20,167
If you made sure,
how could this be up on an online forum?

225
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:24,302
(chuckles awkwardly)
But it only had two views.

226
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,717
They deleted the post right away.
That's a relief.

227
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,721
I checked other automotive online forums.

228
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:32,223
I don't think it was leaked anywhere else.

229
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,216
PILYO: So what?

230
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,847
Mopix called me because they had
already found out that it was leaked.

231
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:37,899
(sighs)

232
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,605
Guys.

233
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:43,316
ASSISTANT:
It's not too late to tell him the truth.

234
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,740
Then, he'll forgive you.

235
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:48,026
No, I won't.
I'm not going to forgive you guys.

236
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,533
Does it look like my forgiveness
would clear up this issue?

237
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:55,503
What about ZEU AD?
Have you heard from them yet?

238
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,500
Should I call them?

239
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,004
(sighs)

240
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:07,758
(gasps)

241
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,181
Oh, my, this is...

242
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:10,837
(moans in bewilderment)

243
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,928
If Mopix sues us for breach of contract,

244
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,473
we may have to pay tens of billions of won
for compensation.

245
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,679
A new automobile model leaked by
the paparazzi.

246
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,307
-That hasn't happened in a while.
-(Kyungseok scoffs)

247
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:22,564
Planning Team 1 is incredible
in so many ways.

248
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:24,403
I know, right?
(sighs)

249
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:28,030
Shinan AD went belly up
five years ago over the same issue.

250
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,152
Remember that?

251
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,910
Jeez, the mere thought of it
makes me shudder.

252
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:34,874
Oh, boy.

253
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,708
How about Mopix? Did they say anything?

254
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,464
(sighs)

255
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,578
It must've already spread like wildfire

256
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,418
since it was posted
on a popular online forum.

257
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,844
We're in big trouble.

258
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,758
What did the Mopix security team say?

259
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,636
They used a VPN,
so it's impossible to track them down.

260
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,807
We're keeping an eye
on other forums right now.

261
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:59,389
What will you do
about damaging our company image?

262
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:02,476
It will only be a matter of time
before our other clients hear about this.

263
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:06,727
An unknown publisher deleted the post
and the picture right away.

264
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,027
MINHU: But we don't know when
or if they'll repost it.

265
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,741
Some other unexpected situations
could arise too.

266
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:14,202
So I'll keep an eye on it
and take responsibility for this.

267
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,243
(Sunhee sighs)

268
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:17,945
(snorts)
Of course, you should take responsibility.

269
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:20,873
Well, sir.

270
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:24,036
Is Planning Team 1 going to continue
with the Mopix project?

271
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:27,208
True. Since Planning Team 1
broke their trust,

272
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,166
it'll be tough for them
to keep the ball rolling.

273
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,590
If you're going to switch teams,
please let us know as soon as possible.

274
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:35,466
Planning Team 2 will need some time
to prepare too.

275
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,805
Mr. Cha, see me for a minute.

276
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,404
(sighs)

277
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:54,865
Jeez, I knew Planning Team 1
would get themselves in deep water.

278
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,867
It's Mopix's new model
that they're launching.

279
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:58,951
Wasn't it you?

280
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,043
That's nonsense.

281
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:02,537
Was it you?

282
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,463
(slurps)

283
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,793
(scoffs)
I guess...

284
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,342
everyone was just waiting for you
to slip and fall.

285
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,512
My apologies.

286
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,630
I can see...

287
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,680
right through the person's
objective in this.

288
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,930
Am I the only one?

289
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:23,063
They posted and deleted it quickly
before it got out of hand.

290
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,734
Then tipped off Mopix.

291
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,649
You're quick,
so I'm sure you're well aware

292
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:29,531
that their purpose
wasn't to leak the model.

293
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:32,438
(sucks air)
It looks like...

294
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:36,527
someone tried to damage your reputation.

295
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,329
Does anyone come to your mind?

296
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:42,502
(both sigh)

297
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:46,289
I barely managed to quiet down Mopix.

298
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,708
But it'll be tough for Planning Team 1
to avoid the consequences.

299
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,585
I'm fully responsible for this.

300
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:54,415
I'll be sure to hand over the project
to another team ASAP...

301
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:58,178
Are you saying
you're going to drop out of the project?

302
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:02,559
I'd like you to take responsibility
for this

303
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,731
by completing the project successfully.

304
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:08,515
Of course, someone would have
to be held accountable for it.

305
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:16,949
MINHEE: But still, not Ms. Hong...

306
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:18,573
SANGGOO: Mr. Cha.

307
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:22,373
Technically speaking,
Ms. Hong is a victim too.

308
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:25,289
Yes, she failed to stop Director Lee
from taking pictures of the car.

309
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:26,962
That is her fault.

310
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,880
But as we all know,

311
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,999
all directors take pictures
of the new product

312
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:33,126
they'll film before its release.
Isn't that so?

313
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,877
We know they do it,
and we just turn a blind eye.

314
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,391
It's too bad it leaked,

315
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:42,929
but I think it's unfair
to put the entire blame on her...

316
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,305
It's already been decided.

317
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,481
Ms. Hong will drop out
of the Mopix project as of today

318
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,400
and will be dispatched
to Planning Team 2 to support them.

319
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:52,523
Ms. Kim will take over Ms. Hong's tasks.

320
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:53,898
Okay.

321
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:57,404
Ms. Hong, please go to Planning Team 2.

322
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,277
All right.

323
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,746
(sighs deeply)

324
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,585
YESOOL: These files are not
on our shared server.

325
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:19,433
I drafted them just in case,
so take a look if you need them.

326
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:20,639
It will be helpful.

327
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:23,514
Is it okay for me to take this from you?

328
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:27,394
How do I do this without you?

329
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,896
Why not? It's a good opportunity for you.

330
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,810
You'll be fine. No need to whine.

331
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,946
Everyone, I'm fine. Okay?

332
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,199
It's not like I'm getting fired.

333
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:45,242
Enough of this heavy vibe. Please stop.

334
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,543
We feel bad. That's all.

335
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,673
Everyone here knows that you worked
really hard on this project.

336
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:54,339
Goodness, it's okay.
You should've been nicer to me all along.

337
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,339
It worked out for the best.

338
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,841
I failed as the PM on Mopix anyway.

339
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,094
And it's not like
this is the only chance I have.

340
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,096
(sighs)
I'll just have to do better next time.

341
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,388
Ms. Hong.

342
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:08,101
Anyway, I'll get going.
Good luck, everyone.

343
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,272
Work hard for me too.

344
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:12,693
I'll get going.

345
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,029
Shit.

346
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,077
(grunts)

347
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,620
Mr. Cha.

348
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:35,997
How can you leave without saying bye?

349
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:39,843
Jeez, I'm just moving downstairs.

350
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,843
It's not like I'm transferring
to that team permanently.

351
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,795
You're so lax.
(inhales)

352
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:45,505
Is this what I taught you?

353
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,394
I'm sorry.

354
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,064
Why aren't you arguing with me?

355
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:52,687
I thought you'd come
straight to me and ask to reconsider.

356
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,560
Did you finally grow up?

357
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:57,436
Mm.

358
00:21:57,524 --> 00:22:00,074
Someone has to be held accountable,

359
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,782
and I can't deny
that I'm partly responsible for it.

360
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:06,825
And I'm sure you had your reasons

361
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:09,158
for coming to that decision.

362
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,909
Well, I don't want to admit it,

363
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:17,535
but you have never been wrong.

364
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:21,173
(sighs)

365
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:23,757
Don't worry.

366
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,934
Even if they give me a hard time
or pick on me, I'll hang in there.

367
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,562
-I can take care of myself.
-That goes without saying.

368
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:30,849
Of course, I should...

369
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:33,345
Do your job well.

370
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:36,765
If you get sloppy
and shame Planning Team 1's reputation,

371
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,975
never mind transferring you
to another team.

372
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,856
I'll transfer you to another city
in another province. Got it?

373
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:49,662
(scoffs)

374
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:52,663
I mean, I'm leaving the team,
and he still...

375
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,286
(sighs)

376
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,623
Of course.

377
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,501
That's who Cha Minhu is.

378
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,588
Jeez.

379
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,723
(mellow music)

380
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,095
Hello.

381
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:09,348
Hello.

382
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,769
-Your desk.
-YESOOL: Oh, okay.

383
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:15,943
We'll be out for lunch.

384
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,153
Oh, enjoy your lunch.

385
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,440
See you.

386
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:23,364
(mellow music)

387
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,716
(whimpers)

388
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:52,064
(sighs)

389
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,886
(exhales deeply)

390
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:00,734
(sniffles)

391
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:04,691
Dang it. I've been holding back.

392
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:08,242
What's wrong, Hong Yesool? Stop crying.

393
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,123
(sniffles)

394
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:14,406
It's fine.

395
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:18,168
You can do better on Mopix next time.
(sniffles)

396
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:19,923
YESOOL: <i>It's all right.</i>

397
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,415
(Yesool sobbing)

398
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:25,963
YESOOL: What's wrong with you?
So embarrassing.

399
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,180
(Yesool sniffles, sobs)

400
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,548
Why don't you come inside?

401
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:34,216
Oh, no. I feel so at home here.
I like it here...

402
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,636
Thanks anyway.

403
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,314
-We'll stay here. Yes.
-Okay.

404
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:38,642
Thank you.

405
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,480
The atmosphere seems brutal.

406
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,609
So, to sum it up,

407
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:51,114
Ms. Hong Yesool is taking
full responsibility   for this matter?

408
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:52,526
Is that what you're saying?

409
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:54,616
Yes, that's right.

410
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:57,865
(sighing)

411
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:00,918
It wouldn't make any difference
even if I talked to Mopix, would it?

412
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,170
(sighs)

413
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,550
First of all,
I apologize for what happened.

414
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:12,468
It's obviously my fault
that the picture was leaked.

415
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:15,183
I'll cooperate
with the internal investigation.

416
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:18,562
Let's complete
this project successfully first.

417
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:23,189
I believe the PPM video will be crucial
in restoring their faith in us.

418
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:25,357
Don't worry about that.

419
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,530
I'm going to nail it.

420
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:34,696
That's the only thing I can
do to help Ms. Hong return to your team.

421
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:38,535
Also, can you check
with Ms. Oh Jiyoung and find out

422
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,160
if she's available for the PPM video?

423
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:43,377
(inhales deeply)
I'll convince Oh Jiyoung.

424
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,590
Please do your best
in preparing for the shoot, Director.

425
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,420
All right. Then we'll prepare accordingly.

426
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,165
All right then.

427
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:54,182
Can I ask you something?

428
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:59,305
(sucks air)
By chance, did Ms. Hong...

429
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:03,015
cry?

430
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:10,486
(breathes deeply)

431
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,569
(light music)

432
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,118
YESOOL

433
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:20,201
(light music)

434
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,130
(sighs)

435
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:30,878
(sighs deeply)

436
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:34,296
SUNHEE: What?

437
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,103
-No one has any other ideas?
-(mumbles)

438
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:40,598
It's a new brand, so there aren't
many reference materials...

439
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,182
(sighs)

440
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:45,437
As far as I know, Miracle was started
by Ciotem's product development team

441
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,060
after they broke off from Ciotem.

442
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:49,817
I presume they're currently developing
their own skincare products.

443
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:51,149
I'll share the competitor

444
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:53,614
and market analysis
over the last three years.

445
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:55,914
Okay. Um...

446
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:57,988
(clears throat)
Uh-huh.

447
00:26:58,074 --> 00:26:59,784
(breathes deeply)

448
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:05,333
And print out the documents we'll be using

449
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:08,205
at the lingerie PPM...

450
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:11,713
I've already made 20 copies
and I emailed them to you as well.

451
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:15,052
Oh, there were a lot of typos,
so I corrected them all.

452
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,553
(laughs awkwardly)

453
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,307
(woman clears throat)

454
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,557
Okay, you may go now.

455
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:26,767
Yes.

456
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,987
(door opens, closes)

457
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,820
(sighs deeply)

458
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,740
You think this is a coffee shop?

459
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:43,453
(coughs)

460
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:45,909
Shit, I'm about to lose it.

461
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,707
-Mm.
-Hello.

462
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,001
-Sit, sit, sit.
-Okay.

463
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,844
(inhales deeply)
Well...

464
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:55,089
Here are about 50 reference videos.

465
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:58,842
Can you check and see if there's anything
useful for any of the time slots?

466
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,427
Oh, I did that already.

467
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:03,847
You should check these out too.

468
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,392
There were a lot of references,
but you didn't use them.

469
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,600
Oh, I also shared some files with you.
Please check them out as well.

470
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,558
(laughs)

471
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:15,398
Planning Team 1 always wastes time
and energy gathering useless references.

472
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,025
(laughs)

473
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,532
So you don't need them?

474
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:22,333
Oh, dear.
I'll take them since you put in the work.

475
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,834
I'll look through them.

476
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,260
(chewing ice)

477
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,221
(sighs)

478
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:39,882
Jeez, what a pill.
(chewing ice)

479
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,600
Whoa. Shit, I want her on my team.

480
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:43,889
(slurps)

481
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:48,023
How did Cha Minhu train her?
She carries her weight and then some.

482
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:50,228
-(chuckles)
-(Sunhee sighs)

483
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:53,824
(sighs)
How's Hong Yesool?

484
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,529
Intense, isn't she?

485
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:57,778
I think it's going to take
a long time to teach her.

486
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:00,281
She didn't learn much from Team 1.

487
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,410
(snorting) Really?

488
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,276
(slurps)

489
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:09,246
I think you went a little too far
this time.

490
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,370
Huh?

491
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:11,922
What are you talking about?

492
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,840
Leaking the new model is going too far.
Good thing Mopix let it go at that.

493
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,011
It was too risky for the agency.

494
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:20,836
(scoffs)

495
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:23,218
What are you talking about?

496
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:25,722
(sucks air)

497
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,181
Hey, Sunhee.

498
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:31,057
Stop barking up the wrong tree.
Get back to work.

499
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,354
Okay?

500
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:33,437
(clicks tongue)

501
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,055
I'm off.

502
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:37,185
(chuckles)

503
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,355
(laughs)

504
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,323
-(humming)
-My goodness.

505
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,110
(scoffs)

506
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:47,914
SEUNGTAEK: <i>Howoo, please answer the phone.</i>

507
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:51,584
<i>I miss you, Howoo.
Are we really over? For real?</i>

508
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:54,214
(sighs deeply)
Why won't you read my messages?

509
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,338
<i>I'm sorry about everything.</i>

510
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:00,631
<i>Howoo, we didn't break up for real,
did we?</i>

511
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:05,597
Doctor.

512
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:07,723
Doc...

513
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:14,848
(gasps)

514
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,358
Shit, you startled me.

515
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,188
Mind your manners, man!

516
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:20,444
Why did you clap like that?
You rude bastard.

517
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:24,197
The students assigned to internal medicine
are waiting for you over there.

518
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,620
They want to say hello to you.

519
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:30,659
Hey, do I have to bother training students
at my level? Do I? Huh? Hey!

520
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:32,749
I apologize, sir.

521
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,329
(sighs deeply)

522
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:36,668
Seriously.

523
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,920
Where are they? (sighs)

524
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,633
They're all over there.

525
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:43,968
-Don't startle me like that again.
-I won't.

526
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:49,097
This way, sir.

527
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:50,676
Hi.

528
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:52,524
-Hello, Doctor.
-Hello, Doctor.

529
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,690
Did you guys eat?

530
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:55,058
-Yes, we did.
-Yes.

531
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:56,604
What did you eat?

532
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:57,558
(pants)

533
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:58,687
Dang it.

534
00:30:58,773 --> 00:30:59,773
(pants)

535
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,278
-I'm sorry!
-Frog meat.

536
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,239
I'm sorry, sir!
(pants)

537
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,609
(exhales deeply)

538
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:05,856
Oh!

539
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:07,913
How do you do, Doctor?

540
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:10,028
(sighs)

541
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:11,825
Huh?

542
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:15,365
Huh?

543
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,880
YESOOL: <i>My boyfriend?</i>

544
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,131
Yes.

545
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:23,632
The man who gave us the details
about the incident.

546
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:24,875
Isn't he your boyfriend?

547
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:28,218
Wow, he was... He was quite a talker.

548
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,263
8:42 p.m. Sara Kim
is the owner of the house.

549
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:33,847
It happened
at the tenant Hong Yesool's house.

550
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:36,603
Based on the strides,
I presume the perpetrator

551
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:38,856
is 172 cm tall with a shoe size 275.
I think it's a man.

552
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:41,318
Considering the sounds
of his running footsteps were nonstop,

553
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,319
he likely figured out
an escape route beforehand.

554
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,821
So it's highly probable
that he's either someone familiar

555
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,324
with the area or a resident there.

556
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:49,701
Aren't you writing this down?

557
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:51,953
I will.
(clears throat)

558
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:54,292
Have you checked the surveillance cameras

559
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,660
at the convenience store, intersection,
and shopping center near her house?

560
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:59,128
Oh, is there a surveillance camera
at the shopping center?

561
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,998
Yes, there's one in the
second-floor office

562
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,295
for staff surveillance.

563
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:04,088
It captures the street as well.

564
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,972
If that's his escape route,

565
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,629
he must've been caught on that camera.

566
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:10,224
Ah, so there is
a surveillance camera there.

567
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,513
I got it.

568
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:17,557
OFFICER: You know, I felt like
I was being questioned by him.

569
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:20,234
He described it so well in so much detail.

570
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,068
And he sometimes scolded us too.

571
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,151
(laughs awkwardly)

572
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:29,453
By the way,
does your boyfriend work in this field?

573
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:32,240
He has to be a profiler, at the least?

574
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:35,496
(laughs awkwardly)

575
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:44,169
Boyfriend...

576
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,170
(sighs)

577
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:48,216
Jeez.

578
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:50,966
(siren wailing)

579
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,682
(indistinct chatter)

580
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:07,895
MINHU: Please move the latch for
the grid window guard to somewhere else.

581
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:08,946
Oh, okay.

582
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:10,568
-Oh, and one more thing.
-Yes?

583
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:12,374
Oh, hey.

584
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:17,538
The camera's blind spot is too wide.
We need to adjust the angle a bit.

585
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,504
All right. Look.

586
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,670
Here.

587
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:22,125
I'm not in the frame.

588
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:23,542
Oh, you're right.

589
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:27,548
(snaps)

590
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,719
(tires screech)

591
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,683
I don't sleep with a woman
I'm not interested in.

592
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:42,596
So, go out with me
if you want to sleep with me.

593
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:43,767
Are you sure you're okay?

594
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:48,646
MINHU: Yes, please do that.

595
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,645
I installed the CCTV app.

596
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:54,615
You'll get an alert
when someone opens or closes

597
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,529
the windows, so check that frequently.

598
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:58,657
Oh, right. The windows on the veranda
are triple-pane windows,

599
00:33:58,745 --> 00:33:59,945
so don't forget to close them.

600
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,416
Hey, are you listening to me?

601
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,512
Mr. Cha, do you like me?

602
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:11,835
Yeah.

603
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:17,313
I left your bedroom windows open
to test the alarm system.

604
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:21,522
So be sure to close them.
I'm leaving. Uh-huh. Yeah. Okay.

605
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:24,903
(romantic music)

606
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:26,019
(gasps)

607
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,650
(pants)

608
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,322
(sighs)

609
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:40,866
(pants)
Since when?

610
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,116
Since I joined Planning Team 1?

611
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:45,579
When was that? Five years ago?

612
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,754
And when you saved me
at the pop-up store...

613
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:50,205
Were you watching me the whole time
because you like me?

614
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:51,546
If you have feelings for me,

615
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:53,131
why didn't you grab me
when I fell down the stairs?

616
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,974
Do you know how embarrassed I was then?

617
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,720
When I was in charge
of the Billy campaign too.

618
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,603
I mean, you could've talked to me nicely,
and I'd still get what you mean.

619
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,309
But you were constantly angry
and yelled at me.

620
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:02,559
How can you do that
to a woman you're interested in?

621
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:05,482
-Are you a psychopath, Mr. Cha?
-Hey, Hong Yesool.

622
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,113
Oh.

623
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:10,149
(stuttering)
So... what I mean is...

624
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,483
Are you done asking?

625
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:14,027
(sighs)

626
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,452
I think I started liking you
from the time you joined the company.

627
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,571
But to be honest,
I started realizing it not long ago.

628
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:21,538
What happened at the pop-up store
was more of an instinctive reaction

629
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,199
rather than my feelings for you.

630
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,457
And the reason I didn't grab you
on the stairs

631
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:25,829
is because I wasn't feeling well that day.

632
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:27,495
Well, even if I explained it to you,
you wouldn't understand it.

633
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:28,543
So I'll pass for now.

634
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:29,836
And what else?

635
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:31,299
Oh, am I a psychopath?

636
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:34,259
Well? I just set aside
my personal feelings when I was at work.

637
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,300
If the woman I was interested in
was competent,

638
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:39,974
I wouldn't have had to get angry and yell.
I think it was a shame too.

639
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,428
Anything else you want to know? No?

640
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,811
Then, can I ask you one thing?

641
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:48,651
When are you going to give me an answer?

642
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:52,775
As you can see,
I'm not very good at waiting.

643
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:56,199
PILYO: Don't answer him.

644
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:03,703
You should take as much time
as you want in a situation like this.

645
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:05,288
That way, he'll agonize more.

646
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:08,789
Right, Mr. Cha?

647
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:11,085
(upbeat music)

648
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:21,007
(Yesool grunts)

649
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:23,684
I thought it was a line from a movie.

650
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,850
Are you going to use it
in your movie again?

651
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:28,063
No, not this one. This one offends me.

652
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,024
It would've been better
if you had just gone on your way.

653
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:31,864
PILYO: Unfortunately,
I was headed that way.

654
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:34,819
Wow, we're totally in sync.
You want to go out with me?

655
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,149
I win.

656
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:39,775
-That's enough, guys.
-(sighs)

657
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,624
You kicked her out of the team
in the morning,

658
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,369
yet you're asking her out in the evening?

659
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:44,701
Are you a psychopath or something?

660
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:47,075
I guess you forgot who caused the mess?

661
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,963
Do you have Alzheimer's or something?

662
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,330
Wow, we're even mirroring
each other's lines.

663
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,877
You sure you don't want to go out with me?
I even own a house in Seoul.

664
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:55,051
So do I.

665
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,300
I like this guy even more.

666
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,335
Have a drink.

667
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:02,676
No, Mr. Cha can't drink.

668
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:07,175
Oh, that's right.
Now, my memory is coming back.

669
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:09,346
I've heard that you can't drink.

670
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:10,515
(sighs)

671
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:13,313
You look as if you'd still be standing
after drinking a case of hard liquor,

672
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,317
but I heard you're a “one-shot wonder.”

673
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,109
But you managed
to survive in this industry

674
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,363
without wining-and-dining
with your clients, thanks to your talent.

675
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:21,735
(cheeky music)

676
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,200
(laughs awkwardly)

677
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,039
Are you crazy?

678
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:32,122
You can't drink, either, Director.

679
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:34,666
Oh, right.
(laughs)

680
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:36,132
I've heard that too.
(laughs)

681
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:39,722
That her ex often passes out
on the streets after just one drink.

682
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:42,719
How embarrassed she was
and what a nuisance he was.

683
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,552
(laughs)

684
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,274
That's not true.

685
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:48,768
I can handle my liquor.

686
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:49,889
People call me "Tomato"

687
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,096
because I can keep drinking
until my face turns red.

688
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:54,435
People call me "Sunflower"

689
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,442
because I can drink
until the sun comes up.

690
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:00,151
Let's have a drink.

691
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:01,486
Sure.

692
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:06,700
(both slurp)

693
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:10,541
(Pilyo exclaims deeply)

694
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,205
Hey, Tomato.

695
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:18,341
Sunflower.

696
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,380
-Oh, man. What happened?
-(moans in frustration)

697
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:23,336
ASSISTANT: What?

698
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:24,678
All this?

699
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:27,309
Our director is a one-shot wonder.

700
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:28,808
No, I drank this one.

701
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:30,099
-Oh.
-(laughs awkwardly)

702
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:32,642
-I see.
-It just happened that way.

703
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,401
Still, I'm glad you came,
Assistant Director.

704
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,479
(chuckles awkwardly)

705
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:39,444
Oh, yes. I was so surprised
when I got your call.

706
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:41,856
Well, Director.

707
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:45,244
-(groans)
-Wake up, Director Lee.

708
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:47,408
(sighs)

709
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:50,951
I guess he drank a lot
because he felt bad for you.

710
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:54,872
He was extremely worried when he heard
that you were transferred to another team.

711
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:56,497
He didn't even eat all day.

712
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:01,214
I'm fine. Please take him home.

713
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:04,297
(chuckling awkwardly)
Okay. We'll go ahead. Okay.

714
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:11,563
(both chuckle awkwardly)

715
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:14,061
-Good night.
-(chuckles awkwardly)

716
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:15,943
-Director Lee.
-(groans)

717
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,440
Get up, Director Lee.

718
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:19,401
-(grunts)
-(Pilyo moans)

719
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:22,032
-Let's go. Jeez, Director Lee.
-PILYO: I'm sorry.

720
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:24,569
(grunts)

721
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:26,703
-ASSISTANT: See you!
-Well, bye.

722
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:27,911
ASSISTANT: Bye.

723
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:30,790
-PILYO: Oh, boy. This is killing me.
-All right. Hang in there a little bit.

724
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:33,578
-Man.
-(Pilyo groans)

725
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:37,962
What do I do about this Sunflower...

726
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:44,299
-Jeez, seriously!
-(Minhu groans)

727
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:50,553
WOMAN (on phone):
<i>The customer is not answering the phone.</i>

728
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:53,768
<i>Please try again later.</i>

729
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:54,849
OH SEUNGTAEK

730
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,064
(sighing)
Dang it.

731
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:58,017
This is crazy.

732
00:39:58,938 --> 00:39:59,808
Mr. Cha.

733
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,855
Mr. Cha? Please wake up.

734
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,065
Mr. Cha, your passcode is...

735
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,160
(sighs)

736
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:10,737
Hey.

737
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,075
Cha Minhu.

738
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:14,949
Get up. I said, get up!

739
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:20,918
(moans in frustration)
Sunflower, my ass. Shit.

740
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,299
Here we are at Tri Palace.

741
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:30,256
Oh.

742
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:35,354
I'm sorry, but please go back
to Myeongdong.

743
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:37,018
TAXI DRIVER: Okay.

744
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:42,152
(Yesool grunts)

745
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:45,112
Shit, so heavy.

746
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,395
Why won't he pick up?

747
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:51,072
(grunts)

748
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:53,827
Seriously.
(sighs)

749
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,790
(sighs deeply)

750
00:40:56,579 --> 00:41:00,289
Dang it, what did I do
in my past life to deserve this?

751
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:03,134
(panting)

752
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:07,719
What an asshole. Does he really like me?

753
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:09,884
(grunts)

754
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,137
I really don't think so.

755
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:15,683
(sighs)

756
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:25,565
Hey.

757
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,192
Cha Minhu.

758
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:28,395
(sighs)

759
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,149
You're not asleep, are you?

760
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,488
Are you sure you like me?

761
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,454
Huh?

762
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,540
(sighs)

763
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:40,504
You're so weird.

764
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:43,541
You ask me to go out with you
out of the blue.

765
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:47,546
Then today, you tell me you like me.

766
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:49,968
Sure.

767
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:54,550
I guess we do get into a relationship,
as you said.

768
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:58,723
Jeez, that's crazy.

769
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:01,394
How could you and me...

770
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:04,689
(sighs)

771
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:09,693
But I looked happy.

772
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,105
It was my first time...

773
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,284
seeing myself happy...

774
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,294
in the future that I foresaw.

775
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:22,412
(light music)

776
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:25,499
(birds chirping)

777
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:57,032
(light music continues)

778
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:15,129
(light music fades)

779
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:31,568
(whirring)

780
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,740
(buzzing)

781
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:39,034
(indistinct chatter)

782
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:44,866
Just coming in?

783
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,040
Are you feeling okay?

784
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,285
Yeah.

785
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:50,666
How much did I drink last night?

786
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:52,883
I was at your place when I woke up.

787
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:56,932
Mr. Cha, you have only one friend.

788
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:59,049
But Dr. Oh didn't pick up.

789
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:01,433
So, what else could I do?

790
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:03,273
I don't know
your front door passcode, either.

791
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:05,349
So I had no choice
but to take you to my place.

792
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,900
(sighs)
Last night...

793
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:09,768
You feel awfully sorry, don't you?

794
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:12,647
Do you know what I went through
last night because of you?

795
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:14,188
(sighs)

796
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:17,323
Oh, I have a meeting to attend.
So I'll get going.

797
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:18,454
Good day.

798
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,366
YESOOL: Thanks for the coffee.

799
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:22,990
Hey, Yesool.

800
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:23,987
(sighs)

801
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:27,001
(sighs)

802
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:33,208
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR KIM YOONSOO

803
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:34,919
Yes?

804
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:39,723
It's nice and relaxing at Team 2,
isn't it?

805
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:43,512
We always get off on time
since we never win any bids.

806
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:46,887
(sucks air)
Hey.

807
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:51,769
Have you made any progress
with Cha Minhu since that night?

808
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,440
We'll talk later.

809
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:57,112
Dang it, I'm curious.

810
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:58,744
He demoted you
and sent you to another team

811
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:00,361
while you have a thing for each other.

812
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:02,488
I guess you could be confused.

813
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:03,874
It even confuses me now.

814
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:05,993
What's with that guy?

815
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:08,746
Be quiet. Come on. We're at work.

816
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,330
Just throw yourself at him.

817
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:14,548
-You know how I am, right?
-SUNHEE: Goodness.

818
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:16,418
What are you huddling around for?

819
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:24,596
Planning Team 1 did an ad
for Comfort Lingerie, right?

820
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:26,643
Can you get me the files on that?

821
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:28,272
Yes, will do.

822
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:31,019
And Eomji. You're always so busy

823
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:33,813
collaborating with others, huh?

824
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:35,571
Sorry? What do you...

825
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:36,689
(whispers)
Go.

826
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:47,158
-What did you just say?
-(Minhee sobs)

827
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:48,874
The weather was fine
when we were on the way here.

828
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:50,334
I guess it only rained here.

829
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,504
This is crazy.

830
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,962
Minhee, why didn't you check the weather?

831
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:57,342
(raising her voice)
I did check the weather forecast.

832
00:45:57,671 --> 00:46:00,841
It's not raining now,
but the ground is a muddy mess.

833
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:03,434
We're supposed to film a driving car.
The muddy ground won't work!

834
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:05,140
The assistant director also double-checked

835
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,100
the weather forecast
and said it'd be fine.

836
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:08,681
It was a shower. Out of nowhere.

837
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:11,936
I know you can't help the weather.
I'm just saying, why didn't you check!

838
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:13,979
I'm saying this
because we have to shoot it today.

839
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:16,902
My god. What do I do?
Yesool isn't here, either.

840
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:18,152
(whining)
Ah, what do we do...

841
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:20,107
Damn it.

842
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:24,164
For now, I'll ask Director Lee

843
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:27,449
if we can revise the concept
and get back to you.

844
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:30,624
Well, all right. Let me figure
something out and call you back.

845
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:31,584
Bye.

846
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:35,583
Do we have to cancel the shoot?
I'm going crazy here. (sighs)

847
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,673
What's going on?

848
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:40,707
Ms. Hong. I'm going nuts.

849
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:41,918
What do I do?

850
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:43,426
What's wrong?

851
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:46,006
(Pilyo sighs)

852
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:48,184
PILYO:
Didn't you check the weather forecast?

853
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:51,733
ASSISTANT: I did.
But the shower came down out of nowhere.

854
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:53,564
What's Plan B then?

855
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:58,022
I'm sorry. We had to change
the location in a rush, so...

856
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:01,322
(sighing)
This is driving me nuts.

857
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:02,862
JIYOUNG: So...

858
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:06,701
Are we shooting or not?

859
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,500
This is why I hate working with amateurs.

860
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:13,829
Amateur?

861
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:16,878
You're an amateur in advertising.

862
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:19,549
This is your first commercial.

863
00:47:19,878 --> 00:47:24,298
And you're making it so obvious
that it's your first time.

864
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:25,973
(Pilyo scoffs)

865
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:28,601
Wow, what you're saying is correct.
But you sure like to rub it in.

866
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:31,561
I said that intentionally to rub it in.

867
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,850
Ah...

868
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:35,853
I mean, play an old man,
someone bald and whatnot.

869
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:38,396
I ended up coming anyway
since I didn't have to do that.

870
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:40,152
(sighs)

871
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:41,442
But what the heck is this?

872
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:44,444
Hurry up and find another location.

873
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:46,533
Yes, will do.

874
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:50,239
I'm extremely sensitive right now

875
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:52,945
because I had to get up early
this morning to get my full makeup on.

876
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:55,866
I mean, this is for PPM
and not even for the actual commercial.

877
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:57,576
Even though I was so annoyed,
I still came.

878
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:59,706
But what is this?

879
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:00,963
(sighs deeply)

880
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:03,923
Hey, where's Minhu?

881
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:06,166
Excuse me? Oh, just a minute.

882
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:10,795
Will you finish shooting tonight?

883
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:13,268
Yes, it'll wrap up by midnight
at the latest.

884
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:14,268
(chuckles awkwardly)

885
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:17,559
I sent the official document
to the head office, so please check.

886
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:19,104
I trust you.

887
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:28,779
LOCATION MANAGER:
I've worked with you before, Mr. Cha.

888
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:31,744
Just clean up afterward
like you did last time.

889
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:33,445
-Thank you.
-Sure.

890
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:35,294
SANGGOO: Mr. Cha?

891
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:37,958
Oh, Mr. Cha!

892
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:41,002
Mr. Kang, how did you know to come here?

893
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:44,004
Ms. Hong told me. She said
it's the same place we shot the camera ad.

894
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:45,134
But...

895
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:48,343
you two worked together on that, right?

896
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:50,675
I suppose great minds think alike.

897
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:52,643
(laughs)

898
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:55,467
DAEHAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL PHYSICIAN

899
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:57,137
TRAINING GROUP 3
NAME: BAN HOWOO

900
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:00,439
(smacking lips)

901
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,440
I'm sorry, sir!
(pants)

902
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:04,022
-(exhales deeply)
-Oh!

903
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:06,486
How do you do, Doctor?

904
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:10,065
(sighs)

905
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:13,079
BAN HOWOO

906
00:49:13,825 --> 00:49:14,945
(tuts)

907
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:16,794
Ban Howoo.

908
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:20,710
The clinical training pre-test,
skills lab, CPX, and OSCE.

909
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,631
She ranked on top on all of them?

910
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:24,749
Yes. I heard
she's at the top of her class.

911
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:26,246
But also in this group.

912
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:31,549
(sighs)
Is this why?

913
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:35,005
She picks things up quickly.
She understands things fast too.

914
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:37,350
Speedy dating, speedy breakup.

915
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:39,772
So fast. So quick.
She does everything so fast.

916
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:43,191
Do you know Ban Howoo?

917
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:45,361
Huh?

918
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:47,481
No.

919
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:49,742
Let's do our rounds.

920
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:05,669
The chart.

921
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:09,835
Just a minute.

922
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:11,763
PATIENT MEDICAL RECORD

923
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,932
I know it was right here...

924
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:15,804
(inhales deeply)

925
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:18,722
It's glioma.

926
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:21,727
He got surgery three days ago,
and he felt rigid briefly after that.

927
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:24,270
But everything, including BP,
was normal last night.

928
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:26,521
(sighs)

929
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:28,732
Be sure to take care of your charts.

930
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:32,066
Must you get scolded
in front of these kids?

931
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:34,195
My apologies.

932
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,080
(Howoo clears throat)

933
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,370
(sighs)

934
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:45,923
Oh!

935
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:51,133
Where... did I see you?

936
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:52,670
What are you talking about?

937
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:58,761
(sucks air)

938
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:02,979
HOWOO: Jeez, this is crazy!

939
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,350
Why are they all here?

940
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:11,485
Doctor. Good evening.

941
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:13,993
(chuckles awkwardly)

942
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:16,241
Well, take care.

943
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:17,993
Hey, Ban Howoo.

944
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:21,907
Did you break up with me just to be here
as a student?

945
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:24,333
Hey.

946
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:26,707
How come everything is so easy for you?

947
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:28,844
Date for a week and then just drop me.

948
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:31,629
How long will you pretend not to know me?

949
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:35,053
Was I really nothing to you?

950
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:37,011
Did a week mean nothing to you?

951
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:38,264
(exhales deeply)

952
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:47,270
Why are you being so clingy?

953
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:50,072
Didn't we promise we'd do that
before we started dating?

954
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:53,364
We'd end up breaking up
when the chemistry between us is over.

955
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:55,073
If we break up when the dopamine runs out,

956
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:57,323
it's nice since
we'd only carry good memories with us.

957
00:51:57,405 --> 00:51:58,485
Plus...

958
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:02,081
I may just be a student to you,

959
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,540
but becoming a doctor...

960
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:06,206
is in my lifetime bucket list.

961
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:09,999
Okay. Then what about me?

962
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:12,839
You were on my bucket list for the week.

963
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:16,010
I'm not interested in risking everything
on an unproductive relationship.

964
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:20,103
So don't act like you know me, Doctor.

965
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:23,179
Are you serious?

966
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:30,226
I'm asking one last time.
(sighs)

967
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:32,898
If that's what you want,

968
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:35,243
I'll treat you like a stranger
until the end.

969
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:37,398
(sighs)

970
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:38,527
Answer me.

971
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:43,914
Yes, Doctor.

972
00:52:44,786 --> 00:52:46,616
I'll get going then.

973
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:48,705
(light music)

974
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:57,506
(sighs)

975
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:03,597
(sighs)

976
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:13,515
(deep inhale)

977
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:25,407
Cut, cut, cut.
(sighs)

978
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:28,294
Let's review this.

979
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:31,035
We'll review this!

980
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:32,504
Why did he say cut?

981
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:33,918
MANAGER: I thought it was good.

982
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:35,091
Play back.

983
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:36,709
Please play it back for him!

984
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:44,511
(sucks teeth)
I don't think this is working.

985
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:45,806
Let's take a break.

986
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:49,893
ASSISTANT: We'll take a break.

987
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:51,135
Have a seat, Jiyoung.

988
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:52,848
-Have a seat.
-Sit down and watch, Jiyoung.

989
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:55,318
-It looks good.
-Yeah, it's pretty good.

990
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:58,028
(clamoring)

991
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:03,365
(tuts)

992
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:05,155
(sighs deeply)

993
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:07,826
Don't you like their food?

994
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:11,624
You got up early this morning
to get your makeup done

995
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:14,376
and came all the way here
just to shoot a PPM video. You should eat.

996
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,745
I can't eat stuff like this.

997
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:20,125
I've never even been
to a place like this, either.

998
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:23,553
So why would you be sitting
at a place like this

999
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:25,095
when you can't even eat these things?

1000
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:26,715
(sighs)

1001
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:29,386
Where's Mr. Cha?

1002
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:32,095
I came because I heard he was coming.

1003
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:35,111
(coughs)
Oh, I know.

1004
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:38,108
I was also wondering where he was.

1005
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:39,731
He's not picking up, either.

1006
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:41,278
Maybe he went home first.

1007
00:54:41,569 --> 00:54:43,449
Just try calling him.

1008
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:47,372
Mr. Cha doesn't usually join us
for gatherings.

1009
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:48,540
That's right.

1010
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:51,158
There's another person
who doesn't come to places like this.

1011
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:54,078
Mr. Cha and you seem
to have a lot in common.

1012
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:56,841
(chuckles)

1013
00:54:57,627 --> 00:54:58,707
Director Lee.

1014
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:01,335
You don't like me, do you?

1015
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:05,388
No, I do like you.
You're Oh Jiyoung, the great actress.

1016
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:07,797
Since you're my model now, I'll try

1017
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:09,927
my best to like you
even if I don't, somehow.

1018
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:12,102
(scoffs)

1019
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:14,641
(gulps)

1020
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:19,612
Ms. Oh. I watched the monitor earlier,

1021
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:22,861
-and you were so beautiful on the screen.
-SANGGOO: Yes.

1022
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:25,574
So how was today's shoot? Was it okay?

1023
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:28,449
Was it tough for you since I'm an amateur?

1024
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:32,326
(snorts)
Director, you don't easily let go, huh?

1025
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:34,542
Oh! How did you know?

1026
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:37,292
I hold a grudge, and I'm petty.
I have a good memory too.

1027
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:38,995
I'm an amateur, you know.

1028
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:40,245
(scoffs)

1029
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:43,172
(Sanggoo laughing)
All right, guys. Cheers.

1030
00:55:43,256 --> 00:55:45,546
-Let's have a toast. Your glass is empty.
-(Roma laughs)

1031
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:49,393
Cheers. Good work, everyone.
(laughs)

1032
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:53,730
What?

1033
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:55,478
They're already done.

1034
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:57,274
I shouldn't have come.

1035
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:08,202
What brings you here?

1036
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:13,123
Oh, I came to watch the shoot,
but they're done already.

1037
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,120
Did it go well?

1038
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:17,165
Everyone is having dinner nearby, right?

1039
00:56:17,248 --> 00:56:19,628
I should go too.
I was craving a drink anyway.

1040
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:21,923
We still have something
to talk about, don't we?

1041
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:24,920
(sighs)

1042
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:34,056
Last night, you didn't give me an answer.

1043
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:37,097
Oh, that.

1044
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:40,226
I'll have to think about it some more.

1045
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:41,483
No, not that.

1046
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:45,066
You know what I'm talking about.

1047
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:47,858
Oh.

1048
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:52,619
So what happens to you and me?

1049
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:56,042
You saw it all.

1050
00:56:58,873 --> 00:57:00,463
YESOOL: <i>But I looked happy.</i>

1051
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:03,251
It was my first time...

1052
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:05,670
seeing myself happy...

1053
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:08,837
in the future that I foresaw.

1054
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:14,179
(sighs)

1055
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:17,345
Can I really...

1056
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:21,019
believe this?

1057
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:30,781
MINHU: Were we happy?

1058
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:41,326
You said you saw our future.

1059
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:45,337
Were we really happy?

1060
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:47,167
I don't know

1061
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:51,426
if the future I saw is really true,

1062
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:55,181
or if I remember it wrong
because I was too drunk that night.

1063
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:03,267
You want to see it again?

1064
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:08,400
You can double-check.

1065
00:58:11,362 --> 00:58:13,702
Why? Are you scared?

1066
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:16,951
The fact that I'm in your future?

1067
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:19,661
No.

1068
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:26,133
This time, you suggested it first.

1069
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:30,174
(light music)

1070
00:58:40,975 --> 00:58:43,845
Oh, you're up.
Go sit over there. Don't come.

1071
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:45,357
No, go over there.

1072
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:47,442
I want to look cool to you.

1073
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:50,244
(romantic music)

1074
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:58,831
(romantic music continues)

1075
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:04,786
MINHU: Did you see it?

1076
00:59:10,296 --> 00:59:12,296
(romantic music continues)

1077
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:03,434
(romantic music continues)

1078
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:28,173
(romantic music fades)

1079
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:34,919
So what happens to us
in the future that you foresee?

1080
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:38,183
Huh?

1081
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:48,233
Shall we start dating?

1082
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:52,186
(cheerful music)

1083
01:00:52,273 --> 01:00:53,983
As you said, Mr. Cha...

1084
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:56,822
let's date.

1085
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:04,992
(closing theme music)
