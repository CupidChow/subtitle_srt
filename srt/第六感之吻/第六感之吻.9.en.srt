1
00:00:01,042 --> 00:00:03,502
(panting)

2
00:00:03,586 --> 00:00:04,546
(groans)

3
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:09,047
(heartbeats rapidly)

4
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:15,596
(foreboding music)

5
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:18,889
(finger snaps)

6
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:23,442
("You Make Me" playing)

7
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:30,157
(foreboding music)

8
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:36,452
MINHU: Hong Yesool!

9
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:42,167
Damn it.

10
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:50,434
(Minhu panting)

11
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:57,967
You didn't pick up your phone!
What are you doing here by yourself?

12
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:00,766
Why are you worried about me?

13
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,772
I thought we decided to break up.

14
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:04,404
You're going to keep this up?

15
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,567
(breathes heavily)

16
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,744
Let's go. Let's go and talk.

17
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,450
What are you doing?

18
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:15,741
(theme music)

19
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,287
EPISODE 09

20
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:09,708
YESOOL: Mr. Cha, that hurts.

21
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,666
Please slow down.

22
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,587
Let go! I said, let go of me!

23
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,385
(panting)

24
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,890
How did you even know I was there?

25
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,177
Do you have a GPS on me or something?

26
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,146
Are you really going to break up with me?

27
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:29,317
You wouldn't listen to me,
and you wouldn't even let me explain.

28
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,189
Did you see something about me, by chance?

29
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,112
I didn't see anything.

30
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:36,065
You're the one who kissed another woman.

31
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,789
(foreboding music)

32
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:47,834
What's wrong?

33
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,131
YESOOL: Are you sick?

34
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,012
You've got cold sweat...

35
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,509
Are you all right? Should I call for help?

36
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,217
No. I need to take my medicine.

37
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,305
(panting)

38
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:02,679
Medicine?

39
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:04,805
(breathes heavily)

40
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,478
(light music)

41
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:25,002
Do you have a serious illness?

42
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,040
You had a lot of pill bottles
in your room, too.

43
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,250
Do you have an illness
you can't tell me about?

44
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:35,344
Where does it hurt?

45
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:37,966
I just...

46
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,720
collapse easily.

47
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:42,175
YESOOL: What?

48
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:45,675
Is it like anemia? Feeling dizzy?

49
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,519
No.

50
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:51,358
I just collapse when I kiss someone.

51
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:54,938
(stammers)
What?

52
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,990
What's that supposed to mean?
You collapse when you kiss someone?

53
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,819
You see the future when you kiss someone.

54
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:05,158
I'm like that. Just like you.

55
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,671
And...

56
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,839
I'm about to tell you one more thing...

57
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:14,956
you'll find hard to believe.

58
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,973
YESOOL: <i>I'm a little stunned right now.</i>

59
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,258
Yes, I understand.

60
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,894
But that's how I am.

61
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,596
So, you really feel better

62
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,645
when we're like this?

63
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:32,614
MINHU: Yes.

64
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,781
If I hear your heartbeat
or hear your chatter,

65
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:36,988
then I feel even better.

66
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,030
No way.

67
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:42,869
If you want to hold my hand,
just say that.

68
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,409
Why is he saying such a weird thing
when he's sick?

69
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,330
You can choose not to believe me,
but it's true.

70
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:52,134
Should I call Oh Seungtaek
and have him confirm?

71
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,296
Dr. Oh knows about it, too?

72
00:04:58,715 --> 00:04:59,665
Well...

73
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:04,178
is there such an illness
where you get sick if you kiss someone?

74
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:08,136
I mean, we've kissed
so many times thus far.

75
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,098
Then were you sick every time we kissed?

76
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,728
(whimsical music)

77
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:15,607
(gasps)

78
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:20,356
(rain pattering)

79
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:22,702
No way.

80
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,119
(Yesool breathes deeply)
Wait.

81
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,991
-Hey...
-Don't...

82
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,499
Don't scream.

83
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,498
That's right.

84
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,667
Mr. Cha did seem a little off then.

85
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,881
(light music)

86
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,141
But he was fine then.

87
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,426
I said I'm okay if you're with me.

88
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,601
We were together that day.

89
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:53,227
I do find this a bit ridiculous, but...

90
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,565
So is this what you meant
when you said you'll explain everything?

91
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,744
And Ms. Oh Jiyoung knew all of this too?

92
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,702
Jiyoung is the daughter of the doctor
who's treating me.

93
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,116
I've been like this
ever since I was young.

94
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,538
Jiyoung also knows
that my pain is relieved...

95
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,583
when you're with me.

96
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:20,299
YESOOL: <i>That's why Oh Jiyoung
said that to me then.</i>

97
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:24,719
(sighs)

98
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:29,142
Then you should've just said so.

99
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:32,177
Why didn't you tell me
and cause me to misunderstand?

100
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:36,692
I was going to tell you,
but you wouldn't hear me out.

101
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:41,899
I can't believe Jiyoung kissed you
just to find that out.

102
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,573
Was it...

103
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,240
true?

104
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:53,294
You said you were swayed
by Director Lee earlier.

105
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,577
Is that true?

106
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,543
Well...

107
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,509
it's not that I was swaying.
I just missed my timing to respond to him.

108
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,010
(sighs)
But seriously, what is this?

109
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,184
How come you feel better
when you're with me?

110
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,559
Why do you feel better
when you hold my hand?

111
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:16,388
Why is it that when we both kiss...

112
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,015
(gentle music)

113
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:24,027
(sighs)

114
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,887
(gentle music fades)

115
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:12,991
(Yesool screams)

116
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,075
MINHU: Hong Yesool!

117
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,037
Damn it.

118
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:21,671
(light music)

119
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:38,729
Please look for a black NFC vehicle.
It's a rental from JJ.

120
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:41,191
The suspect covered up the license plate,

121
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,269
so it's likely that he turned off
the vehicle black box too.

122
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,316
But you never know. Please check and see

123
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,190
if there remains any recordings.

124
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:51,567
Gosh, the Privacy Act
is difficult to get around...

125
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,486
Besides, you're not even the victim.

126
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:55,874
I think this case is related
to case number 2022-000832,

127
00:08:55,952 --> 00:09:00,582
that the Seoul Jungdaemun Police Station
is investigating.

128
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,205
Please check and get back to me.

129
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,252
Sure.

130
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:07,257
(sighs, mutters)

131
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:08,970
(phone beeps)

132
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:12,297
Mr. Cha.

133
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,219
You really do seem better.

134
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,940
Does it make sense
that you recovered overnight?

135
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,477
You're not messing with me,
are you, Mr. Cha?

136
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,863
MINHU: I'm fine.

137
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:28,276
Are you all right? You seemed to be having
a nightmare early this morning.

138
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,739
Oh, really?

139
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,451
I had no idea.

140
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,108
That keeps happening lately.

141
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,068
Including what happened last night,

142
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,655
has anything strange
happened to you lately?

143
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,543
Like someone following you
around or something?

144
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,955
Yes, there is.

145
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,210
Really? Who is it? How tall is he?
What does he look like?

146
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,128
You, Mr. Cha.

147
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:49,958
What?

148
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:53,297
You keep following me around
like you did last night.

149
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,434
You keep following me.

150
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:59,223
(playful music)

151
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,307
I'm sorry about...

152
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,142
yesterday.

153
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,266
Saying let's break up...

154
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,440
and not picking up your calls.

155
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,225
It's okay if we argue.

156
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,194
Just don't say we're breaking up.

157
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,487
Also, don't dodge my calls like that.

158
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:16,743
But...

159
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,451
I didn't like...

160
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,460
that you kissed Ms. Oh last night.

161
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,626
I could say the same thing.

162
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,418
I don't like how you
and Director Lee Pilyo

163
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:29,131
keep getting involved over everything.

164
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:34,877
Should we make up?

165
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,260
(soft music)

166
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:41,426
Don't ever say you want to break up.

167
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:42,765
I'll really get mad.

168
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:46,442
Well, you usually get angry easily anyway.

169
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,520
Come on.

170
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:50,185
-You really want to see me get angry?
-No.

171
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,898
(both chuckle softly)

172
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,947
My goodness.

173
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,867
(quirky music)

174
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,827
No one's here, right?

175
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,038
So what if there is?

176
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,377
YESOOL: Are you crazy?

177
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:17,092
(quirky music)

178
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:21,347
(gasps)

179
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,483
(light music)

180
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:30,560
(gasps)

181
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,488
PILYO: We're here to go over
everything for our shoot today.

182
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:41,583
I didn't know you'd be here too, Ms. Oh.

183
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:45,958
Mr. Cha, I'm sorry,
but could I join you guys later?

184
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:49,828
Since I bumped into Ms. Oh,
I can explain why scene 2B was omitted.

185
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,287
Yes, please come this way...

186
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,997
We have a lot to shoot today,
so I have to explain...

187
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,591
-(grunts)
-YESOOL: Gosh! Seriously!

188
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,184
What are we going to do now?

189
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,389
What do you mean? Is there a problem?

190
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,853
Do I know you?

191
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,010
What happened to the guy

192
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,518
who wanted to keep his personal life
separate from his work?

193
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:06,769
What's the problem?

194
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,941
Those two already know we're dating,
and they're outsiders.

195
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,270
Besides, we're not on the clock right now.
What's the issue here?

196
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,275
I mean...
(sighs)

197
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,278
Whatever. I'm leaving.

198
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:23,576
-(Jiyoung sobbing)
-(somber music)

199
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:26,945
(sighs deeply)

200
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,368
I think you'll make it to Cannes.

201
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,746
Who said Oh Jiyoung couldn't act?

202
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,416
Who said you're a terrible actor?

203
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,884
You'll do a great job
with your crying scenes today.

204
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,585
(sobbing)

205
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,601
Please don't cry.
Your eyes will get puffy.

206
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,928
We're almost ready to shoot.

207
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:49,813
Director Lee, your ex is with another man.

208
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,896
Doesn't it bother you?

209
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:56,821
They were together
because of the meeting this morning.

210
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,321
And I was on my way there.

211
00:12:58,694 --> 00:12:59,994
Don't make me laugh.

212
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:01,698
A meeting?

213
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:06,036
You had only two sandwiches and drinks.

214
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:17,206
But didn't Minhu
look perfectly fine back there?

215
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,046
Didn't he look cool?

216
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,221
Excuse me?

217
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,879
He looked healthy, too.

218
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,468
So it's true.

219
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,178
It must be true.

220
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,773
Oh, no...
(sobbing)

221
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:36,522
Gosh, stop crying.
Your makeup won't go on well.

222
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:40,574
I have to get ready for the shoot.
Be sure to come out on time, okay?

223
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,700
And make sure to eat that, too.

224
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:44,447
Please.

225
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:45,832
(sobbing)

226
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:46,988
Please.

227
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,077
(wailing)

228
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:53,329
(sighs deeply)

229
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,249
(sobbing in distance)

230
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,131
She's driving me crazy.

231
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,173
Let's do a bit more.

232
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,966
-Mr. Cha, put it in the right place.
-Could you look at the placement?

233
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,893
(light music)

234
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,064
(gasps)

235
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,138
(exhales deeply)

236
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,568
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: How's the sound?

237
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:26,365
Director.

238
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:30,537
We have some background noises
like waves since we're outdoors.

239
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:33,209
We'll edit it out later.
We'll take that into account.

240
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,500
EOMJI: <i>What a spectacular lovers' quarrel.</i>

241
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,751
Fighting into the night
and sleeping in your boyfriend's room.

242
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,297
Coming back to the room this morning.

243
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:43,132
It's not like that.

244
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,545
You always say that.

245
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,299
Mr. Cha texted me,
saying you're sleeping in his room.

246
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,046
EOMJI: <i>And you say not to worry?</i>

247
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,348
Be quiet.

248
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:54,981
Look, you're being shy. You're being shy.
You're really being shy about it.

249
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,728
(light music)

250
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:06,155
Director Lee, how much longer
do we have to wait for Ms. Oh?

251
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,028
If she takes any longer...

252
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,289
We'll have to get
other actors' scenes first.

253
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,288
-Give me the storyboard.
-Okay.

254
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,331
(sighs)

255
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,750
(car approaching)

256
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:29,851
MANAGER : Hello.

257
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,470
Hello.

258
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,938
(soft music)

259
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,479
-EOMJI: Hi, Ms. Oh.
-HAIRSTYLIST: Hello.

260
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:44,283
-MANAGER: Hi there.
-STYLIST: Hello.

261
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,530
Over here.

262
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,861
Get a nice close-up shot of me

263
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,780
at this angle.

264
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,775
My left side is especially prettier.

265
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:52,987
(chuckles)

266
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,077
Thanks for the sandwich.

267
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,751
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: Let's get ready.

268
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,507
Let's get ready, everyone!

269
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,470
Ms. Oh, you'll see it on the schedule.

270
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:17,234
We're going to shoot
all the way to scene 13 in the AM.

271
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:21,855
Were you with Minhu all through the night?

272
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:26,147
He told you everything, didn't he?

273
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:30,162
And now he's feeling fine
because of you, right?

274
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,278
Yes.

275
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:36,333
It's hard to believe,
but apparently, it's true.

276
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,044
(sighs)

277
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:39,922
Gosh, you two.

278
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,331
What's with you guys?

279
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,337
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:
All right, please standby.

280
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,132
We'll get the cameras rolling soon.

281
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,431
(bright music)

282
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,703
(in English)
Cut! Cut!

283
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,448
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: Cut!

284
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,121
They're way out of the frame.

285
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,079
Why didn't you mark the direction
for the actors here?

286
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,450
My apologies.

287
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,909
Mark it up here.

288
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,207
PILYO (in English): Ready.

289
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,420
-ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: Ready!
-PILYO: Action.

290
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:30,045
Cut, let's do it again.

291
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,842
We're going again!

292
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,925
Let's do it more dynamically.

293
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:39,725
(finger snapping)

294
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,062
(finger snapping echoing)

295
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:58,044
(foreboding music)

296
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:20,098
Okay. Let's set up for the next scene.

297
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,772
Okay. Let's set up
for the next scene, everyone!

298
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:25,191
Let's take five and start setting up!

299
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,110
Yes, sir!

300
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,898
PILYO: You got all the inserts
for the car interior, right?

301
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,897
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:
Let's set up for the next scene!

302
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:31,033
Yesool.

303
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:36,659
Did anything happen
after you went back to your room?

304
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,242
No, why?

305
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:44,116
Nothing. After the shoot,
let's go and ship everything together.

306
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,326
Be sure to pick up my calls.

307
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,086
(mellow music)

308
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:56,552
(sighs deeply)

309
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,555
(in English)
Ready. Action.

310
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,477
(all grunt)

311
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,485
-STYLIST: Jiyoung!
-HAIRSTYLIST: What happened?

312
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:14,489
My goodness.

313
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,610
-Jiyoung!
-Are you okay?

314
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:17,987
-Jiyoung!
-Let me see.

315
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,622
-HAIRSTYLIST: Are you okay?
-EOMJI: Are you all right?

316
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,200
(indistinct chatter)

317
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:22,995
-MANAGER: Does it hurt there?
-HAIRSTYLIST: My goodness.

318
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,082
It's swollen.

319
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,294
MANAGER: Get a first-aid kit.

320
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,043
What do we do?

321
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,706
I'll spray it. It'll be cold.

322
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,750
JIYOUNG: Hey, not too much.

323
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,633
What do we do about the shoot?

324
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:38,296
Hey, that's not the problem. She's hurt!

325
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,603
Are you okay, Jiyoung?

326
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,099
MANAGER: I think we need to spray it
down here, too.

327
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,428
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:
The previous take isn't too bad.

328
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,186
What should we do, Director Lee?

329
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,022
Everything else is fine,

330
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:50,693
but we need a couple more
of the knee shots.

331
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:55,112
I don't think that's going to happen.
Ms. Oh can't even walk right now.

332
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,494
I think we should change the storyboard,
so we only film her upper body.

333
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:04,790
Then what if we
use someone else for the knee shots?

334
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,076
Director Lee...

335
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:12,253
while I was in college,
I've worked as a body double part-time.

336
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:16,718
I also look pretty good from the back.

337
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,218
I'm sorry.
There's a difference in length a bit...

338
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,681
-What length...
-The length of your hair. Your hair.

339
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,312
Right, the hair.

340
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,308
-Here's the dress.
-Okay.

341
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:26,929
(sighs deeply)

342
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,017
My goodness.

343
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,105
Oh.

344
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,441
Director Lee.

345
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:38,897
PILYO (in English): Ready.

346
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:39,987
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: Ready!

347
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,242
PILYO: Action.

348
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:44,123
(cheerful music)

349
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:31,292
Okay, let's get a shot from another angle.

350
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,133
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:
We're doing another angle!

351
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,337
PILYO (in English): Cut.

352
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:44,297
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: It's a cut!

353
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,546
PILYO: Let's do it again.

354
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,427
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: We're doing it again!

355
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,925
(waves crashing)

356
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:55,307
We had a bit of a delay,
but I think the flights for the staff

357
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:59,107
and the boat for the vehicle
and the equipment

358
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:00,902
will go as planned without any changes.

359
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,776
How much longer
are you going to keep that on?

360
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:08,947
Well, it's not like I want to keep it on.

361
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,326
They said we might need
to shoot some additional shots.

362
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,458
Change out of it
as soon as you're done standing by.

363
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:15,501
Pardon?

364
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,094
Everyone's staring at you
because you're too gorgeous!

365
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,965
(ominous music)

366
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,721
What's gotten into him now?

367
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:36,768
PILYO: Follow them with the camera,
then when we pan out, the father...

368
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:37,935
Wait. Let's take a three-minute
break and resume.

369
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,323
-Sorry?
-Please put away the equipment

370
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:40,529
for a bit, too.

371
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,359
And move the barricade as well.

372
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,204
All of a sudden? It's the last scene.

373
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,319
Uh...

374
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,744
I think we'll have an emergency situation.

375
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:49,615
What are you talking about?

376
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:51,577
I need to fix my makeup.

377
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,539
I'll be back.

378
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:55,174
HAIRSTYLIST: Hold onto me, Jiyoung.

379
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:57,378
-Excuse me, please let us pass.
-Passing through.

380
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:58,669
-Please go inside.
-Oh, okay.

381
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,085
Everything's set up...

382
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:03,674
Let's take a break.

383
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:05,428
What the heck?

384
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,089
Wait. Wait a second.

385
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:09,184
Jeez.

386
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,931
(siren blaring in distance)

387
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,020
What, what is this?

388
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:17,685
(suspicious music)

389
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,784
(siren blaring continues)

390
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,912
(whooshing)

391
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:44,671
How did you know about that?

392
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,429
Did you hear that?

393
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,929
Uh, well...
(chuckles awkwardly)

394
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,060
Is Mr. Cha bionic or something?

395
00:23:57,644 --> 00:24:00,734
How did he hear something we'd hear
after three minutes?

396
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:03,074
I just checked the mic,
and that didn't even catch it.

397
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,400
-I know!
-Those mics catch a fruit fly buzzing.

398
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:06,525
(Sanggoo laughs)

399
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,071
We're not even shocked anymore.
It's not the first time.

400
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,406
This is how good we are. Right, sir?

401
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:12,621
Gosh.

402
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:16,462
(gasps)
What if he's listening to us right now?

403
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,918
Jeez, what are you saying?

404
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,125
(quirky music)

405
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,880
We'll get ready for the last scene. Yes.

406
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,303
-Here.
-(applause)

407
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:27,881
Let's start shooting.

408
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,925
Jiyoung, it's the last scene.

409
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,305
We're doing the last one.

410
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:37,431
Okay.

411
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,520
Let's go.

412
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:42,023
(light music)

413
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,528
Congratulations.

414
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:03,958
(in English)
Cut. Okay!

415
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,504
Good job, everyone.

416
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:06,877
Good job, everyone!

417
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:08,223
Thank you!

418
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:09,258
Thank you!

419
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,551
Thank you.

420
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,052
Thank you.

421
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:14,256
Shoes, shoes.

422
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:16,224
HAIRSTYLIST: It hurts, huh?

423
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:18,016
MANAGER: Your left foot first, slowly.

424
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:19,139
HAIRSTYLIST: It hurts, huh?

425
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:20,436
-MINHEE: Thank you.
-SANGGOO: Good work.

426
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,478
(waves crashing in distance)

427
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:32,816
Great work.

428
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:35,702
Thank you, Director Lee.

429
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,794
You looked so beautiful today.

430
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,079
I can't believe I left the ring
back in my room.

431
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,294
It would have been perfect
with that dress.

432
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:45,254
Stop rambling. So you wanted to say?

433
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:48,093
This morning...

434
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:55,052
I was totally craving
some seafood noodles this morning.

435
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:57,216
You know the place we went to
whenever we came to Jeju?

436
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:59,715
The owners loved us. Remember?

437
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,098
-Do you want to go there later...
-It's not there anymore.

438
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:04,515
The owner lady went to Seoul
and opened up another noodle house.

439
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:06,064
When was the last time you were there?

440
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:07,613
(chuckles awkwardly)

441
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,281
Then do you want to go
to that place in Hamduk...

442
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,899
That cafe became an auto repair shop
a long time ago.

443
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:14,952
Sorry. I can't meet with you today.

444
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:18,155
I have to return the car,
and I have plans afterward.

445
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,243
And...

446
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,664
I have to look into something as well.

447
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:24,618
See you in Seoul.

448
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,793
Okay, then.

449
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,419
(dramatic music)

450
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:37,385
ROMA: Are Mr. Cha and Ms. Hong
going back on a night flight?

451
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,470
SANGKOO: They stayed behind
to return the vehicle.

452
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:42,056
Mopix is really sensitive about that.

453
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:44,812
Those two are dating, aren't they?

454
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:47,154
That's why they stayed behind.

455
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:49,566
Are you crazy?

456
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:51,533
That jerk, Cha? Yesool?

457
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:55,355
She's a workaholic! What dating?

458
00:26:55,822 --> 00:27:00,292
I saw Ms. Hong and Mr. Cha together
while I took a walk early this morning.

459
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:04,962
And at the shoot earlier,
they had a special look in their eyes.

460
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:06,707
(sighs deeply)

461
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,091
Ms. Hong really has everything,
doesn't she?

462
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:13,723
SANGKOO: Wait a second.

463
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:17,474
Now that I look around,
Director Lee Pilyo's not here, either.

464
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,175
He said he's stopping by somewhere...

465
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:24,725
Let's go. Whatever. My gosh.

466
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,733
ONE-WAY

467
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:31,112
(dramatic music)

468
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,361
(sighs)

469
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:34,612
Everything's changed here.

470
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:36,608
When did that place
become a sashimi restaurant?

471
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:37,946
(scoffs)

472
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,205
(airplane engine rumbles)

473
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,843
(somber music)

474
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,924
MINHU: The covers are slightly loose,
so there's a possibility

475
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,087
of the car being exposed.

476
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:59,925
Please pay special attention to it.
Please maintain tight security.

477
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,101
-MAN: Yes, sir.
-When will it arrive?

478
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,970
MAN: If the waves are not too turbulent...

479
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,271
(snaps)

480
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:10,729
(light music)

481
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:13,071
(tires screech)

482
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:14,149
(gasps)

483
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:17,363
(Yesool screams)

484
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:18,445
MINHU: Hong Yesool!

485
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,283
Damn it.

486
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:24,952
Yesool, are you okay?

487
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:28,003
YESOOL: Mr. Cha.

488
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,575
What? What are you...

489
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,667
Hush, it's Ms. Jo.

490
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:33,802
(Sunhee sighs deeply)

491
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:37,168
Planning Team 1 upsets me so much.

492
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:41,763
You didn't pick up your phone.
What are you doing here by yourself?

493
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,965
(light music)

494
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:56,605
All right.

495
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:03,992
Please take care. Thank you.

496
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,325
MAN: Yes, sir.

497
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:17,213
YESOOL: <i>I'm leaving first.</i>

498
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,561
DOMESTIC DEPARTURES

499
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:29,139
(indistinct announcement)

500
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:35,193
(light music)

501
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,093
(Minhu sighs)

502
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:03,508
You knew exactly where to find me.

503
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,010
I didn't even tell you where.

504
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:13,734
This is the opposite direction
from our gate.

505
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:19,977
This has happened so many times.
How am I supposed to understand this?

506
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:24,284
Excellent instincts? Great eyesight?

507
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,569
A good sense of direction?

508
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,240
Or...

509
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:33,044
you're hiding something from me.

510
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:41,050
You believed me when I told you that
I can see the future.

511
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,130
I'll believe you, too.

512
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:46,014
So tell me everything.

513
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,017
So you're saying...

514
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:55,347
you're usually hyper-sensitive?

515
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:58,686
So when you kiss,
your senses go into overdrive

516
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:02,243
and causes you so much pain
that it makes you collapse?

517
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,323
I know it's hard to believe.

518
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,405
(indistinct announcement)

519
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:09,701
(sighs)

520
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:13,036
I believe you.

521
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:16,122
Now I can believe everything...

522
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,173
that's happened so far.

523
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,633
You heard my conversation
with Director Lee last night, too, right?

524
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:28,336
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

525
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,807
But I could just hear it from my room.

526
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:33,349
So why didn't you say anything, then?

527
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,943
You had many opportunities to do so.

528
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:39,309
When I told you my secret
and even last night...

529
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:43,066
I'm sure you wouldn't like it if you knew.

530
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:48,568
Someone I like would feel uncomfortable
around me and will try to avoid me.

531
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:54,752
I know how you feel.

532
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:57,919
Is that why I was drawn to you?

533
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,079
Because we're both weirdos.

534
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,247
(soft chuckle)

535
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:02,127
I know, right?

536
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:07,433
So, how much can you hear?

537
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:12,675
Well, when you asked me out,

538
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:15,353
you said you didn't know
exactly how you felt.

539
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,230
But I heard it.

540
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,650
The sound of your heart
beating faster for me.

541
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:23,072
I don't know. It's just that...

542
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:26,279
-(heartbeats rapidly)
-...you're always on my mind,

543
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:29,203
and I want to confirm my feelings as well.

544
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,070
(heartbeats rapidly)

545
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:35,445
You could hear that?

546
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:42,844
That's not fair to me.

547
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:44,709
You caught me.

548
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,304
But you get to see
the future that I can't see.

549
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,299
You're not hiding anything else
from me, are you?

550
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,348
No more surprises, right?

551
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,847
Let's go. It's almost time
for us to board.

552
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,784
ANNOUNCER: <i>To all passengers,</i>

553
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:07,938
<i>if you are on flight 713</i>

554
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:13,237
<i>and have completed
your boarding procedures,</i>

555
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:16,454
<i>please head to the departure waiting room</i>

556
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:19,366
<i>to go through the departure procedures.</i>

557
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,215
(sighs)

558
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,547
She's here again.

559
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:37,597
Oh Jiyoung.

560
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:43,097
She doesn't even have
to make an appointment. She goes right in.

561
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:46,984
Hey, it's because they know each other.

562
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:50,698
Are those two dating?

563
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:52,528
No, no, no.

564
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:57,083
Ms. Oh Jiyoung's not exactly
on Dr. Oh's level.

565
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,330
True. They're on a different level.

566
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:01,867
Hey, can't you hear someone crying?

567
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,416
(Jiyoung sobbing)

568
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:10,171
Hey, stop crying.
You should have been more careful.

569
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:11,966
Do you want to get an x-ray?

570
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,090
No.

571
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,426
Do you want to see
an orthopedic surgeon, then?

572
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:17,312
SEUNGTAEK: Okay.

573
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:20,221
(sighs deeply)

574
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:27,860
Hey, so he's not in pain
if he's with Ms. Hong?

575
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,864
That's so...

576
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,027
And?

577
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,413
So you kissed him
to find out if it's true?

578
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:44,116
Whoa, crazy Oh Jiyoung. In my opinion,
you're nuts. Crazy, Oh Jiyoung.

579
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,577
That's right!

580
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:47,712
I'm a crazy bitch.

581
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:51,634
But I had to see it with my own eyes

582
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:54,804
to believe it, okay?

583
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,894
(sobbing)

584
00:34:56,969 --> 00:35:00,849
Hey, Oh Jiyoung, stop crying.
My head hurts, and it's killing me.

585
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:02,524
Hey!

586
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:05,442
That asshole's not the only man
in the world!

587
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,610
Jeez, you've got to give it a rest.
Seriously.

588
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:10,818
There's only one Cha Minhu.

589
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:16,736
Minhu is the only one who has been
by my side since my childhood.

590
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,743
After my mom died when I was little,

591
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:23,955
he was like my mom, and my older brother.

592
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:27,334
He just has to become my husband now!

593
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:30,633
What the heck is this?

594
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:35,262
My plan is ruined.
(sobbing)

595
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:41,682
So why did you come up with
such an unrealistic plan to begin with?

596
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:43,523
Shit.

597
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,601
All right. Sorry.

598
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:47,686
Okay.

599
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,770
(somber music)

600
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,939
I'll go ahead and pack.

601
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,658
I'm off to enjoy my first break in a week.

602
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:01,365
Aren't you going? Let's go.

603
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,826
Then we'll go too...

604
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:10,711
I can't even get between them now.

605
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:13,297
There's nothing I can do.

606
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:15,506
It's driving me crazy.

607
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,934
What the heck does that mean now?

608
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:23,183
He's not in pain when he's with her.

609
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:25,982
So what can I do?

610
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:28,771
I hate to see him in pain

611
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,773
even more than if I were to be in pain.

612
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:35,937
I don't know. This is tough for me too.

613
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,817
This is tough. It's so tough.
I'm dying here. Oh Jiyoung.

614
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:41,238
What is love?

615
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,494
What's love, huh? What is it?

616
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,906
I want to cry too. I really want to cry...

617
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:49,666
I'm going crazy. I feel like crying too.

618
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,879
(somber music)

619
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:56,131
You know, you're not
looking too good yourself.

620
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:58,421
What's wrong?

621
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:03,973
-Seungtaek.
-Yes.

622
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:10,351
(quirky music)

623
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:16,361
Do you want to go eat pasta?

624
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:18,442
-SEUNGTAEK: Well...
-JIYOUNG: I'll feed you.

625
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:21,107
You're always dropping your food
like a baby.

626
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:27,405
Seungtaek. She's looking at you...

627
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:30,408
-like you're just a piece of stick.
-What?

628
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:34,844
-She has zero interest in you.
-Really?

629
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,170
Just give up.

630
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:39,343
(exhales deeply)

631
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,840
(grunts)

632
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:44,801
SEUNGTAEK: Stop it!

633
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:06,529
Make sure to lock your door,
and call me if anything happens.

634
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,623
They caught the burglar,
so don't worry too much.

635
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,578
Make sure to pick up my calls.

636
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:13,828
-Okay.
-Go in.

637
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,076
Bye.

638
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:22,882
(lock rattles)

639
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:28,427
Did you check the footsteps,
stride and shoe size

640
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:30,104
left on the road and the window?

641
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:31,142
(sighs)

642
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:34,845
Look, he confessed.

643
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:39,731
Can you check if he got on a plane
or drove anywhere yesterday and today?

644
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:42,782
I interrogated him yesterday and today.

645
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:44,662
How on earth could he have
gotten on a plane?

646
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:47,909
Besides, he doesn't have his license.
He got caught drunk driving.

647
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,656
All right.

648
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:53,714
Please contact me if anything new happens.

649
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,538
You know, you told me last time

650
00:38:56,625 --> 00:39:00,755
not to contact the victim
and call you directly.

651
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:02,755
Is there a reason for that?

652
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:06,341
Can I also check
the other suspects' records?

653
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:07,597
Check...

654
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,559
Just come over here. You should just...

655
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:10,968
-Just sit here, and...
-No.

656
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,267
Okay, then.

657
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:16,019
(quirky music)

658
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:19,733
I came home in a week. What's going on?

659
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:23,896
It hasn't even been an hour
since I came from the airport.

660
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:27,317
How am I supposed to choose?

661
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:29,986
I want to take all of my babies.

662
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:39,998
This one.

663
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:41,671
Yesool.

664
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:44,134
Do you remember this? You drew this.

665
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,085
I did?

666
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:46,434
You don't remember?

667
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:51,012
I think I have some pictures
from back then.

668
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:55,482
I wanted you
to become an artist back then.

669
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:58,149
I never thought you'd be making
commercials like your father.

670
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:01,516
Should I hang up one of your pieces
at my exhibition?

671
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:02,857
My goodness.

672
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:04,991
Let's see.

673
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,989
You weren't kidding about this drawing.

674
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,791
Dad took this picture for me, right?

675
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,325
But then, this hand...

676
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:24,459
Wait.

677
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,759
All of Dad's pictures are gone.

678
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:31,047
That picture from the frame was gone too.

679
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:32,427
(gasps)

680
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:35,023
Could it be that burglar
who broke into our house last time?

681
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,059
A burglar?

682
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,231
What are you talking about?

683
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:40,727
Oh, I mean...

684
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,273
Well...

685
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,976
(suspenseful music)

686
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:55,083
Auntie, the drinks are all set up.

687
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,661
You guys can start. I'll be right there.

688
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,078
Why?

689
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,708
Is it because of the photo album?

690
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:06,882
They caught the burglar,
so don't you worry. Okay?

691
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:10,126
But that burglar is so weird. Right?

692
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:12,554
Why would he take someone else's pictures?

693
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,676
Is he some kind of a pervert?

694
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:16,854
Anyway, come on, Auntie.

695
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:21,272
(door closes)

696
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:24,186
(dramatic music)

697
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:31,029
-YESOOL: Cheers!
-HOWOO: Cheers!

698
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:34,658
(gulping)

699
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:40,458
This used to be an everyday thing.

700
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:42,419
How precious is this? Don't you think?

701
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:44,168
Yes.

702
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:48,300
I'm not up to date with things
since I've been at the hospital lately.

703
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:51,300
So are you all lovey-dovey with Cha Minhu?

704
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:52,433
Hey.

705
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,300
You said you're not going to date anyone.

706
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:57,056
Yet one-night stand with Dr. Seungtaek?

707
00:41:57,139 --> 00:42:00,229
It wasn't just one night.
We slept together for one straight week.

708
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,229
What?

709
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,100
Forget it. That's not helping
my case at all.

710
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,807
Tell me about you.

711
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,069
(Yesool sighs deeply)

712
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:07,108
I just...

713
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:11,862
wanted to know why I told him
about my secret.

714
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,986
It turns out there was a reason for it.

715
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:17,544
I don't know if it's right
to get involved with him

716
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:19,118
just because of that future I saw.

717
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:20,833
What are you talking about?

718
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:22,083
It's just that...

719
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,580
we're both kind of weird.

720
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,587
So it's so weird that...

721
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,461
you like him that much, huh?

722
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:31,505
How about Pilyo?

723
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:34,010
I saw the video,
and he knows all about your secret.

724
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:35,585
Did you talk to him about that?

725
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:37,888
When I was dating Pilyo,

726
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,642
I never told him about
what was going on with me.

727
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:43,389
It felt like he'd leave me
if I told him about myself.

728
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:46,517
He'd be scared of me and avoid me.

729
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:51,026
I tortured myself, thinking that
we'd end up breaking up like that.

730
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:53,612
But I guess Mr. Cha felt like that too.

731
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:55,413
Just like me.

732
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:56,569
(Yesool sighs)

733
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:57,867
YESOOL: I don't know.

734
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:58,870
Let's just drink.

735
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:00,156
Gosh.

736
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:03,372
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

737
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:09,125
YESOOL: But why isn't Mom coming?

738
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,380
NEMO THE BLOOD MOON MURDER

739
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:17,091
THE BLOOD MOON MURDER
A BLOOD MOON PHENOMENON

740
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:23,015
THE SUSPECT OF THE BLOOD MOON
MURDER FOUND DEAD AFTER SIX MONTHS

741
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:25,805
THE POLICE HAVE CONDUCTED
AN INQUIRY INVESTIGATION

742
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:27,654
AND PRESUME THAT MR. KIM ATTEMPTED SUICIDE

743
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,900
(suspenseful music)

744
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:45,748
(lock rattles)

745
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:53,382
What brings you here so early...

746
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:57,715
Get in.

747
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:01,681
What's the occasion? Out of the blue?

748
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:04,224
Does it have to be a special occasion
for me to drive my girlfriend to work?

749
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:07,519
Get in if you don't want to be late.

750
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:10,943
Okay.

751
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,861
(gentle music)

752
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,760
Over there.
Can you drop me off over there?

753
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:50,479
I mean, it's not like our agency
forbids employees from dating in-house.

754
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:52,402
What's all the fuss about?
I said I don't care.

755
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:54,151
I care.

756
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:56,243
After all that uproar
with Director Lee Pilyo,

757
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,574
what if there's a rumor about you and me?

758
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:01,414
It won't be a rumor. It's true.
I am your boyfriend.

759
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:05,447
I mean, people are already saying that
I got to where I am with your backing.

760
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:08,326
I don't want people gossiping about me.

761
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:10,958
(gasps)

762
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:13,291
(quirky music)

763
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:14,797
Jeez.

764
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:20,047
(whooshing)

765
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,232
They didn't see me, right?

766
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:38,070
How could you miss them
when you have such sharp senses?

767
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:40,362
What? Should I have told you
to hide, then?

768
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:42,696
Do you want to hide the fact
that we're dating that badly?

769
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:45,413
Well, right now, it's...

770
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:50,082
Anyway, don't make it obvious
that we're dating when we're at work.

771
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:52,794
Act like your usual self.
Just be totally rude.

772
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:55,085
Act like a psychopath,
just like now. Okay?

773
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:56,996
Don't you make it obvious!

774
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:01,432
PLANS FOR IMPLEMENTING SCHEDULES

775
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:04,888
You must've planted
a lot of trees on Arbor Day.

776
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:10,024
Just how many trees were
cut down to produce this garbage?

777
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:16,355
How many pages is this?
What a waste of paper.

778
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,690
(yells)

779
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:23,953
Ms. Hong.

780
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,491
Is your vision okay these days?

781
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:26,624
Excuse me?

782
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,290
Is this the post-production budget sheet?

783
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:30,328
I think you put an extra zero in here.

784
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:33,424
Get your head back in the game.
Take the extra zero out and bring it back.

785
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:35,459
I almost said to take out two zeroes.

786
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:41,835
All right, understood.

787
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:43,804
(paper rustles)

788
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:45,264
Undecided on the follow-up process.

789
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:48,098
Undecided on sharing the rough cut.

790
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,220
Undecided, undecided, undecided.

791
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:55,774
Should we say our paydays
are undecided too?

792
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:58,688
I guess I've been smiling
too much lately, huh?

793
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:04,568
Let's all work late tonight. Dismissed.

794
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:12,332
SANGGOO:
He seems a little scary, but not really.

795
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:14,962
What's with him? What's gotten into him?

796
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:29,598
Stop web surfing and turn that off.

797
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,644
And do something about
clicking your mouse so regularly

798
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:33,854
while playing the card game.

799
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:38,767
Stop messaging each other
and let's work, okay?

800
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:42,820
Why don't we resolve
the follow-up process first?

801
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:44,111
-Okay.
-Okay.

802
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:47,951
So what are you trying to play at today?
You two are at it...

803
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:49,281
Don't say anything.

804
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:50,913
Just text me.

805
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:52,123
(grunts)

806
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:53,372
You poked my nose.

807
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:03,383
HOWOO: <i>Pilyo did another interview.</i>

808
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:05,669
<i>I think it's about you again.</i>

809
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:09,085
<i>He's really in love.</i>

810
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,760
<i>I feel so bad for him,
going on like that by himself.</i>

811
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,680
<i>Meet with him and talk it out, Yesool.</i>

812
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:24,276
<i>If the woman had told him
everything she had been hiding,</i>

813
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:26,779
<i>do you think the movie
would've had a happy ending?</i>

814
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:30,662
<i>I think the movie
had a happy ending, actually.</i>

815
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:34,084
<i>And I think the woman is in the process
of going after her happiness.</i>

816
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:36,041
<i>Do you mean that...</i>

817
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:38,365
<i>the man and the woman
reunite after the ending?</i>

818
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:41,133
PILYO: <i>I really don't know about that.</i>

819
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:43,547
<i>But one thing for sure is...</i>

820
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:47,511
<i>that the two will make
the best choice for themselves.</i>

821
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:52,430
<i>The choice that would make them happy.</i>

822
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:55,022
(light music)

823
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,195
What are you thinking so deeply about?

824
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:19,293
Aren't you going home?

825
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:20,793
Let's go.

826
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:23,632
Mr. Cha.

827
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:26,303
Let's take a walk.

828
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:29,221
Sure.

829
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:31,719
(light music)

830
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:41,601
We've been walking for an hour.

831
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:43,812
Say what you want to say.

832
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:46,571
Or should I say it first?

833
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:55,326
I have no intention
of getting dragged around...

834
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:57,543
by the future you saw and you will see.

835
00:49:57,953 --> 00:50:01,163
Even if our future is not a happy one,

836
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:04,075
I have no intention
of breaking up with you.

837
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:07,959
Why are you bringing that up
all of a sudden?

838
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:11,296
I don't know.
I just felt like I should say it

839
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:13,053
seeing how you are right now.

840
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,466
Do whatever you want in this relationship.

841
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:21,729
I'm going to do the same.

842
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:25,610
The first thing I want to do is...

843
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:29,856
dropping you off at home.

844
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:32,946
(light music)

845
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:42,036
I'm home.

846
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:44,752
SARA: Yesool, you got a package.
I put it in your room.

847
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:45,883
Okay.

848
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:05,812
HONG YESOOL

849
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:11,858
<i>HAROO</i>

850
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:13,953
(light music)

851
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:20,950
PILYO: <i>I thought it was about time
you watch it.</i>

852
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,000
<i>This is our story...</i>

853
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:25,579
<i>that I've been wanting to tell you.</i>

854
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:37,215
POST-EVENT AGREEMENT (EDITED)

855
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:42,524
The brain CT scan looks good...

856
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:46,266
and MRI and MRA scans are both fine, too.

857
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:51,936
The frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes
and both occipital lobes are fine too.

858
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:54,395
Your senses are functioning as usual.

859
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:59,155
By "usual," I mean by your standards.

860
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,450
I know, Doctor.

861
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:02,985
Looks like you're doing well.

862
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:06,537
Is it the power of being in love?
(laughs)

863
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,330
So, how did Ms. Hong react?

864
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:11,955
She wasn't shocked
when she found out about you?

865
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:15,799
I shouldn't have been so worried.
She was so understanding.

866
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:17,968
That's great.

867
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:20,973
But I'm worried, Doctor.

868
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:23,138
Now that she knows
about my heightened senses,

869
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:24,813
and the potential risks that follow,

870
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:26,521
would it be okay to tell her more?

871
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:30,651
What if I bring back bad memories for her?

872
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:35,280
Are you afraid that she'll remember
that she knew you as a child

873
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:38,110
and ultimately remember that incident?

874
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:39,570
Yes.

875
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:42,407
As you mentioned before,

876
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,950
if she chose to forget the incident
for some reason,

877
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:48,869
then maybe it's wrong
to keep revealing myself

878
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:51,077
and provoking her.

879
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:52,708
Just face it head-on.

880
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:55,053
So that you can move on to the next.

881
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:57,550
Aside from all that,

882
00:52:57,632 --> 00:53:01,552
I wish you'd become freer.

883
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:08,098

<i>Yes, I am.</i>

890
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:51,899
A handshake. Don't you know?

891
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:54,403
PILYO: Let's do a good job.

892
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:56,323
As a director and staff.

893
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:00,488
(birds chirping)

894
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:06,034
WOMAN: <i>What's special about today?</i>

895
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:08,158
MAN: <i>The day we get to kiss.</i>

896
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:11,246
(light music)

897
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:28,183
YESOOL: <i>From the moment I saw that future,</i>

898
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:31,808
<i>I've never been in control
of my relationship with Pilyo.</i>

899
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:37,689
<i>Because I was afraid of the future,</i>

900
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:39,401
<i>because I was anxious,</i>

901
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:41,738
<i>and terrified,</i>

902
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:45,486
<i>I've never been myself.</i>

903
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:49,825
<i>So I ran away.</i>

904
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:52,584
<i>I couldn't handle the future.</i>

905
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:55,076
<i>All I remember is running away...</i>

906
00:54:56,751 --> 00:55:00,051
<i>while ignoring what I had seen.</i>

907
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:03,799
<i>HAROO</i>

908
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:06,759
(light music)

909
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:28,951
Thanks for watching it to the end.

910
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:38,040
There's a question I haven't been able
to answer after we broke up.

911
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:39,625
The future I saw...

912
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:42,423
Was it bound to happen?

913
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:44,755
Or did I make it happen?

914
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:48,431
I still don't know the answer to that.

915
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:53,179
What would've happened had I confronted it

916
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:55,518
and told you everything back then?

917
00:55:56,394 --> 00:55:58,364
I was afraid of breaking up with you,

918
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,940
and that you might leave me.

919
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:04,437
So, rather than enjoying
the present moment,

920
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:06,818
I was always so anxious.

921
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,741
But even if we were
to go back to that time,

922
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:13,118
I don't think I could've told you.

923
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:15,367
I'm sorry...

924
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:18,169
for not facing the situation...

925
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:21,294
and always running away.

926
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:25,417
But I realized something
after watching this movie.

927
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:30,851
I don't want to go back to the way I was.

928
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:34,971
I'm not going to make...

929
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:37,442
the same mistake again.

930
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,730
I guess I see the future, too.

931
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:48,699
I thought you'd say something like that.

932
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:51,616
The way you look at Cha Minhu...

933
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:56,620
is the same way you used to look at me.

934
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:58,997
So, now I know.

935
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:05,263
I should be cool and say, "Fine.

936
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:07,218
I'll let you go for your happiness."

937
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:09,337
I want to say that, but...

938
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:13,354
(scoffs)
...you know me, right?

939
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:16,143
I'm not that cool.

940
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:20,023
So what if...

941
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:22,982
you see another unhappy future?

942
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:27,034
If you see a future that you can't handle,

943
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:30,323
what will you do then?

944
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:37,786
I'll still go for it.

945
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:42,205
I won't avoid the situation and run away.

946
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:45,300
I'll face it head-on.

947
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:49,633
(light music)

948
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:07,397
You sure took your time. I know
you've been back in Korea for a while.

949
00:58:07,942 --> 00:58:08,902
(soft chuckle)

950
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:12,657
Wow, nothing's changed here.

951
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:14,662
Still no customers.

952
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:17,578
How do you pay your rent?
Are you able to keep up?

953
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:21,334
Yesool is a regular here.

954
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:24,131
She has nowhere else to go
if you go out of business.

955
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:26,337
So, you can't take her away
from Cha Minhu?

956
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,090
You know about that?

957
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:30,625
(scoffs)
You know everything, don't you?

958
00:58:30,715 --> 00:58:32,465
Well, I don't think Cha Minhu is all that.

959
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:34,430
Try to win her over, okay?

960
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:36,928
I came back to do everything I can,

961
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:40,229
but I don't think there is much I can do.

962
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:43,479
You've done everything you can? Really?

963
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:46,730
Do more. All the way.

964
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:48,444
There's nothing you can't do.

965
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:52,742
But I think that will make
Yesool struggle even more, though...

966
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:55,238
and I really don't want to do that.

967
00:58:57,367 --> 00:59:00,117
Gosh, I really came back determined.

968
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:03,208
But am I too late?

969
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:05,078
It's never too late.
Life is all about the right timing.

970
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:06,456
You have to wait until the end.

971
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:08,213
While doing what you can do.

972
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:10,344
Until she knows how you feel.

973
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:13,588
Should I call up Yesool?

974
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:14,755
Where is she?

975
00:59:28,606 --> 00:59:30,816
(cell phone vibrates)

976
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:34,572
YESOOL: <i>Mr. Cha, where are you?</i>

977
00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:36,162
Is something the matter again?

978
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:38,489
Yes, something is the matter.

979
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:39,735
What's going on?

980
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:41,870
I'll tell you when I see you.

981
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:43,497
What?

982
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:45,328
Let's meet right now.

983
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:49,536
-Where are you? I'll be right over.
<i>-No.</i>

984
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:51,705
I'll go to you this time.

985
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:53,593
To your house.

986
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:54,553
What?

987
00:59:54,632 --> 00:59:55,972
Wait for me.

988
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:58,260
(upbeat music)

989
01:00:48,686 --> 01:00:49,806
What's wrong?

990
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:51,306
You know...

991
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:55,935
I don't need this contract anymore.

992
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:02,241
I cancel everything that's written here.

993
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:04,792
I want to know everything.

994
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:08,290
I'm not going to miss the moment
and tell you everything.

995
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:11,042
I'll do everything I want to do.

996
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:13,418
With you, Mr. Cha.

997
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:15,763
And regardless of the future,

998
01:01:16,255 --> 01:01:18,585
I want to sleep with you.

999
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:21,262
Even if we end up breaking up,

1000
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:23,893
I'm going to really
pursue this relationship.

1001
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:30,480
Let's be real lovers.

1002
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:33,942
Passionately.

1003
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:39,611
It's okay if you collapse.

1004
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:42,414
I'll be spending the night here.

1005
01:01:46,244 --> 01:01:48,044
(romantic music)

1006
01:02:01,509 --> 01:02:05,009
POST-EVENT AGREEMENT (EDITED)

1007
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:20,067
(romantic music continues)

1008
01:02:57,648 --> 01:02:59,648
(closing theme music)
