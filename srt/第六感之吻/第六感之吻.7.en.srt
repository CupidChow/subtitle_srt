00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:14,061
(clicks)

00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:21,438
(sighs)
YESOOL: <i>How do I face Cha Minhu?</i>

4
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,112
(light music rises)

5
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:28,105
(sighs deeply)
<i>Why am I so nervous?</i>

6
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:32,156
(light music)

7
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,300
(theme music)

00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,683
EPISODE 07

00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:45,362
(light music)

10
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,237
YESOOL: <i>Relax, Yesool.</i>

11
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:57,624
<i>Just act natural.</i>

12
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,786
BASED ON THE WEBNOVEL
KISS SIXTH SENSE BY GOT W

13
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:10,799
(exhales deeply)

14
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:12,626
Ms. Hong.

15
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,303
(sighs)

16
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,594
I came straight to work

17
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,097
after working all night
at Director Lee Pilyo's studio.

18
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:21,429
(sighs)
The video came out totally awesome,

19
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,190
but the client sent us
a shitload of things to fix this morning.

20
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:30,395
-The captions, logo, and slogan.
-(Minhee sighs)

21
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,443
They sent us really crappy feedback.

22
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,531
How do I tell the director about this?

23
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,454
(disbelieving laughter)

24
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,777
Ms. Hong, please give us some tips...

25
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,328
Oh...

26
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:44,463
(tearfully)
Ms. Hong, help us.

27
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,789
I think we'll get our ass kicked
by Mr. Cha first

28
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,125
when we tell him about it.

29
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:50,593
Is Mr. Cha in yet?

30
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,050
Yes, he's been here
since early this morning.

31
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,761
It's like he doesn't even sleep.

32
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,393
Here's your coffee.

33
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:00,559
Oh. I'm off, then.

34
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:02,558
Wait...

35
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,680
(footsteps receding)

36
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,017
Let's just drink coffee.

37
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,108
Three more espresso shots, please.

38
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,863
AUTOMATED VOICE: <i>The doors are closing.</i>

39
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:15,324
(light music)

40
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:23,873
YESOOL: <i>What? He's not there.</i>

41
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:28,365
(light music continues)

42
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,022
(gasps)
Oh, my God!

43
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:49,939
What is it, Mr. Cha?

44
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,613
I didn't see a tab
for the current expenses

45
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,320
in the excel sheet for our Mopix budget.

46
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,110
Oh, uh...
(gasps)

47
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,069
It should be in the final file.

48
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,025
I'm sorry. I'll resend it.

49
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:03,161
Did you pass on the PowerPoint form
that we're going to use for the PPM

50
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,413
and the copy that we asked
Production Team 3 to give us?

51
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,919
I gave it to Mr. Kim. Haven't you seen it?

52
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:10,876
I'll check.

53
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,416
-Oh, Hong Yesool.
-Yes?

54
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:18,835
Email me the revised proposal
you checked last time.

55
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,800
Oh, okay.

56
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,062
YESOOL: <i>What's with that guy?
Are we really dating?</i>

57
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,316
<i>Shall we start dating?</i>

58
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,065
YESOOL: As you said, Mr. Cha,

59
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:39,858
let's date.

60
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,200
Suggesting that we date...

61
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,164
Is it because of the future you saw or

62
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,542
is it because you feel differently
about me now?

63
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:49,576
(sighs lightly)

64
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:52,291
I don't know. It's just that

65
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,714
you're always on my mind,

66
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,206
and I want to confirm my feelings as well.

67
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,138
(soft music)

68
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,516
I've heard everything I wanted to hear.

69
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,312
Okay.

70
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,475
Let's date.

71
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,527
(surprised grunt)

72
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,491
Why are you so
out of it this early in the day?

73
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,276
Let's have our meeting.

74
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:25,365
Yes, ma'am.

75
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,247
(light music)

76
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,219
(sighs)

77
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,740
(light music continues)

78
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,928
-MAN: Thank you.
-I'll see you tomorrow.

79
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,141
See you tomorrow.

80
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,941
(light music)

81
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,227
Wait. We're supposed to be dating.

82
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,646
He hasn't contacted me at all.

83
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:46,776
My goodness.

84
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:55,248
YESOOL: <i>Was Mr. Cha out of the office
all day today?</i>

85
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,878
MINHEE: <i>No,
he's been in his office all day. Why?</i>

86
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:04,674
(snorts)

87
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,138
(sighs deeply)

88
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,929
YESOOL: <i>I had a question for him.</i>

89
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,102
<i>All right.</i>

90
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,641
-(inhales deeply)
-(phone buzzes)

91
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:18,225
MR. CHA MINHOO

92
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:19,856
Ha.

93
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,149
(cell phone vibrates)

94
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:24,401
Yes.

95
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,029
(soft music)

96
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,406
YESOOL: <i>Why are we at a hotel?</i>

97
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,090
(soft music continues)

98
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,102
<i>Where are we going?</i>

99
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:58,435
(music fades)

100
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,980
Did you wait for my call today?

101
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,570
(disbelieving noise)
You mean you waited for my call.

102
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,361
Are you trying to make it obvious
that this is our first date?

103
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,985
You've watched way too many dramas.
This is so cliché.

104
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,072
(laughs)

105
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:13,777
Did you sleep well last night?

106
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,695
Yeah, I slept really well.
I sleep well these days.

107
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:19,827
Now that I'm in Production Team 2,
no one pesters me.

108
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,036
I have a lot more time to sleep, too.

109
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:23,246
That's good.

110
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:27,465
YESOOL: <i>Yesool, why are you overreacting?</i>

111
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:29,182
Oh.

112
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:32,472
I wanted to talk to you anyway, Mr. Cha.

113
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,064
Go ahead.

114
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,139
Let's set some terms.

115
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:40,388
We started out in a pretty unusual way,

116
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,478
and you're also my senior at work.

117
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:45,935
So I think we need to agree on
a few things if we want to start dating.

118
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,358
(light music playing)

119
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:57,407
POST-EVENT AGREEMENT (EDITED)
CHA MINHOO

120
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,081
Impressive.

121
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,082
You prepared all this?

122
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:07,209
Well, I've learned a lot from my mentor.

123
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,007
(exhales deeply)
Hmm.

124
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:13,891
This isn't what I wanted to talk about,
but let's hear it.

125
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,314
I want to keep it a secret.

126
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:19,104
-I thought you'd say that.
-Let's abide by that article,

127
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,063
and not ask about any secrets
that we each don't want to talk about

128
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:24,273
and not interfere with each other's
private lives. Don't ask, don't meddle.

129
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,729
Unless it's a special occasion,
let's only meet on the weekends.

130
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,397
So that it won't interfere with our work.

131
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,531
Okay. But I can't see you
on the third Saturday of every month.

132
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:34,823
Why not?

133
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,868
Okay, okay. Fine.

134
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,537
Also,

135
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,326
as far as getting physical,
when it comes to kissing...

136
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,457
I also...

137
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,798
hate being snuck upon with a kiss.
Please watch for that.

138
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,586
(disbelieving grunt)
Hey, I hate it too!

139
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,176
Do you know how traumatic it is to ki...

140
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:58,853
kiss someone and see their future?

141
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:02,731
Also, why do you think that I would
sneak up on you with a kiss, huh?

142
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:03,940
Why is that?

143
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:08,226
Well, you tripped and kissed me
that one time,

144
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:12,026
and tried to kiss me when I got sick,
and asked for a kiss when you were drunk.

145
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,571
Well, those memories
are still pretty vivid for me.

146
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,655
(quirky music)

147
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:19,912
Let's just not kiss.

148
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,960
(sighs)

149
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,921
ARTICLE 3 (CONFIDENTIALITY)

150
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,051
ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS

151
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,628
This article won't work for me.

152
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:35,126
End our relationship after the realization
of the specific future?

153
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,337
Says who?

154
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,101
I'm going to sleep with you,

155
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,179
and I'm going to keep seeing you
after that.

156
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:42,644
If you want that too, of course.

157
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:45,267
Do you still want to end things
after sleeping with me?

158
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,653
(quirky music continues)

159
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:49,939
Uh...

160
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,534
I... I need to go to the bathroom.

161
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,704
(sighs)

162
00:10:58,783 --> 00:10:59,873
(exhales deeply)

163
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,870
Why do I keep letting him
lead the conversation?

164
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,951
Why is he being so straightforward?

165
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,118
Why didn't I say anything? Am I stupid?

166
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,920
My gosh. Seriously.

167
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:10,752
(sighs)

168
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,836
(instrumental music)

169
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,350
(clears throat)

170
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,271
Shall we continue our conversation, then?

171
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,361
Just do whatever you want.

172
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,864
I'll do whatever I want, too.

173
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,777
So, when do you want
to come over to my place?

174
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,066
Uh...

175
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,280
Minhu?

176
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,368
(upbeat music)

177
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:50,964
(awkward grunt)

178
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,213
We were meeting with our client,

179
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,303
but they had to go
to the bathroom for a second.

180
00:11:57,174 --> 00:12:01,264
We were discussing the details
of our contract...

181
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:05,975
But Ms. Hong, I thought
you dropped out of Mopix project.

182
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,063
-Oh, that's...
-Jiyoung.

183
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,145
We're on a date right now.

184
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,726
Could you leave us alone?

185
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,200
(quirky music)

186
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,196
(sighs)

187
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,619
(clicks)

188
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,496
Why did you tell her that?

189
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:33,995
Minhu!

190
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,592
So did you tell her your secret?

191
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:38,422
Is she dating you
after finding out all that?

192
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,547
(light music)

193
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,047
Did you tell her?

194
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,102
-We're late for our meeting, Jiyoung.
-(sighs)

195
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,222
Let's go.

196
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,692
(footsteps receding)

197
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:53,651
(sighs)

198
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,980
(engine revs)

199
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,066
I've been meaning to ask.

200
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,698
How do you know Ms. Oh?

201
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,251
And what's the secret she's talking about?

202
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,211
Do you have some secret you can't tell?

203
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,922
You said earlier that we shouldn't ask
each other about our secrets

204
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:18,383
and personal matters.
Do you want to hear it now?

205
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,930
No!

206
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:23,468
There's no need to share
all our private matters.

207
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,644
It's not like we're young 20-year-olds.

208
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:30,558
But we shouldn't create situations
that are easy to misread, don't you think?

209
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,018
She's my younger sister.

210
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,404
What?

211
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,149
Cha Minhu. Oh Jiyoung.

212
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,317
Your last names are different, though.

213
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:43,201
She's just like a younger sister
I've known since we were kids.

214
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,702
RECENTS

215
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:49,866
EDIT

216
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,922
(pensive music)

217
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,252
Huh?

218
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,959
Why does she look so familiar?

219
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,337
Aren't you going in?
Do you want to stay here a bit longer?

220
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,045
Excuse me?

221
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:09,427
They still haven't caught the burglar
who broke into your house.

222
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,680
Do you want me to stay with you tonight?

223
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,904
(stuttering)
You must be crazy.

224
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,230
My goodness.

225
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:19,404
(quirky music)

226
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:25,531
(laughs)

227
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,334
What's wrong with him?

228
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,212
Is he on something?

229
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,536
He's so different.

230
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,206
Huh?

231
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,559
WOMAN (on video): <i>Go, go.</i>

232
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,849
(Young Yesool laughs)

233
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,306
YOUNG JIYOUNG (on video): <i>It's cold.</i>

234
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,477
-(Young Jiyoung laughs)
-Huh?

235
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,397
(sighs)

236
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,992
The child actress in Dad's commercial
was Oh Jiyoung?

237
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:09,738
She's like his younger sister, huh?

238
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,412
Hmm.

239
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:15,616
Cha Minhu. I thought I knew him well,

240
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,998
but he keeps you guessing.

241
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,458
Jeez.

242
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,764
(gentle music)

243
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,592
What? You're dating?

244
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:27,755
Really?

245
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:32,218
You're really, really, really
dating Ms. Hong?

246
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:33,723
Yeah.

247
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:36,727
Oh, my God! This is big!

248
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,480
Hey, hey, since when?

249
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:41,572
No, wait, how did it happen?
No, why? Why, why, why?

250
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:45,987
Wow, Ms. Hong drank too much
Red Bomb again, huh?

251
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,240
My goodness.

252
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:50,991
(exhales deeply)
Cha Minhu, look at you. No wonder.

253
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:57,495
I was suspicious of you ever since
you kept hanging up on me.

254
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:58,621
And look what's happened.

255
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:01,587
Wow, you sly dog.
Cha Minhu, you, look at you.

256
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,549
I shouldn't have told you.

257
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:07,169
Hey, who else would you talk
to about stuff like this?

258
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:11,428
So, did you tell her?

259
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,431
Well, you know, now that you're together,

260
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,184
you should just tell her
about your condition...

261
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:16,425
I'm not going to.

262
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:17,887
What?

263
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,767
It's not like anything
will change even if I tell her.

264
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:22,273
It'll just become awkward between us.
Why should I tell her?

265
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:24,316
Well, so what?

266
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,110
You know, get through it together!
Just come clean!

267
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,364
I mean, your senses are
a bit more developed than others.

268
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:30,356
What's wrong with that?

269
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,657
So what if you collapse
when you kiss someone? Huh?

270
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:33,831
What do you mean, "so what"?

271
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,909
Are you saying that
because you really don't know?

272
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,615
I know what my girlfriend is doing
from 100m away,

273
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,080
and I know where she's been
and who she's met

274
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,167
just by her scent. And on top of all that,

275
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:47,923
I still don't know the side effects
that this could be causing inside my body,

276
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:51,637
and I don't even know how long
this condition is going to last.

277
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:55,259
And I'm supposed to ask her to understand
all that just because we're dating?

278
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,556
Well, I guess
she might worry a little bit.

279
00:16:58,642 --> 00:16:59,562
I don't like it.

280
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:04,650
I don't want Yesool to mind me like that
and be uncomfortable with me.

281
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:08,364
I'll just be careful like I've been doing.

282
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,778
So you'd better watch what you say too.

283
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,736
Why would I say anything, huh?

284
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:17,911
By the way, what's got you smoking again?

285
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,834
Wow, you're psychic. Look at you.

286
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:27,670
I took a shower and everything.
I can't believe you sniffed that out.

287
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:30,005
Why? Did something happen at the hospital?

288
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:31,552
Hey.

289
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:34,802
Oh, never mind.

290
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:38,467
You got enough to deal with.
Why would I go on and whine to you?

291
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,767
What? What is it?

292
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,521
Never mind.
I'll tell you later when I get the chance.

293
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:44,524
Hey.

294
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,685
In any case, if you're going to hide it
from Ms. Hong, fine.

295
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:50,108
Just don't put up a wall
between you and her

296
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,404
or distance yourself. Okay?

297
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,908
That really hurts the other person
when you're in a relationship.

298
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,198
(sighs)

299
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,000
Hey, hey.

300
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:02,752
Here.

301
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:03,963
Yeah.

302
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,293
(slurping)

303
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:08,497
(bottles thud)

304
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,425
(sighs)

305
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,814
I know I put that somewhere.

306
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,481
(paper rustles)

307
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:35,282
I get that you're upset about dropping out
of Mopix, but you shouldn't do this,

308
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:36,994
dispatched Ms. Hong.

309
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,163
I finished all of my morning tasks.

310
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,333
I even emailed you all the files, Ms. Jo.

311
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,294
It seems that Production Team 1
is chaotic once again.

312
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,882
Perhaps we should pray that the curse
would lift off of Mopix or something.

313
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:48,628
Why?

314
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,630
FEEDBACK >>> STORY
THE SCENE WHERE THEY'RE SAYING GOODBYE

315
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:56,053
(sighs deeply)

316
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,675
SOMETHING MORE SIMPLE AND NOTICEABLE.

317
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:00,061
I know I sent them
a revised version yesterday,

318
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,519
but look at all this again.

319
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:03,178
(awkward laughter)

320
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,937
I think they do like it a lot.

321
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:08,105
This feedback
doesn't mean they don't like it...

322
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:11,818
Did you ever think how lines
about functions and product name

323
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,940
popping up would ruin the video?

324
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:16,067
(awkward laughter)

325
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,985
Why do you think
we call the client our "deity"?

326
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:23,001
Inside my folder, you'll see
copy edits, logo edits, feedback edits.

327
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,288
Edit, edit, edit.
It's not like it's someone's name.

328
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:27,962
It never ends.
(awkward laughter)

329
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:31,211
So, Director, instead of approaching this
like a work of art...

330
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:34,625
Of course, it's a work of art.
It's going to be a part of my filmography.

331
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,467
Right.

332
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,554
There's no right answer in art.

333
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,095
There's no set equation, either.

334
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:46,476
But in advertising,
we have to come close to the right answer.

335
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:50,147
-And actually, our client has that answer.
-(sighs)

336
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:52,942
Please make the edits.

337
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,438
What if I say I can't?

338
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:02,278
I don't know what that "right answer" is,
but didn't you hire me with all that money

339
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,867
so that I could break out of that mold?

340
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:08,577
(sighs)
Let's take a break.

341
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,252
(door opens)

342
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:15,801
(door closes)

343
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,972
(quirky music)

344
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,224
MINHEE: <i>We haven't even started to film
the actual ad yet,</i>

345
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,926
<i>but I feel like I'm dying already.</i>

346
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,386
SANGGOO: <i>Director Lee
is so particular and sensitive.</i>

347
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:29,645
<i>What a mess.</i>

348
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:32,233
ROMA: <i>I guess he didn't get
to where he is for nothing.</i>

349
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,983
MINHEE: <i>They're starting round three!</i>

350
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:38,781
ROMA: <i>I can't get in touch with Oh Jiyoung
because she's ghosting us.</i>

351
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,282
<i>What do we do, Ms. Hong?</i>

352
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,572
(playful music)

353
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,375
1. TURN OFF THE LIGHTS AT YOUR DESK

354
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:56,916
(sighs)

355
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,295
I'll be right back.

356
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:07,932
PILYO: Gosh.

357
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:12,353
I came here for Hong Yesool,
but you're not around.

358
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,647
It's all about edits, edits, and edits.
I'm in edit hell.

359
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:18,605
My ego is bruised
for the first time in my life.

360
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,778
I saw the video too.

361
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,866
The video itself isn't so bad,

362
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,536
but it's not impactful for a commercial.

363
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:28,502
It's too loose.

364
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,576
It was a stretch for Oh Jiyoung
to convey the concept, too.

365
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:33,827
(sighs)
I'm about to lose it.

366
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:35,838
Get some help.

367
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:38,589
Production teams and planning teams
aren't just there for show.

368
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,546
It's different than making movies
where you do things on your own.

369
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,678
I trusted you
since we worked so well as a team.

370
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,218
You know I always listen to you only.

371
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:55,226
Did you know that Ms. Oh
did a commercial for Mopix in the past?

372
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,074
Once you watch that clip,

373
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,742
I think this could help you.

374
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,610
Take a look at it.

375
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,410
CONNECTING TIME, RACING THROUGH LIFE

376
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:09,950
See you.

377
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,829
(light music)

378
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:21,627
SAYING GOODBYE

379
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:30,772
This is
Director Hong Sungjoon's commercial.

380
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:32,854
It swept all the awards that year.

381
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,194
I know that too.

382
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,363
That's Hong Yesool.

383
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:37,516
What?

384
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:40,775
What's Ms. Hong doing in there?

385
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:44,534
Director Hong Sungjoon
is Hong Yesool's father.

386
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,912
Ooh. Awesome.

387
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,530
Fast forward to the end.

388
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:51,333
Okay.

389
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,711
Doesn't she look familiar?

390
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,790
YOUNG JIYOUNG (on video): <i>It's cold!
</i>(laughs)

391
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,495
You're right.

392
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:00,796
She does seem familiar.

393
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:03,591
Does Ms. Hong have a younger sister?

394
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:07,838
How will you ever make it
as a director without an eye for it?

395
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,385
Come on.

396
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,601
Why would you bring that up?

397
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,140
I'm working really hard on my scripts.

398
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,476
That's actress Oh Jiyoung.

399
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,860
What? Oh Jiyoung?

400
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,106
Oh.

401
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:24,649
Wow, that's amazing.

402
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:28,034
The model from 25 years ago
is all grown up now,

403
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,905
and she's the model
for the same brand again.

404
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:33,997
Well, if you connect this to the concept,

405
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,866
I think we can end up
with something great.

406
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:40,251
(light music)

407
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:52,928
DAD FILMING JIYOUNG AND MOM

408
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:59,558
THE CAR CHANGES FROM
AN OLD ONE TO THE NEW ZELUS

409
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:02,937
Well, do you think this is closer
to the right answer?

410
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:06,323
I think utilizing actress
Oh Jiyoung to the max

411
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,163
could result in a commercial
that could influence the sales.

412
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,157
It's completely different
from the requested revisions,

413
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,240
but it's not bad.

414
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:13,544
Wow, when did you have the time to...

415
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,748
Ms. Hong gave me some ideas
and helped me out a lot.

416
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,459
Her reference materials helped a lot, too.

417
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,503
Then should we prepare the PT like this?

418
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:21,754
Sure, go ahead.

419
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,705
I'll communicate
the current situation to them.

420
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:26,804
It's just that my hands are tied
in the advertising world,

421
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,132
but I actually like doing a good job.

422
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:31,717
A true professional doesn't blame
the situation or the environment.

423
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:34,763
Besides, we don't know
if this is the right answer yet.

424
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,306
Hey.
(awkward laughter)

425
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:40,402
SANGGOO: Come on, you two.
You're like little kids...

426
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,399
(Sanggoo laughs)

427
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,270
You'll send us
the edited video today, right?

428
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:47,277
Sure thing. Ms. Hong said
that she would help me all night.

429
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,360
I've got all the help I need.

430
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,239
(clears throat)

431
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:54,987
(clears throat)

432
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:58,290
DAEHAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

433
00:24:58,371 --> 00:24:59,541
WING A

434
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:00,713
-Hello.
-Hello.

435
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,220
(sighs deeply)

436
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,469
(coughs)

437
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:19,595
He has symptoms such as phlegm,
coughing, and difficulty breathing.

438
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,274
Wait.
(inhales)

439
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:24,978
I want one of the PKs to finish reporting.
Who's ranked number one?

440
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,949
Yes. Judging from the phlegm, coughs,
and difficulties in breathing,

441
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,529
it seems like the patient
is displaying symptoms of a cold

442
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:33,914
and pneumonia that developed
over several months...

443
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,160
A cold and pneumonia?

444
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:40,752
One second, sir.

445
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,626
(inhales)
The crackles are really bad.

446
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,422
In this case, what are some
other possible diagnoses?

447
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:52,376
You could suspect emphysema,
but it's only been a few months

448
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:53,887
since he developed difficulties
in breathing,

449
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,219
and the chest radiography didn't
offer any other options.

450
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:57,966
As you know, difficulties in breathing

451
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,556
develop slowly over several years
with emphysema...

452
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:00,521
Never mind.

453
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,730
Any other possibilities?

454
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:04,896
You could consider
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,

455
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,020
where the lungs harden,

456
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:08,316
but symptoms
of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis

457
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,190
such as clubbed fingers
have not been observed.

458
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,487
There were no symptoms
of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis

459
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:13,861
in the chest radiography as well.

460
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:16,407
You're quick with a diagnosis,
as I've heard.

461
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,447
Do all of you agree?

462
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:19,575
(exhales deeply)

463
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:20,791
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

464
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:24,582
What about the color
of the patient's phlegm?

465
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:25,748
Did you check?

466
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,957
-Pardon?
-The color of his phlegm.

467
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,218
(light music continues)

468
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:40,425
RECEPTION, EXAMINATION ROOM,

469
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:43,635
WAITING ROOM, HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATION
WINGS A-C, BATHROOM

470
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,018
(Seungtaek sighs)

471
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,824
If someone has IPF,
their phlegm will be whiteish.

472
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:55,494
But you excluded all other possibilities

473
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:56,782
just because there's no clubbing
of the fingers

474
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,065
and you saw the chest radiography results?

475
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,865
If you rush everything like that,
it saves you time,

476
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,292
but what about the patient?

477
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:07,375
Only 40 percent of the IPF patients
survive five years after the diagnosis!

478
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:09,915
I'm sorry, sir.

479
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:12,133
(dramatic music)

480
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:15,013
Check the chart for any suspicions
of the patient having IPF,

481
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,552
and get the patient's consent

482
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,426
to set a time
for the thoracoscopic lung biopsy.

483
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:20,392
Yes, sir.

484
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:23,389
(dramatic music continues)

485
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,324
(sighs)

486
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:35,403
(sighs deeply)

487
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:39,908
Shit, so annoying! Really.

488
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,790
Why does he keep picking on me?

489
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,038
It's not like we're elementary-aged kids.

490
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,920
He's so freaking childish.
What's with him?

491
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:51,503
(sighs)

492
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:53,916
-Right?
-(surprised grunt)

493
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:55,836
Do you know Dr. Oh?

494
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:57,052
Pardon?

495
00:27:57,717 --> 00:27:58,927
Oh, well.

496
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:02,176
Yes, I know Dr. Oh Seungtaek.

497
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,522
I just know him as a professor.

498
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:08,645
No, I mean, he's not usually like that.

499
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:11,727
Last year, the PKs called him
"the Gyeongsang-do Uncle.”

500
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,355
Because he was so nice, like an uncle.

501
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:17,403
But he's being so picky this year.

502
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:18,947
To you.

503
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,567
Especially.

504
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,452
(awkward smile)

505
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,076
What is it, huh?

506
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:29,418
It's part of my job to take care
of matters like this in the middle.

507
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,839
-Just tell me a little bit. Do tell...
-No.

508
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,668
I have nothing to do with it.

509
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:35,257
All right then.

510
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,590
Ho... Howoo?

511
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:44,932
I know there's something there...

512
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:49,099
Here are our concept and materials
for the new commercial.

513
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:52,806
It's the story of the present day

514
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,727
after Mopix's V3 commercial
from 25 years ago.

515
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:56,356
Wow.

516
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,903
This is the first commercial
I was in charge of.

517
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:02,241
I was a newbie then

518
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,701
and Director Hong Sungjoon
looked after me a lot.

519
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:08,123
This brings back old memories.

520
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,334
(laughs)

521
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,918
This was Ms. Hong's idea.
The AE who dropped out,

522
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,040
taking responsibility
for the photo leaking incident.

523
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,297
She's also Director Hong's daughter.

524
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:19,723
(sighs)

525
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,931
He would have been so happy
if he were alive.

526
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:25,642
If only

527
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,351
that hadn't happened then.

528
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,438
(bitter laughter)

529
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:33,519
(dramatic music)

530
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:36,693
(music fades)

531
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:56,964
CINE-TALK ABOUT "HAROO" WITH CINEMA

532
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:10,678
(tired sigh)

533
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,450
I'm going to film it here.

534
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:28,868
While I was watching the commercial,

535
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:32,829
it was so clear how much
the father loves the daughter.

536
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:37,673
I know what that feels like.

537
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:42,417
You want to keep that person in your heart
and look at them, so you film them.

538
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:45,642
The way Director Hong Sungjoon filmed you.

539
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:48,045
I'm also going to make
the commercial with that mindset.

540
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,644
This project
became very special to me, too.

541
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:53,984
(calm music)

542
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:57,105
So, Yesool,

543
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,573
when are you going to go on
our second date?

544
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,025
I have to tell you something.

545
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,243
(laughs)

546
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:17,833
Excuse me.

547
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,253
I'm telling you,
I'm really dating Cha Minhu.

548
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:22,206
Wow, I haven't busted out laughing
like that in a while.

549
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,377
Seriously.
(laughing)

550
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:25,513
Unbelievable.

551
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:30,217
-Anyway, we are really dating, so...
-Stop.

552
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,770
Do you think that
you can get rid of me over that?

553
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:36,979
And while you and I were together,
you badmouthed him so much.

554
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,861
Do you really expect me to believe that?

555
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:44,242
(slurps)

556
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:46,646
(exclaims)

557
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,030
I'll kill that Cha Minhu.

558
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,290
I'm going to drink all this today,
and go kill him.

559
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:55,906
-Don't stop me.
-I won't.

560
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,329
LEESULO

561
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,880
-(slurps)
-(glass thuds)

562
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,959
-I have to go now. Don't stop me.
-I won't stop you.

563
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:03,125
-Don't stop me.
-I won't!

564
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:04,422
Just one more glass.

565
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:06,665
(upbeat music)

566
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:13,926
(singing) <i>♪ Who's the stupid bitch

567
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:16,225

579
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,249
I'll just drink.

580
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,669
(sighs)
Damn it.

581
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,960
Yeah!

582
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:54,467
You don't have an IQ of 50
nor are you sadistic.

583
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:57,846
Oh, it just worked out that way.

584
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,394
Whether you believe me or not.

585
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:00,727
Tell me if it's true.

586
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,105
Tell you what?

587
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,864
How did you two start?

588
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:07,902
(light music)

589
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:15,326
(light music continues)

590
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,171
Oh.

591
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,711
Come on, really.

592
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,384
If you're going to come up
with such a scenario,

593
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:27,802
you should've started
from your first meeting him.

594
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,340
How is it so sloppy?

595
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:30,719
Let's go.

596
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:33,894
(strained grunt)

597
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:37,524
(sighs)

598
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:42,306
When I accepted three dates with you,

599
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:45,311
I didn't mean we'd start over again.

600
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:49,985
I just agreed to it because I felt that
we needed some time to have closure.

601
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:52,317
I didn't mean anything by it.

602
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:54,405
(soft music)

603
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:55,867
How come?

604
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,287
Because we wouldn't work out anyway?

605
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,579
(soft music continues)

606
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:07,461
What exactly did you see
that I can never be with you?

607
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,300
Oh...

608
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,472
What do you mean, what did I see?

609
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:17,677
Oh, never mind.

610
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:18,814
What?

611
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,638
Say it if you have something to say.

612
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:25,346
Why don't you ever say
what you want to say?

613
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,942
Would anything change if I said something?

614
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:31,526
How would you know?

615
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:35,411
Once again, you're not going to give me

616
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,493
that chance for things to change?

617
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,120
(light music)

618
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:46,713
What exactly did you see
that I can never be with you?

619
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:50,455
Once again, you're not going to give me
that chance for things to change?

620
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:57,224
I think we're going to have
to add more articles to our contract.

621
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:58,763
-What?
-I don't like it.

622
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:01,217
I didn't realize this before,

623
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:04,307
but I hate it when the woman I like
spends time with another man.

624
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:06,940
Oh, well...

625
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:09,361
I'm telling you this
because you don't know me that well.

626
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,570
But I could be a bit much.

627
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:12,073
Wh... What do you mean?

628
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:13,951
Being possessive and jealous.
Stuff like that.

629
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:15,949
Oh.

630
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,240
(pensive music)

631
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:22,695
What is it?

632
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:25,371
What's going on? Why...

633
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,366
(shushes)

634
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,537
It's Ms. Jo.

635
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:31,129
(Sunhee sighs)

636
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:34,172
Planning Team 1 upsets me so much.

637
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:35,927
Oh, I know.

638
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,588
It's reasonable for us to lose the bid.

639
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:41,467
-But they always compare us to them.
-So discouraging.

640
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:42,808
(sighs)

641
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:45,890
So, I was thinking
let's invest in Hong Yesool.

642
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:46,977
You're right.

643
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:48,901
We must get the PPM this time.

644
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,770
Hey, we'll all shave our heads
if we don't get it.

645
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,527
Oh, of course. I'll just die.

646
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:54,068
(Sunhee laughs)

647
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:55,784
(door closes)

648
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,032
But how did you know?

649
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,695
That Ms. Jo was coming in.

650
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,830
What? Are you a psychic?

651
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:07,959
Mr. Cha.

652
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,081
Aren't you curious?

653
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:11,588
About what?

654
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:12,879
The future that I saw.

655
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:16,053
You kept asking me about it,

656
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,684
but why don't you ask anymore?

657
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,338
You said we should date.
That must be the answer.

658
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,638
-You think I'm stupid?
-Huh.

659
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,351
I didn't start this
because of what you saw.

660
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,353
So we don't have to talk about
the future anymore.

661
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:31,726
By the way,

662
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:35,323
are you usually this straightforward
in a relationship?

663
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,953
How did you hold yourself back
all this time

664
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:41,372
when you're so relentless?

665
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:45,446
I have a question.

666
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:50,247
Why didn't you ask me out
if you had feelings for me all this time?

667
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,496
(sighs)

668
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:54,796
Do you really want to know?

669
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:58,336
FIVE YEARS AGO

670
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:00,434
(light music)

671
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:03,795
NAME, RESIDENT REGISTRATION NUMBER,
ADDRESS, CONTACT DETAILS, E-mail

672
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,178
Hong Yesool.

673
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:07,268
We meet at last.

674
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,020
(light music continues)

675
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,700
(music fades)

676
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:31,789
I'm your mentor.

677
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,133
Oh.

678
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:37,881
(quirky music)

679
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:42,892
(sighs)

680
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,182
You can't go dressed like that.

681
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:50,692
Not anywhere.

682
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,308
MINHU: <i>You made it so obvious</i>

683
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,395
that you had a boyfriend all along.

684
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:55,855
FOUR YEARS AGO

685
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,110
(sighs)

686
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:59,186
Cha Minhu, that son of a bitch.

687
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:03,527
The way he talks totally turns me off.
What a pervert.

688
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:06,244
He's dying to torture me 24/7.

689
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:09,825
You'll feel better once you fix your hair.

690
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,424
Feel better.

691
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:14,788
-Feel better!
-(Pilyo and Yesool laughs in distance)

692
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:15,995
Son of a bitch...

693
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:17,085
(awkward music sting)

694
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:18,843
Because I'm such a son of a bitch,

695
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,423
it wasn't easy for me to ask you out.

696
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:22,837
(awkward grunt)

697
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:24,474
(clears throat)

698
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:26,721
And, do you remember that day?

699
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:27,814
MINHU: <i>Why are you crying?</i>

700
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:28,848
Are you getting fired?

701
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:33,557
-Did your boyfriend break up with you?
-Yes, we broke up!

702
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:36,234
(sobbing)
So I can cry now, right?

703
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,484
(crying)

704
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,106
That bastard.

705
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,742
Come on, stop crying.

706
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:43,239
(sobbing)

707
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:46,870
MINHU: Why?

708
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:48,446
What?

709
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:49,584
(meat sizzling)

710
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:51,616
(sniffles)

711
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:56,964
(quirky music)

712
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:01,262
PIG INTESTINES, PORK BELLY, SKIRT STEAK

713
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,549
(Yesool sobbing)

714
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:05,341
(sighs)

715
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,720
-Oh, it's hot.
-It's hot?

716
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:11,104
-Hot. Drink water.
-(crying)

717
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,312
(quirky music continues)

718
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,194
(sighs)

719
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:23,111
(slurps)

720
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,318
I'm never...
(sniffles)

721
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:30,491
...going to date again.

722
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,905
Never in my life.

723
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:35,249
There will never be
another romantic relationship.

724
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,249
But still...

725
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:40,625
What do you mean, still?

726
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:47,125
I'm just going to work
like crazy from now on.

727
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,892
Hey, hey! Hey! Hey!

728
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:54,483
(slurping)

729
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:58,853
-(breathes heavily)
-Hey! Hey.

730
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:01,272
(sighs)

731
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:04,737
Should I...

732
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:07,567
become a nun?

733
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:11,526
I'll just live with God.

734
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:13,948
No man for the rest of my life.

735
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:18,120
(gasps)
Let's... pray.

736
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,497
Amen.

737
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:22,634
(church music)

738
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:26,969
Aren't you going to pray?

739
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,217
Amen.

740
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:30,261
Louder!

741
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:31,684
-Amen.
-Amen!

742
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:32,682
Louder!

743
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,523
-Amen.
-Amen!

744
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,308
Amen!

745
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:37,892
Please forgive us.

746
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:39,811
Amen.

747
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:43,323
Hey, hey, hey.

748
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:44,319
Amen!

749
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,070
I'm just going to shave my head

750
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:50,703
like this, and just go
to a Buddhist temple

751
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:53,241
and train my mind. I'll do a good job.

752
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,618
I'm really good at doing this.

753
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:00,121
That, Amita... What... what was it again?

754
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:01,787
The Amitabha Pure Land Rebirth Mantra?

755
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:04,456
That's right. Amita...
What? One more time.

756
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:07,795
-Nam Amitabha...
-Nam Amitabha Buddha Guanyin Bodhisattva!

757
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:13,103
And then, did you say you wanted
to become a female monk after that?

758
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,506
(awkward laughter)

759
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:19,442
Oh, and, was it about two years ago?

760
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:22,154
And that concludes my presentation.

761
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:23,229
Thank you.

762
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:26,234
(applause)

763
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:32,573
(applause continues)

764
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:46,165
(thuds)

765
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:50,512
(pensive music)

766
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:56,561
Hong Yesool.

767
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:57,969
(frantic breathing)

768
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:00,227
Hong Yesool, Hong Yesool.

769
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,769
Hong Yesool!

770
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:05,612
Over here, to the left.

771
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:10,783
She totally passed out.
She didn't sleep for four days. Four days.

772
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,951
You should lay off a bit.
(clicks tongue)

773
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:14,704
Here.

774
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:19,998
-(Eomji sighs)
-Drink.

775
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,998
(slurps)

776
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,211
(grunt)

777
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:26,003
(smacks lips)
This is...

778
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:28,424
the real deal.

779
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:31,048
Master Cha wants to keep you for himself

780
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:35,425
while making you work late
and through the night.

781
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:37,678
While you're at it,

782
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:40,892
-just date him.
-Shut up!

783
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:42,852
Date Cha Minhu?

784
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:46,857
I would rather dunk my hands
into boiling water.

785
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:49,189
I guess you're going to burn your hands.

786
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:50,443
I will!

787
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:51,896
-Bring me some boiling water.
-Sure.

788
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,566
-(Minhu grunt)
-Hey.

789
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:57,493
-Just drink the juice.
-Scared again, huh?

790
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:58,695
What?

791
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:00,544
(quirky music)

792
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:03,254
-Seungtaek.
-What?

793
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:06,250
Hands will heal if you dunk them
in boiling water, right?

794
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:07,753
Of course. You want to try it?

795
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:11,092
You said you'd dunk your hands
in boiling water if you ever dated me.

796
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:12,511
I tried to protect your hands.

797
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:14,844
(awkward laughter)

798
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:19,009
When and how did you hear all that?

799
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,350
Did you plant a bug on me or something?

800
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:23,976
Are you monitoring me?

801
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:25,556
That's weird.

802
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:28,771
I made sure you weren't around
when I badmouthed you.

803
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:33,031
Are you an alien or something?

804
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:35,147
Or have a special power?

805
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:38,162
(gulps)

806
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,410
(light music)

807
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:49,419
Speak for yourself. You see the future
when you kiss someone.

808
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,004
Oh.

809
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:53,801
I'll get going now.

810
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:55,802
Oh!

811
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:59,045
I want to add the last special clause
to our contract.

812
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:03,346
Kissing.

813
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,181
I'll do it if I want to.

814
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:07,436
Well, I'll find a way.

815
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:11,395
And, if we kiss, you should just...

816
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:13,531
sleep over that night.

817
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,364
Bye.

818
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:18,485
(emotional music)

819
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:25,333
(gasps)

820
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:29,384
Wow. What the heck...

821
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:31,708
Gosh.

822
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:34,461
Why did my heart jump when he said that?

823
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:36,302
Are you a pervert, Yesool?

824
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:37,797
(gasps)

825
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:39,473
He's not listening to this, too, is he?

826
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:42,298
-YESOOL: <i>What the heck...</i>
-(soft chuckle)

827
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:45,716
(whooshing)

828
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:51,269
(gasps)

829
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:55,864
Isn't she just gorgeous?
(exclaims)

830
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:58,533
It really accentuates your curves
even though we're just doing fitting.

831
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:01,072
Ms. Oh, you're stunning.

832
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:02,913
MANAGER: Yes, that's right.

833
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:04,031
Jiyoung.

834
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:06,498
You're the prettiest woman in a dress
that I've seen.

835
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:07,868
(manager grunts)

836
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:12,128
Why aren't you saying anything, Mr. Cha?

837
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:14,754
I called you here because I thought

838
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:16,757
we should make a final decision
on the dress.

839
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:20,132
I'm sorry, but could you give us a minute?

840
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,507
-WOMAN: Sure.
-MANAGER: Yes, sir.

841
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:23,644
Please make yourselves comfortable.

842
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:27,678
(door closes)

843
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:38,032
I heard that Hong Yesool
is Director Lee Pilyo's ex?

844
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:43,163
I guess you knew?

845
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:46,412
Didn't you see the draft I sent you?

846
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,660
I thought I said we needed a design
that allows for movement

847
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:51,786
since you're not going
to be standing still for the commercial.

848
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:53,626
I read it.

849
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:54,879
I did,

850
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:58,129
but I've eaten only ten cherry tomatoes

851
00:45:58,213 --> 00:45:59,723
and one sweet potato for a week.

852
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:02,968
That's how I got this figure.

853
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:05,723
So, if I can't wear the dress I want,

854
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:09,851
do you think I'd be annoyed or not?

855
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:12,100
And if I get annoyed,

856
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:14,896
I'd just let it out
wherever I might be at.

857
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,072
Do you think you can handle that, Minhu?

858
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:18,149
Hey, Oh Jiyoung.

859
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:24,574
Have fun dating Hong Yesool.

860
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:26,365
Now that I think about it,

861
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:29,500
your relationship
won't last that long anyway.

862
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:33,248
So if I stress about it,
that'd just be my loss.

863
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:36,882
You're not going to tell Hong Yesool
about it,

864
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:39,626
and you couldn't even kiss her anyway.

865
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:42,093
A relationship like that
won't last that long.

866
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:44,014
-Isn't that right?
-No, you're wrong.

867
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:47,008
I'm going to kiss Hong Yesool.

868
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:49,095
(dramatic music)

869
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:51,352
What?

870
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:53,848
So you're going to collapse
every time you kiss her?

871
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:54,976
Are you crazy, Minhu?

872
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:57,232
It'll be fine
if Hong Yesool is by my side.

873
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:01,360
So you'll overcome it
with the power of love?

874
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:05,109
-Does that make sense?
-Of course, it doesn't make sense.

875
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:07,067
I couldn't believe it at first, either.

876
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:08,947
I told Dr. Oh about it, too.

877
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:10,906
My symptoms ease up
when I'm with Hong Yesool.

878
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:13,714
Well, that's not why I'm dating her,

879
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:15,959
but the reason I'm telling you this

880
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:18,591
is so that you can stop worrying about me.

881
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:20,503
So...

882
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:23,420
if you kiss Hong Yesool,

883
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:25,552
you get better?

884
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:26,894
To be exact,

885
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:30,926
the symptoms ease up
when she's near me, and I feel better.

886
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:33,176
(snorts)
Minhu.

887
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:35,099
Do you expect me to believe that?

888
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:37,475
It's up to you
whether you believe it or not.

889
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:39,191
(sighs)

890
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:40,608
Jiyoung.

891
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:44,152
You're more important to me
than my own family.

892
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:47,951
I don't want our friendship to suffer.

893
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:53,081
So let's not put any more strain
on our relationship, okay?

894
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:54,541
I'll see you on the set.

895
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:57,621
I'll talk with the director
about changing your dress.

896
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:02,840
(disbelieving grunt)

897
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:07,798
(sobs)

898
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,180
(waves crashing)

899
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:13,518
(suspenseful music)

900
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:21,476
(suspenseful music continues)

901
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:28,574
(grunts)

902
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:30,494
(exhales deeply)

903
00:48:31,658 --> 00:48:32,948
(sighs)

904
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:35,502
(groans)

905
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:39,456
(sighs)

906
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:41,746
(pensive music)

907
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:51,598
LUXURY LAUNDROMAT
CLEANING, WASHING, STITCHING

908
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:54,968
EXEMPLARY BUSINESS

909
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:55,927
(sighs)

910
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:58,603
YESOOL: <i>I had no idea
so many people were busy</i>

911
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:00,515
<i>on the third Saturday of every month.</i>

912
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:07,946
NOEL ORPHANAGE

913
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:10,698
(calm music)

914
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:20,205
WELCOME TO NOEL ORPHANAGE!

915
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:27,375
(calm music continues)

916
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:34,184
(snorts)
What's he doing that's so important

917
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:36,886
that he hasn't called me at all
when it's the weekend?

918
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:39,353
Wait.

919
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:41,694
I wonder if he's ever been
in a relationship before.

920
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:43,561
Hmm.

921
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,480
(clanks)

922
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:51,816
Hong Yesool.

923
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:54,909
Mom?

924
00:49:57,577 --> 00:49:58,697
(grunts)

925
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:01,124
You've gotten a bit older
since the last time I saw you!

926
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:04,418
-Gosh, what in the world!
-(laughs)

927
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:05,631
When did you get here?

928
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:08,171
(laughs)
Just now.

929
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,625
Wait, did you say I look older? Really?

930
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:12,376
-(laughs)
-Hmph.

931
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:14,547
I came straight from the airport,

932
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:17,256
but I couldn't reach you,
and the front door passcode was changed.

933
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:18,643
I waited a long time.

934
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:21,314
Well, you should've told me
you were coming.

935
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:23,731
Then I could've picked you up
at the airport.

936
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:26,652
That's no fun, though.
I wanted to surprise you!

937
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:29,685
I didn't tell you I was coming
so I could see the shock on your face.

938
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:33,526
When are you going to grow up?
Sixty is right around the corner for you.

939
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:37,445
Hey, people think I'm in my early 40s.

940
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:41,124
Gosh, don't believe people like that.
They're scamming you.

941
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:43,618
They'll come looking
to sell something to you.

942
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:46,878
You haven't changed at all.
You're such a stickler.

943
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:48,551
Your dad wasn't like that.

944
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:50,875
Oh, right.

945
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:53,054
I heard that you're doing
a Mopix commercial this time.

946
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:55,013
-Huh?
-(laughs lightly)

947
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:56,143
Yeah.

948
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:59,432
Your dad must be so happy in heaven.

949
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:01,851
Mom.

950
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:05,809
When I was little,
did I ever fall into something?

951
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:07,936
(dramatic music)

952
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:10,280
Why do you bring that up all of a sudden?

953
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:13,027
Well, I've been having
these weird dreams lately.

954
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:15,573
Hey, just quit your job.

955
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:18,485
They must be working you so hard
that you have weird dreams.

956
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:19,695
What are you saying...

957
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:22,407
You just said that Dad would be happy.

958
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:25,616
Do you have those dreams often lately?

959
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,460
Not often. Just a few times.

960
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:33,299
You know how you said Dad and I
got into a car accident?

961
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,590
But how come I have no memory of it?

962
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,137
It's a good thing.

963
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:40,135
If anything, I'm grateful for that.

964
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:42,600
So that you can live
with only good memories.

965
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:45,983
Anyway, are you seeing anyone?

966
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:49,363
Even I'm getting married at this age
because someone fell for me.

967
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:51,319
Yet you're young and alone on the weekend?

968
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:53,897
Oh.

969
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:55,739
I do have someone.

970
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,909
But he has something to do
on the third week of every month.

971
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:01,412
What? You're seeing someone?

972
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:02,583
Who is it?

973
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,210
When can I meet him?

974
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:07,963
Let me see how you behave.

975
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:11,547
You brat.
(laughs)

976
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:13,838
(indistinct chatter)

977
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:20,474
YOUNG YESOOL: <i>Are you a baby?</i>

978
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:25,345
<i>You should clench your fists
and hold back your tears like that.</i>

979
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:27,064
YOUNG MINHU: <i>So what?</i>

980
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:32,073
<i>I heard that crying makes you stronger.</i>

981
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:37,236
YOUNG YESOOL: <i>Play with me!</i>

982
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:40,116
(light music)

983
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:47,327
What are you thinking about so intensely?

984
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:49,535
(laughs lightly)

985
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:51,294
(distant indistinct chatter)

986
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:58,925
-Hello.
-Hello.

987
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,009
Hi.

988
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:05,346
Thank you for always visiting us

989
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,559
and counseling our children, Doctor.

990
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:11,858
I should be the one to thank you.
I feel better after being with the kids.

991
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:13,858
(laughs)

992
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:15,976
Have you been well, Minhu?

993
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:19,821
-Yes.
-Um.

994
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:24,405
As you know, he's always been
a man of few words.

995
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:25,742
(both laugh)

996
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:28,287
It's all right.
(laughs)

997
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:31,121
I've known him ever since
he was at the orphanage.

998
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:33,998
And I know that he cares a lot

999
00:53:34,085 --> 00:53:37,045
about our orphanage
even though he doesn't say much.

1000
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:38,921
(laughs lightly)

1001
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,390
(sighs)

1002
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:45,135
KYUNGSOO: Time sure flies.

1003
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:48,272
Was it somewhere around here?
About this time of the year?

1004
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:49,980
The place where your symptoms manifested?

1005
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:53,442
You told me to focus on the sound
that I wanted to hear.

1006
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:56,320
But I want to know
if I'm just controlling my senses

1007
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:59,189
or if it's a special thing with her.

1008
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:01,396
I didn't have any symptoms
after that, either.

1009
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:02,568
Really?

1010
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:04,946
Could you introduce me to her?

1011
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:06,658
Sure, if I get the chance.

1012
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:08,285
But Doctor.

1013
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:12,708
Do you think one could blackout
if they're traumatized by some incident?

1014
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:13,832
Sure.

1015
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:17,586
Humans try to protect themselves

1016
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:20,171
above everything else,
consciously or unconsciously.

1017
00:54:20,548 --> 00:54:23,338
If it was a huge shock and trauma,

1018
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:25,886
then they could've erased it intentionally

1019
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:28,311
or they could just pretend
it doesn't exist.

1020
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:32,057
Is it possible to selectively erase
the memories

1021
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:33,693
related to a certain place or person?

1022
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:36,981
It's not common,
but it's not entirely impossible, either.

1023
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:40,815
You're asking
a lot of questions today, Minhu.

1024
00:54:40,902 --> 00:54:41,862
(laughs lightly)

1025
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:43,319
Just one more thing.

1026
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:47,831
Are there any other case studies like me
in other regions or countries?

1027
00:54:48,326 --> 00:54:49,616
Well, yeah.

1028
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:52,873
I've attended many conferences
and have read some research papers.

1029
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:56,042
Then, is there a case where some people

1030
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,296
who were in the same place
at the same time

1031
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:00,418
all developed the same symptoms?

1032
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:09,762
(dramatic music)

1033
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:17,395
(sighs)

1034
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,910
(dramatic music continues)

1035
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:37,669
WOMAN (on video): <i>Mopix.</i>

1036
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:40,955
<i>Connecting time.</i>

1037
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:47,885
<i>Racing through life together.</i>

1038
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:51,310
(light music playing)

1039
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:56,812
<i>Thank you, Mopix.</i>

1040
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:03,819
<i>I'm still with you.</i>

1041
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:06,282
(sighs)

1042
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:08,073
CONNECTING TIME, RACING THROUGH LIFE
I'M STILL WITH YOU

1043
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:16,921
Four meters, 900 kilogram, 25 years.

1044
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:21,002
Our time and memories
are contained in those numbers,

1045
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:22,796
whether we want it to or not.

1046
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:26,589
Just like how no one had realized that
Ms. Oh was the little girl in this video.

1047
00:56:26,674 --> 00:56:29,144
But this car had remembered it
for a long time.

1048
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:32,014
This commercial,
which is a part of this video,

1049
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:35,017
was a commercial
that was created 25 years ago,

1050
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,480
when Mopix V3 was launched.

1051
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:39,439
The interesting thing is that
both of the people in this video

1052
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:40,771
have a connection to Mopix.

1053
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:43,151
As you all know, one of them

1054
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,823
is our model Ms. Oh Jiyoung, the actress,

1055
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:48,985
and the other person is both the star
and inspiration of this commercial,

1056
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,700
AE Ms. Hong Yesool.

1057
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:53,281
And the creator of this commercial is...

1058
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:57,118
The father of Ms. Hong Yesool.

1059
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,380
Director Hong Sungjoon.

1060
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:02,376
How did you know?

1061
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:07,420
Mr. Cha came to see me every day,
telling me about the meeting content

1062
00:57:08,049 --> 00:57:11,049
and tried to rebuild trust.

1063
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:13,176
He gave me a lot of materials
on Ms. Hong as well,

1064
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:15,813
saying that she was
in charge of this project.

1065
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:18,140
(light music)

1066
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:21,649
I really like this.

1067
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,650
Let's go with this.

1068
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:28,236
(laughs lightly)

1069
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:33,485
Also, I would like Ms. Hong
to be in charge of this.

1070
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:37,867
It's been 25 years.
I think it'll be very meaningful.

1071
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:40,459
(light music continues)

1072
00:57:44,669 --> 00:57:45,959
(indistinct chatter)

1073
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:50,220
(music fades)

1074
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:53,505
(sighs)

1075
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:56,135
It really turned out
the way Mr. Cha had predicted.

1076
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:03,647
Let's just wrap this up
by sending Ms. Hong to Planning Team 2.

1077
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:06,733
If we don't do that,
we can't stop our auditing department

1078
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:09,276
nor Mopix's audits.

1079
00:58:09,694 --> 00:58:15,584
What will you do if Mopix wants Ms. Hong
to get involved in this project?

1080
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:17,621
Hmm...

1081
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:20,869
Do you have something in mind?

1082
00:58:21,414 --> 00:58:22,754
If that happens,

1083
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:25,671
please promise me
that you'll reinstate her right away.

1084
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:30,007
We'll put Ms. Hong on it right away.

1085
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,800
(light music)

1086
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:37,847
(sighs)

1087
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:46,015
Do you want to be in charge
of the lingerie PPM coming up?

1088
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:47,819
Let us, Planning Team 2,

1089
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:50,989
get off to a good start
with our new member.

1090
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:52,994
Let's go for some cash bonus.

1091
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:56,066
Let's have our team highlight
be displayed in the lobby, too.

1092
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:58,621
I won't make you
work late like you-know-who.

1093
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:01,196
I think she'll have to work late.

1094
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,290
Mr. Cha, what are you saying,
showing up out of nowhere?

1095
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:06,084
I just got approval to reinstate Ms. Hong.

1096
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:07,503
What?

1097
00:59:07,752 --> 00:59:10,002
She'll go back
to Planning Team 1, as of now.

1098
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:12,218
(uplifting music)

1099
00:59:16,594 --> 00:59:19,144
Congratulations! It feels so new
and special now that you're back!

1100
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:20,642
Welcome, Ms. Hong!

1101
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:21,933
I drew that heart.

1102
00:59:22,433 --> 00:59:24,893
-Thank you, everyone.
-(Sanggoo laughs)

1103
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:28,269
It's going to get busy around here,

1104
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:30,686
so make sure to take care
of your own schedules and health.

1105
00:59:30,775 --> 00:59:33,855
I would like you to know
that we would be so happy

1106
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:35,235
if we got busier than we are now.

1107
00:59:35,321 --> 00:59:36,611
-Ms. Kim.
-Yes?

1108
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:38,988
Put Ms. Hong in charge of everything
that's been going on.

1109
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:39,985
Yes.

1110
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:43,246
(uplifting music continues)

1111
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:46,496
Congratulations, Ms. Hong.

1112
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:48,248
Thanks.

1113
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:52,956
(sighs)

1114
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:58,257
REGARDING MOPIX

1115
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:01,222
(keyboard clacking)

1116
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:03,636
(phone buzzing)

1117
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:05,885
LEE PILYO

1118
01:00:06,894 --> 01:00:07,904
Hello.

1119
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:10,399
You heard, right?
Congratulations on your reinstatement.

1120
01:00:10,481 --> 01:00:11,521
Thank you, Director.

1121
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:14,148
Once again, I look forward
to working with you, Ms. Hong.

1122
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:16,821
All right. Shall we have a meeting
on our schedule today?

1123
01:00:16,904 --> 01:00:17,954
What do you want to do?

1124
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:19,781
Should I go there, or
do you want to come here?

1125
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:20,906
What works for you?

1126
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:23,791
Never mind.
I'll go to the office right now.

1127
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:25,460
Okay.

1128
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:29,039
Oh, the papers!
(strained grunt)

1129
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:31,535
(paper rustles)

1130
01:00:35,381 --> 01:00:36,471
(sighs)

1131
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:43,968
POST-EVENT AGREEMENT (EDITED)

1132
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:46,057
(dramatic music)

1133
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:57,202
Oh...

1134
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,910
(paper rustling)

1135
01:01:03,409 --> 01:01:04,619
(phone buzzing)

1136
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:11,250
PILYO: <i>I don't think that
we should talk about this at work.</i>

1137
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:12,504
<i>Come to our hangout.</i>

1138
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:17,383
I'M COMING PALME D'OR HOLLYWOOD!
I'M GOING TO GET IT!

1139
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:19,505
(dramatic music)

1140
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:24,643
Did something happen to you
while I was gone?

1141
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:27,311
I realize that there have been
many surprises ever since I got back.

1142
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:28,602
But this isn't even funny.

1143
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:30,725
For the first time,
I want to agree with what you said

1144
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:32,862
about how you're not
the same Hong Yesool I used to know.

1145
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:36,607
The contract will be terminated
as soon as the future is realized?

1146
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:38,238
What does this mean?

1147
01:01:39,737 --> 01:01:41,407
Don't you know how people are these days?

1148
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:43,779
People want to have proof
even in their relationships.

1149
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:46,987
I just suggested to Mr. Cha that
we should date to fit the current trend.

1150
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:48,368
I was just messing with him.

1151
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:50,995
What kind of future did you see
with Cha Minhu?

1152
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:53,669
We just settled on a secret code for us.

1153
01:01:54,752 --> 01:01:57,002
Don't you know that
lovers do all kinds of things?

1154
01:01:57,088 --> 01:01:59,668
I mean, even when we were dating,

1155
01:01:59,757 --> 01:02:01,927
we didn't want our friends to find out
since we were a campus couple.

1156
01:02:02,009 --> 01:02:03,719
So we came up with our own codewords.

1157
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:05,557
(sighs)

1158
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:09,808
It's private. Keep your nose out of it.

1159
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:12,232
Do you draft a legal document
about something that's so private?

1160
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:15,395
You're dating Cha Minhu
while writing contracts like these?

1161
01:02:15,481 --> 01:02:17,111
And you want me to believe that right now?

1162
01:02:17,191 --> 01:02:19,491
(dramatic music continues)

1163
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:24,491
I was going to wait

1164
01:02:25,491 --> 01:02:26,701
until you told me about it.

1165
01:02:30,872 --> 01:02:32,502
But I can't wait any longer.

1166
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,792
I don't think
you'll ever tell me about it.

1167
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:38,880
The reason you're dating Cha Minhu

1168
01:02:39,505 --> 01:02:42,425
is the same as the reason
you broke up with me, right?

1169
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:47,851
I always knew

1170
01:02:49,348 --> 01:02:50,728
that you can see the future.

1171
01:02:54,896 --> 01:02:56,896
(closing theme music)
