1
00:00:01,042 --> 00:00:03,422
(sighs)
Let's do it.

2
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:05,009
Pardon?

3
00:00:05,296 --> 00:00:06,296
Let's do it.

4
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:13,643
Tonight is good.

5
00:00:14,472 --> 00:00:16,772
But I have one condition.

6
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:20,654
Condition?

7
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:23,824
What condition?

8
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,190
What are you talking about?

9
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:35,794
(theme music)

10
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:27,998
What were you guys talking about?

11
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,838
What was the deal you two
were about to make?

12
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,053
Minhu.

13
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:33,592
-What condition? What is it?
-Get in.

14
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,393
What were you guys talking about?

15
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,641
You can't just come in and out of here
when you want to.

16
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:40,813
You keep ignoring my texts. That's why.

17
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,691
Did you forget our dinner plans tonight?

18
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,230
Jeez, I never said I'd go.

19
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:48,233
-I never said you didn't have to come.
-Is your manager on the first floor?

20
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:51,106
I mean, Minhu,
why do you always work late with her?

21
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,606
You even let her in your place.

22
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:55,195
Are you two seeing each other? Is that it?

23
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,741
Stop talking nonsense.

24
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:57,905
(sighs)

25
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:01,253
(tuts)
Does Hong Yesool know about your secret?

26
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,246
Would she still go out with you

27
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,293
even if she knew your secret?

28
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:12,417
I know everything about you,
so it doesn't matter.

29
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:15,927
But would any other woman
go out with you if they knew?

30
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,180
(inhales)
Minhu.

31
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,773
(sighs)
I'm the only one

32
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,601
who can understand you.

33
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,894
(light music)

34
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:29,977
(exhales sharply)

35
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,864
(sighing)

36
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,605
(exhales deeply)

37
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,578
(sighs)

38
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,000
(sighs deeply)

39
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:44,708
(footsteps approaching)

40
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,670
Well...

41
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:57,509
are you going out with Ms. Oh Jiyoung?

42
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,309
Would that change our future?

43
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:04,925
No.

44
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:08,978
So getting back
to what we were talking about earlier,

45
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,694
what kind of condition
are you talking about...

46
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:17,028
(sighs deeply)

47
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,738
Why do you always stare at me like that?

48
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,293
Tell me what the deal is.

49
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,377
Never mind. Let's talk again tomorrow.

50
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:35,761
Well...

51
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,259
(sighs deeply)

52
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:44,471
(sighs)

53
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:51,814
(sighs deeply)

54
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,113
Would she still go out with you

55
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:56,777
even if she knew your secret?

56
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,156
(dramatic music)

57
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:12,457
What happened
to the Mopix contract renewal?

58
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:17,263
Well, you said their additional terms
were too strict

59
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,640
and you didn't want it. So I believe
the President turned it down. Why?

60
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,103
Where's the President right now?

61
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,176
Just a second.

62
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,893
(sighs)

63
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,739
(exhales deeply)

64
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,366
(suspenseful music)

65
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,382
(siren blaring)

66
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:05,847
(gunshots)

67
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,228
(siren blaring continues)

68
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,646
(exhales deeply)

69
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,658
(chuckles)

70
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:31,913
(grunts)

71
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,264
You're so transparent.

72
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,349
How could you mix work
and personal feelings?

73
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,188
What do you mean?

74
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:54,809
I can tell right off the bat.

75
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:57,146
By your facial expression,
your gaze. I know it all.

76
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,320
Here's the evidence.

77
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,439
ZEU AD too.

78
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,947
You asked us to get you
all the information on Planning Team 1,

79
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:07,369
except for Ms. Hong Yesool.

80
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,700
Do you think we can tell or not?

81
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:13,746
Every time you drink, you're
always saying, "Hong Yesool, Yesool."

82
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:15,791
(sighs)
My goodness.

83
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,125
Huh?

84
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,420
But...

85
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,378
isn't the "Reunion" script
about that, too?

86
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,879
(sucks air)
It's obviously an epilogue to "Haroo."

87
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,638
With all your wishful thinking.

88
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,506
TITLE: REUNION

89
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,349
You think so?

90
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,183
Does it seem like that?

91
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:36,808
Wow, but how did you finish
this in three days?

92
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,606
(exclaims)
As expected.

93
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,613
What?

94
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:43,071
Did you really write about
your own wishful thinking?

95
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,863
(sighing)
Let's just unpack.

96
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,276
(sighs)

97
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:52,659
You have to be here alone for a while.
I'm so worried.

98
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,748
Oh, right. Did you hear that?

99
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,962
Our neighbor, two doors down,
was robbed during the day.

100
00:06:58,042 --> 00:06:59,132
My gosh.

101
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,960
So make sure you lock up the place
at all times.

102
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,894
What the heck? Are you listening to me?

103
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:14,230
Yeah. Don't worry about me.
Make sure you eat well.

104
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:18,017
-And take care of your health.
-(Howoo scoffs)

105
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:20,112
Yesool, why are you saying
such an obvious thing

106
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:21,319
when you don't even mean it?

107
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,238
It looks like something's up. Huh?

108
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:26,776
What is it?

109
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,493
What is it?
Tell me what happened. Spill it.

110
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:30,624
Hurry.

111
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,370
Gosh.

112
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:34,946
(whispers)

113
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,157
(gasps)

114
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,121
Cha Minhu suggested you sleep together?

115
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,878
Cha Minhu, he's totally nuts.

116
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,091
No.

117
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,211
I suggested it first.

118
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,125
Then you're a crazy bitch.

119
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,376
Gosh. Hey.

120
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,718
You told me to sleep with him
and get it over with.

121
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,182
That's right. I did, didn't I?

122
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,644
I'm the crazy bitch.

123
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,184
(quirky music)

124
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,137
So? When are you going to sleep with him?

125
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:02,153
Well, he said anytime would be fine.

126
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,571
Wow!

127
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:06,321
But then he suddenly said
there's a condition.

128
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,742
A condition? What condition?

129
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,068
(gasps)
Does he like it a certain way?

130
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,027
Does he want to do it not once
but at least twice?

131
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:14,157
My gosh!

132
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,004
(sighs)

133
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,209
What could be that condition?

134
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:21,209
(sucks air)
Wait.

135
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:24,302
I think I've seen something
like this before.

136
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:30,045
Wait. Wait. Wait a minute.

137
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,230
Ta-da!

138
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,139
FIFTY SHADES OF GREY

139
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,692
Are you crazy?

140
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,231
What? It's totally possible.

141
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:46,783
Who knows?

142
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:52,032
(light music)

143
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:04,424
(gasps)

144
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:09,013
(footsteps approaching)

145
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,393
(Minhu laughs)

146
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,058
(shouts)

147
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:25,364
(moans in pain)

148
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,442
(sighs)

149
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,824
Let us enjoy and satisfy my fetish.

150
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:36,334
SLAVE CONTRACT

151
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,489
Seriously...

152
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,617
(giggles)

153
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,333
S&M? Role play?

154
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,456
-You want to do this?
-We're adults here!

155
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,042
What's wrong with role-playing?

156
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:47,798
Well, role-playing...

157
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,796
That's too much.

158
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,340
And playing with sex toys.

159
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:52,764
Is that possible?

160
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:53,762
That's nothing.

161
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:57,598
I want to do it outdoors too.
(laughs)

162
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:01,099
(laughing continues)

163
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,353
Gosh, no way!

164
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,517
Hey.

165
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,065
He may have a nasty temper,
but he's not a pervert.

166
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,399
(scoffs)
Yesool.

167
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:11,823
You said he always keeps his word, right?

168
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:15,202
He has good business ethics, precise,
intelligent, and thorough with his work.

169
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,122
Lots of guys like that are pervs.

170
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,575
Gosh, that can't be.

171
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,373
I'd rather...

172
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:27,459
(light music)

173
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,303
-What are we doing here...
-I've already made an appointment.

174
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,385
You just need to go in
and run a few tests.

175
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,641
What tests?

176
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,972
I think this is showing courtesy
to each other.

177
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:45,348
Let's do it after making sure we're clean
and don't have any medical issues.

178
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,729
These are my test results.

179
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:54,654
(Minhu laughs)

180
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,786
Mmm! That's not bad.

181
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,370
That's about having manners
and etiquette toward one another.

182
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,035
If that's his condition,

183
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,084
I'd say he's kind of a nice guy.

184
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,710
Jeez, forget it.

185
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,627
My head hurts more when I talk to you.

186
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,335
Just pack your things already.

187
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:17,049
Did you pack your battery charger
and adapter?

188
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:17,974
Huh?

189
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,934
(gasps)
Oh, right. Thank you.

190
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,774
My goodness. Seriously.

191
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,856
(sighs)

192
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,273
(sighs deeply)

193
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:34,815
(moans in frustration)

194
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:40,156
The key concept that I recommend
is "Reunion."

195
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:44,366
A couple fell madly in love in their 20s
but had to part ways for some reason.

196
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,250
Then one day, they reunite in their 70s
and live happily ever after.

197
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,575
The whole story revolves
around a Mopix V9.

198
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,633
Like in a parallel universe concept.

199
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,510
What does a reunion have to do with Mopix?

200
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:59,428
Just like Mopix's long history,
I'm sure many people have experienced

201
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,970
the process of meeting, parting
and then reuniting with Mopix.

202
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,514
Despite that, I want to emphasize

203
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:06,307
that what ultimately remains
is Mopix in the end.

204
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,522
That sounds really good.

205
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:10,151
Don't sentimental stories
like this sell these days?

206
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,439
-Mm-hmm.
-In such a short amount of time.

207
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:13,693
I respect you for that.

208
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,440
Who do you think would be a good model?

209
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:19,317
I'd like to find someone
from everyday people.

210
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,355
Ah.

211
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,618
This says Oh Jiyoung is the model.

212
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:26,001
OH JIYOUNG, MOPIX'S MUSE, CONTRACT RENEWED

213
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,418
Please explain how this happened.

214
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,549
First of all, let me apologize.

215
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,090
We should've called you first
and explained the situation.

216
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,928
I'm sorry you had to find out
from an article.

217
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,260
It's not like I don't know
how things go in this field.

218
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:46,216
I totally understand the situation.

219
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:49,352
But my storyboards and Oh Jiyoung
aren't compatible.

220
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,895
I can't work with that actress.

221
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:54,862
I'm sorry, Director Lee,
but we can't change the model.

222
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,902
How can you say that right now?

223
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:59,534
Don't you even have an intention
to make an effort?

224
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,489
I believe open and frank communication
is important at times like this.

225
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:06,744
Mopix wanted to renew their contract
with Ms. Oh Jiyoung.

226
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:07,697
(Pilyo sighs)

227
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,037
Based on my conversation
with them this morning,

228
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,461
I don't think they'll reconsider.

229
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:11,709
(sighs deeply)

230
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,705
(sighs)

231
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,298
(exhales deeply)

232
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,967
Creating good advertising campaigns
is an important part of our job,

233
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:26,102
but our priority is to create campaigns
that our clients want.

234
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,260
(scoffs)

235
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:30,228
I wouldn't have signed on with you
had I known this would happen.

236
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,899
But you've already signed on with us.

237
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:36,569
(scoffs)

238
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,819
Whoa, this is how you stab
someone in the back.

239
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,572
Instead, we'll stick to your storyboards

240
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,164
and minimize the number of revisions
as much as possible

241
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,487
so things proceed the way
you originally intended.

242
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,866
Our team will do our best
to support you in that.

243
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,964
Our team is very competent.

244
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,499
Please count on us.

245
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,961
I mean, how do you plan on supporting me?

246
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,843
Can you just plug someone in there?

247
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,760
I was thinking of someone in their 70s.

248
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,339
Are you going to put special effects
makeup on Oh Jiyoung or what?

249
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:04,184
How do you plan to do that?

250
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:07,352
Shouldn't you get Ms. Oh's approval first?

251
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:12,475
If you insist,
I'll persuade Ms. Oh Jiyoung.

252
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:13,983
Bravo.

253
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:17,436
-You really are going to persuade her?
-Yes.

254
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,073
Even though it's someone
with gray hair and bald?

255
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:22,186
We'll hire the best special effects
makeup team.

256
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,534
For your information,
it's supposed to be an old man.

257
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:28,413
Ms. Oh had portrayed a role of a woman
dressed up as a man in a movie before.

258
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:30,042
I'm sure she can pull it off just fine.

259
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:34,289
But would people want to see Oh Jiyoung
dressed up as an old man?

260
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:38,037
If that's what you want,
we'll make it happen.

261
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,337
Please tell me
if there's anything else you want.

262
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,632
(sighs)

263
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,125
By the way,

264
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:47,846
I thought the storyboards you sent me
were about two lovers reuniting.

265
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:50,098
When did it change to an old man concept?

266
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,386
(sighs)

267
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,562
I think this is enough.

268
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:02,032
Why don't we talk like professionals
from now on?

269
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,407
(sighs)

270
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:07,488
(scoffs)

271
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,330
(chuckles)

272
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,003
I think it was my third year as an AE.

273
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,501
The day before
the Juno Automobile's commercial

274
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,503
was released, the model got arrested.

275
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,544
For what? For drunk driving.

276
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,208
It was a car commercial,
and he got caught drunk driving.

277
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,506
-So what could I do?
-So what happened?

278
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,630
What else could we do?
We had to shoot it again.

279
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,837
There are so many variables in this field.

280
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,678
But I love Oh Jiyoung.

281
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,890
If we change the model,

282
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,845
so many things have to change
in the proposal.

283
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,936
All the late hours we put in are reset

284
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,941
and we have
to start all over again working late.

285
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,613
(sighs)
We still get paid overtime, though.

286
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:44,942
That's true.

287
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,357
By the way, where did Yesool go?

288
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:49,698
(sighs deeply)

289
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,825
Let's talk for a minute.

290
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,706
I had no idea ZEU AD would work this way.

291
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,165
I'm learning a life lesson here
once again.

292
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:08,183
I'll be sure to remember
to put this in my next contract.

293
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:11,638
We're very sorry
about how things went as well.

294
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,600
(sighs)

295
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,560
I'm sure you've discussed this
with Mr. Cha, so let's talk about work.

296
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,226
What's this?

297
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,733
I've written down some ways
to reduce the number of revisions.

298
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,736
Do you think we can meet
the deadline this way?

299
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,239
We'll have to make it happen.

300
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,359
I'll see you at the next meeting.

301
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:32,664
We've talked enough about work.

302
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:35,655
Shouldn't we finish talking about us now?

303
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,117
You still haven't

304
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,672
answered to my suggestion yet.

305
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,921
I need more time to think about it.

306
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:53,966
(sighs)

307
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,101
(clears throat)

308
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:06,316
Director Lee, I know you're not
in a good mood today.

309
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,860
(inhales deeply)

310
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:11,323
Here's a list of interview questions
for today. Please review them beforehand.

311
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,617
(sighs)

312
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:24,592
Director Lee, this is your last interview.
Please do your best.

313
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,880
I always do.
But the questions aren't the best.

314
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,838
I don't want to give the same answers
to every interview either.

315
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:35,427
Oh, my. Aren't you Director Lee Pilyo?

316
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,682
-Huh? Where?
-(crowd gasps)

317
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,425
I actually saw a sign

318
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:42,726
that said, "Talk with Director Lee Pilyo"
at the entrance earlier.

319
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:45,521
(chuckles)
But I didn't expect to see you here.

320
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,613
Oh, I was invited to the premiere.

321
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:54,489
But the movie was too boring,
so I walked out.

322
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:58,117
But they said my presence alone
would be a good promo.

323
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,369
(chuckling awkwardly)
I see.

324
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:03,615
You read the article, right?

325
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,167
I'm so honored.

326
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,380
I've wanted to work
with you, Director Lee.

327
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,420
And this is how we connect.

328
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:14,593
Well, we'll have to see if it turns out
to be a good thing or a bad thing.

329
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,175
Sorry?

330
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:20,517
Mr. Cha told you
what kind of concept it is, right?

331
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:24,519
Well, I can work with any concept.

332
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,233
That's why people say
I'm "Perfect Actress,"

333
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,404
"Every Character, Role of a Lifetime"

334
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,903
and "Every Moment is Her Peak, A Legend."

335
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:34,065
(smacking lips)
I'm sure you've heard them all, right?

336
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,374
So you're sure you can play any role?

337
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:39,118
-Of course.
-(sucks air)

338
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,041
I think it could be
a little difficult, though.

339
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,660
Hmm, no, no, no.

340
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,406
There is no way.

341
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,963
The character is seventy-something.

342
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,212
Excuse me?

343
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:54,166
And for your information, it's an old man.

344
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,590
What?

345
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,100
(chuckles)
Director Lee, it's almost time.

346
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:02,389
Oh, it's almost time for my interview.
See you next time.

347
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,483
Oh, Director!

348
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,402
(clamoring)

349
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,820
Hey, did I just mishear him?

350
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:13,941
An old man?

351
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:16,487
(stuttering)
No. I think that's what I heard too.

352
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,323
(gasps)
Hey.

353
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,080
Call the President right now!

354
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,200
Oh, okay.

355
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,616
(sighs)

356
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:28,834
(sighs)

357
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,213
MINHU: Thank you.

358
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,091
(slurps)

359
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,836
Are you traumatized over this?

360
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:41,257
It's not the first time
something like this has happened.

361
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,506
No.

362
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,098
I've already given Director Lee
a revised proposal.

363
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,600
I'm totally fine.

364
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,268
Really?

365
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,685
Then is it me?

366
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,106
Going back to what
we were talking about last night.

367
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,738
Let me ask you one thing.

368
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,991
(stuttering)
What... what... what about it?

369
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:02,906
(sucks air)
Is it the future you saw the reason

370
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,373
you want to sleep with me?

371
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,251
Well, yes.

372
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,997
To be honest,
I spend most of my time with you.

373
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:13,795
Ever since seeing our future,

374
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:17,883
I feel like suffocating
every time I see you at work or off-site.

375
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:19,885
I just want to be at ease.

376
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:23,718
Then,

377
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,140
after sleeping with me,

378
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,888
do you think you'll be at ease?
Do you think that'll happen?

379
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,068
-Yes.
-Really?

380
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:34,975
Yes.

381
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:39,278
Fine. Then come over to my place tonight.

382
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:40,658
Okay.

383
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:43,828
(sucks air)

384
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:47,333
(quirky music)

385
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,384
(breathes nervously)

386
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:56,214
(pants)

387
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,507
Calm down, Hong Yesool.

388
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,380
No need to be in shock.
(breathes deeply)

389
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:03,007
This is what you wanted.
(gasps)

390
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,545
But this soon?

391
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,472
This is going too fast.
(gasps)

392
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:10,097
No. You wanted to get it over with.

393
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:12,726
It's better to get it over with.

394
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:16,323
(breathing roughly)
It's all right. I'll be fine.

395
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,987
By the way,
I'm not wearing nice lingerie...

396
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:26,118
Huh?

397
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,405
Wait a minute.

398
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:34,252
(romantic music)

399
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:44,512
(light music)

400
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:07,742
And what's next?

401
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:10,701
Next?

402
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,749
You took off your dress shirt...

403
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,957
What were you doing
while I was doing that?

404
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,970
I... I was getting undressed too.

405
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:24,972
That can't be.

406
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,757
-Sorry?
-I usually undress them.

407
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:32,142
Well, ma... maybe we were in a rush.

408
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,063
We're that into each other?

409
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:35,693
(inhales deeply)

410
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,861
So, we get undressed.

411
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:39,818
And after that...

412
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,071
Did you kiss me first?

413
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,528
-Well.
-(grunts)

414
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:49,624
What does that matter?

415
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,331
Of course, it matters.

416
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:55,831
I need to know how we progress,
so I can figure out how I feel that day.

417
00:22:55,916 --> 00:23:00,126
It has nothing to do with your feelings.
It just happens because we are drunk.

418
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,090
So what you're saying is

419
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:06,302
we rushed into the bedroom
from the entrance kissing nonstop.

420
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,795
(sucks air)
Man, I just don't get it.

421
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,314
What don't you get?

422
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:16,848
I'd never act emotionally like that
no matter how drunk I am.

423
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:19,652
How many times do I have to tell you?

424
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,941
Neither one of us was in our right mind.

425
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:26,281
Even though a pot broke,
we came in here in a flash.

426
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:27,952
Break what?

427
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:29,407
A potted plant.

428
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:31,373
Jackson?

429
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:34,406
This one.

430
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,711
That broke? Really?

431
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,170
Yes.

432
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:40,881
Is it something you treasure?

433
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:43,625
I don't get it.

434
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:47,092
I broke Jackson,
yet I still went into the bedroom?

435
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,550
No way.

436
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:55,269
What do you mean?
Are you suggesting that I'm lying?

437
00:23:55,684 --> 00:24:00,154
I'll say it again.
You were the one who pushed me this way.

438
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,979
That means you broke it.

439
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,533
That's right.

440
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,859
Then shall we put it somewhere else
just in case?

441
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,695
-Jackson. Jackson?
-Yeah.

442
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:11,696
-Be careful.
-Oh. Let's go.

443
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,740
Oh, put it there.

444
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:17,498
-Yes. No, no. More to the right.
-To the right...

445
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:21,075
(shatters)

446
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,212
(shouts)

447
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,342
(moans in shock)

448
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,300
(moans in shock)

449
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,256
(gasps)

450
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,433
-Oh.
-(moans in shock)

451
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:35,394
Well...

452
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,354
(moans in shock)

453
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:44,687
I'm sorry.

454
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:47,735
I'll get you the same thing.

455
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,568
This thing came across the ocean.

456
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:52,026
There were only two in the country.

457
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:56,329
Oh. Well...
(sighs)

458
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:59,334
(sighs)

459
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,792
Forget it. Don't worry about it.

460
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,837
It's not the first time
you have broken something.

461
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,343
(sighs)

462
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:17,274
I prepared this just in case.

463
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:31,201
That event is going to happen
and so I believe we need to be prepared

464
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:34,821
for potential problems that may arise
after the event.

465
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,370
ARTICLE 3 (CONFIDENTIALITY)

466
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:42,213
I want to continue to work with you.

467
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:44,749
To be able to see each other even after...

468
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:46,844
Let me ask you one last question.

469
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,300
That day. In the future you saw,

470
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,720
how did I look at you?

471
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,929
(light music)

472
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:09,692
Are you sure we slept together
because we got drunk?

473
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:17,525
Judging from various circumstances,
that seems to be the most likely scenario.

474
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:23,043
But I never have one-night stands
just because I'm drunk.

475
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:28,878
If I do sleep with you in the future,
that's probably because I'm dating you.

476
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:30,462
That's probably why I'd sleep with you.

477
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:33,299
I don't sleep with a woman
I'm not interested in.

478
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:39,469
So, go out with me
if you want to sleep with me.

479
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,311
That's my condition.

480
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,344
What a crazy bastard.

481
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:25,017
What a crazy bastard.

482
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:31,569
What a crazy bastard.

483
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,116
What a crazy bastard.

484
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:42,868
Shit.

485
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:55,384
(sighs)
This is driving me crazy.

486
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,302
(whines)

487
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:04,310
What a crazy bastard. That crazy bastard.

488
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:07,814
DAEHAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

489
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,268
I apologize.

490
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:12,774
I was on call through the night
for the last two nights. So I dozed off.

491
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:15,647
I was supposed to transfer the patient
to the surgery department, but you...

492
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:19,235
It's all right. I understand
you're losing sleep these days.

493
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:22,372
-(laughs)
-I won't run away this time.

494
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,330
If I run away again
after scheduling a surgery...

495
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,451
It happens. It happens.

496
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,538
I never ran away like you
when I was a resident.

497
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:30,463
But I'm sure I wanted to.

498
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:33,884
And the fact that
I'm going out with someone

499
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:37,091
-is all thanks to you, man.
-Oh.

500
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:39,093
-(laughs)
-I heard you're seeing someone?

501
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:40,425
You look very happy.

502
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,350
Hey, hey, guys.

503
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:45,639
Even though your residency is tough,
don't stop dating.

504
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,024
You're not supposed to.

505
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:50,691
More exhausted your life is,
you should date someone

506
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:53,900
and energize your life, you know?

507
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,572
You can take a break, man.

508
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,240
-Stop clubbing, punk.
-(chuckles)

509
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:58,608
How long have you been together?

510
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,735
It's been about a week.
(chuckles)

511
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,122
Wow, it's so dynamic.

512
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:04,028
(chuckles)

513
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,077
Oh!

514
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,697
Did you just hear that sound?

515
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:08,116
-(both exclaim)
-Huh?

516
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:10,464
-(all exclaim)
-Is it my baby?

517
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,370
(laughs)

518
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:12,328
ALARM BREAKUP D-1

519
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,327
Huh?

520
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,671
What's this?

521
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,882
Why does it have to be a week?

522
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,426
(sighs deeply)

523
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:23,549
A day is too short.

524
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:26,596
But if it's longer, we'll end up
showing each other our pathetic sides.

525
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,141
So just one week.

526
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:30,729
I want to show only my best side,
cherish the good memories,

527
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,270
and say goodbye.

528
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:34,612
But still, a week is too short.

529
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:36,858
All right.
Then let's just say goodbye here.

530
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,151
No!

531
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:41,321
I'm sorry.

532
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:45,329
All right. Fine. A week? Okay.

533
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:46,738
BREAKUP D-1

534
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:48,195
Whoa...

535
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,460
Was she serious?

536
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,630
(sucks air)
Or was she joking?

537
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,464
For real?

538
00:29:58,546 --> 00:29:59,836
I don't think so. Was it a joke?

539
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:02,007
(sighs)

540
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:04,763
Excuse me for a second.

541
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,806
BREAKUP D-7

542
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,603
Whoa...

543
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:12,983
I think she meant it.

544
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,690
(chomping)

545
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:25,823
Howoo, shall we go to Brooks this weekend?

546
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,777
It's a hot spot these days.

547
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:30,497
Huh? Isn't that on the underground level
of ZEU AD building?

548
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:32,288
Oh! Have you been there?

549
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:35,332
Yeah, my cousin works there,
so I've only seen it.

550
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:36,996
Your cousin works there?

551
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:39,545
A friend of mine works there too.
He's a planning team chief.

552
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:42,013
Huh? A planning team chief?

553
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,130
Yeah.

554
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:45,552
What's his name?

555
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:51,434
Mr. Cha. Well...

556
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,136
Director Lee wants to rewrite the proposal

557
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:56,307
since the model has been changed
to Oh Jiyoung.

558
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:59,324
He wants more time.
He says he won't be ready by the PPM.

559
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:01,938
All of the locations
are out of the country,

560
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,486
a nature reserve,
or an airport during the day.

561
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:06,741
It will be tough even to attempt
to scout the location...

562
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:08,873
It looks like Director Lee is

563
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,951
quite offended by what happened
the other day.

564
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:18,502
He did say he needs more time
as he cannot meet the deadline.

565
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:21,795
But I think it's more about being upset
rather than a scheduling issue.

566
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,630
I'll talk to him again.

567
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,220
(sighs deeply)

568
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,472
(tuts)

569
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:31,012
We can't put off the PPM.

570
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,770
Either go through our previous proposals
or come up with new ideas.

571
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,901
Let's schedule another meeting
with concept boards.

572
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:43,034
(stuttering)
Yes, sir.

573
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:00,959
(moans)

574
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:02,464
(sighs)

575
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:06,665
The production team gave us feedback
on our storyboards,

576
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,715
so I'm on my way to meet with them.

577
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:13,772
Mr. Cha.

578
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,889
I thought about what you said last night.

579
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,900
I don't think I can say yes.

580
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,151
Is that so?

581
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:22,651
Yes.

582
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:26,279
Of all people, you and me...

583
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,318
I can't imagine it.

584
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:31,913
Okay, I guess I understand.

585
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:34,829
(sighs)

586
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:36,001
Oh, right.

587
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,116
Did you remember what you saw that night?

588
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:41,956
The future you saw
when we kissed in my car.

589
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:43,999
You still don't remember?

590
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,206
(laughs awkwardly)

591
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:48,761
I was so drunk that night.

592
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,934
I must have drunk too much.

593
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:53,431
(sucks air)

594
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,473
Can you really foresee the future?

595
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:56,718
Sorry?

596
00:32:56,808 --> 00:33:00,478
Come to think of it, the location
for the test drive is easy to tell

597
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:03,901
and you broke my cellphone screen.
Didn't you make that happen?

598
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,645
Say what?

599
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:07,743
Why would I do such a thing?

600
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:08,819
I wouldn't know.

601
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:10,073
To get my attention?

602
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,031
You're interested in me, right?

603
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:14,412
What?

604
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:18,865
Aren't you getting out?

605
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,122
I still have some time.

606
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,837
(upbeat music)

607
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:32,968
As you know,
this is my first car ad campaign.

608
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:35,102
How would I know a place for a test drive?

609
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:39,679
Besides, didn't Director Lee take us there
spontaneously, to begin with?

610
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:40,727
Your cellphone too.

611
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:43,100
All right. All right.
Don't get so worked up.

612
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,307
I just threw it out there.

613
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:47,824
I mean, what you just said
doesn't make sense.

614
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,570
Hey, how come so many things
don't make sense to you?

615
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:52,243
It doesn't make sense for you to like me

616
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:54,321
and it doesn't make sense
for us to date, either?

617
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:57,159
Then, do you think
it makes sense, Mr. Cha?

618
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:58,243
Why doesn't it make sense?

619
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:01,367
We're both single.
You're not seeing anyone, are you?

620
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:04,334
Well, what makes you think I'm single?

621
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:05,714
Then do you have someone?

622
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:07,589
If you have someone,

623
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,340
why would you work late
or pull all-nighters

624
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,010
or have a one-night stand with me?

625
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,180
(quirky music)

626
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:24,099
LEE PILYO

627
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:26,064
Hello?

628
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:28,517
I received the revised proposal
with a checklist in the email.

629
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,358
Are you sure you fully understand
my concept?

630
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:31,533
Not only the model,

631
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,531
but do I have to change the locations
to meet your budget?

632
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,121
Let's discuss that in person.

633
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:37,867
I'll set up a meeting right away.

634
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:43,706
And about your suggestion for us
to go on three dates last time.

635
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,081
Fine.

636
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,166
Let's do that.

637
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:52,172
(cell phone beeps)

638
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,219
(quirky music)

639
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:11,149
What did they say?

640
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:16,413
Wait, what now? Did he say no again?

641
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,994
Wow, they have no manners
in the ad industry.

642
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:22,946
They can't adjust the schedule
while bringing up the contract again?

643
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:24,457
Set up a meeting right away.

644
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:27,461
Let's not go easy on them this time.

645
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,376
They must think
they can just push us around.

646
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,671
Let's go over tomorrow
and have it out with them.

647
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:33,835
We can't.

648
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:35,717
What?

649
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,508
I have to go on dates.

650
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,770
I'm going to get my haircut.

651
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:43,979
What? Director.

652
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:46,561
Okay.

653
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:49,233
(groans in frustration)

654
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,823
(sighs)

655
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:52,188
(groans)

656
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:56,948
(exhales deeply)

657
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:59,069
I must've been crazy. I just lost it.

658
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,157
Haejin.

659
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,831
Why am I still alive?

660
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:05,619
It's all right. You needed to hash it out
with Pilyo once and for all, anyhow.

661
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:08,285
(sighs)
I do need to.

662
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:12,754
But I didn't have to set that up
in front of Cha Minhu.

663
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,297
I'm consistently out of my mind
these days.

664
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:17,131
I think I need to see a doctor.

665
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:18,046
Don't be silly.

666
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,554
You have to do things
to make you want to drink,

667
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:22,095
so that small business owners
like me can survive. You did well.

668
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,180
Haejin.

669
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:27,345
In any case, why do you care
about Cha Minhu all of a sudden?

670
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:30,435
What does your date with Pilyo
have anything to do with Cha Minhu?

671
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:33,191
You're acting like you like Cha Minhu.

672
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:34,234
Haejin!

673
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:35,777
Now that I hear you out, he's not so bad.

674
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:38,242
You said he's successful
and well-respected in the industry.

675
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:41,531
Gosh, you say that
because you don't know him.

676
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,326
Not so bad, my ass!

677
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:45,658
Perhaps you don't know him.

678
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,500
What you see isn't everything in a person.

679
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:49,959
(sighs)

680
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:53,094
(slurps)

681
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:54,459
(moans in frustration)

682
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:05,305
Oh, it smells good.
(laughs softly)

683
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:15,023
(sucks air)

684
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:17,937
The pain usually lasted
for a few days, didn't it?

685
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:20,907
(sucks air)
That's odd.

686
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:24,328
-Any other symptoms since then?
-No.

687
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,539
I briefly lost consciousness,

688
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,538
but I was fine when I woke up.

689
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,827
(clears throat)
That lady.

690
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,130
Are you seeing her?

691
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:35,964
Oh.

692
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:38,802
She's just my subordinate at work.

693
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:42,682
(chuckles)
Okay. Okay. It's your personal life.

694
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,800
(sucks air)

695
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:48,466
Your medication started
to have a strain on your brain function

696
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:53,097
and if you rely on drugs too much,
it could cause brain dysfunction.

697
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,610
Anyway, I think it's a good sign.

698
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:59,111
Your hearing is the most sensitive
among your five senses.

699
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,954
It must be very painful
to hear all kinds of sounds,

700
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:03,409
whether you like them or not.

701
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:07,698
So try to focus on the sounds
you want to hear.

702
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,001
The sounds I want to hear?

703
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,579
For example,
the voice of the woman you love.

704
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,996
Like her heartbeat or her nagging voice.

705
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:20,627
You have to find ways to control
your senses on your own like that.

706
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,969
What? Come on, you two.

707
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:27,513
Without me?

708
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:31,059
(chuckles)
Dad!

709
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,692
Why didn't you tell me
that Minhu was coming over?

710
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:35,979
You two are so mean.

711
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:38,153
You had to work today.

712
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:39,862
And Minhu wouldn't come if you were here.

713
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:41,571
Minhu, is that true?

714
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:44,698
I mean, you wouldn't even answer my calls.

715
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:48,445
Are you mad because of the ad?

716
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:49,794
Did you cause trouble again?

717
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:53,156
I mean, Mopix wants me. What can I do?

718
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:00,335
All right. I'll take care of it.

719
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:03,513
Lee Pilyo is a bit particular,

720
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,678
but I've dealt with so many directors.

721
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,350
Just count on me.

722
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:10,138
Come on, Minhu.

723
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:13,312
-I'll take care of it, okay? Minhu.
-Thank you for the food.

724
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,481
I'll stay in touch, Doctor.

725
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:18,231
See? Minhu is leaving because you're here.

726
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,694
Minhu!

727
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:22,186
Are you really mad at me?

728
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:27,161
If you keep ignoring me like this,

729
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:29,579
I'm going to be a real pain on set.

730
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:33,542
You like Hong Yesool, don't you?

731
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,038
Jeez...

732
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:42,459
Why did you stop at that question?

733
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:43,626
Why else?

734
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,760
My goodness.

735
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,007
I've told you a thousand times.

736
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,142
That you're like a younger sister to me.

737
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,311
(sighs)

738
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,346
I've told you a thousand times.

739
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:55,943
That I'm not your younger sister.

740
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:59,767
Check my family register.
I don't have an older brother.

741
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,070
See you at the meeting.

742
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:06,110
If you keep this up,
I'll tell Hong Yesool everything!

743
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:12,541
What the hell.

744
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:15,405
(whines)
You turned around again.

745
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:17,672
Jeez.

746
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:20,128
What now? What?

747
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:21,959
Does that scare you?

748
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:23,174
(sighs)

749
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,344
Don't you dare ignore my calls.

750
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,173
I'll tell her right away.

751
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:29,886
(sighs)

752
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:32,261
(whines)

753
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,940
(sighs)

754
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:58,249
(sighs deeply)

755
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:10,011
Were there any changes in your body
after the accident?

756
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:13,552
(breathes nervously)
I can see everything too well.

757
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,389
And everything is so loud.

758
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:20,055
(breathes nervously)
It feels like

759
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:24,153
everyone is talking in my ear.

760
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:27,901
(sucks air)
Can you elaborate?

761
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,991
(ominous music)

762
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:41,461
Weird things keep popping out.

763
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:42,794
No.

764
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,245
(breathes roughly)

765
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,300
Everything is too loud.

766
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:50,928
I sometimes faint...

767
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:53,928
(pants)

768
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,971
...and have a nagging headache.

769
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,095
(whimpers)

770
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:06,733
MINHU: <i>And my heart is beating like crazy.</i>

771
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:11,950
That's called sensory overload
or information overload.

772
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:15,739
Your five senses are several times
more enhanced than other people.

773
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:19,833
(breathes roughly)
Then what do I do now?

774
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:23,416
Do I have to live with this?
(inhales)

775
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:25,879
You'll be fine if you learn
to control your senses.

776
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:28,673
You can also get some technical help.

777
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:32,424
Of course, I'll help you too.

778
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,142
(sighs)

779
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,009
(breathes nervously)

780
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:40,307
(dramatic music)

781
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,114
OH SEUNGTAEK

782
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:52,323
Hey.

783
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:56,623
(upbeat music)

784
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,342
Can you explain what's going on?

785
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,249
Sure, I'll explain.

786
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:11,666
This is my honey.

787
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:14,678
She said she wanted
to meet you, so I brought her here.

788
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:16,298
Oh, that honey?

789
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:17,545
SEUNGTAEK: Yeah.
(laughs)

790
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,178
How do you like it in bed?

791
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:22,136
Honey, you haven't even asked me that...

792
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:24,354
Oh, she's pretty straightforward.

793
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,935
On the bed versus on a desk.
Do you do it differently?

794
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:30,189
(laughs awkwardly)

795
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:35,284
Well, I just have this incredible urge
to fix you up with my friend.

796
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:37,526
So when was your last relationship?

797
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:41,075
Do I have to answer that?

798
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,040
Are you a good kisser?

799
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:47,787
I can tell you're a very good kisser
by looking at your lips.

800
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:48,995
(laughs awkwardly)

801
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,800
I learned to read faces.

802
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:53,259
So I can just tell.

803
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:55,336
What does my face tell you?

804
00:43:56,258 --> 00:44:00,848
Well... First, you're a workaholic.

805
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:02,849
You stress out your subordinates
a little bit, no.

806
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:05,058
You're a perfectionist
who gives them a tough time.

807
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:07,689
And the tips of your eyebrows tell me

808
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:10,560
that you're very direct
and don't mince words.

809
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:13,898
Gosh, your subordinates
must get hurt a lot.

810
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:17,148
They must have a lot to say.

811
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:21,028
-Be careful walking around at night.
-Gosh, honey. Why do you keep saying that?

812
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:24,410
Wait, your cousin who works at ZEU AD...

813
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:26,502
Are you Ms. Hong Yesool's cousin?

814
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:28,829
Ms. Hong Yesool is your cousin?

815
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:31,625
Ah, no. No.

816
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:34,170
Who's that? Who could it be?

817
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:36,054
(laughs awkwardly)

818
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:39,091
Oh, my goodness. Your glass is empty.

819
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:41,596
Let me pour you a drink.

820
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:46,349
Well, you know, what I'm saying
is that you have a very nice face.

821
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:48,353
That's what I'm saying.

822
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:51,147
-(laughs awkwardly)
-Did I tell you my name?

823
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:54,316
-Huh?
-Did I say your name?

824
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:55,730
Did I?

825
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:57,648
I think you told me his name.

826
00:44:57,736 --> 00:44:59,856
-Oh, did I tell you?
-That's right.

827
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:01,197
(laughs)
Oh, I did.

828
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:03,161
-Yeah, you did, babe.
-Yeah, I did. That's right.

829
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:05,242
(both laugh)

830
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:06,577
-I must've told you. Did I?
-(Howoo laughs)

831
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:07,542
You did.

832
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:09,211
(woman gasps)
My goodness.

833
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:11,535
-WOMAN 2: They stole everything.
-WOMAN 3: Goodness, what in the world!

834
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:13,085
-WOMAN 1: What happened?
-WOMAN 3: My goodness.

835
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:15,548
WOMAN 1: Everything? Oh, my goodness.

836
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:17,009
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

837
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:19,839
-What happened?
-Goodness. You didn't know?

838
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:22,585
The houses in this neighborhood
keep getting burglarized.

839
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:25,678
You know, they take off
with anything worth any money.

840
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:29,444
-Dear, make sure you lock up your place.
-Okay.

841
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:32,058
How could they rob three houses in a day?

842
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:36,066
And they robbed only
a couple of days ago. You watch out too.

843
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,280
Gosh. Okay, okay. Be careful going home.

844
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,950
Since two pretty ladies
live in your house,

845
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:41,158
you should be extra careful.

846
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,412
-WOMAN 1: Did they steal a lot of stuff?
-WOMAN 2: Yeah.

847
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:45,200
-Gosh, I'm so nervous.
-They took everything.

848
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:46,624
Shouldn't we move?

849
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:49,116
What do I do?

850
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:51,165
Did he catch on?

851
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,884
Yesool will chew me out
if she finds out about this.

852
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:56,591
(sighs)

853
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:58,710
She said he's psychic. She was right.

854
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,300
(sighs)

855
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:06,599
What's going on?

856
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:10,601
Why are you sulky?
You haven't said anything since earlier.

857
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:15,773
You.

858
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:18,322
Did you ever ask me?

859
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:21,244
-Huh?
-You know, my friend.

860
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:24,110
You asked so many questions
to a guy you just met.

861
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:27,238
I counted. You asked 32 questions.
Out of those. Whoa.

862
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:30,076
Did you ever ask one of them to me?

863
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:32,832
(sighs)
What's the use of asking those things?

864
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:34,417
What?

865
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:38,004
How could you? Whoa! Jeez!

866
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:41,167
Aren't you curious about me at all?

867
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:42,716
(sighs)

868
00:46:43,258 --> 00:46:44,258
I am.

869
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:46,175
Seungtaek.

870
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:48,142
By chance, do you like me a lot?

871
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,062
No.

872
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:51,564
Did you like me?

873
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:54,305
I do. I like you. I still like you.

874
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,442
I like you a lot.

875
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:00,610
I liked you a lot too, Seungtaek.

876
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:06,107
Give me your cellphone.

877
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:07,778
My phone? Why?

878
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:14,080
DELETE CONTACT

879
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:19,251
I deleted my number.

880
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:21,132
Let's break up.

881
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:24,592
What?

882
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:27,554
Take care.

883
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:29,806
Make sure you don't skip meals.

884
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:33,305
I noticed that you eat too much protein,
thinking back to all our date spots.

885
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:34,812
I know you like those foodie places,

886
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:37,403
but there are many vegan places too
these days.

887
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:39,439
Try those places
with your next girlfriend.

888
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:41,732
You enjoyed them too,
and you're not even vegan.

889
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:45,357
(stuttering)
Wait, what in the world are you saying?

890
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:48,275
(sighs)
It's been exactly a week.

891
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,696
It's been fun.

892
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,370
Goodbye.

893
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:58,166
(dramatic music)

894
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:02,416
(exhales deeply)

895
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:07,723
(sighs)

896
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:15,135
(Minhee yawns)

897
00:48:16,768 --> 00:48:17,938
(Sanggoo moans with fatigue)

898
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:24,738
I guess I've been working here
for too long.

899
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:26,738
I never thought I'd see Hong Yesool
take a day off.

900
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:28,160
Man.

901
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,658
I know.

902
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:32,235
(gasps)
Is she sick or something?

903
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,406
(gasps)
Maybe she's on a date?

904
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:37,084
Hey, stop talking nonsense.
She wouldn't go on a...

905
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:38,674
-MINHU: Let's meet.
-Yes, sir.

906
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:39,749
Oh, okay.

907
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:42,292
(in a teasing voice)
"Stop talking nonsense."

908
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:51,969
(sighs)

909
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:56,143
(exhales)

910
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:03,521
I haven't been here in so long, huh?

911
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:07,610
Nice weather, huh? Perfect for camping.

912
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:10,162
After we go on three dates--

913
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:13,028
I got it. You do your best too.

914
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:17,366
If you don't put in your best effort
and just kill time, I'll be really sad.

915
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,250
(snorts)

916
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:27,756
Oh, boy.

917
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:32,894
(light music)

918
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:42,266
PILYO: Okay.

919
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,940
(light music)

920
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:02,746
It will be perfect here.

921
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,133
The second proposal.

922
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:07,549
We can also highlight the car
in many different ways in this location.

923
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:08,589
(scoffs)

924
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:11,546
Are you here on a date with me,
or are you here to work?

925
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:14,593
I'm about to feel a little bit upset.

926
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,138
So eat this before it gets soggy.

927
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:17,560
Here.

928
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,100
Pop one egg yolk
and keep the other one intact.

929
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:24,555
One bag of vegetable flakes
and one-and-a-half bags of powder.

930
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:25,896
Right? Your preference?

931
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:27,651
Why bother to remember all that?

932
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:30,653
You know me. I'm smart.
I have an even better memory.

933
00:50:31,486 --> 00:50:32,446
That's right.

934
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:35,658
You had such a good memory
that you only did whatever I hated.

935
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:37,031
That's right.

936
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:39,157
You could've told me right there and then.

937
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:42,544
You just kept it all in and picked a fight
over something else. And we'd fight.

938
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:44,122
(slurps)

939
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:45,247
Do you want to fight again?

940
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:50,627
Well, no, I'm just saying
that's how good my memory is.

941
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,890
(slurps)

942
00:50:57,345 --> 00:50:58,505
So how do you feel?

943
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:00,766
About what?

944
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:02,678
How do you feel now that I'm back?

945
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:05,146
How does it feel for me
to be by your side again?

946
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:08,692
What do you mean...

947
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:12,693
You like it? A little nervous excitement?

948
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,820
Are you glad that I'm back?

949
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:17,781
What's with you? You're being so cheesy.

950
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:20,826
I'm not being cheesy.
I'm just being honest.

951
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:23,825
Why? You don't like it?

952
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,633
I've been thinking the whole time.

953
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:29,838
That when I go back,

954
00:51:31,129 --> 00:51:32,459
when I see you again,

955
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:36,133
I'll never do anything to regret again.

956
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:39,934
That I'll say everything
I want to say to you

957
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:42,557
and hear everything from you.

958
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,140
That's what I thought.

959
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:50,980
So I'm really happy today.
(chuckles)

960
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,030
Oh, right.

961
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:57,238
Since you picked this place,
let me do something I want to do too.

962
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:00,778
Go ahead and eat first.

963
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:03,663
(dramatic music)

964
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:38,027
(dramatic music continues)

965
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:03,721
(in English)
Thank you.

966
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:08,598
(in Korean) Is watching your movie
what you wanted to do with me?

967
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:10,812
I'm sure you haven't seen it yet.

968
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,360
How did you know that?

969
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,150
I know what you're like.

970
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:18,817
Remember?

971
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:21,699
We shot our senior project
in that location.

972
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:26,041
As if you knew it was going to rain
all of a sudden,

973
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:28,369
you rearranged our shooting schedule.

974
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,829
Thanks to you,
our equipment didn't get wet,

975
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:32,286
and we met our deadline too. Right?

976
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:36,377
Shouldn't you pay me
some of the royalties?

977
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:39,133
I pretty much wrote half of your script.

978
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:42,296
(scoffs)
Sue me. I'd welcome that.

979
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:48,520
A lawsuit like this usually
lasts three years. You know that, right?

980
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:50,388
I'd be happy if I got to see you
for three more years.

981
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:51,307
(snorts)

982
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:52,444
(scoffs)

983
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:56,607
But I didn't add that scene.

984
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:03,316
When we first met.

985
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:13,632
(light music)

986
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:43,237
(rain pattering)

987
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:53,293
(light music continues)

988
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:16,600
I still remember that day so vividly.

989
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:21,824
So I wanted to ask you even more.

990
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:23,569
Why

991
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:26,413
did we break up?

992
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:32,081
YESOOL: <i>How could I have told you?</i>

993
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:34,963
<i>That our future together</i>

994
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:37,293
<i>would always be miserable.</i>

995
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:42,513
(light music)

996
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:07,027
(chuckles)

997
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:12,738
(soft chuckle)

998
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:28,934
Why are you doing this?
You have to tell me, so I'd know.

999
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:31,262
You've been acting weird since that day.

1000
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:33,098
And what if I tell you?

1001
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:36,095
If I tell you, what can you do to fix it?

1002
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:37,728
(sighs deeply)

1003
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:40,605
You wouldn't believe me
even if I told you.

1004
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:42,484
Do you think

1005
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:46,777
we'd be different if I told you?

1006
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:50,620
Please stop. Please?

1007
00:56:50,698 --> 00:56:52,828
Get a hold of yourself!

1008
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:57,659
(exhales deeply)

1009
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:00,497
(sighs)

1010
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:04,460
(dramatic music)

1011
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:27,487
(sighs)

1012
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:31,066
Why are you doing this?

1013
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:33,486
You know there's nothing going on
between Eunjung and me.

1014
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:34,905
I just don't like it.

1015
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:36,413
Just don't see her.

1016
00:57:36,494 --> 00:57:39,624
So I'm asking you why you're saying this.
Just tell me!

1017
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:42,919
YESOOL: <i>Because I saw the future.</i>

1018
00:57:44,377 --> 00:57:46,207
<i>You and her.</i>

1019
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:49,255
(dramatic music)

1020
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:03,352
Sure.

1021
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:05,518
Say "daddy," darling. "Daddy."

1022
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:07,277
Mommy.
(laughs)

1023
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:09,028
Oh, boy.

1024
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:11,780
-How adorable.
-Mommy. Daddy.

1025
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:13,163
(laughs)

1026
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:14,989
(hums)

1027
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:26,343
YESOOL:
<i>No matter how many times I checked,</i>

1028
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:29,924
<i>I couldn't change the future.</i>

1029
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:36,637
(dramatic music)

1030
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:52,528
(fire crackles)

1031
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:12,669
That scene.

1032
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:17,301
I shot that after thinking about it a lot
because I didn't understand it.

1033
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:20,431
Why did you...

1034
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,600
kiss me like that?

1035
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:27,230
Every time you wanted
to say something to me,

1036
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:30,611
you kissed me.

1037
00:59:31,317 --> 00:59:33,317
Without any explanation.

1038
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:37,874
That's all I could think about
after we broke up.

1039
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:42,696
"Why didn't I ask her that?

1040
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:45,081
And why...

1041
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:48,879
didn't she say anything to me?"

1042
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:52,881
If I got to see you again,

1043
00:59:55,049 --> 00:59:57,049
if I got such an opportunity,

1044
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:01,676
I wanted to ask you for sure.

1045
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:10,856
Hong Yesool.

1046
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:16,111
By any chance...

1047
01:00:21,909 --> 01:00:24,659
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR

1048
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:34,756
It's cold.

1049
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:37,594
How many minutes to go
for the movie to end? I'm kind of cold.

1050
01:00:38,551 --> 01:00:39,431
(sighs)

1051
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:41,850
I feel like I'm coming down
with something.

1052
01:00:41,929 --> 01:00:43,679
Can we go now?

1053
01:00:45,683 --> 01:00:47,893
Sure. We have plenty of time.

1054
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:09,709
Drop me off over there.

1055
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:12,535
(sighs)
Um-hm.

1056
01:01:15,546 --> 01:01:17,756
(somber music)

1057
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:32,556
Be careful on your way home.

1058
01:01:33,272 --> 01:01:35,532
I'll email you the pictures
of the location I took today.

1059
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:38,402
(scoffs)
Talking about work all the way to the end?

1060
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:41,775
Please don't worry, Ms. Hong Yesool.

1061
01:01:42,156 --> 01:01:43,316
Bye.

1062
01:01:45,576 --> 01:01:48,076
(somber music)

1063
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:15,479
I SHED TEARS EVERY TIME I KISS YOU

1064
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:49,139
(suspenseful music)

1065
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:57,150
What happened?

1066
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:03,819
(door creaks open)

1067

1068
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:21,462
What is all this?

1069
01:03:23,716 --> 01:03:25,126
What's going on?

Oh, no. What is this?

Who...

1076
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:46,320

Who's there?

MINHU: Hong Yesool!

1083
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:22,784
Shit.

1084
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:29,244
Yesool.

1085
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:30,952
Are you okay?
