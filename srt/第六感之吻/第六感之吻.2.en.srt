(shatters)

8
00:00:50,428 --> 00:00:51,638
YESOOL: My sixth sense.

9
00:00:52,968 --> 00:00:55,188
I've never foreseen something like this.

10
00:00:57,518 --> 00:01:00,108
I foresaw a future
that should never happen.

11
00:01:07,158 --> 00:01:09,568
(dramatic music)

12
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:16,828

(gasps)

15
00:02:28,608 --> 00:02:30,908
(breathes roughly)
I can't believe it.

16
00:02:30,988 --> 00:02:34,078
-(moans in pain)
-YESOOL: Well...

17
00:02:34,158 --> 00:02:35,368
(pants)
I...

18
00:02:35,448 --> 00:02:36,368
No, stop.

19
00:02:37,698 --> 00:02:38,868
Don't scream.

20
00:02:40,288 --> 00:02:41,918
What was that? Cha Minhu and I...

21
00:02:41,998 --> 00:02:43,038
That was an accident.

22
00:02:43,498 --> 00:02:44,538
It's all right.

23
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:46,168
It's no big deal.

24
00:02:47,588 --> 00:02:49,298
Pull yourself together
and finish the work.

25
00:02:49,548 --> 00:02:50,878
Wait, Mr. Cha.
(gasps)

00:02:58,058 --> 00:03:01,348
-MINHEE: Ms. Hong! It's raining!
-Explain the situation to our staff.

29
00:03:01,438 --> 00:03:02,648

30
00:03:02,728 --> 00:03:04,938
(rain pattering)

31
00:03:08,028 --> 00:03:10,528
(stuttering)
The bed! The bed is worth 20 million won!

32
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:12,448
-ROMA: It's out there.
-SANGGOO: Let's go get it!

33
00:03:12,528 --> 00:03:14,908
-Dang it!
-Yesool. What happened?

34
00:03:16,408 --> 00:03:17,328
No...

35
00:03:17,788 --> 00:03:18,948
Nothing happened.

36
00:03:20,198 --> 00:03:21,158
Get back to work.

37
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:23,248
Okay.

38
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:27,668
What was that?

39
00:03:29,088 --> 00:03:31,758
What did I just see?

40
00:03:33,428 --> 00:03:35,428
(dramatic music)

41
00:03:39,468 --> 00:03:40,728
(Minhee screams)

00:03:42,688 --> 00:03:44,058
(grunts)

43
00:03:53,698 --> 00:03:55,028
What the hell

44
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:58,078
am I doing

45
00:04:00,328 --> 00:04:02,458
with Cha Minhu in the future?

46
00:04:02,538 --> 00:04:04,168
(inhales)

47
00:04:04,248 --> 00:04:05,458
(sighs)

48
00:04:05,918 --> 00:04:07,628
What do I do now?

49
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:10,588
-Holy smokes. Hey.
-(breathes roughly)

50
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:12,468
It's heavier now that it's wet. Jesus.

51
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:14,798
(pants)

52
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:17,388
-(grunts)
-Oh, dear.

53
00:04:17,468 --> 00:04:18,758
Yesool.

54
00:04:19,888 --> 00:04:21,388
Did something happen?

55
00:04:23,518 --> 00:04:27,478
You know, Mr. Cha and you on the bed.
(giggles)

56
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:29,568
It seemed that something happened
between you two...

57
00:04:29,648 --> 00:04:30,858
Where's Mr. Cha?

58
00:04:31,608 --> 00:04:32,738
(breathes deeply)

59
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:35,908
(pants)

60
00:04:35,988 --> 00:04:38,158
(in a quiet voice)
What happened?

61
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,488
-Ms. Hong!
-(moans softly)

62
00:04:40,578 --> 00:04:42,498
Tell me what happened!

63
00:04:42,578 --> 00:04:44,958
Yes, there is.
There is something between them.

64
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,628
(moans suspiciously)

65
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,458
(indistinct chatter)

66
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,378
Well, Mr. Cha. Well...
(gasps)

67
00:04:54,048 --> 00:04:55,048
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,098
-Huh?
-Huh?

69
00:05:01,138 --> 00:05:02,178
Huh?

70
00:05:03,388 --> 00:05:05,388
(dramatic music)

71
00:05:10,188 --> 00:05:11,938
Why does he not have it?

72
00:05:12,358 --> 00:05:13,528
Huh?

73
00:05:13,898 --> 00:05:16,318
-You know, on your back...
-Hey.

74
00:05:17,318 --> 00:05:18,488
What are you doing now?

75
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:20,738
Wait just a second.

76
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:22,658
I clearly saw it earlier.

77
00:05:23,118 --> 00:05:25,078
-You had a scar on your back...
-Hey.

78
00:05:25,538 --> 00:05:27,918
Why do you keep talking nonsense?

79
00:05:28,788 --> 00:05:30,248
Hong Yesool. Get out.

80
00:05:31,838 --> 00:05:32,878
Why is it not there?

81
00:05:33,128 --> 00:05:35,718
Huh? What are you talking about?

82
00:05:35,798 --> 00:05:37,798
Hong Yesool. I said, get out.

83
00:05:38,548 --> 00:05:39,838
Get out!

84
00:05:39,928 --> 00:05:41,928
(quirky music)

85
00:05:52,768 --> 00:05:54,228
(sighs)

86
00:05:54,318 --> 00:05:55,608
(door closes)

87
00:05:57,278 --> 00:05:58,858
Was I mistaken?

88
00:05:58,948 --> 00:06:01,158
Well, it was clearly there.

89
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,118
Me and Cha Minhu?

90
00:06:08,748 --> 00:06:09,918
That can't be.

91
00:06:11,378 --> 00:06:13,498
SANGGOO:
Hey, guys! Be careful when you lift it!

92
00:06:13,588 --> 00:06:17,168
Okay, okay! Now let's go!
You can do it! All right, do your best!

93
00:06:17,258 --> 00:06:18,338
Yes.

94
00:06:18,418 --> 00:06:19,798
-(man grunts)
-SANGGOO: Lift it. Be careful.

95
00:06:19,878 --> 00:06:20,928
MAN: Oh, boy.

96
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,548
(Kyungseok clears throat)

97
00:06:26,268 --> 00:06:27,268
(blows)

98
00:06:27,978 --> 00:06:29,098
(sniffles)

99
00:06:29,978 --> 00:06:31,768
Hey, Mr. Cha.

100
00:06:31,848 --> 00:06:33,188
(sighs)

101
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:34,898
This is just part of our job.

102
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:37,988
You know, a series of coincidences
and baffling situations.

103
00:06:38,108 --> 00:06:40,238
The rainy weather is, well,

104
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:42,068
beyond our control.

105
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:43,618
Come on.

106
00:06:43,698 --> 00:06:45,658
Let's make it work though.

107
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,538
-We can do it!
-(moans in pain)

108
00:06:47,618 --> 00:06:48,788
We...

109
00:06:50,328 --> 00:06:51,998
That's why we have a manual.

110
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,208
We were supposed to set it up
this morning.

111
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,628
Excuse me, guys.
Please be careful with that.

112
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,468
-Carefully. Please.
-MAN: Okay.

113
00:06:59,548 --> 00:07:01,218
At worst, we can just use indoor shots.

114
00:07:01,298 --> 00:07:03,928
We both are quite experienced
in this kind of thing.

115
00:07:04,008 --> 00:07:05,468
We experienced much worse...

116
00:07:06,098 --> 00:07:07,268
(clears throat)

117
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:17,018
(sucks air)
Good morning, sir.

118
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,818
Let's...
(sighs)

119
00:07:21,398 --> 00:07:22,988
Mr. Cha. Mr...

120
00:07:23,948 --> 00:07:25,948
Jesus, that rude brat.

121
00:07:26,868 --> 00:07:29,158
The damn rain, for God's sake.

122
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:32,868
-AD. Are you ready?
-Yes?

123
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,998
-Oh, yes. We're good to go.
-All right. Let's begin.

124
00:07:35,078 --> 00:07:36,088
Okay.

125
00:07:36,168 --> 00:07:40,088
All right. One, two. Action!

126
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,008
Wake up.

127
00:07:46,598 --> 00:07:48,178
Get up.

128
00:07:50,518 --> 00:07:52,768
Stretch yourself once. Very good.

129
00:07:53,268 --> 00:07:54,768
Pan the camera.

130
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,698
KYUNGSEOK:
Step aside. Don't get in my way.

131
00:08:04,028 --> 00:08:06,068
The main color of our new bed
is mahogany brown.

132
00:08:06,158 --> 00:08:07,328
But you're taking that out?

133
00:08:07,408 --> 00:08:10,748
It hasn't been released yet,
so it'll be difficult to get it today.

134
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:13,618
-But we'll schedule an additional shoot...
-KYUNGSEOK: Come on.

135
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:15,628
CGI is so advanced these days.

136
00:08:16,168 --> 00:08:17,248
Mahogany brown?

137
00:08:17,338 --> 00:08:18,788
We can make it look the same...

138
00:08:18,878 --> 00:08:20,708
Then why do we even bother
doing the shoot?

139
00:08:20,798 --> 00:08:22,468
Just take the bed out
and use CGI to add it!

140
00:08:24,088 --> 00:08:26,048
Do you want me to get fired or what?

141
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:27,258
(stuttering)
No.

142
00:08:27,348 --> 00:08:29,638
It's not that. I was just...

143
00:08:31,968 --> 00:08:32,928
Hey.

144
00:08:33,348 --> 00:08:36,148
(whispers)
Hey. You're the PM. Do something about it.

145
00:08:37,608 --> 00:08:40,268
Let's take it out. Let's take out the bed.

146
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,358
Well, if we remove the bed...

147
00:08:44,648 --> 00:08:46,698
(light music)

148
00:08:48,068 --> 00:08:51,038
I like this one better than that one.
What do you think? I like it.

149
00:08:51,118 --> 00:08:53,498
-YESOOL: It should be fine, right?
-EOMJI: Good. Let's go for this.

150
00:08:53,578 --> 00:08:54,708
Let's go.

151
00:08:54,788 --> 00:08:56,998
(light music continues)

152
00:09:02,298 --> 00:09:03,758
I'm not sure about this.

153
00:09:03,838 --> 00:09:05,838
I'm not sure if our director

154
00:09:05,928 --> 00:09:07,798
will like a bed commercial without a bed.

155
00:09:08,178 --> 00:09:10,298
The director asked for a commercial

156
00:09:10,388 --> 00:09:12,638
that makes people curious about the brand.

157
00:09:12,888 --> 00:09:15,018
I believe our new plan meets the need.

158
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,768
And it'll definitely be effective.

159
00:09:17,478 --> 00:09:19,478
We'll make people imagine
the product in the space

160
00:09:19,608 --> 00:09:20,898
where the product is missing.

161
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:24,358
We'll add the sound of rain
and sounds of nature

162
00:09:24,568 --> 00:09:26,108
to make it look like a bed is there...

163
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:28,738
Then you should've proposed it
in the first place!

164
00:09:29,908 --> 00:09:31,738
You know the commercial
for Jet Washing Machine

165
00:09:31,828 --> 00:09:33,538
that recently got 10 million views, right?

166
00:09:33,868 --> 00:09:36,578
Its concept was changed on the set,
but it made a big hit.

167
00:09:36,658 --> 00:09:39,958
Sometimes, a situation like this
brings about a better result.

168
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:50,718
(sighs)

169
00:09:52,048 --> 00:09:54,058
(light music)

170
00:10:06,938 --> 00:10:09,068
(sighing)
Jeez.

171
00:10:09,158 --> 00:10:10,908
ROMA (on camera):
Oh, Sanggoo. Where are you going?

172
00:10:10,988 --> 00:10:11,868
Me?

173
00:10:11,948 --> 00:10:13,988
I'm on my way to get some props.
Good luck.

174
00:10:14,118 --> 00:10:15,788
Hey, Minhee. Let's go together, huh?

175
00:10:15,868 --> 00:10:17,908
Okay, come. I need to get some props too.

176
00:10:21,498 --> 00:10:22,788
KYUNGSEOK: Man, it's killing me.

177
00:10:22,878 --> 00:10:25,668
Mr. Yeom. We couldn't prepare coffee,
so have some juice instead.

178
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:27,968
Come on. If you don't have coffee,
you should go get some.

179
00:10:28,048 --> 00:10:30,548
-Well, but...
-Think, for God's sake!

180
00:10:30,628 --> 00:10:32,888
-Well, but...
-No, you drink it. You...

181
00:10:32,968 --> 00:10:36,138
Why didn't the production team
put this thing away?

182
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,348
EOMJI (sighing): Goodness.

183
00:10:38,098 --> 00:10:39,388
I'm sorry.

184
00:10:39,518 --> 00:10:41,768
I told you to stop filming, you punk!

185
00:10:42,148 --> 00:10:43,938
-EOMJI: Oh, dear.
-(sighs)

186
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:46,688
-Cut!
-Holy shit.

187
00:10:47,738 --> 00:10:49,698
(chuckles awkwardly)
We'll take a 10-minute break.

188
00:10:50,738 --> 00:10:52,568
-We'll take a 10-minute break!
-MINHEE: Okay.

189
00:10:52,658 --> 00:10:53,948
SANGGOO: A 10-minute break.

190
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,658
(indistinct chatter)

191
00:11:10,968 --> 00:11:11,838
Good work.

192
00:11:11,928 --> 00:11:13,508
-EOMJI: Yeah, good work.
-MINHEE: Good work. Good work.

193
00:11:13,588 --> 00:11:15,808
EOMJI: Director.
Thank you for your hard work.

194
00:11:15,888 --> 00:11:17,388
-Thank you for your hard work. Bye.
-MANAGER: Let's go. Be careful, Jiyoung.

195
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:18,558
Oh, sir. Are you leaving?

196
00:11:19,138 --> 00:11:20,598
(clears throat)

197
00:11:22,978 --> 00:11:25,188
(groans with fatigue)

198
00:11:26,768 --> 00:11:29,358
We managed to finish it somehow.

199
00:11:31,898 --> 00:11:33,908
Seriously, I feel like
my lifespan shortens

200
00:11:33,988 --> 00:11:36,448
every time we do a shoot.

201
00:11:38,368 --> 00:11:39,538
(sucks air)

202
00:11:41,328 --> 00:11:43,038
You're acting strangely today.

203
00:11:45,328 --> 00:11:46,458
(sucks air)
No wonder.

204
00:11:46,538 --> 00:11:48,798
It's your first time working as a PM.
I'm sure it's tough.

205
00:11:50,508 --> 00:11:52,258
By the way, where's Master Cha?

206
00:11:52,968 --> 00:11:55,218
He usually stays on set
until the end and nags you.

207
00:11:56,598 --> 00:11:57,718
I know.

208
00:11:58,258 --> 00:12:00,808
He didn't seem to be feeling well.

209
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:02,348
"Feeling well."

210
00:12:04,188 --> 00:12:05,598
-KYUNGSEOK: Hey, Jang Eomji!
-(gasps)

211
00:12:05,688 --> 00:12:07,058
Yes, I'm coming!
(stuttering)

212
00:12:07,148 --> 00:12:08,188
Come quickly!

213
00:12:08,268 --> 00:12:09,778
I'd better perform an exorcism
or something so I won't work

214
00:12:09,858 --> 00:12:11,238
on the same team with that asshole.
I've got to go.

215
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:12,818
(sighs)

216
00:12:16,658 --> 00:12:17,618
Yesool.

217
00:12:18,408 --> 00:12:22,658
Did something happen between you
and Mr. Cha on the bed this morning?

218
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:24,668
No.

219
00:12:24,998 --> 00:12:26,828
(soft chuckle)
Go pack up.

220
00:12:26,918 --> 00:12:28,288
What could possibly have happened?

221
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:34,468
I'm sure something happened.
(giggles)

222
00:12:34,548 --> 00:12:36,298
(Minhu breathes deeply)

223
00:12:40,008 --> 00:12:42,428
(pants)

224
00:12:43,098 --> 00:12:44,388
(groans)

225
00:12:45,018 --> 00:12:47,648
(panting)

226
00:12:51,478 --> 00:12:53,738
(light music)

227
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:10,878
-What? You slept with Cha Minhu?
-Hey, hey, hey, hey.

228
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,918
Keep it down.
I didn't say I slept with him.

229
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:15,968
It's the same thing.
That means it's going to happen soon.

230
00:13:16,048 --> 00:13:18,888
Stop talking crazy.
I'm already confused enough.

231
00:13:19,888 --> 00:13:21,008
(sighs)

232
00:13:22,508 --> 00:13:25,558
But the thing is, it wasn't there.

233
00:13:25,808 --> 00:13:26,808
What?

234
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:28,848
The scar.

235
00:13:28,938 --> 00:13:29,768
The scar?

236
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:34,738
(sighs)

237
00:13:34,818 --> 00:13:36,238
(tuts)
Yesool.

238
00:13:36,698 --> 00:13:38,568
Did you even sleep 10 hours this week?

239
00:13:38,988 --> 00:13:40,488
I had no time to sleep.

240
00:13:40,568 --> 00:13:42,528
I had to work on the campaigns
and fix the mishaps.

241
00:13:42,618 --> 00:13:44,238
Exactly.

242
00:13:44,328 --> 00:13:46,328
I guess you just imagined it
due to lack of sleep.

243
00:13:46,578 --> 00:13:48,958
You see Cha Minhu regularly
in your dreams.

244
00:13:49,038 --> 00:13:51,168
Saying your proposal is crap
and you need to write it again,

245
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:53,088
making all that fuss, he runs
after you all night long, you said.

246
00:13:53,668 --> 00:13:55,048
(smacking lips)
It was just your imagination.

247
00:13:55,128 --> 00:13:56,878
-(slurps)
-You think so?

248
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:00,258
You and Cha Minhu are sleeping together?
Does that make sense?

249
00:14:00,338 --> 00:14:01,888
Of course not.

250
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,138
The more I think about it,
the angrier I get.

251
00:14:08,768 --> 00:14:11,308
-Why?
-I'm not some kind of insect.

252
00:14:11,398 --> 00:14:12,898
It was just an accident.

253
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:15,278
But he treated me
like some vermin afterward.

254
00:14:15,358 --> 00:14:16,278
See?

255
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:18,358
You and that punk?

256
00:14:19,028 --> 00:14:20,568
Not a chance.

257
00:14:20,988 --> 00:14:21,948
No, no.

258
00:14:23,328 --> 00:14:24,368
-(sighs)
-Oh.

259
00:14:25,158 --> 00:14:26,288
I'll go get more beer.

260
00:14:26,368 --> 00:14:27,448
(sniffles)

261
00:14:30,868 --> 00:14:31,958
(door opens)

262
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,038
(sighs)

263
00:14:34,918 --> 00:14:36,758
But it's hard to say
it was an imaginary thing.

264
00:14:38,048 --> 00:14:39,718
(moans in terror)

265
00:14:40,628 --> 00:14:42,258
(sighing)
It was a delusion.

266
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:44,848
Go away, ghosts.
(groaning)

267
00:14:46,308 --> 00:14:47,928
(moans in frustration)

268
00:14:52,438 --> 00:14:54,188
(engine roars)

269
00:15:01,698 --> 00:15:02,908
(car horn honking)

270
00:15:11,668 --> 00:15:13,208
(breathes roughly)

271
00:15:28,808 --> 00:15:31,558
SEOUL, OFFICE OF HAN RIVER

272
00:15:36,688 --> 00:15:39,108
(motorcycle engine roars)

273
00:15:40,318 --> 00:15:41,448
OBEY TRAFFIC SIGNALS

274
00:15:41,528 --> 00:15:43,738
(engine roaring)

275
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:50,038
(smacking lips)
Hello.

276
00:15:50,498 --> 00:15:51,958
A motorcycle gang is riding on the road

277
00:15:52,038 --> 00:15:53,828
between Gangbyeon Expressway
and Seoul Forest.

278
00:15:53,918 --> 00:15:56,128
Please do something about them.

279
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,458
Seoul Gangnam Gyeo 2037.

280
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:02,218
Seoul Seongdong Hyo 5448.

281
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:05,588
Seoul Seongdong Ryeo 4170.

282
00:16:06,348 --> 00:16:09,968
They've been riding around this area
for 30 minutes already.

283
00:16:14,438 --> 00:16:15,808
(elevator dings)

284
00:16:17,188 --> 00:16:18,438
Hi, Dad.

285
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:20,978
I'm almost at Minhu's apartment.

286
00:16:21,778 --> 00:16:23,818
Well, Seungtaek said he's fine.

287
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,408
But I should see for myself.

288
00:16:28,368 --> 00:16:31,748
Come on, Dad. What's the big deal
about having a meal together this weekend?

289
00:16:31,828 --> 00:16:33,828
He's sick. He needs to rest.

290
00:16:33,908 --> 00:16:36,628
Seriously, people would think
he’s your biological son.

291
00:16:37,078 --> 00:16:38,088
Uh-huh.

292
00:16:39,588 --> 00:16:40,628
-(sighs)
-(cell phone beeps)

293
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:43,468
(inhales deeply)

294
00:16:47,088 --> 00:16:48,048
(gasps)

295
00:16:48,718 --> 00:16:50,008
How do you know my lock code?

296
00:16:50,098 --> 00:16:52,138
What happened? Who is it this time?

297
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,058
-Right?
-(sighs)

298
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,638
That's why you're sick, right?

299
00:16:55,728 --> 00:16:58,148
So who on earth is it this time?

300
00:16:58,768 --> 00:16:59,978
Ah!

301
00:17:00,068 --> 00:17:01,648
Hey, leave before I get mad.

302
00:17:01,728 --> 00:17:02,898
You think I don't know?

303
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:05,898
You got sick like this before
when we kissed.

304
00:17:05,988 --> 00:17:08,408
That wasn't a kiss.
Your lips just bumped against mine.

305
00:17:08,488 --> 00:17:09,828
It's the same thing.

306
00:17:09,908 --> 00:17:12,078
So whose lips bumped
against yours this time?

307
00:17:12,158 --> 00:17:15,748
What if the paparazzi take photos
of you coming here without your manager?

308
00:17:15,828 --> 00:17:18,208
I would love to
get photographed by the paparazzi.

309
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:21,298
And I... also want to kiss you.

310
00:17:21,378 --> 00:17:22,458
(scoffs)

311
00:17:22,548 --> 00:17:23,918
Okay.
(laughs awkwardly)

312
00:17:24,008 --> 00:17:26,468
All right.
Then shall we go out for a walk first?

313
00:17:26,928 --> 00:17:28,588
Okay.
(laughs)

314
00:17:28,718 --> 00:17:30,508
You said you were sick,

315
00:17:30,598 --> 00:17:32,388
so I spent quite some time
to make this for you.

316
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:35,388
Small octopus and abalone porridge,
your favorite.

317
00:17:35,478 --> 00:17:36,978
Oh, you got it from Green Hotel.

318
00:17:37,058 --> 00:17:38,848
And you ate it already. Mm.

319
00:17:38,938 --> 00:17:41,018
(sighs)
Who am I trying to fool?

320
00:17:43,148 --> 00:17:45,738
I'm free tomorrow. Should I look
after you all through the night?

321
00:17:45,818 --> 00:17:47,908
On the bed. Huh? Huh?

322
00:17:48,488 --> 00:17:49,618
(gasps)

323
00:17:50,118 --> 00:17:51,528
-Jiyoung.
-Yes?

324
00:17:51,618 --> 00:17:52,658
Bye.

325
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:57,788
Minhu. Minhu! Minhu!

326
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:00,458
(quirky music)

327
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:16,848
LUAPEN

328
00:18:16,928 --> 00:18:18,138
(sighs)

329
00:18:18,688 --> 00:18:19,978
(groans)

330
00:18:27,028 --> 00:18:28,238
(bottle clanks)

331
00:18:36,368 --> 00:18:39,578
-You know, on your back...
-What are you doing now?

332
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,208
You had a scar on your back...

333
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:43,788
Hey. Why do you keep talking nonsense?

334
00:18:44,088 --> 00:18:44,918
(sighs)

335
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:48,468
Cha Minhu must've thought
I'm a total weirdo.

336
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,428
Get your head on straight, Hong Yesool.

337
00:18:54,808 --> 00:18:58,428
Don't say anything stupid
when you see Cha Minhu tomorrow.

338
00:18:58,768 --> 00:19:02,058
Do your job with perfection
as if nothing has happened.

339
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:04,188
Yes.

340
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:06,528
(blows)

341
00:19:09,188 --> 00:19:10,358
(sighs)

342
00:19:17,998 --> 00:19:20,248
(gasps)
Yesool.

343
00:19:21,078 --> 00:19:22,368
I can't get a hold of Mr. Cha.

344
00:19:22,668 --> 00:19:25,998
-What? Well, why?
-(moans uncertainly)

345
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:29,588
The meeting starts soon.

346
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,378
Sick leave, monthly holidays,
and vacations...

347
00:19:31,468 --> 00:19:33,298
He never took any of them
and made us feel uncomfortable.

348
00:19:33,388 --> 00:19:35,098
-And he hasn't come in yet?
-MINHEE: No.

349
00:19:35,178 --> 00:19:37,098
Ms. Hong. Do you know anything?

350
00:19:37,508 --> 00:19:38,558
It's strange.

351
00:19:38,638 --> 00:19:40,728
Well, I don't know either.

352
00:19:42,138 --> 00:19:44,728
SUNHEE: If you don't know Cha Minhu's
whereabouts, then who does?

353
00:19:45,358 --> 00:19:47,898
You're obviously his work spouse.

354
00:19:48,108 --> 00:19:50,278
Goodness. I'm not his work spouse.

355
00:19:51,778 --> 00:19:54,988
You're the only person in this company
he cares about.

356
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,488
Everyone here knows that.

357
00:19:56,578 --> 00:19:59,118
Not me. I don't.

358
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:04,168
What makes you think he cares about her?
He always nags and picks on her.

359
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:05,998
(scoffs)

360
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:10,298
Teams two and three are not
in good moods. Read the room, will you?

361
00:20:10,378 --> 00:20:13,088
Ms. Jo Sunhee. I heard that
your team lost all your battles.

362
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:14,628
But we renewed all our contracts.

363
00:20:14,718 --> 00:20:17,848
(both laugh mockingly)

364
00:20:18,098 --> 00:20:19,058
(snorts)

365
00:20:20,098 --> 00:20:21,018
(soft chuckle)

366
00:20:21,098 --> 00:20:23,478
Ms. Hong. Let's go to the meeting.

367
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:25,018
Okay.

368
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,228
Let's go for now.

369
00:20:28,068 --> 00:20:30,688
-Huh? Oh, okay.
-MINHEE: I'll keep calling him.

370
00:20:34,198 --> 00:20:36,198
(light music)

371
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:44,658
(inhales)

372
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,128
You know.

373
00:20:52,588 --> 00:20:54,718
A bed commercial that doesn't show a bed?

374
00:20:55,428 --> 00:20:57,258
The idea is brilliant and good.

375
00:20:58,638 --> 00:21:01,468
(sucks air)
But a commercial without a product?

376
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:04,388
Well, I'm not sure about that.

377
00:21:04,478 --> 00:21:06,018
It worries me.

378
00:21:06,188 --> 00:21:09,518
You know the damage to our premium bed
comes to 20 million won, right?

379
00:21:09,608 --> 00:21:11,818
It's not even in the commercial.

380
00:21:11,898 --> 00:21:12,978
Well...
(chuckles awkwardly)

381
00:21:13,068 --> 00:21:15,648
Yes. The thing is...

382
00:21:17,408 --> 00:21:20,448
It's Ms. Hong's first time as a PM.

383
00:21:20,778 --> 00:21:23,698
She doesn't have much experience,
so she made many mistakes.

384
00:21:23,788 --> 00:21:25,958
I sincerely apologize on her behalf.

385
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:28,038
She should've checked

386
00:21:28,128 --> 00:21:30,748
the weather report
or if we had an extra bed.

387
00:21:31,588 --> 00:21:34,918
We'll spend more time
on the post-synchronization...

388
00:21:35,008 --> 00:21:35,838
Come on.

389
00:21:35,918 --> 00:21:38,508
We're not here to talk about
the post-production process.

390
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,258
Is there any other way to fix this?

391
00:21:41,678 --> 00:21:43,968
Where is Mr. Cha?

392
00:21:44,718 --> 00:21:46,728
KYUNGSEOK: Mr. Cha?

393
00:21:50,358 --> 00:21:51,518
KYUNGSEOK: Oh, he's here.

394
00:21:51,608 --> 00:21:53,358
I'm sorry I'm late.

395
00:21:58,198 --> 00:21:59,818
(whispers)
I think we're out of luck.

396
00:21:59,908 --> 00:22:03,328
Last year, they demanded a reshoot,
saying the blanket had a crease.

397
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:05,618
And they combined it with the first one.

398
00:22:05,698 --> 00:22:08,498
(chuckles)
They're being nasty again.

399
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:09,828
I'll begin.

400
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:13,248
These are the strategies that we propose.

401
00:22:14,628 --> 00:22:16,838
One of them is to create momentum
that can imprint

402
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:19,428
the brand "Billy" on people's minds
without showing its products.

403
00:22:19,968 --> 00:22:22,008
(sucks air)
What does that mean?

404
00:22:23,598 --> 00:22:25,678
By not exposing
the brand name and the bed,

405
00:22:25,768 --> 00:22:27,978
we'll make people try an online search
for "Billy" themselves.

406
00:22:28,058 --> 00:22:29,558
(inhales deeply)

407
00:22:29,638 --> 00:22:31,518
-After that, we'll open a pop-up store...
-(sighs)

408
00:22:31,608 --> 00:22:35,438
...to let customers experience the brand
both on and offline.

409
00:22:35,818 --> 00:22:38,448
That way, they can team up
with the brand as voluntary marketers.

410
00:22:38,528 --> 00:22:40,608
And that's the objective of this campaign.

411
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:44,368
(sucks air)
But I think it's too risky

412
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:47,038
not to show the product at all.

413
00:22:47,998 --> 00:22:48,998
Hmm.

414
00:22:49,788 --> 00:22:51,038
POP-UP STORE...

415
00:22:51,118 --> 00:22:54,088
"Nothing happens without taking risks."

416
00:22:54,168 --> 00:22:55,998
This is what the president
of Billy said in his interview.

417
00:22:56,088 --> 00:22:57,338
And thanks to the risks he took,

418
00:22:57,418 --> 00:22:59,718
Billy has become the biggest
bed company in this country.

419
00:22:59,928 --> 00:23:02,928
Strategies that entail great risks
often make changes

420
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:04,928
because they have great potential.

421
00:23:22,198 --> 00:23:24,198
(soft music)

422
00:23:27,078 --> 00:23:28,408
KYUNGSEOK: Take care, sir.

423
00:23:31,788 --> 00:23:32,958
(sighs)
For God's sake.

424
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:34,378
(Eomji laughs)

425
00:23:36,038 --> 00:23:37,378
(Kyungseok sighs)
This is killing me.

426
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:39,548
-(Minhee laughs)
-EOMJI: Good job. Good job, everyone.

427
00:23:39,628 --> 00:23:41,508
MINHEE: Oh, dear.
(sighs)

428
00:23:42,548 --> 00:23:45,718
You need to work
on the Morphis campaign too.

429
00:23:45,798 --> 00:23:47,758
Can you handle the pop-up store?

430
00:23:48,518 --> 00:23:51,688
The schedule
has been very tight for months.

431
00:23:52,308 --> 00:23:53,518
We can handle it.

432
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,398
The Morphis Automobile project is the one

433
00:23:56,478 --> 00:23:59,278
that our vice-president cares
a lot about. You know that, right?

434
00:23:59,988 --> 00:24:01,238
And regarding Hong Yesool...

435
00:24:01,988 --> 00:24:04,028
It's too early for her to be a PM.

436
00:24:04,108 --> 00:24:05,158
Exclude her.

437
00:24:05,658 --> 00:24:08,328
Taking charge of the pop-up store
would be too much for her.

438
00:24:08,408 --> 00:24:09,658
I'll assist her.

439
00:24:12,038 --> 00:24:15,418
Handling the project from beginning to end
will help her get a grasp of the work.

440
00:24:16,838 --> 00:24:17,958
I'll take my leave now.

441
00:24:20,168 --> 00:24:21,508
(sighs)

442
00:24:23,678 --> 00:24:24,588
(door closes)

443
00:24:25,388 --> 00:24:26,428
Mr. Yeom.

444
00:24:27,218 --> 00:24:30,098
It's true that I'm not
experienced enough to work as a PM.

445
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:32,728
But I asked you several times
to follow the manual

446
00:24:32,808 --> 00:24:35,598
because we didn't have a spare bed.
And I had a hard time reaching you.

447
00:24:35,688 --> 00:24:38,188
You must know that's the reason
the problem couldn't be handled properly.

448
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:40,728
You know how many missed calls
you got from me, right?

449
00:24:40,978 --> 00:24:42,688
-By any chance...
-Hey!

450
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:46,568
Are you kidding me?
The plan was flawed from the start.

451
00:24:46,658 --> 00:24:49,238
You can't put the blame
on the production team!

452
00:24:49,698 --> 00:24:52,828
To save the budget, you rented the place
for a short period of time.

453
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,288
What an amazing job you did!

454
00:24:55,418 --> 00:24:56,828
Your team is the one to blame.

455
00:24:57,038 --> 00:24:59,588
And what's the duty of a PM?

456
00:24:59,668 --> 00:25:03,128
You should've followed me around
to have it all under control!

457
00:25:03,258 --> 00:25:04,758
(sighs)
But...

458
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:05,758
What?

459
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:08,258
If you have anything to say,
then say it. Go on!

460
00:25:08,718 --> 00:25:10,388
What's with the look on your face? You...

461
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:20,018
Get back to work.

462
00:25:26,908 --> 00:25:28,318
(sighs)

463
00:25:42,128 --> 00:25:45,418
Is this the way the planning team
deals with things?

464
00:25:46,258 --> 00:25:47,428
Come on.

465
00:25:47,508 --> 00:25:49,888
I've been working in this field
as a CD for 15 years.

466
00:25:49,968 --> 00:25:52,428
Why should I be treated like this?
Think about it, Mr. Cha.

467
00:25:53,808 --> 00:25:55,728
KYUNGSEOK: I don't think you trained
your staff properly.

468
00:25:55,808 --> 00:25:58,138
-Did you see how rude she was to me?
-(sighs)

469
00:25:58,228 --> 00:26:00,268
How long do I have to put up with this?

470
00:26:01,898 --> 00:26:04,148
Now what? What is it this time?

471
00:26:04,478 --> 00:26:07,608
We just do what the planning team
tells us to do. Don't you know that?

472
00:26:07,948 --> 00:26:10,028
Both the directing
and production teams become

473
00:26:10,118 --> 00:26:12,778
nothing more than puppets
when we work with your team.

474
00:26:12,868 --> 00:26:15,158
And we set up the bed

475
00:26:15,328 --> 00:26:17,748
with the permission of Hong Yesool.

476
00:26:18,998 --> 00:26:21,838
You had the first party
at Sohyang Club in Hannam-dong.

477
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:23,168
Huh?

478
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:24,998
Sohyang...

479
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,878
Jeez, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

480
00:26:29,378 --> 00:26:30,888
(shouts in surprise)

481
00:26:31,468 --> 00:26:33,218
-(groans)
-Jeez, there was a fly.

482
00:26:33,298 --> 00:26:34,218
(stuttering)
A fly?

483
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,928
And you had the second party at Sky Bar.

484
00:26:37,018 --> 00:26:38,388
As you were busy hanging out

485
00:26:38,478 --> 00:26:40,018
with Mr. Kim and Mr. Lee
from KS Production

486
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,608
and many girls from the bar,

487
00:26:42,688 --> 00:26:44,768
you didn't answer
dozens of calls from Ms. Hong.

488
00:26:44,858 --> 00:26:46,818
That's why you arrived
at the set the next morning, right?

489
00:26:46,898 --> 00:26:50,318
(snores)
How did you know that?

490
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:52,368
You ruined the work
because you were busy partying.

491
00:26:52,448 --> 00:26:54,118
But you put the blame on Ms. Hong.

492
00:26:54,198 --> 00:26:56,538
Is that your know-how as a CD
with 15 years' experience?

493
00:26:56,618 --> 00:26:57,908
This isn't the first time.

494
00:26:57,998 --> 00:26:59,828
Last time, you flaked on a shoot

495
00:26:59,908 --> 00:27:02,288
because you were busy being wined
and dined by a model agency.

496
00:27:02,378 --> 00:27:04,498
So far, I'm the only person
who knows that.

497
00:27:04,588 --> 00:27:05,918
(gulps)

498
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:07,168
(gasps)

499
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:09,168
(stuttering)
What are you doing?

500
00:27:09,258 --> 00:27:11,178
(stuttering)
Are you threatening me or something?

501
00:27:11,258 --> 00:27:14,598
Why are you bringing that up
in a situation like this?

502
00:27:14,678 --> 00:27:17,678
-Should I continue?
-No.

503
00:27:17,768 --> 00:27:18,928
I mean...

504
00:27:19,598 --> 00:27:21,308
That's not what I meant.
(snorts)

505
00:27:22,268 --> 00:27:23,808
Oh, man.

506
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:26,778
Okay, okay, okay.

507
00:27:26,858 --> 00:27:28,108
(sucks air)

508
00:27:28,608 --> 00:27:30,318
Listen to me, Mr. Cha.

509
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:33,028
First of all, we're on the same team.

510
00:27:33,238 --> 00:27:35,828
We should work together to make
the pop-up store a success, right?

511
00:27:35,908 --> 00:27:37,198
(laughs)

512
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:38,238
(moans in pain)

513
00:27:39,498 --> 00:27:42,328
Jeez, why are there so many flies here?

514
00:27:42,418 --> 00:27:44,168
(smacking lips)
Ouch.

515
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:48,838
He's so rude and obnoxious.

516
00:27:50,838 --> 00:27:51,838
(sighs)

517
00:28:02,518 --> 00:28:03,808
(exhales deeply)

518
00:28:07,568 --> 00:28:08,568
(sighs)

519
00:28:12,528 --> 00:28:14,568
I don't want you to apologize.

520
00:28:16,368 --> 00:28:18,118
Just don't do anything
you'll be sorry for.

521
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:19,448
That's all I ask of you.

522
00:28:20,368 --> 00:28:22,908
You're the PM of this campaign, all right?

523
00:28:22,998 --> 00:28:26,078
If you're going to get intimidated
by your higher-ups, just quit.

524
00:28:27,378 --> 00:28:28,378
Jeez.

525
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,168
What? Do you have something to say?

526
00:28:33,008 --> 00:28:37,048
The bed commercial without a bed.
How long did you work on that?

527
00:28:37,138 --> 00:28:39,928
I saw the proposal on your desk
the other day.

528
00:28:40,308 --> 00:28:42,428
Why didn't you say anything about it?

529
00:28:42,518 --> 00:28:43,978
You asked me to have faith in you.

530
00:28:44,478 --> 00:28:46,308
You said you wanted
to take full responsibility

531
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:49,108
for the project as a PM. That's why.
All I did was have faith in you.

532
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:53,988
(sighs)

533
00:28:54,068 --> 00:28:55,658
All right. I'll be honest with you.

534
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:59,238
I expected that you'd make mistakes.

535
00:29:00,408 --> 00:29:03,038
But since I let you take charge
of the project,

536
00:29:03,118 --> 00:29:05,958
I thought I should let you experience
going through the whole process too.

537
00:29:06,368 --> 00:29:08,208
And I still have

538
00:29:08,958 --> 00:29:10,208
faith in you.

539
00:29:14,548 --> 00:29:15,798
Thank you.

540
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:19,428
No need to say that either.

541
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:22,058
Don't rely on me to the point
where'd you would feel grateful.

542
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:27,648
Do you have time on your hands?

543
00:29:27,728 --> 00:29:29,018
Get back to work.

544
00:29:33,648 --> 00:29:36,278
(light music)

545
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:47,038
(door opens)

546
00:29:48,168 --> 00:29:49,328
(door closes)

547
00:29:49,958 --> 00:29:51,248
(scoffs)

548
00:29:59,258 --> 00:30:00,348
Roma.

549
00:30:01,048 --> 00:30:03,098
Let's go drink some coffee.
Who wants to drink coffee?

550
00:30:03,178 --> 00:30:04,598
-EOMJI: Me.
-No one else? Okay.

551
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:06,768
-EOMJI: What? Me.
-ROMA: We'll be back.

552
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:09,058
Ro... What the hell?
(tuts)

553
00:30:11,058 --> 00:30:12,898
(sighs)

554
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:14,318
(hums)

555
00:30:17,948 --> 00:30:19,408
PEOPLE WHO WRITE A NEW HISTORY
OF ADVERTISEMENT ZEU AD

556
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:23,028
-Why aren't you searching for references?
-(grunts)

557
00:30:27,368 --> 00:30:28,248
Ms. Hong.

558
00:30:30,828 --> 00:30:31,788
Ms. Hong.

559
00:30:32,838 --> 00:30:35,298
I emailed them to you 30 minutes ago.

560
00:30:35,378 --> 00:30:36,628
(sighs)

561
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,888
And what's more important
than this pop-up store is

562
00:30:42,968 --> 00:30:48,428
finding the other half of my life
at the...

563
00:30:48,518 --> 00:30:50,808
(whispers)
...at the 30-year anniversary banquet.

564
00:30:50,898 --> 00:30:51,978
(sighs)

565
00:30:54,068 --> 00:30:56,188
Make some time when the event is over.

566
00:30:56,278 --> 00:30:59,028
We should get dressed up this time.

567
00:31:01,358 --> 00:31:02,528
(smacks lips)

568
00:31:03,198 --> 00:31:05,578
(sobbingly)
My boyfriend seems to be missing.

569
00:31:06,078 --> 00:31:06,948
Huh?

570
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:09,078
What are you saying?

571
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:10,668
(inhales)

572
00:31:10,748 --> 00:31:12,878
(sighs)
I said I'd work overtime for two weeks.

573
00:31:13,248 --> 00:31:14,918
And I haven't heard from him
for three days.

574
00:31:15,918 --> 00:31:18,548
(chuckles awkwardly)
Should I call the police?

575
00:31:18,628 --> 00:31:22,508
Hmm. You call it a breakup.

576
00:31:22,588 --> 00:31:25,508
(sighs)
If I continue to work as an AE,

577
00:31:25,598 --> 00:31:28,138
I may not be able to get married
because I can't even date a guy.

578
00:31:28,218 --> 00:31:30,848
How many times did this happen already?

579
00:31:30,938 --> 00:31:33,768
-(breathes roughly)
-So find someone in this company.

580
00:31:35,148 --> 00:31:37,568
Go out on a date after working overtime.

581
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:39,988
And after staying up all night,

582
00:31:40,358 --> 00:31:42,528
you know, kiss.

583
00:31:43,158 --> 00:31:46,028
Within the same building,...

584
00:31:46,118 --> 00:31:49,328
(chuckles)
...you can do everything you want to do.

585
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:52,288
You should come to the
anniversary banquet.

586
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:55,248
Join us and try
to hook up with a nice guy at the party.

587
00:31:55,328 --> 00:31:57,128
Do you have time to date a guy?

588
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,258
You should work.

589
00:32:02,508 --> 00:32:04,138
Jeez, you little

590
00:32:04,218 --> 00:32:06,718
Cha Minhu, for God's sake.

591
00:32:07,848 --> 00:32:10,268
(sucks air)
Actually, the most eligible bachelor

592
00:32:10,348 --> 00:32:11,768
in this company is Cha Minhu.

593
00:32:13,478 --> 00:32:14,648
That's right.

594
00:32:14,728 --> 00:32:18,108
He would be perfect if he wasn't scary.

595
00:32:19,398 --> 00:32:21,818
What would it be like to date Cha Minhu?

596
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:24,238
(chuckles)
That'd be nice.

597
00:32:24,318 --> 00:32:25,618
Think about today.

598
00:32:25,698 --> 00:32:27,948
He just showed up out of nowhere
and fixed everything for us.

599
00:32:28,028 --> 00:32:29,288
(giggles)

600
00:32:30,238 --> 00:32:31,408
I've thought...

601
00:32:32,578 --> 00:32:34,998
about that too.
(laughs)

602
00:32:35,368 --> 00:32:36,578
About what?

603
00:32:38,038 --> 00:32:39,128
Going out...

604
00:32:39,798 --> 00:32:41,508
-with Cha Minhu.
-(exclaims)

605
00:32:42,128 --> 00:32:43,008
(exclaims)

606
00:32:43,088 --> 00:32:45,638
(both giggle)

607
00:32:46,338 --> 00:32:47,298
(laughs)

608
00:32:47,388 --> 00:32:49,468
I think it'd be great to go out with him.

609
00:32:50,968 --> 00:32:52,728
Do you think you can handle him?

610
00:32:52,808 --> 00:32:55,138
What? What are you talking about?

611
00:32:56,598 --> 00:32:59,108
Do you really want to go out
with such a sociopath?

612
00:32:59,188 --> 00:33:01,188
(quirky music)

613
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:10,028
(upbeat music)

614
00:33:23,628 --> 00:33:26,008
Hong Yesool. Didn't you read the sign?

615
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:28,138
That I'm going to ask you out today.

616
00:33:28,678 --> 00:33:30,098
(gasps in bewilderment)
What?

617
00:33:30,178 --> 00:33:32,268
You're too dull to be an AE,
for God's sake.

618
00:33:32,388 --> 00:33:33,768
Just quit your job!

619
00:33:34,098 --> 00:33:36,808
And you can go out with me if you want.

620
00:33:38,598 --> 00:33:39,768
What?

621
00:33:41,188 --> 00:33:43,398
Is this how you want to be asked out?

622
00:33:43,818 --> 00:33:45,818
Hong Yesool!

623
00:33:46,028 --> 00:33:49,068
Do you come to work to show off
how incompetent you are?

624
00:33:49,618 --> 00:33:50,738
(groaning)

625
00:33:50,908 --> 00:33:53,238
-I stayed up all night to do this.
-You're making an excuse again!

626
00:33:53,328 --> 00:33:54,578
You're all talk.

627
00:33:54,788 --> 00:33:56,868
I told you not to do anything
you'd be sorry for!

628
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:00,838
By the way,...

629
00:34:01,338 --> 00:34:03,298
(pants)
...do you know how to kiss?

630
00:34:04,378 --> 00:34:05,338
What?

631
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:07,798
I can't kiss you all night long though.

632
00:34:09,048 --> 00:34:11,048
Kiss! Kiss!

633
00:34:11,388 --> 00:34:12,968
-(screams)
-Kiss!

634
00:34:14,308 --> 00:34:15,518
(smacks lips)

635
00:34:18,308 --> 00:34:19,938
Is that the kind of kiss you want?

636
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:21,978
(breathes fearfully)

637
00:34:22,318 --> 00:34:23,318
Forget it.

638
00:34:23,608 --> 00:34:26,028
Let's not talk about him.
Not even casually.

639
00:34:26,108 --> 00:34:27,988
You guys know nothing about Cha the Jerk.

640
00:34:28,068 --> 00:34:29,698
If you know him that well,
why don't you go out with him?

641
00:34:29,778 --> 00:34:30,818
Are you crazy?

642
00:34:31,238 --> 00:34:32,488
(Eomji tongue clicks)

643
00:34:33,328 --> 00:34:35,328
Ms. Hong. No, sit down.

644
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:36,828
Oh, okay.

645
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,788
(clears throat, sniffs)

646
00:34:39,868 --> 00:34:42,378
Can we talk for a minute?

647
00:34:57,098 --> 00:34:58,268
(sighs)

648
00:34:58,978 --> 00:35:00,018
KYUNGSEOK: So, Ms. Hong.

649
00:35:00,768 --> 00:35:02,098
I'm wondering which company

650
00:35:02,518 --> 00:35:05,648
you're going to subcontract
to set up the pop-up store.

651
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:07,148
I contacted the production company

652
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:09,198
that set up the perfume pop-up store
with us last time.

653
00:35:09,278 --> 00:35:10,398
Is there a problem?

654
00:35:10,488 --> 00:35:12,698
(gasps)
See? I knew it.

655
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:14,198
Are you crazy, Ms. Hong?

656
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,948
They're not cost-effective.
You didn't know?

657
00:35:16,408 --> 00:35:17,868
Oh, boy.

658
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:19,708
(smacks lips)

659
00:35:19,958 --> 00:35:20,828
Here.

660
00:35:22,418 --> 00:35:24,088
KIM PRODUCTION, PRESIDENT KIM SEUNGHYUK

661
00:35:24,168 --> 00:35:26,878
This is my friend's company.

662
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,298
This is the one that set up
a pop-up store for Caddi Camera.

663
00:35:29,758 --> 00:35:33,258
It was different from the floor plan,
so we had to go through a lot of trouble.

664
00:35:33,338 --> 00:35:34,598
And it went over the budget.

665
00:35:35,548 --> 00:35:37,098
That was...

666
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:38,428
Right.

667
00:35:38,518 --> 00:35:40,978
The assistant director didn't hand
the revised version to them, so...

668
00:35:41,058 --> 00:35:42,558
We don't have much time left,

669
00:35:43,018 --> 00:35:45,518
so I think we should choose the company
that we worked with last time.

670
00:35:45,608 --> 00:35:46,648
Fine.

671
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:48,728
Good luck with that.

672
00:35:49,568 --> 00:35:52,778
Let's see how well that goes.

673
00:35:56,868 --> 00:35:58,828
I WANT TO JOIN ZEU AD!
PLEASE PICK ME! DON'T LOSE ME!

674
00:36:13,678 --> 00:36:15,508
HELP ME BECOME A PM WHO IMPRESSES
THE WHOLE NATION

675
00:36:15,588 --> 00:36:17,968
I'LL BECOME THE PM OF THE MORPHIS CAMPAIGN

676
00:36:38,658 --> 00:36:40,828
PLEASE HELP ME COMPLETE MY FIRST PROJECT
AS A PM WITHOUT A HITCH

677
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:55,758
BIRTH OF ZELUS

678
00:36:55,838 --> 00:37:02,768
JEONIN SHOPPING CENTER

679
00:37:05,978 --> 00:37:09,018
YESOOL: Since they feel comfortable
using social media,

680
00:37:09,108 --> 00:37:10,518
I think we should go for...

681
00:37:10,608 --> 00:37:12,898
They can also enjoy shopping online.

682
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:15,028
We'd better have a shoot.

683
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:17,618
I think we should make the best use of it.

684
00:37:18,068 --> 00:37:19,578
-Let's wrap it up.
-ROMA: Thank you.

685
00:37:19,658 --> 00:37:21,238
MINHEE: Thank you.

686
00:37:22,748 --> 00:37:24,458
Okay. Go for this.

687
00:37:24,538 --> 00:37:25,538
Yes, sir.

688
00:37:29,128 --> 00:37:30,458
(door opens)

689
00:37:30,798 --> 00:37:32,088
(door closes)

690
00:37:43,388 --> 00:37:45,058
-(Eomji coughs)
-Is everything going well?

691
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:46,638
-Of course, ma'am.
-Goodness!

692
00:37:46,728 --> 00:37:48,848
-I'll put it right here. Is that okay?
-Yes, go ahead.

693
00:37:48,938 --> 00:37:49,978
Jeez, look at the dust.
(coughs)

694
00:37:50,058 --> 00:37:51,068
Excuse me, sir.

695
00:37:51,148 --> 00:37:52,478
Please don't make creases.
Do it carefully.

696
00:37:52,568 --> 00:37:54,688
It has to be neat. That's the key.
Please make it look neat.

697
00:37:55,528 --> 00:37:56,858
I told you to throw this away.

698
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:58,568
KYUNGSEOK: Man.

699
00:38:00,118 --> 00:38:01,408
Come on, get up.

700
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:03,158
I have a plan.

701
00:38:03,238 --> 00:38:04,828
I'm going to share pictures
of this on my social media accounts.

702
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:06,748
-Look how soft this is.
-For God's sake.

703
00:38:06,828 --> 00:38:07,998
If I post the pictures,
it'll attract a lot of attention.

704
00:38:08,078 --> 00:38:09,378
Get up.

705
00:38:09,828 --> 00:38:10,838
Look at you lying around doing nothing.

706
00:38:10,918 --> 00:38:13,298
What now? Should I take a picture of you?
Should I? Huh?

707
00:38:13,378 --> 00:38:15,208
-Are you here to have fun?
-EOMJI: I'm sorry.

708
00:38:15,298 --> 00:38:17,798
We have a lot to do.
Go find things to do, for God's sake.

709
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:19,088
(moans)

710
00:38:19,178 --> 00:38:20,298
(sighs)

711
00:38:22,348 --> 00:38:25,058
-You're being so silly.
-How do I look? Do I look like Oh Jiyoung?

712
00:38:25,138 --> 00:38:26,768
-Do I?
-No.

713
00:38:27,558 --> 00:38:30,598
Stop talking about Oh Jiyoung.
Just do your work, for God's sake.

714
00:38:30,688 --> 00:38:32,148
SANGGOO: Please carry this. Man.

715
00:38:32,228 --> 00:38:33,398
(grunting)
Here.

716
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:35,358
My stomach hurts.
That's why. Come and help me.

717
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,698
Don't forget to take this.

718
00:38:38,778 --> 00:38:39,818
(grunts)

719
00:38:39,908 --> 00:38:41,908
(upbeat music)

720
00:38:44,448 --> 00:38:45,788
YESOOL: Wait a second, please!

721
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:54,458
(Minhee gasps)

722
00:38:55,048 --> 00:38:56,458
Damn it!

723
00:38:56,548 --> 00:38:58,298
Why are you still here?

724
00:38:58,378 --> 00:39:00,088
Oh, you dropped all of them.

725
00:39:00,178 --> 00:39:01,588
One, two, three.

726
00:39:02,218 --> 00:39:03,218
Goodness.

727
00:39:03,298 --> 00:39:04,428
One, two, three.

728
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:05,598
We need to spread this.

729
00:39:06,058 --> 00:39:07,518
One, two, three.

730
00:39:09,768 --> 00:39:10,978
You're so annoying.

731
00:39:11,058 --> 00:39:13,478
Guys. What is all this?
Put the shoes on the shoe rack.

732
00:39:13,558 --> 00:39:14,688
Do it properly.

733
00:39:15,318 --> 00:39:16,938
Is this supposed to be empty?

734
00:39:20,778 --> 00:39:21,988
Here.

735
00:39:22,448 --> 00:39:23,488
(grunts)

736
00:39:26,538 --> 00:39:28,578
Hang in there, everyone.
We're almost done.

737
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:30,208
-Good work.
-Yes, ma'am.

738
00:39:40,218 --> 00:39:41,218
Mr. Cha.

739
00:39:41,628 --> 00:39:43,258
Yes, I'm on my way.

740
00:39:43,338 --> 00:39:44,678
(laughing)
Yes.

741
00:39:44,758 --> 00:39:45,968
Yes, sir.

742
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:49,228
(scoffs)

743
00:39:50,308 --> 00:39:51,268
-YESOOL: Thank you.
-SANGGOO: Thank you.

744
00:39:51,348 --> 00:39:52,388
-MINHEE: Thank you.
-ROMA: Thank you for your hard work.

745
00:39:52,478 --> 00:39:53,398
Thank you for your hard work. Bye.
Have a glass of makgeolli tonight.

746
00:39:53,478 --> 00:39:54,478
Bye.

747
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:55,768
-Thank you.
-Take care.

748
00:39:56,358 --> 00:39:58,028
-Oh, man.
-Oh, I'm so exhausted.

749
00:39:58,108 --> 00:40:00,108
Boy, that was a lot of work.
It almost killed me.

750
00:40:00,188 --> 00:40:02,238
-EOMJI: It did?
-(Sanggoo laughs)

751
00:40:02,318 --> 00:40:03,358
Oh, man.
(sighs)

752
00:40:04,198 --> 00:40:06,408
(all sigh)

753
00:40:06,488 --> 00:40:08,238
-Eomji.
-Okay.

754
00:40:09,078 --> 00:40:11,158
All right. Let's see.
Let's see. Let's see.

755
00:40:11,248 --> 00:40:12,998
-SANGGOO: Yes.
-(exhales deeply)

756
00:40:15,578 --> 00:40:17,748
-ROMA: Oh.
-(Minhee exclaims)

757
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:19,758
(Sanggoo laughs)

758
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:20,798
My goodness.

759
00:40:20,878 --> 00:40:22,628
-Come and take a look at it.
-(all cheer)

760
00:40:22,718 --> 00:40:24,888
-Wow!
-(cheering continues)

761
00:40:24,968 --> 00:40:28,218
-Good job, everyone!
-Yeah!

762
00:40:28,308 --> 00:40:30,638
It's so cool. It's crazy.

763
00:40:30,718 --> 00:40:32,478
(laughs)

764
00:40:33,228 --> 00:40:35,518
Shall we get ready to go home?

765
00:40:35,598 --> 00:40:37,018
Go home? Huh? Go...

766
00:40:37,108 --> 00:40:38,688
-See you tomorrow!
-See you tomorrow!

767
00:40:38,768 --> 00:40:40,988
(Sanggoo laughs)

768
00:40:41,068 --> 00:40:42,238
See you!

769
00:40:47,118 --> 00:40:49,538
(light music)

770
00:41:02,338 --> 00:41:03,548
(grunts)

771
00:41:07,848 --> 00:41:11,098
FOREST INTO YOUR ROOM,
LIE WITH NATURE, BILLY

772
00:41:20,688 --> 00:41:22,898
If you're not physically strong,
try to do better work.

773
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:28,368
If you have to stay up for two nights
to finish something,

774
00:41:28,448 --> 00:41:30,118
learn to do it within a day.

775
00:41:30,578 --> 00:41:32,948
You spend 10 hours on things
that you can finish in an hour.

776
00:41:33,038 --> 00:41:35,078
That's why you have to rely
on things like Red Bomb.

777
00:41:36,418 --> 00:41:39,288
Everything is ready,
and we won't have any problems, right?

778
00:41:39,378 --> 00:41:40,748
Well, yes.

779
00:41:40,838 --> 00:41:45,338
Ms. Oh Jiyoung posted
about our pop-up store event tomorrow.

780
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:48,928
With reporters and her fans,
it's going to be very crowded.

781
00:41:50,388 --> 00:41:51,428
Hmm.

782
00:41:58,188 --> 00:42:00,188
(light music)

783
00:42:05,108 --> 00:42:06,608
Ms. Oh Jiyoung

784
00:42:06,698 --> 00:42:08,608
is really full of enthusiasm.

785
00:42:11,368 --> 00:42:14,198
She even rearranged her schedule
for this event.

786
00:42:14,288 --> 00:42:16,078
She's supporting us a lot.

787
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:18,538
I think tomorrow's event

788
00:42:18,618 --> 00:42:20,418
will be a great success.

789
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:24,508
Why didn't you show me
something like this earlier?

790
00:42:25,548 --> 00:42:26,588
Oh.

791
00:42:26,668 --> 00:42:27,838
Well.

792
00:42:28,628 --> 00:42:31,428
That's because of someone
who even turned down my 18th proposal.

793
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:33,968
What? Your 18th proposal?

794
00:42:35,598 --> 00:42:36,598
(sighs)

795
00:42:37,228 --> 00:42:38,848
I know you always prepare a Plan B.

796
00:42:38,938 --> 00:42:41,268
You prepare 18 or 19 proposals

797
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:43,228
and make decisions
based on my responses, right?

798
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,028
Just try to come up with one good one.

799
00:42:46,488 --> 00:42:47,358
Like

800
00:42:48,738 --> 00:42:49,988
this one.

801
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:55,328
Oh, by the way...

802
00:42:56,658 --> 00:42:57,578
"With Billy."

803
00:42:58,408 --> 00:42:59,828
That slogan is pretty lame.

804
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:02,578
Spend more time on slogans next time.

805
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:11,508
Yes!

806
00:43:12,428 --> 00:43:14,428
Nice! Nice!
(chuckles)

807
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:17,138
(light music)

808
00:43:31,278 --> 00:43:32,738
His cellphone is turned off.

809
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:34,198
His girlfriend can't get a hold
of him either.

810
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,278
SEUNGTAEK: What about his parents' house?

811
00:43:35,368 --> 00:43:37,538
He was... He was there last time.
Where was it?

812
00:43:37,618 --> 00:43:38,868
Yes, Samcheok, Gangwon-do.

813
00:43:38,948 --> 00:43:41,668
I called his parents too.
But he wasn't there.

814
00:43:41,748 --> 00:43:43,328
That punk. Did he go clubbing again?

815
00:43:43,418 --> 00:43:46,128
Sir. He's completely hopeless.

816
00:43:46,208 --> 00:43:47,498
This isn't his first time.

817
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,918
It's better that I work extra hours
to replace him.

818
00:43:50,008 --> 00:43:51,838
His presence wouldn't be of any help.

819
00:43:52,428 --> 00:43:54,468
-Hey, dude. You're his colleague, friend.
-(moans in pain)

820
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:56,888
-And teammate. How can you say that?
-Ouch, it hurts. It hurts. It hurts.

821
00:43:56,968 --> 00:43:59,058
Oh! That's Oh Jiyoung!

822
00:44:00,678 --> 00:44:03,228
-(quirky music)
-PATIENT: Oh, my goodness.

823
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:04,728
DAEHAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

824
00:44:04,938 --> 00:44:06,978
-(sighs)
-PATIENT: Oh Jiyoung.

825
00:44:07,068 --> 00:44:08,978
-She's really pretty.
-She's pretty.

826
00:44:09,068 --> 00:44:10,528
She's so pretty.

827
00:44:16,778 --> 00:44:18,988
(chuckles awkwardly)
Hi.

828
00:44:20,368 --> 00:44:21,538
(sighs)

829
00:44:22,118 --> 00:44:23,498
(moans in fatigue)

830
00:44:25,248 --> 00:44:27,918
Oh, I feel so dizzy.

831
00:44:32,758 --> 00:44:34,128
You look like...

832
00:44:36,008 --> 00:44:38,138
(sighing)
...Hyun Bin, Doctor.

833
00:44:39,058 --> 00:44:40,388
You should eat well.

834
00:44:40,468 --> 00:44:42,728
Have high-protein foods
and three meals a day regularly.

835
00:44:42,808 --> 00:44:46,148
-Don't skip meals.
-I have a photoshoot tomorrow.

836
00:44:46,228 --> 00:44:49,688
If my face gets puffy like a full moon,
will you take responsibility for that?

837
00:44:49,778 --> 00:44:51,278
I can't take responsibility for that.

838
00:44:51,858 --> 00:44:53,988
But have faith
in the Korean editors' Photoshop skills.

839
00:44:54,068 --> 00:44:56,618
I haven't eaten anything yet,
so I'm very sensitive now.

840
00:44:57,198 --> 00:45:00,198
Stop talking back to me
because it gets on my nerves.

841
00:45:00,288 --> 00:45:01,748
Talking back to...
(sighs)

842
00:45:02,828 --> 00:45:04,368
What brings you here?

843
00:45:05,208 --> 00:45:06,418
(sighs)

844
00:45:06,498 --> 00:45:07,998
(breathes roughly in frustration)

845
00:45:08,088 --> 00:45:09,628
Are you really not going to tell me?

846
00:45:10,378 --> 00:45:11,838
-Tell you what? What? What?
-For God's sake.

847
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:13,758
Hey, take off those
weird-looking shoes with pointed toes!

848
00:45:13,838 --> 00:45:15,548
Stop pretending not to know
what I'm asking you!

849
00:45:15,628 --> 00:45:17,008
The girl who kissed Minhu.

850
00:45:17,088 --> 00:45:18,428
You must know her!

851
00:45:18,508 --> 00:45:20,808
Go ask that punk yourself.
Why are you asking me that?

852
00:45:20,888 --> 00:45:22,098
I'm tied up today.

853
00:45:22,348 --> 00:45:25,098
Hey, if you keep coming to me like this,

854
00:45:25,188 --> 00:45:28,148
I'm going to tell Doctor Oh
about everything. Got it?

855
00:45:28,688 --> 00:45:29,518
For goodness' sake.

856
00:45:29,608 --> 00:45:31,478
Now listen to me.

857
00:45:31,778 --> 00:45:33,608
Get out. Get out right now.

858
00:45:34,188 --> 00:45:36,408
(moans)
Oh, my head really aches.

859
00:45:36,488 --> 00:45:37,698
I said, get out.

860
00:45:37,778 --> 00:45:38,618
My head hurts.

861
00:45:38,698 --> 00:45:41,328
My next patient will be here soon.
Get out now, for God's sake.

862
00:45:41,408 --> 00:45:43,368
Get out! Are you going to stay here?

863
00:45:43,448 --> 00:45:46,498
Oh, come on. Get out of my office,
for God's sake.

864
00:45:48,248 --> 00:45:50,088
-I'm going to come back tomorrow.
-Don't!

865
00:45:50,588 --> 00:45:52,168
-I will.
-Don't!

866
00:45:52,548 --> 00:45:53,918
-Please don't ever come here again.
-(sighs)

867
00:45:55,338 --> 00:45:56,548
OH SEUNGTAEK CELLPHONE

868
00:45:57,128 --> 00:46:00,348
SEUNGTAEK (on phone): Hey, hey, hey.
Oh Jiyoung is driving me crazy.

869
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:02,888
Please tell her
to stop coming to my office.

870
00:46:03,058 --> 00:46:05,478
I told you.
This is why you shouldn't have told her.

871
00:46:05,558 --> 00:46:07,638
You reap what you sow.

872
00:46:07,728 --> 00:46:09,768
Hey, I was just talking to Doctor Oh,
and she overheard us.

873
00:46:09,858 --> 00:46:11,768
I feel like I'm wrongly accused.

874
00:46:11,858 --> 00:46:13,778
-MINHU (on phone): Hey. By the way,...
-(sighs)

875
00:46:13,858 --> 00:46:16,148
I think the pills I took before
are better than what I'm taking now.

876
00:46:16,238 --> 00:46:17,858
-Please get me more of those.
-SEUNGTAEK: (on phone) Oh, really?

877
00:46:18,238 --> 00:46:21,368
By the way, shouldn't
the symptoms be gone by now?

878
00:46:21,448 --> 00:46:24,158
(sighs)
It still hurts a little,

879
00:46:24,578 --> 00:46:25,498
but it's bearable.

880
00:46:25,578 --> 00:46:26,538
(Seungtaek sighs)

881
00:46:26,618 --> 00:46:28,748
No wonder. You take a lot of pills.

882
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:32,288
Because of that pop-up thing,
you're taking twice as many now.

883
00:46:32,378 --> 00:46:33,298
SEUNGTAEK (on phone):
Will you be okay with that?

884
00:46:33,378 --> 00:46:35,128
Bring them over when you have time.
I've got to go.

885
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:37,588
Hey, hey!

886
00:46:37,668 --> 00:46:38,968
Jeez, this punk.

887
00:46:40,718 --> 00:46:42,718
(whooshing)

888
00:46:47,228 --> 00:46:49,438
(upbeat music)

889
00:46:53,318 --> 00:46:54,688
-Hello.
-Welcome, everyone.

890
00:46:54,778 --> 00:46:55,898
Welcome.

891
00:46:56,358 --> 00:46:59,068
Oh, man. Oh, man.
Oh, I can take a picture of you.

892
00:46:59,238 --> 00:47:00,408
Okay.

893
00:47:01,408 --> 00:47:02,948
Sure, you can sit on it.

894
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:04,028
All right.

895
00:47:04,118 --> 00:47:06,078
Okay. Billy.

896
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:08,908
I'd appreciate it if you could share
the picture on your social media accounts.

897
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:11,208
If you share the picture
on your social media accounts,

898
00:47:11,288 --> 00:47:13,878
we'll give you "Teatime with Oh Jiyoung"
as a gift.

899
00:47:13,958 --> 00:47:15,498
EOMJI: One, two, three.

900
00:47:15,588 --> 00:47:17,878
SANGGOO: Lie with nature. Billy.

901
00:47:18,468 --> 00:47:20,008
You can go in and look around.

902
00:47:20,088 --> 00:47:22,508
One, two, three.

903
00:47:22,588 --> 00:47:24,348
One, two, three.

904
00:47:26,968 --> 00:47:28,558
The picture came out really well.

905
00:47:29,178 --> 00:47:30,348
Hi.

906
00:47:31,768 --> 00:47:33,978
(upbeat music)

907
00:47:39,238 --> 00:47:41,778
It's very soft, isn't it?
You can try lying down.

908
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:43,068
(laughs)

909
00:47:47,738 --> 00:47:49,368
NEW POST
HAVING A GOOD TIME AT BILLY POP-UP STORE

910
00:47:50,458 --> 00:47:51,788
Oh, just a second.

911
00:47:54,248 --> 00:47:55,628
BILLY POP-UP STORE

912
00:47:56,958 --> 00:47:58,798
I'M HERE AT BILLY POP-UP STORE

913
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:05,758
What's that?

914
00:48:06,218 --> 00:48:08,598
-(gasps)
-Awesome.

915
00:48:08,678 --> 00:48:09,978
(Eomji groans)

916
00:48:10,058 --> 00:48:11,388
It's a success.

917
00:48:13,478 --> 00:48:15,058
(giggling)
It's a complete success.

918
00:48:15,148 --> 00:48:16,648
I know.

919
00:48:17,768 --> 00:48:20,648
Jiyoung. Do you know how much
I was harassed by the director

920
00:48:20,738 --> 00:48:22,738
when I asked him to change
your shooting schedule?

921
00:48:22,818 --> 00:48:24,028
It's because of him, right?

922
00:48:24,358 --> 00:48:26,408
You usually don't accept changes
if you're not given notice.

923
00:48:26,948 --> 00:48:28,908
But you remember the shoot
on that rainy day? Huh?

924
00:48:28,988 --> 00:48:30,868
They changed the concept
of the commercial because of the rain.

925
00:48:30,948 --> 00:48:32,998
But you didn't complain about it.
Today too.

926
00:48:33,078 --> 00:48:34,498
It's because of Cha Minhu, right?

927
00:48:36,418 --> 00:48:37,418
How disrespectful.

928
00:48:38,378 --> 00:48:39,668
(sighs)

929
00:48:39,758 --> 00:48:42,378
He's not a friend of yours.
(tuts)

930
00:48:43,928 --> 00:48:45,338
(sighs)

931
00:48:48,348 --> 00:48:49,638
It smells?

932
00:48:52,598 --> 00:48:54,268
I don't smell anything.

933
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:56,398
Call the janitor's office and ask them
to turn on the air-conditioners.

934
00:48:56,478 --> 00:48:58,898
And get some air freshener and spray it
before we get more customers.

935
00:48:59,188 --> 00:49:00,438
Air freshener?

936
00:49:00,778 --> 00:49:01,938
Keep your distance.

937
00:49:02,028 --> 00:49:03,398
I can still hear you.

938
00:49:03,488 --> 00:49:04,948
-Do it right now.
-Oh.

939
00:49:05,028 --> 00:49:06,198
Okay.

940
00:49:06,738 --> 00:49:08,738
(indistinct chatter)

941
00:49:19,668 --> 00:49:20,628
Chief.

942
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:22,418
Yes?

943
00:49:24,418 --> 00:49:26,798
The left supporting stand
seems to be unstable.

944
00:49:26,888 --> 00:49:28,348
And the floor seems to be slippery.

945
00:49:28,848 --> 00:49:30,098
Please check them.

946
00:49:31,388 --> 00:49:32,638
Well...

947
00:49:35,058 --> 00:49:38,358
Why does he keep asking me to check
the stuff? For goodness' sake.

948
00:49:40,768 --> 00:49:41,858
Oh!

949
00:49:42,728 --> 00:49:44,238
(sniffs)

950
00:49:44,318 --> 00:49:46,358
(coughs)
I don't smell anything.

951
00:49:46,448 --> 00:49:47,818
He says he does.

952
00:49:48,238 --> 00:49:52,988
He's so sensitive. It must be so hard
for him to live in this world.

953
00:49:53,078 --> 00:49:54,448
He's not just sensitive.

954
00:49:54,538 --> 00:49:56,868
It's not like I'm some kind of insect.
What's wrong with him?

955
00:49:57,498 --> 00:49:58,708
You know what?

956
00:49:59,498 --> 00:50:01,168
I think

957
00:50:01,588 --> 00:50:03,798
he has slightly changed.

958
00:50:03,878 --> 00:50:06,298
Since that day.
You know, the day of the shoot.

959
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:08,678
No, he's always been like that.

960
00:50:08,758 --> 00:50:12,008
He's just a cranky and sensitive person.

961
00:50:12,098 --> 00:50:13,928
Whatever we do, it never satisfies him.

962
00:50:14,018 --> 00:50:15,928
He just relieves his stress
by intimidating...

963
00:50:16,018 --> 00:50:17,388
That's pretty harsh.

964
00:50:19,898 --> 00:50:21,058
(scoffs)

965
00:50:22,148 --> 00:50:23,608
Oh, that's Oh Jiyoung!

966
00:50:23,688 --> 00:50:26,108
-(crowd clamoring)
-CUSTOMER: Huh? Oh Jiyoung?

967
00:50:26,188 --> 00:50:27,488
-MANAGER: Excuse me.
-HAIRSTYLIST: Excuse me.

968
00:50:27,568 --> 00:50:29,158
-It's Oh Jiyoung, right?
-(crowd clamoring)

969
00:50:29,238 --> 00:50:30,868
Please line up if you want to get
her autograph.

970
00:50:30,948 --> 00:50:33,408
-ROMA: Please line up right here.
-CUSTOMER: Please take a picture with me!

971
00:50:33,538 --> 00:50:35,328
-ROMA: This way, please!
-Please look at me!

972
00:50:35,408 --> 00:50:36,868
-(crowd clamoring)
-I'm a big fan of yours! Here. Here.

973
00:50:36,958 --> 00:50:38,918
-She's so pretty!
-I'm a real fan of yours! Seriously!

974
00:50:38,998 --> 00:50:41,628
-Please tell all your friends about Billy.
-(clamoring)

975
00:50:41,708 --> 00:50:42,838
Here!

976
00:50:42,918 --> 00:50:46,378
-EOMJI: Wow, she's a great help to us.
-CUSTOMER: Wow, you're so pretty!

977
00:50:46,458 --> 00:50:48,878
-(crowd clamoring)
-(camera shutter clicks)

978
00:50:59,018 --> 00:51:00,848
She must've heard everything, right?

979
00:51:01,648 --> 00:51:04,358
Yeah, she definitely did.

980
00:51:07,488 --> 00:51:11,868
Do you often bad-mouth
your boss like that?

981
00:51:12,698 --> 00:51:15,158
I really hate people
who smile in front of me

982
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:16,998
but curse at me behind my back.

983
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:20,038
Today, I personally

984
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:22,958
went to a police station
and filed suits against those

985
00:51:23,458 --> 00:51:25,498
who left hate comments about me.

986
00:51:25,628 --> 00:51:28,878
Well, I think there's a misunderstanding.

987
00:51:28,968 --> 00:51:29,968
I agree.

988
00:51:30,258 --> 00:51:32,928
Mr. Cha is a bit cranky

989
00:51:33,218 --> 00:51:34,258
and sensitive.

990
00:51:34,718 --> 00:51:36,388
Yes, that's why.

991
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:41,058
Talking behind his back helps me
relieve some stress, so...

992
00:51:41,138 --> 00:51:43,768
But that's one of his charms

993
00:51:44,308 --> 00:51:46,228
and how he could succeed in this field.

994
00:51:47,228 --> 00:51:50,238
And that's what makes him sexy.
Don't you agree?

995
00:51:50,778 --> 00:51:51,738
Exactly.

996
00:51:52,028 --> 00:51:55,278
I also think he's sexy
when he's oversensitive.

997
00:51:55,368 --> 00:51:56,658
And that's what I was going to talk about.

998
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:59,118
I always wondered
why he looked out for you

999
00:51:59,198 --> 00:52:01,078
for the past few years.

1000
00:52:01,158 --> 00:52:03,328
(scoffing)
For goodness' sake.

1001
00:52:03,418 --> 00:52:04,958
How could you talk behind his back?

1002
00:52:07,588 --> 00:52:08,798
So

1003
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:12,878
I'd like to drink some coffee.

1004
00:52:16,428 --> 00:52:17,468
I said, coffee.

1005
00:52:19,018 --> 00:52:21,178
Oh, coffee?
(chuckles awkwardly)

1006
00:52:22,188 --> 00:52:24,898
A chocolate cream Frappuccino
with four shots of Frappuccino roast,

1007
00:52:24,978 --> 00:52:27,188
three shots of hazelnut syrup,
five shots of mocha syrup,

1008
00:52:27,268 --> 00:52:29,728
espresso whipped cream,
lots of whole java chips,

1009
00:52:29,818 --> 00:52:30,898
and chocolate drizzle.

1010
00:52:30,988 --> 00:52:34,608
And a caramel Frappuccino
with hazelnut syrup and caramel drizzle.

1011
00:52:35,158 --> 00:52:36,318
Sorry?

1012
00:52:37,868 --> 00:52:39,118
Again.

1013
00:52:39,538 --> 00:52:42,708
A chocolate cream Frappuccino
with four shots of Frappuccino roast...

1014
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:44,868
(pants)

1015
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:49,878
-Hi, Manager. I'm on my way right now...
-JIYOUNG (on phone): It's me, Oh Jiyoung.

1016
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:52,838
I forgot that I had something
to do after this.

1017
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:56,638
Oh, no. You didn't place
the order already, did you?

1018
00:52:57,098 --> 00:52:57,968
(laughs awkwardly)

1019
00:52:58,048 --> 00:53:00,558
YESOOL (on phone): No, not yet.
I was just standing in line...

1020
00:53:05,398 --> 00:53:06,518
Hey, go slowly.

1021
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:08,648
(sighs)

1022
00:53:09,108 --> 00:53:10,648
Ah.

1023
00:53:12,238 --> 00:53:14,648
(upbeat music)

1024
00:53:32,878 --> 00:53:34,128
Ah.

1025
00:53:34,218 --> 00:53:35,798
For God's sake.

1026
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:41,178
-(crowd clamoring)
-MAN: I want to sleep here!

1027
00:53:41,258 --> 00:53:42,518
-CUSTOMER: Goodness.
-MAN: I want to sleep here!

1028
00:53:42,598 --> 00:53:44,638
No, you can't sleep here!
Sanggoo. Please help me.

1029
00:53:44,728 --> 00:53:46,558
Leave me alone!

1030
00:53:46,688 --> 00:53:47,938
(gasps)
Yesool!

1031
00:53:48,018 --> 00:53:49,268
(pants)
Look.

1032
00:53:49,808 --> 00:53:51,778
That homeless man wants to sleep there.

1033
00:53:51,858 --> 00:53:53,188
He won't leave. What should we do?

1034
00:53:53,278 --> 00:53:54,148
MAN: For God's sake!

1035
00:53:54,238 --> 00:53:57,198
-Sanggoo!
-I'll carry this thing. Let's go.

1036
00:53:57,278 --> 00:53:59,158
This is why he told me to spray
some air freshener.

1037
00:53:59,238 --> 00:54:00,578
-ROMA: For God's sake.
-SANGGOO: Let's go, Roma.

1038
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:02,328
(grunting)
Please get up. Get up now.

1039
00:54:02,408 --> 00:54:04,248
-SANGGOO: Oh, man.
-YESOOL: Excuse me, sir.

1040
00:54:04,788 --> 00:54:06,998
Why don't you drink this and calm down?

1041
00:54:07,078 --> 00:54:08,078
(moans)

1042
00:54:08,168 --> 00:54:10,668
(all groan)

1043
00:54:12,208 --> 00:54:13,918
Call someone from the janitor's office.

1044
00:54:14,008 --> 00:54:15,628
I'll deal with him. Why don't you go...

1045
00:54:15,718 --> 00:54:17,428
-You need to hurry.
-SANGGOO: Go right now.

1046
00:54:17,508 --> 00:54:18,388
(sighs)

1047
00:54:19,178 --> 00:54:20,258
Oh, no.

1048
00:54:21,138 --> 00:54:23,888
Am I not allowed to sleep here
because I'm homeless?

1049
00:54:24,468 --> 00:54:26,018
Let me take a little nap here.

1050
00:54:26,518 --> 00:54:30,768
Sir. We paid a fair price
to rent this place.

1051
00:54:30,858 --> 00:54:34,148
If you keep making a scene,
we'll have to call the police.

1052
00:54:34,278 --> 00:54:37,488
I'll give you some money
for a motel or a sauna,

1053
00:54:37,568 --> 00:54:38,738
so please leave.

1054
00:54:41,028 --> 00:54:42,988
-Let go of me!
-(all groan)

1055
00:54:43,078 --> 00:54:45,998
-(crowd clamoring)
-I won't leave. I won't!

1056
00:54:46,078 --> 00:54:47,288
-SANGGOO: Please, for God's sake.
-YESOOL: Sir.

1057
00:54:47,368 --> 00:54:49,208
-I won't leave!
-Wait. Sir.

1058
00:54:49,498 --> 00:54:51,498
Please stop. Please.

1059
00:54:51,578 --> 00:54:52,788
(shouts)

1060
00:54:52,878 --> 00:54:53,748
-No!
-(shouting continues)

1061
00:54:53,838 --> 00:54:56,628
-Please calm down. What do we do?
-No, this is shaking.

1062
00:54:56,708 --> 00:54:58,928
(shouting)
I won't leave!

1063
00:54:59,008 --> 00:55:00,428
(crowd clamoring)

1064
00:55:00,508 --> 00:55:01,798
It's shaking.

1065
00:55:01,888 --> 00:55:03,678
No! No! Stop!

1066
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:06,218
I won't leave!
(shouting)

1067
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:12,518
(suspenseful music)

1068
00:55:13,608 --> 00:55:14,978
(snaps)

1069
00:55:22,238 --> 00:55:24,328
(creaking)

1070
00:55:31,208 --> 00:55:33,628
(all groan)

1071
00:55:33,708 --> 00:55:35,878
-CUSTOMER: Oh, no.
-(moans in pain)

1072
00:55:35,958 --> 00:55:37,258
Mr. Cha!

1073
00:55:38,088 --> 00:55:39,918
-(Minhu moans in pain)
-(gasps)

1074
00:55:41,008 --> 00:55:42,138
Oh, no.

1075
00:55:42,218 --> 00:55:44,388
(moans in pain)

1076
00:55:44,468 --> 00:55:46,508
-YESOOL: Mr. Cha. Are you okay?
-EOMJI: Oh, my goodness!

1077
00:55:46,598 --> 00:55:48,518
Are you okay, Yesool?
What is all this? Are you okay, Mr. Cha?

1078
00:55:48,598 --> 00:55:50,228
-Hey, do something about this.
-What do we do? Mr. Cha.

1079
00:55:50,308 --> 00:55:51,308
-SANGGOO: Mr. Cha!
-(Minhee screams)

1080
00:55:51,388 --> 00:55:52,308
-What do we do?
-What do we do? Call an ambulance.

1081
00:55:52,398 --> 00:55:53,688
-An ambulance. Call an ambulance.
-Call an ambulance!

1082
00:55:53,768 --> 00:55:54,768
Does anyone have a cellphone?
Who has one? Please call 911.

1083
00:55:54,858 --> 00:55:55,978
-Oh, no. What do we do?
-There you go.

1084
00:55:56,068 --> 00:55:58,028
-No, no. We're fine. We're fine.
-Yesool.

1085
00:55:58,108 --> 00:56:00,528
(siren blaring)

1086
00:56:02,068 --> 00:56:03,068
Yes.

1087
00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:06,278
It seems that he's not seriously injured.

1088
00:56:06,368 --> 00:56:08,158
He's getting treatment
in the emergency room.

1089
00:56:09,408 --> 00:56:11,618
Please clean up the pop-up store for me.

1090
00:56:11,708 --> 00:56:14,288
Call our legal team to stop the press
from writing about it.

1091
00:56:15,078 --> 00:56:16,338
Bye.

1092
00:56:17,918 --> 00:56:19,048
(sighs)

1093
00:56:21,418 --> 00:56:22,588
Oh!

1094
00:56:23,048 --> 00:56:25,218
What brings you here, Ms. Hong Yesool?

1095
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:26,798
Oh, are you here to see me?

1096
00:56:27,348 --> 00:56:29,718
But you didn't make an appointment
for today.

1097
00:56:29,808 --> 00:56:32,268
Oh. It's not that.

1098
00:56:32,348 --> 00:56:33,978
My boss got hurt, so...

1099
00:56:35,858 --> 00:56:36,808
You mean, Cha Minhu?

1100
00:56:37,568 --> 00:56:39,978
Huh? Do you know my boss?

1101
00:56:41,108 --> 00:56:43,778
Wh... Where is he now? Where? Huh?

1102
00:56:43,908 --> 00:56:45,948
Oh, over there.

1103
00:56:49,038 --> 00:56:50,368
Here.

1104
00:56:54,038 --> 00:56:55,038
(sighs)

1105
00:56:55,628 --> 00:56:57,288
What happened? Did you faint again?

1106
00:56:57,958 --> 00:57:00,878
You crazy punk.
I told you not to take too many pills.

1107
00:57:06,388 --> 00:57:08,298
YESOOL: I wasn't mistaken.

1108
00:57:09,348 --> 00:57:10,718
Maybe it's really going to happen.

1109
00:57:10,808 --> 00:57:12,138
Hey.

1110
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:17,978
(sighs)

1111
00:57:18,898 --> 00:57:20,818
-How is he, Doctor?
-Sorry?

1112
00:57:21,318 --> 00:57:22,898
Oh, is he your friend?

1113
00:57:23,438 --> 00:57:25,068
Fortunately, his bones are fine.

1114
00:57:25,148 --> 00:57:27,568
But he needs to come for a few days
to replace the dressing.

1115
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:29,658
And I think it'll scar.

1116
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:32,868
Why are you here?

1117
00:57:33,038 --> 00:57:35,538
You're supposed to wrap up the event.
You're the person in charge.

1118
00:57:36,458 --> 00:57:38,918
-What are you staring at?
-What?

1119
00:57:38,998 --> 00:57:42,008
You've been staring at my back
since that day. Why?

1120
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:44,798
Well, no, no. It's nothing like that.

1121
00:57:45,798 --> 00:57:47,838
Are you okay? You saved me.

1122
00:57:48,388 --> 00:57:49,508
I didn't do that to save you.

1123
00:57:49,598 --> 00:57:52,518
I did it to prevent another accident
at the event. Don't flatter yourself.

1124
00:57:53,808 --> 00:57:55,018
Oh, okay.

1125
00:57:55,518 --> 00:57:56,728
Hey.

1126
00:57:58,768 --> 00:57:59,858
(sighs)

1127
00:58:03,068 --> 00:58:06,238
What a coincidence. Unbelievable, right?

1128
00:58:06,318 --> 00:58:08,778
For some reason,
I wanted to take better care of you

1129
00:58:08,868 --> 00:58:11,028
than my other patients. This was why.

1130
00:58:11,118 --> 00:58:12,538
It's a small world, isn't it?

1131
00:58:12,618 --> 00:58:16,038
Oh, and that punk is a friend of mine
from high school.

1132
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:18,168
He has a nasty temper,
but he always does a perfect job in

1133
00:58:18,248 --> 00:58:20,668
whatever he does,
so please have mercy on him.

1134
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:22,798
Oh, Ms. Hong Yesool.

1135
00:58:22,878 --> 00:58:25,718
Did you drink Red Bomb today?

1136
00:58:27,428 --> 00:58:29,008
(moans in pain)
Hey.

1137
00:58:29,258 --> 00:58:30,428
Hey, Cha Minhu.

1138
00:58:31,048 --> 00:58:31,928
Where are you going?

1139
00:58:32,808 --> 00:58:34,718
Where are you going in this state? Huh?

1140
00:58:35,218 --> 00:58:36,888
Come here. Come here, dude.

1141
00:58:37,018 --> 00:58:39,308
Give me your car key. Give me the key.

1142
00:58:39,398 --> 00:58:40,438
Give me the key.

1143
00:58:40,558 --> 00:58:42,768
-What do you think you're doing?
-I said, give me the key.

1144
00:58:43,018 --> 00:58:44,858
Are you out of your mind?
Trying to drive in this state?

1145
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:46,438
Anesthesia plus medication. Huh?

1146
00:58:47,988 --> 00:58:49,238
Oh, Yesool.

1147
00:58:50,658 --> 00:58:51,988
You can drive, can't you?

1148
00:58:52,368 --> 00:58:53,788
-Oh. Yes.
-Here.

1149
00:58:53,868 --> 00:58:55,328
Forget it. I'll drive myself.

1150
00:58:56,288 --> 00:58:58,958
No. But I can't take you home now.
Should I call Oh Jiyoung over?

1151
00:58:59,248 --> 00:59:00,328
Jesus.

1152
00:59:03,338 --> 00:59:04,958
Then I'll use a chauffeur service.
Call someone for me.

1153
00:59:05,048 --> 00:59:08,008
Right here. Chauffeur Hong. Here.

1154
00:59:08,338 --> 00:59:11,178
Chauffeur Hong. Please drive him home. Go.
She's your chauffeur. Go.

1155
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:12,678
Please take care of him, Yesool.

1156
00:59:13,298 --> 00:59:15,928
Come. What are you doing? Come.

1157
00:59:16,018 --> 00:59:18,428
Come. Come on, dude.

1158
00:59:18,518 --> 00:59:21,938
All right. Get in the car.
Get in, Cha Minhu.

1159
00:59:22,478 --> 00:59:24,688
-SEUNGTAEK: Bye.
-(Minhu grunts)

1160
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:32,198
(car horn honking)

1161
00:59:43,628 --> 00:59:45,338
YESOOL: The scar I saw earlier.

1162
00:59:46,418 --> 00:59:47,838
I wasn't mistaken.

1163
00:59:48,128 --> 00:59:50,678
Keep your eyes on the road.
And drive safely.

1164
00:59:59,138 --> 01:00:01,558
Can you close the window? It's a bit loud.

1165
01:00:01,638 --> 01:00:02,768
Oh.

1166
01:00:06,768 --> 01:00:07,978
(sighs)

1167
01:00:09,318 --> 01:00:10,528
YESOOL: No, no.

1168
01:00:10,608 --> 01:00:11,948
Maybe it's just a coincidence.

1169
01:00:12,028 --> 01:00:14,068
Me and Cha Minhu? That can't be true.

1170
01:00:14,158 --> 01:00:16,278
(whooshing)

1171
01:00:16,368 --> 01:00:18,488
(tires screech)

1172
01:00:34,258 --> 01:00:35,758
What do I do?

1173
01:00:35,848 --> 01:00:37,758
Should I take him back to the hospital?

1174
01:00:38,098 --> 01:00:39,308
(sighs)

1175
01:00:41,928 --> 01:00:43,598
OH SEUNGTAEK
CELLPHONE

1176
01:00:43,688 --> 01:00:45,688
(cell phone vibrates)

1177
01:00:49,938 --> 01:00:51,568
SEUNGTAEK (on phone):
Hey, did you get home safely?

1178
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:54,318
YESOOL (on phone):
Doctor. It's me, Hong Yesool.

1179
01:00:55,908 --> 01:00:57,578
Oh, hi, Yesool.

1180
01:00:57,658 --> 01:01:00,198
We just arrived at his apartment building.

1181
01:01:00,788 --> 01:01:02,658
But he doesn't look well.

1182
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:05,538
Should I bring him back to the hospital?

1183
01:01:05,628 --> 01:01:07,878
Oh, no, no.
Please just take him to his place.

1184
01:01:07,958 --> 01:01:09,048
Oh.

1185
01:01:09,128 --> 01:01:11,458
But it'll be harder for him
if you're there.

1186
01:01:11,548 --> 01:01:12,668
Sorry?

1187
01:01:12,758 --> 01:01:14,088
Oh, no. I mean,

1188
01:01:14,178 --> 01:01:16,298
I think it'll be hard for you
to carry him.

1189
01:01:16,388 --> 01:01:18,428
-(Seungtaek laughs awkwardly)
-Oh.

1190
01:01:19,178 --> 01:01:20,518
That's no problem.

1191
01:01:20,598 --> 01:01:21,888
Well, just lay him down on the bed

1192
01:01:21,968 --> 01:01:23,728
and give him the medicine
on his nightstand.

1193
01:01:24,018 --> 01:01:25,558
Oh, and his lock code is...

1194
01:01:25,648 --> 01:01:27,268
(elevator dings)

1195
01:01:27,358 --> 01:01:29,358
(pants)

1196
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:33,238
(grunts)

1197
01:01:36,238 --> 01:01:37,318
Why is he so heavy?

1198
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:39,868
(grunting)
Oh, there it is.

1199
01:01:41,578 --> 01:01:43,578
(beeping)

1200
01:01:47,668 --> 01:01:50,548
Shit, I should've just taken him
to the hospital. Shit.

1201
01:01:50,628 --> 01:01:52,458
Oh, Seungtaek, that jerk. I'll kill him.

1202
01:01:53,258 --> 01:01:54,798
(grunts)

1203
01:01:56,928 --> 01:01:58,258
For God's sake.

1204
01:01:58,338 --> 01:02:00,388
(exhales deeply)

1205
01:02:00,468 --> 01:02:01,638
Man, it's hot.

1206
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:02,968
(exhales sharply)

1207
01:02:06,688 --> 01:02:07,728
(scoffs)

1208
01:02:08,268 --> 01:02:09,308
What is all this?

1209
01:02:09,858 --> 01:02:12,358
He told me not to take medicine, but he...

1210
01:02:16,738 --> 01:02:18,608
(sighs)
Water.

1211
01:02:29,748 --> 01:02:31,038
What?

1212
01:02:31,918 --> 01:02:34,128
There's only water in the fridge?
(scoffs)

1213
01:02:38,628 --> 01:02:41,258
What's wrong with this place?

1214
01:02:48,228 --> 01:02:50,228
(door keypad beeps)

1215
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:51,728
(door opens)

1216
01:02:51,808 --> 01:02:53,108
(door closes)

1217
01:02:54,228 --> 01:02:56,858
(light music)

1218
01:02:58,448 --> 01:03:00,278
(rattles)

1219
01:03:00,358 --> 01:03:01,698
(shatters)

1220
01:03:07,458 --> 01:03:09,868
(light music)

1221
01:03:55,418 --> 01:03:57,418
(upbeat music)

1222
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:22,658
YESOOL: Am I really sleeping
with that man in this room?

1223
01:04:23,698 --> 01:04:25,158
