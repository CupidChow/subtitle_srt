1
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:03,285
Let's break up.

2
00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:05,628
(dramatic music)

3
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:17,305
Hong Yesool, you seriously...

4
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,481
(sighs deeply)
You...

5
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:23,356
Is it because you can't trust me?

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,770
I told you.

7
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,068
We were bound to break up anyway.

8
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:30,236
What do you mean by "bound to"?
What does that mean?

9
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:32,616
I saw it.

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,290
I can see it.

11
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:39,871
What do you mean by that?
How would you know that?

12
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:41,463
I do know.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,090
(dramatic music)

14
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:46,049
-(door opens)
-(sighs deeply)

15
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:47,209
(door closes)

16
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,548
(dramatic music continues)

17
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:53,926
(exhales deeply)

18
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,555
(theme music)

19
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,157
EPISODE 08

20
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:59,081
(light music)

21
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,514
BASED ON THE WEBNOVEL
KISS SIXTH SENSE BY GOT W

22
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:23,063
PILYO: <i>Yesool.</i>

23
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,980
<i>Where are you hiding?</i>

24
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,029
<i>Hong Yesool.</i>

25
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,696
<i>What on earth did you see?</i>

26
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,203
<i>Yesool.</i>

27
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,456
Hong Yesool!

28
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,961
Hong Yesool!

29
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,459
Howoo. Yesool is in there, right?

30
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:54,628
No, she's not. Sorry.

31
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,216
I just need to talk to her for a bit.

32
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,051
I'm really sorry, Pilyo. Sorry.

33
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,136
-Hey, Howoo.
-I'm sorry.

34
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:01,354
Come on, not you too!

35
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,061
Hey, Ban Howoo!

36
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,230
(pants)

37
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,771
AUTOMATED VOICE: <i>The person
you have reached is not available.</i>

38
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,527
<i>Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

39
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,610
RECENT CALLS

40
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,655
HOWOO: How much did you drink?

41
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,076
Yesool.

42
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:32,047
Are you really going to
break up with Pilyo like this?

43
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,129
I know you still like him a lot.

44
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:39,676
Just tell him the truth, okay?

45
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,051
If he finds out why...

46
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:43,347
How can I tell him I can see the future?

47
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,431
That I keep seeing it?

48
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,102
That every time I look,

49
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,323
I see I'm not a part of his future.

50
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:56,898
That I saw him marry another woman.

51
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,695
How can I tell him that?

52
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:03,785
YESOOL: <i>I saw it.</i>

53
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,288
I can see it.

54
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,083
HOWOO: That woman named Eunjung?

55
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,377
You said you saw him marrying her, right?

56
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,089
It's...

57
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,842
It's better that we break up like this.

58
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:26,926
Come on, let's go inside.

59
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:39,896
PILYO: I didn't believe it at first.

60
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,279
"I've lost my mind."

61
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,946
"I've seen way too many movies."

62
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:46,204
That's what I thought.

63
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,161
I wanted to hear it from you directly,

64
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:54,502
and I went to talk to you so many times,
but you refused to see me.

65
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:59,091
I felt like I'd die at this rate,

66
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:02,089
so I made <i>Haroo</i> to try to understand you.

67
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:05,972
But while I was making it,

68
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:09,016
I suddenly started believing it.

69
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,563
What "I saw it" meant.

70
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,320
How you would cry after kissing me.

71
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,994
I came to believe it.

72
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:22,741
You're right.

73
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,822
(dramatic music)

74
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,874
Everything you just said is true.

75
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,712
But what does it matter now?

76
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,254
We went our separate ways.

77
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,457
If you're dating Cha Minhu
because you can see the future...

78
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:39,956
That's none of your business.

79
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,507
Why did you tell Cha Minhu?

80
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,809
Why did you tell him
the things you couldn't tell me

81
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,849
and even go as far as to write a contract?

82
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,932
(dramatic music)

83
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:54,651
You're right.

84
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,402
I wonder about that as well.

85
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,073
Don't you want to find out

86
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:05,698
why I came back
after being gone for three years?

87
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:14,331
THE BIRTH OF ZELUS,
BECAUSE IT'S WHERE YOUR FAMILY IS

88
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,677
HONG YESOOL

89
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,310
(line ringing)

90
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:42,652
Hello.

91
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:05,718
-Hello.
-Hey.

92
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,639
PILYO: <i>I always knew</i>

93
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,064
that you could see the future.

94
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:20,983
<i>What "I saw it" meant.</i>

95
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:23,275
<i>How you would cry after kissing me.</i>

96
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,819
I came to believe it.

97
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,413
(light music)

98
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,242
Did you narrow down the locations?

99
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:33,236
Yes.

100
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:36,037
I picked out the locations
based on our draft.

101
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,502
I'll email you
the ones we're able to rent.

102
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,633
Let's go check out the location.
Follow me.

103
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,878
(light music)

104
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:57,272
If you stand here, you can see
how many Mopix cars are on the streets

105
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,642
at a glance.

106
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,726
At a glance?

107
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,820
I can't see anything.

108
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,485
Ah...
(soft chuckle)

109
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,492
It's just a figure of speech.

110
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,787
Amusement parks, supermarkets, and malls.

111
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,791
I go around checking them out
from time to time.

112
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:23,087
People's tastes in cars differ
based on location, age, and gender.

113
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,296
All of that becomes our data.

114
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,671
Mr. Cha, how do you know places like this?

115
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,681
It's very nice.

116
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,180
It's quiet, and there's no one around.

117
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,556
Did something happen with Director Lee?

118
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,322
(sighs)

119
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:49,357
I think I might need to apologize
for breaking our confidentiality clause.

120
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,490
Director Lee saw our contract.

121
00:08:55,618 --> 00:09:00,248
And it turns out
he knew that I could see the future.

122
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,916
He knew about it?

123
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:06,751
You must've been shocked.

124
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,260
I would be lying if I said I wasn't.

125
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:14,604
But now that I know
that he knows everything,

126
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,058
in a way, I feel better.

127
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,476
Did you break up with Lee Pilyo

128
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,192
because of the future you saw?

129
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:27,324
Well, yes. I guess.

130
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:31,534
Then, I guess you'll break up with me too
if you see something bad in our future.

131
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,200
(mellow music)

132
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:37,866
(Minhu sighs)

133
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,082
Don't worry.

134
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,251
You'll never see

135
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:43,958
a bad future with me.

136
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,714
I won't let that happen.

137
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:50,337
(light music)

138
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,677
MINHU: Thank you.

139
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:58,014
Eat.

140
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:03,441
Okay.

141
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:10,899
Please eat.

142
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:17,987
Is it good?

143
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,000
Director Lee. Aren't you going to eat?

144
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:27,712
I heard a new bone broth soup place
opened up nearby.

145
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,297
You guys can go ahead.

146
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,920
Okay, we'll be back.

147
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:34,934
We'll be back.

148
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,144
Sir, should I bring something
back for you?

149
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,596
No thanks.

150
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:49,106
Then how about some sushi
from across the street? Okay?

151
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:50,822
I'm fine.

152
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,437
If you tell me your favorite sandwich
or something...

153
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,277
I said no. Forget it.

154
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,240
How will you ever become a director
when you're so dense?

155
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,744
Gosh, come on.

156
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,699
Why would you mention that again?

157
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,537
-Jeez.
-(sighs deeply)

158
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,332
The edited version is ready.

159
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,037
(cleats throat)

160
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,419
Please take a look at it later.

161
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,052
I'll be back.

162
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,507
(light music)

163
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,643
(sighs deeply)

164
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,483
(soft grunts)

165
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,188
(light music continues)

166
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,987
JIYOUNG: <i>Jiyoung is very sick.</i>

167
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,821
<i>I won't just sit back and watch
if you make my daughter cry.</i>

168
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,078
<i>She says she's free tomorrow, so...</i>

169
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,910
-MINHU: <i>This is Jiyoung, isn't it?</i>
-(gasps)

170
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,581
Oh, my God.

171
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:47,754
What the...

172
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,252
Is he psychic or something?

173
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:55,008
My spelling and grammar
were perfect this time.

174
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,259
What gave it away?

175
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,010
Have some tea.

176
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,051
Wait.

177
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:03,055
Isn't that my phone?

178
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,269
(chuckles)

179
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:08,768
Come on.

180
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,270
It's because you don't try
hard enough for your daughter.

181
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:15,186
That's because
I don't want you to get hurt.

182
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,736
That's why I'm not even trying.

183
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:17,699
Dad.

184
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,870
Does Minhu talk about
the woman he's seeing?

185
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,410
Have you seen her?

186
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,197
I know who she is.

187
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,327
Really?

188
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:29,794
What's she like?

189
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,418
Minhu is picky when it comes to women,
so she must be...

190
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,592
She has a nasty personality
and is terrible at her job.

191
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,671
She always has a sour look on her face.

192
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:38,797
She must be pretty.

193
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,511
I'm prettier, you know.

194
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,854
By the way,

195
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:48,059
is it true that Minhu feels better
when he's with her?

196
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,558
He said his symptoms disappear
when he's with her.

197
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,809
Is that really true?

198
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,690
I haven't met her yet,
so I can't say for sure,

199
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:01,157
but if that's the case,
it's a great thing for Minhu.

200
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,026
What do you mean it's a great thing?

201
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,616
Seriously!
(grunting)

202
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,003
(clears throat)

203
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,207
SANGGOO: Thank you.

204
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,417
It is impressive that
it passed the PPM on the first try.

205
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:25,429
Well, of course, we don't know if it was
his talent or connections at work.

206
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,313
What are you trying to say?

207
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,599
Hey, come on now.

208
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:33,403
Hey, everybody knows
that the vice president values Cha Minhu.

209
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,438
Just look at the photo leak incident.

210
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,943
If it were any other team,
he would've been switched out.

211
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,281
You're talking apples and oranges.

212
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,532
Mr. Cha is super competent.

213
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:44,664
Hey!

214
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,486
Competent?

215
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,659
It's all a facade.

216
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:52,374
To be blunt, they've got the best talent
working on that project.

217
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:54,826
It'd be problematic
if he couldn't get that kind of result.

218
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,883
This one's predictable too.

219
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,796
In an open desert,

220
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,510
they'll have the car
race real fast, you know.

221
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,471
He'll rotate the car
at all different angles.

222
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,850
One shot from here, and one from here.

223
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,559
Then one more from above.

224
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,019
(scoffs)
Right?

225
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,729
Yeah, you're wrong.

226
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:15,519
The concept this time is totally awesome.
You got no clue what you're talking about.

227
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:19,114
Don't overdo it. Look at you.
You're overreacting again. My goodness.

228
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,571
Don't be shocked
when you hear about it. This one...

229
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,822
We're going to hit the jackpot.

230
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:27,866
PILYO: Yes.

231
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,290
I'll check the conditions
after I look at the weather.

232
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,199
I'll get back to you on that.

233
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,118
I'll take care of that myself.

234
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,709
Director Lee will be right out
after his call.

235
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:40,553
-Let's move to the conference room.
-Okay.

236
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:43,088
(light music)

237
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,852
Why don't we get going?

238
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,942
Jeju Island?

239
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:01,112
I looked around lots of places
for the last shot of the wedding,

240
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:03,321
and this seems like the best place.

241
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:06,661
SANGGOO: Well, it's a great backdrop,

242
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,619
but would it work with our schedule
to shoot on Jeju Island?

243
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,620
If we shoot in Jeju,
we'll have to send the car there by boat.

244
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:16,004
I'll need to discuss it with Mopix first.

245
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,461
I asked Mr. Baek about it, just in case,

246
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:21,962
and he said going there
for our shoot itself isn't an issue.

247
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,756
Jeju is the setting for the movie
we're working on right now,

248
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,130
so we went there last month
to scout out some locations.

249
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,087
Booking a location
shouldn't be tough, either.

250
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:32,393
It seems like you've got
your heart set on that location.

251
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:36,520
By chance, do you have
any personal memories there?

252
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,307
No comment.

253
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,654
ROMA: Are we really going to Jeju, then?

254
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,818
That's so exciting! Isn't it?

255
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:47,027
I'll organize the location list
and email it to you.

256
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,112
All right.

257
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,987
Are we done with the meeting then?

258
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,704
That went a lot quicker than I expected.

259
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,124
-Thank you, everyone.
-Thank you.

260
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,582
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

261
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,576
Oh, right. Ms. Hong.

262
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:01,208
I'm on my way to meet
with the shooting team. Care to join me?

263
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,593
I heard you're good friends
with Director Lim Huiwoo.

264
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,706
I know Director Lim too.

265
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:06,878
I could come with...

266
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,676
Don't you have a meeting
with the Production Team?

267
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,180
Right. I'll see you next time, then.

268
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,850
Let's go.

269
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:27,534
Where are we going? I know you lied
about meeting Director Lim.

270
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:29,661
There's somewhere I want to go with you.

271
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,907
The future you saw.

272
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,120
Have you ever questioned any of it?

273
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,460
Never.

274
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,995
The future I saw has never been wrong.

275
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,764
Is that right?

276
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,513
What if I told you, you were wrong?

277
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:58,141
(light music)

278
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,657
I'm sorry,
but it's our break time right now...

279
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:19,463
(gasps)
Lee Pilyo. You were here yesterday too.

280
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,459
Oh, my. Hong Yesool?

281
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:27,253
Yesool said she wanted to see you too.

282
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,257
Gosh, Yesool!

283
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,799
It's been a while. How long has it been?

284
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,389
Honey, are they your friends?

285
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,435
Yeah, they're friends from college.

286
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,807
-You two met yesterday, right?
-Yes.

287
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,726
She was in the same major too.

288
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,356
This is my husband.

289
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:52,238
Say hi. He may look old,
but he's four years younger than me.

290
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,531
Hello.

291
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:00,411
Yesool. We haven't seen
each other in ages.

292
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:02,868
It's our first time since I got married.

293
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,665
I didn't even know you got married.

294
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,840
It's been a year.

295
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:11,054
But the kid's 14 months old.

296
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:13,131
(soft chuckle)

297
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:15,474
Actually...

298
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,925
I've been wanting to see you.

299
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,980
I've been wanting to apologize to you
about a lot of things.

300
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:26,063
Apologize?

301
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:33,239
You know, I used to flirt with Pilyo a lot
because I had a huge crush on him.

302
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:39,277
Do you want to hear something
really embarrassing?

303
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,754
My husband doesn't even know.

304
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,838
After you guys broke up,
I went to see Pilyo, who was heartbroken,

305
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,378
and confessed how I felt about him.

306
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,679
I even surprised him with a kiss
because I was drunk.

307
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,885
YESOOL: <i>Then, that was...</i>

308
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,925
(light music)

309
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:16,607
He got so mad at me
and refused to see me afterward.

310
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,367
He wouldn't pick up my calls,
and he pretended like I didn't exist.

311
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:23,409
So, I got really drunk that day

312
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:26,495
and met my husband,
married him and had a baby with him.

313
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,879
That's when he started
talking to me again.

314
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:31,956
What a mean jerk.

315
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:43,102
So, why did you guys break up?

316
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,102
Oh, well...

317
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,148
He said it was his fault
that you guys broke up.

318
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:53,152
That it was because
he couldn't gain your trust.

319
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:56,735
It wasn't because of me, was it?

320
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,705
(baby sobs)

321
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,877
Are you two done talking?

322
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,247
You traitor.

323
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,416
She was whining just a minute ago.

324
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,724
Look at her smile
as soon as she sees her mommy.

325
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,389
This is why I can't leave her
with anyone else.

326
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,683
Anyway, thank you.

327
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,600
My mother-in-law
went to a get-together today.

328
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,482
That's why I'm struggling like this.

329
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,099
Yesool, hold out as long as you can
before you get married.

330
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:32,811
Come on, pick her up.

331
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:37,735
-Come here. Come to mommy.
-Oh, my goodness. Did you miss your mommy?

332
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,949
-Say, "Mommy." Mommy.
-Mommy.

333
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,620
-She can say that.
-Can she say Daddy?

334
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:43,278
Of course! Say, "Daddy," darling.

335
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,277
Daddy.

336
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,158
-Daddy.
-Daddy.

337
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,405
Mommy.

338
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,424
You know nothing's going on

339
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,419
-between Eunjung and me.
-I just don't like it.

340
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,586
I don't want you to see her again.

341
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,380
I'm asking why you're doing this.
Just tell me why.

342
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:58,974
-Daddy.
-Daddy.

343
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,339
-Mommy.
-Mommy.

344
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,585
(Pilyo laughs)

345
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,221
So adorable.

346
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:09,727
(dramatic music)

347
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:23,784
How can you just walk away like that?
Let's talk.

348
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,451
I have nothing to say to you right now.

349
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:28,655
Let's talk later.

350
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:30,115
Talk before you go.

351
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,334
We finally get to have this conversation
after three years.

352
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:34,877
If you run away like this again,

353
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,340
then we can neither say goodbye
nor start over again.

354
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,881
We'll just be stuck like this again.

355
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,429
Fine.

356
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,888
I saw it wrong. Happy now?

357
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:48,564
I sucked back then.
I was hurting and distraught.

358
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:51,517
That was all a misunderstanding
on my part.

359
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:52,641
Happy now?

360
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,442
That's why you should've told me.
You should have...

361
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:56,362
And if I did?

362
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,650
Could you have handled it?

363
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:03,066
You would've been scared and avoided me.
And eventually, we would've broke up.

364
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,736
Do you know how scary that is?

365
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,080
"What will he see me as?"

366
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,581
"A crazy girl?"

367
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,422
"Some psychic?"

368
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,747
But I only saw unhappy futures.

369
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,382
You were happily married to another woman!

370
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:22,263
But what you saw was wrong.
That wasn't it.

371
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:28,064
When you ghosted me
and cut me off like that,

372
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:31,142
I knew I couldn't persuade you,
no matter what.

373
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:33,515
So I just waited.

374
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,352
Because I had faith.

375
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:36,864
(sighs)

376
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:40,816
Is that why you waited until
Eunjung got married and had a baby

377
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:41,741
to come back?

378
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:43,494
Yes.

379
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:48,159
Otherwise, you would've continued to
trust the future you saw and push me away.

380
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,451
(Pilyo sighs)

381
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:55,044
I don't know what you saw exactly

382
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,672
or what I'm like in that future.

383
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,086
But...

384
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,010
<i>both back then and now,</i>

385
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,046
<i>I'm right here in front of you.</i>

386
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:07,466
This is me...

387
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:09,635
This is me, right here, right now.

388
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:11,852
Back then,

389
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:13,929
and even now,

390
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:18,273
I like you a lot.

391
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,730
I know that for sure.

392
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,112
(somber music)

393
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:30,664
Sorry.

394
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,793
I don't want to hear
anything from you right now.

395
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:36,456
Let's talk later.

396
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,040
Are you running away again?

397
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:43,514
(somber music)

398
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:51,391

PILYO: <i>Hong Yesool.</i>

400
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:11,066
Why are you doing this?
You have to tell me so I'll know.

401
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,030
YESOOL: <i>And what if I tell you?</i>

402
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,618
<i>If I tell you, what can you do to fix it?</i>

403
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,083
You wouldn't believe me
even if I told you.

404
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,285
(sighs deeply)

405
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,553
-Daddy.
-Mommy.

406
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:29,842
-Boy.
-How adorable.

407
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:32,006
Mommy and Daddy.

408
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:34,505
Say, "Daddy," darling. "Daddy."

409
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:39,768
YESOOL: <i>Do you think we'd be different
if I told you?</i>

410
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:43,151
<i>We were bound to...</i>

411
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,855
break up anyway.

412
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:53,912
<i>This is</i>

413
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,950
<i>all my doing.</i>

414
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:00,829
What do you mean?

415
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,336
Ms. Hong knows Director Lim pretty well.

416
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:06,548
Since Director Lim is so particular,
I think he wanted Ms. Hong to go with him

417
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,420
since they've worked together before.

418
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:12,385
Ms. Hong probably went straight home
after meeting with the shooting team.

419
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:14,049
All right, then.

420
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:16,309
Report back to me with the final estimate

421
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:18,099
after coordinating
with the Production Team.

422
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,983
All right. I'll call it a day then.

423
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:22,021
Okay.

424
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:26,398

I thought you were dating Cha Minhu.
Did you two fight?

431
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:46,632
You two are always together.

432
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,013
You should bring him here.

433
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,220
Don't get dumped
before you even let me meet him.

434
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:56,388
I won't get dumped. Never ever.

435
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:57,761
I haven't slept with him yet.

436
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:01,692
No. Well, you never know
what's going to happen.

437
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:03,228
I was wrong about what I saw.

438
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,564
I don't know yet.

439
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,357
What? What are you talking about?

440
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:11,647
I heard Lee Pilyo is back.
Is that unsettling you?

441
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:17,493
How do you know me so well?

442
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,372
I heard your mom is back too.

443
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,077
Stop drinking, and go home.

444
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:26,416
Haejin.

445
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,132
What would you do if you were in my shoes?

446
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:31,256
What do you mean?

447
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:34,969
Everything was a misunderstanding
on my part.

448
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,854
But that misunderstanding

449
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,679
has been torturing me all this time.

450
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,639
Why do you think I have such a curse?

451
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,267
I wish I could be normal.

452
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,574
Then that would've never happened,

453
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:54,071
and I wouldn't have messed up
my own life so badly.

454
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,454
What are you talking about?

455
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,028
I mean...

456
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:01,752
My life will continue to get twisted,

457
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:05,578
and I'll just die
after things keep getting twisted.

458
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,423
How sad is that?

459
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,960
It's not like I asked for this.

460
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:14,511
I don't know why your life got twisted.

461
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,841
But even that "twisted mess"
is a part of your life.

462
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:19,346
You just need to undo what got twisted.

Ah... Did I tell you?

472
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:49,630
My dad took a lot of pictures of me

00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:49,635
SANGGOO'S WIFE: My goodness.

534
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:51,682
Come on, drive better.

535
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:53,556
PILYO: <i>This is me, right here, right now.</i>

536
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,149
Oh, my God.

537
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,730
<i>Back then, and even now,</i>

538
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:02,861
-Excuse me.
-<i>I like you a lot.</i>

539
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:04,784
-(gasps)
<i>-I know that for sure.</i>

540
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:09,454
He must be crazy. Crazy.
That's crazy, that's... I'm sorry.

541
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:12,746
-I must be crazy.
-<i>I don't want to hear anything from you.</i>

542
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,420
(quirky music)

543
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:27,221
(pants)

544
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,223
(exhales deeply)

545
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:35,604
What the heck is going on?

546
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,234
I almost got a heart attack
on my way to work.

547
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,483
-What's with that video?
-I'm going to file a lawsuit.

548
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,937
You said your cousin was a lawyer, right?

549
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:45,146
I'm going to sue the moron
who posted that video.

550
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:47,696
Okay, but that aside,

551
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,200
explain yourself first.

552
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:52,122
Did you decide to
get back together with Lee Pilyo?

553
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,751
It's not like that.

554
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:56,459
You dumped him. Right?

555
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:58,329
He was clinging to you.

556
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,996
You've lost it.

557
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,254
Just keep dating him. Why dump him?

558
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:03,843
I'm dating Cha Minhu.

559
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:07,012
Yes, so date Cha Minhu
and date Lee Pilyo too.

560
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,891
Just date them all...

561
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,434
-What?
-Keep it to yourself.

562
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:14,973
So, you're...

563
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:20,438
So you're dating Cha Minhu,
but also Lee Pilyo...

564
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:24,527
Two-timing... You were two-timing?

565
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:26,952
You're awesome.

566
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:29,238
Eomji, really. It's not like that.

567
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:33,663
We just had to resolve some issues,
and things just turned out that way.

568
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:39,617
But you know, that video.

569
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:41,037
I'm sure Cha Minhu saw it.

570
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,375
What are you going to do?

571
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,050
You know he won't just sit back.

572
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,509
Damn it.

573
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:51,505
Don't worry.

574
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,553
I bet nobody knows...

575
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:57,772
I mean, maybe... People might not know.

576
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:02,060
I have a really good eye
for these things, so right away,

577
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,976
I recognized you.
But most people wouldn't know.

578
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,355
In that video,

579
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:07,821
you looked humongous

580
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:11,202
and really stumpy too.

581
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:15,661
Only your backside showed.
No one will know.

582
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,041
Not even Cha Minhu.

583
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:21,121
He wouldn't know. No way.

584
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:22,457
Do you really think so?

585
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,344
Today, I...

586
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:29,302
I'm not even going to go
near Planning Team 1.

587
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:30,934
(sighs)

588
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:47,404
Indeed, working with you keeps things
moving along swiftly.

589
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:49,823
I've checked everything.
We'll make sure we stay on schedule.

590
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:52,862
Since we're shooting in Jeju,
please make sure there are no setbacks.

591
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:56,203
Right. You saw that video
with Director Lee Pilyo, right?

592
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,873
It's good for us,
since he's getting a lot of attention.

593
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:00,789
Is it true that the woman

594
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,172
is the inspiration
for the main character of <i>Haroo</i>?

595
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:05,169
Rumor has it
they're getting back together.

596
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,711
(laughs)

597
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:12,005
PILYO (over video):
<i>I don't know what you saw exactly.</i>

598
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:14,301
<i>or what I'm like in that future.</i>

599
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:15,545
<i>But...</i>

600
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,635
<i>both back then and now,</i>

601
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,926
<i>I'm right here in front of you.</i>

602
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,850
<i>This is me. This is...</i>

603
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:28,266
(dramatic music)

604
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,295
What's with the video?

605
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,170
Oh, well...

606
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:55,552
It's not what you think.

607
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:59,354
What I think? What is going on then?

608
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,020
Didn't I tell you?

609
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,139
I'm really possessive and jealous.

610
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:07,267
You two meeting up for work
is unavoidable,

611
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:10,265
but I don't want you seeing him
for personal reasons outside of work.

612
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,735
We agreed to respect
each other's personal lives,

613
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:15,949
but don't you think there should be
basic courtesy between lovers?

614
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:18,906
-What about you, then?
-What?

615
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:22,035
How much did you tell Ms. Oh Jiyoung
about me?

616
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:25,672
-What are you talking about?
-Haven't you heard?

617
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:29,627
Ms. Oh picked up
when I called you last night.

618
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,884
And she said

619
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,553
you're dating me only
because I have a special ability.

620
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,176
By any chance,

621
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:39,008
did you tell her about me?

622
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:43,143
I don't know what Jiyoung told you,

623
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:44,434
but that's not true.

624
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:46,097
Why would I tell her that?

625
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:48,732
Then what ability was she referring to?

626
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:50,733
How would she know about that?

627
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,573
(sighs)

628
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:55,567
That's...

629
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:59,374
Why can't you answer me?

630
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,580
It's a misunderstanding.

631
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:05,537
-I can't explain it right now...
-A misunderstanding?

632
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:07,421
Why can't you explain it?

633
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,708
(dramatic music)

634
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,589
I can't talk about this right now.
Let's talk later.

635
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:16,883
Mr. Cha.

636
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:20,089
(dramatic music continues)

637
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,098
(door opens)

638
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:22,972
(door closes)

639
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:28,897
(sighs deeply)

640
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:33,401
PILYO: Hello.

641
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,362
Here, have some of this.

642
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:36,863
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

643
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:46,414
Here's some bubble tea for you,
your favorite!

644
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:48,615
With 70% sweetness,
filled halfway with ice.

645
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,956
Extra boba. One layer of milk foam. Right?

646
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,592
Don't I have a great memory?

647
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:55,838
This is how well I know you, Ms. Yoo.

648
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:59,302
You doing this
won't make it go away easily.

649
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:02,433
I know. But you can make it go away.

650
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:05,471
Because you have really great skills!

651
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:08,425
Do you know how hard it was
to block the press

652
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:10,477
when you got into a fight with a reporter?

653
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,601
(scoffs)

654
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:12,687
I know.

655
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:16,527
So if you stop this one, I'll sign
a contract with you for another film.

656
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:19,069
The remaining Q&As, interviews,
and TV appearances.

657
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:21,573
I'll do everything you schedule.
I'll do everything you say.

658
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:24,281
I've never asked you
for a favor like this.

659
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:27,365
I met the person who posted the video
and got them to take it down.

660
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:31,543
The legal team is also taking down all
of the videos that are circulating online.

661
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:34,214
The reporters will stop
writing about it too.

662
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,631
I knew I could count on you!

663
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:38,802
Thank you.

664
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,968
(rustles)

665
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:47,518
(sighs deeply)

666
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,480
Gosh.

667
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:53,561
Hey.

668
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:55,556
Does that make you feel better?

669
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:56,858
My goodness.

670
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,775
I heard you handed over everything
when Ms. Hong came back.

671
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,243
It was hers to begin with anyway.

672
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:03,861
(sucks teeth)

673
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:07,368
It looks like something went on
behind the scenes anyhow.

674
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:08,541
(tongue clicks)

675
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:14,671
I think Cha Minhu and the VP made a deal.

676
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,920
-What do you...
-Gosh, you need to catch on quick.

677
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:22,465
Apparently, Mr. Cha planned everything out

678
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,885
so he could get Ms. Hong reinstated.

679
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:31,478
That's why you should choose
your allies wisely.

680
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:35,439
Ms. Jo tells me that all you do
is play second fiddle to Hong Yesool.

681
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:38,071
How much longer will you let her
take your rightful position?

682
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:41,029
Are you going to take a backseat
at Jeju Island too?

683
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:45,282
I just feel bad for you.
I feel so bad, you know?

684
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:49,332
I'm just saying this
because I care about you.

685
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,660
-Okay.
-Okay.

686
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:52,374
Take care, then.

687
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:54,455
(dramatic music)

688
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:04,382
Ms. Hong Yesool.

689
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:08,216
Mom. Give it to me.

690
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,184
I'm still young, you know.

691
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,810
You're off to Jeju Island
as soon as I came to visit you.

692
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:17,187
We're both so busy
we haven't even gotten a drink.

693
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:18,860
I know.

694
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:24,531
CHIEF CHA MINHU

695
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:28,951
What? Is that the guy who's busy
on the third weekend of every month?

696
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,870
Why aren't you answering?

697
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,332
Right.

698
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,826
You've got to ignore calls
from a man occasionally.

699
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,923
Sweetheart. Bring him to me.

700
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:44,924
I'm pretty picky
when it comes to men, you know.

701
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:48,007
Or next week,
bring him with you to my exhibition.

702
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,762
Mr. Kim's coming too.
Let's have dinner together.

703
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,599
It's okay. I'd rather not.

704
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:02,609
(suspenseful music)

705
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:05,864
What?

706
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,123
Oh, it's nothing.

707
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:10,238
Let's go inside.

708
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:13,867
(suspenseful music continues)

709
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:30,804
(line ringing)

710
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:33,096
AUTOMATED VOICE: <i>The person
you have reached is not available.</i>

711
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:37,385
(sighs deeply)

712
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:44,071
(cell phone vibrates)

713
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:47,532
MESSAGE
LEE PILYO

714
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:50,531
PILYO:
<i>Are you okay? In any case, I'm sorry.</i>

715
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,324
<i>Let's talk after the shoot is over.</i>

716
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,489
(exhales deeply)

717
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:01,002
MESSAGE
CHIEF CHA MINHU

718
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:02,423
MINHU: <i>Pick up.</i>

719
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:05,001
<i>It's all a misunderstanding.
I'll explain everything.</i>

720
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:11,180
(airplane engine rumbles)

721
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:15,507
(waves crashing)

722
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,808
(tranquil music)

723
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:23,016
JEJU INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

724
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,160
(Roma exclaims)

725
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:36,826
Even the air feels different
in Jeju Island.

726
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:37,951
Look at that sky.

727
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,117
<i>This is awesome.</i>

728
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:41,325
Are you moving here permanently
or something?

729
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:45,165
You'll learn how comfortable it is
to shoot inside a studio

730
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:46,502
after going through hell.

731
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:50,626
So, are the others not out yet?

732
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:54,392
They got here on a morning flight.

733
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:57,060
They probably escorted the clients
and went to pick up the vehicle

734
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:58,559
coming here by boat.

735
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:00,345
Ah...

736
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:09,741
We'll be shooting the wedding scene here,
the highlight of our commercial.

737
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:12,278
We'll use white and gold tomorrow

738
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:16,373
so that we can emphasize
the luxurious colors of the Mopix V9.

739
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:21,331
But...

740
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:24,291
I don't see our car.

741
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:27,955
The car was sent out yesterday afternoon
from the Mopix headquarters...

742
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:31,625
Are you saying you let someone
outside of the agency handle our vehicle?

743
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:33,262
Even after what happened?

744
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:36,054
That's not...

745
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:39,774
Ms. Hong told me to...

746
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:42,688
Of course, we made the personnel involved
in the transfer, embarkation,

747
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:44,978
and disembarkation
sign confidentiality agreements.

748
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:47,652
We're keeping everything secure
throughout the whole process.

749
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:50,071
All right, then.

750
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,147
MR. HAN SUNGHO

751
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:55,988
One moment, please.

752
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,333
Ms. Kim.

753
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,791
Isn't Ms. Hong in charge of this?

754
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:07,081
Yes, she left me in charge
and went to pick up the car herself.

755
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:17,680
EOMJI (in English): Okay!

756
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:20,009
Okay.

757
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,563
(in Korean)
Gosh. Sorry, it's so late.

758
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:28,686
(laughs)

759
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:32,572
I went through a lot of trouble
to keep it confidential.

760
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:35,031
Thank you. It looks like the car's fine.

761
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,323
PERSON IN CHARGE: HONG YESOOL

762
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:40,121
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

763
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,740
-Sure.
-Let's go.

764
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,041
(Eomji grunts)

765
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:54,971
(waves crashing)

766
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:59,638
I wish we could race through,
looking all cool.

767
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,810
(laughs)

768
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:05,179
If we get into an accident, you'd have to
take out the deposit for your apartment.

769
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:06,767
Come on, Yesool.

770
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:10,612
You're a first-rate killjoy.

771
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:14,740
Hey! You should be grateful to me.

772
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:17,147
Because Mr. Min hurt his leg,

773
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:20,117
you would've been stuck doing
the Production Team's work by yourself.

774
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:22,909
But I'm here helping you out.
Don't you know that?

775
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,663
I do.

776
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:27,865
I'm so thankful to you, my colleague.

777
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:30,626
That didn't sound genuine at all.
Do you even hear yourself?

778
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:34,209
-(cell phone vibrates)
-What's this?

779
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:37,216
MINHU: <i>Come on, let's talk.
How long are you going to avoid me?</i>

780
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:42,178
Damn. Hey.

781
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:44,972
You still haven't made up with Mr. Cha?

782
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,310
Gosh, no wonder.

783
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:50,099
I thought it was suspicious

784
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:53,067
when you should be escorting the client
along with Mr. Cha,

785
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:58,148
yet you left that to a junior AE
and came to pick up the car.

786
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:00,697
You know how quick I am
at picking up these things.

787
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:02,951
If you're so quick,

788
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:06,502
how come you haven't noticed
that I'm in a bad mood?

789
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:09,538
I'm just worried. That's all.

790
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:12,542
You've been ignoring Cha Minhu's calls,

791
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:15,456
reporting work-related things
over long text messages.

792
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:18,716
You've been volunteering to work off-site,
so you don't cross paths with him.

793
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:20,378
Am I wrong?

794
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:22,795
Are you stalking me, Eomji?

795
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:25,103
Were you watching me and not working?

796
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:28,350
I don't know what's going on,
but you should talk it out in person.

797
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:30,564
I don't know
if it's because of Lee Pilyo or not,

798
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:33,555
but just meet with him and talk it out.

799
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:37,686
Imagine how frustrating
it must be for Mr. Cha.

800
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:40,066
You know,
you can be really harsh sometimes.

801
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:44,414
Gosh, I wouldn't want to
date you, either. Dang.

802
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:45,741
Hey, look. Dolphins.

803
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:47,446
NO CALLER ID

804
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,960
(cell phone vibrates)

805
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:58,879
DAEHAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

806
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:17,438
What symptoms form the basis
for diagnosing a hydrocephalus patient?

807
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:19,534
Headache, vomiting, and papilledema, sir.

808
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:21,529
And the surgical method is?

809
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:24,912
Shunt, and drain the excessive CSF
into the peritoneal cavity.

810
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:28,615
What other surgery do you perform
in the case of an acute hydrocephalus

811
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:30,752
from a subdural hematoma
with tonic seizures?

812
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:34,667
Ah...

813
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:37,538
I'm not sure...

814
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:44,587
You're at the top of your class,
and you don't know that?

815
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:46,216
Tripping over a question like this?

816
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:50,429
I'll ask you again when we make
our next rounds. Be sure to study it.

817
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,020
(blows)

818
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:58,316
(playful music)

819
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,153
(sighs deeply)

820
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:14,788
(suspenseful music)

821
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:17,543
(grunting)
Who are you?

822
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:19,916
Wait. It's me. It's me, Pilyo.

823
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:21,545
Lee Pilyo?

824
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:23,589
(sighs deeply)

825
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:26,053
What are you doing in that thing?

826
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:27,722
What do you think?

827
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:31,933
It's in case someone records us again.
Think I want to cover up my handsome face?

828
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:35,935
Our shooting team
booked this entire place, so it's fine.

829
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:38,109
I'll take it off, then.

830
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,070
That feels better.

831
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:45,395
Why do you suddenly want
to edit the storyboard?

832
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:47,947
Don't you know
we're all set up for tomorrow?

833
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:49,161
I know.

834
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:52,371
But the only way I can meet you
is if it's for work.

835
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:53,950
Lee Pilyo.

836
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:55,907
We still have things to talk about.

837
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:58,708
But you just keep avoiding me.
What else am I supposed to do?

838
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:00,842
This is the only card I have.

839
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,053
We still have two dates left.

840
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:07,258
(light music)

841
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:10,222
-That's...
-I know.

842
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:13,519
You made that promise
before you started dating Cha Minhu.

843
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,429
Still, a promise is a promise.

844
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:19,231
Let's go on our second date
after we're done shooting tomorrow.

845
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:20,938
Are you crazy?

846
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:23,363
If you don't want to tell him,

847
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:25,322
I'll talk to Cha Minhu for you.

848
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:27,855
What are you going to tell him?

849
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:29,572
I'll tell him his girlfriend,

850
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:32,326
who's dating him
because she saw a happy future with him,

851
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:35,119
made a promise to meet with me twice,
so I hope he doesn't mind.

852
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:36,913
You are crazy, aren't you?

853
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,331
What's wrong?

854
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:40,747
Are you worried I might sway you?

855
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,260
Anyway, I'm going to meet with you,

856
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:50,052
and we're going to go on our second date.

857
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:53,885
Director Lee Pilyo.

858
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:56,642
You should turn in early if you want
to do well at the shoot tomorrow.

859
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:58,055
Please go inside.

860
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:01,403
See you tomorrow.

861
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:05,401
(light music)

862
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:08,856
(Seungtaek sighs)

863
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:11,067
(tongue clicks)

864
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:14,411
DOCTOR: Did you call for me?

865
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:17,794
Hey. How is Ban Howoo?

866
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:19,081
Pardon?

867
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:20,498
Ban Howoo?

868
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:23,424
The one who's at top of her class?

869
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:27,342
Do you think she ran away
because I yelled at her earlier?

870
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:29,384
Is she crying in a corner somewhere?

871
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:30,506
No.

872
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:32,466
She was eating just fine.

873
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:35,761
-What?
-I just saw her at the cafeteria.

874
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:38,177
She had some chicken piled up
in a bowl with a bunch of sausages

875
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:40,976
and chicken skewered on a chopstick
and was scarfing it down.

876
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:42,601
What?

877
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,730
-(indistinct chatter)
-STUDENT 1: Let me have one.

878
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,476
-Come on.
-STUDENT 2: Why are you eating so much?

879
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:48,987
I should eat this much to refuel.

880
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:51,743
It's so good.

881
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:54,872
She's going to eat that much chicken
at a time like this?

882
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:59,075
A vegan? What a joke.

883
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:01,042
This place has amazing chicken.

884
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:03,290
(grunts)

885
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:06,127
Come on.

886
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:08,511
-Are you eating for two?
-I have to go for seconds after this.

887
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:10,088
(sighs)
I must've been crazy.

888
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:12,803
I was crazy for worrying about her.

889
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:16,264
What's there to like about a girl
who's got a screw loose?

890
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:18,933
Fine, I'm going to forget about her.

891
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:22,136
I have women lined up wanting to date me.

892
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:26,017
Let's see how far this goes,
Ban Howoo. Dang it.

893
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:29,067
(exhales deeply)

894
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:34,702
Howoo, I won't disturb
your studies at all.

895
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:39,622
I'm just, you know,
a fidgeting application on your phone.

896
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:40,793
Just think of me like that.

897
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:45,628
You're human too.
So you won't be studying 24/7, right?

898
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,129
I know because I've been there.

899
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:48,840
If all you do is study, you know,

900
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,340
your head goes a little crazy.

901
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:53,339
Doctor.

902
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:55,505
Could you please get to the point?

903
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:58,014
You acting like this is interfering
with what I'm doing.

904
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:01,807
Sorry. Then I'll make it short
and get to the point real quick.

905
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:02,812
So listen up.

906
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:05,103
I'm sure you want to grab a bite
and go out to the movies

907
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:06,307
when you're studying.

908
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:07,936
And waiting for a taxi gets boring.

909
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:10,403
Call me then. Just call me.
No, I'll drive you.

910
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,280
So, what you're saying is that

911
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:15,321
you'll be my emergency response team.

912
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:16,315
Is that it?

913
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:17,946
You're so smart. You get it right away.

914
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,623
When you're struggling with your studies,

915
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:22,451
or when your seniors
are giving you a hard time, call me.

916
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:23,367
Just call me.

917
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:25,665
You need someone to talk to, Howoo.

918
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:29,917
So, you'll do all that
without anything in return?

919
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:32,344
Of course!

920
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:35,261
I'll think about it.

921
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:39,387
Sure, Howoo. Think about it.
Give it some thought.

922
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:41,311
Go and study now. Hurry, study.

923
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:42,813
Study hard!

924
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:46,098
OLLE TRAIL

925
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:48,686
Hold on. I said this before...

926
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:51,482
I said this before,

927
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:52,976
but I'll say it again.

928
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:54,778
Let me say this one more time.

929
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:56,911
-Because I don't like to be a fuddy-duddy.
-Damn it.

930
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:58,778
But I just feel so emotional right now.

931
00:51:59,991 --> 00:52:01,871
-He's nuts.
-I...

932
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:04,370
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

933
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:06,464
(all cheer)

934
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:12,004
SANGGOO: Everyone, clap!

935
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:16,089
Hey, Let's play a game!

936
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:19,005
There you go again.

937
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:21,854
ALL: <i>♪ Boom boom clap, boom boom clap ♪</i>

938
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:24,470
<i>♪ Thump thump thump, thump thump thump ♪</i>

939
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:47,212
YANG: <i>This is Detective Yang
from Homicide Division 2.</i>

940
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:48,539
<i>We got the culprit.</i>

941
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:49,833
You got the culprit?

942
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:54,456
Yes. He says he didn't
break into residence number 130.

943
00:52:54,796 --> 00:52:57,916
<i>But that's the usual excuse that they use.</i>

944
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:02,178
They tend to lie about these things
to lessen their sentence.

945
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:04,892
<i>But if we investigate,
everything will come out.</i>

946
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:06,183
So don't worry about it, sir.

947
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:10,022
By chance, could you tell me
how tall the culprit is?

948
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:14,404
I think he's well over 180 cm tall.

949
00:53:14,482 --> 00:53:15,692
Right.

950
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:17,935
He looks a bit different
from the description you gave.

951
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:22,737
You could've made a mistake
because you were preoccupied.

952
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:24,485
All right.

953
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:27,996
Please let me know
if you find anything unusual

954
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:30,869
-as you're conducting your investigation.
<i>-Okay, I will.</i>

955
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:33,167
(suspenseful music)

956
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:40,546
JIYOUNG:
<i>Minhu, meet me on the first floor.</i>

957
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:44,892
SARA: <i>Hey, darling.</i>

958
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:46,771
Did you take the picture of your dad
from home?

959
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:48,018
Dad's picture?

960
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:50,809
Why would I take that?

961
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:52,314
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

962
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:54,185
The picture is missing from the frame.

963
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:56,022
Why would the picture disappear?

964
00:53:57,859 --> 00:53:59,359
Look for it carefully.

965
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:00,534
I'm hanging up.

966
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:07,492
What did I do wrong?

967
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:09,537
Why do I have to explain myself?

968
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,500
You really don't know?

969
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:15,134
Is this because of Hong Yesool?

970
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:20,218
I shot a movie all night,
and just got here on a night flight.

971
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:21,468
Must you do this to me?

972
00:54:24,302 --> 00:54:26,972
I was just worried about you.

973
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:30,135
And, if you still haven't told her
about you,

974
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:32,225
that's the extent
of your feelings for her.

975
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:36,943
Are you sure your symptoms get better
when you kiss someone if Hong Yesool

976
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:38,404
is nearby?

977
00:54:38,483 --> 00:54:40,113
Are you sure
you weren't just imagining it?

978
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:43,453
Regardless,
who are you to tell Hong Yesool that?

979
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,454
"Who do you think you are?"

980
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:50,656
How can you say that to me?

981
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:54,575
Minhu, it sounds like
you'll never see me again

982
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:57,418
if I say one more thing to Hong Yesool.

983
00:54:57,502 --> 00:54:59,462
Yes, I won't see you again.

984
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:00,666
What?

985
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:03,625
If you say something stupid
to Yesool one more time,

986
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:05,637
I won't ever see you again.

987
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:07,429
I'll be the one to tell her about it.

988
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:10,097
I don't need you
to worry about me anymore.

989
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:12,141
This is my last warning.

990
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:14,228
Warning?

991
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:17,401
This is the last time I let it slide
for Dr. Oh's sake.

992
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:21,399
You were attracted to Hong Yesool

993
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:23,565
because she eases your pain, right?

994
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:27,531
Are you sure about that, though?
It might not be the case.

995
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:36,787
Hey! Oh Jiyoung.

996
00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:47,339
Hong Yesool!

997
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:49,301
(grunts)

998
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:54,018
Minhu! Are you okay?

999
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:57,403
(dramatic music)

1000
00:55:58,730 --> 00:55:59,980
MINHU: Hey, Hong Yesool.

1001
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:05,819
Hong Yesool. Wait. Talk to me.

1002
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:08,655
Let's talk later.

1003
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,080
Later when?

1004
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:12,538
You've been ignoring my calls and texts.

1005
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:14,998
Then what should I say in this situation?

1006
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:17,205
I'll explain everything.

1007
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:19,170
Including what I couldn't tell you
last time.

1008
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:20,210
I don't want to hear it.

1009
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:23,592
What more do I need to hear
when I've seen it with my own eyes?

1010
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:26,591
It's a misunderstanding.
I told you, I can explain everything.

1011
00:56:26,674 --> 00:56:27,684
I don't want to hear it!

1012
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:31,847
I don't care if you told Oh Jiyoung
about me or not,

1013
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:34,060
or if something is going on
between you two.

1014
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:36,936
-What?
-It's for the best anyway.

1015
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:40,613
I don't think things will work out
between us anyway.

1016
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:48,531
Is it because of Lee Pilyo?

1017
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:50,243
(pants)

1018
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:52,583
Why would you bring him up right now?

1019
00:56:52,992 --> 00:56:54,162
He got to you, didn't he?

1020
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:58,084
Isn't that why
you couldn't answer him earlier

1021
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:00,211
when he asked if you were swayed?

1022
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:02,708
What?

1023
00:57:03,878 --> 00:57:06,918
Were you eavesdropping on us?

1024
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:08,216
That's not important right now.

1025
00:57:08,883 --> 00:57:12,513
Isn't it more important
that you let him get to you like that?

1026
00:57:14,722 --> 00:57:16,562
Do you think I've been swayed?

1027
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:19,394
Weren't you?

1028
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:23,106
Yes.

1029
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:24,733
I was.

1030
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:27,072
So...

1031
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:30,527
let's just end it here.

1032
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:33,703
I think we need to reconsider

1033
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:36,241
pursuing a relationship.

1034
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:40,000
(somber music)

1035
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:53,342
(panting)

1036
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:24,375
(panting continues)

1037
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:27,627
(foreboding music)

1038
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:45,898
(singing)
<i>♪ Oh my life ♪</i>

1039
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:47,606
Hey.

1040
00:58:48,566 --> 00:58:49,816
I've returned.

1041
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:52,993
I am so...

1042
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:57,033
(groans)

1043
00:58:57,784 --> 00:58:59,794
(Eomji laughs)

1044
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:02,963
Hey.

1045
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,039
Let's

1046
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:06,456
only work with the movie team.

1047
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:07,963
Those guys are...

1048
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:09,416
(sniffs)

1049
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:11,054
Really.

1050
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:14,090
They're... very hip.

1051
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:16,795
(panting)

1052
00:59:19,764 --> 00:59:22,644
They drink really well too.

1053
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:25,647
They're young.

1054
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:28,231
And...

1055
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:31,820
so handsome!

1056
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:33,821
(laughs)

1057
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:37,369
Are you asleep?

1058
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:39,622
You took off during dinner again.

1059
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:43,746
So petty. Are you sleeping?

1060
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:44,790
Dang it.

1061
00:59:45,206 --> 00:59:47,206
Come on! Are you asleep?

1062
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:50,586
Hey.

1063
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:57,389
Where is she?

1064
00:59:58,303 --> 01:00:01,013
This must not be the right room.

1065
01:00:04,475 --> 01:00:06,685
(foreboding music)

1066
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:15,860
<i>Is that girl Hong Yesool
with Mr. Cha right now?</i>

1067
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:20,407
<i>I was going to have just one drink.</i>

1068
01:00:20,491 --> 01:00:22,371
<i>Does she realize the time?</i>

1069
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:25,712
<i>I'm so jealous.</i>

1070
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:26,828
(door closes)

1071
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:35,472
MINHU: Ms. Jang!

1072
01:00:39,218 --> 01:00:40,218
Did something happen?

1073
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:42,809
By any chance,

1074
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:45,346
are you with Yesool right now?

1075
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:46,853
Isn't she in her room?

1076
01:00:46,934 --> 01:00:48,194
No, she's not.

1077
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:50,941
And she's not picking up, either.

1078
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:53,938
You were with her, weren't you?

1079
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:55,654
You look suspicious.

1080
01:00:58,196 --> 01:00:59,946
Yes, he was. I was right.

1081
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:01,781
(laughs)

1082
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,869
(panting)

1083
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:11,168
(foreboding music)

1084
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:17,381
(panting continues)

1085
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:32,311
(foreboding music continues)

1086
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:45,701
("You Make Me" playing)

1087
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:50,539
(finger snaps)

1088
01:01:58,297 --> 01:02:00,547
("You Make Me" continues playing)

1089
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:11,392
(panting)

1090
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,230
HONG YESOOL

1091
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:19,145
(panting continues)

1092
01:02:25,283 --> 01:02:27,493
(ominous music)

1093
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:34,711
("You Make Me" playing)

1094
01:02:34,792 --> 01:02:36,592
BLUETOOTH AUDIO

1095
01:02:42,675 --> 01:02:45,085
(panting)

1096
01:03:21,005 --> 01:03:22,335
What the heck?

1097
01:03:22,715 --> 01:03:23,795
(car horn honks)

1098
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:33,021
CHIEF CHA MINHU
MISSED CALL

1099
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:36,564
(sighs deeply)

1100
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:39,323

(panting)

1102
01:04:04,924 --> 01:04:06,934
(grunting)

1103
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:15,808
(panting continues)

1104
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:35,828
