A violent incident like what happened yesterday

7
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,200
must be avoided in the future.

8
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,200
You, as coaches,

9
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,600
need to be more hands-on

10
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,400
and pay attention to your athletes,

11
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,900
particularly Duan Yu Cheng.

12
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,000
Recently, his performance has improved massively.

13
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,400
I think he has the best chance

14
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,600
of making it to the national team.

15
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,700
After Chinese New Year,

16
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,400
the school will start closed-door training

17
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,000
to prepare for the National Athletics Championships.

18
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,400
My suggestion is that Duan Yu Cheng has to participate

19
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,400
and improve his scores.

20
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,200
But his situation is a little special.

21
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,000
He's not yet a professional athlete.

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,400
He must be under a lot of pressure from both training and studies.

23
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,200
Hence, there must be a balance

24
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,500
among personal life, studies, and training.

25
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,900
Make sure there's no mishap.

26
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,700
Got it?

27
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,000

Step outside while I talk to her alone.

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,800
Did you understand me or not?

30
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,400
Why are you asking me that?

31
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,000
You should speak to Coach Yang Jin.

32
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,400
Coach Yang is in charge of hardware problems.

33
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,300
You're in charge of the software.

34
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,400
Didn't he switch to decathlon because of your suggestion?

35
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,800
What happened after?

36
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,500
Spurt! He soared up like an eagle!

37
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,400
If he manages to get a medal at Nationals,

38
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,000
wouldn't that make you happy, too?

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,800
So all the more reason for you

40
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,600
to heed all aspects of his life.

41
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,000
You show the most care for him.

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,200
Don't all coaches pay attention to their athletes?

43
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,200
No, not at all.

44
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,800
It's normal to be biased.

45
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,200
The training will last for more than a month.

46
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,400
He's a sophomore.

47
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,800
His studies are quite hectic.

48
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,800
If his professors are willing to let him take part,

49
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,700
you must negotiate with them.

50
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,100
Of course,

51
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,000
his and his family's opinions are the most important.

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,200
If he decides

53
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,700
to take part in the National Athletics Championships

54
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,800
and wishes to work toward joining the national team,

55
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,000
it's inevitable for him to turn professional in these few years.

56
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,000
How about this?

57
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,600
I've spoken to Coach Yang Jin.

58
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,400
He'll let him take the afternoon off.

59
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,000
Use the time to counsel him.

60
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,600
Don't just keep quiet.

61
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,200

are you going to fail without trying?

68
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,600
It's not that I'm prejudiced against athletes.

69
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,200
We have to look at the bigger picture.

70

Look.

71
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,500
Aside from those athletes at the top of the pyramid,

72
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,800
you should know better than I do

you're not a professional athlete.

84
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,400
Even if I devote these few years to sports,

85
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,200
after I retire,

86
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,500
I can still retain my student status and continue my studies.

I'm confident in myself.

I believe that no matter when I choose to start studying,

89

I wouldn't be worse than the others.

00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,100
♫ And I'm thinking every second, every day, about the way that you're feeling ♫

172
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,300
Coach Luo!

173
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:25,000
♫ How perfect you just might be ♫

174
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
♫ How can something so small become the biggest ♫

175
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
♫ The biggest part of me ♫

176
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,400
♫ How precious you will always be ♫

177
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,100
♫ Because now until forever ♫

178
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:48,000
♫ You'll be the biggest, the biggest part of me ♫

179
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,000
♫ When you're grown and I've lost my head ♫

180
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:02,000
♫ I'll be the one that you run to again when you're feeling scared ♫

181
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,800
♫ So every bump in the night ♫

182
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:11,000
♫ Every monster I'll fight, standing guard by your door ♫

♫ Don't be scared any more ♫

184
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,200
♫ Don't be scared any more ♫

185
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:24,000
♫ Because I lie awake at night, and I listen to your breathing ♫

186

♫ And I'm thinking every second, every day, about the way that you're feeling ♫

♫ The biggest part of me ♫

190
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,800
Why did you run away?

191
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,000
Did you run all the way here?

192
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,600
It was only 1000 meters (0.6 mile).

193
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,800
It only took a few minutes.

194
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,200
You're my coach.

195
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,200
You should know my records better than I do.

196
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,800
What exactly do you want?

197
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,400
Tell me why you ran away first.

198
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,400
My limbs needed some exercise.

199
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,200
I can't believe such a lame excuse.

200
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,300
Enough is enough, Duan Yu Cheng.

201
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,400
Enough of what?

202
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,000
Everything.

203
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,500
Focus on your studies and training.

204
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,000
Don't see me for a while.

205
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,400
And stop thinking about this nonsense.

206
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,100
- But I...
- Just do as I say.

207
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,600
Don't look at me.

208
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,700
Sit farther away.

209
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,000
Farther.

210
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,800
Did he call you?

211
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,900
Yes.

212
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:40,700
His parents think the training would disrupt his studies.

213
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,000
Could you visit his home

214
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,600
and try to persuade his parents?

215
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm not going.

216
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,500
Why?

217
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,400
There's no "why."

218
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,200
I want to celebrate Chinese New Year.

219
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,800
You stay in the dorm and eat instant noodles on Chinese New Year's Eve.

220
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,800
Just say if you want extra allowance.

221
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,000
It's not about money.

222
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,600
"The coach is an athlete's support pillar."

223
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,100
Isn't that what you said?

224
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,400
Besides,

225
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,400
you recruited him onto the team.

226
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,100
He already overcame many hurdles.

227
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,100
Light at the end of the tunnel is right there.

228
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,800
And you calling it quits now?

229
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,500
I'm not going anywhere.

230
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,600
Book the ticket now.

231
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,000
Tickets are scarce at Chinese New Year.

232
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,800
That darn boy.

233
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,400
He just won't give up.

[Winter, 2016]

240

Who is it?

241
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,100
It's me.

242
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,100
Let it be. No need to clean up.

243
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,400
It's not my first time here.

244
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,970
Hi.

245
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,400
That took a while.

246
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,800
Did you finish tidying?

247
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,000
"Tidying"? I was working.

248
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,600
It smells nice.

249
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I want to eat, too.

250
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,600
There's no more.

251
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,200
Okay.

252
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,800
So when are you free?

253
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,100
Free to do what?

254
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:51,000
- To go home with me to see my parents.
- What?

255
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,200
Why?

256
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,800
Didn't Director Wang inform you?

257
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,600
Right.

258
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,100
He told me.

259
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,800
I am supposed to see your parents.

260
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,400
Director Wang said

261
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,400
I should meet them

262
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,900
and discuss your situation.

263
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,500
When are you going home?

264
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,000
Me? Anytime is fine.

265
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
It's up to you.

266
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,700
Then I'll book the tickets.

267
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,200
The trip

268
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,600
will first require a bus then a boat.

269
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,400
It will take half a day.

270
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,000
Something smells good.

271
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,400
I told you it was your wontons.

272
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,500
But you wouldn't share.

273
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,400
It's not that.

274
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,000
I put on cologne.

275
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,700
Does it smell good?

276
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,200
Don't you have an exam?

277
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,600
Why did you put on cologne?

278
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,400
I sprayed it for you.

279
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,200
It smells good.

280
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,300
Go sit down.

281
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,200
If you don't like it,

282
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,500
I won't use it again.

283
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,000
I didn't say I don't like it.

284
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,400
I can't believe you're eating my instant noodles.

285
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,800
Listen, Wu Ze.

286
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,800
Under your leadership, the sprint team

287
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,000
has lost two members in the past year.

288
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,800
You're about to become a commander without an army!

289
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,500
Now you're adding a gangster to the team.

290
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,400
Do you expect me to convince higher-ups for him?

291
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,500
I'm telling you, "No way!"

292
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Don't you have anything to say?

293
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,800
Have you made up your mind about that delinquent?

294
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,000
You think he'll bring you good results.

295
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
What's his name?

296
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,600
Li Ge, is it?

297
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,200
Only heroes recognize other heroes, right?

298
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,900
I'm open-minded, though.

299
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,000
I believe in one thing.

300
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,400
An athlete speaks with results.

301
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,300
Write a letter of guarantee.

302
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,700
Okay.

303
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,400
There's only one egg.

304
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,200
I must have owed you in my past life.

305
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,400
Something nice?

306
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,800
What is it?

307
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,400
Join the track and field team?

308
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,600
No, thanks.

309
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,200
Too late.

310
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,600
From today onward, you’ll be managed by me.

311
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,900
Starting tomorrow,

312
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,400
you'll officially join the team to train.

313
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,000
If I knew this earlier,

314
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I wouldn't have raced that guy!

315
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,100
Get someone else who loves to run.

316
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,100
I'm not interested.

317
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,200
Get someone who loves to run.

318
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,500
I'm not running!

319
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,200
- Go.
- I refuse to run.

320
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,000
Go!

321
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,400
Go and apologize.

322
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,100
Go! You're stubborn as an ox.

323
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,600
This must be karma.

324
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,700
Okay.

325
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,000
Then pay up.

326
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,600
For Jiang Tian's medical bills

327
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,500
and the shop's damage fees:

328
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,000
total ¥30,000 ($4,300).

329
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I rounded it up for you.

330
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Give me three months.

331
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,800
No, half a year.

332
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,500
I'll get the money to pay you.

333
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,800
Then just run for half a year.

334
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,900
No one does it your way!

335
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,200
You made a bet with me and lost.

336
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,600
Now you take back your words?

337
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,000
Are you even a man?

338
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,900
Loser.

339
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,200
Who are you calling "Loser"?

340
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,000
I, Li Ge, never go back on my word.

341
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,400
Fine!

342
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,000
I'll run.

343
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,000
Not only will you run,

344
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,400
but you will run like the wind.

345
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,000
What are you doing?

346
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,700
Let me go. Where are you taking me?

347
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,200
The booking is successful.

348
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,200
The bus is at noon on Saturday.

349
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,800
Then we'll take the boat.

350
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,800
We'll reach home around 7 p.m.

351
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,800
What do your parents like?

352
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,800
"What do they like"? Why?

353
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,200
Director Wang said I should bring some gifts.

354
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,200
"Bring gifts"?

355
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,600
That's thoughtful, but it's not necessary.

356
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,800
Just answer the question.

357
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,000
My dad likes cars.

358
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,600
My mom likes jewelry. Are you gifting these?

359
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,900
Cancel the ticket.

360
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,500
Don't.

361
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,800
I think you could just buy my dad two bottles of wine

362
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,500
and bring some cosmetics for my mom.

363
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,400
That will do.

364
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,000
What brands does your mom like?

365
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
She doesn't like brands.

366
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
She thinks those chemical products are harmful to the skin.

367
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
She's so hard to please.

368
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,500
So what does she like?

369
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,600
Self-made facial masks.

370
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,700
Just cancel my ticket.

371
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,200
It's not a big deal. I can teach you.

372
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,500
No way. I can't do it.

373
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,200
I can teach you. I...

374
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,800
All right. I can do it, okay?

375
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,800
Fine, you do it.

376
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,000
On the condition

377
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,900
that you'll accompany me to buy the ingredients.

378
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,400
- I have a meeting this afternoon.
- No.

379
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,700
No, you don't.

380
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,800
Fine, I don't.

381
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,100
But I have something else to do.

382
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,100
You can go by yourself.

383
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,500
What?

384
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,600
Is this how you treat me after so long?

385
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,500
So what?

386
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,400
You're chasing me away.

387
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,000
Just go buy them with me.

388
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,600
You can pick the scent you like.

389
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,600
For instance, maybe you like

390
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,900
aloe vera,

391
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,000
banana, apple,

392
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
strawberry, or

393
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,700
- durian?
- I like Laotan pickled cabbage.

394
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,800
Just go.

395
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,100
Laotan pickled cabbage is new to me,

396
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,600
but it might work.

397
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,800
- Trust me.
- Hurry.

398
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,300
Let's have dinner tonight then.

399
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,500
I have a date tonight.

400
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,600
A date again?

401
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,800
Look me in the eye and say you have a date.

402
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,000
I don't want to look.

403
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,700
- Quickly go.
- I...

404
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,000
Hurry!

405
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,600
Fine, I'll leave.

406
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,100
At least, let me...

407
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:53,400
Why do you look like a walking corpse?

408
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,000
You can't force the Li Ge matter.

409
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,800
You need to slowly convince Director Wang.

410
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,500
He has agreed.

411
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,600
I thought he would at least keep you at bay for a bit.

412
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,000
Did you make a deal or something?

413
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,800
I wrote a letter of guarantee

414
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,200
to make sure Li Ge gets a medal at Nationals.

415
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,700
Otherwise,

416
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,600
I must quit with him.

417
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,000
Did you have to go that far?

418
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,400
It's Nationals we're talking about.

419
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,900
Li Ge can't even outrun Duan Yu Cheng.

420
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,200
How will he win?

421
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,400
He can beat him now.

422
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,500
He can run faster than Duan Yu Cheng now.

423
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,200
I just wanted to prove myself to Director Wang.

424
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,200
He always complains I'm dead weight for the team,

425
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,800
that I can't make a champion.

426
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,400
So I'll make Li Ge a champion and show him.

427
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,200
Li Ge, that brat...

428
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,000
He's too wild.

429
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,800
Help me keep an eye on him.

430
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,400
Sure.

431
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,400
Anyway,

432
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,400
I'm going to Duan Yu Cheng's home this weekend.

433
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,700
What for?

434
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,600
Director Wang said I should talk to his parents

435
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,000
about his future professional career.

436
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
What is there to discuss?

437
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,000
Take it easy.

438
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,900
You should have picked me.

439
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,400
What?

440
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,000
I'm not an idiot.

441
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,700
Do you think I can't tell?

442
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,000
Am I that unappealing?

443
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,400
Must I choose between you and him?

444
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,900
Not really.

445
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,200
There are also...

446
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,300
Old Yang, Old Wang, Xiao Gao.

447
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,600
Hold on.

448
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,900
Speak of the devil.

449
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,500
Is he gone?

450
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,200
Take a look.

451
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,900
He's gone.

452
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,000
[So you did have a date.]

453
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,400
[You should have lied to me.]

454
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,900
Morning.

455
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,600
What is it?

456
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,800
Nothing.

457
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,200
I think you look nice today.

458
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,800
I will meet your parents

459
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,000
on behalf of the university's track and field team.

460
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,500
I can't disgrace the school.

461
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,600
Come on. Let's go eat first.

462
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,600
Did you put on makeup

463
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,100
because you're meeting me?

464
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,100
Duan Yu Cheng!

465
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,000
What should we eat?

466
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,000
Crayfish...

467
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:53,200
that you remove the shell and shove straight into my mouth.

468
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,800
I'll get angry if you continue this nonsense.

469
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,000
What's in that bag?

470
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,300
Facial masks.

471
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,700
- Did you make them?
- Yes.

472
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,600
You can choose first when we arrive.

473
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,800
Leave the rest in the fridge for my mom.

474
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,000
It's okay.

475
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,200
Give them all to your mom.

476
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,200
No.

477
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,200
You must use them.

478
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,400
Otherwise, you wouldn't know

479
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,000
how I felt when I was making them.

480
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,700
Must I consider your feelings while using the masks?

481
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,400
Of course.

482
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,600
You'll know when you use one.

483
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,300
What's on your mind?

484
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,200
Nothing.

485
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,400
Won't you tell me?

486
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,800
Why ask if you know I won't tell?

487
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,700
Then I won't ask.

488
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,400
Since I know you're thinking of me.

489
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,000
Duan Yu Cheng!

490
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,500
What?

491
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,800
Fine, I'll stop.

492
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,900
You stop, too.

493
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,900
No.

494
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,400
That's autocratic (bossy).

495
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,400
I'm not joking with you.

496
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,200
We're going to your home to meet your parents.

497
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,500
It's serious business.

498
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,800
Please reign in

499
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,400
your imaginary affection.

500
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,600
You don't want your parents to kick me out, do you?

501
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,600
"Imaginary"?

502
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,200
Fine.

503
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,000
I let you hurt my feelings once a day.

504
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
But you've met your quota for today.

505
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,200
You can't hurt me again.

506
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,900
Enough talk.

507
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,200
Eat the crayfish.

508
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,500
Why can't you understand what I said?

509
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,040
Who said I don't understand?

510
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,570
If I make you feel uncomfortable,

511
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:44,300
perhaps I didn't express it properly.

512
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,820
But that is not my intention.

513
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:53,310
So please also respect my affection.

514
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:55,540
It's fine that you don't like me.

515
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,470
But don't belittle how I feel.

516
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:00,690
That will only make me sad.

517
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:08,990
And I don't believe for one second that you don't like me.

518
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,360
I'm not belittling you.

519
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,460
I just think that

520
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:25,540
now isn't time for you to think about such things.

521
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:28,090
That's up to me to decide.

522
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,810
Just don't show favoritism.

523
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:31,420
What "favoritism"?

524
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,820
Wu Ze.

525
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,970
He likes you, too, doesn't he?

526
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:37,040
You haven't accepted him, right?

527
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,360
Both of us were rejected by you.

528
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,640
Why did you gladly eat crayfish he shelled for you?

529
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,290
You won't even look at the crayfish I shelled.

530
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:46,820
We were discussing a serious matter.

531
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,430
Li Ge is joining the track and field team.

532
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:52,060
Okay. Who recruited him?

533
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,980
Also, I was beaten up by him.

534
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:56,840
Did you forget that already?

535
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,560
Are you a Scorpio?

536
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,110
Pisces.

537
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:03,400
That's why you're a crybaby.

538
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:07,130
Who's a crybaby? You cry more.

539
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:09,220
I'm tough.

540
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,670
All right. It's almost time. Let's go.

541
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:17,950
Not yet.

542
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:20,080
You haven't eaten the crayfish.

543
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,080
I'll eat.

544
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,890
Give me your identification card.

545
00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:45,960
I'll get the ticket for you.

546
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,750
Where's my identification card?

547
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:54,220
What is it?

548
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,680
Where is it?

549
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,420
I don't know.

550
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:01,420
I saw you put it in your pocket with your phone.

551
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:05,020
Yes, I'm sure I brought it.

552
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,280
You kept reminding me to bring things.

553
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,430
But you forgot your own identification card.

554
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:11,420
Did you leave it behind at the restaurant?

555
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,350
No way.

556
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:15,990
There's no time.

557
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:20,250
- Then I'll check the restaurant. Go first. I'll take the next bus.
- Hey.

558
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,040
Thank you.

559
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,520
Got it.

560
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,940
Let's go.

561
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,220
What's the hurry?

562
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,920
There's only one boat in the afternoon.

563
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,330
If we miss both the bus and boat, will we sleep at the pier?

564
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:45,770
We just need to be on time for the boat.

565
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:48,960
Reign in your imaginary emotions.

566
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,920
This is not the time to bicker with me.

567
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,610
Hurry.

568
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,840
Hey...

569
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:05,670
Is she really 8 years older?

570
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:06,920
Don't move.

571
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,340
I'll do it. Give it to me.

572
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,840
Did you forget anything?

573
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,150
What? I have my identification card.

574
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,970
And your phone?

575
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:20,820
It's over there.

576
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:23,890
Just kidding, I have it.

577
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,220
Hurry up.

578
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,400
Faster! Is it too heavy?

579
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,720
No, I can handle it.

580
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,840
Come on, hurry. We won’t make it.

581
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,960
No need to rush.

582
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:28,360
Hurry. Why do you look stunned?

583
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:09,690
Did you lose something again?

584
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:27,400
You look nicer with your hair down.

585
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:34,220
♫ I never waste my energy on anything else ♫

586
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:39,360
♫ Because protecting you is my priority ♫

587
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,080
That's why I said

588
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,400
there's no need to rush.

589
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,610
We made it with time to spare.

590
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:50,740
Are you always so last-minute?

591
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:53,490
I know the boat's schedule.

592
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:58,600
I've never missed it.

593
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:01,790
Fine.

594
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:03,830
I was wrong today.

595
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,960
I guess you're quite reliable.

596
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,330
I'm always reliable.

597
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:11,630
You just didn't realize.

598
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:16,270
♫ Because we were born with chemistry between us ♫

599
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:21,950
♫ I'll be thinking of you ♫

600
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:26,610
♫ No matter the weather, no matter where we are  ♫

601
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:29,750
♫ Because it's an open secret ♫

602
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:34,450
♫ I'll be thinking of you ♫

603
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:37,180
♫ There is no reason ♫

604
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:43,790
♫ Because you're irreplaceable, a smile will turn misty in the sunshine ♫

605
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:50,560
Do you like the smell of the ocean?

606
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,860
It's not too bad.

607
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,210
I like it a lot.

608
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,240
Have you always lived on the island?

609
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:07,440
That's quite nice.

610
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,390
Have you been to the seaside?

611
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,040
Of course.

612
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,110
But the beach there is different.

613
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,090
You'll much prefer the sea there.

614
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:22,760
You'll know once you get there.

615
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:27,430
♫ I'll be thinking of you ♫

616
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:32,140
♫ I don't need a reason because it's you ♫

617
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:37,360
♫ You'll decide whether a cloudy day becomes sunny ♫

618
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:49,220
♫ Sunrise captures the silhouette of the island, while shadows dance across the tides ♫

619
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:53,150
♫ The waves chase after the footprints, breathing them in ♫

620
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:56,870
♫ I want to follow you; let the sun melt the distance between us ♫

621
00:40:56,870 --> 00:41:00,800
♫ I'm faltering in my steps; I won't be too greedy ♫

622
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,900
♫ The breeze shares with me a secret ♫

623
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,850
♫ You can't hide your scent from me ♫

624
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:06,800
♫ We are stuck together ♫

625
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,450
♫ After the heavy rain's evaporation ♫

626
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:10,600
♫ The convenience store blasts with cold air ♫

♫ But we are still sweating bullets ♫

628

♫ Stop checking your phone all the time ♫

629
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,820
♫ And pretending that you don't care about me ♫

630
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:20,550
♫ For me, summer is not just about ♫

631
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:24,520
♫ Carbonated drinks and jerseys ♫

♫ With clear and transparent courage ♫

♫ This passion will burn forever ♫

636
