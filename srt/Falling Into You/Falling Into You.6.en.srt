Now that his student made a name for himself,

169
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,600
I guess he has shut Director Wang up.

170
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,300
Listen, right now, Coach Wu must be thinking to himself

171
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,800
that he finally muddled through.

172
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,200
A coach and his student are just like a father and his son.

173
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,600
I don't think so.

174
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,800
Coach Wu isn't that old.

175
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,700
If so, they're brothers.

176
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:04,200
Since Coach Wu can become brothers with his student,

177
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,200
why don't you allow me to call you Sister?

178
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,400
I'm your coach!

I'll help you relax before the competition.

185
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,300
Do you wish to train your foundation or your strength?

186
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,200
Don't you believe in me?

187
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,050
That's not it.

188
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:52,320
Director Wang fears you'll be nervous in your first major competition.

189
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,950
He wants me to help you relax.

190
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,930
The best way to relax is to train.

191
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:00,079
This way, you'll feel at ease.

192

I already feel at ease.

Besides, even if I want to relax, I won't do it here.

194

Where do you want to go then?

What is he doing here?

200
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,200
I guess he is here to spectate.

201
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,050
All right. You're not allowed to focus on them.

What do you think?

Don't tell me Jiang Tian is here to see Duan Yu Cheng make a joke of himself?

What? Do you plan to ask Director Wang to reimburse you?

Forget it.

229
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:31,359
Director Wang would nag me for half a month

00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,020
Coach, I'll get going.

334
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,050
Do your best.

335
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,360
He is good at everything.

336
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,140
It's just that he's short.

337
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,530
Shut up!

338
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:58,420
You can do it!

339
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:02,020
You can do it!

340
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:09,060
We can usually tell the athlete's state from his first jump.

341
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,020
Just shut up!

342
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,879
Duan Yu Cheng, first attempt at 1.95 meters.

343
00:20:14,879 --> 00:20:17,490
Xiao Zhi Guo, get ready.

344
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:21,230
Candidate No. 1273 from South Lake University, freshman, Duan Yu Cheng.

345
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:23,390
This is his first time joining the university provincial games

346
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,029
and he made it into the finals without a hitch.

347
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:28,459
The 1.95 m is his starting height.

348
00:20:28,459 --> 00:20:32,939
Let's check out his first attempt out of three at this starting height.

349
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,350
You can do it!

350
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:38,090
- Nice.
- That was a smooth sequence.

351
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:40,120
He cleared it in one go.

352
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:50,430
Why are you more nervous than when you were competing?

353
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,130
They'll start the two meters jump soon.

354
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:56,270
I think most of them will be eliminated.

355
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:58,250
Chen Hao Zhe already skipped several of them.

356
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,290
According to his capability,

357
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:02,730
2.1 m is a piece of cake for him.

358
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:06,190
We used to have someone like him too.

359
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:17,400
Why must you bring this up?

360
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:36,398
Currently, the crossbar is at 2 meters.
[Men's High Jump Finals]

361
00:21:36,398 --> 00:21:37,610
Only two candidates remain
[South Lake Sports University's Chen Hao Zhe versus South Lake University's Duan Yu Cheng]

362
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:40,509
to attempt this height for the finals.

363
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:43,130
First, it's Chen Hao Zhe from Sports University,

364
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:44,420
who has been the high jump event champion

365
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,669
in the university provincial games for three years in a row.

366
00:21:46,669 --> 00:21:48,639
Second, it's a new talent from South Lake University.

367
00:21:48,639 --> 00:21:52,130
- Hao Zhe! Come.
- Candidate No. 3 in the high jump event.

368
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:54,739
It's his first appearance in university provincial games.

369
00:21:54,739 --> 00:21:56,670
It's Duan Yu Cheng.

370
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,500
Hao Zhe, after the two-meter jump,

371
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,000
you should go straight for 2.06 meters.

372
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Yes, Coach.

373
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,200
No one is noteworthy in this batch.

374
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,600
You just need to play normally.

375
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,300
Duan Yu Cheng!

376
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,000
Did you hear me?

377
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Relax and stretch.

378
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,700
Don't be nervous.

379
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,100
Chen Hao Zhe will attempt 2.06 meters for his next jump.

380
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,000
What height would you like to attempt?

381
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,800
I'll follow your instruction, Coach.

382
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,000
Young Man,

383
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,800
you weren't frightened by his aura, right?

384
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,000
Don't worry.

385
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,200
When I'm on the field, I see no one but myself.

386
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,200
All right.

387
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Let's skip 2.03 meters then.

388
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,400
Let's try 2.06 meters, too.

389
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,400
We'll make this bet.

390
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,000
The stronger the individual is, the easier to affect his opponent.

391
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,400
They'll make their opponents panic

392
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,000
and perform worse than they usually do.

393
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,400
Chen Hao Zhe is experienced in major competitions.

394
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,600
He has excellent emotion regulation too.

395
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,200
Duan Yu Cheng is under huge pressure here.

396
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,000
Let's just hope he can perform consistently.

That boy is quite good.

410
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,000
He's doing so well although he joined us not long ago.

411
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Sometimes, it's beneficial to start first.

412
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,500
As long as he makes it, his opponent will feel the pressure.

413
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,400
Until now, both Duan Yu Cheng and Chen Hao Zhe

414
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,500
have cleared all of their attempts.

415

Chen Hao Zhe cleared 2.06 meters in his first attempt.

421

Xiao Cheng performs exceptionally well during competition.

422
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,600
He is a born competitor.

423
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,400
He already made his opponent feel pressure.

424
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,300
This jump is much tougher than his last one.

425
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,600
Was he affected by Duan Yu Cheng?

426

Until now, both candidates

have cleared all of their attempts.

428
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,500
They're tied for first place for now.

429
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,800
Maybe it's because of his injuries.

430
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,200
He skipped several major competitions this year.

431
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,400
I think he just recovered from injuries,

432
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,700
and he intends a comeback through this competition.

achieved his personal best

at 2.06 meters in his last attempt.

440

Now he faces a height he never attempted before,

2.09 meters.

442
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,400
He has made a striking gesture on the field.

443
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,200
This gesture shows his dominance on the field.

444
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,100
It was done by Usain Bolt

445

a height he never conquered before.

450

He intends to burn his bridges to shock his opponent.

451

He intends to face off against his opponent at an even higher height.

452

Although he's new to the competition,

Why is he passing that height?

459
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,000
Yes. Is he actually passing that height in this situation?

460
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Isn't this too risky?

461

The next height is 2.12 meters.

Yes!

That boy may seem harmless,

464
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
but in reality, he's more devious than any of us.

465

Just leave it to him.

466
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,000
I'm sure he knows what he's doing.

467
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,500
Why did you say that so cynically?

468

Yes.

469
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,300
That's not called devious.

470
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,800
That's called strategic and confident.

471
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,800
Do you dare pass this height if you were in his shoes?

472

- I...
- Go away.

473
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,100
He could also see Chen Hao Zhe's problems

during his last attempt.

475

That's why he's putting pressure on him.

476
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,300
If he doesn't clear 2.09 meters,

477
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,000
his rhythm will be disrupted.

478
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,400
He's creating a match point for himself.

479
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,400
Actually, he's just taking a bet.

480
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,800
Don't you understand your student well enough?

481
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,600
Since he requested a pass, that means he thought it through.

482
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,700
And it was easy for him in the attempt at 2.06 meters.

483
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,600
Don't be too worried about him.

I hope so.

The 2.09 meters

491
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,600
has become the first match point of our finals today.

492
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:13,600
To him, this jump will produce two extreme situations.

493
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,300

00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,700
♫ I'm faltering in my steps; I won't be too greedy ♫

657
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,800
♫ The breeze shares with me a secret ♫

658
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,800
♫ You can't hide your scent from me ♫

659
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,800
♫ We are stuck together ♫

660
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,400
♫ After the heavy rain's evaporation ♫

661
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,500
♫ The convenience store blasts with cold air ♫

662
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,600
♫ But we are still sweating bullets ♫

663
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,400
♫ Stop checking your phone all the time ♫

664
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,800
♫ And pretending that you don't care about me ♫

665
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,400
♫ For me, summer is not just about ♫

666
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,400
♫ Carbonated drinks and jerseys ♫

667
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,000
♫ With clear and transparent courage ♫

668
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,400
♫ Don't stop me, I want to tell you everything ♫

669
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,500
♫ As long as you are here, I won't stop ♫

670
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:32,800
♫ This passion will burn forever ♫

671
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:40,400
♫ Let's sprint toward the ocean ♫

672
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:46,200
♫ The blazing waves are glistening ♫

673
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:50,000
♫ I look forward ♫

674
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,800
♫ To the infinite future ♫

675
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:57,900
♫ I leave everything behind except to stride with you across the sky ♫

676
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:02,200
♫ I'll give it my all to leap toward this stage ♫

677
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:09,200
♫ I look forward to the infinite future ♫

678
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:13,000
♫ You said there will be success and failure if I come to you ♫

679
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,100
♫ Great things come naturally ♫

680
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:20,800
♫ I look forward ♫

681
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,600
♫ To the infinite future ♫

682
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:28,400
♫ I leave everything behind except to stride with you across the sky ♫

683
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:33,000
♫ I'll give it my all to leap toward this stage ♫

684
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:39,800
♫ I look forward to the infinite future ♫

685
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:43,800
♫ You said there will be success and failure if I come to you ♫

686
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:49,600
♫ Great things come naturally ♫

687
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:56,000
♫ The blazing waves are glistening ♫
