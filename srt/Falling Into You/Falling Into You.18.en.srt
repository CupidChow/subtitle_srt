4
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,330
What's with the serious atmosphere?

5
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,560
Do you have anything to tell us?

6
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,020
No.

7
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,930
She doesn't want me to tell anyone else.

8
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,960
What won't she let you say?

9
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,400
I knew you guys could tell.

10
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,620
I wasn't planning on hiding it from you two.

11
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,030
You told her to call you Sister since you wanted her to be nearer to your generation, right?

12
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,550
You should stop.

13
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,680
That doesn't work against her.

14
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,610
We're a perfect match.

15
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,040
It's already decided. Please don't interfere.

16
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,360
Who permitted you to decide that?

17
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,960
It's fine if I get her permission.

18
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,380
Duan Tao, look at what your son is saying!

19
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,870
My son? Isn't he your son, too?

20
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,050
Can you calm down? Let's talk this over.

21
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,750
Let's talk this over.

22
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,610
I knew it wasn't right about you.

23
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:55,530
I knew you were up to something back then.

24
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:59,710
I never expected you to do a thing like this.

25
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,720
She's your coach, you know?

26
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,020
She's much older than you.

27
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,860
She's only eight years older than me.

28
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,220
Isn't it the same for you and Dad?

29
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,690
How could it be the same?

30
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:08,570
How is this different?

31
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,090
Your father is older than me!

32
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,010
What's the difference between an older male or older female partner?

33
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:15,070
Mom, update your thinking.

34
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,440
Duan Yu Cheng! I'll tell you right now!

35
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,770
I won't agree with this!

36
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,710
We're not an ordinary family.

37
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,770
You need my permission before you get a girlfriend!

38
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:25,080
Yes. Of course, we aren't an ordinary family.

39
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,280
Usual families aren't nouveau riche like us.

- Look at your son.
- Calm down. Cheng Cheng!

41

Don't make your mother angry!

42
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,230
Your mother is right to be worried.

43
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:42,880
Too many uncertain elements are between you and Coach Luo.

44
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,330
Precisely!

45
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,120
What should I do then?

46
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,690
Do you guys want me to break up with her?

47
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,380
- No.
- Yes.

48
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,500
Let me finish.

49
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,750
A man shouldn't swallow his words.

50
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,120
I believe you made this decision after careful consideration.

51
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,100
However, remember this too.

52
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,800
You promised us that you'd be responsible for yourself,

53
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,340
right?

54
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,030
I will.

55
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,510
Don't worry.

56
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,150
Are you sure?

57
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,680
Yes.

58
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,920
If there's nothing else, I'll go upstairs.

59
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,510
Go now.

60
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,860
By the way,

61
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,630
here's a friendly reminder.

62
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:32,030
Mom, if you look for her over this matter, I'll get angry at you.

63
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,270
- I...
- That's right.

64
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,720
- Go upstairs now.
- You!

Wait! Listen to me.

66
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,860
Didn't we agree not to be angry at him?

67
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,190
Does anger solve the issue?

68
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,680
At his age, once he decides,

69
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,130
you can never change his mind.

70
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:49,450
No! I won't agree with this!

71
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:51,090
I'll look for Coach Luo.

72
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,180
I'll confront her.

73
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,540
Are you truly going to make your son angry?

74
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,410
What else should I do then? Leave him as he is?

75
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:01,880
He's only 20 years old this year. What does he know?

76
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,900
Suit yourself.

Enough! Stop talking.

I need to calm down.

81

You're here?

82
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:35,370
Where are you going? Will you fight?

Yes! Find me a rod!

That brat, he'd better pray that I don't find him.

86
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,720
I'll break his legs if I catch him!

87

Is it Li Ge?

88
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,970
Did he run away again?

89
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,580
You already forked out over 30,000 yuan ($4,300) for Jiang Tian's shop.

90
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,830
Is he such an ingrate?

91
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,270
He has no gratitude at all!

92
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,730
He wasn't this unruly when Duan Yu Cheng was here to pressure him.

93
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:59,610
But now, he's not even attending his training.

What an insolent boy.

95

Why are you joining me?

Calm down. Don't be impulsive.

Why are you stopping me?

Let me ask. Do you wish to make him suffer

113
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,340

Why did you come here then?

Hello?

Why send me that kind of picture?

I'll drink by myself.

It's New Year's Eve.

What else can I do alone besides drinking?

357

You can set off fireworks.

I'm living on campus.

Even if I set off a small firework,

the security guard may arrest me.

I'd keep you here to celebrate New Year together.

I don't want to celebrate it at your house.

We must celebrate it together

Can't you tell that she has a boyfriend?

Do you think I won't break your game console?

385

Are you even human?

386

388

Chinese New Year's Eve 3 or 4 years ago?

393

We drank through the night.

394
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,200
You were drunk back then.

395
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,400
You insisted on watching Harry Potter.

396
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,600
You weren't interested in magic usually.

397
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,600
Harry Potter was the hottest movie back then.

398

How could I flirt with girls on the team

00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,700
What is this?

508
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,300
A love letter.

509
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,800
Do you still remember the condition you promised me?

510
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,400
Of course.

511
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,900
But I don't think your current state is appropriate.

512
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,000
But why?

513
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
You're completely distracted.

514
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,200
You don't need to prepare these things for me.

515
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,400
The best present to give me

516
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,000
is to train well.

517
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,200
But I want to make them for you.

518
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,700
I'm happy to give you presents.

519
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:57,000
When I'm happy, I'll do well in training.

520
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,400
What kind of logic is that?

521
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,800
It's normal logic.

522
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,100
I spoke from the bottom of my heart.

523
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,800
I'll accept them today.

524
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,800
But you're not allowed to make them anymore,

525
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:13,100
at least not until the Nationals are over.

526
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,600
Fine then.

527
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,800
And... during your closed-door training,

528
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,400
you can't think of things unrelated to your training.

529
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,600
Do not text or call me

530
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,800
without my permission.

531
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,800
You must follow Coach Yang Jin's instructions.

532
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,800
You see all these conditions from only your perspective.

533
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,400
I'm unsatisfied with them.

534
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,200
I request one condition.

535
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,000
What condition?

536
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,800
Just one condition.

537
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,500
Don't mingle with people from the sprint team.

538
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,700
What?

539
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,800
They aren't good guys.

540
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,500
All right, hurry.

541
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,000
Take your luggage back to your room

542
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,400
and run a 10 km for me.

543
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,100
What? N-Now?

544
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,800
When else would I mean?

545
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,400
I just came back. I'm so exhausted.

546
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,400
We should have lunch first.

547
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,200
What lunch?

548
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,200
Do what I tell you.

549
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,400
- Let's eat.
- Hurry!

550
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,500
You're so fierce.

551
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,900
You weren't like this on the island,

552
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,200
especially when we were on the beach.

553
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,800
Hurry.

554
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,800
Stop that talk.

555
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,100
- I can't run.
- Get up.

556
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,200
I can't run.

557
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,000
Seems 10 km isn't enough.

558
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,200
You can run 20 km then.

559
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,800
Run to clear your head.

560
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,200
Hurry.

561
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,100
- Hurry!
- Fine, fine.

562
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,200
It's just 10 km, right?

563
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,600
Listen, I'll finish it in 40 minutes.

564
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,100
You keep bragging.

565
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,600
My father was right.

566
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,400
Women do get loud in a relationship.

567
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:58,800
♫ I never waste my energy on anything else ♫

568
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:04,800
♫ Because protecting you is my priority ♫

569
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:10,200
♫ My heartbeat elevates every time I see you ♫

570
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:16,100
♫ It's like my soul derailed into the universe ♫

571
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:23,900
♫ Unwilling to be separated more than a centimeter ♫

572
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:29,800
♫ When together, we have never-ending conversations ♫

573
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:35,600
♫ We don't need definitions from astrology ♫

574
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:41,000
♫ Because we were born with chemistry between us ♫

575
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:49,000
I had a dream on the night you left.

576
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,200
In my dream,

577
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,800
the cool seaside breeze

578
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,600
blew across the shiny, warm sand,

579
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,400
blowing breeze by breeze.

580
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,200
As the waves went back and forth,

581
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,500
you turned around to face me.

582
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,000
When I woke up,

583
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,600
I visited the beach again, and sat there all day.

584
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,000
I didn't want to go home.

585
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,700
I wasn't willing to leave.

586
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,600
It was as if I could relive my dream there,

587
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,800
never waking up.

588
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,800
And you always stood there with a smile.

589
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,900
You never left.

590
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,800
I've become complicated.

591
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,200
It's just like when your hand

592
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,800
brushed across my hair gently.

593
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,800
Suddenly, a myriad of emotions

594
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,800
struck my chest at the same time.

595
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,700
It was sweet and sorrowful.

596
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,200
The distant future and the present

597
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,400
[that will embrace me soon.]

598
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,000
[They're flooding toward me,]

599
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,400
carrying a smiling you together with them.

600
00:35:54,390 --> 00:36:01,090
♫ There is no reason because you're irreplaceable ♫

601
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:16,800
♫ I'll be thinking of you ♫

602
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,600
♫ Whether it's howling wind or pouring rain ♫

603
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,600
♫ My heart ♫

604
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,700
♫ Will not change no matter what ♫

605
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:29,400
♫ I'll be thinking of you ♫

606
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,000
♫ I don't need a reason ♫

607
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,400
♫ Because it's you ♫

608
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,400
♫ You'll decide whether a cloudy day becomes sunny ♫

609
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:56,600
♫ Sunrise captures the silhouette of the island, while shadows dance across the tides ♫

610
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:00,400
♫ The waves chase after the footprints, breathing them in ♫

611
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,200
♫ I want to follow you; let the sun melt the distance between us ♫

612
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:08,000
♫ I'm faltering in my steps; I won't be too greedy ♫

613
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,200
♫ The breeze shares with me a secret ♫

614
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,000
♫ You can't hide your scent from me ♫

615
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
♫ We are stuck together ♫

616
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,700
♫ After the heavy rain's evaporation ♫

617
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,900
♫ The convenience store blasts with cold air ♫

618
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,900
♫ But we are still sweating bullets ♫

619
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,600
♫ Stop checking your phone all the time ♫

620
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,100
♫ And pretending that you don't care about me ♫

621
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:27,800
♫ For me, summer is not just about ♫

622
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,800
♫ Carbonated drinks and jerseys ♫

623
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:35,200
♫ With clear and transparent courage ♫

624
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:40,300
♫ Don't stop me; I want to tell you everything ♫

625
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,900
♫ As long as you are here, I won't stop ♫

626
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:56,200
♫ This passion will burn forever ♫

627
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:03,600
♫ Let's sprint toward the ocean ♫

628
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:09,700
♫ The blazing waves are glistening ♫

629
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:13,400
♫ I look forward ♫

630
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:17,200
♫ To the infinite future ♫

631
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,000
♫ I leave everything behind except to stride with you across the sky ♫

632
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,600
♫ I'll give it my all to leap toward this stage ♫

633
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:32,400
♫ I look forward to the infinite future ♫

634
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,200
♫ You said there will be success and failure if I come to you ♫

635
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:40,500
♫ Great things come naturally ♫

636
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:44,200
♫ I look forward ♫

637
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,800
♫ To the infinite future ♫

638
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,800
♫ I leave everything behind except to stride with you across the sky ♫

639
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:56,300
♫ I'll give it my all to leap toward this stage ♫

640
00:38:56,300 --> 00:39:03,100
♫ I look forward to the infinite future ♫

641
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:07,000
♫ You said there will be success and failure if I come to you ♫

642
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,800
♫ Great things come naturally ♫

643
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:19,800
♫ The blazing waves are glistening ♫
