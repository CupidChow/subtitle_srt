What are you thinking?

13

You can't disregard your principles

Desserts are the local specialty.

With more training,

103

I can surely reach 7,000.

How cocky.

105

That's not cockiness.

I'm just stating a fact.

107

In front of others, I'm modest.

108

But not in front of you.

109
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,400
I want to reassure you; that's all.

I called you that day, and you sounded upset.

Let me answer this.

113
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,600
Yes?

114
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,600
I can tell, you know.

115
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,800

Let me remind you, Duan Yu Cheng,

120
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,100
don't push your luck.

121
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,200
What do you mean by that?

122
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,100
Explain clearly.

123
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,600
Coach Luo treats you well,

124
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,500
but you need to know the boundaries.

125
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,600
Coach Luo and Coach Wu are together.

126
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,900
Do you think it's fun to interfere?

127
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,100
Who said they're together?

128
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,200
Do you have evidence?

129
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,500
I saw them holding hands.

130
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,800
What are you doing?

131
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,200
We also held hands.

132
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,000
Are we together then?

133
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,600
Disgusting.

134
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,600
I won't explain to you.

135
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,000
I've done nothing wrong.

136
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,600
You're afraid of Coach Wu.

137
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,600
I'm not.

138
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,900
- Did Coach Wu call you just now?
- Yes.

139
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,200
He's been dealing with some things lately.

140
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,000
He just called to tell me it's all right.

141
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:37,400
So you didn't come to watch my match because of him?

142
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,600
What is it?

143
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You and Coach Wu

144
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:50,000
aren't together, right?

145
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,800
You brat, you even dare ask that? Do you want a beating?

146
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,700
If you two aren't together, then I can pursue you.

147
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,200
But if you're in a relationship,

148
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,200
things will be complicated.

149
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,200
Because I don't want to get between others' relationships.

150
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,000
What are you talking about?

151
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I-I don't need you to give me an answer now.

152
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,800
I-I can wait.

153
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,900
I just want you to know,

154
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,600
that wasn't a lapse of judgment,

155
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,800
nor a reckless act.

156
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,800
Presently, I don't have any great achievements,

157
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,600
and I can't promise you a future of certainty.

158
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,300
But I promise,

159
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,900
if you give me time,

160
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,000
I will be your pride.

161
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,700
Childish.

162
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,800
How old are you?

163
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,800
I'm 20.

164
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,700
In two years,

165
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,200
I'll be legal marital age.

166
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,000
That's none of my business.

167
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,200
Regardless, I'm being serious.

168
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,600
- Okay. I'm recording now.
- Okay

169
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,200
I'll give a brief introduction.

170
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,000
You're too close.

Too close.

- Here?
- Yes, that's fine.

174
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,400
That's good. Okay.

175
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,400
Have you a clear view of my face?

176
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,600
Yes. You look handsome.

177
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,000
All right.
- Come on.

178
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,900
Hello!

179
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:39,200
The weather today is great.

180
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,400
Perfect for sports.

181
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,500
Sister Xia! Where are you filming?

182
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,600
- I'm over here.
- Okay. Okay.

183
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,200
I'm over here, Sister Xia.

184
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,600
Today is the first day of the National University Games.

185
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,000
It's the first day of the competition as well.

186
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,400
I will do my best!

187
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,600
You're just rambling.

188
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,600
I don't know what to say.

189
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,200
Either way, I will do my best.

190
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,600
- You can do it.
- I can do it!

191
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,400
♫  So maybe I was hasty ♫

192
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:14,200
♫ To feel misunderstood ♫

193
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:21,000
♫ It was not your job to save me ♫

194
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,400
♫ But still, I wished you would ♫

195
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,000
Xiao Cheng!

196
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,200
- You got this!
- Go!

197
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,600
Go, Xiao Cheng!

198
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,700
♫ Our love was interrupted ♫

199
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,200
♫ By all the things ♫

200
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,600
He passed out from exhaustion.

201
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,400
Get up, Senior!

202
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,800
♫ Now I know that what we had was something ♫

203
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,200
♫ I wish that I had known it at the time ♫

204
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,100
Sister Xia, don't record this.

205
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,400
It's too embarrassing.

206
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:59,200
♫ Because you made life worth feeling ♫

207
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:06,000
♫ You taught me how to live ♫

208
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
♫ Held me through my healing ♫

209
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,800
Twenty years old.

210
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,800
I'm 20.

211
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,600
In two years,

212
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,200
I'll be legal marital age.

213
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,400
Regardless, I'm being serious.

214
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Be more sensible.

215
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,300
What were you thinking?

216
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,400
He's only 20 years old.

217
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,800
You're almost 28.

218
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:48,980
Hi.

219
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,200
What are you so happy about?

220
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,000
I heard that Sister Xia and Mao Mao Qi

221
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,200
were recruited into the national team.

222
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,800
I thought you'd be devastated hearing that.

223
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,800
Why should I?

224
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,600
That regards them. I'm just me.

225
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,200
It's only a matter of time for me to get in.

226
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,400
When Sister Xia said she wanted to quit earlier on,

227
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,900
I was worried about her.

228
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,800
Jiang Tian is supportive of her.

229
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,000
They've always had a stable relationship.

230
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,700
She's got nothing to worry about now.

231
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,800
So don't you think a healthy relationship

232
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,400
is the best addition to one's journey forward?

233
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,700
Coach.

234
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,800
I...

235
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,200
If you continue,

236
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,600
I'll ban you from training three days.

237
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,500
But...

238
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,200
Fine.

239
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,300
Good.

240
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,900
Good.

241
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,500
Wonderful.

242
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,000
Entering the national team is good news,

243
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,600
very honorable.

244
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,600
Train hard over there.

245
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,000
Make our country proud.

246
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,900
This scene...

247
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,200
I didn't expect to see this.

248
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,100
I'm so happy for you.

249
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,600
This is normal.

250
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,000
Coach Gao is showing much self-restraint

251
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
since he shed a few tears of joy

252
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,600
instead of fainting from happiness.

253
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,200
You're the pride of South Lake University.

254
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,800
If I enter the national team,

255
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,300
will you hug me with tears of joy, too?

256
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,000
All the best.

257
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,700
- Coach.
- Go train now.

258
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,500
Congratulations.

259
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,600
As his senior,

260
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,600
you should invite all the high jump team

261
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,400
to treat Mao Mao to a meal today

262
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,400
as a farewell and celebration.

263
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,200
I'm not on the high jump team anymore.

264
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,400
All right.

265
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,600
We'll go without you then.

266
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,800
No.

267
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,700
I didn't say I wouldn't go.

268
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,400
I'll come.

269
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,000
- What do you want to eat?
- I want...

270
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,800
Beef noodle soup will do.

271
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,900
He entered the national team. It's not a big deal anyway.

272
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,800
- Senior.
- What are you doing?

273
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,600
I'll miss you a lot.

274
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,600
All right, go away.

275
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,800
It's not like we can no longer see each other.

276
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,600
- Go away.
- Coach Luo.

277
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,400
I'll miss you, too.

278
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,100
All right.

279
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,000
I'll miss you, too.

280
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I'll miss you, too, Mao Mao.

281
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,000
All right, enough.

282
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,200
Stop...

283
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,300
This time I have to praise the track and field team,

284
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,000
especially for the shot put event.

285
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,800
Dai Yu Xia got us our only gold medal.

286
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,200
Initially, she was apprehensive about joining the national team.

287
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,500
Coach Luo Na here

288
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,700
managed to persuade her with patience.

289
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,400
However,

290
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,200
our performance in certain events

291
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,600
is getting worse.

292
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,400
Work harder.

293
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,400
I won't point fingers here.

294
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,200
Wu Ze,

295
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,000
come to my office.

296
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,600
Find a solution.

297
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,200
When push comes to shove,

298
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,200
Director Wang might fire you.

299
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,500
I need the athletes to pull through.

300
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,000
In my team, Huang Lin is the only decent one,

301
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,300
and he was injured before the competition.

302
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,300
Sprinting is a highly competitive sport.

303
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,300
Those bad seeds on my team

304
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,700
perform worse than a decathlete.

305
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,600
Come to Jiang Tian's restaurant after you're done

306
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,800
for Mao Mao Qi's farewell meal.

307
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,200
[Jiang Xia Noodles]

308
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,400
Where's Coach Luo?

309
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,600
She has a meeting; she will be here soon.

310
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,000
-Thanks, Brother Jiang.
- Thanks, Brother Jiang.

311
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,400
Brother, can you make fried milk?

312
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,300
Not now.

313
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,300
In two days, perhaps.

314
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,000
Don't be picky.

315
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,300
- Have you a problem?
- So is it good?

316
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,200
It is good.

317
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,400
Do you want some?

318
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,000
I like that one.

319
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,500
Come, have a seat.

320
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,500
We'll eat here.

321
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,500
What? Do you know them?

322
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,600
It's been a while.

323
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,500
Acquaintances?

324
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,900
Sure.

325
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,400
Should we go somewhere else?

326
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,800
Why should you?

327
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,200
This is my restaurant.

328
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,400
They can't do anything.

329
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,200
Boss, do you have BBQ skewers here?

330
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,000
No.

331
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,400
And you call this a restaurant?

332
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,400
It's okay.

333
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,900
If you want BBQ skewers, I'll buy some for you.

334
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,700
Have some water.

335
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,500
Lady Boss, now that's good service.

336
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,000
What's the specialty here?

337
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,200
Noodles.

338
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,400
Have a look at these.

339
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,900
You serve only noodles here?

340
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,200
No rice or other dishes?

341
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,600
These noodle are our signature dishes.

342
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,200
These few.

343
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,400
Okay.

Who knows if they came here on purpose

354
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,400
or by accident.

355

Thank you.

The two guys with their backs against us

359
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,500
seem to know Chinese kickboxing.

360

I know them.

361
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,800
They're from kickboxing academy across the street.

362

But they dropped out

363
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,300

I can't help but wonder

372
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,600
how she seduced Brother Toothpick here.

373
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,000
That's called sexy.

00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,700
He ran past me.

The others escaped.

00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,400
No, thanks.

518
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,600
Then let's go to the police station now.

519
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,200
Come.

520
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,000
I'll give you a chance.

521
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,400
The 100-meter sprint.

522
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,700
Race with him.

523
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:26,000
If you win, I'll settle the payment on your behalf.

524
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,500
If you lose,

525
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,700
you'll do my bidding.

526
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,300
"Lose"?

527
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,200
Do you know how well I sprint?

528
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,200
Can I take your word for it?

529
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,600
You'd better run fast.

530
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,600
What is your name?

531
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,800
Li Ge.

532
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,800
How old are you?

533
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,000
I'm 19.

534
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
If you lose,

535
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,800
I'll propose to Luo Na tomorrow night.

536
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,600
What?

537
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,500
He's from South Lake University?

538
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,000
He was suspended after he got into a fight.

539
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,300
He didn't attend class half a year.

540
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,000
Wonderful.

541
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,600
You found a treasure.

542
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,600
He has to prove his worth.

543
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,200
Did he train professionally for sprinting?

544
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,900
No wonder you want me to race with him.

545
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,400
Mao Mao Qi just left

546
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,900
and someone like him comes.

547
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,000
Will we race or not?

548
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,600
- After he warms up.
- After he warms up.

549
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,100
Not bad.

550
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,200
Steady.

551
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,600
Coach Luo.

552
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,400
Can you look at this bruise?

553
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,600
They hit me way too hard.

554
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,900
Look.

555
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,400
You can still run if you're disfigured.

556
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,500
I think his physique

557
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,200
is better than yours when you were his age.

558
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,600
Will we race or not?

559
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,500
Stop wasting time.

560
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,800
Why are you in such a rush?

561
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,200
Go warm up, too.

562
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,400
Don't mess up!

563
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,900
I can easily outrun him.

564
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,700
Go then.

565
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,100
- Let's make a bet.
- What?

566
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,400
Come.

567
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,900
What are you doing?

568
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,900
What?

569
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,200
If I win,

570
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,400
you have to agree to something.

571
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,800
To what?

572
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,800
Say yes first.

573
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,000
Why do you make requests on a simple race like this?

574
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,900
Then I won't race.

575
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,600
What exactly is on your mind?

576
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,600
Can't Wu Ze find someone from his sprint team to race him?

577
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,400
Why me?

578
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,000
- You're throwing a tantrum.
- No.

579
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,500
I found a rare talent for you,

580
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,800
and I'm threatened if I lose this race.

581
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,000
But if I win, I get nothing.

582
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,800
How's that fair?

583
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,700
Who threatened you?

584
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,300
It doesn't matter.

585
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,200
If someone from the sprint team can outrun him,

586
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,400
Coach Wu won't have to recruit him.

587
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,700
Use your brain.

588
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:46,800
I don't care about his team.

589
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,600
Fine, I'll agree to your condition, all right?

590
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,100
- For real?
- Yes.

591
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:53,600
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

592
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,200
Don't lose.

593
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:10,200

I won't accept this! I didn't warm up properly. Again!

617
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,700
Race again.

Come.

646
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,600

♫ I look forward ♫

680
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:09,200
♫ To the infinite future ♫

681
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:13,000
♫ I leave everything behind except to stride with you across the sky ♫

682
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,500
♫ I'll give it my all to leap toward this stage ♫

683
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:24,500
♫ I look forward to the infinite future ♫

684
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:28,400
♫ You said there will be success and failure if I come to you ♫

685
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:34,000
♫ Great things come naturally ♫

686
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:40,300
♫ The blazing waves are glistening ♫
