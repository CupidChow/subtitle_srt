[Episode 5]

4
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,380
This is your last chance, too.

5
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,350
You might not make it.

6
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,780
At least the chance is still in my hands.

7
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,210
Don't panic.

8
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:55,020
Your freshman looks much more relaxed than you.

9
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,780
Stay calm.

10
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,140
Height: 2.1 meter.

11
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,679
Duan Yu Cheng: failed.

12
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,680
Director, it's a tie. What do we do?

13
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,030
Go for another round?

14
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,900
No need.

15
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,070
- You are in.
- Yes.

16
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,810
Yes.

17
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,840
Why not?

18
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,730
Why can't we go for another round?

19
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,010
Is it because of my height again?

20
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:57,200
Duan Yu Cheng!

21
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,029
Duan Yu Cheng, it's fine. There is still a chance.

22
00:02:59,029 --> 00:03:01,370
What are you doing?

23
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:03,729
- Duan Yu Cheng.
- Let me try again.

24
00:03:03,729 --> 00:03:05,910
I don't agree.

25
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,440
Duan Yu Cheng, you just recovered.

26
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,230
You need to rest.

27
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,490
This is not fair!

28
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:16,800
- Duan Yu Cheng, what are you doing?
- It's okay.

29
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,850
What are you doing, Duan Yu Cheng?

30
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,940
Don't throw a tantrum.

31
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,470
Duan Yu Cheng.

32
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,780
Are you dead?

33
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:21,290
I know you put a lot of effort into this tryout.

34
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,220
For the time being,

35
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:29,760
when you are free, go to the gym and do some recovery training.

36
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,460
You watched Chen Hao Zhe's videos, didn't you?

37
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:43,210
Fine, I won't talk much to you.

38
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,820
Get up.

39
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,640
I said, get up!

40
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,820
Hurry. Don't dillydally.

41
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,480
I shall get going, Coach.

42
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,090
Old Wu!

43
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:05,520
We are here.

44
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,540
Take these.

45
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,050
- Go over there.
- Go where?

46
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,220
To Coach Wu.

47
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,770
Why?

48
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:17,370
Just go. Don't talk nonsense.

49
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,470
Hurry.

50
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,220
Change your shoes and go to the race track.

51
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,630
On your marks...

52
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,660
Get set.

53
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:42,179
Huang Lin: 10.96 seconds.

54
00:06:42,179 --> 00:06:45,870
Duan Yu Cheng: 11.02 seconds.

55
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,229
Zhang Hong Wen: 11.09 seconds.

56
00:06:49,229 --> 00:06:51,380
What happened with the start?

57
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,490
How many times have I told you?
[Huang Lin]

58
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:56,260
Do you expect to get a good rank in the provincial games with this?

59
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,750
And you,

60
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,340
what happened to you during the mid run?

61
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,270
Your feet flexing wasn't sufficient and your knees were stiff.

62
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,490
Did you skip breakfast?

63
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,580
I will pay attention next time.

64
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,670
I couldn't care less about you, Zhang Hong Wen.
[Zhang Hong Wen]

65
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,360
Mr. Wu,

66
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,500
I am already in second place without Duan Yu Cheng.

67
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,030
Your record will disgrace us even if you enter the provincial games.

68
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,460
No,

69
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,310
Coach Wu, I will train more in the meantime.

70
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,850
This competition is very important to me.

71
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:37,400
Is it important? I don't think it matters to you at all.

72
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,450
You merely run your mouth.

73
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:42,960
Last-minute training won't be helpful to you.

74
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,629
Run faster and keep the starting blocks.

75
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,900
Keep the starting blocks.

76
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,240
Senior, please hear me out.

77
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,600
Senior.

78
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,720
Look at Duan Yu Cheng's result. It's 11.02 seconds.

79
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,140
You are indeed a go-getter.

80
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,040
What did you say?

81
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:24,140
Why did you put Coach Luo on the spot?

82
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,190
What do you mean?

83
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,040
What do I mean?

84
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,240
I heard you got second place in the hundred-meter sprint.

85
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,770
You must be in high spirits, right?

86
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:39,930
Do you think you're so great to get a chance for university provincial games?

87
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,340
How many relationships do you have?

88
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:45,470
It's others' business, not mine.

89
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:51,039
A high jumper fails in his own sport and goes for a hundred-meter sprint.

90
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:54,510
If you fail in that again, is throwing your next sport?

91
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:57,640
Duan Yu Cheng, what about this?

92
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,750
You can choose the sport you want first.

93
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,240
We will compete in the trials only after you are done choosing.

94
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,720
I didn't choose any sports.

95
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,760
I heard your family is rich.

96
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,240
That doesn't concern you.

97
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,720
Do you know what they say about Coach Luo?

98
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:21,270
They are guessing she accepted your bribe.

99
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,440
Repeat that if you dare.

100
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,190
Don't throw a tantrum on me.

101
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,220
Listen up, Duan Yu Cheng.

102
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,789
In the track-and-field team, results are what we care about.

103
00:09:30,789 --> 00:09:33,520
Don't you seek special privilege.

104
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,340
What are you doing?

105
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,370
Do you have too much spare time?

106
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:44,010
Stop it or run 20,000 meters.

107
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,770
Don't mind him.

108
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,440
Senior.

109
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,810
Jiang Tian is petty,

110
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:01,400
but he has a good soul.

111
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,060
Just ignore him.

112
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,220
I wish I could,

113
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,490
but he criticized Coach Luo.

114
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,060
Coach Luo helped him before.

115
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,700
He got angry when he heard gossip about Coach Luo.

116
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,610
He should have made it clear,

117
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,999
but is there someone who is badmouthing Coach Luo?

118
00:10:26,999 --> 00:10:28,470
Don't mind that.

119
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:32,370
People like to run their mouths and spew nonsense.

120
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:37,969
Just do your best and shut their mouths with your results.

121
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,140
Understood.

122
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,810
Have you finished the chocolate?

123
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,809
Yes, I ate it all.

124
00:10:44,809 --> 00:10:47,640
Good, work harder in your training.

125
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,770
This is the training of Duan Yu Cheng.

126
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,030
Take a look at it.

127
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,250
Come on.

128
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,920
Say something.

129
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,360
He has skinny ankles,

130
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,359
long, defined Achilles tendons,

131
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,270
short thighs, and long calves.

132
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,940
What else?

133
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:36,600
This body type keeps his weight forward and has a faster speed,

134
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,649
and larger propulsive force.

135
00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:39,650
So?

136
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,930
So he is a gifted sprinter.

137
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,600
I told you

138
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,340
that he can run, and he is skilled.

139
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:53,570
Most importantly,

140
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,650
he is smart.

141
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:59,770
What about this?

142
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,840
You tell him

143
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,020
that I will coach him.

144
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,339
Why should I?

145
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:06,199
How could you steal my student?

146
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,560
He is mine!

147
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,340
All right,

148
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:14,050
let's not discuss if he will switch sports.

149
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:17,030
Can you consider him for hundred-meter sprint?

150
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:21,610
- Luo Na...
- I believe he can make it within eleven seconds.

151
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:25,790
Come on; eat the food.

152
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,260
Let's eat first.

153
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,079
Senior Brother,

154
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,450
you are skinny. Eat more.

155
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,130
Come on.

156
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:38,100
Why didn't you peel the prawn?

157
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,690
All right,

158
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,260
I will agree for your sake.

159
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,670
How could you say it's for my sake?

160
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,450
He beat your students.

161
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:49,850
I didn't pull any strings to get him in.

162
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,930
Yes, your student is stronger than mine.

163
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:56,700
I am glad you know.

164
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,770
The competition is in twenty days.

165
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,690
Don't drink alcohol.

166
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:08,590
I am not the participant, though.

167
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,860
I expect you to train Duan Yu Cheng.

168
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,230
I even have the schedule ready.

169
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,130
Tasty...

170
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,870

He follows wherever Yu Cheng goes and does whatever Yu Cheng does.

Yu Cheng would have entered South Lake University through special admissions.

Besides, he's from the School of Sports.

437

Why does he insist

on sticking with Yu Cheng in morning trainings?

439
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,200
Yu Cheng finds it embarrassing to say this.

440

00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,700
I suppose most participants will be eliminated by the height of 1.95 m.
