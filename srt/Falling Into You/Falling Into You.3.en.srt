[Episode 3]

4
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:00,010
♫ Sunrise captures the silhouette of the island, while shadows dance across the tides ♫

5
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,849
♫ The waves chase after the footprints, breathing them in ♫

6
00:02:03,849 --> 00:02:07,749
♫ I want to follow you; let the sun melt the distance between us ♫

7
00:02:07,749 --> 00:02:11,549
♫ I'm faltering in my steps; I won't be too greedy ♫

8
00:02:11,549 --> 00:02:15,119
♫ The breeze shares with me a secret. You can't hide your scent from me ♫

9
00:02:15,119 --> 00:02:19,250
♫ We are stuck together after the heavy rain's evaporation ♫

10
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:23,359
♫ The convenience store blasts with cold air, but we are still sweating bullets ♫

11
00:02:23,359 --> 00:02:28,399
♫ Stop checking your phone all the time and pretending that you don't care about me ♫

12
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:30,200
Excuse me.
♫ For me, summer is not just about ♫

13
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:35,300
♫ Carbonated drinks and jerseys ♫

14
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,990
♫ With clear and transparent courage ♫

15
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:44,220
♫ Don't stop me, I want to tell you everything ♫

16
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:51,870
♫ As long as you are here, I won't stop ♫

17
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:59,620
♫ This passion will burn forever ♫

18
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,210
♫ Let's sprint toward the ocean ♫

19
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:04,100
Coach!

20
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:12,560
It's not that tiring.

21
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,940
Young men now are not that capable.

22
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:22,150
I thought you said you'll wait for me at the mountaintop.

23
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,680
This is so embarrassing.

24
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,410
I'm too tired.

25
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,300
What are you carrying?

26
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,560
Tools for barbecue.

27
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:43,340
You are quite honest.

28
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,190
Get up.

29
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,220
I'll treat you to some grilled sausages.

30
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,960
Thank you, Coach.

31
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,570
It's good to be young.

32
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,460
I'm going to vomit from all the hiking.

33
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,520
I can't eat anything now.

34
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,310
Aren't you 18 years old?

35
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,820
What are you thinking?

36
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,070
It'll be sports day soon.

37
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,230
Yes.

38
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:44,730
I'll join the varsity team (starting players) soon.

39
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,140
Are you so confident that you can do well on sports day?

40
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,470
Of course, I can.

41
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,000
Trust me.

42
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,440
Why do you love the high jump so much?

43
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,760
I don't have any specific reasons. I just like it.

44
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,500
Others say that I can't do it.

45
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,480
So I'll prove to them that I can.

46
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,850
It's that simple.

47
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:19,040
You are like a puppy.

48
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,330
Not bad.

49
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm just half an hour later than you.

50
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,140
Looks like I'm still strong, despite being an old man.

51
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:30,220
All right. Go and join your classmates.

52
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,160
Aren't you going to join us?

53
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,370
We've rented a villa halfway up the mountain. Join us.

54
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,250
Why should I?

55
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,570
I don't have the same interests as you guys.

56
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,720
Okay now. Let's go.

57
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,890
Come on.

58
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,510
We'll be taking the same route anyway.

59
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,920
How will you know if you don't give it a try?

60
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,930
Coach Wu, see you at the university!

61
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,260
Go in, go in.

62
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,490
You can't touch my players.

63
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,410
You are bad at this.

64
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:12,720
I don't want to play anymore.

65
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,940
Don't be a sore loser.

66
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,550
- Play by yourself.
- Duan Yu Cheng.

67
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:18,249
- Have an apple.
- Thank you.

68
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,950
Is the food ready? I'm famished, Sun Jie Ping.

69
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,030
It's done now. Come and help me out.

70
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,850
You can do it yourself.

71
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,920
Excuse me.

72
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,320
Are you a loyal friend or not?

73
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,830
Come here at once if you are.

74
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:55,050
It's too awkward to hang out with a bunch of youngsters.

75
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,059
It's inappropriate for me to go.

76
00:06:57,059 --> 00:06:59,680
I was not invited.

77
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,420
Or maybe you can come back now. I'll buy a box of beer for us.

78
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,740
I'm a teacher, after all.

79
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,480
It'll be too childish for me to leave right now.

80
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:14,600
Then how long do you plan to hang out with those young people?

81
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,510
I don't think I can survive for long.

82
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:20,730
I should hang up now. Bye bye.

83
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,750
Let's play the Bend a Finger game.

84
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,620
The six of us will say one thing in turn.

85
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,490
If you have been in the same situation, or if you have done it before,

86
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:51,220
then bend a finger.

87
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,820
The person who bends all fingers first gets a penalty.

88
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,559
Okay, I'll go first.

89
00:07:58,559 --> 00:08:01,720
I don't have a girlfriend.

90
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,950
Coach! You have a boyfriend.

91
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,760
Who is it?

92
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,290
- Coach Luo.
- Tell us who he is.

93
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,120
Teacher Luo, you have a boyfriend?

94
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,150
We are talking about girlfriends, right?

95
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:17,190
I have too many female friends.

96
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,720
It's impossible not to have a female friend.

97
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,060
- You are cheating.
- You are cheating.

98
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,330
I'm not.

99
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,749
Han Dai, it's your turn.

100
00:08:22,749 --> 00:08:24,410
I'll expose myself then.

101
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,290
I've never been in a relationship before.

102
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:31,780
Duan Yu Cheng. You are lying.

103
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,490
I'm not.

104
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,240
I've never been in a relationship before.

105
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:38,040
- Impossible.
- Is that really true?

106
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,800
Isn't that normal?

107
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,479
That's nothing to be ashamed of.

108
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,360
Yes, it's not shameful. I've never been in a relationship, either.

109
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,700
You can't compare yourself to him.

110
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,280
That's too mean. It's your turn.

111
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,420
Okay, my turn.

112
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,960
No one has ever confessed to me.

113
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,340
Isn't that normal?

114
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:03,950
Duan Yu Cheng, you are lying again!

115
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:07,179
I'm not lying. No one has ever confessed to me before.

116
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,130
That's impossible.

117
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:10,570
I promise you.

118
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,570
No one has ever confessed to me before.

119
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,990
- Really?
- That's impossible.

120
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:18,020
This is... a kind of effect or something.

121
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,820
It's when people are too good-looking,
[Senior Brother]

122
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,020
they will actually have no pursuers.

123
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,239
It's called the halo effect...

124
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,190
- the halo effect.
- Yes.

125
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,120
Okay now.

126
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,080
- Let's toast for the halo effect.
- Just come.

127
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,400
- Just come. Hurry up. I'll wait for you.
- Come on.

128
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,240
Where is Coach Luo?

129
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,430
- Whose turn is it?
- Coach Luo, come back. We're waiting for you.

130
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:37,820
- Here I come.
- It's Shi Yin's turn now.

131
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,610
My turn.

132
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,620
Welcome, Coach Wu.

133
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,720
Wait for me too.

134
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,450
All right, I'm late.

135
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:50,550
Tell me what you want to know about Teacher Luo.

136
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,470
Gossip. Of course, we want to know some gossip about her.

137
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,719
There's no gossip.

138
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,379
Okay. Let me tell you about Teacher Luo's love history.

139
00:10:00,379 --> 00:10:02,269
What love history?

140
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,150
Can you stop ruining my reputation

141
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,669
in front of my students?

142
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,630
I won't ruin it.

143
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:09,510
I'll just prove that you are attractive

144
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:12,389
and charming.

145
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,839
That's right.

146
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,149
Tell them then.

147
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:18,389
I remember that there was a ping pong player.

148
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,970
- Right?
- Yes.

149
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,359
And there was another one.

150
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,050
He was like this.

151
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,250
Was he a discus throw athlete? Yes.

152
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,800
You must be a good student.

153
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,800
Here.

154
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,200
A good student.

155
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,600
There was another one.

156
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,200
Knife-cut noodles.

157
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,200
Stop it.

158
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,700
How dare you bring him up?

159
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,400
It was your fault for betraying me.

160
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,000
I didn't betray you.

161
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Athletes should go through thick and thin together.

162
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,900
As your senior brother, I had to take your happiness into consideration.

163
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,700
Get lost.

164
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,700
Was Teacher Luo already so popular back then?

165
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,400
This is mine.

166
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,400
Just open another can.

167
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,200
Are you okay?

168
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,900
Are you okay?

169
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,400
Are you okay?

170
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,900
You scared your disciple.

171
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,400
Are you okay?

172
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,600
I just think that we should change the topic.

173
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,700
That was so long ago;

174
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,600
it's quite meaningless.

175
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,800
That's right. Let's change the topic.

176
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,600
Okay. Let's change the topic then.

177
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,000
During the 2008 Olympics,

178
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,900
when Bolt had just clocked 9.69 seconds,

179
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,400
Coach Luo was crazy about Bolt.

180
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,300
Almost daily, she wore a homemade T-shirt with Bolt printed on it.

181
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,800
Did you know that?

182
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,600
The worse thing was,

183
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,700
every time after our training,

184
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,900
she would force us all to wear one.

185
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,400
That was so lame.

186
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,400
It was so embarrassing back then.

187
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,000
It was so cool.

188
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Enough.

189
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,900
Don't tell all; leave me some privacy.

190
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,400
Why did I know you since young?

191
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,300
What's wrong with that?

192
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,500
It's your gain for knowing me.

193
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,200
I've fought for you since young.

194
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,400
I brought hot water for you.

195
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,000
You washed my feet.

196
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,200
Teacher Luo.

197
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,800
Coach Wu Ze and you count as childhood friends (sweethearts), right?

198
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,800
- Yes.
- I suppose.

199
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,800
Of course, we are.

200
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,800
Here, to childhood friends.

201
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,600
- Childhood friends!
- Childhood friends!

202
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,800
Slow down. Are you sure you're okay?

203
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,300
Of course.

204
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,200
Don't look down on me.

205
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,600
Watch your step.

206
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,700
Okay. You can go back now.

207
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,200
Teacher Luo and Teacher Wu, have a safe trip back.

208
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,800
- You should go back now.
- Wait.

209
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,700
Bye, Teacher Luo.

210
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,700
This...

211
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,900
Give it back to them.

212
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,300
- Bye bye.
- Bye bye.

213
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,600
Bye. Be careful.

214
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,600
Senior Brother, be careful.

215
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,300
You be careful.

216
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,000
- Watch your step.
- You should watch your step.

217
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,300
Walk in a straight line. Come on.

218
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,700
Duan Yu Cheng.

219
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,000
- Childhood lovers.
- Duan Yu Cheng.

220
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,100
Why are you ignoring me?

221
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,500
Duan Yu Cheng.

222
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,400
Are you okay?

223
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,300
I'm sorry.

224
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,500
I didn't think you would react so strongly.

225
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,600
I'm fine.

226
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,400
I'm just ticklish.

227
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,000
What is it?

228
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,100
Actually, I want to tell you...

229
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,800
Forget it.

230
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,200
The mood is gone now.

231
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,600
I'll tell you some other day.

232
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,100
Okay.

233
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,600
You should go back first.

234
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,600
I suddenly remembered that I need to do something.

235
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,800
I need to talk to my coach.

236
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,800
My abdominal muscles hurt.

237
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,600
What did you do? Why are your abdominal muscles in pain?

238
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,200
I never thought

239
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,100
that you would remember so many things about me.

240
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,400
You are too kind.

241
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,300
Those who don't know better will think

242
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,000
that you are secretly in love with me.

243
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,800
I wouldn't dare. Just think about it.

244
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,700
Sports school is already such a competitive place.

245
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,800
It's true.

246
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,500
It would be easier to enter the Olympics than conquer your heart.

247
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,600
You miss the past too much.

248
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,700
Who doesn't miss their youth?

249
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,000
You are still young.

250
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:25,300
Back then, you were just a child.

251
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,800
Now, you are going to be Coach Luo.

252
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,000
Okay.

253
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,100
Go and sleep.

254
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,300
Look at you.

255
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,500
It's just a short distance back to the hotel.

256
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,500
But you took so long to walk, the sun almost rose.

257
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,300
I was being considerate of you.

258
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,400
I was afraid all the exercise today

259
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,700
might be too much for someone your age.

260
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,700
Good night.

261
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,000
How about we have a sunrise competition tomorrow?

262
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,900
Let's see who's old.

263
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,100
It's on.

264
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,400
I'm not afraid of you.

265
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,900
Bye bye.

266
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,900
Duan Yu Cheng.

267
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,000
What is it?

268
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,300
Tell me the truth.

269
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,900
Do you like Shi Yin or not?

270
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,700
Jia Shi Li!

271
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,300
[Senior Brother]

272
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,300
Hello?

273
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,400
Hello.

274
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,400
You are still asleep, right?

275
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,000
Old Man.

276
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,000
From what I can hear,

277
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,600
you are still sleeping, too.

278
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,100
We should just forget about it today.

279
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,200
Let's just admit we're old.

280
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,300
Sure.

281
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,300
That's why we get along well.

282
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,800
Are your legs sore?

283
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,100
No.

284
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,100
Tell me the truth.

285
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,000
Are your legs sore?

286
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,300
No.

287
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,400
Okay now. Go back to sleep.

288
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,700
I'll go back to sleep, too.

289
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,200
Duan Yu Cheng.

290
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,500
Will you take the cable car with us today?

291
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,800
Did I do something to him?

292
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,900
Why is he acting weird suddenly?

293
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,000
What do you want to eat later?

294
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,600
Let's just eat something simple.

295
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,200
There is still afternoon training.

296
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,000
Training right after the trip?

297
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,400
Coach Luo, I really want to give you a thumbs-up.

298
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,400
After the university's sports day,

299
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,400
we'll have the university provincial games.

300
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,800
Our university will offer two spots for the high jump.

301
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,800
I want to see his performance this time.

302
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,800
One spot will surely go to Jiang Tian.

303
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,600
For the other one, who's the newcomer again?

304
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,900
The tall and skinny one?

305
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,200
- Liu Shan.
- Yes.

306
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,400
Old Wang's new favorite.

307
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,400
I've seen him jump before.

308
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,100
He's not bad.

309
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
But when it comes to Jiang Tian,

310
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,600
he does so well during training.

311
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,100
But he can't perform well in real competition.

312
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,200
His family situation is not that great, to begin with.

313
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,400
Because an athlete doesn't need to pay the school fees,

314
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,800
he can get an allowance,

315
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,700
or I doubt he could attend university.

316
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,600
Last year, his mother became severely ill.

317
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,300
His whole family was waiting for him

318
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,600
to help financially with the competition prize money.

319
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,000
With so much to consider,

320
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,400
you'd be burdened with stress, too.

321
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,200
Last year,

322
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,000
you helped him apply for a scholarship, right?

323
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,700
I'm sure that will help him.

324
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,500
Hopefully.

325
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,860
[Coach, I want to take a few days off.]

326
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,760
What's wrong?

327
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,140
Duan Yu Cheng wants to take a few days off?

328
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,680
He finally got two days of holiday because of National Day.

329
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,270
Let the child rest.

330
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,760
Let's use this chance to go and eat something nice.

331
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,030
We need sustenance.

332
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:16,820
This is not right. Something is wrong with him.

333
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:20,490

00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,200
I need to maintain my training.

497
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,500
You can do some exercises

498
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,300
that don't put pressure on your ankle.

499
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,600
Resume training gradually.

500
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,400
You can't rush it,

501
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,900
in case it affects the ligament's healing process.

502
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,000
Besides that, eat more food

503
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,800
high in protein and calcium,

504
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,700
including vegetables and fruit.

505
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,300
He is physically fit.

506
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,800
And the injury is not too serious.

507
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,800
If he rests well,

508
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,800
it'll take him around three weeks to heal.

509
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,600
"Three weeks"? Doctor,

510
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,700
if I rest for three weeks...

511
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,400
If he tells you to rest, you should rest.

512
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,800
You don't have to train anymore.

513
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,400
Coach.

514
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,900
What did you mean just now?

515
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,200
Did you mean

516
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,800
to focus on recovery first

517
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,200
before I think about my training?

518
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,700
Don't worry.

519
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,000
I'm a good patient.

520
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,400
I'll listen to the doctor.

521
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,800
You got injured under my care when I'm your coach.

522
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,500
I'm responsible for this.

523
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,200
Tomorrow, you'll be under the team physicians' care.

524
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,600
I'll ask them to take good care of you.

525
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,600
But

526
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,100
after you recover,

527
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,600
I won't be your coach anymore.

528
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,000
Whether or not you want to continue training

529
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,700
or whom you will train with,

530
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,800
it's not my business anymore.

531
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,200
Don't do that, Coach.

532
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,200
I-I realize my mistake.

533
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,600
I will make amends.

534
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,100
Don't be angry, okay?

535
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,800
Why should I be angry?

536
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,200
Don't give up on me then.

537
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,400
You are my only coach.

538
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,900
I want only you to train me.

539
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,800
I told you clearly

540
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,000
about the condition for me to be your coach.

541
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,200
We two should trust each other,

542
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,500
no secrets and no lies.

543
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,300
I trusted you.

544
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,800
But what about you?

545
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,600
I just didn't want you to worry.

546
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,200
I can't coach someone like you.

547
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,000
Coach, can you give me another chance?

548
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,900
I promise not to do it again.

549
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,200
I still have things to do.

550
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,700
I'll ask someone to bring you food later.

551
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,800
Have someone take you to the university tonight.

552
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,300
Coach.

553
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,000
Coach.

554
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,800
Coach Luo!

555
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,600
[South Lake Bo'ai Hospital]

556
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,000
Come. Eat.

557
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,300
I don't want to eat.

558
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,300
You've caused Coach Luo

559
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,000
much trouble this time.

560
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,000
I apologized to her.

561
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,800
Really?

562
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,100
Child, you are too ignorant.

563
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,500
Get up and eat.

564
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,800
Are you very close to Coach Luo?

565
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,000
Yes.

566
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
You know we two go back a long way.

567
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,000
Then,

568
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,300
are you her boyfriend?

569
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,600
Is it that obvious?

570
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,800
Is it true?

571
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,400
No.

572
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,600
I'm not her boyfriend yet.

573
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,800
Should you be worried about this?

574
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,000
Because of you,

575
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,600
do you know how badly Coach Luo got lectured by Old Wang?

576
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,200
Luckily, it was just a university sports day.

577
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,500
If it was a major competition,

578
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,500
Coach Luo's coaching career

579
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:42,600
would have ended due to you.

580
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,200
If you want to annoy her, go ahead and send it.

581

[Coach Luo, can we talk?]

582
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,800
Will you eat or not?

583
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:07,600
If you won't eat, I'll get your hospital discharge now.
