[Episode 12]

4
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,300
I want all the buns.

5
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,200
Coming right up.

6
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,800
And give me four tofu puddings

7
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,000
and eight fried dough-sticks.

8
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,800
Eight fried dough-sticks, sure.

9
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,000
Thank you.

10
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:58,000
One portion of steam dumplings too, please.

11
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Steam dumplings,

12
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
okay.

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,400
Thank you.

14
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,100
Duan Yu Cheng?

15
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,400
You dare to show your face here?

16
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,400
Don't you know—

17
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,200
Calm down.

18
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,400
- You drunkard.
- Calm down.

19
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,400
I was worried sick, you know?

20
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,900
I know. I messed up.

21
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,600
So I bought all of you breakfast

22
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,000
to make it up to you.

23
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,500
Soy milk and fried dough-sticks, they're delicious.

24
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,000
We thought you were dead!

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,400
- Don't think we will let you off just with these.
- Wait.

26
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,600
You think fried dough-sticks will do?

27
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,900
- Fried dough-sticks?
- I was fine.

28
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,500
Th-That can't kill me.

29
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,800
I grew up by the sea.

30
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,800
I'm a good swimmer.

31
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,800
So I can't possibly...

32
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,500
But that event traumatized us.

33
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,000
And the soy milk you bought is the sweet one.

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,400
Okay, I'll buy the salty one.

35
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,000
Stop right there!

36
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,300
Do you know what you did wrong now?

37
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,200
- I...
- Do you regard us as your good friends or not?

38
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,200
You gave us a huge scare,

39
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,800
and we didn't even know why!

40
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,800
Why?

41
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,400
Just because we're old men,

42
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,800
we won't be able to understand your youthful, wistful thoughts?

43
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,800
Let's hear him out.

44
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,900
Tell us now. Hurry.

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,600
I'll come clean.

46
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:11,400
I did plan to quit sports and focus on my studies.

47
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,800
It seems you had an epiphany.

48
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,800
Will you return to our warm, happy family now?

49
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,400
I did have an epiphany.

50
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,600
I will continue doing sports.

51
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,000
- You...
- But this doesn't mean

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,200
we're not a warm, happy family.

53
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,400
Right?

54
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,500
All right.

55
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,000
Don't be angry, okay?

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,400
Now that you're back,

57
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,700
it'll be harder for me to get Shi Yin's attention.

58
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,500
Coach!

59
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,200
- You have sobered up.
- Quiet.

60
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,500
All right, I won't snitch on you.

61
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,900
I hope

62
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,200
I didn't do anything inappropriate yesterday.

63
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,400
Other than clinging to my arm and begging for forgiveness,

64
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,400
you passed out on my bed for a night.

65
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,000
Nothing else.

66
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,300
You could have kicked me off the bed.

67
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,000
I can sleep soundly on the floor too.

68
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,400
You're a big guy.

69
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,800
I won't be able to move you.

70
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,100
What's so funny?

71
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,700
Thanks, Coach.

72
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,900
No need.

73
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,000
Don't let there be a next time.

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,200
I thanked you for helping me get my medal back.

75
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,600
If not for your intervention,

76
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,200
I might have quit it for good.

77
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,300
Do you have to win first place to continue doing sports?

78
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,100
I admit

79
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,400
that race took up all my mind for a period of time.

80
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,800
That must be when Mao Mao Qi arrived.

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
But I have come to a realization.

82
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,200
I like track and field, and that's why I'm here.

83
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,000
Regardless of the match outcome

84
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,800
or who my opponent is,

85
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,000
as long as I still love track and field,

86
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,100
I'll be here.

87
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,100
Don't worry.

88
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,800
Track and field is an all-inclusive sport.

89
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,200
As long as you want to be here,

90
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,800
there will be a place for you.

91
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,800
Train hard now.

92
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,100
Cannonball!

93
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,700
Have you heard?

94
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,200
Someone jumped into the river yesterday.

95
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,600
He got all soaked like a drenched chicken

96
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,400
and made a scene in the street.

97
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,600
Some said the victim was possessed due to a breakup.

98
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,700
Oh, no, what do we do?

99
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,200
Ghosts also have standards

100
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,800
before they pick their target.

101
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,200
Seeing your cluelessness,

102
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,900
I'm sure the ghost won't possess you at all.

103
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,600
It's not a suicide due to a breakup.

104
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,800
- Coach Luo.
- Coach Luo.

105
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,600
But a student did jump into the river

106
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,500
because of drunkenness.

107
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,500
You know the details, Coach Luo?

108
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,600
A boy or a girl? From which faculty?

109
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,400
Faculty of Economics and Management, I heard.

110
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,300
Do you know the student?

111
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,800
I...

112
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,200
Is the person in the same faculty as yours, Senior?

113
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,400
So?

114
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,600
Is the person dead?

115
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,800
"Dead"? No.

116
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,700
That one is living quite well.

117
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,800
Oh, Mr. Duan.

118
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,700
You came to train today.

119
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,400
You come and go whenever you like.

120
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,100
It's almost as if you own the track and field team.

121
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,500
Sorry.

122
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,000
I made a mistake.

123
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,800
I won't repeat it again.

124
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,800
You guys are acting really weird.

125
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,500
How so?

126
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:35,000
Senior Liu is taking the initiative to care about Senior Duan.

127
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,200
And Senior Duan is acting even stranger.

128
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,000
He actually apologized to Senior Liu.

129
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,400
I don't care about him.

130
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,200
It doesn't matter if he's here or not.

131
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,600
All right, enough.

132
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,500
Warm up now.

133
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,300
- Yes. Coach.
- Let's go.

134
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,000
What about me?

135
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,200
Do some basic training.

136
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,400
I'll think about your transfer.

137
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,000
You'll have your answer after final exams.

138
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Okay.

139
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,300
Go now.

140
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,000
This baby of mine,

141
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,600
I have to carry it properly.

142
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,000
I took good care of it.

[Yougong Academy]

144
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,200
Are you leaving now?

145
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,200
Where's Old Hu?

146
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,400
He took the morning bus and went back.

147
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,300
What about you?

148
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,300
Are you not going home?

149
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm not going home this summer break.

150
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,800
I have to train with my team.

151
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,800
Wonderful.

152
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,200
Take care of my baby then.

153
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,000
Don't water it too often.

154
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,800
Take care of it.

155
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,800
- See you.
- Okay.

156
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,600
Take care of yourself and my baby.

157
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,800
- Okay.
- Bye.

158
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,000
See you after summer break.

159
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,600
Morning.

160
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,700
It's summer break now.

161
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,700
I'll move in to stay with you guys.

162
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,000
Who let you in?

Hold this for me.

Thank you.

165
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,400
You sure made yourself at home quickly.

166
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm fine with it.

167
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,800
Do you know Mao Mao Qi cleared 2.24 m in high jump?

168
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,500
Do you know I cleared 2.2 m then?

169

Thank you.

All right. Come down now.

Careful.

174
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,400
Why haven't you been training with us lately?

175
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,100
I don't see you everyday anymore.

176
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,200
What else can the reason be?

177
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,400
He's not good enough for the high jump team.

178
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,400
When did you last cut your hair?

179
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,800
You should find time to get a hair cut.

180
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,800
Take me to the barber then.

181
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,000
Okay.

182
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,000
It's great that you're back.

183
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,200
I guess both of us here aren't good enough for him,

No, Coach.

Shot put is not good.

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,800
Javelin is decent.

235
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,200
Your performance is on par with a second-tier athlete.

236

What do you think?

237
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,500
Bench press limit?

238
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,400
It's 97 kg (214 lbs).

239
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,500
And that's without any professional training.

240
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,400
Your upper body strength is above average,

241
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,600
perfect for short bursts.

242
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,000
Of course.

243

Coach,

245
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I did train for javelin throwing when I was in high school.

246
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,700
If you want me to switch to throwing,

247
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,100
I think javelin will suit me well.

248
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,200
What do you think?

249
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,700
Among throwing sports athletes,

250
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,100
javelin throwers usually have a better physique, isn't it?

251
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,400
So you saw through that.

252
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,800
Oh, well.

253
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,800
So what do you want me to train, Coach?

254
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,400
Javelin? Discus? Shot put?

255
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,500
What is going on?

256
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,400

What is making you so happy?

294
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,200
Are you interested in switching to decathlon (10 events)?

295
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,700
"Decathlon"?

296
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,000
This idea has always been in my mind,

297
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,200
but the university doesn't have this program.

298
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,800
No one can coach you.

299
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,200
But then I heard

300
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,200
Coach Yang Jin has retired.

301
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,900
Do you know him?

302
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,800
He was a decathlon coach in my sports school.

303
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,600
He's experienced and reputable nationwide.

304
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,200
I talked to Director Wang and invited Coach Yang here.

305
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,400
So your business trip back then was to meet him?

306
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,600
Yes.

307
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,200
He turned me down at first.

308
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,800
But I kept pestering him.

309
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,700
He then said he would decide after your performance evaluation.

310
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,700
It wasn't fixed in stone yet so I didn't tell you.

311
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,200
But he called me just now

312
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:32,200
and agreed to coach you after he saw your video.

313
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,700
Director Wang is fine with this.

314
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,100
Coach Yang is willing to teach you.

315
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,800
So what do you think?

316
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,200
I...

317
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,200
Decathlon will be challenging.

318
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,800
But you are a well-rounded athlete with good stamina.

319
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,200
I have met many athletes

320
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,400
but none excels in as many areas as you do.

321
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,700
Besides, you love high jump with a passion.

322
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,800
Of course,

323
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,400
if you don't want this,

324
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,600
you can switch to 100-meter sprint.

325
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,800
Why are you smiling?

326
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,000
Are you up for it or not?

327
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,600
What?

328
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,500
Is it that emotional?

329
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,200
No.

330
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,100
I just didn't expect

331
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,000
to be able to do high jump again.

332
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,700
I didn't expect you

333
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,600
to do this much for me either.

334
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,600
Of course, I would do this.

335
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,600
I am your coach.

336
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,900
Decathlon?

337
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,600
Do we have a decathlon coach here?

338
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,800
Coach Luo found one specifically for me.

339

You're amazing, Brother Cheng.

341
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,400
You can be a decathlon athlete.

342
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,000
Amazing, as if.

343
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,400
Only those who are bad at high jump do decathlon.

344
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,200
Decathlon is not easy.

345
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,100
It has ten events.

346
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,400
Other than high jump,

347
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,400
you have 100-meter sprint,

348
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,000
- 110-meter hurdles...
- Shut up.

Why are you smiling?

Don't get ahead of yourself now.

351
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,600
You just rely on Coach Luo doting on you.

352
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,800
And you think you're above everyone else.

353
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,400
No, wait. This is called "bullying others due to one's powerful backing" (idiom).

354
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,200
That's not accurate either.

355
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,800
How do you say that again?

356
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,900
You're all cocky because you know

357
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,900
- you're someone's favorite.
- "Smug due to another's devotion" (idiom).

358
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,500
Yes, "Smug due to another's devotion."

359
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,200
That's you.

360
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,400
However,

Coach Luo dotes on me?

363
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,200
So you still have the nerve to ask this.

Coach Yang values both theory and practice.

385
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,200
Although most coaches won't normally ask

386
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,800
an athlete to read books on theory,

387
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,400
it's best to have basic understanding.

388

That way, when you talk to him,

389
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,700
you can understand better what he's saying.

keep a proper sleeping schedule and balanced diet.

That's a trivial matter, insignificant.

Yes, Coach Yang.

459

There's nothing on my bed, Director.

476

00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,700
I will never ever drink,

510
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,100
not even after I retire.

511
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,800
How did you read my mind?

512
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,200
That said,

513
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,000
whether you drink or not after you retire

514
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
is out of my purview (control).

515
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,500
Where will you sleep tonight then?

516
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,600
My faculty has some spare rooms.

517
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,700
It's okay. You can go back.

518
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,600
All right then.

519
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,700
Coach.

520
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,500
Good night.

521
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,400
Good night.

522
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,300
Director.

523
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,800
Last night...

524
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,700
You know,

525
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,700
the National University Games is in forty days.

526
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,800
Show me your fighting spirit.

527
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,600
Stay active.

528
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,900
Yes.

529
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,300
Director, do you want to know what happened last night?

530
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,300
What last night?

531
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,200
Don't try to guess what I am thinking.

532
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,600
Understood?

533
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,200
And you, Wu Ze.

534
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,600
You...

535
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,200
You have to set a good example.

536
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,800
You never do anything serious; don't lead the students astray.

537
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:45,000
No, Director. People look up to you more than they look up to me.

538
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,700
Don't you agree?

539
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,500
How are Duan Yu Cheng and Liu Shan doing lately?

540
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,200
Director.

541
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,300
No need to be embarrassed.

542
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,100
They are adults, too.

543
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:03,200
They will soon forget what they shouldn't remember.

544
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,000
I'm talking about serious business.

545
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,200
Stop beating around the bush.

546
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,400
Let's drop it.

547
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,200
I have a flight this afternoon.

548
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,200
I'll check out the National University Games before everyone else.

549
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,900
Do your job.

550
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,500
Your bag.

551
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,900
He fled with his tail between his legs.

552
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,800
Naturally.

553
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,600
If I got as drunk as he did last night,

554
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,100
I wouldn't dare show my face the next day.

555
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,900
I wasn't drunk.

556
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,000
All right.

557
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,200
You heard the director.

558
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,300
I'll coach the athletes.

559
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,300
I wasn't drunk.

560
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,000
Duan Yu Cheng pushed me away last night.

561
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,100
I remember that.

562
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,300
Luo Na held you in high regard.

563
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,600
She exaggerates.

564
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,500
She said you got into the Faculty of Economics and Management here on your own.

565
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,600
Yes.

566
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,600
Tell me then.

567
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,700
How familiar are you with decathlon?

568
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,900
Decathlon takes place over two days.

569
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,800
The first day includes high jump, long jump,

570
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,900
shot put, 100-meter sprint, and 400-meter race.

571
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,800
The rest is on the second day.

572
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,100
A 1,500-meter race is the final event.

573
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,000
Usually, after the first nine events,

574
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,800
we won't have much stamina for the final event.

575
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,600
That 1,500-meter (0.9 mile) race is a trial of our will.

576
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,200
You know it well.

577
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,000
Teacher Luo gave me some books.

578
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I skimmed through them.

579
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,300
Those professional books are meant for coaches.

580
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,200
Teacher Luo said I was a quick learner

581
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,500
so I could progress faster.

582
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,800
Right teaching method to the right person,

583
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,200
I see she devotes a lot to you.

584
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,500
Have you done all of them at once?

585
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:49,700
No. But I have trained for each event.

586
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,300
Since you like studying that much,

587
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,200
study more then.

588
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,400
Many factors affect

589
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,600
one's overall performance in the decathlon.

590
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,700
I have some international research papers on it over these years.

591
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,100
Read through them.

592
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,600
I will go through your sports history

593
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,500
to devise your training program.

594
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,700
Okay.

595
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,300
Go then.

596
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,100
No training for today?

597
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,700
I told you to study.

598
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,400
Are three days enough?

599
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,400
Yes.

600
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,000
I'll study first then, Coach.

601
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,200
Bye.

602
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,900
I'll give you an exam after three days.

603
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,500
Sure. And I'll surprise you.

604
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,600
You're here.

605
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,000
Are you near-sighted?

606
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,800
A bit.

607
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,100
I never saw you wear glasses.

608
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,600
I usually wear contact lenses.

609
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,500
But I do wear glasses occasionally.

610
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,800
Is it Coach Yang's assignment?

611
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:55,900
Decathlon training methods and studies on their structure.

612
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,800
Go ahead then.

613
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,900
I won't bother you.

614
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,000
It's okay.

615
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,300
It's almost lunch break.

616
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,800
Have a rest here.

617
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,500
Do you know you need to study anatomy

618
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,600
to prepare for decathlon?

619
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,100
Of course, I do.

620
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,400
If I didn't know that,

621
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,900
how could I become a graduate student?

622
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:27,600
However, I do not know much about the anatomy class

623
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:31,000
a decathlon athlete has to study.

624
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
After all, you're

625
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,300
the first decathlon athlete at South Lake University.

626
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,200
Do you truly like decathlon?

627
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,200
Why do you ask?

628
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,900
No reason.

629
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,200
You fought hard to get me this opportunity.

630
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,500
I will cherish it.

631
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,700
I'm glad.
