167
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:55,060
What is considered a good jump?

168
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,629
At 2.1 m or 2.2 m?

169
00:12:57,629 --> 00:13:01,799
Why don't you tell him what a good jump is?

170
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,260
How about putting away those landing mats?

171
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,260
Let's go.

172
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,899
Why are you here instead of staying in the dormitory?

173
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:44,290
Selecting our classes.

174
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,780
- Choosing classes?
- Yes.

175
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,420
You didn't read the group messages again, right?

176
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,830
I don't check my phone while training.

177
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,909
You better hurry. If you don't pick your classes now,

178
00:13:51,909 --> 00:13:55,999
you'll be attending boring lectures by conservative professors.

179
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,071
- Scroll down.
- Down, keep going.

180
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:00,340
Scroll down.

181
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,729
This one.
[Track and Field]

182
00:14:01,729 --> 00:14:03,290
[Yan Li Li, Luo Na]

183
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:04,389
Is the class full?

184
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,709
No, no one picks this class. They can't do the class.

185
00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:09,369
No one takes the track and field classes in the summer. Only madmen do it.

186
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:11,980
We'll take the class.

187
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,439
What? Are you crazy? Ace Student Han.

188
00:14:14,439 --> 00:14:16,240
No, I can't. I have only one more class to register for.

189
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,470
The e-commerce economics class will open for registration in a minute.

190
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,260
Come on.

191
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,910
A 400-yuan ($55) library card?

192
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,490
One month's lunch.

193
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,980
Why didn't I get any perks?

194
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,860
How about this?

195
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,420
I didn't register for any classes yet.

196
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,810
I'll register for e-commerce economics, and you'll attend classes.

197
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:35,050
You'll take the track and field class with me.

198
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,360
Deal.

199
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,140
Hu Jun Xiao.

200
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,340
My student number is 2015013035.

201
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,990
It's the default password. Go away.

202
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,510
Fine, continue sleeping.

203
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,450
Oh my gosh.

204
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:00,100
Shi Yin just texted me.

205
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,290
What did she say?

206
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,040
[What classes did Duan Yu Cheng register for?]

207
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,390
It's nothing.

208
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,730
Okay.

209
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,770
Good morning, Coach Luo.

210
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:33,739
I didn't know physical training was popular with finance students.

211
00:15:33,739 --> 00:15:35,989
Teacher, I joined because of Shi Yin.

212
00:15:35,989 --> 00:15:37,580
I'm here due to Duan Yu Cheng.

213
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:40,340
He says working out can improve one's fitness.

214
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,680
- I'm here because...
- I didn't ask you.

215
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,120
Mr. Yan was supposed to teach this class.

216
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,120
But last minute, he's in Jiang Zhou for an exchange program.

217
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,539
So I'm substituting for him. My name is Luo Na.

218
00:15:49,539 --> 00:15:51,289
- Hello, Ms. Luo.
- Hello, Ms. Luo.

219
00:15:51,289 --> 00:15:53,150
Hello, Ms. Luo.

220
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,539
Enough. Stop slacking off.

221
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:56,740
Start moving around.

222
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,690
Ms, Luo, it's too hot.

223
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,140
Detox through sweat.

224
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,800
Don't you know summer alleviates colds?

225
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,290
Enough excuses. Gather around.

226
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,430
Gather around.

227
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:09,229
Guys, gather around! Time for class.

228
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,510
It's too hot.

229
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,620
Stand here.

230
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,710
I'll take attendance.

231
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:21,369
- Sun Jie Ping.
- Here.

232
00:16:21,369 --> 00:16:23,749
- Han Dai.
- Present.

233
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:25,560
Su Chen Yu.

234
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,220
Luo Na!

235
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,590
Come on. Hurry.

236
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:44,300
Duan Yu Cheng.

237
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:47,800
Duan Yu Cheng.

238
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,540
What are you looking at?

239
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:54,779
What was Coach Wu's 100-meter sprint record while still active?

240
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:56,650
What?

241
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:00,630
Nothing. I'm just curious.

242
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:08,490
His last race's record for 100 m before he retired was 10.27 seconds.

243
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,339
At 10.27 seconds?

244
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,330
Was it an electronic timer?

245
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,790
Yes.

246
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,630
Does he not look like it?

247
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:17,790
Coach Wu almost joined the national team.

248
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,420
Enough talking. Let's start class.

249
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:22,979
Duan Yu Cheng, lead everyone and run 1,500 meters as a warm-up.

250
00:17:22,979 --> 00:17:24,800
What, 1,500 meters (0.09 miles)?

251
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,570
Follow my lead.

252
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:51,140
Hurry.

253
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:11,090
Duan Yu Cheng!

254
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,610
What? What is it?

255
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:14,070
Why are you still running?

256
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:16,720
- We're not done yet.
- You're two laps ahead of us.

257
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,110
We're dying out here due to you.

258
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,409
Sorry about that. I didn't notice.

259
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,540
It's just 10.27 seconds.

260
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,710
You can do it, too.

261
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:32,180
But my best record for the 100-meter sprint

262
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,770
was only 11.03 seconds.

263
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:37,240
At 11.03 seconds?

264
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,760
Isn't it just one-second slower?

265
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,460
Lippincott's personal best in 100 m was 10.6 seconds

266
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,840
and Bolt's record was 9.58 seconds.

267
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,470
Do you know how long it took him to beat that one-second record?

268
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:50,430
It was 97 years.

269
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:54,640
In that case,

270
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,929
I guess there's a 94-95 years gap between you and Coach Wu.

271
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,339
Are you done running?

272
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,650
Yes, Ms. Luo.

273
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:08,930
We've finished running.

274
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:12,059
Okay. We'll begin the class now.

275
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,330
I thought the class was over.

276
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,050
Get up.

277
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:19,720
I'm too tired.

278
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:27,399
In a 100-meter sprint; the starting block is the most important part.

279
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:30,690
Starting blocks are especially crucial

280
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:32,770
when it comes to weaker Asian athletes.

281
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:36,839
Now, the world is using a crouching position at starting blocks.

282
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:40,459
This position reduces the gap in weight shifting.

283
00:19:40,459 --> 00:19:43,040
Your preferred leg is placed on the front footplate.

284
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,200
The distance from the front of the starter is usually one step.

285
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,800
Your foot angle from the ground should be between 60 and 80 degrees.

286
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:55,270
Keep your hands slightly wider than your shoulders.

287
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:59,510
On the "get set" command, raise your hips higher than your shoulders.

288
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,090
Propel your body forward.

289
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,580
Get set.

290
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,000
Duan, that was cool.

291
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,300
You are no less than those who sing love songs with their guitars.

292
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,400
That's a lame metaphor.

293
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,500
Duan Yu Cheng, can you teach me?

294
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,200
Me, too.

295
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,400
But I specialize in high jump.

296
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,200
I'm not good at sprinting.

297
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,800
It's okay as long as you're serious about it.

298
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,300
Okay.

299
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,600
All right.

300
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,000
We have more than ten minutes before the class is over.

301
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,500
We'll split into two teams.

302
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,400
The girls' team and the boys' team.

303
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,500
I'll leave the girls to you.

304
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,400
Guide them well, Mr. Duan.

305
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,800
Don't try to fool them.

306
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,100
- Come on. The boys can come with me.
- Coach.

307
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,600
Mr. Duan, teach us.

308
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,100
Please teach us.

309
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,000
- Teach us.
- Okay.

310
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,200
Class is over.

311
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,800
You can go now.

312
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,900
Coach, wait here.

313
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,800
Why?

314
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,700
Just wait for me.

315
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,600
Coach, catch it!

316
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,600
What's wrong with you?

317
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,900
We make a very good team, too.

318
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,600
Generation gap.

319
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,000
It's harder to understand

320
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,400
young people nowadays.

321
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,200
Miss, how old are you?

322
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,200
It's "Coach" to you.

323
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,700
Coach, how old are you?

324
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,400
I'm 18.

325
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,400
What's wrong?

326
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,000
I think the dust got into my eyes.

327
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,300
Stop touching it.

328
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,000
Don't rub your eye.

329
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,300
Sit here.

330

00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,800
Let's go and relax.

499
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,000
No.

500
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,200
I'm tired.

501
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,800
Just have fun for a couple of days.

502
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:04,000
If you don't want to move,

503
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,800
you can just sleep at the hotel.

504
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,700
Don't think too much.

505
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,200
I've already made the hotel reservation.

506
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,000
The tickets are expensive, non-refundable.

507
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,200
Nice!

508
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,400
That's all for today's class.

509
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,100
Class dismissed.

510
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,400
Coach,

511
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,900
they said you're going on a trip.

512
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:32,800
Yes.

513
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,200
Where are you going?

514
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,200
Hiking.

515
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,600
Are you going to Mount Yuanming?

516
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,700
But I'm going on the fourth.

517
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,200
If you need anything,

518
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,900
you can come to me.

519
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,200
Coach, what a coincidence.

520
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,700
I have a group of friends

521
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,600
who are planning to go to Mount Yuanming, too.

522
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,100
They're also going on the fourth

523
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,600
to avoid peak season.

524
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,000
I was the first to register for the trip.

525
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,600
You're quite lively

527

Shi Yin,

528
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,800
didn't... didn't you say

529
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,200
you wanted to organize a trip to Mount Yuanming?

530
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,600
I want to go.

531
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,600
When are we leaving?

532
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,800
Did you say you were not going

533
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,500
since you have training?

534
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,800
I'm free now.

535
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,000
Count me in.

536
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,200
But we only chartered a commercial vehicle.

537
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,900
There might not be enough seats.

538
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:34,800
Jia Shi Li alone has to occupy two seats.

539
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,300
It's okay.

540
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,600
I can sit on his lap.

541
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,400
If it doesn't work, we'll just charter another bus.

542
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,600
I'll pay for it.

543
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,200
Is that okay?

544
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,600
Then all right.

545
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,600
You signed up in time.

Okay. Call me when you need a ride back to the city.

Okay.

when we could just stay comfortably at university?

562

We're here to experience it.

Coach, have you arrived?

571
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,600
Yes.

572
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,200
I just reached the entrance.

573
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,800
But I don't see you.

574
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,100
Are you at the south or north gate?

575
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,000
I think I'm at the south gate.

576
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,600
No wonder. I'm at the north gate.

577
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,000
I'll go and find you.

578
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,600
No need.

579
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,900
We're hiking the mountain, right?

580
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,800
We'll just meet at the peak.

581
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,000
Aren't you going to hike with me?

582
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,900
Let's talk later.

583
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,800
I'll start hiking now.

584
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,800
Don't hang up.

585
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,400
You'll hike the mountain, right?

586
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,000
Let's have a race and see who reaches the peak first.

587
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,800
It's ten o'clock now.

588
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,200
I'll wait at the peak to have lunch with you.

589
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,600
"Lunch"?

590
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,400
The steep trail is more than 2,000 m (1.3 miles).

591
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,800
You need at least three hours to complete it.

592
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,800
Are you guys taking the cable car?

593
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,800
No one is taking the cable car.

594
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,800
Can't you reach the peak in an hour and a half?

595
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,000
"An hour and a half"?

596

I thought you were 18.

597
