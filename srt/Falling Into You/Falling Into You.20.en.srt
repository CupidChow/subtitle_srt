I want to go out and play.

7
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,200
I've been training for over ten days.

8
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,200
And now, I finally have a half-day break.

9
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,800
What gives you guys the right to lock me up?

10
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,800
Over, over, over!

11
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,400
That was too fast.

12
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,300
You should go easy on me.

13
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,900
I have a longer reach.

14
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,400
I haven't even started yet. What the heck?

- This one.

17
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,500
- Get yourself equipped.
- Okay.

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,200
Buy this pair of shoes.

19

If I don't get to play, you guys won't play, either!

I told you no playing.

21
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,100
Everyone can go out and play, except you.

22
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,700
You only create trouble when you go out.

23

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,600
Fine, you can play this.

You're so annoying. You should go outside.

Hey, how could you not follow your principles?

Didn't we agree to keep an eye on him together?

I haven't finished my sentence.

You can't go out alone.

33
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,000
Either your coach

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,700
or your fellow athlete must go with you.

35
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,200
Must I take someone else along?

36
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,500

Why are you keeping me company?

42
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,100
I'm doing it to keep an eye on you.

43

Do you need two people to keep an eye on me?

Coach Luo said she booked a cab for you guys.

51

The price is the same no matter if it's two or three passengers.

- It's 50 yuan ($7).
- All right.

I'll take three of them.

I forgot. I'll pay you back later.

You don't need to pay right now. You can pay after the ride.

- Brilliant!

He said 50 yuan, right?

100
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,500
It's 500 yuan ($72).

What?

It's 500 yuan.

103
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,200
Are you extorting us now?

104
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,700
Is it 500 yuan for a stupid ride like that?

105
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,800
Each has to pay 500 yuan.

106
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,200
It's 1,500 yuan in total.

107

Mister,

108
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,600
that wasn't what you said just now.

109
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,000
What did I say? I've already told you the price.

110
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,800
Wait.

111
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,200
Mister,

112
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,200
you told us it was 50 yuan per ride when you were lying down.

113
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,600
That's what you said.

114
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,400
I always said it was 500 yuan.

115
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,500
Fine then.

116
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,600
Then 500 yuan it is.

117
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,200
Wait a moment.

118
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,500
So he can charge us however much he wants?

119
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,400
I won't let him have his way today.

00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,000
Wait.

121

122

Shut up!

What?

135
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Try me if you dare.

136
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,300
See if I'll retaliate. Let's see who's the better fighter.

137
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,100
Get out of the way!

138

Get out of the way! You two, don't touch me!

Don't move!

141

Say another word,

142
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,400
and I'll thrash your shop.

143
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,200
Screw you!

144
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,000
- That's enough!
- Don't touch me!

145

- Get up!
- Li Ge, that's enough!

-What do you want?
-Li Ge!

Come to the shop!

151

- What do you mean by that?
- Someone's causing trouble.

152
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,400
I'll thrash your shop!

153
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,000
- Get up!
- Come immediately!

154
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,200
Are you calling for help?

155
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,000
Give me your phone!

156
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,500
Stop!

00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,400
Just you wait!

158

- Are you out of your mind?
- What are you doing?

159
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,000
I'll teach you a lesson!

160
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,500
For 1,500 yuan? I'll burn 1,500 heck dollars for you!

161
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,600
Stop it! Let's go!

162
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,600
That kick was quite strong.

163
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,600
I would have thrashed his shop

164

if you guys hadn't stopped me.

165
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,200

Duan Yu Cheng, what should we do?

168
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,000
Let's run.

169
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,200
Come on.

170
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,600
Let's run.

171
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,200
Li Ge.

172
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,800
Li Ge!

173
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,200
Listen!

174
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,500
I couldn't care less about you

175
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,400
if it weren't for Coach Luo!

176
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,600
Run away! Did you hear me?

177
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,500
You two can leave. I'll handle this alone.

178
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,000
- It's none of your business.
- Let's just go.

179
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Li Ge.

180
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,800
Li Ge!

181
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,800
- Liu Shan!
- Let's leave now.

182
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,800
Just leave.

183
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,400
Call Wu Ze immediately once you get in the car.

184
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,400
Tell him to come here immediately.

185
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,700
What will you two do then?

186
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,400
Forget about us. Just go.

187
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,100
Go!

188
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,900
Hang in there, I'll return soon.

189
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,600
Hang in there!

190
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,000
Stop right there!

191
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,500
Don't run!

192
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,100
Stop right there!

193
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,100
- Stop right there!
- Stop!

194
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,000
You're giving away our tower for free.

195
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,200
How should I know? The creeps are faster than me.

196
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,600
Seems like you're not that good.

197
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm here.

198
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,500
I'm here.

199
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,500
Hello?

200
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,600
All right, I got it.

201
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,600
It's your win.

202
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,100
What's wrong?

203
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,700
My friend is coming to South Lake.

204
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,400
I need to meet up with him.

205
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,600
Which friend?

206
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,300
You don't know him.

207
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,600
Lock the door.

208
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,200
We can talk this over.

209
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,300
Don't hurt us!

210
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,200
If 1,500 yuan isn't enough, we can pay you guys more.

211
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,600
Fine.

212
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,400
Pay us 50,000 yuan ($7,200).

213
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,400
How much?

214
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,400
¥50,000?

215
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,800
I'll burn 50,000 heck dollars for you!

216
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,200
You can buy a coffin with that money!

217
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,200
You're quite smug, aren't you?

218
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,400
- I dare you!
- You're quite smug.

219
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,600
Hit me again if you dare!

220
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,500
So what if I'm hitting you?

221
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,000
Li Ge!

222
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Are you crazy?

223
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,200
Do you still wish to compete or not?

224
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,400
Compete, my foot!

225
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,700
This is daylight robbery!

226
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,600
They're local bullies!

227
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,800
Come on!

228
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,200
Hit me again if you dare!

229
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,000
Did you hear me?

230
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,800
Coach Wu.

231
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,400
Where are they?

232
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,200
They're down there.

233
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,600
Wait for me in the car.

234
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,000
But I...

235
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,800
You're tough, right?

236
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,200
Don't touch us.

237
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,600
If not, I'll call the cops.

238
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,900
We're athletes.

239
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,000
You can't bear the consequences if something happens to us.

240
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,300
"Call the cops"?

241
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,600
You guys are athletes, right?

242
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,800
Fine.

243
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,600
Raise his leg!

244
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,800
You're an athlete, right?

245
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,800
I'll break your legs!

246
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,000
Don't touch him!

247
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Call the cops, right?

248
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,400
Raise his leg! Hold it in place!

249
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,800
- Li Ge!
- Come on!

250
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,000
I'll break your leg!

251
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,800
Do you believe me?

252
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,600
Li Ge!

253
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,700
Come on! Put your back into it!

254
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,200
Who are you?

255
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,100
Guys, I'm their coach.

256
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,400
They're insensible children.

257
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,400
Sorry for the trouble.

258
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,500
He gave my brother a thrashing.

259
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,800
It's not too much for us to ask for compensation, right?

260
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,000
Coach,

261
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,800
they demanded 50,000 yuan from us.

262
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,400
Money isn't an issue here.

263
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,000
Were you guys hurt

264
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,600
anywhere else besides your faces?

265
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
They're athletes.

266
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,200
They will participate in a national competition very soon.

267
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,400
We have to make sure they perform well.

268
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,800
What about this?

269
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,400
You guys should release them first.

270
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,800
Let me see if they've got any other injuries.

271
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,200
We can talk if they haven't.

272
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,000
Who are you trying to scare here?

273
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,300
What if they are injured?

274
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,000
If so, they are useless to me.

275
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,500
You can have them then.

276
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,800
You guys can do whatever you want with them.

277
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,800
But here's a friendly reminder.

278
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,400
Although they may be useless,

279
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,500
they're registered as professional athletes.

280
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,400
If something happens to them, you guys will pay for it.

281
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,000
You guys can do as you see fit.

282
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,200
Cut the crap.

283
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,600
Give us 50,000 yuan,

284
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,800
not a single cent less.

285
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,500
Understood?

286
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,900
I only have

287
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,800
2,000 yuan on me.

288
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,700
You're the boss, right?

289
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,600
Take this.

290
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,600
Don't you understand human speech?

291
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,000
I said 50,000 yuan!

292
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,900
Not a single cent less!

293
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,400
Buddy, here.

294
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,200
Take this.

295
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,400
Wu Ze!

296
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,800
Coach!

297
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,900
Are you okay?

298
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,400
Don't touch me.

299
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,300
Can you drive?

300
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,200
Yes.

301
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,600
Let's head to the hospital.

302
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,800
I'm fine.

303
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,800
I know what to do.

304
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,100
You have to head to the hospital.

305
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,700
We can't let glass shards stay in your head.

306
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,600
I'll take them back.

307
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,600
After that, we'll head to the hospital.

308
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,200
Are you okay?

309
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,400
Why are you still here?

310
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,600
You guys were still there.

311
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,200
How could I leave without you guys?

312
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,400
My goodness.

313
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,800
This... How did that happen?

314
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,600
Shut up.

315
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,500
Get in the car.

316
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,400
Let's call the cops.

317
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,500
Liu Shan, get in the car.

318
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,400
Boy,

319
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,800
were you hurt anywhere else besides your face?

320
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,000
What?

321
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,400
Can't you understand when I talk to you?

322
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,200
Were you hurt?

323
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,800
I'm not hurt.

324
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,500
Let's go.

325
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:28,750
[South Lake University]

326
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,600
We're here.

327
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,300
Get out of the car.

328
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,600
Coach, I'll leave now.

329
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,500
Wait.

330
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,300
Don't tell anyone about this.

331
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,700
Okay.

332
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,200
Coach, you guys stay safe.

333
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,800
I'll head back.

334
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,300
Li Ge, wake up.

335
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,000
Just ignore him.

336
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,700
Let him continue his act.

337
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,200
