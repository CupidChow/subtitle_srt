[Adapted from the novel "Blazing Trail" by Twentine]

3
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,900
[Episode 19]

4
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,310
Stop dragging your feet; we're late again.

5
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,360
Coach Wu will scold us again.

6
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,870
What's the hurry?

7
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:50,660
There are two types of people I absolutely hate.

8
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,470
The first always get on my nerves, like Wu Ze.

9
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:56,600
The second are self-righteous people like you.

10
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,030
But of course, meticulous people like Luo Na

11
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,790
are annoying, too.

12
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,660
It's Coach Luo.

13
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,770
Something's going on.

14
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,700
None of your business.

15
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,860
Not bad.

16
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,730
Are you two together now?

17
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,410
Since when?

18
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,380
Who confessed to whom?

19
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,250
There is a 10-year gap between you, right?

20
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,150
Wait. Does your family agree with that?

21
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,700
I must admit she has all the curves.

22
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,960
No wonder all of you like her.

23
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,320
Excuse me? Watch your mouth now!

24
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,780
Calm down. It's just a joke.

25
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,220
I'm complimenting your girlfriend. Why get angry?

26
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,170
Honestly,

27
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:47,000
I thought you were just a self-righteous, boring guy.

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,590
Now that I know this,

29
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:51,200
I find you rather intriguing.

30
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,050
We can't say we're close,

31
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,110
but can we be friends?

32
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,780
Can you stay away from me?

33
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,610
You're so hostile.

34
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,580
Wu Ze loves Luo Na, too, you know?

35
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,270
It's Coach Luo!

36
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:07,650
You don't deserve to use her name!

37
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,490
How I address her is not the point.

38
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:13,170
I mean that Wu Ze is your love rival.

39
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,930
You and I are allies now.

40
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:18,210
We can work together to get rid of Wu Ze. Do you know?

41
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:21,680
That old fart insisted I move into his dorm.

42
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,710
Ask your girlfriend to persuade him to drop this.

43
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,320
Please?

44
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,190
Dude.

45
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,520
I'll call her Coach Luo, all right?

46
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,830
Wait. Do you want to work with me or not?

47
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,870
I'll tell you a secret.

48
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:39,450
Take this as a token of sincerity.

49
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:42,290
You know, on Chinese New Year's Eve,

50
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,200
they talked until late at night.

51
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,380
They get along right away.

52
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,670
Doesn't it bother you at all?

53
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,230
Just so you know,

54
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:55,700
it was I who talked to her till late at night on New Year's Eve.

55
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,910
Make up something credible

56
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:00,510
if you want to meddle in our relationship. All right?

57
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,880
Needless to say,

58
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,030
I won't believe anything you say.

59
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,700
Look.

60
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,990
Why are you guys so happy?

61
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,710
She dragged Wu Ze with her to talk to someone else.

62
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,060
- Also, this one time...
- Are you done yet?

63
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,990
You can never shut up.

64
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:22,770
We haven't formed an alliance.

65
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,600
What's wrong with you?

66
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,530
Wu Ze, that jerk,

67
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,720
makes me suffer.

68
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,950
I crashed at your dorm last night,

69
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,040
and he threw my blanket away.

70
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,760
Others can live with another athlete,

71
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,970
but I must live with him and Luo Na.

72
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,550
I mean Coach Luo.

73
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,130
What do you mean you live with him and Coach Luo?

74
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,160
They don't live together.

75
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:19,620
So you didn't know.

76
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:30,570
Director Wang wants easier access to people.

77
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,180
Now all coaches live together.

78
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,530
They are just one floor apart.

79
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,010
Your girlfriend lives next to a single man,

80
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,600
and you didn't know.

81
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,420
Watch what you say now.

82
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,360
Otherwise, I'll beat you up.

83
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,900
Go away and eat lunch.

84
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,390
A chicken drumstick for you.

85
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,130
- I'm done. See you in a bit.
- Okay.

86
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:04,350
- Hurry.
- I will.

87
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,770
It's crowded here. Why come over?

88
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,320
Tell me.

89
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,370
If Li Ge can move into your dorm, why can't I?

90
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,520
Can you lower your volume?

91
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,020
Why can't I?

92
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,540
Li Ge is not staying with us.

93
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:44,140
He's staying with Coach Wu.

94
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,600
So what?

95
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,880
Don't you want me now?

96
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,700
I'm sure you can

97
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,230
clear a room for me next to yours.

98
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,590
You know Li Ge is a special case.

99
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:00,660
Coach Wu was forced to take this measure. I can't keep Li Ge in line.

100
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,970
Do you think I will always stay in line?

101
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,900
You're an obedient athlete.

102
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,430
Chances are, I'll slip up before you do.

103
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,230
All right. Stop your tantrum.

104
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,800
Remember what you promised me?

105
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,860
I remember, of course.

106
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:21,120
But you also have to keep your promise.

107
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,170
What did I promise you?

108
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,900
The sprint team...

109
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,160
Stay away from sprint team guys.

110
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,300
Right, I didn't forget that. Don't worry.

111
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,270
I know what to do.

112
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,890
From now on, don't meet me in public

113
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:39,290
if it's nothing important. It looks bad.

114
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,980
- Then I...
- Go back and eat lunch.

115
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,560
I'm full.

116
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,830
Then take a walk somewhere.

117
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,140
What are you doing?

118
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,270
I don't feel confident about it.

119
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:11,410
It's our first tournament with little time, and the competition is important.

120
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:14,650
Check if you have done all preparations.

121
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:17,570
We need to go through our training programs again

122
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,430
to check if we missed

123
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,440
or forgot something.

124
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,950
I already made a pledge.

125
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,230
Hi, Coach!

126
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,920
Bye, Coach!

127
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,480
What?

128
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,190
Why did he do that?

129
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:36,510
I ate too much so he gave me a yogurt.

130
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,850
Truth be told,

131
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:45,010
he is quite popular right now.

132
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,570
All have their eyes on him.

133
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:49,670
When I met with the provincial team, the higher-up mentioned him.

134
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:53,550
He said a well-rounded athlete like him was hard to find.

135
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,270
He's just all right.

136
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,840
Are you being humble now?

137
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,320
He's a good boy. He cares about his coach

138
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,600
and bought you a yogurt,

139
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,450
unlike boys on the sprint team.

140
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,240
They are still eating in there.

141
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,800
They are good for nothing except eating.

142
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,190
All right. Train him well.

143
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,920
Maybe he will make it.

144
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,800
That's all

145
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,640
for the closed-door training.

146
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,210
Do you have any questions?

147
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,200
Then I hope...

148
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,600
Can we leave campus?

149
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,100
- Right.
- Yes.

150
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,520
That's right.

151
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,040
Well, I'm saying now,

152
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:40,030
we're not strictly required to stay on campus at all times.

153
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:42,250
You're free to go out when you're done

154
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,420
after the training.

155
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,610
But you must tell your coach where you go and for how long.

156
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,320
We require discipline.

157
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,640
Don't just play around.

158
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,400
- Any other questions?
- Nothing!

159
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,830
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

160
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,150
Okay.

161
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,340
I now announce

162
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,350
that 2017 closed-door training

163
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:06,440
of South Lake University's Track and Field Team begins now!

164
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,240
We will train hard

165
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,600
so you earn gold medals in National Athletics Championships!

166
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,890
Now... begin training!

167
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,980
Yes!

168
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,450
All your orders are here.

169
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,680
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

170
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:37,910
When did you start drinking milk tea?

171
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,900
Even with tapioca pearls too.

172
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,760
You don't have to drink it.

173
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,080
I'll give it a try.

174
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,120
Go. Check it out.

175
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,850
Quickly.

176
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,710
Shot put team!

177
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,720
Coach Luo, Coach Wu. Why are you still here?

178
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,700
- Don't you want to watch the match?
- What match?

179
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,380
Closed-door training is too boring so everyone is messing around.

180
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,020
Now, the sprint and high jump teams are competing.

181
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,150
It's in the diving center.

182
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,720
We'll go there first.

183
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,400
If we do this, it must be the tallest one.

184
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,600
- Come.
- To the tallest one.

185
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,200
Hurry.

186
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,600
- Don't chicken out.
- It's 8 meters (26 ft).

187
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,500
That one is 10 meters (33 ft) tall.

188
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,400
Not bad.

189
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,400
Go ahead.

190
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,900
What are we betting?

191
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,200
Anything.

192
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,400
You look like you're too scared

193
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,200
to make the dive anyway.

194
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Let's start small then.

195
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,000
- Fifty yuan ($7)?
- Five hundred yuan ($72)!

196
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,200
A monetary bet is boring.

197
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,500
We should try something else.

198
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,500
Then propose something.

199
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,100
The loser will wash the winner's socks.

200
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,700
Sure. Can do.

201
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,800
I like this one.

202
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,300
That's the bet.

203
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,600
Are you crazy?

204
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,600
What if he makes the dive?

205
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,600
We will dive, too.

206
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,400
Aren't we here to dive?

207
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,400
My friends over there!

208
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,800
Li Ge! Jump!

209
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,800
Come on.

210
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,400
Don't chicken out!

211
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,300
Jump!

212
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,600
You look scared.

213
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,400
Close your eyes and jump!

214
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,100
You're a big guy, but you're so useless.

215
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,500
Or just kneel and surrender.

216
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,700
I'll do it.

217
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,400
So?

218
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,800
Who should go first?

219
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,100
Acting tough, aren't you?

220
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,600
You're definitely washing my socks.

221
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,700
- Hurry up!
- Stop talking. Dive now!

222
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,500
Come on!

223
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,000
Get back down here now, you two!

224
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,400
The sprint team won!

225
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,600
See?

226
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,200
Aren't I amazing? Yes!

227
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,800
You lost.

228
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,100
Hold on.

229
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,900
My stinky socks,

230
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,500
wash them.

231
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,600
Don't toss them.

232
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,800
You lost.

233
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,700
I landed first.

234
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,300
You saw that?

235
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,400
I won handsomely.

236
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,400
Did you film it?

237
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,800
Did you?

238
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,300
Coach Luo is here.

239
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,100
Did you see me?

240
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,100
Were you hurt?

241
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,600
Did you see it? Did you?

242
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,600
Yes, I did.

243
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,500
What do you think?

244
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,200
The sprint team defeated the high jump team.

245
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,200
Be proud of me.

246
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,600
Duan Yu Cheng, I defeated you.

247
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,600
Wu Ze, you jerk!

248
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,200
Coach!

249
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,700
I won!

250
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,600
Great!

251
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,200
You must be joking.

252
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,400
Don't be angry.

253
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,800
I'm a good swimmer.

254
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,400
I knew what I was doing.

255
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,400
"You knew what you were doing"?

256
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,200
You're an athlete.

257
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,800
If something bad happened,

258
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,490
can you bear the consequences?

259
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,200
Besides,

260
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,300
if something did happen to you,

261
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,000
what will I do?

262
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,400
That's true.

263
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,200
Stop smiling!

264
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,400
I want to defeat him.

265
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,500
What for?

266
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,400
Will that make you jump higher or run faster?

267
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,100
Also, that's a match between the high jump and sprint teams.

268
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,500
Why were you in it?

269
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,800
People who do high jump

270
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,900
have a physical disadvantage in diving.

271
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,800
As a former high jump member,

272
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,600
I am the best candidate for diving.

273
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,000
I had to help them.

274
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It was also because Li Ge was too arrogant.

275
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,600
I wanted to shut him up.

276
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,000
I can't catch a break at all.

277
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Stay away from me!

278
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,400
Don't touch me.

279
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,400
Go away.

280
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,670
Go away.

281
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,300
Hurry and say it.

282
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,900
I'm tired. I want to sleep.

283
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,400
If you do that again,

284
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,000
I'll break your legs.

285
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,200
I call your bluff.

286
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,800
Break my legs?

287
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,900
Will you take my spot at Nationals?

288
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,400
Stop it.

289
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,600
It's just a 10-meter dive.

290
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,600
Also, I defeated him.

291
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,300
Are you proud?

292
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,600
Very.

293
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,500
Give me your stinky socks too.

294
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,900
I'll have them wash socks for you.

295
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,700
You'll like it.

296
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,090
Just so you know, if you hit me, it won't be fun.

297
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,000
Get out of my sight.

298
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,500
You give me a headache.

299
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,000
What do you mean?

300
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,880
I can't even go back to my dorm now?

301
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,100
Do I give you a headache?

302
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,200
Don't you want to see me?

303
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,100
I feel the same way, Mr. "Long Face."

304
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,200
I'm sleeping here tonight.

305
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,200
No need to ask me to go back.

306
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,300
What are you doing?

307
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,300
I heard you aren't sleeping at your dorm tonight

308
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:13,000
so I'm delivering your supplies.

309
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,900
I see.

310
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,000
Wu Ze told Luo Na again, didn't he?

311
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,200
Coach Luo.

312
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,700
Please. I had enough of their crocodile tears.

313
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,500
Go back now.

314
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,400
What are you doing?

315
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,200
Coach Luo asked me

316
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,400
to watch over an idiot.

317
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,200
Don't worry.

318
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,000
I'm still young.

319
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,800
I won't hang myself for revenge.

320
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,800
Just a pair?

321
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,100
How many do you want?

322
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,200
Don't be too greedy.

323
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,700
Fine. I'll let it slide.

324
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,100
I won anyway.

325
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,000
I jumped first.

326
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Cut the crap.

327
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,200
It was just a few seconds difference.

328
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,100
Fine, a draw then.

329
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,000
He caught a cold.

330
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,600
Take some medicine and sleep it off.

331
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,400
We'll see how he does once he wakes.

332
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,000
This is for you.

333
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,200
He should be fine.

334
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,800
If he deteriorates at night,

335
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,500
let me know.

336
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,400
I'll get going now.

337
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,300
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

338
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,100
Didn't I tell you to bring him a blanket?

339
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,000
Open your mouth.

340
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,100
I did.

341
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,300
It's not my fault he didn't use it.

342
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,000
Swallow it.

343
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,200
Wu Ze.

344
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,400
Are you a human?

345
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,100
Sleep within five minutes.

346
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,400
Did you catch a cold, too?

347
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,200
Nothing. I feel a bit dizzy?

348
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,600
"Dizzy"?

349
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,800
Do you have a fever?

350
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,100
You do feel a bit warm.

351
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,400
It's okay. You guys can leave.

352
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,900
I'll stay.

353
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,200
Go to my room first.

354
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,800
Come with me.

355
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,400
I need to talk to you.

356
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,100
You're an adult now.

357
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:31,200
Stop fighting with a boy.

358
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,400
He didn't use the blanket and caught a cold. It's not my fault.

359
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,700
Whose fault doesn't matter.

360
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,600
Don't you get it?

361
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,000
You can't fight stubbornness with the same.

362
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,200
Do you think

363
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,900
he is doing this to punish me?

364
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,600
Wake up. Have your medicine.

365
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,600
Can't you lift your hands?

366
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,800
If you feed me,

367
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,900
it'll be more effective.

368
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,000
Open your mouth.

369
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,200
What are you doing?

370
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,400
Sit properly and have your medicine.

371
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,100
I can have my medicine like this...

372
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,700
like this.

373
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,200
I spilled everything.

374
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,600
Let go of me now.

375
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,640
Are you pretending to be sick?

376
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,400
How else can I get into your room?

377
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,700
Get up now.

378
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,000
No.

379
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,500
Do you remember Cai Li Qiu?

380
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,700
Of course.

381
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,400
Two-time decathlon gold medalist at the National Athletics Championships

382
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,700
and two-time silver medalist at the National Games.

383
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,400
Why?

384
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,200
Will he be at Nationals?

385
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,900
I think so.

386
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,400
What should I do then?

387
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,600
He can earn 7,800 points,

388
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,800
and he is the national record holder in the 400-meter sprint.

389
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,600
He can finish within 45.25 seconds.

390
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,200
He is five years older than you.

391
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,800
That's the peak for a track and field athlete.

392
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,400
In addition,

393
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,600
he has always trained for the decathlon.

394
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,200
You just started.

395
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,800
It's only normal there is a gap between you two.

396
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,000
I heard he did a 100-meter sprint

397
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,800
within 10.37 seconds as a high schooler.

398
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,800
I can never reach that.

399
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,200
He was trained overseas.

400
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,000
That training is different from ours.

401
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,400
Their approach is more scientific,

402
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,600
especially in men's sports.

403
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,800
They have many talents sitting on the bench.

404
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,100
But we're stronger in women's sports.

405
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,200
If I'm not mistaken,

406
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,400
our female athletes always achieve first

407
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,000
before male athletes in many events.

408
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,200
You must work harder.

409
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,200
What do you mean female athletes get results first?

410
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,400
We...

411
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,400
Male athletes also get results.

412
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,300
What kind?

413
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,400
We earned many gold medals.

414
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,400
Let me do the math for you.

415
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,600
From the Los Angeles 1984 Summer Olympics

416
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,900
to the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics,

417
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,400
89% of China's first gold medals

418
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,400
were earned by female athletes.

419
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,400
So?

420
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,200
So...

421
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,800
We also make our country proud.

422
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,700
We're not worse than others.

423
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,700
Of course.

424
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,800
Eat your humble pie.

425
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,600
"We're not worse than others."

426
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,600
Is it funny?

427
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,300
I think so.

428
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,800
If you keep laughing at me, I'll be angry.

429
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,200
Luo Na, you...

430
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,000
Help!

431
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,700
You always tease me.

432
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,000
What's your major at university?

433
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,800
Mockery?

434
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,100
Duan Yu Cheng!

435
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,500
Get changed.

436
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,800
You're so sweaty.

437
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,600
Wash my clothes for me.

438
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,500
Why should I?

439
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,900
You're my girlfriend.

440
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,500
I want to wear clothes my girlfriend washed for me.

441
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,500
Or we could have a diving match, too.

442
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,300
The loser does laundry.

443
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,800
In your dreams.

444
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,800
No, no, no!

445
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,400
Stop!

446
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,770
[Hong Yan Sport Spirit]

447
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,800
Aren't you on sick leave?

448
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,800
Why aren't you resting in your dorm?

449
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,200
I don't want to see Wu Ze.

450
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,500
He gives me a headache.

451
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,300
Coach.

452
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,100
Are you done with 50,000 meters (31 miles)?

453
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,000
This is a nice touch. I'm done.

454
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I would have finished sooner if they weren't slow.

455
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,700
You carry on bluffing.

456
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,000
Get up.

457
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,000
Your legs.

458
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,200
Put it on now.

459
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,000
Don't catch a cold.

460
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,500
- Did you dry it?
- Yes.

461
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,300
Put it on.

462
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,900
Thank you.

463
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,200
I feel bad for Wu Ze.

464
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,400
I'm hungry.

465
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,000
"Hungry"?

466
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,400
Great.

467
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,200
Let's grab supper later on the second floor of the cafeteria.

468
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,200
Ignore him.

469
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,700
I want to go back to the dorm to cook dumplings.

470
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,400
Now?

471
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,500
"Dumplings"?

472
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,700
- Where are the dumplings?
- For real?

473
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,600
"Dumplings"?

474
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,200
- What?
- I want dumplings.

475
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,800
Let's head back and cook dumplings.

476
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,000
Can we cook them at your place, Coach Luo?

477
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,200
Our dorm restricts power usage.

478
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,000
- I want dumplings, Coach Luo.
- I guess next time.

479
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Enough about the dumplings.

480
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,400
She came here and handed you towels.

481
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,800
Now you want her to cook you dumplings.

482
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,000
Don't be too greedy.

483
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,700
She needs to rest, too, all right?

484
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,200
Next time.

485
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,600
Rest early, Coach.

486
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,300
I'll go now.

487
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,000
- Okay.
- Bye, Coach.

488
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,600
Let's eat at the cafeteria then.

489
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,700
Dumplings, I want dumplings, Duan Yu Cheng.

490
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,800
All you ever think of is food.

491
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,100
I want ones with Chinese chives (leafy) and eggs.

492
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,600
I'm starving.

493
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,400
Duan Yu Cheng!

494
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,600
Order something to eat, please.

495
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,500
I'm starving.

496
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,400
A third wheel will never know

497
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,600
how annoying he is.

498
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,300
What do you mean?

499
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,800
Thanks, Coach Luo.

500
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,500
Enjoy while it's warm.

501
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,600
Why are you here?

502
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,600
All of you asked for dumplings.

503
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,000
So I made some.

504
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,100
Do you want some?

505
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,100
Dumplings, for real?

506
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,400
Just one portion?

507
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,800
Huang Lin and the others took three portions.

508
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,500
Go look for them.

509
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,300
Huang Lin!

510
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,900
You'll choke if you have three portions on your own.

511
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,200
Have some.

512
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,800
I'll eat then.

513
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,500
Is it delicious?

514
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,200
Very.

515
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,800
Then have more.

516
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,100
Feed me.

517
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,400
Open your mouth.

518
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,600
That said,

519
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,900
isn't it tiring to make this many dumplings?

520
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,400
It is.

521
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,400
But someone asked for them

522
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,700
so I have to satisfy him.

523
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,600
Thank you.

524
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,300
But without those stupid third wheels,

525
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:39,200
we could have had a dinner date.

526
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,000
I know.

527
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,200
Although we couldn't have a date,

528
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,800
I still want you to have special dumplings.

529
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,600
What do you mean?

530
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,800
Only you get the seafood dumplings.

531
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,000
The others get only pork dumplings.

532
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Seriously?

533
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,300
Of course.

534
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,400
Thank you.

535
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,900
- I like it.
- Have some more.

536
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,800
Is it yummy?

537
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,600
- Help! I'm not taking it!
- Open your mouth!

538
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,200
- Will you take it?
- Heck, no!

539
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,600
Wu Ze!

540
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,000
Wu Ze! I won't take it.

541
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,400
You'll take it.

542
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,200
Open your mouth now!

543
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,800
Help!

544
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,600
Help!

545
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,500
Don't waste my time!

546
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,000
I said I won't take it!

547
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,800
Let go of me!

548
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,600
I won't take it! What are you doing?

549
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,400
You old fart!

550
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,400
Get off me!

551
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,700
I won't take it.

552
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,800
Medicine?

553
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,400
Do you feel better? You should be fine by now.

554
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,300
I'm not fine!

555
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,000
It's suffocating! I want to go out!

556
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Did you puke your common sense too?

557
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,100
He vomited in the toilet all night.

558
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,600
He tried to hide it.

559
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,400
Old Fart.

560
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,000
You need a hearing aid.

561
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,100
I didn't vomit.

562
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,600
You!

563
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,500
Sit back down!

564
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,300
Sit down!

565
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,800
You,

566
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,400
come out.

567
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,300
Come out!

568
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,900
You can give him medicine

569
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,100
but change your attitude at least.

570
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,400
No one can stand your temper.

571
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,200
Others might think you poisoned him.

572
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:52,500
He is just like you when you were younger.

573
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,000
People his age are too immature.

574
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,700
So why are you

575
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:01,100
dating an immature child then?

576
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,200
You knew?

577
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,700
You can't hide anything from me.

578
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,800
I took my eyes off you one second,

579
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,200
and you found another man.

580
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,000
Sorry.

581
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,400
You don't owe me an apology.

582
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,400
I just don't get it.

583
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,900
Children like them get on my nerves,

584
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:04,700
but you would date one.

585
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,600
I can't help it.

586
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,600
I fell in love.

587
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,000
Have you nothing else to say to me?

588
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,800
What do you want me to say?

589
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,400
For example...

590
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,700
"This is reckless."

591
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:34,800
"The whole team will disapprove of this."

592
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,400
"Your family will disapprove, too."

593
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,000
Luo Na,

594
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,300
as long as you love him,

595
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,600
you don't need others' approval.

596
00:36:56,300 --> 00:37:00,000
If something happens to upset you,

597
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,200
come to me.

598
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,700
All right.

599
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,700
Let me have a moment on my own.

600
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,400
I'll head to the field then.

601
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,500
You're such a coward.

602
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,000
I heard everything.

603
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,400
You can't even fight for your love.

604
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,200
And you call yourself a man?

605
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,600
I can't catch a break even after my heart is broken.

606
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,400
You can't lock me up.

607
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,500
Dream on!

608
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,200
I'll count to ten.

609
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,200
Climb back up.

610
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,400
And if I say no?

611
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,700
You are not allowed back.

612
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,500
Count down right now.

613
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,700
I can help you.

614
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,300
One, two, three, four, five,

615
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,000
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

616
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,400
Are you angry?

617
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:55,400
You are my punishment.

618
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,700
What's up?

619
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:34,200
You're so nice today and sit down with me for dinner.

620
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,000
It's your reward for your dedication.

621
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,100
It's my job to devote to training.

622
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,500
I said I would challenge Cai Li Qiu.

623
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,400
It's not just a proclamation.

624
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,100
I'll work hard!

625
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,600
What is this mysterious force?

626
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,000
Idiot.

627
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,800
You sucked all my IQ away.

628
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,600
What's the matter?

629
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,600
I was thinking about

630
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,800
how nice it would be if all were just like you.

631
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,500
That's quite improbable.

632
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,200
Why, though?

633
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,600
Did Li Ge do something stupid again

634
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,100
and upset Coach Wu?

635
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,400
I think they need

636
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,400
a turning point.

637
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,500
Just like Coach Wu and his previous coach.

638
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,700
Let's not discuss them.

639
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:58,700
They always reject my input anyway.

640
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:02,300
He thinks I'm too impractical.

641
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,800
I don't know what happened between Coach Wu

642
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,000
and his coach.

643
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,200
But I believe your judgment.

644
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,300
I believe Coach Wu can tame Li Ge.

645
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,300
Do you have so much faith in them?

646
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,000
No, why should I have faith in them?

647
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,200
I have faith in you.

648
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,500
In my eyes, you're always correct.

649
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,600
If you think they can do it,

650
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,500
they can do it.

651
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,000
I hope so.

652
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,500
Let's eat.

00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:29,200
♫ You said there will be success and failure if I come to you ♫

♫ I leave everything behind except to stride with you across the sky ♫
