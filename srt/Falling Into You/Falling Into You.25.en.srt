[Episode 25]

4
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:53,200
Did the reporter go to you?

5
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,890
What did Director Wang say?

6
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,360
Will it affect you staying on after graduation?

7
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,750
The team is very open-minded.

8
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:05,530
Director Wang and the team trust you a lot.

9
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,350
Hello, Mom?

10
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,940
Why didn't you answer your phone?

11
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,460
I was worried sick!

12
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,980
What did they say?

13
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:25,390
They should hold a press conference to clear your name, right?

14
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,030
- Mom.
- No!

15
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,860
How come you can answer your phone now?

16
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,750
- Shouldn't you be training?
- Mom.

17
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,480
- They didn't stop your training, did they?
- Mom!

18
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,500
What about Luo Na?

19
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,190
Can we not talk now?

20
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,390
I'll call you back in a bit.

21
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:25,210
My dad knows about this.

22
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,120
He called me.

23
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,420
We have an idea,

24
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,970
but we still want to know

25
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,730
what you think.

26
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,930
You're not trying to break up with me again, right?

27
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,800
No, I don't agree.

28
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,480
I think the root of the problem is not that we're dating.

29
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,230
- It's because...
- Don't be silly.

30
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,560
We're not breaking up.

31
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:05,140
I want you to go train overseas.

32
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,730
While you're still young,

33
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:12,400
let's go see a top-tier athletic field.

34
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,850
But

35
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,220
don't train for decathlon anymore.

36
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,260
Go back to high jump.

37
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,800
♫ My heartbeat elevates every time I see you ♫

38
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,820
Rather than being criticized by people for an event you don't enjoy,

39
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,550
why don't you

40
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,370
try the high jump again?

41
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:35,770
♫ Who could be tired when we spend time together? ♫

42
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:38,390
I asked you to try the decathlon

43
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:41,060
because I didn't want you to give up on high jump.

44
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,400
For the past six months,

45
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,300
your physical condition and muscle quality

46
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,830
have improved very quickly.

47
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,920
Didn't you clear 2.2 m during Nationals?

48
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:55,220
♫ I'm glad we are an equal match ♫

49
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,800
What a crybaby.

50
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,270
♫ I'll be thinking of you ♫

51
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,920
♫ There is no reason ♫

52
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,940
♫ Because you're irreplaceable ♫

53
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,040
♫ A smile will turn misty in the sunshine ♫

54
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,960
Marry me.

55
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,870
Okay.

56
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:25,160
♫ I'll be thinking of you ♫

57
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,870
♫ Whether it's howling wind or pouring rain ♫

58
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,770
♫ My heart will not change no matter what ♫

59
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,960
♫ My heart will not change no matter what ♫

60
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,640
♫ I'll be thinking of you ♫

61
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,390
♫ I don't need a reason because it's you ♫

62
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,330
♫ I don't need a reason because it's you ♫

63
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:47,790
♫ You'll decide whether a cloudy day becomes sunny ♫

64
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,740
I shouldn't come empty-handed.

65
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,430
I don't think I should come empty-handed.

66
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,390
Don't bother, no need for that.

67
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,600
Mom.

68
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,200
- Mom.
- Xiao Cheng, don't fear.

69
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,170
No matter what, I'll be here.

70
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,300
I can solve everything for you.

71
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:23,160
Mom, it's fine, it's fine.

72
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:01,010
It can be quite cold at night when sleeping.

73
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,370
I got a blanket for you.

74
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,290
Remember to use it.

75
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,940
- Don't catch a cold.
- Okay, I got it.

76
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,750
Go back.

77
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,560
Will you be thirsty at night?

78
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,960
How about I bring my water dispenser over for you?

79
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,180
- Otherwise, you'll have to come far to drink water.
- No need.

80
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,360
- It'll be troublesome.
- I won't be thirsty.

81
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,440
Just go back. Your mom is watching.

82
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,360
- Give it to me.
- Wait for me.

83
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,360
Wait, stay here.

84
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,900
Your pillow is not soft enough.

85
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,180
I'll give you mine; it's softer.

86
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,540
Come back here!

87
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,840
- Give it to me.
- No need.

88
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,170
I'll do it myself.
- No need.

89
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,210
Your mom is watching. Hurry and go back.

90
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,470
- Okay.
- Go back.

91
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,360
- Sleep early.
- Okay.

92
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,520
Give me a kiss—

93
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,500
Quick, go out.

94
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,460
You... If you need anything, send me a message.

95
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,600
I got it, I got it.

96
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:16,670
Do you have your phone with you?

97
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,740
Okay. Then tell me if you need anything.

98
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,670
I'll be right here.

99
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,450
Call me if you need anything.

100
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,590
Call me anytime.

101
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:28,090
Go to sleep. Good night.

102
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,150
Mom, why are you standing here?

103
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,180
Make some noodles. I'm hungry.

104
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:45,070
What kind of noodles do you want?

105
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,800
What are you doing?

106
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,000
You're awake?

107
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,400
Don't open your eyes yet.

108
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,800
Wait for me.

109
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,200
Okay.

110
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,000
Open your eyes.

111
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,100
What is this?

112
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I picked up this pearl at the beach

113
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,800
and got someone to finish it by hand.

114
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,400
Do you like it?

115
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,800
Yes.

116
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,600
Then when we get married,

117
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,100
I'll give you another

118
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,400
huge pearl necklace from the South Sea.

119
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,600
This is too small.

120
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,100
Why would I need so many pearls?

121
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,900
Get up first.

122
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,500
If you were born by the seaside, you would know.

123
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,600
Every pearl in the sea

124
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,600
and every shell is unique.

125
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,000
And it can only be given to one person.

126
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,600
My mom has many shells and pearls in her drawer.

127
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,600
They're all from my dad.

128
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,400
Okay,

129
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,600
then I'll wait for your South Sea giant pearl.

130
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,200
So you've agreed to marry me?

131
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,600
How did it become a forced marriage?

132
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,800
What "forced marriage"?

133
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,700
Tell me!

134
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,300
If you don't say yes, I won't let you go.

135
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,000
I...

136
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,800
No!

137
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,500

138

144
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,700
Then do I have to give you a present, too?

145
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,200
What are you going to give me?

146
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,400
I'll give you a pair of cleats.

147
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,100
I don't want cleats. I have so many of them.

148
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,300
Then what do you want?

149

♫ I'm sure you have it ♫

153

This?

154
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,800
See, these two are a pair.

155
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,200
So are we.

156
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,800
So wait for my return.

157
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
When we meet again,

158
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,200
they will meet again too.

159
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,800
Right?

160
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,900
You can't wear this.

161
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,600
If you bring it with you overseas,

162
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,200
it will collect dust there, anyway.

163
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,600
I can wear it.

164
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,200
♫ The chips are in my favor ♫

165
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,600
Keep it well; don't lose it.

166
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,700
Okay, I promise.

167
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,800
I... If I can't wear it, I'll...

168
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,400
I'll sew a small pocket in my sports shorts,

169
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,300
and I'll put it in the pocket during training sessions.

170
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,500
I will never lose it.

171
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,000
Then how am I supposed to wear it in the future?

172
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,100
Why can't you? Why not?

173
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,400
Not again.

174
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,800
No.

175
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,200
[Brian Greenfield Sports Training Base: Invitation letter]

176
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,800
You got the invitation from my dad.

177
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,600
You can go get the business visas.

178
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,300
If all goes well,

179
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,400
you can leave within a month.

180
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Are you happy?

181
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,200
Yes!

182
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,500
You have to leave soon.

183
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,900
So happy!

184
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,800
Is there anywhere else you want to go?

185
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,300
You have about five more days.

186
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,500
We can go out to relax.

187
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,100
Have you seen the shopping list I sent you?

188
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,100
Is there anything you need to add?

189
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,700
No, no, nothing.

190
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,600
What are you doing?

191
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,600
What kind of outfits does your dad like?

192
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,100
You're going for training,

193
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,200
not a beauty contest.

194
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,600
I know.

195
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,600
You don't get it; you don't understand.

196
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,600
I do.

197
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,400
You're flying halfway across the world

198
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,100
to see your future in-laws by yourself.

199
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,600
Plus, he's an expert in the sports world,

200
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,000
and I have no results to show him at all.

201
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,200
You must be so nervous that you want to vomit.

202
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,400
I'm about to.

203
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,000
Save me.

204
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,400
All right, I'll tell you.

205
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,500
Tell me.

206
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,600
When a father-in-law looks at his son-in-law,

207
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,500
he will only get angrier.

208
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,400
It doesn't matter how you dress.

209
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,200
Hey, you!

210
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,700
If you're not going to help, don't say anything.

211
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,400
Tell me.

212
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,200
The weight of Mount Tai!

213
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,000
You're crushing me!

214
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
If you don't tell me,

215
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,400
I won't get up.

216
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,000
Hurry! Tell me, and I'll get up.

217
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,400
My dad likes men in suits!

218
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,900
Mom!

219
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,400
Where's my suit?

220
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,100
Mom!

221
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,700
You were distracted while we were buying things.

222
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,600
Now your mind is elsewhere!

223
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,700
Are these things for you or me?

224
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,200
I already told you it's closed-door training over there.

225
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,300
If you want to buy these later,

226
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,400
you won't even have the chance.

227
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,200
Do you hear me?

228
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,600
What are you doing now?

229
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,800
I'm leaving in three days.

230
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,200
I feel like I won't get used to it

231
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,400
when I'm there.

232
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,200
How about

233
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,200
you come and stay with me for a week?

234
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,000
Help me to settle in,

235
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,800
just one week.

236
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,200
I know.

237
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,800
You have to defend your thesis,

238
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,300
and take care of your students

239
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,600
so you don't have time.

240
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,600
I can't go,

241
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,900
but even if we're living in different countries,

242
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,300
we can still make it feel like we're living together.

243
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,600
Cheer up.

244
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,900
The fish is here.

245
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,800
So many dishes?

246
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,000
I'm not done yet.

247
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Give me a moment.

248
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,200
Don’t touch the food.

249
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,000
Got it.

250
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,300
Here.

251
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,500
Red wine.

252
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,100
The most important thing...

253
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:54,200
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

254
00:19:54,200 --> 00:20:02,100
♪ Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you ♪

255
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:06,400
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

256
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,800
Happy Birthday!

257
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,200
I vaguely remember

258
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,100
that today is not my birthday.

259
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,600
Indeed, it isn't.

260
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,000
But since we're in a relationship,

261
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I want to celebrate your birthday with you every year.

262
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,200
But I can't do that next year

263
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,100
so I thought we should just celebrate it today.

264
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,300
Then based on what you said,

265
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,000
one is not enough.

266
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,200
How do you know you can return after one year?

267
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,300
Then I just won't come back ever.

268
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,000
I didn't say that.

269
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,200
I'm kidding.

270
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,000
Here.

271
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,000
Blow out the candles and make a wish.

272
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,700
Here.

273
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,400
All right.

274
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,000
Yes.

275
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,600
My first wish.

276
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,200
I hope Duan Yu Cheng

277
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,800
can quickly get used to the overseas training environment

278
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,800
and get good results.

279
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,200
My second wish,

280
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,900
I hope this incident can be settled fast,

281
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:17,300
and he can represent the country and take part in competitions.

282
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,200
My third wish...

283
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,800
Wait.

284
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,000
Are these your wishes?

285
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,600
Otherwise?

286
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,700
I'm about to leave.

287
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,800
Aren't you going to miss me at all?

288
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,400
That's not...

289
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,400
Why do you only care about training

290
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,000
and results?

291
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Even in your wishes,

292
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,300
you hope I can get used to life over there.

293
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,800
Did you even make a wish about us?

294
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,300
About our future?

295
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,300
You don't even care about me.

296
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,700
It's not that I don't care.

297
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,200
You don't even love me!

298
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,600
When I wake up every day, I send you a message.

299
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,300
While I wash up,

300
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,200
I hold my phone and wait for your reply.

301
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:27,180
When we talk on the phone at night,

302
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,500
I wait for you to hang up first.

303
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,700
I really can't bear to leave you.

304
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,000
But you...

305
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,800
Forget it.

306
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,400
Where are you going?

307
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,600
I'm going for a walk.

308
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I don't want to say something I'll regret.

309
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,400
Sorry.

310
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,400
Since I was young,

311
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,600
I'm so used to being

312
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,400
separated from my family.

313
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,800
I would wait a few months,

314
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,300
a year,

315
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,900
or didn't know when we'd see each other again.

316
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,400
When they finally returned,

317
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,200
I knew we would say goodbye again soon.

318
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,800
So I was once really afraid of saying goodbye.

319
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,600
But no matter what I said,

320
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,900
it wouldn't make a difference.

321
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,200
I became willful and upset,

322
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,200
even when they were somewhere far away,

323
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,800
and they would worry about me.

324
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,000
Slowly,

325
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,200
I learned to let nature take its course.

326
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,200
I wouldn't think of their return date

327
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:37,400
or their next departure.

328
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,600
I lived without relying on anyone

329
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,200
or showing them my negative emotions.

330
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,200
That was the only way

331
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
to make every meeting a surprise

332
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,200
so I wouldn't get hurt

333
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,500
when saying goodbye.

334
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,800
But you're different.

335
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,100
Ever since I decided to send you overseas,

336
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,600
I can't stop my negative emotions

337
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,600
from affecting me.

338
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,400
I tried to control myself.

339
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,700
I don't want our separation

340
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,800
to stress you.

341
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,800
When you left just now,

342
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,400
I suddenly figured it out.

343
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,700
Silent endurance in a relationship

344
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,800
and pretending to be strong are not important.

345
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,300
What's important are my feelings for you.

346
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,700
Duan Yu Cheng,

347
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,300
I don't want you to leave.

348
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,000
I like it when you're being clingy.

349
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,200
Actually, although you haven't left,

350
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,400
I already miss you.

351
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,000
Don't worry.

352
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,200
No matter where I go,

353
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,600
or for how long,

354
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,700
I will always remain linked.

355
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,800
I'll tell you everything I do.

356
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,600
I don't know what the future holds for us,

357
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,600
but I can promise you

358
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,200
that I will never abandon you.

359
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,900
Later, when you're with me,

360
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,000
you can do whatever you want.

361
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,400
Laugh if you want to.

362
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,400
Cry if you want to.

363
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,200
Just be yourself, okay?

364
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:07,000
♫ Looking for a love that stays, through the sun, through the rain ♫

365
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,600
Oh, right.

366
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,740
I haven't made my third wish.

367
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,600
♫ Here's my hand, we'll find our way to a brighter day ♫

368
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,400
I hope

369
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,700
I can always,

370
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,600
always,

371
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:33,000
be with Mr. Duan Yu Cheng... happily.

372
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,200
Wait.

373
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,500
Let me make a wish too, okay?

374
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,100
I hope I'll always be someone

375
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,400
you can be proud of and rely on.

376
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,000
♫ To a brighter day ♫

377
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,200
It's not as cold as you think.
[A Foreign Country; Luo Shou Min's House]

378
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,700
It's quite good.

379
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,400
I'll hang up now.

380
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,700
I've arrived. I'll update you later.

381
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,000
Bye bye.

382
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,600
- Hi!
- Okay then.

383
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,800
Is this the house of Luo Shou Min?

384
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,000
- Yes, sure.
- Yes.

385
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,800
Check inside.

386
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,600
Okay, thank you.

387
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,900
Hi! Hi!

388
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:29,200
I'm going to be late.

389
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,900
Hey, hi.

390
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,800
Hi, Bro.

391
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,000
Nice jacket.

392
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Yes, thank you.

393
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,500
- Let's go, Bro.
- Hi.

394
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,400
You must be Duan Yu Cheng?

395
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,400
Uncle.

396
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,500
Don't call me "Uncle."

397
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,600
Call me "Coach."

398
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,500
Hello, Coach.

399
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,000
Follow me.

400
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,400
Perform a high jump.

401
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,900
Coach, my training suit will arrive tomorrow.

402
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,300
So you can't jump?

403
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,600
I can, I can.

404
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,600
It must have cost you a lot.

405
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,200
Not at all,

406
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,000
it's a counterfeit.

407
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:00,800
It's not as relaxing as you might think.

408
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,100
Three rules,

409
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,100
remember them:

410
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,400
First, concentration.

411
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,000
Second, concentration.

412
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,900
Third...

413
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,800
You're not even wearing your training attire.

414
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,800
What is inside these two suitcases?

415
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,200
Oh, Uncle,

416
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:24,300
Luo Na asked me to bring these to you and Auntie

417
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,400
since you can't find them here...

418
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,100
Third,

419
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,200
don't ever mention Luo Na in front of me.

420
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:54,710
- Cool!
- Yes.

421
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:57,590
Wow.

422
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:01,320
Can you do me a favor?

423
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,870
- Go ahead.
- Take it easy.

424
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:06,100
I will try that.

425
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,500
Hello, Auntie.

426
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,100
So...

427
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,700
it's you.

428
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,600
You've just arrived. How can you wash the dishes?

429
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,300
Here, I'll do it.

430
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,900
No... no need, Auntie.

431
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,700
It's fine, I'll do it.

432
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,000
I'm good at doing housework.

433
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,200
I can wash dishes very thoroughly.

434
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,800
Are you here to wash dishes?

435
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,100
If you want to do chores and wash dishes

436
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,000
to earn five dollars an hour,

437
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
then get out of here.

438
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,400
I want an athlete, not someone who does odd jobs.

439
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,500
You don't have to try to please us.

440
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,000
Look at you.

441
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,300
Why must you be so harsh on him?

442
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,200
Before he arrived,

443
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:58,600
our daughter specially called and asked you not to be too harsh on him.

444
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,600
But look at you.

445
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,300
Is this being strict?

446
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,600
I was just stating facts.

447
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,900
I know you well enough.

448
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,200
You sounded so dignified,

449
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,400
talking about athletes this and that,

450
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,800
but you were just trying to intimidate your son-in-law.

451
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,400
What "son-in-law"?

452
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,700
I haven't acknowledged him yet.

453
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,700
Why is he our son-in-law?

454
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,600
Fine, be as stubborn as you want.

455
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,000
Anyway,

456
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,200
I quite like this son-in-law.

457
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,500
Sleep!

458
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,500
Yes, sleep.

459
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,800
All right, stop laughing, Luo Na.

460
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,000
You don't know

461
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,800
how your father looked at me when I wore my suit

462
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,800
to the training field.

463
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,900
I was like an idiot.

464
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,200
And it was my first time dining with your mom, but I...

465
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,400
My pants... I...

466
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,600
So embarrassing!

467
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,400
What do I do!

468
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,900
Impossible.

469
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:11,200
My dad likes seeing other people in suits.

470
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,300
Stop it.

471
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,600
You're still laughing at my misery.

472
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,400
Luo Na, I... I'm telling you.

473
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,700
If he doesn't acknowledge me

474
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,800
as his son-in-law due to this,

475
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,300
I'll see what you'll do.

476
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,900
What else can I do then?

477
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,200
I'll have to get another boyfriend.

478
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,400
Sure, just try! You won't be able to!

479
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,600
All right, I won't tease you anymore.

480
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,500
That's how my dad is.

481
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,800
He's old-fashioned.

482
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,400
If you don't have good results,

483
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,400
he really won't acknowledge you.

484
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,600
I'm quite scared of him

485
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,800
so if he really doesn't want you as his son-in-law,

486
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,400
I'll have to reconsider this relationship.

487
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,800
Impossible.

488
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,200
You won't get a chance to think about that.

489
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,600
I'll work hard and make my mother-in-law

490
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,600
and father-in-law satisfied with me.

491
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,000
Okay, I have faith in you.

492
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,400
How are things over there?

493
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,500
Are you coping well?

494
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,200
It's okay.

495
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,400
I just think it's very cold at night.

496
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,600
And I thought the food here wasn't bad,

497
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,900
but do you know how bad the sausage tasted?

498
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,000
I almost threw up.

499
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,200
Liu Yi.

500
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,500
Coach.

501
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,600
Eat with me at the canteen.

502
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,800
Where's Jiang Hao Ran?

503
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,200
He left early. He should already be there.

504
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,800
Fine.

505
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,000
Well...

506
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,200
Go to sleep. Get over your jet lag.

507
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,500
No.. Luo Na, "Jiang Hao Ran"? Hello?

508
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,200
Let's go.

509
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,500
Hello?

510
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,000
Luo Na!

["Sunshine, Waves, You and Me" by Liu Yu Ning]

512
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,900
♫ Sunrise captures the silhouette of the island, while shadows dance across the tides ♫

513
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:51,600
♫ The waves chase after the footprints, breathing them in ♫

514
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,600
♫ I want to follow you; let the sun melt the distance between us ♫

515
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,400
♫ I'm faltering in my steps; I won't be too greedy ♫

516
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,600
♫ The breeze shares with me a secret ♫

517
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,400
♫ You can't hide your scent from me ♫

518
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,200
♫ We are stuck together ♫

519
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,000
♫ After the heavy rain's evaporation ♫

520
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,200
♫ The convenience store blasts with cold air ♫

521
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,300
♫ But we are still sweating bullets ♫

522
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,000
♫ Stop checking your phone all the time ♫

523
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,400
♫ And pretending that you don't care about me ♫

524
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,000
♫ For me, summer is not just about ♫

525
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,100
♫ Carbonated drinks and jerseys ♫

526
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:26,800
♫ With clear and transparent courage ♫

527
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,500
♫ Don't stop me; I want to tell you everything ♫

528
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,400
♫ As long as you are here, I won't stop ♫

529
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:47,500
♫ This passion will burn forever ♫

530
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:53,300
♫ Let's sprint toward the ocean ♫

531
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:01,000
♫ The blazing waves are glistening ♫

532
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,700
♫ I look forward ♫

533
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:08,500
♫ To the infinite future ♫

534
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:12,400
♫ I leave everything behind except to stride with you across the sky ♫

535
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,900
♫ I'll give it my all to leap toward this stage ♫

536
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:23,800
♫ I look forward to the infinite future ♫

537
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,700
♫ You said there will be success and failure if I come to you ♫

538
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:31,800
♫ Great things come naturally ♫

539
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,500
♫ I look forward ♫

540
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:39,200
♫ To the infinite future ♫

541
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,100
♫ I leave everything behind except to stride with you across the sky ♫

542
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:47,600
♫ I'll give it my all to leap toward this stage ♫

543
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:54,400
♫ I look forward to the infinite future ♫

544
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,400
♫ You said there will be success and failure if I come to you ♫

545
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:04,300
♫ Great things come naturally ♫

546
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:10,500
♫ The blazing waves are glistening ♫
