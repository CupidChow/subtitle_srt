4
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,330
I've already got the championship.

5
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:48,100
Why do you still ask me to run those errands?

6
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,780
Wu Ze!

7
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,720
- Director Wang.
- Halt. Stand still.

8
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,950
I'm asking you. Where did Luo Na and Duan Yu Cheng go?

9
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,890
Why are you looking for them?

10
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:05,240
Tell me where they are!

11
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,080
Wait. Director Wang, you permitted their day off, right?

12
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,390
And Duan Yu Cheng was doing well recently

13
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,030
so just let him rest a few days.

14
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,340
I do well, too. Why don't you reward me?

15
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,630
Move aside.

16
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,490
You are still pretending, aren't you?

17
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:19,280
Listen up. Duan Yu Cheng's mother even called me!

18
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,680
And you're still covering for her. I'll...

19
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,290
I won't cover it up. I'll leave.

20
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,460
Get back there. Come back!

21
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,410
Why are you still there? Run!

22
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,890
He didn't follow us, did he?

23
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,810
How do you think Director Wang will deal with this?

24
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,000
Are you so happy?

25
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,330
You like Luo Na.

26
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:55,010
Now Wang Qi Lin knows they're together, they will be told to break up.

27
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:57,380
So you can just enjoy victory without lifting a finger.

28
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:01,100
You use fancy expressions.

29
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,830
Am I this kind of person in your heart?

30
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,900
I'm telling you.

31
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,800
I indeed like Luo Na.

32
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,880
But I don't wish them to break up,

33
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,540
at least not in this way.

34
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,070
And it's none of your business.

35
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:21,380
Don't spout nonsense here.

36
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,800
If you're truly magnanimous,

37
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,270
why didn't you call and alert them when Wang Qi Lin knew this?

38
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,610
It's obvious he will settle accounts with them. Can't you tell?

39
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:32,330
Allow them fun first. I don't want to spoil their good time.

40
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,900
You are actually a good person.

41
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,310
Listen.

42
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,930
Cheer up.

43
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,200
You are not inferior to Duan Yu Cheng.

44
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,660
But do you know?

45
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,010
The biggest problem for you

46
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,560
is...

47
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,280
being poor.

48
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,660
I used to fail due to this.

49
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,000
A man can lack anything

50
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,460
but money,

51
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,300
or you have no confidence

52
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,300
to face a woman.

53
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:13,420
I once said you were useless. I was wrong.

54
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,280
A person like you with extremely low IQ and EQ

55
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,600
is born for sports.

56
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,730
It's real. I have faith in you suddenly.

57
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,140
Wait.

58
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,830
Wu Ze. Are you insulting me?

59
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,490
Wu Ze!

60
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,920
And this one

61
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,170
is turquoise.

62
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,420
It might be a fake.

63
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,930
It was bought cheap in a scenic spot.

64
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,710
Why didn't you bring me souvenirs after your vacations before?

65
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,880
I bought some for you all,

66
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,870
including Coach Gao, Coach Yang, and Director Wang.

67
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,470
Recently,

68
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,430
have you seen Director Wang?

69
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,370
I thought you got bold since you're in love.

70
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,060
But you are still afraid of Old Wang.

71
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,280
"Afraid"? No way.

72
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,680
This is a vacation.

73
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,480
It's not against the law to have fun outside.

74
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,220
Old Wang knows your relationship now.

75
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,470
- Gosh...
- I didn't spill it.

76
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:21,120
I just want to warn you.

77
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,550
Old Wang has a traditional mind.

78
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:27,000
You can't change his thoughts with a few tries.

79
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:32,450
Then I'll just keep trying.

80
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:34,470
There must be a way.

81
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,070
Holy crap.

83
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,780
Duan Yu Cheng, are you serious?

84
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,970
Are you two really in a relationship?

85
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:50,900
I bought you a gift. I'll give it to you later.

86
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,940
It doesn't matter.

87
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:59,700
Now, tell me how you made Coach Luo fall for you.

88
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,160
During winter break, she visited my parents.

89
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,660
And we got together at that time.

90
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,560
So during winter break, you already...

91
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,490
And she already visited your parents.

92
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:17,080
Now, our parents already said yes to our relationship.

93
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,090
Duan Yu Cheng, so you are as scheming as ever.

94
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:25,860
You just won Coach Luo's heart silently.

95
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,080
Now, she couldn't get rid of you.

96
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,160
What's up with you?

97
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,530
Why are you studying English?

98
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,910
I haven't told you yet.

99
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,130
I decided to take postgraduate entry exams.

100
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:41,850
"Postgraduate exam"? Why?

101
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:47,180
I didn't get a good result in closed-door training.

102
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,980
Nor did I make it to National Championships.

103
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,900
I considered taking the postgraduate entry exams for quite a while.

104
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,650
I'm not as talented as Mao Mao Qi.

105
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:58,220
As for my luck,

106
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:02,210
I'm not as lucky as you, who got such a good coach who loves you.

107
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,920
Nonsense.

108
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,840
Anyway, I think I've done enough in the field of sports.

109
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,010
Taking postgraduate entry exams isn't bad.

110
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:18,050
It's a choice of a future for me,

111
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,530
right?

112
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,800
Of course.

113
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,700
It's good.

114
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,440
You are not doing it, right?

115
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,320
If you won't take those exams,

116
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,870
it would be like before when you followed me to South Lake University constantly.

117
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:40,800
In terms of study, I admit that I'm not as good as you.

118
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,260
If there's only one spot, you would leave me no chance.

119
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:53,460
Enough. Where's the gift? I'll check it out.

120
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,680
It's in the second drawer.

121

Hello?

122
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,910
Are you back now?

123
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,430
Yes.

124
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:12,570
Come to my office. Now.

Hello. What's up?

128
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:29,060
I just came back from Coach Wu's.

129
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,720
Are you free tonight?

130
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,220
Shall we have dinner together?

131
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,650
All right. What do you want to eat?

132
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:38,580
Jia Shi Li said there are many new dishes in Bus Restaurant.

133
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,440
Why don't we try it out?

134
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,490
He sure knows everything about delicacies.

135
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,110
So when will we go there?

136
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,780
I've got something to deal with in my team.

137
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,160
See you tonight.

138
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,890
All right. See you then.

00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,480
It's about Duan Yu Cheng, right?

Yes.

I admit it was my mistake.

149
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,550
I should have told you as soon as it happened.

150

I shouldn't take him outside for fun.

151

You still have the nerve to bring it up.

What were you thinking?

153
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,500
You actually mess around with your student!

154
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,580
"Mess around"?

155
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:31,350
What do you mean by that?

"His parent"?

170
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,790
His mother called me personally

171
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,440
and kept texting me,

172
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,820
asking me how I'd resolve this.

173
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,000
- What?
- Your phone.

174
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,860
- What?
- Give me your phone.

175
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,170
I don't have his mother's phone number.

176
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,500
I'll explain to her on the phone.

177
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,730
Luo Na.

178
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:14,160
What are you going to do?

179
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,850
Do you want to threaten her?

180
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:18,540
Such audacity!

181
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,340
What did his mother say?

182
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,700
What do you think she'd say?

183
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:36,080
You don't have to be afraid, though.

184
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,000
His parent is reasonable.

185
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,610
She didn't complain of other things.

186
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,470
But she worried that your relationship

187
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,890
would affect his training and competition.

188
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,120
Why would I be afraid?

189
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,520
Are you still being stubborn here?

190
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,640
You are in a relationship

191
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,460
with an athlete who just turned professional.

192
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,890
Yet you still think you did the right thing.

193
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,550
When you were in sports school,

194
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,820
didn't your coach tell you this?

195
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:58,890
Yes.

196
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,760
It was true we were forbidden to be in love.

197
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,770
But times are different now.

198
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:04,580
No one cares about old rules now.

199
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:07,230
You must be misled by Duan Yu Cheng.

200
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:09,390
What does it have to do with the times?

201
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,710
Don't you know why you're forbidden

202
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,920
to date a pro athlete?

203
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,700
Luo Na. You've been guiding Duan Yu Cheng

204
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,300
all the way.

205
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,320
You know very well

206
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,950
how hard he achieved all this.

207
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,070
I'll be frank.

208
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,110
The national team

209
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:29,250
already noticed him!

210
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,410
Really?

211
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:34,470
Of course, it's true!

212
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,990
At such a crucial time,

213
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,540
you caused this trouble for me.

214
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,850
Do you want to anger me to death?

215
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:46,030
I'm not against your relationship.

216
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,870
And it's none of my business whom you like.

217
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,850
It has nothing to do with me. Right?

218
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,500
But why

219
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,950
do you have to rush it?

220
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:55,470
It wouldn't affect him.

221
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,420
He is an extremely self-disciplined athlete.

222
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,220
Being in a relationship won't affect his results.

223
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,370
Do you really believe that?

224
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,750
My foot (as if).

225
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,280
No matter how self-disciplined, he is still a brat

226
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,790
who just reached his twenties.

227
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,650
If he wasn't affected, like you said,

228
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:07,670
with his character,

229
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,340
he would be training extra now,

230
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,580
instead of going out on a date with you!

231
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,200
- But we...
- Stop rebutting me!

232
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,420
I don't want to hear you!

233
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,120
I'm telling you.

234
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,360
The National Athletics Championships are in more than ten days.

235
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,600
Think what you should do.

236
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,400
Do you want me to break up with him?

237
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,100
I didn't say that.

238
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,070
Solve it by yourself.

239
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,300
Also, you should know

240
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,640
that in some cases,

241
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,330
sharp edges have consequences.

242
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,180
It would affect athletes even more.

243
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,830
Got it?

244
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,290
Luo Na.

245
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,370
I didn't expect you to be like this.

246
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,800
I can still recall

247
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,140
your state when you helped him with the switch.

248
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:04,010
I still remember your thoughts

249
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,680
and his thoughts at that time.

250
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,910
Both of you worked hard for the target.

251
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:11,410
I didn't ask you here

252
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:14,270
to force you to break up with him.

253
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,570
I just want to remind you

254
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:19,680
that one's strength is limited.

255
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,520
It's true

256
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,580
that you can continue to date,

257
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,660
and maybe there won't be a bad influence

258
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,630
as you said.

259
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,510
But it's just in case.

260
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,940
Can you really bear

261
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,240
to risk his career?

262
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,230
His 7,400...

263
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,690
What?

264
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,600
If he can't get

265
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,280
7,400 points,

266
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,560
I'll break up with him right away.

267
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,050
I'd write a 100,000-word self-criticism report.

268
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:58,960
I'd leave once I graduate

269
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,220
without applying to work here.

270
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,940
Will you write a book?

271
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,910
That's 100,000 words.

272
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,920
I wouldn't even bother to read it.

273
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,240
It's a deal then.

274
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,550
This is how I'll solve this.

275
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,770
By the way,

276
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:15,490
I bought you back some specialties;

277
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,730
do you still want them?

278
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:19,380
Yes! Leave them at my dorm.

279
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,910
With his character,

280
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,580
he would be training extra now,

281
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,800
instead of going out on a date with you!

282
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,050
But it's just in case.

283
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,650
Can you really bear

284
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:40,940
to risk his career?

285
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,080
That was harsh.

286
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,620
I should have said 7,300.

287
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:53,950
Why did I get impetuous and say 7,400?

288
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,300
Never mind, I'll just let it be.

289
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:11,700
You are back.

290
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,380
Where have you been?

291
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,540
I've waited for so long.

292
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,000
I told you to have a good rest.

293
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,620
You have training tomorrow.

294
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,360
I know.

295
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,650
But I suddenly feel

296
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:22,780
hungry.

297
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,460
Grab some food with me. Let's go.

298
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,810
It's only 4 o'clock.

299
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,260
It's 4:20 p.m.

300
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,860
I haven't eaten for five hours.

301
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,990
Let's go.

302
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,380
Come on.

303
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:34,840
What will we have?

304
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,430
What are we having today?

305
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,240
What?

306
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,760
What's wrong?

307
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,290
You look so anxious.

308
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,770
What got you so down today?

309
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,750
Stand straight here!

310
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,720
You don't seem anxious at all, right?

311
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,290
How's your preparation going?

312
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:03,120
Don't forget the competition after having fun outside.

313
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,430
I won't.

314
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,020
Listen up.

315
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,580
The competition is coming

316
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:11,290
so you should focus on it.

317
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,150
Did you hear me?

318
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,770
Yes.

319
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,520
Let's go.

320
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,080
Let's go eat.

321
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,190
[Archimedes]

322
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,810
Just now,

323
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:38,700
Liu Shan told me

324
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,390
he will take postgraduate entrance exams.

325
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,860
Will he retire from his career?

326
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,600
He never mentioned that.

327
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,170
It's not really retiring.

328
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:48,500
Maybe he thinks since he can't make better results,

329
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,590
he wants to

330
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:52,050
have another option.

331
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,300
With his grades,

332
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,160
it would be tough for him

333
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,950
to enter South Lake's post grad studies.

334
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,370
Not so.

335
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,370
You got in, didn't you?

336
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,200
That's not what I mean.

337
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,800
I think that actually,

338
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,400
student athletes spend most time training,

339
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,600
with not much time to study.

340
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,500
But it doesn't mean if we'd like to study,

341

349

So...

353
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,400
you should cherish the chance

354

He wants to rival specialized athletes in high jump.

I thought you would worry about me,

506
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,800
and I'm here specially to report to you.

507
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,400
Why would I worry?

508
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,200
I got angry at you days ago,

509
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,600
first time ever in two years we knew each other.

510
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,200
I'm sorry.

511
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,500
It's been two years.

512
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,800
I know you so well.

513
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,400
You must be over it long ago.

514
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,000
- Good then.
- Hey.

515
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,800
Will you watch my competition tomorrow?

516
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,000
Don't speak nonsense.

517
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,400
Does that mean you will or not?

518
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,300
I'll be there.

519
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,400
With you there, I'm sure I can have an extraordinary performance!

520
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,000
You should have an extraordinary performance if I'm there or not.

521
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,400
Since you've chosen this path,

522
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,000
you can't be half-hearted, got it?

523
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,600
Sit well.

524
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,400
Come.

525
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,400
Hear me out.

526
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,000
I know

527
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,300
that you fear our relationship

528
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,400
would affect my results.

529
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,600
Right?

530
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,800
I admit I got distracted before.

531
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,400
But I promise you,

532
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,600
I'll never be affected again.

533
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,800
Yet I'll tell you this first.

534
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,500
If you want to break up with me for my future,

535
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,700
you'd better forget that thought!

536
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,200
If you really break up with me,

537
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,500
then my mood would be grimly affected.

538
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,700
Once my mood is affected...

539
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:18,000
Duan Yu Cheng, are you threatening me?

540
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,200
You...

541
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,800
I mean...

542
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,600
I would cry.

543
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,500
It would be embarrassing if I

544
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,000
compete while crying, right?

545
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
It seems you aren't nervous at all.

546
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,600
Why would I be nervous?

547
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,900
It's late.

548
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,600
- Good night.
- Hey.

549
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,800
Good night.

550
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,100
Rest early.

551
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,400
Now he's touching my head.

552
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,300
How dare he.

553
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,400
Your best events are all on the first day.

554
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,300
You must heed this.

555
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:14,300
I have analyzed most of your opponents.

556
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,200
When there's not a huge gap between your scores,

557
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,600
don't go all out; save your energy.

558
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,300
Got it?

559
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,400
Well... I got it.

560
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,600
Morning, Coach Luo.

561
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,000
Morning, Coach Yang.

562
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,100
Morning.

563
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,000
How is it?

564
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,200
Did you sleep well?

565
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,000
Not really,

566
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,200
I'm used to my own bed.

567
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,700
Once I sleep in a different bed,

568
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,800
in the first two days,

569
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,000
I never sleep well.

570
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,200
And especially when pillows are not suitable for me,

571
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,400
- my neck would...
- It hurts!

572
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,300
What's going on?

573
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,100
The bugs are aggressive.

574
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,100
I just got bit.

575
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:00,600
Are you done eating?

576
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,400
If so, we'll train.

577
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,200
Okay.

578
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,700
We're leaving.

579
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,300
What are you doing?

580
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,600
You got up so early.

581
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,000
Where is he?

582
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,200
How's the preparation?

583
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,200
Whom do you mean?

584
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,900
What preparation?

585
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,800
He's in the bathroom.

586
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,600
He'll be downstairs later.

587
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,200
He has to run two rounds

588
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,800
in the group match and semi-final today,

589
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,800
Is he ready?

590
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,900
He's so nervous that he took three dumps.

591
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,200
Are you all right?

592
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,500
What?

593
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,200
I'm fine.

594
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,000
Are you too nervous?

595
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Why don't you care about him?

596
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,600
What else can I do?

597
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,700
I taught him all I could.

598
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,700
I'll just leave it to his own luck.

599
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,400
Why hasn't your injury recovered?

600
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,400
Isn't it just a bump?

601
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,800
There are serious bumps as well.

602
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,200
It's okay; my brain is intact.

603
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,200
Let me check it.

604
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,800
Your boyfriend just left,

605
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,700
and you start to care about me.

606
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,400
We are in public.

607
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,600
Mind your words.

608
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,800
Is he all right?

609
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,400
What if he has diarrhea on the field?

610
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,800
Sorry.

611
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,300
You may eat.

612
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:58,100
♫ Sunrise captures the silhouette of the island, while shadows dance across the tides♫

613
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:02,000
