Happy New Year! Happy birthday!

For all three of my full-squat tests, I exceeded 140 kilograms.

For the half squats,

I broke through 304 kilograms yesterday.

During my technique lesson just now,

177
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,400
I cleared 2.2 meters sixteen times. I jumped over them all.

178
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,000
I didn't tap the crossbar once.

179
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,200
Also, I flew to compete in three cities last Saturday,

Donetsk, and Stockholm.

181
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,800
I cleared 2.24 meters in both,

I'll participate in the Millrose Games.

186

202
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,000
Did you say he entered university without taking the test?

203
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,700
How did he become your student?

204
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,800
Are you jealous?

205
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,500
Yes, I am jealous.

206
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,300
Why would the master's wife get jealous of her student?

I am his master.

209

Wouldn't that make you the master's wife?

Indeed, why fuss over a young boy?

214

Has she missed me?

216

Does she mention me every day?

217
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,800
- How many times does she mention me?
- What did he say?

218
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,500
He asked how many times you miss him each day.

219
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,600
Why would I miss him?

220

I don't need their love, all right?

I don't want them to love me.

Uncle,

260
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,100
Luo Na told you not to drink that much.

261
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,600
It is your celebration dinner.

Is Luo Na usually tough on you?

It was all right.

she did frequently scare me.

It's good that she is fierce.

If she wouldn't be,

I think...

278
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,700
The most important thing is

279
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,500
never giving up

280
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,000
and never giving in.

281
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,700
No matter the challenges,

282
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,600
we must overcome them independently,

283
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,900
with resilience and a strong will.

284
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,300
Well,

285
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,800
that is how I taught Luo Na.

286
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,100
When she cried and threw tantrums as a little girl,

287
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,400
I wouldn't even coax her.

288
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,800
All I thought about was how to make her stronger.

289
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,200
Now that I am getting old,

290
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,400
I finally realize one must treat girls

291
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,600
with doting care and delicacy.

292
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,100
Then they will like you

293

00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,600

301

Rest assured

that I will treat Luo Na well.

305
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,400
I am assured.

306
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,200
Uncle,

307
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,200
actually, if you want to get closer to Luo Na,

308
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,900
it is not as hard as you think.

309
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,200
Luo Na is just like you.

310
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,000
She doesn't say what is on her mind.

311
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,300
I feel you could start with trivial things.

312
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,800
For example,

313
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,000
let's say she got angry

314
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,400
and hung up on you.

315
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,000
You can just make a video call.

316
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,600
Another example,

317
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,500
while she is always wearing sportswear,

318
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,000
to be honest, she is still a little girl.

319
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
She likes pretty clothes as well.

320
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,200
I think you could

321
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,500
buy and send her some nice clothes

322
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,300
that she cannot buy back home.

323
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,700
She would be very happy.

324
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,800
Of course,

325
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,400
if you don't really trust your fashion sense

326
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,000
to pick nice-looking clothes,

327
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
let Auntie pick for you.

328
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,400
Auntie has a keen aesthetic sense.

329
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,200
Am I right?

330
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,400
That is a great suggestion!

331
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,700
I need to write that down.

332
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,700
You remember it!

333
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,700
Are you ready?

334
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,600
Are you really going back?

335
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,600
Truth be told, I left due to some misunderstandings, too.

336
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,800
The misunderstanding is cleared up now,

337
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,000
and the national team issued a statement.

338
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,800
Cai Li Qiu even personally called to apologize.

339
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,400
He said he was dissatisfied with me back then

340
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,400
so he intentionally

341
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,800
chose not to refute the rumors.

342
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,400

if not for those things,

00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,500
You're fast!

505
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,200
You came out half an hour after the call.

506
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,500
Help me.

507
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,800
It felt like eternity to me.

508
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,000
Let's go, let's go!

509
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,900
Oh, it's so heavy.

510
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,950
Why are your palms so sweaty?

511
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,200
I don't think so.

512
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,600
You are sweating!

513
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,000
It's all right. Let's go.

514
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,200
Let it be. Let's go!

515
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,400
How about we get something to eat?

516
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,800
You haven't had a hotpot for a long time, right?

517
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,000
A new restaurant is in the old city area,

518
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,300
authentic Chongqing spicy hotpot!

519
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,600
- It's really delicious.
- Wow.

520
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,000
I made a reservation last week.

521
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,100
Hotpot sounds great! It's really tasty.

522
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,200
When I was there,

523
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,100
the food your mom made was quite bland.

524
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,800
B-But I really love her cooking!

525
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,400
It's super delicious.

526
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,600
What's wrong with you?

527
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,000
Nothing! I'm just happy.

528
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,600
Just saying, why don't we go to the university first?

529
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,800
What do you think?

530
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,600
Why are we going to the university?

531
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,200
Well, just...

532
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,000
Director Wang...

533
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,200
I promised to meet him.

534
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,800
He said to go to him as soon as I arrive.

535
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,800
He wants me to share

536
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:39,400
my experiences with our juniors.

537
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,400
Go tomorrow then.

538
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,000
They can't make it to the Olympics

539
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,500
if you give that talk a day sooner.

540
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,400
That's true, but still,

541
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,300
I gave him my word

542
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:52,000
so I should honor my promise.

543
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,500
It's all right. You just got back.

544
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:59,200
Director Wang won't want to be our third wheel.

545
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,000
I think I should still go.

546
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,500
I made a promise,

547
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,000
and I shouldn't make the juniors wait.

548
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,800
What's with you?

549
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,600
Nothing.

550
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,100
It's nothing.

551
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,800
Did something happen?

552
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,300
Can't you just tell me?

553
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:22,300
It's fine. It really is fine!

554
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,200
All right.

555
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,000
Let's have a hotpot then, if all is fine.

556
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Turn right in front.

557
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,400
Okay.

558
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,200
I still think we should go.

559
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,200
It's on the way anyway.

560
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,900
I already promised him yesterday afternoon.

561
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,600
"Afternoon"?

562
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,800
At which time zone?

563
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,000
Our time zone.

564
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,700
You mean,

565
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,500
Director Wang stayed up all night

566
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,000
to discuss work with you at 3 or 4 a.m.?

567
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,700
Is he trying to be the most hardworking employee?

568
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,700
Duan Yu Cheng, are you lying to me again?

569
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,200
What do you mean by "again"?

570
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,300
I never lied to you.

571
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,200
Do I have no say in your matters now?

572
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,800
You do, you do, of course, you do!

573
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,600
I...

574
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,000
Pull over.

575
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,800
Don't, Luo Na.

576
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,000
I said, pull over!

577
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,400
Okay.

I actually came back a week ago.

581
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,800
You came back a week ago.

582
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,500
It's okay. Cut to the chase.

583
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,000
No. I can take it.

584
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,200
It's not what you think.

585
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,700
It's actually not anything much.

586
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,700
I don't like it when people dilly dally.

587
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,600
Just spill it!

588
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,300
I'm such a bad liar.

589
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,700
I wanted to propose to you today.

590
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,600
Do you plan to propose?

Don't apologize. It's my fault.

594
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:44,000
But I ruined everything. This wasn't part of the plan at all.

595
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,800
I wanted to take you to the university...

Don't tell me, have you another surprise for me?

I'm sorry, I'm really sorry! I didn't know!

598

Don't be. I'm the one at fault.

I should have...

600
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,000
Let's stop talking.

601
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,500
Take it as I'm still in the dark.

What's on your mind?

622
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,500
I'm thinking

623
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,000
about the first time we met.

♫ We can't be testing it repeatedly ♫

It may be cheesy,

626
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,600
but you walked into my life

627
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,000
like a ray of sunlight.

You're the bravest girl I've seen.

You choose your own path and blaze the way.

If you're not telling me,

♫ No matter if we open our eyes or not, we still need to face it ♫

669
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,400
You're the first person

670
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,000
I've ever trusted apart from my family.

671
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,700
That's why, today,

672
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,600
I sincerely invite you

673
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,700
to become my family.

Get to the point! The point!

♫ Don't tell me you're coming tomorrow ♫

679
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,600
Will you marry me?

680
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,700
I will!

681
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:19,050
♫ Only if you can be by my side ♫

682
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,800
♫ How can you rescue the ordinary, fragile perseverance? ♫

683
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:31,400
♫ The embrace might be late, but it's blazing ♫

684
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,800
♫ No matter if we open our eyes or not, we still need to face it ♫

685
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,800
Three, two, one!

686
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,700
Congratulations on your marriage!

♫ Sunrise captures the silhouette of the island, while shadows dance across the tides ♫

688
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:07,000
♫ The waves chase after the footprints, breathing them in ♫

689
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
♫ I want to follow you; let the sun melt the distance between us ♫

690
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,800
♫ I'm faltering in my steps; I won't be too greedy ♫

691
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,800
♫ The breeze shares with me a secret ♫

692
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,800
♫ You can't hide your scent from me ♫

693
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,800
♫ We are stuck together ♫

694
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,400
♫ After the heavy rain's evaporation ♫

695

♫ The convenience store blasts with cold air ♫

696
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,700
♫ But we are still sweating bullets ♫

697
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,500
♫ Stop checking your phone all the time ♫

698
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,800
♫ And pretending that you don't care about me ♫

699
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,800
♫ For me, summer is not just about ♫

700
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,600
♫ Carbonated drinks and jerseys ♫

701
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:42,200
♫ With clear and transparent courage ♫

702
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:46,900
♫ Don't stop me; I want to tell you everything ♫

703
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:54,400
♫ As long as you are here, I won't stop ♫

704
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:02,800
♫ This passion will burn forever ♫

705
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:08,800
♫ Let's sprint toward the ocean ♫

706
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:16,400
♫ The blazing waves are glistening ♫

707
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,200
♫ I look forward ♫

708
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:24,200
♫ To the infinite future ♫

709
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,900
♫ I leave everything behind except to stride with you across the sky ♫

710
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:32,300
♫ I'll give it my all to leap toward this stage ♫

711
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:39,300
♫ I look forward to the infinite future ♫

712

♫ I look forward ♫

715

♫ I leave everything behind except to stride with you across the sky ♫

717
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:03,000
♫ I'll give it my all to leap toward this stage ♫

718
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:10,000
♫ I look forward to the infinite future ♫

719
