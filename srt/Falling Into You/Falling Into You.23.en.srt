[Episode 23]

4
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,800
Coach.

5
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,800
- Duan Yu Cheng, right?
- Yes. Nice to meet you.

6
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,300
Come. Sit here.

7
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,400
So? How did it go?

8
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,400
What did he say?

9
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,400
What did you talk about?

10
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,200
Nothing much.

11
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,000
He just asked about my condition

12
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,400
and if I'd like to go to the training camp.

13
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,800
Something as big as joining the national team,

14
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,000
why didn't you tell me right away?

15
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,800
I didn't really want to.

16
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,200
Are you so overjoyed you don't know what you're saying?

17
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,600
No.

18
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,200
I just thought that I don't know

19
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,600
anyone on the national team.

20
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,400
You'll get to know them once you go there.

21
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,600
But they are so serious.

22
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,000
The way they asked questions was also very serious.

23
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,800
And they told me

24
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,800
that only one coach can go with me.

25
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,700
Then go with Coach Yang Jin.

26
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,300
He is your head coach, the best candidate.

27
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,800
Then you can't stay with me.

28
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,100
I'm telling you, don't be all clingy.

29
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,400
I realized you always become really childish

30
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,800
whenever you must make a decision.

31
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,400
What do you mean by "childish"?

32
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,200
Don't you even feel sad about leaving me?

33
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,100
You're joining the national team,

34
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,000
not going to outer space.

35
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,800
Regardless, I don't want to join the national team.

36
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,600
But I think our university is good.

37
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,600
The provincial team is all right.

38
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,600
Anyway, I think if I work hard,

39
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,200
I'll surely get good results.

40
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,300
Listen.

41
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,800
When the national team selected Mao Mao Qi,

42
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,800
they just called him to let him know.

43
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,800
But they came to meet you in person.

44
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,100
They came right after you finished your competition.

45
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,400
Do you understand what this means?

46
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,800
But this will become a long-distance relationship.

47
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,000
I really want to split your head open

48
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,700
and pour hot oil on you.

49
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,400
What are you thinking?

50
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,900
I'm thinking

51
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,400
if only I could be a year older.

52
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,300
- "One year older"?
- Yes.

53
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,500
If I were one year older,

54
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,200
I'd reach the minimum marriage age (22 for males, 20 for females).

55
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,800
I could marry you.

56
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,800
You just turned twenty-one.

57
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,100
Can we not mention marriage all the time?

58
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,900
What's wrong with being twenty-one?

59
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,400
When my mom was twenty-one,

60
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,800
I was already able to speak.

61
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,600
Your family is a special case.

62
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,800
No. Get up.

63
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,200
We need to have a talk. Get up.

64
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,300
I'm like my mom.

65
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,400
I like mature women.

66
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,400
I want to marry you as soon as possible.

67
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,600
This way,

68
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,600
I can rest assured when I go to the national team.

69
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,200
Now is not the time to discuss this.

70
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,800
When did the national team tell you to be there?

71
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,000
They said

72
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,200
I still have some time to rest and prepare myself,

73
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,000
but closed-door training will start soon.

74
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,500
If I'm in good condition,

75
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,600
they will let me participate in the Asia Championships in October.

76
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,700
You are my living treasure.

77
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,500
Train well, compete well.

78
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,200
When you get good results,

79
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,200
I'll look great due to you.

80
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,500
But you won't really wait

81
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:15,000
until I become a national champion to marry me, will you?

82
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,200
Why are you still talking about it?

83
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:17,900
Wait.

84
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:22,000
Don't you want me to be one year older right now?

85
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,200
Of course not.

86
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,900
I hope you will always be this age.

87
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,200
Right now,

88
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,700
your bodily functions are in prime condition.

89
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,600
Twenty to twenty-seven years old

90
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,800
is the golden age for track and field athletes.

91
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,600
You are still young and can't understand.

92
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,800
Once you turn twenty-five,

93
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,000
you will pray day and night,

94
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,400
hoping that time can pass more slowly.

95
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,100
Okay.

96
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,600
Don't worry.

97
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,400
I won't leave any regrets.

98
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,000
Oh, right.

99
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,800
Didn't you just say

100
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,800
that you want to stay at the university

101
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,300
and can get good results anywhere?

102
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,200
Yes,

103
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,700
provided that you're there.

104
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,600
Stop thinking about all that nonsense.

105
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,800
Focus on your training.

106
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,200
Forget about getting married.

107
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,200
What's wrong with getting married?

108
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,200
We're in a relationship.

109
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,000
Is it wrong to think of these things?

110
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,800
It's bad enough that you rejected me;

111
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,400
do you even want to pour oil in my head?

112
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,200
So aggressive.

113
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,500
- Do you think I'm aggressive?
- Yes.

114
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,500
Then I'll be more gentle.

115
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,600
Sure.

116
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,200
I won't hit you

117
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,300
or kick you.

118
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:12,700
I won't pour oil in your brain either.

119
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,600
No!

120
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,500
Don't!

121
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,400
There you go again! It hurts!

122
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,700
Coach.

123
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,500
I'm staying there tonight.

124
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,200
Call me anytime.

125
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,200
But not too often.

126
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,400
Good night.

[Introduction to Sports]

128
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,400
How many days since you've washed your socks?

129
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,700
How can you stuff sweaty clothes

130
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,400
directly into your suitcase?

131
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,200
They all smell foul.

132
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,900
You can't keep these clothes anymore.

133
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,200
Do you feel hot?

134
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,400
Why don't you go take a shower?

135
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,000
Sure.

136
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,600
Although it's a training camp,

137
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,200
you still need to deal with some paperwork.

138
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,400
This is Duan Yu Cheng's details.

139
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,600
Fill it out.

140
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,600
Sir.

141
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,600
Do you still remember

142
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,800
the 7,400 we said earlier?

143
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,400
We were only twenty-five points short.

144
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,400
You won't fuss over that, right?

145
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,200
He's joining the national team!

146
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,800
It's not my business anymore.

147
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,200
Let the superiors over there

148
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,000
worry if you two are in a relationship or not.

149
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,800
Isn't this the case with your team?

150
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,300
They all run away after you get to know them better.

151
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,800
Are you feeling kind of sad?

152
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,800
Cut it out.

153
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,600
You two lovebirds are fussing over being apart.

154
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,100
Why would I be sad?

155
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,200
I wish you'd all leave.

156
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,200
That way, I-I would be free.

157
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,000
Go on. Leave.

158
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,400
Okay.

159
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,400
Duan, start once everyone is here.

160
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,400
Aren't you just giving our lives away?

161
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,400
When it's a good chance,

162
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,000
you guys don't follow me.

163
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Can you blame me?

164
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,700
Darn it.

165
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,800
Girls, come and take a look!

166
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,600
Bro, look at this.

167
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,600
Look at my location.

168
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,400
- Look at this.
- Don't.

169
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,800
I'm in a group battle.

170
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,200
Look.

171

Can I take this back for now?

341
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,200
Here's the thing.

342
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,200
I wonder if you are interested

343
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,000
in sports economics and management.

344
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,400
You mean...

345
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,600
Our company cooperates

346
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,600
with top professional sports management teams in the country.

347
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,100
Not only can they help athletes

348
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,800
arrange training and competitions,

349
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,600
they also arrange commercial ads and endorsements.

350
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,700
What do you mean?

351
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,400
I heard you have great grades.

352
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,700
You can view our team's information first.

353
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,600
Take a look.

354
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,500
They are very capable.

355
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,100
They currently have almost 100 athletes under their management.

356
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,800
- Many are the...
- Wait a moment.

357
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,200
Isn't this an interview?

358
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,800
Yes, we are doing an interview.

359
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,000
Don't be nervous.

360
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,200
Let's just chat as friends.

361
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,700
Right now, you're young,

362
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,800
and you're in your prime.

363
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:55,300
But the golden age for track and field athletes is too short.

364
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,200
You don't have to sign with us right now.

365
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,600
Let our team arrange several events and endorsements for you,

366
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,000
then you can check out their abilities first.

367
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,800
Listen to me.

368
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,600
This is what I think.

369
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,200
I haven't really thought about that yet.

370
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,100
I'm going to go eat.

371
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,000
Let's talk about it next time.

372
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
But...

373
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,800
"Eat"?

374
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,400
What time is it? Will you eat already?

375
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,500
I get hungry very fast.

376
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,200
Then think about it carefully when you're eating.

377
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,100
Okay. Thank you.

378
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,300
Coach. Let's go.

379
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,800
- Already done?
- The interview is over.

380
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,100
Let's go.

381
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,000
It's done.

382
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,800
I can't believe it.

383
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,500
Did you get hungry during an interview?

384
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,400
I'll tell you more about it later.

385
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,400
What were you watching?

386
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,600
You were laughing like a fool.

387
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,400
Look.

388
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,900
A video of you from Nationals.

389
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,700
Don't watch it.

390
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,800
Why are you so dumb?

391
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,000
What?

392
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,500
You know I'm ticklish yet you still tickle me.

393
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,000
Don't mess with me.

394
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,600
What if I do?

395
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,500
I'm warning you, don't mess with me.

396
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,400
So what if I do?

397
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,200
If you do it one more time...

398
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,400
If you do it one more time...

399
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,000
I was wrong.

400
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,600
- Were you wrong?
- I was wrong.

401
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,700
- Were you?
- Yes.

402
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,300
Now you know you were wrong;

403
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,200
why didn't you realize when you were tickling me?

404
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,300
I tickled you, so what?

405
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,300
Still being stubborn, right?

406
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,400
I am.

407
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,000
Can't I control you?

408
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,600
You can't.

409
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,800
So that's what happened.

410
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,200
No wonder you got an interview

411
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,400
without having any good results.

412
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,700
So they want you to have an agent.

413
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,000
Sports agencies are common overseas.

414
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,600
But here...

415
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,600
We begin to see more, though.

416
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,300
What do you think?

417
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,600
I think not.

418
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,500
Training is more important.

419
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,200
Then turn her down.

420
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,600
Be nice to her.

421
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,500
Don't make things awkward.

422
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,500
This is the guy from the video, right?

423
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,600
Duan Yu Cheng?

424
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,200
He looks even more handsome in person.

425
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,400
He makes me want to become an athlete, too.

426
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,000
Don't even think about it.

427
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I didn't know our university had such a handsome guy.

428
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
You're so likeable.

429
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Everyone who watched the video confessed to you.

430
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,800
Then will you mind if they like me?

431
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,700
No.

432
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,700
Wouldn't it be worse if they hate you?

433
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,900
What if they like me in a romantic way?

434
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,100
What if

435
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:54,000
I become really famous, really rich,

436
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,500
then I become a bad boy and don't want you anymore?

437
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,000
What would you do?

438
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,400
You won't.

439
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,100
How so?

440
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,800
There is no way.

441
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,200
You're not that kind of person.

442
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,300
How do you know I'm not that kind of person?

443
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,200
I just know.

444
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,800
If you were,

445
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,800
I wouldn't fall for you.

446
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,200
Let's get married.

447
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,100
I'm serious.

448
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,000
When I was in Jiangzhou last time, my dad told me to be responsible for you.

449
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,800
You are already their verified daughter-in-law.

450
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,700
If I don't marry you,

451
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:34,000
they will break my leg, seriously.

452
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,200
I'm leaving soon.

453
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,300
Just say yes. Okay?

454
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,300
Seriously, say yes.

455
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,500
How old-school is your family?

456
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,500
Before leaving home, must you get married?

457
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,000
Wait.

458
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,700
Did you say no

459
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,900
because my proposal wasn't formal enough?

460
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,500
I know it wasn't formal enough.

461
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,000
Then let's get engaged.

462
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,500
Getting engaged is okay, right?

463
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,300
You can say yes to getting engaged, right?

464
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,000
You will report to the national team in two days.

465
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,800
What nonsense are you thinking about

466
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,200
instead of considering the Asia Championships?

467
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,300
Get... getting married.

468
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,800
You have three seconds.

469
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,600
Sign it.

470
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,900
I said,
[Jump]

471
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,500
I'm not going.

472
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,400
Then get out of here!

473
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,400
Don't stay here!

474
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,200
Fine.

475
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,200
I see through you now.

476
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,500
You want to get rid of me after using me, right?

477
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,800
Burning the bridge you've crossed.

478
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,300
Fine.

479
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,400
- Don't.
- Get out!

480
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,000
Don't.

481
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I'll talk to him. You go out first.

482
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,700
Be quiet.

483
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,800
Come on, tell me.

484
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,600
Why don't you want to go?

485
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,300
It's all due to him.

486
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,600
He is sick and tired of me.

487
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,400
Now he can send me away.

488
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,800
Are you angry he refused

489
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,800
to go to the national team with you?

490
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,800
Everyone is accompanied by a coach.

491
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,100
Why doesn't he want to accompany me there?

492
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,800
He must be so tired of me

493
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,000
and is taking this opportunity

494
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,200
to get rid of me outright.

495
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,600
It's not that Coach Wu

496
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,800
doesn't want to go with you.

497
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,600
It's that he sees your potential

498
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,600
and wants you to go further.

499
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,500
What do you mean?

500
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,100
When you won first place at the championships,

501
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,800
you saw how he was crying.

502
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:47,200
He is happier than all that you get to join the national team.

503
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,000
But you need to know

504
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,500
that with your current level,

505
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,800
not every coach can train you.

506
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,800
He knows his limits and has to stop here.

507
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,800
Letting you go alone

508
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,900
will get you assigned to a better coach

509
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,600
and have more chances to compete.

510
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,400
So this is what he thinks.

511
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,200
Is he stupid?

512
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,000
You...

513
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,800
You should just believe Coach Luo.

514
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,400
They grew up together.

515
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,200
She knows Coach Wu the best.

516
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,600
He still didn't have to do all this.

517
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,600
Why does he think he isn't capable?

518
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,600
I want him.

519
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,800
I want only him.

520
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,100
Don't act like a child, okay?

521
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,600
If you really miss him,

522
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,000
then train hard and get great results.

523
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
What's so hard about getting results?

524
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,800
I just don't want to go alone.

525
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,800
Don't you still have him?

526
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,200
We said you two must depend on each other.

527
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,600
Let's get started now.

528
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,400
It's mealtime.

529
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,100
Just go eat together.

530
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,900
No.

531
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,400
Come on.

532
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,000
I'm hungry.

533
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,600
Let's go for some good food.

534
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,200
Once we join the national team, we can only eat at the cafeteria.

535
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,200
Eat well.

536
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,000
You're buying.

537
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,800
Don't worry too much.

538
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,400
On the national team, just work hard.

539
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,000
It's okay if you don't do well.

540
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,700
Coach Wu and I will always support you.

541
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,700
But can I ask you for a favor?

542
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,600
Go ahead.

543
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,600
Give him another chance.

544
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,800
Say something.

545
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:33,100
Train hard once you get there,

546
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,000
mainly to broaden your horizons.

547
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,600
We know your capabilities.

548
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,400
You can't achieve anything great anyway.

549
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,400
One thing:

550
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,000
don't get injured.

551
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,100
How can you just rain on our parade?

552
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,000
We haven't even gone yet.

553
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,400
Why can't we achieve anything great?

554
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,200
He's not good at sports.

555
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,000
You're not a good enough person.

556
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,600
Well...

557
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,000
Coach Wu meant

558
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,800
that after you go there,

559
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,700
you must take care of yourselves.

560
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,600
Don't be too stressed.

561
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,600
Right.

562
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,800
Just don't be stressed out.

563
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,800
Let's just do what we need to do.

564
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,300
Excuse me! Could we get the bill?

565
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,900
I'll go.

566
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,000
I'm going to the washroom.

567
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,200
He doesn't get it at all.

568
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,100
If he's not there,

569
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,400
what's the use of getting gold medals?

570
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,800
He won't be my coach anymore.

571
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,800
It'll have nothing to do with him.

572
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,500
Once you join the national team,

573
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,000
Li Ge will be all you have.

574
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,500
What does Li Ge have to do with me?

575
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,000
You are his senior.

576
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,100
So what?

577
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,200
Must a senior take care of others?

578
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,800
Of course.

579
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,000
That's how we were back then.

580
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,700
What?

581
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,600
What do you mean by "that's how we were back then"?

582
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,000
Did Wu Ze take good care of you back then?

583
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,800
- Get down.
- Why?

584
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,400
Get down.

585
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,700
No.

586
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,400
Get down.

587
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,100
What?

588
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,600
Did Wu Ze take good care of you back then?

589
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:36,600
Don't tell me you'll really give him another chance.

590
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,600
What nonsense?

591
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,000
No, right?

592
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,800
Of course not.

593
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,400
Don't worry.

594
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,800
I'll take care of Li Ge.

595
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,900
I'll take care of you, too.

596
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,200
Really?

597
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,800
In fact, I'm very good at taking care of people.

598
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,200
Look at Mao Mao Qi.

599
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,100
He's so dumb.

600
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,800
But while I took care of him, nothing went wrong, right?

601
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,400
You said again he's dumb.

602
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,600
Isn't he dumb?

603
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,400
And Li Ge,

604
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,100
are any of my juniors normal?

605
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,700
No.

606
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,400
But it doesn't matter.

607
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,800
I'll become a better senior than Wu Ze.

608
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I hope so.

609
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:42,800
What do you mean by "I hope so"?

610
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,700
Give me some encouragement.

611
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,200
How?

612
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,300
Not this.

613
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,100
Call me "Senior" today.

614
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
What are you doing?

615
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,700
What are you doing?

616
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:11,000
You spit the seeds in my mouth.

617
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,000
When you get there, take care of each other.

618
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,900
You're senior and junior. Do you understand?

619
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,000
Who is the senior?

620
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,800
Seriously?

621
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,800
Of course, the person who joined the team first is the senior.

622
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,000
What? I'm older than you.

623
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
This has nothing to do with age.

624
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
It does have to do with age.

625
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,900
Don't think I haven't read Wuxia (martial arts heroes) novels.

626
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,400
This thing depends on the masters.

627
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,600
I am your... My master is your master.

628
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,300
My master is your master's senior, right?

629
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,100
Are you leaving?

630
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,400
Do you want the plane to wait for you?

631
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,100
We're going.

632
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,200
Bye.

633
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,400
Remember to call me every day.

634
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,400
You'll know once you get there.

635
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,500
You won't have the energy to answer my calls.

636
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,300
I will.

637
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,200
Enough.

638
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,470
It's not like we won't see each other again.

639
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,600
You really are a Pisces (sensitive).

640
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,600
Go now.

641
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,300
I'm leaving.

642
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,000
Have a safe trip.

643
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,700
Coach Wu. Take care of yourself as well.

644
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,400
Let's go.

645
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,300
So fussy.

646
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,600
I'm your senior.

647
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,800
Who are you? Who is the senior?

648
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,600
Why do I suddenly feel like

649
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,000
I'm marrying off my daughter?

650
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,800
No.

651
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,200
I was talking about Li Ge.

652
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,800
♫ Sunrise captures the silhouette of the island, while shadows dance across the tides♫

653
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,600
♫ The waves chase after the footprints, breathing them in ♫

654
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:16,500
♫ I want to follow you; let the sun melt the distance between us ♫

655
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:20,400
♫ I'm faltering in my steps; I won't be too greedy ♫

656
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,400
♫ The breeze shares with me a secret ♫

657
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,400
♫ You can't hide your scent from me ♫

658
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,400
♫ We are stuck together ♫

659
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,100
♫ After the heavy rain's evaporation ♫

660
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,200
♫ The convenience store blasts with cold air ♫

661
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,400
♫ But we are still sweating bullets ♫

662
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,000
♫ Stop checking your phone all the time ♫

663
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,400
♫ And pretending that you don't care about me ♫

664
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,000
♫ For me, summer is not just about ♫

665
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
♫ Carbonated drinks and jerseys ♫

666
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,800
♫ With clear and transparent courage ♫

667
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:52,800
♫ Don't stop me; I want to tell you everything ♫

668
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:00,100
♫ As long as you are here, I won't stop ♫

669
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:08,300
♫ This passion will burn forever ♫

670
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:15,800
♫ Let's sprint toward the ocean ♫

671
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:21,800
♫ The blazing waves are glistening ♫

672
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:25,600
♫ I look forward ♫

673
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,400
♫ To the infinite future ♫

674
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:33,400
♫ I leave everything behind except to stride with you across the sky ♫

675
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:37,800
♫ I'll give it my all to leap toward this stage ♫

676
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:44,800
♫ I look forward to the infinite future ♫

677
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,800
♫ You said there will be success and failure if I come to you ♫

678
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,600
♫ Great things come naturally ♫

♫ To the infinite future ♫

681
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:04,200
♫ I leave everything behind except to stride with you across the sky ♫
