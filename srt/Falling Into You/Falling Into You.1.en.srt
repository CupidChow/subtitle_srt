Horse Face, don't make personal attacks.

170
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,719
You can't beat me in a 100-meter race.

171
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,549
What's wrong with the 100-meter race?

172
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,199
Do you think you can run fast?

173
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,350
Don't let me catch you!

174

Duan Yu Cheng, you can do it!

178
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,840
You should give up when you're this short.

179
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,080
Just accept your destiny.

180

Duan Yu Cheng, you can do it!

Stefan Holm (Swedish high jumper).

182
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,770
You know him, too?

183
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,930
Your fourth step was too slow.

184
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,180
Thanks.

185
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:57,790
[South Lake City No. 3 High School]

186
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,800
Was I slow with my fourth step?

187
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,570
What's wrong?

188
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,440
Did you take a liking to him?

189
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,420
What do you think of him?

190
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,389
He's a "no" for me.

191
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,830
He's too short.

192
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,440
He won't make it.

193
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,669
Besides, there's only one Stefan Holm.

194
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:12,749
All could be geniuses

195
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,850
if they could do as he did easily.

196
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,749
It's not unreasonable for me

197
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,720
to say you're an unwanted child.

198
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,440
Why would you believe her words?

199
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,920
However,

200
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,600
that lady is quite pretty,

201
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,810
elegant and dashing.

202
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,860
She's looking at me now.

203
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,410

Duan Yu Cheng, 179 cm tall.

207
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,079
His idol is

208
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,439
the Swedish high jumper, Stefan Holm, gold medalist

209
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,150
in high jump at the Athens Olympic Games.

jumping backward over the bar.

214
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,860
Success in one go.

215
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,240
He's smart.

216
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,210
Did you see that?

217
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:19,840
He did it right after I told him once.

218
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,850
Did I do it right?

219
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:33,940
Yes, you did.

220
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,320
Thank you.

221
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,789
No way.

222
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,710
This child won't make it.

223
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,239
The one you took a liking to

224
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,030
failed his last two attempts. Just forget him.

225
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,240
There's a third attempt, right? What's the rush?

226
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:04,290
Duan Yu Cheng, you can do it!

227
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:07,930
Duan Yu Cheng, you've got this!

228
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:11,550
Duan Yu Cheng, go for it!

229
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:19,319
Next, the crossbar will be raised by 2 cm.

230
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,860
It is now 2.36 m (7'9").

231
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,990
Currently, only two athletes are left:

232
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:26,059
Jaroslav Bába from the Czech Republic

233
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,059
and two-time champion of World Indoor Championships,

234
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,670
Stefan Holm from Sweden.

235
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:33,029
Jaroslav Bába is 1.96 m (6'5") tall.

236
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:35,269
He's 15 cm taller than Holm.

237
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:37,830
Holm will make the first attempt

238
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:41,269
at 2.36 m. A gap of 55 cm is

239
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,370
between him and the crossbar.

240
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:47,050
It's a new height he never conquered before.

241
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,240
That width,

242
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,629
rhythm, and explosive strength!

243
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,819
Holm accelerates,

244
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,629
getting into his rhythm, and widening his width.

245
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:54,180
He lifts off!

246
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,819
Success in one go!

247
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,579
Holm created a miracle in the Olympic Games.

248
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,099
A prodigy 1.81 m (5'11") tall

249
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,269
- Hooray!
- in high jump.

250
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,580
He leaped through the sky.

251
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,000
Were you shocked?

252
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,380
He's very focused on the field.

253
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,779
He's smart too.

254
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,170
He improved his fourth step again.

255
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,960
Is one's intelligence

256
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,130
more important than the bar height?

257
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:41,611
Are you done?

258
00:17:41,611 --> 00:17:42,680
I guess I'm done here.

259
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,610
- We aren't done yet.
- Get here.

260
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:48,230
It's not like others can't do it.

261
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,980
It's just 1.92 m (6'4"). What are you so proud of?

262
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,710
That lady is leaving.

263
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,680
Next jump, 1.95 m (6'5").

264
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:07,619
Before this, he had a high success rate on all his third attempts.

265
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,540
That means he has a good psychological quality.

266
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,709
No need to study that percentage

267
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,539
if he passed his first attempt.

268
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,890
It's 1.95 m now.

269
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,790
He can't make it. Forget about him.

270
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,470
Director Wang.

271
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,429
How was it?

272
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,539
I have a question.

273
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,709
Liu Shan from the high jump event,

274
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,790
is he trying to get into South Lake University?

275
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,450
Normal (Educators) University wanted to recruit him, too.

276
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,410
But he wants to wait for Sports University's enrollment.

277
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:27,780
He's so near-sighted.

278
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,760
South Lake University's high jump dept. isn't inferior to Sports University's.

279
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,750
Maybe he likes the atmosphere there better.

280
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,960
Although that's the case,

281
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,830
the competition there is bigger too.

282
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,379
Over twenty people

283
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,909
are as tall as him at Sports University.

284
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,940
- He won't be selected.
- True.

285
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,379
He's an ignorant child.

286
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,340
You must talk some sense into him.

287
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:54,940
He did succeed.

288
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,170
That child is good,

289
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:01,100
but he's too short.

290
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,280
Stop wasting your time on him.

291
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,749
We're almost done here.

292
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,339
You can look around a little more.

293
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,709
Let's head back after checking out

294
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,859
the 100-meter sprint.

295
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:09,480
All right.

296
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,280
Come on, Xiao Liu, let me tell you something.

297
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,579
Talk to Liu Shan.

298
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,539
Okay.

299
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,910
I think South Lake University is...

[Duan Yu Cheng]

301
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,600
He looks like me.

302
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,100
Don't worry.

303
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,000
I saw nothing.

304
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,200
Miss Sunglasses,

305
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,200
are you a coach from South Lake University?

306
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,400
I thought you said you saw nothing.

307
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,800
Are you here to recruit potential athletes?

308
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,000
Do you want someone from track and field?

309
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,800
What about high jump?

310
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,400
What do you think about me?

311
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,300
You shouldn't have cold food after exercising.

312
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,000
I know that. It's not for me.

313
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,600
It's for you.

314
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,400
Thank you for guiding me today.

315
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,600
Do you not like strawberries?

316
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,300
Thanks.

317
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,700
Don't mention it.

318
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,600
Did you see me clear the mark of 1.95 m?

319
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,100
I didn't.

320
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,000
What a shame.

321
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
It's as if God was helping me today.

322
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,300
Before, when I did takeoff,

323
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,700
my coach always said I did it wrong.

324
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,800
But I couldn't change my angle.

325
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,400
When you told me to quicken the fourth step,

326
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,600
I followed your instructions.

327
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,000
After that, I cleared the mark of 1.95 m.

328
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,700
You shouldn't deplete your energy blindly.

329
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,200
You have great explosive strength.

330
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,200
You can do better if you stabilize your footsteps.

331
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,400
What's the matter?

332
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,200
You're indeed a South Lake University coach.

333
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,500
You guys are here to recruit students, right?

00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,300
You can continue to practice high jump if you wish.

500
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,700
We have the high jump society.

501
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,000
They have professional coaches.

502
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
You can join them.

503
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I don't wish to join a society.

504
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,900
I want to join the track and field team.

505
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,600
Economics and Management has a busy study schedule.

506
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,000
You won't have time to train.

507
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
You entered with much effort.

508
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,800
You should keep up the good work.

509
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,900
I grew taller

510
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,000
by 3 cm (1.2 inches).

511
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,400
I'm 1.82 m (5'11.7") tall now.

512
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:38,200
I will balance my training and my studies.

513
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,400
I can show you my grades.

514
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,800
If I do well in my grades,

515
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:45,400
let me join the field and track team, okay?

516
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,400
Fine.

517
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,800
You can give it a try by then.

518
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,800
We would like to have

519
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,100
more top-quality athletes as well.

520
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,400
All right.

521
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,400
I'll go and enroll now.

522
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,800
Go ahead.

523
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,800
Can't you take the proper entrance?

524
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,800
Okay, I'll come down now.

525
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,800
Forget it.

526
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,400
Just go.

527
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,500
See you then.

528
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,000
See you later, Miss Sunglasses.

529
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,800
It's "Coach" for you.

530
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,900
Come in.

531
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,000
Is this Dorm 117?

532
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,200
Hello, Bro.

533
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,200
Hello.

534
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,600
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

535
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,700
Hu Jun Xiao.

536
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,100
Hu Jun Xiao!

537
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
He's asleep.

538
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,800
It's fine.

539
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,600
- We're in the same faculty, right?
- Yes.

540
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,300
How should I address you all?

541
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,790
I'm Jia Shi Li. You can call me Old Jia.

542
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,419
"Old Jia"? Okay.

543
00:34:04,419 --> 00:34:05,800
He's Han Dai.

544
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,200
His idol is...

545
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,400
that guy...

546
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,800
Oh, it's Steve Jobs.

547
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,400
It's Warren Buffett.

548
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,700
That's Hu Jun Xiao.

549
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:18,400
I've never seen him awake before.

550
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,000
I'm... I'm awake now.

551
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,500
I'm awake.

552
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,200
What about you?

553
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,300
I'm Duan Yu Cheng.

554
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,000
Nice to meet you all.

555
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,400
Bro, what are these?

556
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,800
Training equipment.

557
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,000
You're a professional.

558
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,900
All right.

559
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:41,900
I need to head outside.

560
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:42,800
You guys carry on.

561
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,900
Let's have dinner together tonight.

562
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,800
Let's try to get along.

563
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,400
Sure.

564
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,800
Let me add you on social media.

565
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,200
Sure.

566
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,800
Okay. I'll text you by then.

567
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,400
All right. I'll go and jog now.

568
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,200
See you guys tonight.

569
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,400
- Bye bye.
- Bye bye.

570
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,400
Where is he going?

571
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:11,600
He wakes up by 4 to 5 a.m. to run.

572
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,700
It's 4-5 in the morning, you know?

573
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:18,800
In the afternoon, he trains his core muscles.

574
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,700
He sleeps after taking a bath.

575
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,800
Do you know what time he sleeps?

576
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,000
It's 9:30 p.m.

577
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Our nightlife is starting at 9:30 p.m.

578
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,900
Hello.

579
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,400
Are you Duan Yu Cheng?

580
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,200
Nice to meet you.

581
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,700
I'm Shi Yin.

582
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,600
I was the first to introduce myself in the class.

583
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,000
I wonder if you remember me.

584
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,400
Hello.

585
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,800
I'm Duan Yu Cheng.

586
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,800
Can I sit beside you?

587
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,300
Suit yourself.

588
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:48,400
- I...
- From now on, I'll lock all the windows.

589
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,800
Don't let me see you again.

590
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,800
I can do all of the other training outside.

591
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,200
But how can I compete in the future

592
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,400
if you don't let me practice my jumps?

593
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,200
You aren't a sports student.

594
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,600
You can't compete in the first place.

595
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,000
What about this then?

596
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,400
Make me a spare set of keys.

597
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,100
I promise you that I'll lock

598
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,800
all doors and windows by 7 a.m.

599
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,800
And I won't let anyone know I was there.

600
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,200
I already told you before.

601
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,200
You aren't a sports student.

602
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,500
According to the rules, the gym is off-limits to you.

603
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,600
Moreover, you sneaked in the window.

604
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:24,000
I forgive you this time. Don't do it again.

605
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,500
Why don't you be my coach then?

606
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,800
I can use the gym if you become my coach, right?

607
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,800
I'm just an assistant coach.

608
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,900
I don't know how and I can't coach you.

609
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,000
You can coach me.

610
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
My capability improved a lot

611
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,200
just from your words when I was competing in high school.

612
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,100
I'm sure you can coach me. I'm serious.

613
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,700
I want you to be my coach.

614
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,200
Coach...

615
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,800
♫ Sunrise captures the silhouette of the island, while shadows dance across the tides ♫

616
