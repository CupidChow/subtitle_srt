[Episode 14]

4
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,790
Old Man, I'm back.

5
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,280
Wu, Luo, you are here?

6
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,510
- Ms. Li.
- Hello.

7
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,360
- Come on, sit inside.
- Old Man.

8
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,850
- All right.
- Look whom I brought.

9
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,610
- Coach Wang.
- Old Man, look. Look who is here.

10
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:03,590
- Coach Wang.
- Sit.

11
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,910
- Say hello.
- Don't be rude.

12
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,440
I'm here.

13
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,420
- Have a seat.
- All right.

14
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,240
I'll get you guys some water.

15
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,240
- Luo, here.
- Thank you, Auntie.

16
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,310
How are you on such a hot day?

17
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,310
Why cover him on a hot day?

18
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,280
Come on. I'll take your hands out.

19
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,110
Let them cool down.

20
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,160
It's fine. Please go ahead.

21
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,520
You guys can continue. I'll make lunch.

22
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,840
Okay.

23
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,590
His hands are quite warm.

24
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,390
Have a chat with him.

25
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:44,310
Coach Wang, I'm Luo Na.

26
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,480
Do you remember me?

27
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,800
You remembered my birthday when I was on the team.

28
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,610
You even prepared a birthday present for me.

29
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,920
Last time, you said

30
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,490
you would cook for me when you got better.

31
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,070
How did it get this serious?

32
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:11,700
He was talkative when I visited him two years ago.

33
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,460
He was in his good form

34
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,700
when you visited him two years ago.

35
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,670
Then it got worse.

36
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,760
But it's okay.

37
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,490
He worried about us his entire life.

38
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,050
Now, he doesn't need to worry anymore.

39
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,360
Have you been to the hospital for a checkup recently?

40
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,300
What did the doctor say?

41
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,390
There's nothing the doctor can do.

42
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,880
The tumor is growing.

43
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,040
He just told me it might slow down the deterioration

44
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,610
if he lives in a good environment.

45
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,450
He was silly

46
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,980
to have chosen me.

47
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,460
I couldn't give him anything.

48
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,090
Don't talk nonsense.

49
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:04,580
Coach Wang always treated you as his own son.

50
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,110
I never told him to do so.

51
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:17,230
No other sons could cause their fathers to end up here.

52
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,310
What do you mean?

53
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,700
I never told anyone this.

54
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,730
It's normal you don't know.

55
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:43,690
You know I grew up with my grandmother.

56
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,710
When I was 16,

57
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:51,740
she passed away after getting sick.

58
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,070
[In Memory]

59
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,260
I was homeless,

60
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:00,260
and he took me in.

61
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:07,810
[In Memory]

62
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,020
After that, I thought,

63
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,000
now I'm here, I should train with all I have.

64
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,750
It would have been great if I was sponsored by the government for my achievements.

65
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:26,220
So I followed him.

66
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,970
I was in university before I knew it.

67
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,060
After, the national team was recruiting athletes.

68
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:37,210
He recommended me.

69
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,130
Once I'm done here, the national team will select me.

70
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:43,260
Old Man, it would be hard for you to see me again.

71
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:48,230
I'll thank the Heavens if I can send you away.

72
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,960
Didn't Coach Wang join you on the scene?

73
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,060
I was perplexed, too.

74
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,050
But I thought it wasn't a big deal.

75
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:04,170
I found out later he went to the hospital that day.

76
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:10,400
So he was diagnosed back then?

77
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,720
It is a cerebral aneurysm.

78
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,830
The tumor could bleed anytime.

79
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,420
The operation would cost over 100,000 yuan ($14,300).

80
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,970
Very costly.

81
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:36,530
But he could cover the cost with his life savings.

82
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,500
Right after the operation date was set,

83
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:47,190
he heard that I punched a referee during the competition.

84
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:53,760
I would have been expelled if the campus heard of this.

85
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,390
He took me to apologize to the referee.

86
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,460
Apologize to him!

87
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,850
You must kneel, if he tells you to kneel!

88
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,050
Don't you want to be on the sprint team?

89
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,270
You can join it if you want.

90
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,190
Anyway, I quit.

91
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,160
You apologize to him!

92
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,300
He always stood tall as a person.
- You apologize to him!

93
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,990
But because of me...
- You go no matter what! Go there now!

94
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:18,210
- he had to bow down to other people.
- Now!

95
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,370
That jerk referee was ruthless.

96
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:27,330
He demanded 100,000 yuan.

97
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:32,660
He compensated that jerk with money he saved for his surgery.

98
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,080
You know all that happened after that.

99
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,970
I got on the national team,

100
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:42,650
and he ended up like this due to a cerebral hemorrhage.

101
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:48,320
He's truly unfortunate.

102
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,380
His life was ruined because of me.

103
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,850
You've never told me that.

104
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:02,270
Why would I tell you?

105
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,530
It sucks.

106
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:06,850
You are quite thick-skinned usually.

107
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:10,580
But you're reserved when it comes to this.

108
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,190
We've known each other many years,

109
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,260
yet you never told me.

110
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,380
You shouldered all the burden yourself.

111
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,050
Do you think you're an ascetic (recluse)?

112
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:22,120
How could I tell you?

113
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,360
I didn't realize he was sick.

114
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,770
I found out when he got paralyzed.

115
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:30,080
I'm unworthy as his so-called "son."

116
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,120
Old Man, am I right?

117
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,820
He's squeezing my hand!

118
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,150
Coach Wang, you know I'm here, right?

119
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,860
Please rest well.

120
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,170
Don't worry about anything.

121
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:58,290
I'll take care of Wu Ze for you.

122
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,580
One, two, one! One, two, one! One, two, one!

123
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:20,500
One, two, we can do it! One, two, we can do it!

124
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,550
What are you doing?

125
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:35,520
[To Luo Na: You didn't reply to me again.]

126
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,270
[Have you eaten?]

127
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,860
Senior,

128
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,260
I'm starving.

129
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:46,910
Why don't you take me out to get food?

130
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:51,220
I'll wait for you then.

131
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,270
Senior, why don't we head back?

132
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,910
I feel sleepy.

133
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,260
You're sleepy?

134
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:15,290
You should head back first. Don't wait for me.

135
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:17,020
Aren't you heading back?

136
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,620
I'm not sleepy.

137
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,950
Be a good boy. Go now.

138
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,640
I'll go then.

139
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,270
I heard you and Dai Yu Xia are together.

140
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:34,510
That's great. Congratulations.

141
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,320
There's nothing to congratulate.

142
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,980
We're just trying to get by together.

143
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,550
I scold you for saying that.

144
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,450
Dai Yu Xia is a great girl.

145
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,320
She's an excellent athlete as well.

146
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,740
What's wrong?

147
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,360
Do you regret being together with her?

148
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,820
Not at all. Coach, that's not what I mean.

149
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:00,340
I heard from Dai Yu Xia that you two plan to open a shop.

150
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,620
How are preparations?

151
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,220
Actually, we already found a location.

152
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,340
It's behind the campus.

153
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:08,290
A tea shop is closing. We're taking their location.

154
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:10,020
What shop do you plan to open?

155
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,050
A noodle shop.

156
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,870
Have you found a cook?

157
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,650
I'm the cook.

158
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,960
Do you know how to cook noodles?

159
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:23,340
Duan Yu Cheng.

160
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,570
Dai Yu Xia.

161
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,720
Are you exhausted from the training?

162
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,150
Not at all.

163
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:32,440
I heard you and Jiang Tian are retiring from the team soon.

164
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,410
He already retired from the team.

165
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:37,140
I'll tell the team after this competition.

166
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:41,050
But why? You two are doing well on the team, right?

167
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:43,040
Don't you think it's a waste?

168
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,510
I'm different from you.

169
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:47,390
You're into sports because you're passionate about it.

170
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,980
I'm different.

171
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,670
Not all girls are born with a passion for sports,

172
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,980
let alone shot put.

173
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,790
We have this saying in my hometown.

174
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:58,070
It's hard to find a partner if you're in sports.

175
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:01,240
I'm training right now

176
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,690
all because of him.

177
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,910
My grandfather owned a noodle shop.

178
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:10,750
When I was young, he taught me to make noodles.

179
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,600
Back then, he wanted me to take over the business.

180
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,500
But I thought

181
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,960
being a cook wasn't a great achievement.

182
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,480
So you fell in love with high jump, right?

183
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,220
I'm older than him.

184
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,380
However, I knew who he was back in primary school.

185
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,220
He was tall.

186
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,440
He stood out in his age group.

187
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,940
And we lived nearby.

188
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:44,620
I saw him before and after school.

189
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:48,020
It's just that he didn't know who I was back then.

190
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:51,050
That's considered a crush, Dui Yu Xia.

191
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:53,980
Yes, I guess so.

192
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,450
When I was free, I'd go to the sports school

193
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,550
and watch through the fence.

194
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:03,770
The coach took a liking to me after my frequent visits.

195
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,790
I feared I might not see him again

196
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:09,260
after he moved to a big city.

197
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,240
So I went to observe him in secret during his training.

198
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,930
A shot put coach liked me at first glance.

199
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:17,080
I was chosen by the provincial team.

200
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,740
I competed after a short training session.

201
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,700
And I won first place by chance.

202
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,630
That's great.

203
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:29,810
Dai Yu Xia, the Heavens blessed you with this gift.

204
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,100
You can't deny it even if you want to.

205
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:34,830
But now,

206
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,550
Jiang Tian is quitting the team.

207
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:42,130
I can't just leave him alone.

208
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,440
If so, did you tell him of your retirement?

209
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,440
Is she going to retire?

210
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,420
You actually had no idea?

211
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,480
I'm speechless.

212
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,220
Coach Luo, don't listen to her.

213
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,240
She's a great athlete.

214
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,410
She's able to join the national team.

215
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:04,910
He still doesn't know I'll retire soon.

216
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:08,390
I fear he'd break up with me

217
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:11,540
to persuade me to stay on the team.

218
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,220
Dai Yu Xia,

219
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,320
if I were Jiang Tian,

220
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,650
I wouldn't let you retire from the team for me.

221
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:25,320
I wouldn't break up with you either.

222
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,460
To me,

223
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,040
although sacrificing is a type of love,

224
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,540
supporting each other's dreams is love too.

225
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,340
In my opinion,

226
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,280
as long as you two are together,

227
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,840
you can overcome any obstacles.

228
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,470
If you can achieve,

229
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,040
I'm sure he'll be happy for you.

230
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:03,410
I will surely be your pride and joy.

231
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,450
By the way, when do you guys plan to open your noodle shop?

232

We'll be there to support you two.

No.

There's no need to hide secrets from me.

238
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:32,190
Are you... short on cash?

239
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,530
We do lack money for renovation.

240
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,220
How much do you need?

241
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,020
Coach Luo.

242

We'll gather money somehow. Don't worry about us.

Just tell me. How much do you need?

247
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,770
It's 30,000 yuan ($4,000).

All right. I'll think of a solution.

I don't know about the others, but as for me,

I don't judge an athlete by results alone.

I'm here.

256
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,080
Coach Wu knows someone who renovates.

257
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,150
He could help you out.

258
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:33,370
Just tell him what you need.

259
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:36,010
Actually, we don't need a complete renovation.

260
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:39,080
Maybe we just need to repaint walls

261
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,480
and change the name.

- All right.

Are you afraid of me then?

276

00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,400
How could I make a living in the future when you're this good?

663
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,500
Did you see me doing the 110-meter hurdles?

664
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,000
And the discus throw, I sucked at them.

665
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,700
- You were quite good.
- Those were just single events.

666
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,400
Right now, you're competing in decathlon.

667
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,000
The overall result is most important.

668
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,200
- I know that.
- You can work harder next time.

669
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,200
Train harder when you go back.

670
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,800
You can do it!

671
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,100
You should accept compliments.

672
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,000
Don't you feel fake pretending to be modest?

673
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,400
Who's that?
[Cai Li Qiu]

674
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,100
He's so mean.

675
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,200
That's Cai Li Qiu,

676
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,800
with 7,448 points.

677
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,200
He is champion.

678
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,800
That's amazing.

679
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,400
Thanks, Dai Yu Xia.

680
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,300
- See you.
- Where are you going?

681
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,500
- Bye bye.
- Where are you going?

♫ Sunrise captures the silhouette of the island, while shadows dance across the tides ♫

684
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:05,400
♫ The waves chase after the footprints, breathing them in ♫

685
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:09,300
♫ I want to follow you; let the sun melt the distance between us ♫

686
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:13,000
♫ I'm faltering in my steps; I won't be too greedy ♫

♫ The breeze shares with me a secret ♫

♫ You can't hide your scent from me ♫

♫ We are stuck together ♫

690

♫ After the heavy rain's evaporation ♫

691
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,000
♫ The convenience store blasts with cold air ♫

692

♫ But we are still sweating bullets ♫

693

♫ Stop checking your phone all the time ♫

694
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,200
♫ And pretending that you don't care about me ♫

695
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,800
♫ For me, summer is not just about ♫
