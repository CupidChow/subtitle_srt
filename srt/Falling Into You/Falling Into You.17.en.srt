Welcome.

6
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,610
Where are your parents?

7
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,420
They're not home.

8
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,880
Didn't you say your parents would be home?

9
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,250
They will be tomorrow.

10
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,330
Have a seat, Coach. Make yourself at home.

11
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,370
I... I'll change my shoes.

12
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,400
Sure, suit yourself.

13
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,380
I'm hungry. Do you have instant noodles?

14
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,530
"Instant noodles"?

15
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,790
Come on, Coach.

16
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:53,940
You're in the Duan Residence. You're not having instant noodles.

Did you know there are recipes?

49
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,900
When little, I followed recipes when my parents weren't home.

50
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,470

It's fine.

61

It's a bit messy as I haven't tidied up in a while.

I should get your room ready, Coach.

67
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:41,570
- Okay.
- Just sit anywhere.

68
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,140
An athlete shouldn't sleep on a mattress this soft.

69
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,610
Coach.

70
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,360

00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,950
Okay.

72
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,630
Is it okay for you to stay here tonight?

73
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,420
Of course.

74
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,850
All right.

75
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,160
Then...

76
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,970
Do you want to test it?

77
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:44,410
Test what?

78
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,570
The bed.

79
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,540
Because I saw that you quite like my mattress.

80
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:02,290
If you think this bed isn't comfortable,

81
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:04,510
you can sleep in my room.

82
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,400
I mean,

83
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,160
we swap rooms. I'll sleep here.

84
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,670
Oh.

85
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:19,360
The mattress feels comfy.

86
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,960
Okay.

87
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,730
But the blanket might be a bit thin.

88
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,020
If you think...

89
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,240
It's okay. It isn't hot in here.

90
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,550
Not "hot"?

91
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,620
What about the pillows?

92
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:39,170
I like the color.

93
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:40,350
Right?

94
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:43,100
I bought the entire 4-piece bedding set

It's getting late now. You should go to bed.

Right. It's 8:20 p.m. now.

98
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,500
Rest early, too, Coach.

Only the world champion is allowed to date.

00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,000
Coach, I'm a decathlete.

164
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,600
And you want me to be the world champion?

165
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,300
If you want to reject me, just say it.

No need to do this.

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,400
Coach.

168
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I'll make something for you to eat.

169
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,400
You can take a warm shower first.

170
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,400
The meal will be ready soon.

171
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,200
Just wait a moment.

172
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:34,000
Will we pretend again that nothing happened this time?

173
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,200
Coach, I really like you.

174
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,500
I like you, too.

175
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,200
Say something.

176
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,000
I was waiting for a "but."

177
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,200
There is no "but."

178
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,800
I like you,

179
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,200
in the way you like me.

180
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,600
Your cleaver! Cleaver!

181
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,000
Compose yourself.

182
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,100
I need to tell you something.

183
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,800
Go ahead.

184
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,400
I'm not a person of two minds.

185
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,200
Since we already...

186
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,400
Kissed.

187
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,000
I know.

188
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Continue speaking.

189
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,400
Then

190
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,800
there's no point in hiding my feelings.

191
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,700
It's unfair to you.

192
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,800
But it's not as simple as you think.

193
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,800
We can be together,

194
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,700
but I have one condition.

195
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,600
Are you listening carefully?

196
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,900
Yes.

197
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,800
As long as I can be your boyfriend,

198
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,500
I'll do anything.

199
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,200
Darling, do you like my lipstick?

200
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,100
Yes.

201
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,400
Can you check my eyeliner?

202
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,800
Please?

203
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,400
I'm driving.

204
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,800
You're meeting your son.

205
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,100
Why are you putting on makeup?

206
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,400
I have to look pretty.

207
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,800
First of all,

208
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,600
- no one can know about this.
- What?

209
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,000
Why not?

210
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,100
We have nothing to hide.

211
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,200
Yes,

212
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,200
but it's to avoid unnecessary problems.

213
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,600
We have to keep this under wraps for at least a year.

214
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,400
Secondly,

215
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,200
it is a crucial moment for you now.

216
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,100
There can be no mistakes.

217
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,400
I'll set a goal for every competition,

218
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,600
and you must achieve them.

219
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,600
But my performance can fluctuate.

220
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,800
I can't always...

221
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,500
All right.

222
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,600
As long as you don't set outrageous goals,

223
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,500
I will achieve them.

224
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,200
Thirdly,

225
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,900
if I think our relationship

226
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,800
affects your training and competitions,

227
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,800
we end it at once.

228
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,200
- No.
- Also,

229
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,200
once my postgraduate study ends,

230
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,800
I'll leave South Lake University.

231
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,800
That's unnecessary, Coach.

232
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,900
Listen carefully to what I'm about to say.

233
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,300
Whatever your excuses are,

234
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,600
I still think a 20-year-old professional athlete

235
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,600
shouldn't date anyone.

236
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,000
But I admit that I like you.

237
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,000
I like you so much that I'm willing to take the risk.

238
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,400
I want to see if this relationship

239
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,400
can help you positively.

240
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,600
It will. It has to.

241
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,000
You're an athlete.

242
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,800
Twenty years old is your prime,

243
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,000
and you have the potential.

244
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,400
If this bond impedes your growth for a year,

245
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,300
then I failed as a coach.

246
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,000
What's bothering you?

247
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,300
You made it sound so scary.

248
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,100
Don't be scared.

249
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,400
Didn't you always say to have faith in you?

250
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,300
Where's your confidence?

251
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,300
It's here.

252
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,200
Good.

253
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,500
I just want you

254
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,400
to realize your priority now.

255
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,800
If you agree to the above conditions,

256
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,700
from now on,

257
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,800
you'll be my boyfriend.

258
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,900
I won't let you down.

259
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,200
Cheng!

260
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,800
Cheng, I'm back!

261
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,400
Why didn't he close the door?

262
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,500
Where are you, Cheng?

263
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,000
Cheng?

264
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,900
Mom, you're back.

265
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,300
Mom.

266
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,600
I mean, hi, Mrs. Duan.

267
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,900
Coach Luo, you're here.

268
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,400
Coach Luo!

269
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,000
Hi, Mr. Duan.

270
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,200
Duan Tao, say hi to Coach Luo.

271
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,000
Hi, Coach Luo.

272
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,200
I'm Duan Yu Cheng's father.

273
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,200
Nice to meet you.

274
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,200
I'm sure my son must have given you a lot of trouble.

275
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,800
Not at all, he's excellent.

276
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,000
You're too humble.

277
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,600
Don't stand on ceremony now.

278
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,800
Coach Luo here

279
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,500
is like a sister to me. Isn't it, Coach Luo?

280
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,200
Coach Luo, please have a seat.

281
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,500
Hurry.

282
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,400
Okay.

283
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,800
Don't touch me!

284
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,300
When did you arrive?

285
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,300
I thought we arrived here early,

286
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:23,400
but my goodness, you're even earlier!

287
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,600
Honestly, we shouldn't have taken the car.

288
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,400
Taking the cargo ferry was such a pain.

289
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,200
That's what you get for not taking high-speed rail.

290
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,500
Why didn't we park the car at the dock then?

291
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,600
We could drive it home later.

292
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,400
You have to discuss it earlier next time.

293
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,000
Hindsight is all you have.

294
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,400
Didn't I mention it?

295
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,000
Perhaps you said it in your dream.

296
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
And didn't you catch that?

297
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,700
I did. I even confirmed with you.

298
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,400
But you took it back.

299
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,100
Impossible!

300
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:11,400
Lukewarm passion fruit juice with honey

301
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,900
- for the two ladies here.
- Thank you.

302
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,800
Have a taste, Coach.

303
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,800
Cheng is good at making drinks.

304
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,100
Thanks.

305
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,300
It is delicious!

306
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,400
In fact, the school has already contacted us.

307
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,800
You came here this time

308
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,600
to discuss his sports career, I presume?

309
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,000
Yes.

310
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,600
If he becomes a professional athlete,

311
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,000
he'll have many competitions,

312
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,400
and he might need to suspend his studies a while.

313
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,400
But the university will retain a spot for him

314
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,700
so he can resume studying in the future.

315
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,000
His academic advisor also called us earlier,

316
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,300
to say not to let his studies go to waste.

317
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,200
Compared to other athletes,

318
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,200
he has a lot more options.

319
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,600
Of course, you have the final say.

320
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,200
But what I want to say

321
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,800
is that he is a gifted athlete,

322
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,000
and sports is his passion.

323
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,200
I don't think it's a loss if he pursues this path.

324
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,800
But can you guarantee he will achieve something?

325
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,000
I can't.

326
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,800
But I can work with him.

327
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Cheng is also a smart student.

328
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,600
Perhaps if he gets a degree,

329
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,800
his future may be even brighter.

330
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,900
Of course.

331
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,800
But it's the same too.

332
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,500
No one can guarantee

333
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,400
he can ace all the general subjects in his course.

334
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,500
Don't you agree?

335
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,800
She's right.

336
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,000
I can't promise you that.

337
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,600
I know he's smart.

338
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,200
Getting into South Lake University was no easy task.

339
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,200
Thousands of students can get into South Lake University each year,

340
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,800
but only he has the precious gift

341
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,600
in track and field.

342
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,000
I like what you said there, Coach Luo.

343
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,200
I'm willing to entrust Cheng to you.

344
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,600
Is the meal ready?

345
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,400
I'm starving! Cook now.

346
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,800
All right, I'm on it.

347
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,600
Coach Luo.

348
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,000
Let me show you around.

349
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,600
Okay.

350
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,800
What are you doing?

351
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,600
Coming with you.

352
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,400
I just had my manicure.

353
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,200
Help your dad wash the vegetables. Go.

354
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,300
Cheng, come.

355
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,200
- Take this to the kitchen.
- Come, Coach Luo.

356
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,400
No, take the one on the table.

357
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,200
Don't drop it!

358
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Coach Luo.

359
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,600
Cheng trained here when he was little.

360
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,000
Here?

361
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Yes.

362
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,400
He trained alone.

363
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,200
This was once a sandy beach.

364
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,000
At first, he practiced the long jump.

365
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,400
Then he switched to the high jump.

366
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:18,100
Do you know why he switched to high jump?

367
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,600
No idea.

368
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,300
Cheng's growth spurt came later than other kids.

369
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,900
He was always the short one

370
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,200
so he started high jumping to get taller.

371
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,300
Somehow, he became fascinated by it.

372
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,600
I see.

373
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:42,200
He was a quiet child.

374
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,800
He had a lonely childhood.

375
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,200
My husband and I were too busy.

376
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,600
We couldn't play with him,

377
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,000
but he never complained.

378
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,200
He's so obedient.

379
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,600
He is a good youth.

380
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,600
Coach Luo,

381
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,600
whatever Cheng wants to do for his future,

382
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,300
my husband and I will not interfere.

383
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,700
If that is what he wants to do,

384
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,400
we will give him our support.

385
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,000
You will too, right?

386
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,200
Of course.

387
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,000
You will always

388
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,200
have his best interest at heart.

389
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,600
Is that true?

390
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,600
Yes.

391
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,400
Come. Let me show you that side.

392
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,200
Come, Luo Na!

393
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,800
I didn't lie to you, did I, Coach?

394
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,000
Cheng is a great cook.

395
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,400
He is amazing.

396
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,900
Try this.

397
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:56,000
The fried cod is delicious. Try it.

398
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,400
Cheng sure treats you better

399
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,300
than he treats his own mother.

400
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,430
No way.

401
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:05,310
- She is joking.
- Mom.

402
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:08,580
It's dad's job to spoil you. You shot the wrong person there.

403
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:11,040
Enough about this. Come.

404
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,190
Let's have a toast.

405
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,960
- Come.
- Sure.

406
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,570
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

407
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:16,760
Coach Luo.

408
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,290
Do visit us often.

409
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:21,010
My wife can't drink, and my son passes out after a glass.

410
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:23,370
With you here, I'll have someone to drink with.

411
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:25,360
- Okay.
- Cheers.

412
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,750
- Come. I'll refill your glass.
- I can do it myself.

413
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:34,140
She has finished half a bottle with you. Don't go overboard.

414
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:36,010
Don't get her drunk.

415
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:38,110
Coach Luo is no ordinary person.

416
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:41,200
Besides, you can't drink anyway.

417
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,350
It's not the first time you knew I can't drink. Why did you marry me then?

418
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:47,380
Our marriage doesn't relate to your alcohol tolerance.

419
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,160
Are you full?

420
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,400
- Yes.
- Let's go.

421
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,910
I'll show you a place.

422
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,610
Where are you going?

423
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,770
Jogging.

424
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:03,020
- Will you jog after a meal?
- Exactly.

425
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,930
We take a stroll first, then we jog.

426
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:07,120
That's our daily training. You won't get it.

427
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,650
Let's go, Coach.

428
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:10,940
W-We'll go jogging.

429
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,580
- See you.
- Then... Stay safe!

430
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:14,300
- All right.
- Come back early.

431
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,320
- Yes.
- Mr. and Mrs. Duan.

432
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,140
- I have to go now. Enjoy the meal.
- Stay safe!

433
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,460
Okay.

434
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,760
- Come.
- Careful!

435
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:41,510
Don't you like them?

436
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:44,480
- My parents...
- That's not it!

437
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,090
They care about you.

438
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:48,880
I think

439
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,290
they are nice people.

440
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:10,860
What?

441
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,180
What do you mean "what"?

442
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,790
Can't I stare at you now?

443
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:16,540
Don't stare at me like that. I'm shy.

444
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,640
Are you shy?

445
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:23,140
You were never this timid before.

446
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:27,340
And you never looked at me like that before.

447
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,210
When did you realize you liked me?

448
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,060
I don't know.

449
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,760
You don't know?

450
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:49,640
Do you remember the first time we met?

451
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,350
Yes, in South Lake No. 3 High School.

452
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,310
I always think about that day.

453
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,060
Really?

454
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:02,770
When I was 18,

455
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:05,800
I didn't have a lot on my mind.

456
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,960
I only trained and studied every day.

457
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,230
On the day we met, I was surprised

458
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,770
by how beautiful

459
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:19,480
you were.

460
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:23,120
You're so superficial.

461
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,790
No, I'm not.

462
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:26,770
It's because

463
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:29,680
the day you were there, I won against Liu Shan.

464
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,820
I think you were my lucky charm.

465
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,880
But that day, you didn't pick me.

466
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,170
I was angry.

467
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:38,790
I thought it was preferential treatment.

468
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:40,480
That night, I couldn't sleep

469
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,370
so I wrote, "I must get into South Lake University."

470
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:44,750
I wrote it many times.

471
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,190
Childish.

472
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:51,810
Well, you hurt an innocent 18-year-old boy's feelings.

473
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:54,180
"Childish"? Really?

474
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,430
You were short. What could I do?

475
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:59,440
If you call me short again, I'll get angry!

476
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,990
Sorry. I won't say it again.

477
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:06,570
So if you want to know when I began to like you,

478
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:08,990
I do not have an answer.

479
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:11,590
But whenever you're around me,

480
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:14,410
I want your attention.

481
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:23,010
You suspend your studies

482
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:25,930
for track and field.

483
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:28,960
Is this what you truly want to do?

484
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,570
Of course.

485
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,060
It's not because of me

486
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,100
or because you

487
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,450
want to prove someone wrong?

488
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:42,880
Did my mom say something to you?

489
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,730
No.

490
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,700
I promised her

491
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,250
that all decisions I make

492
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:53,440
have your best interest at heart.

493
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,820
Don't worry.

494
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,480
I can't quit track and field at all,

495
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,940
even more so with you by my side.

496
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:06,580
Chasing after my dream with someone I like

497
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,840
is the best that ever happened.

498
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,650
What do you say?

499
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,160
It's almost time. The boat is leaving soon!

500
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:07,100
♫ I never waste my energy on anything else ♫

501
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:12,970
♫ Because protecting you is my priority ♫

502
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:18,360
♫ My heartbeat elevates every time I see you ♫

503
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:24,360
♫ It's like my soul derailed into the universe ♫
