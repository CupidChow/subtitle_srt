7
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,740
Put it down!

8
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,510
- Duan Yu Cheng.
- Is this your recommendation?

9
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,540
I said, "Put it down."

10
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,360
I'm asking, "Is this your recommendation?"

11
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,420
It's merely a recommendation,

12
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,540
not the final decision.

13
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,670
We still need to discuss the final participants with the team.

14
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,160
Why do your words ring a bell?

15
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:22,870
When you chose Liu Shan from high school,

16
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,130
you said the same thing.

17
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,400
Do you think they are the same thing?

18
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,340
Are they different?

19
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,410
Come outside with me.

20
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,860
What's wrong with you?

21
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,030
Does Mao Mao Qi have a big influence on you?

22
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,370
You also failed to get picked before.

23
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,930
You weren't as emotional as this time.

24
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,420
So you've made your decision.

25
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,900
Can't you tell me directly?

26
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,670
- You don't have to avoid the issue.
- What?

27
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,420
Have someone else take care of Mao Mao Qi.

28
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,000
I don't care about him anymore.

29
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,970
I need to study. I don't have time for him.

30
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:32,590
Don't you have time for him since you want to study?

31
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,000
That's right.

32
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,530
Are you jealous of his talent?

33
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,740
Am I jealous of him?

34
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,330
Why would I be?

35
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,970
He knows nothing besides high jump.

36
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:48,560
Why would I be jealous of a fool who only knows high jump?

37
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,980
Do you know what you're saying?

38
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,770
It's fine if you don't want to take care of him.

39
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,020
But you have to change your mindset.

40
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,290
Put me on the list for the National University Games then.

41
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,840
I'll be better if you do so.

42
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,280
I knew you wouldn't.

43
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,460
It's not that I won't let you.

44
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,510
I know you want to join the competition.

45
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:21,130
- But I don't have a say...
- I know you don't.

46
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,370
But you can make recommendations.

47
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:26,070
Why didn't you write my name on the recommendation form?

48
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,820
You said you'd trust me!

49
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,430
Duan Yu Cheng.

50
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:54,180
- Hello?
- Have you filled out the recommendation form?

51
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,330
Not yet.

52
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:59,240
Why not? Just write down a few names.

53
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,040
Are you practicing calligraphy for this?

54
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,950
Director Wang, why did you ask me to make recommendations?

55
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,260
Coach Gao is the high jump coach!

56
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,620
You're putting me on the spot.

57
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,500
Why are you so angry?

58
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,850
Everyone has one form to make recommendations.

59
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,470
I...

60
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:32,820
It's so difficult.

61
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,360
Mao Mao Qi?

62
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,510
- Why are you here?
- Coach Luo.

63
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:53,210
S-Senior Duan left his meal card with me.

64
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,530
I went to his dorm just now.

65
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,380
But he screamed at me the moment he saw me.

66
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,990
I didn't even get to speak.

67
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:01,170
He screamed at you?

68
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,920
Don't blame him.

69
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,660
He's feeling down today.

70
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,020
I know.

71
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,260
He barely ate anything at lunch.

72
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,480
I haven't seen you for a long time. How are you doing?

73
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,360
Is everything going well?

74
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:21,260
Senior Duan took me everywhere he went,

75
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,730
and he took great care of me.

76
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:26,040
Don't be bothered by other things. Focus on training.

77
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,470
This coming September, you'll probably represent the school

78
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,170
for the National University Games.

79
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,090
What is that?

80
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,060
A competition.

81
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,720
Will it be difficult?

82
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,330
It won't be easy. Many national-level athletes will be there.

83
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:46,020
If I lose the competition,

84
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,140
can I still stay here?

85
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,130
Of course, you can.

86
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,240
Don't feel any pressure.

87
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,830
The municipal games will come first. They'll be easier.

88
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:58,040
You can try things out there.

89
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,370
For the time being, don't meet with Senior Duan.

90
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,360
Why not?

91
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:10,600
He... he has something to deal with recently.

92
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,280
Call me if you need help.

93
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,310
My mobile phone is broken.

94
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,360
When did that happen?

95
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,920
A few weeks ago.

96
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,530
What a weirdo.

97
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:30,750
I can't believe he lived a few weeks with no phone.

98
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,990
It's a modern age now.

99
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:36,900
He is different from you.

100
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,120
Enough. Just buy a feature (early type) phone for ¥‎200 ($30),

101
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,110
as long as it can make calls.

102
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,310
I'll take this.

103
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,310
Excuse me.

104
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,170
I'd like to take this.

105
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,770
Sure. This way, please.

106
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,260
Good Samaritan.

107
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:02,380
By the way, who did you assign

108
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,530
to sprint at the municipal games?

109
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:06,270
Huang Lin and Guo Jian.

110
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,950
I don't have a better choice than Huang Lin.

111
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:11,720
Guo Jian is just barely up to standard.

112
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,430
The quota isn't fixed, right?

113
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,620
What are you plotting?

114
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:21,580
Do you want Duan Yu Cheng to sign up?

115
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:40,770
Are you hoping he'll get his confidence back by participating in this smaller competition?

116
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:43,320
It's not that.

117
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:49,010
For now, there is only one Mao Mao Qi,

118
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:52,530
but there will be hundreds and thousands of Mao Mao Qis in the future.

119
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,720
I can't help him every time he has an obstacle.

120
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,000
So I must find a way to build up his confidence.

121
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,290
This time, I may be able to help him, but what about next time?

122
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,950
My father once said

123
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:17,220
that being an athlete isn't an easy task.

124
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,130
They will bleed or wear out,

125
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:22,390
yet they might end up achieving nothing.

126
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,690
As a qualified coach,

127
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,540
even if we have limited competency in coaching,

128
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,740
we should be able to endure the woes and pressure

129
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,000
together with the athlete.

130
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,750
- He has absolute trust...
- He has absolute trust in you, and you should support him fully.

131
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:42,970
Then you can create miracles together.

132
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,710
I've been hearing this from your father since I was young.

133
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:52,930
It always makes me feel ignorant and tiny.

134
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,120
Where did you go two days ago?

135
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,870
I went to Hainan.

136
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,380
Good place.

137
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,240
It reminds me of Wenchang chicken,

138
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,060
coconut chicken, and Hainanese chicken rice.

139
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,370
I went to see Coach Yang Jin.

140
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,890
I didn't expect that, Coach Luo.

141
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:16,490
When did you plan to make him a decathlon athlete?

142
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,800
Throwing objects off a height is strictly prohibited.

143
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,600
What if it hits someone?

144
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,100
Give it to me.

145
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,200
This little guy looks like you.

146
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,000
Look.

147
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,800
The way he smiles is a replica of you.

148
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,500
Stop staring at it.

149
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,600
Your bitter face can't even compare with it right now.

150
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,400
You've been so down recently.

151
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,800
Do you want to pour your heart out

152
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,600
to your mentor Mr. Jia?

153
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,800
You always reach a dead end.

154
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,400
Quit if you're tired of it.

155
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,300
You should broaden your horizons

156
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,800
and change your mindset.

157
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,600
Duan Yu Cheng, I haven't finished talking yet!

158
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,400
The outside world is wonderful.

159
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,100
I can't believe him.

160
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,700
Don't act rashly.

161
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,200
You're here to apologize to her.

162
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,200
Don't be impulsive.

163
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,400
Take it.

164
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,600
Give it to him after the municipal games.

165
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,200
Tell him this is the reward for his championship.

166
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,700
It makes more sense if you give it to him.

167
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,400
Are you sure he can win?

168
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,600
It's just the municipal games.

169
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,200
But it's his first time

170
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,500
participating in a meet of this scale.

171
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,000
Jiang Tian did well in his usual training,

172
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,800
but he messed up when it came to the competition.

173
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,000
Mao Mao Qi and Jiang Tian are different.

174
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,400
What's the difference between them?

175
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,800
You'll see it later.

176
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,100
It seems you think

177
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,800
Mao Mao Qi is better than Duan Yu Cheng.

178
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,700
He is better in high jump.

179
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,200
If he practices more,

180
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,600
he'll surpass Duan Yu Cheng's best record on the starting height.

♫ I feel warm ♫

182
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,600
You must trust me unconditionally from today on.

183
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,300
You must not hide anything from me,

184
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:24,500
lie to me, or try anything funny behind my back.

185
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,600
Every athlete has flaws.

186
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,000
But I think he can make it.

187
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,100
You're the first student I coach.

188
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,100
I'd pay more attention to you for sure.

189
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,100
Okay, 2.1 m.

190
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,000
If he clears the bar at 2.1 m on sports day,

191
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,800
let him join the track and field team.

192
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,800
Do your best.

193
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,000
I will deal with other issues.

[To Coach Yang Jin: Duan Yu Cheng's training log]

218
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,800
Hopefully, I can help you this time

219
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,100
and won't let you down.

220
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,300
Is that Duan Yu Cheng?

221
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,100
Hey, Duan Yu Cheng.

222
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,270
You rushed out the door this afternoon.

223
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,500
I couldn't inform you about the class gathering.

224
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,500
I didn't check my phone.

225
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,000
Are you going somewhere after dinner?

226
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,400
The final exam is coming up.

227
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,400
So we want to talk about the internship plan.

228
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,900
Is there an internship in the first year?

229
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,000
We want to make good use of the semester breaks.

230
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,600
Since we don't study for TOEFL and IELTS (testing English),

231
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,400
an internship is a good alternative.

232
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,200
You're completely out of touch with the class.

233
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,000
That's true.

234
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,200
Just now, I failed to recall the classmates' names.

235
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,800
Well, I'll leave you here.

236
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,800
I have to go now.

237
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,400
Are you worn out from training?

238
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,500
Training is indeed tiring, but it's normal.

239
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,400
Did something go wrong?
[Archimedes]

240
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,700
You haven't been in a good mood

241
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,400
since the semester started.

242
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,700
I'm fine.

243
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,000
You always pretend you're fine.

244
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,200
You're not a professional athlete.

245
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,500
And you don't go to the library anymore.

246
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,000
Besides, you didn't do well on course tests.

247
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,800
Do you want to fail your courses in the first year?

248
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,400
You came to South Lake University to study finance.

249
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,700
However, you act like you're a student-athlete.

250
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,000
What are you thinking exactly?

251
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,000
Forget it.

252
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,300
I know you won't tell me.

253
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,700
Let's go.

254
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,200
If you're free now,

255
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,000
let's listen to everyone's internship plans.

256
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,700
I'm not going.

257
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,200
I won't go for an internship anyway.

258
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,200
You can at least meet the classmates.

259
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,000
Maybe next time.

260
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I'll go to the library to study.

261
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,100
We'll talk another day.

262
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:23,200
Duan Yu Cheng missed group training three times.

263
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,100
He had never skipped it since his first day of school.

264
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,400
Did you hear me?

265
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,000
No wonder I see him here a lot lately.

266
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
What has happened to him?

267
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,700
I'll go and ask.

268
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,000
No, don't.

269
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Just pretend that you don't know.

270
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
We're all grownups.

271
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,800
He'll come around.

272
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,600
Duan Yu Cheng

273
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,800
doesn't focus on training at all now.

274
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,000
Final exams are soon.

275
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,400
He's busy studying.

276
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,000
"Busy studying"?

277
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,400
Do you believe that?

278
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,400
Of course, I do.

279
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,000
Look at you.

280
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,600
I can tell from your face that you're upset.

281
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,900
Even if you make plans for him,

282
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,400
it would be helpful

283
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,600
if he could accept his shortfall.

284
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,700
Don't worry.

285
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,200
I'm confident in my student.

286
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,200
He'll come around.

287
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,200
His mindset is not as strong as you think.

288
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,600
I'm full.

289
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,400
Did I say anything offensive? You...

290
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,600
Are you not eating anymore?

291
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,000
Little Brat,

292
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,600
you ruined my appetite, too.

293
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,400
That's all from me.

294
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,200
Anyway, Director Wang wanted you to know

295
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,800
that the municipal games are a formal competition too.

296
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,400
So try your best.

297
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,600
Understand?

298
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,800
Understood.

299
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,100
Okay. Return to your team now.

300
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,600
Huang Lin, lead warmup for the sprint team.

301
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,600
Okay. Come on.

302
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,400
Sprint team, get ready for the warmup.

303
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,400
Duan Yu Cheng.

304
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,000
Why did he call you?

305
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,700
Mind your own business.

306
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,100
For the time being,

307
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,400
focus on sprint practice

308
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,200
instead of the high jump.

309
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,000
Go warm up with Huang Lin.

310
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,700
I don't want to sprint.

311
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,800
Excuse me?

312
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,600
I said I don't want to run the 100-meter sprint.

313
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,600
Are you refusing to run?

314
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,800
Yes.

315
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,600
Who do you think you are?

316
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,600
I'm nothing.

317
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,200
You can find someone else.

318
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,100
She should have been here to listen to this.

319
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,600
Who?

320
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,800
As long as you're on the team,

321
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,000
you must obey the order.

322
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,800
So she wants me to practice the 100-meter sprint?

323
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,400
Of course, if you're no longer on the team,

324
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,200
we won't care about you.

325
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,600
Why does she want me to do sprints?

326
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,500
If you want, get the heck out right now.

327
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,200
Wu Ze.

328
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,100
Coach Gao is busy with something else today.

329
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,300
I'll train the high jump team.

330
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,500
Coach Luo, I...

331
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,800
Many students are on the team.

332
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,600
I can't focus only on you to resolve your issues.

Luo Na, calm down.

501
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:04,730
Reporting someone to the organizing committee is not a joke.

502
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:07,840
Why can't I report his dirty act?

503
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,780
But you need evidence. Where's your evidence?

504
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,070
We need to find it.

505
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:14,470
What if you can't? Have you thought of the consequences?

506
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:17,740
I'll quit then.

507

Whom do you want to report?

508
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,730
Zhang Hong Wen from Sports University's sprint team.

509
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:29,660
We've performed the selective examination per the rules. He wasn't chosen for that.

510
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,920
Examine him now then.

511
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:34,790
We must act according to the rules.

512

You don't get to examine any athletes you want.

513

That's right. Who are you? What right do you have?

514
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:42,120
You ignore the rules. Do you think you're better than us?

515
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,710
That's right. The municipal games aren't under South Lake University.

516
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:46,170
You don't have the right to examine us as you please.

- That's right.
- You don't have the say. Get lost.

You have no right to do so.

You're not entitled to file a report.

But at least you trusted me before.
