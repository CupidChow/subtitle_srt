Do you know why I want to talk to you?

I'm talking to you here.

Don't you already know?

What kind of attitude is this?

182
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,370
Since what you did is serious,

183

it's not just Duan Yu Cheng who will be affected.

Well, he has better conditions than I do.

I won't pursue this for the time being,

it's all your fault.

That's not what I mean.

I mean he has more potential in the 100-meter sprint.

301

His height hinders him in the high jump.

Tell me, how can he?

Now we're discussing it,

take this as a reminder.

315
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,600
You should find the time

316
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,400
to persuade him to switch to sprint.

317
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,700
It'll be better for his future.

318
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,200
You must be joking, right?

319
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,100
He just won a gold medal.

320
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,100
Why are you taking the risk

321
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,000
to ask him to change his specialty?

322
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,800
There's no point arguing with me.

323
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,000
Trust me.

324
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,600

You don't look upset anymore.

327
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,800
You seem to have problems with Zhang Hong Wen, too.

328
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,800
He'd slack off during training.

329
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,200
His results are not up to par at all.

330
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,800
But he performed exceptionally well

331
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,200

332
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,400
What could it be?

333
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,500
Are you saying he doped (steroids)?

334
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,290
Since he's already accepted,

335
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,800
I couldn't care less anymore.

336
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,800
But I despise people like him.

337
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,600
At first, I thought he would be expelled.

338
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,800
I didn't expect he'd stay.

339
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,200
Since Duan Yu Cheng doesn't mind,

340
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,400
I can't fuss over it, can I?

341
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,200
Zhang Hong Wen is right about one thing.

342
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,500
You do favor Duan Yu Cheng.

343
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,400
I recruited him personally.

344
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,900
He's so hardworking and set to prove himself.

345
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,400
Is it a problem to favor him?

346
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,200
Just be frank with me.

347
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,300
Think about how proud you looked

348
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,400
when he won the gold medal.

349
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,400
Also,

350
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,600
you were so anxious over a small cut.

351
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,000
Do you see him as a team member

352
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,500
or do you like him?

353
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,600
That's ridiculous!

354
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,600
You're not a child anymore.

355
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,600
Can't you say anything decent?

356
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,700
I'll stop talking then.

357
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,500
Director Wang did tell me something.

358
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,000
Switch his specialty?

359
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,900
How did you know that?

360
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,800
Talking to you is so frustrating!

361
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,200
Isn't it obvious?

362
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,000
Why would he let him compete in the 100-meter sprint in the first place?

363
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,300
Duan Yu Cheng's height is a disadvantage

364
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,400
when it comes to high jump.

365
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,200
There are only a few exceptions in the world.

366
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,800
Letting him change to sprinting

367
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,200
is to let him go further.

368
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,500
Don't even think about it.

369
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,500
I won't let you take him.

370
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:17,600
You said your student is my student, too.

371
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,000
Are you reversing your words now?

372
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,500
Did he win one gold and a silver?

373
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Really?

374
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,400
Yes.

375
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,200
When I texted him,

376
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,800
he didn't even reply.

377
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,100
I thought he failed.

378
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,800
Maybe...

379
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,800
Maybe he wants to surprise you.

380
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,200
I think so, too.

381
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,800
But you already told me.

382
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,200
It's no longer a surprise.

383
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,600
He said he'll treat us to dinner to celebrate.

384
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,700
He told me to inform everyone.

385
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,800
Yes, we must celebrate.

386
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,400
I'm going to see him and ask what he wants to eat.

387
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,600
Hey, wait up.

388
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,500
Wait for me.

389
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,700
[Miss Luo Na, you're cordially invited]

390
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,400
[to attend the occasion of Mr. Duan Yu Cheng's victory celebration.]

391
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,000
[Miss Luo Na shall decide on the venue.]

392
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,700
Miss Luo Na shall decide on the cuisine too.

393
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,600
It turns out my handwriting is better

394
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,200
than the top student who passed the gaokao

395
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,500
to enroll in the Faculty of Finance.

396
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,200
How did you know I was here?

397
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,200
Your tricks are more childish than your handwriting.

398
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,000
Who are you planning to invite?

399
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,100
The track and field team.

400
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,000
Get me some water.

401
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,400
Also, my classmates who are close to me.

402
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,200
Is Shi Yin going?

403
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,400
I'm just messing with you.

404
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,180
Doesn't the track and field team

405
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,000
usually cover the celebratory expenses?

406
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,600
That wouldn't be fun.

407
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,000
Let me make the arrangement this time.

408
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,500
It'll be fun.

409
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,400
What do you want to eat?

410
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,600
We'll eat what you want.

411
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,700
I'm just warning you.

412
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,300
Every team member eats like a horse.

413
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,200
With that little cash prize of yours,

414
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,400
you can go broke.

415
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,400
It's okay.

416
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,400
I couldn't spend all the allowance my parents gave me anyway.

417
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,600
I've calculated it.

418
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,300
I can afford it.

419
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,800
How will you survive after you spend all your allowance?

420
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,900
I'll just ask my mom for more.

421
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,500
You sure were born with a silver spoon in your mouth.

422
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,300
I'm serious.

423
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,000
Tell me what you want to eat.

424
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,500
Forget it.

425
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,000
If you weren't living off your parents,

426
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,800
I wouldn't mind you treating.

427
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,300
But I can never let you do that after knowing.

428
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,500
I want you to reconsider the celebration.

429
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,200
Stop pretending to be serious.

430
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,600
You should go to your class.

431
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,800
I'm busy here.

432
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,200
I-I have another idea

433
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,200
that allows everyone to have fun

434
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,600
and save money.

435
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,200
Tell me.

436
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,400
My family has a house in the suburb.

437
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,200
We can buy ingredients and cook there.

438
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,600
This will work, right?

439
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,500
Can your house accommodate so many people?

440
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,100
It's a three-story house with a small yard.

441
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,500
We can play games in the house

442
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,100
and barbecue in the yard.

443
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,900
What do you think?

444
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,200
It turns out you aren't just rich

445
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,200
but filthy rich.

446
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,400
Are you okay with this idea or not?

447
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,400
Come inside.

448
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,700
There's a backyard.

449
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,300
Are we having a wedding?

450
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,400
This is awesome.

451
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,460
Nice setting.

452
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,200
You did well with the setting.

453
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,000
Head inside.

454
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,800
Don't just stay out here.

455
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,600
Have a seat inside.

456
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,600
- Not bad.
- Not bad at all.

457
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,200
- Xiao Cheng.
- Mom.

458
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,200
Hello, Mrs. Duan.

459
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,000
Hello, everyone.

460
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Coach Wu. Coach Luo.

461
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
We meet again.

462
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,200
Yes.

463
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,000
Don't just stand there.

464
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,800
- Come in and have a seat.
- Okay.

465
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,600
We'll take a look around.

466
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,200
Make yourself at home. Don't be shy.

467
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,600
Mom,

468
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,800
why are you here?

469
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,600
I told you to clean up just a little.

470
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,000
Why did you display all these photos?

471
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,300
You asked me to have someone clean the house

472
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:51,000
and asked me to send the awards you've obtained since young.

473
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,600
Your dad and I figured out

474
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,200
that you're up to something.

475
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,100
Tell me the truth.

476
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:58,200
Is there a girl you like here?

477
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,100
Which one is she?

478
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,800
No, Mom. There's no such thing.

479
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,900
Come on. You can tell me.

480
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,200
There's no one, Mom. Stop asking.

481
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,800
Just tell me.

482
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,000
Hello, Mrs. Duan.

483
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,500
Hello there.

484
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,200
She's so pretty.

485
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,200
Coach Luo.

486
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,400
Doesn't she look compatible with Xiao Cheng?

487
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,000
Mom, stop talking nonsense.

488
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,500
- Coach Luo.
- She sure does.

489
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,490
I'm sure you know her.

490
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,500
Do you know her well?

491
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,700
How is she?

492
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,600
- She's really nice.
- "Really nice"?

493
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,600
I think so, too.

494
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,200
People our age sure have the same taste.

495
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,500
Mom, you're being ridiculous.

496
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,000
Is it easy for you to find girlfriends

497
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,400
with fit bodies like yours?

498
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,500
Not at all.

499
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,000
We're too busy training to find one.

500
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,300
Besides, no one dares to date girls from the track and field team.

501
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,200
I'll put it this way.

502
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,800
Imagine we're dating a girl from a throwing team.

503
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,300
If we're in a fight,

504
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:51,400
we won't survive if she uses a palm strike.

505
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,200
You seem to be implying something.

506
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,000
This is delicious.

507
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,200
Do you want me to save some beers for you?

508
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,000
When Sister Xia pushed Brother Tian with her palm,

509
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,200
he flew far away.

510
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,600
You can talk about anything you want.

511
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,500
Just don't drag me into this.

512
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,400
Skewers are ready.

513
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,600
The food is here.

514
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,300
Thank you, Sister Xia.

515
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,700
Cut it out. Eat before the food gets cold.

516
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:18,500
Come on, that's too obvious.

517
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,800
I'm serious about this, Tian.

518
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,600
You two grew up together.

519
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,800
If you ask me,

520
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,800
you should just date each other.

521
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,500
- Am I right?
- You guys should date.

522
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,800
That’s the taste of love.

523
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,700
You guys better stop.

524
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,300
She's four years older than me.

525
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,700
I get it now.

526
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,400
What's with the sudden outburst?

527
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,400
So what if she is four years older?

528
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,700
What did you say?

529
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,800
I said, "What's wrong with dating a girl"

530
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,700
"who is four years older?"

531
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,200
It's none of your business.

532
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,800
Listen up.

533
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,800
It's better to date an older girl.

534
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,400
They take good care of people

535
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,900
and are more mature.

536
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,100
Research shows

537
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,700
that girls live longer than boys.

538
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,400
Maybe they can die together

539
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,400
if the girl is older.

540
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,000
Stop drunk-talking.

541
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,600
I'm not drunk.

542
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,000
What's wrong with you?

543
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,800
What's wrong with him?

544
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,400
What are you looking for?

545
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,200
Watch where you're going.

546
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,300
Unbelievable, this boy!

547
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,000
It's okay. Just ignore him.

548
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,400
Let's look at his childhood photos.

549
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,400
The food is not ready yet.

550
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,500
It'll be ready soon.

551
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,500
What's wrong?

552
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,600
Why aren't you eating there?

553
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,200
I ate as I grilled.

554
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,000
I'm already full.

555
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Are you jealous?

556
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,000
My mom wanted to talk to her.

557
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I really don't like Shi Yin.

558
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,600
I don't like her at all.

559
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,700
Stop saying that we're a couple,

560
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,600
even if it's a joke.

561
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,800
Are you drunk?

562
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,800
I did drink.

563
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,800
I drank a lot.

564
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,900
But I'm not drunk.

565
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,800
Enough, stop standing here.

566
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,000
Aren't you afraid of the smoke?

567
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I'll help you.

568
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,600
No need. You're in my way.

569
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,000
Stop it already.

570
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,900
Just sit over there.

571
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,900
What's wrong with you?

572
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,900
What do you mean?

573
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:37,600
You've been avoiding me today.

574
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,500
Did I do something wrong?

575
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:47,000
Or do you hate me all of a sudden?

576
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,200
I don't hate you.

577
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,900
You do.

578
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,300
Maybe I'm under a lot of pressure

579
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,300
as Director Wang has higher expectations of us

580
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,100
after you won the gold medal.

581
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,400
Are you sure?

582
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:09,600
I asked my mom to put the medals here

583
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,900
so I can show them to you.

584
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,000
Enough already.

585
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
You won first place in high jump

586
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,600
and second in sprinting.

587
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,400
It's enough for me. Stop showing off.

588
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,400
I'm not.

589
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,600
I want to show you this one.

590
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,600
"First place"

591
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:36,100
"in the junior high jump category ages 10 to 12."

592
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,800
I was nine at the time.

593
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,000
I lied about my age for registration

594
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,800
to join this competition category.

595
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,000
Of course, other jumpers were a lot taller than me.

596
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,700
But I was confident I could win.

597
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,200
And I did win in the end.

598
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,100
Not bad.

599
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,800
You're very daring.

600
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,800
What athletes fear most is

601
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,400
that the more they compete,

602
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,300
the less courage they have.

603
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,000
That won't happen to me.

604
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,200
It won't happen in the future either.

605
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,400
Okay. I trust you.

606
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,700
- What are you doing?
- I'm giving it to you.

607
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,600
It's such a memorable medal.

608
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,800
You should keep it yourself.

609
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:27,000
That's precisely why I'm giving it to you.

610
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,900
In the future, I'll be the provincial,

611
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,000
national, and world champion.

612
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,400
I'll give all the medals to you.

613
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,400
Okay.

614
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,400
I'll have this for your safekeeping.

615
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,200
When you achieve all that,

616
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,400
I'll make a wall of fame for you.

617
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,400
Wear it.

618
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,800
Don't take it off.

619
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,600
I'm serious.

620
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,200
It's a promise.

621
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,400
It's a promise.

622
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,400
Duan Yu Cheng has someone he likes,

623
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,200
am I right?

624
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,000
I don't know.

625
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,400
I...

626
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,400
I don't think so.

627
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,600
Why has he been avoiding me then?

628
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,000
He always ignores me.

629
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:23,600
I think you might not be Duan Yu Cheng's type.

630
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,800
No.

631
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,000
That's not what I really meant.

632
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,200
I mean,

633
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,000
he's probably not interested in anyone,

634
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,300
or he doesn't know what love is.

635
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,500
That's right. He cares only about training.

636
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,800
Only his muscles develop but not his brain.

637
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,000
That's why his EQ (emotional quotient) is low.

638
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,600
He doesn't know anything about love.

639
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,400
Good point.

640
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,300
When his EQ improves,

641
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,600
he'll definitely like me.

642
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,400
Just eat before it gets cold.

643
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,400
I want to ask you something.

644
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,200
Do you really not want to know

645
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,800
who placed the thumbtack in your shoe?

646
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,800
I already knew.

647
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,600
It was Zhang Hong Wen.

648
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,600
How did you know?

649
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,900
"Thumbtack"?

650
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,000
What thumbtack?

651
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,800
Why was there a thumbtack?

652
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,600
Are you hurt?

653
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,800
Mom, the truth is...

654
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,000
Mrs. Duan, the truth is...

655
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Coach Luo,

656
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I'm asking my son.

657
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,200
Mom.

658
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,400
Coach, you should go.

659
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,300
I'll talk to my mom.

660
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,200
I'm responsible for this matter, too.

661
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,100
No, you aren't.

662
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,000
Just leave.

663
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,400
What happened?

664
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,200
Who did it?

665
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,500
You got hurt, and I have to keep quiet?

666
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,200
I need to talk to your school management.

667
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,800
Mom, come back here.

668
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,600
Don't go.

669
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,400
I should have told his mother

670
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,300
about his injury.

671
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,600
She wouldn't be upset now.

672
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,600
Do you know what you look like now?

673
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,200
A daughter-in-law meeting the parents.

674
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,500
I've told you countless times

675
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,800
to stop making a joke like this.

676
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,800
My relationship with Duan Yu Cheng

677
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,000
is a coach and an athlete.

678
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,500
As his coach,

679
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:50,100
I'm responsible to explain his injury to his parents.

680
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,200
I'll say this one more time.

681
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,800
There is nothing between us.

682
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,700
And he should date someone of Shi Yin's age.

683
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:03,400
If you keep talking nonsense, it'll be bad if others hear you.

684
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,100
What's the matter?

685
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,800
Nothing.

686
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:17,690
Don't worry.

687
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,700
This boy can handle it.

688
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,900
He's smart.

♫ That hates to be alone ♫

693
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,600
In the future, I'll be the provincial,

00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:11,200
national, and world champion.

695
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,000
I'll give all the medals to you.

What's wrong with you?

699
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,600
You've been avoiding me today.

700
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,400
Did I do something wrong?

701
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:37,200
Or do you hate me all of a sudden?

702
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
There are dozens of people

703
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,800
who can clear 2.12 m in our country.

704
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:49,200
How can he stand out among these people?

705
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,500
Tell me.

706
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,800
Duan Yu Cheng's height is a disadvantage

707
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,000
when it comes to high jump.

708
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,600
There are only a few exceptions in the world.

709
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,200
Letting him change to sprinting

710
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,200
is to let him go further.

♫ I'm on your side ♫

712

715
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:27,000
♫ Sunrise captures the silhouette of the island, while shadows dance across the tides ♫

716
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,800
♫ The waves chase after the footprints, breathing them in ♫

717

♫ I want to follow you; let the sun melt the distance between us ♫

♫ I'm faltering in my steps; I won't be too greedy ♫

♫ You can't hide your scent from me ♫

721
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,600
♫ We are stuck together ♫

722
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,200
♫ After the heavy rain's evaporation ♫

723

♫ The convenience store blasts with cold air ♫

♫ Stop checking your phone all the time ♫

726

♫ And pretending that you don't care about me ♫

727

♫ For me, summer is not just about ♫

♫ This passion will burn forever ♫

733
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:33,200
♫ Let's sprint toward the ocean ♫

734
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:40,100
♫ The blazing waves are glistening ♫

735
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:44,000
