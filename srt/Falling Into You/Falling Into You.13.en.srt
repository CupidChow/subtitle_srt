5
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,500
I didn't expect this guy's fitness level...

6
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The health examination report.

7

You scared me!

8

9

Why are you giving me his health examination report?

12

He's under Coach Yang now.

13

Hello, Coach Yang?

17
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,600
Luo Na, come to the gymnasium.

18
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,600
I have something to discuss with you.

19
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,000
Why don't you come to my office?

20
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,200
I'll wait for you here.

21
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,200
Why?

22
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,700
The office has poor air ventilation.

23
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,500
It's so stuffy.

24
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,400
Besides, I'm training the students right now. I can't leave.

25
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,300
All right then.

26
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,200
What about his health examination report?

27
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,800
Coach Yang.

28
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,700
Carry on. Don't stop.

29

Why are you just standing here?

30
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,800
You guys are training right now.

31
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,400
I was afraid I might interrupt you.

32
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,800
What's the matter?

33
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,800
Actually, it's nothing.

34
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,400
It's just that I came up with some ideas lately.

35
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,500
And I wish to tell you about them.

36
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,700
You see, next week, our province will organize training

37
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,800
for athletes participating in the National University Games.

38
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,200
I want to sign him up.

39
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,000
- You want him to join the National University Games?
- Yes.

40
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,200
It hasn't even been a week since he changed his event.

41
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,000
You must be joking.

42
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Who is joking?

43
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,300
Do you think I'd joke about competitions?

44
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,400
I've already contacted the person responsible for the provincial team.

45
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,400
Right now,

46
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,400
the provincial team has two high-performing decathlon athletes.

47
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,800
Both of them are injured.

48
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,200
Only one student from Sports University signed up.

49
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,700
He's mediocre.

50
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,200
Even so,

51
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,600
I'm sure he's better than an athlete who just changed his event.

52
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,500
I know that athlete well.

53
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,500
His standard is around 6,600 points.

54
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,800
But him?

55
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,100
He's good at sprint and high jump.

56
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,200
If he goes through long jump training,

57
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,900
he can reach 7 m easily.

58
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,000
For 100 m, 400 m, high jump, and long jump,

59
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,300
just these events,

60
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,700
with his current capability,

61
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,900
he can score 3,300 points.

62
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,400
Also, he's quite good at javelin too.

63
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,300
Do you know what that means?

64
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,400
It means he doesn't have many weaknesses.

65
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,200
A decathlete without any weaknesses?

66
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,900
That's a strength.

67
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,700
Pole vault.

68
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,300
I was most surprised about that.

69
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,400
He actually exceeded 4 m with his vault.

70
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,600
So...

71
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,800
I'm perplexed. It's as if he studied

72
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,600
everything about sports since he was young,

73
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,800
like he trained in all disciplines.

74
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,800
I'm not worried about the 110-meter hurdle.

75
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,300
I must give him some training for 1,500 meters.

76
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,800
Anyway, with a conservative estimate,

77
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,200
he can get around 6,300 points.

78
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,200
That result is more than enough

79
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,000
for him to compete in the National University Games.

80
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Are you that confident in him?

81
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,300
To be honest with you, when I saw this guy,

82
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,600
the excitement I felt was just like

83
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,100
when Coach Gao met Mao Mao Qi.

84
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,900
Both of them are prodigies.

85

- Yes.

86

All right, I'll take him away in two days.

87

Thank you for giving him a chance to compete.

00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,520
She told us

171
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,470
to get familiar with the place

172
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,310
and see if we could get better dormitories

173
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:14,750
for others who would go there in the future.

174
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,380
Is that all?

175
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,350
What's the matter?

176
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,510
It's nothing.

177
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,770
I feel like she's avoiding me.

178
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,310
"Avoiding you"? Why?

179
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:34,590
What did you do to make her angry again?

180
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:35,540
No matter what I've done,

181
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,600
she should come and clarify things with me.

182
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,050
She can scold or beat me,

183
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,730
but why is she trying to avoid me?

184
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:44,440
It's not like she can dodge me forever.

185
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,560
You're overthinking it.

186
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,970
Coach Luo is a busy person.

187
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,970
She doesn't have time to be petty with you.

188
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,110
Besides, I assume you've only committed a tiny mistake.

189
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,550
I guess she forgot it long ago.

190
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:22,060
It's 12:10 p.m.

191
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,290
If everything went well, he and Coach Yang Jin should have

192
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:26,910
already had their lunch with the provincial team.

193
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:33,010
I'm not thinking about them.

194
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,220
Why are you staring at me?

195
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,270
Is there something in my eyes?

196
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,510
Stop pretending.

197
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,650
Are you troubled by something?

198
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:52,640
What could I be troubled by?

199
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,750
If you're not troubled, why are you distracted all day?

200
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,200
It's as if you've lost your soul.

201
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,700
I'm not.

202
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,680
Let me ask you something.

203
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,150
Speak.

204
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,240
There's a coach I know.

205
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,930
She's a woman.

206
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:26,220
Which university? What event?

207
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,380
She's from Normal University.

208
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,570
She's a basketball coach.

209
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,170
Carry on.

210
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:36,300
She has a student

211
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,500
who has always trained with her.

212
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,370
He has always worked hard

213
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,720
and prepared well for competitions.

214
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,650
Suddenly, one day...

215
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:46,390
Can you get straight to the point?

216
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,650
Let me finish my words.

217
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:52,940
Anyway, one day,

218
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,740
that boy

219
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,600
kissed her.

220
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,120
What do you think it means?

221
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,750
He kissed her?

222
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,030
Yes.

223
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,770
Come on. Tell me what you think.

224
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:29,490
It depends on whether that coach likes the boy or not.

225
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,430
If she does,

226
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:36,370
it's a joyous occasion.

227
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,670
If she doesn't,

228
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,970
she can just ignore him.

229
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:42,750
When youngsters get ahead of themselves,

230
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,390
their drive will fade after a few days.

231
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,590
You're right.

232
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,830
Anyway, it's common for boys his age

233
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,120
to do something stupid like that.

234
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,360
Do you think he'll get over it?

235
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,970
Do you truly not like that boy?

236
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:07,320
Of course not.

237
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:10,250
I was referring to my friend.

238
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,770
Of course, she doesn't like him.

239
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,140
Not bad.

240
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,640
You two, come here.

241
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,640
Luo Na,

242
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,200
look.

243
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,600
The provincial team has approved our request to send the others.
[Sports Bureau of South Lake Province]

244
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,620
According to our superiors,
 [Sports Bureau of South Lake Province]

245
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,960
they want us to act quickly.

246
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,340
It's best if they can be there in two days.

247
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,220
Are you referring to me?

248
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,800
I think it's more appropriate for you to go there instead of me.

249
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,320
I can't go.

250
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,800
I still have to deal with the new semester recruitment.

251
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,860
Wait.

252
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,180
Usually, you two fight for any benefits you can get.

253
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:20,260
This time, you have a chance to go on a school-paid trip,

254
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,640
yet you don't feel like it?

255
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,840
Since when did you two become such excellent individuals?

256
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,760
I've never taken advantage of school expenses.

257
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,300
I think I'll pass this time.

258
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,720
I haven't finished my assignments yet.

259
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,180
Suit yourself.

260
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,860
I'll ask someone else to go. Give it to me.

261
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,680
I think I should go.

262
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:41,380
Making arrangements for students isn't a big deal anyway.

263
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,600
What about you?

264
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,900
I'm not going.

265
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,680
He's going.

266
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,440
Of course, he's going.

267
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,460
I can't handle this myself.

268
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,940
Listen up.

269
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,280
Return after checking conditions.

270
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,420
If you stay more than three days, you must pay for yourselves.

271
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,020
What's going on?

272
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,880
Are you taking only one sports t-shirt?

273
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,360
You won't be able to change it after sweating.

274
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,720
I ripped the other one during my training.

275
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,700
It's fine.

276
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,120
Senior Brother Duan is there as well.

277
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,480
He usually lets me wear his.

278
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,760
Have you told him

279
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,220
that you're heading there?

280
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:40,000
I have. I told him that you and Coach Wu would take us there.

281
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,880
But he seemed busy.

282
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,020
He hasn't replied to me yet.

283
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,680
You should bring your pillow.

284
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,480
Then you can sleep better in a new environment.

285
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:36,760
[Coach Luo, what are you doing?]

286
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,840
What are you doing?

287
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:03,200
Don't you know cellphones aren't allowed at training sessions?

288
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,660
Coach.

289
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,140
I told you to increase the weight.

290
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,960
Are you kidding me?

291
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,100
It was hard for us

292
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,980
to get a spot for you at the training camp.

293
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,700
Is this the attitude you're showing me?

294
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,600
Coach, I'm sorry.

295
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,880
Seems your heart is somewhere else.

296
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,780
Luo Na and Wu Ze have brought the others here.

297
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,100
Finish your sets

298
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,420
and have lunch with them.

299
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,200
Are they here already?

300
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,060
All right.

301
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,700
What are you doing?

302
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,820
Didn't you hear me?

303
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,240
I said, "Finish your sets."

304
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,660
All right.

305
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,800
Are you out of your mind?

306
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,440
Why do you look like you're on steroids after hearing that Coach Luo is here?

307
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,120
You don't need to be this obvious.

308
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,160
No, Coach. I'm just hungry.

309
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,840
Coach?

310
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,460
You are...?

311
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,700
I'm from Sports University.

312
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,940
I was around when you barged into

313
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,580
the municipal games' committee office to report

314
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,120
Zhang Hong Wen.

315
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,160
Coach, I'm sorry.

316
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,240
Before, I didn't know he'd use performance-enhancing drugs.

317
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,720
I thought you were trying to cause trouble for us.

318
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:39,260
You can take them to their dorms first.

319
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,060
Follow me.

320
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:48,100
Do you know how Zhang Hong Wen is doing

321
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,520
right now?

322
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,220
I don't know. He left after that incident.

323
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,800
Where did he go?

324
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,980
I'm not sure about that.

325
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,600
Our university is always strict when it comes to doping.

326
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,200
He was expelled as soon as the news was confirmed.

327
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,340
I've never heard from him after that.

328
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,280
What's your name?

329
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,940
Coach, my name is Zhang Bo.

330
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,640
- From which event?
- I'm a decathlete.

331
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,860
Train well.

332
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,140
The provincial training camp will help you improve a lot.

333
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,980
Yes, Coach.

334
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,320
Coach,

335
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,400
do you know Duan Yu Cheng?

336
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,900
I do.

337
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,400
What's wrong with him?

338
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,300
Nothing.

339
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,300
He registered as a decathlete as well.

340
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,400
He's amazing.

341
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,100
He's at this standard even though he changed his event not long ago.

342
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Have you seen him?

343
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Of course. We're training together right now.

344
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,300
If so, he should be at his dorm, right?

345
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,600
He should be.

346
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,700
The training will start in 30 minutes.

347
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,300
I think he's changing right now.

348
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,200
I'll head there first.

349
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,600
I need to help them sort things out.

350
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,400
Coach, take care.

351
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,000
Actually, you don't need to be so polite.

352
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I'm six or seven years older than you at most.

353
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,600
Even so, you're my senior.

354
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,900
My aunt is also seven years older than me.

355
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,900
See you.

356
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,900
Coach, take care.

357
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,800
You're a grownup, you know?

358
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,200
Can't you even make your bed?

359
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,000
It's a rectangle.

360
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,300
Put two corners together.

361
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,200
That's the width.

362
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,500
[National Training Base, South Lake University]
[Duan Yu Cheng, Mao Mao Qi]

363
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,800
Coach, stop rushing me.

364
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,200
I know how to do it.

365
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,500
I know.

366
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,800
I panic whenever you try to rush me.

367
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,700
You can easily agitate me.

368
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,600
Fine, I'll stay out of it.

369
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,000
Do whatever you want.

370
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,900
Coach.

371
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,300
Is it just you two?

372
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,600
Big Xia was left out.

373
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,000
She's sharing a room with a student from Sports University.

374
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,400
The rest of them are in the next room.

375
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,500
I need to head out. Keep this for me.

376
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,600
Wh-Where are you going?

377
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,200
I'm heading to the training ground.

378
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,700
Help Mao Mao unpack his stuff.

379
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,000
We got up at 5 a.m., you know?

380
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,700
Coach Wu.

381
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,700
She's so energetic.

382
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,200
I need to take a nap.

383
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:51,700
[Duan Yu Cheng, I'm at the provincial training camp now. Where are you?]

384
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,200
Who are you waiting for?

385
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,400
Mao Mao Qi and the rest are here today.

386
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,200
Did Coach Yang tell you about it?

387
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,300
How's your training?

388
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,000
Are you getting used to it?

389
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,200
I'm talking to you. Say something.

390
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,600
You're finally willing to see me.

391
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,800
Why should I avoid you?

392
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,800
So it's not because

393
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,000
you've brought other athletes here and incidentally paid me a visit?

394
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:51,200
Is this the way you speak to your coach?

395
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,800
Are you angry?

396
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,100
Scold me then.

397
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,600
It's been a long time since you scolded me.

398
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,200
Duan Yu Cheng!

399
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Did you even focus on your training?

400
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,300
I did.

401
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,700
Even if I was distracted, it was due to you.

402
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,500
You ignored me all of a sudden.

403
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,600
After that, you avoided me.

404
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,400
How could I focus on my training?

405
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,600
Just because of that trivial matter,

406
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,500
- you ignored me.
- "Trivial matter"?

407
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,200
You... follow me.

408
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,200
Why?

409
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,100
Follow me.

410
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,000
Get over here.

411
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,400
Put on your shirt.

412
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,300
Wrong way.

413
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,600
I'm done.

414
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,300
What's the matter?

415
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,100
What did you mean by that?

416
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,200
I don't get what you're saying.

417
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,200
Why do you want to talk to me here?

418
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,400
I'm not your parent.

419
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,300
Logically speaking,

420
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,700
I shouldn't be the one educating you.

421
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,400
However, as your coach,

422
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,500
I think I should be responsible for your mental development.

423
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,000
You're stalling.

424
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,100
Just get straight to the point.

425
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,200
Fine.

426
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,800
Tell me then.

427
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,700
What do you mean by "trivial matter"?

428
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,900
I think you should know

429
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,800
what I mean by that.

430
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,200
Yes, I do know what you mean.

431
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,800
So...

432
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,600
do you think it's a trivial matter?

433
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,800
That's not it.

434
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,400
I don't think that's a trivial matter.

435
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,800
- I just think that...
- Let me ask you this.

436
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,800
Is it because you're good-looking

437
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,400
that you flirt with girls this way?

438
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,800
Don't slander me.

439
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,700
Coach, I'd never do that.

440
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,600
Then why did you say it was a trivial matter?

441
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,800
Let me explain.

442
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,700
Although I said it was a trivial matter,

443
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,800
I didn't think it was a trivial matter.

444
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,700
I just think that...

445
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,000
Was that your first kiss?

446
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,200
Of course...

447
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,900
Of course not!

448
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,600
What are you laughing at? Be serious!

449
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,400
Coach, it's because you're not too good at lying.

450
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I know now.

451
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,900
I promise I didn't know before.

452
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,600
What I mean is...

453
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,300
I understand why you were angry at me.

454
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,800
I also understand why you avoided me.

455
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,000
I'm sorry.

456
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,800
I promise.

457
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,800
I...

458
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,000
I didn't know that beforehand.

459
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,400
However, I truly like...

460
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,200
Do you know how much older I am?

461
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,300
This has nothing to do with age.

462
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,600
I'm also your coach!

463
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,600
I'll treat it as if you acted on impulse

464
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,000
because of excessive hormones.

465
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,500
You better get over it as soon as possible.

466
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,100
Never do it again.

467
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,000
I didn't act on impulse.

468
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,300
Coach!

469
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,400
It was my first kiss as well.

470
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,400
Mao Mao.

471
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,200
Mao Mao Qi.

472
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,200
Get up.

473
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,300
Senior Brother, what's wrong?

474
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,500
Get up.

475
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,900
Get up.

476
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,600
I have something to ask you.

477
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,800
Let me ask you this.

478
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,600
Do you like Coach Luo?

479
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,400
I do.

480
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:38,300
Tell me then. Why do you like her?

481
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:42,200
Coach Luo is very nice.

482
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,200
She's nice to us.

483
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,700
She's also kindhearted.

484
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:50,000
My mother said that I need to remember

485
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,100
the people who treat me kindly.

486
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,300
I need to repay the favor in the future.

487
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,900
That's not what I mean.

488
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,800
What I mean is,

489
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,000
don't you think...

490
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,800
she's beautiful?

491
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,600
And

492
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,000
she's also very mature and prudent.

493
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,500
Although

494
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,100
she can be quite impatient

495
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,400
and violent sometimes,

496
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,600
she...

497
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,700
She might be harsh,

498
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,000
but she has a tender heart.

499
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,100
Just like what you've said, she's very kind.

500
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,600
Don't you think so?

501
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,800
"Beautiful"?

502
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,200
I don't think she's beautiful.

503
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,100
I like a woman like my mother,

504
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:39,000
who's short, has a big face

505
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,200
with big eyes.

506
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,600
That's what I call "beautiful."

507
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,800
I'm not insisting that you say she's beautiful.

508
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,800
Let me give you an example.

509
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,300
For example...

510
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,600
for example, if you meet a girl who is beautiful

511
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,800
and you're also into her,

512
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,400
what will you do then?

513
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,600
Senior Brother, I'm begging you.

514
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,400
I've never thought of that scenario before.

515
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,700
Please let me sleep.

516
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,800
No, you must think.

517
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,700
Think about it immediately.

518
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,400
Fine, I'll think about it.

519
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,800
-You must do it no matter what.
- I'll do it.

520
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,800
Senior Brother, I can't think of anything.

521
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,200
Senior Brother!

522
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,800
Senior Brother!

523
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,200
Senior Brother!

524
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,200
Senior, wake up!

525
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,600
Wake up!

526
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,900
Did you see the message in the group chat?

527
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,500
Coach Luo and Coach Wu are heading back now.

528
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,500
Check your phone!

529
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,400
What?

530
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,700
Coach Luo is leaving.

531
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,800
[Coach Wu and I will head back first.]

532
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,000
[You guys should train well.]

533
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,600
Once the training is over,

534
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,400
try to perform well in the competition.

535
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,900
Senior Brother, you haven't put on your pants yet!

536
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,000
Senior Brother, wait for me!

537
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,800
Don't be scared.

538
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,400
If you encounter any issues during training,

539
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,100
you can ask the coach here.

540
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,000
If you encounter any life issues,

541
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,800
you can go to Senior Brother Duan.

542
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,200
However, the other coaches are very smart.

543
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,000
Why are you afraid of them?

544
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,600
They expect you guys to achieve great results for the province.

545
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:22,000
If anyone dares to bully you, just call me.

546
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,600
Time to leave.

547
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,000
Wait.

548
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,700
Coach Luo,

549
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,500
can we talk in private?

550
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,700
Okay.

551
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,200
All right. You guys should head back.

552
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,000
See you.

553
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Coach Wu.

554
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,700
- Goodbye.
- Bye bye.

555
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:46,000
- Do your best in training.
- Okay.

556
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,900
I know what's on your mind.

557
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,700
You want to retire from the team?

558
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,400
I know it's a bit sudden,

559
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,200
but I've already made up my mind.

560
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,600
I'll present my request

561
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,000
once the National University Games are over.

562
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,800
With your abilities,

563
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,500
you can surely get on the national team.

564
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,800
You're still young,

565
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,200
and you're not plagued by injuries.

566
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,200
Why are you retiring?

567
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,600
- I...
- And your skills

568
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,600
are some of the best among the team members.

569
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,600
You have excellent mental capacity as well.

570
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,000
Although you're a little older than the others...

571
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,700
Jiang Tian.

572
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,000
It's because of Jiang Tian.

573
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,700
"Jiang Tian"?

574
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,000
What does this have to do with him?

575
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,400
Coach Luo,

576
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,200
don't you think you're too insensitive?

577
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,600
Wait, so you and Jiang Tian...

578
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,400
Are you two an item?

579
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,600
Yes.

580
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:00,400
But now Jiang Tian can no longer stay on the team.

581
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,200
He's having a hard time in high jump.

582
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,100
Coach Gao is only paying attention to Mao Mao Qi.

583
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,200
He could only participate in minor competitions.

584
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,300
He can't achieve anything big.

585
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,100
I'm not blaming Coach Gao here.

586
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:15,100
Sports are about survival of the fittest.

587
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:19,000
Jiang Tian's mental capacity and personality aren't suitable for this.

588
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,800
I've discussed it with him.

589
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,100
He has agreed to retire as well.

590
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,000
Regarding Jiang Tian,

591
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,600
we can discuss his matters again.

592
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,800
We planned for this long ago.

593
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,600
We plan to rent a shop behind campus

594
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,600
and start our own business.

595
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,200
If I join the national team,

596
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,500
he'll be all alone.

597
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:43,600
Coach Luo, I can't just leave him alone.

598
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,800
Will you two start a business?

599
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,800
Even if he plans to retire from the team,

600
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,000
he still needs to finish his studies, right?

601
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,800
Does Jiang Tian look like someone who can graduate?

602
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,700
Not everyone is Duan Yu Cheng, you know?

603
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,200
All right, I get it.

604
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,700
You should focus on the competition first.

605
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:08,600
After, we can talk on the way back to campus.

606
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,000
All right.

607
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,500
Do you know why I didn't confess to her?

608
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,400
Because you're a coward.

609
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,100
There's always someone better than you.

610
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,400
That's right.

611
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,300
I admit I'm a coward.

612
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,900
It's because I know I'm not good enough for her.

613
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,600
What about you?

614
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,100
What can you give her

615
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,300
except for a young man's impulsiveness?

616
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,200
Young athletes are coming up one by one.

617
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,400
How long can you stay as an athlete?

618
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,900
Do you have any idea?

619
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,600
Let's go.

620
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,900
Let's go.

621
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,800
I have something to tell him.

622
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,700
Wait for me in the car.

623
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,400
Don't scare me.

624
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,800
No matter how resilient I am,

625
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,400
I can't face too many shocks in one day.

626
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,200
Why are you leaving so soon?

627
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,600
I don't work as a coach here.

628
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,500
Why should I stay here?

629
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,700
Also, the new semester will start soon.

630
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,600
Mr. Wang has found some talents.

631
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,700
He wants us to check them out.

632
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,600
It's so soon.

633
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,600
Will new guys be coming in?

634
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,100
Of course.

635
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:06,000
It's been a year since you enrolled at South Lake University.

636
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,400
- But I...
- Time flies.

637
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:14,400
Big Xia and Jiang Tian will retire from the team soon.

638
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,900
"Retire"?

639
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,800
You must cherish these few years.

640
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,200
Train well and focus on your competitions.

641
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,600
Don't think of anything useless.

642
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,800
Don't leave any regrets behind.

643
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,000
What do you mean by "anything useless"?

644
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,000
What do you think?

645
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,200
I will earn the spot at the National University Games.

646
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,900
Prepare yourself.

647
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,300
Okay.

648
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,300
All right.

649
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,300
What do you want for dinner?

650
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,200
Hotpot or barbecue?

651
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,400
I'm fine with either.

652
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:10,400
Did you hear that Jiang Tian will retire from the team?

653
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,200
Big Xia is going with him.

654
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,600
Really?

655
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,200
They can retire then.

656
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,600
Is it expensive to rent a store

657
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,000
on the street behind our campus?

658
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:25,800
They're not cheap.

659
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,700
Something couldn't be cheap around the campus.

660
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,400
What's wrong?

661
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,600
Big Xia said she wants to rent a shop

662
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,200
on that food street after she retires.

663
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,200
However, neither of their families are wealthy.

664
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,500
And I'm sure they didn't save much these past few years.

665
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,800
I remember you have a friend

666
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,200
who does renovations, right?

667
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,400
Why don't you...

668
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:55,300
Don't you think you're being too concerned about them?

669
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,800
Is there a problem with that?

670
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,600
You need to set a limit.

671
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,300
Care for them all you like

672
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,700
while they're still on the team.

673
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:04,700
You shouldn't do so once they retire.

674
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,400
You don't even know if you'll pass your postgraduate studies

675
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,900
and retain a position on the team.

676
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:13,400
If you have time, pay more attention to yourself.

677
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,400
If I couldn't stay on the team,

678
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:19,700
I guess I'd worry about the athletes at South Lake University.

679
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,000
Just do them a favor.

680
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:26,300
You're totally wasting my time.

681
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,200
Since we're free this afternoon,

682
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,300
why don't you come to my house?

683
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,500
He's not doing too well lately.

684
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:45,600
Maybe he'll be happier if he sees you.

685
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,500
All right.

686
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,200
I plan to visit Coach Wang anyway.

687
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,800
♫ Sunrise captures the silhouette of the island, while shadows dance across the tides ♫

688
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:15,600
♫ The waves chase after the footprints, breathing them in ♫

689
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:19,400
♫ I want to follow you; let the sun melt the distance between us ♫

690
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,400
♫ I'm faltering in my steps; I won't be too greedy ♫

691
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,400
♫ The breeze shares with me a secret ♫

692
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,400
♫ You can't hide your scent from me ♫

693
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,200
♫ We are stuck together ♫

694
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,000
♫ After the heavy rain's evaporation ♫

695
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
♫ The convenience store blasts with cold air ♫

696
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,200
♫ But we are still sweating bullets ♫

697
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,000
♫ Stop checking your phone all the time ♫

698
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
♫ And pretending that you don't care about me ♫

699
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,100
♫ For me, summer is not just about ♫

700
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:47,000
♫ Carbonated drinks and jerseys ♫

701
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,800
♫ With clear and transparent courage ♫

702
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:55,400
♫ Don't stop me; I want to tell you everything ♫

703
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:03,000
♫ As long as you are here, I won't stop ♫

704
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,400
♫ This passion will burn forever ♫

705
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:18,000
♫ Let's sprint toward the ocean ♫

706
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:25,000
♫ The blazing waves are glistening ♫

707
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,800
♫ I look forward ♫

708
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,400
♫ To the infinite future ♫

709
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,400
♫ I leave everything behind except to stride with you across the sky ♫

710
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,800
♫ I'll give it my all to leap toward this stage ♫

711
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:47,800
♫ I look forward to the infinite future ♫

712
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:51,500
♫ You said there will be success and failure if I come to you ♫

713
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:55,700
♫ Great things come naturally ♫

714
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:59,500
♫ I look forward ♫

715
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:03,100
♫ To the infinite future ♫

716
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:07,000
♫ I leave everything behind except to stride with you across the sky ♫

717
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,600
♫ I'll give it my all to leap toward this stage ♫

718
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:18,600
♫ I look forward to the infinite future ♫

719
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:22,600
♫ You said there will be success and failure if I come to you ♫

720
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:28,100
♫ Great things come naturally ♫

721
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:34,200
♫ The blazing waves are glistening ♫
