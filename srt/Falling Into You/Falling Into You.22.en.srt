00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,500
I guess he is trying to beat Duan Yu Cheng with his results.

167
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,900
Doesn't he want Duan Yu Cheng to join the national team?

168
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,400
Of course not.

169
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,600
Only three people can win medals.

170
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,600
All athletes must fight hard for a position

171
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,800
in the national or international games.

172
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,600
Who'd want such a strong opponent as Duan Yu Cheng?

173
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,000
And I heard that this time,

174
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,400
the sponsor wants to shoot an advertisement

175
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,600
with a less popular event, to promote an unknown grassroots character.

176
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,000
Now both men's and women's decathlon are possible choices.

177
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,800
If you were a sponsor,

178
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,600
with Duan Yu Cheng and Cai Li Qiu before you,

179
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,400
who would you pick?

180
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,600
It's too early to discuss that.

181
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,900
We should focus on the game now.

[Jiangzhou: 2017 National Athletics Championships. Day Two]

183
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,600
Among the events today, javelin is your best event.

184
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,400
Take good advantage of it.

185
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,600
In other events,

186
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,000
you can reserve some physical strength.

187
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,200
Save it to fight for the 1,500 meters.

188
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,600
Give me a signal if you hear me.

189
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,600
It'll be her birthday soon.

190

Who?

191
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,200
- My girlfriend.
- Oh. What?

192
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,600
When did you get a girlfriend?

193
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,400
How come I didn't know?

194
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,200
Have you reported it to the team?

195
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,600
Has Director Wang approved?

196
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,000
We've dated a while.

197
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,600
I'll introduce her to you when I get the chance.

198

I know that everything you said was reasonable.

this is hard for you to accept.

Fine. I want you to...

apart from breaking up with him.

I'm sure we can find solutions.

00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,400
In fact, I already noticed it

when you came to my house.

I knew something was wrong with him.

275
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,800
If so, you knew before I did?

276
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,300
You found it out so early.

277
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,600
Why didn't you stop him then?

278
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,000
What a pity.

279
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,100
Are you blaming me now?

280
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,600
That's not what you think at all.

281
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,600
You promised me that you

282
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,500
would do only what's good for him.

283
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,800
That's right.

284
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,600
Is this what's good for him?

285
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,100
Is it not?

286
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,200
You are older than him.

287
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,000
Isn't your husband eight years older than you?

288
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,500
That's different.

289
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,400
He is a man, and you're a woman.

290
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,900
Men and women should be equal.

291
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,500
The average life span of women is longer than men's.

292
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,100
I'm a bit older than him.

293
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,200
Then maybe when we get old,

294
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,000
we can die...

295
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Are you talking about my son's death already?

296
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,600
No, no.

297
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,100
That's not what I meant.

298
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,600
I mean

299
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,900
that women older than men

300
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,600
and men older than women

301
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,600
are actually the same thing.

302
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,300
I disapprove.

303
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,400
I disapprove of your relationship.

304
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,800
Let's put your ages aside.

305
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,400
Just like you said,

306
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,400
now is the critical moment of Xiao Cheng's career.

307
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,600
A relationship will affect him in a bad way.

308
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,500
I understand your worries,

309
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,000
but I promise that I will not...

310
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,400
What are you doing?

00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,200
What are you doing?

312

Didn't I tell you not to talk to her alone?

313
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,800
I'm asking you what you're doing.

314

Did you leave the middle of the game?

315
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,800
Right, the game isn't over yet, is it?

316
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,700
Haven't I told you...

318
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,400
What?

319
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,800
Do you know how important this competition is?

320
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,600
I can't believe you left the game

321
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,600
for such a trivial matter!

322
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,000
This isn't a trivial matter.

327
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,900
Why... why do you want to break up with me?

328
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,600
You dare ask me why.

329

Get back to the game right now!

330
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,400

00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,500
I won't see you ever again!

334
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,500
Will 7300 do?

335
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,600
Enough talking!

336
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,900
- Luo Na, you two...
- I...

337
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,900
It starts now.

338
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,370
He did well at Javelin.
[Javelin. Duan Yu Cheng: 66 m]

339
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,000
It exceeded our expectations.

340
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,600
There is only the 1,500 meters left.

341
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,700
Will he reach 7400 points?

342
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,200
To 7400?

343
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,800
The 1,500 meters is not his specialty.

344
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,300
To get 7400 points,

345
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,600
he must finish the run within four minutes.

346
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,800
His best result so far

347
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,500
was 4.12 minutes.

348
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,900
What does it mean?

349
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,400
You want him to aim for the medals.

350
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,600
We can have dreams.

351
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,400
Interesting.

352
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,300
You two are very much alike.

353
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,500
However,

354
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,400
games aren't like training and not up to us.

355
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,000
Dreams won't help you.

356
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:51,200
You can do it.
[Men's 1,500 Meters]

357
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,000
In the final 100 meters,

358
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
all athletes are giving their best.

359
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,300
Come on! Come on!

360
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,200
Cai Li Qiu took the lead in crossing the line

361
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,200
and won his third Nationals.

362
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,100
He took home the championship.
[No. 2, Duan Yu Cheng, 4:09.06]

363
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:10,000
Duan Yu Cheng and Zhang Bo arrived right after him.

364
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,000
Please, 7,400 points.

365
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,600
I must reach 7,400 points.

366
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Ladies and Gentlemen,

367
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,800
the screen will show you

368
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,000
the total score ranking

369
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,800
of athletes participating in this year's men's decathlon.

370
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,800
Cai Li Qiu, 7750 points.
[No. 4, Duan Yu Cheng, 7375]

371
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,300
He defended his title again.

372
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,300
Duan Yu Cheng. Duan Yu Cheng.

373
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,200
Duan Yu Cheng, hello.

374
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,200
I heard this was your first time

375
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,800
participating in a national competition.

376
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,800
You got such good results on the first try.

377
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,000
Are you happy with your performance?

378
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,000
It was okay.

379
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,800
You were so close to claiming a medal.

380
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,700
Does that leave you with some regret?

381
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,400
It's all right.

382
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,400
You did exceptionally well in the javelin throw

383
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,900
and won this event's first place.

384
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,400
Did you focus training on this event?

385
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,000
Not really, I was in good condition.

386
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
So I managed to throw it a bit further.

387
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,800
Excuse me, the athlete needs to rest.

388
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,000
Okay, okay.

389
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,600
Thank you for your time.

390
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,400
Hopefully, I'll see you soon.

391
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,300
[Lu Yao, reporter]

392
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,700
First time being interviewed?

393
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,000
Well done.

394
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,100
Your answers were flawless.

395
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,300
Only this way you prevent people from finding your faults

396
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,300
and exaggerating them.

397
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,000
Coach, why are you so happy?

398
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,500
You tell me.

399
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,200
I'm not worried you may get cocky.

400
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,800
Your overall performance this time

401
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,400
is unexpectedly good.

402
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,500
Yesterday, you said you want to win as champion.

403
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,600
I thought you were daydreaming.

404
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,200
But judging by your performance these two days,

405
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,800
it's really possible.

406
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,700
Perhaps, you'll be someone extraordinary one day.

407
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:18,200
But my results aren't that good, are they?

408
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,300
Good attitude is spot on.

409
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,600
Modesty makes people progress.

410
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,600
You did well in each individual event,

411
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,300
but your physical strength clearly dropped the next day.

412
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,000
The most important thing in decathlon games

413
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
is to allocate your physical strength.

414
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,600
Take Cai Li Qiu as an example.

415
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,200
He has a mature method of competing in decathlons.

416
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,200
But again,

417
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,800
your performance was already quite good.

418
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,200
- Really?
- Of course.

419
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,700
Very good.

420
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,500
Is 7375 a high score, too? Right?

421
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,200
Of course.

422
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,800
There's no need to reach 7400, right?

423
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,000
Who said you needed to?

424
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,600
Don't get too proud.

425
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,100
You've come this far.

426
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,800
You almost won a medal.

427
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,500
Yet you missed it when you were so close.

428
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,600
Don't you think it's upsetting?

429
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,800
Next time, Coach.

430
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,500
I'll win medals next time.

431
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,400
Thank you, Coach.

432
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,500
Where are you going?

433
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,800
To find my girlfriend.

434
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,600
Oh, right.

435
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,400
You haven't explained to me about your girlfriend. Stop right there!

436
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,400
Hey, Beauty.

437
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,400
What are you doing? Put me down.

438
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,800
Let go of me.

439
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,000
Tell me this first.

440
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,900
Say you were just kidding about breaking up with me.

441
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,610
You were just scaring me, right?

442
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:35,670
Put me down first.

443
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:38,720
I won't, unless you answer my question.

444
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,400
A 7375 is also a nice score. Am I right?

445
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,500
Yes.

446
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,200
I was just kidding.

447
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,300
The 7375 is a very nice score.

448
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,900
Put me down.

449
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,300
Hurry.

450
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,950
But...

451
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:06,430
but you must obey the rules.

452
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,600
Are you aware of your own mistakes?

453
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,400
How many times have I told you?

454
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,500
Nothing is as important as your game.

455
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,000
You left as soon as you threw the javelin.

456
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,600
You didn't even know if it was foul.

457
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,200
Will you fool around again?

458
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,800
I won't.

459
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,200
I was wrong.

460
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,000
I swear I'll change.

461
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,200
Right, did Director Wang find out about our relationship?

462
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,800
How do you know?

463
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,300
That's just how my mom is.

464
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,800
Did she say anything to you?

465
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,200
You should have told me first

466
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,400
and let me talk to her.

467
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,800
She didn't say much.

468
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,400
You'll only make things worse.

469
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,600
But I got a good result, didn't I?

470
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,800
He won't say anything about it.

471
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,400
You might be right.

472
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,000
You were only 25 points short.

473
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,600
There isn't any proof anyway.

474
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,100
You can find a way to get away with it.

475
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,600
What?

476
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,600
Give me a hug.

477
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,600
No.

478
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,100
- Why not?
- So many people are here.

479
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,800
Where are the people? Nobody is here.

480
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,800
No.

481
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,200
Stop.

482
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,600
Duan Yu Cheng,

483
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,200
I can't believe you said those words.

484
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,500
I was telling the truth.

485
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,200
Look how well I performed today.

486
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,000
That is the power of love.

487
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,800
Coach Yang, why don't you take a seat?

488
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,500
Calm down first.

489
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,500
Okay? Take a seat.

490
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,800
Here is the thing.

491
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:41,200
They all say that the castle

492
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,400
is destroyed from the inside.

493
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,800
Luo Na,

494
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
good for you.

495
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,000
I am your mom.

496
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,400
I do everything for your good.

497
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,400
Ha ha (what a joke).

498
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,400
If you did it for my good,

499
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,200
you wouldn't come today.

500
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,200
If you hadn't come,

501
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,800
maybe I could have performed better

502
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,400
and won a bronze medal.

503
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,400
Can you blame me for that?

504
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,000
You should blame her!

505
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,300
I disapprove.

506
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,300
I firmly disapprove.

507
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,600
Having a relationship now

508
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,500
will surely affect his performance.

509
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,600
You were coaching him for a while.

510
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,000
Why don't you understand him at all?

511
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,200
Duan Yu Cheng is the kind of athlete

512
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,300
who needs love to nourish him.

513
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:36,400
Only then he makes progress.

514
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,600
Mom,

515
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,800
I am really tired from the nationals.

516
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,600
Please give me a break.

517
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,200
If you approve or not,

518
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,310
she is your daughter-in-law.

519
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,200
Duan Yu Cheng, what do you mean?

520
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,800
Did you steal the household register and marry her?

521
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,200
Mom, can you come to your senses?

522
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,600
I can't!

523
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,400
Mom, Mom!

524
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,400
Not everyone is like you and my father

525
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,400
who stole the household register to get married.

526
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,900
You...

527
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,700
Who is it?

528
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,800
Is it your coach?

529
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,200
Why... why are you here?

530
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,500
Come home with me.

531
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,000
Now?

532
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:08,400
Wh-What kind of theory was that?

533
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,300
Duan Yu Cheng has really got into your head.

534
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,600
Isn't that nice?

535
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,400
Isn't he your favorite athlete?

536
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,600
Maybe you'll like me as well.

537
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,700
I won't talk to you anymore.

538
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:24,400
I'm going to Wang Qi Lin for an explanation.

539
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,400
Coach Yang, don't be angry.

540
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,800
If you see my point of view,

541
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,000
please talk to Director Wang for me.

542
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,200
You're beyond help!

543
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,100
You're completely beyond help.

544
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,700
Don't look at your mom.

545
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,000
I'll leave her to you, Dad.

546
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,100
Rest assured.

547
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,400
About the relationship,

548
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,400
have you made up your mind?

549
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,900
I really like her.

550
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,000
I must be with her.

551
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,300
That's good then.

552
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,800
You've grown up.

553
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,400
You have your own ideas.

554
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,200
As parents, we won't interrupt you.

555
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,800
Don't worry.

556
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,200
I'll take care your mom.

557
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,400
She won't disturb you.

558
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,200
I have no objection to your relationship with Luo Na.

559
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,500
But since you've decided to be with her,

560
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,400
you need to take on responsibilities.

561
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,600
Be a man.

562
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,500
Don't let her down.

563
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,300
I know.

564
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,500
That's all I have to say.

565
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,500
Take care of yourself.

566
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,400
Call me if you ever need something.

567
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,300
Okay.

568
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,900
I'm going.

569
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,100
Go back.

570
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,300
See you, Dad and Mom.

571
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,300
He is talking to you.

572
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,700
Don't bother me.

573
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,600
- Bye now.
- Drive safely.

574
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,000
Did your mom leave?

575
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,200
Yes.

576
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,800
She was moved by our beautiful love story.

577
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,700
You didn't give in, did you?

578
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,300
What if I did?

579
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,000
You can't.

580
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,800
If you give in, I'll...

581
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,800
I will lock you in this room

582
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,400
and have you eat takeout every day

583
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,500
until you promise me.

584
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,600
Don't worry.

585
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,400
I made a promise.

586
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,100
I will take on my responsibility.

587
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,200
Are you tired?

588
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,500
Do you want to sleep?

589
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,800
Not yet.

590
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,000
It tickles.

591
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,200
♫ I'd rather see the world with these eyes ♫

592
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,900
One more kiss.

593
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,700
Do you promise to behave yourself in future?

594
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:36,000
♫ This vision of sight ♫

595
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,200
Didn't I promise you already?

00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:50,950
♫ And if we can ♫

597

♫ And if we have a say in this ♫

600
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,000
Why are you still so energetic now?

601
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,100
Did you try your best in the games?

602
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,300
Of course, I did.

603
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,600
You tell me.

604
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,800
I got more points than Coach Yang expected, didn't I?

That hurts.

607
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,400
You didn't win the gold medal.

608
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,600
Why would I need a gold medal?

609
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,000
If you had won the gold medal,

610
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,400
we might have more passion now.

611
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,600
What do you mean?

612
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,600
Do you mean from now on, when I hold you,

613
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,200
I must hang a medal on me to make you happy?

614
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,200
No medal this time.

615
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,000
I owe you one.

616
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,300
Luo Na!

617
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,400
Is Duan Yu Cheng in your room?

618
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,100
No. I... I didn't see him.

619
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,000
Are you sure?

620
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,200
Is anything wrong?

621
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,600
The national team coach is here to see him.

622
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,800
Never mind.

623
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,300
I'll find him elsewhere.

624
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,400
Hang on.
