[Adapted from the novel "Blazing Trail" by Twentine]

3
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,500
[Episode 9]

4
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,000
You don't know this, but the Sports University's coach and I

5
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,400
have known each other a long time.

6
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,700
We were on the provincial team together in the past.

7
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,300
The boy he recommended to me is called Mao Mao Qi.

8
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,500
He said he's got a lot of potential.

9
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,000
Drive faster.

10
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,500
Okay.

11
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,400
Slow down, slow down.

12
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,700
By the way,

13
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,400
this former teammate of mine

14
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,000
has really discovered many talents.

15
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,400
Like this boy we're seeing,

16
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,100
he made him sound like he's really amazing.

17
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,600
He said that during an indoor competition in the city last year,

18
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,000
the boy jumped without putting much effort,

19
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,600
and he actually placed.

20
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,500
Whether he's that good or not, we need to see it ourselves.

21
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,000
Come on, drive steady.

22
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,500
It's not my problem. The road is bumpy.

23
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,000
Director Wang, are you okay?

24
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,200
Do you want to get off and throw up a little?

25
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,700
Have we come to the wrong place?

26
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,400
Are you sure this is it?

27
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,000
This should be the place.

28
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,800
Don't you know?

29
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,200
Great talent is found in humble places, understand?

30
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,200
Stop right there!

31
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,100
I'm sorry, Coach!

32
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,800
You're not going anywhere!

33
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,800
- Coach!
- Don't run.

34
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,200
- I'm sorry, Coach!
- Stop right there!

35
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,500
You'd better stop! Stop there!

36
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,400
I'm sorry, Coach!

37
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,200
- I'm sorry, Coach!
- You brat!

38
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,200
Look, this boy runs like he's weightless.

39
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,700
Look at his thigh muscles.

40
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,400
How could his father beat him like this?

41
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,300
You brat!

42
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,600
How dare you run!

43
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,000
Ge Ge. Help me, your brother, Ge Ge.

44
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You shirked your responsibility.

45
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,200
Have you become dumb from all the beatings?

46
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,600
Do you think I can save you?

47
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,600
How dare you not practice properly!

48
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,600
- Are you going to run again?
- No, no.

49
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,600
It's Old Li.

50
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,800
- Are you still going to slack off?
- Old Li.

51
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,100
Old Li!

52
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,000
Oh, Old Wang, when did you get here?

53
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,200
Why didn't you tell me ahead of time?

54
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,000
I just got here.

55
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,600
This brat has learned... He learned to slack off!

56
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,800
- Stop hitting him.
- I will train properly.

57
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,300
- Say hi to the coach.
- Stop hitting him.

58
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,360
Hi, Coach!

59
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,360
- Call him Coach Wang!
- Painful.

60
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,001
Coach Wang!

61
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:38,680
- Hi, Coach Wang!
- This is Coach Luo.

62
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,300
- Hi, Coach Luo.
- Coach Luo, right?

63
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,000
- Say hi to Coach Luo... This brat.
- Hi, Coach Luo!

64
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,400
This brat is driving me crazy.

65
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,800
He slacks off all the time.

66
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,600
- Are you going to slack off again?
- No.

67
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,200
Are you going to slack off again? I'll break your legs!
- I don't dare.

68
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,000
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Coach.
- So infuriating.

69
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,190
His coach said this boy's family is very poor.

70
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,310
He had to drop out after finishing junior high.

71
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:19,000
He's been helping at his family's car wash.

72
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,800
He said he's a good talent.

73
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,800
Well, we have to check it out ourselves.

74
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,600
Mao,

75
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,800
make me proud later.

76
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,000
Not everyone has such a chance.

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I managed to get one for you.

78
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,800
But you have to seize it yourself.

79
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,600
If you can get into the university, it will change your life.

80
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,200
Do you understand?

81
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:46,000
Do you want to stay in your family's car wash all your life?

82
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,600
Brat!

83
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,600
Come on, dream big!

84
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,700
Pull yourself together!

85
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,400
Remember the moves. Do your best.

86
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,200
That's right, Brother.

87
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,700
Do your best.

88
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,800
If you fail, I'll tell Mom.

89
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,800
And she will punish you.

90
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,100
His natural wavy hair is quite unique.

91
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,700
Look at that smile on your face.

92
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,300
I just think the coach-athlete relationship

93
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,000
is rather interesting.

94
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,200
Certainly not as interesting as your relationship with Duan Yu Cheng.

95
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,800
You can do it, Brother Mao Mao!

96
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,800
You can do it, Brother Mao Mao!

97
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:41,600
You can do it!

98
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,448
Bravo!

99
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,000
What do you think?

100
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,000
He jumped over 2.1 m just like that!

101
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,700
That's right, Old Wang!

102
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,200
Old Li, you found a hidden gem!

103
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,400
Listen to yourself.

104
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,000
Old Wang, I found a hidden gem for you!

105
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Yes, yes!

106
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,600
Well done!

107
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,000
It's 2.1 m

108
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,500
as if gravity doesn't work on him.

109
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,600
He jumped over just like that.

110
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,800
Great job!

111
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,400
Duan Yu Cheng,

112
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,800
looks like you will hit the wall soon.

113
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,800
How's his academic performance?

114
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,000
This child hasn't been to school for two years.

115
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,600
He has fallen behind a lot.

116
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,200
So I made him study last year.

117
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,000
If he can get some tutoring,

118
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
he can get 200 or 300 points.

119
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,900
He has a national first-grade athlete certificate.

120
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,000
That's enough points.

121
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Let us take and train him a few months first.

122
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,200
After he takes the gaokao (entry exam), he can enroll directly.

123
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,600
Really?

124
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,600
That's great, Old Wang!

125
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,600
That's wonderful! Wonderful!

126
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm telling you, as long as the boy can attend university

127
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,300
and receive proper training, I assure it won't be long

128
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,000
- before he achieves outstanding results.
- Right, right.

129
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Don't worry.

130
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,300
It's decided just like that?

131
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,000
Will you discuss it with his family first?

132
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,500
Aren't they are here now? Let's discuss it now.

133
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,400
- Teachers, please have something to drink.
- Thank you.

134
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,600
- Here.
- Thank you.

135
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,800
Drink up.

136
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,400
None in three generations of our family was a university student.

137
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,700
If you accept him into your university,

138
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,700
our ancestors are going to be so proud!

139
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,200
Look how happy she is.

140
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,000
When you get to the university, you must be obedient.

141
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,300
You must listen to your teachers.

142
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,400
Teacher, if he disobeys, you can beat him.

143
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,800
W-We don't hit our students.

144
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,000
Yes, we can't.

145
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,800
- It's Coach.
- Coach Luo, how about this?

146
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,500
Why don't you go with them to pack his things?

147
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,000
- Take him to our university first.
- Okay.

148
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,200
I'll stay for a few days to take care of the paperwork.

149
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,500
- Okay.
- Okay.

150
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,600
Don't worry.

151
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,000
It's final.

152
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Teacher, I will entrust him to you.

153
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,900
Don't worry.

154
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,400
We will take good care of him.

155
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,400
He's a shy boy.

156
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,600
It's just who he is.

157
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,200
Everyone here is a first-grade athlete.

158
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,400
Why does he get to enter the team early for training?

159
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,600
Besides, it's not easy to get 200 points.

160
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,000
What if he can't get it?

161
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,100
Will they return him?

162
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,000
I thought he arrives this afternoon.

163
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,100
This can't do.

164
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,600
This can't do.

165
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,600
Everything is wrong on the high jump team.

166
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,800
Big Wang gets to decide everything.

167
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,600
He's going to recruit some random boy into our team.

168
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,200
Coach Luo is even at his beck and call,

169
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,600
to follow him anywhere.

170
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,300
Beck and call, as if!

171
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,900
Your family is at his beck and call.

172
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,200
Calm down, Sir.

173
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,400
Calm down.

174
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,700
I think you are a wise man.

175
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,800
Why don't you switch sides?

176
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,600
- Let's make an alliance and go against...
- Hi, Coach Luo.

177
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,500
Hi, Coach Luo.

178
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,400
Why did you stop talking once you saw me?

179
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,700
It's okay.

180
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,000
They are your seniors.

181
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,800
The taller one is Liu Shan.

182
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,000
This is Duan Yu Cheng.

183
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,400
I'm Liu Shan.

184
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,600
He's your junior, Mao Mao Qi.

185
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,000
He's quite young.

186
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,400
He just turned 18 this September.

187
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,500
Do take care of him.

188
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,200
Why does this brat seem he hasn't fully woken up yet?

189
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,600
Liu Shan!

190
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,300
I was saying we will take good care of him.

191
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,200
Right, Short Guy?

192
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,000
Let's go.

193
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,800
Allow me.

194
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,800
The high jump team is the most cohesive and welcoming.

195
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,400
Even if he's a transfer student who doesn't even know

196
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,100
if he'll pass the gaokao, we won't discriminate against him.

197
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,600
Come on in.

198
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,000
This bunk is unoccupied.

199
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,400
Come on, give it to me.

200
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,100
Come on.

201
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,600
Will you just let Coach Luo make the bed for you?

202
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,000
Yes.

203
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,200
I was just thinking how odd it was.

204
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,800
Coach,

205
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,800
how come we didn't get this treatment when we joined the team?

206
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,900
Knock it off.

207
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,800
You guys should have dinner together tonight.

208
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,800
You are all on the high jump team now.

209
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,300
Get familiar with each other.

210
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,200
Can we reimburse it?

211
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,400
You're asking for a beating again.

212
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,700
No reimbursement.

213
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,800
It'll be my treat.

214
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,800
- Invite Jiang Tian, too.
- Okay.

215
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,300
That's what I waited to hear.

216
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,000
Come on!

217
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,700
Give it to me.

218
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,600
This is where you put your water bottle.

219
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,400
Let me do it.

220
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,400
Do you know how to do it?

221
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Coach.

222
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,200
What are we having tonight?

223
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,500
- How about crayfish?
- Sure.

224
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,200
Let's satisfy our cravings before the season starts.

225
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,200
Do you like crayfish?

226
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,400
Don't just nod and shake your head.

227
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,200
Speak your mind.

228
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,700
I don't know.

229
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,300
I never had crayfish before.

230
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,600
Have people never had crayfish even these days?

231
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,700
Go with them tonight.

232
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,800
It's quite tasty,

233
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,600
as long as you can eat spicy food.

234
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,900
Aren't you going with us?

235
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,400
I may have something to do tonight.

236
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,200
You guys go.

237
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,700
Enjoy it.

238
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,800
So get along well with your seniors.

239
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,000
If you have any questions, ask them both.

240
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Tell him about the team tonight.

241
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,200
- You will train together starting next week.
- Okay.

242
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,600
Go to him if you need any help.

243
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,400
He will help you.

244
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,000
Me?

245
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,200
Come on.

246
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,400
Call him Senior.

247
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,100
Senior.

248
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,800
Yes.

249
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,400
Senior.

250
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,500
Okay, bye.

251
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,900
Help him clean up.

252
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,000
Come here. Call me Senior.

253
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,700
Let me hear it.

254
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,800
Call me Senior.

255
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,200
Senior.

256
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,700
Okay.

257
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,800
He's not a child anymore.

258
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,200
Why are you so worried about him?

259
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,000
He is different from all of you.

260
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,600
He just came to the big city.

261
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,600
He would feel insecure.

262
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,200
Well, you didn't have to buy him a toothbrush and cups too.

263
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,700
You even made the bed for him.

264
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:12,000
You can take care of him for a while, but not forever, right?

265
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,200
That's right.

266
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,600
That's why I entrusted him to you.

267
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,400
Were you being serious?

268
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,300
Don't you want to?

269
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,900
I will do it.

270
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,400
I will look after him.

271
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,600
- It's better than you taking care of him.
- What?

272
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,800
I said I'll take care of him better than you can.

273
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,300
Bye.

274
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,000
I've seen people eat grapes without spitting out the skin,

275
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,300
but this is the first time

276
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,400
I've seen someone eat crayfish without spitting out the shell.

277
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,000
This boy is tough.

278
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I need to record this moment.

279
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Look into my camera.

280
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,600
Why is it finished?

281
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,100
Order more for him.

282
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,200
"More"?

283
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,600
Didn't you see how much he ate?

284
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,400
Well, we must feed him until he's full.

285
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,000
This is the first time we took him out for dinner.

286
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,400
And it's Coach Luo's treat.

287
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,800
If he's not full, it'll embarrass Coach Luo.

288
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,400
Right?

289
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,300
He's a bigger eater than Duan Yu Cheng.

290
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,200
What?

291
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,600
Excuse me!

292
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,600
Two more plates of this.

293
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,000
Is he a bigger eater than me?

294
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,800
[¥1,088 ($150)]

295
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,600
Duan Yu Cheng,

296
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,700
it's just crayfish; why would you want to compete with him?

297
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:26,100
This meal costs over 1,000 yuan.

298
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,300
Why don't you two compete in high jump

299
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,900
if you have that much energy?

300
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,400
Boss, one more drink!

301
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,200
Why are you looking at me?

302
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,600
Go and jump if you are ready.

303
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,200
Oh, darn.

304
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,300
This boy really can clear 2.1 m.

305
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,100
His approach run and rhythm were wrong.

306
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,800
How did he...

307
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,000
He just floated over it.

308
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,800
Come. Come here.

309
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,400
Listen,

310
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,400
you jumped over, but your...

311
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,900
approach run actually is completely wrong.

312
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,500
Did you see that?

313
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,800
I'm talking to you! Do you not hear me?

314
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,200
I saw it! I'm not blind.

315
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,400
Don't shout. What's wrong with you?

316
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,600
The big problem now is your calf muscle is quite weak.

317
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,000
In future, we regulate the movement of your approach run.

318
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,700
As for your calf... Hey!

319
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,800
Relax.

320
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,900
Let me introduce him to you.

321
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,000
What's the matter with you, Boy?

322
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,600
You walked away as I was talking.

323
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,300
This is Coach Gao Ming Shuo.

324
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:11,000
He's your specific sports coach from now on.

325
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,000
What's with that look?

326
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,800
You are fierce.

327
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,800
I'm "fierce"?

328
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,700
I'm fierce, you say?

329
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,800
You haven't seen me get really fierce.

330
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,800
Go back to your training.

331
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,100
Go on.

332
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,500
Go. Come on. Train well.

333
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,000
Time for training!

334
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,200
Jiang Tian!

335
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,900
Lead the team for a jog to warm up.

336
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,200
Come on, Guys. Let's go jogging.

337
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,500
I don't feel like moving.

338
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,800
Go.

339
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,000
I'm telling you, this boy won't stay with us long.

340
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,700
I'm sure the national team will take him soon.

341
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:54,770
You speak very highly of him.

342
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,200
He's gifted.

343
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,200
He was born to do this.

344
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,000
I'm telling you, we found a treasure.

345
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,500
What do you think about your new junior?

346
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,700
He's okay.

347
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,200
I'm better than him.

348
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,700
Get over yourself.

349
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,400
Do you feel any pressure?

350
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,600
What pressure would I have?

351
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,100
He's not better than me anyway.

352
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,800
Stop there.

353
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,200
What's wrong with you?

354
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,200
Who upset you this time?

355
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,200
No one.

356
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,000
I thought we made a promise to each other.

357
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,500
Aren't you being too nice to him?

358
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,200
Am I?

359
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,000
Yes.

360
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,600
I treat everyone the same.

361
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,500
I thought since I was your only student,

362
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,500
you would be a little more attentive to me.

363
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,800
How's that the same?

364
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,000
You just said you treat everyone the same.

365
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,400
No,

366
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,500
I mean, I treat them all the same.

367
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,200
You're the first student I coach.

368
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,000
I'd pay more attention to you for sure.

369
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,800
That's more like it.

370
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,200
Happy now?

371
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,600
Yes.

372
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,500
Go on then.

373
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,200
Luo.

374
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,000
Do you know how high Mao Mao Qi jumped in training today?

375
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,400
Of course, I do.

376
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,900
I also know he did well on his gaokao.

377
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,000
He might get 300 points (enough for mid-tier entry).

378
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It's 2.14 m.

379
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,900
It's 2.14 m.

380
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:36,300
Duan Yu Cheng has got stuck on this height for over six months.

381
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,500
My point, Mao Mao Qi is training only a short time.

382
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,600
I think by summer break, if he is in good shape,

383
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,200
he can jump over 2.18 m.
[South Lake University]

384
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,400
Before the National University Games,

385
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,200
- if he can...
- Coach Gao.

386
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,200
Do you know Yang Jin?

387
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,500
"Yang Jin"?

388
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,600
Which Yang Jin?

389
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,000
The one from our sports school.

390
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,600
I know him.

391
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,700
Wasn't he semi-retired already six months ago?

392
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,500
He's now living a cozy life.

393
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,700
Yes.

394
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,600
He announced his retirement not long after

395
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,400
his student won third place in the national.

396
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,700
What's the matter? What's on your mind?

397
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,200
I was just thinking

398
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,500
if he would like to coach Duan Yu Cheng.

399
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,600
"Duan Yu Cheng"?

400
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,600
You want to...

401
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,300
Hang on,

402
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:32,300
I mean, even if Coach Yang Jin is willing to coach him, Duan Yu Cheng might not want it.

403
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:36,000
This boy wants to only practice high jump.

404
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,700
I know.

405
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,300
Even if there is only a slim chance, I still want to try.

406
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,300
I can't let him go further when it's a dead end.

407
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,400
That's true.

408
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,000
Morning, Coach.

409
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,500
Morning.

410
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,600
I'll go warm up first.

411
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,200
Come here for a second.

412
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,200
Come here.

413
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,900
Why didn't you tidy up your collar?

414
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,500
I thought you always cared about your image.

415
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,600
You mean you want me to look more like an athlete?

416
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,900
I have something to tell you.

417
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,500
I have a flight later this morning. I got a business trip.

418
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,000
"A business trip"?

419
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,400
Where are you going? Why are you going?

420
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,000
Who are you going with? When...

421
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,770
when are you returning?

422
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,200
What else is a business trip for?

423
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,400
For business, of course.

424
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,400
Suspend your morning training starting tomorrow.

425
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,600
Okay.

426
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,400
I'll go warm up first.

427
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,800
Go on.

428
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,800
Coach,

429
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,900
when you get back, I'll definitely jump over 2.14 m.

430
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,400
I can definitely beat Mao Mao Qi.

431
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,400
I believe in you.

432
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,800
You can do it.

433
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,300
Coach Yang?

434
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,900
Coach Yang?

435
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,800
Who are you?

436
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,300
It's me.

437
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,500
You seem familiar.

438
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,500
Don't you remember me?

439
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,300
I was on the sprint team.

440
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:28,100
During the Tibetan training, I stole your chicken.

441
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,000
Luo Na!

442
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,300
Are you here on vacation, too?

443
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,900
I'm here to see you.

444
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,300
Me?

445
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,300
Why do you want to see me?

446
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,400
There is this student of mine...

447
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,900
You trained here many times. Yet you still don't know the way to the field?

448
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,200
Coach Luo told me to follow you.

449
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,000
Senior.

450
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,900
Sweet!

451
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,200
Congrats, Old Duan.

452
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,300
You're not married yet, but you already have an adult son.

453
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,400
Thanks, Senior.

454
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,400
You like him? You can adopt him.

455
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,200
Come with me.

456
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,300
I don't want him.

457
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,700
Senior,

458
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,600
I'm sleepy.

459
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,600
Why don't we call it a day?

460
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,200
No.

461
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,700
Get up.

462
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,200
- Get up.
- What do you want?

463
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,500
Let's go to the high jump zone.

464
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,500
- Compete with me again.
- Again?

465
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,800
Hurry.

466
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,200
Get ready.

467
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,400
I'm really sleepy, Senior.

468
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,300
Get up. Now.

469
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,900
- Fine, I will get up, I will get up.
- Hurry.

470
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,600
I'm sorry, Senior.

471
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,100
Senior, why are you eating so little?

472
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,600
I'm not hungry. Don't mind me.

473
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,700
You practiced hard today.

474
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,900
How could you not be hungry?

475
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,100
Here you are.

476
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,600
Coach Luo is looking for you.

477
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,200
- Is she back?
- Yes.

478
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,420
Finish your food. Go see her after this.

479
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,800
I've finished.

480
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,000
What are you doing?

481
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,300
I want to see Coach Luo, too.

482
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,000
No. You don't want to.

483
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,400
Sit down.

484
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,500
Good Boy.

485
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,600
Don't take too long. We got a test later.

486
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,200
Bring my bag to the field for me.

487
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,200
He sure ran fast.

488
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:17,300
All right, stop looking. She asked for Duan Yu Cheng, not you.

489
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,900
Finish your food.

490
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,100
Senior didn't eat much.

491
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,700
Because he's in a bad mood lately.

492
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,200
I will finish his food.

493
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,000
Why?

494
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Are you really asking me why?

495
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,400
Let me ask, what do you think of Duan Yu Cheng?

496
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,400
He's nice.

497
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,900
"Nice"?

498
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,800
It's all just a facade.

499
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,800
Duan Yu Cheng may seem nice to you,

500
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,400
but he's actually very petty.

501
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,700
You'd better avoid him.

502
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:59,800
If you get too close to him, and you irritate him,

503
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,000
be careful he bites!

504
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
You are mean.

505
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,200
You badmouthed him behind his back.

506
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,940
With your EQ, even if you jump 8 m, what's the point?

507
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,400
Senior Duan gave that to me.

508
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,700

509
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,900
That's fast.

510

I just happened to finish my food.

511
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,400
When did you get back?

512
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,700
This morning.

513
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,500
Oh, right.

514
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,800
What is this?

515
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,800
A souvenir.

516
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,000
Didn't you grow up by the sea?

517
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,100
It looks like you.

518
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:16,000
It doesn't. It's ugly.

519
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,200
By the way,

520
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,200
how is Mao Mao Qi doing?

521
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,600
Is he settling into his new life and training?

522
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,800
He's doing okay.

523
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:32,200
Thank you for looking after him.

524
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,600
Coach,

525
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:42,100
this isn't a reward for taking care of him, right?

526
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,600
Well, I didn't give him any presents.

Nothing.

532

You've got the nerve to be late for the test.

533
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,000
Get back to your team.

534
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,400
Stay here and watch me.

535
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,900
Go now.

536
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,000
Where is my bag?

537
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,400
You weren't blind when I saw you just now.

538
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,600
Darn you.

539
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,000
You're quite cocky.

540
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,300
Will you jump without warming up first.

541
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,500
I already warmed up when I ran here.

542
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:33,300
Coach Gao, I will do 2.14 m today.

543
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,700
You got a lot of confidence today.

544
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,400
Sure. You will go first.

545
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,600
Okay.

546
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,600
He's just okay.

547
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:38,300
Don't tell me you regret going to Yang Jin after seeing him clear 2.14 m.

548
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,700
How did I do?

549
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:49,000
I told you when you got back, I could jump over 2.14 m.

550
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,100
You did great.

551
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,600
The 2.14 m is already very impressive.

552
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,400
You've never complimented me before.

553
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,700
Every time I jumped, you'd always point out my problems.

554
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:04,100
Why did you praise me for the first time today?

555
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,900
You are impossible to please.

556
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,300
Mao Mao Qi, 2.18 m.

557
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,700
You will go.

558
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,400
Oh, darn.

559

You did nothing wrong just now.

560
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,300
You just need to work on your muscle control.

561
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:54,200
No big deal, just practice a few times and you'll be fine.

562
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,800
- I'll practice with you now.
- No need.

563
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,200
Let me walk with you then.

564

I said, no need!

565
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,700
You've changed since Mao Mao Qi came here.

566
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,400
You would only praise me now.

567
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,000
Even if I don't jump as high or as well as he does,

568
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,200
you don't blame me anymore. Instead, you try to humor me.

569
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,500
But do you know it makes me feel worse when you do this?

570
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,100
Do you think I'll never be able to beat him?

571
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,300
No, it's not that.

572
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,200
Won't you persuade him again?

573
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,300
For a moment just now,

574
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,600
I thought he could make it.

575
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,400
But he really hit the wall now.

576
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,300
Hello?

Fill in the form.

About the test just now,

I shouldn't have left like that.
