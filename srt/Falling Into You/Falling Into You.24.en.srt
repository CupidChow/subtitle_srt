You all represent your university and your province

and were selected to be here as the new generation of talent

11

after many competitions for our country's glory.

12

You all develop your sharp skills and talent

Do not be scared. Do not worry.

15
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,940
But you must never forget

16
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,830
that the king will never give his position to you!

17
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:20,630
You must fight for the position yourself!

Let me introduce everyone.

Can't you keep up already after the first week?

I indeed can't.

31

It doesn't matter if I'm tired, as long as I don't die.

32
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:29,800
I just don't like how everyone seems to have springs in their legs.

I rank last, too.

36
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,560
But if we can get selected,

37
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,350
that means we're not much worse than others.

38
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,000
We just need to practice.

39
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,670
Of course.

40
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,130

Yes. It's over.

Of what?

141
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,580
You should have a fan club.

142

You are future prospects to fight for the country's glory.

Why are we shooting the commercial?

305
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,100
Because we want more people

to know about athletes like you

307

Understood?

311

But... but I heard they wanted Cai Li Qiu to do it.

312
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,600
Don't worry about that.

313

I think what Manager Guo said makes sense.

The coaches know what they're doing.

320

They won't let you shoot a commercial if it disrupts training.

321

Good, really good.

339
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,800
You can put it here.

340
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,000
Just like I told you yesterday.

341
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,600
This is the feeling you want.

342
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,400
Okay, be more determined.

343
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,700
Give me a tougher gaze.

344
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,300
Okay!

345
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,000
Don't worry.

346
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,400
We've booked a hotel for you all

347
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,000
and will send you back tomorrow morning.

348
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,700
"Hotel"?

349
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,100
We need to...

350
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,800
Stay here one night.

351
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,300
So you just need to focus on your shoot.

352
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,700
Okay, all athletes.

353
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,800
Stand a little closer together.

354
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,200
You can put your hands on each other's shoulders.

355
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,400
Hands on each other's shoulders.

356
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,500
Right!

357
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,200
Look at me.

358
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,700
Very good!

359
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,400
Our photo shoot today went very well.

360
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,500
- Okay.
- Oh, right.

361
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,800
The sponsor is hosting a dinner.

362
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,800
Do you really not want to go?

363
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,900
It's all right; I'm too tired to go.

364
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,000
Then rest well.

365
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,200
- Thank you.
- Bye bye.

366
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,900
What are you doing? Don't come close!

367
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,900
Why are you here? Did you miss me?

368
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,800
Put me down.

369
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,100
Did you miss me? You surely missed me.

370
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,000
Put me down; everyone's watching.

371
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,600
Hurry.

372
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I was just passing by.

373
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,700
I'm going now.

374
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,100
Stop that. Don't go.

375
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,600
Whether you missed me or not,

376
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,000
I missed you.

377
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,400
All right, let's not waste time.

378
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,700
Two hours are left until your bedtime.

379
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,900
Let's go.

380
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,000
What?

381
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,400
Go? To where?

382
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,500
Let's go.

383
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,300
To where?

384
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,700
Excuse me, so sorry.

385
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,500
Do you want to buy accessories?

386
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,600
Is this not tiring?

387
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,000
You're stopping me from eating.

388
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,300
No.

389
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,700
Lots of people are here.

390
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,000
What if you get lost?

391
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I'm eight years older than you, not eight years old.

392
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,900
I don't care.

393
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,000
Try this.

394
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,400
- I don't want any.
- It's really good.

395
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,300
Try it.

396
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,200
I can't eat it.

397
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,000
Just one bite. It's really, really good!

398
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,700
- I don't want any.
- Try it!

399
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,900
I don't want any. I really don't.

400
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,800
You're quite self-aware.

401
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,900
I can't.

402
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:54,600
My body fat can't exceed 9% before the competition.

403
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,200
You have a bright future, Young Man.

404
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,000
Of course.

405
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,800
Let's check this out.

406
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,500
Feel free to take a look.

407
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,300
These are new designs.

408
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,500
These are exclusive designs.

409
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,700
I want to choose one.

410
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,400
Two minutes,

411
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,600
give me back your hand in two minutes.

412
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,600
Okay.

413
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,800
Give me the fries; I'll hold them.

414
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,400
Which one is prettier?

415
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,600
They all look pretty on you.

416
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,800
This is an exclusive design.

417
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,300
You can't buy it elsewhere.

418
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,100
I'll take it.

419
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,500
Okay.

420
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,400
These are all from the internet.

421
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,700
She'll make half the price as profit.

422
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,000
But she said you can't buy it elsewhere.

423
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,600
Why are you so gullible?

424
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,800
How about I give you a discount of 30% off for two pairs?

425
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,200
We'll take them.

426
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,200
I'll take one of both pairs she tried on. Here's two hundred ($30) total.

427
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,600
- Does that work?
- Yes.

428
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,200
The payment went through.

429
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,100
Don't move.

430
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,500
Let me.

431
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,200
Give it to me.

432
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,600
Done.

433
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,600
Did it hurt?

434
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,000
Does it look good?

435
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,500
It's one of a kind; of course, it looks good.

436
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,400
Let's go.

437
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,700
Let's go.

438
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,700
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

439
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,200
You're welcome.

440
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,600
- Give it to me.
- No.

441
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,700
You need to stop eating.

442
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,600
The Diamond League high jump finals.

443
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,800
Impressive.

444
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,000
I know this athlete.

445
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,500
He just debuted last year

446
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,300
and is in the finals already.

447
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,200
He's so good.

448
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,500
Let's go.

449
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,600
Let's go.

450
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,000
Come on.

451
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,200
Good night.

452
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,000
Wh-What do you mean?

453
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,200
Aren't you coming up?

454
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,400
I can't go up.

455
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,500
What do you mean?

456
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,600
You came all the way here. Let's go.

457
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,800
I can't; I mean it.

458
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,800
You're being naughty. Come here.

459
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,000
- Listen to me.
- You can if I say so.

460
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,800
- Be good now!
- I don't want to.

461
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,900
Just go to sleep.

462
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,700
All right, be good now.

463
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,000
But why?

464
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,200
You came all the way here. Why aren't you coming up?

465
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,600
When the other athletes are back, your manager will check your rooms.

466
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,900
You'll get caught if you don't go back now.

467
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,900
Then...

468
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:30,200
Can you have breakfast with me tomorrow?

469
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,600
I'm taking a 6 a.m. flight back.

470
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,600
It's almost time for sports day.

471
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,200
I sneaked out today.

472
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,000
Fine then.

473
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,200
Take care of yourself.

474
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,800
Be good and go to sleep soon.

475
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,100
I'm leaving.

476
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,200
Bye bye.

477
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,000
Wait.

478
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,400
I'll see you off,

479
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,500
even if you're leaving.

480
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,600
Tell me the truth.

481
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,100
Did you come since you worried about me?

482
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,400
Why else?

483
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,000
You sounded like you were dying without oxygen on the phone.

484
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,200
Who's about to die?

485
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,100
I'm not about to die; I'm perfectly fine.

486
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,200
So were you putting on an act for me?

487
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,200
No, of course not.

488
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,200
I-I wasn't pretending,

489
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,500
I really was about to die.

490
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,900
How are your preparations going?

491
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,100
Not bad.

492
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,700
Did the coaching staff set your target results?

493
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,400
The coaching staff

494
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,200
does not have high requirements for us.

495
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,500
But because

496
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,500
both Cai Li Qiu and I have good results this year,

497
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:52,200
the higher-ups hope we can win gold,

498
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,100
especially me.

499
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,200
Then you must work hard.

500
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,100
Don't let anything distract you.

501
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,800
Got it?

502
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:10,500
Two weeks are left until Asian Athletics Championships.

503
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,700
I'll be watching you on TV.

504
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,800
No matter where you are,

505
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,200
I will always cheer you on.

[Duan Yu Cheng: Asian Athletics Championships 2017]

510
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,500
Miss over there.

511
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,900
I have a question for Duan Yu Cheng.

512
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,000
Hello, Duan Yu Cheng.

513
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,300
I'd like to ask whether or not

514
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,600
your growing popularity online lately

515
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,600
has affected your life or training?

516
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,200
It has not.

517
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,400
But I heard

518
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,300
that you shot 3-4 commercials within one week.

519
00:27:56,300 --> 00:28:00,000
Wouldn't the shooting conflict with your training?

520
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,700
For the commercials...

521
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,800
I'm sorry for interrupting.

522
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,600
We allocate every athlete's time for training properly.

523
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,600
It won't affect...

524
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,600
But as a new athlete,

525
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,400
not only do you have a chance to sit

526
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,200
with such accomplished seniors for a press conference,

527
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,000
but you are much more popular than them.

528
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
How does that make you feel?

529
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,100
I am very honored

530
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,000
to be at this press conference with my seniors.

531
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,400
I will do my best in this competition

532
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,400
to achieve good results.

533
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,000
Thank you.

534
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,400
Are there any other questions?

535
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:02,800
- I have questions!
- I have questions!

536
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,500
Don't be anxious.

537
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,200
All will have a chance.

538
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,200
Please wait for your turn.

539
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,100
All will have a chance.

540
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,000
Please go ahead.

541
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,400
Duan Yu Cheng.

542
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,000
There is a lot of time left.

543
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,200
Why don't we have another talk?

544
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,700
About what?

545
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:43,700
You actually do like shooting commercials, right?

546
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:47,300
Did you turn down the agency I recommended

547
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:50,000
due to your female coach?

548
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,100
It doesn't have anything to do with her.

549
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,600
Oh, really?

550
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,100
Your female coach, Luo Na,

551
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:04,200
isn't just your coach,

552
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,800
but also your girlfriend, right?

553
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,700
Her father is Luo Shou Min,

554
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,600
a famous track and field coach back in the day.

555
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:18,900
He left to study abroad but didn't return.

556
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,600
He wanted to take his daughter, a sprinter,

557
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,700
to train abroad.

558
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:26,400
But Luo Na didn't want to.

559
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,200
After she retired,

560
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,100
she entered a Master's program at South Lake University

561
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,800
and wanted to become a coach.

562
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,000
You were the first athlete she coached.

563
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,900
She started dating her first athlete.

564
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,300
She's quite in a rush.

565
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,800
She's not young anymore, right?

566
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,600
Is she 8 years older than you?

567
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,700
Let me tell you,

568
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:54,200
none of this has to do with you.

569
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,200
Got it?

570
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,300
Right, it has nothing to do with me.

571
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,800
But you should think carefully.

572
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,700
What she did

573
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,600
might not have been best for you.

574
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,600
I heard that back then,

575
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:08,400
her father was very against athletes doing advertising.

576
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,800
But times are different now.

577
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,200
Maybe she did this

578
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,200
as she was afraid her father would be against it.

579
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,000
Or maybe

580
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,400
she's scared you won't like her anymore if you become famous.

581
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,400
Listen to me.

582
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,600
I know women better than you do.

583
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,200
Let go of me.

584
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,200
Don't let her selfishness...

585
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,600
- Let go of me.
- ruin your future!

586

- Let go.

588

Let go!

589
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,400

00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,100
Yes.

593

In private, does he treat you seniors like that as well?

594

The article said

602
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,700
that he used under-the-table means

Don't get too worried.

So did he tell the reporter about this?

661
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,000
He couldn't make up all the story.

662
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,300
He just didn't deny

663
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,800
anything the reporter asked.

664
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,200
I am responsible for this, too.

665
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,500
You made improvements too fast

666
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,700
and the pressure on him grew.

667
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,900
I didn't expect he couldn't cope with it.

668
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,100
Let me have a competition with him.

669
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,200
What do you mean?

670
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,600
One day,

671
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,000
all ten events.

672
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,600
Whoever has the highest score competes.

673
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,200
I can prove that I can do it!

674
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,100
Yu Cheng, this is not about if you can do it.

675
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,600
We all know you can do it.

676
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,400
Then what is the problem?

677
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,600
Isn’t the competition all about strength?

678
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,300
I can't compete

679
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,500
due to a few nonsense articles?

- Yu Cheng!
- Why can't I?

681
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,300
I know how you're feeling.

682
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,200
I know you're very angry.

683
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,600
And it is very unfair to you.

684
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,800
But this can be a very bad influence.

685
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,500
Give it some time, okay?

686
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:33,200
You still have many more chances.

687
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,200
I promise you.

688
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,600
We will talk to Cai Li Qiu and clear things up

689
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,400
as soon as the competition is over.
