"but you're not tall enough."

93

as a hobby just for fun,

00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,100

You might think I don't care,

but when I hear people calling me "Shorty,"

106

00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,720
Yes!

333
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,760
You...

334
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,579
What are you trying to do?

335
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,650
If something bothers you, just tell me.

336
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:44,300
No, no. Nothing bothers me, Sir.

337
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,930
I'm happy with everything, Sir.

338
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:48,059
If nothing bothers you,

339
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:50,609
focus on your writing with a calm mind then.

340
00:27:50,609 --> 00:27:53,030
Don't disturb others.

341
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,609
Hello, Coach Luo.

342
00:28:01,609 --> 00:28:03,910
I'm treating friends to a crayfish meal today

343
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:06,280
to celebrate my acceptance to the team. Will you join us?

344
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,619
You guys have fun. I will pass.

345
00:28:08,619 --> 00:28:10,370
Why? Why aren't you joining?

346
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:12,960
I'm having dinner with Coach Wu in the cafeteria.

347
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,010
All right. I have to go. Bye bye.

348
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,300
- Was it Duan Yu Cheng again?
- Yes.

349
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:27,330
I specially bought you a cup of three-fruit-flavored tea.

350
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:30,580
It's the same as the mixed fruit tea freshly made in-store.

351
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:34,030
Don't drink other unhealthy beverages.

352
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,990
Thanks.

353
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,810
Duan Yu Cheng already got what he wants.

354
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:45,570
Why is he still pestering you?

355
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:48,040
It's like he's pursuing you.

356
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,990
Well, it does feel like it.

357
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:53,520
It's been a long time

358
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,200
since someone waited for me downstairs all night.

359
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,610
Looks like I'm attractive to students, too.

360
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:02,429
Don't mind me talking over you.

361
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:06,059
I can see he cares a lot about you.

362
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,429
Well, of course.

363
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:09,920
I'm his only master.

364
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,749
He finally made it to the varsity team.

365
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:21,610
If he could participate in a major competition, he'd surely go further.

366
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:22,679
"A major competition"?

367
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:24,640
Do you want him in a major competition, despite just joining?

368
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,229
What will other people think of him?

369
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:28,810
I don't care what others think.

370
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:31,579
The point is my student is your student too.

371
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:33,180
Though he's not in the same sport,

372
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:36,580
sprinting can benefit his high jump.

373
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,780
You need to give him more pointers.

374
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:44,829
You are still trying to drag me into this with you.

375
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:48,909
Don't worry; if you help him,

376
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:52,140
I'll have Duan Yu Cheng take good care of you in the future.

377
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:03,100
- I want a cold one.
- Isn't Ms. Luo coming?

378
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:06,880
She's not coming. She has plans, but she told us to have fun.

379
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,190
Why aren't you eating?

380
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,030
It's fine. The university provincial games are coming soon.

381
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:20,330
I have to maintain my body fat percentage.

382
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:21,509
You guys eat.

383
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:23,819
Just have one. Just one won't affect your weight.

384
00:30:23,819 --> 00:30:25,440
No, no. I really don't want to eat.

385
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,479
If my competition results are affected due to my indulgence,

386
00:30:28,479 --> 00:30:30,530
Coach Luo will kill me.

387
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:31,760
Is Ms. Luo that strict?

388
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,140
That's right. She can't be that strict.

389
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:36,060
She seemed very nice in class.

390
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,670
Exactly.

391
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:40,580
Oh, I know, Coach Luo

392
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:45,749
certainly treats Duan Yu Cheng differently than she does us.

393
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:59,570
Duan Yu Cheng, I have to hand it to you.

394
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:02,669
I wondered how you improved so fast in your training.

395
00:31:02,669 --> 00:31:06,280
It turns out Coach Luo took special care of you. Good.

396
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,960
You are really mischievous as always.

397
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,919
"Mischievous"? Is it a mistake to train hard?

398
00:31:12,919 --> 00:31:16,070
No, of course not.

399
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:19,240
There is no mistake in training hard, right?

400
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:23,780
Okay, then you guys have fun. I will go.

401
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:29,810
Is he your teammate?

402
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:32,720
Eat up.

403
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:45,760
Oh, darn.

404
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:48,910
One, two, one.

405
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:50,700
- What is this?
- One, two, one.

406
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,080
Stop talking. Come and chase me.

407
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:55,890
Duan Yu Cheng!

408
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:02,329
You've just recovered a little. How dare you not warm up before going on the track?

409
00:32:02,329 --> 00:32:04,439
No, Coach. I...

410
00:32:04,439 --> 00:32:07,170
I was just going to warm up a little here.

411
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:08,310
Coach Luo.

412
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,670
What are you doing here?

413
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:12,500
You see, Duan Yu Cheng said he's feeling bored training alone.

414
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,939
He wanted me to train with him.

415
00:32:13,939 --> 00:32:15,000
I'm joining morning training from now on.

416
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,610
Darn it. I didn't invite you.

417
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:18,360
All right. Come with me to get the equipment.

418
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,830
Okay.

419
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,850
Shut up, you despicable guy.

420
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:27,950
Wait up, Coach!

421
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,210
Your muscle strength is very good.

422
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:42,490
But try to find your strength point precisely.

423
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:44,660
- Okay.
- Try this.

424
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,260
You guys keep training. I'm leaving.

425
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:06,479
Practice two more sets. I'll be right back.

426
00:33:06,479 --> 00:33:08,410
Okay, Coach.

427
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,510
Duan Yu Cheng.

428
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,560
Let's talk.

429
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,590
Are you in a bad mood?

430
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,930
Why are you upset?

431
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:44,800
Coach,

432
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:48,790
in your mind,

433
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:52,650
am I the same as Liu Shan?

434
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:56,210
Yes. You are both students of the varsity team.

435
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:59,930
And you are my juniors too. What's wrong?

436
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,800
What about Coach Wu?

437
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,309
Is he the same as us?

438
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:07,509
Why do you keep mentioning Coach Wu?

439
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,830
Do you care so much about him?

440
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:11,700
Not him, I care about you.

441
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,770
Okay, okay. I care about you, too.

442
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:20,560
You are my first student.

443
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:25,670
No, you are my first-ever student. Okay?

444
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,470
Look up.

445
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,770
Look at me.

446
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:46,680
Are you upset because Liu Shan made fun of you?

447
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,770
I'm an athlete.

448
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:03,930
I should focus on my training.

449
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:07,099
Don't worry, Coach. I will train well.

450
00:35:07,099 --> 00:35:09,769
Are you okay? Have you been possessed?

451
00:35:09,769 --> 00:35:12,970
No, I just figured it out.

452
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:16,550
I will adjust my state of mind. Don't worry.

453
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:22,779
Okay. Your foot has almost recovered these days.

454
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:25,840
Get ready to report to the varsity team.

455
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,350
All right.

456
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,690
Hi, Senior.

457
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:37,370
I'm Duan Yu Cheng. I'm a new high jump team member.

458
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:38,830
I bought you guys some milk tea.

459
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:40,630
Here you go.

460
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:42,260
It's what I should do.

461
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:44,160
Please look after me.

462
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,379
Are you satisfied now?

463
00:35:46,379 --> 00:35:48,680
- He's finally here.
- Thank you.

464
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,850
- Are you happy now?
- Hi, Seniors.

465
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:52,520
I'm Duan Yu Cheng. I'm a new high jump team member.

466
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,870
When he gets better, I will ask him to run for you again.

467
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:58,330
Give him some pointers.

468
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:00,860
Does he run fast?

469
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,400
He's quite fast.

470
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,490
Hi, Seniors.

471
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:09,239
Sure. He can give sprinting a try. See if he can switch sports.

472
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:12,200
He can't go far in high jump.

473
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,390
You're poaching my student so blatantly.

474
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:15,619
That's not cool.

475
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:19,689
Even Jiang Tian's conditions couldn't meet the national team standard.

476
00:36:19,689 --> 00:36:23,700
As for your first student, it's doubtful.

477
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:31,309
Hi, Seniors. I'm Duan Yu Cheng.

478
00:36:31,309 --> 00:36:33,120
I'm a new high jump team member. I'm a freshman.

479
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,649
I bought you guys some milk tea. Is this okay?

480
00:36:35,649 --> 00:36:38,560
- Yes, yes.
- Please look after me, Senior.

481
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:42,659
Sorry about that.

482
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:45,890
We are accustomed to pushing each other around here.

483
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:47,259
We're from the shot put team.

484
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:49,429
I'm Dai Yu Xia. You can just call me Big Xia.
[Big Xia]

485
00:36:49,429 --> 00:36:51,569
Hi, Seniors. I'm Duan Yu Cheng.

486
00:36:51,569 --> 00:36:53,150
Hi, Sister Xia.

487
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:55,150
Here's some chocolate.

488
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:57,770
If you get tired later, you can have some to replenish your energy.

489
00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:00,720
Good luck with your trial later.

490
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,139
This is Sister Xia's welcome gift for joining the team.

491
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,400
Thank her now.

492
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,190
Thank you, Sister Xia. It's a pleasure meeting you.

493
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:10,310
Don't mention it. It's a pleasure meeting you.

494
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,650
Are you okay?

495
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:15,430
Yes, I'm fine.

496
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:20,810
I have some milk tea here.

497
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:23,630
Don't you have to win the competition to join the team?

498
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:27,179
If you can join no matter what, why bother going through the formality?

499
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:32,400
- Here's the straw, Senior.
- Thank you.

500
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,400
Director.

501
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,520
- Director.
- Listen,

502
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,600
this trial is to ensure fairness

503
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,000
and to test their training results.

504
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,179
The university provincial games give us only two spots for high jump.

505
00:37:43,179 --> 00:37:44,540
But don't stress yourself out,

506
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,420
all right? This is fair and impartial.

507
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:48,170
Whoever wins can go.

508
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:50,120
Okay.

509
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:05,930
Jiang Tian has cleared the mark of 2.15 m.

510
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,620
Who's next?

511
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:14,940
Only Liu Shan and Duan Yu Cheng are left.

512
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:26,819
Liu Shan cleared 2.05 m.

513
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,070
[High Jump Results Checklist: Liu Shan, Duan Yu Cheng]

514
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:47,230
Duan Yu Cheng cleared 2.05 m.

515
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:49,370
The results are very close.

516
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:52,740
Duan Yu Cheng is not bad at all.

517
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:58,270
Raise the bar to 2.1 m.

518
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:01,969
Set to 2.1 m. Liu Shan, get ready.

519
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,910
Liu Shan failed.

520
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:27,770
Duan Yu Cheng failed.

521

524
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,610
Next attempt. Duan Yu Cheng, get ready.

525
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:51,379
This is your last chance, too. You might not make it.

526
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,640
At least the chance is still in my hands.
