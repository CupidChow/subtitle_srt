Luo Na stormed into the organizing committee's office.

155

She filed a real-name report that Zhang Hong Wen used drugs.

156
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,600
Do you know what real-name whistleblowing means?

157

If the test did not find any drugs,

158
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,800
Luo Na would have to bear all consequences.

159

But you don't need to worry about her.

Does she still want me to continue training?

167

she will fight for you.

171
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,600
Why are you here?

172
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,800
I have something to tell you.

173
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,400
We'll talk outside.

174
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,200
I heard my result was changed.

175
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,200
Yes.

176
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,800
You deserved it.

177
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,300
Congratulations.

178
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,200
Your academic advisor came to see me today.

179
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,800
He said your grades were not very good this semester.

180
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,400
The final exam is around the corner.

181
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,300
He's worried about you.

182
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,400
He'd like you to stop training.

183
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,700
He said the training

184
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,200
is seriously affecting your general subjects' grades.

185
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,100
If you go on like this,

186
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,200
you might not be able to graduate.

187
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,800
What do you think?

188
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,500
Duan Yu Cheng, I'm asking you a question.

189
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,900
Duan Yu Cheng.

190
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Do you still want me to train?

191
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,500
Actually, I never

192
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,200
imagined how you'd be without sports.

193
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,400
I think you were born to be in the stadium.

194
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,400
But what I saw two days ago,

195
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,800
when you left the stadium

196
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,000
to be with your friends,

197
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,100
I thought it was good too.

198
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,800
So what?

199
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,200
I think the coaching team needs to self-reflect.

200
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,000
We shouldn't be so stubborn

201
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,100
on asking you to switch specialty.

202
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,200
My dad once told me something.

203
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,700
He said,

204
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,800
in track and field,

205
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,000
99 out of 100 athletes quit.

206
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,800
And the last one goes to compete.

207
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
But it doesn't mean that the 99 were failures.

208
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,500
Everyone is just finding his own path.

209
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,800
A person like you

210
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,000
will stand out, no matter where you are.

211
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,300
Do you really think so?

212
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,400
Loosen up a little.

213
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,000
Stepping away after getting a gold medal

214
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,400
is also a good ending to the chapter.

215
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,400
Go back now.

216
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,800
What are you doing, Duan Yu Cheng?

217
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,200
Is that really what you think?

218
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,000
Think of what?

219
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,500
I'm asking if that's what you really want!

220
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,300
Are you really letting me go?

221
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,600
Look at me!

222
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,400
Duan Yu Cheng!

223
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,500
I'm telling you to go or not.

224
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,500
Your life is your own.

225
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,500
I'm just a coach. What I say doesn't matter!

226
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,300
I've always believed an athlete has to do his best.

227
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,200
But there's a limit to it!

228
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,400
If you think the hardships brought on by sports

229
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,800
are more than the joy, then quit!

230
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,500
But I never said I was suffering!

231
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,900
You didn't suffer, you say?

232
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,400
Did you not suffer when you lost to Zhang Hong Wen?

233
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,200
Were you not upset when Mao Mao Qi competed?

234
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:22,000
Look at yourself in the mirror, at your expression right now.

235
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,600
Are you disappointed in me?

236
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I'm not.

237
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,500
Why won't you just tell me the truth?

238
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,100
I'm not disappointed!

239
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,500
I just think...

240
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,800
You're no longer as dazzling as when I first met you.

241
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,700
But I really don't know what else I can do for you!

242
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,200
I don't know what I can do to make your future better!

Drink slowly.

248
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,400
That's enough already. Stop drinking.

249
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,300
You can't hold your liquor.

250

That's past your limit.

251

♫ When you're grown and I've lost my head ♫

341
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:21,250
I'm not angry because you wouldn't switch specialties.

342
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:25,520
When did I force you to do something you didn't like?

343
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,050
I'm angry because you gave up.

344
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:32,230
You gave up when someone jumped higher than you.

345
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:34,920
You gave up when you lost a competition.

346
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,510
You stopped training. You didn't contact me.

347
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:39,050
You wouldn't tell me what was bothering you.

But I really tried my best.

351
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:55,230
I'm just afraid of losing.

352
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:01,990

363

will you forgive me?

364
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,920
Get up first. People are looking.

♫ Just might be; how perfect ♫

374
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:59,410

375
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:03,030
The thing... The comment you said just then.

376
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:05,460
What comment?

377
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:09,530
When you said something about dazzling the first time.

378
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:13,150
What dazzling? Did I say that?

379
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,000
Are you a goldfish?

380
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,320
Does your memory only last for seven seconds?

381
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,000
How could you say that and then

382
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
not remember?

383
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:30,850
All right, I got it. Come, stand up.

384
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,200
You're a drunk mess.

385
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,860
I doubt you're thinking straight.

386
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,950
I won't argue with you.

387
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:57,230
There are clean clothes by the door. Change now.

388
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,750
He's going to catch a cold.

389
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:15,520
- Hello?
- Hello, Ms. Luo.

390
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,060
Duan Yu Cheng...

391
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,520
He jumped off a bridge.

392
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,960
I think he's gone.

393
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,570
The police haven't been able to find him in the water.

394
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:23,310
Duan Yu Cheng is with me.

395
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:25,390
Are the police involved?

396
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:28,460
I'll head over right away.

397
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,000
Leave him be.

398
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,750
Come on.

399
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:16,470
Did he really swim back by himself?

400
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:19,870
That's a few hundred meters. And he was even drunk.

401
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:22,160
Athletes are all lunatics.

402
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:25,020
He should quit high jump and join triathlon instead.

403
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,560
Good idea.

404
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:30,450
- Ms. Luo, will you let him sleep here?
- Yes

405
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:33,050
Where will you sleep then? We could carry him back.

406
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:34,300
That's okay.

407
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,020
I'll sleep on the couch.

408
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,320
It's been a rough night for all of you. Go back and rest.

409
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,840
Then... We'll leave him to you. We'll go now.

410
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,370
- Okay.
- Thanks, Ms. Luo.

411
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:43,460
We're off then.

412
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,430
- Goodbye.
- Bye bye.

413
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,460
- Glad he's okay.
- I can't believe it. He jumped into a river?

414
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:53,130
- Jump into the river.
- Goodness me.

Get up and drink the medicine first.

418
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:12,090
Here.

419
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,850
Sleep after you drink it.

420
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,220
Drink it.

421
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,610
Slowly.

422
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:32,740
Good night, Coach.

423
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:36,990
You sure made yourself comfortable.

424
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:39,300
