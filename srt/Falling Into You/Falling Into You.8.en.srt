Not bad.

We are so good.

169
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,840
Coach, it's actually not that hard.

170
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,910
You just need to remember to press that.

171

B eight two.

172
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,410

173

Then they can't kill you.

174

It's okay. This is your first time.

176

Can this be the last time?

179
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,858
I can't run anymore.

180
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,200
I was the one who took them out.

181
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,650
I am the lead.

182
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:21,550
When you play a game, you can't think of anything else.

183
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,794
It is not like we ignored messages and calls on purpose.

184
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:28,080
- No—
- Mr. Wang, it was me,

185
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,510
not Coach Wu.

186
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,910
I brought everyone to the internet café to relax.

187

You don't have to be the scapegoat. Step back!

188
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:44,762
Is this a group of stand-up routine?

189
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:52,120
Two coaches taking a group of students to play games at the internet café!

190
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,480
You are disorganized, and undisciplined!

191
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:58,408
If people find out about this, they will think that I am dead!

192
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,600
If they think that way,

193
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,900
it means they are cursing you.

194
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,080
Who said that?

195
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,320
I will teach them a lesson.

196
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,020
- Sir.
- We... Trust me.

197

It wasn't our coaches' fault.

198
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:12,630
I never thought we would have extra training today.

199
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,820
I won't do it again!

200
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,120
Why do you keep cutting me off?

201

Shut up!

Why did you bring them to the internet café during the day?

What is wrong with you?

You just wanted to help Duan Yu Cheng relax, right?

219

Let me tell you.

220
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,550
Wang has already asked me.

221
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:12,138
He asked if I'm willing to take him into the sprint team.

222
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:17,184
Looks like Wang has really made up his mind.

223
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:22,380
He just wants him to transfer to another event, not leave the team.

224
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,540
Wang is just doing it for his own good.

225
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,880
He has advantages in sprinting.

226
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,000
Cai Yuan even gave him her name card before.

227
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,310
She tried to poach him in front of me.

228
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:34,670
Forget about Cai Yuan.

229

She even tried to poach Zhang Hong Wen.

No, what is the meaning of this?

Are you saying that Cai Yuan is better than me?

232
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,414
I didn't say that.

233

If you can't talk to him about it, I can talk to him.

When it comes to men, we are not that complicated.

Don't tell him that.

Don't say anything to him before I bring it up.

You are so protective of him.

You don't have to be so serious about it.

I am being serious here.

500
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:36,720
- Based on Mr. Wang's opinion—
- Mr. Wang's opinion is unimportant.

501
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,892
Your opinion is important.

502
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,212
Do you want me to transfer?

503
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:46,980
Transferring to another event is very common in track and field.

504
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,704
- Besides, sprint—
- Do you want me to transfer?

505
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:54,260
I'm saying something serious.

506
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,680
Why do you keep cutting me off?

507
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:01,390
I know what the team thinks.

508
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,570
They think high jump isn't for me.

509
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:07,270
They want me to transfer to sprinting and train under Coach Wu, right?

510
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,072
But I want to know what you think.

511
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:27,910
Do you know when I started training for high jump?

512
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,510
At the age of eight;

513
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:33,078
it has been more than a decade now.

514
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:38,460
Before, I told you I didn't have any specific reason to love high jump.

515
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,820
Do you still remember?

516
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,520
I do.

517
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,840
But actually, I have a reason.

518
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,510
I was too shy to tell you, though.

519
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:55,090
What is it?

520
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:56,730
I wanted to grow taller.

521
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:10,990
When I was young, my parents were very busy.

522
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:14,870
When they went out to work, they would leave me behind on an island like that.

523
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,940
I would play on the island by myself.

524
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:19,380
There weren't many people there.

525
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:22,890
The people there were either old or very young.

526
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:28,814
When I was feeling too energetic back then, I would run up the hill.

527
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,540
I wanted to play basketball.

528
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,540
I wanted to play football too.

529
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,524
But I didn't have anyone my age to play with,

530
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:44,630
and I was really short back then.

531
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:47,280
So I always thought about getting taller.

532
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,730
After that, my family bought a television,

533
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:52,860
and I started to watch sport events.

534
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:58,684
I found out that those high-jump athletes were all very tall.

535
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,996
So I made up my mind

536
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:06,220
to train for high jump, too.

537
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,380
Those athletes were chosen for the high jump

538
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,540
because they are naturally tall.

539
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:15,331
I know. Of course, I know that now,

540
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,840
but I was foolish and naive.

541
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,800
As I continued to train for it,

542
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:24,242
I suddenly realized

543
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:28,240
that I had fallen in love with high jump.

544
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:39,600
My childhood consists of that island and high jump.

545
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,140
It accompanied me for so long.

546
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:46,570
But now, you are asking me

547
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:48,574
to give up on it.

548
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:08,920
I don't mind if others don't believe in me,

549
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:14,770
but I hope you can believe in me.

550
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,540
All right, do your best.

551
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,640
I will deal with other issues.

552
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:47,090
Are you saying that I can stay?

553
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:35,250
Who do you think I am?

554
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:37,360
Bribery won't work on me.

555
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,420
Those are just books.

556
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,940
They have nothing to do with Duan Yu Cheng.

557
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,684
You are so easily swayed.

558
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,730
It's good you are here.

559
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:56,686
Let me show you what real talent looks like.

Let's go and meet him tomorrow.

564
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,924
Am I going, too?

565
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:10,810
Of course, you have to drive.

566
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:13,180
His house is quite far away from here.

567
