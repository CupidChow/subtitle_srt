00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:18,150
When you were anxious,

195
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:19,430
you would always watch

196
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:20,900
fluffy pet videos.

197
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:21,790
I thought

198
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,110
you kept this habit.

199
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,870
You looked at my Weibo.

200
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,390
What's bothering you?

201
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,650
The bidding tomorrow?

202
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,000
We have made sufficient preperation.

203
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,310
Mr. Xiao, don't worry.

204
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:41,550
Tell me about it.

205
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,230
No.

206
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,070
What?

207
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,990
Are you afraid I'll plagiarize?

208
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:48,390
I'm afraid you might become prejudiced.

209
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:49,910
It's not fair.

210
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,310
Fine.

211
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,440
Let's have dinner together.

212
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,140
I just had a sandwich.

213
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:08,270
By the way,

214
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:12,670
did Peter get beaten when he went back that back.

215
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:16,210
He's thick-skinned. It doesn't hurt when he's beaten.

216
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,910
I know a good traditional Chinese medicine doctor

217
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:23,150
who specializes in pediatrics.

218
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,760
I can recommend them to Ms. Tong.

219
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,590
I'll tell her about this.

220
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,190
Peter's father...

221
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,470
I'm not trying to gossip.

222
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,870
I just think

223
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:40,710
it's not easy for Ms. Tong

224
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,400
to take care of the child alone.

225
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,110
Yes.

226
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,130
Peter was just one year old

227
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,310
when they broke up.

228
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,030
It's really hard for her.

229
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,250
When one is with the wrong person,

230
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,990
they will only torture each other.

231
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:03,390
But if they are the right person,

232
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,130
no matter how long they are apart,

233
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,590
they will still meet again.

234
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,590
Well,

235
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,910
I'll leave if there's nothing else.

236
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:46,910
What's wrong?

237
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:51,520
It's the same illness again, isn't it?

238
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:55,990
Relax.

239
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,110
You're stiff as a fossil.

240
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:00,830
It's okay.

241
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:01,910
I'm fine.

242
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,160
Forget it.

243
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,750
I'll take you somewhere.

244
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:15,270
No need.

245
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,310
Aerial yoga

246
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,670
has almost zero pressure on your spine.

247
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,440
So it's very effective.

248
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,870
Relax.

249
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:39,890
Don't be stiff.

250
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,030
Relax.

251
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,030
Yes.

252
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,670
Try to relax.

253
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,270
Yes.

254
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:47,590
Good.

255
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,710
You must balance your strength.

256
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:54,830
Good.

257
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,260
Your hand.

258
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,910
Relax your wrist.

259
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,790
Yes, relax yourself.

260
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,480
Yes, very good.

261
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,190
Slowly.

262
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:16,750
Good.

263
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,230
When did you learn this?

264
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,349
When I was in America,

265
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:27,810
I learned this for a while.

266
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,810
What are you doing?

267
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,070
I was just imagining

268
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,530
how you'd look doing this.

269
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,560
You'd probably look really funny.

270
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:45,210
I'm doing this for your good and this is how you repay me?

271
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,390
How petty.

272
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:52,230
When I first went to America,

273
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,390
I had insomnia.

274
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:59,110
I couldn't sleep at night.

275
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,570
While walking on the road,

276
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,390
I suddenly saw an advertisement

277
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,750
for a yoga studio.

278
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,310
So I thought, why not?

279
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,790
All right, stop thinking about it.

00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:13,720

00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:16,190
have multi-language capability, and a guaranteed quality.

385
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:18,030
Our service philosophy is

386
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:21,390
we always prioritize trust and deliver what we promise

387
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,110
with the best quality.

388
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,510
So we believe that

389
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,040
in the future development,

390
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,990
Jitianyu is able to bring Yuyi

391
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,310
[Expansive resources] [Service philosophy]

392
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:30,190
even stronger technical support.

393
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,670
That's all. Thank you.

394
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:46,560
Thank you Jieyin, for your presentation.

395
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:47,700
Let's welcome

396
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,470
Yongyun's team to present.

397
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,310
Hello, everyone.

398
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,110
Yuyi is

399
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:03,110
at the top of machine translation in China.

400
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:03,710
So,

401
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,620
the relationship we would like to have with Yuyi,

402
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,930
more than client and service provider,

403
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:08,790
we would like to be moving forward with you.

404
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:09,470
Therefore,

405
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,590
we are also willing

406
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,350
to support Yuyi's

407
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,550
future development.

408
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:15,510
Therefore, this is

409
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,750
the price Yongyun is offering.

410
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:17,810
[Zero]

411
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,070
Xi, how can they do this?

412
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,110
This is against

413
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,820
the bidding law.

414
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,670
According to the Bidding Law,

415
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:30,200
Article 33,

416
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:31,750
the bidder cannot bid with a price

417
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,150
lower than

418
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:34,110
the cost.

419
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,030
So,

420
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,710
the concept of our zero is

421
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,260
if Yongyun wins the bid,

422
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,550
we will donate

423
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:43,930
all our profits

424
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,130
to college students who are doing technology start ups

425
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:47,610
as a start up fund.

426
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,710
I also hope that China

427
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:52,190
can have more entrepreneurs who are

428
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:54,590
young and promising like Mr. Xiao.

429
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,110
Xi.

430
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,590
Their fluff

431
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:02,270
is too amazing.

432
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:02,910
Will we...

433
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:03,970
Let's wait and see.

434
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,790
I look forward to

435
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:07,330
becoming partner with Yuyi.

436
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:08,590
Let's work together

437
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:09,670
to promote

438
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:11,510
translation business in China.

439
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:28,290
[Yuyi Technology Limited]

440
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:28,080
Now let's welcome Huasheng Group to prosent.

441
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,970
[Our project quote: One million yuan]

442
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:01,510
So high?

443
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,310
One million.

444
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,190
It's so high.

445
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:09,900
Lin Xi is digging her own grave.

446
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,110
The quotation is so high.

447
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:11,910
A company

448
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:13,230
in their initial stages like Yuyi

449
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:15,630
won't choose a company that offers a high price.

450
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:16,870
Looks like we'll win.

451
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:18,150
As you can see,

452
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,750
this is Huasheng's offer.

453
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:20,920
Director Lin,

454
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:23,510
are you going to change the price right now?

455
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:26,310
If possible,

456
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,910
I do want to change the price,

457
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,590
and increase it by five percent.

458
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,670
The price is a sieve.

459
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,750
In the market's environment,

460
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,160
high price

461
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:44,270
can help select products of better quality

462
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:46,190
among the many products,

463
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:47,310
providing us with

464
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,030
a simpler dimension

465
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,760
to consider this product from.

466
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:52,590
So,

467
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:53,950
I have to admit to

468
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,430
Huasheng's shortcomings.

469
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,630
We're very expensive

470
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,300
and we don't accept bargains.

471
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,640
This is the translation network

472
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,430
and elite translators

473
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,150
built up by Huasheng's branches

474
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:09,210
all over the world.

475
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:11,270
They can be used by Yuyi at any time.

476
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:12,830
Besides,

477
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,070
Cheng Yao,

478
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:19,520
a special interpreter of Huasheng

479
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:21,960
is fluent in various minority languages.

480
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:31,400
Director Lin.

481
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:33,830
As far as I know,

482
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,790
Cheng Yao is just working part-time in Huasheng.

483
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,070
Are you sure

484
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,510
he can put his all

485
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,310
into providing service to Yuyi?

486
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,060
Cheng Yao signed a project contract

487
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,150
with Huasheng

488
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:45,750
and there are supplementary terms.

489
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,990
This Mr. Wang is up to no good.

490
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:50,270
Will Xixi lose?

491
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:52,350
Besides...

492
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:54,470
Sun,

493
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:56,190
are you going to help?

494
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:57,790
I only believe in ability.

495
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,350
If it's just someone sitting there without doing anything,

496
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:02,200
it's meaningless for them to be working

497
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,070
24 hours full-time.

498
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:03,790
Right?

499
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:12,310
As far as I know,

500
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:14,270
there are over 30 people

501
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,830
in Yongyun's minority language department.

502
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:16,590
It covers

503
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,650
all minority languages in the world.

504
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:21,830
With just Cheng...

505
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:22,540
Yao.

506
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,510
Cheng Yao.

507
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,310
How can you fight with just one person?

508
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,510
Firstly, by using only one person,

509
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:31,310
it reduces the communication cost

510
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,240
within the team.

511
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,510
Secondly, Cheng Yao will be

512
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:36,240
directly corresponding to Yuyi's projects one on one.

513
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,710
He will not be distracted or asked to do

514
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:38,770
any other project.

515
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,030
Thirdly,

516
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,870
I heard

517
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,190
Yuyi wanted to

518
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:51,190
hire Cheng Yao at a high price previously.

519
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:52,710
to be a resource engineer

520
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:54,630
of their company.

521
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:55,870
Mr. Ying,

522
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:00,400
I think the person Yuyi has taken a liking to

523
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,790
must be top-notch in ability.

524
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,450
What do you think, Mr. Ying?

525
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:08,870
Lin Xi

526
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,390
actually had a trump card.

527
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,310
Yeah, I didn't expect that.

528
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:14,270
If the interpreter rejects Cheng Yao,

529
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,230
it means they are not approving of their

530
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,360
previous decision.

531
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,470
Lastly, I want to say,

532
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,150
working with a client

533
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:25,070
is not about conquering

534
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,550
and being conquered,

535
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,190
but a win-win situation.

536
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,630
If there's nothing else,

537
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:45,190
we can–

538
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:45,830
Wait.

539
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:51,030
Looks like he's going to make trouble again.

540
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,150
Let's wait and see.

541
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:56,950
On behalf of the board of directors,

542
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:59,190
I shall raise a question.

543
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,150
In everyone's opinion,

544
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:04,110
is there any problem that Yuyi

545
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,550
has to solve right now?

546
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:18,070
Okay.

547
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,470
I'll kick it off

548
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,790
and say something.

549
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,690
Excellent business performance

550
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,960
is the basis for listing your company.

551
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,270
Yuyi's translator

552
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:31,510
is doing well in sales

553
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:32,390
in the market.

554
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:33,550
But Yongyun

555
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,790
is willing to contribute

556
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:36,830
a little bit more.

557
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,030
Yongyun will purchase

558
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:46,390
625 units of

559
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:47,450
Yuyi's translator

560
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:49,710
to donate half of it to various universities

561
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:50,910
and use the other half

562
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,240
for our own employees.

563
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:55,720
What does this mean?

564
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,000
I think

565
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,400
this is quite a good plan.

566
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,470
Is there anything else

567
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:13,530
other companies would like to add on?

568
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,550
Okay, then I shall–

569
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:31,470
Wait.

570
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:54,590
Hello, everyone.

571
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:56,510
I'm Chen Ji from

572
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,230
Huanan Heart Association.

573
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,950
In the future, we will be

574
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:00,680
working strategically with Huasheng in the future.

575
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,390
Hello.

576
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:03,470
I'm Charlie from British

577
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:05,350
Agricultural Association.

578
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:06,790
Trade in agricultural products

579
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:10,230
represents communication of tastes

580
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:12,060
while Huasheng represents

581
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,670
communication of language.

582
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:14,910
In essence,

583
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,030
our cooperation

584
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:19,110
is to promote the development of human civilisation.

585
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:20,590
I'm Huang Kaiwen

586
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,990
from Haijiang University's computer science department.

587
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:23,830
Haijiang University's computer science department

588
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:25,590
is a core department in Xiahai.

589
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:26,350
Today,

590
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:28,270
we have officially signed a strategic cooperation agreement

591
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:29,550
with Huasheng.

592
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:30,430
I’m the in charge of

593
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:32,550
Tiansheng's Architecture department.

594
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:35,230
The strongest domain of Yuyi

595
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:37,590
is not one industry but four.

596
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:40,070
Trade, construction,

597
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:41,670
IT, and medical.

598
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,190
You merged voice recognition

599
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,350
machine translation,

600
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,950
and sound synthesis

601
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,190
together

602
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:49,950
and continuously improved it

603
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:51,210
through deep learning

604
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:53,430
which makes the system more intelligent

605
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:54,560
and almost perfect.

606
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:01,230
Economics, construction,

607
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:02,670
IT and medical

608
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:04,750
are four major fields

609
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,210
which Yuyi is developing.

610
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:08,510
Huasheng will be providing

611
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:10,590
Yuyi with all these resources.

612
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:17,110
That's all for the presentations.

613
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,989
Please take a rest.

614
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,550
We will do an internal vote.

615
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:21,510

616
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,739
Take a look at this document.

617
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:24,190
Should I check it again or...

618
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:24,989
I've checked this.

619
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:25,909
Send it to them directly.

620
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:26,580
Okay.

621
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:28,790
Let me see.

622
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:31,389
I just checked this.

623
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:32,800
I'm going to send it.

624
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,429
Xi.

625
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,469
Mr. Wang. Mr. Xu.

626
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,510
Director Lin.

627
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,550
Cheng.

628
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,980
I didn't expect you to go to Huasheng.

629
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,310
Nothing is impossible

630
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:55,510
in this world.

631
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:00,570
Director Lin, you probably don't know this yet, right?

632
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:02,190
At the beginning of the year,

633
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,110
we also tried to

634
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,070
recruit Cheng.

635
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:05,430
But at that time,

636
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:08,230
Cheng said he liked freedom

637
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:10,520
and didn't want to work in any company.

638
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:12,400
I'm curious about that.

639
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:13,910
How did you

640
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:15,510
convince Cheng?

641
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:16,750
Yeah.

642
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:18,070
Give us some tips.

643
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:20,750
Next time when we tried to recruit people,

644
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:21,870
we can use it.

645
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:25,590
You are...

646
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:28,190
Mr. Wang, right?

647
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,430
I said that

648
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:32,510
simply because

649
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,910
Yongyun was not up to my standards.

650
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:35,240
I was just being polite.

651
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:37,050
You took it seriously?

652
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:39,870
What do you

653
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,490
like about Huasheng then?

654
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:44,470
Could it be...

655
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:50,150
We have heard a lot

656
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:52,510
about Director Lin's methods.

657
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,840
This rumor...

658
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,950
Speaking of rumors,

659
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,310
I heard that...

660
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:04,670
Mr. Wang, you're Yuyi's Mr. Ying's

661
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:05,910
high school senior.

662
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:07,470
The two of you went to play golf together

663
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:08,710
a while ago too.

664
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:14,750
Mr. Xu.

665
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:15,990
I heard that your wife

666
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:17,310
often goes to those few

667
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:18,550

to look for you.

670
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:23,470
Is that true?

671
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:27,180
But

672
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,750
rumors are just rumors.

673
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,110
They're all nonsense.

674
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,870
Only a fool would believe it.

675
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:32,990
Am I right?

676
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:35,550
Yes.

677
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:36,220

Let's talk.

00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:09,310
What's wrong?

686
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:11,320
I'm worried that...

687
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,870
our relationship with Lin Xi

688
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:15,000
will affect our judgment on Huasheng.

689
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:17,000
What do you mean?

690
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:19,790
From a personal perspective,

691
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:21,590
I personally admire Lin Xi.

692
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:23,760
But from the company's perspective,

693
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,880
though Huasheng is powerful,

694
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,470
Jitianyu and Yongyun

695
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:29,240
can bring us value as a business

696
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:30,910
and give us big discounts.

732

Huasheng got two votes.

Even if the last vote

734
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:24,390
was Huasheng,

735
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:26,250

768
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:18,990
Have a date.

769
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:20,270
Thank you.

770
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:29,310
There's a starfruit down there.

771
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:32,590
I've asked Mr. Mao.

772
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:33,790
Yuyi doesn't have

773
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:36,390
this tradition of having a meal together after bidding.

774
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:37,950
You don't have to worry about

775
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:39,430
if there is such a rule.

776
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:42,550
I'll be frank with you.

777
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:44,430
What are you trying to do?

778
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:45,310
We

779
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:47,960
both know it.

780
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,610
What am I trying to do then?

781
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:53,010
Don't even think about it.

782
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:57,270
You really

783
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:01,320
don't have a say in this matter.

784
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:02,670
Uncle,

785
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:04,950
your outfit

786
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:06,750
is outdated.

787
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:11,350
You didn't eat this morning.

788
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:12,280
Eat some of this.

789
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:15,160
Since you haven't eaten anything all day,

790
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:17,010
don't touch cold food.

791
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:18,270
Have some cooked food.

792
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:25,430
I'll just have a drink.

793
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:28,430
Uncle.
