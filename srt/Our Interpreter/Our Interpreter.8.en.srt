87
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,270
is equivalent to

W of modern English alphabet.

89
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,750

90
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:32,270
"Is this a dream or do I live in a dream? This is a confusing feeling."

91

I'm a generous man.

120
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:40,990
I was just being nice

121
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,590
and you're now taking advantage of it.

122
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,110
But I also hope

123
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,390

I agree.

132
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,000

150

That's because you can.

210
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,710
I'll count to ten.

211

Come out immediately!

212
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,110
Five seconds left.

213
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:05,870
Xixi.

214
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,830
Your stomach hurts?

215
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:09,960
How about you

216
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,070
use the one in my room?

217
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:13,710
It's okay.

218
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,140
Damn you Xiao Yicheng, you caused this.

219
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,510
Cheng Yao, hurry!

220
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:22,830
-Hurry! Hurry!
-What’s wrong?

221
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,390
My god, this smell.

222
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,630
Look at you.

223
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:28,990
But

224
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,030
I use the toilet

225
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:30,550
at this time everyday.

226
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,630
Why is she so angry?

227
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,150
You know nothing.

228
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,960
When girls are on their period,

229
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,230
their stomach would ache

230
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,270
and they would be in a bad mood.

231
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,430
Listen.

232
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,430
Don’t mess with Xixi these days.

233
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,360
Do you hear that?

234
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,070
How is that project

235
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,070
going?

236
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,910
It's not easy.

237
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:05,870
It's a little difficult.

238
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,030
Lin Xi!

239
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:10,470
Wait for me!

240
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,710
Wait for the next one.

241
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:13,270
No, no, no.

242
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,390
Wait for the next one.

243
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,720
Grandaunt is right.

244
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,470
How can a woman in their special period...

245
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,670
have such a bad temper?

246
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,500
You have done your preparation

247
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,670
for the Agricultural Product Trade Exhibition right?

248
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,900
As for the minority languages,

249
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,270
have you done the necessary communications?

250
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:33,950
There's going to be Slavic languages required.

251
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,070
I’ve talked to Cheng Yao

252
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:35,830
about that part.

253
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,790
Do you want to go to the hospital?

254
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,110
I made an exception

255
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,950
for Cheng Yao to stay in the priority client management department.

256
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,710
Selena from the minority language department

257
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:01,470
complained about it

258
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,740
to Mr. Zhang.

259
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,390
So if this bidding

260
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,630
fails,

261
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,310
I won't be able to

262
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,910
go to the UN anymore.

263
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:12,110
So I will leave the Agricultural Product Trade Exhibition to you.

264
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:12,990
This is a big responsiblity.

265
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,230
I've confirmed it with my friends.

266
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,270
Charlie will definitely attend.

267
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,430
Aren't you too busy to get sick?

268
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,270
What happened to you?

269
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,270
I ate spicy food with a client.

270
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:31,950
Eat...

271
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:34,830
Haven't you not eaten

272
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:35,910
spicy food in a long time.

273
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:37,230
Besides, Yuyi will be

274
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,190
starting their bidding soon.

275
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,230
This is a top priority.

276
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:39,750
Which client can

277
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,270
let you eat spicy food with them?

278
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:47,870
Xiao Yicheng?

279
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:49,870
Did you already know that

280
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,430
he and Tong Xin

281
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,190
are not a couple?

282
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,550
Why didn't you tell me?

283
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,750
You didn't ask me.

284
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,120
How smart of you.

285
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,790
Mr. Bao, aren't you already preparing

286
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,310

288
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,590
Then I...

289
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,030
I'll be frank.

290
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,150

and water flows downwards.

292
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,310
Mr. Wang of Yongyun said

293
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,030
as long as

294
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,350
Yuyi give them this job,

295
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,190
they will be generous about the rebates.

296
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:30,630
Rebate? How generous will they be?

297
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,030
Mr. Wang has promised

298
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,550
that he can do it

299
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,590
with half the price they quoted.

300
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,670
As for the rest,

301
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,230
just give him a bank account

302
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,150
and Mr. Wang will arrange for it.

303
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,620
Of course, if you

304
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,110
are worried,

305
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,270
he can pay it in cash too.

306
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,670
Oh. Yongyun is willing to give us kickbacks?

307
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,030
Don't say that.

308
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,510
This is for your hard work.

309
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,950
You deserve it.

310
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,470

how can he guarantee the quality?

313
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,390
I think

314
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,070
I'm sure he can guarantee

315

If you

319
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,230
are worried,

320
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,470
we can also consider

321
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,870

325

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:30,870
Is that so?

327
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,230
What about Huasheng?

328

00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:00,880
and get this project.

386
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:01,870
Okay.

387
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,150
Take a look at the documents.

388
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,030
The first page is the brief.

389
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:06,630
The others

390
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,440
are the clients' information.

391
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,870
Although we had

392
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,750
a preliminary cooperation

393
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,110
with Yuyi,

394
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,150
we need to go over it

395
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,070
again.

396
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,150
Chen Wen.

397
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:18,590
You are responsible for consolidating and going through

398
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,710
the issues we have to communicate with the clients about.

399
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:22,790
Send it through an email to me before you get off work

400
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:23,670
and CC it to everyone.

401
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:26,190
Okay.

402
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:26,790
Wei Tian,

403
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,510
go and contact Yuyi.

404
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,190
Go through the

405
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,150
brief with them again tomorrow.

406
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,270
Okay, no problem.

407
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,550
Shasha, Wang Qiang.

408
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,830
The two of you assist Wei Tian.

409
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:34,790
Okay.

410
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,150
The rest of you

411
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,310
prepare for

412
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,190
brainstorm whirlwind tomorrow.

413
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:38,990
Come out with a preliminary plan

414
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,550
within this week.

415
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,150
Okay.

416
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,630
Okay.

417
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:44,270
Everyone, work hard

418
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,230
during this period.

419
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,590
We'll definitely get this project.

420
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,110
-Okay. -Okay.

421
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:55,790
You knew

422
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,230
Yuyi would get rid of the intermediary

423
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,030
and open up the bidding?

424
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,590
If Yuyi didn't remove Mr. Bao,

425
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:04,390
Huasheng would have no chance at all.

426
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,750
But you've already prepared for it.

427
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,070
I guessed this.

428
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,110
That Bao

429
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,510
keeps trying to get kickbacks.

430
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:11,470
I bet Xiao Yicheng

431
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,430
wouldn't work with him.

432
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:14,110
By the way,

433
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,630
Mr. Zhang asked me to tell you

434
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:16,750
Though Huasheng

435
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,990
is capable,

436
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,750
we need more practical experience.

437
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,830
He asked you to go socialize a little.

438
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,830
Please tell Mr. Zhang

439
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,310
if everyone is taking shortcuts,

440
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,470
then there is no more shortcuts.

441
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,910
I knew you would say that

442
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:29,870
so I've already told him that.

443
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,710
With the enemies just ahead of us,

444
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,670
why don't we go and take a look?

445
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:36,830
Just bear with it.

Hello.

I'm Chen Ji from

at 2 p.m.

Professor Chen, this way please.

[Huasheng Translation Corporation Limited]

456
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,990
I have worked with neurosurgeon Professor Zhou

457
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,670
and plastic surgery's Professor Han

458
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:00,630
before.

459
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,430
But they always choose

460
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:04,470
senior translators of at our translation department.

461
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,060
Why did you choose

462
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,710
Tan Shasha from our department?

463
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,390
Because Shasha and I

464
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,630
have met once.

465
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,110
And when we were chatting,

466
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,070
I found out that her father

467
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,750
a medical professor abroad.

468
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:15,590
So,

469
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,350
when it comes to medical terms,

470
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,510
Miss Tan will definitely be better at it.

471
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,430
I need to thank you

472
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,790
for your recognition for my subordinate.

473
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:26,150
But there's a specific procedure

474
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:27,670
for the priority client management department to take jobs.

475
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,510
I'm afraid I can't do anything

476
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,750
about this job.

477
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:31,270
But our colleagues from translation department

478
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,190
are all outstanding.

479
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,350
They can definitely help you.

480
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,190
Director Lin,

481
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,510
I have another personal reason for this.

482
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,550
Miss Tan and I

483
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:40,270
have very similar personalities.

484
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,070
In this way,

485
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,670
our communication cost will be reduced

486
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:43,870
and we can complete the translation

487
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:45,160
faster and better.

488
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,590
I understand what you mean.

489
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,830
But the company has its rules.

490
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,870
We can only accept

491
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:53,070
target clients of the priority client management department.

492
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,470
Don't make it difficult for me.

493
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:55,670
-Xi.
-Director Lin.

494
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:56,350
This...

495
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,710
I'm sorry.

496
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,190
What is it?

497
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:00,510

Yes.

00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:35,670
Miss Tan, we meet again.

509
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:36,750
Hello.

510
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:39,550
Have a seat.

511
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:44,830
You know each other

512
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:45,830
so I'll skip the introduction.

513
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:47,070
Professor Chen has

514
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,460
an academic paper

515
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,710
that he hopes you can translate.

516
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,670
When do you want the translation

517
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:57,790
for your paper to be completed?

518
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:00,670
I want to publish this on

519
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:02,680
the UK's medical journay.

520
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,390
The deadline should be

521
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:05,950
next month's 20th.

522
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,110
I'm sorry I can't do it.

523
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,630
I-Is there a problem?

524
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,030
Given how we have to translate, proofread,

525
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:21,030
and communicate with you, we don't have enough time

526
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,710
to meet the deadline.

527
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,750
In that case,

528
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:30,270
I believe it more that

529
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,350
I've found the right person.

530
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,300
Don't worry about time.

531
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,710
If we don't make it for this deadline, we can go for the next one.

532
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:37,070
If we still can't make for the next deadline,

533
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:38,710
let me put it this way,

534
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,070
Miss Tan, you seem to be rejecting this job,

535
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,470
but actually you are being extremely responsible

536
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,510
for your work.

537
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,310
Director Lin, I personally think

538
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:46,950
this job

539
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,190
is very suitable for Miss Tan.

540
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:51,820
What do you think?

541
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:54,030
Do you dare to accept this challenge?

542
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,540
Thank you for your trust.

543
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,630
I'll do my best.

544
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:00,310
Okay.

545
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:01,310
Feel free to contact me

546
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,030
if there are any issues.

547
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:02,550
Okay.

548
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:03,510
Thank you, Director Lin.

549
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:05,790
I look forward to working with you.

550
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:06,470
Same here.

551
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:06,990
Let me see you off.

552
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,550
Please stay.

553
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,150
It's okay.

554
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,870
What are you busy with now?

555
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:30,260
Writing the weekly newspaper, editing push notifications,

556
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,990
and preparing materials for the regular meetings.

557
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:38,630
Chen Wen.

558
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:39,910
Book a high-speed rail ticket

559
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:41,430
to Taiyuan for Tan Shasha the day after tomorrow.

560
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,430
Why?

561
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:44,830
What do you mean why?

562
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:47,390
Why did you suddenly change your mind

563
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,910
and allow me to go to the Agricultural Product Trade Exhibition?

564
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:52,070
Because I suddenly realized

565
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:54,070
maybe my worries are unnecessary.

566
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:55,830
For example?

567
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,110
For example,

568
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,710
I'm worried that your straightforwardness,

569
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:02,030
the way you think,

570
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,150
will offend customers.

571
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,950
But maybe some clients

572
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,750
like translators like you more.

573
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,270
I thought

574
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:12,030
you wanted to take revenge on me.

575
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:15,630
For what?

576
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,310
Because of grandpa.

577
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,270
Because grandpa favors you,

578
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,710
so I put bully you

579
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:23,350
at work?

580
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,190
I'm sorry.

581
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,110
I do that.

582
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,590
But there is only one situation for this.

583
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:33,190
By making you do more work, I can get a higher level of performance.

584
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:33,990
You...

585
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,590
Stop watching harem dramas and work hard.

586
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:41,670
Harem dramas

587
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,790
are also translated by famous translators.

[Chief Technology Officer]

589
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:04,830
What's wrong?

590
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:05,950
The school's administrative office

591
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:07,510
is collating outstanding graduates

592
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,270
and they can't find you

593
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,440
so they called me.

594
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:10,790
Can I give them

595
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:11,310
your contact?

596
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:12,590
Sure, of course.

597
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,110
You...

598
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:16,110
bought Lin Xi a meal?

599
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:17,030
Yes.

600
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,230
She can't eat spicy food.

601
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,110
She can.

602
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:20,910
She can't.

603
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:23,310
After she joined Huasheng,

604
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,910
she quit a lot food to make sure

605
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:26,020
she's at her best state the second day.

606
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:30,910
Is... she okay then?

607
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,550
She has gastroenteritis.

Busy doing the bidding proposal for you.

609
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:35,950
She refuses to even rest.

610
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:40,390
I have a meeting.

611
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:41,550
I got to go.

612
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,990
Mr. Xiao, this document...

613
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:54,670
Put it there.

What's the urgent matter?

616
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,230
Mr. Xiao.

617
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:16,990
Come down.

618
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,310
What's up?

619
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:19,990
There's something important.

620
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,990
Let's talk upstairs.

621

Hello.

622
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:32,150
Hello.

623
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,110
I have an appointment with Lin Xi.

624
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,070
Please wait a moment.

625
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,430
Hello, Mr. Xiao.

626
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,470
Xi asked me to pick you up.

627
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:40,000
Okay.

628
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,670
This way, please.

629

Mr. Xiao, this way please.

630
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,150
Welcome, Mr. Xiao.

631
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:54,110
Sorry I didn't come out to welcome you.

632
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:54,870
Mr. Zhang.

633
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:55,510
Have a seat.

634
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,350
Lin Xi told me

635
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,430
Mr. Xiao has something important

636
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:04,430
so you're visiting Huasheng.

637
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:06,680
I specially moved my other schedules.

638
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,870
What can I do for you, Mr. Xiao?

639
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,630
We aren't using an intermediary

640
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:16,100
for Yuyi's bidding this time

641
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:18,270
so I wanted to come to Huasheng

642
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,360
to see if you're willing to bid.

643
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,710
Huasheng is very actively

644
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,070
preparing for your company's bidding.

645
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:25,470
We've had a mobilization meeting.

646
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:28,030
We're working out a plan now.

647
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:34,150
Mr. Xiao...

648
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,070
Oh.

649
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:39,590
Is she sick?

650
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:42,470
No.

651
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,390
-What is it?
-Xi.

652
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:47,590
Excuse me.

653
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:51,550
Mr. Xiao.

654
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:52,150
Let me see.

655
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:53,470
There is no doubt about

656
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:54,630
Huasheng's abilities.

657
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:56,550
I can say this:

658
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:57,350
In China,

659
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:59,070
we are the top

660
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,150
of the translation industry.

661
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:09,310
This is the newcomer at Linxi's department.

662
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,150
He's a god at minority languages, Cheng Yao.

663
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:12,910
I know.

664
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:15,270
Since Mr. Xiao also knows

665
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,150
our Cheng Yao,

666
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,150
I believe

667
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:19,430
you should be very confident

668
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:20,390
about Huasheng's abilities.

669
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:26,720
Sorry.

670
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,030
I have a last minute meeting to attend.

671
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:31,350
I'll leave you to it.

672
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,390
See you.

673
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,230
Mr. Xiao, about Yuyi...

674
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,480
Go to the hospital with me.

675
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,430
Oh right,

676
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:40,630
Lin Xi,

677
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:42,880
Mr. Ding said

678
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,830
you have to attend

679
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:44,830
the meeting later too.

680
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:48,270
Sorry, Mr. Xiao.

681
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,070
I have a meeting to attend.

682
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,470

feel free to contact me.

00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,590
Mr. Xiao, something happened.

688
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:21,670
The board of directors

689
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:22,870
are here to ask about why we

690
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:24,070
got rid of the intermediary.

691
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,430
Calm them down first.

692
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:26,110
I'll be right there.

[All recordings]

694
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,070
As long as we

695
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,710
give them this order,

696
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,390
they will give us rebates.

697
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:36,550
If you are still worried,

698
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,540
you can also consider

699
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,670
Jieyin and Jitianyu.

700
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,790
But let me remind you

701
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,470
Yongyun is giving the

702
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:45,790
highest amount of rebates.

703
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:48,350
As long as...

704
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,550
This is the reason you want.

705
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,430
The bidding is coming.

706
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,950
If we approve the bidding proposals according to the procedure,

707
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,150
I'm afraid the bidding won't proceed.

708
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,110
So, this is a special situation.

709
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:10,920
We have nothing to say

710
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:12,950
if you say it's a special situation.

711
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:13,590
But

712
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:15,290
without the intermediary,

713
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,510
who will be doing the supplier list?

714
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,150
Who will be reviewing their qualifications?

715
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,950
That's right. It's not easy.

716
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:24,910
Who will take responsibility?

00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:32,670

in our department all have projects they are currently in charge of.

722
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:45,310
This is so sudden. It's hard to coordinate.

What should we do?

724
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:55,790
All right.

725
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,710
I'll do it then.

727
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,590

00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,110
How could you spare time

730
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:03,750
to do this?

731
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:05,710
I'll take responsibility

I'll treat you to something nice.

But this

745
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,700
is not our job.

746
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:49,270
The people in the procurement department

747
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:50,430
are clearly pushing their own responsibilities away.

that can do it last minute too.

751

It's such a tough job.

752
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:57,150
Why do it yourself?

753
00:32:57,870 --> 00:32:59,400
Can't you see it?

754
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,470
Be it the procurement department,

755
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:02,430
or the CEO's office,

756
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:03,630
there are people like Mr. Bao

is to IPO and list our company.

Get off.

Didn't Xi agree?

776
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,920
What's going on?

777
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,270
I queued up for so long

778
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:19,670
and bought delicious food to please her.

779
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:21,230

bowed to anyone.

Yet she still doesn't agree.

784
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,870
That's not right.

785
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:33,550
Xi always thinks highly of you.

786
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:35,150
Why wouldn't she agree?

Mr. Zhang values Xi so much.

If she pleads for me,

791
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:49,310
I will definitely be able to come back.

This is not resentment.

804
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:15,670
The workload is so strong.

805
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:16,590

00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:22,300
Does Xi know

809
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:23,350
how unambitious you are?

810
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:27,350
How would I dare let her know?

811
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:30,830
Forget it.

No.

Yes.

It should be a halfwidth comma,

Also,

00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:16,430
how many times have I told you about this?

880
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:19,030
The font size should be 14

881

and the line spacing should be 18.

882
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:21,550

Do you think what I said

885
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:29,110
is insignificant?

Is it stomachache or diarrhea?

It's a diarrhea. Had something bad.

How many times do you pass motion a day?

904
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:09,390
Is it liquid

905
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:10,230
or solid?

906
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:11,630
Is the smell strong?

907
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:13,030
It's not me.

908
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:14,390

I suggest you add this.

923
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,630
it may cause hemorrhoids.

924
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:50,070
Apply it twice in the morning for her.

956
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:38,070
Medication for inflammatory bowel.

957
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,280
Gastric medicine.

958
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:42,510
Acetamine pills.

959
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,470
No wonder you're not saying

960
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:48,510
you bought this yourself.

961
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:50,150
It's just a hemorrhoids ointment.

962
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,150
I didn't buy it.

963
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:54,190
Let me tell you.

964
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:56,070
Do you understand Chinese?

965
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:57,710
I didn't buy it.

966
00:42:58,350 --> 00:42:59,630
If you have hemorrhoids,

967
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:01,070
it's not something you can't say.

968
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:05,230
That makes sense.

969
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:34,310
What is it?

970
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:35,070
Why did you ask me out to talk about it

971
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,140
in the middle of the nigh?

972
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:44,470
Other than not eating spicy things any more,

973
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:47,110
is she any different from eight years ago?

974
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,710
You mean Lin Xi?

975
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:55,510
He doesn't eat spicy things,

976
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,550
nor sleep in.

977
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,800
She likes to go to the gym.

978
00:43:58,030 --> 00:43:59,070
She only wears three colors:

979
00:43:59,070 --> 00:43:59,860
black, white, and grey.

980
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:01,670
Oh right.

981
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:03,270
She doesn't go to karaokes anymore.

982
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:04,350
I remember you used to

983
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:05,910
go to karaoke and sing a lot.

984
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:11,880
You asked me out in the middle of the night

985
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:12,780
just to ask this?

986
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,440
Who sent this? Fess up.

987
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:25,790
Not me.

988
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:26,890
Not me either.

989
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:28,310
Xi,

990
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:29,480
could it be...

991
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,750
from someone who has a crush on you?

992
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:32,750
Could it be someone who wants to poison you?

993
00:44:32,990 --> 00:44:33,700
Right.

994
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:36,110
It's hard to say with the bidding about to happen.

995
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:40,070
Ling Feng,

996
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:41,310
you are no longer

997
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:42,430
in our department anymore.

998
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:44,440
Please leave the group yourself, okay?

999
00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:53,110
You...

1000
00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:55,310
sent medicine to Lin Xi?

1001
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:58,550
No.

1002
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:02,390
I really didn't.

1003
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:06,730
Oh no.
