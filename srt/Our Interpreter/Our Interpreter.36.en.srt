panicked

399
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:57,310
before the most important interview

400
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:59,550

401
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,200
At that time,

402
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,910
someone read me a poem.

403
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:05,170
At that moment, I calmed down right away.

404
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,790
It wasn't just because of

405
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:07,950
the beauty of that poem,

406
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:08,830

Mr. Indriðason.

418
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:32,350
What matters is not the type of language,

419

00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,080
it will never replace human translation.

Now it seems

448
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,510
the essence of translation

449
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:12,040
is not just communication,

450
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,190
but the connection between hearts.

451
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:17,350
In terms of emotional transmission and communication,

452
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:19,590
machines can only get infinitely close to humans,

453
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:21,550
but they can never replace them.

00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,350
of the internet?

459
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:34,790
Humans all

460
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,520
have the desire to meet each other.

461
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:40,830
They want to

463

and hug each other in flesh.

464
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,590
So,

465
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,440
we need to be heard,

470

are not contradictory in the first place.

471
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,030

472

00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:29,210
Powerslide.

577
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:29,960
This is powerslide?

578
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,590
Yes.

579
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:32,910
I need to go.

580
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:33,740
Okay.

581
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,310
Congratulations.

582
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:38,040

583
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:39,910
Not bad.

584
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,750
Give me your hand.

585
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:45,830
I have something for you.

586
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:48,630
Cheng Yao, we had a deal.

587
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:49,870
Don't give me those things as gifts

588
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:51,350
after we get together.

589
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:59,310
Who said

590
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,840
I'll give you those things?

591
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:09,570
Can you hear it?

592
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:11,620
This is...

593
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:12,790
This is

594
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:13,590
the congratulatory remarks

595
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,540
I made for their wedding

596
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,540
with the minority languages I know.

597
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,090
Isn't it romantic?

598
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:22,710
Besides,

599
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:23,430
you said

600
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,310
you don't want me to give you random gifts.

601
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:25,550
Of course I won't do that.

602
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,680
After all, I'm an obedient boyfriend.

603
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,000
Okay.

604
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:29,910

605
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:31,190

606

609
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:52,750
we don't have to.

610
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:54,630
I'm already more than happy

611
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:56,070
to be with you.

612
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,150
Look.

613
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:58,750
This year has passed so fast.

614
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,110
I think we'll be together

615
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,990
for another 10 years, 20 years,

616
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:02,990
or even 50 years.

617
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,110
I'm really happy.

618
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:11,390
What did you say?

619
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:15,710
Nothing.

620
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,070
I know

621
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,750
this sense of security

622
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,830
is not only brought to me by Yuyi.

623
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,410
More importantly,

624
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:28,510
it's because I have him.

625
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:10,630
What's wrong?

626
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,150
Where's Mom?

627
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,510
Your mother has an emergency

628
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,110
conference call.

629
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,070
She'll be here soon.

630
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,200
It's about to start.

631
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,390
Please be quiet.

632
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:27,070
The wedding begins now.

633
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:33,830
Let's welcome the handsome groom,

634
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,270
Wei Tian.

635
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,270
Groom Wei Tian.

636
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:43,030
Now you can marry

637
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:45,470
your beautiful bride, Tan Shasha.

638
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:19,230
Wei.

639
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,390
Before I hand Shasha over to you,

640
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:24,910
I have a story to tell you.

641
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:26,710
Go ahead, please.

642
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:28,310
A long time ago,

643
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:29,880
there was a father.

644
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:31,910
Yes, that's me.

645
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,670
One day,

646
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:35,600
he found out his wife was pregnant.

647
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,590
He told her that

648
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:39,990
he wanted a daughter.

649
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:43,100
God bless me.

650
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,390
It really brought

651
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,830
Shasha into our lives.

652
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,950
I'm the first person

653
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:51,610
to ever hold Shasha in my arms.

654
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:55,990
I watched her grow up.

655
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:58,990
Look.

656
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,110
How cute, generous,

657
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,710
gentle, and kind she is.

658
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:05,980
But

659
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,310
sometimes she can be a little willful

660
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,230
and unreasonable.

661
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,430
Will you accept

662
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:13,830
Shasha like this?

663
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:18,000
Yes.

664
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:21,590
My Shasha.

665
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:23,890
She's the apple of our eye.

666
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,270
You must love her, protect her,

667
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,310
and respect her.

668
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:32,200
You must make her feel happy

669
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:34,150
for a lifetime.

670
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,230
Today,

671
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:45,750
I'll hand my most precious daughter

672
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:46,710
over to you.

673
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,750
Don't worry, Uncle.

674
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:55,270
What was that?

675
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:00,100
Don't worry, Dad.

676
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:05,990
Go.

677
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:07,990
I'll leave her to you.

844
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,520

Why did you come so soon?

846
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:00,910
Today

A special day?

849
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,750
It's not our wedding anniversary.

850

Today is the

851
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:12,230
12th anniversary of our acquaintance.

852
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,110
It's not the 12th anniversary.

853
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:15,970
It's the 11th anniversary, okay?

854
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,670
What a bad memory.

855
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:19,790
The first time I saw you

856
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:21,670
was when I went to promote face masks

at your school.

858
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:28,670
Wasn't it?

Wasn't it the first time we met?

860
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:33,870
I remember

861
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,230
it was also a snowy winter

862
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,750
that year.

863
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,480

of Haijiang University

894
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,950

Do you really understand

why I came to the UN?

929
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:35,840
You once said that

930
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:39,950
interpreters' lives are tedious.

931
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:41,430
They are always invisible

behind the spotlight,

933
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:46,150

over and over again.

935
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,280
Yet it feels like skating on thin ice.

their work

938
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:53,630
is not simple.

939
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:55,490
They're translating languages.

940
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:59,310
They are bridges, boats,

941
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:01,530
high-speed trains, and flights.

942
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:05,080
They're the link that connects the world.

943
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:07,430

You're already one of them now.

948
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:21,750

949
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:23,410
I got some new understanding.

950
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:28,440
People who work hard

951
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,910
will shine

952
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:30,910
for what they love

953
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:33,110
no matter

954
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:34,570
what position they are in.

955
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:37,710
I agree.

956
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:40,960
Wait.

957
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:43,280
Where do you

958
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,030
want to go and shine this time?

959
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:50,270
I do want to go somewhere else.

960
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:53,070
Geneva is far enough.

961
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:54,220
What?

962
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:55,790
You said you'd respect my choice.

963
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:56,630
Do you regret it now?

964
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:57,630
No.

965
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:58,950
I support you.

966
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:04,070
Mr. Zhang called me several days ago,

967
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:06,430
saying that Huasheng and Yuyi

968
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:07,750
will have in-depth cooperation

969
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:09,910
to promote the machine translation industry.

970
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:10,670
So?

971
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:12,530
They'll establish a subsidiary.

972
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:15,550
The helmsman of this company...

973
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:19,790
So, you mean...

974
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:22,190
Guess

975
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:24,270
what my choice will be this time.

976
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:42,580
♫Can you not be silent?♫

977
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:48,020
♫Share with me more♫

978
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:52,940
♫When my ending has to include you♫

979
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,690
♫It's us on this journey♫

980
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:01,750
♫And you will have me♫
