00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,080
I'm coming.

11
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,510
How is your neck?

12
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,160
Did you put the poultice on?

13
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:18,910
Come in.

14
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:24,310
I'm afraid you still feel pain.

15
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,430
What are you doing?

16
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,290
Don't you want to look at the neck?

17
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,350
I can just

18
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,880
look at your neck like this.

19
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,990
It's okay. You put the poultice on.

20
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:37,740
Does it still hurt?

21
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,470
Yes. I can't sleep at night.

22
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,960
Let's go to the hospital.

23
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,950
Don't go to the hospital.

24
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,079
It's not gonna help.

25
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,550
I just

26
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,210
need psychological comfort.

27
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:50,950
Since

28
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:52,870
your parents

29
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,470
know we're together,

30
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,630
then move in with me.

31
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:58,990
Okay.

32
00:02:59,150 --> 00:02:59,950
Really?

33
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,910
Believe it or not,

34
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,870
if I move in tonight,

35
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,730
your neck will be gone right away.

36
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,430
Don't tell Lin.

37
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,230
Okay.

38
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,230
Dream on.

39
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,190
Anything can happen in a dream.

40
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,140
It hurts.

41
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,310
What brings you

42
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,070
here today?

43
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:37,310
Don't talk about me, Grandaunt.

44
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,910
You still know I'm your grandaunt?

45
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,840
You're ungrateful.

46
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:44,710
You haven't visited me for days.

47
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,510
Thank you.

48
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,380
I've been busy.

49
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,200
I think there's something bothering you.

50
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,710
Is it so obvious?

51
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,110
You broke up?

52
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,910
Lin Xi told you this?

53
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,510
You told Lin Xi,

54
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:06,770
but you didn't tell me.

55
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,710
If your mother

56
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,590
gives you trouble in the future,

57
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,230
I won't help you.

58
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,070
No, I didn't. Grandaunt.

59
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,230
Tell me then.

60
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,270
Don't be angry if I tell you.

61
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,910
Recently,

62
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,750
I fell in love with a woman.

63
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,430
But she's older than me.

64
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,510
She was married

65
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,909
and has a son.

66
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,390
You're a homewrecker?

67
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:35,710
This...

68
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:36,909
They got divorced because of you?

69
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:37,659
No, no, no.

70
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,030
They got divorced a long time ago.

71
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,990
Then why should I be angry?

72
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:44,310
Don't you think we're not right for each other?

73
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,270
Am I so old-fashioned?

74
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,110
I've never

75
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,070
been married.

76
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,230
I've heard a lot of rumors.

77
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,710
Have I ever cared?

78
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,670
As long as the two people

79
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,180
don't break the law

80
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,110
and like each other,

81
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,830
it's your own business.

82
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,190
My good grandaunt.

83
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,510
You almost broke

84
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,190
my old bones.

85
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,150
Don't tell me

86
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,990
that's what's bothering you.

87
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,710
No.

88
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,430
I think she has feelings

89
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,860
for me.

90
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,990
But she's been avoiding me these days.

91
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,150
Just chase her if she avoids me.

92
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:27,990
I did.

93
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,450
I chased her shamelessly.

94
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,350
But my methods didn't work.

95
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,390
You look like you're giving up.

96
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,430
Of course I won't.

97
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,870
But I'm out of ideas.

98
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,110
This is just a beginning.

99
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,390
If I was like you back then,

100
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,510
I would regret it now.

101
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,510
Grandaunt.

102
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,360
Tell me.

103
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:03,830
Grandaunt.

104
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,150
Wait for my good news.

105
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,270
Aren't you going to have dinner with me before leaving?

106
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,560
Next time, Grandaunt.

107
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:55,850
Why are you here again?

108
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,950
To see you.

109
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:57,870
Come with me.

110
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,950
Didn't I make it clear?

111
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,470
Yes, you did.

112
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:06,630
But you also said

113
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,830
we can be friends.

114
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,830
We're still superior and subordinate.

115
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,510
For business or personal matters,

116
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,030
even though I can't chase you,

117
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,350
I have to see you.

118
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,470
You've watched Infernal Affairs for many times?

119
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,710
You took me to the rooftop.

120
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,110
I want to be a good person.

121
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,430
Why did you bring me here?

122
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,470
Why did you ask me to change my shoes?

123
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,750
For the future of your Yuyi.

124
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,350
And also for

125
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,210
the cooperation of our Huasheng.

126
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,710
What do you mean?

127
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,909
Jump rope?

128
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:57,380
Yes.

129
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,440
It keeps you alive.

130
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,230
It's not 12 o'clock yet.

131
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,790
You already drank four cups of coffee.

132
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:05,790
Do you want to die?

133
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,630
Although work is a tough battle,

134
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,630
health is the most important thing.

135
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,070
If you don't exercise

136
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,530
and take care of yourself,

137
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,920
how will Yuyi go public?

138
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:16,630
Cheng Yao.

139
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,680
I'm already very tired.

140
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,670
I don't like sports.

141
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,030
No one likes sports.

142
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,650
But listen to my analyses.

143
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,200
You need to make money to raise Peter, right?

144
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,870
You need to make money

145
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,530
to pay your employees, right?

146
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,030
If you're not well,

147
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,750
how can you take care of them?

148
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,030
So, Tong Xin,

149
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:35,630
I'm asking you to exercise

150
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,909
not for yourself,

151
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,690
but for the people around you.

152
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,350
Today's task is easy.

153
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:44,750
Make 1,000 jumps.

154
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,430
If you don't finish it,

155
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,690
I won't let you go down.

156
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,270
Ms. Tong.

157
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,670
Come on.

158
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:08,750
I'll begin now.

159
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,190
One.

160
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,630
It's a rough start.

161
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,230
Can you stop talking so much?

162
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:18,870
Okay.

163
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:23,430
One, two, three, four, five.

164
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:24,710
Good.

165
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:25,440
1,000 jumps.

166
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,510
How many jumps have I made?

167
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,230
Six.

168
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:33,030
Three, four, five, six.

169
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,270
Seven, eight, nine, ten.

170
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:37,110
You failed to make the tenth one.

171
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:37,860
I'm so tired.

172
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:54,630
Is it over?

173
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,310
No.

174
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,330
Let me take you to jump.

175
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,470
You're so far away from me.

176
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,670
The rope will hit you.

177
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,990
It won't hit me if I stay here, right?

Are you ready?

181
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:27,680
Let's start.

00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:24,480
♫I have many new ideas when I meet you♫

192
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:30,770
♫Embraced by love, we attracted each other♫

193
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,560
♫Secrets that haven't been exchanged, you're the answer♫

194
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,920
♫Love means that no matter where we go, our hearts are always together♫

195
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,310
Well...

196
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,550
That's all for today.

197
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,710
Consider it a warm-up.

198
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:40,710
No. We made a deal.

199
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:41,790
You can't leave if you don't make 1,000 jumps.

200
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,150
I have a meeting later.

201
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:43,830
No.

202
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:44,910
What's wrong?

203
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,110
What's wrong?

204
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,850
Did I hit your face?

205
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:52,840
Let me see.

206
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:53,470
No, no, no.

207
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,110
I'm disfigured.

208
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,350
Let me see.

209
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,310
It's so serious.

210
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,510
Really?

211
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,880
Where are you going?

212
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,990
I'm going to get you some ointment.

213
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,250
Your wound would have gone if I were late.

214
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:10,620
Ms. Tong.

215
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:12,870
Does it so hurt?

216
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,190
Chopsticks.

217
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:16,790
Thank you.

218
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,110
Listen.

219
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,630
You ate too little.

220
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,870
You need to exercise more.

221
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,310
Look, you need carbohydrates.

222
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,070
Hello.

223
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,840
Give her some rice, please.

224
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,430
More, more.

225
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,150
Yes. And the vegetables.

226
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,870
And some meat.

227
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,350
And this egg.

228
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,470
And fish.

229
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:43,750
There's more?

230
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,990
You have to eat protein.

231
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,230
And some fruit.

232
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,960
Then you can have vitamins.

233
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,190
Enough.

234
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:50,360
Here.

235
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:51,930
I want the same.

236
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:58,270
Listen.

237
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,470
You have to eat more today

238
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,330
so that we can continue tomorrow.

239
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:03,140
Continue what?

240
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,570
Continue to exercise.

241
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,710
I've known you for so long.

242
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:07,580
You exercise?

243
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,320
Cheng Yao, forget it.

244
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,310
Exercise is not suitable.

245
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:12,470
Let's stop.

246
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:14,630
But don't you think

247
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,200
the pain caused by lactic acid

248
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,510
makes your back and neck

249
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,720
more relaxed?

250
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,230
But I'm busy.

251
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,670
I have to check

252
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,710
the website tonight.

253
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:23,630
It's our responsibility

254
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,470
to check it with Marco.

255
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,140
I also have a meeting

256
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:28,950
with Rita.

257
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,110
That meeting

258
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:38,570
has been rescheduled for tomorrow at 10 a.m.

259
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:39,790
Thank you.

260
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:41,510
Excuse me.

261
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:43,950
Thanks.

262
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,900
Do you think Cheng Yao has a good chance of winning?

263
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,590
I don't know.

264
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,670
Tong Xin is obviously avoiding him.

265
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:00,110
Her avoidance means Cheng Yao still has a chance.

266
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,440
She avoided him because she feels guilty.

267
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:03,750
Do you still think

268
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,390
he has a good chance of winning

269
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,590
after hearing what I told you last time?

270
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,410
Let's go get some food.

271
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,040
Let's go.

272
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:34,950
[Chen Ji]

273
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,670
Hello, Professor Chen.

274
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,630
Hello, Shasha.

275
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:42,000
I'm sorry to bother you so late.

276
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,550
About that book,

277
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,310
I have some

278
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:45,660
additional information for you.

279
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,910
What book?

280
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,630
I asked Huasheng to translate

281
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,230
Cardiovascular Disease

282
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:50,950
Diagnosis and Technology

283
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:51,990
I wrote.

284
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,030
I specially designated you to do it.

285
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,690
Didn't your company tell you?

286
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,630
When did you

287
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,740
tell the company?

288
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,230
Last Friday.

289
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,390
Maybe the company

290
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,870
is still going through the process.

291
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:07,870
Send the information

292
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:08,870
to my email first.

293
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:09,870
I'll ask them.

294
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,320
Okay.

295
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,190
Okay.

296
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:36,910
Are you feeling better?

297
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,040
I need to talk to you.

298
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:38,790
Good.

299
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:39,860
I need to talk to you too.

300
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:40,390
Let's go.

301
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,150
Shasha.

302
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:49,830
This is

303
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,640
the information about Yuyi's going public.

304
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,950
Get familiar with it first.

305
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,030
Prepare the structure of a PowerPoint presentation

306
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:54,960
when you go back.

307
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:55,790
I'll go through it with you

308
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,590
next week.

309
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,350
You'll report it

310
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,750
to Mr. Ding and Mr. Zhang.

311
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:02,670
Giving a report is your job.

312
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,230
Why should I do it?

313
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,730
How long will it take to finish the structure?

314
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,610
What about Chen Ji's book?

315
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,190
When will the company give it to me?

316
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,390
He also has a tight schedule.

317
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,670
I have to read the book

318
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,200
before I estimate the time.

319
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:26,870
Did he call you?

320
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:31,870
That job

321
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,430
has been assigned to someone else.

322
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,150
He chose me.

323
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,390
He chose Huasheng.

324
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,230
Besides, book translation

325
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,360
is the translation department's job.

326
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,030
Although Chen Ji is

327
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:50,550
the consultant of the Enjiu Pharmaceutical,

328
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,590
his project

329
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,110
is a personal request.

330
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:55,390
It's outside

331
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,710
the scope of our Huasheng priority client management department's

332
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:57,870
intervention.

333
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,950
You works in the priority client management department.

334
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:00,630
You should follow the assignment

335
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:03,290
of the priority client management department.

336
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,230
Shasha.

337
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:16,069
I know

338
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:18,670
you've been working hard and tired these days.

339
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,270
As your superior

340
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,630
and your boyfriend,

341
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,030
I hope you can focus

342
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,630
on more important things.

343
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,590
More important things?

344
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:32,190
Is it to report things to the leaders?

345
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,190
Yuyi's project

346
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:38,450
is the most important project this year.

347
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:39,990
Its KPI makes up the majority.

348
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:41,390
But translating Chen Ji's book

349
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:43,070
is also what I want to do.

350
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,030
As a translator,

351
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,510
I hope to delve deeper

352
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:47,830
into a certain field.

353
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,630
Then when I settle down

354
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:50,910
and look back,

355
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,190
I'll at least have left a footprint

356
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,260
in a certain field.

357
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,470
Instead of

358
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:55,950
formalism.

359
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,750
If I have to choose,

360
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,690
I'd rather translate Chen Ji's book.

361
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:04,870
Shasha.

362
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,030
Don't be willful.

363
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,550
I'm not being willful.

364
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:11,110
I'm explaining my choice to you.

365
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:13,030
So please respect me.

366
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,070
Let me ask you.

367
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,510
If you were

368
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,910
an ordinary employee,

369
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,750
would you refuse the task

370
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,210
I assigned you so eagerly?

371
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:24,910
What do you mean?

372
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,480
Shasha.

373
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,910
Professor Gao is your grandfather.

374
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:32,510
You come from a long line of famous translators.

375
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:33,910
A good family is a way out.

376
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:34,750
That's right.

377
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,470
But as your boyfriend,

378
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,030
I don't want you

379
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,670
to choose such a way out.

380
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,270
You should know

381
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,430
that the best way out

382
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,470
is to take a good path forward.

383
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,550
Wei Tian.

384
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:46,640
We've known each other for so long.

385
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:47,630
Do you think I'm the kind of person

386
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:48,510
who would act willfully

387
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,170
because of my relationships?

388
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,550
Shasha.

389
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,830
I didn't mean that.

390
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:56,750
I'm not saying

391
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,990
you're spoiled.

392
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,240
You work hard too.

393
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,350
But some things

394
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,430
are in your DNA.

395
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:02,030
They're expressed

396
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,270
subconsciously.

397
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,630
Okay. I understood.

398
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,990
I'll do what you asked me to do.

399
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,050
But I'll translate Chen Ji's book too.

400
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:31,470
Auntie Wang.

401
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,710
Shasha, you're back.

402
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:33,920
Come.

403
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,670
I stewed

404
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,130
your favorite ribs today.

405
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:39,190
I ate bread on the way.

406
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,390
I have work to do.

407
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:41,790
I'll go upstairs first.

408
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:42,910
Stop.

409
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:44,870
Come and eat.

410
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,760
Don't blame me for my accusatory tone.

411
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,150
Look at you.

412
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,830
You're haggard like a ghost.

413
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,590
What's going on?

414
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,390
Eat.

415
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,230
Try the ribs.

416
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:28,110
Your mother specially told me

417
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,870
not to stew it too long today.

418
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,190
She said, "Our Shasha

419
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:33,190
doesn't like soft ribs."

420
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,700
What's wrong?

421
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,390
I didn't say anything about you.

422
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:41,230
Look at you.

423
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,710
What happened?

424
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,310
What happened?

425
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,710
Did you two argue?

426
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,270
I really hope you two argue.

427
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,060
I don't want him

428
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,150
not to know

429
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,350
you're sad like this.

430
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,640
Mommy.

431
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,520
I really like him.

432
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:21,630
I also tried my best

433
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,160
to be with him.

434
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,270
But I don't know

435
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:27,470
why it ended like this.

436
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,310
Since you told me,

437
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,310
I'll say more.

438
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,070
You think I don't agree

439
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:38,070
because he's not rich enough

440
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,630
and has no status, right?

441
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:43,150
You underestimated me.

442
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,670
All parents

443
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,630
want their children to be good.

444
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,750
But this is not just

445
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:51,190
about materials.

446
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:53,230
Your views also have to

447
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,240
match.

448
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,990
If you're in a relationship,

449
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:58,340
you just need love.

450
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,550
But the marriage is different.

451
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:03,480
Who will cook? Who will sweep the floor?

452
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,590
Whether the toothpaste is squeezed out

453
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,000
from the bottom or the middle

454
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,340
may cause a big mess.

455
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:10,670
But is there no way to

456
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:12,470
overcome these problems?

457
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:14,750
Baby,

458
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:18,150
if you rely on overcoming problems to maintain a relationship,

459
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:19,790
it'll be very tiring.

460
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:22,230
Shasha.

461
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,870
I believe

462
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,880
you've experienced it, right?

463
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,790
I had a fight with him today.

464
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:38,350
He wanted me to do that project.

465
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,030
But I want to do

466
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,510
the project I like.

467
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,350
And then?

468
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,190
He said,

469
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,310
"If you were

470
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,790
a new employee,

471
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:52,150
you wouldn't be so willful.

472
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:55,950
But because of your family background,

473
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,990
you dare to say no in the company."

474
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:02,230
He's right.

475
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,510
Mommy.

476
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,430
But, Shasha,

477
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,550
I also think you're right.

478
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,550
You don't care about

479
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,720
the chances of promotion.

480
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,310
Instead, you care about the projects

481
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,750
that you're interested in.

482
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,830
I support you.

483
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,750
In the world,

484
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,270
Humans are diverse.

485
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,110
But

486
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:24,220
Aunt and Uncle

487
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:26,150
are very different

488
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:29,280
but they can still happily live together for a lifetime.

489
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,720
If back then,

490
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,150
your aunt didn't marry your uncle,

491
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,190
I think her life

492
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:38,190
would've had another possibility.

493
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:41,550
Of course,

494
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,630
your uncle

495
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,030
has never mistreated your aunt

496
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,910
in terms of material and emotional.

497
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:48,820
But,

498
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,830
don't you know how talented you aunt is?

499
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:54,150
Your grandpa had high hopes for her.

500
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,030
If she continued on

501
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,470
this path,

502
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,710
right now

503
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:59,070
she could be

504
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:01,270
working in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

505
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:03,030
However, she married Lin Dayong

506
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,260
out of love.

507
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,120
Look at her now.

508
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,150
Do you think it's worth it?

509
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,590
Shasha.

510
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,830
When two people decide to be together,

511
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:16,590
they have to stick together through thick and thin.

512
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,230
If they can't,

513
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,750
one of them

514
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,150
have to make sacrifices.

515
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,440
Tell Mommy now.

516
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:26,070
Have you made up your mind?

517
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:28,110
Can you sacrifice for him?

518
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,310
Or can you persuade him

519
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,750
to sacrifice for you?

520
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:39,870
Don't cry.

521
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:42,150
Mommy, I'm sorry.

522
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,670
Don't.

523
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:44,830
Why are you crying? Mommy...

524
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:47,110

But let's make one thing clear.

552
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:21,630
I may need some time

553
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:23,310

I value quality, not speed.

557
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,510
This book has compiled

558
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,870
many years of my effort.

559
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:31,960
I hope to find someone reliable

560
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,070
to translate it.

561
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,150
Alright.

562
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:36,670
Thank you for your trust.

563
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,030
I heard

564
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,390
you are not feeling well lately.

565
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,230
Is it serious?

566
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,100
You're treating me as a stranger.

567
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,070
You know I'm a doctor,

568
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,470
why didn't you tell me about it?

569
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:46,950
I'm already recovering.

00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:47,990

Take a look first.

574
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,010
Tian, do you want some coffee?

575
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:54,950
Hello.

576
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,860
I'm taking away the four cups of latte

577
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,510
and four cups of americano

578
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,570
I ordered just now.

Why do you look so pale?

581
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:03,550
I didn't rest well yesterday.

582
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:04,390
Aren't you the kind

00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:05,990
to fall asleep immediately?

584
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:06,910
Yes.

585
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:07,680
You can join these two together

586
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,470
and read it as a while

587
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:08,790
Okay.

00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:09,590
Okay, thank you.

Here's your coffee.

After the translation and verification

00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,150
we'll take a day off.

00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,230

00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:54,230
Mr. Lu, do you have

603
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,430
anything else to add?

604
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,750
Lin Xi has covered pretty much everything.

605
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,070
In the next few days,

606
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,550
I hope the priority client management department

607
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,550
and the translation department

608
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:02,470
can give this project

00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:03,470
a wonderful ending.

00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,350
Thank you.

00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,220
Okay, you are dismissed.

Let's talk.

614
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:18,310
Why did you suddenly

615
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,350
want to break up?

616
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,000
You didn't even answer my calls.

00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,150
I think I've already made myself

618
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:23,110
clear enough.

619
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:25,150
There's no need to say anything.

620
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:28,090
Is it because of the task assigned last time?

621
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,570
Then, is it because of Chen Ji?

622
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,790
I saw him with you.

623
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,030
Why did he come over?

624
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,270
What did he tell you?

625
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,750
This is my personal matter.

Did you offend her?

633
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,350
The only conflict

634
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,350
could be that

635
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,590
I arranged a task

636
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,720
from Yuyi for her yesterday

637
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,590
and didn't let her

638
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,050
go for her work for Chen Ji.

639
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,770
Why didn't you let her do it?

is a monograph on cardiology.

644
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,670
You also know that translating books like this

645
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:29,870
requires a large amount of professional terminology

646
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:31,710
and consumes a lot of mental capacity.

647
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:33,030
Plus, Shasha has high requirements

648
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,390
for her own professionalism.

00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:35,720
After the translation,

650
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:38,010
wouldn't she be even more exhausted?

651
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:40,300
Then why did you

652
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,110
let her to do the presentation?

653
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,030
She just became a regular employee recently.

654
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,490
She needs to be evaluated.

655
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:51,140
She's Professor Gao's granddaughter.

656
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:51,870
That's true.

657
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,770
But that's a double-edged sword.

658
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,560
When she does a good job,

659
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:56,750
people would say

660
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,080
that is expected of her.

661
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,470
If she does badly,

662
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:00,870

663
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:02,400
saying she took a shortcut.

00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:05,550
I gave her the presentation task

665
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,670
is so that she can receive acknowledgements

666
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:09,470
from the leaders in person.

667
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:11,510
Besides,

668
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:13,870
I don't want the leaders to think that

669
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:16,330
she's just Professor Gao's granddaughter.

670
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:19,950

these two reasons?

672
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:23,430
She broke up with me

673
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,190
before I got to tell her.

674
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:30,470
Besides,

when you treat a person well,

676
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:34,310

00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,710

But why does she

684
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,990
still despise you so much?

685
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:55,910
That's why

00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:57,440

The ready-made example is right in front of you.

00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,480
Try your best to court her back.

691
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:08,710
What do you mean?

692
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:09,680
Make it clearer.

If she ignores you,

698
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,490
you'll have to act shameless.

699
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,470
Use her way of thinking

701
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,740
and try to integrate into her life.

702
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:24,510
By the way,

703
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:26,150
the most important thing is

704
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,510
to use the self-torture trick

705
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,230
when necessary.

706
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,710
What are you talking about?

707
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:33,430
I...

708
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,110
I can't do this.

709
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:35,750
Look.

710
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:37,590
Even deities can't save him.

711
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,230
In my opinion,

Tan Shasha breaking up with you

713
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,680

I'm telling you this

717

precisely because we're friends.

718
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:52,350
The options of love and pride

719
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,430
are laid in front of you.

720
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:54,760
Choose between the two.

721
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:56,030
The thing is I don't even know

722
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,190
what I did wrong.

I'm wrong, okay?

727
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:03,150
You shouldn't be asking

728

What have you done wrong.

729
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,190
Why don't you think about

732

Stop telling him these.

734
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:11,910
If he knew,

735
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:13,970
the situation wouldn't be like this.

736
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:14,910
Let me tell you.

737
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:16,750
The most important thing now is that

738
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,870
you need to communicate properly with Shasha.

739
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,710
Have a deep conversation.

740
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:24,870
I can't even

742
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:28,390
She ignores me.

743
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:29,910
Then you can

744
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:31,970
create an opportunity for yourself.

745
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:33,320
Create an opportunity?

746
00:32:59,230 --> 00:32:59,950

00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:02,840

00:42:58,590 --> 00:42:59,710
Let me know

956
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:00,630
when you get home.

957
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:01,430
I'm really sorry

958
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:03,350
for what happened today.

959
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:05,190
Don't be sorry.

960
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:07,030
I'm the abrupt one.

961
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:10,190
I can tell that

962
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:12,710
you still have feelings for him.

963
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:15,310
I've tried my best.

964
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:18,030
I have no regrets.

965
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:21,150
Shasha,

966
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:22,950
I hope

967
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:25,270
you leave no regrets too.

968
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:31,750
Goodbye.
