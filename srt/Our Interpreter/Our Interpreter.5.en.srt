391
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,480
Call her and tell her you're safe.

392
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:18,830
No.

393

398
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:40,910
I forgot to tell you.

399
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:41,630
Last month,

400
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,750
a girl started renting here.

401
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,430
Who?

402
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,710
You don't know her.

403
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,390
Well, I have to meet her.

404
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,790
At your old age,

405
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:50,870
it's dangerous if you don't know

406
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:51,790
everything about a stranger.

407
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,430
Tell me.

408
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,830
What's her name?

409
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:56,230
How old is she?

410
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,480
Where does she work?

411
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,470
Do you have any photos?

412
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,030
Are you doing a background check?

413
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,350
The girl

414
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,550
is from Huasheng Translation Company.

415
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,750
She's the director of the priority client management department.

416
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:07,910
Seven or eight years ago,

417
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:09,510
we already made contact with each other.

418
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:11,470
She's a good girl.

419
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,750
Don't worry.

420
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,150
Grandaunt,

421
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:24,830
there is still a room available

422
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,240
in our house, right?

423
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:27,950
Yes. Why?

424
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,230
Let me move in. What do you think?

425
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,150
Okay.

426
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,430

Take a look when you have time.

436
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,630
Right. One more thing.

437
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:06,470
I think it's necessary

438
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:07,430
to tell you.

just want to rubberneck.

Aren't you...

450
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,460

00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,710
we would think that Lin Xi

00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:42,640

Li Jun said there was an order.

572
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:37,090
Because he wanted to trick Lin Xi into coming here.

573
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:42,860

574
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,070
Don't

00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,150
But

580
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:58,230
the wife of our boss doesn't want to give it to you.

581
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,910
If you want to blame someone,

582
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,750
blame your Huasheng's Linxi.

583
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,430
She's famous.

584
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,590
A beautiful woman

585
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,070
is doing well

586
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,000
in the workplace.

587
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,670
It's inevitable

588
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:13,860
that there are some rumors.

589
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,470
You know.

590
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:20,710
Like what?

591
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,720
Don't listen to his nonsense...

592
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,200
He hasn't said anything yet.

593
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:25,430
How do you know it's nonsense?

594
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,870
No.

595
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:28,770
Don't you know

596
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,960
what kind of person Lin Xi is?

597
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,390
I don't know.

598
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:36,410
I really don't know.

599
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,070
Tell me.

600
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:51,240
The things about Lin Xi

601
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,590
have already spread among the classmates.

602
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:55,260
Wei Tian,

603
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,760
don't protect her.

604
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,440
I know she's your leader.

605
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:00,600
But she's not here.

606
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:01,720
What are you afraid of?

607
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,810
I'm not protecting her.

608
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,400
Wei Tian.

609
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:03,940
I...

610
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:05,150
Let her finish.

611
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:06,270
Go on.

612
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:11,340
Then I'll set the ball rolling.

613
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,050
It's said that Lin Xi is a girl

614
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:15,920
who came from a low-ranking national key university.

615
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:17,870
She came to our school to get herself a boyfriend.

616
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,270
Her purpose

617
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:22,030
was obvious

618
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:23,670
to everyone.

619
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:24,380
That's right.

620
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:26,060
As expected.

621
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,460
Xiao

622
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,370
didn't get admitted to Matisse Institute of Technology

623
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,230
and she dumped her.

624
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,790
But what she

625
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:33,990
didn't expect is

626
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:36,520
Xiao returned home in glory.

627
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:38,270
She probably is

628
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:39,590
regretting it now.

629
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:40,870
Right?

630
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,440
She must be regretting it.

631
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,170
Xiao,

632
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,360
you also think I'm right,

633
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,020
right?

634
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:02,620
How could you like

635
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:03,970
someone like her?

636
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,390
You didn't like her previously,

637
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:07,170
all the more you don't now.

638
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,470
You're really just talking nonsense.

639
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:14,310
Back then,

640
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:16,790
I was the one who pestered Lin Xi.

641
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:18,550
You all lost your memories?

642
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:30,180
I'm just saying

643
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:31,690
what I heard from other people.

644
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:33,190
Sure.

645
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,500
But

646
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:37,430
I don't know

647
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:38,380
if she's regretting now.

648
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:42,640
Who else wants to talk about it?

649
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,280
[Zhao]

650
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,280
[Reject] [Answer]

651
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:06,150
This guy could smell the tea

652
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:07,670
from so far away.

653
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:08,630
Who is it?

654
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,190
Zhao.

655
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:12,670
Zhao!

656
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:13,989
Zhao!

657
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:15,030
Zhao!

658
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,030
Zhao!

659
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,670
You're all here.

660
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:19,830
Why didn't you inform me you guys are having a gathering?

661
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:20,949
Inform you?

662
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:22,190
You're teaching in the mountain area.

663
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,190
Can you come?

664
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,710
Where's Xiao?

665
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:25,949
Here.

666
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:27,670
Xiao.

667
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:29,070
I must

668
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,630
treat you to a meal this time.

669
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:31,270
Why?

670
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,550
This is unfair.

671
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,469
Why only Xiao?

672
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:36,949
Is it because he's successful

673
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,110
and you're trying to suck up to him?

674
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:39,389
I despise you.

675
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:40,960
I despise you.

676
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:42,440
I despise you.

677
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,280
Despise.

678
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,310
All right, I'm hanging up.

679
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,949
Wait, wait, wait.

680
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:49,350
Xiao, didn't you tell them?

681
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:50,310
What?

682
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,150
There's something

683
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,710
that we don't know?

684
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:56,830
Tell us.

685
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:58,310
There really is.

686
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:00,630
When Xiao was doing evaluation

687
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:01,990
for their machine translator,

688
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,070
they sponsored 100 sets

689
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:05,100
for our county's education bureau at no cost.

690
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,110
With the help

691
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,790
of his company's products,

692
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:08,630
the level of

693
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:10,750
English exam scores in the county's middle school exam

694
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:12,110
saw a huge level of improvement.

695
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,630
You guys

696
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,270
should learn from Xiao.

697
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:16,510
Look at his awareness.

698
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:18,110
Enough. You talk too much.

699
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:18,870
I'm hanging up.

700
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:22,190
Is that true?

701
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:25,060
Just given this,

702
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:27,430
we need to learn from Xiao.

703
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:28,310
Come on.

704
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:29,030
Come on.

705
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:29,670
Cheers.

706
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:30,710
Cheers!

707
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:31,550
Come on, cheers!

708
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:32,030
Here.

709
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:32,950
Thank you.

710
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:39,350
Let's do it together next time.

711
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:39,950
Sure.

712
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:42,910
Yes.

713
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:44,180
Mr. Sun must have

714
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,270
taken out the good wine

715
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:46,310
he collected.

716
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:51,830
Excuse me.

717
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:11,230
Xi.

718
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,360
Mr. Sun.

719
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:13,950
Let me introduce to you.

720
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:14,950
Tan Shasha.

721
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,270
She was awarded first place

722
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:17,790
at the international translation competition,

723
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:18,390
the Youth Translation Competition.

724
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:18,990
She is now rotating

725
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,070
in our priority client management department.

726
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:22,750
This is today's host,

727
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,870
Jingge Fund's Sun Youwei, Mr. Sun.

728
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,790
Let me drink a toast to the two beautiful ladies.

729
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:27,990
To you.

730
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,190
Cheers.

731
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:40,870
I'm allergic to alcohol.

732
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,060
Looks like we didn't prepare

733
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,830
good enough wine today.

734
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:47,950
That's not true.

735
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:55,070
Right, she is allergic to alcohol.

736
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,070
I forgot.

737
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:56,910
How about this?

738
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,190
I'll drink for her. Please don't mind.

739
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:59,230
You drink for her?

740
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,590
Sure.

741
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:02,560
Waiter.

742
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,310
Whisky?

743
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:08,990
Hakushu 12 years, thick mouth feel.

744
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,910
It's good wine.

745
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:22,710
You should drink more if it's good wine.

746
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:24,030
If you're drinking for her,

747
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:25,750
you should drink at least three glasses.

748
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:28,510
Of course.

749
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,190
A toast to you.

750
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:37,870
Okay.

751
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:43,960
You can drink.

752
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,830
I'll go get you some lemon water.

753
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:53,000
Mr. Sun,

754
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,430
you normally tell me to drink less.

755
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:56,310
What are you doing today?

756
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:58,140
I'm trying to prop you up in front of her.

757
00:37:58,350 --> 00:37:59,550
You drank for her.

758
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:01,310
So she owes you a favor.

759
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:02,830
She has to remember your kindness.

760
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,190
When it comes to knocking sense into newcomers,

761
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:06,440
you have to do both with might and grace.

762
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:08,110
Thank you.

763
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:17,070
I need to go entertain my client.

764
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,030
Help yourselves.

765
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:18,750
Go ahead.

766
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,590
A-Are you okay?

767
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:28,990
Are you okay?

768
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:32,190
Allergic to alcohol?

769
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:33,870
How could you make that up?

770
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:37,150
I'm really allergic.

771
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,230
For real.

772
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,190
When you enter priority client management department

773
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:43,910
you need to fill out a form on

774
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:45,350
your daily habits first.

775
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:46,390
You didn't upload it.

776
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:49,990
I thought that's not important.

777
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,190
So I went to work on that

778
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,470
medical translation first.

779
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:53,510
Don't think

780
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:55,180
this is just a formality.

781
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,430
Everyone has their own weakness.

782
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:58,910
I asked you to fill out the form

783
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:01,150
so that you and your colleagues

784
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:02,830
can cooperate better.

785
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:05,270
For example, Wang Qiang,

786
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:06,990
he is afraid of

787
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:08,000
animals with feathers.

788
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:09,550
So he doesn't have to attend

789
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:11,070
the poultry trade fair.

790
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:12,190
Chen Wen

791
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:13,790
has severe rhinitis.

792
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:14,990
She doesn't have to attend

793
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:16,150
events related to perfumes.

794
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:17,510
You understand now?

795
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:20,790
Sorry.

796
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,030
I'll fill it in when I get back.

797
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:26,630
Now you know

798
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,230
why you're not suitable for the Agricultural Product Trade Exhibition?

799
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:31,230
I don't.

800
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:35,910
When you attend it,

801
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,070
and someone drinks a toast to you,

802
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,750
you are going to say this too? That you're allergic?

803
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,990
Must one drink alcohol at the agricultural exhibition?

804
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:42,470
That doesn't make sense.

805
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:45,110
Wine culture is a bad culture.

806
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:46,380
Whether wine culture is a bad culture

807
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,470
or etiquette,

808
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:49,070
it depends on where the people are coming from

809
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:50,390
instead of wine itself.

810
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:51,670
Drinking a little

811
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:52,910
is a basic etiquette

812
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:54,390
of business cooperation.

813
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:55,710
It shouldn't be vilified.

814
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:57,110
So you mean

815
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,990
we have to accompany them and just laugh along?

816
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:00,310
I'm not talking about

817
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:01,540
drinking with you.

818
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:02,620
I'm telling you

819
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,470
how to deal with different people.

820
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,870
Working in the priority client management department

821
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,030
is not only to provide

822
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,870
our clients with excellent translation services,

823
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:12,350
but also the management of

824
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,990
relationships.

825
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:15,940
Today,

826
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,470
from the moment you entered this door,

827
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:19,110
you've been weaving through the crowd,

828
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,430
pleasing them

829
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:21,070
one by one.

830
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:21,910
Lower your voice.

831
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:23,000
If you want me

832
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,230
to become someone like you,

833
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:25,590
I'm sorry, I can't do it.

834
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:32,390
I should've known.

835
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:34,390
You're just like Professor Gao.

836
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:35,910
You are both blockheads.

837
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:38,710
Don't go.

838
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:40,950
Why can't I.

839
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:47,270
You just refused Mr. Sun's wine,

840
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:48,790
and now you are leaving early.

841
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,320
What will he think of you?

842
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:52,270
I can't control what he thinks.

843
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:54,190
He's our department's VIP.

844
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,310
Fine, if you want to leave,

845
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:01,390
you can.

846
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:03,190
Can I take it as

847
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:04,430
you are not suitable

848
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:06,150
to work in the priority client management department?

849
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,590
Okay, go ahead.

850
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:48,510
Have you done the CKA?

851
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:50,710
What about the aniography?

852
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:52,710
Send all the results

853
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:53,470
to my phone.

854
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:54,110
We can't delay any longer.

855
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:54,910
The surgery is tomorrow.

856
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:57,150
Okay, got it. That's it.

857
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,830
Sorry to bother you.

858
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:03,030
It's okay.

859
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:04,110
Here.

860
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:10,630
Isn't this wine nice?

861
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:12,880
I bought this winery.

862
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:13,630
Really?

863
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:14,910
No wonder it tastes different

864
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:15,950
from last time.

865
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:16,550
Yes.

866
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:18,960
Where is your colleague?

867
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:26,320
Where is she?

868
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,110
If you're cold,

869
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:35,360
you can go inside and warm yourself up.

870
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,830
The air conditioner is a little cold here.

871
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:38,630
It's okay.

872
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:40,030
I feel more comfortable

873
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:41,350
here.

874
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:43,510
I don't like that kind of occasion.

875
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,510
Right?

876
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:46,510
I don't like this either.

877
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:49,030
Also,

878
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:51,030
I'm allergic to alcohol.

879
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:52,190
I can't drink.

880
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:54,790
I'm really allergic.

881
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:56,030
I'm not lying.

882
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:56,510
No.

883
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:57,870
I'm allergic to alcohol too.

884
00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:00,230
And the more you say you are allergic to alcohol,

885
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:01,150
they'll get more hyped up.

886
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:02,270
This is bad culture.

887
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:04,070
I think so too.

888
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,510
We are of the same kind.

889
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:07,310
Hello.

890
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:09,550
My name is Chen Ji.

891
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:11,550
Chen written with the characters of "ear" and "east," and the Ji in "North Pole."

892
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,190
Huasheng's priority client management department,

893
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:15,190
Tan Shasha.

894
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:16,670
You're here.

895
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:19,230
Go to the lounge with me.

896
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:21,550
Take care.

897
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:22,950
Please excuse me.

898
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:54,540
Are you married?

899
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:55,710
Why?

900
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:57,830
The kid I met that day...

901
00:43:57,990 --> 00:43:59,470
That's my godson.

902
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:05,670
But Lin Xi misunderstood.

903
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:08,030
Xiao Yicheng.

904
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:10,270
Are things

905
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:13,110
still possible between Lin Xi and you?

906
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:16,870
Slowly.

907
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:28,550
You should ask her.

908
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:31,270
She despised me

909
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:32,750
for not getting into Matisse Institute of Technology back then.

910
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:33,910
She was disappointed in me.

911
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:35,990
She's not someone like that.

912
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:36,950
What kind of person is she then?

913
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,840
Only you know

914
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:43,060
why I broke up with him.

915
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,280
Promise me.

916
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:47,230
Otherwise, we can't be friends anymore.

917
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:56,750
Hello?

918
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,070
What?

919
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:02,710
Lin Xi is drunk?
