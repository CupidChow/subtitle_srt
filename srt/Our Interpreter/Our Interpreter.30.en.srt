to be together.

43
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,829
Because love can be one-sided,

44
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,510
but mutual love

45
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,110

00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:14,790
Come on.

195
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:15,480
Okay, sure.

196
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,550
Could you help us?

197
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,390
Why are you sitting here alone?

198
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,250
Why aren't you in the group photo?

199
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,590
This is his home field.

200
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,510
For me, once Yuyi is listed,

201
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,310
I can get off work temporarily.

202
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,930
I've been working overtime so frequently lately

203
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,550
that all I want now

204
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,030
is to go back to the office,

205
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,430
write the concluding email,

206
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,350
then go back home for a hot bath

207
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,590
and have a good sleep.

208
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,600
On such an important day,

209
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,120
all you think of is to write emails and sleep?

210
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,590
We've already rung the bell and listed the company,

211
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,590
so we can considered it celebrated.

212
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,350
What's wrong?

213
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,710
What's going on?

214
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,880
It's just as what you think.

215
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,630
Everyone, please quieten down.

216
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,150
Now,

217
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,430
let's have Mr. Xiao

218
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,670
to say a few words.

219
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:37,550
Welcome.

220
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,190
Thank you.

221
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,710
Actually, I've already said

222
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:46,710
what I wanted to say

223
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,510
at the stock exchange building.

224
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:49,430
In the future,

225
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,670
Yuyi is still

226
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,590
aiming to make translations

227
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:54,150
accessible to thousands of households

228
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,590
and build a wonderful world

229
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,600
by using artificial intelligence.

Of course,

232
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,930
the success of Yuyi's listing

233
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,110
is definitely not due to

234
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,510
the sole effort of Yuyi.

235
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,230
Here,

236
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,790
I would like to thank

I want to

thank a special person.

Say something to them.

266
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,990
I don't think I should.

267
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:08,070
Then, I'll go first.

You stopped me from finishing what I wanted to do.

What did you plan on doing?

313
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,310
Let me make this clear.

314
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:49,710
I don't want those cliche things.

315

And I don't want

316
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,910
things like drones

317
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,030

00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:53,790
I want none of that.

What flowers?

322
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,470
What are you thinking?

323
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,470
Nothing.

324
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,200
Good that you don't have those.

325
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,910

342
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,420

no drones,

there are more "yes" responses here

359
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,349
or in my heart?

360
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:09,790
Of course I hope

361
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:12,520
there are more "yes" responses in your heart.

362
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:16,150
But you have to think carefully.

363
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:18,109
In the future,

364
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:19,150
there may be a lot of "no"s

365

in our daily lives.

366
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:22,670
Are you confident

367
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:23,950
to get rid of all of the "no"s

368
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:24,910
with me?

369
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:34,810
[Marry me.]

370
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,920
No matter how many "no"s

371
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,520
there are in the future,

372
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:39,290
we can turn them into "yes" together.

373
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,070
Okay?

374
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,510

376

00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,560
You...

380

I spoiled you in advance.

Yes.

383
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:14,710
I was in a hurry

384
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:15,750
to check out the minority language.

385
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,630
After all, director Cheng Yao

386
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:18,030
can't make any mistakes.

387
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,150
You were also involved?

388
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:20,910
You should've married him

389
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:22,030
eight years ago.

390
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,910
Mr. Zhang,

391
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,750
I really had to work

392
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,310
overtime.

393
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,270
But I'm just in time, aren't I?

394
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,130
Since I'm here,

395
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,350
congratulations.

396
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,770
♫The path of turning back♫

397
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:39,310
Marry him.

398
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,640
♫It tests for yearning with reunion♫

399
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:47,110
♫How can time express the way I miss you♫

400
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,120
♫When the knot in my heart is removed♫

401
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,940
♫I smile and answer with my eyes♫

402
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:59,690
♫In a daze, time seems to shorten♫

403
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,260
♫My heart melts the distance♫

404
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:06,590
♫Love remembers♫

00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,200
♫Us from before♫

406
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:13,220

♫There will always be wind♫

410
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,150
Someone has said,

♫Blowing away my blues♫

412
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,070

♫I see your clear features again♫

414
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:27,110
don't encounter people who are too outstanding.

415
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,070
Otherwise,

416
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,350
you'll regret it for the rest of your life.

417
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:34,760
♫Like stars illuminating the night sky♫

418
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,260
But I'm glad

419
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:33,830
I met

420
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,160
the most amazing person

421
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,970
and had never let her go again.

422
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,280
♫The person who walked passed me♫

423
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:45,110

Yuyi's Xiao Yicheng

427

is here to report.

428
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,270

♫Our hearts are beating fast♫

430
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,230

♫A future with you♫

459
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,510
You're so happy today.

460
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:32,870
Yuyi got listed today.

461
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,230
Besides,

462
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,850
Xiao proposed successfully.

463
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,270
When I first met Xiao,

464
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,670
he immersed himself

465
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,590
in research

466
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,150
day and night,

467
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,740
all to avoid

468
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,540
the pain caused by a heartbreak.

469
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:55,990
Today,

470
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:58,310
he finally stood up again,

471
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:01,400
bravely took this step

472
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,870
and received happiness.

473
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,990
To witness all these thing,

474
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,270
I feel really happy for him.

475
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,310
He deserves it.

476
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,390
You too, Tong Xin.

477
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:19,400
You should take this step, too.

478
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,070
We have different problems.

479
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:27,950
Real life

480
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,610
is not a fairy tale, Cheng Yao.

481
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,430
Tong Xin.

482
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,830
You're not trapped

483
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,880
in the pain that Xiao Yicheng used to have.

484
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:42,090
You're trapped by your inner demons.

485
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:44,070
Even if everyone thinks

486
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,330
we should be together,

487
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:47,000
you still can't

488
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,600
get over your haunting past.

489
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,110
You think

490
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,390
it's because I can't get over it?

491
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:57,630
Isn't it?

492
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:35,630
I know you finished it long ago.

493
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,160
There's one piece left.

494
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:12,790
Okay.

495
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:15,830
It's finished.

496
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:17,740
Cheng Yao,

497
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,470
I hope you can keep your promise

498
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:21,030
and move out.

499
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,190
Wait.

500
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:27,440
You know

501
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,230
I can

502
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:28,670
push it over.

503
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:29,470
Cheng Yao.

504
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:30,670
We both know

505
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:31,640
what a ridiculous lie it was

506
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,430
when you stayed here.

507
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:35,630
Do you have to make me

508
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:36,550
make it clearer?

509
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:37,110
Let me

510
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,270
make it clear today.

511
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:42,630
Tong Xin.

512
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:44,790
I know I'm just a child

513
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:45,870
in your heart.

514
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,710
You think I'm very childish

515
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:47,830
and immature.

516
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,260
But I, Cheng Yao,

517
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,380
have never changed any decision

518
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,390
in my life.

519
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:54,670
I don't know

520
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:55,470
what difficulties we'll have

521
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,730
after we get together.

522
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:58,630
But I can

523
00:25:58,630 --> 00:25:59,710
face them with you.

524
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,590
Do you think

525
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:10,350
you can face everything

526
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,430
as long as you have courage?

527
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,110
Of course.

528
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,350
Let me ask you.

529
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,300
How should I choose

530
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,330
between you and Peter?

531
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:32,170
I signed a divorce agreement.

532
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,390
Once I get remarried,

533
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:35,120
I'll lose the custody of my son.

534
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:38,040
Is this reason good enough?

535
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,030
Cheng Yao.

536
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,270
I can't be with you.

537
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:46,990
It's impossible for me to marry you

538
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:48,230
and have a baby with you,

539
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:49,110
let alone form a complete family

540
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,230
with you.

541
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:53,230
If we get together,

542
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:54,870
it will be unfair

543
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,870
to both you and me.

544
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,950
Mom!

545
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,070
Mom!

546
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:22,630
I'm here.

547
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:24,790
Oh no. Something happened!

548
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:25,990
What happened?

549
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:27,630
What's wrong?

550
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:28,550
Come with me.

551
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:52,590
Hello?

552
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:56,270
My mom's sad about your leaving.

553
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:57,830
What do you want to do?

554
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:59,590
Don't tell me you're really not coming back.

555
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:00,430
Peter.

556
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,470
I'm a little busy now.

557
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:03,330
I'll get back to you when I'm done.

558
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:23,590
Coming.

559
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,790
Grandaunt.

560
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:29,550
I need your help again.

561
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,230
Come in.

562
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:54,150
Are you sure this is the right procedure?

563
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:54,750
Yes.

564
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:56,190
This is what I got

565
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:57,470
after doing research

566
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:58,470
on 5 wedding planning companies.

567
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,390
There are several types of plans.

568
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:02,630
Option 1, Chinese wedding.

569
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:03,750
Option 2, western wedding.

570
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,630
Option 3, destination wedding.

571
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,990
But no matter which one you choose,

572
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:08,920
the first step

573
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,030
is usually to choose the wedding dress

574
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,430
and take wedding photos.

575
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,630
These are some wedding dress shops

576
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:15,190
in Xiahai City that are famous online.

577
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:15,950
Take a look.

578
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,430
Is there any difference?

579
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,720
Mr. Xiao.

580
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:26,910
Although all these wedding dresses

581
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,150
are white,

582
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,800
the details are different.

583
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:30,990
I've listed each shop's

584
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,240
advantages and disadvantages.

585
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,070
Okay.

586
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,590
Summarize them

587
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,850
and send an email to me.

588
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:37,150
Okay.

589
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:41,350
Why are you laughing?

590
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:43,110
Mr. Xiao,

591
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:44,430
why are you arranging your wedding

592
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:45,350
the same way

593
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,680
you prepare a proposal?

594
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,430
My girlfriend is so busy.

595
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:50,720
Shouldn't I put more effort into it

596
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,750
and arrange it for her?

597
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,010
She doesn't have time.

598
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:53,950
Mr. Xiao,

599
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,150
you are so considerate.

600
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:57,210
You'll definitely be a good husband.

601
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:59,070
Stop.

602
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,400
Have you got everything ready for the afternoon meeting?

603
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,330
Don't worry. Everything is ready.

604
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:03,150
Okay.

605
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:03,880
I'm leaving.

606
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:04,590
Go.

[Maomao]

612
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:46,110
I've sent you

613
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,070
the wedding procedure.

614
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,670
Lin, please take a look.

615
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,590
What's this? So complicated!

616
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:08,510
Hello.

617
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:10,510
Mr. Xiao,

618
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:12,310
are you sure you didn't send me

619
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:13,510
a bidding procedure?

620
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:15,830
I knew you wouldn't want trouble.

621
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:16,550
I've already

622
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:18,630
ruled out 3 wedding dress shops for you.

623
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:20,430
This one is near you.

624
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:22,670
Director Lin, please make time

625
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:23,670
for it.

626
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:25,870
Alright.

627
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:27,430
I know you're considerate.

628
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:30,190
Okay, see you this afternoon.

629
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,070
I miss you.

630
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:32,390
I miss you too.

631
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:33,270
Bye.

632
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,550
I miss you.

633
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:39,340
I miss you too.

634
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:41,310
Icky.

635
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:43,750
What?

636
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:44,830
Are you jealous?

637
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:49,400
Shasha has completely stopped talking to me.

638
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,630
It's that serious?

639
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,310
I can't even find a chance

640
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,790
to talk to her.

641
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:01,330
Have you become stupid after you got together with her?

642
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:05,430
Maybe I can

643
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,760
create a chance for you.

644
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:10,680
Really?

645
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,590
I'm not sure.

646
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:12,720
Wait to hear from me.

647
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:19,370
Treat me to dinner when it's done.

648
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:38,070
The Consumer Products Expo

649
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,730
is an important annual event.

650
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:41,710
It's one of China's key measures

651
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,550
to open up to the whole world.

652
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,510
You must supervise the work yourself.

653
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,910
No mistakes are allowed.

654
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:47,950
Got it.

655
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,350
We've been a quality supplier

656
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:50,390
for the expo.

657
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:51,830
I believe we'll be

658
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,760
at the top of the organizer's list.

659
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:55,910
Things are different now.

660
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:57,070
By the way,

661
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,550
do you know

662
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:00,680
Yuyi is going to bid?

663
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:02,630
I heard about it.

664
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:05,720
Looks like the situation will change.

665
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:07,910
Understood.

666
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,030
We will use the best plan

667
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,150
to win this battle.

668
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,870
Okay, these are our strategies

669
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:22,790
to bid to be the supplier

670
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,390
for the Consumer Products Expo's

671
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:25,500
economic forum.

672
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:27,070
I hope we can

673
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,200
work well together.

674
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:32,630
Alright.

675
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:34,870
The Consumer Products Expo

676
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:36,200
is an important window for China

677
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,910
to show itself to the outside world.

678
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:38,990
It will gather

679
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:40,110
top entrepreneurs

680
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:41,150
and economists.

681
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:43,670
If we become the translation supplier for the forum,

682
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:44,950
we will not only

683
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:46,790
be a cultural and trade bridge

684
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:48,780
but also show the power of Yuyi 3.0

685
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:51,040
to transform the translation industry.

686
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:52,470
So we must

687
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,110
win the bid.

688
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:56,430
Okay. Don't worry, Mr. Xiao.

689
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:58,270
Alright.

690
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,430
Keep your promise.

691
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:01,150
Dismissed.

692
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:11,190
Anything else?

693
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:25,790
What is it?

694
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:29,969
I don't know if I should say it.

695
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,350
Then don't.

696
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:36,469
I think you know

697
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:37,670
who won the bid

698
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:38,870
in the past, right?

699
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:43,710
Considering your relationship

700
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:44,909
with Lin Xi,

701
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:46,230
I think I should

702
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:48,190
remind you beforehand.

703
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:49,230
Don't worry.

704
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,630
Lin Xi and I have agreed

705
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,190
to separate business from private life.

706
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,550
The Consumer Products Expo

707
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,310
is very important for Yuyi.

708
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:58,650
What you're worried about won't happen.

709
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:14,830
Hello.

710
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:21,310
Yuyi's also going to bid?

711
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:24,990
Okay, got it.

712
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,710
You want to join the preparation

713
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:33,710
for the Consumer Products Expo bid?

714
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:36,800
I'm in Team 3 of the translation department.

715
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,440
I shouldn't interfere

716
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,100
with the priority client management department's work.

717
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,270
But I participated in the bid preparation in the past.

718
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:41,600
I have some experience.

719
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:42,990
I'm willing to do whatever I can

720
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:43,660
to help our company

721
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,710
win the bid again.

722
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:46,590
I've assigned the task

723
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:49,110
to Director Lu.

724
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:51,700
You just accepted Mr. Xiao's proposal.

725
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,670
You should enjoy

726
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:53,910
some private time with him.

727
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,430
Don't worry about

728
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,990
the bid this time.

729
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:58,710
But...

730
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:02,110
Ask Director Lu

731
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,240
to come to my office.

732
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:06,030
If there's nothing else,

733
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,030
you can leave.

734
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:33,030
This is the book on cardiovascular disease

735
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,350
you lent me last time.

736
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:35,390
Here you are.

737
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:36,710
Put it there.

738
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,550
What's wrong, Princess Xixi?

739
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:43,630
It's disrespectful.

740
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:50,540
Actually, I never thought

741
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:53,310
Mr. Zhang would be wary of me one day.

742
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:59,510
It's about the Consumer Products Expo.

743
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:03,110
I heard from Director Lu

744
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:04,110
that Xiao Yicheng's Yuyi

745
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:05,240
is also going to bid.

746
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:06,430
However,

747
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:08,390
this is indeed to avoid conflicts of interest.

748
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:09,990
Don't blame Mr. Zhang.

749
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:13,710
I know.

750
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:15,150
But

751
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,020
when it really happened to me...

752
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:20,470
It's okay.

753
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:21,670
I just need some time

754
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:22,590
to digest it.

755
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:25,230
If you need me to keep you company,

756
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,360
I'll always be here.

757
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,270
You've grown up.

758
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:35,760
You're just in time.

759
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:37,990
I need you.

760
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,230
Xiao Yicheng asked me

761
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,390
to go to the wedding dress shop this afternoon.

762
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:42,310
Go with me.

763
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,140
Okay.

764
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,710
I thought getting married

765
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:48,540
just involved getting registered

766
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,870
and having dinner

767
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:50,800
with my friends.

768
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:53,070
I didn't expect it to be so complicated.

769
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,390
Haven't you ever pictured

770
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,470
yourself

771
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,110
wearing a wedding dress,

772
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,670
walking into the hall

773
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,390
with your arm through your dad's,

774
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:01,870
and seeing the person in front of you

775
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:03,270
reach out his hand to you?

776
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,790
It's a plot in fairy tales.

777
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:08,910
For working people like us,

778
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,430
time is money,

779
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:11,880
and efficiency is life.

780
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,510
I'm getting married with Xiao Yicheng.

781
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:15,270
I'm not shooting a TV drama with him.

782
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:16,710
Okay, fine.

783
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:17,870
I'll go pack up.

784
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:18,930
I'll take your car.

785
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:29,150
Done.

786
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,870
Wei, you owe me a meal.

787
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,310
Hello.

788
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:21,350
Lin Xi.

789
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:23,390
Mr. Zhang asked you to send me the information

790
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:25,350
about our previous cooperation with the Consumer Products Expo.

791
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:26,550
Okay, got it.

792
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:29,270
There are some details

793
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:30,630
I want to discuss with you.

794
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:33,760
Is it convenient for you to have a conference call at 8 PM?

795
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:35,670
Okay.

796
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:47,950
So beautiful.

797
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,230
Lin Xi.

798
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,910
This wedding dress is so beautiful.

799
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:27,270
You'll look good in it.

800
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:32,750
Not bad.

801
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,030
Shasha.

802
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:42,430
Why are you here?

803
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:44,030
Why are you here?

804
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:47,630
I'm the best man.

805
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:55,110
I just remembered I have something to do.

806
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:55,910
I have to go.

807
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:57,710
What is it?

808
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:58,910
How come I don't know?

809
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:01,670
Something happened at home.

810
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:02,630
Alright.

811
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,270
There's only 1 task

812
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:06,550
for you today.

813
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:07,430
You're the best man

814
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:08,110
and the bridesmaid.

815
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:09,570
Try on your dress and suit.

816
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:15,070
Hello, Ms. Lin.

817
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:15,750
Mr. Xiao

818
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:16,750
has chosen

819
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:17,910
some wedding dresses

820
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:19,320
and styles for you.

821
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,070
You can take a look

822
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:21,710
and see if there's anything else you want.

823
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:22,550
So many.

824
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:27,510
Isn't this the one we just saw?

825
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:28,470
Yes.

826
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:29,430
This is

827
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:30,500
our hand-made wedding dress.

828
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,190
There's only 1 dress in each style.

829
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,030
We hope every couple

830
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:35,270
can be unique.

831
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:36,790
Mr. Xiao

832
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:38,510
specially prepared this for you.

833
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:40,030
Lin Xi.

834
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,760
Xiao Yicheng is so thoughtful.

835
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:44,470
Did you hear that?

836
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:45,530
She likes this one.

837
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:50,150
Lin Xi, I'll leave if you say that again.

838
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:53,630
Why hasn't Xiao Yicheng arrived yet?

839
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:55,630
I'll call him and ask him to hurry up.

840
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,830
Help them

841
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:58,070
try on their dress and suit.

842
00:41:58,070 --> 00:41:59,130
-Okay.
-Thank you.

843
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:02,400
Sir, Miss, please come with me

844
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,460
and take a look at your dress and suit.

845
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:12,280
This way, please.

846
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:13,390
Okay.

847
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:22,590
This way,

848
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:24,020
we can reduce

849
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:26,790
the cost to install the cell tower

850
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:28,390
and reduce

851
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:30,120
the workers' safety problems.

852
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:32,590
Your fast adjustment system

853
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:33,750
is really helpful.

854
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:35,190
It expanded the coverage

855
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:35,830
and capacity.

856
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:37,430
And those who are not technicians

857
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:38,960
can also operate it easily.

858
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:40,390
Thank you.

859
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:41,860
-Thank you. -Okay.

860
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:42,510
It's okay.

861
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:45,230
Mr. Xiao,

862
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:47,750
why did you give this signal equipment

863
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:49,390
to the organizing committee for free?

864
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:50,790
We suffered a great loss.

865
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:54,990
When we do business,

866
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:56,830
we should take the long view.

867
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:59,530
We'll know whether we suffered a loss or not.

868
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:00,750
Mr. Xiao from Yuyi?

869
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:01,550
Yes.

870
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,190
Hold this for me.

871
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:13,710
Okay.

872
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:20,470
Xixi.

873
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:22,520
How long before you arrive?

874
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,430
About 40 minutes.

875
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:28,710
Hurry up.

876
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:30,070
I really

877
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:31,670
can't handle the two of them.

878
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:33,750
Mr. Xiao,

879
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:35,190
the Internet engineer of the Consumer Products Expo

880
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:35,990
wants to talk to you.

881
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:37,030
Is it okay?

882
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:39,320
Okay. I'll be right there.

883
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:44,470
You're working on the Consumer Products Expo bid?

884
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:46,070
I'll go there right away.
