00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,120
You need warmth more than anyone else.

195
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,550
So, give me a chance

196
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,910
to give you warmth.

197
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,390

200
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:25,830
Did you bake cakes?

201
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,470
Dad, it's me.

202
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:30,910
I'm baking

203
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,910
your favorite scones.

204
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:36,480
You just arrived

205
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,910
and tidied up.

206
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,430
Why don't you take a rest?

207
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,750
I'm jet-lagged.

If I sleep too much during the day,

209
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,770
I'm afraid I can't sleep tonight.

210
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,670
You work out every day?

211
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,470

By the way,

Shujun specially asked me

215
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,230
to bring

216
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:01,230
these rare books to you.

217

How is he?

222
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,990
Shujun became a tenured professor, right?

223
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,230
He's now a distinguished professor.

224
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,270
You should always remind him

225
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,230
that arrogant and complacent people are prone to disaster,

226
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:25,270

Dad, don't worry.

228

I know you don't like crowds.

235
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,350
So,

236
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:40,550
I specifically selected some friends.

237
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,140
Also,

238
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,090

the house of Shujun's teacher.

Dad, do you think it's appropriate?

00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:19,150
Okay.

00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,230

00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,950
Let's discuss it in a few days.

254
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,430
I'll go upstairs and pack up.

255

259
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,470
You can arrange it.

260
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,230
Professor Gao.

261
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:54,310
Xixi's dad said before

262
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,350
that he would arrange your birthday party.

263

call him

265
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,390
and ask him

266
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,380
why he hasn't made a move?

267
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,990
What's there to ask?

268
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:05,590
Xixi's dad

269
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,670
is always responsible.

270
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:09,590
The thing he promised

271
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:10,870
should be...

272
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,920
Maybe someone doesn't want him to do it.

273
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:20,160
Are you talking about Wenli?

274
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:24,390
I don't think I should beg them

275
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,190
to throw a birthday party for me.

276
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,870
All right.

277
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,390
l'm almost there.

278
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,070
How many people can there be?

279
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,910
At most 70 or 80 people.

280
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:51,270
About 70 or 80 people?

281
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:51,630
Yes.

282
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,270
OK.

283
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,070
The style here

284
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,680
is a Nordic style.

285
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,830
The lights are also that style.

286
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:57,540
Good. Good.

287
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,190
It's quite fashionable and special.

288
00:18:59,190 --> 00:18:59,750
Not bad.

289
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,510
Lin.

290
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,070
You're here.

291
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:02,960
You two talk.

292
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:03,910
Thank you.

00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,470
Look.

294
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,670
How is the hall?

295
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,070
Is it magnificent enough?

296
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,550
I've thought about it.

297
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,830
I'll hire a symphony orchestra

298
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:11,750
to come.

299
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,110
Do you think

300
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,160
they should play Ode to Joy

301
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,220
or May We All Blessed with Longevity?

302
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:18,340
Look at this.

00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:18,950
Here.

304
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:20,590
Take a look.

305
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,910
How is this Tai Chi stone?

306
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,190
I asked my friend from the Jieyang Jade Factory

307
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,510
to help me book an uncut stone

308
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,240
a year in advance.

309
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,030
This stone was made

310
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,270
by the best

311
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,270
local craftsman.

312
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,990
Lin, do you remember

313
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:36,150
what I told you before?

314
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,910
Don't be extravagant. Don't be high-profile.

315
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:38,390
Don't...

316
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:38,960
Make decisions on my own.

317
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,090
You still remember?

318
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:41,790
Your grandpa

319
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:42,710
doesn't like

320
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:43,910
crowds

321
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,480
and famous brands.

322
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,110
This arrangement...

323
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:47,740
Listen.

324
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,550
I used my brain a lot.

325
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,910
Yes. You put your mind on it

326
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:53,050
and spent a lot of money.

327
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:54,790
Money is not a problem.

328
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,150
What's the main thing?

329
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,550
The main thing is,

330
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,390
will your grandpa like my arrangement?

331
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:00,720
This is very important.

332
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:02,830
I also want to know.

333
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:05,510
Where do you think

334
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,910
this uncut stone

335
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:07,870
should be placed?

336
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:08,630
Find a place.

337
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,110
It must be in the middle.

338
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:10,510
In the middle, right?

339
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,350
Grandpa will see it as soon as he comes in.

340
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,950
I also think it's better to put it in the middle.

341
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,250
Auntie Wang, are you cooking?

342
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,740
No.

343
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,060
You can't cut luffa like this.

344
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,550
You have to

345
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,190
peel it first.

346
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,270
Then cut it into pieces.

347
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:29,950
Got it?

348
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,870
Okay, I got it.

349
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:32,750
Let me do it.

350
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,870
Don't touch it.

351
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:38,120
Has Xixi's family been here recently?

352
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,910
They came here a few days ago.

353
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,390
Something went wrong

354
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:43,680
with Xixi's company.

355
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,110
Professor Gao invited some friends

356
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,230
to help her.

357
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,310
So Xixi

358
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:49,440
bought something and brought it here.

359
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,260
Dad

360
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,100
seems to be indifferent

361
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,230
to their family.

362
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:55,950
But in his heart,

363
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,110
he loves his family.

364
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,670
Exactly.

365
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,830
They're family after all.

366
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,310
Auntie Wang.

367
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:07,950
What delicious food did you cook today?

368
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,230
Mommy!

369
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,270
When did you come back?

370
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,310
This morning.

371
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,910
Are you used to living at your grandpa's house?

372
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,430
I brought your favorite pillow

373
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:19,630
back.

374
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:20,670
Really?

375
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,550
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

376
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,070
I could pick you up at the airport.

377
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,110
No need.

378
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:27,030
Let's talk outside.

379
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:30,870
Come.

380
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:35,830
How's your work at Huasheng?

381
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,060
I heard that you're working in Lin Xi's department.

382
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,110
Do you get along well with your colleagues?

383
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,390
Pretty good.

384
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,140
What about your cousin?

385
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,630
Lin Xi? What's wrong?

386
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:51,190
She didn't deliberately make things difficult for you?

387
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:53,070
How is that possible?

388
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,990
On the contrary, I learnt a lot

389
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,350
from her.

390
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,510
Really?

391
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,680
Mommy, sit down.

392
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,350
Shasha.

393
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:05,630
In the next two days,

394
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:07,470
help me write invitations

395
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:11,550
according to the list of people who're coming to your grandpa's party.

396
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:13,350
Grandpa has confirmed it?

397
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,910
Just write

398
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:15,830
according to my list.

399
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,780
I'll check with your grandpa.

400
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,670
Will Aunt and her family

401
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:22,870
come?

402
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:27,950
Don't worry.

403
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,430
I'll handle it.

404
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,160
I... I'm used to it.

405
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,430
I used to finish eating in five minutes

406
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:56,750
in the army.

407
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,990
Shasha, you eat first.

408
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,310
I have class in the gym.

409
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:21,790
Do you want to come with me?

410
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,070
It's downstairs.

411
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,470
Can I?

412
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:28,910
Give me five minutes.

413
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,630
Slow down.

414
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:39,320
♫An orange breeze blows through the dawn♫

415
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:43,260

When I went to the gym abroad,

424
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:02,670
♫Close your eyes and hear the world breathing♫

425
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,230
I saw them playing it.

426
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,350
I haven't tried it myself.

427
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,350
Let me teach you.

428
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:03,390
This.

429
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:05,910

♫Turned around and it's still you♫

433

Slowly.

458
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,790
You spread the elbow too wide.

459
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:04,230
Put it back a little.

460
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,030
Put it down naturally.

461
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,090
Breathe out again.

462
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:08,270
Breathe in slowly.

463
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,790
Okay. Stop.

464
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:11,950
Okay. Take a break.

465
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:16,050
Practice by yourself for a while.

466
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,510
You want to try it?

467
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:20,750
I can teach you.

468
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,710
Here. Hold on to the handles.

469
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:23,910
Chin down.

470
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,640
Come on. Push your hands up.

471
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,590
Breathe out. Go up. Go.

472
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:28,430
Slow down.

473
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:30,390
Open your knuckles.

474
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:32,470
Push up.

475
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,390
You don't exercise much, do you?

476
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:36,510
Come on, breathe in.

477
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,350
Open it to both sides.

478
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,410
Put it down slowly.

479
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:40,540
Put it down.

480
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,240
Don't be stiff.

481
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,030
-Relax.
-It's okay.

482
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:43,720
I can teach her

483
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,510
what she doesn't know.

484
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,990
Put it down first.

485
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:47,050
Put it down slowly.

486
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:48,750
Bro.

487
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:51,190
First come, first served.

488
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:53,120
Can't you see I'm teaching her?

489
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:56,200
Ask her. Who does she want to teach her?

490
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:58,590
How much discount do you give her?

491
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,680
I'll give you another discount

492
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,630
on his discount.

493
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,430
You think...

494
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,230
How about this?

495
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,470
The hugest discount in our gym

496
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:05,790
is 20% off.

497
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:06,990
I'll give you 30% off.

498
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,310
What do you think?

499
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:12,190
Tian, 30% off.

500
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:14,560
It's cheaper than your VIP black card.

501
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:15,150
No.

502
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:17,100
You know each other?

503
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:21,070
He's my boyfriend.

504
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:22,630
Excuse me.

505
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:23,660
No.

506
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,830
Sir, the discount you said...

507
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:25,670
That...

508
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:27,710
What are you doing?

509
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:29,390
Do you want him to teach you

510
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:30,850
or do you think it's cheap?

511
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:35,110
Are you jealous?

512
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:38,150
Of course not.

513
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,390
You're jealous.

514
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:40,870
No.

515
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:41,550
Yes.

516
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,670
Sit down. Let me...

517
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:43,830
You're jealous.

518
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:44,470
No.

519
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,270
Sit down. I'll teach you.

520
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:50,110
Tell me you're jealous.

521
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:50,790
No.

522
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:52,640
You don't admit it.

523
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:54,270
I can't lift it up.

524
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,340
Yes, you...

525
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:07,990
You work so hard.

526
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:10,630
It's a family thing.

527
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,750
I want to do it

528
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:13,880
during lunch break.

529
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:18,030
I guess they're sore because of the practice.

530
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:19,230
Let me help you write.

531
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:24,630
I was writing "please open it".

532
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:26,230
Check the traditional Chinese characters

533
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:27,430
of these words for me.

534
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:29,070
Was I wrong?

535
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:32,110
Doesn't the birthday party start

536
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:32,910
in several months?

537
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:34,640
Why are you preparing so early?

538
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,270
Mommy takes it very seriously.

539
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,330
She specially flew back from abroad.

540
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,030
And Grandpa's friends

541
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,310
are all experts and scholars.

542
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,750
Mommy said we should prepare early

543
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,610
so that they can arrange the time.

544
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,070
No, here.

545
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:57,070
Hello.

546
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:57,990
Hello, Wei Tian.

547
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:59,880
Have you proofread the documents

548
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,080
Chen Wen translated?

549
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,400
I've already uploaded it.

550
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,470
But the internet in the office

551
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,430
is a little bad today.

552
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:04,950
OK.

553
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:06,590
You went to exercise?

554
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:08,150
Yes, I just finished.

555
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:10,230
I'm helping Shasha writing invitations.

556
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,230
What invitation?

557
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,950
Your grandpa's birthday party.

558
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:15,550
Shasha's mother is throwing a birthday party.

559
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:34,470
Xixi.

560
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:35,990
Xixi.

561
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,510
Dad, why are you here?

562
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,430
I'm going to the hotel to pay the balance.

563
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:41,510
Come with me.

564
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,190
Help me check it again.

565
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:44,630
See if there's anything inappropriate.

566
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:45,350
After that,

567
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,430
we'll go to your grandpa's house

568
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:47,630
and tell him about it.

569
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:49,310
No need.

570
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:51,520
Go straight to Professor Gao's house.

571
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:54,190
Okay.

572
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:07,670
Xixi.

573
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:09,550
Your mom

574
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:11,270
can't attend

575
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:13,070
your grandpa's birthday party.

576
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,330
I'm not surprised.

577
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:19,630
I'm afraid your grandpa will be disappointed.

578
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,750
Xixi, I want to

579
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:27,070
prevent your grandpa

580
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:27,920
from knowing our plan

581
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,790
so soon.

582
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:31,110
We can give him a surprise.

583
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:36,630
Look.

584
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:39,470
Besides the symphony orchestra,

585
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:42,270
I also want to hire some magicians,

586
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,060
crosstalk actors,

587
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,830
and burlesque performers

588
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:46,830
to entertain us.

589
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:48,230
But

590
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:49,470
I'm afraid your grandpa

591
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:50,730
will think it's noisy.

592
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,030
When you see him later,

593
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,670
help me ask him about it.

594
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:57,630
Your grandpa has diabetes.

595
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:59,150
This time I prepared

596
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:00,910
a low-sugar cake for him.

597
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:02,810
He should be able to eat it.

598
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:05,620
By the way, remember to remind me

599
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:06,830
that your grandpa's

600
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:07,750
longevity noodles

601
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:08,680
must be whole.

602
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,910
They can't be broken.

603
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:13,270
Dad.

604
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,300
Why are you so nice to him?

605
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,490
Without your grandpa,

606
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,600
I wouldn't have met your mom

607
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:25,910
and had you.

608
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:48,710
Dad.

609
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:50,030
Look.

610
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,730
Who else do you want to add?

611
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:53,870
What's the hurry?

612
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:55,270
Just wait.

613
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:57,190
What are you waiting for?

614
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,630
Nothing. There's no hurry.

615
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,110
Actually,

616
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:08,070
Xixi's dad said before

617
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:11,130
that he would throw a birthday party for Professor Gao.

618
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:14,270
Dad, are you waiting for Lin Dayong?

619
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:20,630
Not to mention whether Lin Dayong

620
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:21,710
will do it or not,

621
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:22,750
he looks

622
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,390
like a nouveau riche.

623
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:26,590
Is it appropriate to let him

624
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:28,050
receive your old friends?

625
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:31,710
You two should communicate.

626
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,670
Don't do same things

627
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:34,750
and make mistakes.

628
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:47,310
Professor Gao.

629
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:48,630
You're here.

630
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:50,790
Gao Ling, you came back from abroad?

631
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,150
You come back

632
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:53,670
to attend Professor Gao's birthday party, right?

633
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:54,910
I specially came back

634
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:57,070
to throw a birthday party for Dad.

635
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,060
Professor Gao.

636
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:02,910
Why didn't you let my dad

637
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:04,440
throw your birthday party?

638
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,920
Didn't you promise?

639
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,310
Did I say that?

640
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,790
I just told you to wait.

641
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:12,320
Dad, say something.

642
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:13,590
I...

643
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:16,310
I...

644
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:18,110
My dad has booked a hotel.

645
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,430
He did a lot

646
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:20,470
and arranged everything.

647
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,830
If you don't want him to do it,

648
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:22,950
why didn't you tell him earlier?

649
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:23,510
Xixi.

650
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:26,550
What's with the attitude?

651
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:28,310
Xi.

652
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:30,430
I just came back from abroad.

653
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:31,390
Before this,

654
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:33,070
I didn't know your father was throwing

655
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,030
a party.

656
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:36,590
Maybe there's some misunderstanding.

657
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:39,300
But your attitude isn't right.

658
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:42,390
After all, we're your elders.

659
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,470
Professor Gao. Gao Ling.

660
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:46,350
Look.

661
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,570
Actually, I've arranged everything.

662
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:50,910
Look, this is the best

663
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:52,190
affordable luxury hotel in Xiahai City.

664
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:54,350
This is the biggest banquet hall of the hotel.

665
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,810
It faces the sea directly.

666
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:56,870
Lin Dayong.

667
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,110
I think Dad's birthday party

668
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,870
should be thrown by her daughter.

669
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:04,300
You two don't have to bother.

670
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,230
My mom

671
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:06,750
is also Professor Gao's daughter.

672
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:07,430
Why can't my family

673
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:08,670
throw it?

674
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:11,790
Xi.

675
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,150
Your grandpa's birthday party

676
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:15,550
is a happy event.

677
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:17,950
Let's not

678
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:19,830
mention some things, okay?

679
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:22,750
I don't understand, Aunt.

680
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,350
Why does the mention of my mom

681
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,950
make you unhappy?

682
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:36,350
Xi, your aunt

683
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,950
may have a better plan.

684
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:38,870
Gao Ling.

685
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,880
Go ahead and arrange it.

686
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:42,590
If you need any help,

687
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:43,630
just let me know.

688
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:44,830
Lin Dayong.

689
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,670
Don't you understand?

690
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:47,550
No matter

691
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,430
how nice you're to them,

692
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:49,350
they still

693
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,280
look down on you.

694
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:52,750
Xi, how could you say that?

695
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:55,590
Have we ever neglected Lin Dayong

696
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:56,950
when he came here?

697
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:58,300
No, you haven't.

698
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:00,470
You're polite on the surface.

699
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:01,590
We all know

700
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:02,850
what you're thinking.

701
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:05,570
In the past, you didn't accept my dad.

702
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:06,590
Now my dad

703
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:07,450
has made my mom and I

704
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:08,030
live a good life

705
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,150
through his own efforts.

706
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,590
You still look down on him.

707
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,110
Our Gao family has never

708
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,389
looked down on anyone.

709
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:15,150
We respect everyone

710
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,469
who works hard.

711
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,699
Do you really know how to respect people?

712
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,310
I didn't know it when I was young.

713
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,510
Now I understand.

714
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,510
That's prejudice.

715
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:26,750
Prejudice?

716
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:27,350
Yes.

717
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:29,230
My dad isn't as well educated

718
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,510
as you.

719
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:32,190
But he relied on his own hands

720
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,000
to make my mom and I

721
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,469
live the life we have now.

722
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,710
So, you can only talk about

723
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,830
his identity.

724
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:39,550
But in my eyes,

725
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:40,989
you're the ones

726
00:34:40,989 --> 00:34:42,350
who should be looked down on.

727
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:43,830
Xixi! How could you say that?

728
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:44,760
Apologize now.

729
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,400
I won't apologize.

730
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,510
Am I wrong?

731
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,550
Dayong, look at her.

732
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:50,150
Is she like Wenli?

733
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,590
Is she like her mom?

734
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,550
Dad, don't be angry.

735
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,510
Sit down.

736
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,090
Professor Gao.

737
00:34:58,350 --> 00:34:59,550
It's my fault.

738
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,960
I didn't educate my daughter well.

739
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,950
I misunderstood you.

740
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:06,700
Anyway,

741
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,020
I'm sorry.

742
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:17,710
Rotten wood cannot be carved;

743
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:21,200
a wall of dirty earth will not receive the trowel.

744
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:26,470
Rotten wood cannot be carved;

745
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:29,030
a wall of dirty earth will not receive the trowel.

746
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:30,360
Don't think I don't understand.

747
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,470
Mom taught me.

748
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:32,910
These are swear words.

749
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:33,830
I gave you gifts.

750
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:34,910
Why did you scold me?

751
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:35,910
You're all bad guys.

752
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:36,590
-I hate you!
-Xixi.

753
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:37,230
Look.

754
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,710
She's more and more like Wenli,

755
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:39,510
her mom.

756
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:41,870
Say it again.

757
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,910
I'm done talking.

758
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,590
Take care.

759
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:57,470
That sounds familiar.

760
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,930
Twenty years have passed.

761
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:02,910
Nothing has changed.

762
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,100
Xixi.

763
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:08,450
Dad, I'll go and check.

764
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:09,710
Xixi.

765
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:13,510
Dad, don't be angry.

766
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,990
Did I say that to her before?

767
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:45,230
Rotten wood cannot be carved;

768
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:48,480
a wall of dirty earth will not receive the trowel.

769
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:15,550
Mr. Xiao, have you seen Xi?

770
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:16,950
We can't reach her.

771
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:19,030
Where did she go?

772
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,390
I don't know.

773
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:23,400
Hello.

774
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:25,310
The subscriber you dialed is power off.

775
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:26,110
Sorry.

776
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:32,550
Hello.

777
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,070
The subscriber you dialed is...

778
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:35,070
Have you contacted the others?

779
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:36,000
Yes.

780
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,590
No one knows where she went.

781
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:39,430
She went back to Huasheng?

782
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:41,070
I asked. She didn't go back.

783
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,550
Did something happen?

784
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,790
When Xi had a surgery for appendicitis,

785
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:47,230
she was still working.

786
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:48,470
It's impossible for her...

787
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:49,270
Mr. Xiao.

788
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:50,110
Mr. Xiao.

789
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:52,430
Mr. Xiao.

790
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,030
Yicheng.

791
00:37:59,150 --> 00:37:59,990
Yicheng.

792
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:01,910
We have to shoot later.

793
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,230
Yicheng!

794
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:15,750
[Calling Lin Xi]

795
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:16,830
Hello.

796
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:18,630
The subscriber you dialed is power off.

797
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,430
Sorry.

798
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:08,950
I knew you're here.

799
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,510
Why did you come?

800
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:21,090
Did you have a quarrel?

801
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:24,510
No.

802
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:29,470
When you quarreled with me before,

803
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:32,330
you liked to come to the beach for some fresh air.

804
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:34,790
I didn't have a quarrel.

805
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:37,710
Okay.

806
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:39,830
Whatever you say.

807
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:51,670
I don't need to drown my sorrows.

808
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,790
Drinking doesn't solve any problems.

809
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:57,910
The pain is still there.

810
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,590
The trouble is still there.

811
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:01,830
But drinking

812
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:03,190
can help you

813
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:04,320
sleep well tonight.

814
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:05,400
Try it.

815
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:09,350
Right.

816
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:25,230
It's strong and cheap,

817
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:27,310
just like me.

818
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:31,720
Lin Xi.

819
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:34,900
I admit

820
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,360
that you have a bad temper.

821
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,070
But I want to tell you

822
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:40,280
that you're priceless.

823
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:45,910
You don't need to comfort me.

824
00:40:59,030 --> 00:40:59,950
Xiao Yicheng.

825
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:02,470
Do you know Ru ware?

826
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:05,590
The head of the Five Great Official Kilns.

827
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:08,920
It's like jade, but it's not jade. It's gentle and gorgeous.

828
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:10,550
Yes.

829
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,470
But there're some porcelain

830
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:17,510
that is also sky blue.

831
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:21,590
It's evenly colored. The color is perfect.

832
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,070
But because

833
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:25,710
it's not put

834
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:26,950
in the Ru kiln,

835
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,030
no matter how good it is,

836
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:32,390
it's just ordinary porcelain.

837
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:36,630
It's useless no matter how hard you try.

838
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:42,390
Little tiger. Little tiger.

839
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:48,360
Run so fast. Run so fast.

840
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:51,630
Where are you going?

841
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:53,870
Where are you going?

842
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:57,950
Tell me now. Tell me now.

843
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:59,710
How is it?

844
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:01,070
Shasha.

845
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:03,070
You're about the same age as your cousin.

846
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:04,710
Make a comment.

847
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:07,390
Your pronunciation isn't correct.

848
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:09,830
Especially the voiceless consonants

849
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,830
"tr" and "ts".

850
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:13,470
And you speak English

851
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:15,070
with an accent.

852
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:18,030
It sounds weird.

853
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,510
This is...

854
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:25,910
You don't even know

855
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:27,190
Harry Potter?

856
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:29,830
Professor Gao.

857
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:31,190
Xixi also brought you a gift

858
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:33,510
this time.

859
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:34,800
Grandpa, look.

860
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:39,270
What's wrong?

861
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,320
Were you scared?

862
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:41,590
What's this?

863
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:44,070
What crap is it?

864
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:47,270
Why did you throw my gift away?

865
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:48,350
This is a gift for Grandpa.

866
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:49,790
How dare you hit me?

867
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:50,350
What are you doing?

868
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:51,310
You have no manners.

869
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:52,310
Enough.

870
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:19,470
Was it

871
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:22,350
because Professor Gao

872
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:23,910
grew flowers and vegetables at home

873
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:25,570
that you gave him earthworms?

874
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:30,870
Look.

875
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:33,070
Even an outsider like you

876
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:34,310
can see that.

877
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:35,990
What about them?

878
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:39,750
Lin Xi.

879
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:41,430
I know you admire him

880
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:44,340
and want his recognition.

881
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:47,990
I used to.

882
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:49,350
You still do.

883
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:01,390
Actually, when I was a kid...

884
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:03,240
When I was a kid,

885
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,430
every time I went to Grandpa's house,

886
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:05,590
I was very happy.

887
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:07,710
I was looking forward

888
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:09,110
to going to his house.

889
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:12,790
I thought as long as

890
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:14,950
I was good enough,

891
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:18,190
even though I had to try harder,

892
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:24,070
he would accept me

893
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:26,670
and like me

894
00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:30,070
as much as he liked Shasha.

895
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:39,070
But now I've figured it out.

896
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:46,990
No matter how hard I try,

897
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,870
even though

898
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:53,550
I'm one of the top ten translators of the year

899
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:54,990
or

900
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:59,220
the director of Huasheng's priority client management department,

901
00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:01,390
in their eyes,

902
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:02,790
I'm still the kid

903
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:05,110
who spoke English with an accent.

904
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:12,110
Xiao Yicheng.

905
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:16,360
You may never

906
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,750
understand

907
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:21,630
why I'm so sad.

908
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:28,990
I don't understand

909
00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:30,870
why even though I tried my best,

910
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:33,950
I'm still at some people's starting point.

911
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:34,990
No.

912
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:36,350
Lin Xi.

913
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:39,910
Do you know

914
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:41,230
that many people now think of you

915
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:41,800
as their role model?

916
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:42,790
No.

917
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:45,190
Do you know

918
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:46,670
I hate

919
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:47,350
talented people

920
00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:48,310
like you?

921
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:51,790
Just because you're talented,

922
00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:53,310
you can get everything

923
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:54,630
easily.

924
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:57,070
So you never

925
00:45:57,070 --> 00:45:58,670
cherished your talent.

926
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:00,470
If you want to,

927
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:02,150
you can throw your talent

928
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:04,030
aside.

929
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:05,320
If you want to,

930
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,110
you can pick it up

931
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:07,750
at any time.

932
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:08,750
You just need to

933
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:10,070
bend down

934
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,550
and pick it up.

00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:00,510
Yes.

958
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:02,870
You're right.

959
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:04,270
♫There will always be wind♫

960
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:06,510
Tan Shasha, I, and your grandpa.

961
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:07,610
♫Blowing away my blues♫

962
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:07,230
We seem

963
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:08,830
to have more than others.

964
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,890
♫I see your clear features again♫

965
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:11,200
But Lin Xi, don't forget

966
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:12,510
that if you hadn't

967
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:13,830
forced me to take the TOEFL test

968
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:16,390
♫Like stars illuminating the night sky♫

969
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:14,830
and apply for schools,

970
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:16,070
accompanied me, and encouraged me,

971
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:16,910
I wouldn't have achieved these.

972
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:19,040
♫Open my heart to you♫

973
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:18,390
Do you know?

974
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:22,110
♫Break the shackles of misunderstanding♫

975
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:22,600
Do you think God is fair to me?

976
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:25,210
♫We became each other♫

977
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:25,070
Yes, it gave me talent.

978
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:25,910
And then?

979
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:29,290
♫Love is precious♫

980
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:27,990
It made me fall into it.

981
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:29,050
I couldn't get out.

982
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:32,550
♫I'm waiting for you to hug me♫

983
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:32,630
I even lost you because of it.

984
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,100
♫Relive the feeling of being overwhelmed♫

985
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,640
♫Become fireworks♫

986
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:40,450
Lin Xi.

987
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:42,990
Talent never

988
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:44,430
has only one side.

989
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:50,000
♫I still remember the warm hugs♫

990
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:48,230
Your own self-discipline and self-improvement

991
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:50,430
shows that you're also a child

992
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:51,550
loved by God.

993
00:47:51,290 --> 00:47:54,610
♫Love remembers♫

994
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:54,750
You just don't know it.

995
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:58,290
♫It finds you and I again♫

996
00:47:58,290 --> 00:48:01,520
♫The breeze brushes past the sunset♫

997
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:00,630
All right.

998
00:48:01,350 --> 00:48:02,190
Your're fine.

999
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,370
♫You look at me♫

1000
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:06,310
♫Until the shadows melt into the galaxy♫

1001
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:05,310
Your're fine.

1002
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:09,590
♫I'll hold your hand again♫

1003
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:12,820
♫Gazing into each other's eyes♫

1004
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:16,760
♫Happiness is that I now have♫

1005
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:14,150
Your're fine.

1006
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:24,280
♫A future with you♫
