How is it?

10
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,250
Not the noodles.

11
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,450
I'm asking about work.

12
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,699
You mean Lawrence?

13
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,190
It was almost noon

14
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,520
when I reached Fucheng.

15
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,230
He had to go to a meeting

16
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,710
after we exchanged greetings.

17
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,230
I could only have a brief conversation

18
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,950
with him after his afternoon meeting ended,

19
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,390
then he had to go to an evening dinner.

20
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,510
We could only

21
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:34,240
arrange for a teleconference for tomorrow noon.

22
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,710
So,

23
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,520
you just waited at the conference center?

24
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:44,750
Well,

25
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:45,960
the coffee in the lobby

26
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,890
was really good.

27
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,670
Lawrence

28
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,590
is a world-class

29
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,650
financial tycoon.

30
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,910
There's a crowd waiting to

31
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,190
meet him everyday.

32
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,110
So

33
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,310
his time is precious,

34
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:02,360
and yet he can give me

35
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,470
half an hour tomorrow.

36
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,750
That means he sees

37
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,790
the value of Yuyi.

38
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,550
If it was in the past,

39
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:14,670
you would've just got up

40
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,710
and left,

41
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,760
not to mention just sitting there to wait for him.

42
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,340
Really?

43
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,130
Was I really like that before?

44
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,760
You don't remember?

45
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,400
Do you need me to remind you?

46
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,070
There was one year,

47
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,470
where your robotics club

48
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,329
entered a robotics competition.

49
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,150
The sponsor then

50
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,310
printed their logo

51
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,470
on your robot.

52
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,950
Who was the one

53
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,350
that smashed the robot?

54
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:41,750
Who?

55
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:45,230
You still remember this.

56
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,150
Xiao Yicheng.

57
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:52,829
You've changed a lot.

58
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,670
Tell me then.

59
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,790
How have I changed?

60
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,430
You've become

61
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,910
more steady.

62
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,190
And you've learnt

63
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,020
to compromise for your dream.

64
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:21,070
The current me,

65
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,350
and the past me,

66
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,320
which one do you prefer?

67
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,750
This question again.

the most beautiful part of life

71
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,870

the scattered flowers

73
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,190
along the path you take,

74
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,030
so that

75
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,990
it can remain forever beautiful

76
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,030
and fragrant.

77
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,480
Whether it's in the past or now,

78
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,680
the person I love has always been you.

79
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,630
Maomao.

80
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,390
How long has he been in the meeting with Lawrence?

81
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,750
28 minutes.

82
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,720
We finally

83
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,850
got Lawrence's contact information,

84
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,110
yet he only gave us

85
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,710
half an hour to present.

86
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,430
I wonder if Xiao

87
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,790
can persuade him.

88
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,110
One minute left.

89
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,600
Ms. Tong, it's over.

90
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:36,550
Okay.

91
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,430
Xiao, how was it?

92
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:47,510
Don't be too upset

93
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,710
that we didn't get it.

94
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,350
We have other options.

95
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:51,750
-I can— -He agreed.

96
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,230
He agreed?

97
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,550
He'll even send the contract over soon.

98
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,230
I'll go get things ready now.

99
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:00,800
Okay.

100
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,750
Mr. Xiao,

101
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:03,870
you are so cool!

102
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,110
You are my idol!

103
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:22,350
How is it?

104
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,390
Did you get it?

105
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,470
He agreed.

106
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:27,990
I knew

107
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,310
you will succeed.

108
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:30,710
Well,

109
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,710
I'll send you the contract

110
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,240
once he sends it over, okay?

111
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:35,790
Okay.

112
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:37,270
We'll be on standby.

113
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,630
The ratios for the U.S., China,

114
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,470
and the European Union

115
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,310
are all here.

116
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,170
All right, let's get back to work.

117
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,110
Where's Chen Wen?

118
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,830
She said she went out for work.

119
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,330
Let's get back to work.

120
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,710
I've reviewed

121
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:48,830
the translations for these

122
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:49,840
overseas private equity documents.

123
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,390
They should be fine.

124
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,510
You can send all of them

125
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,310
except for the one for Lawrence.

126
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,750
Hello, Xi.

127
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,390
I'm sorry.

128
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,900
The construction site was too noisy.

129
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,230
I didn't hear your call.

130
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,750
Have you taken a look at all the translations

131
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,680
for the private equity documents?

132
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,790
Yes, I have.

133
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,070
Proofread them?

134
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,710
I've checked them twice.

135
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,110
They should be right.

136
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,590
Then why is there only an English version

137
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,590
for Alpha Fund?

138
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,110
Chen, come up quickly.

139
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,710
Sorry, wait a minute.

140
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:51,950
Xi.

141
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:52,910
The client is calling me.

142
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:53,870
I'll call you back later.

143
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:54,350
Bye.

144
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:55,950
Chen Wen!

145
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,350
Chen!

146
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,190
Coming!

147
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,670
There's nothing wrong

148
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,610
with only an English version.

149
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,120
The CEO of Alpha Fund,

150
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,870
Lawrence,

151
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,070
what's his full name?

152
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,430
Michel Lawrence.

153
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:22,990
Yes.

154
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:23,670
Michel.

155
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,390
This word originated from France.

156
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,510
It's a common name for the French.

157
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,910
I wrote it very clearly in the materials

158
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,110
I gave Chen Wen.

159
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,360
Lawrence

160
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,550
holds dual citizenship in the U.S. and France.

161
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,620
Before the age of 14,

162
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,510
he lived with his grandmother in Nice.

163
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,510
Under such circumstances,

164
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,030
if we can

165
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,110
prepare another version

166
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,510
in French,

167
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:42,750
there will be bonus points

168
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,670
towards Yuyi's fundraising,

169
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,870
contributing to the impression score.

170
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,370
You're making some serious effort here.

171
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,110
Did you tell Chen Wen?

172
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,070
In work,

173
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:55,110
one should learn how to deduce many things from one case.

174
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,910
She has been working with us for more than half a year,

175
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,550
and yet she's still thinking like a student.

176
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,230
She hands in a task that earns only

177
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,270
80 or 90 marks and she feels

178
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,430
satisfied about it,

179
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,380
even though she was supposed

180
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,390
to achieve 100 marks.

181
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,080
Shouldn't the goal

182
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,950
be to aim for 120 marks

183
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:05,710
when your boss hands you

184
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:06,950
a task that is worth

185
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,310
100 marks?

186
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:11,670
Xixi.

187
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,630
You,

188
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,120
are the most

189
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:20,230
demanding director I've ever met in Huasheng.

190
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:24,210
That's because you don't understand Huasheng.

191
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,950
In the past, I didn't understand

192
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,150
why Huasheng

193
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,750
and other big companies

194
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,810
value high education in their staff.

195
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,630
But indeed,

196
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,430
excellent people

197
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:34,550
will always

198
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,270
demand the highest standard

199
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,470
of themselves.

200
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,310
Being excellent is a habit.

201
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:39,710
Chen Wen hasn't learnt it before,

202
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:40,910
but I hope that if she still wishes

203
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:41,910
to stay in the company,

204
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:42,990
she has to learn it.

205
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,670
Why are you so late?

206
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,150
I was delayed by something.

207
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:08,350
Let's go.

208
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:11,990
So,

209
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,690
where are we going?

210
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,110
Guess.

211
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:17,870
Give me a hint.

212
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,040
Our cultural heritage.

213
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,190
Mahjong.

214
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:29,630
Opera?

215
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,350
Peking opera or Kunqu?

216
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:35,800
You'll know when you get there.

217
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,070
You have to tell me now.

218
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:39,870
If you don't tell me, how can I...

219
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,190
Please smell the tea.

220
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,810
Please smell the scent of the cup.

221
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,080
Thank you.

222
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,910
Please have a taste.

223
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:28,370
This is the champion of teas, Da Hong Pao.

224
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,710
It has the freshness of green tea

225
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:32,040
and the rich and mellow taste of black tea.

226
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,390
Isn't it hot?

227
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:36,630
It's hot.

228
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:55,420
[No chance to eat]

229
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:56,630
You know what?

230
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,270
In the past,

231
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,110
I always thought these tea houses

232
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:01,670
were expensive and awful.

233
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:02,350
I always wondered

234
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,010
how their business survived.

235
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,890
I finally found the answer today.

236
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:08,490
All because of naive customers like you.

237
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,030
Let's go.

238
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,950
I'll take you to eat skewers.

239
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,390
What's wrong?

240
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,750
They smell so strongly.

241
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:25,200
The smell...

242
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,230
They smell too…

243
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:31,010
You can always do laundry when you're back home.

244
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,070
Okay, let's go.

245
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,950
Shasha.

246
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,430
Mommy.

247
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:50,830
Honey, what's wrong?

248
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:53,270
You've been to the toilet so many times,

249
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,950
did you eat something bad?

250
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,470
N-no.

251
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,030
Honey,

252
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:13,020
here, drink this honey water.

253
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:13,750
It's good for your stomach.

254
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,270
Here.

255
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,550
Honey,

256
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,110
you ate dinner

257
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,100
with your friend tonight.

258
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,110
What did you eat?

259
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,750
We had skewers.

260
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:25,910
Skewers?

261
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,230
It's like barbecue.

262
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,590
Shasha,

263
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,270
I won't interfere with you making friends,

264
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,070
but

265
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:38,190
whether it's friends or a partner,

266
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:40,440
you have to be able to eat the same food.

267
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:41,610
Do you understand?

268
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,470
But whether it's friends or a partner,

269
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,710
we should be able to

270
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,950
seek common ground even with our differences.

271
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:49,150
Yes, we should,

272
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,350
but on the premise

273
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:52,490
that you won't be forced, or be upset.

274
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,950
Tonight,

275
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,150
at the skewer restaurant,

276
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,310
did you feel upset?

277
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,350
All right.

278
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:01,030
Hurry.

279
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,750
Finish the honey water

280
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,790
and rest early.

281
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,069
If you still feel unwell,

282
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:06,730
you have to go to the hospital.

283
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,910
Mommy, I'm really fine.

284
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:10,910
Okay.

285
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:11,869
Rest early.

286
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:12,829
I'll leave now.

287
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:14,950
Good night, Mommy.

288
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:15,990
Good night.

289
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,550
Yes, Mr. Xu.

290
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,910
I'm sorry.

291
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:35,750
This is our mistake.

292
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,720
We didn't make our requests clear,

293
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,390
but it's urgent.

294
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:42,550
Okay.

295
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:43,710
Thank you.

296
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,350
Done.

297
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:52,150
One way or another,

298
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:54,480
I finally got Mr. Xu to let me cut the queue.

299
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:55,670
Thanks.

300
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:56,740
For what?

301
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,470
This is what a Party B should do.

302
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:10,350
Xi.

303
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,240
I'm sorry.

304
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,870
I just finished my work

305
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:15,270
before I called you back.

306
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,670
You say that the client was looking for you,

307
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,310
but you couldn't find a single moment

308
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,590
throughout the whole day

309
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:21,790
to call me back?

310
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,710
Sorry, Xi.

311
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:26,830
Well...

312
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:29,350
you didn't ask for the French version.

313
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:31,630
Chen Wen.

314
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,910
I've been telling you

315
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,550
to think thoroughly

316
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,390
when you receive a task.

317
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,910
I've kept reminding you about your work logic,

318
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:41,670
over and over,

319
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,350
and you've changed nothing.

320
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,710
I've been busy

321
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,470
all day today to coordinate

322
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:49,030
the mess you left behind.

323
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,390
Your internship

324
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:51,590
will be over soon.

325
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,590
You know what that means, right?

326
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,350
Think about it.

327
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,310
Xi.

328
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,550
Is she going to fire me?

329
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,590
How did you survive

330
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,550
from Huasheng?

331
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,070
That's because you don't know

332
00:19:59,070 --> 00:19:59,830
what I've done

333
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,070
for this assistant!

334
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,630
Hiring her

335
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,550
was an exception.

336
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:06,750
I was hoping to

337
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,150
recruit talents regardless of the norms.

338
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,630
Her internship will be over soon.

339
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,350
She's going to become a regular employee,

340
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,390
and undergo assessments.

341
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:16,030
If she doesn't do well,

342
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:16,830
how can I

343
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,030
fight for her with HR?

344
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,990
My Director Lin.

345
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,790
Now that your work is finished,

346
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:28,350
shouldn't you spare some time

347
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,790
to accompany your boyfriend,

348
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,070
and go on a date?

349
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,710
It's already so late.

350
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,550
Let's go see what's on

351
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,210
for the late-night showings.

352
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,470
Let's not

353
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,830
go to the movies today.

354
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:41,890
Then what are we doing?

355
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,390
I'll take you somewhere.

356
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:43,920
Let's go.

357
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,030
Tong Xin.

358
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,790
Why are you leaving only now?

359
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:55,430
Did Cheng Yao give you that thing?

360
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,710
What thing?

361
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,150
I don't know

362
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,180
what it is exactly.

363
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,670
He just asked me for

364
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:01,790
the contact information

365
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:02,830
of a friend who's an engraver.

366
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:03,790
All right.

367
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,190
Her time is mine now.

368
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,470
Whatever it is, can you talk about it tomorrow?

369
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,880
Sure, Mr. Xiao.

370
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:08,590
Let's go.

371
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:09,350
Bye.

372
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:09,950
Bye.

373
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,310
Where are we going?

374
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,870
To do something exciting.

375
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,480
This is what you meant

376
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,830
by something exciting?

377
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:25,320
♫An orange breeze blows through the dawn♫

I was thinking that

382
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:29,750
you've been under too much pressure lately,

383
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,250

The receptionist said you were here.

431
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:48,190

432
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:49,630
why you didn't make an appointment with me.

433
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:50,790

No need.

435
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:53,110

436
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,910

00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:55,390

00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:04,230
Actually, previously

444
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,750
there was a interpreter job

445
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:06,750

446
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,270

what I wanted to do

581
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:40,790

I'll give you an email address,

594
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,510
That's because of what Peter said—

595
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,230
How could you believe

596
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,710

599

I don't have to tell him everything.

00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:03,190
at the Agricultural Product Trade Exhibition

622
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:04,870
showed up as Chinese radishes

623
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:06,030
all because of

624
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:06,970
Huasheng's translation mistake.

625
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:08,350
Now 6,000 tons of Chinese radishes

626
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,880
have piled up at the cold storage of the port.

627

The company has requested Huasheng Translation Company

628

by Mr. Ding.

644
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:56,060

646
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,190

no one can help her this time.

00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:33,950
we did not receive this comparison table.

770
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:36,270
Would the client frame you?

771
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:37,710
Mr. Ding,

772
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,110
we're already starting an internal investigation.

773
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:40,670
We will give you an answer as soon as possible.

774
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:41,630
If this matter

775
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,030
isn't handled properly,

776
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:44,270
the Xiahai branch

777
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:45,750
needs to think about

778
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,190
what to do.

779
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,760
Speak up.

780
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,760
What do you think?

781
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,230
To put it lightly,

782
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,870
Huasheng will be humiliated.

783
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:03,870
To put it broadly,

784
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:05,110
it will affect the reputations

785
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:07,270
of all the translation companies in the country.

786
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:08,480
For now,

787
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,670
we should make a statement first

788
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:10,830
to show our attitude.

789
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,110
The golden 8 hours is the optimal window to handle

790
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:14,150
public opinions.

791
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,960
Please wait a little longer.

792
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:17,830
Have you thought about the consequences

793
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:19,070
if the public opinion continues to fester?

794
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:20,070
There's still 5 hours left

795
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,110
of this 8 hour period.

796
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:21,920
Mr. Lu,

797
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:23,110
are you in a hurry?

798
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:25,390
What if there are no results

799
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:26,550
in 5 hours?

800
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,310
I'll take full responsibility.

801
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:34,630
Now that things has blown up,

802
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:35,750
how are they going to investigate it?

803
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:37,110
Something happened to the priority client management department,

804
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:37,750
who do you think

805
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:38,880
will take the blame?

806
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,110
The people in charge of this project

807
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,640
are Tan Shasha and Wei Tian.

808
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:42,990
Could it be them?

809
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:44,290
Think about it.

810
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,630
What's the relationship

811
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:46,510
between Tan Shasha and Lin Xi?

812
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:47,760
While Wei Tian is Lin Xi's

813
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,750
right hand man.

814
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:49,510
If someone's to fall,

815
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:50,770
it would be the newbie.

816
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:52,470
Having a background is like

817
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:54,600
having a get-out-of-jail-free card.

818
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,830
[Resignation Report]

819
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:19,670
Tian.

820
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:20,350
Eat.

821
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:23,610
Don't frown.

822
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:25,610
You'll get wrinkles if you frown.

823
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:28,470
Tian.

824
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:29,590
Let me ask you.

825
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:31,950
How did you come to Huasheng?

826
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:34,490
I submitted my resume online.

827
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:36,310
The first round was an oral interview

828
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:37,390
with the HR department.

829
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:38,830
The second round was a written test.

830
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:40,390
The third round I attended 3 rounds

831
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:41,720
of expert evaluations.

832
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:43,790
I remember

833
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:46,520
you were ranked first in the written exam, right?

834
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:47,550
You stood out among

835
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:49,350
over 600 interviewees

836
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,030
and stayed in Huasheng.

837
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:52,840
Do you know what that means?

838
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:55,430
Tan Shasha,

839
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,070
this is all because of

840
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:58,710
your own skills.

841
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:01,030
Being able to be a member of this department

842
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,830
can only prove your excellence.

843
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,550
But I was in charge of the contract

844
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:06,960
between Senmei and Oren Corporation.

845
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,890
I should take the responsibility.

846
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:10,550
But you didn't receive

847
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:12,150
the third comparison table.

848
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:16,230
Will Mr. Zhang believe it?

849
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:18,090
Will everyone believe it?

850
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:21,790
I will.

851
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:40,430
Hello?

852
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:47,750
Okay.

853
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:48,880
Send me the address.

854
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:22,510
The coffee here is good.

855
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:23,830
What do you want to drink?

856
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:25,090
I've ordered already.

857
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:29,230
Hello, your coffee.

858
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:29,830
Thank you.

859
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:31,910
I'll have a hand-brewed Mandheling.

860
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,520
Okay, please wait a moment.

861
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:36,750
Just cut to the chase.

862
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:41,110
Shasha often told me

863
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:42,310
you have been giving her

864
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:43,870
a lot of advice at work.

865
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:46,590
Have you been busy lately?

866
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:50,630
I only have ten minutes.

867
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:53,310
You didn't call me here to catch up, did you?

868
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:55,800
Shasha

869
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:58,590
is young and inexperienced.

870
00:41:58,710 --> 00:41:59,710
So I hope

871
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:01,710
you'll look after her as her cousin.

872
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:07,470
This time,

873
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:09,390
will this incident

874
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:10,990
involve Shasha?

875
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:13,310
The Oren Corporation project

876
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:14,570
was handled by Shasha.

877
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,190
But as far as I know,

878
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:17,310
there were other colleagues

879
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:19,310
that went to the exhibition as well.

880
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,830
Xixi,

881
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:29,990
no matter what,

882
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:31,730
you have to protect Sasha.

883
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,550
Is your daughter more important

884
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:42,190
that the future of other people?

885
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:42,910
Is that so?

886
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:45,710
No.

887
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:47,830
Shasha respects you so much.

888
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:49,620
Can you bear to see

889
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:50,150
Shasha

890
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,670
facing the storm alone?

891
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:53,390
Of course.

892
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:54,270
These are also the wishes

893
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:56,270
of your grandfather Professor Gao.

894
00:42:57,590 --> 00:43:00,430
Your grandfather has high hopes for Shasha.

895
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:01,550
He doesn't want her

896
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:03,230
to have flaws in her resume.

897
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:05,590
Professor Gao

898
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:08,280
never cared about the affairs of Huasheng all along.

899
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,350
Yes.

900
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:12,200
Excessive concern leads to chaos.

901
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:13,550
But Shasha

902
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:16,310
is one of his favorite granddaughters.

903
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,540
It's normal for him

904
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:20,510
to make an exception.

905
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:27,070
Xixi,

906
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:30,430
I’m counting on you.
