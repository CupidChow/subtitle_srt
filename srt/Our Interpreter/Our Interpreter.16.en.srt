[Episode 16]

3
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:34,370
[Fair daffodils, we weep to see you haste away so soon]

4
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:40,670
[As yet the early rising sun has not attain'd his noon]

5
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:43,610
[Stay, stay]

6
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:48,130
[Until the hasting day has run, but to the even-song]

7

[And, having pray'd together,]

8
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,729

[Robert Herrick]

10
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:25,710
Yao,

11
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,270
everyone is waiting for you at the champion celebration party.

12
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,750
You must come.

13
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:30,910
I'm not interested.

14
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,550
Your confession before thousands was rejected.

15
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,630
Everyone is waiting in line

16
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,590
to comfort you.

17
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:23,829
Look.

18
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,150
Do you understand

19
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,310
these sentences?

20
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,150
Next time, I will

21
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,910
check your homework.

22
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,390
No problem.

23
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,990
What happened to you?

24
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,870
This child's puberty period

25
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,390
is very long.

26
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,550
With his state, shouldn't you check on him?

27
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,500
No.

28
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,230
He always falls from skateboarding.

29
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,500
I'm used to it.

30
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,630
Let's continue.

31
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:02,540
Look.

32
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,150
We just experienced

33
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,790
the nature that Shakespeare described.

34
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,980
Now, let's enter

35
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:12,870
the world of love written by him.

36
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,510
Okay.

37
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:18,959
Then happy I, that love

38
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,380
and am beloved

39
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,029
where I may not remove

40
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,790
nor be removed.

41
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:25,510
Good.

42
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:27,470
Your accent is very pure.

43
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,310
Stop reading.

44
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,990
Yao, stop reading what?

45
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,030
Grandaunt,

46
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,640
stop having Peter read that poem.

47
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,070
Then happy I, that love

48
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,870
and am beloved

49
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,480
where I may not remove

50
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,550
nor be removed.

51
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,950
Stop reading it.

52
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,870
Then happy I, that love

53
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,670

55
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,070
-nor be removed.
-Yao,

56
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,430
what's wrong?

57
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,270
Did something happen?

58
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,950
Grandaunt, I need peace and quiet.

59
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,390
Tell him to stop reading.

60
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,150
It's so annoying.

61
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,870
Shakespeare's poetry is so beautiful.

62
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:03,830
Why don't you want to hear it?

63
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:04,590
I don't want to hear it.

64
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:05,430
What's wrong?

65
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,110
Did you get dumped?

66
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,550
You got dumped?

67
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,230
I didn't, Grandaunt.

68
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,950
Aunt Xixi will definitely choose my Papa

69
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,030
and not you.

70
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,310
Then happy I, that love

71
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,110
and am beloved

72
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,630
where I may not remove...

73
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,470
Peter, get over here.

74
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,270
Stop reading.

75
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,670
Nor be removed.

76
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:31,390
Give me the book.

77
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,870
Then happy I, that love

78
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,590
-and am beloved
-Slow down.

79
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,790
Nor be removed.

80
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,830
Then happy I, that love

81
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,270
-Come here.
-and am beloved.

82
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,150
Give me the book.

83
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,590
Where I may not remove nor be removed.

84
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:43,520
Give me the book.

85
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,030
Give me the book.

86
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,310
What's wrong?

87
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,030
Where did you hurt yourself?

88
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:55,830
Let me help you up.

89
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,030
No, I can do it myself.

90
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,510
Can you move?

91
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,030
I think his tailbone is broken.

92
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,630
We need to call an ambulance.

93
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:09,350
Yao, if you broke a bone,

94
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,230
you should get it checked.

95
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:12,630
No need, Grandaunt.

96
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:17,630
You...

97
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,130
What are you doing?

98
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,550
What are you doing?

99
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,470
I'm moving.

100
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,470
I'll call Xixi.

101
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,670
You can't call her.

102
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,750
You should go to the hospital now.

103
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,110
No.

104
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,190
Yes.

105
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,670
Grandma Li,

106
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:51,830
I'm sorry.

107
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:52,630
I have to follow him.

108
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,070
I'll take him to the hospital.

109
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,550
Thank you.

110
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,430
I feel apologetic.

111
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,390
It's Peter's fault.

112
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,870
I'll take responsibility for him.

113
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,070
I need to get my phone.

114
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,950
Go with your mom.

115
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:05,870
Goodbye, Grandma Li.

116
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,560
Let me take you to the hospital.

117
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,550
I said no. Don't you understand?

118
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,830
Where are you going?

119
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,030
I'll give you a ride.

120
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,390
Have you thought it through?

121
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,550
What are you doing?

122
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,510
Mommy, he's booking a hotel.

123
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:08,150
Peter, sit in your seat.

124
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,890
You have no place to stay tonight?

125
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,990
Come with me.

126
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,530
Where can I go with you?

127
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,990
I have a place to stay.

128
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:38,000
You helped Xiao Yicheng every day before.

129
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,059
What ulterior motive do you have now?

130
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:43,150
Suit yourself.

131
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,830
Don't blame me for not warning you.

132
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,230
It's going to rain later.

133
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,350
My son is responsible

134
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,110
for you hurting your butt.

135
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,990
I'm leaving.

136
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:13,350
Open the trunk.

137
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,430
Be careful.

138
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,310
Come in.

139
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:36,830
Come.

140
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:37,910
Here.

141
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:39,540
Thank you.

142
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,550
Your staff dormitory is not bad.

143
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,780
Yuyi has great benefits.

144
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,990
Mom, this is Papa's room.

145
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:01,910
Well,

146
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,430
I'm just giving you a chance

147
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:04,950
to be responsible for me.

148
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,270
Don't think too much.

149
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,550
I'm not taking advantage of you.

150
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,950
You don't have to tell me.

151
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,030
If there's nothing else,

152
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,990
rest early.

153
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,510
Call me if you need anything.

154
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,310
Thank you.

155
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:15,710
Bye.

156
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,550
Good night.

157
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:18,930
Good night.

158
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,350
But the champion today

159
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,190
belongs to one person.

160
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,030
Without her,

161
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,510
I wouldn't have made it this far.

162
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,050
[Tong Xin]

163
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,310
Hello?

164
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,330
I have something to report to you.

165
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,030
Go ahead.

166
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,310
This is

167
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,350
what happened.

168
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,350
Peter hurt him,

169
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,280
so I have to be responsible for him.

170
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,870
You mean you made

171
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,750
my rival in love

172
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,270
stay in my room, right?

173
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,990
Xiao, you've moved out.

174
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,000
Don't be petty.

175
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,550
I can't not be petty

176
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,750
toward a man who confessed

177
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,880
to my girl in public.

178
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,110
You found out?

179
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,440
I'm watching the video.

180
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,390
As far as I know, Lin Xi rejected him.

181
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,940
Even a virtuous woman fears clingy men.

182
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,510
Once, she'll refuse. Twice, she'll hesitate.

183
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,790
Three times, she might accept it.

184
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:35,940
If that's the case,

185
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,310
you can only blame yourself for not being good enough.

186
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,670
Tong Xin, whose side are you on?

187
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,300
All right.

188
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,270
I'm hanging up.

189
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,110
Wait.

190
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,670
Change the team building location.

191
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:46,350
You mean

192
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,310
the joint team building with Huasheng?

193
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,190
Sure. Where do you want to change it to?

194
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:50,900
Fangte.

195
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,150
Fangte?

196
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:52,910
Why?

197
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:54,670
I have my own thoughts.

198
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,870
Okay, no problem.

199
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,190
What's wrong?

200
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,940
Nothing.

201
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,070
Peter.

202
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,950
Peter, come here.

203
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:34,750
Mommy.

204
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,270
Come.

205
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:38,710
What's wrong?

206
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,710
Spray the medicine for Yao.

207
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,870
No, I can do it myself.

208
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,270
You got hurt today

209
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,430
because of my son.

210
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,270
Do you want to give the kid

211
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,670
a chance to make up for it?

212
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:53,590
Peter,

213
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,470
you hurt Yao today.

214
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:55,950
Do you want to

215
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,350
make up for your mistake?

216
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:02,150
You have to take responsibility for your mistakes.

217
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,790
Fine, I'll spray it.

218
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,670
Call me when you're done.

219
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,150
Spray it.

220
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,310
Where does it hurt?

221
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,070
Is it here?

222
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,510
Are you trying to make it hurt for me?

223
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,270
Here.

224
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:26,660
Here.

225
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,670
Does it hurt a lot?

226
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,720
Why don't you fall down too?

227
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,510
I mean,

228
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:46,430
if you fell, it would hurt,

229
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,460
but who am I?

230
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:48,870
I'm Yao.

231
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,070
Come on. One more time.

232
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:50,550
Here.

233
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:54,470
Okay.

234
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:02,710
Mommy, I'm done.

235
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:03,710
Coming.

236
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:06,790
You're done?

237
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,550
Here, have some fruit.

238
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:12,710
Thank you.

239
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:13,640
You're welcome.

240
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,310
Do you have something

241
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,550
to say to Yao?

242
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,350
I'm sorry.

243
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,430
It's not your fault.

244
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,750
In the future,

245
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,790
I'll leave the task of giving Yao medicine

246
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:27,990
to you, okay?

247
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,060
Yes, madam.

248
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:30,990
We're leaving.

249
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,420
Come on.

250
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:53,640
I didn't expect Xiao Yicheng's people

251
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:55,870
to be pretty good.

252
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,190
You're still up?

253
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,070
I want to show you something.

254
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,240
Is it work-related?

255
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,390
You'll see.

256
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:48,840
What do you mean?

257
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,910
Skateboarding is cool,

258
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,510
but it's very dangerous.

259
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,070
It's 120 times more likely to get

260
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,710
injuries or casualties from skateboarding than riding the plane.

261
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,910
So, don't be fooled by the surface.

262
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,390
Did he confess to you?

263
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,220
I don't think

264
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,470
I have to report my personal business

265
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:16,390
to Mr. Xiao.

266
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,950
Cheng Yao is just a kid.

267
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,550
What does he know about love?

268
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,790
I find

269
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,080
that you and Cheng Yao are a good match.

270
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,190
You said he's a kid

271
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,470
who likes to act cool.

272
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:30,310
He said you are

273
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:31,870
a shameless old man.

274
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,270
Why don't you two pair up?

275
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,120
That's what he said about me?

276
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,270
Then, what do you think?

277
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,310
I think

278
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,110
I should go back to sleep now.

279
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,830
I'm so tired and sleepy.

280
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:48,750
What's wrong?

281
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,710
It hurts.

282
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:52,830
I acted as your cushion

283
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,710
all night on Meizhou Island.

284
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,180
It's been hurting.

285
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,110
Forget it.

286
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:03,670
There's no problem.

287
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,390
You can go back.

288
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,710
Rest early.

289
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:10,869
If it really hurts,

290
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:11,920
I know

291
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,190
a good masseuse.

292
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,119
I'll ask him to come over tomorrow.

293
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,030
No need.

294
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,030
I'm fine.

295
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:17,960
Go back and rest.

296
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:25,750
Sit down.

297
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,630
It's okay now.

298
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:30,910
I said it's okay.

299
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,790
Really.

300
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,030
I think massaging like this

301
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,290
will relieve the pain.

302
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,270
Does it feel better?

303
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:53,630
It's okay, I guess.

304
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:57,830
Is it sore or does it hurt?

305
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:59,030
It's a little sweet.

306
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,310
Well, it's both sore and it hurts.

307
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,510
It just doesn't feel comfortable.

308
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,230
It suddenly recovered.

309
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:13,160
It's miraculous, don't you think?

310
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,150
Lin Xi,

311
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,390
am I the first person

312
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:24,790
to enjoy this treatment?

313
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:25,910
No.

314
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:27,510
Then, who was it?

315
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,630
Cheng Yao?

316
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:32,310
My dad.

317
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,430
Okay.

318
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,590
I'll leave Yao to you.

319
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,880
Sorry for troubling you.

320
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,470
Thank you.

321
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:50,990
Grandma,

322
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,200
what happened to Cheng Yao?

323
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,750
He had a fight with Peter today

324
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,350
and fell down.

325
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,830
He got hurt.

326
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:02,070
He's in Tong Xin's apartment now.

327
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,870
Why did he go to Tong Xin's place?

328
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:09,190
He came back in a bad mood

329
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,150
and was about to leave with his luggage,

330
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,470
but then he fell.

331
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:14,270
I think he hurt his tailbone.

He didn't trouble you, the Party A, right?

Mr. Xiao.

We made a promise with Ms. Tong earlier.

352

You signed the contract,

357
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:27,090
and didn't take a closer look.

358
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,090
How will it be shot?

359
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:32,870
Just work normally.

00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,710
are those that make the Forbes list,

387
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:43,710
but she's working so hard

388
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,310
for Mr. Xiao's documentary.

389
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:47,070
What does it mean?

390
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:51,640
It means that Mr. Xiao is on the Forbes list?

391
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,230
It means there's something between them?

392
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:01,270
Yes.

393
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:04,630
But I thought Mr. Xiao

394
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,310
is interested in Xi.

395
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,600
I think Mr. Xiao

396
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,800
matches better with Chief Editor Chen.

397
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:14,590
Xi—

398
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:19,030
Stop chatting.

399
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,130
It's meeting time.

400
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:20,790
Okay.

401
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:22,970
Why didn't you warn me?

402
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:25,910
Let's go.

403
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:33,630
Tong.

404
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:34,470
Grandma Li,

405
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,190
sorry for bothering you today.

406
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,920
I have a presumptuous request.

407
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,230
Did Yao

408
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,910
give you trouble?

409
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:44,150
I'm worried about him,

410
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,190
so

411
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,630
can you talk to him?

412
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:56,590
Who is it?

413
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:05,670
Why are you sleeping in broad daylight?

414
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:08,310
It'll take longer for you to recover like this.

415
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:11,030
Grandaunt, why are you here?

416
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:13,650
Did she ask you to come?

417
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,110
No one asked me.

418
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:15,940
What?

419
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:18,750
Can't I care about my grandkid?

420
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,840
I don't know what to say about you.

421
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,870
Then don't say anything.

422
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:27,390
Just leave me alone.

423
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:29,390
Being young and passionate

424
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,350
will hurt yourself.

425
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,750
Do you think

426
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:34,800
you were dumped?

427
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,230
Grandaunt, what do you mean?

428
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:38,430
You clearly lost.

429
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:41,810
I won the competition yesterday.

430
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:44,110
I mean

431
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:46,390
that you lost to Xiao Yicheng.

432
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:53,950
Grandaunt,

433
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:56,390
Lin Xi rejected me,

434
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:57,540
but she didn't say yes

435
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,630
to Xiao Yicheng either.

436
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:59,430
See?

437
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,750
Every time we talk about Xixi,

438
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,480
he has to mention Xiao Yicheng.

439
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:05,310
Yao,

440
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:08,070
you do admire Xixi,

441
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:10,110
but it's not the love between a man and woman

442
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:12,180
that you think it is.

443
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:13,790
Think about it.

444
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,360
When did you

445
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,190
decide to pursue Xixi?

446
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:19,950
Was it the moment

447
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:22,550
Xiao Yicheng entered the playing field?

448
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,230
But Grandaunt,

449
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,830
if you knew all this,

450
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:36,790
why did you

451
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:37,990
help me pursue Lin Xi?

452
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:41,310
My place

453
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:42,910
is rarely so lively.

454
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:44,360
It's so lively when you youngsters come

455
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,790
and flirt with one another.

456
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,310
This is truly

457
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,670
what life is about.

458
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:52,150
So, you've just been

459
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,510
playing with me all this time?

460
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,780
I didn't mean that.

461
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:59,270
I just wanted to give you advice.

462
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,030
Then stop.

463
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,570
I'll continue to be angry.

464
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,230
Cheng Yao.

465
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,070
Did you know

466
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:11,270
that the prototype of Yuyi's translation device

467
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,950
was made by Xiao Yicheng

468
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:14,150
in his most painful times

469
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,230
after getting dumped

470
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:15,910
by Lin Xi?

471
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:16,790
He deserved to get dumped.

472
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:18,390
As you said just now,

473
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,510
Lin Xi didn't choose you

474
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,670
or Xiao Yicheng,

475
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:23,070
so you didn't lose.

476
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:24,990
However,

477
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:27,550
do you want to let Xiao Yicheng

478
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:30,210
win with his performance after getting dumped?

479
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,910
I'm going to bed.

480
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,390
The English part in the document

481
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:51,710
has some ambiguity.

482
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:52,750
Everyone needs to come up with

483
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,350
a standard.

484
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:57,790
Let me take a look.

486
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:00,030
Yes, change it like this.

[Difficulty Analysis]

488
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,710
What's wrong?

489
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:05,950
Nothing.

490
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:07,790
If there's no problem,

491
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:08,400
let's move on to the next part,

492
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,000
the minority language part.

493
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,030
Regarding the minority language part,

494
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:12,990
I've already asked Huasheng

495
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:13,830
to second some personnel.

496
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:14,990
It's quite last-minute,

497
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:17,030
so the content is not out yet.

498
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,430
So, Chen Wen,

499
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,990
perform the handover

500
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:20,710
with the new colleagues.

501
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:21,350
They'll translate a part

502
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,750
and you'll proofread it.

503
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:24,790
What about Cheng Yao?

504
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:27,790
He's busy recently.

505
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,350
He may be absent for a while.

506
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:32,110
Anyway, the minority language part...

507
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:49,990
The minority language part.

508
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:50,790
Inspect it.

509
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:54,550
What happened to you?

510
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,790
Xi was just saying that you'll be absent.

511
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,070
I'm not that childish.

512
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:02,430
Cheng Yao, wait.

513
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:06,950
Let's adjourn the meeting.

514
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:08,430
Everyone, go eat lunch.

515
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:10,370
We'll start in the afternoon.

00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:27,750
Let's talk.

Let's talk.

519
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:51,560
Did you go to the hospital?

520
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,870
Did you take an X-ray?

521
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,150
I won't die.

522
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:01,350
Move back.

523
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:02,870
Stop bothering Tong Xin.

524
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:05,110
Actually, I can move out.

525
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:05,910
No need.

526
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:07,750
I moved out voluntarily.

527
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,430
Actually,

528
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:20,030
love at your age

529
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:23,030
sometimes

530
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,550
isn't really love.

531
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,990
Maybe you just haven't

532
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:29,230
met someone like me

533
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,350
in your life yet.

534
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:32,470
That's why it feels fresh to you

535
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:33,670
and you feel curious,

536
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:34,590
but maybe

537
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,950
it's not true love.

538
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,170
So you've made up your mind

539
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:45,240
since returning from Meizhou Island, right?

540
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:50,590
If you have any prejudice against Xiao Yicheng,

541
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,230
you can quit Yuyi's project.

542
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,430
I'll apply to the company

543
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:54,470
to transfer you back to the headquarters

544
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:55,430
and find someone to replace you.

545
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:56,110
No need.

546
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,430
Don't worry.

547
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,270
I won't have bad opinions

548
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,020
about you because of this.

549
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,620
But I'll look down on myself.

550
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:12,910
Lin Xi,

551
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:16,390
I hate Xiao Yicheng very much,

552
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,590
but I won't run away

553
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:20,390
from my work responsibilities.

554
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,390
Even more, I won't

555
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:22,550
purposely cause trouble

556
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:25,080
just because this is Xiao Yicheng's project.

557
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:26,400
On the contrary,

558
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:29,080
I'll do even better.

00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:39,350
I'm sorry.

560
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,510
My thoughts were

561
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,910
a little narrow-minded.

562
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,690
You know I don't want to hear this.

563
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,670
You rejected me,

564
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:00,920
but I still have to warn you.

565
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,780
You know about

567
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,070

Don't be fooled by Xiao Yicheng.

He's playing hard to get with you

573

while holding onto Chief Editor Chen.

574
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,910
Don't laugh. I'm serious.

is a good person.

577
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:30,870
Chen Xiao, Chief Editor Chen,

578
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,910
has always liked him.

579
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:35,430
You knew?

580
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:38,950
Back in school,

581
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:41,320
Xiao Yicheng was Prince Charming,

582
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,560
while she was the department's queen.

583
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:46,030
Unexpectedly, I beat her to it.

584
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,310
So,

585
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,190
if they can

586
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:51,710
get together,

587
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,710
I think it's pretty good.

588
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:55,990
You won't be sad?

589
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:57,920
Why should I be sad?

590
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,400
You just won't admit it.

591
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,550
Be careful.

592
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,320
Are you okay?

593
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:07,790
I'm fine.

594
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:08,790
Take it easy.

595
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:17,390
Be careful.

596
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,450
[Meeting Room]

597
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,120
Mr. Xiao, how can I help you?

598
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,600
Let's talk in my office.

599
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:49,750
Put it on for me.

600
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:51,670
I don't know how.

601
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:53,470
You can't do such a simple thing?

602
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,190
He's a man.

603
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:18,510
He can't even walk steadily

604
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:19,750
and needs your help?

605
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,550
I was responsible for his fall.

606
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,100
So what if I helped him?

607
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,620
I told you

608
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,780
that skateboarders are bad.

609
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:35,470
I can't do it.

610
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:37,400
Let Chief Editor Chen do it for you.

611
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,030
Are you jealous?

612
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,240
-You're overthinking.
-Yicheng.

613
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,150
Are you ready?

614
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:58,720
Let me help you.

615
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,110
Give it to Maomao.

616
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:06,710
Okay.

617
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:14,790
Assistant Mao.

618
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:16,670
Help Mr. Xiao

619
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:17,800
put on his mic later.

620
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:18,630
Okay.

621
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:19,270
Thank you.

622
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:21,650
Assistant Mao,

623
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:24,110
I heard that Mr. Xiao moved houses?

624
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:25,429
Yes.

625
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:27,190
It's been a while since he's moved.

626
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,790
Do you know where he moved to?

627
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:31,630
What's the matter?

628
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:34,750
We need to film a home scene.

629
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:37,389
He moved to Jialian.

630
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:38,630
He's Xi's neighbor.

631
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:43,650
Chief Editor Chen?

632
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:47,750
Do you know

633
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:49,469
if he will be home

634
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:50,710
this Saturday morning?

635
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:51,550
Let me take a look.

636
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,110
Okay.

637
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,469
He should be there.

638
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:57,310
Do you need me

639
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:58,470
to set a time with him?

640
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:59,350
No, no.

641
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:00,460
We want to do

642
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,550
a surprise shoot.

643
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:02,870
It's more realistic.

644
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,030
Assistant Mao,

645
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:05,870
you must keep it a secret for us.

646
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:06,470
Okay.

647
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:08,110
I'll get back to work now.

648
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:09,870
Xiao,

649
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,430
are we working overtime on Saturday?

650
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:13,350
I'll arrange the recording

651
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:14,460
and lighting staff.

652
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,190
No, I'll go by myself.

653
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:16,750
Okay.

654
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:42,990
Yao.

655
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:45,390
Yuyi wants to do teambuilding

656
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:46,280
with our project team.

657
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,310
Are you free?

658
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:49,210
Is it arranged by them?

659
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:50,110
Yes.

660
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,710
I won't go.

661
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:23,350
Lin Xi?

662
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:25,310
Taking out the trash?

663
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:27,910
What are you doing?

664
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:29,630
Eating.

665
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:31,270
It's so cozy to eat at home.

666
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,870
Yicheng is waiting for me.

667
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:33,830
I'll go now.

668
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:41,270
Yicheng, it's me.

669
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:48,010
Sorry to keep you waiting.

670
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:49,430
What do you mean?

671
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:50,360
Why are you here?

672
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:51,870
We're supposed to shoot

673
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,070
your home life today,

674
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,150
but I only got a call

675
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,430
from the cameraman when I entered the neighborhood

676
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:58,160
that he couldn't come because something came up.

677
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,920
This house is quite old.

678
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:05,800
You probably can't rest well at night, right?

679
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,860
Yicheng, if you need it,

680
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,030
my friend has a large flat

681
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:10,910
that they're renting out.

682
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:11,550
No need.

683
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:14,430
Right.

684
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,470
The traffic is convenient here.

685
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:19,190
Are you done looking around?

686
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,800
Since we're not filming today,

687
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,110
I won't hold you up.

688
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,070
Old classmate,

689
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:32,510
even if we don't talk about business,

690
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:34,150
we can still catch up, right?

691
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:37,670
Please.

692
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,630
We've been classmates for ten years

693
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:41,510
and we were in the same club.

694
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:43,110
Is our friendship not enough

695
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:45,370
for us to eat lunch and chat on a Saturday?

696
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:46,470
Lin Xi,

697
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:51,110
Chen Xiao wants to catch up with us.

698
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:52,540
No need.

699
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,670
We've known each other for so long.

700
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,060
Is it not enough for us

701
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,390
to catch up together on a Saturday? Right?

702
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:02,150
Yes.

703
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:03,390
It's been a long time.

704
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:04,590
Let's do it together.

705
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,070
All right.

706
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,260
Let's eat.

707
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,070
Yicheng,

708
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:19,270
try this.

709
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:24,710
This is...

710
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:25,790
I begged my mom for a long time

711
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:27,390
before she agreed to make it.

712
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:31,590
Did your mom cook all these dishes?

713
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:32,750
Yes.

714
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:33,910
You should know

715
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:35,110
that my mom is a chairman.

716
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,640
She hasn't cooked in years.

717
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:37,830
Try it.

718
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:39,920
She hasn't lost her skills, right?

719
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:41,950
Thank her for me.

720
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:44,630
My mom often tells me

721
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,670
about the first time

722
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:47,110
you came to my house.

723
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:48,910
It was your first time eating drunken crab.

724
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,110
You thought it was raw

725
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:52,120
and insisted on getting it cooked.

726
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:56,470
Look at me.

727
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:57,870
Why do I keep talking about this?

728
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:58,830
Lin Xi didn't know you

729
00:38:58,830 --> 00:38:59,870
at that time.

730
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,270
It's okay.

731
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:03,910
I remember

732
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,970
you often came to my house for dinner.

733
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:09,290
Zhou Shuang and Li Jun were there too.

734
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:12,870
Here.

735
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,710
Try this.

736
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:18,600
This is appetizing.

737
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:22,480
-Try it.
-Thank you.

738
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:29,110
How is it?

739
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:36,570
Were these intestines

740
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:38,120
also cooked by your mom?

741
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:39,750
No.

742
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:41,470
This was by the owner of the small restaurant

743
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:43,150
outside our school.

744
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:44,350
Zhu?

745
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:46,170
Did you have it before too?

746
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:50,070
I did, occasionally.

747
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:51,870
Occasionally,

748
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:53,200
but you still remember?

749
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,810
Their intestines are quite special.

750
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:58,870
But isn't Zhu

751
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:00,270
not here anymore?

752
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:01,810
He came back a few days ago.

753
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:03,120
By the way, Yicheng,

754
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:04,510
Zhu invited us

755
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:05,590
to have dinner together.

756
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:07,590
He said he wanted to thank us

757
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:08,980
for being his first customers back then.

758
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:10,270
That time,

759
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:11,670
our club went there together.

760
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:13,190
There were more than ten people.

761
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:14,910
It was the soft opening.

762
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:16,280
Just the two of us went.

763
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:21,530
Let me show you something.

764
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:28,830
Zhu said it was this photo

765
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:30,760
that inspired him.

766
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:32,630
He said he wanted to build

767
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,360
a lover wall in the restaurant.

768
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:36,080
Do you remember this photo?

769
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:39,290
I have something to do.

770
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:40,270
You guys eat first.

771
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,870
I won't disturb you anymore.

772
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:50,790
Why did you say all of that

773
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:51,670
in front of her?

774
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:55,150
Weren't we catching up?

775
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:57,010
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

776
00:40:57,670 --> 00:41:00,330
What are you talking about? I don't understand.

777
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:01,750
You know that

778
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:02,990
I still have feelings for Lin Xi.

779
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:04,430
You said this on purpose

780
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:05,910
to separate us, right?

781
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:37,990
Chen Xiao, let me tell you.

782
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,150
I hope

783
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,390
you can understand one thing.

784
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:42,710
Even if I don't get back together with her,

785
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,150
it's impossible for us.

786
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:50,950
Am I

787
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:53,630
that bad in your eyes?

788
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:57,270
No.

789
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:59,710
But you just don't like me.

790
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:03,350
Chen Xiao,

791
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:05,790
loving someone

792
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:08,050
isn't just about loving their good side.

793
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:09,550
On the contrary,

794
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:10,430
when you love someone,

795
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:12,960
you may fall in love with their shortcomings.

796
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:14,510
In your eyes,

797
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:17,110
Lin Xi is someone who will

798
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:18,510
do anything for her goal,

799
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:20,470
but in my eyes,

800
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:23,270
she's very brave and moving.

801
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:30,110
Xiao Yicheng,

802
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:34,790
would we have ended up together

803
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:37,120
if I'd taken the initiative

804
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:39,850
and been braver back then?

805
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:41,950
How do you think

806
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:44,480
I should answer this hypothetical question?

807
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:46,390
But I only know

808
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:48,070
that if I'm braver

809
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:48,670
and take the initiative now,

810
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:50,150
I can get her back.

811
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:51,470
Understand?

812
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:20,150
[Tong Xin]

813
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:19,910
Call me back.

814
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:30,710
Hello.

815
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:33,950
Mr. Xiao, you finally picked up the phone.

816
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:35,670
Sorry.

817
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:36,920
I was busy just now.

818
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:39,870
I've checked the team building agenda.

819
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:40,910
There are no problems.

820
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:41,710
Xiao,

821
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:42,980
what if...

822
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:47,290
What if Lin Xi doesn't appreciate your efforts?

823
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,370
There are two types of love:

824
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:56,200
childhood sweethearts

825
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:57,950
and happily ever afters.

826
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:00,950
Lin Xi

827
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:03,990
is everything I know about love.

828
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:07,510
Xiao, you will succeed.

829
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:08,910
Thank you.

830
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:40,150
Mom,

831
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:42,070
are you missing Papa again?

832
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:43,190
Stop talking nonsense.

833
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:44,790
Have you memorized the idioms?

834
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:47,190
Today, we learned "the more one tries to hide, the more one reveals"

835
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:48,510
and "feint to the east while attacking the west."

836
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:50,030
It's like you.

837
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:53,310
I asked you to learn idioms

838
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:54,710
to learn more about Chinese culture,

839
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:56,510
not to tease your mom.

840
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:58,270
You changed the topic again.

841
00:44:58,350 --> 00:44:59,550
You don't understand adult business.

842
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:00,480
Go take a shower.

843
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:02,350
Mom, I have an online class.

844
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:04,590
Online class?

845
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:05,990
I've read the memo.

846
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:06,790
You finished

847
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:07,790
today's homework.

848
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:09,270
No, it's this one.

849
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,310
Cheng Yao's Italian class.

850
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:17,590
Okay.

851
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:18,670
Next is

852
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:19,790
today's last word.

853
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:20,980
It's "staying up late."

854
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:22,070
In Italian,

855
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:23,110
it's pronounced like this.

856
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:25,510
Bruciare l'olio di mezzanotte.

857
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:27,430
All right.

858
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:28,280
You can

859
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,390
read it with me.

860
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:30,030
Bruciare l'olio di mezzanotte.

861
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:31,550
Actually, learning Italian

862
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:32,430
is very simple.

863
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:33,270
It's not as complicated

864
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:34,150
as you think.

865
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:35,790
I recommend two

866
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:37,070
Italian cartoon

867
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:37,620
for beginners.

868
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:39,070
One is 44 Cats.

869
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:39,990
The other is

870
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:40,830
the Italian version

871
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:42,030
of Peppa Pig.

872
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,790
That's all for today.

873
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:46,310
Bruciare l'olio di mezzanotte.

874
00:45:47,470 --> 00:45:49,390
Tomorrow is German class.

875
00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:51,850
The day after tomorrow is Portuguese class.

876
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:52,670
Mom,

877
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:54,150
do you think

878
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:55,350
I'll be able to speak

879
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:56,510
a bunch of languages

880
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:57,680
like Cheng Yao?

881
00:45:57,950 --> 00:45:59,790
That would be great.

882
00:46:00,070 --> 00:46:01,390
But, son,

883
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,830
I don't remember signing you up

884
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:03,910
for this online class.

885
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:05,070
It's free.

886
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:05,990
Cheng Yao

887
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:07,630
even closed the tip function.

888
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:09,390
Mom, let me tell you secretly.

889
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:11,030
My English teacher, Ms. Zhou,

890
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:12,270
is also taking these classes.

891
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:13,270
Is it that great?
