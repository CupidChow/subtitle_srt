Auntie,

00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,790
go get more towels.

10
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,590
Okay, I'll go get it.

11
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:07,910
Mommy,

12
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:10,910
take these two books

13
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,030
for Grandpa to read.

14
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,830
Okay.

15
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:16,990
Shasha,

16
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,400
I have something to ask you.

17
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:26,870
Honey,

18
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,550
it was a mess today.

19
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,630
I haven't had a chance to ask you yet.

20
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,350
Why didn't you tell me earlier

21
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,270
about Xiao Yicheng and Lin Xi?

22
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,150
I wanted to tell you,

23
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,010
but you didn't give me the chance.

24
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,310
Besides,

25
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,950
it's over now.

26
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,470
How could it be over?

27
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,510
Just thinking about it makes me angry.

28
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,470
They are clearly a couple.

29
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,150
Lin Xi even came here

30
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,300
to expose it in public.

31
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,350
She clearly did it to embarrass us.

32
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,910
No wonder she's Gao Wenli's daughter.

33
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,990
Mommy, it's not like that.

34
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,950
Don't protect her.

35
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,230
I'm not protecting her.

36
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,590
Today, Xiao Yicheng

37
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,910
explained everything in public.

38
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,710
I thought he was quite manly.

39
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,470
Besides, Lin Xi didn't do anything wrong.

40
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,550
Yes,

41
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,230
Xiao Yicheng is really good.

42
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,830
What a pity.

43
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,630
How can he like Lin Xi?

44
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,430
Mommy.

45
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,390
Honey,

46
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,870
don't be sad.

47
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:19,670
No.

48
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,430
I'm fine.

49
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,910
I have no feelings for Xiao Yicheng.

50
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,350
You're excellent.

51
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,390
It's Xiao Yicheng's loss

52
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,710
that he won't date you.

53
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,910
We'll find a better candidate.

54
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,150
Mommy,

55
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:33,790
you don't have to

56
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:34,710
introduce me

57
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,110
to blind dates anymore.

58
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,590
Honey,

59
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,190
you're not young anymore.

60
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,790
You have to start searching.

61
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,430
I know

62
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,110
you young people

63
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,670
think blind dates are tacky,

64
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,710
but you've been studying abroad since you were young.

65
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,510
You don't know many people here.

66
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,590
I'm helping you

67
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,350
have more choices.

68
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,750
Try to get in touch with them.

69
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,829
I won't force you,

70
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,390
but don't restrict yourself.

71
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:01,270
Look and feel around, okay?

72
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,950
Mommy,

73
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,810
I was telling the truth last time.

74
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,360
I have a boyfriend.

75
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,750
You have a boyfriend?

76
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,710
Is he the guy

77
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:25,170
who made you get diarrhea from the barbecue?

78
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,830
But you can't blame him

79
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,950
for the diarrhea.

80
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,110
My stomach is weak.

81
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,270
What's his name?

82
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:36,650
What does he do?

83
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,200
His name is Wei Tian.

84
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,510
He's my colleague.

85
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,470
Colleague?

86
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,150
So, you two are in Huasheng?

87
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,430
Which department is he from?

88
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,310
What position?

89
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,770
The priority client management department

90
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,710
The priority client management department?

91
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,909
So, isn't he Lin Xi's subordinate?

92
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,550
He's very outstanding.

93
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,670
Honey,

94
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,350
I think

95
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,420
you should

96
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,430
think about this carefully.

97
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,950
Why?

98
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,550
He's very responsible

99
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,270
and treats me well.

100
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,550
Treating you well and being responsible

101
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,030
is not enough.

102
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,830
When two people date,

103
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:19,910
you can't just think about

104
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:20,750
the two of you.

105
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,790
There are two families.

106
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:25,000
Your families don't match at all.

107
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,390
How do we not match?

108
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,180
We're colleagues

109
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,670
and he's the translator manager.

110
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,350
Translator manager?

111
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,750
Honey,

112
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,230
is that worth mentioning?

113
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,110
You're opposing

114
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,310
because he's Lin Xi's subordinate.

115
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,190
That's one of the reasons.

116
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,230
Most importantly,

117
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,909
you are not from the same world.

118
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:48,909
You've never met him.

119
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:49,750
How can you

120
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,080
make such a conclusion?

121
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,550
I am

122
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,470
very happy with him.

123
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,310
Yes,

124
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,430
you're happy now,

125
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,750
because it's new.

126
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,630
When the freshness is over,

127
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,950
it will be torturous

128
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,270
for two people

129
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,630
with completely different living habits

130
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:09,070
to live together.

131
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,470
Alright.

132
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,670
I don't want to talk about this with you.

133
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,350
[Wei Tian]

134
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,550
Is it him?

135
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,270
No.

136
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:27,990
Mommy,

137
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,990
I know you're doing this for my good,

138
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,270
but you have to believe me.

139
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,130
Tian and I are not parallel lines.

140
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,230
We can cross

141
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,390
any gap.

142
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,470
Hello, Tian.

143
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,750
Yes, I'm free.

144
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,350
Then,

145
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,409
how about I take you to meet my friend?

146
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,430
Really?

147
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,630
Okay.

148
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,990
Maomao told me

149
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,550
there's a new dessert shop nearby.

150
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:49,430
It's quite delicious.

151
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,960
Why don't we eat something?

152
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:52,810
I'm not hungry.

153
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,630
Are you thirsty?

154
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,550
Let's go to the supermarket

155
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,610
and buy some water.

156
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:07,730
How about this?

157
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,470
I'll pick you up after work tomorrow.

158
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,330
Let's go visit Grandpa together.

159
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,430
I can drive myself there

160
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,230
after work.

161
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,430
Okay.

162
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:23,750
Xixi,

163
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,190
I’m sorry.

164
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,110
I was wrong.

165
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,070
Why are you sorry?

166
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,150
I shouldn't have

167
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,950
attended Professor Gao's birthday banquet

168
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:34,789
without letting you know

169
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:35,990
in advance.

170
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,070
I also shouldn't have

171
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:41,870
sat at Tan Shasha's table

172
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,230
and get set up with her for no reason.

173
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,020
The last thing I shouldn't have done

174
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,200
was to publicize my relationship with you so late,

175
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,330
causing such a big misunderstanding.

176
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,270
I'm the one who wasn't willing

177
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:53,830
to publicize things,

178
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,350
so it's my fault?

179
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:55,990
No,

180
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,400
that's not what I meant.

181
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,430
What I meant was

182
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:03,910
that I was wrong.

183
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,550
Please forgive me.

184
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,870
Let go.

185
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:08,790
No.

186
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:09,590
If you don't forgive me,

187
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,390
I won't let you go.

188
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,950
What should I forgive you for?

189
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,070
I never said

190
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:13,950
I was angry.

191
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:18,150
Am I that petty?

192
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:20,510
How can I be Mr. Xiao's girlfriend

193
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,550
if I don't have any confidence?

194
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,710
You just told me

195
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:25,310
you...

196
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:26,230
What did I say?

197
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,750
You're so tricky now, you know?

198
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,670
No, I'm not happy now.

199
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,190
I have to punish you.

200
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,240
We're in public.

201
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,300
What are you doing?

202
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,470
What's wrong with being in public?

203
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,600
♫An orange breeze blows through the dawn♫

204
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,020
I've made it public

205
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,550
that you're my girlfriend.

206
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,810
♫Happy poem verses blink♫

207
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,870
It's justifiable.

208
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,090
♫Yearning passes through seas♫

209
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,440
♫Sounds travel through me and you♫

210
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,740
♫Life's destiny♫

211
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,950
Young people nowadays

212
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,510
are so inappropriate.

213
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,350
This is not child-friendly.

214
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,590
Didi, let's go home.

215
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:13,990
Seriously.

216
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,030
Thank you.

217
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:24,280
Come on, let's have a late-night snack together.

218
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,390
Do you know about the book

219
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,970
The Full English Collection of Li Bai's Poetry?

220
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:47,900
I've heard of it.

221
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,750
I remember

222
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,470
it's your aunt's representative work, right?

223
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,610
It was actually translated by my mother.

224
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,830
She took three years

225
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:04,260
to figure out what words

226
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,030
could express the poems

227
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,190
more beautifully,

228
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,950
and what translation

229
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,710
would be more accurate.

230
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,750
Her whole postgraduate career

231
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,780
was spent on studying

232
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,310
how to translate this book.

233
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,230
Then why

234
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,990
did it become your aunt's work?

235
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,670
Because my Grandpa

236
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,930
didn't support my mom and dad dating,

237
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,600
but my mom firmly chose

238
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,710
my dad.

239
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:29,910
That's why her name

240
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:32,190
disappeared from this book.

241
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,510
But

242
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,150
in my impression,

243
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,200
Professor Gao shouldn't

244
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,270
do such a thing.

245
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,670
Besides, when you argued today

246
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,870
at the birthday banquet,

247
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:46,910
I felt that Professor Gao

248
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,440
had some unspoken reasons.

249
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,270
Is there

250
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,470
a misunderstanding?

251
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,260
I think

252
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:55,960
that if there's a chance,

253
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,750
you should investigate

254
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,110
what happened back then.

255
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,510
If there is really a misunderstanding,

256
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,430
don't let the gap between you widen further,

257
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,270
right?

258
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,400
More than 30 years have passed.

259
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,270
The end result is

260
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,240
my aunt won many awards

261
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,400
and she became famous in the translation industry.

262
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,130
For a translator,

263
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,270
stealing someone's work

264
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,270
is like stealing their life.

265
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,430
I understand.

266
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,620
So,

267
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,750
that's the source of the conflict

268
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,080
between your families.

269
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:30,790
Since I knew

270
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,990
about this,

271
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,470
I've been very angry

272
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,730
at my grandpa and aunt.

273
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,110
One of them

274
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,710
got honor from

275
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:39,620
stolen results.

276
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,510
The other

277
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,700
indulged this behavior

278
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,470
despite knowing

279
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,790
that it was wrong.

280
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,110
I understand.

281
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:48,990
I understand your anger.

282
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,590
But before today,

283
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,230
I always thought

284
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,430
that if I

285
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,030
truly faced

286
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,350
this matter one day,

287
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,070
I would be furious

288
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,370
and out of control,

289
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,080
but I didn't today.

290
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,830
That's because our Director Lin

291
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:11,470
has grown up and matured.

292
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,150
When I saw how my aunt

293
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:25,970
hid and avoided things today,

294
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,950
she seemed to have been arguing with me,

295
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,470
but it was more like

296
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,130
she was restricting herself.

297
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,460
I always thought

298
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,270
that she was very tough

299
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,630
and mean.

300
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,560
I didn't expect her to be like this.

301
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,590
For a moment,

302
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,870
I even thought it was laughable.

303
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,460
Actually,

304
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,270
she has always been living

305
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,870
under your mother's shadow.

306
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,310
She wanted to be

307
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:56,390
like your mother,

308
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,350
but she failed.

309
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,230
Can you believe it?

310
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,320
Actually,

311
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,190
I can understand her.

312
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,390
Why?

313
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,460
Because...

314
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:13,110
Because both of us

315
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,680
lived under someone's shadow.

316
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,470
I seem

317
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,790
to be against the Gao family,

318
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,630
but in my heart,

319
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,990
I've always wanted to be

320
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,070
like my grandpa

321
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,400
and become an excellent interpreter.

322
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,750
So, I was also

323
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,680
striving toward that excellency.

324
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,670
I must become a KPI Queen.

325
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,910
I must become

326
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:38,030
a well-rounded genius without shortcomings.

327
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,430
I didn't want to lose to Shasha

328
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:40,070
and I didn't want to

329
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,930
be looked down upon by my grandpa.

330
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,990
This was also a kind of shadow I lived under.

331
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,650
You've accomplished it already.

332
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:51,830
However,

333
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:54,030
I think I'm luckier than my aunt,

334
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,930
because I've walked out of it.

335
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,500
There's someone

336
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,110
who can give me a shoulder

337
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:01,710
to lean on when I'm sad,

338
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:04,270
and when I have setbacks,

339
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:05,630
he can help me

340
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,920
re-examine myself.

341
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,910
Even

342
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,030
when I lose him,

343
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:14,890
he's still willing to stay there and wait for me.

344
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,190
He told me

345
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:22,590
that I don't need to

346
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,360
stand under anyone's shadow.

347
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,550
I can be myself.

348
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:29,950
Don't worry.

349
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,920
No matter what,

350
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,030
I'll be here.

351
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,590
Who is it?

352
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,670
Hello, Mr. Cheng.

353
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:14,950
Ms. Tong coordinated with you

354
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,860
about the check-out, right?

355
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:18,870
She told me,

356
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:19,950
but I have a lot of stuff.

357
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,480
I need some time to move out.

358
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:22,310
Ms. Tong

359
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:23,350
is a VIP here.

360
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,030
We can provide

361
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,360
free packing services.

362
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,110
I don't need it.

363
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,550
I'm afraid you'll break my things.

364
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,910
Our staff

365
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:29,830
have all received

366
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:30,550
professional housekeeper training

367
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,630
and we promise

368
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:32,830
that if anything is damaged,

369
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,070
we will compensate

370
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:35,600
ten times the market price.

371
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:37,660
But the thing is,

372
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,350
it's already midnight.

373
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:38,990
I still have to call

374
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,110
a moving company.

375
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,510
You don't need to worry about that either.

376
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,670
We have car service

377
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,750
for our VIPs.

378
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,270
It'll be a one-stop service

379
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:48,470
to safely send you to your destination.

380
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,750
You want to leave? You can't do that so easily.

381
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,750
Pay for my Legos.

382
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,790
What Legos?

383
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,350
The limited edition

384
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,710
Harry Potter Hogwarts Castle

385
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:00,310
Lego model

386
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,790
that you broke.

387
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:05,270
I remember now.

388
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,510
It's that

389
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,430
limited edition

390
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:09,710
Harry Potter Hogwarts Castle, right?

391
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:10,310
Yes.

392
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,990
Don't think of escaping before you fix it for me.

393
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,510
Fine.

394
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,550
I won’t leave if I don't help you finish it.

395
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:15,230
Mr. Cheng,

396
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,670
but today is

397
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,069
the last day to check out.

398
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:20,829
I want the Harry Potter Lego model!

399
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:22,109
Make up for my Legos!

400
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:23,510
Don’t think of escaping if you don’t!

401
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,670
I spent a whole month

402
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:26,710
building that Lego model!

403
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:27,869
-How about...
-Make up for my Legos!

404
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:28,790
Make up for my Legos!

405
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:29,340
You help him build it.

406
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,030
Me?

407
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:30,670
Yes.

408
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:32,110
I have to pack up.

409
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:32,910
Today is the last day

410
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:33,670
to check out today, right?

411
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:35,750
I want the Harry Potter Lego set!

412
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,550
Mr. Cheng,

413
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:39,350
the timing isn't that strict.

414
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:40,310
How about

415
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,430
you comfort Peter first?

416
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:43,070
Don't think of escaping if you don't pay!

417
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:43,950
Comfort him?

418
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,030
Please.

419
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:45,850
Well...

420
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,470
Make up for my Legos!

421
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:50,200
-Fine.
-Don't think of escaping if you don't pay!

422
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:52,030
Don't cry, Peter.

423
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,110
-Make up for my Legos!
-Stop crying.

424
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,830
Make up for my Legos!

425
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,830
Is it Ms. Tong?

426
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:05,830
What do you think?

427
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:08,110
I'm smart, right?

428
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:10,470
I knew you didn't want to leave.

429
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,870
I just didn't find a house yet.

430
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,000
Really?

431
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,350
What else could it be?

432
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:19,910
I thought

433
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:22,110
you couldn't bear to leave me and my mom.

434
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:23,870
Am I

435
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,110
that sentimental?

436
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:27,550
Forget it then.

437
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,030
What?

438
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,390
I wanted to sacrifice

439
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,230
my beloved

440
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,630
Hogwarts Castle for you.

441
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:35,830
Now,

442
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,310
I'll call my mommy's secretary

443
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,510
and he'll find you a place to go tonight.

444
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:40,670
Forget it.

445
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,310
I'm just afraid you'll miss me

446
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,230
if I leave.

447
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,630
I will miss you all.

448
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:48,990
Really?

449
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,030
Of course.

450
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,350
Then, will you sacrifice

451
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,030
Hogwarts today?

452
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,150
Fine.

453
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:12,670
She's coming.

454
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,350
Eyedrops!

455
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,390
Here.

456
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,790
Mom.

457
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:23,670
Mom!

458
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,670
He destroyed

459
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:26,710
my Harry Potter castle.

460
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:29,430
He's running away now.

461
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,350
Peter,

462
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,350
Cheng Yao is not running away.

463
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,950
The lease expired.

464
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:34,710
I don't care.

465
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,470
I've worked hard for a whole month.

466
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:38,600
He can't leave until he finishes this.

467
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:39,830
Well...

468
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,350
I knocked down the castle by accident.

469
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,030
I'll take responsibility.

470
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,110
Stop messing around.

471
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,710
I can help you with the Legos.

472
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:49,630
Tong Xin,

473
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,630
let me work on the castle.

474
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,350
He's just a kid.

475
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,590
Don't worry about it.

476
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,710
The Legos aren't

477
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,010
the only things I worry about.

478
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,470
Papa.

479
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:26,020
-What's wrong?
-Aunt Xixi.

480
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:26,750
What's wrong?

481
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,350
Please talk to my mom

482
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,990
Cheng Yao broke

483
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:30,900
my Lego model.

484
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,590
My mom wants to kick

485
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,030
Cheng Yao out.

486
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,390
Stop crying.

487
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,390
What happened?

488
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,470
The lease expired.

489
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,390
I asked for Cheng Yao's opinion

490
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:43,310
and canceled the lease,

491
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,670
but Peter insist that Cheng Yao

492
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:45,270
build the Lego model,

493
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,350
wasting his time.

494
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:48,430
If you insist on saying that,

495
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,310
I'll just go home.

496
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,430
Grandma Li

497
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,470
already rented out your room.

498
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,110
Rented out?

499
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:02,790
How come I...

500
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:03,670
Yes.

501
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,030
We thought

502
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,350
you wouldn't live there anymore

503
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,470
because you didn't come back for so long.

504
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:08,600
So she rented it out.

505
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:16,630
What should I do?

506
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:18,630
I have to terminate the lease today.

507
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:20,800
Then I can only sleep on the street.

508
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,710
It's quite cold outside today.

509
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,230
Wear more clothes when you go out.

510
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,290
Don't catch a cold.

511
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,590
Mom.

512
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:34,390
Will Cheng Yao be in danger?

513
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:36,350
Don't drive Cheng Yao away.

514
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:39,270
But

515
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,790
the room where Cheng Yao lives

516
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:41,680
is your papa's.

517
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,110
The lease is up now.

518
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,510
There's nothing I can do.

519
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,030
That's easy.

520
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,230
I rented the room.

521
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,150
I'll renew the lease.

522
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:52,070
Xiao.

523
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,390
Currently, Yuyi and Huasheng

524
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,910
are in a period of close cooperation.

525
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:57,750
Cheng Yao

526
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,670
is an important member

527
00:21:58,670 --> 00:21:59,470
of both teams.

528
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,820
He has nowhere to go now.

529
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,350
As the boss of Yuyi,

530
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:04,590
I have to help him.

531
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:08,870
Mr. Xiao.

532
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,240
How generous of you.

533
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:21,430
Cheng Yao won't leave.

534
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:23,590
Cheng Yao stays here.

535
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,390
This number has been updated.

536
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:28,190
Sign here

537
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,710
after you confirm that there's no problem.

538
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:30,840
Have you checked it?

539
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:34,870
Thank you.

540
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,270
You like Tong Xin?

541
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,310
Don't talk nonsense.

542
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,270
Well...

543
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:48,430
Yuyi and Huasheng are cooperating with each other.

544
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:49,990
She's

545
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:51,270
kind of my boss.

546
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,970
I'm doing this for work.

547
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,430
For work. Right.

548
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:55,750
Okay.

549
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,470
I'll tell Tong Xin

550
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,630
Grandma Li's house

551
00:22:58,630 --> 00:22:59,660
isn't rented out.

552
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,350
Don't bother.

553
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:04,750
I can tell her later.

554
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,710
Are you willing to say it?

555
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:09,470
Of course.

556
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:17,110
Is it that obvious?

557
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,230
When you asked for money

558
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,630
to buy jade,

559
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:23,870
I guessed it.

560
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,790
But I always feel

561
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,810
that she's hiding something.

562
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,870
We're done here.

563
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,030
Let's go home.

564
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,110
Bye-bye.

565
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:47,190
I'll go back now.

566
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:47,790
Bye-bye.

567
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,030
Let's go.

568
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:01,550
What happened just now?

569
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:02,670
You did it on purpose?

570
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:04,270
Didn't you also help him?

571
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,150
You've made it so obvious.

572
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,270
I'm not stupid.

573
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:13,070
I think Cheng Yao is good.

574
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,590
Peter likes him too.

575
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:17,470
He and Tong Xin are a good match.

576
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:22,750
I don't know.

577
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,310
Tong Xin was hurt before.

578
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:26,870
It's not easy for her

579
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:28,470
to start a new relationship.

580
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,210
She has many concerns.

581
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,830
Cheng Yao

582
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,920
is too naive in this regard.

583
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:40,150
But I think

584
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,030
he can heal Tong Xin.

585
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,950
But

586
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,990
he has a difficult hurdle to solve.

587
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,390
Mom.

588
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,110
Son.

589
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,340
How is Professor Gao?

590
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:29,070
He's out of danger.

591
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:31,750
He just needs to stay in the hospital for observation for a few days.

592
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,000
He's fine. Don't worry.

593
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,680
[Mic on] [Speaker on] [Camera on]

594
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:35,190
What a mess.

595
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:37,390
How should I face Gao Ling in the future?

596
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:40,070
It was your fault for insisting on

597
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,590
finding a girlfriend for Yicheng.

598
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:42,780
Blame yourself.

599
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:46,340
[Mic on] [Speaker on] [Camera on]

600
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,270
It was your son's fault.

601
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:46,470
Fine. Blame me. Blame me.

602
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:47,070
Blame me.

603
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,590
Look at you.

604
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:50,270
You hid everything

605
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,750
and didn't even tell us.

606
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,510
What's going on between

607
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:55,950
you and Lin Xi?

608
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:57,710
When did you start?

609
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:00,190
Mom, you have many questions.

610
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:00,750
I...

611
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:03,110
I don't know how to explain.

612
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:05,050
I'll tell you in detail some other day.

613
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:10,110
[Mic on] [Speaker on] [Camera on]

614
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:06,780
Some other day?

615
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,070
When is it?

616
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,870
If you don't tell me the date,

617
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,600
you won't be allowed to hang up.

618
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:13,990
Next week.

619
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:14,920
Next week, okay?

620
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,110
Okay.

621
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:18,370
I'll interrogate you some other day.

622
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:19,950
Okay.

623
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:52,830
Shasha.

624
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:53,950
Shasha.

625
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:55,190
Shasha.

626
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,910
It's sunny. Take an umbrella.

627
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,510
No, Auntie Wang.

628
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:01,230
My bag is too small.

629
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,480
Take it.

630
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,030
Otherwise, you'll get dermatitis again.

631
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,000
You'll feel bad.

632
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,110
Auntie Wang.

633
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,510
Kids nowadays

634
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:09,310
don't listen to adults.

635
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:10,710
Auntie Wang.

636
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:11,830
I'm really fine.

637
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,470
I'm going to meet friends,

638
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,030
not to sunbathe.

639
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:15,920
I'm leaving.

640
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,750
Aren't you taking me to see your friends?

641
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,030
Why are we here?

642
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,110
Yes.

643
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:31,590
This

644
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,030
is our

645
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:33,790
secret base.

646
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:36,470
Shasha.

647
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,740
I'm

648
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,830
a very simple person.

649
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:42,270
In addition to work,

650
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,150
I usually play basketball

651
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,350
with my friends here.

652
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:45,960
On this playground,

653
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,350
all my best friends in Xiahai

654
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,310
are here.

655
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,710
Now I'm with you.

656
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,310
So

657
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:54,550
I want to introduce you

658
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,830
to them.

659
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,430
Let's go.

660
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,390
Tian.

661
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:03,070
Hurry!

662
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:05,270
He brought someone here.

663
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:08,750
Tian, good for you.

664
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,070
He brought someone here.

665
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:10,830
No.

666
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,590
Let me introduce.

667
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,710
This is Long.

668
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:14,960
This is Lei.

669
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,710
Xin and Zhuren.

670
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:17,750
That is Haoke.

671
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:18,310
Hello.

672
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:20,310
My girlfriend, Tan Shasha.

673
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:22,630
Hello, just call me Shasha.

674
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:24,430
Hello, Shasha.

675
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:24,910
Shasha.

676
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:26,110
Hello, Shasha.

677
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,180
Call her Sister-in-law.

678
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,750
I heard a lot about you from Wei.

679
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,590
I finally saw you today.

680
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,310
My name is Xin.

681
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,150
I'm 18 years old.

682
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:33,790
I'm still single.

683
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:34,710
What can I...

684
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:37,190
Go away. Are you going to play or not?

685
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,510
Let's go. We'll play first.

686
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,150
We'll play first.

687
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,030
Hurry up. We'll wait for you.

688
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:40,710
Hurry up.

689
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,630
Shasha.

690
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,590
Don't mind them.

691
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,550
They're always like this.

692
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:46,550
They're not serious.

693
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:47,430
It's okay.

694
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:50,560
It's normal for good friends to make jokes at each other.

695
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,670
Let's go over there.

696
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:53,510
Let's go.

697
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,040
How about you stand here?

698
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,270
There's water in my bag.

699
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,870
Drink some if you're thirsty.

700
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:05,510
Okay.

701
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:14,030
If you're afraid of the sun,

702
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:16,590
put this on.

703
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,190
Tian.

704
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:22,990
Is your girlfriend afraid of the sun?

705
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:23,950
No way.

706
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:24,670
Our parties

707
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:25,510
are basically

708
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,550
under the sun every day.

709
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:27,990
You need to get used to it.

710
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:28,950
You go first.

711
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,150
Okay. Tian, hurry up.

712
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:36,070
It's okay. Go.

713
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,270
I'll watch you here.

714
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:40,830
I'll go first.

715
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,640
There's water in my bag.

I just feel a little hot.

734
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,470
I'm gonna stop playing.

735
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,270
Guys,

736
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,670
I'm gonna call it a day.

737
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:12,750
I'm gonna go back first.

738
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:14,310
Well, what's going on?

739
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,200
It's only been a while.

740
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,310
We finally have a chance to get together.

741
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,430
-You're leaving so soon.
-That's right.

742
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:20,430
I... I'll treat you to dinner later.

743
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,720
No, Tian.

744
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,870
Go play with them.

745
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:25,130
I can go buy a bottle of cold water myself.

746
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:27,760
Ignore them.

747
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:30,590
Shasha,

748
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,990
don't forget to set me up with a girlfriend.

749
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:36,000
Remember to treat us to hotpot.

750
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,820
Hotpot.

751
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:37,390
Hotpot.

752
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:38,470
And my girlfriend.

753
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:40,870
Let's go. Come on.

754
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,070
One. One.

755
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,470
Come on, let's continue.

756
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:01,540
Shasha.

757
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,070
I'm sorry.

758
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,990
I was thoughtless today.

759
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:06,710
If I come to play basketball in the future,

760
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:07,950
you don't have to accompany me.

761
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:09,230
No, it's because

762
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:11,150
I forgot to bring my parasol today.

763
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:12,710
It'll be fine if I bring my parasol next time.

764
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:14,270
It's okay. Don't bother.

765
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:16,330
You really don't have to come with me.

766
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,750
Sorry, Tian.

767
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,750
I've ruined your fun.

768
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:23,160
You were complained by them because of me.

769
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:23,910
It's okay.

770
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,230
They are single.

771
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,560
They don't understand.

772
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:28,190
Be good.

773
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:38,990
Shasha.

774
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:41,110
What are you doing?

775
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:41,990
Mommy.

776
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:11,360
Don't scratch them.

777
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:18,949
Look at you.

778
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:34,730
Now you know it hurts, huh?

779
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:38,310
So why didn't you take precautions?

780
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:41,469
It was an accident today.

781
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:42,880
What is an accident?

782
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,590
Some accidents

783
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,750
are inevitable.

784
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,510
Some accidents happen

785
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:48,170
because of our carelessness.

786
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,310
Look at you.

787
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:53,350
You know clearly

788
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:55,190
you have photodermatitis.

789
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:57,230
You will have an allergy.

790
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:00,510
You care so much about him.

791
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:01,770
Does he care about you?

792
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:03,230
Mommy,

793
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,790
I just want to apply some ointment.

794
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:06,350
Can we not talk about this?

795
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:09,790
Fine.

796
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,810
I'm not gonna talk about this.

797
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:13,990
Anyway,

798
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:15,590
you have chosen this path yourself.

799
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:16,750
Even if you come back crying

800
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:17,870
in the end,

801
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:20,110
this is also your choice.

802
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,380
This month,

803
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,710
the interpretation department

804
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:42,710
did a good job.

805
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:45,370
Director Lu, I hope you can keep up the good work.

806
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:47,160
Mr. Zhang, I won't let you down.

807
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,500
The minority language department,

808
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,510
many universities recently

809
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:53,310
recommended a number

810
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:54,350
of outstanding graduates.

811
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:56,060
You should seize the chance

812
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:58,270
to recruit some new employees,

813
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:00,610
especially Arabic translators.

814
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:09,910
I always believe

815
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:11,150
gold

816
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,710
glitters wherever it is.

817
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:13,750
So,

818
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:15,750
I'm gonna praise Team 3 of the translation department.

819
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:16,880
They have done a great job

820
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,410
in a few projects recently.

821
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,520
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

822
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,400
[Huasheng's Weekly Meeting]

823
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:23,350
I heard

824
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:24,710
she made the zombie team

825
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:25,560
alive again.

826
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:27,670
This is what a she-devil is like.

827
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,390
She can make a comeback at any time.

828
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:30,150
That's right.

829
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:30,910
Maybe

830
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:33,630
she will return to the priority client management department soon.

831
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:35,110
Alright.

832
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,000
Lin Xi,

833
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,530
stand up and say something.

834
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,650
Actually, I think I'm very lucky.

835
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,500
[Huasheng's Weekly Meeting]

836
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:46,060
In my team,

837
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,430
I have outstanding translators

838
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:48,790
like Mr. Xu, Meihua,

839
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,150
and Ling Feng.

840
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:52,310
Actually, I just

841
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,300
made the best of their advantages

842
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,510
to maximize the function

843
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:57,790
of Team 3 of the translation department.

844
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:59,630
I didn't do anything else.

845
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:02,070
I remember when I graduated,

846
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:04,230
I received a message

847
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,180
from my mentor.

848
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:08,150
No matter what role you are in,

849
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,150
you must

850
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,810
be responsible for your work.

851
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:12,310
No matter what you do,

852
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:15,350
make sure your boss can rest assured and sleep well.

853
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:16,100
Mr. Zhang,

854
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,270
you must

855
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:20,000
have had nothing to worry about recently, right?

856
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,430
Thanks to you,

857
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:22,830
I've been sleeping well.

858
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:25,550
Alright.

859
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:26,790
Listen,

860
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,670
everyone, if you work hard,

861
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:30,030
I will make sure you'll be satisfied

862
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,350
with the bonuses at the end of the year.

863
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:31,990
Okay?

864
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:33,750
-Okay.
-Okay.

865
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,110
Hello?

866
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:43,710
This is the first time

867
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:44,990
our team has been praised in a meeting.

868
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:46,310
I feel so proud.

869
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:47,990
With Lin Xi being our team leader,

870
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:50,470
we will receive a lot of this kind of praise in the future.

871
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,350
But

872
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:53,270
I hope Mr. Zhang

873
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:55,180
can give us more bonuses.

874
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:59,350
Honor can't be tied to money.

875
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:01,990
But honor without money as a reward

876
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:03,070
is useless.

877
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:03,990
This...

878
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:08,620
Mr. Zhang,

879
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:11,610
the interpretation department made a mistake.

880
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,870
Lin Xi,

881
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,990
come to my office

882
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,890
[Huasheng's Weekly Meeting]

883
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:20,180
after the meeting.

884
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:22,630
Mr. Zhang,

885
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:23,670
I have an audio conference

886
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:24,830
with a client

887
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:25,630
in 20 minutes.

888
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:27,430
No hurry.

889
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:30,230
I have something to tell you.

890
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,800
I decided to deduct your year-end bonuses

891
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,110
when I issued the job transfer announcement.

892
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:35,830
I think it was unfair.

893
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:37,710
Later, I'll submit an application to the headquarters

894
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:39,640
to restore your year-end bonuses.

895
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,710
I don't think it's appropriate

896
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:47,670
to change the company's rules randomly.

897
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:48,670
Besides,

898
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:50,910
it's my duty to guide Team 3

899
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:52,270
to do a good job.

900
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:54,600
You don't have to make an exception for me.

901
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:56,430
The rules are made by people.

902
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:57,550
We can be flexible.

903
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,030
Team 3 is already

904
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,430
on the right track.

905
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:02,270
I think

906
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:03,480
you can hand over your work

907
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,350
to Mr. Xu.

908
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:05,670
I have another task

909
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:06,750
for you.

910
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:08,270
Another task?

911
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:11,230
I need you to help Lu Keli

912
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:13,150
deal with some emergencies.

913
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:23,230
Mr. Zhang, here is the thing.

914
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:24,990
Mr. Xu is old.

915
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:26,510
Meihua will give birth soon.

916
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:28,230
Ling Feng is still like a child.

917
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,320
He can't deal with everything properly.

918
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,070
I think

919
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:31,350
Team 3 still needs me.

920
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:32,750
Besides,

921
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:33,790
I was transferred there

922
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:35,430
because I made a mistake at work

923
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:37,070
back then.

924
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,230
Now,

925
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:39,190
you want to transfer me again from the translation department

926
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:41,110
in such a short time.

927
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,710
It can't convince everyone easily, right?

928
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:46,470
If you transfer me, the company's transfer order

929
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:47,830
will be a joke, right?

930
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:48,910
Ms. Lin,

931
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:50,030
as a subordinate,

932
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:51,960
you should obey Mr. Zhang's order.

933
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:54,830
Why are you deliberately making an excuse?

934
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:58,410
Mr. Zhang, I really don't have much time.

935
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:59,470
I know.

936
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:02,070
Don't make any excuse in front of me.

937
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:03,360
I've guided you for so many years.

938
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,350
I know you well.

939
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:04,990
All right.

940
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:06,310
If you have any requirement, just tell me.

941
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:07,710
Don't stand on ceremony.

942
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:08,790
Mr. Zhang.

943
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:16,190
The task Mr. Zhang mentioned

944
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:20,070
is to help Director Lu

945
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:21,670
with Yuyi's project, right?

946
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:23,150
It's your fault.

947
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,210
Tell her yourself.

948
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:30,670
When the interpretation department

949
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,790
was handling Yuyi's prospectus,

950
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:34,830
they made a small mistake.

951
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:35,950
A small mistake?

952
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:38,620
It should be "overlook nothing",

953
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,820
but they translated it as "do nothing".

954
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:44,030
They mistranslated "overlook nothing"

955
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:46,070
as "do nothing"?

956
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:48,270
Besides,

957
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:49,510
everyone

958
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:50,840
in the interpretation department's WeChat group

959
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,150
knows this now.

960
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,710
Someone even shared the chat history

961
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:55,470
as gossip.

962
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:56,350
Now everyone in the industry

963
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:57,710
is laughing at us.

964
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:58,790
Mr. Zhang,

965
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:00,710
I promise

966
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:03,060
this kind of thing will never happen again.

967
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,430
I'll be very cautious in the future.

968
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:06,070
Enough.

969
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:07,590
It's too late

970
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:08,520
to say anything.

971
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,670
Lin Xi,

972
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:12,630
you made the biggest contribution

973
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:14,230
to Yuyi's project.

974
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:15,910
Whether it's the preliminary investigation

975
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:17,310
or the follow-up work,

976
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:20,530
you've put a lot of effort into this project.

977
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:21,710
I believe

978
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:23,230
you don't want this project

979
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,960
to end like this either, right?

980
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:27,190
Mr. Zhang,

981
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:28,830
I'm gonna be late for my audio conference.

982
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:29,790
Besides,

983
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:31,270
Yuyi's project

984
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:32,670
is not mine.

985
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:33,550
It belongs to Huasheng.

986
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:34,550
So it will never

987
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:35,390
end like this.

988
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:36,710
It's not up to me.

989
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:37,550
Right?

990
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:39,750
-Mr. Zhang, this...
-Come back.

991
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,020
Lin Xi,

992
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:43,110
what's the hurry?

993
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:48,480
What are you looking at, Lu?

994
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:49,790
You can leave now.

995
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,370
Should I leave?

996
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:52,270
No.

997
00:41:58,630 --> 00:41:59,150
Sit.

998
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:01,190
Sit.

999
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:09,150
He has left.

1000
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:11,790
We just put on a show

1001
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:13,190
in front of him.

1002
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:14,270
Lu must be

1003
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:15,270
very anxious now.

1004
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,710
If you have any requirement, just tell me.

1005
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:18,830
Whatever it is,

1006
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:19,950
as long as I can do it,

1007
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:22,190
I'll do my best to meet your requirement.

1008
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:23,510
You said it

1009
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:25,230
like I'm taking advantage of you.

1010
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:26,000
How about this?

1011
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,550
I will approve

1012
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:28,320
all the applications you submitted before.

1013
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:28,990
For example,

1014
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:30,840
Xu Jiangnan has applied for a translation assistant,

1015
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,390
and Chen Meihua has applied for a mother-and-baby room.

1016
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:33,630
I will approve all of them.

1017
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:34,430
Okay?

1018
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:40,150
Huasheng has never

1019
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:42,270
approved any application for personal purposes.

1020
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:43,990
I'm doing this for your sake.

1021
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:46,310
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

1022
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:49,990
You've agreed to approve the applications voluntarily.

1023
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:51,920
I didn't make it difficult for you.

1024
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:57,150
If it were in the past,

1025
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,990
you definitely wouldn't have agreed to help Lu.

1026
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:01,630
You would have asked me

1027
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:03,430
to make you in charge of this project.

1028
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:05,030
What changed you?

1029
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:11,110
I've been a nit-picker for so many years.

1030
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:12,770
I also want to be a good person.

1031
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:14,110
You naughty guy.

1032
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:16,550
In the past,

1033
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:18,550
the KPI was the only thing that mattered to me.

1034
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:19,790
That kind of value

1035
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:20,870
is too shallow.

1036
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:23,030
Now I think

1037
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:25,630
what I can gain

1038
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:26,470
from my work

1039
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:27,790
and the feeling of being at ease

1040
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:28,830
gained from teamwork

1041
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:30,160
are the most important.

1042
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:33,440
I've become maturer, right?

1043
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,390
Yes.

1044
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:35,190
I'm going back to work.

1045
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:35,870
Okay.
