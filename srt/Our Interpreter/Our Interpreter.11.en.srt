Mr. Cheng Yao is so warm-hearted.

8
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,050
People might think

9
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,550
that he's chasing Lin Xi.

10
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,790
Xi, are you okay?

11
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,190
Mr. Xiao.

12
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,750
Cheng Yao is like my brother.

13
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,210
Please don't joke around.

14
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:17,750
Like a brother?

15
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,350
I misunderstood. I'm sorry.

16
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,670
They're not blood related anyway.

Mao,

19
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,590
I think you're right.

20
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:42,790
Cheng Yao.

21
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:44,750
I know that you've been

22
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,210
unhappy with Xiao Yicheng

23
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,350
because of the video online.

24
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,350
But he's our client now.

25
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,550
Keep it down.

26
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,470
Xiao,

27
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,950
I see you being strategic every day.

28
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:57,550
I didn't expect

29
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,110
to see such a childish side.

30
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:01,700
Xi,

31
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,400
I heard you fell sick a few days ago.

32
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,270
Are you okay?

33
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:05,350
Yes.

34
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,810
Have you taken your medicine?

35
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,590
What medicine?

36
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,550
Wasn't Lin Xi sick?

37
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,190
I sent her some medicine

38
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,650
using a delivery service.

39
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,790
So all those medicine was from him?

40
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,010
Including the hemorrhoid cream?

41
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,710
Mr. Xiao, you are so warm.

42
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,790
I'm so happy

43
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:44,230
to have a client like you.

44
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,550
So it's from Mr. Xiao.

45
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,180
Mr. Xiao is so nice.

46
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,550
We were discussing

47
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,470
in the work chat

48
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,560
if it was sent by

49
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,910
an admirer of Xi.

50
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:05,710
Mr. Xiao,

51
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,350
I have a question.

52
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,670
My reporter friend

53
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:12,910
who asked about

54
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,440
your love life previously,

55
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,390
she asked me to ask you another question.

56
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,149
Here's the thing.

57
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:18,310
We hope that

58
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,110
the public can put their focus

59
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,149
on Yuyi's products,

60
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:21,740
instead of

61
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,070
Mr. Xiao's love life.

62
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:23,990
It's okay.

63
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:24,750
Sorry.

64
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:25,670
It's okay.

65
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,070
Go ahead.

66
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,640
Thank you, Mr. Xiao.

67
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,390
Mr. Xiao.

68
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,860
I've been with you for so many years.

69
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,659
I've never heard you mention it.

70
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,670
Tell me.

71
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,830
Actually,

72
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,790
I went abroad

73
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:44,040
because of…

74
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,070
her.

75
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,550
It's actually because

76
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,990
she thought that I was not good enough,

77
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,550
so she left me.

78
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:02,550
Uncle—

79
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,150
No.

80
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:05,190
Mr. Xiao.

81
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,390
So you are the one who got dumped.

82
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:09,870
If she knows

83
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,330
how excellent you are now,

84
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,160
she will definitely regret it.

85
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,310
Well, Mr. Xiao,

86
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,070
do you still like your ex-girlfriend?

87
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,230
Well...

88
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,510
Mr. Xiao,

89
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,230
never rekindle an old flame.

90
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,680
What's wrong with that?

91
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,000
Maybe there's a story behind

92
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,860
why you broke up

93
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,270
in the first place?

94
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,030
Really?

95
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,150
Of course.

96
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,670
Go get her back.

97
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,350
She might be waiting for you.

98
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,710
You mean

99
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,630
she's still waiting for me?

100
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,430
Maybe.

101
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,790
Mr. Xiao, have you asked

102
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:48,590
if she is single now?

103
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,590
As far as I know, yes.

104
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:53,750
Look.

105
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,310
She's still single after 8 years.

106
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,470
Who says she isn't waiting for you?

107
00:05:58,470 --> 00:05:59,040
Go back

108
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,370
and rekindle the flame.

109
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,070
Mr. Xiao,

110
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,670
although I'm not pleased

111
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:03,630
that she dumped you,

112
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,120
but if you really want to get her back,

113
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,230
I'll support you.

114
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,270
Cheng Yao,

115
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,520
Let me ask you a question.

116
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,070
What do I have to do

117
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,120
to get her back?

118
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:17,980
Well.

119
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:20,150
Write letters, send flowers,

120
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,750
bring her shopping, or to the movies—

121
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,420
Cheng Yao.

122
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,790
Shut up.

123
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,470
It has nothing to do with you.

124
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,670
Well, Mr. Xiao

125
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,830
wants to pursue love.

126
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,230
I have to help him.

127
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,940
As an outsider,

128
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,110
we should stay out of

129
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,310
Mr. Xiao's love life.

130
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,390
How are you an outsider?

131
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,170
We need to work in depth in the future.

132
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,560
You're not an outsider.

133
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:47,950
Stop while you're ahead.

134
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,270
I'll go get something.

135
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:49,990
Me too.

136
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,310
Are you okay?

137
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:04,590
Women like romance.

138
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,510
It's better to revisit old places.

139
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,500
It's been eight years.

140
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,510
A fresh start would be better.

141
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,770
What's the use of revisiting old places?

142
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:12,990
You guys know so much.

143
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:16,790
Hurry up.

144
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,190
I'm so full.

145
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:27,790
Let me drive.

146
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,110
It's on my way.

147
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:31,630
Do you want to come with me?

148
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:32,960
No, I'll give her a ride.

149
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:33,950
Bye.

150
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,040
Get in.

151
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:53,630
Do you want to go

152
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,800
skateboarding tonight?

153
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,600
I'll call Liuliu and the others.

154
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:58,950
I still think

155
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,150
handstands are more stress relieving.

156
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,750
You like handstands too?

157
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,390
Too?

158
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,350
Yes.

159
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,470
Lin Xi likes handstands too.

160
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:08,990
But I think handstands

161
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,120
will cause blood to pool to your brain.

162
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,870
I don't think it's good.

163
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:11,870
Don't do handstands anymore.

164
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,000
How old-fashioned.

165
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,070
Lin Xi, what do you think?

166
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,190
It's not bad.

167
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:28,590
Cheng Yao.

168
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,230
I don't blame you for thinking that it's old-fashioned.

169
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,350
It's been 10 years

170
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,950
since I taught my ex-girlfriend

171
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,630
to do handstands to relieve stress.

172
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,510
Ten years ago,

173
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,840
were you taking your middle school exams?

174
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,470
Mr. Xiao,

175
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:40,600
why do you like to

176
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,030
mention your ex so much?

177
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:42,789
Do I?

178
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:43,510
No.

179
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:44,750
What do you mean no?

180
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,010
He's already mentioned her twice today.

181
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:50,630
Cheng Yao,

182
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:51,870
I think

183
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,380
you were right.

184
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,310
I should try my best to win her again.

185
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,150
Maybe

186
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:56,740
we might be able

187
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,910
to reunite.

188
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,390
I'm glad you understand.

189
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,790
What do you think, Lin Xi?

190
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,120
I don't think so.

191
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:34,990
Here's your key.

192
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,880
Mr. Xiao, may I have a word with you?

193
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,830
I know I’m not qualified

194
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:50,230
to meddle with your freedom of speech.

195
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:51,750
But I hope that you will

196
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,220
stop misleading everyone with your words.

197
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:53,910
Okay?

198
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,270
Sorry.

199
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,510
If my rejection earlier

200
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:08,270
hurt you,

201
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,350
I apologize.

202
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,270
But I hope that—

203
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:11,950
I know.

204
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,670
I'll keep my courting

205
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:16,920
private from now on.

206
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,250
Anything else?

207
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:28,750
Do you think

208
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,630
Mr. Xiao is a little strange?

209
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,200
What?

210
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,230
He kept talking about

211
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,360
his ex-girlfriend.

212
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:37,830
Does he

213
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:38,870
want us to convey his messages

214
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:39,510
through us

215
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,510
to his ex-girlfriend

216
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,830
and make her sorry?

217
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,710
Cheng Yao.

218
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:47,990
I...

219
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,150
am Xiao Yicheng's ex-girlfriend.

220
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:22,750
Mr. Xiao,

221
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:25,080
our coffee is ready.

222
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,630
Stop grinding it.

223
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,190
You're not a grinder.

224
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,620
You once told me that

225
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,430
successful women fall in love

226
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,350
with younger men easier, right?

227
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:43,950
Tell me more.

228
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,270
It's been a long time.

229
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,670
You still remember this?

230
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,870
Didn’t you see what

231
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,160
Cheng Yao did today?

232
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:54,900
Haven't you always

233
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,830
disregarded him as your opponent,

234
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:57,230
and felt very confident?

235
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,190
He's definitely no match for me.

236
00:11:59,190 --> 00:11:59,870
But...

237
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,910
what should I do?

238
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,000
What?

239
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,390
Are you asking me for help?

240
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,350
Will you help me?

241
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,030
Coffee.

242
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,590
Here's your coffee.

243
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:25,780
Okay.

244
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,310
Xiao,

245
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,390
let Ms. Tong teach you a thing or two.

246
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,110
Here's the thing.

247
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,870
The two of you

248
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,830
have your past, your memories,

249
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:36,990
and your history.

250
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,190
This is an advantage.

251
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,860
Cheng Yao’s advantage

252
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,630
is that he is close.

253
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,750
First come, first served.

254
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:46,950
Yes.

255
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,470
Eight years have passed,

256
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,670
and besides Wei Tian,

257
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,560
everyone around her is new.

258
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,090
I don't even have a helper.

259
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,430
No helper?

260
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,150
You can train a new one.

261
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,080
What do you mean?

262
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,350
What do you mean by what do I mean?

263
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,710
Tell me.

264
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:03,200
Who else

265
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,530
is still close to Lin Xi?

266
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,430
Let me draw it out for you.

267
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:10,710
Draw it out?

268
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:28,840
Xiao, you've done

269
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,110
your homework.

270
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,630

281

You're not lying, are you?

282
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:57,910
Can we really find

283
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,750
a Shakespeare expert here?

284
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,390
I'm sure.

285
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:02,790
But don't forget

286
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:03,920
your mission today.

287
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,230
Don't worry.

288
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,230
As long as

289
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:07,310
the teacher is good,

290
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,320
it's not a problem.

291
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:08,910
Good.

292

Why can't it be me?

295
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:26,600
Why didn't you open the door?

296
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,260
They've been knocking continuously.

297
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,510
The delivery guy got the wrong door,

298
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,570
thus the knocking.

299
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,750
Who are you lying to?

300
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,130
No one lives next door.

Why are you here?

304

We're here to see Grandma Li.

306

You know Grandma Li?

307
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,310
I've heard a lot about her.

308
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,790
We're here for a favor.

309
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,590
Unfortunately,

I missed you too.

314
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:05,950
Since Peter

315
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,550
missed his Aunt Xixi so much,

316
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:08,690
let's wait inside.

-Lin Xi's good friend— -client.

333
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,590
Hello, Grandma Li.

334
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:57,920
My name is Xiao Yicheng.

335
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,110
I came here today

336
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:01,310
because I have a presumptuous request.

337
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:02,990
This child

338
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,390
is a Shakespeare fan.

339
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,150
I heard from Lin Xi that

340
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,440
you're an expert in this field,

341
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,040
so we came for your guidance.

342
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,150
You flatter me.

343
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,230
Come, have a seat.

344
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,190
Have a seat.

345
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,030
Come on.

346
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,150
Do you like Shakespeare?

347
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,390
Dad.

348
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,070
Is this the master you mentioned?

349
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,360
Not to that extent,

350
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:29,150
but I can still

351
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,630
comapre notes with a kid.

352
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,030
Grandma, do you know of

353
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,490
Shakespeare's Sonnet 14?

354
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,470
Of course.

355
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:39,390
Do you know the longest word

356
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,510
that Shakespeare used?

357
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:45,910
Dad.

358
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:48,230
The expert you mentioned is terrible.

359
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,590
What are you talking about? He's rude.

360
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:53,430

361
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,150
This is a word

362
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:57,110
used by Shakespeare

363
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,670

please accept him as your student.

383
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,270
He was already your fan

384
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,750
before he met you.

385
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,350
Grandma.

386
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,260
It's just a small gift.

387
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,070
You're too polite.

388
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,990
No.

389
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,230
He can't be her student.

390
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,590
Why not?

391
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,310
My grandma is very picky.

392
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,270
You're just using

393
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,270
something flashy

394
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,110
to fool her.

395
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,150
The horseshoe biscuits from Xialu Street.

396
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,430
Young man, you know a lot.

397
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,590
Grandaunt,

398
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,510
isn't this just a box of

399
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,240
ordinary horseshoe biscuits?

400
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,790
What do kids know?

401
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,190
I've been eating these

402
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,910
since my childhood.

403
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:18,870
They taste very special.

404
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,060
Even the Qing dynasty poet Fang Gui

405
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,270
have praised it before.

406
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:25,150
"Suddenly rising, leaving traces behind,

407
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:28,640
Even without treading on flowers, the fragrance lingers."

408
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:29,830
Grandma,

409
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:32,120
not only do you study Shakespeare,

410
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,150
but you're also an expert in eating.

411
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,870
Would you like some?

412
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:39,100
Little disciple.

413
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:41,950
Dad, look.

414
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:44,030
My goddess agreed to be my teacher.

415
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:44,830
How great. Thank you.

416
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:45,870
Well,

417
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:48,470
since the ceremony

418
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,110
has been completed,

419
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,510
We won't keep our guests.

420
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:51,390
Bye.

421
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,070
What are you talking about?

422
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,670
They are our guests.

423
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,190
Grandma, we have work to do.

424
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:58,880
Go.

425
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,720
It's okay.

426
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,270
Go on with your work.

427
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,870
I'm here to see Grandma Li.

428
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,230
Yaoyao.

429
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:07,830
Go get some tea.

430
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:10,910
Bring me my treasured

431
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:11,710
Roselle tea.

432
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,510
Go.

433
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:14,990
Thank you.

434
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,270
Xiao…

435
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,670
Just call me Xiao.

436
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:22,630
Xiao?

437
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,230
Yaoyao said that

438
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:27,790
you are Xixi's client,

439
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:30,830
but you said you are good friends.

440
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:31,350
This...

441
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:31,950
Grandma.

442
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,350
Actually, I've known Lin Xi

443
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,190
for a long time.

444
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,790
We were university friends.

445
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:38,630
Are you from the same university?

446
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,150
Not really.

447
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,430
We shared a campus.

448
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,890
My school was next to hers.

449
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:45,670
Are you from Haijiang University?

450
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,870
My godfather is a computer major.

451
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,270
Amazing.

452
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,270
Don't mention it.

453
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:52,870
My dad is amazing.

454
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:56,130
He's a renowned alumni in the Faculty of Computer Science.

455
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,470
You and Xixi

456
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,870
are not in the same school

457
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,470
neither do you share a major.

458
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,870
How did you meet?

459
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,150
Grandaunt, I can't find it.

460
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:08,990
It's in that cabinet.

461
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,270
Grandaunt, please help me.

462
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,190
Okay.

463
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:12,950
Have a seat.

464
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,030
Isn't this...

465
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:23,790
Grandma.

466
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,470
Do you know who Xiao Yicheng is?

467
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,590
Isn't he a client of your company?

468
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:29,510
He's Lin Xi's ex-boyfriend.

469
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,910
He wants to go back to Lin Xi?

470
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,020
I think so.

471
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:37,310
So whose side are you on?

472
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,990
Of course I'm on your side.

473
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,350
Do you know what to do?

474
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:43,590
Of course.

475
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,550
Okay, follow me.

476
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,020
As you can see,

477
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:01,950
all of these are organic fruits.

478
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,150
[Fresh vegetables]

479
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:04,810
[Black persimmon]

480
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:06,270
Like green apples,

481
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,630
pitayas,

482
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:11,340
Wait.

483
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:14,390
What is this?

484
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,510
This is our local specialty.

485
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,610
Black persimmons.

486
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:21,630
Can you speak Mandarin?

487
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,550
I am speaking Mandarin.

488
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,860
Come on, try it.

489
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:27,510
Here, try it.

490
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,390
What is it?

491
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:30,950
Maybe…

492
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:31,950
I don't know what this is.

493
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,550
These are black persimmons.

494
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,150
It's very delicious.

495
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:40,790
Okay.

496
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,940
[Black persimmon]

497
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,920
This is black persimmon juice.

498
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,210
Black persimmons are also called chocolate pudding fruit.

499
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,530
It's Vitamin C content

500
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,070
is more than twice the amount of other species.

501
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,030
You can try it.

502
00:21:58,530 --> 00:21:59,460
We can try it?

503
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,590
Of course.

504
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,590
It tastes good.

505
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:06,710
It tastes special.

506
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:07,910
Yes, it's pretty good.

507
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:08,510
Yes.

508
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:09,640
I like this taste.

509
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:10,910
Very delicious.

510
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:11,950
I can't imagine

511
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:13,610
a fruit would taste like this.

512
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,590
It's amazing.

513
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,070
I can't get tired of it.

514
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:25,550
Are you done?

515
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,240
If you are, please go back.

516
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,190
Grandma.

517
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,100
This is really delicious.

518
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:34,380
You know something good when you see it.

519
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,270
I love it.

520
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:43,550
It's almost noon.

521
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:45,450
Why don't we have lunch together?

522
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,390
Grandma Li, what do you want to eat?

523
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:49,190
West Lake Fish in Vinegar Gravy.

524
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,440
Grandma,

525
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,150
your favorite restaurant

526
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:53,270
needs to be booked in advance.

527
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,750
It's okay. I'll cook.

528
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,230
You can cook?

529
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,670
Godfather's cooking is better than Michelin.

530
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:00,910
especially West Lake Fish in Vinegar Gravy.

531
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:03,000
There is a market across the street.

532
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:04,550
Xixi knows the way.

533
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,510
Let's go grocery shopping?

534
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:09,920
I'll go too.

535
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:01,950
Tian.

536
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:03,850
Have you eaten?

537
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:04,870
No.

538
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:05,830
Let's go eat.

539
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,750
But I still have materials I have to read

540
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,430
about Professor Chen.

541
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:11,030
It won't delay anything.

542
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,430
Health is the foundation of revolution.

543
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:13,830
You need to eat to work.

544
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:18,670
What?

545
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:22,590
Just the two of us?

546
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,750
I'll get changed then.

547
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,190
No need, it's just a meal.

548
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:31,510
Let me change my shoes.

549
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:42,340
The total is 65 yuan.

550
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,150
That's it.

551
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:44,790
Pay here.

552
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:45,670
Thank you, boss.

553
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:46,420
Just give it to me.

554
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,470
Okay. Take it.

555
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:53,390
Here.

556
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,870
Take my phone.

557
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:01,910
It's on the right.

558
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:11,750
Inside.

559
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:35,790
Old password.

560
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,390
Okay.

561
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,230
Do you need vinegar?

562
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:04,830
Yes.

563
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:06,750
Sir, a bottle of vinegar.

564
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:07,990
I'll pay.

565
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:09,950
Let me.

566
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:13,230
Wait.

567
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:29,840
How much is it, boss?

568
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:32,510
Take it.

569
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:35,470
Hurry up.

570
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:38,100
She's already paid.

571
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:38,700
Thank you.

572
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,270
Watch out.

573
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,160
Just walk inside.

574
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,510
There was

575
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:19,790
a poor guy named

576
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:20,740
Aladdin.

577
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:22,750
He lives with his mom.

578
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,710
You did a good job.

579
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,310
You've improved a lot.

580
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:30,470
One day,

581
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:32,870
Aladdin met a wizard

582
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:33,790
in the park.

583
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,430
The wizard said

584
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,070
do me a favour,

585
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:39,910
and I'll pay you a silver coin.

586
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,750
Aladdin agreed.

587
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,550
They walked a long way,

588
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:46,430
and finally

589
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,560
arrived at a rock by the mountain foot.

590
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:50,670
The wizard told him,

591
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,870
there was a oil lamp in the cave

592
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:55,350
behind the rock.

593
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,750
Push aside the rocks,

594
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,590
and go get it.

595
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:01,510
What's wrong?

596
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,590
Nothing.

597
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:12,910
What happened?

598
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,030
Nothing.

599
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,030
I cut myself a little.

600
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,960
Stop handling it.

601
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,150
Take care of it first.

602
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:20,510
Really?

603
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,590
Didn't he say he's fine?

604
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:22,300
Let me see.

605
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:26,870
Well,

606
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,510
just get a Band-Aid.

607
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:29,150
It's fine.

608
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:30,670
No, you have to deal with it.

609
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:31,270
Cheng Yao.

610
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,230
Get him a bandage

611
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,390
and a disinfectant.

612
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,230
Thank you.

613
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,810
Come here. Stop it.

614
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,120
I'm really fine.

615
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:42,630
Sit.

616
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:47,910
Only a Band-Aid?

617
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:01,200
A perfect match.

618
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,920
Grandma, you have good taste.

619
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:08,100
I mean

620
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,440
you and Xixi are a perfect match.

621
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,120
You look well together.

622
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,470
Why don't you help them?

623
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:19,390
Because he can't help.

624
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:21,590
You're so stupid.

625
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:23,240
You are the one who insisted on eating

626
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,630
West Lake Fish in Vinegar Gravy.

627
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:25,590
What can I do?

628
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:27,750
I didn't know that

629
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,270
he knows how to cook it.

630
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:31,240
What if

631
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,550
he can cook it well?

632
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:33,830
Really?

633
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:36,710
Am I that

634
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,230
easily tempted?

635
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:40,350
Look.

636
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:41,450
I even said I wanted

637
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,710
to help you pursue your girlfriend.

638
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,390
You don't trust me.

639
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,960
Forget it. I won't help you.

640
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:48,950
Grandaunt! Grandaunt!

641
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:49,670
Grandaunt!

642
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:51,470
How will you help me?

643
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:55,430
Didn't you

644
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:58,470
buy prawns today?

645
00:29:58,550 --> 00:29:59,110
Yes.

646
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:01,510
I'm going to make prawns with tomato juice.

647
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:02,870
Have you heard of

648
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:06,990
men peeling prawns for women?

649
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,310
Got it.

650
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,070
Thank you.

651
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,350
It smells good.

652
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:26,200
Smells good.

653
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,350
This is...

654
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:32,310
This is called brains.

655
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:33,870
It's the specialty here.

656
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:36,110
Rated 5 stars online.

657
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,590
You can't eat it anywhere else.

658
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:38,750
Brains?

659
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,400
As in my brain?

660
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:42,710
This...

661
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:43,630
No.

662
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:44,830
It's made of mutton.

663
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,150
There are eight ingredients

664
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,270
It's also called Eight Treasure Soup.

665
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:49,950
Try it.

666
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:11,190
Why don't you eat?

667
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,470
Eat.

668
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:28,270
What's wrong?

669
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,890
Do you have a stomachache?

670
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:32,390
No, no.

671
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:35,790
You're sweating.

672
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:39,390
How about

673
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:40,790
we go to the hospital?

674
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:42,030
No need.

675
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,550
It's too troublesome.

676
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,510
Boss, check please.

677
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:52,630
Tian.

678
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,100
I'm...

679
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,260
It's my time of the month.

680
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:09,750
Time?

681
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:11,110
What time?

682
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:14,190
What time of the month?

683
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:18,230
I have period pain.

684
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:23,430
Hello.

685
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:24,690
It's 134 yuan in total.

686
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:27,310
You...

687
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,550
1, 134.

688
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,030
Do you

689
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,300
have…

690
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,910
Hot… uh…

691
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:35,310
Brown…

692
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,710
Ginger tea with brown sugar.

693
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:38,070
Yes, ginger tea with brown sugar.

694
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:38,830
No.

695
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,350
Only old vinegar.

696
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,470
No need.

697
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,540
I'll pay later, okay?

698
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,110
Okay.

699
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,310
Shasha.

700
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:58,790
I have an idea.

701
00:32:58,870 --> 00:32:59,950
Do you want to try?

702
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:05,390
Give me your hand.

703
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:25,110
Do you feel

704
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:26,500
something swollen?

705
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:28,160

Go back first.

718
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,510
Can I have some tissues?

719
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,030
Coming.

720
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:18,389
West Lake Fish in Vinegar Gravy is here.

721
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:22,310
The color...

722
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,949
The color is good,

723
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,310
but it's too oily.

724
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:31,469
I can't eat it.

725
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:32,949
I can't eat it.

726
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:35,620
Grandma,

727
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:37,510
the fish belly

728
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,310
is not oily.

729
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:39,670
Just try it.

730
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:41,440
I'm not good at cooking.

731
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:42,270
I just don't know

732
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:43,310
what happened.

733
00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:44,719
I just want your advice.

734
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:47,389
Well,

735
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:50,310
I'll reluctantly

736
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:52,150
try the dishes for him.

737
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:02,710
What do you think?

738
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:03,390
What else?

739
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:04,630
Of course not.

740
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:06,550
This...

741
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,270
Really.

742
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:14,110
I really didn’t taste it.

743
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:24,990
Xixi.

744
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,280
Have some prawns.

745
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:28,230
It's okay.

746
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,230
I can do it myself.

747
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,230
Don't mention it.

748
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,190
We are friends.

749
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:35,430
She can't eat prawns.

750
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:42,000
I'm allergic to prawns.

751
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:51,590
Grandma.

752
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:53,590
This...

753
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,590
West Lake Fish in Vinegar Gravy,

754
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:57,230
any improvements to be made?

755
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:58,150
Let me know.

756
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:02,590
This

757
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:05,910
Well,

758
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:08,470
comapred with..

759
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:11,310
professional chefs

760
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:14,390
there's still room for improvement.

761
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:15,230
Yes.

762
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,350
I haven't done it for a long time.

763
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:18,480
My skills are rusty.

764
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,680
You need to practice more.

765
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,270
Then come here

766
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:24,110
to practice.

767
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:29,670
Enough, you two.

768
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:31,150
Don't make it hard for Grandma Li.

769
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:31,990
Let's eat.

770
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,050
It's getting cold.

771
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,350
What's wrong?

772
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:09,330
I'm fine. I need to take a rest.

773
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:22,610
Hello, is this the receptionist?

774
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:24,910
I'm a guest in Room 2028.

775
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:25,510
My surname is Wei.

776
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:26,550
Could you please

777
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:27,950
send an electric bike down?

778
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:28,990
We need it now.

779
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:32,410
The car broke down.

780
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:35,070
Forget it.

781
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,950
I just need a rest.

782
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:58,510
It's cold in the mountains at night.

783
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:01,030
It'll be bad if you get worse.

784
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:04,310
If you don't mind,

785
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:05,850
I can carry you.

786
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,120
Forget it if it's inconvenient for you.

787
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:17,110
I...

788
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:18,960
Tian,

789
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,150
thank you.

790
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:48,830
Brother Tian, are you tired?

791
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:50,030
No.

792
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,390
When I was in the army,

793
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,350
I carried 30 kilograms and ran 5 kilometers.

794
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:54,390
Easy.

795
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,350
With your height and weight,

796
00:38:58,590 --> 00:38:59,070
you look

797
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,230
about 50 kilograms.

798
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:03,510
I'm not 50kg.

799
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,950
Why did you join the army?

800
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:17,170
My grandfather was a soldier.

801
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,670
My father was a soldier too.

802
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:20,630
I grew up in the compound.

803
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,910
After that, when they recruited,

804
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:25,860
I joined the army.

805
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:29,390
When you joined the army,

806
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:30,430
did anything

807
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:31,990
leave an impression?

808
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:37,320
Nothing.

809
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:39,590
Just eating, sleeping and training.

810
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:41,150
Is there anything

811
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:43,230
that impressed you?

812
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:49,430
Think about it.

813
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,510
No.

814
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:56,070
Actually,

815
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:59,400
this isn't the first time you carried me on your back.

816
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,870
Why do I feel the road is getting farther and farther

817
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:06,200
Something is not right.

818
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:07,030
I don't know.

819
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,690
Why is the road getting more and more dangerous?

820
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:11,310
Be careful.

821
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:12,790
It should be fine.

822
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:13,790
Let's continue.

823
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:14,630
The direction is right.

824
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:15,870
Why is it so far?

825
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:17,310
We haven't even seen a mountain road.

826
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:18,470
Be careful.

827
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,950
Shasha, hurry up.

828
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:20,550
Okay.

829
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,510
Be careful.

830
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,080
Watch your step.

831
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:47,350
Be careful.

832
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:50,270
Don't worry.

833
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:53,030
Be careful.

834
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:54,030
Here.

835
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:56,150
Give me your hand.

836
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,480
Shasha!

837
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,360
Shasha!

838
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:03,230
Shasha!

839
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,310
Shasha!

840
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:55,310
Is anyone there?

841
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,310
Hello? Hello?

842
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:02,790
Wang Yiming. Haotian.

843
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:03,760
Let's split up.

844
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,670
Yes.

845
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:07,910
Hello?

846
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:09,030
Shasha!

847
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,230
Hello?

848
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:14,580
Shasha!

849
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:16,630
Is anyone there?

850
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:17,470
Hello?

851
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:22,670
