[Our Interpreter]

[Episode 1]

4
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:43,090
[if I should meet thee, after long years,]

5
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:45,400
[How should I greet thee?]

6
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,950
[With silence and tears.]

7
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:51,180
[George Gordon Byron]

8
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,829
Hello.

9
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,000
-Hello.
-Hello.

10
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,510
Here's your water.

11
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:51,990
Thank you.

12
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,070
You're welcome.

13
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:58,510
Cheers.

14
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,870
And urge the investors

15
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,620
to analyze and judge normally,

16
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,420
reflecting the investor's

17
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,990
purpose of investment and willingness.

18
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,550
Tian.

19
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,430
How is it?

20
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,910
She is almost breaking her record.

21
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,310
It's not frequent deals

22
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,829
but spending large amounts of time

23
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:19,510
and energy

24
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,260
to study what you invested in.

25
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,540
Prepare the knowledge first.

26
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,079
Then, when the chance comes,

27
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,670
make a swift decision.

28
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,650
This is what

29
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,790
"a book holds a house of gold" means.

30
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,940
As for philosophy,

31
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,829
it's impossible to be completely

32
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,550
expressed and conveyed with words.

33
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,310
It requires one to feel, understand,

34
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,600
and think about it with their heart.

35
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,510
Jingge Fund

36
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,550
will be your most loyal partner.

37
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,950
Mr. James,

38
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,550
we’ve known each other

39
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,510
for so many years.

40
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,950
We have had great cooperations.

41
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,550
Do you know our

42
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,590
investment philosophy?

43
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:01,800
Investment

44
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,670
philosophy

45
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:03,870
is a set of values

46
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,510
that represents...

47
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,790
The interpreter today is hospitalized?

48
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,350
Then...

49
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:09,940
I recommend

50
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,710
the director of the priority client management department to take over this.

51
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:13,470
She's our best interpreter.

52
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,190
She was transferred to a management post two years ago

53
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,510
and hasn't done interpretation much since.

54
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,630
But this is our fault.

55
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:19,990
So I asked her to come and help out.

56
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,990
I hope Mr. Xiao and Ms. Tong

57
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:22,910
can forgive us.

58
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,310
Your best interpreter?

59
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,350
Who is it?

60
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:27,310
Lin Xi.

61
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,550
The most professional interpreter in Huasheng.

62
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,430
A human's short-term memory

63
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,630
is about 30 seconds.

64
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:33,830
With professional training,

65
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,350
it can reach two to three minutes.

66
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,430
For an experienced interpreter,

67
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,510
it's five to six minutes.

68
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,990
And this interpreter's

69
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,950
highest record

70
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:42,909
is 10 minutes,

71
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,550
or even 12 minutes.

72
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:45,920
I'd like to say,

73
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,390
active investors

74
00:04:47,409 --> 00:04:48,810
do not trade a lot.

75
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,600
They spend a lot of time and

76
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,540
energy researching

77
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,060
what they're investing in.

78
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,320
We've known each other for a long time,

79
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,350
and have such a good relationship.

80
00:04:58,650 --> 00:04:59,970
Dear Mr. James,

81
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,140
Jingge Fund

82
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,810
will be your faithful partner.

83
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,240
12 minutes and 8 seconds.

84
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,040
Xi broke her personal record again.

85
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,830
But we've prepared for this new product launch

86
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,270
for two months.

87
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,190
If she's joining in at the last minute,

88
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:23,790
I'm worried...

89
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,670
Don't worry.

90
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,680
Not only is she good at professional skills,

91
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,580
her improvisation

92
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:28,950
is also beyond

93
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,590
ordinary people's reach.

94
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,940
I'm sorry.

95
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,870
Pieces for peace.

96
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,060
What?

97
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,640
Pieces for peace.

98
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,830
Yes, pieces for peace.

99
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:43,920
Good.

100
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,230
Let me take a call.

101
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:51,480
Okay.

102
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,630
I'll go first.

103
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,220
It's fine now.

104
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:02,840
Relax.

105
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,150
This is not allowing that.

106
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,550
Don't you care about your stomach?

107
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,790
I took some medicine.

108
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:12,910
Still.

109
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,190
It's my pleasure to attend this seminar.

110
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,790
Today's discussion showed

111
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:19,630
that China enjoys

112
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:20,970
very good growth engine

113
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,800
and that has achieved rapid development.

114
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,590
I am honored to have

115
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,310
China as a strong partner.

116
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,330
Indian English pronunciation

117
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,440
is a difficulty of interpretation.

118
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:32,420
The meeting uh... was well done.

119
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,800
She thinks...

120
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,909
She thinks...

121
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,050
Our country has changed a lot.

122
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,070
Is it convenient?

123
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:41,510
Sorry for that. Thank you.

124
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,430
This lady meant

125
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,590
she's very glad to be able to

126
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,310
join this fund seminar.

127
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,230
She saw

128
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,240
the high level and lively development

129
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,450
of China.

130
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,110
She's very honored

131
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,470
to have such a business partner.

132
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:54,650
Me too.

133
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:55,909
Me too.

134
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:56,990
Cheers.

135
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,000
No problem.

136
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:02,790
Let's go.

137
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,190
Thank you.

138
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,630
Lin Xi from Huasheng.

139
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,590
You know me?

140
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,910
You're an interpreter with no mistake.

141
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,710
I'm impressed.

142
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,510
I'm flattered.

143
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,870
As far as I know,

144
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,420
after you became the director of the priority client management department

145
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,150
you rarely

146
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,790
show up as an interpreter yourself.

147
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:22,750
I wonder

148
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,150
if I can have the honor

149
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,430
to hire Director Lin next time?

150
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:30,000
Huasheng's departments have clear division of work.

151
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,670
For written translations, look for the translation department.

152
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,670
For simultaneous interpretations, look for the interpretation department.

153
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:35,790
My colleagues

154
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:36,790
will provide you

155
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,830
with the best service.

156
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,740
Looks like I'm not

157
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,230
as important as Mr. Sun is.

158
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,950
Mr. Sun has been my client for many years.

159
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:45,810
He is also an old friend.

160
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,630
I'm here today

161
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:47,870
just to help my friend.

162
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:49,750
How can I become

163
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,110
a friend of yours, then?

164
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:53,870
Why don't you consider

165
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,830
becoming our department's

166
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,870
client first?

167
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,230
To become a client

168
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,240
of Huasheng's priority client management department...

169
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,270
That's a high treshold.

170
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,470
You snatched someone's job while they were halfway through it.

171
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:09,670
Don't you want your reputation?

172
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,190
Can reputation be translated into performance?

173
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,310
[Mr. Zhang]

174
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,310
[Reject] [Answer]

175
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:21,950
Here.

176
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:22,590
Cheers.

177
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:23,670
Cheers.

178
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:25,270
Okay.

179
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,430
Send me the information.

180
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:26,910
Here.

181
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,150
Let me drive.

182
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:30,870
No.

183
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,820
Get a taxi or a designated driver.

184
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:33,830
You need to check the procedure with me.

185
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:34,390
Okay.

186
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,150
Xi.

187
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,669
There are nine people in the queue for taxis

188
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,820
and seven in the queue for designated drivers.

189
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:38,510
Increase the price.

190
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:40,309
That's a mistake the interpretation department made.

191
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,789
Are you sure you want to clean up their mess?

192
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,470
It was the interpretation department's job.

193
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:44,870
But Lingfeng is in my priority client management department's

194
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:45,710

when you are completely not prepared,

270

00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,440
They are business, construction,

00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:20,230
I sorted out.

Do you want to take a look?

385
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,910
No, I saw it on the way.

386
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,550
Before we start translating,

387
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:27,080
I think it's necessary to understand

388
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,960
some professional terms

492
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,420
your interview with The Honor of Sci-Tech.

493
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:41,400
You said that during your time starting up a business in the US

494
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,320
were your darkest moments.

495
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,840

get through that period?

497
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,520
At The Honor of Sci-Tech, you said that your start-up time in America

498
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:51,220
was your darkest days.

499
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:52,270
How did you

500
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,030
get through?

501
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:08,610
Adapt to the darkness

502
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,600

503
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:15,610

504
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,230
and embrace darkness.

505
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,870
Can you make it more specific?

506
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:21,770
More specific?

507
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,940
When people are in a desperate situation,

508
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,040
other than the useless physical suicid

509
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:28,670
and psychological avoidance,

510
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,230

513
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,790
There's indeed a third choice.

514

515
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:40,350

Mr. Xiao,

517
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:56,160

518
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,470
this translation application

519
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,150

520
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,750
What's the definition of this

521
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:01,590
"no inferior"?

522
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,510
Can we have the honor of witnessing

523
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:05,140

524
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,230

In the era of big data

545

547

548
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:43,440
is maturing by the day.

549
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:44,630
With

550
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:45,910
a large amount of data,

551
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,750
we constantly improve our core algorithm

552
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:48,960
and improve

553
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,540
our smart system's capability in all aspects.

554
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:52,950
To improve

555
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:56,630
our smart translation system in all aspects.

556
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,790
Vitamin, do you want it?

557
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,950
The machine translator

558
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,510
is obviously faster than Lin Xi's.

559
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,000
It's not the same.

560
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,620
The translator does the machine translation

561
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:36,750
after receiving the information.

562
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:38,510
Lin Xi is an interpreter.

563
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,230
And the interpreter is supposed

564
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,580
to read only three seconds

565
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,440
after.

566
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,100
I think

567
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,990
fast is key.

568
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:45,870
Translation

569
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:47,220
has to be fast.

570
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,350
But I think

571
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:51,330
Lin Xi translated it more gracefully.

572
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,110
That's true.

573
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,010
The most important things

574

about translation are reliability, reachability, and gracefulness.

575
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,070
Mr. Xiao,

00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,110
Ms. Lin Xi.

Finally...

587
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,600
I would like to recite

588
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,550
my favorite ancient phrase

589
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,780

Do you know Huasheng's

previous priority client management department director, Ma Xuan?

593
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:40,790
Everyone in the industry knows her.

594
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:42,330
On a public forum,

595
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,570
Deputy Mayor Liu said something from the Verse of Chu,

596
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:47,070
"My heart is broken and I can't stop my longing;

597
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,730
every day, I live in depression"

598
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:50,990
Ma Xuan didn't say a single word,

599
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,530
causing an incident in that translation.

600
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:54,710
What simultaneous interpreters are the most afraid of

601
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,450
are improvised ancient Chinese.

602
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:58,000

a gentleman should always be improving oneself.

Just like the sturdy ground,

607

a gentleman should carry good virtue and tolerence.

608
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:07,960
A gentleman should strive for improvement,

609
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:11,450
just like the universe does in evolution.

610
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:15,870
A gentleman should cultivate to become tolerant

I'd drag her down is apologizing to me.

I was wrong about you just now.

619
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:27,870
I'm sorry.

620
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,840
I have a small suggestion.

621
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:32,700
Go ahead.

622

623
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,310
and is good at foreign language.

624
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:39,130
But foreign language and interpretation

625
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,040
are two different things.

626
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:42,720
Just like math and physics.

627

Though they seem connected,

628
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,900
but they are actually very different.

629
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,790
The difference between them

630
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,320
needs experience and understanding.

631
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:54,030
I admire you.

Okay.

637
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:01,630
I said too much.

638
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:02,980
I'm leaving.

639

are you going to

647
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,010
give Lin Xi a raise this time?

648
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,320
Of course.

649
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,449
I'll do it tomorrow.

00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:10,390
for choosing Huasheng

766
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,430
among so many companies.

767
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:12,760
Here.

768
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,670
Lin Xi, Wei Tian,

769
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:16,390
Shasha, Wenwen,

770
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:17,290
let's raise our glasses

771
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:18,590
and drink a toast to the two bosses.

772
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:21,190
I hope we can work together for a long time.

773
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,780
It's a win-win situation. Come on.

774
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:23,880
-Lin Xi.
-Come.

775
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,070
You can't drink.

776
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,430
You just took stomach medicine.

777
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,030
It's vitamins.

778
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:33,790
I saw it clearly.

779
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:36,920
It's okay. It'll be fine if I just drink a little.

780
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:38,230
Let's drink.

781
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:38,950
Maomao,

782
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:41,550
go order a pot of chrysanthemum wolfberry tea.

783
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:42,270
Okay.

784
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,630
Mr. Xiao is so considerate.

785
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:47,790
Thank you, Mr. Xiao.

786
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:49,030
I'm ordering it for myself.

787
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:54,500
I can avoid drinking with that too.

788
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:56,190
Okay.

789
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:57,420
Ms. Tan speaks quickly.

790
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:58,900
I managed to take advantage of that.

791
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,220
It's okay.

792
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,190
Let's drink.

793
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:04,750
Come on.

794
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:05,840
The most important thing is to be happy today.

795
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,290
Yes.

796
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:06,880
Mr. Zhang.

797
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:08,360
Excuse me, I need to answer a call.

798
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:10,470
Thank you for your hard work.

799
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,000
Thank you, Mr. Xiao. Thank you, Mr. Xiao.

800
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:23,710
Hello.

801
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,190
Hello, sir.

802
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:25,870
Can I

803
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:26,920
help you?

804
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:28,710
For the

805
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:30,030
spicy boiled fish we ordered,

806
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:31,150
could you ask the chef

807
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:31,960
to not add chili?

808
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,190
Spicy boiled fish...

809
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:35,270
Is there a problem?

810
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:36,670
No.

811
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:37,590
Thank you.

812
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:54,790
For traditional translation companies like us,

813
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:56,150
there are still many things...

814
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,240
What are you so happy about?

815
00:40:58,270 --> 00:40:59,420
Tell us.

816
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:02,220
It's my best friend.

817
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:04,070
She's a reporter who attended the event just now.

818
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:05,270
She raised her hand three times

819
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:06,850
but didn't get picked by Mr. Xiao.

820
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,600
She found out that I'm having dinner

821
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:09,630
with Mr. Xiao and Ms. Tong

822
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:10,670
so she wants me to

823
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:12,110
help her ask some questions.

824
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:13,590
That's inappropriate.

825
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:15,230
Mr. Xiao is having dinner.

826
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,550
Mr. Zhang, it’s okay.

827
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:18,430
Since Mr. Xiao agreed,

828
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:19,350
you can go ahead.

829
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:21,110
I'll ask then.

830
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,480
Mr. Xiao, you're so handsome,

831
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:24,750
do you have a girlfriend?

832
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:35,910
Your reporter friend

833
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,790
must be working at an entertainment news outlet.

834
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:40,830
She wants to write an in-depth report on Yuyi

835
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:42,100
so she has to write a little more

836
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,150
about Mr. Xiao.

837
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:45,230
Mr. Xiao, if it's not convenient,

838
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:45,630
I'll just.

839
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:46,320
I did.

840
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:47,350
How many?

841
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:49,230
You're being too bold.

842
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:56,980
One.

843
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:59,710
How straightforward!

844
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:01,950
Can you

845
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:02,990
talk to us about

846
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:04,110
your only ex-girlfriend

847
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:05,270
in your life.

848
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:18,200
You really want to hear about it?

849
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:25,900
She's nothing special.

850
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,520
Just like a glass of water.

851
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:31,470
It's neither good nor harmful.

852
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:33,110
You can drink or not drink it.

853
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:34,440
It's neither salty nor plain.

854
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:35,710
There are lots of them.

855
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,270
That's very philosophical.

856
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:39,310
Exactly.

857
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:41,100
Mr. Xiao,

858
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,910
speaking ill of your ex-girlfriend

859
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:45,770
in front of so many people...

860
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:48,350
You don't seem

861
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:49,790
to be such a rude person.

862
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:52,290
Did I speak ill of her?

863
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:54,830
She said the same thing to me.

864
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:06,630
That's spicy.

865
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:07,710
Spicy!

866
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:09,700
You're such an outstanding man,

867
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,630
how could you be despised by your ex-girlfriend?

868
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:13,260
She has no taste.

869
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,190
I'm not interested

870
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:20,690
in gossip at all.

871
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,520
Me too.

872
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:23,890
We ordered this?

873
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:25,150
It's spicy boiled fish.

874
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:26,750
Are you kidding?

875
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:27,830
Spicy boiled fish with no chili?

876
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:29,070
What kind of recipe are you using?

877
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:30,630
That gentleman

878
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:32,270
asked me to remove the chili.
