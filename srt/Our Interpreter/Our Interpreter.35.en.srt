and

196
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,790
what Huasheng can't provide.

197
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:45,910
Mr. Xiao,

198
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,230
then tell us.

199
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:49,430
What is the thing that Huasheng can't provide

200
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,990
but Yuyi can provide?

201
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,790
There's no making without breaking.

202
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,190
I'm all ears.

203
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,870
Things we did

204
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,190
and people we met in the past

205
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,590
are called experiences.

206
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,310
Through those experiences,

207
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,120
we gained some views

208
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,960
and value.

209
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,760
That's what we call experience.

210
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,830
But with all due respect,

211
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,470
every year, the Consumer Products Expo

212
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,510
has different exhibitors,

213
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,990
different situations,

214
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,310
and even

215
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,510
different policies.

216
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,590
This year's Consumer Products Expo is brand-new.

217
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:25,110
So, technically,

218
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,190
the experience Huasheng mentioned

219
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:28,650
is a pseudo-proposition.

220
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,790
Mr. Xiao,

221
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,430
do you mean Huasheng hasn't made any accomplishment

222
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:35,160
at the Consumer Products Expo?

223
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,150
Mr. Xiao,

224
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,950
slandering your opponent

225
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,590
in not something decent.

226
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,510
Mr. Zhang, calm down.

227
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,910
I'm just saying Huasheng

228
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,910
hasn't made any improvement.

229
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,430
Why didn't I know

230
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,430
Mr. Xiao is so skilled in sophistry?

231
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,500
Yuyi has three advantages.

232
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,590
First,

233
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:02,510
our translation devices are safe and stable.

234
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,590
They will never

235
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,470
be affected

236
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,470
by interpreters' physical conditions

237
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,670
or emotions.

238
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,470
Second,

239
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,030
the bidirectional translation function

240
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:11,840
of Yuyi's translation devices

241
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,670
covers

242
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,510
over 200 countries and regions.

243
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:16,590
Last year, you lacked Finnish interpreters.

244
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:19,120
This year, it definitely won't happen again.

245
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,510
And third?

246
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,230
The third advantage

247
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,870
is also the most important advantage:

248
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,130
cost-effectiveness.

249
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,710
The cost-effectiveness of intelligent translation devices

250
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:33,350
is much higher than that of traditional interpreters.

251
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,190
After all,

252
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:36,950
machines

253
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,480
won't ask for overtime pay.

254
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,910
Do you have other questions?

255
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,870
Mr. Xiao,

256
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:49,190
they say machines are cold

257
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,550
and don't have emotions.

258
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,150
What do you think about this?

259
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:56,030
Translating is not making a speech.

260
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,290
It needs rationality.

261
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:00,540
But machines have always been like this.

262
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:03,670
Good.

263
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,270
Next, let's welcome

264
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,550
Jitianyu's spokesperson.

265
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,270
It's already at this hour.

266
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,270
It's been so long.

267
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,600
We've been waiting for so long.

268
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:48,000
Why hasn't the result been announced yet?

269
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,310
The time has passed.

270
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,790
The result still hasn't been announced yet.

271
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,190
Did we fail?

272
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:40,110
Then... Director Dong means...

273
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:05,430
Everyone,

274
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,550
we won.

275
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,270
-Great!
-Great!

276
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,950
The Consumer Products Bureau

277
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,710
required Yuyi's translation devices to play a major role

278
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:23,470
and Huasheng to assist them.

279
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,270
They asked Huasheng

280
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,710
to assist us?

281
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:27,030
So they lost.

282
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,230
They lost completely.

283
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:29,030
That's right.

284
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:29,790
That's right.

285
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:30,510
Yes.

286
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,270
All right.

287
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:32,670
Everyone,

288
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,470
I have fulfilled my promise.

289
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:37,790
I hope

290
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:40,190
I can continue to have your recognition.

291
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,590
Of course.

292
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:44,230
Yicheng made a great contribution

293
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,500
to Yuyi.

294
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,920
Indeed, he should be reinstated.

295
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,270
That's right.

296
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,470
Wait.

297
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:57,150
Ying, what do you mean?

298
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,830
Mr. Xiao

299
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:03,780
is an outstanding computer talent.

300
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,110
I think he should

301
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,590
continue to shine bright

302
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:10,790
as the company's CTO.

303
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,670
As for the position of CEO,

304
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,830
I'm afraid he doesn't have that much energy

305
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,470
to do both.

306
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,070
People

307
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:25,110
should focus on doing what they are good at.

308
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,510
I suggest

309
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:27,950
the annual salary of Xiao Yicheng,

310
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,350
the company's CTO,

311
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,880
should be increased by 20%.

312
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,390
What do you think?

313
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,430
He would actually be demoted even if he could get a salary raise, right?

314
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,950
Then who will be

315
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:41,910
the company's CEO?

316
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,500
Looks like Ying

317
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,960
is determined to get the position.

318
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:48,830
Maomao,

319
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:51,150
give out the documents to everyone.

320
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,030
Everyone,

321
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,550
I have something

322
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,190
that can prove Mr. Ying

323
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:09,080
colluded with Chen Xiao, a media professional,

324
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,240
to maliciously disclose

325
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,560
[Compared to the bug of Yuyi's translation device 1.0,]

326
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,560
[the bug of the 3.0 version is really weird.]

327
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:12,230
Yuyi's bug in the minority language.

328
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:14,490
[Why hasn't accurate language translation been achieved so far?]

329
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,590
Everyone, take a close look.

330
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:20,970
You are slandering me.

331
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,070
Xiao Yicheng,

332
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,150
this is totally a slander!

333
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:26,510
Mr. Ying,

334
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,310
the police will decide

335
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,590
whether it's a slander or not.

336
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,080
By the way, Mr. Ying,

337
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:40,950
I don't think

338
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,150
someone

339
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,590
who used Yuyi's interests

340
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,270
as a bargaining chip in the internal competition

341
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:47,270
can continue to stay in the company.

342
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:25,670
Mr. Zhang.

343
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,230
You already know, right?

344
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,110
Then tell me

345
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,630
why we lost.

346
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,150
We didn't lose.

347
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:41,230
At least, the Consumer Products Expo still needs us.

348
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,830
The Consumer Products Expo asked us

349
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,030
to cooperate with machines.

350
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,710
It's so ridiculous.

351
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,190
Answer me.

352
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:53,670
Why did Huasheng lose?

353
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:57,070
I don't know.

354
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,230
Take a look.

355
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:20,320
[Employee's Job Transfer Order]

356
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:20,320
[Lin Xi, based on work needs, the company leadership and the administrative personnel department have decided]

357
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:20,320
[to transfer you to the archives office as the director after the Consumer Products Expo project is completed. Your ongoing projects should be handed over immediately.]

358
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:22,910
Mr. Zhang.

359
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:23,790
This transfer order

360
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,500
is supposed to be issued

361
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:28,680
after the Consumer Products Expo project is completed.

362
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,190
But do you think

363
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,990
this is fair to me?

364
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:33,950
Personally,

365
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:35,200
I trust you very much.

366
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,150
I also tried to persuade the headquarters.

367
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:37,920
But...

368
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,670
the headquarters

369
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,150
remotely watched your performance

370
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,710
at the bidding meeting

371
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:45,870
and thinks that you didn't do your best.

372
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,310
So,

373
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:49,830
the company thinks

374
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,390
I lost to Yuyi on purpose.

375
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:59,190
When Director Lu was here,

376
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,350
Director Dong invited me

377
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,750
to participate in the Consumer Products Expo project.

378
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:03,740
I rejected it

379
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,870
because of the conflict of interests.

380
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,390
Later, Director Lu

381
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,910
decided to participate in the support project.

382
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,640
I had to take over this project.

383
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:16,550
And for this project,

384
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,480
I've postponed my wedding.

385
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,150
Because I knew

386
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,950
at this critical moment,

387
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,670
I must devote myself to it.

388
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:29,040
I've done everything I can, Mr. Zhang.

389
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:30,270
I don't understand

390
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,870
why the company is doing this to me.

391
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:34,340
Lin Xi, why didn't you tell me?

392
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,030
What's the point?

393
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:40,000
These are my personal matters.

394
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:42,350
So I've been trying

395
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:44,350
to digest them and strike a balance.

396
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,350
I...

397
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:52,390
I've been working in Huasheng for eight years.

398
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,450
Over the past eight years,

399
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,950
I've never been

400
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,290
so helpless like this.

401
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,230
I...

402
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,640
am sorry.

403
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:10,400
I didn't know you've been through so much.

404
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,610
But from the company's perspective,

405
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:13,630
I have to tell you

406
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:14,630
something.

407
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,150
Recently,

408
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,210
our company has been suffering an abnormal loss of clients.

409
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:24,630
It's not just the Consumer Products Expo's order.

410
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:26,030
Even our regular clients

411
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,310
who have collaborated with us for over 10 years

412
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:29,150
have refused to renew contracts with us.

413
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:31,010
From the company's perspective,

414
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,950
we have to give an explanation.

415
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:37,350
I understand.

416
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,390
Rules are rules.

417
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:42,020
I accept it.

418
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,830
And I promise you

419
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:47,670
I will successfully complete

420
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:49,730
the Consumer Products Expo project.

421
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,070
Where are you?

422
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,310
Let's talk.

[Reject] [Answer]

425
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:59,110
I'm busy right now. It's not convenient.

426
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,240
Either you come here

427
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,500
or I go there.

428
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:18,070
My wife has been demoted.

429
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:20,370
I actually am the last one to know.

430
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,070
Lin Xi,

431
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,670
is there anything else

432
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:26,070
that you haven't told me?

433
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:30,990
No.

434
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:35,110
You want to get married next year.

435
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:35,670
Is it

436
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,930
because of the company's this decision?

437
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,630
Did Wei tell you this?

438
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:44,110
Why did you hide it from me?

439
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,710
You made me think...

440
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:48,390
think you are blaming me

441
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,590
because of Cheng Yao.

442
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:54,150
I don't want you to be worried

443
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:55,510
because of me.

444
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:56,750
Worried?

445
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:59,030
Have you ever considered me

446
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,110
as a family?

447
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,430
I consider you as a family.

448
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,310
That's exactly why

449
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:07,150
I didn't tell you.

450
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:07,920
If I told you,

451
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,920
what would you do?

452
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:10,510
At that time,

453
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,470
you already got demoted by the board of directors.

454
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,630
I don't want you to act impulsively

455
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:15,260
for me.

456
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,190
So you'd rather make yourself wronged

457
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:19,320
and make me misunderstand you, right?

458
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,310
I don't feel wronged.

459
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:28,470
You've been dedicated to Huasheng.

460
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,480
But what have you got in the end?

461
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,390
When the Bluetooth speaker leaked the information,

462
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,790
you were right beside me.

463
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,550
Yuyi's business secret

464
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,150
was right in front of you.

465
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,680
But you didn't tell anyone.

466
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,150
Now they have made you the scapegoat.

467
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:40,410
Do you think it's fair?

468
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:45,510
Recently,

469
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,640
many of Huasheng's clients

470
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,240
have been taken away by Yuyi.

471
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:51,640
Indeed,

472
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:52,790
someone

473
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:54,510
has to take the responsibility.

474
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,910
The company is not wrong.

475
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:00,950
Then you'll just...

476
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:04,310
sort out files in the archives in the future?

477
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:09,510
Think about your dream eight years ago.

478
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:10,960
Your dream is to go to the United Nations

479
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,020
and stand on an international stage.

480
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:15,160
You've worked hard for eight years.

481
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:15,950
And now?

482
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,950

00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:43,600
to choose a side.

562
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:44,830
After you leave,

563
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,070
you can take a rest

564
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,330

00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,670
Actually, Mr. Zhang

566
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:53,950

569
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,480
But he didn't.

00:30:58,630 --> 00:30:59,870
He trusts me.

00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:11,350
Huasheng is just a company

574
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,410
and a cold concept.

575
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,390
But for me,

576
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,870
it represents some specific people,

577
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,070
a group of colleagues

578
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,790
working hard with me.

579
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:25,230
They were part of my life

580
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:27,070
in the past eight years.

581
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,230
So,

582
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,350
I can't run away

583
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,710
at this time

584
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:35,470
just because I feel wronged.

585
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:37,960
Then... are you willing

586
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:40,240
to be transferred to the archives?

587
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:44,960
You know what?

588
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,590
I asked my mom

589
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,650
a question before.

590
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:51,070
Why did she

591
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,550
give up her career

592
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:53,510
and choose to go with my dad

593
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:54,710
because of love?

594
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:57,350
She didn't answer me.

595
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,230
She said

596
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,750
everyone

597
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:01,950
has a different life.

598
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:05,390
Her answer couldn't provide me

599
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,990
with any reference.

600
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:09,730
I didn't understand at that time.

601
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:12,160
But now I've figured it out.

602
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,050
The premise of my question

603
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:16,870
was wrong.

604
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,550
My mother has never

605
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,820
given up her dream.

606
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:22,340
It's just that her dream

607
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,950
took on a different form.

608
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:27,630
When I was little,

609
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,070
I dreamed

610
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:32,670
of standing on the stage of the United Nations.

611
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:34,070
Actually,

612
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,230
my purpose

613
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,510
was to win my grandpa's recognition.

614
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:38,970
I wanted to make him proud on behalf of my mom.

615
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:40,910
But actually, I have won

616
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:42,370
my grandpa's recognition

617
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:44,160
and made him proud long ago.

618
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:49,230
Now,

619
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,110
I want to stand on the stage of the United Nations

620
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,830
because I hope more people

621
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:55,360
can hear the voice of China.

622
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:57,710
So,

623
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:59,270
no matter what position I take up

624
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,350
or what kind of situation I'm in,

625
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,350
as long as I want,

626
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:03,430
I can do it and do it well.

627
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:11,990
So, Xiao Yicheng.

628
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,550
Let's work together this time

629
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:18,110
to let the world hear the voice of China.

630
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,030
Okay?

631
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:21,470
Okay.

632
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:47,880
Director Dong.

633
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:48,950
Lin Xi.

634
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:51,040
Both of you are here.

635
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:51,950
From now on,

636
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:54,110
I hope Huasheng

637
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:56,110
can cooperate with Yuyi wholeheartedly,

638
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:58,230
in an effort to make this year's Consumer Products Expo

639
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,190
a great success.

640
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:01,190
Huasheng will do its best.

641
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:04,910
Mr. Xiao, it's a pleasure working with you.

642
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:06,110
We are cooperating again.

643
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,110
This time,

644
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,389
our cooperation will be more perfect.

645
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:09,120
Definitely.

646
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:19,400
Ms. Tong, please come here.

647
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,989
Okay. You two talk.

648
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,310
Long time no see.

649
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:29,510
But this time...

650
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:31,790
I don't think we are on the same side.

651
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:35,190
We are both serving the Consumer Products Expo.

652
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,790
We are still on the same side in a way.

653
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:38,270
Also, whether personally or otherwise,

654
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:39,790
I'm truly happy for you.

655
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:47,170
[Exhibitors]

656
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:44,909
This year's Consumer Products Expo

657
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:46,060
will have

658
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,030
357 exhibitors

659
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,870
from a total of 61 countries

660
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:49,909
and regions.

661
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,790
A total of 156 exhibitors

662
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,659
will need us to provide an interpretation service.

663
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:55,520
The information is in your hands.

664
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,790
This time,

665
00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:59,510
we will focus more

666
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:01,030
on the exhibitors speaking minority languages.

667
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,070
Next,

668
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,150
I'm going to give you

669
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,270
a preliminary introduction

670
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:05,470
of them.

671
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:08,670
First,

672
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,590
it's Denlinger Indridason.

673
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:11,990
He is currently

674
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:12,710
the chief technology expert

675
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,270
of Fork Medical Equipment Company.

676
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:15,270
Indridason

677
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:17,510
is used to speaking Icelandic slang.

678
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,390
The topic of his speech

679
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:19,470
is the most anticipated

680
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:21,230
during this year's Consumer Products Expo.

681
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,950
This time, he will

682
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:23,870
give a speech at the main forum

683
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:25,380
[Detailed information on the exhibitors speaking minority languages]

684
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:25,630
of the International Economic Forum.

685
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:26,620
His youngest son,

686
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,830
Vedarigson,

687
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:29,070
will also come with him.

688
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,190
Indridason

689
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:31,270
has hearing disorders.

690
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:32,990
But he always has a hearing aid.

691
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:34,230
So there are

692
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:35,830
no communication barriers.

693
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,390
Do we have

694
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:38,630
his hearing aid's model?

695
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:38,950
Yes.

696
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:39,710
We've contacted

697
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:40,920
his team.

698
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,190
According to

699
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:43,110
the hearing aid's model they provided,

700
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:44,710
we have prepared batteries.

701
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,910
For this year's Consumer Products Expo,

702
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:22,070
we have specially prepared

703
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:22,960
1,000 translation devices

704
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,950
equipped with Yuyi's latest translation system.

705
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:25,870
Through our preliminary negotiation

706
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:26,990
with Huasheng,

707
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:28,310
we have agreed to deploy 15 interpreters

708
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:29,830
to cooperate with us in the interpretation work.

709
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:30,950
Of course,

710
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:32,470
we will prepare an exclusive office

711
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:34,750
for Huasheng's interpreters at the expo.

712
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,270
Lin Xi, what do you think?

713
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:39,760
First of all, I'd like to thank Yuyi for your arrangement.

714
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,670
Also, I have

715
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:42,470
a small question.

716
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:44,590
Yuyi's translation devices will play a major role

717
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:47,510
at this year's Consumer Products Expo.

718
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:50,070
But only 15 interpreters from Huasheng

719
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:51,470
will be deployed.

720
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:55,390
Isn't the number too small?

721
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:58,750
After all, there will be many participants.

722
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:01,070
I'm worried we can't provide a thorough service if we don't have enough manpower.

723
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:02,310
Don't worry about this.

724
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:03,230
Through our calculation,

725
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,230
a total of 15 interpreters

726
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,550
are already

727
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,710
more than enough.

728
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:07,710
In fact,

729
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:08,630
according to our original calculation,

730
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:10,440
11 interpreters are already enough.

731
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,390
But we decided to deploy 15 interpreters

732
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:12,510
because there might be

733
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:13,570
some emergencies.

734
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:14,310
Yes.

735
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:15,430
But

736
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:16,960
if only 15 interpreters will be needed,

737
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,800
I can't

738
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,790
allocate mobile personnel

739
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:20,110
to every team.

740
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:20,870
I see.

741
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:22,470
But our translation devices

742
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:25,230
are equipped with the human service connection function.

743
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,150
If an emergency

744
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:27,230
really happens

745
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,160
during the expo,

746
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:28,950
Huasheng's interpreters

747
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,030
can provide an interpretation service

748
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:32,230
in the headquarters' office remotely.

749
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:33,990
Technically speaking,

750
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:35,790
it's indeed not necessary

751
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:37,320
for them to go with the team.

752
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:40,750
But I still think

753
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,470
this is an important occasion.

754
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:45,350
After all, this will be the first time to use translation devices.

755
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:46,590
It would be better

756
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:48,390
if we deploy more people, right?

757
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:54,110
I understand

758
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,470
what you guys mean.

759
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:56,900
Lin Xi,

760
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:59,510
I totally understand

761
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,470
the concern

762
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:01,430
of Huasheng.

763
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:02,510
I also know

764
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:05,190
as a senior interpreter,

765
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,230
you are reminding us sincerely

766
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:08,510
based on your management experience.

767
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:10,110
Also,

768
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:12,510
we've tested

769
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:13,830
Yuyi's translation devices again and again.

770
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:16,430
They are indeed amazing.

771
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:20,070
On behalf of the Consumer Products Expo,

772
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:20,910
I think

773
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:22,950
deploying 15 interpreters

774
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:24,230
is

775
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,030
reasonable.

776
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:27,110
Thank you, Director Dong.

777
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:28,070
Thank you.

778
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:29,990
Got it.

779
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:55,960
What's on your mind?

780
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,880
The number of interpreters?

781
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:10,670
After all, machines are not humans.

782
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:13,150
I'm worried

783
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:14,000
they can't

784
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,230
be very flexible.

785
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:19,910
Just because they are machines, not humans,

786
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:21,350
they are stable.

787
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:28,710
Do you remember

788
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:30,150
how we

789
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:31,230
met again?

790
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:36,540
At your press conference,

791
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:38,230
Ling Feng had diarrhea,

792
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:40,190
so I went to replace him.

793
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,110
I didn't expect you to be the organizer.

794
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:46,830
Although

795
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:48,630
I'm grateful for that accident,

796
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:51,190
from a human's perspective,

797
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:54,590
any accident is unavoidable.

798
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:57,030
But machines are different.

799
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:58,930
They can deliver output steadily

800
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,710
without being affected by emotions

801
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:02,110
or restricted by bodies.

802
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:03,920
And we have a contingency plan.

803
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:12,790
You're still worried?

804
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:19,550
Maybe it's a woman's sixth sense.

805
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:21,710
I always feel uneasy.

806
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:27,510
Come with me.

807
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,310
Come on.

808
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:38,400
♫Probe and approach with memories♫

809
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:36,220
Say over again,

810
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:39,470
and yet once over again,

811
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:44,010
♫Distance is the slowly melting thin ice♫

812
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,150
That thou dost love me.

813
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:46,710
Though the word repeated

814
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:51,470
♫When I find myself in your eyes♫

815
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:50,150
That thou dost love me.

816
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:52,150
Though the word repeated

817
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:57,600
♫What is hidden deep in my heart is awakened♫

818
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:54,990
Should seem "a cuckoo-song,"

819
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:56,190
as thou dost treat it,

820
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:59,670
Belovèd,

821
00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:01,470
♫Some thoughts have no sound♫

822
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:03,540
I, amid the darkness greeted

823
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:09,120
♫Being loved by people I love makes me dizzy with happiness♫

824
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:05,710
By a doubtful spirit-voice,

825
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:07,710
in that doubt's pain

826
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,470
Cry,

827
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:15,500
♫When I hesitate and have doubts, you hold me tight♫

828
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:14,750
"Speak once more—thou lovest!"

829
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:16,870
Who can fear

830
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:18,280
Too many stars,

831
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:20,080
♫I'm sure♫

832
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:19,510
though each in heaven

833
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:20,670
shall roll,

834
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:26,530
♫Embraced by love, hearing your breath♫

835
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:21,790
Too many

836
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:22,790
flowers,

837
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:23,750
though each

838
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:25,070
shall crown the year?

839
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:28,510
Say thou dost love me,

840
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:31,720
♫The trivial and ordinary things in this world♫

841
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:31,920
love me, love me—toll

842
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,200
♫I have many new ideas when I meet you♫

843
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:34,110
The silver iterance!—

844
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,560
only minding,

845
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:41,490
♫Embraced by love, we attracted each other♫

846
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:37,270
Dear,

847
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:39,230
To love me also in silence

848
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:40,430
with thy soul.

849
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:41,870
Too many

850
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:45,440
♫Secrets that haven't been exchanged, you're the answer♫

851
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:43,380
flowers,

852
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:44,790
though each

853
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:46,870
shall crown the year?

854
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:50,560
♫Love means that no matter where we go, our hearts are always together♫

855
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:50,000
Say thou dost love me,

856
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,990
love me, love me—toll

857
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:55,390
The silver iterance!—

858
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:58,140
♫Love♫

859
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:05,150
Do you remember... this poem?

860
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:07,510
You couldn't handle it

861
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:09,540
before you went to Huasheng for an interview.

862
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:11,740
I spent much time reviewing it with you.

863
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,190
This is the first time

864
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:19,990
I use a translation device to translate this poem.

865
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:21,970
Welcome to check our results.

866
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:24,720
No need for that.

867
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:27,750
You wouldn't allow it to make a mistake.

868
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:30,470
Maybe it can't translate some parts

869
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:32,130
as well as human translators,

870
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:37,520
but it's enough to handle the Consumer Products Expo's interpretation work.

871
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:44,350
Why is its translation not good?

872
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:46,150
You have to show me the evidence.

873
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:51,670
I admit

874
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:53,990
Yuyi's translation device

875
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:55,470
can switch among languages

876
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:57,440
efficiently and accurately.

877
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:00,670
Xixi,

878
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:02,210
I didn't bring you here

879
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:04,950
to prove that I can defeat you.

880
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:06,070
I brought you here

881
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:08,400
because I want to eliminate your anxiety.

882
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:15,910
Considering what I'm worried about,

883
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:17,430
am I pretentious?

884
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:20,310
Do you think I'm a joke?

885
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:42,510
Actually,

886
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:45,310
artificial intelligence translation,

887
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:46,970
just like human translation,

888
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:48,590
is just a carrier.

889
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:52,500
It can touch human feelings

890
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:54,600
and preserve human civilization.

891
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:56,790
It can also discover

892
00:44:56,950 --> 00:44:58,590
a bigger world

893
00:44:58,990 --> 00:45:01,110
and more languages.

894
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:03,950
When the communication between people

895
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:06,150
requires human intermediaries,

896
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:08,910
what they can reach

897
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:09,990
is really limited.

898
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:13,970
But artificial intelligence is different.

899
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:15,990
It will

900
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:17,510
keep expanding its boundaries

901
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:19,640
with the development of human wisdom.

902
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:22,190
It is both the unknown

903
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:23,990
and the future.

904
00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:27,770
Listen to it yourself.

905
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:30,670
Say over again,

906
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:33,110
and yet once over again,

907
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:36,630
That thou dost love me.

908
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:40,590
Though the word repeated

909
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:42,710
That thou dost love me.

910
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:45,110
Though the word repeated

911
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:48,470
Should seem "a cuckoo-song,"

912
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:50,220
as thou dost treat it.
