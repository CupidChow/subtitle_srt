00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,750
judging from your face,

289
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,540
I could tell that something is missing.

290
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,310
Uncle,

291
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,390

00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:55,510
Of course I can.

295
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,270
Face reading

296
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,260
uses the heart.

297
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,350
I'm not here for face reading.

298
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,950
I'm just looking around.

299
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:11,020
A gentleman doesn't go around without a jade for no reason.

300
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,470
Since ancient times,

301
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,470
jade

302
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:14,990
has been highly respected

303
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,390
among scholars in China.

304
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:17,940
We, men,

305
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,110
must have a piece of jade with us.

306
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:20,770
What do you think of this jade?

307
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:22,870
I'm not buying for myself.

308
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,670
I'm buying as a gift for someone.

309
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,030
For someone?

310
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,950
I think it must be for a girl.

311
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:37,560
If a jade resembles the beauty of the lady you admire,

312
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:40,510
you'll cherish the jade even more.

313
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,470
What kind of jade do you want?

314
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,740
I want one that is

315
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:49,230
a little whiter, a little more transparent

316
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,160
and a little shinier than this one.

317
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,390
You know jades well.

318
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,990
I can tell you want a good jade.

319
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:01,110
This is one that I collect.

320
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,440
I didn't plan to sell it.

321
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:03,490
Take a look.

322
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,190
Can I see it?

323
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:07,990

324
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:08,990
Thank you.

325
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,410
This is a high quality "mutton fat" jade,

326
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,270
only for the fated one.

327
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,190
I'll take this then.

328
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:20,990
How much is it?

329
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,110
It's so tacky to talk about artwork in terms of money.

330
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,350
Let's not talk about money today.

331
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,680
We only talk about fate.

332
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,030
Sure.

333
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,870
88,000 fate.

334
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:48,470
Come in.

335
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:52,030
Well,

336
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,840
can we have a quick talk?

337
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:55,670
What is it?

338
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,470
Nothing big.

339
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:00,430
It's just...

340
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:02,910
About the royalties from earlier on...

341
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:04,470
The finance department

342
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,390
should have transferred it to you.

343
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,070
You didn't receive it?

344
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,230
I did.

345
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,750
I want to ask

346
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,710
if the payment can be higher.

347
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:14,950
These

348
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,590
were already fixed back then.

349
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:18,270
And your rate

350
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,870
is considered to be the highest

351
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,600
among freelance translators.

352
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,870
Then, are there

353
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:27,600
any other jobs recently?

354
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,510
The kind that pays high

355
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:29,430
and quick.

356
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,440
What happened to you?

357
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,550
Nothing.

358
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:39,270
If you don't

359
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,200
explain it to me clearly,

360
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,070
I wouldn't know

361
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,510
how to help you.

362
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,550
Well...

363
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,430
I accidentally

364
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,750
broke Tong Xin's bracelet

365
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,470
earlier on.

366
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,600
That bracelet seems important to her.

367
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,270
I asked about it.

368
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,390
The price is a bit expensive.

369
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,550
I want to make money

370
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,510
and get her a new one.

371
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:01,270
That's it.

372
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,030
That's it.

373
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,540
If you are really

374
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,109
in need of money,

375
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,630
I have a simultaneous interpretation task.

376
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:14,589
It's not easy.

377
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,109
I'll go.

378
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:00,990
Suspend the

379
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:01,910
the IPO declaration?

380
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:02,630

00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,270
I won't be able to make it in time for the movie.

575
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:03,030
It's okay. Work is more important.

576
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:03,910
Just go.

577
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:04,920
Take care.

578
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:07,310
Okay.

579
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,400
Come to me.

580
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:39,310
Xi, what's up?

581
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:41,470
How's the translation related to

582
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:42,720
Yuyi's overseas PE fundraising going?

583
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,510
I've assigned the task to the translation department.

584
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:45,790
I've checked with Mr. Xu.

585
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:47,990
It's expected to be finished next week.

586
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,470
Don't rush.

587
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:51,110
There might be another investment company.

588
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:51,790
I'll send the information to you

589
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:52,910
when it's confirmed.

590
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:53,510
Okay.

591
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,350
There's a project

592
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,670
that needs

593
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:56,550
an escort interpreter.

594
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,280
I've sent you the information.

595
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:00,390
Escort interpreting

596
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:02,110
is not within my job responsibilities.

597
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,170
Is there a problem?

598
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,950
No.

599
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:06,790
Go.

603
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:33,870
I saw you frown

604
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:34,910
from far away.

605
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:35,710
What's wrong?

606
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:40,350
The she-devil gave me a new task.

607
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,990
Gallery construction.

608
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,310
I know about this.

609
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:48,820
I heard the designer

610
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:49,960
is dramatic and pretentious.

611
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,750
The interpreter even needs to go to the construction site with the designer.

612
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:52,590
No one in the company

613
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,390
wants to do it.

614
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,590
No wonder she gave the task to me.

615
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:59,510
I'm just her assistant.

616
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,470
But now I have to do

617
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,990
the front office's job.

618
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,590
Did you offend her?

619
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:09,310
I'd never dare.

620
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,710
You must have done something wrong.

621
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:12,910
She's punishing you.

622
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:27,630
If there's nothing wrong

623
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:28,630
with Professor Chen Ji's project,

624
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:30,090
I'll submit the document.

625
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,350
What's the rush?

626
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,520
I'm not in a rush.

627
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,230
Is there a problem?

628
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:41,590
Are you worried about the document

629
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,480
or are you worried

630
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,010
about Professor Chen's meeting with Shasha?

631
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,510
Fine. There's nothing wrong with the document.

632
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:54,240
Submit it.

633
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:56,950
By the way,

634
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:59,350
you handed over the gallery project

635
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:00,430
to Chen Wen?

636
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:01,740
I hope

637
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,670
she's not only my assistant.

638
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:05,130
You want her to work on tasks independently?

639
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,360
Her internship is almost over.

640
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:08,750
The company will evaluate her.

641
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,470
It will be good for her

642
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:12,000
if she can get a higher rank.

643
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:13,790
But everyone knows

644
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,470
it's a difficult project.

645
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:16,990
She's a girl. Can she do it?

646
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,670
No pain, no gain.

647
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,490
But you didn't have to go this far.

648
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,470
Do you remember Katarina?

649
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,690
The first she-devil in Huasheng?

650
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,230
When I first joined Huasheng as an intern,

651
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,750
she was my mentor.

652
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,710
Well,

653
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:34,950
you really seem to have inherited something

654
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:36,310
from her.

655
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,660
Back then, I was just like Chen Wen.

656
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,670
I knew nothing.

657
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:41,590
Every day,

658
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:43,230
Katarina asked me

659
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:45,280
to do proofreading

660
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,990
and check forms and formats,

661
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:50,270
including full-width and half-width characters,

662
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:52,030
conversion of symbols,

663
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,030
and layouts.

664
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:55,230
Once I made a tiny mistake,

665
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:56,510
she'd scold me harshly

666
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,630
and ask me to do it again.

667
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,590
I remember

668
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:00,830
I seldom got off work before 9 pm

669
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:01,990
during that period.

674
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:11,310
and satisfy her.

675
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:14,550
I thought she was making things hard for me.

676
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:15,910
Why?

677
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,930
I didn't understand at that time.

678
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:20,870
But later,

679
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:22,710
after I took over the priority client management department,

680
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:24,170
I suddenly understood it.

when they're young.

684
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:32,150
But work is boring

685
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,350
by its nature.

686
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:35,310
It shouldn't be abstract.

687
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:37,110
Instead, you should work with your feet on the ground

688
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:39,030
and with your own actions.

689
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:43,790

690
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:45,450
was building your character.

691
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:46,740
Spare the rod and spoil the child.

692
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,070
I've been through this.

693

Since you care so much about her,

694
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,670
why don't you find a chance

695
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:54,130
to talk to her face to face?

I take directions and locations into consideration.

00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:05,950
It looks ordinary.

Just make it the same as this one.

757
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:18,670
I can make a replica

They are both suet white jade.

763
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:28,990
Suet white jade.

764
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:31,110
A piece of suet white jade has 3 important features,

765
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:31,830
including

766
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:32,790
its glossiness,

767
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,230
density,

768
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:35,470
and weight.

769
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:38,200
Considering these 3 features,

770
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:39,990
you can easily buy a piece like this

771
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:42,030
on the market

772
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,630
for 200 to 300 yuan.

773
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,430
200 to 300 yuan?

774
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:50,630
Young man,

775
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:53,270
you can bring me that piece of jade.

776
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:54,750
I can repair it

777
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:55,950
with my best skills.

778
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:59,310
It will be much more valuable than this one.

779
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:07,750
Swindler!

780
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:17,270
You've been swearing for half an hour.

781
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:19,430
What are you going to do?

782
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:21,270
What can I do?

783
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:22,990
I can only swear.

784
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:25,870
This is not like you, Yaoyao.

785
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:27,800
Aren't you going to call the police?

786
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,990
What's the use of calling the police?

787
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:30,150
He ran away long ago.

788
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:32,180
Let me give you an idea.

789
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,550
Tell me, Grandaunt.

790
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:37,310
You teach a minority language online

791
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:39,710
for free, right?

792
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,340
You can tell your viewers

793
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,230
about this.

794
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:44,430
It's like reminding them

795
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:45,760
to protect themselves.

796
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:48,550
Forget it.

797
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,310
You are not going to take revenge?

798
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:52,670
This is not like you.

799
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:53,950
You've changed?

800
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,960
It's mainly because I think it's useless.

801
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:00,590
I think you're afraid that someone will find out.

802
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,230
Why...

803
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:05,110
Why would I?

804
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,750
You're afraid the person you bought this stone for

805
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:09,110
will find out.

806
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:12,670
I bought it for myself.

807
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:16,070
When did you start collecting jade stones?

808
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:18,270
Is it once in a blue moon already?

809
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:19,710
Grandaunt,

810
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:22,170
I'm upset enough that you didn't comfort me.

811
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,230
How about this?

812
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,230
I'll pay 200 yuan

813
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,550
to buy this stone

814
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:29,950
to reduce your loss.

815
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:33,070
But

816
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,220
it's neither big nor small.

817
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:37,720
It's too light to be used as a paperweight.

818
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:40,950
How about giving me a discount? 180 yuan.

819
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:42,830
Grandaunt.

820
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:48,310
I can tell

821
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:49,750
fate has brought you to me.

822
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,590
I have some good things here.

823
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:52,550
Let me show you.

824
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,230
Look at this.

825
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,830
H-Handsome guy.

826
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:06,600
What?

827
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,110
You chose the wrong place

828
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:09,030
this morning?

829
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,150
Or it wasn't fate that brought me to you this time?

830
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,110
Of course

831
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,970
it was fate that brought you here.

832
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:15,610
Don't leave in a hurry.

833
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:18,430
Let me tell your fortune.

834
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:21,510
I think fate will bring you

835
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,750
to the police today.

836
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,830
You're back.

837
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:40,670
Are you tired?

838
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:41,990
Did it go well?

839
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,030
Yes.

840
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:03,350
Did you meet Lawrence?

841
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,590
Did he agree to invest in Yuyi?

842
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:11,070
We have a conference call

843
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,180
tomorrow morning.

844
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,510
You must have been waiting for me for a long time.

845
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:18,440
I haven't eaten.

846
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,030
Let's order takeout.

847
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:22,990
You haven't eaten?

848
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:24,550
I didn't have time.

849
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:29,110
Barbecue? Seafood? Sushi?

850
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:30,510
No need.

851
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:31,430
Let me cook for you.

852
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:32,510
Let me see what we have in the fridge.

853
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:33,390
It's too much trouble.

854
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:34,270
Not at all.

855
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,360
[Tong Xin] [Decline] [Answer]

856
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,680
Take the call.

857
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,630
I'm going to cook for you.

858
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:41,310
Okay.

859
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:50,630
Hello, Tong Xin.

860
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:51,390
Xiao.

861
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:52,830
I've sent you the R&D results

862
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:54,550
on the brain-to-speech translator.

863
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:56,280
Are you sure you want to do this?

864
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:58,470
Lawrence's ultimate dream

865
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:00,390
is to combine brains with machines.

866
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:01,510
He even formed

867
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:03,020
a specialized R&D team.

868
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,310
I know.

869
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:05,310
Last month,

870
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:06,190
they published their results

871
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:07,030
in Science.

872
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,150
Actually, I'm quite optimistic about the future

873
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:09,910
of the combination of brains and machines.

874
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:11,510
So Yuyi is conceiving

875
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:13,310
a brain-to-speech translator.

876
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:15,630
But this is just

877
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:16,670
a concept this year.

878
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:18,190
It's not fully-developed.

879
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:19,320
I'm afraid

880
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:21,150
it's too risky.

881
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:22,870
I have no other choice.

882
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,870
I only have half an hour tomorrow

883
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:25,840
to persuade him.

884
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:28,750
So,

885
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:30,750
I have to take the risk.

886
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:32,910
What if Lawrence

887
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:35,040
is just using this to keep you waiting?

888
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,510
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed

889
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:37,190
after

890
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:38,870
putting so much hope into it.

891
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:42,710
Tong Xin.

892
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:44,950
No matter what the result is,

893
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,230
I'll do my best.

894
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,020
You finished the call?

895
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:04,590
My breeder.

896
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,990
What delicious food are you cooking for me?

897
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:08,710
I can't cook any fancy food

898
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:10,070
with the ingredients available at home.

899
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,230
So I decided to

900
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,310
make tomato and egg noodles

901
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:13,500
for you.

902
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:16,430
Great.

903
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:20,070
You know what?

904
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:22,150
When I was abroad,

905
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,950
not only did I miss you the most,

906
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,680
but I also missed the food you cooked for me.

907
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,350
Your stomach will tell you

908
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:35,190
where your home is.

909
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:39,560
That's no longer a problem now.

910
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:40,750
I can eat

911
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,150
as much as I want,

912
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,360
right?

913
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:51,190
Alright.

914
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:52,270
It's not ready yet.

915
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:53,310
Take a rest.

916
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:55,170
I'll let you know when it's ready.

917
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:00,030
Be careful.

918
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:21,270
It's ready.

919
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:41,430
Did I wake you up?

920
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:43,440
No.

921
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:46,070
The delicious smell woke me up.

922
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:49,190
It's ready.

923
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:51,590
Get up and have a few bites before you sleep.

924
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:53,990
Get up.

925
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:00,430
It smells so good.

926
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:02,070
Try it

927
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:04,200
and see if it tastes the same as before.

928
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:09,990
That's it.

929
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:17,190
Xiao Yicheng.

930
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:19,870
You've changed a lot.

931
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:24,270
The new me

932
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:25,550
and the old me,

933
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:28,230
which one do you prefer?
