196

198

I just don't want you to have any regrets.

199
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:39,990
But about the author's name of this book,

200
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,120
I really didn't know the truth.

201
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,140
If I had known it, I...

202
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,200
Alright. Alright.

203
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,510
It's water under the bridge.

204
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,190
Fame and fortunes don't matter that much.

205
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:48,910
I'll go.

206
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,880
I'll definitely go to his banquet.

207
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,850
Also because of you,

208
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,630
I must go there.

209
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,230
I will have him know

210
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,750
that his daughter

211
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:06,990
is very lucky

212
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,950

213

Your dad's at a high cholesterol level.

217

Your mom truly cares about me, doesn't she?

218
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:43,660
Mom,

219
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,630
I still don't understand.

220
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,150
What?

221
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,430
After what Professor Gao has done to you,

222
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,630
why would you still choose to come here?

223
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,230
Well, yesterday,

224
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:59,190
I happened to read a poem

225
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:04,250
saying, "Time goes fast like how morning dew disappears."

226
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,430
It's been 30 years.

227
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:08,670
I think it's time to have a closure.

228
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,740
No matter what,

229
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,950
as long as it's your decision,

230
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:15,950
I'll support it.

you must take some time out of this afternoon

234
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,430
to keep your mother company.

235
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,310
Take her out for a hairdo and a beauty treatment.

Don't listen to him.

242
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,590
That's too much.

This time, I'll take Lin's advice.

00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:41,990
Then after lunch,

Of course.

00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,190
There are a few shops ahead

256
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,030

257
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:35,950
Why don't you go take your pick?

258
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:36,710
I'm not going.

259
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,310

262

This is the address.

It's someone's home, isn't it?

264
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,050
You'll know when you get there.

268

is it really the cheongsam you wore

for your 20th birthday to celebrate the start of your adulthood?

273

Yes.

274
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,870
It was made by Uncle Xu years ago.

when you were this little,

to make new clothes.

281

Yes.

282

No matter how many years have passed,

283
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,150
when I am wearing the clothes you made,

284
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,880
I still feel very comfortable.

285
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:42,990
Look how delicate the embroidery is!

286
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:43,790
Nowadays,

287
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:46,590
one can barely find any embroidery as good as this.

288

302
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:23,750

00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:00,590
Hello. Hello.

382
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,470
Auntie Liu.

383
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,350
There you are.

384
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,230
Good to see you.

385
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,360
Come on. Have a seat.

386
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:12,110
[Gao Henian] [Gao Ling] [Tan Shasha]

387
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:09,440
Come.

388
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:11,350
Sit there.

389
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:13,550
Dad,

390
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,950
our names aren't on it.

391
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:15,470
Where should we sit?

392
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,310
Xixi!

393
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:17,990
Come here!

394
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:19,710
Auntie Zhao.

395
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:20,950
Come here.

396
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:21,990
Sure.

397
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:23,550
Excuse me.

398
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:28,910
Look!

399
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,110
You've been arranged

400
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,350
to sit at my table.

401
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,230
[Lin Xi] [Lin Dayong] [Zhao Tianyu]

402
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,790
Is it a mistake or what?

403
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,440
You shouldn't be at this table.

404
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,060
Pretty nice. It's quiet here.

405
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,260
Yes. It's quiet here.

406
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,550
Then have a seat.

407
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:39,510
Quite convenient, too.

408
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:40,790
Convenient for us to sneak out.

409
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:41,710
Correct answer.

410
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,670
I'll say hello to others then.

411
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:43,510
See you later.

412
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:54,810
Have you eaten yet?

413
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:55,950
The banquet has just started.

414
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,390
I wish I hadn't come here.

415
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,240
What's wrong?

416
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:01,230
It's just boring.

417
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,150
I shouldn't be working overtime right now.

418
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,270
I'd rather be with you and get bored together.

419
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:15,070
Go inside and take a seat.

420
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:15,750
Will you?

421
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:17,960
Alright. See you later.

422
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:19,870
Dad.

423
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,150
Let me introduce them to you.

424
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:23,610
-Professor Gao.
-This...

425
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:25,830
Do you remember me?

426
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,750
I'm Xiao Kaiyun.

427
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,220
Steven!

428
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,830
Professor Gao still remembers

429
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:35,790
my English name!

430
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,150
You know each other?

431
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:39,780
He's a much younger friend of mine.

432
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:41,350
Come on. Have a seat.

433
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,430
Sit down.

434
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,510
Oh, come on.

435
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:44,400
You're friends with my dad.

436
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,590
Why didn't you tell me?

437
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,740
Until we came up here,

438
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:50,070
we didn't realize Mr. Gao was your father.

439
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:52,360
Dad, how did you get to know each other?

440
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,990
We met four or five years ago, right?

441
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:57,270
It was five years ago.

442
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,270
We were in an special exhibition about Dunhuang

443
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,910
in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

444
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:01,950
Yes, we were.

445
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:05,110
We struggled for a long time to think of

446
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:07,470
the translation about some wall paintings and scriptures.

447
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,630
That was a really

448
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:10,470
tough problem.

449
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:12,070
Thanks to Mr. Gao,

450
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:14,510
the exhibition ended up a success.

451
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,630
I remember it!

452
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:17,910
At that time, dad, you worked

453
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:19,390
for the Cultural Heritage Administration,

454
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:20,030
didn't you?

455
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:20,710
Yes.

456
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,440
Mr. Gao,

457
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,300
do you remember

458
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:26,750
that we published a book years ago?

459
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:27,390
Yes.

460
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,830
It's about a comparison between the arts and crafts in China and the Western countries.

461
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:33,630
Mr. Gao,

462
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:36,830
you have such a good memory.

463
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:37,750
I wouldn't say so.

464
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,550
I'm getting older and worse year by year.

465
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:40,750
That's not true.

466
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,110
You haven't changed a bit.

467
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,710
You're still very spirited.

468
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:46,590
Are you still

469
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,110
living abroad?

470
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,350
We've decided to stay here.

471
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:51,110
Now Kaiyun is working in the Hangzhou Academy of Art

472
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,630
as a doctoral supervisor.

473
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,070
That's good.

474
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:57,270
It's all about teaching and nurturing students.

475
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,550
That's terrific.

476
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,510
I'm just trying to be a virtuous person.

477
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,710
I've been living abroad for many years.

478
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:05,110
It's time I came back and make a contribution to the country.

479
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,510
That's right.

480
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,510
Welcome back.

481
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:08,550
When my husband

482
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,870
Shujun's contract is ended,

483
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:10,990
I'll also ask him to come back here.

484
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,640
Being with the family is best thing ever.

485
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,550
Right, Dad?

486
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:14,950
That's right.

487
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:16,590
Dad,

488
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,030
it's getting late.

489
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:19,390
Why don't we get in the room now?

490
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:20,390
Sure. Sure. Sure.

491
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:20,990
Come on.

492
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:21,920
Great. Let's go.

493
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:22,910
Mr. Gao, please.

494
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:23,550
Let's go.

495
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:24,100
Sure.

496
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,030
Mr. Gao, come on.

497
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:30,870
Be seated.

498
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,790
Thank you, everyone. Thank you.

499
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,590
Thank you. Thank you.

500
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:38,830
Hello.

501
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:39,510
Hello. Hello.

502
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:40,150
Thank you.

503
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,590
Have a seat, everyone!

504
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:44,790
Xixi.

505
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:46,350
I’ll go find out

506
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,190
who has taken your seat.

507
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,030
Where is your son?

508
00:24:58,910 --> 00:24:59,990
He'll be here soon.

509
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,350
I told him

510
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,310
his dad had left his diabetic medicine behind.

511
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,510
So he'd bring it to us.

512
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,110
It's great.

513
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:09,030
Where is your daughter?

514
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:10,110
Daughter?

515
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,230
Right over there!

516
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,090
Here she comes.

517
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:14,430
Mommy,

518
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,560
everything in the kitchen is fine now.

519
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:18,350
Come on. Greet this lady here.

520
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,350
Hello, Auntie.

521
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:20,190
Hello.

522
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,350
How old are you?

523
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:23,810
-This is a never-ending nightmare.
-I'm 25.

524
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,830
What do you think? A good match, isn't she?

525
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:28,030
Yes.

526
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:32,110
What has your son been doing since he returned to the country?

527
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,910
He started some sort of a company

528
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:36,060
about a translation device or stuff.

529
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,310
Translator device?

530
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:40,590
Translation device... Is it Yuyi?

531
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,190
Do you know that?

532
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:44,510
Is your son Xiao Yicheng,

533
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,720
Mr. Xiao?

534
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:47,950
Do you know him?

535
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:50,110
He's a client of Huasheng.

536
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:52,510
How wonderful!

537
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:53,870
It's destiny!

538
00:25:58,630 --> 00:25:59,550
Guess

539
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,110
who are seated there!

540
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,390
Who?

541
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,710
A married couple who happens to be Gao Ling's friends.

542
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:06,550
They plan

543
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:08,910
to fix their son up with Tan Shasha.

544
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,720
What do they do for a living?

545
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,830
I don't know.

546
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,660
The husband seems to be a college professor.

547
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,270
A college professor?

548
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,750
That's quite a perfect match.

549
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,430
Mom, I've arrived.

550
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:23,430
Come out here.

551
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:35,910
Yicheng.

552
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:36,430
Mom.

553
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,870
I've brought you the medicine.

554
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:39,000
I'll get going then.

555
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,270
Hold on!

556
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:42,250
Let me introduce you to a girl.

557
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:43,060
No need.

558
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:45,350
She's Professor Gao's granddaughter.

559
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,870
Quite a nice girl.

560
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,290
Mom, are you talking about

561
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:55,400
the granddaughter of the famous translator Mr. Gao?

562
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:56,830
Yes.

563
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:58,200
Which one?

564
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,300
Which else could it be?

565
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:02,690
She works as an interpreter in Huasheng.

566
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:12,250
Do you know each other?

567
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:14,780
I just met with her.

568
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,270
Well...

569
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,800
What do you think of her?

570
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,310
Great, of course.

571
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:24,480
First thing first,

572
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,670
I'll just stay a moment.

573
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:27,030
Fine. Come with me.

574
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:27,710
I have something to do later.

575
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:28,550
I know.

576
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:29,950
Just go meet her.

577
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:32,590
Mr. Xiao, help yourself with the food.

578
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,230
Come on.

579
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:34,230
This one's nice too, isn't it?

580
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:34,950
Come on.

581
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:35,580
Alright.

582
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:36,550
Cheers!

583
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:38,310
Professor Gao.

584
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:40,950
I wish you a long

585
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:41,920
and happy life.

586
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,270
Why is he here?

587
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,530
Did you ask him to come?

588
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:47,030
No.

589
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,670
He said he was working overtime in the office.

590
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:49,530
I'll go get him.

591
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,910
Let's just wait and see what happens.

592
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:55,170
Do you know each other?

593
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:56,990
Dad,

594
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:59,210
you seem to know everyone, don't you?

595
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,030
He's a rising star in the AI industry.

596
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:02,430
Who wouldn't know of him?

597
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:03,480
Mr. Yi.

598
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:04,910
Come. Have a seat.

599
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,350
Here. Sit here.

600
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,350
Go. Sit there.

601
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:14,870
Where is your daughter?

602
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:16,870
Well, maybe she's on the phone.

603
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:18,070
She'll be right back.

604
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,800
You won't be bored anymore.

605
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:31,630
Mr. Xiao,

606
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:34,110
did you study abroad?

607
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:34,950
Yes.

608
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,190
What was your major?

609
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:37,250
Computer science.

610
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:39,870
The translation device developed by Mr. Xiao

611
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:42,230
plays a leading role in the industry.

612
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:44,550
Mr. Yi, thank you for the compliment.

613
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,910
It seems that my family

614
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:47,830
shares so many similarities with yours.

615
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,060
My daughter Shasha

616
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,590
had also studied abroad before she returned.

617
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:54,070
Yes. You've told me that.

618
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,150
The college Shasha went to

619
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,100
is quite close to yours.

620
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,750
Yes. It's just next to his college.

621
00:28:58,750 --> 00:28:59,870
I wish we had got to

622
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,030
know that earlier.

623
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:02,550
It's destiny, isn't it?

624
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,750
It sure is.

625
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:04,190
Mom...

626
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,870
Shasha, come on.

627
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:08,310
Mr. Xiao?

628
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:09,830
Shasha.

629
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:12,550
Now that you know him,

630
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,590
stop calling him "Mr. Xiao".

631
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,270
Just call him Yicheng.

632
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,670
Mom, but...

633
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:17,310
Shasha, sit here. Sit.

634
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,550
Where are you?

635
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:23,710
How come I haven't seen you?

636
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:24,770
What is this about?

637
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:26,990
I'll check it out.

638
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:30,390
Calm down, Lin.

639
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:32,310
Come on.

640
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:35,050
Eat it. It'll soothe your nerves.

641
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:48,270
Uncle.

642
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:50,260
Xixi.

643
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:51,670
There you are.

644
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,600
I've got a question for you.

645
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,470
What were you doing there?

646
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:56,710
No. I... I...

647
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:57,350
Uncle,

648
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:59,150
I really didn't see that coming.

649
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:00,910
Mr. Xiao,

650
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,680
this is not your seat.

651
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,790
Xixi, I...

652
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:07,920
I really didn't know it'd be like that.

653
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,030
You see...

654
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,150
Yicheng!

655
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:16,390
Come!

656
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,190
Sure. Right away.

657
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:18,900
Right away.

658
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,430
Xixi...

659
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:22,390
Knock it off.

660
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:23,550
They want you there.

661
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,350
Uncle,

662
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,470
I'll explain to you later.

663
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:27,530
I'll be right back.

664
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,250
You're even smiling!

665
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:36,530
[Hello, I'm Xiaoyi.]

666
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:37,870
[Reboot] [Power off]

667
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,040
[Click to power off]

668
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:45,190
Xixi.

669
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:47,030
I came here because I needed to bring my dad his medicine.

670
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:49,490
I really didn't know what would happen here.

671
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,150
Thanks. Thanks.

672
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,830
Dad, have some fish.

673
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:56,680
Shasha.

674
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:57,720
Eat.

675
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:58,750
Sorry,

676
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,830
The subscriber you have dialed cannot be connected at this time.

677
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:01,470
Sorry,

678
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:04,790
the subscriber you have dialed cannot be connected at this time.

679
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:05,920
The battery's dead!

680
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:07,950
I...

681
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,190
Xixi, don’t be afraid.

682
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:13,930
Dad's here for you.

683
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,310
No one can hurt you.

684
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,070
It's meat.

685
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,750
Look at that smirk on your face.

686
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:23,830
Be careful. Your boyfriend

687
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:25,030
might be stolen away.

688
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,190
Lin,

689
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:30,270
later on, we'll go over there and propose a toast.

690
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,230
Come on, eat.

691
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:49,000
You are familiar with each other.

692
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,230
Why do you look so awkward?

693
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,430
Yeah.

694
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,310
Mr. Xiao and I

695
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:55,770
aren't that familiar.

696
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:58,590
You're both young people. Stop calling him "Mr. Xiao."

697
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:00,150
You'll call him "Yicheng"

698
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:01,830
and he'll call you "Shasha." Isn't it nice?

699
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,300
"Dear Yicheng" is also fine.

700
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,510
-Mom.
-Mommy.

701
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:05,790
We are really not that familiar.

702
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,390
Then who is familiar with?

703
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,150
He's familiar with Lin Xi.

704
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:12,790
Who is Lin Xi?

705
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:17,310
My dad's other granddaughter.

706
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:21,230
I have one more daughter.

707
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:24,030
Aren't you

708
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,230
Professor Gao's only daughter?

709
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,470
Aunt,

710
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:29,630
it turns out that it is

711
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:31,560
what you have been telling people.

712
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,110
Uncle.

713
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,110
Do you know each other?

714
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,350
He is Mr. Xiao from Yuyi Tianxia.

715
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:42,540
He's known to everyone, isn't he?

716
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,630
The company he founded

717
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:44,760
will soon go public.

718
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,520
What a briliant young man!

719
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,790
Is this supposed to be a blind date?

720
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:50,630
-Yeah.
-No...

721
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:52,870
Oh, good.

722
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,510
I didn't know you took a liking to liars.

723
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,110
No.

724
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,270
Uncle, you've taken it wrong.

725
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:57,230
Seeing is believing.

726
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,560
What have I taken wrong?

727
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:01,270
Knock it off.

728
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,350
He's making a fool of you.

729
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:04,150
Why are you still defending him?

730
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:07,540
Uncle.

731
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,290
Professor Gao.

732
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:10,350
Auntie.

733
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,180
I'm terribly sorry.

734
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:14,670
Today, I came here

735
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:15,510
because my mom told me

736
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:17,070
to bring my dad his medicine.

737
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:19,200
I didn't mean to have a blind date here.

738
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,510
Besides,

739
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:23,390
I already have a girlfriend.

740
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:24,630
Get off her.

741
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,890
Are you still trying to fool my daughter?

742
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:32,310
Uncle,

743
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,370
please hear me out.

744
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:39,530
I'd like to make a formal introduction here.

745
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:41,190
Lin Xi

746
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:42,670
is my girlfriend.

747
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:46,590
Auntie,

748
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:49,770
I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression.

749
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,710
Are you already in a relationship?

750
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:55,270
Yes.

751
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:57,830
Lin Xi,

752
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:01,270
you're already in a relationship with him.

753
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:03,390
You saw us trying to fix

754
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:05,230
your boyfriend up with Shasha.

755
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:07,150
Then you revealed the truth in front of people.

756
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:08,880
That's a thrill for you, right?

757
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:11,030
I didn't know anything.

758
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,030
Stop pretending.

759
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:14,739
I really knew nothing about it.

760
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:16,310
Even he has said that he had no idea

761
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:17,830
what would happened before he came.

762
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:18,630
That's true, Auntie.

763
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,070
I didn't figure all this out until after I came here.

764
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:20,790
Stealing things away from people

765
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:23,750
has given you a great sense of achievement, hasn't it?

766
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,270
How could you accuse of stealing?

767
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:26,830
He's always been my boyfriend to start with.

768
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:28,389
Now you've finally admitted it.

769
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:29,429
You've been waiting for this moment,

770
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:30,150
haven't you?

771
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,510
You just want to humiliate me

772
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:32,710
in front of everyone!

773
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:35,400
If you have a bone to pick with, come at me.

774
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,750
Why must you hurt Shasha?

775
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:37,830
She's your little sister after all!

776
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:38,190
Mommy.

777
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:39,070
Auntie.

778
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:40,790
You're elder than me

779
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:43,190
but you're not entitled to be unreasonable.

780
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,110
Xiao Yicheng and I

781
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,710
have known each other for a long time.

782
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:47,770
There's no such thing as "stealing".

783
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:49,150
Fine.

784
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,510
If you insist

785
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:51,150
that I have stolen him,

786
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,590
I'd also like to ask you

787
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:54,670
when you will return what you owe my mother

788
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:55,429
to her?

789
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,070
I owe her?

790
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:01,270
What do I owe her?

791
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,980
The Full English Collection of Li Bai's Poetry.

792
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,870
You stole her right to put her name on it

793
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,010
as the author, didn't you?

794
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:24,310
Xixi,

795
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:27,550
There are some things you don't know.

796
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,950
Then make them clear now.

797
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,960
What? Are you feeling guilty?

798
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:38,870
Why... Why would I feel guilty?

799
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:39,950
Why not take out your translation manuscript

800
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:40,790
so we can do a comparison?

801
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:42,390
Say no more!

802
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:43,670
Dad.

803
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:45,440
-Now that she...
-Grandpa.

804
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,790
Over all these years,

805
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,550
my mom has been in misery.

806
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:53,310
She's been holding a grudge.

807
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,070
Now 30 years have passed,

808
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,390
and we just want an answer.

809
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:57,960
We aren't asking for too much, are we?

810
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,670
Dad,

811
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:00,150
now that she's eager for the truth,

812
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:01,220
we should tell her about it.

813
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,310
I'm telling you,

814
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:03,910
-this matter was...
-Gao Ling!

815
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:04,990
Dad!

816
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:06,470
Why don't you tell her the truth?

817
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:07,000
Listen, you...

818
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,470
Stop talking!

819
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:07,570
[Nurse Station]

820
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,150
Wenli.

821
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,280
Professor Gao will be fine.

822
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:54,360
Please leave the premises.

823
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,420
You're not welcome here.

824
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:02,670
I don't want to fight you at this place.

825
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,130
Neither do I want to fight.

826
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:06,190
But do you think

827
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:08,230
you should be here now?

828
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:10,960
30 years ago,

829
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:13,750
because you ran away from home,

830
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:16,390
dad went sick and lay in bed.

831
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,230
Now again, because of you,

832
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,590
Dad is sick in bed for one more time.

833
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:21,590
Aunt,

834
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:23,510
this matter

835
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,110
has nothing to do with my mom.

836
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,710
Why doesn't it?

837
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:30,040
Just now, the mess in the birthday banquet

838
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:32,150
was what make my dad come here.

839
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:34,760
Then your mom just suddenly showed up.

840
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,620
Did she come to Xiahai on purpose?

841
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:38,590
Have you and your mom

842
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:39,990
plotted all this?

843
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:41,110
Grandpa fainted today.

844
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,110
Don't you think you need to take some blame

845
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:42,910
for it?

846
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:44,710
Could you just stop quarreling?

847
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:46,150
What matters most now

848
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:47,910
is Professor Gao's condition.

849
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,990
We'll talk about other things later.

850
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:52,070
Gao Ling,

851
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,510
in this case,

852
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:54,470
we'll leave you to it.

853
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:55,390
Lin Dayong,

854
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:57,850
I didn't ask you to come and be the patriarch.

855
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:58,630
The affairs of the Gao Family

856
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,090
are not up to you to decide.

857
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,140
Mommy.

858
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:13,190
Gao Ling,

859
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:15,130
blame me as much as you want

860
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,230
or lash out at me,

861
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,950
but please not to vent your anger

862
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:22,070
out at Dayong.

863
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,350
Wenli!

864
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:29,550
Who is the patient's family?

865
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,310
-I am.
-I am.

866
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:37,390
It's me.

867
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:38,630
I'm his daughter.

868
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,790
The patient has come to.

869
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:41,870
He's fine.

870
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:44,220
He fainted from unstable blood pressure.

871
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,710
It has once gone up to 220.

872
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:47,190
It's very dangerous.

873
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,380
Does he need to stay in hospital?

874
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,910
He'd better stay a few days for observation.

875
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:53,970
It helps to stabilize his condition.

876
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:55,950
Can we go meet him?

877
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:56,790
Sure.

878
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:58,470
But the patient needs quietness and rest.

879
00:39:58,470 --> 00:39:59,630
You must keep your voices down.

880
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,110
Just let a few of you go in there.

881
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:02,830
Don't make him get emotional.

882
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:04,030
Thank you.

883
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:12,350
Dad.

884
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:13,830
Grandpa.

885
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:14,670
Dad.

886
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,150
Dad.

887
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,790
Dad, I'm sorry.

888
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:23,270
I was being so immature today.

889
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:24,670
How could Lin Xi and I...

890
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:28,430
Are you okay?

891
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:29,910
Are you feeling better?

892
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:42,110
Mom,

893
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:45,350
if you want to visit grandpa,

894
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:46,710
we'll get in there.

895
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:55,390
Dad.

896
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:57,650
What are you trying to say?

897
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,950
Where is Xixi?

898
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:08,510
Xixi...

899
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:10,390
Xixi is outside.

900
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:17,710
Grandpa.

901
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,880
Aunt is also here.

902
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:22,670
She's staying outside

903
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:24,930
because she doesn't want to disturb you.

904
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:46,710
Xixi,

905
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:48,390
we should go.

906
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:50,070
Mom!

907
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:51,150
Mom!

908
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:51,990
Aunt!

909
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,940
Grandpa wants to see you.

910
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:33,530
Dad!
