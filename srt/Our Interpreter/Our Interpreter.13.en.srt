came up with that slogan?

27
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,870
Back then, I was working in

28
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,070

30

32
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,490
So they sent me to negotiate with him.

34

He rejected it.

35
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,510
The reason was

36
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,470
that the technology is still immature.

37
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,870

38
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,150

39
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,190
that completion is more valuable than perfection.

40
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,450
But guess what he said.

41
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,310
Either he doesn't do it,

42
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,190

00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,550
Where is Mr. Xiao?

193
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,350
We want to see Mr. Xiao.

[Yuyi Technology, Have You No Shame?]

195
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,350
Xiao, Have You No Shame?

196
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,470
Did you see this title?

197
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,190
They actually said our machine is fake

198
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,350
and we just shared the screen

199
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,140
of simultaneous translation content.

200
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,070
This is ridiculous.

201
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:47,840
Do they think everyone at the press conference

202
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,950
are fools?

203
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,430
Yuyi going public

204
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:54,790
has reduced everyone else's share of the pie.

205
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:57,910
It's not surprising that someone wants to get in our way.

206
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:00,270
Although the trending topic has been removed temporarily,

207
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,750
the matter has gone viral.

208
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,750
If we don't give an explanation,

209
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm afraid that not only the netizens

210
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,600
but the investors will also be doubtful of us.

211
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,230
Tong Xin.

212
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:14,870
Make a statement.

213
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:17,310
Anyone with a brain

214
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:19,310
wouldn't believe such illogical slander.

215
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:20,000
Okay.

216
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,390
I'll write a copy

217
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:22,730
and let you have a look.

218
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:25,470
By the way,

219
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,930
there's one more thing

220
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,150
I need you to handle personally.

221
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:35,630
In this world,

00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,360
not only is there no free lunch,

223
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,430
but there is also no free coffee.

224
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:41,510
I was wondering

225
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,950
why my former classmate suddenly called me.

226
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,310
So you want to use me.

227
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,550
You are a famous figure

228
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,830
in the technology industry.

229
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,430
If you are willing to help,

230
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,470
I believe

231
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,710
Yuyi Technology

232
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:53,870
will definitely

233
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,130
overcome this crisis.

234
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,910
Why didn't you look for

235
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,670
Shen Ping of Bean Player?

236
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:01,990
Tong Xin

237
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:03,390
has been in charge of the coordination.

238
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:05,190
I don't know the details either.

239
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,100
You did look for him.

240
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,110
But Shen Ping

241
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:11,230
is not acquainted with you like I am.

242
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,630
So

243
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,800
he didn't accept it, right?

244
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:19,630
Chen Xiao.

245
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,790
We're former classmates indeed.

246
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:22,510
But this time,

247
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,710
by asking you to speak on behalf of Yuyi,

248
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,480
I'm not asking you to lie for us.

249
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,070
This time, Yuyi

250
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,350
is indeed framed.

251
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,030
Xiao Yicheng.

252
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,950
Since you asked,

253
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,230
I will

254
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,790
help you.

255
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,110
The recent fake news

256
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,350
about Yuyi Tianxia

257
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,030
circulating the Internet

258
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,710
are but groundless statements.

259
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,590
At the press conference, we presented

260
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,310
a translation battle between a human and a machine

261
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:53,830
with the attendees as our witnesses.

262
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:55,670
Yuyi stands by

263
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:58,350
the notion to let the world hear China.

264
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,310
We wouldn't do anything that goes against our original intention.

265
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:03,190
The Internet is also bound by law.

266
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,790
Please be careful with your words and actions.

267
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:07,360
Please know that

268
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,390
Yuyi reserves the right

269
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,230
to take legal action.

270
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:13,670
Tian.

271
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,740
Will such a statement by Yuyi work?

272
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,550
If it was a coincidence,

273
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,430
it might work.

274
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,870
But if someone

275
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,710
did it on purpose...

276
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:25,630
Will it affect

277
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,030
the IPO of Yuyi?

278
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:27,990
By then, it won't just be

279
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,270
the problem of the IPO.

280
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,110
It's very likely

281
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:32,270
that Xiao Yicheng can't turn the tables.

282
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:34,110
That serious?

283
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,270

284
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,950

285
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,190
Are you saying Mr. Xiao fabricated it?

286
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,190
He wouldn't have.

287
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:43,910
But he's no match

288
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,490
for someone who wants to obliterate him.

289
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,010
Let's get back to work, everyone.

305
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,470
at the hospital.

306
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,870
I'm really sorry

00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,280
I'm at the hospital.

311
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,620
I also want to experience how it feels

312
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,870
to discuss matters

313
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:03,700
in a cafe.

317
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,270
Yes, it's like this.

318
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,550
When I was translating,

319
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,680
I had two questions.

320
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,390
It's about this Dr. Will.

321
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,110
I've checked the British Cardiac Community.

322
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,790
There are four Dr. Wills.

323
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,390
But the names on it

324
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:23,150
are not specifically labeled.

325

The medical thesis

326

Shasha.

330
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:33,620
And...

331
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,000
Shasha.

332
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,840
I forgot to tell you.

333
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,270
Huasheng doesn't have

334
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,400
a strict dress code.

336
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,550

00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:00,260
Thank you.

338
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,070
But I think I can handle it.

339

Besides,

340
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,210
high heels suit me better.

341
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:11,310
I remember

342
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,110
you used to like

343
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,040
wearing those white canvas shoes.

344
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,190
Maybe an environment

345
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,670
gives people a delusion.

346
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:19,870
In that environment,

347
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:20,630
I thought

348
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:22,160
I liked white canvas shoes.

349
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,670
But when I came back here,

350
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:24,550
I think

351
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,830
high heels are better.

352
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:27,780
Although Huasheng doesn't have

353
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,150
a strict dress code,

354
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:31,470
it is better to hold myself

355
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,750
to the dress code standards

356
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,750
of my international counterparts.

358
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:40,750
No.

359
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,440
This kind of statement

360
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,550
is for dummies.

361
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,830
It's not substantial at all.

362
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,190
It's not fabricated just because you said so?

363
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,310
Who do you think you are?

364
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:05,870
I strongly recommend the intervention of the judicial department.

366
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,550
is actually just a fraud.

00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:41,270
The netizens' discourse

383
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,530
has also shifted from being one-sided

384
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:43,870
to being divided by 3:7.

385
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,150
Chen Xiao of New Tech Forces

386
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:47,230
and Shen Ping of Bean Player

387
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,550
have posted their articles in support of us.

388
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,990
Both of them are the leading figures

389
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:50,910
of technology media.

390
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,870
Bean Player's article is brilliant.

391
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,770
It's profound and quotes the classics but still easy to understand.

392
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:55,510
With just a few words,

393
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,750
it refuted all the comments

394
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,790
in the anonymous post.

395
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,510
There are over 100,000 likes now.

396
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:00,440
I've read it too.

397
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:02,030
The article is very sharp.

398
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:02,830
Many netizens

399
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,030
changed their views

400
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,430
because of this article.

401
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:09,190
Shen Ping of Bean Player?

402
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,590
Didn't the strategic marketing department fail to get their help?

403
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,190
Yes.

404
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,370
So I think it must be

405
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:15,630
because we are awesome.

406
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:18,110
All the top players are voluntarily helping us.

407
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,510
Bean Player is the top

408
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:21,030
technology public account in China.

409
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,910
Editor-in-Chief Shen Ping has set the rules.

410
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:23,970
For every article,

411
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:24,950
firstly, no paid bots,

412
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:25,870
secondly, no click farming,

413
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:26,910
and thirdly, no accepting advertorials.

414
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,270
That's why many investors

415
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,430
use Bean Player's articles

416
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,390
as a reference for business research.

417
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:32,110
Go back to work.

418
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:32,670
Okay.

419
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,810
Are you waiting for Lin Xi's text?

420
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,790
Xiao, do you know

421
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,550
what you look like now?

422
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,590
What?

423
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,300
A wronged child

424
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,700
waiting to be comforted.

425
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:05,510
You...

426
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:08,390
Xiao, I have to tell you.

427
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,470
Although Huasheng is clear

428
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:12,230
of the truth of the press conference,

429
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,390
they are

430
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:14,920
our work partner right now.

431
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,590
So it's also the most inappropriate

432
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:18,850
for them to make a statement to defend us.

433
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:23,430
Got it.

434
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:26,870
Bye.

435
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,190
Some comments said

436
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:40,910
they bought Yuyi's translation device

437
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:42,390
and that it's very accurate.

438
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:43,270
Why would they

439
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,990
shoot themselves in the foot?

440
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,110
There's another one.

441
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,030
I was Xiao Yicheng's

442
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:50,110
junior at Kenpardy.

443
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,260
He is an

444
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,790
extremely serious person.

445
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:53,950
How could he have

446
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:56,190
passed human translation off as machine translation?

447
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,830
This slander is ridiculous.

448
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:58,550
All right.

449
00:23:58,870 --> 00:23:59,430
The public

450
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:01,090
are leaning towards Yuyi now.

451
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,110
What's wrong?

452
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,110
You look pale.

453
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:07,910
Don't get sick again.

454
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:09,570
Why don't you go back and rest?

455
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,070
I'm fine.

456
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,280
We still have a lot of information to check.

457
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,920
Chen Wen.

458
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:17,870
Are there any new vocabulary lists

459
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:20,070
from the Agricultural Product Trade Exhibition?

460
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:22,030
No, I didn't receive anything.

461
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,840
Don't do everything yourself.

462
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:27,750
Let the young people experience it and toughen up.

463
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:31,990
I'm going to press the elevator for you.

464
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:32,720
I'm leaving.

465
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:38,640
He's the most eager when it's time to get off work.

466
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:21,210
You're back. What a coincidence.

467
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:22,520
What a coincidence.

468
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,910
Well, Third Princess is hungry.

469
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,110
Give it some food.

470
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,390
It's hungry already?

471
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:30,510
Doesn't it usually eat at ten o'clock?

472
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:31,790
It's good to eat and digest the food early.

473
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,390
I have something to do later.

474
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,310
All right. If you won't eat,

475
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,910
just hang out here yourself.

476
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,030
Good girl.

477
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,310
It's not hungry now.

478
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,510
When it's hungry,

479
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,550
just give it

480
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,030
those food.

481
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,090
It's all prepared.

482
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,460
I'll go back first.

483
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,150
Wait.

484
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:16,190
About Yuyi's crisis,

485
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,510
you must have heard about it.

486
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,070
Don't you have

487
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,270
anything to say to me?

488
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:28,830
Our project team's work

489
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,270
will proceed as usual.

490
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:31,420
It won't affect you.

491
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:33,350
And?

492
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,400
This is my arrangement.

493
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,910
Chen Wen and Wang Qiang

494
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:42,270
are responsible for collecting and checking data.

495
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:43,030
As for Wei...

496
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,430
What about other things?

497
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:51,990
Are you hoping for

498
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,030
Huasheng to cooperate with Yuyi

499
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,370
by making a statement?

500
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:57,110
Putting business aside,

501
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:58,670
do you really

502
00:26:58,670 --> 00:26:59,190
have nothing

503
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,320
you want to say to me?

504
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,350
Now the public opinion

505
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:08,910
is leaning towards Yuyi.

506
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:10,270
I think

507
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,950
you've overcome

508
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,290
this crisis smoothly.

509
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,060
Fine.

510
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,550
I see.

511
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,550
In your heart,

512
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:32,670
I'm just a client.

513
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:38,120
You don't have to be worried

514
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:40,870
or sad for me.

515
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:42,870
I'm sorry.

516
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,680
I was reading too much into things.

517
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:47,830
No...

518
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:48,790
Say no more.

519
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,310
I understand.

520
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,870
Wait, Xiao Yicheng.

521
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,310
Actually, I...

522
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,550
Actually, I also...

523
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,380
Are you kidding me?

524
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:11,030
Wait.

525
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:12,390
I haven't seen you like this

526
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,030
in a long time.

527
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,470
I remember the last time

528
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:15,470
was nine years ago,

529
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,030
when I misunderstood

530
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:16,950
that you and that finance junior...

531
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,270
Are you done?

532
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:21,920
Okay, okay.

533
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:23,030
I'll stop.

534
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:24,640
By the way,

535
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,870
Yuyi is able to turn the tables this time

536
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:27,870
all thanks to

537
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,350
the editor-in-chief of Bean Player.

538
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:30,880
Have you read that article?

539
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,190
Yes.

540
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,610
What do you think of it?

541
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,350
It's decent.

542
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:39,960
This editor-in-chief is quite interesting.

543
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,480
Not only was the writing sharp,

544
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:44,070
but it was also coherent.

545
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,630
Most importantly,

546
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,590
I think she seems to have

547
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,320
known me for a long time.

548
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:52,990
Every word

549
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:54,270
was heartfelt.

550
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,190
It's like the words

551
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,990
from an old friend of many years.

552
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:00,910
I think

553
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,630
she must

554
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,200
have a crush on me.

555
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:11,430
Tell me.

556
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:13,150
Why does she know me so well?

557
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:15,870
How would I know?

558
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,150
Hello, Wei.

559
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,270
I'm at your door.

560
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:32,450
Yuyi's in trouble.

561
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:36,750
What's wrong?

562
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:37,790
Hello?

563
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:38,400
Wei.

564
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,470
You moved?

565
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:47,470
Why are you here?

566
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,590
This is my home.

567
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,710
Then you...

568
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:53,830
Come in first.

569
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,720
I'm Lisa,

570
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,870
an overseas Chinese and an English major postgraduate.

571
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:04,670
Previously, for Yuyi's

572
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:05,630
offline events,

573
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:06,390
I was asked

574
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:08,470
to translate the content of the speech.

575
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,990
They will pass the translation off as machine translation

576
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,590
by sharing it through the screen.

577
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:12,670
In exchange,

578
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,300
I will get three times the salary

579
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,500
and sign a confidentiality agreement.

580
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:18,110
I found it to be a shameful act

581
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,070
and refused immediately.

582
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,430
Maybe in the face of capital,

583
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:21,680
my words don't carry much weight.

584
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,590
But even so,

585
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:23,950
I still want to speak out.

586
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,350
Capitals ganged up to do evil

587
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,190
and hurt the feelings

588
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:27,470
of netizens and fans.

589
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,880
How can a company like this be listed?

590
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:32,050
Do feelings no longer matter?

591
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,900
What are you thinking?

592
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,150
Do you recall

593
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:48,750
this Lisa?

594
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,470
Lisa?

595
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:57,110
The one you...

596
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,390
You know her?

597
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:05,030
She was an intern in the priority client management department last year

598
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,230
and Lin Xi fired her.

599
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:11,270
So this is the reason.

600
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,150
What do you mean?

601
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:18,290
Killing two birds with one stone.

602
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:20,270
What stone?

603
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,890
Both of you are singing the same tune.

604
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:24,430
First create a public opinion crisis

605
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,070
and then get

606
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:27,070
a supposed whistleblower to verify

607
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,960
that Yuyi is colluding with Huasheng.

608
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:35,430
How about

609
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:38,030
I go get Mr. Zhang to make a statement

610
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,160
to debunk the rumor?

611
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,950
With this disclosure,

612
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:42,750
do you think people

613
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,410
will still believe Huasheng?

614
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:47,430
This Lisa...

615
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:50,740
Should I go find her?

616
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:52,470
Lisa

617
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:53,990
is just

618
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:55,470
an ordinary translator.

619
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:57,870
There's a mastermind behind the scenes.

620
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:58,630
Definitely.

621
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:04,710
Wei.

622
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:06,610
What are the netizens saying?

623
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,070
The negative comments that were suppressed

624
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:14,510
have all resurfaced.

625
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,430
Hello, Tong Xin.

626
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,110
I already know about it.

627
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:36,670
I'm with Wei Tian and Lin Xi.

628
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,270
We're discussing it.

629
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:41,070
I know.

630
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,320
You're...

631
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:54,710
living together?

632
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:56,670
You're

633
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:59,830
even raising a dog?

634
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:04,510
It's Ling Feng's.

635
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,920
It's here temporarily while he's away.

636
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:16,430
I have something to report to Mr. Zhang.

637
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,350
I’ll get going.

638
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,910
Your phone and bag.

639
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:44,350
By the way,

640
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,550
Ling Feng will be back tomorrow.

641
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:47,670
When he's back,

642
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:49,930
I'll ask him to take Third Princess away.

643
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:51,350
If you have time,

644
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:52,990
pack its things.

645
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:56,670
I'll go back now.

646
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,100
Grandma, I’m back.

647
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,670
Xixi.

648
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,030
Let's eat.

649
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,550
Grandma, I have no appetite.

650
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,469
I won't eat.

651
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:43,480
Fine.

652
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,750
I'll eat, okay?

653
00:34:44,989 --> 00:34:47,949
You young people must remember

654
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:49,550
that no matter what happens,

655
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:51,710
you must eat well.

656
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,000
Where is Cheng Yao?

657
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,750
Something is wrong.

658
00:34:58,990 --> 00:34:59,870
What's wrong?

659
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:01,100
He usually

660
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:03,110
follows you around

661
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,110
like a lost puppy.

662
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,500
Nowadays, whenever he comes home,

663
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,550
he hides in his room

664
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:08,190
without eating or drinking.

665
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:11,760
When something's unusual, there must be a reason for it.

666
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:12,910
Xixi.

667
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:15,870
Go and find out for me.

668
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,750
Okay, don't worry.

669
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:29,350
Time to eat.

670
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:30,830
You guys eat first.

671
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:31,690
I'm not hungry.

672
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:34,470
I brought it for you.

673
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,950
Just put it at the door.

674
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,110
Are you dressed?

675
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:44,030
What are you doing?

676
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:45,730
I'm playing games.

677
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,450
What game?

678
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:48,280
A new game.

679
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:49,830
Grandma Li said

680
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:51,270
you haven't been eating or drinking recently.

681
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:53,730
You hide in your room as soon as you come back.

682
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:56,430
This is a new game.

683
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:57,710
I want to clear it.

684
00:35:58,590 --> 00:35:59,910
Why don't I see you this dedicated

685
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,110
when working?

686
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:04,140
Director Lin, we're off work.

687
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,940
Can you stop talking about work?

688
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:08,150
Fine, I won't bother you.

689
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,000
Eat it.

690
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:09,990
Thank you.

691
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:31,390
[Translator A wandering with the wind]

692
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:39,510
Morning.

693
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:41,900
Morning, Grandpa.

694
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:53,190
Why? You don't have an appetite?

695
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,190
What's the matter?

696
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:00,270
Tell me.

697
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:06,910
Lin Xi...

698
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,790
Huasheng's in trouble.

699
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:14,670
Grandpa, do you have a way

700
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,030
to help her?

701
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:21,050
It's an internal matter of Huasheng.

702
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:22,550
Besides,

703
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:24,950
it's good for young people

704
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:26,200
to suffer setbacks.

705
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:27,550
But...

706
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:30,190
But Lin Xi is in charge of

707
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:32,190
the project cooperation with Yuyi.

708
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:34,600
I'm afraid Lin Xi will be dismissed

709
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,400
if this isn't handled well.

710
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:39,630
Professor Gao.

711
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:42,190
Xi is too stubborn.

712
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:44,270
She won't ask you for help herself.

713
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:45,670
Please just help her.

714
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,440
I'm going to my Tai Chi class.

715
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,310
Grandpa.

716
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:04,510
Both of them are so stubborn.

717
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:16,390
So you mean...

718
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,330
to beat them at their own game?

719
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:24,270
Since they think

720
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,310
Yuyi's 1.0 press conference

721
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,670
was fabricated by Huasheng and Yuyi,

722
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:30,070
as long as we hold another

723
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,070
press conference

724
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:33,670
and invite the big shots in the industry to make their appearances,

725
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:36,230
the rumor will be dispelled.

726
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,620
These big shots

727
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,550
might not want to get involved in this.

728
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:43,350
How would we know if we don't try?

729
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:46,310
With you helping me,

730
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:47,640
I'm already very happy.

731
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:51,310
I'm doing this for everyone.

732
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:52,990
Thank you.

733
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:32,510
Mr. Yi.

734
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:34,110
Mr. Yi.

735
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:35,830
Mr. Yi, hello.

736
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:38,430
Who are you?

737
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,550
I'm Lin Xi from Huasheng Translation.

738
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:41,870
I'm Xiao Yicheng from Yuyi.

739
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:42,750
Nice to meet you.

740
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,110
Yuyi...

741
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:46,820
The one that made the translation device?

742
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:47,430
Yes.

743
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:48,790
Not bad.

744
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:52,070
You are Lin Xi?

745
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:55,540
In the translation competition seven years ago,

746
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,740
you were the chairman of the committee.

747
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:00,870
Lady, it's you.

748
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,270
You were

749
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:03,630
the champion.

750
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:05,360
You still remember?

751
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,400
Come on, please have a seat.

752
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:08,190
Thank you.

753
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,950
You came all the way here

754
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:18,760
to see me. What's up?

755
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:21,710
Mr. Yi, here is the thing.

756
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,990
Yuyi is facing

757
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:25,590
a public opinion crisis.

758
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:28,190
So Mr. Xiao wants to hold another press conference

759
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,790
for the translation device.

760
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:31,190
We hope you'd attend it.

761
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:33,320
Mr. Yi, take a look.

762
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:40,510
This

763
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,290
is inappropriate.

764
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:45,430
I've retired for many years.

765
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,150
-Here.
-Mr. Yi.

766
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:50,390
You’ve been a judge for over 20 years

767
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:51,550
and your students

768
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,990
are all industry leaders.

769
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:55,190
Your appearance is what truly matters.

770
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:01,030
There's no legitimate reason for me to do so.

771
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:04,910
I'm sorry but I can’t help you.

772
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:05,790
Mr. Yi.

773
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:08,710
This press conference is very meaningful.

774
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:09,790
Recently,

775
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:11,390
the rumors about our company

776
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,190
have even implicated traditional translators.

777
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:16,270
Only you can help

778
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,150
resolve this crisis.

779
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:23,870
I have to pick up my grandson later.

780
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:26,310
He'll be off school soon.

781
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:29,950
I won't have any guests today.

782
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,550
Mr. Yi.

783
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,650
Mr. Yi, please reconsider...

784
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:43,510
It's almost noon.

785
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:44,440
We have to hurry.

786
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:46,990
There are still so many people we haven't visited.

787
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:48,030
A few minutes won't make a difference.

788
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:48,960
Have some water.

789
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:50,030
No need.

790
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:51,750
They're all big shots in the industry.

791
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:53,680
It's impolite to go there too late.

792
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:10,830
[Ding Ling] [Zhang Huaicai]

793
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:19,110
Sir, your meal is ready.

794
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:20,870
Thank you.

795
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:21,800
You're welcome.

796
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:25,590
Here.

797
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:27,430
Thank you.

798
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:35,940
Mr. Xu Jiangnan?

799
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:37,710
Yes.

800
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:38,960
He used to be

801
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,510
a professor at Xiahai University.

802
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:41,390
He can do it.

803
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:45,310
No.

804
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:47,510
He's now

805
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:49,370
a guest translator for Huasheng.

806
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:52,090
The public won't believe him.

807
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:00,870
Why do you not look

808
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:01,830
nervous at all?

809
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:04,910
It's not the dead end yet.

810
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:08,950
Xiao Yicheng.

811
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:11,550
You spent eight years

812
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:13,430
to develop this translation device.

813
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:14,430
Now people are proclaiming it

814
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:15,390
to be worthless.

815
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:16,660
It might also

816
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:17,790
affect the company going public.

817
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:18,710
You may even be

818
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:20,110
held accountable legally.

819
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:21,550
Isn't this a dead end?

820
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:26,350
To come up with solutions,

821
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:27,920
we need to fill our stomachs first.

822
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:28,430
Here.

823
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:40,950
I think we should first find

824
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:41,790
that Lisa

825
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:43,590
and find out the mastermind behind her.

826
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:45,910
Do you still not know who's behind this?

827
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:47,830
Someone who hates Yuyi

828
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:49,470
and Huasheng.

829
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:50,640
There's no one else.

830
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:51,930
Someone from Yongyun?

831
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:55,470
Despicable!

832
00:43:57,270 --> 00:43:58,110
All right.

833
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:04,230
Xiao.

834
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:05,510
This is Director Lyu Feng

835
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:06,910
from Gongying PR agency.

836
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:07,910
Hello.

837
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:09,710
Mr. Xiao, we’ve studied it.

838
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:11,230
We have a few solutions

839
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:12,310
to discuss.

840
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:13,700
For now,

841
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:16,230
the best way is to sever the crisis at its root.

842
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:19,950
This Lisa

843
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:21,670
was an intern under Lin Xi two years ago.

844
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:23,270
She messed up two projects in a row

845
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:24,530
and was fired by Lin Xi.

846
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:26,830
What do you mean?

847
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:28,870
We can steer the public opinion

848
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:30,110
towards this aspect.

849
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:30,990
Hang on.
