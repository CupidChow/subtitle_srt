What's wrong?

196
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:11,980
Mr. Xiao,

you're a man of the world.

198

Why are you nervous now?

199
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,830
I'm not nervous.

200
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,890
I just don't go to battle unprepared.

201

It's a small village.

202
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,430
You don't need to make any preparations.

203
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,630
That's different.

204
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,070
I'm going to meet your parents.

205
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,640
I have to be thoughtful.

206
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,240
My dad

207
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,310
is just a farmer.

208
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,600
He works in the field every day.

209
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,390
What you wear

210
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,650
doesn't matter to him.

211
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,560
But your mom is well-educated.

212
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,190
That's already in the past.

213
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:41,150

she's just an English teacher in the village.

215
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,510
After you meet my parents,

216
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,110
just don't look down on them.

217
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,510
Why would I possibly do that?

218
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,240
No matter what your parents do,

219
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:55,950
I'll deeply respect them.

the backward lifestyle of the countryside.

226
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,830
That's the least I can do.

You didn't have to do this.

Do what?

232

I mean,

Yes.

247
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:22,890
You think they're improper?

248
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,590
I don't know if they're too proper

249
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,430
or too improper.

250

00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,630
when I was in high school.

386
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,720
Thanks to the favorable policies.

387
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,310
Do you think I'll buy that?

388
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,590
You're fooling me again.

389
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:03,150
I'm telling you the truth.

390
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,270
And my parents' lives

391
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,589
haven't changed much.

392
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:07,920
My mom still teaches at the village school.

393
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,720
My dad is still a loving husband.

394
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:11,990
I think

395
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,550
your father is not only a loving husband

396
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,640
but also a doting father.

397
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,700
You made me so embarrassed this time.

398
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,390
I have a bad feeling

399
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:20,319
that I'll have a hard time here.

400
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,230
You won't.

401
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:28,190
What does she see in him?

402
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,310
What on earth

403
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,920
does Xixi see

404
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,920
in that young man?

405
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,510
That guy impressed me

406
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,240
as a good man.

407
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,110
He has good manners.

408
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,190
Manners?

409
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,840
What's the use of having good manners?

410
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,830
Can one feed on manners?

411
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:52,240
He has to be a man

412
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,630
who's down-to-earth

413
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:55,750
and can make something of himself.

414
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,510
I heard he has a good job.

415
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,980
I think he's well-paid.

416
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,440
I don't care about that.

417
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,750
Do we need money?

418
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,590
What we need

419
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,650
is a son-in-law as outstanding as me.

420
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,270
Wenli.

421
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,470
You know,

422
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,470
I always do things your way.

423
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,660
This time,

424
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,350
can we do it my way?

425
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:21,710
If that young man

426
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:22,470
wants to marry

427
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,500
our daughter,

428
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,950
he has to

429
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,810
go through me, Lin Dayong, first.

430
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,650
Fine. Let's do it your way.

431
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:32,840
Here. Have some tea.

432
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:41,110
Here.

433
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:41,870
-Thank you.
-Try this.

434
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,000
Have some yourself.

435
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,910
Can you drink?

436
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:48,510
I...

437
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,370
He can't drink.

438
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,430
Try this too.

439
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:55,550
Xiao.

440
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,390
How do you like the food here?

441
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,590
It's great, Mrs. Lin.

442
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,230
Then eat up.

443
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:02,830
You don't like these dishes?

444
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:03,470
I do.

445
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,310
I just don't eat a lot.

446
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,100
You can't drink, and you eat like a bird.

447
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,100
I don't think

448
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:09,790
you're much better

449
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:10,870
in other aspects.

450
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,150
Mr. Lin.

451
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:17,230
Mr. Lin.

452
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,360
Mrs. Gao. They're here.

453
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:20,780
They're all here.

454
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,390
Who's here?

455
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,630
Follow me.

456
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,310
Come on. Come on.

457
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,990
Mrs. Gao. Dayong.

458
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:35,710
Hurry.

459
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:37,670
We're here.

460
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:38,710
Uncle.

461
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:39,390
Hello, everyone.

462
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:41,550
Wenqiang. Lin.

463
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:42,510
You all came.

464
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,110
Yes.

465
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,030
Great.

466
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:44,790
Lin.

467
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:45,620
What's in that pot?

468
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,390
Braised pork.

469
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:47,340
It's freshly cooked.

470
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,230
Dayong.

471
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,270
I heard from Wang

472
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,630
that your future son-in-law is here.

473
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,150
So we all came.

474
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,590
He's not my future son-in-law.

475
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,470
Just a friend

476
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,590
of Xi.

477
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,460
He has to be her friend

478
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,990
before he becomes her husband.

479
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,750
We have to uphold the tradition.

480
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,270
Yes.

481
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:00,990
We can't break from tradition.

482
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:01,920
What tradition?

483
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,190
It's the local custom

484
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:03,790
in Peach Blossom Village

485
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,550
to offer a guest

486
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,990
all the delicious food we have.

487
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:08,070
Yes, young man.

488
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,820
It's the local custom for a man

489
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,390
to eat as much as he can

490
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:12,510
to show his affection

491
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:14,440
for a woman during his first visit.

492
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,270
Really?

493
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:15,950
Yes.

494
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:16,750
Okay.

495
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,830
Serve the dishes.

496
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,830
Serve the dishes. Let's go.

497
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,550
Scholar Cake.

498
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:38,690
What are you doing?

499
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,470
The next dish is a roast chicken.

500
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,150
Enough. Stop eating.

501
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:32,110
Lin.

502
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,150
Next dish.

503
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:33,790
Enough.

504
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:39,960
Take the rest of the dishes home

505
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,490
and enjoy them yourselves.

506
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,510
Mr. Lin, I can keep eating.

507
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,630
I don't think you can.

508
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,870
Are you trying to prove

509
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:47,550
your love for Xixi by eating?

510
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:49,790
What can that prove?

511
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,190
What do you mean?

512
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:53,990
My dad means

513
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:55,110
you can stop eating.

514
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:55,770
Look at you.

515
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,150
You haven't even married him

516
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,880
but are already defending him.

517
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,670
Folks,

518
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:01,830
back then,

519
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,850
when I pursued Xixi's mom,

520
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,190
I tried my best

521
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,310
to prove my love for her.

522
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:08,110
Why don't you tell him how I did it?

523
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:08,670
Okay.

524
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:10,910
Dayong is very handy.

525
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:11,950
Yes.

526
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:13,190
When Dayong and Wenli

527
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,030
got married,

528
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:14,630
he made their cabinet

529
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:15,990
all by himself.

530
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:17,510
Things are different now.

531
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,230
Back then,

532
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,460
you were too poor to buy furniture.

533
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,790
Was that about money?

534
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,670
That was the way

535
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,310
I showed my true affection to your mom.

536
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,110
Understand?

537
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,190
Mr. Lin.

538
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,440
My love for Xixi

539
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,390
is true as well.

540
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:29,600
I don't believe you.

541
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,150
You have to prove it

542
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,910
to change my opinion of you.

543
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:35,110
Okay.

544
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,630
Then tell me

545
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:37,950
what I should do

546
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:39,010
to earn your trust.

547
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,720
If you can make a handmade sofa,

548
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:42,630
I'll consider

549
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:43,590
marrying Xixi to you.

550
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,990
Lin, you must be joking.

551
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:46,070
How can he make a sofa?

552
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:46,790
Where are the materials?

553
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,110
There's a large bamboo forest behind the house.

554
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,110
He can cut bamboo to make it.

555
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:49,950
Is that hard?

556
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,240
Okay.

557
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:53,710
Deal.

558
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,870
I can do it.

559
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,310
[Indigestion Medicine]

560
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:06,830
Xixi.

561
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,070
Your dad

562
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,350
actually cares about him.

563
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,830
Folks, let's go.

564
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:11,980
Let's have some tea.

565
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:12,580
Let's go.

566
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,350
Eat it now.

567
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:15,190
Lin.

568
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:15,920
I'm stuffed.

569
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,630
Let's go upstairs for tea.

570
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:30,310
Dayong.

571
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,430
Why did you ask Xiao Yicheng

572
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,750
to make a sofa?

573
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,210
I don't think it's a good idea.

574
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,110
Wenli.

575
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,710
Xixi also thinks it's a bad idea.

576
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:42,670
Can't you understand me either?

577
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:50,430
Fine.

578
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:53,340
I'll give you a chance to explain.

579
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:58,430
When we were first together,

580
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,390
I told you

581
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:02,550
I'd never

582
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:04,430
let you suffer in your life.

583
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:05,350
I promised to give you

584
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,510
a happy life.

585
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:07,870
Do you remember that?

586
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:08,790
Yes.

587
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:10,120
Of course I remember it.

588
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:13,080
You've fulfilled all your promises to me.

589
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,350
I'm not

590
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:16,870
well-educated.

591
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,340
My hands

592
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,990
are all I can depend on.

593
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,510
When we just got married,

594
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:24,990
we were too poor

595
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:26,670
to buy furniture.

596
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:27,770
So I make it myself.

597
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:29,670
The furniture I made

598
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:30,780
was even better than those in stores.

599
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:31,830
Then,

600
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,630
I continued farming the land

601
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:35,670
and gradually

602
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:37,230
built our family business.

603
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,950
For a man,

604
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:42,830
as long as he can work with his hands,

605
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,310
the women in his house

606
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,550
won't starve.

607
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,700
Dayong,

608
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,590
times have changed.

609
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,150
Things are different now.

610
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:52,790
Yes.

611
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:54,750
Times have changed.

612
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,780
But that's even more reason

613
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,950
for me to test

614
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:59,470
that Xiao boy.

615
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:03,390
A husband should be able to support his wife.

616
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:05,050
I don't care how much he earns.

617
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,710
As long as he's down-to-earth,

618
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:09,030
he's a good choice

619
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:10,030
for our daughter.

620
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,840
Are you feeling better now?

621
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:23,790
No.

622
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,590
My dad is so bad.

623
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,710
I think

624
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:31,910
your dad's bark is worse than his bite.

625
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:35,710
He's won you over

626
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,710
with just a box of indigestion medicine?

627
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:38,790
That's not what I mean.

628
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,650
Actually, I understand your dad.

629
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,830
After all, I'm the man his daughter wants to marry.

630
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:44,790
Don't worry.

631
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:47,270
I'll face this challenge

632
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,930
with an optimistic attitude.

633
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:52,830
What about the sofa?

634
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:53,790
Can you make it?

635
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:56,110
The sofa…

636
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,030
To be honest, I don't know.

637
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:59,710
But I think

638
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:00,470
after doing some research,

639
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,590
I can make a sofa.

640
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:03,830
I doubt that.

641
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:05,670
You know what?

642
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,630
When my dad made furniture back then,

643
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:09,190
he struggled with making a sofa.

644
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:10,310
That's great.

645
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,230
I mean,

646
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,990
if I manage to make something

647
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,190
he couldn't make,

648
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:17,320
he'll have to marry his daughter to me.

649
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:29,590
Coming.

650
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:40,550
What's the matter?

651
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,260
Cheng Yao.

652
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,100
Can you look after Peter

653
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,030
for me tonight?

654
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,270
I need to go out now.

655
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:45,590
Sure.

656
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:46,310
But it's so late.

657
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,430
Where are you going?

658
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,870
Xiao went to Peach Blossom Village.

659
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:50,930
I need him to sign an urgent document.

660
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,990
You need to take mountain roads to get there, don't you?

661
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:55,430
Yes, I'll drive myself.

662
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:58,350
How about this?

663
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:58,950
Give me a minute.

664
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:59,880
I'll go with you.

665
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:00,790
No need.

666
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:01,270
It's very late now.

667
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:03,230
It'll take three hours to get there.

668
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,960
That's a long way.

669
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,110
We can take turns to drive.

670
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,390
Peter would be worried

671
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,030
if you drove with sleepy eyes.

672
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:09,670
Yes.

673
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,880
Let's go together.

674
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,680
We can spend some time with Papa.

675
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:16,150
Don't hesitate. It's a deal.

676
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:17,710
Give me a sec. I'll get changed.

677
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:18,550
Okay.

678
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:48,910
Stop the car.

679
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,350
What's wrong?

680
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:51,830
Stop the car.

681
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:19,790
Why are you looking at me?

682
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:20,390
Let's go.

683
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:26,860
♫When I meet the right person♫

684
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:31,020
♫I'll stop and wait♫

685
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:29,430
What?

686
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:30,950
Let's listen to music together.

687
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:31,740
No. I'm good.

688
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:37,650
♫I'll be willing to give my all♫

689
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:35,990
Thank you.

690
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:41,440
♫To look into your gentle eyes♫

691
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:42,670
Well,

692
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,550
sorry.

693
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:46,790
There was a pothole.

694
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:49,190
♫There are countless possibilities in the future♫

695
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,110
It's okay.

696
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:50,990
I'll put it on for you.

697
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:54,460
♫I could either be a part of or leave your life♫

698
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:54,870
Thank you.

699
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:59,370
♫It's my pleasure to share this process♫

700
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,260
♫Our story is still considered complete♫

701
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:11,000
♫Can you not be silent?♫

702
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:16,740
♫Share with me more♫

706
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,230
You're fast.

707
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,350
Yeah.

708
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:40,790
It's the middle of the night.

709
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:42,230
Are you two standing here

710
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,510
waiting for us?

711
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:47,190
It helps digestion.

712
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:48,310
It's already one in the morning.

713
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,970
You expect me to believe that?

714
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,760
Does that sound odd to you too?

715
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,090
Where is Peter?

716
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,590
He's sleeping in the car.

717
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:58,790
I'll carry him out.

718
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:04,390
He's there?

719
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:05,390
Yes.

720
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:06,590
Lin Xi.

721
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,270
Chen Wen resigned.

722
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,390
Let's put work aside

723
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:15,430
for a few days.

724
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:16,670
Now that we're all here,

725
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:18,350
let's blow off some steam.

726
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:23,430
I can do it.

727
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:24,550
It's okay.

728
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:34,710
Is it good?

729
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:36,750
There is stuffing in it.

730
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,550
Xi.

731
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:42,670
Your friends are all here.

732
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:43,200
Dad, Mom.

733
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,950
Let me introduce them.

734
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:45,880
Nice to meet you.

735
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:47,270
This is Tong Xin.

736
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,390
This is Cheng Yao.

737
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:49,790
This little boy is Peter.

738
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,990
You're such a lovely family.

739
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,340
Have a seat.

740
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,390
Come on. Have a seat.

741
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:56,630
Mr. Lin, you misunderstood.

742
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:57,950
We're not a couple.

743
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:58,710
Cheng Yao

744
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:00,840
is the business partner of Xiao and me.

745
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,910
Sorry. Sorry.

746
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:04,210
I embarrassed you.

747
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,470
It's fine.

748
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:07,350
Xi rarely brings her friends home.

749
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:08,440
If you like it here,

750
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,170
you can stay here for a few days.

751
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,110
Thank you, Grandpa.

752
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,480
I love this place.

753
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,470
It's so beautiful.

754
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:15,550
It's like the fairyland

755
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:16,710
in fairy tales.

756
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,510
He called me Grandpa.

757
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:20,750
You're so sweet.

758
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:21,630
Then

759
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:22,590
make yourselves

760
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,790
at home.

761
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:25,580
Eat up.

762
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:28,410
Xiao Yicheng, come in to have breakfast.

763
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:31,100
Okay. That's all.

764
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,190
I see.

765
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:39,710
Hey.

766
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:40,190
Sit and eat.

767
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,110
Mr. and Mrs. Lin.

768
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,350
I answered a call.

769
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:47,070
Good.

770
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:54,360
Do you think I should wear something else?

771
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,390
You look good.

772
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:56,310
My dad's jacket

773
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,440
suits you very well.

774
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:58,550
Really?

775
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,150
I think so too.

776
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:03,390
Alright. Here.

777
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:04,790
Take this towel.

778
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:05,790
I…

779
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:06,630
Take it.

780
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:07,950
I don't think it's necessary.

781
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:10,680
Use it to wipe your sweat. Better safe than sorry.

782
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:12,630
Wear them.

783
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:14,310
I really don't need them.

784
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,670
I'm going to cut bamboo,

785
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:16,870
not clean the toilet.

786
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:17,910
Fine.

787
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,480
I'll put them in the basket.

788
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:21,840
Carry this bamboo basket on your back.

789
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:22,370
Come on.

790
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,390
There are tools in it.

791
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:25,390
You have to carry it.

792
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:26,160
Okay.

793
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:29,110
Put this on.

794
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:42,110
Throw it higher.

795
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,440
Someone's coming. I'll play later.

796
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,550
What's wrong?

797
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:06,750
Hello. Who are you?

798
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,710
He seems to be mute.

799
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:12,590
Peter.

800
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:14,550
How can you mock someone like that?

801
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:15,550
Apologize to him.

802
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,350
Sorry.

803
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:21,060
Xiao Yicheng.

804
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:22,590
Xiao Yicheng.

805
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,110
Xiao?

806
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:27,750
Xiao Yicheng?

807
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:28,910
Papa.

808
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:30,070
What is he wearing?

809
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:30,930
Let's go to him.

810
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:32,510
You forgot this.

811
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,430
-Okay.
-Be careful.

812
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:33,870
Okay.

813
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:38,150
Xiao Yicheng.

814
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,600
What are you going to do?

815
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:41,310
I'm going on patrol.

816
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,550
With a chopper?

817
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,500
Are you worried you may run into a tiger?

818
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,710
Have fun.

819
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:47,680
Grandpa Lin told us what happened

820
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,270
during breakfast.

821
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:51,200
Papa is going to make a bamboo sofa.

822
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,580
Okay. Let's go.

823
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,580
Let's go.

824
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:56,130
Do I look like a ranger?

825
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:58,360
-Be careful with the chopper.
-Peter.

826
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:05,190
Let's get this out too.

827
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:15,230
Xiao Yicheng.

828
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:16,880
You got hurt?

829
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,070
No. I'm fine.

830
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,400
Be careful.

831
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:21,280
Cheers.

832
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:21,920
Cheers.

833
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,670
Let's drink.

834
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,350
Come on. Let's drink together.

835
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:25,280
Cheers, kid.

836
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:25,750
Cheers.

837
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,320
Here, eat this.

838
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:36,590
I think it's delicious.

839
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:37,389
Cheng.

840
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:39,270
This winter melon

841
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:40,400
is a hybrid

842
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,670
of varieties from 30 different regions.

843
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:43,870
Give it a try.

844
00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:45,440
Okay. I'll try it.

845
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:51,429
It's very delicious.

846
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:51,909
Yeah.

847
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,150
Xiao.

848
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:53,870
You should try it too.

849
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:54,480
Okay.

850
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:04,360
What's wrong with your hand?

851
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,230
Nothing.

852
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,060
You got a splinter in your finger?

853
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:07,710
It's fine.

854
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,440
No. It needs to be disinfected.

855
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:10,790
It's just a splinter.

856
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:12,190
Just pull it out.

857
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,510
No. It needs to be disinfected.

858
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:14,230
Come with me. We need to deal with it.

859
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,230
It's really okay.

860
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,230
Back then,

861
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:19,280
when I made furniture for your mom,

862
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,210
I used this hand.

863
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:21,140
I lost count

864
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,550
of how many times I got hit by the hammer.

865
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:24,500
Did I even wince?

866
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:25,270
Let's eat.

867
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:25,910
No, Mr. Lin.

868
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:27,020
This is different.

869
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:29,030
It's his trick

870
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:30,230
to get her attention.

871
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,470
What are you talking about?

872
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:33,630
Mr. Lin, you don't know him.

873
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:34,790
Let me tell you something.

874
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:35,630
When he

875
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,190
moved next door to Lin Xi,

876
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,190
he said he didn't know how to clean up his house

877
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,470
and asked Lin Xi for help.

878
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,000
Wasn't that a trick as well?

879
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:43,070
No. I...

880
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:43,870
Enough.

881
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:44,870
His finger needs tending to.

882
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:46,600
You don't care for him, but I do.

883
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:50,310
Why didn't I know those tricks?

884
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:51,910
Wenli,

885
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:53,590
my hand hurts too.

886
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:55,190
-Knock it off.
-Mr. Lin, you're a fast learner.

887
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:55,790
Yeah.

888
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:57,430
My knees hurt too.

889
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:58,150
Really?

890
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,080
What should I do?

891
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:08,250
Are you going to finish making it?

892
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,660
What?

893
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,310
Even if

894
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:12,230
you don't make the sofa,

895
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:13,490
I'll still be with you.

896
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:15,910
I hurt you?

897
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:16,470
No.

898
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:19,000
I should record what you just said.

899
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:20,740
Shut up.

900
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,270
It really hurts.

901
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,790
Let me blow it for you.

902
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:35,320
It doesn't hurt now, right?

903
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:37,420
Done.

904
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,420
Actually, this is my fault.

905
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,190
I should have

906
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:45,030
told my parents about you in advance.

907
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,270
It's not your fault.

908
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:48,080
I insisted on coming along.

909
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,280
I know

910
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,590
you came with me

911
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:54,520
because you were worried about me.

912
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:56,270
Actually,

913
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:57,230
I just wanted

914
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:58,750
to come home for some rest

915
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,280
and recharge my batteries.

916
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:07,270
Let me see if you're fully charged.

917
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,030
Yes.

918
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:13,760
After coming back,

919
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,510
I saw the grins on the villagers,

920
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:18,470
hugged my dad, talked with my mom,

921
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,880
and spent time with you.

922
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:22,190
I feel like

923
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:23,910
I'm back on my feet again.

924
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:26,950
I finally know

925
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:28,810
why you're always full of energy.

926
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:30,030
Why?

927
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,150
Think about it.

928
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:32,390
You grew up

929
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:33,850
in such a beautiful place.

930
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:35,310
That's why

931
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:36,950
you're resilient and vibrant.

932
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,210
Just like a cockroach.

933
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,550
A cockroach?

934
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:41,310
Take it back.

935
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:42,550
Okay. I take it back.

936
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:44,870
So, I can't just give up.

937
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:47,190
Within three days, I'll make a sofa.

938
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:51,150
Are you sure you want to make it?

939
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,590
Yes.

940
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:55,910
Trust me.

941
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,110
Alright.

942
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:08,150
Go to bed early tonight.

943
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,030
Tomorrow morning,

944
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,670
we'll go to the bamboo forest in the west.

945
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:12,070
Why?

946
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,190
Lin said

947
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,470
the bamboo in the west

948
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:16,190
is less hard.

949
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:18,630
Your soft skin is not likely to get hurt there.

950
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,550
I knew it.

951
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:21,710
Dad cares for me.

952
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:23,790
He's not your dad yet.

953
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:25,390
You haven't passed his test.

954
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:27,990
Don't you trust me?

955
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:06,360
Here.

956
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,230
Okay.

957
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:07,070
What are you doing?

958
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:09,850
I'm doing something important tonight.

959
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:11,390
What? Are you running away from home?

960
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:12,550
No.

961
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:14,830
Peter.

962
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:17,350
It won't come true if you say it out loud.

963
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:20,390
What are you two up to?

964
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:22,790
We

965
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:25,430
are going to see the magic of nature.

966
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:09,720
What are you looking at?

967
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,360
The magic has begun.

968
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:06,710
Little butterfly, have a good life.

969
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:08,670
You're the miracle of life.

970
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:11,470
Goodbye, little butterfly.

971
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,870
♫It's like a dream♫

972
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:18,390
♫The years of misunderstanding♫

973
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:25,440
♫Before realizing it, we've stopped moving forward♫

974
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:30,930
♫We struggle, feel confused, and have regrets♫

975
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:34,630
♫I have to tell white lies♫

976
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:33,510
Sorry.

977
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:34,910
I can't help it.

978
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:39,810
♫So that you can fly high in the sky♫

979
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:39,390
At that time,

980
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:41,910
I came back to Master

981
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:43,550
♫The path of turning back♫

982
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:43,430
with Peter.

983
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:47,440
♫It tests for yearning with reunion♫

984
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:46,830
I used to be so familiar

985
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,160
with everything there,

986
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:50,630
but every minute after I went back

987
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:54,180
♫How can time express the way I miss you♫

988
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:52,030
was suffocating.

989
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:54,950
I kept telling myself

990
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:57,610
♫When the knot in my heart is removed♫

991
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:56,750
that I had to make it through,

992
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:58,430
or I'd die.

993
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:02,820
♫I smile and answer with my eyes♫

994
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:03,310
It was a bit like metamorphosis.

995
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:06,840
♫In a daze, time seems to shorten♫

996
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:06,230
But just now,

997
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:07,510
I suddenly realized

998
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:09,990
♫My heart melts the distance♫

999
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:10,190
that the world

1000
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:13,420
♫Love remembers♫

1001
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:11,910
after it was reborn

1002
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:17,010
♫Us from before♫

1003
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:14,670
is so big.

1004
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:19,960
♫The love I miss is unique♫

1005
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:18,710
That butterfly

1006
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:22,530
♫After wandering♫

1007
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:21,030
was so beautiful.

1008
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:24,820
♫Still vaguely like yesterday♫

1009
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:27,280
♫There will always be wind♫

1010
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,890
♫Blowing away my blues♫

1011
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:29,190
Tong Xin,

1012
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,130
♫I see your clear features again♫

1013
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:35,040
you're very beautiful too.

1014
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:41,170
♫Like stars illuminating the night sky♫

1015
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:41,030
What are you talking about?

1016
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:43,390
Son, you must be hungry.

1017
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:44,230
Let's go find Grandpa Lin

1018
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:45,030
for lunch.

1019
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:47,110
Come.
