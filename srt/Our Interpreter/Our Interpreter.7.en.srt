00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:44,960
Do you have tissues?

380
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:55,830
Help me...

381
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,430
Are you okay?

382
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,270
I'm fine.

383
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,670
I've never seen you come to an event before.

384
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,470
Peter's mother is busy.

385
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,230
I'm an emergency replacement.

386
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:45,750
Emergency replacement

387
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,030
or officially on duty?

388
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:49,590
Peter seems to like you very much.

389
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,990
Will he live with his mother

390
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,110
or with you two?

391
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:55,990
You misunderstood.

392
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,430
We are all adults.

393
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,190
We understand everything.

394
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:58,590
How about this?

395
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,510
After the event,

396
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:00,750
I'll add you to the class' group chat.

397
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:01,440
No need.

398
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:02,390
I have to.

399
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,310
There are many notices

400
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,780
in the class' group chat recently.

401
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,390
Every day, the teachers are lecturing us

402
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:07,490
in the group chat.

403
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,030
I'll invite you in later.

404
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,110
Didn't I add you on WeChat?

405
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,950
Papa, do you like her?

406
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:20,910
Mom told me.

407
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,440
What...

408
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:28,430
do you think of her?

409
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,270
If she can

410
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,590
win the wand for me,

411
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:32,830
I'll like her too.

412
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:37,550
Okay.

413
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:39,870
Ready...

414
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,870
♫An orange breeze blows through the dawn♫

415
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:51,060

00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:16,110
♫I was once wandering around in disarray♫

00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,700

00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,250

What's wrong?

433

Are you okay?

434
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:47,510
Can you walk?

435
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,190
No.

Sorry

441
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:37,750
for making you lose the game.

442
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,110
Next time,

443
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:43,240
I'll give Peter a gift to make up for it.

444
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:45,150
No need.

445
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,780
It was just a game.

446
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:57,150
You're not afraid of getting dirty now?

447
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,870
When I first arrived in America,

448
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,480
the intermediary helped me arrange

449
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,270
a homestay,

450
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,070
where I stayed in the garage.

451
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:08,510
Every day when I ate,

452
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:09,630
I could taste gasoline.

453
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:11,030
Do you think I'd still be afraid of dirt?

454
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,510
You didn't have it easy.

455
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:20,830
What about you?

456
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,150
Have you been

457
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,910
doing well these years?

458
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:33,910
I've been fine, I guess.

459
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,510
Why did you go to the sales department?

460
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:42,590
It's a long story.

461
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,950
Then cut to the chase.

462
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,550
Mr. Zhang thinks

463
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:51,750
I'm being too thorny

464
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:52,780
and need my edges to be smoothed down.

465
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,750
I protested and he rejected it.

466
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,510
I can only accept it.

467
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,710
This is not like you.

468
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,540
You can endure dirt

469
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,870
overcome mysophobia,

470
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:09,070
and face the result calmly

471
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:10,630
is unlike you too.

472
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:17,510
Do you prefer your current self

473
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:19,510
of your past self more?

474
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,670
I don't know.

475
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:24,110
Let me change it to another question then.

476
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:29,230
Do you prefer the current me

477
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:31,710
or the past me?

478
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:40,630
We're almost there.

479
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:42,830
You're awake.

480
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:43,870
We're almost there.

481
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:06,790
Here.

482
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:08,670
Mr. Xiao,

483
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:09,990
I shall leave first.

484
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:16,310
Tong Xin.

485
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,270
Did you say it?

486
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,190
Say what?

487
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:19,430
That you and I

488
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:21,110
are just business partners.

489
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:23,160
Don't let your ex-girlfriend misunderstand

490
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,190
and ruin your plan of getting her back.

491
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:26,270
Got it.

492
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:31,670
She...

493
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,150
Aren't you looking for Tong Xin?

494
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:34,230
She's back.

495
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:37,030
It's okay. There's no rush.

496
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:37,990
I'm leaving.

497
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,030
Bye bye.

498
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:39,910
Bye bye.

499
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:46,550
What's wrong?

500
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:48,590
I'm fine.

501
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:56,710
Keep up.

502
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,150
Hold on.

503
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:17,870
Hello, Lele.

504
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:19,030
Hi Peter.

505
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,670
You went to stake again?

506
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:22,830
Yes, what about you?

507
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,150
This is my papa.

508
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,590
Hello, Uncle.

509
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,880
My papa took me to

510
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,670
the parent-child sports event.

511
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,590
Your papa is not carrying

512
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:33,070
your mom, right?

513
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,990
She's my papa's friend.

514
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:37,230
Your papa's friend

515
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:38,470
needs to be carried?

516
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:44,230
Bye bye.

517
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:44,990
Bye bye.

518
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,110
Mommy.

519
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,190
You're back.

520
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:06,960
Mr. Tong.

521
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:07,990
Well,

522
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,110
don't get me wrong.

523
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,470
Let me explain.

524
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:11,670
I sprained my ankle.

525
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,270
So, Mr. Xiao...

526
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:14,870
Come in and sit.

527
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,630
Lin Xi,

528
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:20,310
whose parent are you?

529
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,680
Yes, please change your name in the group chat.

530
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:23,630
Peter's mother?

531
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:26,030
Isn't Peter's mother in the group?

532
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,370
@Peter's mother.

533
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:28,950
Lin Xi and Peter's dad

534
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:29,750
are together?

535
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:30,590
Let's go.

536
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,630
Ms. Tong, let me explain.

537
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,670
Explain what?

538
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,150
You two have such good chemistry

539
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:39,750
so others thought

540
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,910
you are his new mother.

541
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:41,910
I'm really sorry.

542
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:43,470
I should be the one who should be sorry

543
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:44,750
for asking you to take over me.

544
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,020
Now things this show is about to become real.

545
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,030
You can leave now.

546
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:51,310
How could you be

547
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,180
so rude to a guest?

548
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,280
I'm talking about you.

549
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,310
No, no.

550
00:26:58,370 --> 00:26:59,650
I should leave.

551
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:01,030
Your whole family is here.

552
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:03,070
I'm the one who's causing you trouble.

553
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:03,810
Sorry.

554
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,400
Let me see you off.

555
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,770
You haven't made it clear yet?

556
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:11,340
Don't be so nervous.

557
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:13,190
Yuyi doesn't prohibit

558
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:15,130
romantic relationships between employees and clients.

559
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,470
Does Huasheng not

560
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:17,710
allow that?

561
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:18,270
No.

562
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,390
That's good then.

563
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,670
Why are you so nervous?

564
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:26,990
Mom.

565
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,590
Let's go back to our room.

566
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:30,430
We're going back to our room.

567
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:31,230
Take your time.

568
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,270
You...

569
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:36,030
Aren't you a family? You don't stay together?

570
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:45,830
Who told you that we are a family?

571
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:49,920
Director Lin,

572
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,430
did you misunderstand?

573
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:54,350
Xiao is just Peter's godfather.

574
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:55,470
That's all.

575
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,870

576
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,550
Did you think

577
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:02,910
Tong Xin and I are...

578
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,550
I'm divorced.

579
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,630
I've been single.

580
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,030
Xiao and I

581
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,830
are just business partners and friends.

582
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,630
Don't worry. I don't like him.

583
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:12,750
Do you need me

584
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,150
to arrange a blind date for you?

585
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:15,470
Don't worry about me.

586
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,830
Just focus on your own business.

587
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,390
Don't you have work

588
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:23,430
you have to talk about with Tong Xin?

589
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,670
Yes, Ms. Tong.

590
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,630
There are some things

591
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:30,030
I would like to communicate with you on about Yuyi.

592
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,270
Sorry, Lin Xi.

593
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:33,350
I have to get Peter to study.

594
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:34,680
As for the rest,

595
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,190
just discuss with Mr. Xiao.

596
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,230
See you.

597

600
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:53,510
What do you think of Auntie Lin Xi?

601
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,870
I like her very much.

602
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:56,790
I think

603
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:57,590
you will have

604
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,500

Have a seat.

606
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:06,870
I thought...

607
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,750
That I'm Peter's father?

608
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,750
He doesn't look like you.

609
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,190
Why didn't you ask before?

610
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,550
This is my client's privacy.

611
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,550
Why would I ask?

612
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:28,790
You should have told me.

613
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:30,390
It's your client's privacy.

614
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,590
Why would I tell you?

616
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,540
That's hurtful.

00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:44,310
I also treat you as a friend.

618
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:46,590
Friend?

619
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:50,100
Your friend has a kid

620
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,710
that calls him dad.

621
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:53,630
Would you not ask?

622
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,830
Is it that you don't want to ask?

623
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,830
Or dare not to ask?

624
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:07,790

what's good about that face mask?

It is just very good.

725
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:07,230
It keeps moisture in and is moisturizing.

726
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,830
You buy over 100 masks

727
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:13,750
from me every month.

728
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:15,630
Even if we use three or four of them each day,

729
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:17,230
you can barely use them all.

730
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:19,150
Even female celebrities don't work as hard as you do.

731
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:20,469
Yes.

732
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:22,389
I give them to my friends too.

733
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:23,389
I recommend it to them

734

and they like it very much.

735
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:24,710
So...

736
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:26,949
It makes sense.

737
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,100
But what now?

738
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,070
I won't sell it anymore.

739
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,590
You don't have to look for me anymore.

740
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:37,429
Why?

741
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,870
Y-You can sell something else.

742
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:40,520
Anything is fine.

743
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,150
I'm not selling it.

744
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,150
I'm not selling anything anymore.

745
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,750
I need to settle down

746
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,270
to take the CATTI Level 2 Interpretation test.

747
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:51,350
So after this meal,

748
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:52,670
we won't

749
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,949
see each other again.

750
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:57,790
But...

751
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,310
But what?

752
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:06,750
But I...

753
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:11,750
I still want to see you.

754
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:16,710
Oh right,

755
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:18,110
I'm good at English.

756
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,030
I can tutor you.

757
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:19,790
Why?

758
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:21,920
I'm going to take TOEFL soon.

759
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,910
I've read a lot of books recently.

760
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:23,830
I mean

761
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:25,310
why do you want to see me?

762
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:28,830
I...

763
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:34,590
Even my boyfriend

764
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,870
is not as clingy as you.

765
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,230
You have a boyfriend?

766
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:38,550
Why?

767
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:43,110
Nothing.

768
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,430
Do you have a girlfriend?

769
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:50,270
No.

770
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:55,030
No wonder you are so free.

771
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:56,670
Let me introduce someone to you.

772
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,870
No need.

773
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,310
Let me introduce someone to you.

774
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:02,310
I got them to come here.

775
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:03,070
They are outside.

776
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:04,670
It's okay. It's really okay.

777
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:05,190
I'll call her in.

778
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:05,910
No, no, no.

779
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,230
I have something to do. I have to go.

780
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:10,150
She's already here.

781
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,230
It's impolite to not meet her.

782
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:11,910
No, I...

783
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:12,710
I'm going to get angry.

784
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:19,980
Wait.

785
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:55,140

Wait for me. Don't go.

819
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:12,390
I... I like you.

820
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:26,310
Here.

821
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,790
What? Are you afraid I'll poison you?

822
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:35,750
So many delicious food.

823
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:36,830
Do you want to join us?

824
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:37,510
No.

825
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:39,070
I'm taking Peter to buy pizza.

826
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:49,760
Try it.

827
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,230
What's wrong?

828
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,510
It's spicy.

829
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,500
Didn't you use to take spice well?

830
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:21,480
It's pretty good.

831
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:33,100
This is even spicier.

832
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:46,480
I used to eat whatever I wanted.

833
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:47,590
Now,

834
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:49,900
I don't even have the freedom to have a stomachache.

835
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:54,940
Well,

836
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:57,670
do you prefer the past me

837
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:58,880
or the current me?

838
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:18,950
Xiao.

839
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:19,590
Mr. Xiao.

840
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:21,180
It smells so good.

841
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:22,230
What did you cook

842
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:23,070
to entertain me?

843
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:26,870
Lin Xi?

844
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:29,430
Long time no see.

845
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:32,350
Long time no see.

846
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:35,910
Did you forget we were meeting tonight?

847
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,510
No.

848
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:44,670
Where are you going?

849
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:46,870
If you have things to talk about

850
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:47,870
I'll leave you alone.

851
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:48,470
I'll be on my way.

852
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:48,990
Let me give you a ride.

853
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:49,710
No need.

854
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:52,910
Serve her.

855
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:53,470
Okay.

856
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:54,630
I'll wait for you.

857
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:01,830
Lin Xi.

858
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:07,910
Why are you leaving in such a hurry?

859
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,110
It's okay. I won't bother you.

860
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:13,190
Don't worry.

861
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,660
I have something to do.

862
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:18,990
See you.

863
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:23,870
To you,

864
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:24,750
are there things more important

865
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:25,750
than work?

866
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:27,510
Mr. Xiao,

867
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:29,110
someone is waiting for you upstairs.

868
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:30,750
But it's

869
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:31,990
first come, first served, right?

870
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:34,280
Bye bye.

871
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:05,430
Xiao Yicheng is calling.

872
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:07,280
[Xiao Yicheng]

873
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:07,030
Would you like to answer or hang up?

874
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:10,140
[Xiao Yicheng]

875
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:10,140
[Reject] [Answer]

876
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:18,590
When Xiao was in school,

877
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:19,430
was he not popular

878
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:20,310
among girls?

879
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:22,710
A lot of people pursued him.

880
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:24,870
You're back.

881
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:26,710
I'm having a good chat with Ms. Tong.

882
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:27,590
Okay.

883
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:39,560
Lin Xi.

884
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:42,030
Chen Xiao is just here to record a slogan.

885
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,890
You're still up?

886
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:54,030
Why are you so happy?

887
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:56,030
Am I?

888
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:56,950
Yes.

889
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,760
You don't have to explain this to me.

890
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:08,030
There are enough misunderstandings

891
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:08,950
between us.

892
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:10,390
I don't want

893
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,000
to create another one

894
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:13,180
when we have just solved one.

895
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:18,780
Xiao Yicheng,

896
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,780
You look like you have

897
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:23,210
"fell in love" written on your face.

898
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,360
Did she accept your confession?

899
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,420
No.

900
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:29,790
But it doesn't matter.

901
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:37,230
It doesn't matter?

902
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:41,770
Force doesn't work on her

903
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:42,910
but she is soft-hearted.

904
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:44,650
I can't force her.

905
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:47,790
So you plan to

906
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:48,870
use a soft tactic?

907
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:50,670
I think

908
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,290
she has feelings for me.

909
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:55,670
So,

910
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:56,470
I want her to

911
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:57,750
face her feelings.

912
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:02,670
I suddenly pity Lin Xi.

913
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:04,790
You need to know

914
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:06,000
which side you are on.
