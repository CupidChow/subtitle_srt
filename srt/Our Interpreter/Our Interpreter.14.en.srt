1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,000
Go on.

3
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,190
An employee seeking revenge

4
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,800
wants to destroy Huasheng's project.

5
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,560
Yuyi's just an innocent party

6
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,680
who got involved.

7
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,470
I've checked.

8
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,280
This Lisa

9
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,800
was interviewed for Yuyi's offline events.

10
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,750
But she already failed

11
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,810
in the first round.

12
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,310
Mr. Xiao, I heard that Director Lin

13
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,640
has offended many people in the industry.

14
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,280
So...

15
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,870
you're saying

16
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,000
you want me to sacrifice Lin Xi, right?

17
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,520
Change the plan.

18
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:03,950
It's the only way

19
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,030
we can survive.

20
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,710
Xiao, think about it.

21
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,520
You think so too?

22
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,470
As long as Lin Xi takes the responsibility,

23
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,560
I'll recommend her to

24
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,120
a translation company in Singapore.

25
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,520
The position and treatment she'd receive there

26
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,780
would be at least on par with Huasheng's.

27
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,280
Xiao, I...

28
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,560
know about your relationship.

29
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,400
I understand.

30
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,079
But you have to be rational.

31
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,280
My attitude is clear.

32
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,560
I have no prejudices

33
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,800
against Lin Xi.

34
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,800
But the business world is like a battlefield.

35
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,910
For Yuyi,

36
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,710
you have to make a choice.

37
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,590
Tong Xin.

38
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,360
It's not about emotional ties.

39
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,240
Yuyi

40
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,570
mustn't do such a thing.

41
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,910
I'll say it again.

42
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,800
Change the plan for me.

43
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,630
Mr. Xiao.

44
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:41,910
The window of opportunity for crisis PR

45
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:42,840
is 24 hours.

46
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,640
It takes time to change the plan.

47
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,530
I didn't expect that I'm so unpopular.

48
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,630
Don't worry.

49
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,120
I rejected their plan.

50
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,680
The management and development of a company

51
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,430
do not depend on just one person,

52
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,680
but the hard work of many people

53
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,190
behind the scenes.

54
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,630
To make me take the fall is,

55
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,080
rationally speaking, the best way.

56
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,830
What about emotionally?

57
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,680
What emotions?

58
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,360
In public,

59
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,430
Huasheng and Yuyi

60
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,390
rise and fall together.

61
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,070
I don't want to implicate the innocent.

62
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,159
In private,

63
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:36,830
I will never

64
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,630
let the woman I love

65
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,750
be my shield.

66
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:39,950
But I won't give you the chance

67
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,070
to be my knight in shining armor.

68
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,360
It's not up to you now.

69
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,270
Lin Xi.

70
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,870
I still have the final say in Yuyi.

71
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,360
Can you stop being crazy?

72
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,950
I'm very calm.

73
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,070
Right now,

74
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,330
is there any other way?

75
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,040
Speaking of which,

76
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,800
I've never been to Singapore.

77
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,920
You can help me ask Ms. Tong

78
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,630
about the salary

79
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,160
of companies in Singapore.

80
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,390
Tong Xin.

81
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,630
Arrange a press conference

82
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,160
for me for this Friday.

83
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,360
Invite

84
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,390
all the domestic

85
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,920
technology media outlets.

86
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,400
What are you going to do?

87
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,720
Do you know what Yuyi's

88
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,600
full name is?

89
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,480
Yuyi Tianxia.

90
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,830
Yes, Yuyi Tianxia.

91
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,750
So?

92
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,870
So,

93
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,170
I will arrange a press conference

94
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,770
to announce the launch of Yuyi's 2.0 version.

95
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,120
This is not the time for you to be willful.

96
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,070
Don't worry.

97
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,870
I will never be willful

98
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,930
with the money of hundreds of people.

99
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,270
But I want everyone

100
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:56,920
to know

101
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:58,310
the problem they're crusading against

102
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,600
is not a problem at all.

103
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:06,950
So,

104
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,750
as long as you launch the 2.0 version

105
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,120
and it's high-end and precise,

106
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,510
then the pros and cons of the 1.0 version

107
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,920
are negligible

108
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,120
to the outside world.

109
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,310
That's right.

110
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,430
But it's only been a few months

111
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,950
since you launched the 1.0 version.

112
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:25,950
Don't take the risk.

113
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,310
I'm confident in my product.

114
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,870
It's not about confidence.

115
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,750
Right now, all eyes

116
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,510
are on you.

117
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,600
Everyone will bear

118
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,480
a critical attitude

119
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,560
at the press conference of the 2.0 version.

120
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,600
If there are any flaws,

121
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,560
this press conference

122
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,920
will backfire.

123
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,390
Never.

124
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,390
Xiao Yicheng.

125
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,870
Every time you are this confident,

126
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,430
I really want to kill you.

127
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,630
I'm expensive. You can't afford it.

128
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:56,950
Unless...

129
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,360
I won't talk nonsense with you.

130
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,820
I'll figure it out myself.

131
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,710
I'll take you somewhere.

132
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,270
Where?

133
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,070
Let go of me first!

134
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,920
Xiao Yicheng.

135
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,750
Can you stop causing trouble?

136
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:11,310
This is not the time

137
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,270
to be childish.

138
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,480
Take a nap.

139
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:31,750
We'll be there soon.

140
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,360
Where are you taking me?

141
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,290
Meizhou Island.

142
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,270
Over half a year,

143
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,370
we've reviewed it over 100 times.

144
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,240
The accuracy rate is quite high.

145
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,840
Is there any category that is

146
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,840
relatively weak?

147
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,030
In terms of orthopedics,

148
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,750
there's a 2% margin of error.

149
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,550
Understood.

150
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:06,750
Lin Xi.

151
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,670
This is Uncle Feng,

152
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,600
the director of the health center.

153
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,630
This is Lin Xi.

154
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,000
Hello.

155
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,120
Hello.

156
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,440
Thank you for making this trip.

157
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,390
You drove for almost three hours.

158
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,390
You must be tired.

159
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,870
Take a rest.

160
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,270
I'll ask my wife

161
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,730
to prepare dinner for you.

162
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,120
Thank you.

163
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,520
You're welcome.

164
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,440
Have a seat.

165
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,120
Take a rest.

166
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,150
I'll be back soon.

167
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,840
What are we doing here?

168
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,960
Auntie Feng is good at cooking.

169
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,910
You're lucky.

170
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,390
We came here to eat?

171
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,360
Yes.

172
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,510
Food is the most important thing for people.

173
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,510
Eating is the most important thing.

174
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,030
The scenery is beautiful in Meizhou Island.

175
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,760
Let's travel around tomorrow.

176
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,670
Your coat.

177
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,960
I'll drive myself back.

178
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,150
Uncle Feng!

179
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,750
Doctor.

180
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,190
Dr. Feng.

181
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:57,510
Shi.

182
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,360
Come, have a seat.

183
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:58,910
Dr. Feng.

184
00:09:58,910 --> 00:09:59,360
Have a seat.

185
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,120
Wait.

186
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:03,080
You should at least say goodbye to Uncle Feng.

187
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,450
Let's wait for a bit.

188
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,790
Shi.

189
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,910
What's wrong with you lately?

190
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:11,000
I've been feeling weak these days.

191
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,720
My dad has been feeling dizzy

192
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,960
and weak all over.

193
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,390
Let's check his blood pressure first.

194
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:16,960
Okay.

195
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,120
-Okay.
-Here.

196
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,650
Your blood pressure is unstable.

197
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,670
Have you been taking the medicine

198
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,760
for high blood pressure lately?

199
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,030
When I'm busy with farming,

200
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,510
I forget to take it.

201
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:50,440
How can you stop taking the high blood pressure medicine?

202
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,170
You can't do whatever you want.

203
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,440
Now you're feeling unwell, aren't you?

204
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,670
If your illness

205
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:58,360
gets worse, it'll be severe.

206
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,750
It'll damage your heart and brain.

207
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,510
Is it that serious?

208
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,870
Don't scare me, Dr. Feng.

209
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,240
Why would I scare you?

210
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,150
Come on.

211
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,200
This way.

212
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,400
Bring the stool here.

213
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,080
Here.

214
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,480
W-W-What are you doing?

215
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,240
Let's double check it.

216
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:16,900
Don't move.

217
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,150
You don't have to double check it.

218
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,350
I'll be fine after taking the medicine.

219
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,220
I still have a mahjong game later.

220
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:23,870
A few minutes

221
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,600
don't matter in a mahjong game.

222
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:27,080
Uncle Feng.

223
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:27,630
Okay.

224
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,000
Who is this?

225
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,320
Uncle.

226
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,320
It's possible that you have a brain infarction.

227
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,910
You'd better go to Sanjia Hospital in the city

228
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:48,710
for a checkup.

229
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,630
This afternoon,

230
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,150
my dad had two bowls of rice for lunch.

231
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,390
How could he have a brain infarction?

232
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:54,200
Yes.

233
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:54,910
This is

234
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,390
the AI doctor's prediction.

235
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,030
Understand?

236
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,240
Just in case.

237
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,440
What AI doctor?

238
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,390
Here.

239
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:03,120
This machine

240
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,240
covers over 10,000 medical books

241
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,750
domestically and internationally

242
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,030
and over 300,000

243
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,870
clinical cases.

244
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:08,750
It also passed

245
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,440
the physician qualification test.

246
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,120
It has an accuracy of over 90%

247
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,600
in terms of pathological diagnosis.

248
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,910
How...

249
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,910
How is that possible?

250
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,320
So you mean...

251
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,440
Is this...

252
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,240
Is this that good?

253
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,790
Uncle.

254
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,440
In a way,

255
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,570
it's more professional than a doctor.

256
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,080
Impossible.

257
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,360
H-How can this machine

258
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,360
be as accurate as a doctor's diagnosis?

259
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,240
Shi.

260
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,120
A brain infarction

261
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,750
is a serious matter.

262
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,320
Go to the city hospital now.

263
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,630
There's no need.

264
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,510
I'll be fine after taking some medicine.

265
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,600
Besides, it takes

266
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,660
more than half a day to get to the city.

267
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:44,670
No, you have to go.

268
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,200
Can you drive?

269
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:45,750
Yes.

270
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,440
The car key.

271
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,270
Here, take my car.

272
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,670
All right, stop dawdling.

273
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,200
Go now.

274
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,720
This is no joking matter.

275
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,840
Is that so?

276
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,720
Get in the car.

277
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,000
Come on.

278
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,600
It's that one.

279
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,320
Hurry up.

280
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,600
This is what you really want me

281
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,550
to see, right?

282
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,120
Drive safely.

283
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,170
It's in the trial operation stage.

284
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,120
Be careful.

285
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,850
Okay, got it.

286
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,670
I won't eat then.

287
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:12,550
I'll go back early

288
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,600
to make a plan.

289
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,240
Sure.

290
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,390
But the car is gone.

291
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,660
It was a matter of life and death. I had no choice.

292
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,670
Xiao, here.

293
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,750
Here's your bag.

294
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,440
You guys talk.

295
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,550
I'll go and ask my wife

296
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,630
to prepare some food for you.

297
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:34,720
Take your time.

298
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,270
Okay.

299
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:35,790
Thank you.

300
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:36,510
No problem.

301
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,770
Mountain roads are just like this.

302
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,510
It rains all of a sudden.

303
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:54,510
Be careful, the ground's slippery.

304
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,050
Tell me about your plan.

305
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,510
I'll take drastic measures.

306
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,840
You want to announce the AI doctor

307
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,840
at the press conference

308
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,630
to show everyone

309
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,360
Yuyi's technical competence?

310
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,840
Yuyi Tianxia

311
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,390
is called "Translation World"

312
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,150
and not "Language Translation"

313
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,270
because

314
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,130
it is my technological universe.

315
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,150
So by letting the world

316
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,320
see that you are capable enough

317
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,580
to create an AI doctor,

318
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,270
the algorithm of the translation device

319
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,320
will no longer be a problem?

320
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:31,840
Yes.

321
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,720
Then the criticism about you

322
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,920
can be clarified too.

323
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,020
It's okay. I'm not important.

324
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,150
No, you're important.

325
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,270
Lin Xi.

326
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,550
Even if it were someone else

327
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,950
and another work partner,

328
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,240
I would say the same.

329
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,200
Thank you.

330
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,630
But...

331
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,600
since you have a plan,

332
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,910
you could just launch your AI doctor

333
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,720
at the press conference

334
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,480
directly.

335
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,880
Why did you bring me here?

336
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,440
I want you to feel it for yourself

337
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:14,000
and give me some advice.

338
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,910
There are so many people in your company

339
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,510
and you have so many friends.

340
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,600
Yet it had to be me?

341
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,870
Tong Xin has work to do.

342
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,440
Maomao

343
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:29,960
is smart

344
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,490
but not meticulous enough.

345
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,200
As for Zhou Shuang and Li Jun,

346
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,330
they're taking care of their wives and children at home.

347
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,790
Oh, right.

348
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,630
There's another person.

349
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,870
It's someone we both have known

350
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,630
for so many years.

351
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,120
It's not too late

352
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,250
to get them here now.

353
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,030
That makes sense.

354
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,150
Hello, it's me.

355
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,670
I'm on a business trip at Meizhou Island.

356
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,000
Do you want to come over?

357
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,240
I'm with Lin Xi.

358
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,690
They want to talk to you.

359
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,910
That's not necessary.

360
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:10,840
We're not close.

361
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,510
Of course not.

362
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,390
You've known each other for so long.

363
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,360
How are you not close?

364
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,760
Knowing someone doesn't mean we're close.

365
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,200
Wei.

366
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,200
What happened?

367
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,750
How did you offend your leader?

368
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,910
It's Wei Tian?

369
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,690
Who did you think it was?

370
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,080
Hello.

371
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,000
What's up with this absurd phone ceall

372
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,910
from Xiao?

373
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:38,840
Also,

374
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,100
why did you go to Meizhou Island with him?

375
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:42,600
Nothing.

376
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,060
Let's talk about it later.

377
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,480
Just now,

378
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,030
who did you think I called?

379
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,550
Stupid.

380
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,130
Make yourself at home.

381
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,590
Here. There's another dish.

382
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,490
Is everything here?

383
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:04,349
Yes.

384
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:05,069
Okay.

385
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:06,550
Come on, cheers.

386
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,839
Don't stand on ceremony.

387
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:12,200
I made it myself.

388
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,240
It's delicious.

389
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,790
It's just some home-cooked dishes.

390
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:16,720
I hope it's not too shabby.

391
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,880
No way.

392
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,829
Here, try it.

393
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,200
Thank you for going to all the trouble.

394
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,000
Don't mention it.

395
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,160
Our kids have all grown up

396
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,270
and they are not around.

397
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,440
Usually,

398
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,640
it's just us two old folks at home.

399
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,510
Yes.

400
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,880
Your Uncle Feng and I

401
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,070
are very happy that you're here today.

402
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,400
Don't stand on ceremony.

403
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,440
Eat whatever you want.

404
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,110
Help yourselves.

405
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,440
Here. Help yourselves.

406
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,160
Lin Xi.

407
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,160
Auntie Feng made this

408
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,550
assorted oyster pancakes.

409
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,160
It's especially good. Try it.

410
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:42,750
Try it.

411
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:43,640
It's her signature dish, right?

412
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,110
Yes, try it.

413
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:55,480
It's very fresh.

414
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,210
-Eat more if you like it.
-Shi.

415
00:17:59,030 --> 00:17:59,920
Okay.

416
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,640
Got it.

417
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:01,440
Okay.

418
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,310
What's wrong?

419
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,240
Shi was diagnosed

420
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,920
with a minor brain infarction.

421
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,160
He wants to talk to you.

422
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:07,720
Okay.

423
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:08,480
Here.

424
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,720
Hello.

425
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,000
Hello, Mr. Xiao.

426
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,880
Don't worry.

427
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,410
I'll drive the car back now.

428
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:20,150
You can only return it tomorrow?

429
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,160
There's no one to take care of Uncle?

430
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,750
Okay, I see.

431
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,110
Go ahead with your affairs.

432
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:26,750
Okay.

433
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,270
Uncle Feng.

434
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,720
They might have to return the car tomorrow.

435
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,920
Tonight,

436
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,920
we'll have to stay here.

437
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,110
Xiao.

438
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,750
Do you know now that

439
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,960
we have the AI doctor,

440
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,240
our health center

441
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,030
has become famous

442
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,510
throughout the vicinity.

443
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:50,920
Yes.

444
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,440
There are

445
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,070
patients in nearby towns

446
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,110
who purposely come here

447
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,200
with their medical records

448
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,310
mainly to

449
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,790
ask the AI doctor

450
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,070
to assist in the examination.

451
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:01,800
Yes.

452
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,710
Right now, the machine

453
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,000
is not perfect yet.

454
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,270
The researchers and developers

455
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,870
are also constantly revising it.

456
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:10,110
But I believe

457
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,840
that within two to three years,

458
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,960
the accuracy rate

459
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,350
can be increased by 3%.

460
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,240
-Okay.
-Really?

461
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,160
That's great.

462
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,830
All the best medical resources

463
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,240
are now in big cities.

464
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,750
A small town like ours

465
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,110
is indeed behind.

466
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,400
Uncle Feng.

467
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,350
Actually, this is my original intention

468
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,550
of creating the AI doctor.

469
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,720
Now,

470
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,510
it's hard and expensive to see a doctor.

471
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:30,790
To a large extent,

472
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,000
this is due to the lack of

473
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,750
truly stratified diagnosis and treatment.

474
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,920
So I want to break this barrier

475
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,440
and allow small towns

476
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,480
to enjoy the same medical resources

477
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,480
that are in big cities.

478
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:42,680
Well said.

479
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,070
Enough talking.

480
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,200
Let me make a toast to you.

481
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:45,830
-No, no, no.
-Come on.

482
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:46,590
Let me make a toast to you.

483
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,310
Cheers.

484
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,880
Have some food to ease your stomach.

485
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,830
Lin.

486
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:55,110
This is the rice wine I made.

487
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,030
Have a taste.

488
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:56,690
Uncle Feng.

489
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,240
She has a bad stomach.

490
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,240
Let her have some soup.

491
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,000
Okay.

492
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,680
As you please.

493
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,160
Here.

494
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,550
Make yourselves at home.

495
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,350
Come on.

496
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:09,030
Here, have some soup.

497
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,230
It's good to be young.

498
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,310
Look how affectionate

499
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,590
the young couple is.

500
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,240
How long have you been married?

501
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,010
You're preparing for a child soon, yeah?

502
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,720
We're not...

503
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,270
Auntie, she's bickering with me.

504
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,480
Got it.

505
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,440
I understand.

506
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:31,070
Just like me and your auntie.

507
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,810
Don’t talk about me.

508
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,830
Lin.

509
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,400
I saw a photo of you two

510
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,550
in his wallet.

511
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,910
It's just a lover's spat.

512
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,270
I understand.

513
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:42,550
Come on.

514
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,270
Come on.

515
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,400
Young couples

516
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,480
shouldn't go to bed with anger.

517
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,750
After dinner,

518
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,640
I'll tidy up a room for you.

519
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,480
You'll stay here tonight.

520
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,120
Make yourselves at home.

521
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,000
Auntie Feng.

522
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,680
Can I sleep with you tonight?

523
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,480
Yes, Mr. Yi. I'm really sorry.

524
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,160
I know.

525
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,110
But...

526
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,200
we're currently really...

527
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,790
This case is very tricky.

528
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,480
Otherwise, I wouldn't

529
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,750
keep bothering you.

530
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,680
I know. Then can you...

531
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,310
What's with you?

532
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,350
You're even making a video call?

533
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,160
Where are you?

534
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,160
I'm outside.

535
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,600
What's the matter?

536
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,790
Is there a problem with the translation?

537
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:48,640
No.

538
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,750
I just wanted to ask you

539
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,240
why you aren't back yet at such a late hour.

540
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,200
It's not me.

541
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,860
Grandaunt asked me to ask you.

542
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,510
I'm not going back tonight.

543
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,920
Inform Granny Li for me.

544
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,270
Why aren't you coming back?

545
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,530
Where did you go alone?

546
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,880
I'm outside.

547
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,680
It's not safe for you to be alone.

548
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,400
Why are you there?

549
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,000
Lin Xi is safe with me.

550
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,860
You don't have to worry about her.

551
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,830
Xiao Yicheng.

552
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,640
What are you doing?

553
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,000
He's pursuing you.

554
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,070
Lin Xi, listen.

555
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,590
Indecision invariably leads to trouble.

556
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:31,590
Do you understand that?

557
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,680
I'll handle it myself.

558
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,640
How?

559
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,960
It's one thing for me to give you time.

560
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,750
It's another thing

561
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,410
that a love rival has shown up.

562
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:44,160
I know what to do. It's none of your business.

563
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,640
Fine.

564
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,680
You're still up?

565
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:52,400
I slept too much in the car this afternoon.

566
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,550
Why are you still up too?

567
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,310
I slept late.

568
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,750
This won't do.

569
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:47,680
Come on.

570
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:22,960
How is it?

571
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:27,070
Why don't you stop reading?

572
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,560
It's hard for me to say this.

573
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,640
What's wrong with me?

574
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,590
How about this? When you're back in Xiahai,

575
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,440
go to a hospital to verify it.

576
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:40,720
Let me see.

577
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,200
-No.
-What's wrong?

578
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:41,720
Don't look at it.

579
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,430
Don't look at it, really.

580
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:42,830
Let me see.

581
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:43,480
No, don't look at it.

582
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,000
Let me see.

583
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,480
Don't look at it.

584
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,810
-It's really nothing...
-Show it to me...

585
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,590
Fine, I won't look at it.

586
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,640
Who cares?

587
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,320
Forget it.

588
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,920
If you really want to know,

589
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,200
I can tell you.

590
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,030
No need.

591
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:23,160
The report says...

592
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,440
your periods are irregular.

593
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,160
Wait, you asked me for it.

594
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:35,920
Wait.

595
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,030
Don't waste food.

596
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,510
Don't move.

597
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,680
Wait.

598
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,070
This report

599
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:41,680
has a treatment suggestion

600
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,550
that we can try.

601
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,720
No thanks.

602
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,680
You said you would help me.

603
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:47,750
I forgot.

604
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,400
The press conference is coming.

605
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,680
I can only fight back with it.

606
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,400
If you don't help me,

607
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,460
I have no other way.

608
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,350
How can we try it?

609
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,510
Hang in there.

610
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:19,770
This acupoint adjusts your qi and blood.

611
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,680
Do you feel anything?

612
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,550
Yes.

613
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,030
That's good.

614
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:30,000
I feel like I want to kill someone.

615
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,270
It can't be.

616
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:40,750
This acupoint should be for soreness and swelling.

617
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,480
Xiao Yicheng.

618
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,240
Are you taking revenge on me?

619
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,310
I'll switch acupoints.

620
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,110
Come on.

621
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:53,750
Here is the Shenyu acupoint.

622
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:58,000
Does it hurt?

623
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,870
For this, bear with it for a while.

624
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,300
If you're healthy, it won't hurt.

625
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,310
It's not about pain. It's ticklish.

626
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,920
Enough, Xiao Yicheng.

627
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,680
That's enough.

628
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,410
I'm okay now.

629
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,200
Relax.

630
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,350
Don't argue with me.

631
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:18,510
Trust me.

632
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,120
This is the last time.

633
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,030
Come on.

634
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,030
Relax.

635
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,960
Feeling better?

636
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,350
Not bad.

637
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:58,920
Back then...

638
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:02,800
why did you break up with me?

639
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,240
Let me make this clear.

640
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,550
Don't just make up any excuse.

641
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,880
I want the truth.

642
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:18,970
I just thought you were a good-for-nothing.

643
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,750
I knew you would say that.

644
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,830
You asked Huasheng to make a statement to clarify it.

645
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,310
You used Shen Ping's official account

646
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:30,840
to sway the public opinion.

647
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,000
You even went to several seniors

648
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,750
and begged them.

649
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,800
You think I don't know all that?

650
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,030
Huasheng and Yuyi's

651
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,200
mutual interests are tied together.

652
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,240
It's my duty

653
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:44,680
to help you.

654
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,790
Feng.

655
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,200
Look.

656
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:41,830
What is it?

657
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,310
Lin wouldn't admit it last night.

658
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:43,960
Look.

659
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,920
They sneaked out secretly

660
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,960
to have a date.

661
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,200
They are a couple.

662
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,160
How is it sneaking around?

663
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:55,030
All right.

664
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,790
Sleep in the room!

665
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:58,550
Yes.

666
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,110
Let's go.

667
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,590
She's asleep?

668
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,830
She's asleep.

669
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:53,550
Auntie Feng, if it's not too much trouble,

670
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,960
make us some porridge.

671
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,790
Okay. When it's done,

672
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:57,640
I'll bring it to you.

673
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,570
Okay, thank you.

674
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,310
What's wrong?

675
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:27,970
Mr. Yi and the others still wouldn't attend.

676
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:31,230
Don’t think about that anymore.

677
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,510
I have my own ideas for the press conference.

678
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:34,480
I know.

679
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,680
You want to announce the AI doctor.

680
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,400
But to go from Yuyi's 1.0 version

681
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,880
directly to the 2.0 version

682
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,000
of the AI doctor,

683
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,640
you will lose

684
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,970
a lot of revenue from product iterations.

685
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,640
Why are you laughing?

686
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,590
Tong Xin said

687
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:50,880
the exact same thing.

688
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,070
It's the truth.

689
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,830
Actually,

690
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,480
I wasn't planning

691
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,340
to announce the AI doctor so soon.

692
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:03,450
Then why did you bring me to see it?

693
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:07,910
Visiting Meizhou Island

694
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,880
is something I have to do monthly

695
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,030
to update the AI doctor.

696
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,480
But more importantly,

697
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,880
I wanted you to see it personally

698
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:16,110
and feel it.

699
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,590
I just wanted to tell you

700
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,760
to have confidence in

701
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,190
the entire strategy of Yuyi

702
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,280
and Yuyi 2.0.

703
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Without them,

704
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,199
we can still succeed.

705
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,550
We still have one day.

706
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,040
I won't give up.

707
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,670
What's wrong?

708
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,630
There's a livestream

709
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,590
talking about us now.

710
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:46,670
I've sent you the link.

711
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,230
Okay.

712
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,230
Yuyi passed human translation off

713
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,880
as machine translation?

714
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,630
What were you all thinking?

715
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:02,840
I've seen the content

716
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,030
that Yuyi's AI device

717
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:04,920
translated.

718
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:06,880
In terms of accuracy,

719
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,440
the content is indeed fine,

720
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,110
but it's dry and emotionless.

721
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,190
This kind of wording is not up to the standards

722
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,550
of human translation.

723
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,710
I'll ask Chen Wen to find out who he is.

724
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:17,150
Wait.

725
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,480
Let's put it this way.

726
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,230
Let's hear what he has to say first.

727
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:19,840
As someone

728
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,880
who's studied translation,

729
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,880
I can tell you

730
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,710
clearly

731
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:23,840
that machine translation

732
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,230
can never compare to human translation.

733
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,550
Besides,

734
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:29,760
the idea that Yuyi has passed human translation off

735
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,920
as machine translation

736
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,450
is absolutely ridiculous.

737
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,840
That's all for today's livestream.

738
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,640
See you again.

739
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:41,910
He's quite interesting.

740
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,070
At first, I thought

741
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,230
he wanted to hit us when we're down,

742
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:47,280
but I didn't expect him to help us out.

743
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,210
Was he hired by your PR department?

744
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,320
No.

745
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:57,320
Then could it be some acquaintance

746
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,190
who wants to help you?

747
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:04,280
Let's go back first.

748
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,120
Don't worry too much.

749
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,960
Everything will get better.

750
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,110
Do you think

751
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,590
it's a blessing in disguise?

752
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:35,110
What blessing?

753
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:38,240
I'm blessed with your company.

754
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,920
At least

755
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,340
you're willing to help me.

756
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:47,840
At least you're not

757
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,700
completely shunning me anymore.

758
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:51,440
I'm already very happy.

759
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:28,440
Why are you here?

760
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,590
I was waiting for you here.

761
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:30,670
You've lost weight.

762
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:31,390
I ordered something delicious.

763
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:32,190
Let's go back.

764
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,320
Then we...

765
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,670
What "we"?

766
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:38,000
Go back and rest, Mr. Xiao.

767
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,200
We won't send you off.

768
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,400
Hello, Mr. Mo.

769
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,960
About Yuyi's press conference,

770
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,840
would you reconsider it?

771
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,360
You can't come, right?

772
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,590
Okay.

773
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,320
The subscriber you dialed

774
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,880
is currently unavailable.

775
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,590
Please try again later.

776
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:31,000
What's wrong, Mrs. Gao?

777
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,950
Do you miss me?

778
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,480
You made such a big fuss.

779
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,430
It's hard not to think about you.

780
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,670
I'm fine.

781
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:41,150
Those online stuff are all fake.

782
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:45,070
How are you and Dad recently?

783
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,360
Are you busy?

784
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,230
Are you healthy?

785
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,630
You nag every time you feel guilty.

786
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:58,280
You really are my mother.

787
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,210
I can't hide anything from you.

788
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,630
Successful people are criticized

789
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,710
more than others.

790
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,480
Their criticism

791
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,630
proves your excellence.

792
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:11,550
Got it, Mom.

793
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,480
Okay, I'm hanging up.

794
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:16,320
Wenli.

795
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:18,070
Who were you talking to?

796
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:19,400
Xixi.

797
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,280
Look at you.

798
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,680
You're always like this.

799
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,880
You ended the call with our daughter

800
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,320
before I came back.

801
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,000
I ended the call because the conversation was done.

802
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,800
Come here.

803
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,670
Look at

804
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,110
what I brought you.

805
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:45,070
Where did you get this Classic of Poetry manuscript

806
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,510
translated by Mr. Xu?

807
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,960
I have my ways.

808
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:55,550
You haven't told me

809
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:56,480
what our daughter

810
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,150
said to you.

811
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,430
Does she need our help?

812
00:40:58,430 --> 00:40:59,150
She's fine.

813
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,680
She'll be fine in a few days.

814
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,920
Since she's not with us,

815
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,150
I'm always worried.

816
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,710
Besides, Xixi always

817
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,420
only tells us about good news.

818
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:12,880
Wenli.

819
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,630
It's Professor Gao's 80th birthday.

820
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:17,110
Let's go to Xiahai

821
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:18,440
and join in the fun.

822
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,260
I'm busy at school. I don't have the time.

823
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:23,550
I've asked your principal.

824
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:24,280
He said you're not

825
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,360
a homeroom teacher this semester.

826
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,160
I think you can take two days off.

827
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,590
I said no.

828
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:31,670
I have to be responsible to the students.

829
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:33,070
There's no way I can

830
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:34,530
schedule a trip to Xiahai.

831
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,190
Wenli.

832
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,960
Be honest.

833
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:41,280
It's been so long and you still won't go to Xiahai.

834
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,030
Do you still have a grudge

835
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:45,070
against Professor Gao?

836
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,280
I'm organizing

837
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,590
his 80th birthday.

838
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,440
So what?

839
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,760
I'll give you an out.

840
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,400
Wenli.

841
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,190
Professor Gao has been self-righteous all his life.

842
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:56,920
When has he ever

843
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,230
bowed down to anyone?

844
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:00,760
Why?

845
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:02,590
Now that my dad

846
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:04,190
hired you to run his errands,

847
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,450
you're bowing down?

848
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:07,280
Lin.

849
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:10,310
Back then, my dad didn't approve of you.

850
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:11,230
In order to

851
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,360
break us apart,

852
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:13,480
he even

853
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,610
sacrificed his relationship with me.

854
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,050
If he doesn't apologize to you,

855
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,480
I wouldn't visit him.

856
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:23,800
But at that time,

857
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,670
I was a poor kid indeed.

858
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,160
There's no room for discussion.

859
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:31,070
You are really father and daughter.

860
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:32,470
You are just as stubborn.

861
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:43,480
Mr. Yi.

862
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:44,800
Xixi.

863
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:46,150
We are all attending

864
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:47,480
that press conference.

865
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:48,630
What?

866
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,150
You're all willing to attend?

867
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:52,280
All the mentors are willing to attend?

868
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:54,320
Yes, we're all attending.

869
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,510
Thank you so much.

870
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,960
Thank you.

871
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,670
I'm grateful.

872
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:58,360
You're welcome.

873
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,690
That's all for now then.

874
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:11,760
Chen Wen.

875
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:12,840
The professors

876
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,880
are willing to attend the press conference.

877
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,080
Have the seats ready.

878
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:16,590
Xi, then should we leave a seat

879
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:17,510
for Professor Gao?

880
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:18,630
Leave one for now.

881
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:19,510
Just in case.

882
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:21,150
Okay, I got it.
