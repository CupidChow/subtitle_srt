These two look good.

13
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,430
Looks like the sunlight this year

14
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,310
is quite good.

16
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:28,470
Dad.

00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,390
Let's go.

18
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,190
Okay.

19
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:31,750
Then you...

20
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,710
Okay.

21
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,230
Hurry up.

22
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:39,630
Not bad.

23
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,630
What do you think?

24
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,350
Not bad.

25
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,280
Is your father awesome?

26
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:49,230
Yes.

27
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,430
He's amazing, right?

28
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,110
Did you make it?

29
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,360
Yes, I did.

30
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,790
Who else do you think?

31
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,910
Could it be something that looks good but has poor quality?

32
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:07,790
How could it be?

33
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:08,670
Try it then.

34
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,510
Well...

35
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:12,990
Come on.

36
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,720
Let's see how solid it is first.

37
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,090
Let me bounce on it.

38
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,150
Uncle Lin, look.

39
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,230
It's really good.

40
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:19,800
Harder.

41
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,550
Bounce.

42
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,829
Bounce.

43
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:23,910
Harder.

44
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:25,430
Really.

45
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,670
-It's solid.
-It's really good.

46
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,990
Then it's

47
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,250
barely satisfactory.

48
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:36,320
Let's go.

49
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,030
Peter.

50
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:40,910
Dad,

51
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,930
keep your promise.

52
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:46,950
Uncle,

53
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,110
you can continue to test me.

54
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,150
I will continue to prove myself.

55
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,630
Actually, I truly understand

56
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,790
why you are doing this.

57
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:58,990
Put myself in your shoes.

58
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,470
If I had such a brilliant daughter

59
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,430
like Lin Xi,

60
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,490
I would do the same.

61
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:03,590
I know

62
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,050
how much you love Xixi.

63
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,230
Even if you don't trust me,

64
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,360
I think it's normal.

65
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:09,750
But Uncle,

66
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,280
I want to tell you

67
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,310
this sofa

68
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,590
is not the beginning.

69
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,490
And it won't be the end either.

70
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:26,630
Uncle,

71
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,600
we still have many days ahead.

72
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,470
I will prove myself to you.

73
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,390
Although I still don't understand

74
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,070
why you asked me

75
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,070
to make this sofa,

76
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:36,990
I know

77
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,650
you must have your reasons.

78
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,180
Whether in terms of the experience

79
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,270
or career,

80
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,830
you are my senior.

81
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:47,950
If I can't understand

82
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,350
what a senior wants to teach me,

83
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,550
I would be too stupid.

84
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:06,870
Xiao,

85
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:08,830
I know

86
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,230
you are outstanding in your field.

87
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,310
But the more outstanding you are,

88
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,440
the more worried I am

89
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:16,790
as a father.

90
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:19,830
A man

91
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,630
who has a very successful career

92
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:22,510
might not

93
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,370
make a good husband in the future.

94
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:27,830
I see.

95
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,090
You asked me to make a sofa.

96
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,870
It was actually a test for me.

97
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,260
Sincerity is what matters most.

98
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,150
Sincerity is what matters most.

99
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,430
Well said.

100
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,990
I judge people based on only two qualities:

101
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,270
sincerity

102
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:43,950
and diligence.

103
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,150
Got it.

104
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,150
Dad,

105
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,909
then his performance...

106
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:02,510
Let's go eat.

107
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:04,630
-Thank you, Uncle.
-Alright.

108
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,870
-Let's go inside.
-Let's go eat.

109
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:06,350
Let's go eat now.

110
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,110
Let's go eat.

111
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:07,550
Go, Dear.

112
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,150
Thank you, Uncle.

113
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,680
Let's go.

114
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,590
-Time to eat.
-Go.

115
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:10,070
Okay.

116
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:12,350
Be careful.

117
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,910
You played

118
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,710
the role of a strict father well.

119
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:17,830
Well,

120
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:18,710
it's really tiring

121
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:19,790
to pull a long face

122
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,110
all day long.

123
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,150
Let's go.

124
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,750
-Let's go inside.
-Let's go.

125
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,230
I know.

126
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,430
Okay.

127
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,550
Okay, I got it.

128
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,150
I gotta go.

129
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,790
Auntie, you...

130
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,790
I want to talk to you.

131
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:00,910
Okay.

132
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:09,970
[The Luo River is vast and wide; the noble one arrives at its banks, and fortune and blessings are like luxuriant grass]

133
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,270
It's the Chubuzhen incense.

134
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:30,400
It's a habit of mine when I write Chinese characters.

135
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,630
I think...

136
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,230
it smells familiar.

137
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,990
What you think is right.

138
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,409
It's the same as that used in Professor Gao's house.

139
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:50,030
Come here.

140
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,110
Okay.

141
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,110
Let's get to the point.

142
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,070
Drink.

143
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,910
Are you a little nervous?

144
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,150
A little.

145
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,030
I know...

146
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,130
it's the biggest challenge to convince you.

147
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,400
What makes you say that?

148
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:31,830
Because...

149
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,110
in Lin Xi's heart,

150
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,679
you are very important.

151
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,590
Xiao Yicheng, you know what?

152
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:46,110
I heard about you eight years ago.

153
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,070
I remember

154
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,950
in summer eight years ago,

155
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,070
I called Lin Xi

156
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,550
several times,

157
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,240
but she didn't answer my calls.

158
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,510
I knew something was wrong at that time.

159
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,070
Later, Lin Xi

160
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,910
called me back.

161
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,050
She said her work wasn't going smoothly.

162
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,670
But she cried as she kept talking.

163
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,790
In summer eight years ago,

164
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,910
we broke up.

165
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,830
I've raised my daughter

166
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,310
for so many years.

167
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,590
Before that,

168
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,750
she had never cried

169
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,690
over her studies or job searches.

170
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,410
A mother knows her daughter the best.

171
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,280
From that moment on,

172
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,790
I could already feel

173
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,500
how important you are to her.

174
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,590
Auntie,

175
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,590
actually,

176
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:52,040
she has always been very important

177
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,630
to me.

178
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,270
Do you know Lin Xi's dream

179
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,830
is to work in the United Nations?

180
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:01,910
Yes.

181
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,870
No matter what she wants to do,

182
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,930
I will support her unconditionally.

183
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,190
Will I receive a call

184
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,710
from my daughter and hear her crying

185
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,390
in the middle of a night again?

186
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:16,990
Auntie,

187
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:20,510
actually, I've learned a lot

188
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,800
from making the bamboo sofa this time.

189
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,210
It's not hard to cut bamboo

190
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,990
because it's hollow inside.

191
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,190
But when they are made into a bamboo chair,

192
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,030
it becomes very solid.

193
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,510
Each bend

194
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,030

00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,650
for proofreading.

386
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,290
Is there a problem?

387
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:18,630
Director Lin.

388
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,830
Ms. Lin, you want to see me?

389
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,310
Please help register their fingerprints

390
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,240
in the conference rooms' systems.

391
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:26,150
Okay.

392
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,790
Guys, please come with me.

393
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,230
How's it going?

394
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:37,760
Are you adapting well on your first day there?

395
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,820
Everything is going well.

396
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,390
I'll cook tonight.

397
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:45,650
What do you want to eat?

398
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,670
The Manchu–Han Imperial Feast.

399
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:59,150
Meihua,

400
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:01,390
I have something to discuss with you.

401
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:02,510
My Hua is timid.

402
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,510
It can't do without me.

403
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,270
Tomorrow, can I...

404
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:04,790
No.

405
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,510
Meihua.

406
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,240
How many times have I told you?

407
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,110
I'm pregnant.

408
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,350
I can't touch cats.

409
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,750
I'll put it in a cage.

410
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,670
But its fur will float everywhere.

411
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,390
Do you know

412
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:15,430
how many toxoplasma gondii parasites

413
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:15,990
a cat has?

414
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,790
If something happens to my baby,

415
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,430
will you take responsibility?

416
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,110
Chen,

417
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:21,950
calm down.

418
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:25,210
Be careful not to experience miscarriage-like symptoms.

419
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,190
Mr. Xu,

420
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:27,590
and you.

421
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,150
I...

422
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:30,670
Can you

423
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,470
not light incense indoors?

424
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,430
You said it's very safe,

425
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,150
but I feel very uncomfortable

426
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,350
when I smell it.

427
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,830
Chen,

428
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,000
this...

429
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:41,830
this is the Ersujiuju incense.

430
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,350
The sandalwood and frankincense inside

431
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,790
are good for pregnant women.

432
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:48,390
I...

433
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,190
I...

434
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,790
Fine.

435
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:53,000
If you can't get used to it,

436
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,150
I...

437
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:56,670
Okay.

438
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,630
I'll replace it tomorrow

439
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:01,050
with the Elizhangzhong incense.

440
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,470
Its smell is very fragrant and sweet.

441
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,130
I'm sure you'll get used to it.

442
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:07,590
Ms. Lin.

443
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,920
Please judge who is right and who is wrong.

444
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:11,790
Here's the thing.

445
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:12,550
One

446
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,390
insists on

447
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,030
lighting various types of strange incense in the office.

448
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,070
The other

449
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,550
has always wanted

450
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,210
to bring his cat to the office.

451
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:22,400
Today, I'm gonna show my attitude clearly.

452
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,670
If a cat is coming,

453
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:26,330
I can only apply for a long sick leave.

454
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:29,710
Xi,

455
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:30,910
I've put my pets

456
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:32,230
in a pet hotel.

457
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,550
But Hua is weak.

458
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,210
It won't eat if it can't see me.

459
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,270
I'm old.

460
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,270
Sometimes when I work,

461
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,670
I really...

462
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,230
can't work effortlessly.

463
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,510
These types of ancient incense

464
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:47,910
were recommended

465
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,110
by a professor from a medical school.

466
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,270
They can refresh my mind

467
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,950
and stabilize my emotions.

468
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,670
Ms. Lin,

469
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,440
please say something.

470
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,190
How about... this?

471
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,390
If you have complaints about

472
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,480
or suggestions for Team 3

473
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,130
of the translation department,

474
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,070
write them down.

475
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,030
After that,

476
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:10,270
we'll discuss specific solutions.

477
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:10,870
Okay?

478
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:11,830
Okay.

479
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,200
Okay.

480
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:12,950
Okay.

481
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:28,750
Lin Xi.

482
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:30,880
Why are you here?

483
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,390
When I went downstairs to get my parcel just now,

484
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,510
I saw your parcel,

485
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,710
so I brought it to you.

486
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,070
Help me put it here.

487
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:37,750
Okay.

488
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:39,590
Okay.

489
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:41,350
I'm leaving if there's nothing else.

490
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,030
Bye.

491
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,260
I need to borrow this.

492
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,470
[Air Purifier]

493
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,050
Meihua,

494
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,230
this is an air purifier.

495
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:02,350
I'm gonna put it here and you can use it.

496
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,680
Did you buy this?

497
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,540
Thank you.

498
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:06,310
It's okay.

499
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,190
Well, have you finished

500
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:09,990
writing down your suggestions?

501
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:32,880
Your suggestions are really...

502
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,190
Lin...

503
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:38,430
Ms. Lin,

504
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:40,400
what I wrote is very practical.

505
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,750
Wang from the interpretation department

506
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,910
and Ma from the administrative department are also pregnant.

507
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:45,830
And many colleagues

508
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:46,750
are preparing for pregnancy.

509
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:47,510
So,

510
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,550
I think it's necessary to prepare a mother-and-baby room

511
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:50,990
for pregnant women.

512
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:53,430
Mr. Xu,

513
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:54,830
you need

514
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,690
a translation assistant, right?

515
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,310
Lin Xi,

516
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,270
I...

517
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:00,400
I know

518
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,470
the translation department

519
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:03,800
doesn't have any recruitment quota left.

520
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,710
But considering my age...

521
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:06,950
Well...

522
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,350
Forget it.

523
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:09,590
I don't want to make it difficult for you.

524
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,270
It's okay.

525
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,530
I'll put it away first.

526
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:12,790
Xi,

527
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,070
I'm not gonna ask for much.

528
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:14,950
Just put a cat climbing frame

529
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:15,830
in the office.

530
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:16,750
I'll pay for it.

531
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,790
I asked you to offer work advice.

532
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:22,710
This is my work advice.

533
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:38,930
[Dai Xiaoyang, a world champion and an Olympic player around us, is here]

534
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,000
I thought I would deal with work

535
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,150
on my first day at work.

536
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:40,790
I didn't expect

537
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,250
to handle trivial things.

538
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:46,400
Looks like your new terrain

539
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,020
presents quite a challenge.

540
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:52,990
Before 5 p.m.,

541
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,470
Chen Meihua said

542
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:55,670
her back hurt,

543
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:56,970
so she needed to leave.

544
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:58,070
Ling Feng also said

545
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:00,350
he needed to go to the pet hotel

546
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,550
to pick up his cats.

547
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,280
He also left.

548
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:04,750
Only Mr. Xu, who's over 60 years old,

549
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:05,990
came to ask me

550
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:08,320
if there was anything else he needed to do.

551
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,750
Oh my God.

552
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,470
At that time, I thought

553
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:11,910
if I assigned a task

554
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,230
to Mr. Xu,

555
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:13,950
I would be

556
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,080
bullying an old man.

557
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,400
In martial arts novels,

558
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:21,220
the protagonists usually

559
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,830
face the biggest challenges.

560
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:24,510
Then they will fight their ways out

561
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:26,350
to dominate the martial arts world in the end.

562
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,750
If you can

563
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,480
make them become outstanding,

564
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:30,830
your halo of being the protagonist

565
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,030
will be highlighted.

566
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:43,080
Actually, they are not bad.

567
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:45,550
Ling Feng

568
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,150
is smart.

569
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:49,990
He has obtained

570
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,350
Master's Degrees in both English and Economics.

571
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,110
He also minored in Biology.

572
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:55,590
He's a standard slashie.

573
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,270
Chen Meihua

574
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,990
is methodical and meticulous.

575
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,310
Besides,

576
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:02,590
she is good

577
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:04,090
at economic translation.

578
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,180
Mr. Xu,

579
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,150
needless to say,

580
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,590
is a translation master.

581
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,340
Every year, he attends various meetings

582
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,960
of the translation association

583
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:15,110
and formulates translation standards.

584
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,510
They all are really good.

585
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,510
It sounds like

586
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:21,670
they are like Sweeper Monks, who pretend to be incompetent but are capable actually.

587
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:22,950
It's fine if there is only one Sweeper Monk.

588
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,470
But there are three Sweeper Monks.

589
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:26,550
That means each day would be a mess.

590
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:29,150
Do you need help?

591
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,350
No.

592
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:34,400
After what happened to Chen Wen,

593
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:35,630
I've figured it out.

594
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:37,150
Actually, the KPI

595
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:38,610
is not the most important.

596
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,110
Then you... should know

597
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:43,040
what is the most important, right?

598
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,550
Eating.

599
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,630
I'm starving.

600
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:51,240
What should we eat? I'm hungry too.

601
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:56,890
Please have a seat.

602
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,470
Ms. Lin, congratulations

603
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:04,200
on the smooth first day at work.

604
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:11,790
I made these.

605
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:12,550
Try them.

606
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:26,070
Wei told me

607
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,590
all your bonuses this year have been deducted.

608
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:29,450
You can only get your basic wages.

609
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:31,350
He also said

610
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:33,640
you don't have the habit of saving money

611
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,390
or asking for money

612
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:35,390

613
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:36,870
What's wrong?

614
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:38,870
Do you...

615
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,090
have money to pay the rent?

616
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,110
What exactly are you trying to say?

617
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:48,430
I mean...

618
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,470
you can live in my house.

619
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,630
I can reluctantly take you in.

620
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:53,910
I don't want any rent.

621
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:58,670

622
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:00,550
Yes.

623
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,150
You wish.

624
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,310
So this dinner

625
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:12,720
is a trap.

626
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:14,950
What are you thinking?

627
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:16,950
I mean you can sleep in the bedroom.

628
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:17,950
I can sleep here.

Are you sure?

630
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,510
It depends.

631
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,930
There is room for discussion?

632
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,030
Is there?

633
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:35,790
Just eat.

634
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,170
I was almost tempted by his handsome appearance.

Don't bother.

641
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:04,430
I'll take them to him.

642
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:06,150
I should go see him.

643
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:07,990
His mother has been looking for him,

644
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,910
but he has always ignored her.

645
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:11,960
Then let me drive you there.

646
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,270

Can't I come to see you?

00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:36,870
Well,

how long do you plan

652
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,840
to stay at Ms. Tong's place?

653
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,640
You are neither relatives nor old friends.

654
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,830
It's not good to bother her.

655
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,830
I paid the rent, Grandaunt.

656
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:49,630
Ms. Tong has divorced and has a kid with her.

657
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:52,240
She will have a relationship sooner or later.

658
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,990
If you live with her,

659
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:56,820
it'll be inconvenient for her, right?

660
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,670
She's polite,

661
00:29:58,670 --> 00:29:59,990
so she hasn't said anything.

662
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:02,270
But you should know your place.

663

She doesn't have a boyfriend.

664
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:07,350
Even if she has a boyfriend, why would she tell you?

665
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:09,810
I said she doesn't have a boyfriend. Really.

666
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:12,310
Fine.

667
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:15,140

Yes.

to proofread the French version you translated.

722
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:08,550
A few words in your translation are not accurate enough.

723
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:10,510
Impossible.

725
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,150
The proofreader used this word

726
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:59,750
to replace my original word.

727
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,030

00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,290
consider the context.

768
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:05,150
have different ways of phrasing.

769
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,030
How about this?

770
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,150
We have

771
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,710
a French Chinese colleague.

772
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,020
I'll ask him to take a look first

773
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,390
before you draw a conclusion.

774
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:12,390
What do you think?

775
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:21,030
Of course.

776
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:21,990
Ms. Tong,

777
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,150
I'm sorry for this scene.

778
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:26,330
Let me walk you out.

779
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,540
Why did you

780
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:42,650
have to offend him?

781
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,870
He's famous for being petty.

782
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:45,910
Because

783
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:47,630
this guy is an idiot.

784
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:51,510
If Lin Xi knows

785
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,630
you resign so rashly,

786
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:53,630
she will be angry.

787
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:55,220
That's right.

788
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:56,030
Wang Qiang.

789
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:57,690
This is the audio file.

790
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:58,390
Thank you.

791
00:36:58,390 --> 00:36:59,000
Okay.

792
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:05,990
Ms. Tong

793
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,590
looks aloof.

794
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,950
I didn't expect her to be so kind.

795
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:10,510
She helped us just now.

796
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:13,070
Yao,

797
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:15,990
I'm gonna be frank with you.

798
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:17,350
Don't resign, okay?

799
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:18,320
Otherwise,

800
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,920
I'll be alone in the company.

801
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:21,870
It would be so miserable.

802
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,350
It's better to offend a gentleman

803
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:40,810
than to offend a petty man.

804
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:43,670
I don't care.

805
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:46,550
Even though you don't care about your job

806
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:47,910
in Huasheng,

807
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,270
it will be bad for your future development

808
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:51,870
if Lu Keli wants to smear you,

809
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:52,950
since the translation industry

810
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:53,990
is so small.

811
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:56,510
He won't be able to be arrogant for too long.

812
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:58,990
Lin Xi will make a comeback soon.

813
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:02,190
Do you trust her that much?

814
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,150
Of course.

815
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:05,640
There is no doubt that she is very capable.

816
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:08,590
You're right.

817
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,230
Please take a look at the details of the contract.

818
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:13,470
We have preferential policies

819
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:14,630
for old tenants.

820
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:16,910
Mr. Zhou,

821
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:18,630
if I pay annually,

822
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,760
is there a discount?

823
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:20,510
Yes.

824
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:23,830
If you pay annually,

825
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:24,920
you can get a 5% discount on the agreed-upon price.

826
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,510
Okay.

827
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:30,980
Mom, look.

828
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,350
Cheng Yao is amazing.

829
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:33,670
It's a heart shape.

830
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:39,790
I'm learning food plating from the Internet.

831
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,520
Have you washed your hands?

832
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,310
Try some.

833
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:53,840
The oranges are very sweet.

834
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,310
Mr. Zhou, try some.

835
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,190
Thank you, Ms. Tong.

836
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:57,830
Thank you.

837
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,230
Do you plan to move out?

838
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:16,190
Don't move out.

839
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:16,950
If you leave,

840
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:18,920
I'll have no one to play games with me.

841
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,310
Cheng Yao has recovered.

842
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:22,510
He's going back to live in his own house.

843
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:25,440
Godfather has left.

844
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:26,630
You want to leave too.

845
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,270
No one will play with Peter.

846
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,470
If you want me to play with you...

847
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:32,110
Peter,

848
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:33,710
you can't be so wilful.

849
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:38,150
Ms. Tong,

850
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,670
this house...

851
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:41,710
Get me a smaller one.

852
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:42,880
I can sign it now.

853
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:43,790
Okay.

854
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,270
Okay, thank you.

855
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,030
What's wrong?

856
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,510
Yao,

857
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,530
you are calling me at this hour.

858
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:25,630
Do you miss me?

859
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:27,110
I have something to talk to you.

860
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:28,170
Lend me some money.

861
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,350
Again?

862
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:31,870
I want to rent a house.

863
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:32,830
Okay.

864
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:19,390
Come on.

865
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:20,190
Let me tell you

866
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:21,550
about the follow-up arrangements.

867
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:22,500
Wang Qiang and Cheng Yao,

868
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,230
you continue to follow up

869
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,290
on Yuyi's project.

870
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:25,790
Shasha, you stay in the department,

871
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:26,550
sort out the other projects,

872
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,030
and make a schedule.

873
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:29,190
In the afternoon,

874
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:30,470
I'll go to Nanjing

875
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:31,750
to talk about the future cooperation

876
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:32,960
with Zhu Haiqiong, a pickle master.

877
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,290
I heard Mr. Xiao helped make connections.

878
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:37,030
If Zhu Haiqiong

879
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:38,870
can buy the 6,000 tons of daikon radishes,

880
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:41,330
we can make the American company satisfied.

881
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:44,770
How many days will it take?

882
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:45,910
Three days.

883
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:53,310
What's wrong?

884
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:55,270
I...

885
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:57,830
If there's nothing else,

886
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:58,760
get back to work.

887
00:41:58,830 --> 00:41:59,440
Okay?

888
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:00,630
Cheng Yao.

889
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:01,320
Here.

890
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:03,630
In this document,

891
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:04,510
I'm still not sure

892
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:05,510
about some words.

893
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:06,510
How should I translate these words

894
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:07,790
to make the translation better?

895
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:08,850
Help me take a look.

896
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,440
Let me take a look.

897
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:20,590
Qiang,

898
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:23,110
this is a constellation mystery box.

899
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:24,070
Yes.

900
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:25,190
I tried seven or eight times

901
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:26,030
to get this.

902
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:28,250
Your zodiac sign is Libra too?

903
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:28,910
Yes.

904
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:30,230
Mine too.

905
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:31,360
What a coincidence.

906
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:33,450
So your birthday is in this month too?

907
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,720
My birthday is on October 3.

908
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:37,670
When is your birthday?

909
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:38,910
I feel this one and this one

910
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:40,230
are still not right.

911
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:45,710
I think the words used here

912
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:47,110
are not accurate enough.

913
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:48,710
Shasha?

914
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:53,000
Shasha,

915
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:55,170
when is your birthday?

916
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:01,070
W-What's wrong?

[Pantry]

918
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:12,910
Shasha,

919
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:15,280
I have to go to the airport now.

920
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,390
Send me an email

921
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:17,140
after you finish making the project schedule.

922
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:17,870
Okay.

923
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:19,190
Tian,

924
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:20,870
actually...

925
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:27,510
There is no time.

926
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:28,270
I have to go.

927
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:29,670
Call me if anything happens.

928
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:31,670
Then... take good care of yourself.
