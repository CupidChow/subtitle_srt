in gossip at all.

11
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,150
Me neither.

This is our order?

00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:02,830
Spicy boiled fish.

14
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,390
Are you kidding?

15
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,430
Who makes spicy boiled fish

16
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:06,710
without hot chili sauce?

17
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,139
That gentleman

18
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,840
specifically asked me to remove spiciness.

19
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,270
Mr. Xiao,

20
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,170
you don't eat spicy food?

21
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,870
Why didn't I know?

22
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,630
Do I need to report to you that I don't eat spicy food?

23
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,320
Right.

24
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,510
Mr. Xiao, I remember you don't eat spicy food.

25
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:23,930
You don't eat spicy food?

26
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,950
I think this bobo chicken

27
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:26,910
is quite spicy,

28
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,270
but Mr. Xiao ate a lot.

29
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:35,840
I ate it.

30
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,670

35
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,430
That's right.

36
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:46,880
Got it.

37
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,710
Lin Xi, you use tea instead of wine

38

make your ex misunderstand?

94
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:02,870

Are you done?

98
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,600
Do you have to hide it even from me?

99
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:13,550
I...

100
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:14,470
I'll go pack

101
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,830

115
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,670
He wanted to drink it.

116
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,909

118

What?

120
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:46,560
Eight years ago,

121
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:47,710
you broke up with him because you thought

122
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:48,470
he wasn't successful.

123
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,110
This question was repeated 800 times.

124
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,020
Is this fun?

125
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,550
Is a lie repeated 800 times

126
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:56,370
interesting?

127
00:05:58,409 --> 00:06:00,060
Before I joined the army in my third year of university,

128
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,880
you two were so close

129
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:01,950
that you were like one person.

you're not that kind of person.

135

What is the true reason?

136
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,270
I admit

137
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,390
we loved each other,

138
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,070
but in the two years

139
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,350
of dating him,

140
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,630
he was always lazy, gluttonous, and dull.

141
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,070
Being with him,

142
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,670
I could see the end at a glance.

143
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,910
Why wouldn't I break up with

144
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:26,790
someone like him?

145
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,870
You're so stubborn.

146
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:31,990

147
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,350
Stop it. It's not funny.

149

What?

150
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,070
Don't scare me.

151
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,070
Even if he is here,

152
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,750
I would say the same.

153
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,790
Didn't you see

154
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,000
how petty he was earlier?

155
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,620
Right?

158
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,430
He's always been so petty

159
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:56,270
and pretentious.

160
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,400
I told you before.

161
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,510
Wei.

162
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,400
It's been eight years.

163

How have you been?

164
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,860
Why are you still here?

165
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:07,600
My son wants to eat osmanthus cake.

166
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,150
I heard just now

167
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,970
that someone said I'm lazy, gluttonous, and dull.

168
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,300
She was talking about me.

169
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:15,450
She said

170
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,430
I have to learn from you.

171
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,190
Yeah.

172
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,750
Look at Mr. Xiao.

173
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:22,950
He has a successful career

174
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:23,870
and a happy family now.

175
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,540
He's practically a winner in life.

176
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,650
It seems that

177
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,510
I should thank you

178
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,230
for not marrying me back then.

179
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,270
Let's drink some other day.

180
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,110
Okay.

[Sea Butterfly Cuisine]

182
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,520
The way you talk

183
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,670
really hurts you.

184
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,070
What's wrong?

185
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,630
He's a nobody

186
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,470
to me now.

187
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:02,420
After tonight,

188
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:03,250
we won't have any interactions

189

190
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,240
Let's go. I'll send you back.

191
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,670
Take Shasha home.

192
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,030
I'll go back alone.

193
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:17,870
Okay.

194
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:38,510
There's bottled water in the back.

195
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:39,730
Take it if you're thirsty.

196
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:41,740
No thanks.

197
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,400
Thank you.

198
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:45,950
You are Lin Xi's cousin?

199
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,650
She never mentioned you before.

200
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,830
We haven't met

201
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,090
since I was twelve.

202
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,670
Here...

203
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,240
This is an old scar.

204
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,390
Does it scare you?

205
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,270
Did it hurt?

206
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,630
I couldn't worry about the pain at the time.

207
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,390
A bunch of students

208
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,680
went on a graduation trip.

209
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:17,120
Half of them went into the mountain

210
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,080
and didn't come out.

211
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,270
After they were all rescued,

212
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,170
I realized

213
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:22,730
that I had such a big wound.

214
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,950
They must be grateful to you.

215
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,630
They will never forget you.

216
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,450
I just hope these people

217
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:31,800
won't mess around

218
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,440
and trouble others in the future.

219
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,870
Thank you.

220
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,950
It's nothing.

221
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,730
Does he really not remember me?

222
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,470
Hello, Mr. Xiao.

223
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:07,990
Nice to meet you.

224
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,390
Instead of drinking at dinner,

225
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,030
you come back and drink secretly?

226
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,070
You want to talk?

227
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,790
Why talk about work

228
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,590
in the middle of the night?

229
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:09,790
Not about work.

230
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:12,670
Let's talk about your ex-girlfriend.

231
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,070
Why did you two break up?

232
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,390
Why we broke up?

233
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,780
I said I don't agree.

234
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,660
It's been three years.

235
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,620
I've always wanted you to change

236
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,140
and make progress.

237
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,480
I hoped you could

238
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,240
get into Matisse Institute of Technology,

239
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,220
instead of

240
00:12:59,250 --> 00:12:59,930
a random school.

241
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,300
Kenpardy is good.

242
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,990
It's very good.

243
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,150
I don't want to say anything else.

244
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,550
I can't see any hope in you.

245
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:22,840
Xi,

246
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:26,760
it’s been three years.

247
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,550
A three-year relationship

248
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,990
can't compare with my level of education, right?

249
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,170
Correct.

250
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,970
♫Love remembers♫

251
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,120
♫It finds you and I again♫

252
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:46,020
♫The breeze brushes past the sunset♫

253
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,570
♫You look at me♫

254
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:51,220
♫Until the shadows melt into the galaxy♫

255
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,460
♫I'll hold your hand again♫

256
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:57,300
♫Gazing into each other's eyes♫

257
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:01,340
♫Happiness is that I now have♫

258
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:08,070
♫A future with you♫

259
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,630
If I remember correctly,

260
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,610
you graduated from Haijiang University, right?

261
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:16,550
She looked down on

262
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,910
a top student from Haijiang

263
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,230
for being unsuccessful?

264
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,630
Back then, she wanted me to get into Matisse,

265
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,950
but I only got

266
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,060
Kenpardy's offer.

267
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,510
Kenpardy is a bit smaller,

268
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,440
but its ranking is very close to Mattise's.

269
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,390
Besides, they have their own academic focuses.

270
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:35,780
They're both top schools.

271
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,570
Lin Xi must know that.

272
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,470
Are you sure she broke up with you

273
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:41,570
because of this?

274
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,720
It's ridiculous, right?

275
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,590
But it's realistic.

276
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,470
I still can't believe it.

277
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,710
Lin Xi has always been

278
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,250
obsessed with success.

279
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,530
If you don't reach her expectations,

280
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,420
you'll be abandoned ruthlessly.

281
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,070
So, you came back this time

282
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,280
to take revenge on her?

283
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,150
Go to bed early.

284
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:19,830
Don't drink too much.

285
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:46,670
Grandma, you're still up?

286
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,670
Old people don't sleep much,

287
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,500
but why are you still up?

288
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,110
Great timing.

289
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,050
I have a bit of translation

290
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,160
that I need your help with.

291
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:01,710
As an impromptu reaction,

292
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,160
your translation isn't too bad.

293
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,090
Not too bad?

294
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:12,940
If you translated the second half as,

295
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,450
"A gentleman

296
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:18,670
should carry goods with great virtue,

297
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,100
just like

298
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,960
the earth bears everything on it,"

299
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,370
would that be better?

300
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,910
Why didn't I think of that?

301
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,790
If I translated it

302
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:30,590
like this at the time,

303
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,830
it would've been perfect.

304
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:33,330
You regret it?

305
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:36,470
You are just like your grandpa.

306
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,750
You are always too strict on yourself.

307
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,550
I'm not like him.

308
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,390
My mom and I are

309
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:45,380
the losers of the family.

310
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,310
I can't compare with

311
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,270
how highly respected

312
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,310
Professor Gao is.

313
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,270
In ancient times,

314
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,710
I wouldn't even be able to be put in

315
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:53,590
the ancestral hall after I died.

316
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:55,790
See? The way you talk is the same.

317
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,180
You're so unreasonable and unforgiving.

318
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:59,640
You have to understand your grandpa.

319
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,610
Your mom was so excellent back then.

320
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,310
Your grandpa hoped for her

321
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,869
to inherit his position.

322
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:08,920
In the end, she got snatched away by your dad.

323
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,690
Actually, I don't think

324
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,490
you have to be an interpreter

325
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,700
in order to succeed in life.

326
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,300
Look at my mom now.

327
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,310
She has so many students.

328
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,190
It's great.

329
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,250
Then why do you want to

330
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,720
become an interpreter

331
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,349
and go to the UN?

332
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,630
I...

333
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,230
I'm sleepy.

334
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,150
Sleep early.

335
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,710
Good night, Grandma Li.

336
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:34,270
Okay, go ahead.

337
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:46,470
What are you looking at?

338
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,590
You've never seen a pretty girl before?

339
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:50,990
Sleep.

340
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,480
I'll give you one for free.

341
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:06,270
Call me if you find it useful.

342
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,030
Okay, thank you.

343
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,470
Excuse me.

344
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,390
Excuse me,

345
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:11,030
do you need facial masks?

346
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,160
Let me give you a recommendation.

347
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:14,310
This is a tea tree black mask.

348
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,030
It can absorb the oil on your face

349
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,750
and dissolve blackheads.

350
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,060
You'll get an effect with five pieces and it'll be reinforced with 10.

351
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,990
Twenty pieces will keep you safe from blackheads forever.

352
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,510
You are...

353
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,950
Are you selling facial masks?

354
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:30,640
I study and work part-time.

355
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:31,380
Do you need it?

356
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,590
Yes.

357
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:33,630
How much do you want?

358
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,270
I want them all.

359
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,040
All of them?

360
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,830
I only have two boxes left.

361
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,400
Here you go.

362
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,160
It was supposed to be 60 yuan.

363
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,180
I'll give you a discount. It'll be 50.

364
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:41,810
Okay.

365
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:48,720
Fifty.

366
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:49,850
Here.

367
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:50,720
Thank you.

368
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:52,670
Excuse me.

369
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:54,780
Well...

370
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,220
How can I contact you?

371
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,590
I mean,

372
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:00,690
if I find it useful,

373
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,640
I have to contact you,

374
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,420
right?

375
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:07,350
Here.

376
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,470
I'm an English major from Xiamei University.

377
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,290
My name is Lin Xi.

378
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:15,950
Call me if you need me.

379
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:16,510
Bye.

380
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,110
My name is Xiao Yicheng.

381
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:20,300
I'm a computer major from Haijiang University.

382
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:22,500
Bye.

383
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,570

that the latest version of the TLA Translator

420
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:02,550
so they proposed

421
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:03,790
the concept of 0.5 seconds.

575
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:09,970
was translated by my colleague.

576
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,670
Can you tell me which one is better?

577
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:14,240
The sky is healthy

578
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:18,710
and the gentleman strives for perseverance.

579
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,470
The terrain is kun

580
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:23,030
and the gentleman carries things with virtue.

581
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:34,580
I think the translation

582
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,910
of the second part is better.

583
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,230
Why?

584
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:41,510
In Mr. Yan Fu's translation

585
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:43,240
of Evolution and Ethics,

586
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,800
he proposed

587
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:46,590
the three basic standards of translation,

588
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:50,030
which are faithfulness, expressiveness, and elegance.

589
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,670
What he meant

590
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:52,570
was that

591
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:54,380
translations must be accurate,

592
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,030
documentary,

593
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,150
and it should be coherent.

594
00:27:58,170 --> 00:27:59,410
The diction should be elegant.

595
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:00,670
This way, you can express

596
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:02,110
the work's

597
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,070
full meaning.

598
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:05,150
Look.

599
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,710
Your translation

600
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:09,290
only reached the level of faithfulness.

601
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:11,030
Look at this word.

602
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,420
Perseverance.

603
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:16,190
Look at your colleague's translation.

604
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,510
Self-improvement.

605
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,910
She has reached

606
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,100
the second level.

607
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:25,020
What's your colleague's name?

608
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,150
Lin Xi.

609
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,640
Xi?

610
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:37,910
She still has a lot of

611
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:39,190
room for improvement.

612
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:43,550
Grandpa, I’m going to work.

613
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,350
You can do it, honey.

614
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,440
[The sky is healthy and the gentleman strives for perseverance. The terrain is kun and the gentleman carries things with virtue.]

615
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:05,950
[The sky is healthy and the gentleman strives for perseverance. The terrain is kun and the gentleman carries things with virtue.]

616
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,110
Revise this.

617
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,270
Okay, I'll do it right now.

618
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:23,790
Go help him.

619
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,810
Help me.

620
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,630
If the project with Huasheng

621
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:32,790
exceeds a certain amount of money,

622
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:33,830
it will be put into

623
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:34,910
our priority client management department.

624
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,550
There are also some famous

625
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,430
and well-known companies

626
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:39,350
that we're in charge of year-round.

627
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:40,680
But translations

628
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,340
involve many languages,

629
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:44,180
including minor languages.

630
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:45,790
Can the priority client management department

631
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,000
manage everything?

632
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,710
Of course.

633
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,830
First of all, the members

634
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,510
of our department are all well-rounded experts

635
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:54,030
who can do translations and interpretations.

636
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,470
Secondly,

637
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:57,310
if we really are short-handed,

638
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,150
or clients have a high demand,

639
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,440
we can also

640
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,550
cooperate with other departments.

641
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:03,670
In other words,

642
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:04,710
our department

643
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:06,350
is like the special operations team

644
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:07,640
of the whole company.

645
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:09,860
Who's free now?

646
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,110
Please translate this document

647
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:11,870
from Enjiu Medicine.

648
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,350
Tian,

649
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,950
is this document urgent?

650
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:18,410
Within two days.

651
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,870
But everyone

652
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:23,740
seems to be working on things.

653
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:24,490
How about this?

654
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,720
Go ask the translation department

655
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,390
and see if they can

656
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:27,510
send someone here.

657
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:28,780
The translation department?

658
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,590
Mr. Xu needs more than a week

659
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,390
to translate documents.

660
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:35,550
If you give him two days,

661
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,110
he'll scold you.

662
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:40,780
Tian, what should we do?

663
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:41,780
How about...

664
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,770
I'll try.

665
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,430
Can I?

666
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,260
I think so.

667
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,590
My daddy is a medical professor

668
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:49,710
abroad,

669
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:50,870
so I've touched on

670
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:51,630
uncommon professional terms.

671
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:53,030
since I was a kid.

672
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,750
Trust me. I can do it.

673
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,750
Great.

674
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:05,230
Looks like Shasha

675
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,380
is a great addition

676
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,190
to the special operations team.

677
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,920
Let's go. I'll take you there.

678
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,870
Stop using your phone all the time.

679
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:29,500
It's about work.

680
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:31,200
It's impolite.

681
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:40,390
Okay, thank you. Here.

682
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:41,060
Have some water.

683
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:43,710
Auntie,

684
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,470
has Professor Gao not come down yet?

685
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,660
He should be here soon.

686
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,230
Drink some first.

687
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,610
Okay, thank you.

688
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:52,360
Do you want me to check again?

689
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:53,280
No need.

690
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,470
No hurry.

691
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:55,470
Don't rush him.

692
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:55,960
Okay.

693
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:00,470
Mr. Xiao,

694
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,590
since you said

695
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:02,870
this translation system

696
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:04,350
is not inferior to machine translation,

697
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:05,990
then what is the definition

698
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:06,720
of "not inferior"?

699
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:08,830
Can we have the honor of witnessing

700
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,510
a battle between

701
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,590
a human and machine translator?

702
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:12,550
Of course.

703
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:14,630
Sitting inside

704
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:16,350
the simultaneous interpretation room

705
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:17,590
right now

706
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:19,960
is Lin Xi, the chief interpreter

707
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,950
of China's top translation company,

708
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:23,550
Huasheng.

709
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:25,230
Ms. Lin Xi.

710
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:27,150
are you ready

711
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:28,190
for this small battle?

712
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:29,430
[New Tech Forces]

713
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,750
Director Sun,

714
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:32,590
there is no such part

715
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:33,830
in our agenda.

716
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:34,950
Ms. Chen requested

717
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:36,810
to add it in this morning.

718
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:38,310
Ms. Chen is not only

719
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,510
the host of our program,

720
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:41,520
but also the producer of this show.

721
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:42,150
So...

722
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:43,510
So, we request to pause

723
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:44,470
and review the process again.

724
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:45,070
Ms. Tong,

725
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,300
this is a livestream.

726
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,280
We'll improve

727
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,740
our intelligence system holistically.

728
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,920
[New Tech Forces]

729
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,110
Mr. Xiao,

730
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,260
Yuyi's press conference

731
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,350
had a segment

732
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,670
about a battle between

733
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:05,390
machine and human translation,

734
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,750
but the result was uncertain.

735
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:07,820
Today,

736
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,030
can you give us

737
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,510
a definite result?

738
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:14,670
An uncertain result

739
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:17,590
may just be temporary.

740
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,580
The human translator

741
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,190
will lose all battles

742
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:22,230
in the future.

743
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:24,990
This kind of battle

744
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:26,430
might not even exist in the future.

745
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,560
It's only a matter of time

746
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,740
before machine translation replaces humans.

747
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:33,590
Mr. Xiao,

748
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,440
can I interpret your words as

749
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:37,190
you challenging the translation industry

750
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:38,990
by yourself?

751
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:42,270
The development of technology

752
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,710
can't be achieved

753
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:44,670
by myself,

754
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,350
but I'm definitely happy to

755
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:48,670
push machine translation

756
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,070
to replace human translation.

757
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,680
I believe

758
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:53,930
that with my help,

759
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,320
it won't take long.

760
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:58,710
Many CEOs

761
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:00,050
talk big in interviews

762
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,240
with our New Tech Forces,

763
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,780
but to be frank,

764
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,510
few of them

765
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:05,740
can really make it.

766
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,790
In fact, translating words

767
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:20,870
is no big deal.

768
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,070
You're here.

769
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:38,590
Professor Gao.

770
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:39,270
Have a seat.

771
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:40,730
Have a seat.

772
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,280
Professor Gao.

773
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:49,300
This is the ant wine

774
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:51,199
that Wenli asked me to bring you.

775
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,020
She said

776
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,440
this is very effective against rheumatism.

777
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,880
A doctor has already checked

778
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,350
my rheumatism.

779
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,290
He told me not to eat any supplements.

780
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,660
They say this folk prescription is very good.

781
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,950
Why don't you try it?

782
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:08,350
I appreciate the offer.

783
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:11,120
You don't have to try.

784
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:11,910
Then,

785
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,460
you can give it to a friend.

786
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:19,040
Flatterer.

787
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:21,640
What?

788
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,220
What did you say?

789
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:27,390
I'm not talking about you two.

790
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:29,310
I have a colleague

791
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:30,830
who likes to kiss up to others

792
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:31,830
and always pick on me.

793
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,910
Then you should reflect on

794
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,790
why they always pick on you.

795
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,820
I've reflected already.

796
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,510
It's because I'm too good

797
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:40,420
and they're jealous of me.

798
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:42,110
After all,

799
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:43,590
I'm always the excellent interpreter of the year.

800
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:44,950
I'm also the one who gets a promotions and raises.

801
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:47,460
Professor Gao,

802
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:48,530
look at her...

803
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:50,900
Yuyi always believes in

804
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:52,520
the unity of knowledge and action.

805
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:53,540
I wonder

806
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,440
if you agree with my view

807
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:57,050
after seeing our presentation.

808
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:59,950
It doesn't matter whether I agree or not.

809
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,870
What I'm curious about is

810
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:03,850
what the traditional translation industry

811
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,980
will think of Mr. Xiao's view.

812
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,980
The director will connect us later.

813
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,240
Who else are you going to connect with?

814
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,470
Lin Xi.

815
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,450
Ms. Tong,

816
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,750
Ms. Chen also added this part

817
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,150
last-minute.

818
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:23,050
You...

819
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,430
Excuse me, I need to take this call.

820
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,120
Professor Gao,

821
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,600
Xi always put her work

822
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:33,660
first.

823
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:35,070
Please don't mind her.

824
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,150
Hello.

825
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:50,510
Director Lin.

826
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,180
Can you hear me?

827
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:54,470
Yes, very clearly.

828
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:56,680
Let me explain to the audience.

829
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,900
Our guest today

830
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:01,340
is the interpreter who participated in the battle

831
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:02,450
with Yuyi's translator last night.

832
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,120
She is the director of Huasheng's priority client management department,

833
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,120
Lin Xi.

834
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:09,310
Director Lin, how have you been?

835
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:14,150
Director Lin,

836
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:16,350
Mr. Xiao Yicheng said

837
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:17,520
that machine translation

838
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:20,020
will soon replace human translation.

839
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:21,990
What do you think?

840
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,040
I beg to differ.

841
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:26,830
Even if a machine

842
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:28,410
understands every word,

843
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:30,180
there are still three mountains

844
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,370
that artificial intelligence translation

845
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,240
can't overcome.

846
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,180
Can you tell us

847
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,250
in detail?

848
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:36,390
First is polysemes.

849
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,910
For example,

850
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,270
the basic meaning

851
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:40,810
of the word "mission"

852
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,880
is an important task

853
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,050
given to an individual

854
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,510
or a group of people.

855
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,080
This usually requires

856
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,700
one to travel abroad to complete it.

857
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:49,290
On this basis,

858
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:50,690
it can also lead to words

859
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,470
such as envoy, mission, delegation,

860
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:54,480
[Yuyi Technology Limited]

861
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:55,590
business trip, task,

862
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:57,330
special envoy, missionary,

863
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,330
and other specific meanings.

864
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,930
The translator needs to

865
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,320
use context clues

866
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,620
to determine

867
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:05,650
whether it should be translated as mission or delegation,

868
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,000
missionary or special envoy.

869
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:08,910
This judgment

870
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,370
isn't clearly seen.

871
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,910
If we give this translation

872
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:13,070
to the machine,

873
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:16,030
they will use the probability

874
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:17,390
from calculations

875
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,560
to translate the most common meaning.

876
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,110
It will often make mistakes.

877
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:21,980
Ms. Lin,

878
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,500
don't forget

879
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:25,830
that artificial intelligence is not a robot.

880
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:27,590
It's able to learn.

881
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,200
As the algorithm

882
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:30,710
continuously improves,

883
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:32,580
an accurate choice for polysemes

884
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,650
will be a piece of cake.

885
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:34,940
Second,

886
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:36,970
the complicated structure of sentences.

887
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:37,980
Of course,

888
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:39,810
from Mr. Xiao's point of view,

889
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:40,990
you can also use the algorithm

890
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:41,860
to defend yourself.

891
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:44,030
Personally,

892
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,760
the most difficult thing for machine translation

893
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,410
is the third mountain.

894
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:50,020
No matter how smart it is,

895
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:52,550
machines don't have the warmth of a human.

896
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,500
Ms. Chen,

897
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,490
you know Mr. Shi Linke, right?

898
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:58,370
Of course.

899
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,570
He was the top figure in the dubbing industry.

900
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:01,990
Unfortunately, he passed away

901
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:03,970
from a car accident five years ago.

902
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:04,790
Yes.

903
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:08,010
Three years after his death,

904
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,190
a documentary director

905
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:10,410
came to our team.

906
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,920
They were producing

907
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,440
an epic documentary.

908
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:14,830
After trying

909
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:16,190
the voices of many dubbers,

910
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,420
they still believed

911
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:19,100
that Mr. Shi Linke's voice

912
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:20,050
suited the film best.

913
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:21,510
But Mr. Shi

914
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:22,310
had already passed away.

915
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:22,930
That's right,

916
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:24,670
but Yuyi

917
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:26,350
used the algorithm technology

918
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:27,320
of artificial intelligence

919
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:28,630
to collect

920
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:30,700
materials of Mr. Shi's voice when he was alive.

921
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:33,070
Finally, we replicated his voice

922
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:35,070
and successfully dubbed the documentary.

923
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:37,110
We also used the characteristics

924
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,830
of Mr. Shi's voice

925
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:41,430
and developed versions for seven languages.

926
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:44,070
Which interpreter

927
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:45,630
can fight one against seven?

928
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:50,070
Now, this documentary

929
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:51,370
and that familiar voice

930
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,440
can forever accompany his family

931
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,470
and the listeners who like him.

932
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,070
Director Lin,

933
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,790
the view that technology has no warmth.

934
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:02,210
is outdated.

935
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,780
The height and depth

936
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:05,650
that technology can reach

937
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,130
is far beyond your imagination.

938
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,150
Letting machines speak,

939
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,630
letting machines say anyone's words,

940
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,270
and letting machines say any words

941
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:20,150
from anyone

942
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:21,870
is the reason why I created

943
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:22,830
Yuyi.

944
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:24,550
Mr. Xiao,

945
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:26,690
you said that machine translation

946
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:28,620
will completely replace human translation.

947
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,610
When will

948
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,030
this moment come?

949
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:34,670
Director Lin,

950
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:35,870
what do you think?

951
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,130
I hope I can see it in my lifetime.

952
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,240
Trust me.

953
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,280
This day will come soon.

954
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,080
Professor Gao,

955
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:58,190
the organic cherries

956
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:59,030
we planted

957
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:00,270
will be harvested soon.

958
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:01,190
By then,

959
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,590
I'll bring you some more.

960
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,840
No need.

961
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:04,910
I only have one stomach.

962
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:05,900
I can't eat it all.

963
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,640
I couldn't finish what you brought before

964
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,490
and they went bad.

965
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:11,840
It's my fault.

966
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:13,500
I wasn't considerate enough.

967
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:14,300
Fine.

968
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,070
Next time,

969
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:16,230
I'll bring you less

970
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,290
to try.

971
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:19,350
But now,

972
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,580
fruits that are in season

973
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:21,960
are very nutritious.

974
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,290
Right, Xi?

975
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,190
My dad's fruits

976
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,420
are all organic.

977
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,090
Eat more fruits. It's good for your health.

978
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:33,780
Then, don't bring too much.

979
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:37,740
Professor Gao, the yanpi dumplings are ready.

980
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,340
Xi and Xi's dad,

981
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,650
come and have some while it's hot.

982
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,280
Okay.

983
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,070
We won't be eating here.

984
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,310
Why not?

985
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:44,890
When you were young,

986
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:46,400
didn't you love eating yanpi?

987
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:47,120
Yes.

988
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:49,860
It's not convenient.

989
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:54,790
I'm going to taichi class.

990
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:56,990
Don't you attend taichi class

991
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:57,770
on Monday, Wednesday and Friday?

992
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,870
Today is Tuesday.

993
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,940
If I say I have class, then I have it.

994
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:01,990
I changed it.

995
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:04,190
Did I remember it wrongly?

996
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,490
No,

997
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,510
we were wrong to come.

998
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:08,210
Xi, watch your mouth.

999
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,440
In translation,

1000
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,800
the interpreter is the master.

1001
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:14,010
The machine is the servant.

1002
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:16,190
Follow faithfulness, expressiveness, and elegance.

1003
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:17,920
Remove the bad and keep the good.

1004
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:19,510
Only this way

1005
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,910
can the value and charm of an interpreter be shown.

1006
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:28,020
Professor Gao.

1007
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:34,070
Xi, go eat.

1008
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,680
Professor Gao still cares about you.

1009
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:38,360
He knew you were coming today,

1010
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:40,130
so he asked me to make yanpi.

1011
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:41,870
No way.

1012
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,000
Also,

1013
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,780
he rewatched that translator press conference

1014
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:47,130
you attended

1015
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:49,510
three times.

1016
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:55,190
It's been a long time since I've had your yanpi.

1017
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:56,370
I must eat it well later.

1018
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:57,660
Look at you.

1019
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,550
If you talk to your grandpa so sweetly too,

1020
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:00,710
he wouldn't be so indifferent

1021
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:02,530
toward you.

1022
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:04,510
Not necessarily.

1023
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,390
Look at my dad.

1024
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,180
He's been acting enthusiastic

1025
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,400
for 30 years

1026
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:10,280
and it's still useless.

1027
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:12,170
All right, go eat.

1028
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,200
The food will get cold soon.

1029
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:13,980
Let's go.

1030
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:15,070
Let's go.

1031
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:25,910
Professor Gao.

1032
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:29,670
Professor Gao.

1033
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:35,810
Your 80th birthday

1034
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,510
is in half a year.

1035
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:39,170
Wenli said

1036
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:40,830
she wants to give you a proper celebration.

1037
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:42,510
Do you think we...

1038
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,230
It's a miracle she remembers.

1039
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:46,800
It's still early.

1040
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:47,810
We still have time.

1041
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,070
No, Professor Gao,

1042
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:51,110
an 80-year-old birthday banquet

1043
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:52,070
is a big deal.

1044
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:52,960
See,

1045
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,520
choosing the venue, the agenda,

1046
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:55,780
and inviting guests

1047
00:43:55,810 --> 00:43:56,540
to attend

1048
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,800
all take time.

1049
00:43:58,190 --> 00:43:59,940
Would you like it to be Chinese style

1050
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:01,580
or western style?

1051
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:06,390
We'll see.

1052
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:11,510
Don't worry.

1053
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:13,230
We'll do it well for you.
