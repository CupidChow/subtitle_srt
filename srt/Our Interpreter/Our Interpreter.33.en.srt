Mr. Xiao, I was so scared just now.

00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:01,750
Luckily, Director Dong

10
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,510
didn't notice the mistake in the minority language.

11
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:07,110
Xiao, you showed your personal views just now.

12
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,550
The board of directors has rejected the development

13
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,750
of sign language translation several times.

14
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,550
But you purposely mentioned it

15
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,230
in front of Director Dong.

16
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,390
The only reason

17
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,700
why they have rejected it

18
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,160
is the market is too small.

19
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,640
But my purpose is to expand the market.

20
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,150
Mr. Xiao is right.

21
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,530
Let's get to the point.

22
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,590
How do we solve

23
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,720

24
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,950
Actually, you and I both know

poaching Cheng Yao

26
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,390
is the quickest way currently.

27
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,390
Wait a little longer.

28
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,470
Wait for what?

29
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,510
Is there any other way?

30
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:52,870
Xiao,

31
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,730
you don't want to poach Cheng Yao.

32
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:55,670
Is it because of the reason

33
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:56,550
I have in my heart?

34
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:56,990
No.

35
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,070
You already know

36
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,070

37
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,510

You are Lin Xi's future husband.

39
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:04,630
But you have

40
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,630
a more important identity.

41
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,630
You are a founder of Yuyi.

42
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,350

43
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:08,870

what you should do.

45
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,910
Why don't you

46
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:11,550
go talk to Cheng Yao?

47
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,020
Considering the personal relationship

48
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,230

49
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,510

50
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,390

84
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,670
to form a translation team

00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:49,540

86

The virus

123
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:24,970

124
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,350

What's wrong, Shasha?

149
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:01,910
Did you sign up for the support project

150
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,350

151
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,710
What do you mean?

152
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,590
If you signed up for it to avoid me,

153
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,190
I can resign.

154
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,070
Shasha,

155
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,110
I admit

156
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,230
it's indeed a bit awkward

157
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,720
for us to be under the same roof

158
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,790
after we broke up.

159
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,710
But that's not why

160
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,860
I signed up for the support project.

161
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:28,670
Then...

162
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,390
can you...

163
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,270
not go to Africa?

164
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,990
Why?

165
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,150
You've already

166
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,430
had similar experiences.

167
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,000
That's exactly why I have to go.

168
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,510
But

169
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,910
you still have the Consumer Products Expo's project.

170
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,030
It's not like

171
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:44,750
that project can't proceed

172
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,870
without me.

173
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,990
But it's dangerous there.

174
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,620
I shall dedicate myself to the interests of the country in life and death

175
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,820
irrespective of personal weal and woe.

176
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:09,630
Shasha,

177
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,270
although that place

178
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,110
is not the land

179
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,510
beneath our feet today,

180
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,070
in the face

181
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,870
of today's globalization

182
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:19,150
and a disaster that affects the human kind,

183
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,150
we have the responsibility

184
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:21,670
and obligation

185
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,870
to help them, right?

186
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,350
I understand what you said.

187
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,950
But I still don't want you

188
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:29,390
to go there.

189
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:35,230
Then... what identity are you using today

190
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,390
to ask me not to go?

191
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,720
No matter what identity I'm using,

192
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,430
I hope you can reconsider it.

193
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,800
No matter what identity you are using,

194
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,990
my answer today is

195
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,390
I will go.

196
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,360
I know

197
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,160
you are making the right choice.

198
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:10,990
But...

199
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,240
when I saw you

200
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,270
write your name

201
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,710
on the application form,

202
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,670
I found that I'm a coward.

203
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,510
I fell in love with you

204
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,810
because of your sense of justice.

205
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,950
You are a hero

206
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,150
in my world.

207
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,190
But later, I found

208
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:34,350
you are everyone's hero.

209
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,950
But now I'm scared.

210
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,830
I don't want you to be a hero anymore.

211
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:48,230
I just want you to stay by my side,

212
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,670
even though we're not a couple.

213
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,270
I just want you to be safe and healthy

214
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:57,110
and be an ordinary person.

215
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,720
Shasha,

216
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,350
let me tell you a story.

217
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:07,750
Once upon a time,

218
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,710
there was an archaeologist.

219
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,550
When he was engaging in archaeological studies,

220
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,440
he discovered a fragment

221
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,590
of a human thighbone

222
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,070
with traces of repair

223
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,550
and healing.

224
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,110
Do you know what it means?

225
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,750
What I'm talking about with you now

226
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,030
is not to go.

227
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,390
I am telling you

228
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,830
why I should go.

229
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:30,970
Can I continue now?

230
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,150
The femora

231
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:40,190
are the thighbones of humans.

232
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,830
They support

233
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,830
the entire weight of the human body.

234
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:46,190
A person with an injured femur

235
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,310
would be unable to walk upright.

236
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,360
And at that time,

237
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,010
a person with an injured femur

238
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,600
couldn't possibly survive on his own.

239
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,550
Coldness,

240
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:07,750
hunger,

241
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,550
and beasts nearby

242
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,230
could kill him

243
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,030
at any time.

244
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,270
But the femur

245
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,670
the archaeologist found

246
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,430
had traces of healing.

247
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,840
What does it mean?

248
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,670
It means

249
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,440
someone found this wounded person

250
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,510
and took him

251
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,790
to a warm and safe place

252
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,350
to take good care of him

253
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:35,710
and give him food.

254
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,790
And it lasted for a long time.

255
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,310
Shasha,

256
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,710
people knew

257
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:45,670
they should help each other

258
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:46,790
a long time ago.

259
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,200
Otherwise,

260
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,630
maybe today's human civilization

261
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,030
wouldn't have existed.

262
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,290
It might sound a bit exaggerated.

263
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,390
Just take it...

264
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,950
as a man's superman dream.

265
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:17,790
Hello, Lin Xi.

266
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,110
Are you free tomorrow?

267
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,830
I want to ask you for a favor.

268
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:25,980
-No.
-Mommy.

269
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:26,990
You can't go.

270
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,150
There's no room for negotiation on this matter.

271
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:30,270
I need to grow up and gain more experience.

272
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,990
I said no, and I mean it.

273
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,120
You can't go.

274
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,830
What happened again?

275
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:37,070
Dad, take a look.

276
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,950
Yicheng, Xixi,

277
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,080
[Outbound application form
of translators for the foreign medical aid team]

278
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:46,230
since you're here to visit Grandpa,

279
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,830
help me persuade her, okay?

280
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,110
We can't let her go.

281
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:52,910
Auntie,

282
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:54,990
Shasha is an adult.

283
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:55,830
She has her own judgment.

284
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:56,790
Right?

285
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:58,830
Xixi.

286
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,850
Have you made up your mind?

287
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,590
Then promise me

288
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,950
you will come back safe and sound.

289
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:11,270
If you get hurt, even if it's just a scratch,

290
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,840
I'll kick you out of the priority client management department.

291
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,430
And you'll be punished to clean up the warehouse.

292
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:15,150
Got it?

293
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,070
Mommy,

294
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,260
Lin Xi also participated

295
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,480
in a support project before.

296
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,510
You heard what she said just now.

297
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:25,910
I'm sure I'll be fine.

298
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,910
Don't worry.

299
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,710
So,

300
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:38,170
they are the persuaders you invited, right?

301
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:40,310
Anyway,

302
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:41,310
I'm gonna make my stance clear today.

303
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:42,990
No matter who tries to persuade me,

304
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:45,120
I will resolutely disagree with this.

305
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,990
Shasha,

306
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,150
you are

307
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,110
our only daughter.

308
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,670
Also, you have an allergic constitution

309
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,230
and you've been spoiled by us.

310
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,950
I would be worried

311
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:56,710
even if it's a business trip

312
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:57,750
to some remote areas in China,

313
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,150
not to mention going to Africa for support.

314
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,430
If you

315
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:04,390
insist on going,

316
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:05,829
don't call me Mom.

317
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:07,310
Talk properly.

318
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,550
Don't always say hurtful words.

319
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:10,510
Dad.

320
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,030
Shasha,

321
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:14,030
you should understand

322
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,630
how your mom feels.

323
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:22,390
Xixi,

324
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:24,190
is it because Wei...

325
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,470
Wei Tian also signed up for it?

326
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:33,670
I know nothing.

327
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,190
You silly girl.

328
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,510
If you're really worried about him,

329
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:39,400
you should persuade him.

330
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,070
The right thing to do is to ask him not to go.

331
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,510
Why do you want to go with him?

332
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:42,910
You...

333
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:43,190
But, Mommy...

334
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:43,630
You...

335
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:44,510
You...

336
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:50,750
Mommy,

337
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,750
please listen to me.

338
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,350
Okay?

339
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,030
When Tian decided to go,

340
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,590
my initial reaction was to stop him.

341
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,350
Because I was scared too.

342
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,910
Just like you,

343
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,150
I told him everything I could.

344
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,080
I used the hard way and the easy way.

345
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,030
But he told me...

346
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:15,830
Shasha,

347
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,310
people knew

348
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,190
they should help each other

349
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,350
a long time ago.

350
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,710
Otherwise,

351
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,310
maybe today's human civilization

352
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,640
wouldn't have existed.

353
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:32,230
So helping someone in distress

354
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,960
is the origin of civilization.

355
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:35,920
Mommy,

356
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:37,670
I want to go.

357
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,070
I grew up

358
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,870
in affluent living conditions.

359
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:42,950
I've enjoyed more than others.

360
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,430
So I should give more

361
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,750
back to the world.

362
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,470
This is how civilization

363
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,710
has been passed down.

364
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:06,510
Good.

365
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:09,570
This is what a child of the Gao Family should be like.

366
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,350
Mommy.

367
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:32,830
Lin Xi,

368
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,550
thank you for today.

369
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:36,350
No need to thank me.

370
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,630
I didn't help much.

371
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,510
How do you plan to persuade Aunt?

372
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:42,550
I'll call Dad later

373
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,950
and let him persuade her.

374
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,430
Will your dad agree?

375
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,470
I think he will.

376
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,800
Besides, Grandpa agreed just now.

377
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,590
Have you told Wei

378
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,320
that you'll participate in the support project?

379
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:58,710
It doesn't matter.

380
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,110
Fine.

381
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:03,440
Your thoughts are the most important.

382
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:04,760
We should get going.

383
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,110
Be careful.

384
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:06,870
Bye.

385
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:16,470
Xiao Yicheng,

386
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,630
if you were Wei

387
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:20,710
and I wanted to go...

388
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:21,470
I agree.

389
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:24,590
Really?

390
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:27,750
Although I really

391
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,030
don't want you to go,

392
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,470
I know

393
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:33,350
this is what you want the most.

394
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,550
Right.

395
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,270
Ling Feng will go there too.

396
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,670
So he wants me

397
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:41,790
to take care of Third Princess.

398
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,880
I asked him to take it to your house directly.

399
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,030
I didn't tell you in advance.

400
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:45,830
You won't blame me, will you?

401
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,350
Why would I blame you?

402
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:47,950
Let's go.

403
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:09,470
Mr. Zhang.

404
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:10,950
What is it?

405
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,840
Shasha signed up for it.

406
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,390
We still need one person.

407
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:25,190
I'll go.

408
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:28,150
Will Xiao Yicheng let you go?

409
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,750
Mr. Zhang, you underestimated him

410
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:31,670
and me.

411
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,150
But you already

412
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:37,550
participated in a support project before.

413
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,110
I have another reason.

414
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,470
Would you like to hear it?

415
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:41,350
Go ahead.

416
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:44,190
The Consumer Products Expo.

417
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:46,070
Director Dong said

418
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,590
he hoped I could be a part of the project.

419
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,320
He was just being euphemistic.

420
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:50,550
Actually,

421
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,390
what he meant is

422
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,450
he's not satisfied with Director Lu.

423
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,190
If we refuse Director Dong,

424
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:55,950
Director Dong's dignity

425
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,110
will be hurt.

426
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:59,710
If so, before our competition with Yuyi

427
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:00,910
officially starts,

428
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:01,910
we would already

429
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,240
leave a bad impression.

430
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:04,990
But if we agree,

431
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,950
we'll hurt Director Lu's feelings.

432
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,470
So if I participate in the support project

433
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,670
at this time,

434
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:12,230
I can have a reason

435
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,160
to stay out of it.

436
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:17,390
You really have become a big-picture thinker.

437
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,030
Thank you for your compliment.

438
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,350
But it's too late.

439
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,510
Lu has signed up for it

440
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,350
before you.

441
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:25,790
Director Lu...

442
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,270
has always wanted to be a part

443
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,910
of the Consumer Products Expo project, right?

444
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:31,240
But he will leave.

445
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,720
Even if I don't tell you, you know

446
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,910
who will be responsible for the Consumer Products Expo project

447
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:36,430
after he leaves, right?

448
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:01,950
It's not specially for you.

449
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,680
Wei and the others also have it.

450
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,590
Just now,

451
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:09,520
you also went to submit the application form, right?

452
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:11,760
Don't be surprised.

453
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:13,430
In most cases, your enemies

454
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:15,290
are the ones who know you the best.

455
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:16,820
Not enemies,

456
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:17,710
but opponents.

457
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:29,660
Don't think

458
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:31,270
I have made peace with you

459
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,790
just because I accepted your thing.

460
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,650
You'll always be my opponent.

461
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,230
Of course.

462
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:38,910
But this time,

463
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:39,590
you are

464
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,990
an honourable opponent.

465
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,200
Lin Xi,

466
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,210
I signed up for this project

467
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:50,390
with some personal motives as well.

468
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,230
Director Dong kept asking you

469
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:55,490
to participate in the bidding

470
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:57,830
for the Consumer Products Expo project.

471
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,690
This means he wants me out, right?

472
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,050
Instead of being disliked

473
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,480
by the client in the end,

474
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,190
I might as well

475
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:07,030
find myself a way out.

476
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:08,830
In addition,

477
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:11,030
even though I've become the director

478
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,030
of the priority client management department,

479
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,700
there are still people who are not convinced.

480
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,150
I want to gain more experience,

481
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:16,630
so that I can reinforce my position

482
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:17,750
after I come back.

483
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:21,070
Otherwise, I might

484
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:22,960
be replaced by you somehow.

485
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,510
Then you must

486
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:27,390
come back from there.

487
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:28,310
Of course.

488
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:30,430
Our competition is not over yet.

489
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:32,450
Wait for me to come back

490
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:35,890
to continue our competition.

491
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:52,320
♫When I meet the right person♫

492
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,310
Dear Mommy,

493
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:53,580
please forgive me for being wilful.

494
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:56,540
♫I'll stop and wait♫

495
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:56,470
I grew up

496
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:58,030
under the care of you and Daddy.

497
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,230
I've never experienced

498
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,430
any setback.

499
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:03,060
♫I'll be willing to give my all♫

500
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:03,550
When I fell off a cliff several years ago,

501
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,590
for the first time, I realized

502
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:07,420
♫To look into your gentle eyes♫

503
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:07,160
what fear is.

504
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:14,330
[Mommy]

505
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,590
It was Tian

506
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,350
who saved me from the abyss.

507
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:14,640
♫There are countless possibilities in the future♫

508
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:13,190
He gave me a sense of security

509
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,150
and courage.

510
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:19,930
♫I could either be a part of or leave your life♫

511
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:16,430
Mommy,

512
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:17,990
maybe he and I

513
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,670
are not suitable for each other in many aspects.

514
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:21,750
He's rugged, while I'm meticulous.

515
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:24,550
♫It's my pleasure to share this process♫

516
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:24,210
He's straightforward, while I'm romantic.

517
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,550
Many people are not optimistic

518
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:28,560
♫Our story is still considered complete♫

519
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,950
about our relationship,

520
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:29,030
including me.

521
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,470
So I chose to give up.

522
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,430
But it's really hard.

523
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:39,280
♫If the fireworks have seen sunset before they disappear♫

524
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:36,710
When I see him,

525
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:38,570
my heart would still beat faster.

526
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,540
When he signed up for the support project,

527
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:44,820
♫There's no reason for love to just be missed out on♫

528
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,990
I still felt worried.

529
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:44,390
I think

530
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:45,950
probably I still can't convince myself

531
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:52,740
♫Regret shouldn't be a lesson learned♫

532
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,390
to leave him for good.

533
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,470
So, Mommy,

534
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:51,910
I want to give us

535
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:53,190
one more chance.

536
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:58,180
♫Can you not be silent?♫

537
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,900

Xi,

00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:18,450
I'm leaving my Third Princess to you.

545
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:19,310
Don't worry.

546
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,350
I will treat it

547
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,510
like it's my own daughter.

548
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:22,310
Go.

549
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:27,510
Why are you dressing

550
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:28,910
like you are going to fight today?

551
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:30,040
Are you going to war?

552
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,370
Professor Gao,

553
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,990
Shasha volunteered to go this time.

554
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:36,190
I'd like to thank you for supporting her.

555
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:38,030
Mr. Zhang, don't stand on ceremony.

556
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,910
My two granddaughters

557
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:41,260
have caused Huasheng

558
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,390
a lot of trouble.

559
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:42,990
No.

560
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:43,990
This is work.

561
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:44,990
It's their duty.

562
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:45,990
Grandpa,

563
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:47,110
we have also earned many glories

564
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,590
for the company, right?

565
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,590
Yes, both of them are backbones.

566
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:51,710
Both of them are backbones.

567
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:52,430
Let's go.

568
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,390
It's so heavy.

569
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:56,980
I didn't bring any unimportant thing

570
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,470
this time.

571
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,430
What unimportant thing?

572
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:03,270
Last time, when I went on a business trip with Shasha,

573
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,510
the security inspector thought

574
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:06,070
her hair curler was a mace

575
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,600
during the security check.

576
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,070
The things I brought this time

577
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,710
were purchased

578
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:13,440
according to the list you gave me.

579
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,350
Good girl. You're really good.

580
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:16,430
Since you didn't bring your hair curler,

581
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:18,030
how will you do hair styling?

582
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:20,710
What happened to your hair?

583
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:21,750
I had a haircut.

584
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:24,310
After having a haircut last night,

585
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,230
her eyes were as red as a rabbit's eyes

586
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,510
when she came home.

587
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,550
Was it necessary?

588
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:28,870
Of course.

589
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,750
But...

590
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:33,750
hair can grow back after being cut.

591
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:36,790
Everyone is here.

592
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:37,780
Get ready to go.

593
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:39,870
Okay.

594
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:42,470
I'll be waiting for you to come back safely.

595
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,270
Take care of yourself.

596
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,870
You too.

597
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,670
Grandpa.

598
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:52,550
Take care.

599
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:53,280
I'm leaving.

600
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:54,710
Take good care of her.

601
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:55,390
Grandpa,

602
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:56,720
take care of yourself.

603
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,630
I'll contact you

604
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:58,630
when I arrive.

605
00:27:58,630 --> 00:27:59,390
Don't worry.

606
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:04,310
When I came, your mom told me

607
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,030
she wouldn't come.

608
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,030
Okay.

609
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:10,100
Go.

610
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:14,110
Grandpa, take care.

611
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:15,910
Bye.

612
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:16,830
Go.

613
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:17,790
Bye.

614
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,590
Okay, stop.

615
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,630
Did you bring sunscreen?

616
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:28,790
Yes.

617
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,590
Give me your bag.

618
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,050
I'm gonna put it in the car.

619
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:34,910
Mom.

620
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,500
I prepared some sunscreen products

621
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,510
with SPF 50,

622
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,990
SPF 20, and SPF 30

623
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:41,950
for you.

624
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:43,670
You have an allergic constitution.

625
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:45,230
Remember to apply sunscreen.

626
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:46,190
And you have digestive issues.

627
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:47,510
I prepared the medicine for gastroenteritis

628
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:49,630
and the immunity-boosting medicine.

629
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:50,670
See?

630
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:51,910
The medicine.

631
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:53,310
Every day, don't forget...

632
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,030
Mom,

633
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,550
the company has prepared them.

634
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,210
And I've brought them with me.

635
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:00,190
Is your company as thoughtful as me?

636
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:01,510
Huh?

637
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:03,030
Auntie, don't worry.

638
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:05,290
I'll take good care of Shasha.

639
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:07,470
Wei Tian, listen.

640
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:08,790
I'm entrusting Shasha

641
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,150
to you intactly.

642
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:11,670
If anything happens to her,

643
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:13,270
you'll be held accountable.

644
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:13,990
Don't worry.

645
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:15,190
I'll keep her intact.

646
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,350
Wei Tian.

647
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:16,950
Take it.

648
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,310
Do your best.

649
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,710
Remember what I told you.

650
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:21,630
You must be careful

651
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:22,550
with what you eat.

652
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:23,710

680
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:42,070
I've talked to Cheng Yao.

681
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:45,150
He said he needed time to think about it.

682
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,830
Cheng Yao is young.

683
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:59,430
But he's very rational

684
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:01,670
when it comes to important matters.

685
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:03,110
If he won't come,

686
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,800
it doesn't mean he doesn't care about you.

687
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:10,990
I understand.

688
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:13,110
I respect his choice.

689
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,230
Mr. Xiao. Mr. Xiao.

690
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:18,950
Bad news.

691
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:21,150
We're one of the trending topics again.

692
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:24,410
[Three questions for Yuyi: Why are you bidding for the translation supplier of the Consumer Products Expo when such a serious mistake has been made?]

693
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:35,690
[Three questions for Yuyi: Why are you bidding for the translation supplier of the Consumer Products Expo when such a serious mistake has been made?]

694
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:43,670
In the process

695
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:44,630
of developing Icelandic,

696
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:45,910
Yuyi made a serious mistake.

697
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:47,550
As the only AI technology company

698
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:48,910
attending the Consumer Products Expo,

699
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:51,570
can it still participate in the bidding on time?

700
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:52,710
Mr. Xiao, Ms. Tong,

701
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:53,830
the incident

702
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:54,860
has drawn much public attention on the Internet.

703
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:55,910
Our colleagues in the PR Department

704
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:57,470
have temporarily removed the trending topic.

705
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:58,990
They have also contacted some official accounts

706
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:00,550
to release some positive articles.

707
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:02,390
The stock price has been stabilized for now.

708
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:03,710
But as you can see,

709
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,590
compared to the opening price,

710
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,050
the stock price has dropped significantly.

711
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:11,090
What about Director Dong?

712
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:12,430
Jean.

713
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:14,190
I've talked to Director Dong.

714
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:15,590
The situation is not very optimistic.

715
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:16,990
Make an appointment with Director Dong for me.

716
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:17,680
I'll talk to him.

717
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,030
No need for that.

718
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,360
You guys go back to work.

719
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:27,950
Dismiss.

720
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,190
Recently, Mr. Xiao has been busy

721
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:49,230
with the bidding for the Consumer Products Expo project.

722
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,710
I believe you all know

723
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,150
how significant the Consumer Products Expo project is

724
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:53,950
to Yuyi

725
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:54,950
after the IPO.

726
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:56,390
So?

727
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:57,870
So...

728
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:02,190
So the shareholders here

729
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,630
want to ask Mr. Xiao

730
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:06,990
to be responsible for the drop of the stock price this time.

731
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:08,230
We think

732
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:10,350
it's you, Xiao Yicheng,

733
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:12,510
who have made us suffer losses.

734
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:14,990
You're no longer suitable

735
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:17,590
for being Yuyi's board chairman

736
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:19,830
or Chief Technology Officer.

737
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:23,630
Ying Tao, don't go too far.

738
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:25,470
Mr. Ying,

739
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:29,000
do you have evidence for what you said?

740
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:30,470
Evidence?

741
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:32,310
It's obvious.

742
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,030
At the crucial moment

743
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,640
of Yuyi's competition with Huasheng,

744
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,110
Yuyi is embroiled in a scandal

745
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:39,110
related to its translation device.

746
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,030
Only internal company personnel

747
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:43,030
know this bug.

748
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,310
But you, Xiao Yicheng,

749
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:45,790
as an insider,

750
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,510
has been preparing a wedding

751
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:49,030
with an employee of Huasheng.

752
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:50,830
The situation is clear now.

753
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:52,590
If you didn't leak the information,

754
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:53,550
who else could it be?

755
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:54,390
Mr. Ying,

756
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:57,550
I'm in charge of the company.

757
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:58,590
I would never do anything like this

758
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:00,650
to harm the interests of the company.

759
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:01,550
I can accept

760
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:02,870
the company's internal investigation.

761
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:04,150
But before the investigation results

762
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:04,750
are announced,

763
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:05,470
Mr. Ying,

764
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,610
please be careful with your words.

765
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:09,219
Mr. Xiao,

766
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:10,710
you're right.

767
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:12,350
Before the investigation results

768
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,830
are announced,

769
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:16,949
all of the company's shareholders

770
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:18,989
can't possibly let someone who may betray the company

771
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:20,270
occupy this position.

772
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:23,350
You... can't represent all the shareholders.

773
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,070
Really?

774
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,030
Mr. Zhang.

[Job transfer of Xiao Yicheng, who leaked the company's secret
Joint letter of the board of directors]

776
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:34,550
See?

777
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:38,969
[Signatures of the informants: Ying Tao] [Sun Youwei] [Zhu Lin]

778
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:39,389
This is a joint letter

779
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:41,469
from all the shareholders with voting rights,

780
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:43,230
except Ms. Tong.

781
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:44,510
Mr. Xiao,

782
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:46,150
if you

783
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:48,760
take the initiative to apply for a job transfer,

784
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,670
maybe

785
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,550
you can save some dignity.

786
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,790
If you are not convinced,

787
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:53,870
you can also

788
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,150
convene a temporary board meeting.

789
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:55,989
But...

790
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,590
it'll just be a procedural formality.

791
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:59,710
The result won't be changed.

792
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:17,960
He came prepared.

793
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,310
Xiao, tell me the truth.

794
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:40,310
Have you ever mentioned this

795
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:41,550
to anyone else?

796
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,910
Why don't you just ask me

797
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:45,640
if I told anyone from Huasheng?

798
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:48,710
I just want to rule out

799
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:49,870
all the possibilities

800
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:53,600
and find the person who leaked the information as soon as possible.

801
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:56,990
Lin Xi knows.

802
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:59,550
What?

803
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:02,430
You told her?

804
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:03,830
No.

805
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:08,230
When I called Ma,

806
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:11,430
my cellphone was connected to my car's bluetooth.

807
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,710
But Tong Xin,

808
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:16,190
I trust her.

809
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:17,840
Just like you trust me.

810
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,470
Of course I believe Lin Xi

811
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,190
is righteous and she won't disclose the secret.

812
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:23,470
But is it possible that she spilt the beans

813
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:24,590
accidentally?

814
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:28,690
The speaker is innocent, but the listener may have ulterior motives.

815
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,830
The problem we are facing now

816
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:33,350
is how to fix the bug.

817
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:35,150
Let's put aside other problems.

818
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:36,870
But the problem is

819
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:38,590
Ying Tao is coming at you.

820
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:39,990
He wants you to step down.

821
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:41,350
If we don't find the person

822
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:42,510
who leaked the information as soon as possible,

823
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:43,790
you will still be denounced

824
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:45,270
even if you fix the bug.

825
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:47,950
I know.

826
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,630
Tell them to have a meeting first.

827
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:51,670
Xiao.

828
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:56,630
I'll find a way

829
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:59,720
to continue to persuade Cheng Yao.

830
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:02,390
He has refused you.

831
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:06,720
We can only think of other ways.

832
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:08,150
This is my business.

833
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:10,070

835
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,990
I can't just

836
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,770
let someone else take it away.

837
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,830
How come you haven't gotten off work yet?

838
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,310
Did Xiao Yicheng tell you?

839
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:32,470
Tell me what?

840
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:33,480
He called me and said

841
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,070
he'd be downstairs soon. He is on his way here to pick me up.

842
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:37,550
Something happened to him.

843
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:38,190
Look.

Now, Yuyi firmly believes

846
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:44,910
he leaked the information to you.

847
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,680

You came to pick me up so early today.

849
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,150
I bought you

850
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,390
your favorite bread.

851
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:09,030
I can't eat it.

852
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:11,670
Otherwise, I won't be able to fit into the wedding dress.

853
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:13,110
You are hardworking.

854
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:14,370
You won't gain weight.

855
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:15,510
You're talking about me.

856
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,640
Aren't you the same?

857
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:19,710
Be careful.

-Let's go eat.

859
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,730
-I'm fine with eating.
-I'm fine with going home.

860
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,310
So... are we going to eat or go home?

861
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:36,310
It's up to you. I'm fine with anything.

862
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:38,150
Okay.

No.

00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:26,110
yes,

871
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,700

00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:30,630
You... are not this kind of person.

873

Xiao Yicheng,

874
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:35,870
you think too highly of me.

875
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,070

the woman I like

878
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:43,590
would never stab me in the back.

879
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:52,280
Actually, I really want to do that.

880
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:01,120
If I really did that,

881
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:03,030
I would be shameless, right?

882
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,790
But you didn't.

883
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,270
I didn't do that

884
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:11,990
because Grandma Li said

885
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,350
if I stab you in the back,

886
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:15,570
Huasheng will win,

887
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:17,430
but I will lose.

00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,910
Human translation wants to win,

889
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:22,550
and it will win

890
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:23,480
fair and square.

891
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:27,710
Actually, I...

892
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:29,440
Don't talk. Listen to me first.

893
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,990
You suspect me.

894
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:34,870
You want to ask me.

895
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,590
I can understand.

896
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:40,910
Xiao Yicheng,

897
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:43,910
this bidding

898
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:46,110
is a test

899
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:48,110
for you, me,

900
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:51,230

But

903
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:57,290
we must not cross the line.

904
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:03,350
You know what?

905
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:07,320
This is the first time that I feel so tired.

906
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:10,990
I'm even thinking

907
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:13,270
if it could end like this.

908
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:17,470
When I started my own business,

909
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:19,750
no matter how tiring or difficult it was,

910
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:21,270
I knew what my goal was.

everything I've done is in vain.

914
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:29,030
I feel so helpless.

915

Go somewhere with me.

916
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:46,190
Turn right ahead.

00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,010
[Lin likes Xiao]

952
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:44,190
I made a mark.

953
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:46,550
When did you make a mark

954
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:47,440
behind my back?

955
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,020
[Lin likes Xiao]

956
00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:48,110
Also,

957
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:49,310
why is it "Lin likes Xiao",

958
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:50,510
not "Xiao likes Lin"?

959
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:53,270
You fell in love with me first, right?

960
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:53,990
I remember

961
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:55,520
you came to talk to me first.

962
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,270
You are asking for a beating.

963
00:44:57,270 --> 00:44:58,200
Stop running.

964
00:44:58,230 --> 00:44:58,750
Come on.

965
00:44:58,750 --> 00:44:59,680
Stop running.

966
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:01,660
Stop running.

967
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:02,750
Stop running.
