just watch my video.

45
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,360
This is a line from the Classical Ancient Chinese Essays.

120
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,800
if there was something wrong with the food.

121
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,270

00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,630
This is not his style.

194
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,270
Xiao Yicheng said harsh words

195
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,190
and wanted to overthrow

196
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,590
the traditional translation industry.

197
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:48,270
The headquarters

198
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,910
thinks he is too arrogant

199
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,470
and wants to teach him a lesson.

200
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,070
As the leader of the industry,

201
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:56,440
Huasheng must make its move.

202
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,070
So,

203
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,780
if Huasheng acquires

204
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,270
Yuyi's IPO order,

205
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,750
it would be the best counterattack.

206
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:05,030
You accepted the case?

207
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,430
What else can I do?

208
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:07,550
They threatened me

209
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,350
with my spot at the UN.

210
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:10,870
Anyway, go coordinate

211
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,350
with the team at Yuyi first.

212
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,780
Xiao Yicheng

213
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,540
is obviously trying to take revenge on me.

214
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:16,710
Last time,

215
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,750
what I said was

216
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,350
indeed too much.

217
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,150
It's not suitable for me to go.

I'll support you from the back.

222

[I'm Lin Xi from Huasheng]

229
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:04,990
I only add acquaintances.

230
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,830
Strangers can become acquaintances, and vice versa.

231
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,270
Rejection is also communication.

232
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:12,430
Let's talk like this.

233
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,110
So persistent.

This is Mr. Xiao.

235
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,590
I didn't fake the video.

236
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,070
It's your translator's problem

237
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,080
for failing to provide

238
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,190
the correct translations.

Will you get rid of the person

242
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,270
who created the problem instead?

243
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,550
Let me guess

244
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,470
what's in here.

245
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,510
Is it a PR document asking me

246
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,070
to delete the video,

247
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:31,230
or will you be threatening me

248
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,230

249
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,350

Yuyi

253
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,310
has a position for

254
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,750
a resource engineer.

259
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,230
and improve the function of the machine translator.

260
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:06,830
Ultimately, it's to help the machine translator

261
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,670
provide a more accurate presentation of languages.

262
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,950
As the founder of Yuyi,

263
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,030
I hope you can join us.

264
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:18,270
I watched

265
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,990
your product testing video.

266
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,230
It was good.

between Chinese and English languages.

271

Every point has

272
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,030
precisely pointed out

273
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,790
the problems of Yuyi's machine translator.

274
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,150
I think

275
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,870
the key to solving the problem

276
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,240
is to discover the problem.

277
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,110
You are a pro

278
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,430
at discovering problems.

279
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:41,030
You can totally take this position.

280
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,460
Are you trying to hire me first

281
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,670
so you can take revenge on me later?

282
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,790
Why would I do that?

283
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,830
Aren't you afraid that I was sent here

284
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:01,980
by your rival to drag you down?

285
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,630
You are not.

286
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,990
Of the three questions you used,

287
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,110
when those phrases are taken out of context,

288
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,870
no machine translator in this world

289
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,350
can provide the correct answer.

290
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,190
Besides,

291
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,430
Yuyi has no rivals.

292
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,790
It's been a long time

293
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:23,990
since I met an arrogant madman like you.

294
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,340
Yuyi has always admired the arrogant and the mad.

295
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,550
When someone is arrogant,

296
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,630
it means that

297
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:34,910
he's long used to

Machine translation

341
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,170

345
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,550
Of course there's no problem with that.

346
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,720
But the condition is,

347
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,550
the speaker is a machine,

348
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,670
and the listener is also a machine.

349
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,240
But if the speaker is a person

350
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,430
and the listener is also a person,

351
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,230
then the machine

352
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,590

00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:28,510
Here's the thing.

385
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,390
I'll talk to you

386
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,470
about the bidding instead.

387
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,350
Okay.

388
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,590
Thank you, Manager Ma.

389
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:51,950
Tian.

390
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,710
I think Yuyi lacks sincerity.

391
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,110
We made an appointment

392
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,790
with their director of operations.

393
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,470
But she didn't show up.

394
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:00,910
I think

395
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,830
they are not sincere about cooperating with us.

396
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:07,950
Ms. Tong is a director.

397
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,390
Lin Xi should have

398
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,510
contacted her instead.

399
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:12,790
So that's why they sent Manager Ma

400
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:13,870
to talk to us.

401
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:17,430
Why didn't Lin Xi come in person?

402
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:18,950
No.

403
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,310
If they were particular about this,

404
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,750
why did Tong Xin agree

405
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,310
to receive us this morning?

406
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,670
I need to make a call.

407
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,310
Hello, Lin Xi.

408
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:38,270
I think you need to

409
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,750
communicate with Yuyi in person.

410
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,110
What's wrong?

411
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,830
Ms. Tong thinks my position is not high enough.

412
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:45,350
How could it be?

413
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,950
Didn't Ms. Tong arrange everything already?

414
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,240
I guess

415
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,110
Xiao Yicheng threw a tantrum again.

416
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:53,670
Isn't he tired of it yet?

417
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,150
What should we do now?

418
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,470
Why don't you give them a visit?

419
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,230
Why?

420
00:19:58,870 --> 00:19:59,950
Although we are Party B,

421
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,630
we have dignity too.

422
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,870
I don't have time to play with him.

423
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:04,990
Let me remind you.

424
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,380
If you can’t get this order,

425
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:08,110
you can’t answer to Mr. Zhang.

426
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:09,950
Regardless, I've handed

427
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,270
this matter to you.

428
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,230
It's none of my business anymore.

429
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:14,430
If you can't meet her

430
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,430
in normal ways,

431
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,990
think of another way.

432
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:19,430
I...

433
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:20,670
Hello?

434
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,270
She...

435
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,670
It's okay. Let's go.

436
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:43,210
[Lin Xi]

437
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,030
Hello, Ms. Tong.

438
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:47,550
Hello.

439
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,150
Come in.

440
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,190
Mr. Xiao,

441
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,470
according to your order,

442
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,350
I've asked Ma to contact them.

443
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,550
But,

444
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,470
do you think Lin Xi will show up?

445
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,070
This is the basic etiquette

446
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:06,490
at work.

447
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,790
Is this work etiquette,

448
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,350
or does someone want to see her?

449
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:16,510
Xiao,

450
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,070
we've been friends for so many years.

451
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,310
Tell me.

452
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,910
What do you really want?

453
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:26,130
I just want her to know

454
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,640
she was wrong.

455
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,340
And then?

456
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:32,830
Then you count on her

457
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,830
to come back to you crying and shouting

458
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:36,530
and put you two back together?

459
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:39,350
That's too good for her.

460
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,910
Can you be more mature?

461
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:48,780
By the way,

462
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,280
Peter's teacher came to me

463
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:53,710
and said

464
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:54,790
he has been bullying

465
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,110
a girl in his class these days.

466
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:00,150
Okay, I'll talk to him tonight.

467
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,430
I already talked to him.

468
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:02,950
He told me

469
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,590
he likes that girl.

470
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,230
Then I told him

471
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:10,750
if he really likes her,

472
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,070
he should be nice to her.

473
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:13,910
If he always bullies that girl,

474
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:15,230
he'll scare her away.

475
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,670
Get out.

476
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,190
Be an adult.

477
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:36,830
[Employee of the Year]

478
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,500
Yao.

479
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,110
Someone wants to see you.

480
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,230
Yao.

481
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:27,750
What do you mean?

482
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:30,390
The evaluation video you uploaded yesterday

483
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,830
was just a trick.

484
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,780
People from Yuyi

485
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,910
are really interesting.

486
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,270
You failed to lure me yesterday.

487
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,070
What?

488
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:39,470
Are you threatening me today?

489
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:40,870
People from Yuyi came to you before?

490
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,270
You're not from Yuyi?

491
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,390
In the video,

492
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:56,790
you specifically chose

493
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,310
uncommon ancient Chinese texts

494
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:00,670
and ambiguities in specific situations.

495
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:02,230
Even the last flaw

496
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,470
in the logic

497
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,510
was caused by you pretending

498
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,190
to ignore the application in the situation.

499
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,510
Beating a translator

500
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,070
was just opportunistic.

501
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,670
Under normal circumstances,

502
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,070
it can handle

503
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,390
any daily situation.

504
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,110
Besides...

505
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:16,070
What?

506
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,150
Besides,

507
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:21,070
it can almost

508
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,670
translate instantly.

509
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,790
It's faster than humans.

510
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:27,110
It's only a matter of time

511
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,100
before machine translation replaces human translation.

512
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:29,230
So what?

513
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:30,670
It doesn't understand

514
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:33,590
what "faithfulness"，"expressiveness", and "elegance" are.

515
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:37,110
You don't like machine translation?

516
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,710
Of course. No one likes it,

517
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:39,740
except machines.

518
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,910
Cold expressions

519
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:43,430
are harmful to human language.

520
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:46,590
Excellent.

521
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,950
We have the same idea.

522
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,310
Let me introduce myself.

523
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:52,920
I'm Lin Xi from Huasheng.

524
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:58,670
The one who added me on WeChat.

525
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,830
Are we acquaintances now?

526
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:04,950
Just say it.

527
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,270
What do you want from me?

528
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:10,340
I've been an interpreter

529
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:11,550
for many years.

530
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,110
I totally understand

531
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,630
your motive for making that evaluation video.

532
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,910
But being opportunistic

533
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,630
and making a few videos

534
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,030
won't change anything.

535
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,030
On the contrary, they're Yuyi's

536
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,220
free advertisements.

537
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,150
It sounds reasonable.

538
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:28,640
You're smarter than me.

539
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,710
I'm not smarter than you.

540
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,510
I just know your value.

541
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,420
So,

542
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:34,270
I want to invite you

543
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,830
to join the priority client management team of Huasheng

544
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,190
as a free interpreter.

545
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:42,790
Huasheng has platforms.

546
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:43,670
You're capable.

547
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,710
We can fight

548
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,430
for the beauty of language together.

549
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,350
Is this

550
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,870
Yuyi's some kind of trick?

551
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,030
Two days in a row,

552
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,190
two people came to me.

553
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:56,280
What a coincidence.

554
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,830
Then why didn't you

555
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:00,950
say yes to Yuyi?

556
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:04,340
Because I want freedom.

557
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:05,830
Besides,

558
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:06,880
I haven't joined my friends yet.

559
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,950
How could I surrender to enemies?

560
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,070
You can make a fortune if you surrender.

561
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,430
Do I look as if I'm short of money?

562
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:15,030
So, look.

563
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:16,150
I didn't talk to you about salaries

564
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,750
as soon as I came.

565
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:20,910
Skateboard boys put freedom first.

566
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:23,150
Freedom of thought and expression.

567
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:24,690
These are your life.

568
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,870
So I can promise you

569
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,990
that as long as you're willing to join Huasheng,

570
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,230
I can let you

571
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:34,750
embrace freedom completely,

572
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:36,750
from your feet to your soul.

573
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,110
You're quite eloquent.

574
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:43,950
I have another question.

575
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,110
How did you find this place?

576
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:47,590
Besides people in this circle,

577
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,710
not many people know it.

578
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:04,230
[New Friends]

579
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:06,610
[New Friends]

580
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,420
[Cheng Yao]

581
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:13,880
You're quite thoughtful.

582
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:16,510
So, can I have a yes?

583
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:18,650
Wait.

584
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,090
I have one last question.

585
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:26,500
It's very easy.

586
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,030
Stand on the board with your feet.

587
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:29,270
If you can slide 50 meters,

588
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,630
I'll believe your sincerity.

589
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,550
What? Are you scared?

590
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:36,670
If so,

591
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:37,350
how can I believe

592
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,990
Huasheng has the courage

593
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,750
to defeat artificial intelligence?

594
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:43,180
If I make it,

595
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,350
you'll join Huasheng?

596
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,470
Okay.

597
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,550
Great!

598
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:04,990
Yao.

599
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,790
This woman knows a little.

600
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:15,110
Bravo!

601
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,790
You played it before?

602
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,270
Last year, when the world's

603
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:39,070
top park terrain skateboarding competition,

604
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,590
Vans Professional Skateboarding Competition,

605
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:41,910
came to Xiahai,

606
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:42,870
our team

607
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:43,990
was responsible for the translation.

608
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,390
In order to express

609
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:47,310
the proper terms well,

610
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,510
I learnt a little.

611
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:49,390
Look.

612
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:51,200
This is what machines can't do.

613
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,310
I'll wait for you to report for work on Monday.

614
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:07,750
Yao, why are you so depressed?

615
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,310
You fell for her?

616
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,510
No offense.

617
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:14,500
If you don't take action,

618
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:16,110
I'll...

619
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:23,330
Let's go.

620
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,230
Hello?

621
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:34,150
What?

622
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:35,190
Did you see Yuyi's people?

623
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,830
I can't explain it on the phone.

624
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:37,670
Let's talk in person.

625
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,150
Where are you?

626
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:40,390
I'll send you the location.

627
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,710
The soybeans they made today

628
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:46,390
are so delicious.

629
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,510
The peanuts are also delicious.

630
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:50,950
Have you made an appointment with Ms. Tong?

631
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:51,920
And who is in charge

632
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,230
of their bidding this time?

633
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,570
Have you seen that person? Does that person have a temper?

634
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,430
You'll know soon.

635
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:56,710
Soon?

636
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:03,990
Come.

637
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:07,630
Xiao.

638
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,110
Come back.

639
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:10,510
The food in this restaurant is very delicious.

640
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:11,190
What do you mean?

641
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,230
Come.

642
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:13,230
Have a seat.

643
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:16,870
Sit down.

644
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:19,540
Waiter.

645
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,950
Give me another bottle of beer,

646
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:21,830
a bowl, and a pair of chopsticks.

647
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:26,640
Here, try it.

648
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:29,770
This is my favorite place.

649
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:38,210
Drink some.

650
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:50,830
Guys.

651
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,270
I'm

652
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,190
a slow-witted person.

653
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,520
I'm not good at talking.

654
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:56,790
I invited you two here today

655
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:58,090
because I want to talk it out.

656
00:30:58,790 --> 00:30:59,910
Our Huasheng

657
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,480
is quite sincere in the bidding

658
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,300
for the order of Yuyi.

659
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:04,270
Xiao.

660
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,860
I don't care

661
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,380
why you broke up eight years ago.

662
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,940
That's your personal grudge,

663
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,010
right?

664
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,560
But don't bring

665
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:12,350
your personal grudge

666
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,350
to work.

667
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,350
I don't understand what you're talking about.

668
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:27,550
Fine.

669
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:29,870
I'll make it clear then.

670
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:31,350
Xiao Yicheng.

671
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:32,710
Let me ask you.

672
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,430
No matter what,

673
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:35,510
you're not going to give this project

674
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:36,160
to Lin Xi, right?

675
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:37,830
Wei Tian.

676
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:39,870
The IPO of Yuyi

677
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:40,790
was entrusted to an intermediary

678
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:41,990
to conduct an open bidding.

679
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,550
Who to give it to

680
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:44,310
has to be evaluated

681
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,580
by the board of directors.

682
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:48,160
If you want the order,

683
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,470
you have to rely on your ability.

684
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:52,070
Without a doubt,

685
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:53,390
Huasheng is the best.

686
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:54,350
That's your opinion.

687
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,510
This is a consensus.

688
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:01,810
Really?

689
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,520
Okay.

690
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,470
First,

691
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,460
your interpreter was absent.

692
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:11,630
The employee lacked

693
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:13,030
professional courtesy.

694
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,420
Second,

695
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:15,910
I filed a complaint against you.

696
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:17,150
But you tried your best

697
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,230
to keep it stable.

698
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:19,310
From beginning to end,

699
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,480
the management didn't realize

700
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,510
the seriousness of the problem.

701
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:23,750
Third,

702
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,110
you want to get the order

703
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:26,950
from Yuyi.

704
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:28,680
But you let

705
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,830
your project manager

706
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,630
to contact our director of operations.

707
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,830
It lacked business norms.

708
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,110
Am I right?

709
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,790
This is your so-called

710
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,030
"the best"?

711
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:54,670
But what worries me the most is

712
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:56,990
that Director Lin seems to think

713
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,750
what I'm doing now

714
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,070
is my revenge

715
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:03,270
for what you did that year.

716
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:09,510
I spent eight years

717
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,950
in proving

718
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:12,550
that you were mistaken about me.

719
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,500
But I didn't expect

720
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,190
that you spent eight years

721
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,980
in becoming a narrow-minded

722
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:20,180
and short-sighted person.

723
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,260
Xiao.

724
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:33,900
Lin Xi.

725
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,590
Don't think that everyone

726
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,430
is still

727
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:39,070
living in that small world like you.

728
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,980
I'm no longer the old me.

729
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:42,850
I hope you're the same.

730
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:44,550
Xiao.

731
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:45,560
Wait.

732
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,980
I apologize for what happened

733
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,960
in the press conference.

734
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:03,310
I apologize

735
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,390
for my wishful thinking.

736
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:07,910
Yuyi's

737
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:09,320
IPO bidding.

738
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:10,510
Our Huasheng

739
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:12,389
will show you our strength

740
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:13,429
and do our best.

741
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:15,510
I hope you can also see

742
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:16,790
that after eight years,

743
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:19,070
you're not the only one who became strong.

744
00:34:26,949 --> 00:34:27,920
Enough.

745
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:30,270
Why don't you persuade her?

746
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:31,870
Let her drink.

747
00:34:40,989 --> 00:34:41,870
Good.

748
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,239
Eight years passed.

749
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:44,969
You can drink more.

750
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:20,590
Take the passenger seat.

751
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,910
The seat behind the driver is the safest.

752
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:46,990
Thanks.

753
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:48,110
Aren't you going back home?

754
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,260
My dad has been transferred.

755
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:55,270
He has been staying in Beijing for two years.

756
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:56,750
Even if I go back, I'm still alone.

757
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,530
The serviced apartment is good.

758
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:04,230
Papa.

759
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:04,830
Let's go.

760
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:06,990
What took you so long?

761
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:08,030
I just got off work.

762
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:08,750
Can you

763
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,220
read me a storybook tonight?

764
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,730
Of course.

765
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,350
Let's go.

766
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,420
Why don't you invite her up?

767
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,030
Who?

768
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:18,400
You know the answer.

769
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:19,630
Are you so heartless?

770
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:23,710
Do you still

771
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:25,060
have feelings for her?

772
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:27,690
What feelings should I have?

773
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:30,500
If you say so,

774
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,390
I'll encourage Ma

775
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:34,150
to chase Director Lin boldly.

776
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:36,390
When Lin Xi

777
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:37,950
waited for you in the company last time,

778
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:40,030
Ma fell for her at first sight.

779
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,710
Because of your relationship with her,

780
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:42,910
I didn't do much.

781
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,070
Now it seems

782
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:45,550
that my worries are unnecessary.

783
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,550
I hope he succeeds.

784
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:53,270
Okay.

785
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:54,190
Let's go.

786
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:08,030
Are you okay?

787
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,340
I'm talking about the child.

788
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,330
That child isn't little.

789
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:21,990
It means Xiao Yicheng forgot me

790
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:24,000
as soon as he went abroad.

791
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:27,550
I don't think he's that kind of person.

792
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:31,990
The truth is right in front of us.

793
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:36,580
Forget it. Why are we talking about these?

794
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,790
Meeting him now

795
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:38,830
is just work.

796
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:42,880
Send me the information about Yuyi.

797
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:45,240
I'll go and meet Ms. Tong next time.

798
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:49,030
How about I go?

799
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:51,590
I'll go.

800
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,710
Mom, I'm sorry.

801
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:34,190
Peter.

802
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:35,440
I didn't

803
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,710
forbid you from reading foreign books.

804
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:37,710
But your priority

805
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:38,630
is to learn Chinese.

806
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,590
Your Chinese is so bad.

807
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:42,190
Mom.

808
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:43,980
Why should I learn Chinese?

809
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:45,530
My baby.

810
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,510
Because you're Chinese.

811
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:48,540
So

812
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,470
it's just

813
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:50,940
for this reason?

814
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,430
Baby.

815
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:57,750
Language is not only a tool,

816
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,400
but also a kind of thinking

817
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,790
and culture.

818
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:03,050
When you learn one more language,

819
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:05,510
you can know one more world.

820
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:06,830
Understood?

821
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:08,790
Okay, Mom.

822
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:10,700
I'll learn Chinese.

823
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,070
My son is the best.

824
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:16,350
Drink the milk and go to bed.

825
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:17,020
Good boy.

826
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:27,760
Hello, Ma.

827
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:28,870
Ms. Tong.

828
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:30,550
Mr. Xiao just called me.

829
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:31,720
He asked me to go to Shandong

830
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,360
for the dialect research tomorrow.

831
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,520
I remember the company

832
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:36,190
asked Sun Ming to go.

833
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:38,660
As you know,

834
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,360
I just have a girlfriend.

835
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:41,990
I'm a programmer who's in my thirties.

836
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:43,550
I finally found a wife.

837
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:45,270
Can you discuss it

838
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:46,310
with Mr. Xiao?

839
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:47,510
No need.

840
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:49,030
I can make a decision on this.

841
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:50,550
Thank you.

842
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,260
Thank you, Ms. Tong.

843
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,280
Ma, I should thank you.

844
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:56,090
It's okay. Go to sleep.

845
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:02,830
Xiao Yicheng.

846
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,260
I finally knew your heart

847
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,390
in this test.

848
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:25,470
Papa.

849
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,550
Let's go.

850
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:45,850
♫Probe and approach with memories♫

851
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:52,800

Love me.

867

♫I'm sure♫

873
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:29,750
