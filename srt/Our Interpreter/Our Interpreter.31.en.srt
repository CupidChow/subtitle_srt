120
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,110

121

You...

124
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,950
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

125
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,630
What's the use of telling you?

126
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,550
Your solution at that moment

127
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:59,220
was to tell me

128
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,800

136
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,990
What does that mean?

137
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,190
It means I'm not that indispensable

138
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,870

139
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,950

Nothing.

145
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,510
You can't fool me.

146
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:05,230
Today,

147
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,470
I left the bridal shop

148
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,430
in a hurry.

149
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:12,910
I'm sorry.

150
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,510
You don't have to apologize to me.

151
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,030
I know

152
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,310
you don't like it that way.

153
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,110
I understand.

154
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,670
Marriage is a big deal in life.

155
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,990
I've been too perfunctory about it.

156

160

become competitors.

161
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,230
So what?

162
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:58,670
Lu Keli is in charge

163
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,030
of this project now.

164
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,870
He told me this afternoon

165
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,070
that there would be a video meeting this evening.

166
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,510
So I felt anxious.

167
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,350
That's why I called you again and again

168
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,590
to hurry you.

169
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,310
When you called me,

170
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,310
I was at the Consumer Products Expo.

171
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:13,910
I know.

172
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,470
I heard them

173
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,510
talking next to you on the phone.

174
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,790
So, this was the reason

175
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,420
why you were absent-minded

176
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,510
and left early?

177
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,430
Maybe.

178
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,870
And maybe not.

179
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:34,310
Anyway,

180
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,310
I'm just not interested

181
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:38,240
in the wedding stuff.

182
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,550
And

183
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,150
I shouldn't

184
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,950
have brought my emotions at work

185
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,310
to life

186
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,830
and affected our mood.

187
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,750
I just feel a little annoyed.

188
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,270
Everything is

189
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,750
mixed up.

190
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:56,430
Sorry.

191
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:01,830
You know what?

192
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:03,950
I'm very happy.

193
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,070
Really.

194
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:07,670
I really like it when

195
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,830
you take it out on me.

196
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,180
You finally stopped

197
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,110
separating your affairs clearly

198
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,910
from mine.

199
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,470
So,

200
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,380
I'll accept

201
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,910
all your temper in the future.

202
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,470
Okay?

203
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,370
How about this?

204
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,430
Let's make some ground rules.

205
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,630
Let's not talk about work

206
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,190
after work.

207
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:43,070
And let's not bring

208
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,990
the emotions at work

209
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,320
into our relationship.

210
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:49,520
Pinky swear.

211
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,110
Pinky swear.

212
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:53,030
I promise you.

213
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:53,950
Sealed.

214
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,190
Let's go in and check it out.

215
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,140
No need.

216
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:27,130
Just think of it as doing it for me.

217
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,070
Let's go.

218
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,790
I'll go take a call.

219
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,070
Your legs look very long

220
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,710
in this pair of shoes.

221
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,430
Besides,

222
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,430
I've never seen anyone

223
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,030
look so beautiful in these.

224
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,510
A suitable pair of shoes

225
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,910
is rare to meet.

226
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:24,700
Every girl wants

227
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,430
her own pair of glass slippers.

228
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,190
Forget it.

229
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,630
There are not many occasions

230
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:32,550
where I can wear them.

231
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,750
They're not very practical.

232
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,630
But

233
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,430
your boyfriend has paid.

234
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,540
How much was it? I'll transfer the money to you.

235
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,270
No need.

236
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,790
This is a gift.

237
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:52,310
Why?

238
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:53,670
In the past,

239
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:54,470
I never knew

240
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,630
what you like.

241
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,960
I've never given you

242
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,110
a gift you like.

243
00:13:58,950 --> 00:13:59,950
I wasn't

244
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:00,830
a good boyfriend.

245
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:02,230
We've broken up.

246
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:06,360
We're just colleagues now.

247
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:07,710
I can't accept

248
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,510
such an expensive gift from you.

249
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,870
Consider it

250
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:13,230
as a gift for you.

251
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,030
If this is a breakup gift,

252
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,510
I can accept it.

253
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,310
But if you think

254
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,070
something may happen

255
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,430
after I accept it,

256
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,510
I won't take it.

257
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:39,680
You can do whatever you want with these shoes.

258
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,070
As you wish.

259
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:55,690
Accept the shoes.

260
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:00,740
♫Love remembers♫

261
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:04,400
♫It finds you and I again♫

262
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,620
♫The breeze brushes past the sunset♫

263
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,480
♫You look at me♫

264
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,420
♫Until the shadows melt into the galaxy♫

265
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,690
♫I'll hold your hand again♫

266
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:18,930
♫Gazing into each other's eyes♫

267
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:22,860
♫Happiness is that I now have♫

268
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:30,380
♫To the future with you♫

269
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,710
I'm really happy

270
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,630
today.

271
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:50,070
Okay, my treat next time.

272
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,070
Okay. Okay.

273
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:56,790
Shasha.

274
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,190
What's wrong?

275
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:01,550
Why are you sitting outside?

276
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,590
What happened? Who did you wrong?

277
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,030
Baby.

278
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:08,710
What happened?

279
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,110
Nothing, Mommy.

280
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,220
Is it because of that boyfriend of yours,

281
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:17,990
Wei Tian?

282
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,950
Don't mention him to me again.

283
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:42,830
Mommy.

284
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:43,790
Baby.

285
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,630
I heated some milk for you.

286
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:46,790
Drink it.

287
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,070
Baby.

288
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,590
You and Wei Tian...

289
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,990
Mommy, don't worry.

290
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,990
We've broken up.

291
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:03,950
I know

292
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:05,869
you must be very sad now.

293
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,599
It's better to just get the pain over with.

294
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,069
Baby.

295
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,550
You have to remember that

296
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,440
growing up must be accompanied by pain.

297
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,990
After you get through this

298
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,470
and when you look back,

299
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,990
you'll realize that all experiences are wealth.

300
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:23,790
Understand?

301
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,430
I do.

302
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,069
I'm really okay.

303
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,310
I trust you.

304
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,910
If you want to talk,

305
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,310
I'm available anytime.

306
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:36,720
Okay.

307
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,300
Sleep early.

308
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:45,910
Okay.

309
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,110
Mommy.

310
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,410
♫It's like a dream♫

311
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:23,990
♫The years of misunderstanding♫

312
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:31,070
♫Before realizing it, we've stopped moving forward♫

313
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:36,390
♫We struggle, feel confused, and have regrets♫

314
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,710
♫I have to tell white lies♫

315
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:45,690
♫So that you can fly high in the sky♫

316
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:41,830
Tian.

317
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:43,830
Hurry.

318
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,110
Tian, take a seat.

319
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:49,080
♫The path of turning back♫

320
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,350
Leave it to me.

321
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:53,160
♫It tests for yearning with reunion♫

322
00:18:54,570 --> 00:19:00,160
♫How can time express the way I miss you♫

323
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,420
♫When the knot in my heart is removed♫

324
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:08,250
♫I smile and answer with my eyes♫

325
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,000
♫In a daze, time seems to shorten♫

326
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,310
♫My heart melts the distance♫

327
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:18,900
♫Love remembers♫

328
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:22,510
♫Us from before♫

329
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:25,530
♫The love I miss is unique♫

330
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:28,050
♫After wandering♫

331
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,380
♫Still vaguely like yesterday♫

332
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,850
♫There will always be wind♫

333
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:36,580
♫Blowing away my blues♫

334
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:40,570
♫I see your clear features again♫

335
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:47,070
♫Like stars illuminating the night sky♫

336
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,310
Mommy.

337
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:48,510
I'm full.

338
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,230
Well, Shasha.

339
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:51,590
What's wrong?

340
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,590
Are you free later?

341
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:56,550
Go have a cup of coffee with me.

342
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:01,510
Mommy, I'm really fine.

343
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:02,350
I can handle

344
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,610
my own affairs myself.

345
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,150
I know.

346
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:11,190
It's just your aunt's family

347
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:13,990
and Xiao Yicheng are coming to talk about their marriage.

348
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:15,510
I don't want to be here.

349
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:20,390
Okay.

350
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,230
I'll get changed.

351
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,550
Why don't you go in?

352
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,650
I haven't been back for a long time.

353
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:19,670
Let's go.

354
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:20,710
Let's go in.

355
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,430
-You…
-Wenli.

356
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,630
You go first.

357
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,990
Are you feeling better?

358
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:53,440
The doctor said

359
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,770
I just need to pay attention to nutrition.

360
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:01,990
Dad.

361
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,200
You're here.

362
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:05,830
Dad.

363
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:08,990
Dad.

364
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:09,870
This

365
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,310
is the finest Cordyceps.

366
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,230
Wenli

367
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,580
specially asked someone to buy it for you.

368
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,830
Look, it must have cost you a lot.

369
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:16,630
Not at all.

370
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:17,870
It's all right.

371
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,550
My mom was conferred the title of excellent teacher.

372
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,470
There's a bonus.

373
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:22,000
She bought it with that bonus.

374
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,270
You don't have to stand on ceremony

375
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,470
coming back home.

376
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,610
Don't buy things for me next time.

377
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,150
Coming.

378
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,350
Professor Gao asked me

379
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,200
to buy candied dates early in the morning.

380
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:34,910
He said

381
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:36,630
you've loved this since you were a kid, Wenli.

382
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:37,990
Did you put rock candy in it?

383
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:38,510
Yes.

384
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,240
I made it

385
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,040
all according to Wenli's taste.

386
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,110
Thank you, Dad.

387
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:45,590
Wenli, have a sip.

388
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:58,390
It's the taste of childhood, right?

389
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:07,750
I'll try it too.

390
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:12,550
Dad.

391
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:13,590
Today,

392
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:14,710
we're mainly here

393
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:16,790
to talk about the kids' affair with the Xiao family.

394
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,590
Before, Yicheng's parents

395
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:19,510
said they were going

396
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:21,150
to our hometown for marriage proposal.

397
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,430
But Wenli thought

398
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:23,540
it'd be a waste of their time

399
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,750
to make that trip.

400
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:25,710
Yes.

401
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:26,920
Moreover,

402
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,720
you are the elder of our family.

403
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:31,390
I think

404
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,310
it's the most appropriate

405
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:35,270
and the best to talk about Xixi's marriage here at your place.

406
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,310
It's good.

407
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:38,590
The Xiao family

408
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,230
are honest and kind.

409
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:43,070
We should treat them well.

410
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,350
And Xi,

411
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,590
you must control

412
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,950
your bad temper.

413
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:50,790
No matter how bad-tempered I am,

414
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:52,120
I got it from you, right?

415
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:53,190
Look.

416
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,550
Look how petty she is.

417
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:55,670
So vindictive.

418
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:56,790
Professor Gao.

419
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:58,880
Mr. Xiao and Mrs. Xiao are here.

420
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,550
Come on. Come on.

421
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:01,550
Have a seat.

422
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:02,750
Go make coffee.

423
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:03,810
Professor Gao.

424
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:04,730
Professor Gao.

425
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,070
Uncle, Auntie.

426
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:06,710
Auntie.

427
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:07,630
Hello. Hello.

428
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:08,230
You're here.

429
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,830
-Come on. Have a seat.
-Okay.

430
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,350
Professor Gao.

431
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:17,670
We are here

432
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,440
with a mission today.

433
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:20,790
Let's cut to the chase.

434
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:23,470
It's a blessing for the Xiao family

435
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:24,950
that Xixi is willing

436
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,710
to marry Yicheng.

437
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:27,510
So,

438
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:29,390
we prepared a gift

439
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:32,110
as a little something

440
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:34,030
for our future daughter-in-law.

441
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:34,590
Here.

442
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,670
This is too much.

443
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,850
You gave us such an expensive gift.

444
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,590
You don't think

445
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,390
I'm selling my daughter, do you?

446
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,990
Mr. Lin, you must be joking.

447
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:56,000
They are both the only child of our families.

448
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,680
Think of it as

449
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:59,390
a gift

450
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,990
prepared for our future grandson and granddaughter.

451
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:03,070
Now our country has issued the three-child policy.

452
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:06,150
The gift isn't enough to be divided among three children.

453
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,110
This kid.

454
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,150
With me as their grandfather,

455
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:10,190
are you worried that

456
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:12,390
the three of them won't be treated well?

457
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:14,350
Lin, you haven't drunk yet.

458
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:15,300
Yet you've started to talk nonsense.

459
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:15,790
Look.

460
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,150
You made my precious daughter

461
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:17,950
blush.

462
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:19,950
This is rare.

463
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,430
No more jokes.

464
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:23,070
If she doesn't want to get married,

465
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,000
I'll be screwed.

466
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:41,750
Mommy.

467
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:47,180
If you have something to say, go ahead.

468
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,830
You have a personality,

469
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,670
but you're not sharp-edged.

470
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:54,150
But every time

471
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:55,590
when it comes to Aunt,

472
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:57,470
you become

473
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,550
mean and bitter.

474
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,230
Especially today.

475
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:04,750
You knew

476
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,430
Aunt and her family were coming,

477
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:07,740
yet you took me out.

478
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,870
It's not the right way to treat guests.

479
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:12,430
Once their family comes,

480
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,070
your grandpa

481
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,630
can't see me anymore.

482
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:19,470
I'll only be standing in their way if I stay at home.

483
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:20,830
No, Mommy.

484
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,510
Why would you think so?

485
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:24,510
Grandpa loves us.

486
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:27,030
That's because you didn't see

487
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,670
how good he is to your aunt.

488
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:31,030
Your aunt has always been

489
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:32,560
the pride of our Gao family.

490
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,750
She's smart, pretty, talented,

491
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:35,950
and graceful.

492
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,630
But this daughter

493
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:39,150
who he was so proud of

494
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,790
ended up abandoning our family

495
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,270
in order to marry a poor guy.

496
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:44,470
That's why your grandpa was so angry.

497
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:47,470
He's got tough love for her.

498
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:50,350
But after 30 years,

499
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,550
as soon as your aunt came back,

500
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:55,000
your grandpa became biased again.

501
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,560
I've been a filial daughter

502
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:59,670
for 30 years for nothing.

503
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,150
Mommy.

504
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,070
[Dad]

505
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:10,950
Answer it.

506
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,030
Dad.

507
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,830
You've been hiding all day.

508
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,090
It's time to come back.

509
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:23,960
What are you talking about?

510
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:24,870
Shasha and I

511
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:26,930
are looking up information outside.

512
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,350
Come back.

513
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:30,830
We'll wait up for you for dinner.

514
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:37,310
They've left?

515
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,990
Auntie Wang made soup for Shasha

516
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,470
and your favorite ginger duck stew.

517
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:46,430
Come back.

518
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,510
See?

519
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:56,710
Grandpa still cares about us.

520
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:59,580
Let’s go home.

521
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:10,830
Ling, come here.

522
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:11,950
We've been waiting for you.

523
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:13,110
Aunt. Uncle.

524
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:13,750
Xixi.

525
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,390
Where is Mr. Xiao?

526
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,510
Something came up,

527
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:20,280
so Mr. Xiao and his family left.

528
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:21,670
Don't call him

529
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:22,950
Mr. Xiao anymore.

530
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,270
We are family.

531
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,730
Call him brother-in-law.

532
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:28,710
Dad.

533
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:30,390
I was just about to

534
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:31,390
call Shujun back.

535
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:32,450
You guys eat first.

536
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:33,950
Don't go.

537
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,810
I said we've been waiting for you.

538
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:36,950
-Yes.
-Sit down.

539
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:37,480
Gao Ling.

540
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,070
Look, Dad

541
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:40,630
opened a bottle of fine wine today.

542
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:41,750
We don't know much about wine.

543
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:42,910
So, sit down

544
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:44,040
and tell us about it.

545
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:44,870
Sit down.

546
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,110
Have a seat.

547
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:54,440
I'm already 80 years old.

548
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:56,430
I've waited for 30 years

549
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,990
before the three of us

550
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,910
could sit down and have dinner together.

551
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:00,230
Yes.

552
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:00,960
We don't know

553
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,510
when the next time will be.

554
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,630
-Yes.
-Sit down.

555
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:05,110
-Yes.
-Have a seat.

556
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,710
Today

557
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:11,910
is the day

558
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:13,310
when the Gao family reunites.

559
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,430
It's also when

560
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:15,590
Xixi got engaged.

561
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:16,790
This is

562
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:18,790
a good day with double happy events.

563
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:20,350
I'll drink up first.

564
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,670
Since today is a good day,

565
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:29,070
and since everyone is here,

566
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,470
let's not let it pass

567
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:32,110
without knowing any better.

568
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,710
Actually, I've always wanted to know

569
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:38,710
why the book my mom translated

570
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,440
doesn't have her name on it?

571
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:42,550
Xixi.

572
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,510
It’s all in the past.

573
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,600
It's in the past for you,

574
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:47,750
but not for me.

575
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:48,440
Xixi.

576
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:49,510
It’s inappropriate to talk about this today.

577
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:50,300
No, no.

578
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,890
This matter has to be explained

579
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:55,030
sooner or later.

580
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:56,350
Dad.

581
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:58,790
Xixi.

582
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,470
Here's the thing.

583
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:03,590
Back then, when your mother

584
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:05,550
wanted to marry your father,

585
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:07,870
I was very against it.

586
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:10,390
We had a huge fight.

587
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:10,920
Dad...

588
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:13,470
When this book was published,

589
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,870
your mother wanted to run away from home.

590
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:18,630
The editor

591
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:19,950
misunderstood me

592
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,630
and deleted your mom's name

593
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,030
without

594
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,030
my permission.

595
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:26,590
The day you ran away from home,

596
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:29,150
Dad was hospitalized.

597
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,550
I spent two days in the hospital

598
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:34,070
with Dad.

599
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,350
We only got to know this

600
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,110
after Dad was discharged.

601
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:41,510
But the book

602
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:43,510
had been published.

603
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,230
Dad and I

604
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:50,150
never wanted

605
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:51,990
to plagiarize your signature.

606
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:54,070
But at that time,

607
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:56,150
we couldn't find you.

608
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:59,030
As time goes by,

609
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:01,430
we just left the mistake there as it was.

610
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:04,190
Xixi.

611
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:07,820
I never thought about

612
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:10,470
taking away what belongs to your mom.

613
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:12,910
It's good that

614
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,990
we got things out in the open today.

615
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,710
In fact,

616
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,830
this is exactly what happened back then.

617
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:21,190
Believe it or not,

618
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:23,150
this is the truth.

619
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:28,190
Wenli.

620
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,950
I was blinded

621
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:32,000
back then and this happened.

622
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:35,190
You made the right choice.

623
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,790
Dayong is a good man.

624
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,630
Can you forgive me?

625
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:45,990
Dad.

626
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:47,680
What are you talking about?

627
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:49,070
We are family.

628
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:51,470
There's no need to talk about forgiveness.

629
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,550
We also handled it the wrong way.

630
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:55,510
We let you down.

631
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:57,070
Please forgive Wenli and I

632
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,430
for being willful.

633
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:09,710
Dad.

634
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,350
Ling.

635
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,030
Sit down.

636
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,230
Ling.

637
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:37,070
You two are

638
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,750
equally important in my heart.

639
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,510
You are both excellent.

640
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,480
You two are not competitors,

641
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:46,310
but next of kin.

642
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:50,470
I also want to make an apology

643
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:51,590
to you.

644
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,950
I mistakenly thought that

645
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:55,590
praising the strong

646
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,630
is a way to urge and

647
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:58,790
encourage the weak.

648
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:02,630
But I didn't expect

649
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:04,350
I'd hurt your pride that way.

650
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:06,470
It's not fair for you.

651
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:09,270
Please forgive me.

652
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,190
Forgive me, Ling.

653
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,190
Dad.

654
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,150
Forgive me.

655
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:26,920
Sister.

656
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:28,710
Ling.

657
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:08,670
What are you thinking?

658
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,530
You didn't even hear me knocking.

659
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:21,389
You really broke up with Wei?

660
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:29,030
Do you still love him?

661
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:39,199
So it's because Aunt didn't agree?

662
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:46,030
If it's just Mommy's objection,

663
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:49,550
I can still fight for it.

664
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,690
Just like what Aunt did back then.

665
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,030
But it was really too painful

666
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:57,750
getting along with him.

667
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,400
We both suppressed our preferences

668
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,030
to cater to each other.

669
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:04,670
Lin Xi.

670
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:06,950
When two people are together,

671
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:08,710
it should be sweet and happy

672
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:11,150
instead of feeling like walking on eggs,

673
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:11,790
right?

674
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:16,150
No one in this world

675
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:18,610
is completely suitable for another person.

676
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,280
Look at me and Xiao Yicheng,

677
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:21,510
and my parents.

678
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,830
Whether from the aspect of personality

679
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,230
background,

680
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,550
or even life experiences,

681
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:28,010
we are all very different.

682
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:29,830
But we can be together.

683
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:30,590
Then why

684
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,920
can't you and Wei be together?

685
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,630
I'm not confident,

686
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:35,430
either in him

687
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,070
or myself.

688
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,510
Do you remember

689
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:44,350
that old-fashioned wall clock

690
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,630
in Grandpa's study?

691
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:48,190
Yes.

692
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:49,790
It's Grandma's dowry.

693
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,670
In the past,

694
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:58,190
when things were broken,

695
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,590
people would think about

696
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:01,960
how to fix it.

697
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:04,390
But now,

698
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:05,630
when something's broken,

699
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,750
we only think about

700
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:08,950
buying a new one.

701
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:09,550
Maybe I should throw this one away

702
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:10,510
and get a new one.

703
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:12,710
But who can guarantee

704
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:13,390
that new things

705
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:14,750
will never break?

706
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:19,110
But

707
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:21,390
I don't know how to fix it.

708
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:25,030
As for how,

709
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:27,970
fix it with your heart.

710
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,430
As long as you put your heart into it,

711
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:30,990
you will find a way.

712
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:33,070
Besides,

713
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,670
Xiao Yicheng and I are here.

714
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:36,150
We will definitely help you

715
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,990
fix Wei well.

716
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:14,470
Manager Wei.

717
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,950
Can I have a word with you?

718
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:29,190
What's wrong, Shasha?

719
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,470
I think I've made myself

720
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:32,870
very clear that day.

721
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:33,510
Besides,

722
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:35,150
you already gave me a breakup gift.

723
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,480
What do you mean by this?

724
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:38,510
What...

725
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:39,670
What do you mean?

726
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:40,910
Wei Tian.

727
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:42,350
Things won't work out between us.

728
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:44,190
Stop sending me gifts.

729
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:49,720
These flowers

730
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:52,150
are not from me.

731
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:55,150
They're not from you?

732
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:04,270
Maybe you should read...

733
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:11,310
Dear VIP customer,

734
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:13,390
Mr. Wang Qiang.

735
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:17,790
Right?

736
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:24,550
Shasha.

737
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:26,360
Why are you holding my flowers?

738
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,940
Your flowers look nice,

739
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:32,090
so I thought I'd arrange them for you.

740
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:34,790
I was on my way to get some water.

741
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:35,710
Water?

742
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:37,510
Where is your cup?

743
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,190
I'll go get it now.

744
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:40,130
I'll get it now.

745
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:42,350
Here.

746
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:44,870
Did you

747
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:45,990
peep at my card?

748
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:47,510
No, no, no.

749
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:48,790
But

750
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:50,110
why did you put this

751
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:51,280
on my desk?

752
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:53,710
I just got my new vase

753
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:55,350
from downstairs.

754
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:57,310
I saw no one was at your desk,

755
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:59,030
so I put the flowers there temporarily.

756
00:38:59,030 --> 00:38:59,910
I'm sorry.

757
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:01,230
It's okay.

758
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:02,750
You can arrange the flowers.

759
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:03,950
I'm leaving.

760
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:36,040
[Wei Tian]

761
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,750
Sorry.

762
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:45,570
[Sorry.]

763
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:46,470
[Wei Tian]

764
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:02,060
I heard

765
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:04,860
the Consumer Products Expo people are here today.

766
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:07,070
I saw Mr. Zhang

767
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:08,670
went in with Director Dong.

768
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:13,120
Director Dong came here in person?

769
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:16,110
This should be

770
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:17,070
his last term.

771
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:19,150
So he'd treat it with extra care.

772
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:21,800
Do you want to say hello?

773
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:25,830
You worked so hard to get

774
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:27,630
Director Dong back then.

775
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:31,390
Lu Keli

776
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,590
is in charge of this project this year.

777
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:35,030
So I'll be minding my own idle business.

778
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:46,590
What should we have for lunch?

779
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:47,710
Japanese food.

780
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:51,090
We thought the same thing.

781
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,150
I have an urgent task.

782
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:53,870
I'm not going.

783
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:54,830
I'll order a takeout.

784
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:56,510
What urgent task do you have?

785
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:57,100
Besides,

786
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,430
takeout food is not nutritious.

787
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:00,090
-Exactly.
-Let's go, Shasha.

788
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:02,030
Takeout food is not nutritious indeed.

789
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:03,150
You go for lunch.

790
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:04,350
I'm going to work out.

791
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:09,070
Look.

792
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:10,430
This area

793
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,220
is the office area

794
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,300
of the priority client management department.

795
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,270
These people

796
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:16,520
are all interpreters and translators

797
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:18,410
who've been on many big projects.

798
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:21,550
Director Dong.

799
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:22,960
This is Cheng Yao.

800
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:24,750
Hello, Director Dong.

801
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:25,380
Hello.

802
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:26,830
He is

803
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:28,950
known as the guru of minority languages

804
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:30,350
in Huasheng.

805
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:33,830
He's proficient in multiple languages,

806
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,630
such as Spanish, French, German, Russian, and so on.

807
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:38,030
Cheng Yao has been

808
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,190
an important member

809
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:40,470
of Yuyi's listing projects since he joined us.

810
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:41,910
He also worked as

811
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,760
the chief interpreter

812
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:45,350
in many minority language press conferences.

813
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:46,550
There're so many talents

814
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:48,070
in Huasheng.

815
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,990
You flatter us, Director.

816
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:51,750
It's mainly because Xi trained us well.

817
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:52,550
Right.

818
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:54,190
Why isn't Lin Xi here?

819
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:58,630
If you ask me,

820
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:00,470
the most promising person in Huasheng

821
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:01,400
is Lin Xi.

822
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:04,350
She's bold, smart,

823
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:05,320
and meticulous.

824
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:08,390
What? Is she not in the office today?

825
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:09,790
She's busy with a project.

826
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:10,670
No matter how busy she is,

827
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:11,750
she has to eat.

828
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:13,470
Jiakang.

829
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:15,480
Ask Lin to join us

830
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:16,750
for lunch.

831
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:18,350
I also want to hear her opinion.

832
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:18,990
Okay.

833
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:21,070
Ask Lin Xi to join us later.

834
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:21,790
Got it.

835
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:22,990
Here, Director Dong.

836
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:24,310
This way, please.

837
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:24,790
Please.

838
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:25,430
Okay.

839
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:32,060
Be careful.

840
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:33,630
Yes.

841
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,310
When you punch,

842
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:35,670
focus on the target.

843
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:36,590
Come on.

844
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:38,030
Again.

845
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:40,030
Good.

846
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:41,470
Come on, focus on the target.

847
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:42,750
Okay.

848
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,510
Are you jealous?

849
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,510
Of course not.

850
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:50,430
You are jealous.

851
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:51,110
No.

852
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:51,710
Yes you are.

853
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:52,670
Sit down. Okay.

854
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,030
You are jealous.

855
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,070
No. Come on.

856
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:56,550
Sit down. I'll teach you.

857
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:00,270
Tell me if you're jealous.

858
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:01,030
No.

859
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:03,910
Handsome.

860
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:05,820
You came alone today.

861
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:08,360
Your girlfriend didn't come with you?

862
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:10,750
Practice by yourself.

863
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:11,670
I'll work over there.

864
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:12,390
Wait.

865
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:14,390
Are you busy?

866
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:17,110
Not really at the moment.

867
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:19,110
Practice with me for a while.

868
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:20,990
Okay.

869
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:21,990
Let's go.

870
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:43,510
Hey.

871
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:47,050
Friendship first, competition second.

872
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:48,190
Be gentle.

873
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:53,930
[City of Burning]

874
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:50,710
Sorry.

875
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:51,750
Again.

876
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,550
Good.

877
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:12,870
Go on.

878
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:31,830
Bro.

879
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:33,270
Is it because

880
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:34,470
you're still angry at me

881
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:35,580
for hitting on your girlfriend last time?

882
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:37,070
Do you want to kill me?

883
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:40,910
Sorry.

884
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:42,790
I'll be more gentle.

885
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:44,470
I have classes later.

886
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:46,390
Punch the sandbag yourself.

887
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:04,510
Director Dong, you're welcome

888
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:05,550
to come to our company often

889
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:06,710
and give us instructions.

890
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:07,470
Yes.

891
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:09,190
We will

892
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:10,710
actively participate in

893
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:13,070
the bidding for the Consumer Products Expo project this time.

894
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:14,070
Lin Xi.

895
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:17,180
I'm looking forward to seeing you

896
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:18,360
in the bidding team.

897
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:23,390
Please.

898
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:23,990
Please.
