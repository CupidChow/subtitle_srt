Goodbye, Grandma.

12
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,830
How did I do?

13
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,320
I did well today, didn't I?

14
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,520
You did very well.

15
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,680
Then,

16
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,220

You can't go back on your word.

00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,110
We agreed

20
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,530
that I'd be your spy

21
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,090
and you'd buy me ice cream.

22
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,310
Didn't you get anything today?

23
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,150
All right. All right.

24
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,590
But you're leaving just like this?

25
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,990
I don't want to push my luck.

26
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,670
Papa.

27
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,190
You're excellent,

28
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,030
but that guy

29
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,160
is hanging around Aunt Xixi every day.

30
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,230
I have you.

31
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,110
I have to go to school during the day.

32

I can't help you

33

34
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,190

35
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,230
You can't get a wife this way.

36

What are you talking about?

37
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,670
I'm really worried about you.

38
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:57,910
Sir,

39
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,110
this house is great, isn't it?

40
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,150
Yes, it is.

41
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,670
But the price is too high.

42
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,070
Let me think about it.

43
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:03,750
Sir,

44
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,520
you get what you pay for.

45
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,990
Buying a house is not a small matter.

46
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,190
Don't worry about me.

47
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,030
I have an idea.

48
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:11,560
Let's go.

49
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,550
What's it?

50
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,210
I'm not telling you.

51

52

55
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:29,940
I forgot to tell you.

56
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,290
I'm on a business trip.

57
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,170
Your dad's birthday is next week?

58
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,510
Then, as usual,

59
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,829
I'll visit him with two bottles of wine.

60
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:38,990
By the way,

61
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,430
my mom asked me when we'd get married.

62
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,430
You need to

63
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,630
make it clear to them.

64
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,990
Okay, that's it.

65
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:48,590

68

Was that your girlfriend?

69
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,350
When did you start a relationship?

70
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,890
You never mentioned that.

71
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,830
About half a year ago.

72
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,310
She's even busier than me.

73
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,110
I don't get to see her very often.

74
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,560
Are you still feeling uncomfortable?

75
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,430
I'm fine.

76
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,350
You said

77
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,430
you wanted to tell me something.

78
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,190
What was it?

79
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,040
N-Nothing.

80
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,350
You heard me wrong.

81
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,190
Impossible.

82
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,710
I was a scout.

83
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:32,950
I have sharp ears.

84
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,470
You said

85
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:39,830
there had been something

86
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:40,150
you wanted to tell me for ten years…

87
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,070
I remember now.

88
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:44,909
I want to thank you

89
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,680
and treat you to dinner after we go back to Xiahai.

90

N-No, thanks.

93
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,870
Let me carry you.

94
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:01,630
It's okay.

95
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,720
I'm not tired.

96
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,390
Are you okay?

Why didn't you

101
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:26,550
come with us

102
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,750
to the party held by Charlie's company?

103
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,750
You went to

104
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,150

105
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:32,950
Yes.

106
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,070

107
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,270
to join us.

108
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,470

for a conference call,

110
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,350
so he couldn't go.

111

Shasha.

112
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:45,950
You look unwell.

113
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:46,909
Are you okay?

114
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,380
I'm fine.

115
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,430
I'm going back.

116
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,540
So he didn't ask me out for dinner

117
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,350
because he cared about me.

118
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:09,470
By the way,

119
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,880
my mom asked me when we'd get married.

120
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,790
You need to

121
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,990
make it clear to them.

122
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,590
Are you okay?

123
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:58,790
Yes.

124
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,270
I can leave on time

You just stay in the hotel

131

After you're done, go over them with Lin Xi.

139
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,470
I've double-checked your plane tickets.

140
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,030
Okay.

141
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,030

Anyone can tell

165
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,230
they're different vegetables.

166
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,590
How did you translate them?

167
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:29,750
You used the same word for all of them.

168
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,830
Are you crazy?

169
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,190
Sorry, Xi.

00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,309

You thought, you thought.

177
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,110
You say that all the time.

00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:23,350
Why…

197
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,790
Why can't I get it back?

198
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,590
Why can't I get it back?

199
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:44,900
[Priority Client Director]

200
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:51,430
Here.

201
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:55,030
First of all, let's celebrate

202
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,630
the victorious return of our colleagues

203
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,990
from the Agricultural Product Trade Exhibition.

204
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,990
Our client

205
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,110
was very satisfied.

206
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:00,710
Cheers.

207
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:07,310
How was it?

208
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,590
What did you learn from the trip to the Agricultural Product Trade Exhibition?

209
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:11,670
I learned something.

210
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:14,550
It seems Wei Tian

211
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,480
is more suitable to be your mentor.

212
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,030
Next,

213
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,830
you'll focus on

214
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,510
Professor Chen Ji's medical thesis.

215
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,710
Yuyi will assist you.

216
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,320
I've sent him the first draft.

217
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,580
I'm waiting for Professor Chen's reply.

218
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,100
Just keep on schedule.

219
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,070
I heard that you stood out among the bidders

220
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,220
for Yuyi's project.

221
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,690
Congratulations.

222
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:34,850
I'm not surprised.

223
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,590
Xi took personal charge of it.

224
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:37,990
Of course she won the bid.

225
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,630
Thank you.

226
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,110
Actually, the other bidders

227
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:48,390
were competitive too.

228
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,670
However,

229
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,690
they all lost for the same reason.

230
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:53,830
What's it?

231
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,420
They didn't realize

232
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,590
how ambitious Yuyi was.

233
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,910
In Xiao Yicheng's mind,

234
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:03,240
Yuyi won't just have translator devices.

235
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:04,710
Yes.

236
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:06,110
They've been increasing the number

237
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,270
of minority languages their services cover

238
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,400
and venturing into many other fields.

239
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,150
That's right.

240
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,130
I'll go order something else.

241
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,630
Me too.

242
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,540
Tian.

243
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:26,750
You have to help me.

244
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:29,390
What's wrong?

245
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,910
You're in trouble again?

246
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,340
I…

247
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,550
I made a careless mistake.

248
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,670
Xi docked all my merit pay

249
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,070
this month.

250
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,510
That's the company's rule.

251
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:47,830
You have to admit your mistake.

252
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,310
I know.

253
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,270
I was wrong, and I admit it.

254
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,590
B-But I'm having a tough time.

255
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,740
I'm still an intern.

256
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,270
My salary is not high.

257
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,790
After paying the rent,

258
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,990
I have to live off the merit pay.

259
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:03,990
It's all docked now.

260
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:06,270
W-What should I do?

261
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,830
Well…

262
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,110
Please ask Xi

263
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,240
to cut me some slack.

264
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,350
I promise

265
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,810
to work hard in the future.

266
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:20,550
Or she can dock the money in installments.

267
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,670
If she insists…

268
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,430
Fine.

269
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,310
I get it.

270
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,030
Thank you, Tian.

271
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:37,780
Let's go.

272
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,200
Tian.

273
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,830
Remember to talk to Xi for me.

274
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:41,390
Okay.

275
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:42,850
-Thank you.
-Don't worry.

276
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:02,750
Lin Xi.

277
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:04,870
Your bag.

278
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:06,630
Thank you.

279
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:09,150
Did you dock Chen Wen's merit pay?

280
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,880
She complained to you just now?

281
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,110
She almost cried,

282
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,590
saying she wouldn't even have money to buy food next month.

283
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:20,990
What's the use of crying?

284
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,190
If I cry to the clients,

285
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,670
will they pay me more?

286
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,960
I've given her so many chances.

287
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,370
Since she joined the firm,

288
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,830
how many rookie mistakes has she made?

289
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,150
According to the company rules,

290
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,230
I should've docked her pay a long time ago,

291
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,430
but I never did.

292
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,950
That document was very important,

293
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,190
yet she didn't take it seriously

294
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:42,120
and just wanted to get it over with.

295
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,600
She's just young and inexperienced.

296
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,830
Give her some pointers.

297
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:47,910
God.

298
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,910
I'm her superior, not her teacher.

299
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:50,590
I can't guide her

300
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,950
around the clock.

301
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,750
Besides, this time,

302
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:55,430
she was not qualified

303
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,950
to participate in Yuyi's project.

304
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,350
But I cut her in, didn't I?

305
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:01,050
From an assistant to an interpreter,

306
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,070
she has to rely on herself,

307
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,150
not on me.

308
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,390
After she becomes a regular employee,

309
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,720
her salary will double.

310
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,110
Okay.

311
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,870
I'll tell her what you said.

312
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:14,350
When she really can't afford food,

313
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,810
I hope you won't regret it.

314
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,480
Check your Alipay account.

315
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,510
You'll buy her three meals every day

316
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,430
this month.

317
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,390
Don't tell her I paid you.

318
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:33,830
Meals

319
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,150
don't cost so much.

320
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,390
Girls like milk tea.

321
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,390
They can't survive a day without it.

322
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,510
Who's making all that noise?

323
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,870
It's early in the morning, and I was sleeping.

324
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:03,510
I heard that the house next door has been rented out.

325
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:06,390
The landlord asked for a hell of a lot for the rent.

326
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,510
He said,

327
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:08,950
"If you can't afford

328
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,430
the rent,

329
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,670
you don't deserve

330
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,400
to live in this neighborhood."

331
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:17,200
So he'd rather let it be empty for years than lower the rent.

332
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,870
It takes all sorts to make a world,

333
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:20,590
Grandma.

334
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,270
Coming.

335
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:30,990
What are you doing here?

336
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,270
It's you again.

337
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,550
A gift from your new neighbor.

338
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,870
New neighbor?

339
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,790
I just moved here.

340
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,150
We're neighbors now.

341
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:44,750
X-Xiao Yicheng.

342
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,750
Have you moved here with the purpose

343
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,950
of disturbing Lin Xi?

344
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,310
No.

345
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:51,030
It's expensive to live in the serviced apartment,

346
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,760
and it's far from my workplace.

347
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:54,270
As far as I know,

348
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,350
your landlord

349
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,750
asked for a high rent.

350
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,390
Really?

351
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:58,630
Why did he say

352
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,470
he gave me

353
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,470
a big discount?

354
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:01,870
Fine. You've said hello.

355
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:02,870
Can you leave now?

356
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:05,130
You want to come in?

357
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,470
No, no.

358
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:07,670
I just want to

359
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,200
borrow Lin Xi for a second.

360
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:09,869
No way.

361
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:13,829
Huasheng and Yuyi

362
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:15,430
are collaborating now.

363
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,930
You won't refuse me, will you?

364
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,630
Mr. Xiao, what's it?

365
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,630
I've just moved here

366
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:38,590
and need help with unpacking.

367
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,390
Help me.

368
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,910
Sorry, I'm busy.

369
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,270
There are files I need to translate.

370
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,670
I allow you to submit them a day later.

371
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:45,930
They're not from Yuyi.

372
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,350
Besides the work from Yuyi,

373
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,010
I have a lot of other work to do.

374
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,030
Okay.

375
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,870
Then I'll call Zhang Jiakang

376
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,270
and tell him I need Director Lin's help

377
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:57,200
with something really important.

378
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,630
Xiao Yicheng,

379
00:17:58,830 --> 00:17:59,390
can you

380
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:00,470
keep things professional?

381
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:01,790
If you help me get settled sooner,

382
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,350
I can better handle

383
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,350
our collaboration.

384
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,870
How is that unprofessional?

385
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,390
You hold a high-level position.

386
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:07,150
Can't you afford to pay someone

387
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:07,990
to do it?

388
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,320
No, I can't afford that.

389
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:11,720
Fine.

390
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,790
I need to tell you something anyway.

391
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:27,150
Look at you.

392
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,190
You're no match

393
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,550
for Xiao Yicheng.

394
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:31,630
Grandaunt.

395
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:34,030
How can you side with an outsider?

396
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:35,630
Tell me.

397
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,870
Are you angry because of Lin Xi

398
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:38,930
or something else?

399
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:41,030
Something else?

400
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,350
Boy,

401
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:46,070
love can appear to be many things,

402
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:48,350
but the core is always the same.

403
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:50,630
Wait, Grandma.

404
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,160
What are you talking about?

405
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,390
You'll understand.

406
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,770
Do you want some desserts?

407
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,710
No.

408
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:09,550
Let's start

409
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,710
with the sheet set.

410
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:11,510
Xiao Yicheng.

411
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:15,000
I'm not here to help you unpack.

412
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:18,240
I meant what I said to you

413
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,310
that day.

414
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,470
We should keep our distance.

415
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:23,750
I know.

416
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,030
I've moved here

417
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,710
because the environment is good

418
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,370
and it's close to the company.

419
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:30,670
The serviced apartment

420
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:31,870
was just a temporary solution.

421
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,600
I have to settle down in the end.

422
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,270
Do you believe

423
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,750
what you said?

424
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,790
You said you have no feelings for me.

425
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:42,920
Do you believe that?

426
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,250
If you have no feelings for me,

427
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:48,830
why can't you

428
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:49,990
help a normal friend

429
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:50,990
tidy up his house?

430
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:53,990
Lin Xi.

431
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:56,290
The harder you try to run away,

432
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:59,170
the more reason you give me to believe you're lying.

433
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,790
The sheet set, right?

434
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,280
The bedroom is here.

435
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:27,830
Are you done?

436
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,520
♫An orange breeze blows through the dawn♫

437
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,470

It's done.

460
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,240
I'm leaving.

461
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:52,000
♫If heart flutters are the only promise♫

462
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:55,910

Xi, I need your help.

487
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,310
I'm at your door.

488
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:54,190
♫My eyes will no longer dodge♫

489
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:53,550
Coming.

490
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:01,270
Xi.

491
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,510
Can you help me look after

492
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:04,170
Third Princess for a few days?

493
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,230
I thought you had a cat.

494
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,310
Where did you get this dog?

495
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:09,150
I just bought her.

496
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:10,010
Isn't she cute?

497
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:11,240
Third Princess.

498
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:12,800
Third Princess.

499
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:16,550
It's not that I don't want to help you.

500
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,150
I've never had a pet.

501
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:19,830
For her sake,

502
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:20,630
I suggest

503
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:22,150
you send her to a pet store.

504
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:22,910
Here's the thing.

505
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,710
Third Princess is only a month old.

506
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:25,990
She gets scared very easily.

507
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:26,750
In pet stores,

508
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:27,950
at the sight of other cats and dogs,

509
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,910
she'll freak out and bang on the cage.

510
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:30,710
Xi.

511
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:33,280
Please look after her for me for a few days.

512
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:35,190
But I have no experience.

513
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,190
It's simple.

514
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:37,750
I've prepared her food.

515
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,350
This is dog food.

516
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,310
This is goat milk powder.

517
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,150
Just feed her on time

518
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:40,870
every day.

519
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:42,330
You don't need to walk her.

520
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:48,190
Xi, I've visited

521
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:49,710
all the pet stores nearby.

522
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:50,200
Third Princess

523
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,800
wouldn't stay in any of them.

524
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:53,870
Please.

525
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,750
Why don't you ask other colleagues for help?

526
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:56,550
Ask Chen Wen.

527
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:57,830
I've sent both Dapi and Erka

528
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,110
to Chen Wen.

529
00:23:59,190 --> 00:23:59,830
The place she rented

530
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,030
is too small.

531
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:03,230
There's no more room for Third Princess.

532
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,670
As for other colleagues,

533
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,230
I've called all of them.

534
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,470
If I had other choices,

535
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:09,130
I wouldn't have turned to you.

536
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,710
Mr. Xiao?

537
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:17,070
You live here too?

538
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,430
We're neighbors.

539
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,110
Xi.

540
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,390
For the next few days,

541
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:23,310
please take good care of

542
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,570
Third Princess for me.

543
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,230
Grandma Li is home.

544
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,230
She's very old now.

545
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,230
It's unsafe

546
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:33,630
to have a pet in the house.

547
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:39,950
Hello?

548
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,230
Okay, okay.

549
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:42,270
Give me a minute.

550
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,330
I'll be right down.

551
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,150
Okay.

552
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,630
Xi, I have a plane to catch.

553
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:46,310
I really have to go now.

554
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,740
I'll leave the stuff here.

555
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:48,400
Please.

556
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,310
Ling Feng, wait.

557
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,110
Do you need help?

558
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:05,910
I don't think you can help.

559
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:08,120
It's okay. I'll figure something out.

560
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:09,670
If you don't mind,

561
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:11,000
she can stay at my place.

562
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:12,990
It's improper.

563
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,630
It's also improper

564
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,890
to have a pet around Grandma Li, isn't it?

565
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,390
It's okay. At worst,

566
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:21,990
I'll just lock her in my room.

567
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:23,990
You want to lock her up?

568
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,270
Has she agreed to that?

569
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:29,270
Doggie, do you agree?

570
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:31,750
Poor thing.

571
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:32,870
You surely disagree,

572
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:33,470
right?

573
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:35,830
If you don't mind,

574
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,190
thank you.

575
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:39,640
You're welcome.

576
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:40,920
Let's go home.

577
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,680
Third Princess, right?

578
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,380
You'll stay here tonight.

579
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,260
Good girl.

580
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:55,590
Do you have

581
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,590
any spare blankets?

582
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,870
She needs covers

583
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:59,150
and something to sleep on.

584
00:25:59,150 --> 00:25:59,670
Okay.

585
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:05,990
Good girl.

586
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,430
Here.

587
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:14,530
Okay. Give it to me.

588
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:20,590
Have you

589
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:24,200
become shorter?

590
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,030
Have I?

591
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,670
Make a bed for her.

592
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,710
I'm going back.

593
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:32,950
Wait.

594
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,950
Before eight in the morning

595
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:38,350
and after ten in the evening,

596
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,350
you can come over.

597
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,390
I just let her stay here.

598
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:45,590
You're the one who will take care of her.

599
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:48,590
Of course.

600
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:49,750
Okay.

601
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:50,870
Good night.

602
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,110
Do you want to go to work with me?

603
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,240
I can give you a ride.

604
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,320
No, thanks. I have a car.

605
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:06,230
Hi.

606
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:07,630
Hello, everyone.

607
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,710
Welcome to Yuyi Tianxia.

608
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:25,230
Here are Yuyi's products

609
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:27,950
from the past, the present, and for the future.

610
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,430
Feel free to take a look around.

611
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:34,030
I hope this tour

612
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:35,630
can assist your future work.

613
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,150
Back then,

614
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:07,110
I represented Kenpardy Technical University

615
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,830
in the American collegiate

616
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:10,090
programming contest.

617
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,230
That was the first time I'd made money.

618
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:15,160
Going abroad was the best decision you've ever made.

619
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:18,200
It was also the hardest one.

620
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:23,950
Guys.

621
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,580
Let me tell you a secret.

622
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:27,390
All Yuyi's products

623
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,910
have a secret code.

624
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:33,830
Look.

625
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:37,070
Hi, my name is Xiaoyi.

626
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:40,230
Welcome to Yuyi Tianxia.

627
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:43,790
Hi, my name is Xiaoyi.

628
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,830
Welcome to Yuyi.

629
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:47,620
Here.

630
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:50,870
Try saying "Yuyi" to it.

631
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:53,470
But the voice commands for this robot are all in English.

632
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,000
Can it understand Chinese?

633
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:55,950
Try it.

634
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,470
Yuyi.

635
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:02,070
Let the world hear the voice of China.

636
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:06,200
Yes, let the world hear the voice of China.

637
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,790
This is Yuyi's slogan

638
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,190
and also our goal.

639
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:21,140
[Concept Plan for the Website]

640
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,880
Like the English websites

641
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,310
of other listed companies,

642
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,670
Yuyi's English website

643
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:25,270
needs to include the company profile,

644
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:27,190
announcements, financial data,

645
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:29,350
stock price trends, and shareholder information.

646
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,910
These are the basic sections.

647
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:32,710
The materials have been sent to you.

648
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:34,510
You can skim through them first.

649
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:35,470
Thank you.

650
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,230
I thought the collaboration

651
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,070
was about their IPO.

652
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,070
Why are we helping them

653
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,550
build an English website?

654
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:02,710
This is part

655
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:03,990
of the cooperation.

656
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:04,790
An IPO

657
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,550
requires systematic work.

658
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:09,230
IPO,

659
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,230
Initial Public Offering.

660
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:12,630
In other words,

661
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,630
it means offering shares of a private corporation

662
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:15,830
to the public for the first time.

663
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:16,590
I know that.

664
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:17,510
Next,

665
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:18,910
based on the process of an IPO,

666
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:20,430
Yuyi needs to submit its prospectus

667
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:22,030
to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

668
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:23,190
Only after their prospectus

669
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,310
passes inspection

670
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,230
can Yuyi proceed

671
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,640
with the public offering of shares.

672
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,350
So our task

673
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,390
is to translate

674
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:30,150
the prospectus?

675
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:31,350
It's not that simple.

676
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,390
Next,

677
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:33,220
Yuyi needs to

678
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:35,190
continue promoting itself to the public

679
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:36,310
and determine pricing based on valuation models

680
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:38,350
and supply and demand analysis.

681
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,030
It's that complicated?

682
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:40,950
The whole process

683
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:42,550
involves a lot of documents,

684
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,390
including the company profile,

685
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:46,670
professional knowledge, patents,

686
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:48,350
financials, corporate bylaws,

687
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,910
and legal regulations.

688
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:52,430
So much professional stuff.

689
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,270
Our mission

690
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:56,110
is to sort out and translate

691
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:56,750
all the documents

692
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:57,500
that are generated

693
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,160
during the process of the IPO.

694
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:00,230
Got it.

695
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,550
So today's mission

696
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:03,840
is just a small case.

697
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:06,310
We're a small team.

698
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:08,050
Can we finish so much work?

699
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:09,310
Don't forget

700
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:11,510
that our priority client management department is the best.

701
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:12,870
In the past, under Lin Xi's leadership,

702
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:13,790
we've completed

703
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,250
more than one IPO project.

704
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:17,870
Alright, let's get to work.

705
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:26,110
Mr. Xiao. Mr. Xiao.

706
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:26,990
-Guys.
-Mr. Xiao.

707
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:28,750
As to the first stage

708
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:30,830
of the building of Yuyi's multi-language website,

709
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:32,670
do you have any questions?

710
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:33,910
No.

711
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:36,470
Then,

712
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,930
best wishes for our cooperation.

713
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,310
You'll be satisfied with our work.

714
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:43,640
I'm looking forward to reading your perfect translations.

715
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:59,570
[Start a joint-stock company]

716
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,350
Lin Xi.

717
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,389
Coming.

718
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:27,050
Do you want to take a break?

719
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:37,030
So none of the words

720
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:37,830
we came up with during the brainstorm

721
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:38,949
can be used?

722
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:42,389
Lin Xi.

723
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:43,710
Have you ever thought that

724
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:46,590
maybe Xiao Yicheng means to make things hard for you?

725
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:47,909
Why would he do that?

726
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:50,830
To make you give in

727
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:52,989
so that you can be together again.

728
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,230
If you were Xiao Yicheng,

729
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,230
would you do that?

730
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,070
Of course not.

731
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:00,240
He wouldn't do that either.

732
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:02,550
How about you?

733
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:05,230
Is it because you want

734
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,300
to rekindle a romance with him as well

735
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,900
that you're working so hard?

736
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:13,430
Use words.

737
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:14,830
That smile is so scary.

738
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,110
Translation

739
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:22,110
is destined to be an art of regret.

740
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:25,390
I hope that five, ten,

741
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:26,990
or even more years later,

742
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,830
when I think of this project again,

743
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:30,230
I'll have less to regret.

744
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:33,990
Fine.

745
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:35,670
Sorry. I should've

746
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:36,930
given you more credit.

747
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:38,550
But let me ask you.

748
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:40,430
The client is already satisfied with the result.

749
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,560
Why are you still trying to perfect it?

750
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:44,430
Because we're professionals.

751
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,300
Being a professional

752
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,880
means delivering outcomes

753
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,010
beyond what the clients already know.

754
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,260
What if you can't come up with a better translation?

755
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,200
I'll wait for inspiration.

756
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:01,350
Have you thought about

757
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,950
approaching it another way?

758
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:04,230
How?

759
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,010
Think about it.

760
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:07,430
There are no more borrowings

761
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:08,910
we can use.

762
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:10,190
Why don't we

763
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:12,190
create new words?

764
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,370
Take Icelandic as an example.

765
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:16,790
In modern times,

766
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:18,030
they had a nationalist movement

767
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,670
to purify their language.

768
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:20,920
They replaced some loanwords

769
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,230
with their native words.

770
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:22,990
But their native words

771
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:23,710
couldn't accurately

772
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:24,510
describe new things

773
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:25,630
from foreign countries.

774
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:26,310
So,

775
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:27,470
they started

776
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:28,660
to create new words.

777
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:29,670
For example,

778
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,590
in Icelandic, psychology

779
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:31,320
is sálfræði.

780
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:32,950
They combined "sál" and "fræði"

781
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:33,810
into a new word.

782
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:35,990
Yuyi wants to let the world

783
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:36,880
hear the voice of China, right?

784
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,940
Can we take words from both languages

785
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:40,240
to create a new word?

786
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:41,640
For example?

787
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:45,550
For example… Yuyi…

788
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:47,910
Yibility.

789
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:53,030
Yibility?

790
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:53,710
Yeah.

791
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:55,310
Here is what I think.

792
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:55,830
It…

793
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:57,790
You want to use Yuyi's slogan itself

794
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:59,310
as its logo,

795
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,310
to establish a symbolic representation

796
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:02,710
for the company's image.

797
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:04,550
Hold on.

798
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:06,150
How could you eavesdrop?

799
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:08,580
First,

800
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:11,310
I'm on my own balcony.

801
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:12,190
Second,

802
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,390
you were talking about work.

803
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:15,030
As your client,

804
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:16,360
couldn't I listen to it?

805
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,320
Or were you talking about something

806
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,830
you didn't want me to know?

807
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:24,590
Then tell me

808
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:25,390
what you think of

809
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,850
the translation Yibiliy.

810
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:31,110
Not bad.

811
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:33,710
It's a very creative approach.

812
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:35,190
It's worth considering.

813
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,830
You do know something about translation.

814
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:37,550
But

815
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:40,730
it's still not the perfect translation.

816
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:42,440
Lin Xi.

817
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,070
What do you think?

818
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:49,550
I agree.

819
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:53,840
This translation has a symbolic meaning,

820
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:56,030
but it's not catchy

821
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:58,190
and easy to understand

822
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:00,610
for English speakers.

823
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:03,950
It's fine.

824
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:05,880
We'll think about it again.

825
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:07,230
Okay.

826
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:13,790
Keeping things professional

827
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:15,110
is the basic quality

828
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:16,110
of a mature man.

829
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:18,360
It's childish to talk about others

830
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,490
behind their backs.

831
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:21,270
By the way, Lin Xi,

832
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:22,590
it's almost ten o'clock.

833
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:23,630
You can come over to deal with

834
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,160
your personal matters now.

835
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:28,950
Wait.

836
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:31,070
What personal matters do you have in his house?

837
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:32,070
I'll be back soon.

838
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:34,990
Wait, Lin Xi.

839
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:35,830
It's already past 9:30.

840
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:36,750
It's very late.

841
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:40,720
Where are you going?

842
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:41,790
Come here.

843
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:49,220
Okay.

844
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:53,030
Come. Let me pick you up.

845
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,950
I'll send a message to your dad.

846
00:38:58,390 --> 00:38:59,230
Ling Feng.

847
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:00,350
I've sent you photos

848
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:00,910
of Third Princess.

849
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:01,770
Check them out.

850
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,590
Dear Xi.

851
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,110
I was in a hurry when I sent her to you

852
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:09,750
and didn't have time to bathe Third Princess.

853
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:10,550
Can you

854
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,870
bathe her for me?

855
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,080
Thank you very much.

856
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:14,190
I can bathe her.

857
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,030
But it's late tonight.

858
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:16,290
I'll do that tomorrow.

859
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:21,400
I'm just worried that your house may have a dog smell.

860
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:25,230
Xiao Yicheng.

861
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,670
Can I bathe at your place?

862
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,200
I mean, bathe the dog.

863
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:35,220
Over there.

864
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:36,790
Thank you.

865
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:41,270
Let's go have a bath.

866
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:44,120
You're going to smell nice.

867
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:48,510
Good girl.

868
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:49,550
Stay here.

869
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:51,250
You're gonna smell great.

870
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,070
You

871
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:03,550
forgot these.

872
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:06,360
Thank you.

873
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:08,710
Close the door for me.

874
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:13,060
Third Princess, time for your bath.

875
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:14,470
Come.

876
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:16,350
This is dry shampoo.

877
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:18,350
Enjoy the spa.

878
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:20,750
It smells good.

879
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:26,970
Faithfulness, expressiveness, and elegance.

Your client doesn't like any of your translations?

883

He's not satisfied.

884
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:39,270
By the way,

885
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,030
have you heard about

886
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:41,960
Simmons' story?

887
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:44,310
No.

888
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:46,590
Over a hundred years ago,

889
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:48,630
an American company came to Shanghai.

890
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:49,790
Simmons Company.

891
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:52,640
It's a company that makes spring mattresses.

892
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:53,990
Do you know

893
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:55,460
what the Chinese beds

894
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,590
were like back then?

895
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:59,070
They were made of palm fibers or vines.

896
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:00,190
There were worse ones.

897
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:00,990
Some were made

898
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,470
of wooden planks.

899
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:04,470
So,

900
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:07,070
spring mattresses

901
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:08,100
were new to the Chinese.

902
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,710
Many people had never used one before

903
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:12,070
or even heard about them.

904
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,230
To break into the Chinese market,

905
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,990
that company

906
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,660
initiated a campaign

907
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:18,430
to solicit advice on its Chinese name.

908
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:19,430
A campaign?

909
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:21,550
At that time,

910
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:23,310
it was

911
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:25,830
a big marketing campaign.

912
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:27,630
Do you know

913
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:29,270
which company won in the end?

914
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:32,230
Just tell me the answer.

915
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:36,000
The one who came up with its current Chinese name.

916
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,940
It's a great translation.

917
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:41,960
It has a similar pronunciation…

918
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:45,110
And also has a great meaning in Chinese.

919
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:46,670
Anyone who hears this name

920
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:47,750
will think those mattresses

921
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:49,150
can make them sleep well.

922
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:49,990
Yes.

923
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:50,790
This translation

924
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:52,790
is the word for spring mattresses now.

925
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:53,790
It's

926
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:55,710
a very successful Chinese translation.

927
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:57,670
It has stood the test of time.

928
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:00,350
So you mean

929
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:02,190
Yuyi's slogan

930
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:04,310
may have a deeper meaning?

931
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,990
There may be

932
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:11,350
other stories behind it.
