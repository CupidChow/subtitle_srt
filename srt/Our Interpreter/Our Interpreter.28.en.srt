Check them again, okay?

11
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,850
By the way, one more thing.

into the computer.

15
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,450
Have you heard?

16
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,550
Xi is returning to the priority client management department.

17
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,310
Really?

18
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,670
Where did you get the news?

19
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,990
I got it from a buddy in the translation department.

20
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:27,250
It's definitely true.

21
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,260
Ask Tian if you don't believe me.

22
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,070
Tian.

23
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,470
Is Xi coming back?

00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,390
Stop gossiping and get to work.

00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:36,829
Her position and conditions

26
00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:37,590
won't change.

27
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,910
Lin Xi is just cooperating with Director Lu.

28
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,310
Later, we'll also cooperate with

29
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,970
the translation department.

30
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,970
Why is your face so red?

31
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,829
Are you not feeling well?

32
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,550
I'm fine.

33
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,770
Isn't this allergy medicine?

34
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,590
Shasha, do you have an allergy?

35
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,390
No.

36
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,030
I just left it here before.

37
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,190
You need more rest.

38
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:13,910
If you don't rest well,

39
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:14,960
your immune system will be weakened,

40
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,360
which renders you more prone to allergies.

41
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,670
Give me the rest of your work.

42
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,020
You can rest today.

43
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,710
Really?

44
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,030
Amazing.

45
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,510
Lin Xi is really something.

46
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,110
Yes.

47
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,710
Xi is here. Xi is here.

48
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,400
She's here.

49
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:42,030
Xi.

50
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,350
What's wrong?

51
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,400
I'll go first.

52
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,900
The administrative manager

53
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,300
sent me a message just now

54
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:58,390
to say that Meeting Room No. 9 will be

55
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,990
turned into a mother's room.

56
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,440
You made that happen for me, right?

57
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,230
The HR manager

58
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,510
also called me to say

59
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,640
that he would hire an assistant for me.

60
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:09,830
As for me,

61
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,680
although I wasn't allowed to buy a cat climbing frame,

62
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,360
it has been announced in the company's group chat

63
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,310
that we can apply for

64
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,230
five days of leave per month

65
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,390
to accompany our pets.

66
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,190
I must have saved the galaxy in my past life

67
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,519
to be able to meet such a good boss like you.

68
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,670
Then, today's lunch will be on me.

69
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,670
You can discuss what you want to eat.

70
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,800
What do you want to eat?

71
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,190
Xi.

72
00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:35,350
I'll make a toast to you with water instead of alcohol.

73
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,230
Thanks to our department's achievement today,

74
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,090
we can really hold our heads high.

75
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,230
I'll make a toast to you with juice instead of alcohol.

76
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,310
Lin Xi.

77
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,680
Now that you're in our department,

78
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,110
our department has been

79
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:46,909
revitalized.

80
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:49,230
Here's to Lin Xi.

81
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,790
Don't stand on ceremony.

82
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:51,710
As long as

83
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,190
you work as you did before,

84
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,830
leave the rest

85
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,550
to me.

86
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,710
As for the benefits other departments enjoy,

87
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,390
I'll make sure we have them too.

88
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,110
Great.

89
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,630
Waiter.

90
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,670
May I have the bill?

91
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,430
For your table,

92
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,230
a lady has already paid the bill.

93
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,390
Where is she?

94
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,310
She just left.

95
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,550
Excuse me for a while.

96
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,160
Okay.

97
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,520
Doing good deeds anonymously?

98
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,270
Come and eat with us.

99
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:01,710
No need.

100
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,510
You're still the same.

101
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:07,310
You keep your head down whenever you're troubled.

102
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,030
Xi.

103
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,070
I know

104
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,730
it was you who wrote me a recommendation letter.

105
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,110
Why?

106
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,190
Don't tell me you refused to be a regular employee

107
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,990
because you found out I wrote it?

108
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,390
N-No.

109
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,390
Ling Feng told me

110
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,430
you're having a meal with your employees here.

111
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,790
I wanted to thank you.

112
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,150
Actually, I'm the one who should be

113
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,030
thanking you.

114
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,710
Maybe this makes me

115
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,230
sound a little sanctimonious,

116
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,159
but

117
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,510
it was indeed you

118
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,390
who made me realize

119
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,510
that I should respect

120
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,909
everyone's lifestyle

121
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:50,720
and values.

122
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,070
I've learned that from you.

123
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,070
Xi.

124
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:01,990
If you need me for anything

125
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,910
in the future,

126
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,160
remember to look for me.

127
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:09,990
Good luck.

128
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,990
Xi!

129
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,870
I'm sorry

130
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,630
for what happened before.

131
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:05,670
Mom.

132
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,830
Why is the soup so salty?

133
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,720
Didn't I tell you about it last time?

134
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,110
Your dad made it today.

135
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,510
Yicheng.

136
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,850
About what happened that day,

137
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,030
don't you think

138
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,960
you should give us an explanation?

139
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,669
What's there to explain?

140
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,990
Are you sure that lady is the one?

141
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,350
You should have control over

142
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,150
your emotional relationships.

143
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,580
But there's one thing.

144
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:51,230
You must be responsible for everything you do.

145
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,070
Got it, Dad.

146
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,270
You two father and son

147
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,670
sure have a good rapport.

148
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,990
Let me be the bad guy then.

149
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,310
Yicheng.

150
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,870
I've seen countless people.

151
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,270
Do you think Lin Xi's family and our family

152
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,440
are compatible?

153
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,270
Why not?

154
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,360
What's incompatible, Mom?

155
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,120
Marriage is a matter that involves two families.

156
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,750
When you become in-laws,

157
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:24,040
you should see each other frequently.

158
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,030
Lin Xi's father is a businessman.

159
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,030
Is he able to

160
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,750
get along with our family?

161
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,080
Mom.

162
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,590
What era is it now?

163
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:34,390
Why are you still talking about this?

164
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:34,990
Besides, it has nothing to do with the two of...

165
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:35,620
Fine.

166
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,220
Let's talk about Lin Xi then.

167
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:40,430
I have some friends in the translation industry.

168
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:42,430
They seem to have some reservations

169
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,470
about Lin Xi.

170
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:49,830
Dad, Mom,

171
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:50,830
I don't want to talk about this with you anymore.

172
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:51,510
Let's eat.

173
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:55,390
Yicheng.

174
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,590
Your mom is doing this for your own good.

175
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,670
Back then, Grandma also asked you to take the civil service exam

176
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,750
for your own good.

177
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,750
Why didn't you go?

178
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,000
We're talking about you today.

179
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,930
Why are you talking about your dad?

180
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,900
Yicheng.

181
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,790
You're making things difficult for us.

182
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,430
The relationship between the Lin family and Professor Gao

183
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:17,310
seems to be estranged.

184
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,590
If you're with her,

185
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:22,190
our relationship with Professor Gao

186
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,590
will become tricky.

187
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:24,310
Dad.

188
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,320
I want to marry Lin Xi,

189
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,030
not Professor Gao's family.

190
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,590
If you can get along, that's great.

191
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,110
If you can't get along, then you don't have to hang out all the time.

192
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:33,870
Anyway,

193
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:34,710
Dad, Mom,

194
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,710
I'm sure about Lin Xi.

195
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,750
If you accept her,

196
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,900
I'll be happy, of course.

197
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,910
If you don't accept her...

198
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,550
Why?

199
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,310
Are you going to

200
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,550
cut ties with us?

201
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,550
What are you talking about?

202
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,870
What I mean is

203
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,230
if you don't accept her,

204
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,950
you don't have to associate with her

205
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:50,870
and see her.

206
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:52,960
I have work to do in the company.

207
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,830
I have to go.

208
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,590
So,

209
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,760
no matter how much we oppose it,

210
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,550
you still have to marry her?

211
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,360
Yes.

212
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,030
See?

213
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,600
I told you so.

214
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,550
What do you mean?

215
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,110
I've never seen him

216
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,170
so serious before.

217
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:16,670
What do you mean?

218
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,390
We were just

219
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,910
trying to see if you're sincere or not.

220
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,270
After all, Lin Xi

221
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:25,230
is Professor Gao's granddaughter.

222
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:25,870
If

223
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,510
you treat her badly,

224
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,830
how could we be accountable to

225
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:29,790
Professor Gao?

226
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,110
Yeah.

227
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:33,350
We just wanted to test you.

228
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,030
Dad, Mom.

229
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,030
How old

230
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,150
are you two?

231
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,950
How could you put on a show for me?

232
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,310
All right.

233
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,590
Go back first.

234
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:44,030
We'll go to the hospital

235
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:44,910
to see Professor Gao tomorrow.

236
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:45,790
By then,

237
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:46,830
introduce Lin Xi

238
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,550
to us properly.

239
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,170
You are not young anymore.

240
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,060
You should settle down soon.

241
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:54,990
Bye.

242
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,150
Dad, have some water.

243
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,230
Wenli was going to come.

244
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,310
But the school

245
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,230
suddenly scheduled

246
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:25,950
an online class for her.

247
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:26,750
She had to stay

248
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,830
to teach the kids.

249
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,270
But she told me

250
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,110
that I must send you

251
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,230
home safely.

252
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,650
Yes, classes are more important.

253
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:35,910
Is Wenli

254
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,910
still teaching English in an elementary school?

255
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:38,630
Yes.

256
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:39,590
The Ministry of Education

257
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:40,270
wanted to transfer her

258
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,710
to teach English in a high school.

259
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:42,750
But Wenli said

260
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,430
that English should start with little kids.

261
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,070
It's very important to lay the proper foundation for little kids.

262
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:46,590
So,

263
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:47,630
over the past 20 years,

264
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,630
she has been teaching English in elementary schools.

265
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,240
Good. Very good.

266
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,710
Wenli

267
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:55,150
has always been outstanding since she was little.

268
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,070
If Wenli knows of

269
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:56,950
your recognition of her,

270
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,270
she will be very happy.

271
00:12:59,150 --> 00:12:59,840
Dad.

272
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,630
The discharge procedures are done.

273
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,030
The taxi I called has also arrived.

274
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,390
It's hard for them to park in front of the hospital.

275
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,870
Let's hurry up and go.

276
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,310
Gao Ling.

277
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,270
Let me drive Dad home.

278
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,550
Cancel the taxi.

279
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,070
Well...

280
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:13,550
Let Dayong give me a ride.

281
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:15,990
Okay.

282
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,750
I'll let the driver know.

283
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:23,910
Dad, have some water.

284
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:28,840
Professor Gao.

285
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,390
Professor Gao.

286
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:29,830
Hello.

287
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:30,470
Xixi.

288
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:31,590
You are all here.

289
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,990
Professor Gao.

290
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,270
Are you discharged from the hospital?

291
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,190
The doctor has given me a thorough examination.

292
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,350
I'm fine now.

293
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,600
I just have to go back and rest.

294
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,430
Mr. Lin.

295
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,960
At the dinner that day,

296
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,710
I didn't have the chance

297
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:46,110
to say hello to you properly.

298
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:46,950
Same here.

299
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,030
Sorry about that.

300
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,350
I didn't expect

301
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,790
us to be so fated

302
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,450
with Professor Gao's family.

303
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,390
We're even

304
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,750
becoming one family.

305
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,390
Great!

306
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,430
These two young people

307
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,270
are fated.

308
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,310
Xixi.

309
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,970
Let’s send your grandpa back.

310
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:04,350
How about

311
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,110
Xiao Yicheng and I send Grandpa home?

312
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:06,710
Yes.

313
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,030
Let us send him home instead.

314
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:09,990
No.

315
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,110
I must have Xi

316
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,840
and her boyfriend send me home.

317
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,430
Okay.

318
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,300
Let's go.

319
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,080
You're in a good mood.

320
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,150
Mr. Lin.

321
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,070
I wonder if you are free today.

322
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,990
Let's have dinner together.

323
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,780
I booked a vegetarian restaurant.

324
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,150
Yicheng told me

325
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,750
that your wife has vegetarian food every 1st and 15th

326
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,670
of the month.

327
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,990
Today happens to be the 15th.

328
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,790
Ask your wife to join us.

329
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,350
Thank you,

330
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,270
but I don't think it's necessary.

331
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,750
It so happens that Yicheng and Xixi

332
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,670
will join us after

333
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:48,350
sending Professor Gao home.

334
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:48,950
Yes.

335
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,610
All right then.

336
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,870
I'll call her and ask her

337
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,070
to go there directly.

338
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:54,950
Let's go.

339
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:56,670
What's up?

340
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:58,960
Lin.

341
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,440
Previously,

342
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,190
we were both abroad.

343
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:04,750
We didn't know much about

344
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,150
Yicheng's life in China.

345
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,870
I didn't know they were already

346
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,150
acquainted.

347
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,630
I'm really sorry.

348
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,870
Me too.

349
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:16,510
At Professor Gao's birthday party,

350
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,590
my attitude was

351
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,720
a little too aggressive.

352
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,790
Please don't

353
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,860
take it to heart.

354
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,430
-It's fine.
-It's fine.

355
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:23,760
Let me apologize to you.

356
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,350
I'll drink it up.

357
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,030
Xiao.

358
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:27,990
Now that you're doing this,

359
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,110
I feel embarrassed.

360
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,230
I have to do it too then.

361
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,150
Come on, let's drink together.

362
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:31,710
Come on.

363
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:32,310
Come on.

364
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:32,910
Let's drink.

365
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:33,870
Okay. Leave everything in the wine.

366
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,320
Xixi's mom, let’s eat.

367
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,390
-Okay.
-Let them drink.

368
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,200
Let's eat.

369
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:39,470
Mom.

370
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:41,990
Here's some orange juice.

371
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:43,550
Let's get down to business.

372
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:46,910
Auntie.

373
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:47,750
Here's some orange juice.

374
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,720
Thank you.

375
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,110
Xixi's mom.

376
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,030
Xixi's dad.

377
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,030
I wonder if

378
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,230
you have any considerations

379
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,630
about the kids' wedding?

380
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:01,360
Wedding?

381
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,390
Yes.

382
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,340
Look at how in love

383
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,390
they are.

384
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,070
It's time

385
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:06,550
to talk about marriage.

386
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,430
For these things,

387
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:08,430
the groom's side

388
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:10,030
have to be prepared in advance.

389
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:10,420
Yes.

390
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,870
I wonder if you have any requests

391
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:12,830
and rules.

392
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,030
If you don't have any,

393
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,910
we have a few plans.

394
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:18,670
Right, Xiao?

395
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:21,430
Last year, when we were in France,

396
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,390
we saw many young couples

397
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,870
taking wedding photos there.

398
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,110
It was quite interesting.

399
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:26,660
Yes.

400
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,430
They took wedding photos

401
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:29,070
while traveling.

402
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:29,580
Yes.

403
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,230
It so happens that Xixi knows French too.

404
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,310
Really?

405
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:33,350
Wait, wait.

406
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,210
It's not that we don't have rules.

407
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:35,750
Well...

408
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,430
Here's the thing.

409
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,230
Why are we already

410
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:41,080
discussing the wedding

411
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,790
and wedding photoshoot?

412
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,030
Isn't it too early?

413
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,630
Lin.

414
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,110
What do you think?

415
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,440
Just share them with us.

416
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:53,020
Here's what I think.

417
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,030
Well,

418
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,310
Yicheng and Xixi

419
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:57,070
are in love indeed.

420
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:58,230
But

421
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:58,990
they just got together

422
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,110
after all.

423
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,390
I think

424
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:02,590
we should let them

425
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:03,430
take some time

426
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,310
to get to know each other.

427
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:05,990
Wait.

428
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,630
Haven't Yicheng and Xixi

429
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,950
been dating since they were in college?

430
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,030
Yes, Uncle.

431
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,710
Xixi and I

432
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,030
were together when we were in college.

433
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,349
We've known each other for more than ten years.

434
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:18,310
So, in her college years,

435
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,630
you were the one

436
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,220
who made our Xixi cry?

437
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:26,990
That even happened?

438
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:27,750
I don't know.

439
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,590
All right.

440
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,780
Let bygones be bygones.

441
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,710
It's fate that the two kids are together

442
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,300
now.

443
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,790
Uncle.

444
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,390
No matter what,

445
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,830
I will prove my sincerity to her

446
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:46,950
with my actions.

447
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,190
Lin.

448
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,590
I actually really want to go to France.

449
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:54,270
Mom, let's find a chance to travel and have fun there.

450
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,350
That's right.

451
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,920
I really want to

452
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,830
go to the museums in France.

453
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,270
They're really great.

454
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,670
I really want to go there.

455
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:05,750
Fine, fine, fine.

456
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,750
You two

457
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,630
can make the decision for this.

458
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,630
I'll just go along with everything.

459
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,310
That's great.

460
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:12,880
By then,

461
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,590
I'll be the tour guide for Xixi's Mom.

462
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,630
Thank you so much.

463
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,830
I'll be the photographer of the ladies.

464
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:19,270
I will

465
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,260
be your assistant then.

466
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:21,990
Screw you!

467
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:24,950
Dad.

468
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:27,270
Stop reading the newspaper. You just got discharged.

469
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,590
Have more of this nutritious soup.

470
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,110
Here.

471
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,030
Shasha.

472
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,150
Why have you lost weight

473
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:48,280
in just a few days that I didn't see you?

474
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:51,710
I didn't, Grandpa.

475
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,070
Gao Ling.

476
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,030
Get some more shrimp

477
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,390
for her to eat more.

478
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:01,510
Grandpa.

479
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,070
I’m full.

480
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,430
You guys continue.

481
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,710
I'm leaving.

482
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,960
What's wrong with Shasha?

483
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,990
What's wrong with you guys?

484
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:26,710
Dad.

485
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,230
Shasha has a boyfriend.

486
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,990
I don't think they're compatible.

487
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:33,030
They are completely

488
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,990
on different wavelengths.

489
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:35,990
A few days ago,

490
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,960
Shasha went to find this guy.

491
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,870
In the end,

492
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,950
her photodermatitis flared up.

493
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:43,430
She has allergic rashes all over her body.

494
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,390
She's been taking

495
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:46,320
allergy medicine this whole time.

496
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,150
You know she has a weak physique.

497
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,350
We've been very careful since she was little.

498
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,680
How many years has it been?

499
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,710
How could she have such a severe allergic reaction?

500
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:56,240
Shasha has grown up.

501
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,550
She should be able to

502
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:00,680
have the final say in her own business.

503
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:02,960
Dad, you're right.

504
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,110
But...

505
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,870
I feel sorry for my child.

506
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:08,390
Well,

507
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,590
she's been defending that boy

508
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,550
and has always been stubborn with me.

509
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,630
Has he ever cared about her?

510
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,670
She's this sunburnt,

511
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:17,820
yet I haven't seen this boy

512
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,670
come visit her

513
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:19,730
and care about her.

514
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:29,510
Let me know if there's any problem.

515
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,510
Okay, Tian.

516
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,060
Tian.

517
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,830
I feel a little unwell.

518
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:38,430
Maybe I’m really having an allergic reaction.

519
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:39,390
Wang Qiang.

520
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,510
I need to head out for something urgent.

521
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,390
Text me or send me a WeChat message

522
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:42,510
if you have any questions, okay?

523
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,190
Okay, Tian.

524
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:43,720
Wei Tian.

525
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:45,030
I was just looking for you.

526
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:45,760
Director Lu.

527
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:46,550
Yuyi

528
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,110
suddenly added a roadshow document.

529
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,030
It has to be translated by tonight.

530
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,150
We need it tomorrow.

531
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:52,100
It's urgent and there are few people who can deal with it.

532
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,150
To avoid mistakes,

533
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,950
you'll have to do it personally.

534
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:56,830
By tonight?

535
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,150
It's a difficult time.

536
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,160
I'm sorry you have to make sacrifices.

537
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,710
Auntie Wang!

538
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,270
Who is it?

539
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,510
The person who delivers the medicine.

540
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,510
Where is he?

541
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:21,630
He left.

542
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:23,270
He left?

543
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:23,870
Yes.

544
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:24,710
He sent it here.

545
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,350
And he's now making a delivery to his next customer.

546
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,390
The courier

547
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,710
needs to work.

548
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:29,790
Courier?

549
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:30,830
Urgent delivery.

550
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,390
Hello, Tian.

551
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,110
Shasha.

552
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:45,490
Have you received the medicine I bought?

553
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:47,950
Sorry.

554
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:50,270
A last-minute work thing came up today.

555
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,200
I can't go there.

556
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,990
It's okay. I'll let you get back to work.

557
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,470
I understand.

558
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,590
Bye.

559
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,150
You eat it too.

560
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,070
The Xiao family has a rule.

561
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,730
Women eat a strawberry's tip.

562
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,760
Men eat a strawberry's bottom.

563
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,160
I've eaten the bottoms.

564
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,910
What other rules do you have?

565
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,510
The Xiao family has another rule.

566
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,230
That is,

567
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,390
when women feel uncomfortable,

568
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:51,200
men should give them a massage.

569
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:56,260
Comfortable.

570
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,070
Harder.

571
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,150
Okay.

572
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:00,870
Wait.

573
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:01,870
Wait.

574
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:16,750
Massage gun.

575
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:21,650
How do you feel?

576
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,030
Are you taking revenge?

577
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,230
It's just the 2nd lowest speed.

578
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,270
It doesn't hurt.

579
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:28,950
It doesn't hurt?

580
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:29,590
No.

581
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,510
Give it to me. You try it.

582
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,000
Here.

583
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:35,010
How could you say it doesn't hurt?

584
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,000
Does it hurt?

585
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:42,470
Comfortable.

586
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:43,950
Comfortable?

587
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,470
Comfortable. It doesn't hurt.

588
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:52,670
Tell me if it hurts.

589
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,770
Don't keep it to yourself.

590
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,920
It really doesn't hurt.

591
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:58,550
Really?

592
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,290
The highest speed.

593
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:06,430
Does it hurt?

594
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,590
No.

595
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,270
No.

596
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:12,150
No?

597
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:14,630
It hurts.

598
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:21,110
You want to find another boyfriend?

599
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:24,270
No. Of course not.

600
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,000
No.

601
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:43,440
What's wrong?

602
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:43,990
Well.

603
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,230
I can't move.

604
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,910
I feel numb there.

605
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:49,500
Here?

606
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:49,910
Yes.

607
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:51,990
It's where I pointed the massage gun at.

608
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,310
Did I hurt you?

609
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,310
I don't know.

610
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,630
Try lifting your head up.

611
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:57,230
No.

612
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,190
I dare not.

613
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,950
I can't move now.

614
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,150
Let's go to the hospital.

615
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:02,630
Come on.

616
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:03,350
No, well...

617
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,440
Three, two, one. Get up.

618
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,390
It hurts.

619
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,910
Why did you use so much strength?

620
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,750
He said he didn't feel anything.

621
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,390
So I went harder.

622
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,070
Young lady,

623
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,470
what you did

624
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,790
created negative pressure

625
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:26,720
and caused his blood vessels to burst under his skin,

626
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,990
which left a bruise on his skin.

627
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:31,150
It's very dangerous.

628
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,940
It's irresponsible to do so.

629
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:36,230
Especially

630
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:38,070
on both sides of the carotid arteries.

631
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,830
There are the carotid sinuses.

632
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,910
If you create negative pressure

633
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,950
on this area,

634
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,590
it will cause a lack of blood,

635
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:48,990
a lack of oxygen,

636
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:51,990
and even cardiac arrest.

637
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:53,470
Doctor, here's the thing.

638
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:55,590
This was caused by a massage gun.

639
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:56,630
Stop talking.

640
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:57,710
I know.

641
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:01,470
Doctor, he's hurting.

642
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:02,850
What's the treatment?

643
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,710
I'll prescribe some patches

644
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:05,830
for you.

645
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:08,270
Use them for a few days, and they'll work.

646
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:09,470
Wait here.

647
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:11,310
I'll get the patches for you.

648
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,550
Thank you.

649
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:16,390
Come on. Seriously?

650
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:18,690
Does it still hurt?

651
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:19,590
Yes.

652
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:20,870
What should I do?

653
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,990
How about I ask the doctor

654
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:24,070
to prescribe some painkillers for you?

655
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,790
No need for painkillers.

656
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,790
But I have a way

657
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:28,790
to stop the pain.

658
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,230
It really hurts.

659
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:44,510
Why didn't you listen to me?

660
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,470
Don't blame me for nagging.

661
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:50,670
Impulse is like a devil.

662
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:53,550
You must be careful.

663
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,310
Yes, doctor.

664
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,310
How many patches

665
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:57,030
should he use every day?

666
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,310
How long should he wear it each time?

667
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,790
One in the morning and one at night.

668
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,710
Wear it for 6 hours each time.

669
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,070
Okay.

670
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:03,790
Don't shower

671
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,150
after you go home today.

672
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:05,910
Thank you.

673
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:06,430
Okay.

674
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:08,400
Thank you.

675
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,060
Remember to come back for a recheck 3 days later.

676
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:26,850
Let's go together.

677
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,540
My destination is not on your way.

678
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,110
You're not going to the company?

679
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:31,350
I have an appointment with the legal team

680
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,350
to talk about our listing contract.

681
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:34,270
Bye.

682
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,590
Maomao, is Mr. Xiao

683
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:51,020
going on a business trip next week?

684
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,070
No.

685
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,510
He has several meetings next week.

686
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:54,110
Okay.

687
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,080
What a coincidence!

688
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:59,830
Let's have dinner together.

689
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:00,550
Sure.

690
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:01,870
I still have a meeting

691
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:02,710
with Maomao.

692
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:03,510
Next time.

693
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:16,310
[Chief Operating Officer]

694
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,150
Where's Ms. Tong?

695
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:26,790
She left after the meeting.

696
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:28,350
Thank you.

697
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,150
How is the English website project

698
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,270
going?

699
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:06,390
I archived

700
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:07,350
all the rarely-used characters.

701
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,910
I promise nothing will go wrong.

702
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:09,550
Okay.

703
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:10,690
What about you?

704
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,590
I copied the content

705
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,790
on other listed companies' websites.

706
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,870
It can be used for reference

707
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:16,390
and help us avoid some mistakes.

708
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:17,350
Good job.

709
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,470
Mr. Xu,

710
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:20,670
what about you?

711
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:21,750
Lin Xi.

712
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:22,990
Come and take a look.

713
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:27,270
Look.

714
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:29,270
What do you think of this paragraph?

715
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:32,790
Mr. Xu,

716
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:34,750
you are our rock.

717
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:35,630
Your translation

718
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:39,230
achieves faithfulness, expressiveness, and elegance indeed.

719
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:39,990
Alright.

720
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:41,390
Take a rest.

721
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,150
I want to buy a drink.

722
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:44,950
Do you want?

723
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:45,990
No, thanks.

724
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:47,550
Ling Feng, go with Meihua.

725
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:48,110
It's not convenient for her.

726
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:48,550
Okay.

727
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,870
I'll take a walk too.

728
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:51,390
Okay.

729
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:55,310
I feel uncomfortable after sitting for too long.

730
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,030
Lin Xi,

731
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,710
you should be careful too.

732
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:00,590
Don't worry.

733
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,510
Hello, Mr. Xiao.

734
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,030
Why are you here?

735
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:22,870
You must be hungry.

736
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:24,070
I bought you some food.

737
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,270
Eat it while it's hot.

738
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,910
Here, try it.

739
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:34,190
Is it tasty?

740
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:38,480
Not bad.

741
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:40,630
Try it.

742
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:50,150
You're so cunning.

743
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:02,700
Mr. Xiao from Yuyi.

744
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:03,910
Hello, Mr. Xu.

745
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:08,350
Mr. Xiao is here to check on our progress.

746
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,310
Yes.

747
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,230
I told him

748
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:13,070
we will finish it on time.

749
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:16,390
Wait.

750
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:21,360
[Pantry]

751
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:18,950
Mr. Xiao,

752
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:20,060
are you here to visit us

753
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:20,750
and bring us some midnight snacks

754
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:21,710
as our client?

755
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:24,230
Yes.

756
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,710
I bought you some food.

757
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:26,750
Come.

758
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,350
Thank you, then.

759
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,270
I've worked for so many years.

760
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:31,740
I've never met

761
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,750
such a considerate client before.

762
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:35,230
Mr. Xiao, please come often.

763
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:35,990
As long as

764
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:37,450
I don't disturb your work.

765
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:39,480
By the way, Mr. Xiao,

766
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:41,200
you are young, successful,

767
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:42,430
and handsome.

768
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:44,190
Do you have a girlfriend?

769
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,760
Meihua.

770
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,100
You shouldn't be a translator.

771
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,640
You should be a neighborhood committee worker.

772
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,350
Mr. Xiao,

773
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:55,070
please don't mind.

774
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,670
Meihua meant no offence.

775
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,110
It's okay.

776
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:00,070
Actually,

777
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,350
I already have a girlfriend.

778
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:04,130
You have a girlfriend?

779
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:06,230
Let me tell you.

780
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:07,430
Since Huasheng

781
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:08,830
started cooperating with Yuyi,

782
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,060
my female colleagues

783
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,350
have kept telling me

784
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:13,210
that you're a single and rich man.

785
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:16,270
I didn't expect you to have a girlfriend.

786
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,070
Well,

787
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,390
on behalf of

788
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:19,590
the female staff of Huasheng,

789
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:20,310
may I ask

790
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:22,230
what she looks like?

791
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:23,910
She

792
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:25,950
is pretty.

793
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:27,350
She's independent

794
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:28,270
and capable,

795
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,790
but a little violent.

796
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,610
But most importantly, she's pretty.

797
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:34,950
How pretty?

798
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:36,150
Do you have a photo?

799
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:38,550
Meihua,

800
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:39,390
try this.

801
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:41,110
This is their specialty.

802
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:46,870
These snacks

803
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:48,670
are Lin Xi's favorites.

804
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:50,070
Mr. Xiao, good choice.

805
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:57,280
Mr. Xiao.

806
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:58,710
Show us the photo.

807
00:32:58,710 --> 00:32:59,470
What photo?

808
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:02,190
The photo of his girlfriend.

809
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,390
Mr. Xiao said his girlfriend

810
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:04,260
is pretty.

811
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,110
By the way, Mr. Xiao,

812
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,950
Lin Xi is still single.

813
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:11,640
Is there

814
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,950
any good man around you?

815
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,070
Introduce one to her.

816
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,000
Sure.

817
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:17,550
I wonder what Ms. Lin

818
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:19,000
looks for in a man.

819
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:20,550
I like men who don't talk much.

820
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:21,720
I can answer this.

821
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:22,950
Although I don't know

822
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,240
what Xi wants in a man,

823
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:24,950
I know

824
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:25,830
what she doesn't want.

825
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:26,830
Tell us.

826
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:29,790
She doesn't like Mr. Han from Han's Technology,

827
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,450
who always wears fancy and colorful clothes.

828
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:32,640
She doesn't like Bonnie from the interpretation department,

829
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,780
who enjoys making inspirational speeches.

830
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,290
She doesn't like Secretary Zhou from the Translator Association of China,

831
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:36,290
who's too smooth.

832
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,070
And...

833
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,110
What?

834
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:40,470
There are so many young men

835
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:42,230
who fell for Lin Xi?

836
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:43,950
Mr. Xu,

837
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,950
you're not very observant.

838
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:47,310
It was quite a spectacle

839
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,950
when they pursued Xi back then.

840
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:50,230
They did everything but use drones to say "I love you."

841
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,150
Try this.

842
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:53,110
Even food can't make you shut up.

843
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:54,030
It seems

844
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,550
Ms. Lin is very popular.

845
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,270
Mr. Xiao,

846
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:57,070
let me show you

847
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:57,870
our progress.

848
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:01,710
Come with me and take a look.

849
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:18,590
Ms. Lin.

850
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:20,230
Do you think

851
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:22,150
it's good to translate this sentence

852
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,190
like this?

853
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,030
It seems you had a great love life

854
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,350
during the years

855
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:27,350
I was away.

856
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,070
I think your translation

857
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,830
is not accurate enough.

858
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,639
Why aren't you leaving?

859
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,630
I need to take my girlfriend home.

860
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:47,510
Now your girlfriend orders you

861
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,710
to go back first.

862
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,389
Why can't you tell them I'm your boyfriend?

863
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:54,449
Is it better to translate it this way?

864
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,230
Mr. Xiao and Lin Xi

865
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:59,270
have a serious attitude towards work.

866
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:00,880
We should learn from them.

867
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,950
Especially you, young man.

868
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,310
I see it. I'll keep it in mind.

869
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:09,540
Have you noticed

870
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:12,070
they seem a good match?

871
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:17,150
Cheng.

872
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:18,350
It's late.

873
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,950
Why haven't you got off work?

874
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:22,390
He's quite something.

875
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:24,270
He sent a resignation letter to Lu Keli.

876
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:25,830
Then, Mr. Zhang asked him

877
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:26,830
to help us.

878
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:27,750
Great.

879
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,670
There'll be someone playing PUBG with me

880
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:29,750
at lunch breaks.

881
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:31,390
Cheng Yao, are you good at it?

882
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,750
Wait a minute.

883
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:35,780
Are you two

884
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,780
showing affection in front of them?

885
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,320
Showing affection?

886
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:41,950
They

887
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:43,110
stay together every day.

888
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:44,750
He's even here to accompany her when she's working overtime.

889
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:45,950
Xiao Yicheng, let me tell you.

890
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,230
As your friend, I have to remind you.

891
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:49,150
Men shouldn't be too clingy.

892
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,990
What's going on?

893
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:03,870
Did I say the wrong thing?

894
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:07,480
I shouldn't have let you come here.

895
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,140
Now we got a problem.

896
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:13,880
Well, let me put this here.

897
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,070
See you tomorrow.

898
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,670
I'm really sorry

899
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,150
for hiding it from you.

900
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:35,230
Let me introduce myself formally.

901
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:35,990
I'm

902
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,630
Lin Xi's boyfriend,

903
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:38,310
Xiao Yicheng.

904
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,550
Nice to meet you.

905
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:45,920
Mr. Xiao,

906
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,760
you're really Xi's boyfriend?

907
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:50,390
It's not April Fool's Day today, right?

908
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:57,190
Pretty?

909
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,830
You did a nice job

910
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:04,990
keeping it a secret.

911
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:06,590
You hid it from us for such a long time.

912
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:07,540
That's right.

913
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,830
If Cheng Yao hadn't let it slip,

914
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:10,290
we wouldn't have known it.

915
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:17,070
Huasheng and Yuyi

916
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,510
are still cooperating,

917
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:19,190
so...

918
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:23,670
I'm old.

919
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:26,270
I have a bad memory.

920
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,670
What were you talking about?

921
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:29,790
You...

922
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:31,700
Why can't I remember anything?

923
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:34,670
My mind is foggy.

924
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:36,970
I've been listening to music.

925
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:42,150
Although I heard everything,

926
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:43,390
I promise

927
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:44,680
I won't tell anyone.

928
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,190
Well,

929
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:49,550
let's go home.

930
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,130
Xiao Yicheng, let's talk.

931
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:28,430
If it's about Tong Xin,

932
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:30,710
we don't need to talk.

933
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:33,350
She's been trying to avoid me lately.

934
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:34,950
Is there really no other way?

935
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:36,870
Cheng Yao,

936
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:39,710
are you serious about Tong Xin?

937
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:40,470
Of course.

938
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:41,870
You answered too fast.

939
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,790
Love is not a joke.

940
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,590
Think it through first.

941
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,230
Cheng Yao.

942
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:49,250
Tong Xin is several years older than you.

943
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:50,310
She had a marriage

944
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:51,390
and has a child.

945
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:54,160
Are you sure you aren't acting on impulse?

946
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:55,230
Xiao Yicheng.

947
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:57,190
Although Tong Xin

948
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,120
is older than me,

949
00:38:58,590 --> 00:38:59,520
she got divorced

950
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:00,910
with a child,

951
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:02,550
and our life experiences

952
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:03,870
are completely different,

953
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:05,470
I still fell in love with her.

954
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:07,390
Because of that, I'm perfectly sure

955
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:08,790
about my determination.

956
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:13,750
I see.

957
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:16,360
As Tong Xin's friend,

958
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:17,910
I really hope

959
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:19,390
she can find a good man.

960
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:22,110
But her heart was broken.

961
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:24,330
For her, starting a new relationship

962
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:26,320
is harder than you imagine.

963
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:30,390
I understand.

964
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:31,190
But I need

965
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:32,270
your help.

966
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:37,190
Since she's the one for you,

967
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:38,840
as your friends,

968
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,880
we definitely support you.

969
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,210
But remember one thing.

970
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:42,750
Don't

971
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:43,990
hurt Tong Xin.

972
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:45,910
Don't worry.

973
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:00,110
Tong Xin, let's talk.

974
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:01,550
-I…
-You're

975
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:03,710
done with work today.

976
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,070
The video conference

977
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:05,590
originally scheduled for tonight

978
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:07,830
has been reschedule for tomorrow morning.

979
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:08,790
Peter is staying

980
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:09,510
at his classmate's place tonight.

981
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:11,970
You don't need to help him with his homework.

982
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:14,630
So...

983
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:20,790
Give me one hour,

984
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:21,480
okay?

985
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:36,550
♫It floats in the air and drifts away♫

986
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:40,030
♫We look for the farthest anticipation♫

987
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:43,630
♫If a storm shakes us♫

988
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:47,280
♫Remember our original direction♫

989
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:50,850
♫Just like a match♫

990
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:54,230
♫Can also light a big fire♫

991
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:59,140
♫I chase the future and never mend my ways♫

992
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,670
♫Even if I fall onto the horizon♫

993
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,220
♫I'll bloom on this land♫

994
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:07,930
What do you want to say?

995
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,910
♫If the flame in my heart never goes out♫

996
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:10,220
I have a friend

997
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:11,870
who has some relationship issues.

998
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,350
I want to hear your advice.

999
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:15,500
♫It's not a failure even if I get hurt♫

1000
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:16,470
Go ahead.

1001
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:18,940
♫If a dream is a sin♫

1002
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,530
♫I'm willing to spend my life with it♫

1003
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:20,550
He fell in love

1004
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:22,010
with a girl older than him.

1005
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:23,430
But that girl

1006
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:28,830
♫I'll continue being stubborn♫

1007
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:24,550
seems to have lots of uncertainties

1008
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:25,950
and hesitations in mind.

1009
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,480
He wants to pursue her bravely.

1010
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:29,550
But she

1011
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:31,190
has been avoiding him.

1012
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:33,090
♫I wait for the day I can fly onto the stage♫

1013
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:32,830
Can you tell me

1014
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:33,830
what he should do

1015
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:36,250
♫And prove my existence with light♫

1016
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:35,110
to get a response?

1017
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:39,790
♫Even the smallest dust♫

1018
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:43,110
♫Can win your favor♫

1019
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:43,840
If you ask my advice,

1020
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:46,520
♫I wait for everything to be settled♫

1021
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,190
here's my answer.

1022
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:50,180
♫When love proves my existence♫

1023
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:50,310
Since the girl chose to refuse,

1024
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:52,440
she must have her own concerns.

1025
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:53,770
♫Even the most ordinary dust♫

1026
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:55,070
I advise your friend not to be too persistent.

1027
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:58,270
♫Has a shining halo♫

1028
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:56,150
What if she's the one

1029
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:57,230
for my friend?

1030
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:04,800
Your friend will be disappointed.

1031
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:06,670
Tong Xin.

1032
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:13,510
Cheng Yao.

1033
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:14,830
I know

1034
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:16,550
the man you're talking about is you.

1035
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:18,280
The woman in the story is me.

1036
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:24,350
Then my answer is

1037
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:24,990
I don't like you.

1038
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:26,790
I've been avoiding you, indeed.

1039
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,590
Because you have

1040
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:29,840
bothered me.

1041
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:30,790
Do you understand?

1042
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:31,790
I don't understand.

1043
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:33,180
Why don't you like him?

1044
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:34,430
When you like someone, there needs to be a reason.

1045
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:37,090
But when you don't like someone, there doesn't.

1046
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:39,790
Then tell me

1047
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:40,990
what you want in a man.

1048
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:49,650
Let me ask you a different way.

1049
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:52,790
You liked Lin Xi, right?

1050
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:55,070
You tossed and turned thinking about her, right?

1051
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:56,270
But how long did your feelings for her last?

1052
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:56,990
Three weeks?

1053
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:57,950
Three months?

1054
00:42:58,390 --> 00:42:59,070
Cheng Yao.

1055
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:00,030
I don't know why you

1056
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:01,470
moved on from Lin Xi to me.

1057
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:02,150
I only see

1058
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:02,870
immaturity

1059
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:03,790
in you.

1060
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:04,830
Your thoughts are hard to follow, and you're changeable.

1061
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:05,630
And this

1062
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:07,030
is what I fear the most.

1063
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:08,090
Do you understand?

1064
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:10,830
Tong Xin,

1065
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:17,320
you can't

1066
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,070
deny my feelings for you

1067
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:20,000
just because I liked someone else.

1068
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:21,990
I can tell you clearly

1069
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:23,630
I like you now.

1070
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:25,920
What about the next moment?

1071
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:29,270
Cheng Yao, I have no time

1072
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:30,070
or energy

1073
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:30,760
to have a relationship with you

1074
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,110
which won't last.

1075
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:33,920
Please leave me alone.

1076
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:40,710
Tong Xin.

1077
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:42,430
I'll prove it to you.
