Professor Gao

10
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:02,190
has high hopes for Shasha.

11
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:02,990
He doesn't want her

12
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,780
to have flaws in her resume.

13
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,270
Professor Gao

14
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,750
never cared about Huasheng's matters.

15
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,110
Yes.

16
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,990
Too much concern leads to troubles,

17
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,150
but Shasha

18
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,990
is a granddaughter he loves very much.

19
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,360
It's understandable for him

20
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,110
to make an exception.

21
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:28,790
Xixi,

22
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,030
take it as me asking a favor from you.

23
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,950
Here is your coffee.

24
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:39,910
Thank you.

25
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:40,750
Please enjoy.

26
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,190
Their coffee

27
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:44,910
is really good.

28
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:45,829
Have a try.

29
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,240
With our relationship,

30
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,700
I don't have to invite you.

31
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,960
Shasha respects you so much.

32
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,670
Can you bear to see

33
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,470

34
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,750

35
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,360
Of course,

36
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,310
this is also what your grandpa,

37

Hello, Lin.

00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,430
How are you?

45
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,030
I'm fine.

46
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,470
I saw the news.

47
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:56,670
Xixi,

48
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,870

53
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,750
are you so touched

why are you so nice?

59
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,590
Alright, go ahead. I'm hanging up.

60
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,620
This is rare.

61
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,080
Lin Xi actually took a fall.

62
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,310
I bet you coffee for a week

63
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,350
that Lin Xi will be fired.

64
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:54,870
Xiaozhe.

65
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,830
Xiaozhe, come here.

66
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,310
Look.

67
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,830
This is revenge for you.

68
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:04,710
Xiaozhe,

69
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,270
you're from the Internet department.

70
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,150
How could you have interactions with Lin Xi?

71
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,950
She complained about me before.

72
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,230
What happened?

73
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,830
It was the company's Internet upgrade.

74
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,300
I thought everything was clear,

75
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,160
but unexpectedly,

76
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,590
Lin Xi was still working overtime in the small meeting room.

77
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:17,870
The Internet was disconnected during the upgrade,

78
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,930
which stopped her video conference.

79
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:20,950
Well...

80
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,990
Logically speaking,

81
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,870
the Internet is upgraded every month

82
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:26,950
at midnight.

83
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,750
I was taking annual leave the next day.

84
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,150
I had a flight at 7 a.m.,

85
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,190
so I moved

86
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,510
the upgrade three hours earlier that day.

87
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,040
Because of that complaint,

88
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,070
Xiaozhe got three months' bonus

89
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,110
deducted

90
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,950
and could barely pay for rent.

91
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,670
You should've explained to her.

92
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:41,590
I did.

93
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:42,680
She said that the system and personal feelings

94
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,830
are separate.

95
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,550
Forget it. Let's not talk about her.

96
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,230
See?

97
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,950
God helped punish her for you.

98
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,550
It counts as revenge for you.

99
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,190
Let me make the introductions.

00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,950

102
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,750
and translator Tan Shasha.

103
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,750
This is the legal manager of the headquarters,

104
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,350
Mr. Bai

105
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,950
and Mi from the PR department

106
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,070
According to the contract

107
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,270
with the Agricultural Product Trade Exhibition,

108
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,910
if Huasheng's mistake

109
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,310
causes Party A to suffer losses,

110
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,710
we must pay double the compensation,

111
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,430
in addition to the compensation

112
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,030
from the insurance company.

113
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,180
However, all of us

114
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,190
checked our email.

115
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,110
No one received

116
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,710
the third comparison table.

117
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,150
Is it possible that

118
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,270
their picture was forged?

119
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,390
I've checked with the Internet department.

120
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,520
There are no traces of photoshopping.

121
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:26,800
We don't know

122
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,030
what happened,

123
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,710
but based on the current situation,

124
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:30,710
I prefer

125
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,110
to mediate with the U.S. party.

126
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:32,990
If so,

127
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,950
it would seem like we're in the wrong.

128
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:35,790
Director Lin,

129
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,550
the public opinion is very serious now.

130
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,430
New Tech Forces is influencing the discourse.

131
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,710
Look at this headline.

There's this one too.

137

Will Huasheng's mistake

138
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,470
bring shame to the entire

139
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:49,390
Chinese translation world?

140
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,510
Many official media accounts are also reposting it.

141
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,590
Huasheng's official account

142
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,150
has over 30,000 comments.

143
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:57,670
Mi,

144
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,250
let’s release a statement first.

145
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,480
The content will basically say

146
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,950
that Huasheng is investigating this matter.

147
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,680
If we make any mistake,

148
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,590
we will not tolerate it.

149
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,190
Okay.

150
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,630
One more thing.

151
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,190
Huasheng reserves the right

152
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,510
to sue against

153
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,840
any malicious slander.

154
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:15,950
I understand,

155
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,550
but this statement

156
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:18,870
can only suppress the public opinion temporarily.

157
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:19,820
If there is no

158
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,070
clear remedy,

159
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,400
it will be troublesome.

160
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,470
What is

161
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,830
the U.S. party saying?

162
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,590
They requested double compensation

163
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,350
five-year translation service for free,

164
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,030
and

165
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,890
a public apology on social media.

166
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,880
The consequences are too serious.

167
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,590
The third comparison table

168
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,909
is absolutely certain.

169
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:39,310
Whether you didn't receive it

170
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,310
or it was accidentally deleted by yourselves,

171
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,430
I'm afraid the compensation is inevitable.

172
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,590
The key now

173
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,510
is to mediate with Oren Corporation

174
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,390
and minimize the compensation.

175
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,550
No matter what,

176
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,210
let's make a statement first.

177
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,070
We'll figure out

178
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,150
the rest afterward.

179
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:56,790
Okay.

180
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:01,710
Excuse me.

181
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,110
Hello?

182
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:05,790
Hello?

183
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,870
Now?

184
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,020
Okay, I'll be right back.

185
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,390
Got it.

186
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:37,950
Professor Gao,

187
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,380
you didn't call us here

188
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,039
to watch you play Go, right?

189
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,110
Life is like a game of Go

190
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,070
with crossing paths.

191
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,790
A winner's mindset

192
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,110
is humble and patient.

193
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,660
A loser's mindset

194
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,390
is acting without regret.

195
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,430
Just get to the point.

196
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,750
Grandpa called you all here today

197
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:00,010
to talk about the Agricultural Product Trade Exhibition.

198
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,260
We have said

199
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,350
what we should say.

200
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,880
Do you want to add anything?

201
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,830
You went to find Xixi?

202
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,150
I called you here

203
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:16,510
to talk about the Agricultural Product Trade Exhibition.

204
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,350
What’s your plan

205
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,710
about this matter?

206
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,380
Haven't you all

207
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,510
arranged it for me?

208
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,990
Arrange what?

209
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,470
I know

210
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,750
you've always looked down on me.

211
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,110
Shasha has to protect her reputation.

212
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:31,790
She can't have

213
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,390
any flaws on her resume.

214
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,030
Anyway, the others

215
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,750
fought tooth and nail along this journey.

216
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,750
They can take insults and injuries.

217
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,640
It won't matter, right?

218
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:41,870
So, this case

219
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,230
should be shouldered by others.

220
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,630
Is that what you all mean?

221
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,110
Is this how you see

222
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,350
your grandpa?

223
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,310
Dad,

224
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,990
Xixi is still young.

225
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,110
She doesn’t have a filter.

226
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,080
Don't mind it.

227
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,710
It's not impossible

228
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,040
for me to take the blame.

229
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,550
I need an exchange.

230
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:57,840
What do you want?

231
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,230
Call my mom

232
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:01,750
and apologize to her.

233
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,670
Nonsense.

234
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,200
Looks like there's nothing to discuss.

235
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,160
I’m leaving.

236
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,430
Xixi.

237
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,310
Xixi.

238
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,510
Lin Xi.

239
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,110
Dad.

240
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,710
Dad, say something.

241
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,030
Grandpa,

242
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:23,070
I was in charge of this project.

243
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,750
I'll take the responsibility for my mistake.

244
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,310
Shasha, don't make trouble.

245
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,030
Sit down.

246
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,350
At your level,

247
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,670
you are not qualified to take responsibility.

248
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,000
Even if I'm not qualified,

249
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,130
you shouldn't be the one responsible.

250
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,670
I'll take responsibility

251
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,540
for this.

252
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,790
Lin Xi.

253
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,270
It's not because of you all.

254
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,830
It's because I promised

255
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:43,950
one the day the priority client management department

256
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,310
was established

257
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,390
that you all just need to

258
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,350
take responsibility for your work

259
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,260
and I'll take care of the rest.

260
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:53,960
I'm leaving.

261
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,390
Wait.

262
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,190
Grandpa,

263
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,830
Lin Xi has nothing to do

264
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,350
with the Agricultural Product Trade Exhibition matter.

265
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,590
I'll apologize to Mr. Zhang.

266
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:03,710
I told you

267
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:04,710
I don't need you.

268
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,430
I also told you

269
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:07,160
it's not your responsibility.

270
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,030
This is how

271
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:15,090
the Gao family's kids should be like.

272
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,190
You two

273
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:20,510
are colleagues and comrades in public

274
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:23,190
and sisters in private.

275
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,350
Now that there's trouble,

276
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,870
you two aren't blaming each other.

277
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:29,110
Instead, you both bravely bear the responsibility.

278
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,390
I'm glad.

279
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,030
Come, sit down.

280
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,190
Sit down.

281
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,190
Come.

282
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:40,900
Dad, have a seat.

283
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:41,510
Okay.

284
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,110
Dad.

285
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,750
Listen to me.

286
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,670
Forty years ago,

287
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,630
I translated an extradition treaty

288
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,840
for the Interpol.

289
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:52,870
However,

290
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,230
one word was wrong,

291
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,710
so both parties

292
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,990
had to study the documents repeatedly.

293
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,390
It not only affected the work progress,

294
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,450
but also delayed the investigation.

295
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,870
I felt very guilty.

296
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,590
What happened after that?

297
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:09,630
My mentor pleaded for me.

298
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,660
I told my mentor

299
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,030
that it was my mistake,

300
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,430
so I must take the responsibility.

301
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,070
I should be penalized.

302
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,470
In the end,

303
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:22,320
I was transferred to the information room

304
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,630
and was put on the sidelines for three years.

305
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,830
At that time,

306
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,910
I worked hard

307
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,430
to study translation.

308
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:31,950
I told myself

309
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:33,700
that I could only

310
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,230
make such a mistake

311
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,780
once in my life.

312
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,600
If you put me on the sidelines for a few years,

313
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,910
I believe I can

314
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,070
stand up again.

315
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,110
Me too.

316
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:47,230
I believe you two can do it.

317
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,070
Dad, this matter...

318
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,150
I won't interfere with

319
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,080
any of Zhang Jiakang's decisions.

320
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,350
Whether it's to punish one

321
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,670
or both of you,

322
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,950
it should be accepted.

323
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,080
Of course.

324
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,990
I agree too.

325
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,070
I'm sorry about my mom

326
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,830
going to you.

327
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,720
You two are separate individuals.

328
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,150
No matter what the punishment result is,

329
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,830
I hope it won't affect

330
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,390
our relationship.

331
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,750
What relationship do we have?

332
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,620
We're family.

333
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:37,190
Is this "love me, love my dog?"

334
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:39,790
Are you

335
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,850
talking about family because of Wei?

336
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:44,710
I'll see you off here.

337
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:45,950
Take care.

338
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,070
Dumb and cute,

339
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,930
she's a perfect match for Wei.

340
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,710
Dad, why did you come down?

341
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,870
Do you want some fruit?

342
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,470
Gao Ling,

343
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,430
Xixi and Shasha

344
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:29,670
are both good children of our family.

345
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,910
I won't give biased treatment.

346
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:38,110
Dad, I understand.

347
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,590
The radish kimchi

348
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,200
from Zhu's Food Factory

349
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,100
is well-known.

350
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:08,030
Haiqiong,

351
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:08,950
if you are willing to help,

352
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,210
I'll be very grateful.

353
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,430
Six thousand tons of radish

354
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:14,190
isn't much to us,

355
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:16,470
but how are you going to thank me?

356
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,710
As far as I know,

357
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,030
you have a five-year

358
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:21,350
overseas strategic deployment plan for the future,

359
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,030
right?

360
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,950
Yuyi is willing to provide

361
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,070
free translation services.

362
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:26,070
What do you think?

363
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:27,750
It sounds

364
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,350
like a very attractive deal.

365
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,710
Thank you, Haiqiong.

366
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,150
Tomorrow morning,

367
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,870
I'll discuss it with my partners

368
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,550
and I'll give you an answer at noon, okay?

369
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,110
Okay.

370
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:38,070
I'll wait for your reply, okay?

371
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:38,630
Okay.

372
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:39,870
Bye.

373
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,750
Kimchi magnate, Zhu Haiqiong?

374
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,190
Do you think she'll agree to it?

375
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,070
Of course.

376
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,470
Think about it.

377
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,350
First,

378
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,750
Senmei's radishes are of good quality.

379
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,510
Zhu's

380
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,110
started with making kimchi.

381
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:00,210
These two are perfect for each other.

382
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,710
Second,

383
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:03,670
they want to

384
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,910
open up the international market in the future.

385
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,390
Yuyi's help

386
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:08,110
will give them a boost.

387
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,590
Third,

388
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:12,190
Zhu's can take this opportunity

389
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,510
to build a charitable image.

390
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:14,590
It will help

391
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:15,430
their marketing in the future,

392
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:16,350
so why not?

393
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,510
Mr. Xiao,

394
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,150
you should go into PR.

395
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:29,790
Stop worrying.

396
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,390
I just don't think

397
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,720
things are this simple.

398
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,620
It's okay. I'm here.

399
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,870
I want to hug you.

400
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:59,670
♫Embraced by love, we attracted each other♫

401
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,490
♫Secrets that haven't been exchanged, you're the answer♫

402
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:08,660
♫Love means that no matter where we go, our hearts are always together♫

403
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,349
Why are you here?

404
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:21,150
Mr. Zhang called an urgent meeting.

405
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:21,869
What is it?

406
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:23,550
The Agricultural Product Trade Exhibition's official website

407
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:26,810
announced they canceled all cooperations with Huasheng.

408
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,730
[Unilateral Termination of Cooperation Agreement]

409
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,870
Our contract with a 10-year client

410
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:32,910
was terminated just like that.

411
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:35,110
This is an embarrassment for Huasheng.

412
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,150
I'll discuss it with the Agricultural Product Trade Exhibition's

413
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:38,880
Chairman Yan

414
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,120
Discuss about what?

415
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,130
Talk about what?

416
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,710
Even if you say

417
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,470
you'll provide free services,

418
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,270
Chairman Yan won’t use us anymore.

419
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:46,990
Besides,

420
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,350
Mr. Wang of Yongyun

421
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,950
has already taken our place.

422
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:56,110
I asked you to investigate yourselves,

423
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:58,590
but it's been all this time and you found nothing.

424
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,190
That vague statement

425
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:01,820
released last night

426
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,710
didn't convince any netizens.

427
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:05,510
It even angered Chairman Yan

428
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:06,910
to make him terminate the contract with us.

429
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,030
Lin Xi,

430
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,710
you disappointed me.

431
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:11,950
Mr. Zhang,

432
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,430
it's not Xi's fault.

433
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:13,950
Who knew

434
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,810
where the comparison table went?

435
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,230
From tomorrow onwards,

436
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,630
all of the priority client management department's projects

437
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:21,660
will be suspended.

438
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,750
Let Lu take over.

439
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,110
Dismissed.

440
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,630
Everyone, take a break

441
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,750
before the punishment from the headquarters

442
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:41,790
comes out.

443
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,150
Okay. Go ahead.

444
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:49,160
It's a stupid company. Who wants to stay here?

445
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:19,160
The priority client management department will probably cease to exist.

446
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,310
Really?

447
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,070
I heard it from HR's Zhang.

448
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,310
So, what department

449
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,910
will they be transferred to?

450
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:27,270
My goodness.

451
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,150
Please don't let Lin Xi

452
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,480
come to our department.

453
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,830
What are you thinking?

454
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:31,950
Would a director

455
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,190
come work as an ordinary translator?

456
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,830
Lin Xi is so proud.

457
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,630
She'll definitely resign and leave.

458
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:37,440
Yes.

459
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,270
She's here.

460
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,870
Director Lin is here.

461
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:51,870
Director Lin.

462
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:52,630
What kind of penalty

463
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:53,270
will your company give you

464
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,310
for your actions?

465
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:54,990
What kind of compensations

466
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:56,070
are planned?

467
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:56,790
As far as I know,

468
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:57,910
the industry has deep opinions about you.

469
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:58,590
Was your mistake

470
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,350
due to carelessness

471
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,350
or because your basic skills

472
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,020
weren't enough?

473
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,270
Please give us a brief explanation.

474
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:02,870
Say something.

475
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:03,670
Director Lin,

476
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:06,240
I'm the chief editor of New Tech Forces.

477
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,350
The International Agricultural Product Assocation

478
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:07,950
announced that

479
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,710
they will no longer work with Huasheng.

480
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:10,750
This matter has been reported on foreign websites

481
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:13,810
[New Tech Forces]

482
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,270
and also caused an uproar.

483
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,630
What do you think about this?

484
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,230
Don't you feel guilty at all?

485
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:19,680
Please refer to Huasheng's official announcement.

486
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,030
I can't answer personally,

487
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:21,670
thank you.

488
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:23,190
Director Lin,

489
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:23,590
please say some more.

490
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,670
Excuse me.

491
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:25,870
Sorry.

492
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:26,710
We've been waiting for a long time.

493
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,030
Please say something.

494
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:28,830
Excuse me. Thank you.

495
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:29,550
Dear netizens,

496
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,030
where I am now

497
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,260
is Huasheng Translation.

498
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,790
The main character of this discourse storm,

499
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:34,270
Lin Xi,

500
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,640
is standing behind me right now.

501
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,870
Faced with the media's interviews,

502
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:38,870
she keeps giving vague answers.

503
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,230
No translator in the industry

504
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,030
has spoken up for her.

505
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,630
Clearly, for this matter—

506
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:43,560
Can you say more?

507
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,480
Yicheng?

508
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,030
Just say a few words.

509
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:45,630
We really waited for a long time.

510
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:46,950
Excuse me.

511
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,230
Mr. Xiao.

512
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,430
Excuse me.

513
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,190
Mr. Xiao, why are you here?

514
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:50,540
Why is Mr. Xiao here?

515
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,150
Mr. Xiao.

516
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,950
Wait for my lawyer's letter.

517
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:54,110
Excuse me.

518
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,150
Don't follow.

519
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:25,110
How about I buy you a ticket

520
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:27,190
and you go on vacation for a few days?

521
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:31,270
It's not my style to run away.

522
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:34,990
Fine.

523
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:40,590
You don't have to

524
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,790
come accompany me.

525
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,720
Go and do your work.

526
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,630
Accompanying you is the most important thing,

527
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:46,470
understand?

528
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,330
You must be hungry.

529
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,810
What would you like to eat?

530
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,500
Hot pot, Japanese food,

531
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,550
or Korean food?

532
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,130
I have no appetite.

533
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:10,670
I'm hungry.

534
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,400
Take it as accompanying me.

535
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,440
Take a rest.

536
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,470
I'll call you when we arrive.

537
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:36,950
Be careful.

538
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,510
Let's go eat.

539
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,550
I have no appetite.

540
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,750
I know a new Japanese restaurant.

541
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,950
It's very delicious.

542
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:46,150
Tian,

543
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:47,350
why don't you go eat with Wang Qiang

544
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,230
and the others?

545
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,630
I'm really not hungry.

546
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,390
Oh, you.

547
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:52,190
You didn't eat breakfast

548
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:53,110
or lunch.

549
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:55,170
Are you trying to become an immortal?

550
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,430
Let's go and eat.

551
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:26,750
Granny.

552
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,270
I want

553
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:30,750
a candied haw

554
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,510
with two layers of sugar coating.

555
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:32,990
Okay.

556
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,240
Five yuan, right?

557
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:34,870
Yes.

558
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,190
This one is better.

559
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,350
This has two layers of sugar coating.

560
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,410
Thank you, Granny.

561
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:42,790
Let's go.

562
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:48,190
Here.

563
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:53,630
Go ahead.

564
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,720
The first bite is the sweetest.

565
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:02,770
Delicious.

566
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:04,870
It's been a long time.

567
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,710
I remember you two.

568
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:07,950
That night,

569
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,790
I think you were drunk too.

570
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:11,990
You have a good memory.

571
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:13,850
My gift for you two.

572
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:15,470
No, we can't take it.

573
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:16,590
I always give freebies

574
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,030
to old customers.

575
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:19,950
Thank you, Granny.

576
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:20,750
Thank you, Granny.

577
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,790
You're welcome.

578
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,760
The first one is for you.

579
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:31,990
Is it good?

580
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:32,590
Yes.

581
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:40,670
Resign.

582
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:45,630
Why?

583
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:46,550
You want to recommend me

584
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:48,080
to work in Singapore again?

585
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,830
Work is so tiring.

586
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:52,040
I can support you financially.

587
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:54,880
You can't use the classic lines like this.

588
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:56,830
Miss Lin,

589
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,920
will you give me the chance?

590
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:04,160
Mr. Xiao, are you proposing?

591
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:04,870
Here?

592
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:06,030
Let me tell you,

593
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:08,030
my household register is in the car.

594
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:10,680
Mr. Xiao,

595
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:11,590
are you

596
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,310
proposing to me while I'm totally

597
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,150
defenseless?

598
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:17,310
You're quite calculative.

599
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:23,190
I'm serious.

600
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:30,190
Sometimes,

601
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,630
I think translating

602
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:32,630
is such hard work,

603
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,790
but then again,

604
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:36,100
isn't every job hard?

605
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:38,280
It's hard to make candied haws too.

606
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,910
But you did a good job.

607
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,750
One day,

608
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,310
if I quit as a translator,

609
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,790
I'll open a candied haw shop.

610
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:48,670
That's not bad.

611
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,030
Granny,

612
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,640
will you sell your shop?

613
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:58,160
No, no.

614
00:25:58,430 --> 00:25:58,950
No.

615
00:25:58,950 --> 00:25:59,270
Granny,

616
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,350
let me know if you want to sell it.

617
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,150
What?

618
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:02,670
You're crazy.

619
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,390
The high and mighty Mr. Xiao

620
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:08,310
wants to fight others for a candied haw store.

621
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,510
Aren't you afraid of

622
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:10,390
getting laughed at?

623
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:11,430
So what?

624
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:12,390
I'm not afraid.

625
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:13,870
You did a good job.

626
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:15,150
Keep up the good work.

627
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,990
Director Lin is so popular.

628
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:19,510
I don't dare to do a bad job.

629
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:21,510
As the saying goes,

630
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:25,570
it's easy to dodge a bullet, but it's hard to guard against a hidden arrow.

631
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:30,990
What?

632
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:32,910
What what?

633
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:35,590
What did you just say?

634
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,310
I said

635
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:39,550
Director Lin is so popular.

636
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:45,250
It's easy to dodge a bullet, but it's hard to guard against a hidden arrow.

637
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:46,830
I got it.

638
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:47,920
Let's go.

639
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:50,070
What did you think of?

640
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,530
Be careful of the pebbles.

641
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,680
Investigate for a mole?

642
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,030
Director Lin,

643
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,830
you're being paranoid.

644
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:02,550
You deleted the email by mistake,

645
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,270
but you insist

646
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:05,150
that the company has a mole trying to mess with you.

647
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:06,110
Lin Xi,

648
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,630
are you trying to break up the company?

649
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:11,350
The situation with the third comparison table

650
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,870
is absolutely certain,

651
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,470
but no one in the priority client management department

652
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:15,350
received the email.

653
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,480
This is too strange,

654
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,640
so I have a reason to believe

655
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,870
that someone is behind this.

656
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:21,230
How long are you going to investigate for?

657
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:23,430
You can't keep investigating for years

658
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:24,750
until the case is cold, right?

659
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:25,470
Three days.

660
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:28,340
What if you can't find the reason after three days?

661
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,270
I'll resign

662
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:32,310
and quit the translation industry.

663
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,370
Don't mess around.

664
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,710
I'll suppress it

665
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,030
at the headquarters for now.

666
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:46,830
Give me

667
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,600
a result within three days.

668
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:49,830
Thank you.

669
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,150
Is it the Internet department?

670
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:54,550
I'm looking for XIaozhe.

671
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,340
Xiaozhe, this is Lin Xi.

672
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:07,670
Please help me find

673
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:08,350
the records

674
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,030
from the 11th to the 20th

675
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,350
of last month.

676
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:11,950
Check the email traces

677
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:14,310
sent to Huasheng from the Agricultural Product Trade Exhibition.

678
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,340
Director Lin,

679
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,910
this workload is quite large

680
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:18,030
and we have

681
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,190
have other work to do.

682
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:21,520
I'm afraid we don't have enough manpower.

683
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:23,160
Then, when will you be free?

684
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:25,670
Maybe in a week.

685
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:26,790
That long?

686
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:27,790
Yes.

687
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:29,990
Got it.

688
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,350
How is it?

689
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,870
They are short-handed.

690
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:38,190
The soonest they can check is next week.

691
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:40,390
How about we ask

692
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:41,510
external experts to help us?

693
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:42,270
No,

694
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,070
this is confidential.

695
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:44,830
We can sign

696
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:45,870
an NDA with them.

697
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,270
We'd need to go to the headquarters

698
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:50,590
and take an authorization letter

699
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:52,390
for them to give us the computer.

700
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:55,030
What should we do now?

701
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:25,990
Director Lin, what do you want?

702
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:32,910
Ye Xiaozhe,

703
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:34,030
27 years old,

704
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:36,190
entered Huasheng for three and a half years ago,

705
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:38,460
was awarded as an excellent employee twice,

706
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,460
and given a quarterly penalty once.

707
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:41,910
Why are you trying to say?

708
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:44,700
The penalty

709
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:46,910
was because of my complaint, right?

710
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,270
Do you think I was wrong?

711
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:51,430
Director Lin

712
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,750
you always have your way in the company.

713
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,010
How could you be wrong?

714
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,710
For the online upgrade every half a month,

715
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:00,000
all of the company's departments

716
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,070
upload their schedules that day

717
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,750
into the company group chat.

718
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,230
The purpose

719
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,270
is so your department

720
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,390
can schedule your upgrade time without conflicts.

721
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:09,150
The priority client management department

722
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:10,390
uploaded our announcement

723
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:11,590
two days in advance,

724
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,390
but you didn't see it.

725
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,870
Because of your upgrade,

726
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:18,190
my video conference

727
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,470
with my foreign client was cut off

728
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:21,000
and I lost the order.

729
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,150
Do you hate me

730
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:24,110
because of this?

731
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:26,550
No.

732
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:34,250
Regarding the comparison table,

733
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:35,870
whether I'm dismissed

734
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:39,070
or the priority client management department is canceled,

735
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,190
the end result

736
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:42,120
is that Huasheng is harmed.

737
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:51,550
Did you send this to the other party yet?

738
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:53,510
Yes.

739
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,240
That's good.

740
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:07,490
Chief Editor Chen,

741
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,270
Mr. Xiao doesn't have time for guests.

742
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,470
Please go back first.

743
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:11,750
Maomao.

744
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,470
Go do you work.

745
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:28,350
[Junyue Law Firm]

746
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,230
What's the meaning

747
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,630
of this lawyer's letter?

748
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:34,230
Chief Editor Chen,

749
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:35,990
don't you know?

750
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,710
What did I do wrong?

751
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,390
We've known each other for over ten years.

752
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:43,550
If it weren't for the fact

753
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:45,880
that we've been classmates for more than ten years,

754
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,790
you'd receive more

755
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:48,390
than just a lawyer's letter.

756
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,400
You can be

757
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,310
this heartless for Lin Xi?

758
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,590
For Lin Xi,

759
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:57,830
I can be even more heartless.

760
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:00,800
I just published an article normally.

761
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:03,390
Why are you doing this to me?

762
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,630
You made things up

763
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,590
without evidence.

764
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:13,910
Dozens of tabloid accounts under you

765
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:15,390
followed suit

766
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:16,790
at the same time

767
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:20,510
and colluded with Lin Xi's rivals

768
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:21,910
to slander her.

769
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:26,240
This was all your doing, right?

770
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:43,880
Xiao Yicheng,

771
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:46,230
don't you understand

772
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,510
why I did this?

773
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:51,520
I've guarded you for so many years.

774
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,450
Whether it was eight years ago

775
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:56,150
or eight years later,

776
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:59,030
you still only care about Lin Xi.

777
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,670
Who understands

778
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,350
my pain?

779
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:16,950
What part of me

780
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,870
is worse than Lin Xi?

781
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:21,590
Chen Xiao,

782
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,030
let me tell you.

783
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,030
When Lin Xi is in pain,

784
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:29,950
she only tries

785
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:31,610
to make herself less painful,

786
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:33,750
but you

787
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:38,310
will only ruin the person who makes you suffer.

788
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:40,710
This is the difference between you and her.

789
00:33:59,070 --> 00:33:59,670
Okay.

790
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:09,580
Your computer.

791
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,510
Your deletion traces.

792
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:12,940
[Delete email]

793
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:13,860
[Empty trash]

794
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:17,409
I didn't delete it.

795
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:18,790
Where were you

796
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:19,750
on the 21st

797
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:20,630
at 1:43 P.M.?

798
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,150
I was having a meeting with Cheng Yao

799
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,070
in the second conference room.

800
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,989
Everyone's computer has a password.

801
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:34,989
Other than you, who else can open it?

802
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:37,429
Everyone in the priority client management department knows

803
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:38,670
my password is 150203.

804
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:40,400
It's the day I joined Huasheng.

805
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,030
Mr. Zhang,

806
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:44,960
I don’t accept the conviction.

807
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,690
I request to check the CCTV footage from that day.

808
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,110
Can we retrieve the CCTV?

809
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:51,909
The property management company

810
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:52,880
updated the surveillance system those days.

811
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,540
I can't guarantee I can find it.

812
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,630
Please try.

813
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:05,070
Look.

814
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:06,790
Let's go.

815
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:09,990
Lin Xi.

816
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:11,710
Did you find out

817
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:12,840
who was behind this?

818
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:17,020
Any suspects?

819
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:19,470
Xi,

820
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:21,430
that guy is too cunning.

821
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:23,230
I'll kill him if I find him.

822
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:25,310
How about we call the police?

823
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:26,310
No.

824
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:27,430
If we call the police,

825
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:28,740
it will negatively affect the company.

826
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,870
No matter who it is,

827
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:30,950
once they're exposed,

828
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:33,510
they won't be able to survive in the translation field anymore.

829
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:34,440
Get back to work.

830
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,230
Did you find it?

831
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:45,310
No.

832
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,670
But there are three cameras

833
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:50,710
that went black for about six minutes.

834
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:51,270
One of them

835
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:52,550
faces the front of your office.

836
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,470
Can the blacked out parts

837
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:54,440
be fixed?

838
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:55,940
No.

839
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,710
You can't, or you don't want to?

840
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:59,990
I can't and I don't want to.

841
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:01,230
Director Lin,

842
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,670
look at the time.

843
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:03,710
I'm still working overtime

844
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:04,430
to help you

845
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:05,470
watch it frame by frame.

846
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:06,870
I have to get off work now.

847
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:09,110
Let's eat first.

848
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:13,150
Shall we chat?

849
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,000
What do you want?

850
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,470
Xiao Yicheng.

851
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:44,450
He can recover the footage

852
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:46,450
before noon tomorrow.

853
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:49,790
How did you persuade him?

854
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:50,670
Benefits.

855
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:55,350
You gave him benefits?

856
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:58,390
I gave him an internal promotion for a big company.

857
00:36:58,390 --> 00:36:59,270
That's it?

858
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:02,870
How can a graduate of Faculty of Computer Science

859
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:04,670
willingly be a network manager?

860
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:08,150
Let's eat.

861
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,030
How's your heart?

862
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,280
Who is it?

863
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,720
Take a look if you have a healthy heart.

864
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:04,590
You can tell at a glance

865
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:05,590
that it's a different vegetable.

866
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:06,650
What did you write?

867
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:07,990
You used the same word for everything.

868
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:09,310
Are you crazy?

869
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:24,390
Was it someone from

870
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,250
Lu Keli's team?

871
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:28,990
What's wrong?

872
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,450
The data can't be restored?

873
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:36,030
I'm going out.

874
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:47,110
Lin Xi looks so pale.

875
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:48,990
What happened?

876
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:12,790
Who is horrible enough

877
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:14,040
to throw trash outside someone's door?

878
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,570
What kind of person is that?

879
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,350
Look at this.

880
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:21,590
Miss,

881
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:23,320
do you know who threw the trash?

882
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:24,510
Wait for me.

883
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:26,270
I don't know. I didn't see it.

884
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:27,870
So immoral.

885
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:10,000
Who are you looking for?

886
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,430
Is Chen Wen here?

887
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:14,750
No.

888
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:15,310
Listen,

889
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:17,020
no one can take this order from me.

890
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,230
I haven't had a gig

891
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:18,950
in months.

892
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:19,670
If this continues,

893
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:20,830
I'll starve.

894
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:22,270
No.

895
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:23,310
Over there.

896
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,070
Who is it?

897
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:34,230
I'm Lin Xi.

898
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:44,190
You're here?

899
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:50,550
Are you coming out or should I go in?

900
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:01,470
When will my goods arrive?

901
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:20,350
You work for Lu Keli?

902
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:31,570
Did someone threaten you?

903
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:37,430
You can tell me

904
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:38,270
if you have difficulties.

905
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:40,150
I'll help you solve the problem.

906
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:50,870
The dismissal notice

907
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:52,220
will be posted on the official website today.

908
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:52,950
You planned to fire me

909
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:54,550
after the probation period is over.

910
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:55,710
I won't be able to stay anyway,

911
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:56,510
right?

912
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:59,030
What did I do

913
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:00,290
that made you think so?

914
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:04,150
When I was at the construction site,

915
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,710
you called me to check the document

916
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:07,770
and you thought I wasn't good enough.

917
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:09,790
At that time, I knew

918
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:11,330
I wouldn't be able to stay.

919
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:20,390
I've been strict with you

920
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:21,020
because

921
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:22,590
I've been helping you get better benefits

922
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:24,400
after you become an official employee.

923
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,270
Whatever.

924
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,070
This the result.

925
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:28,730
You can say whatever you want.

926
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:30,150
Then why did you

927
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:31,080
delete my email?

928
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:38,350
You just scolded me that day

929
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:39,910
and you wanted to deduct points from my performance.

930
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:41,030
I was very angry.

931
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:42,110
I was angry, so I...

932
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:44,830
I regretted it,

933
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:46,590
but I deleted it too thoroughly.

934
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:48,150
I couldn't find it back.

935
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:53,270
You made a mistake,

936
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:54,670
but it sounds like

937
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:55,920
I was wrong for criticizing you.

938
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,780
You were right.

939
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:58,470
You're always right.

940
00:42:58,470 --> 00:42:59,350
You are Lin Xi.

941
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:00,610
How could you be wrong?

942
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,910
I was wrong.

943
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:04,390
I just wrote the wrong date,

944
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:05,750
or turned a full-width into half-width.

945
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:06,670
There were even many things

946
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:07,630
that shouldn't be my work,

947
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:08,760
but you made me do it.

948
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:10,190
I couldn't complain.

949
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:11,830
If I did something wrong, I had to get scolded by you.

950
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:13,590
Why did you always give me

951
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:14,910
the hardest and worst work?

952
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:16,750
Why were you able to

953
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:18,110
rain insults on me

954
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:19,640
for the smallest mistakes?

955
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:22,110
I'm just an ordinary person.

956
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,590
I feel pain too.

957
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:25,030
So, my training for you

958
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:26,800
was painful for you.

959
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:28,430
Training?

960
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:30,710
Don't make it sound so nice.

961
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:32,230
You are a workplace bully.

962
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:40,320
Do you remember how there were nine people

963
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,340
who interviewed with you?

964
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:43,400
Eight of them

965
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,910
graduated from top schools,

966
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:46,390
but I chose you in the end.

967
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:48,880
Do you know why?

968
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:52,390
Because I saw

969
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:53,950
traces of myself on you.

970
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:56,910
You don't have a high starting point,

971
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:58,310
but you work hard enough.

972
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:00,710
Huasheng has more than enough

973
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:01,550
excellent people.

974
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:02,340
We can only

975
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:03,510
surpass them

976
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:04,590
by working harder than them.

977
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:06,150
I don't need it.

978
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:08,670
You don't understand.

979
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:09,470
Yes.

980
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:11,630
Maybe you were like me

981
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:13,710
and didn't graduate from a good school,

982
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:15,430
but your grandpa is Professor Gao.

983
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:16,430
Your dad is a businessman.

984
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:17,440
Your family isn't short of money.

985
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,900
How can I compare with you?

986
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:21,650
Look at this place.

987
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:25,470
I want to check some information,

988
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:26,750
but the Internet isn't good enough.

989
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:28,800
I want to read some books quietly,

990
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,550
but next door,

991
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:31,810
upstairs, and downstairs are all noisy.

992
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:33,590
We will never

993
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:35,070
be the same kind of people.

994
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:38,790
Lin Xi,

995
00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:41,630
have you ever thought

996
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:44,320
that I don't need to make a name for myself?

997
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:46,070
I just want

998
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:47,630
a comfortable bed

999
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:50,030
so that I can sleep well for one night,

1000
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:51,670
but no.

1001
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:54,950
You only rush me

1002
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:55,910
to work,

1003
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:57,110
while I

1004
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:00,430
can't even bear to change my phone screen

1005
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:01,630
when it shatters.

1006
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:03,510
Stop pretending that it's all

1007
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:04,630
for my sake.

1008
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:06,190
Do you think I'm the only one

1009
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:07,630
at Huasheng who hates you?

1010
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:08,630
The administrative department,

1011
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:09,350
interpretation department,

1012
00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:09,870
translation department,

1013
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:10,870
publicity department...

1014
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:12,590
Do you know how many people

1015
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:13,390
hate you in the company?

1016
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:14,350
Or,

1017
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,320
do you know how many people in the company

1018
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,630
don't hate you?

1019
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:25,550
You came to me today

1020
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:28,750
just to make me feel guilty,

1021
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:32,270
but Lin Xi...

1022
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:33,870
Xi,

1023
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:36,190
I really can't take it anymore.

1024
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:37,430
Leave!

1025
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:53,050
Turn in your resignation.

1026
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:55,150
Otherwise, you won't be able to last

1027
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:56,010
in this circle.

1028
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:59,030
I don't need you to pretend to be a saint.

1029
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:30,790
Are you okay?

1030
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:38,660
Let me lean on you.

1031
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:41,190
Just for a moment.
