Planning to escape?

11
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,500
You're awake.

12
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,790
Why are you here?

13
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,250
Did you forget?

14
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,870
Wear your robe properly.

15
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:53,350
Done.

16
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,829
Why am I here?

17
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,140
Someone was very drunk last night.

18
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,950
I thought you wouldn't want Grandma Li

19
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:06,470
to see you

20
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,420
in such a mess.

21
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,110
Then why are you here?

22
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,950
I was going to leave,

23
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,190
but someone clung to me

24
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,450
and wouldn't let me go.

25
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:35,750
Don't go.

26
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,950
You expect me to believe that?

27
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,350
You didn't leave just because I clung to you?

28
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,630
Where did you sleep?

29
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,350
The sofa.

30
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,490
Not only did you stop me from leaving,

31
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,190
but you also told me that...

32
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,550
Told me that...

33
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:01,830
Forget it.

34
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,310
I'll take it as a drunk talk.

35
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,440
I won't believe you.

36
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,150
I'm a good drinker.

37
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:08,550
Don't lie to me.

38
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:09,270
Really?

39
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,670
Who was it that

40
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:11,590
got drunk at Sun Youwei's

00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:12,240
wine party

42
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,170
and made a scene?

43
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:17,870
You...

44
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:18,940
really don't want to know

45
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:19,710
what you said

46
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:20,550
last night?

47
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:23,590
Fine.

48
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,030
Tell me.

49
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,470
What did I say?

50
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,150
Last night,

51
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,150
you hugged me and cried.

52
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,830
You said

53
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,630
you regretted breaking up with me

54
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,790
and begged me to forgive you.

55
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,180
You wanted to get back together with me.

56
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,920
Are you nervous?

58
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,760
Don't try to lie to me.

59
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,430
I knew you would say that.

60
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,670
Listen.

61
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,230
Xiao Yicheng.

62
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,150
I regret it.

63
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,510
I shouldn't have broken up with you.

64
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,590
Please forgive me.

65
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,030
Xixi.

66
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,520
People tell the truth when they are drunk.

67
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,950
So you've always loved me.

68
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,350
Why didn't you tell me?

69
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:31,950
Enough.

70
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:42,050
This must be synthesized.

71
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:43,710
This...

72
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,030
Let the machine speak.

73
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,150
Let the machine speak for anyone,

74
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,880
and let anyone speak anything.

75
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,230
Ma from your R&D Room

76
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,159
told me about it.

00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:59,750
Xiao Yicheng.

81
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:01,870
You liar.

82
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:03,950
But...

83
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,950
Your voice can be imitated,

84
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,230
but how can we synthesize

85
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,430
something that sounds so emotional?

86
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,070
Right?

87
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,230
Wrong!

88
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,750
You...

89
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,190
If I was drunk,

90
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,270
I'd have slurred my words.

91
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,200
I couldn't have spoken so clearly.

92
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:26,810
Don't lie to me.

93
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,710
You found out so quickly.

94
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:30,750
I thought

95
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,480
I could hold on a little longer.

96
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,050
Delete the recording.

97
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:21,590
Xiao Yicheng.

98
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,230
Thank you.

99
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:28,550
Thank you

100
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,110
for being with me and comforting me

101
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,350
when I was at my weakest.

102
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:35,870
Thank you

103
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,350
for not giving up on me.

104
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,710
And thank you

105
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,910
for tolerating

106
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,870
my indifference,

107
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,590
rejections,

108
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,400
and unreasonable moments.

109
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,150
Actually, when we broke up,

110
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,390
I always wanted to tell you...

111
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,590
Xiao Yicheng?

112
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,360
I'm going to the office.

113
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:45,130
The documentary needs additional filming.

114
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,190
Hello?

115
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,050
This is Zhu. Do you remember me?

116
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,190
Zhu.

117
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,230
Tonight,

118
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,390
I invited a few of your classmates

119
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,230
to my restaurant for a small gathering.

120
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,070
Are you free?

121
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,150
Is Xiao Yicheng going?

122
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,080
He's coming too.

123
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,080
I'll go.

124
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,150
Have a rest.

125
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:54,870
Okay.

126
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,150
Zhu just called me.

127
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,240
He wants to invite

128
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,040
some old friends to a gathering.

129
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,670
When I first entered school,

130
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,000
he just opened his shop.

131
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:11,430
You can say that we've experienced

132
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:13,190
the shop's start-up phase together.

133
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,870
I have an interview this afternoon.

134
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,800
I'll meet you after the interview.

135
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:18,550
Okay.

136
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,910
These are the best clothes

137
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,110
from my wife's place.

138
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,550
When you serve the dishes,

139
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,470
you need to dance first.

140
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,550
I can't.

141
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,630
When it comes to dancing...

142
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,200
Xiao.

143
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:34,870
Xiao.

144
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,440
Long time no see.

145
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,910
Zhu, you...

146
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,780
You gained weight so rapidly.

147
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,910
Time is merciless.

148
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:44,470
Zhu,

149
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,470
how did you

150
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:46,390
get her to come?

151
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,790
What do you mean by how?

152
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,830
She came when she heard

153
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:49,760
you were coming.

154
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,110
Zhu.

155
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,470
Long time no see.

156
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:56,830
Beauty Chen.

157
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,620
Long time no see.

158
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,310
Let me see.

159
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,240
You haven't changed at all.

160
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,750
You've changed a lot.

161
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,110
I almost didn't recognize you.

162
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,910
Time is merciless.

163
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,910
Yicheng.

164
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:10,910
If I had known

165
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,270
the interview ended so early today,

166
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,530
I would have picked you up at the company.

167
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,200
Who are you with now?

168
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,990
Well, everyone is here.

169
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:41,870
Please.

170
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,110
Let's go.

171
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,110
Alright.

172
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,550
Everyone is here.

173
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,590
All these years, except me,

174
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,110
everyone barely changed.

175
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,510
It's been years.

176
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,990
How has everyone been?

177
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,510
Chen Xiao, it's been years.

178
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,150
You're getting prettier.

179
00:12:59,150 --> 00:12:59,870
Thank you.

180
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:00,790
I've read every article

181
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,990
on your public account.

182
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,520
You're the headline queen.

183
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:04,670
Thank you for your support.

184
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:07,070
This is Wang's salted lemon soda.

185
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:08,390
Yes.

186
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,710
Zhu's side dishes

187
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,270
and Wang's salted lemon soda

188
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,390
are a perfect match.

189
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:12,870
That's right.

190
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:13,390
Thank you.

191
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:15,150
Chen Xiao ordered

192
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,280
these for everyone.

193
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,680
Let me introduce everyone.

194
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:20,710
Kevin, Liya.

195
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,350
They majored in law at your school.

196
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:23,950
You've been married for years, right?

197
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:24,390
Yes.

198
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,550
Is your kid in kindergarten now?

199
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,150
Yes.

200
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,790
Xiao Yicheng.

201
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:28,790
Do you remember me?

202
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,430
We played a few rounds

203
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:30,440
of basketball before.

204
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,350
King of Rebound, Kevin.

205
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,150
Of course.

206
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,230
These are Liu and Jiaojiao.

207
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,140
They were from the Department of Civil Engineering.

208
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,630
Time flies.

209
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,070
I remember

210
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,530
we often met you guys here.

211
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,550
Yes.

212
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,480
How many months?

213
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,670
34 weeks.

214
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,550
I told her to stay at home

215
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,540
instead of attending the gathering.

216
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,350
But she insisted on coming.

217
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,540
I can't do anything about her.

218
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,870
Why are you saying this?

219
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:56,030
This is Zou Xiaoyu from the Faculty of Computer Science.

220
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:58,350
This is Xia Ming from the Department of Journalism.

221
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,750
I heard that

222
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,750
Xia Ming, the genius of our department,

223
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,270
worked so hard

224
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,820
to chase you back then.

225
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,910
Not at all.

226
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:06,590
How is it?

227
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,710
Have you succeeded?

228
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:08,710
Almost.

229
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,910
Almost? Seriously?

230
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:11,750
It's been so many years.

231
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,830
You're so lame.

232
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:13,830
Exactly.

233
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,150
I don't think

234
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,550
I need to introduce them.

235
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:19,670
Xiao Yicheng from the Faculty of Computer Science.

236
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,710
He ignored the girls

237
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,260
at his school who adored him.

238
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,390
But Lin Xi from the school next door

239
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,520
captured his heart.

240
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,710
When you two were together,

241
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,110
the girls from Haijiang University

242
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,230
were so jealous.

243
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,230
Yes.

244
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,030
I heard about it too.

245
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,390
Are you married?

246
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,030
Yeah.

247
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:35,350
Not yet.

248
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,550
Did you not propose?

249
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,590
Lin Xi.

250
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,310
If his proposal is not romantic,

251
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,630
you can't say yes.

252
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,600
I have something good for everyone.

253
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,270
What is it?

254
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,230
Coming.

255
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,830
Wedding candies?

256
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:53,990
My goodness.

257
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:55,960
Congratulations.

258
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,550
Yours, Zhu?

259
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,230
Whose wedding candy is this?

260
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,190
Mine. Who else?

261
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,140
Yours?

262
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:00,670
Yes.

263
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,470
We just got married last week.

264
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,350
You told me

265
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,430
you were not into marriages.

266
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:04,670
That was before.

267
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:05,950
-Thank you.
-I remember

268
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,550
there was a girl in freshman year who

269
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,710
pursued him from freshman to sophomore.

270
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,910
He declined her all the way.

271
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,430
Yes.

272
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:12,710
I'm curious.

273
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,590
What kind of girl

274
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,230
got him to settle down?

275
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,910
Yes, I'm curious too.

276
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:20,110
Even wedding candies can't shut you up.

277
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,870
Of course, she is

278
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,270
the most beautiful woman in the world.

279
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,230
Honey.

280
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,590
Welcome.

281
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,790
Here, have some fruit.

282
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:31,660
Thank you. Hello, Mrs. Zhu.

283
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,190
Here, have some fruit.

284
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:32,870
Thank you.

285
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,270
Here, honey.

286
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,550
Let me introduce her to everyone.

287
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,630
My wife, Ashma.

288
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:40,590
Great!

289
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:41,430
Zhu.

290
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:42,710
I didn't expect a rough man like you

291
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,430
to have

292
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:44,630
such a beautiful wife.

293
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,550
Who's the rough man?

294
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,750
Zhu, you are so lucky.

295
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,390
Congratulations.

296
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,390
Wish you a happy life together.

297
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:49,960
Thank you.

298
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,990
Thank you, everyone.

299
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,050
Have a seat, honey.

300
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,550
Ashma was my first love.

301
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,270
I stayed in Yunnan these years

302
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,710
to get her back.

303
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,790
Speaking of which,

304
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,390
you have to explain things to everyone.

305
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,070
Yes.

306
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:05,910
What happened?

307
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:06,630
Yes.

308
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:08,510
Ashma and I

309
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,590
broke up in college.

310
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,550
It was all my fault.

311
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,390
I was too proud to give in.

312
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:15,990
Until a few years ago,

313
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:17,230
I had a car accident.

314
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,470
Are you better now?

315
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:19,270
-Are you okay?
-A car accident?

316
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,390
I'm fine.

317
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,710
I survived.

318
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,590
But

319
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:25,430
the moment before I fainted,

320
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,190
the first thing I thought of

321
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,350
was to see her.

322
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,540
So after I was discharged,

323
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,590
I left this shop

324
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,910
to my sister

325
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,110
and went straight to Tengchong for her.

326
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,750
So romantic.

327
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:40,990
Enjoy yourselves.

328
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:41,790
I'll get cooking.

329
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:42,670
Okay.

330
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:43,630
Thank you.

331
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,950
Don't forget the fatty sausages.

332
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,550
They all like it.

333
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,430
Yes.

334
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:49,840
Thank you.

335
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,590
Thank you.

336
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,230
All these years,

337
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,310
have you ever thought about

338
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:54,710
being with someone else?

339
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,110
To be honest,

340
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,720
I don't know why I persisted

341
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,950
for all these years.

342
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,590
Maybe liking her

343
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:05,349
is a kind of persistence in itself.

344
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,109
You have no idea

345
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:12,390
how scared I was.

346
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,310
I was afraid she was married.

347
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,440
I was afraid she'd forgotten about me.

348
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:39,310
Honey.

349
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,270
Honey.

350
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:40,950
Here.

351
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,590
I called everyone here today

352
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,550
mainly to see everyone again.

353
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:49,830
Secondly,

354
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:52,910
I plan to close this shop

355
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,510
and go back to Tengchong with Ashma.

356
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:56,990
You don't plan to come back?

357
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,470
Xiahai is great.

358
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:00,950
It's bustling with life and very modern.

359
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,710
But for me,

360
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:04,030
I just want to lead a peaceful life

361
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,550
with Ashma.

362
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:08,640
Come.

363
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:13,750
Ashma and I

364
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,910
will use salted lemon soda instead of wine

365
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,190
and wish

366
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,070
all married couples

367
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:22,430
a blissful marriage that lasts forever.

368
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:25,070
We hope unmarried couples

369
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,750
will cherish the one in front of you.

370
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,310
Cheers.

371
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,590
Cheers! Cheers!

372
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:39,910
Cheers. Thank you

373
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,230
for your company.

374
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,430
Congratulations.

375
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:44,870
Come on.

376
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,590
Let's take a photo.

377
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,630
Sure. Come on.

378
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:48,760
Let's go over there.

379
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,350
Waiter, bring the camera here.

380
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:50,830
Come on.

381
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:51,670
Come on.

382
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,510
Honey, here.

383
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:54,710
Come.

384
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:55,990
We'll stand in the middle.

385
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:02,190
[Zhu's Restaurant]

386
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:57,510
Come on.

387
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,070
Here.

388
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,190
The pregnant lady is here.

389
00:18:59,190 --> 00:18:59,920
Slow down.

390
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,790
Slow down.

391
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:01,550
Look at the camera.

392
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,190
Come on.

393
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,150
Yicheng.

394
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,470
May I have a word with you?

395
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:22,870
Sure.

396
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,360
You can talk right here.

397
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,050
I'll wait for you in front.

398
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:31,640
I don't want to

399
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,510
explain things to you again later.

400
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:34,590
Xiao Yicheng.

401
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,110
Have I never existed

402
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,350
in your heart before?

403
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,670
I'm sorry.

404
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:43,630
I thought I already

405
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:44,690
made it very clear.

406
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,390
What did I lose at?

407
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,310
Do you know how bad Lin Xi's reputation

408
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,790
is in the industry?

409
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,710
She called so many people

410
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:56,770
her stepbrothers.

411
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:58,750
Do you really believe

412
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,510
she and those men

413
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:00,830
are just friends?

414
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:01,760
What do you mean?

415
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,350
What you like

416
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:04,790
is just

417
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,500
your eight years of obsession.

418
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:06,990
Yes.

419
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,500
You're right.

420
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:11,150
I'm obsessed with this relationship.

421
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:13,950
Eight years ago,

422
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,890
maybe love was enough for you.

423
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:18,150
But you have Yuyi now.

424
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,150
I

425
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,790
can utilize all my media resources

426
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,470
to help you.

427
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,190
Yicheng.

428
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,510
Will you really not consider me?

429
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:34,190
Chen Xiao.

430
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:36,870
If a person

431
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:38,470
chooses a woman

432
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:39,750
he doesn't love

433
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,410
for the success of his career,

434
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:42,910
would you still like him?

435
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,310
I will.

436
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,550
You won't.

437
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,830
Xiao Yicheng!

438
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,550
You'll regret it!

439
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,150
I will make you regret it.

440
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,470
Am I really as bad

441
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:23,510
as she said?

442
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:29,110
You're worse than she said.

443
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:35,030
Then,

444
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,790
why do you want to see me?

445
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:39,990
What do you think?

446
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,040
Actually, I've always wanted to tell you this.

447
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:54,390
I didn't tell you the truth

448
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,090
when we broke up back then.

449
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:59,710
At that time,

450
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:01,270
I got

451
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,600
an offer from Huasheng.

452
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,720
You were afraid that if you told me,

453
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:05,910
I'd give up the chance

454
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,470
to study abroad,

455
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:09,390
thus ruining my future.

456
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:12,390
But you didn't want to

457
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,920
give up your dream either.

458
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,270
Lin Xi.

459
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,790
What is the difference

460
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:24,430
between your current reason

461
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,870
and the one you told me

462
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,230
when you broke up with me?

463
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,630
Aren't they all the same?

464
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:35,990
I think you need to know.

465
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:37,750
Why?

466
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,150
Why?

467
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,430
No reason.

468
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:01,790
Okay.

469
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,760
Let me change the question.

470
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:06,450
If we went back to eight years ago,

471
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,390
would you still break up with me?

472
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:15,750
Yes.

473
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:19,830
Because that's why

474
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:20,790
you love me.

475
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,960
Why am I still a little nervous?

476
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,850
♫Slowly, between our memories♫

477
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:13,800
♫Distance is the slowly melting thin ice♫

478

♫Being loved by people I love makes me dizzy with happiness♫

00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:45,220
♫When I hesitate and have doubts, you hold me tight♫

483
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:49,600
♫I'm sure♫

484
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:56,250

00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,190
I'm on my way.

492
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,390
Xiao Yicheng.

493
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:56,110
You're late

494
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,150
on our first date.

495
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,030
I'm here.

496
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,840
I'm in the first-floor atrium.

497
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,540
I'm here too.

498
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:05,160
I'll wait for you at the elevators.

499
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,470
I'm here.

500
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:11,510
I saw you.

501
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:12,770
Come out. Stop hiding.

502
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:14,960
I'm not hiding.

503
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:17,350
I'm right in front of the elevators.

504
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,790
Sure, keep pretending.

505
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:29,020
Come out!

506
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,430
Where are you?

507
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:31,190
You liked to

508
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,070
hide in the corner

509
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,330
to scare me in the past.

510
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,230
I'm not hiding.

511
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,350
Where are you?

512
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:38,280
Paging for a child named Li Haozhe.

513
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:40,260
Paging for a child named Li Haozhe.

514
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,790
Are you at the World Trade Mall?

515
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:42,870
I am at the World Trade Mall.

516
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,590
Me too.

517
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:46,790
The World Trade Mall on Yanwu West Road.

518
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,590
Wait for me. I'll be right there.

519
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:54,910
Sorry.

520
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:55,870
Sorry. Sorry.

521
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:56,990
Sorry, Xixi.

522
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:57,870
I thought it was

523
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,800
the World Trade Mall on Xiahe Road.

524
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,670
Mr. Xiao, you forgot?

525
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:02,750
We had a deal.

526
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,950
Once the new World Trade Mall opens,

527
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,350
we would visit it together.

528
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,550
You remember this very well.

529
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:09,910
So, what's first on the list

530
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:10,710
today?

531
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,910
What do you want to do?

532
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:17,910
Are you waiting for my arrangement?

533
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:18,990
I...

534
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:20,430
I made the arrangements for that mall.

535
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,510
It's my first time here.

536
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,170
I don't know what to do either.

537
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:26,070
Come with me.

538
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:26,870

seen this movie before.

Eat up.

565
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:23,240
Mom, that alpaca is so cute.

566
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:24,870
An alpaca!

567
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,590
Alpaca.

568
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,790
I've never seen an alpaca in person before.

569
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:31,030
Alpaca.

573
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,700
Alpaca.

00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,730
Let me take a photo for you.

575
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:42,390
It licked me.

576
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:43,070
Did you see it?

577
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:43,990
Yes.

578
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,150

-Alpaca. Alpaca.
-Come on.

580
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,030
Alpaca.

581
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,030
Are you hungry?

582
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:55,590
So cute.

583
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:56,350
Did you take a photo?

584
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,110
Yes.

585
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:57,710
Your turn.

586
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:58,590
I'm fine.

587
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,310
Touch it.

588
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,670
It hasn't taken a shower for a long time.

589
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:01,390

590

No such thing.

591

592
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:03,030
on me.

619
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:38,030
where we first met.

620
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,600
Of course, I remember that.

621

when we talked for the first time?

Excuse me.

625

I'm selling

626
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,590
a brand of tea tree black mask.

627
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,510
Not only can it absorb grease,

628
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:56,910
but it can also dissolve blackheads.

629
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:58,110
You'll see the effect after 5 pieces,

630
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:00,400
and 20 pieces will get rid of your blackheads forever.

631
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,710
Not bad.

632
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:03,170

637
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:12,270
I remember having only

638
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,850
one thought in my mind.

639
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:16,670
That was, I must get

640

644
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,070

for three months.

769
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:16,470
Because of Peter's dad?

770
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,680
Do you want to try it?

771
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:25,350
Tong Xin, let me ask you a question.

772
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:26,150
Go ahead.

773
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:31,270
How does it feel

774
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:32,470
if the person you love

775
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,230
doesn't love you?

776
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:38,990
I think

777
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:41,590
you're not in love yet.

778
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:42,950
You're still lacking a little.

779
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:44,790
You're at the stage of affection

780
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:46,070
or admiration.

781
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:48,070
What do you think?

782
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:51,510
How did you feel then?

783
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:04,390
At that time,

784
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:07,050
it wasn't simply that I loved him, but he did not.

785
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:09,710
It was more like

786
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:12,350
we both loved each other.

787
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:14,230
But he suddenly

788
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:15,960
left me

789
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:17,440
without warning.

790
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:20,800
I was the only one left.

791
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:23,750
I started doubting

792
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:25,430
if everything in the past

793
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:27,270
really existed.

794
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:42,040
I didn't sober up for three months.

795
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:45,470
Only when I saw Peter

796
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:46,830
did I realize that

797
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:50,350
I must live well

798
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:52,110
for him.

799
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:56,230
Do you still drink now?

800
00:42:57,790 --> 00:42:59,340
The feeling of drinking now

801
00:42:59,340 --> 00:42:59,790
is totally different

802
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:01,070
from that time.

803
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:03,030
I used to drink to drown my sorrows.

804
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:03,910
Now,

805
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:05,470
it's more about celebrating happy things.

806
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:06,730
I drink in moderation.

807
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:09,240
Alright.

808
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:11,240
Congratulations on moving on.

809
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:13,190
Thank you.

810
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:17,390
Young man.

811
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:19,150
Don't be sad.

812
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:21,150
Time

813
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:22,790
is a magical thing.

814
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:24,910
Most of our pain

815
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:27,470
will slowly fade away

816
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:28,750
as time goes by.

817
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:35,580
I understand what you said.

818
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:37,870
But...

819
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:39,390
But our situation

820
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:40,270
is different.

821
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:42,960
Grandaunt told me two days ago.

822
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:45,590
She thinks

823
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:47,190
I've never

824
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:48,650
fallen in love with Lin Xi.

825
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:50,990
Look, we said the same thing.

826
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:54,470
As expected, you both

827
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:56,530
knew the situation better than I did.

828
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:00,110
Do you know

829
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:00,750
what my first reaction was

830
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:01,510
when I saw

831
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:03,230
them together just now?

832
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:05,630
What?

833
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:07,590
I actually thought

834
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:10,390
they were a perfect match.

835
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,590
Isn't it weird and ridiculous?

836
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:17,390
The person I hate the most

837
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:19,190
and the person I like the most

838
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:19,790
are together now.

839
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:20,870
But I'm neither angry

840
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:21,670
nor sad.

841
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:22,830
I don't understand

842
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:24,360
what I'm thinking anymore.

843
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:29,070
How should I put it?

844
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:32,960
Lin Xi is a girl

845
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,310
I admire very much.

846
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:36,900
I've never met someone like her

847
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:38,870
in the past.

848
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:41,030
To be honest,

849
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:42,670
if Xiao Yicheng

850
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:44,270
hadn't appeared then,

851
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:46,070
I would have become

852
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:47,430
great friends with her.

853
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:52,030
Here's to you.

854
00:44:52,310 --> 00:44:54,550
You have finally found your heart.

855
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:58,150
We all found it.

856
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:08,430
Alright.

857
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:10,030
The next song is for our

858
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:11,030
beautiful youth.

859
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,110
♫Open the door to face the hot summer waves♫

860
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,580
♫Leaping over this city♫

861
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:32,830
♫Let my heart beat brighter than the sun♫

862
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:38,050
♫Show off my best pieces from the wardrobe♫

863
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:41,270
♫Make a scene, there's no need to explain♫

864
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:44,810
♫Don't imagine a beautiful future♫

865
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:49,310
♫Somehow, at one point♫

866
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:52,690
♫I can't move my gaze away♫

867
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:55,720
♫The second our gaze met♫

868
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:58,570
♫You came to me with a smile♫

869
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,370
♫Are you just like me♫
