10
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:52,990
Mr. Xiao!

11
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:53,750

play games together a lot.

22

I’m glad you've achieved so much.

24
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,350
Thank you.

25

00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,460
I wonder if Mr. Xiao

30
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:28,990
could spare some time for us

31
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,430

So, about the birthday plan

42
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,710
what do you think?

43
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:00,350
Not bad.

44
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,950

00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,030
at Guanzhou Road,

46
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,830
I think it's good.

48

Sure.

51
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:18,870
Actually Lujiang Hotel is not bad too.

52

See, it's a century old,

Can you

59
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,750
be less perfunctory?

60
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,579
Particularly because it's Professor Gao's birthday,

61
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:37,630
that's why I'm being perfunctory.

62
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,070

what was their attitude towards you?

68
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,510
They think you're not compatible with my mom

69
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,630
and they don't acknowledge you.

70
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,670

79

how many years did Bingguo take

116

to defeat Nuowei?

117
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:38,830
Five years.

118
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,870
To be exact, three years.

119
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:46,990
Nuowei before 2007

120
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,990
was so immersed

121
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,030
in the flourishing Kangsen system.

122
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,750
Their flagship model, C30, was selling well,

123
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:53,750
and they were actively

124
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,030
planning for the future

125
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:55,790

126
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,950
Just like the current TLA,

127

they were immersed

128

in the false "fast is good" logic.

129
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,110
But when machines

130
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,110
don't work well,

131
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:09,270
being fast

132
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,030
is instead an irony.

133
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:18,590

136
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,270
I can then repackage its sped up version

137

and launch it as 2.0.

138
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,390

139
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,380
between each version,

140
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,190
but they can, again and again,

141

generate quick sales.

142
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,390
It does make money,

Taking the blame and being falsely accused

No.

308
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,670
I came here immediately

309
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,630
as soon as I received your complaint

310
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,750

311
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,830

00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,990

319

Mr. Xiao

324
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,830
won't end in a short time.

325
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:34,630
It's okay.

326
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:35,240
With a computer,

327
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,190
I can work anywhere.

328
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,830
The self-study of artificial intelligence

329
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:45,590
is in fact

330
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,790
a reaction function

331
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:47,750
that includes many random effects.

332
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:53,310
γ= Γ(χ).

333
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,670
χ is the input,

334
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,470
γ is the output,

335
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:03,190
and Γ is the mechanism.

336
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:04,950
But these three

337
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,150
are all unpredictable.

338
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:06,980
So we must

339
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,150
collect X and Y

340
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,550
from a sea of data

341
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,350
to substitute χ and γ as much as we can.

342
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,390
Then from the data,

343
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,230
bit by bit,

344
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:14,710
estimate a fit for F.

345
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:19,190
So it's γ=F(χ)

346
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:21,470
and we try to let the error of X

347
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,430
in predicting Y the smallest.

348
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:26,870
But F is entirely

349
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,070
driven by data.

350
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,390
Artificial intelligence can form

351
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,790
a brief simulated consciousness,

352
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,430
but it can't form a continuous

353
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,070
human-like consciousness.

354
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,390
Ma.

355
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:53,350
What's wrong, Mr. Xiao?

356
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:58,990
Do me a favor.

357
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,190
Director Lin.

358
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,910
I'm sorry.

359
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,590
The receptionist forgot to get you some water.

360
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,150
Thank you.

361
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,830
Are you usually this busy?

362
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,390
Don't mention it.

363
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,510
After the 1.0 version

364
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,430
was launched,

365
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,750
we thought we could take a break.

366
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:15,710
Not sure what

367
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:16,710
stimulated Mr. Xiao,

368
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:18,190
but he insists that the 2.0 version

369
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:19,510
must have human-like consciousness.

370
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,150
Machine is not human.

371
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,390
How can it posses consciousness of a person?

372
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,510
You think so too, right?

373
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:26,230
How about you do us a favour?

374
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:27,710
Come with me.

375
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,150
This way.

376
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:47,710
Why did you take so long

377
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:48,750
to use the toilet?

378
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:49,790
Mr. Xiao,

379
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,470
didn't you ask me to send...

380
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,950
Dare to argue even after slacking off?

381
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,950
Director Lin is the external aid I invited.

382
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,430
Well, Mr. Xiao.

383
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,230
You said you hope machines

384
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,950
can to have human-like consciousness.

385
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:07,230
But we think

386
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,109
it's impossible.

387
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,069
Why?

388
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:11,470
Director Lin,

389
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,990
can I ask you a question?

390
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,710
About a translation's

391
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,150
trustworthiness, coherence, and rightness,

392
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,470
as a professional interpreter,

393
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,990
what kind of work are you required to do

394
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:22,630
in order to achieve

395
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:23,750
the state of "rightness".

396
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,550
A subtle feeling

397
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:29,030
and personal habits.

398
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:32,950
Feelings.

399
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:35,670
Such things

400
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:38,190
are hard to quantify, Mr. Xiao.

401
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,790
Could you elaborate?

402
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,350
Let me give you an example.

403
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,310
If

404
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,750
you want to promote your produce

405
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,190
to a stranger,

406
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,550
how do you know

407
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,720
whether the person is worth promoting to?

408
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,230
Or

409
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,670
what is the possibilities

410
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:57,470
of him buying in your recommendation?

411
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,990
It depends on the feeling I guess.

412
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:00,710
That's right.

413
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,870
To simply put,

414
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,790
most people use feelings

415
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,070
as their first judging criteria.

416
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:08,910
The second one is habit.

417
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,710
Some people like to talk eloquently.

418
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:11,790
They like to slowly bring up

419
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,230
evidence to support their words.

420
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:15,230
Some people like to pester

421
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:17,310
until others compromise.

422
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:19,200
Translation also goes by the same logic.

423
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:21,990
I see.

424
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,310
Feelings are vague,

425
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,920
but when we work with artificial intelligence,

426
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,910
we need to support it

427
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,540
using tangible data.

428
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,790
In other words,

429
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:30,960
different people

430
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,870
have different understanding of translation.

431
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,070
I think everyone's familiar with

432
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,230
the classics "Gone with the Wind".

433
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,670
Its original name is

434
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:37,700
"Gone with the wind".

435
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,540
But at the same time,

436
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,710
it has two Chinese translations

437
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,510
that many are familiar with,

438
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,350
"Float" and "Beauty in the Chaos".

439
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:44,430
I once had

440
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,240
a very cool friend

441
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,860
who translated it into "Traceless".

442
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,110
But I also think

443
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:50,150
"Dying with the Wind" is not bad.

444
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,350
So, look,

445
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,910
people with different personalities

446
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:53,670
will have different

447
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,590
understandings and translations.

448
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,070
I see.

449
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,240
A translate personality.

450
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,350
Yes, translate personality.

451
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,750
It can imitate the owner's talking speed,

452
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:15,790
tone and emotions,

453
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:16,630
and generates a unique aura

454
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:17,710
of the user.

455
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,480
If the owner is

456
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,910
cold and decisive,

457
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,150
the translation

458
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:23,990
should be precise and simple.

459
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,160
If the owner is

460
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,630
an emotional hipster,

461
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:27,910
the translation

462
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,390
has to have traces of heartbreak literature.

463
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,630
What's going on?

464
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:46,160
You asked someone to deal with Mr. Xiao,

465
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,790
but instead helped Mr. Xiao to solve the problem.

466
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,390
Translate personality?

467
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,480
I seem to understand but not really.

468
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:06,990
I see.

469
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:10,110
Thank you for your guidance, Director Lin.

470
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,520
You're welcome, Mr. Xiao.

471
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:14,960
Well,

472
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:17,950
I'm sorry.

473
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,550
Hello, Wei.

474
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:22,510
What's wrong?

475
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,430
100th Day Meeting. Come back quickly.

476
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:26,950
I still have something to do over here.

477
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,630
Chairman Ding from the headquarters is leading it himself.

478
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:30,190
Aren't you afraid that Lu will cause troubles?

479
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,360
Okay, I'll be right back.

480
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,070
Sorry, Mr. Xiao.

481
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,470
Since you are not free today,

482
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,030
I'll visit you another day.

483
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,470
Looks like Director Lin's sincerity

484
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,550
is only to this extent.

485
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:54,030
I wanted to

486
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,540
to set aside today's dinner time

487
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,630
for Director Lin.

488
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,230
I don't think you need it anymore.

489
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,430
For how Ling Feng's absence

490
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,110
affected Yuyi,

491
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,430
even if I complain to the relevant association,

492
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,550
it doesn't seem to be unreasonable.

493
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,430
Mr. Xiao, that's unnecessary.

494
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,910
Whether to minimize the problem

495
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,750
or intensify the conflict,

496
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:21,190
it depends on your choice.

497
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,710
Since Mr. Xiao is willing

498
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:28,550
to have a chat with us,

499
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,430
Huasheng will definitely

500
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,110
give you

501
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,390
a satisfying answer.

502
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,630
Are you sure you're free during dinner?

503
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,990
I need to meet a client in a bit.

504
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,720
We'll talk after that.

505
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,270
I'll have to trouble you to wait for me.

506
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,590
No problem.

507
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,870
The driver has to head back to the company.

508
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:52,110
No worries.

509
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,430
I'll just find a place to stay.

510
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:00,720

your school?

512
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,480
I'm going back to the Computer Department

513
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,190
to ask Professor Huang some questions.

514
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:12,630
Go ahead.

515
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:14,750
Wait for me at the same place.

Chairman Ding, please.

518
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:57,510
Chairman Ding.

Don't worry about me.

Sit down.

523
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:06,860
Okay.

524
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:10,860
Lin Xi is not here.

525
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,680
Lin Xi is very busy.

526
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,970
She usually doesn't attend

527
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:16,390
meetings like this.

528
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:21,030
Something came up with the client.

529
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,370
Lin Xi went to talk to him.

00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,430
If Lin Xi knows

by Lin Xi personally

536
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,670
must be very important.

00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:05,670
It's just nearby.

Mr. Xiao,

588
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,230
Ling Feng's sudden misperformance

589
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:49,950
is indeed our fault.

590
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:51,590
I apologize.

591
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,110
In the future,

592
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,020

593
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:55,990

594
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:58,310
So I hope Mr. Xiao

595

596

00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:34,910
I can't see hope in you.

765
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,190
Xixi.

766
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,150
It’s been three years.

767
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:53,830
Three years of relationship

768
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:55,400
can't be compared to academic qualifications, right?

769
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:56,990
That's right.

770
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:06,670
♫ Turns out love remembers ♫

771
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:10,260
♫ Searches for you and me again ♫

772
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:13,430
♫ The breeze blows against the sunset ♫

773
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,160
♫ You stared at me ♫

774
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,760
♫ Till the shadow melts into the galaxy ♫

775
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:21,150
♫ I'll hold your hand again ♫

776
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:25,050
♫ While looking into each other's eyes ♫

777
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,810
♫ Happiness is to have ♫

778
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:36,470
♫ More futures with you ♫

779
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:51,870
I don't understand.

780
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:55,990
Why

781
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:58,030
didn't you tell him

782
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:58,790
you've already received

783
00:37:58,790 --> 00:37:59,750
Huasheng's offer letter.

784
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:04,150
If so, he wouldn't leave.

785
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:06,220
Wouldn't leave.

786
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,230
What's wrong with that?

787
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,830
That's his future.

788
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:14,070
and his prospect.

789
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:18,830
Then why didn't you

790
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:19,910
go with him?

791
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:24,990
Just because of what your grandpa said?

792
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,550
Professor Gao's words

793
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:33,430
reminded me of my mother.

794
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,190
Back then,

795
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:38,670
she also chose love

796
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:39,870
between career and love.

797
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:46,190
There were many times

798
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,350
I saw her sitting there alone

799
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,870
in the middle of the night

800
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:53,310
going through her translation notes.

801
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:57,350
To someone

802
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:58,910
who has a dream,

803
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:00,790
it must've been

804
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:02,270
a very painful decision.

805
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,430
So I hope that

806
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:09,590
the future of both of us

807
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:11,150
will not have a single regret.

808
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:16,390
But you shouldn't

809
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:17,590
tell him like that.

810
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:19,670
It hurts people.

811
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:22,020
Well,

812
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:23,510
when we are young,

813
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:27,030
we should solve problems

814
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:29,230
in the fastest, cruelest and decisive way.

815
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,310
What about now?

816
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:35,070
I thought there were unresolvable hate

817
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,710
between you two.

818
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:38,310
In this case,

819
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:40,990
why can't you tell him the truth?

820
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:44,550
Will there be any difference?

821
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,630
He's already married.

822
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:52,990
You still love him?

823
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:01,510
Does it matter?

824
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:04,090
Lin Xi.

825
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:05,790
I think you can

826
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:07,110
tell Xiao Yicheng.

827
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:08,310
In this way,

828
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,030
he won't

829
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,190
give you a hard time

830
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:11,000
about withdrawing the complaint.

831
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:14,150
Wei Tian.

832
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:16,220
If you're my friend, promise me.

833
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:18,230
Only you and I know

834
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:20,510
the reason why I broke up with him.

835
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:23,390
Why?

836
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:26,030
Promise me.

837
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:27,750
Otherwise, we won't be friends anymore.

838
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:33,150
Finish this and go home.

839
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,110
You go first.

840
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,950
I need to get something from my office.

841
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,030
Let's go.

842
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:49,270
Let's go.

843
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:19,910
Xiao,

844
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:21,520
You still have my number after so many years.

845
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,030
Yes.

846
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,670
I mean,

847
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:26,390
about your complaint,

848
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:27,910
I wonder if it can be withdrawn.

849
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,070
Lin Xi didn't go to you

850
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,430
for herself.

851
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:31,590
It's mainly because

852
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:32,710
of the kid from our company.

853
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:34,870
Can you consider...

854
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:35,590
Wei.

855
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,630
I still have a meeting. I'll end it here.

856
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:41,790
Okay.

857
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:42,870
Next time

858
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:44,150
we can have dinner together with the classmates.

859
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:46,310
Okay.

860
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:57,310
Shasha.

861
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:58,350
Brother Tian.

862
00:41:58,550 --> 00:41:59,630
You're still here?

863
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:01,630
I translated the documents you asked for.

864
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:02,430
So fast?

865
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:04,230
Look.

866
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:13,790
[Execution Summary]

867
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:19,310
Here.

868
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:22,270
And here.

869
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:26,070
And here.

870
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:28,710
They all have issues.

871
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:36,950
This "aerosol",

872
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:37,840
I've checked.

873
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,980
There are two ways of translating it.

874
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:40,310
One is "spray solution",

875
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:41,710
and the other is "vaporiser".

876
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:42,710
But according to

877
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:44,030
my understanding of the text before and after it,

878
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:45,950
"spray solution" is more suitable.

879
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:47,110
Shasha,

880
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:48,510
This document

881
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:50,220
is the agreement by Montreal.

882
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:52,030
Multilateral Fund Executive Committee.

883
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:52,990
This committee

884
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:54,350
can be compared to

885
00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:55,390
the State Environmental Protection Administration in China.

886
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:56,830
Therefore,

887
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,030
the translation of this word

888
00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:59,480
should strictly follow

889
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,750
the wording of the State Environmental Protection Administration

890
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:02,000
which is "spray solution".

891
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:03,830
It's also used this way

892
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:05,190
in the UN multilingual database.

893
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:06,960
Let me change it.

894
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:07,760
No need.

895
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:08,990
Let Chen Wen change it tomorrow.

896
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:10,800
It's okay. I'll be quick.

897
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:13,700
Let me take a look.

898
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:19,150
There are

899
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:21,630
many similar mistakes in the full passage.

900
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:24,950
I need the document urgently.

901
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:26,190
Just let Chen Wen change it.

902
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,540
No.

903
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:39,430
You should go back early.

904
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:40,550
Be careful.
