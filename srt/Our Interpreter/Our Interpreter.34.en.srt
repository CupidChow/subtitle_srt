00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,430
You've always been doing so,

18

and you've been doing well.

19
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,150
I believe you will

20

79
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:54,830
Oh no.

80
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:56,990
I was in a hurry today

81
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,070

went for a class reunion at the countryside resort today,

85
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,470
so she's not coming back.

86
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,360
How about...

00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,950

What do you want to do to me?

89
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,110
You're the one without the key, okay?

90
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,070
Have you been

91
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:24,830
plotting against me for a long time,

92
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,790
by purposely forgetting your keys?

93
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:27,790
Right, that's right.

94
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,120
I have been up to no good.

95
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,310
Let's go.

96
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,710
Third Princess.

97
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,760
You haven't seen me in days, right?

98
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,550
Well...

99
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,750
let me get her some water.

100
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,030
There's still water.

101
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,070

102
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,330
There's also kibbles.

103
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,050
How about this?

104
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,350
Pass her to me.

105
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,360
You should go wash up first.

106
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,990
My dear.

107
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,190
I'll go wash up first.

108
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:04,720
Go ahead.

109
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,350
What are you smelling?

110
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,470
Uh,

111
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,270
there's a new towel inside.

112
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,070
Okay.

114
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,270
What are you doing?

115
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:42,909
I'm packing up.

116
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,670
I'm done with the shower.

117
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:46,630
Okay.

118
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,710
It's late.

119
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,730
You still have work to do at this hour?

120
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,310
There's a document I need to confirm.

121
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,070
How about you? Are you sleepy?

122
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,030
Go to sleep if you're sleepy.

123
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:41,070
I... I'm not that sleepy.

124
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,380
I also have emails to reply.

125
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:20,910
I'm getting a bottle of water.

126
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,170
Do you want some water?

127
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,320
Third Princess.

128
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:50,270
It's late. Stop eating.

129
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,350
It's time to sleep.

130
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,470
How will you get up tomorrow

131
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,400
if you are going to sleep this late?

132
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:05,910
Okay.

133
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,510
I'm done.

134
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,350
You are done?

135
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,510
Rest early.

136
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,590
Yes, I will.

137
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:17,270
You too.

138
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,870
Where are you going to sleep?

139
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,920
Are you going to sleep here?

140
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:25,830
T-That's fine.

141
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:26,590
Okay.

142
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,870
Well, I won't stand on ceremony.

143
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,400
I'll sleep in your bedroom.

144
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,430
Good night.

145
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,550
Good night.

146
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,470
By the way,

147
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,030
it's the weekend tomorrow.

148
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,270
I can actually get up later.

149
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,350
What do you mean?

150
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,590
If we can get up later,

151
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,150
we can then

152
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,600
sleep a little later.

153
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,110
You...

154
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,230
Oh, yeah.

155
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,550
Good morning.

156
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,270
You're up.

157
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:34,890
Did you sleep well?

158
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,580
I seem to love you more today

159
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,600
than yesterday.

160
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,530
What should I do?

161
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,790
So cheesy.

162
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,250
What about you?

163
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,390
I don't.

164
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:54,830
You don't?

165
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:57,750
That's fine.

166
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:00,830
It's the weekend.

167
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,030
What do you want to do?

168
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:08,510
It's a rare weekend.

169
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,510
I want to stay in bed all day.

170
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,600
All day?

171
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:17,990
Sure.

172
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,360
♫Embraced by love, hearing your breath♫

173
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,320
♫Everything in this world♫

174
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,990

♫Love means that no matter where we go, we can feel each other's heartbeats♫

178
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,020
People who are in love

179
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,190
are indeed different.

180
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,230
Well, it depends on who you are seeing.

181
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,160
Come on, tell me.

182
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,520
What's the difference?

183
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,750
Let me analyze it for you.

184
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,600
Generally speaking,

185
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,750
capable people

186
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,190
are not necessarily gentle.

187
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,990
But those who are gentle, may not be elegant.

188
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,790
And being elegant doesn't mean that one is always considerate.

189
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,110
Being considerate doesn't necessarily mean you're pretty.

190
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:37,550
Those who are pretty may not actually have good temperament.

191
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,200
But my girl

192
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,510
is good at everything.

193
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,110
Enough.

194
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,790
I won't ask ever again.

195
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:45,390
By the way, Yao,

196
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:45,990
tonight,

197
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:46,790
I'm going to treat a pro

198
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:47,550
from Hangzhou.

199
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,470
Come with me.

200
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,720
Help me hold up the fort.

201
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,450
No, I already have a date today.

202
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,200
Come on, is it your girlfriend?

203
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,550
Hold onto my board for me.

204
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:07,150
So much for putting his lover over his buddies.

205
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:09,750
Tong Xin.

206
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,870
If you still want to talk about the job-hopping,

207
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,470
I can only say I'm sorry.

208
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,120
Do you know Ms. Pan Jinyu?

209
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,150
Yes.

210
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,620
He is the only person in the world

211
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,190
who knows

212
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,510
the Pazeh language.

213
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:24,670
Unfortunately,

214
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,430
he passed away

215
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,390
in 2010.

216
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:27,430
In this world,

217
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,590
no one else knows this language anymore.

218
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,070
I was too young back then.

219
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,590
Otherwise, I would have asked her to be my master.

220
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,390
Would you have been able to do so?

221
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,250
Let me show you something.

222
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,350
This is a map of all the endangered languages in the world.

223
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,150
Currently,

224
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,590
there are 150

225
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,270
endangered languages

226
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,950
with less than ten speakers,

227
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,310
and 80 endangered languages

228
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:52,910
with less than five speakers.

229
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,310
Of which, 28 languages

230
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:56,190
are considered critically endangered languages,

231
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,720
with just one speaker left.

232
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,790
And their knowledge are limited to only simple words

233
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:00,650
and sentences.

234
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,390
Many languages are disappearing.

235
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,230
Cheng Yao.

236
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,510
You can't save all of them alone.

237
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,650
What are you trying to say?

238
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,190
Let's work hard together.

239
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,750
Machine translation

240
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,870
may not replace human translation.

241
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:24,150
But machines are the best vehicles

242
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,310
for preserving language.

243
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,510
Besides,

244
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,470
Yuyi is also equipped with

245
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:29,270
experimental systems that are advanced domestically and internationally,

246
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,310
to help you with

247
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:32,510
the construction of multimodal speech recognition models and more.

248
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,120
If you want,

249
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,110
you can also be assigned

250
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:35,990
your own team,

251
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:36,870
to help you achieve

252
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:37,790
what you want.

253
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:44,590
But if you want me

254
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:46,450
leave Huasheng at this juncture,

255
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,510
I won't be able to face Lin Xi.

256
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,510
I understand.

257
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:57,030
Let me put it this way.

258
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:58,870
Previously, due to the lack of demand

259
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,550
for minority languages,

260
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,270
the board has been cutting

261
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,630
the budget for development.

262
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,230
If we can't resolve

263
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,190
the issues with minority language translation

264
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,430
before the Consumer Products Expo,

265
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,630
the Board will definitely

266
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:09,869
change the direction of development,

267
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:12,030
and completely give up on the field of minor language.

268
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,950
That's why Xiao is so anxious.

269
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,950
He wants to take advantage of the Expo

270
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,470
and prove to the Board

271
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,470
the importance of minor languages.

272
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,109
Cheng Yao,

273
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,790
We desperately need your help.

274
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:37,330
This collaboration is a win-win situation.

275
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:38,990
No one is more suitable

276
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,110
than you.

Yaoyao.

279
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,750
Come and try the new beans.

280
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,510
What's wrong?

281
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,710
Nothing.

282
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:23,910
Try it.

283
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:25,950
Thank you.

284

[Employment Contract]

285
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:30,030
You want to change your jobs?

286
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:31,910
No.

287
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:34,930
I am just taking a look.

288
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,350
Which company is this?

289
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:39,710
It's Yuyi.

290
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:42,450
Artificial intelligence translation?

291
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:44,390
That sounds good.

292
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,410
I can see you're a little tempted.

293
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,310
It's mainly because Yuyi promised

294
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,990
to form a team for me,

295
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,150
as well as a laboratory

296
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:54,070
to construct multimodal speech recognition models.

297
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:54,830
This way, I can fulfil

298
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,950
my wish to protect minority languages.

299
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:58,350
Isn't that great?

300
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,830
You think so too?

301
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,590
Why are you hesitating?

302
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,090
The thing is, Grandma,

303
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:13,390
Yuyi and Huasheng

304
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:15,830
are both currently bidding at the Consumer Products Expo.

305
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,630
Lin Xi needs people.

306
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:18,990
It's only right that

307
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,430
I shouldn't be leaving her at this point in time.

308
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,870
Moreover, I am moving to a company where

309
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:22,870
its artificial intelligence translation

310
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,470
has always been criticized.

311
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:27,380
You're worried that you're betraying Lin Xi,

312
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,870
while also going against your original aspirations?

313
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:30,470
Yes.

314
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,070
Yaoyao.

315
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,750
Do you remember

316
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:37,110
what I told you

317
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,790
when I came back.

318
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,190
I remember.

319
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:41,720
You told me that

320
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,590
when you came back

321
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,950
from England back in those years,

322
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,510
you carried a total of four huge suitcases.

323
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,910
Daily necessities

324
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,150
only filled half a box.

325
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:48,710
The rest of it

326
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,190
were all dictionaries,

327
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,630
and reference books.

328
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,590
Didn't you also joked that

329
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,990
translation back then

330
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:56,190
didn't felt like brainwork,

331
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,250
but instead felt like physical work?

332
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,590
These circumstances

333
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:03,910
were only relieved

334
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,310
when the use of computers started.

335
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:08,070
Also, it could store a huge vocabulary.

336
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,790
Now when we need to check a word,

337
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:13,270
we just have to search on the computer.

338
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,670
You guys may not

339
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:16,110
feel anything now.

340
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,750
But we were so excited back then.

341
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,310
Now, you say that

342
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:24,160
you're working on artificial intelligence translation.

343
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,000
However,

344
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,590
the systems, software,

345
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,830
and service platforms that you are using now,

346
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:29,710
are all products of

347
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,830
the advancement of technology.

348
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,790
Are you still willing to go back to

349
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:36,320
those days where we had to move dictionaries?

350
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,390
But Grandaunt, you have to admit that

351
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:41,470
advances in technology

352
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:42,830
have indeed written off

353
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:43,590
a good amount of the functionality

354
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:44,850
of human translation.

355
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,470
And I feel that

356
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,030
changing jobs this time

357
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,890
amounts to a form of betrayal.

358
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,430
Yaoyao.

359
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:52,990
I think

360
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,070
you just need to ask yourself

361
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,390
whether or not

362
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,450
this is something that you want to do.

363
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,990
Is it beneficial to the translation industry,

364
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:03,240
and the society as a whole?

365
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,440
If so, that's enough.

366
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:08,510
But I can't give an explanation

367
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,790
to Lin Xi.

368
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,710
A good man is always at peace with themselves.

369
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,430
Just say what you should.

370
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:16,110
I think Lin Xi

371
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:18,870
is a magnanimous person who will understand.

372
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,750
I see.

373
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:25,910
Thank you, Grandaunt.

00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:28,110
Don't mention it.

375
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:31,310

what it means for you

384
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,950
to go over to Yuyi now?

385
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,470
I know.

386
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:21,030
So why must it be now?

387
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,790
The talent for minority languages

388
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:24,630
is very scarce,

389
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:26,390
yet minor languages are very important.

390
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:27,870
Also, this matter is key

391
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,030
to Huasheng's tender

392
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,830
for the Consumer Products Expo.

393
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,190
You know

394
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,320
how important it is.

395
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:53,110
May I know

396
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:55,710
what are the conditions of offer Yuyi gave you?

397
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,430
Lin Xi, do you remember

398
00:22:58,430 --> 00:22:59,360
what is my dream?

399
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,110
Of course.

400
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:02,910
You want to promote minority languages.

401
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:04,070
Without me,

402
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:05,350
Huasheng might just

403
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,210
lose a project.

404
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:07,950
But for me, I want to promote

405
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:09,610
and save minority langugaes.

406
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,740
I can't do so

407
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,200
simply with those videos.

408
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,470
So, can Yuyi help you?

409
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:19,710
They showed me

410
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:21,190
their linguistic platform.

411
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:22,550
Through artificial intelligence technology,

412
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,510
this is the first time

413
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:24,440
I truly felt that

414
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,110
my dream

415
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,570
could actually come true.

416
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:40,630
I understand how you feel.

417
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,630
But can you wait a little longer?

418
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,990
At least wait until the Expo is over.

419
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:57,950
I'm sorry.

420
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:16,630
Lin Xi.

421
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:17,830
Lin Xi.

422
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:19,090
Come over for a bit.

423
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:21,630
Got it.

424
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,390
What is going on with

425
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:30,850
Cheng Yao's resignation?

426
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:33,870
Sorry.

427
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,200
I couldn't keep him.

428
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,910
You recruited him.

429
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,070
Why can't you keep him?

430
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:41,990
Is there something

431
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:43,790
I am not aware of

432
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,850
regarding Cheng Yao's resignation?

433
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:49,270
What do you mean?

434
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,000
Forget it.

435
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:53,260
Let's pretend I didn't ask.

436
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,230
You can leave now.

437
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,270
No, Mr. Zhang.

438
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:58,710
All these years,

439
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,820
you have always been a great manager,

440
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,270
and have been taking care of me like a brother.

441
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,510
I hope there's mutual trust

442
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:04,630
between both of us.

443
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,070
Just cut to the chase.

444
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:12,030
As far as I know,

445
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,110
Xiao Yicheng had previously

446
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:16,150
intended to poach Cheng Yao.

447
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,110
The conditions were good,

448
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,670
but he didn't leave.

449
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:25,430
What does it mean when he

450
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:29,160
chooses to leave at this critical moment?

451
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,950
Was there something that happened

452
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:33,480
between you, Xiao Yicheng,

453
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:35,630
and Cheng Yao,

454
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:36,870
that I am not aware of?

455
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,340
So you mean...

456
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:44,590
You think that

457
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,950
I helped Xiao Yicheng

458
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,230
poach Cheng Yao,

459
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:49,390
in order for Yuyi to win the bid?

460
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:51,120
You think I betrayed Huasheng?

461
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,770
I know you're not that kind of person.

462
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:55,910
But I am also facing

463
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:57,030
pressure from the company.

464
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,870
The higher-ups are watching.

465
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,670
Everyone knows about this,

466
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:02,790
and your relationship

467
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:03,950
with Xiao Yicheng.

468
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,110
You tell me.

469
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:11,190
What do you think would be their first reaction

470
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,240
when they hear about Cheng Yao’s resignation?

471
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:19,390
Will they suspect you?

472
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:21,150
You should know

473
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,480
what kind of person I am.

474
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:29,230
I trust you.

475
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,030
If I didn't believe you,

476
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:33,200
will I be telling you this much?

477
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:34,870
I'll explain

478
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,440
to the headquarters.

479
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:38,960
Thank you.

480
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,270
But Lin Xi,

481
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,480
I have to remind you.

482
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,960
Be clear about your current identity.

483
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:50,750
You're in charge of the project for Consumer Products Expo.

484
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:51,950
At this critical moment,

485
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,510
our relationship with Yuyi

486
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,510
is very delicate.

487
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:57,070
Just how many eyes are watching you?

488
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,750
When the time comes for you and Xiao Yicheng

489
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,030
to avoid arousing suspicion,

490
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,630
you should definitely do so.

491
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:03,830
Got it.

492
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:10,950
Regarding me poaching Cheng Yao,

493
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,680
please apologize to her for me.

494
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:13,550
Don't quarrel

495
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:14,630
because of this.

496
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,390
I haven't met her yet.

497
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:29,910
Let's go.

498
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:30,990
Lin Xi.

499
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:35,680
I'm leaving.

500
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,430
Anyway,

501
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:40,350
congratulations to you.

502
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,920
How about you scold me?

503
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,500
That way, I can feel better.

504
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,310
Although I'm angry,

505
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:51,750
I understand that

506
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,790
you don't belong to anyone.

507
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,520
You should have your own stage.

508
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,830
I won't scold you.

509
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:00,310
Scolding you will only make you feel better.

510
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,310
I won't do that.

511
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,470
How about you scold me?

512
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:08,830
You are starting to speak

513
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,360
for your employee already?

514
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:14,550
Enough.

515
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,190
If you really feel

516
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,510
feel sorry for me,

517
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:19,630
you should realize your dream.

518
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,190
Fine.

519
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,510
I'm leaving.

520
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:30,990
Go.

521
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:33,110
I...

522
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:36,670
Alright.

523
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:37,630
I know.

524
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,190
Dad's already called

525
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,030
a couple of times to rush us.

526
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:40,560
Let's go.

527
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:43,630
In-laws,

528
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,030
I brought you some

529
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:46,230
local specialties.

530
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,070
It's just a small gift.

531
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,190
So much?

532
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,070
You're too generous.

533
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,630
We didn't prepare anything.

534
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:51,070
Not at all.

535
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,530
We didn't spend any money.

536
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,230
These vegetables and fruits

537
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:55,720
are all homegrown.

538
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,750
Yes.

539
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,630
Look at these kiwis.

540
00:28:58,630 --> 00:28:59,270
I picked them myself

541
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,800
at the orchid this morning.

542
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:01,870
These are

543
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:03,030
perfect for eating now.

544
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,390
-Yes, yes.
-It helps replenish Vitamin C.

545
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:05,110
And this,

546
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:05,780
these are blueberries.

547
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,110
These are good.

548
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:09,230
They contain anthocyanin, an antioxidant.

549
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:10,270
If you eat too much, you will just be free of wrinkles instead.

550
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:10,710
Yes.

551
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,350
It's all from the wild.

552
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,310
-Yes.
-Yes.

553
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:15,510
In-laws,

554
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:16,830
I think

555
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,870
the wedding of these two kids

556
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,790
should be held at my place.

557
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:21,830
-Sounds good.
-Look.

558
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:22,870
I've got food,

559
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:24,060
shelter, and fun.

560
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:24,870
It's comprehensive.

561
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:25,660
-Yes.
-Right?

562
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,310
Yes.

563
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,270
Since it's our own home,

564
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,630
we won't face any restrictions.

565
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:30,950
Timing and manpower-wise, we can arrange it any way we wish.

566
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:31,550
Yes.

567
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:33,010
-Yes.
-That’s a good idea.

568
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:34,070
Very good.

569
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:36,350
Let's throw a banquet

570
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,710
for three days in a row.

571
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,550
Uncle, Auntie.

572
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:40,590
Dad, Mom.

573
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:41,670
We're here.

574
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:42,270
You're all here.

575
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,030
We were just talking about

576
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,750
where to hold your wedding.

577
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,030
Where would it be?

578
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:47,150
Let's do it at my place.

579
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,270
What do you think?

580
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,230
Sure.

581
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,390
Uncle's place is big.

582
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:51,350
It'll be lively.

583
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,790
Even Yicheng agrees.

584
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,230
I'll take care of everything

585
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,430
for you both.

586
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:58,440
But the transport there is inconvenient.

587
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,820
Silly girl.

588
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:00,390
By then,

589
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:01,680
your Dad will hire a few buses

590
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,270
dedicated to picking up and dropping off people.

591
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,870
Isn't that enough?

592
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:07,110
But Dad,

593
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,550
it takes one day

594
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,230
to go back and forth.

595
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:11,690
If we include the banquet,

596
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:12,990
it's not nice

597
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:14,790
to take up two or three days

598
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:15,790
of people's time.

599
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:17,910
And it's getting cold recently.

600
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,850
It's inappropriate to hold it in the mountains.

601
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:24,430
You're right.

602
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:26,390
How about we find a hotel

603
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:27,350
in Xiahai?

604
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,070
That might just be

605
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,150
more convenient for everyone.

606
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:29,670
Yes.

607
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,150
In-laws,

608
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,310
you just came back.

609
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:34,170
There's a lot that you don't know.

610
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,390
Now,

611
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:37,110
the wedding banquets

612
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,150
of the higher-end hotels in Xiahai

613
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:39,990
have been fully booked

614
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:41,070
to next summer.

615
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:43,550
That long?

616
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,040
Well, let's make it next summer then.

617
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:49,510
Uncle.

618
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:51,240
Regarding the banquet,

619
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:53,070
my friend owns a hotel.

620
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,710
I'll have him arrange it.

621
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:57,410
What kind of hotel does your friend owns?

622
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:58,950
It has a private dining room,

623
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,790
hosting about 20 tables.

624
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:02,270
20 tables?

625
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,790
Would that be too little?

626
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,790
What do you think?

627
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:07,990
20 tables is perfect.

628
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,390
Dayong

629
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:11,590
has many business friends,

630
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,790
but let's not have them spend any money.

631
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,110
We can just invite

632
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,060
some family and friends.

633
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:16,710
Okay.

634
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:17,710
Okay.

635
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,750
I'll make a call.

636
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:19,640
I still think

637
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,190
it's better to hold it next summer.

638
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:23,350
Two months is not enough time.

639
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:25,080
We haven’t prepared anything.

640
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:26,710
Xixi.

641
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:27,950
The wedding dress and ring

642
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,030
are all ready.

643
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,740
We can definitely make it.

644
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,870
Yeah, Xixi.

645
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:32,830
If you have any issues

646
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:33,830
and require help,

647
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:34,710
we can help you.

648
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:36,440
Yes, we can help.

649
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:37,590
That's right.

650
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:38,830
Uncle, Auntie.

651
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:39,790
Dad, Mom.

652
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:40,820
I am aware.

653
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,110
If there are any problems,

654
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,790
all of you will help me solve it.

655
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:44,870
But...

656
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,950
this is a major milestone

657
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,790
for Xiao Yicheng and myself.

658
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:51,230
I think it's better to take it easy,

659
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:52,200
and have more time

660
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,190
to prepare.

661
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,270
Tell me, Xixi.

662
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,600
What exactly happened?

663
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:09,390
Mom.

664
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:11,710
Let me ask you.

665
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:13,790
When you were having to choose

666
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:15,470
between love and career,

667
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,320
how did you make up your mind?

668
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,350
How could you be so decisive?

669
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:21,470
Did you really just make up your mind

670
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:23,400
to completely give up your career?

671
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:25,830
Xixi.

672
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,240
What kind of answer do you want to hear?

673
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:31,630
Everyone's life

674
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:32,830
is different.

675
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:34,670
My answer

676
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:37,120
might not be able to answer your question.

677
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:41,990
You chose your career eight years ago.

678
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:44,270
Eight years later,

679
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:45,590
you and Yicheng

680
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:47,070
overcome all kinds of difficulties

681
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,390
to get together again.

682
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,830
At this point,

683
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,830
are you leaning more towards your relationship,

684
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:55,820
or your career?

685
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,270
Xixi,

686
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:06,470
You have to face

687
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:08,350
and seek the answers to

688
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,470
your problems on your own.

689
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:11,070
No one else can help you.

690
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,630
But there's one thing.

691
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:16,250
No matter what decision you make,

692
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:19,030
home will always be

693
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,750
your safest harbour.

694
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:22,470
Your Dad and I

695
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:24,270
will always be with by your side.

696
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,390
You should

697
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:30,590
find Yicheng when you have the time,

698
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,830
and have a good talk.

699
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:36,230
Okay.

700
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:55,510
I'll go up first.

701
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:01,710
The wedding...

702
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,650
Do you really want to postpone it?

703
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:15,510
I just think it's too hasty.

704
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:22,830
I know...

705
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,630
you're still mad at me.

706
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:29,350
I'm sorry.

707
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:31,070
I didn't tell you

708
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,670
about Cheng Yao beforehand.

709
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,790
You can take it out on me.

710
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:38,670
Don't keep it to yourself, okay?

711
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:43,989
I admit

712
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:46,360
I need some time

713
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,560
to digest the matter.

714
00:34:50,949 --> 00:34:52,510
But postponing the wedding

715
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,270
has nothing to do with this.

716
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,830
Then why?

717
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:06,890
I feel that before we talk about the wedding,

718
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,390
we should

719
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:09,590
think about

720
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,310
whether our goals

721
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:12,430
are aligned.

722
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,350
Do we

723
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:15,230
really know each other?

724
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,890
It's been more than ten years.

725
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:18,750
That's more than enough time to understand.

726
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,350
What are you thinking about?

727
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,990
I thought so too.

728
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:24,950
I thought I knew you well.

729
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:30,310
But when I saw Cheng Yao

730
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:31,970
submit his resignation to me,

731
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:34,590
I suddenly realized

732
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:35,870
I don't seem to

733
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:36,930
know you that well.

734
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,350
Xixi.

735
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:43,430
If you can

736
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:44,590
think about it

737
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:46,460
from my perspective,

738
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:50,370
I believe you would be able to understand me.

739
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:55,110
Let me ask you a question.

740
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:56,350
Go ahead.

741
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,600
Was it your idea to poach Cheng Yao,

742
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,230
or was it Tong Xin's?

743
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:07,790
No matter whose idea it is,

744
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:10,650
we were the ones who poached him over.

745
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,510
I'm sorry.

746
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:17,670
I'm sorry.

747
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:26,790
Do you know

748
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:28,350
what it means to me

749
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:31,090
to poach Cheng Yao away at this juncture?

750
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:32,350
I know.

751
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,350
Of course I know.

752
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:35,910
I have no choice.

753
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,230
If Cheng Yao doesn't help us,

754
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,110
do you know

755
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:39,950
what would it mean for me,

756
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:40,870
and what it would mean

757
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:41,750
for Yuyi?

758
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:45,790
The Consume Product Expo is Yuyi's

759
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:47,360
first showcase after getting listed.

760
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,790
I have no choice.

761
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,210
I can only succeed.

762
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:09,130
I have no other choice too.

763
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,670
In that case,

764
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,630
let's not see each other

765
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,790

it doesn't matter

771
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:33,430
when we hold the wedding.

772
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:34,710
I don't even mind

773
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,870
if we don't hold a wedding.

774
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:36,670
It's okay.

775
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,390
As long as we stay together,

776
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:39,590
okay?

777
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:44,190

Wang Yue, come in.

782
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:56,070
Ms. Tong, what can I do for you?

783
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:57,310
Buy five cups of coffee for me.

784
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:57,910
Okay.

785
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:58,430
After that,

786
00:38:58,430 --> 00:38:59,230
you can knock off.

787
00:38:59,230 --> 00:38:59,920

Without Yao,

00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:23,030
we won't be able to get this coffee.
