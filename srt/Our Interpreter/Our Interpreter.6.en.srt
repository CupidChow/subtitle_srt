1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:54,759
Hello?

3
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:58,920
What?

4
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:00,760
Lin Xi is drunk.

5
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,230
She drank three glasses of whisky?

6
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:05,400
Wait there.

7
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,510
I'll go pick her up now.

8
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,080
Is she always like this?

9
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,750
Drink till she's drunk.

10
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,800
Lin Xi knows her limits when it comes to drinking.

11
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,240
I guess the client is hard to deal with.

12
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,800
Otherwise, she wouldn't have drunk whisky.

13
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,430
Why are there so many people looking for a ride?

14
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,310
I'll give you a ride.

15
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,470
Slow down. There are surveillance cameras ahead.

16
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,829
Don't speed.

17
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,150
Mr. Sun.

18
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,870
She's a child.

19
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,240
She lived abroad growing up.

20
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,310
She's immature. Please don't mind her.

21
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,280
Of course not.

22
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,750
Be careful. Watch your steps.

23
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,870
That's good.

24
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,030
Mr. Xiao.

25
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,710
Why are you here?

26
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,280
To send you home.

27
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,560
This is...

28
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,240
Just right. Come here.

29
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,520
Let me introduce the both of you.

30
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,520
Sun Youwei, Mr. Sun from Jingge Fund.

31
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,910
Jingge Fund

32
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,079
is one of the

33
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,710
best private placement investment companies

34
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,150
both domestically and abroad.

35
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,590
He's Xiao Yicheng.

36
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,079
You have heard of Yuyi, right.

37
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,240
He's the head of Yuyi.

38
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,400
Hello.

39
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,590
Hello.

40
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,600
Their company

41
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,840
is in the process of IPO.

42
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,630
Aren't you looking for good projects

43
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,680
to invest in?

44
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,560
It's an era of artificial intelligence.

45
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,400
Invest in him.

46
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,800
It's the best artificial intelligence company.

47
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,630
I trust Xixi's taste.

48
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,360
Mr. Xiao,

49
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,310
send me the information when you can.

50
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,190
Sure.

51
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,000
Sun.

52
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,680
Is the car here?

53
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,160
Look at you.

54
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,269
You made Xixi drink so much.

55
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,310
Xiao Yicheng.

56
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,750
This is my sister.

57
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,200
This is my brother-in-law.

58
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,120
Call her sister.

59
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,360
Your boyfriend?

60
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:31,950
Yes.

61
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,120
No.

62
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,430
We broke up long ago.

63
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,310
Ex-boyfriend.

64
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:37,920
Used to be.

65
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,720
Okay.

66
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,750
If it’s Xixi’s friend,

67
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,750
we should prioritize

68
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,040
their project.

69
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,310
Yes.

70
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,870
You are right.

71
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:59,390
Wei Tian, Mr. Wei is...

72
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,630
That's me.

73
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,830
This is the hangover medication you ordered.

74
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,920
I didn't order this.

75
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,360
Thank you.

76
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,830
I got it.

77
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:10,950
Well...

78
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,600
It's normal

79
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,600
for young people to quibble.

80
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,120
Don't break up all the time.

81
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,870
If you do it too much,

82
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,190
it'd start to hurt.

83
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:19,600
That's right.

84
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,630
Go back and have a good talk.

85
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,870
Xixi is a good girl.

86
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:23,510
Listen.

87
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,040
If you bully her,

88
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,830
we won't agree to it.

89
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:26,830
I understand.

90
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:28,630
Shall we go?

91
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,390
We're leaving.

92
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,950
Take care.

93
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,310
-Okay. Bye. -Bye bye.

94
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:32,750
Take care.

95
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,800
Be careful.

96
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:37,120
Let's go, Lin Xi.

97
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:37,480
I'll send you home.

98
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,390
I'll take her home.

99
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,159
No, Mr. Xiao...

100
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:39,750
Let's go.

101
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,630
How can we let you do that?

102
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,070
Let him do it.

103
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,510
Let's go.

104
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:51,950
Aren't you leaving?

105
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,680
You shouldn't do this.

106
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,159
What? It's easy to get a taxi here.

107
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,000
Lin Xi is drunk.

108
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,270
How could you ask Mr. Xiao

109
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,430
send her home?

110
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,560
That's her ex-boyfriend.

111
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,120
Wasn't that a joke

112
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,830
to deal with clients?

113
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,510
No.

114
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,000
What?

115
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,190
They really dated?

116
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,630
Are you

117
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,270
really siblings?

118
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,040
We...

119
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,240
We are cousins.

120
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,040
Cousins.

121
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,040
Stop the car.

122
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,190
What would you like to buy?

123
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,390
Sugar hawthorn.

124
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,600
Two layers of sugar coat.

125
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,480
Thank you.

126
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,160
Pay.

127
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,240
How much is it, Ma'am?

128
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:28,950
Five yuan.

129
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:29,830
Okay.

130
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,560
The first one is for you.

131
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,270
The first one is the best.

132
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:33,150
Be careful.

133
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,630
Shasha!

134
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,670
What's wrong?

135
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,870
My shoes can't touch water.

136
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,840
The leather bottom will be ruined if it's soaked in water.

137
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,320
Leather...

138
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,200
Leather bottom shoes?

139
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:01,600
Why would you buy

140
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,840
leather bottom shoes?

141
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,270
They make shoes more breathable.

142
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:06,630
Breath...

143
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,800
Thank you.

144
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:42,840
The car is here.

145
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,750
Let's go.

146
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,000
You are going to walk barefoot?

147
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,080
Now you have two choices.

148
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,840
First, put on your shoes

149
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,000
and go over there quickly.

150
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,270
The second one is for me to carry you.

151
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,750
You carry me?

152
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,200
Are your shoes okay?

153
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:05,630
Put them on.

154
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,080
Thank you.

155
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,030
What's wrong?

156
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,080
Aren't your shoes not wet?

157
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,200
Tian.

158
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,000
Do you think I am not a good fit

159
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,440
for this job?

160
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:35,960
I made some basic mistakes

161
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,750
in that translation I did previously.

162
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,150
I can't even

163
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,480
handle some of the small things in life

164
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,720
properly.

165
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,440
Don't think that way.

166
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:47,960
Actually,

167
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,590
there are still many good things about you.

168
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,240
Well...

169
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,080
For example,

170
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,870
you're very polite.

171
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,150
You're awake.

172
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:59,360
Here.

173
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,200
Thank you.

174
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,670
Why am I here?

175
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,480
You don't remember?

176
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,000
I only remember

177
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,840
they sent me to the lounge.

178
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:29,910
And...

179
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,080
Are you always like this?

180
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,390
Getting drunk in an unfamiliar environment,

181
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,710
exposing yourself to danger.

182
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,080
Mr. Sun and his wife

183
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,670
are my close friends.

184
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,480
They will take care of me.

185
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,200
If you need,

186
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,960
I can introduce Mr. Sun to you.

187
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:00,910
No need.

188
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,870
You need it now.

189
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,270
I said there's no need.

190
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,840
This introduction

191
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,910
comes with a condition.

192
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,000
If it succeeds,

193
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,510
give me the order

194
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,790
of Yuyi's IPO.

195
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:21,790
What do you think?

196
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,750
The best investment company,

197
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,320
the best AI company.

198
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,750
and the best transalation team.

199
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,870
Shouldn't we work

200
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:34,790
together?

201
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:36,840
You mean

202
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,230
you think

203
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,080
Yuyi is the best

204
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,310
artificial intelligence company?

205
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:45,910
You're someone

206
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,600
in the traditional translation industry.

207
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,200
You don't have the right to speak on this.

208
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,790
But I have the right to speak on you.

209
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,870
Do you know how many shortcomings you have?

210
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,360
You're lazy, depressed,

211
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,870
fragile, sensitive,

212
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,480
and pretentious.

213
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,870
But there's one thing

214
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,870
I have always deeply believed in.

215
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,550
That is your talent.

216
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,270
As long as you want to do something,

217
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,390
no one can do it better

218
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,200
than you.

219
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,030
Thank you.

220
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,630
But this time,

221
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,150
I want to solve Yuyi's problem

222
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,240
by myself.

223
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,390
Okay.

224
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,960
If you need anything,

225
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,200
feel free to contact me.

226
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,440
Rest early, Mr. Xiao.

227
00:15:59,120 --> 00:15:59,670
Come on.

228
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,080
You're back.

229
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,480
Grandma, you're still up?

230
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,480
Not yet.

231
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:14,030
Hello.

232
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,150
Why are you here?

233
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,550
Yaoyao's grandma

234
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,000
is my sister.

235
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,630
Yaoyao is going to attend

236
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,630
the skateboard club training here.

237
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,440
He will be staying here for a month.

238
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,350
Xixi,

239
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,910
are you okay with it?

240
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,270
This is your house.

241
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,550
I dare not oppose.

242
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,750
I just found out that

243
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,750
Yaoyao is now a freelance interpreter

244
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,630
signed by your company.

245
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,550
What a coincidence.

246
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:48,960
Yaoyao.

247
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,750
You have to perform well.

248
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,320
Don’t make trouble for Xixi.

249
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:53,630
Got it.

250
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,670
I'm going

251
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,030
to go rest.

252
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,600
You young people

253
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,840
have a good chat.

254
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,360
Good night, Grandma.

255
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,600
Good night.

256
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,829
Why didn't you reply to my WeChat?

257
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,310
If there's anything, send it to the group chat,

258
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,920
there will be someone who'd communicate with you about it.

259
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,750
You're burning bridges now the deal's done, how realist of you.

260
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,000
This is the company's procedure.

261
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,109
That's your procedure,

262
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,000
not mine.

263
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:29,350
What do you want then?

264
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,160
You recruited me.

265
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,720
I only communicate with you.

266
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,270
Okay.

267
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,200
Okay.

268
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:41,550
Rest early.

269
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,680
Good night.

270
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,640
Jingge Fund?

271
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,070
I advise you to be careful.

272
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:04,440
Why?

273
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,350
Jingge Fund's Sun Youwei

274
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,310
is famous for being someone

275
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,640
who would not make a move when something's not mature yet.

276
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
If we ask him to invest,

277
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,480
I'm afraid he'll ask for more.

278
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,480
I'm not afraid that he wants more.

279
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,550
I'm just afraid he doesn't want it.

280
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,000
But we

281
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,680
we can't just give in.

282
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,830
The game between capitalists

283
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:26,830
is a seesaw battle.

284
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,270
It's too early

285
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,200
to say this now.

286
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,720
Who suggested Jingge?

287
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,270
A friend.

288
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,640
It's her.

289
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:43,720
Xiao.

290
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,560
She wants to help you?

291
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:48,720
No.

292
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,070
She has a condition.

293
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,070
She wants the order for when Yuyi IPOs.

294
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,440
You know very well

295
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,750
this is just her excuse.

296
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,000
Admit it.

297
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,230
You can't let her go.

298
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:02,880
That's not true.

299
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,400
Lin Xi.

300
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,310
In 2014,

301
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:14,200
she was specially recruited by Huasheng Translation Company

302
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,830
as a simultaneous interpreter.

303
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,590
After working for a year,

304
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,750
due to her outstanding performance,

305
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,960
she has been selected to be the main interpreter

306
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,750
for the World Consumer Convention,

307
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,790
the Agriculture Trade Convention,

308
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:22,920
and various other major competitions

309
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,880
and conventions.

310
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,790
After her third year,

311
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,830
the satisfaction rate of

312
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:26,720
her clients is nearly 100%.

313
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:27,550
She has been designated by many important clients

314
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:28,720
to be their interpreter.

315
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:29,440
In addition to that, she has

316
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,400
expanded the interpretation market for the company.

317
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,200
She provided over

318
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,880
3 million sales leads for the company that year.

319
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,550
During her fifth year,

320
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,310
she was promoted to assistant chief interpreter

321
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,160
before she was transferred to the priority client management department.

322
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,550
She is the youngest department director

323
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,960
in the history of Huasheng.

324
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,000
I didn't finish reading this while in the office

325
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,200
so I brought it back.

326
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,720
Xiao Yicheng, what are you feeling guilty for?

327
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,310
I'm not.

328
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,480
Are you not guilty

329
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,880
or have you still not forgotten her?

330
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,680
Neither.

331
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,200
This photo

332
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,440
is quite old.

333
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,200
Childish.

334
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,350
Skate, bro.

335
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,920
I'm busy.

336
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,720
Who is it?

337
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,270
That lady?

338
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,480
No way. You're really interested in her?

339
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,590
She's quite interesting.

340
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,790
What do you think about her then?

341
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,270
She's very strong.

342
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,000
I see.

343
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,550
You like fierce women.

344
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,720
Hear this,

345
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,510
she may look fierce,

346
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,110
but her bedroom

347
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,270
is filled with plushies.

348
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,350
There's quite a cute contrast.

349
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:02,920
You know,

350
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,000
how she looks

351
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,880
when she isn't fully awake in the morning.

352
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,240
You'd think...

353
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,310
you can kidnap her anytime.

354
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,030
Huh?

355
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,550
Isn't that how everyone in the world

356
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,640
look like when they aren't fully awake yet?

357
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:13,830
But when she starts working,

358
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,190
she's so energized

359
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,200
and overwhelming.

360
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:16,510
This...

361
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,920
Which man would like

362
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,160
a woman whose overwhelming?

363
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,680
You're not open minded enough.

364
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,440
Fine.

365
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,920
I'm not open minded enough.

366
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,110
I have only one question.

367
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,240
Are we still practicing today?

368
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,830
No, I have work to do.

369
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,400
Also, she's the one

370
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,510
who's communicating with me now.

371
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:34,720
Bye bye.

372
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,590
You're hopeless!

373
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:52,790
I'm Xiao Yicheng,

374
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,920
Lin Xi's friend.

375
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,160
I wonder if you still remember me.

376
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,160
I do.

377
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,640
Are you free this afternoon?

378
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,960
I would like to visit you personally.

379
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:04,350
Sure.

380
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:23,880
Mr. Sun.

381
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:24,680
You...

382
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,030
You and Lin Xi are friends?

383
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,510
What kind of friends are you?

384
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:36,830
Mr. Sun,

385
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,920
what do you mean?

386
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,200
Depending on

387
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,750
if you're her normal friend

388
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,240
good friend,

389
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,030
or boyfriend,

390
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,920
I will

391
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,590
extend different types of help accordingly.

392
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:52,750
Mr. Xiao,

393
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,240
which type are you?

394
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:57,960
Mr. Sun.

395
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,270
I don't need either

396
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,640
of these three types of help.

397
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,400
If it's not personal,

398
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,350
why would Jingge invest in Yuyi?

399
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,270
To Jingge,

400
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,480
machine translation

401
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,920
is a completely unfamiliar path.

402
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,350
It's very risky.

403
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,960
Mr. Sun, it's business.

404
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,680
We will make the investors profit.

405
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:26,550
As for the specifics

406
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:27,920
they are written in the project brief.

407
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:32,440
I can invest.

408
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,830
But I want the right to veto.

409
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,830
Sorry, Mr. Sun.

410
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,440
We are all smart people.

411
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,640
Let's cut to the chase.

412
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,590
Daniel from Yunteng withdrew his investment.

413
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:51,680
TLA

414
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,640
reached out to you

415
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,000
a few days ago.

416
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,110
But you didn't accept it.

417
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,510
This means

418
00:23:58,510 --> 00:23:59,830
they had overbearing conditions.

419
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,680
If you had other choices,

420
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:02,960
you wouldn't be

421
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,480
sitting here today.

422
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,920
There is only one chance.

423
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,920
You have three days to think about it.

424
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,160
I have a meeting to attend.

425
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,840
How about

426
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,830
we discuss this with TLA a little more?

427
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,110
It's not necessary.

428
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,640
So we accept Sun Youwei's conditions?

429
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,510
Xiao,

430
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:00,200
we don't have money on our account.

431
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,590
Just mortgage my house.

432
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,720
They will give the cash next week.

433
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:09,960
Are you crazy?

434
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,550
It can hold out for a while at least.

435
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,880
What if no one

436
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,720
accepts our

437
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,000
investment conditions?

438
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,270
How many houses can you mortgage?

439
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:21,590
There must be a way.

440
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,110
Wake up.

441
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,240
The capital market

442
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,350
always give umbrellas on a sunny day

443
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,440
and takes it back when it rains.

444
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,720
There's that video of Cheng Yao to start with,

445
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,240
and now Daniel withdrew his investment.

446
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,160
From the outside,

447
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:30,720
although

448
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,030
there is no connection between these two,

449
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:32,830
our product

450
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:33,590
look problematic.

451
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,070
Yuyi's translator is the best.

452
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,590
But the investors don't know that.

453
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,400
If you insist on your own opinion,

454
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,790
I will gather the board of directors

455
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,270
to decide on this.

456
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:27,920
What’s wrong?

457
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,160
Buddy.

458
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,110
Let me show you something.

459
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:36,960
Hello, Sir.

460
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,720
If you walk along this road,

461
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,510
and you will see the hotel.

462
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:46,750
Tong Xin, take a look at this.

463
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,720
I don't want to see it.

464
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,880
Take a look first.

465
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:52,390
I was so surprised.

466
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:54,830
A kid I met while traveling in the mountain areas

467
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,720
speaks better English than I do.

468
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,550
Isn't this...

469
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,070
Yes.

470
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,030
Do you remember

471
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,480
when our product was in the initial testing phase,

472
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,560
we donated

473
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,830
100 test machines to them?

474
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:08,790
Hello, Sir.

475
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,440
Go down along this road,

476
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,270
and you will see the hotel.

477
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,270
I do.

478
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,830
With the help of the translator,

479
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,560
the English level of the local students

480
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,590
has greatly improved.

481
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:18,110
And

482
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,110
it also solved the

483
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,030
most difficult problem in English,

484
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:20,830
accent.

485
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,830
The views of this video

486
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,790
has exceeded 3 million.

487
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,480
I'll contact the media now

488
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:29,200
to increase the popularity and secure the exposure.

489
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,150
Let's try to spread the word of

490
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,160
the core competency of Yuyi.

491
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:32,920
I also contacted

492
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,790
that boy.

493
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,200
I want to do an indepth cooperation

494
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,270
with him.

495
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,880
I've also contacted the local government.

496
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:40,350
I hope that if possible,

497
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,960
we can set up a project to help them.

498
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,110
In this way, it can expand

499
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,200
the effect of our translator.

500
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:46,200
Of course, at the same time,

501
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,350
it can increase

502
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,440
our brand value

503
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,310
and social awareness.

504
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:51,000
That's great, Xiao.

505
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:54,550
The first day will be a busy one.

506
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,400
Just by looking at him, if he doesn't speak

507
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,310
I wouldn't have thought

508
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:59,030
his English is so fluent.

509
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:00,350
I know this boy.

510
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:00,960
He's the one in that

511
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:01,960
popular video where he guided people

512
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,160
in English.

513
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,720
I heard he learned his English

514
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,550
from this translator

515
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,480
by himself.

516
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,830
He learned this himself?

517
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,750
He learned it himself.

518
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,400
I think

519
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:12,750
we should buy one for our son too.

520
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,440
What do you think?

521
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,790
Son, do you want it?

522
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:15,720
I'll buy you one.

523
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,350
Yeah!

524
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,310
I want one too.

525
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,960
Go out and turn right,

526
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,200
then turn left,

527
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,480
and you will arrive.

528
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:21,960
Okay?

529
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:22,510
Okay.

530
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:24,270
Thank you.

531
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:24,960
Bye bye.

532
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,720
This translator is very popular now.

533
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,350
They are all preorders.

534
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,070
I bought it right on the dot

535
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,030
but they haven't been shipped out yet.

536
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,880
That means it's quite useful.

537
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:47,440
What are you looking at?

538
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:52,750
Language

539
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:55,200
is the window to the bigger world.

540
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,270
This is so passionate.

541
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,440
I have to get one.

542
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:02,640
What's the use of you

543
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,680
getting one of these?

544
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,510
It's just a piece of scrap metal.

545
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,830
At most you will use it to cover your instant noodles when you're making it.

546
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,440
What do you mean?

547
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,880
What do you mean scrap metal.

548
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,160
Not everyone has

549
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,510
your language skills.

550
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,640
I think this is quite useful for

551
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,590
when we go overseas for competition.

552
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,270
You don't know others' pains.

553
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,790
I'm going to order one.

554
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:27,960
We would like to thank Yuyi Tianxia

555
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,070
for the translator they donated.

556
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:30,030
This

557
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,400
event about kinship, support

558
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:34,550
and love around campus

559
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,680
has ended successfully.

560
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:36,960
Next,

561
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,200
let's have Mr. Xiao

562
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,400
to present the souvenirs

563
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,590
to our students.

564
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:44,830
Yuyi is indeed brilliant this time.

565
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,750
They donated another 500 translators.

566
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:47,480
They also

567
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,070
cooperated with the Education Foundation,

568
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,640
saying they want to help the kids in mountain areas

569
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,510
to learn languages

570
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,590
and help them fulfil their dreams about languages.

571
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,200
They're also donating 3% of their profit

572
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,510
to the Education Foundation.

573
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,640
This boy's path to

574
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,440
fulfilling his language dream is so full of passion.

575
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,640
Analysis posts online

576
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,510
are all saying that

577
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,350
Yuyi's technology

578
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,680
is indeed the best.

579
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,550
And it's also a corporation with social awareness.

580
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:09,920
This guy is indeed amazing.

581
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:10,880
People online

582
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,830
are all calling Yuyi's translator

583
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:13,000
Dream-building Machine.

584
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:13,920
And they have sent out signals

585
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,590
to supporting good local products.

586
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,070
Yuyi's reputation

587
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,030
has completely changed.

588
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,070
Sun, have some dumplings.

589
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:24,510
Okay.

590
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,550
Come and try it.

591
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:27,640
Xixi came to make

592
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,680
these dumpling stuffings

593
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,720
early in the morning.

594
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,030
Really? That's so nice of you.

595
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,000
Let me tell you.

596
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,830
This is the pork from my dad's ecology farm.

597
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:36,880
They eat the best animal feed.

598
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,550
Listen,

599
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:38,790
you won't be able to get this meat outside.

600
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,160
Let me try it.

601
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,200
How is it?

602
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,160
Not bad.

603
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,110
Right?

604
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,750
You didn't come here

605
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,830
just to make dumplings, right?

606
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,720
What else is there? Go ahead.

607
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,160
There's nothing.

608
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,640
I'm here

609
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,920
to send local specialties

610
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,270
to my brother and sister.

611
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:14,920
You're not going to say it right?

612
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:15,880
I have a meeting

613
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,830
after I finish this.

614
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,270
Sun,

615
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,790
you're being annoying.

616
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:22,400
You can't just

617
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,880
say it out like this.

618
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,680
Brother, let me show you a video.

619
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,400
Okay.

620
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:37,880
Look.

621
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,160
Hello, Sir.

622
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,790
Go down along this road,

623
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:44,270
and you well see the hotel.

624
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,270
His accent is so good.

625
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:46,720
That's so good.

626
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,510
Amazing.

627
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,550
This video of Yuyi

628
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,790
has amassed over 10 million views

629
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:56,400
on the Internet.

630
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,030
For videos like this that are not staged

631
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,640
to reach this level of heights in popularity

632
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,750
proves

633
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,270
how good the word of mouth of this product is.

634
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,590
Xiao Yicheng is really pretty capable.

635
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,680
Xixi,

636
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,720
I know why you are here.

637
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,270
Businessmen pursue profit.

638
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,590
Yuyi

639
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,160
is not Jingge's style.

640
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,790
Even if I'm willing to invest

641
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:15,720
for your sake,

642
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,310
the board of directors

643
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,480
may not approve it.

644
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,750
You don't have to do this for my sake.

645
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,240
You know investment,

646
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,880
but you may not know technology.

647
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,960
Yuyi's translation algorithm

648
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,590
is definitely beyond your imagination.

649
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,880
And I believe

650
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,110
this algorithm

651
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:31,200
is good for the expansion

652
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,240
into new fields

653
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,440
for your company.

654
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:36,670
Although it's business,

655
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:37,920
but for the sake

656
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,030
of our friendship,

657
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,270
I’m willing to see Mr. Xiao again.

658
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:45,110
Xixi, tell me.

659
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,350
What is your relationship

660
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:47,640
with Xiao Yicheng?

661
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:48,400
How do you know

662
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,400
so many things about him?

663
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,830
Didn't I tell you? He's my ex-boyfriend?

664
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,590
Ex-boyfriend?

665
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,200
It'd make sense for you to help

666
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,440
your current boyfriend this much.

667
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,960
We're still friends after breaking up.

668
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,750
I really don't understand

669
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,160
young people nowadays.

670
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,960
Bad things can trend.

671
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,240
Good things can too.

672
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,550
Awesome.

673
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,550
Ms. Tong.

674
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,070
Hello, everyone.

675
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:17,640
Mr. Xiao.

676
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,200
You're all here.

677
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,110
The last 5,000 machines

678
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,680
we have in our inventory

679
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,920
has been sold out.

680
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:22,680
This morning,

681
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,920
we received dozens of orders from

682
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,720
the subway company,

683
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,000
travel company

684
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,310
and college for the elderlies.

685
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,590
We're short-handed.

686
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,880
There are more than 30,000 new orders.

687
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,000
Even if we work nonstop,

688
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,790
we won't be able to make it in time.

689
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:32,590
Let me take a look.

690
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:33,590
The order from the subway company

691
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,640
is fully paid

692
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,200
so we need to prioritize its production.

693
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,640
The preorder payments of other clients

694
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,240
have already been paid.

695
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,480
Have a seat first.

696
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:49,960
How long is

697
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:52,200
the delivery date?

698
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:54,480
The delivery date of our final order

699
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,000
is end of October.

700
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,790
At the end of October.

701
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,480
How about this?

702
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,350
Production Department,

703
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:05,920
open up another assembly line.

704
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,160
Okay.

705
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:08,670
Sales Department,

706
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,760
open up the preorders on

707
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,590
all three online platforms.

708
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,630
That should be enough.

709
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:19,550
Oh right,

710
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,000
Finance Department,

711
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,150
for this season,

712
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,630
give every employee

713
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,280
a 20% bonus.

714
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:33,880
Any other questions?

715
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:36,280
Mr. Xiao,

716
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,800
Mr. Sun is waiting for you in the office.

717
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,190
He's here at this time?

718
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,440
I'll leave this to you.

719
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,110
I'll go take a look.

720
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:43,550
Okay.

721
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,230
Sorry.

722
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,710
Mr. Sun. Sorry to keep you waiting.

723
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,760
Mr. Xiao.

724
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,590
How have you been?

725
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,960
It's Yuyi's honor

726
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,230
to have you here.

727
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,110
This is why I came today.

728
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:15,150
Mr. Xiao, how much do you think is suitable?

729
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,030
Suit yourself.

730
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,000
Please have a seat.

731
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:25,440
But if I remember correctly,

732
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,110
what Mr. Sun wants

733
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,630
is the right to veto

734
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:29,960
the board of directors, right?

735
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,920
Things are always changing.

736
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,960
Things change with the environment.

737
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,510
Yuyi

738
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,760
is very popular now.

739
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,640
But Mr. Xiao still

740
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,070
hasn't decided on a partner yet.

741
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:42,000
Right?

742
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,590
Chuangke Fund

743
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:45,550
is not good enough.

744
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,440
You don't like them.

745
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,800
Although Yueming Group

746
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,360
is a big shot in the financial world,

747
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:52,480
it has a big appetite.

748
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,110
You must've had a taste of that.

749
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,280
If Mr. Xiao is willing

750
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,670
cooperate with Jingge,

751
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:58,920
everything can be negotiated.

752
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,150
Mr. Sun, you are being very proud on the front

753
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,030
but actually very respectful

754
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:09,670
We'll fill in the amount ourselves

755
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,960
and we'll raise the conditions.

756
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,510
What Mr. Sun wants

757
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:13,710
can't be this simple, right?

758
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:17,030
It is really a joy

759
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,110
to speak with smart people.

760
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:20,590
At a personal level,

761
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:22,230
you are Xixi’s friend.

762
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,150
I trust her.

763
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:25,510
At a business level,

764
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,710
Yuyi's video is trending

765
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:28,760
and netizens are all recommending it.

766
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,550
Your foundation is very stable.

767
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:32,000
Investing in such projects,

768
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,030
I will definitely make profits.

769
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:34,920
More importantly,

770
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,280
do you know the main projects

771
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,880
Jingge Fund has been investing in these few years?

772
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,190
Medical and biology.

773
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:41,360
I'm investing in Yuyi

774
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:43,030
to take advantage of your strengths.

775
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,280
Besides,

776
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,150
what I am interested in

777
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,280
is not just Yuyi's

778
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,670
voice development system,

779
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,030
but also the unique algorithm behind it.

780
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,710
It seems that Mr. Sun

781
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,110
is not interested in translation.

782
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:57,280
That's right.

783
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:00,280
From the point of view of global development,

784
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,000
biology and medical industries

785
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,710
have a viable future.

786
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,670
I believe

787
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,400
Mr. Xiao won't stop

788
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:09,000
just at translation in the future.

789
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,030
Right?

790
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,440
Mr. Sun,

791
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,480
I want to know

792
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,280
if your visit today

793
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,590
has any other reason to it

794
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:25,000
aside from the change in

795
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:26,070
public opinion?

796
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,320
Is it...

797
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,710
Lin Xi?

798
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,110
I didn't mention her.

799
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,510
She wouldn't let me mention her.

800
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:41,760
Mr. Xiao, don’t get me wrong.

801
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,760
I invest in you not because of Xixi.

802
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:44,880
But

803
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:46,670
with this layer of relationship with Xixi,

804
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,800
I believe

805
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,760
we will have greater trust

806
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,670
in our cooperation.

807
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,280
Mr. Xiao, aren't you curious

808
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:58,030
about why I trust Lin Xi so much?

809
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:58,960
Why?

810
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,320
Back then,

811
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:02,480
Lin Xi just joined the big client department.

812
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,920
She was trying to get a cooperation with Jingge.

813
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,360
Unfortunately,

814
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:08,000
I was involved in

815
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,960
an economic case.

816
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,480
I was called in for investigation by related departments.

817
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,110
When the people in the industry

818
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:15,920
were all spreading rumors that it's over for me,

819
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:19,150
and there were internal feuds in Jingge,

820
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,030
it was Xixi who accompanied my wife

821
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,070
through that

822
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,400
hardest period of time.

823
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,440
Only she

824
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,480
trusted that I was innocent.

825
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:32,400
Mr. Xiao,

826
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,510
with this layer of relationship,

827
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,630
would you be less suspicious

828
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,440
of me and Jingge?

829
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:45,710
Mr. Sun.

830
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,150
I still need

831
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:48,230
the legal department

832
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,400
to take a look at the contract first.

833
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,510
Sure.

834
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,190
I look forward to our future cooperation.

835
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:55,150
Thank you.

836
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:59,440
Mr. Xiao, please stay.

837
00:38:59,440 --> 00:38:59,960
Okay.

838
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:00,630
Mr. Sun.

839
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:01,550
Take care.

840
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:01,920
Okay.

841
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:02,880
Bye.

842
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,710
Have you decided?

843
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:09,920
Several investors

844
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,360
are waiting for an answer.

845
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,190
Tong Xin.

846
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,510
Have the legal department

847
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:16,710
take a look through this.

848
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,440
Are you sure

849
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,840
there's no need to compare the other companies?

850
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,070
Additional production

851
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,670
requires the capital to be in

852
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:26,510
within a month.

853
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,670
Looking at it now,

854
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,440
only he has this ability.

855
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,150
Okay, I'll go do it.

856
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,400
Yes, just finish this.

857
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:52,590
I need to take this call.

858
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,670
Xiao?

859
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:58,840
Is she in the office?

860
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:00,510
Who?

861
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:02,800
You mean Lin Xi?

862
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,840
She's in a meeting.

863
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,710
What's up?

864
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,440
Never mind.

865
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:34,840
Ask Cheng Yao.

866
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,960
If he's okay,

867
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,710
let him translate these french documents

868
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:38,400
of

869
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,630
Haijiang University.

870
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,480
Remember to not rush him

871
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,320
after confirming the deadline with him.

872
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,670
He has his own pace.

873
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,360
Okay, Xi.

874
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:46,960
Looks like you're lucky

875
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,360
to have Cheng Yao under your command.

876
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:49,920
Of course.

877
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:01,320
Isn't that Mr. Xiao?

878
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,590
Why is he here?

879
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:05,110
Oh, I forgot.

880
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:06,150
He called me today

881
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:07,630
asking about your schedule.

882
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:12,400
Let's go. Let's take the subway.

883
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,080
Take the subway with me.

884
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,480
I don't need to take the subway today.

885
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,030
Tian.

886
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:15,510
You have to.

887
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:16,190
Don't drag me.

888
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,480
It's a good day to take the subway today. There aren't many people.

889
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,070
Hi.

890
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:33,510
Are you still hungover

891
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:34,880
from the day you got drunk?

892
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:37,510
I've been fine.

893
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:38,360
It's been days.

894
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:44,710
By the way,

895
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:46,630
I know there's a type of iced black tea

896
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:48,000
with color similar to wine.

897
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:49,030
Do you want to try it?

898
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,070
Also,

899
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:58,630
if you really want to drink,

900
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:00,960
you can pretend to wipe your mouth with wet towels

901
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,070
and spit it out.

902
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,590
You came all the way here

903
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,630
to teach me how to avoid drinking alcohol?

904
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:14,840
I...

905
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:22,030
Thank you, Mr. Xiao.

906
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:23,800
I have something tonight.

907
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,880
I'll take my leave.

908
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:25,760
Wait.

909
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:29,710
Thank you.

910
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,030
Thank you for Mr. Sun.

911
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:34,150
Thank you.

912
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:39,030
Well,

913
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:40,710
I didn't

914
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:41,840
specially say it.

915
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,800
I just brought it up

916
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,110
when we were chatting.

917
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:49,070
Is what you said true that day?

918
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:53,030
That Yuyi is the best

919
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:54,190
artificial intelligence company.

920
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:58,280
I was just comforting you.

921
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Don't take it seriously.

922
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:00,920
But I took it seriously.

923
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,150
Fine then.

924
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:09,670
It's okay. How about this?

925
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,070
You can

926
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:11,870
request anything from me.

927
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:12,760
I will agree to it.

928
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:16,510
Anything?

929
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:17,000
Yes.

930
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,840
I want this too.

931
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,710
Sir, one more, please.

932
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:28,230
Okay. Here.

933
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:32,440
Papa.

934
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,030
Let's go.

935
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:39,920
Wait for me.

936
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:44,920
Boss.

937
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,590
I'll take all of these.

938
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:47,320
Okay.
