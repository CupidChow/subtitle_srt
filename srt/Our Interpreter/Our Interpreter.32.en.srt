that he wanted you

to join the bidding team for the Consumer Products Expo.

14
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,950
I made it very clear too.

15
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,230
The translation department has a lot of work to do.

16
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,350

You misunderstood me.

26
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,790
You asked me

27
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,150
to assist Director Lu

00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,870

29
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,110
I agreed

30
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,390
because

31
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,110

But this is the client's request.

34
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:04,910
Have you considered

00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,350

45
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,210

46
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,710

you didn't like that Lego,

tell my mom?

that I'm so disappointed in you

111
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,350
and that you loaf around at home without a job

112
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:58,550
and no longer believe in love.

113
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,810
I prepared her for the fact

114
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,860
that you may grow old alone

115
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,480

118
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,000
How could you say that about me?

119
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,930
Then what do you want me to tell her?

120
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,940
You should tell her this.

121
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,750
You should tell her

122
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,280
that I have a very stable job

123
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,270
that pays well,

124
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,070
that I am working hard to be a great translator,

125
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:24,870
and that I can

126
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,550
make the right decisions myself.

127
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,670
That's the only way

128
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:28,550
to make my mom agree

129
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,510
to me bringing Tong Xin home

You're young and naive.

132
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,070
Do you think you can

133
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,310
make your mom accept Tong

134
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,310
by saying that?

135
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,230
But how can I benefit

136
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,830
from what you said?

137
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,830
Mr. Lu Xun said

138
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:45,070
Chinese people

139
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,230
prefer compromises over conflicts.

140
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,870
For example, if you think

141
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,909
this house is too dark

142
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:54,390
and want to add a window there,

143
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,390
people won't agree.

144
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:58,390
But if you insist

145
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,310
on removing the roof,

146
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:04,270
they'll make a compromise

147
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,270
and allow you to add a window.

148
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,030
I understand.

149
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:14,790
This is a gambit,

150
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:15,910
but you're on the offensive.

151
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:16,950
Yes.

152
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,390
It's a mind game

153
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,950
with your mom.

154
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:23,160
You need to lower her expectations.

155
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,710
With low expectations,

156
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:27,110
she can easily accept bad results.

157
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,150
After hearing me out,

158
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,830
she was very worried

159
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,350
and asked me to persuade you

160
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,350
to make active efforts

161
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,830
to find a girlfriend

162
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,350
and bring her home

163
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,270
as soon as possible.

164
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,549
Do you mean

165
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:41,309
I can bring Tong Xin home

166
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:42,669
right away?

167
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:43,990
Look at you.

168
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,430
It's not like she's at your door

169
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,550
waiting to be with you.

170
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,500
Grandaunt.

171
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,750
As long as I try hard enough,

172
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,840
I'll win her heart.

173
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,470
Can't you see

174
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,750
that she's playing dumb with you now?

175
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,120
What are you going to do?

176
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,350
I can wait for her.

177
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:03,430
I'm afraid that won't work.

178
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,190
Tong Xin

179
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:08,590
will definitely have other pursuers.

180
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,910
A good girl like her won't be on the market for long.

181
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,600
What if she falls in love with someone else

182
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,750
before you win her heart?

183
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,550
That won't happen.

184
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,950
Tong Xin told me

185
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,470
that for Peter,

186
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,270
she wouldn't

187
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,510
start a new relationship.

188
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,750
What if her ex-husband

189
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,210
wants to get back with her?

190
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,670
Grandaunt, help me.

191
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,600
What should I do?

192
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,000
There is a way.

193
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,480
It's easy

194
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,910
but also complicated.

195
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:48,790
Xixi.

196
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,350
You'll only wear the wedding dress

197
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,630
once in your lifetime.

198
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,160
You must choose carefully.

199
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,320
Buy the dress that suits you the most.

200
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,830
Okay.

201
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,710
Bye.

202
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,150
What did he say?

203
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,360
Mr. Xiao.

204
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,080
How much do you plan

205
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,540
to spend on the ring for me?

206
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,710
I'll spend every penny I have

207
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,160
to buy you the best ring.

208
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:21,870
Really?

209
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:23,230
Are you sure?

210
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:23,830
Yes.

211
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,120
Lin said

212
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,590
how much you're willing to spend on my ring, wedding dress,

213
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,990
and our wedding photos

214
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:34,430
can show how much you love me.

215
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:38,670
Then let me show you

216
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,730
how much I love you.

217
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:41,350
Close your eyes.

218
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,670
Don't open your eyes.

219
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,370
Open your eyes.

220
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:52,470
Look.

221
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,470
You're giving me your salary card so soon?

222
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,720
This is not my salary card.

223
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,850
It's the money I saved for our wedding.

224
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,900
When I was abroad,

225
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,740
I thought

226
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,870
if we could be together,

227
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,670
I must give you the best of everything.

228
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,390
So,

229
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,310
all my scholarships

230
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:15,750
and all the money I earned

231
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:16,950
are in this account.

232
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:18,870
So, trust me.

233
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,210
I'll give you the best of everything.

234
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,150
But if we spend

235
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,350
all the money in it

236
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,550
on my wedding ring,

237
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,190
who will pay

238
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,510
for the wedding

239
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,840
and our honeymoon trip?

240
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,650
You want me to pay for them?

241
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,590
No.

242
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,960
Mr. Xiao, it seems

243
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,490
you don't love me that much.

244
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,710
Trust me.

245
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:43,070
Even if I have to sell everything I have,

246
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,510
I'll give you the best wedding.

247
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,770
If you sell this house,

248
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,480
where are we going to live?

249
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:48,910
We can stay in a hotel.

250
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,190
Where are we going?

251
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:08,910
Take that card.

252
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,350
Let's go buy

253
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,480
your favorite mall.

254
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:13,100
You braggart.

255
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,220
[WeChat]

256
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:22,990
Xixi.

257
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,610
I've thought about it.

258
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,630
Don't let Yicheng

259
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,830
spend too much money on the rings.

260
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,990
It's not easy for him to start a business.

261
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:29,750
Let me

262
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,480
buy jewels for you

263
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,070
as your dowry.

264
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,710
Do you hear him?

265
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,870
You're not his son-in-law yet,

266
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,530
but he's already on your side.

267
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,390
I'm lucky

268
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,200
to have such a father-in-law.

269
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,230
Mr. Xiao.

270
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:53,030
There's a bug in the minority language system.

271
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:55,760
I need to make a call.

272
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,150
Hey.

273
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,550
Mr. Xiao.

274
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,030
Something's wrong with the 3.0 translation system

275
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,370
[Ma]

276
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:07,830
of Icelandic.

277
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,030
If the leaders of the Consumer Products Bureau

278
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:09,990
come for an inspection tomorrow,

279
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,590
how should we deal with them?

280
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,280
[Ma]

281
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,180
[Control Panel]

282
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:37,990
Xixi.

283
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,030
I'm afraid I can't

284
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:42,290
pick out the wedding ring with you today.

285
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,160
I need to go back to the company.

286
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:51,070
Are you angry

287
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,130
that I can't keep you company?

288
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:54,710
Xiao Yicheng.

289
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,630
You didn't

290
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,910
disconnect Bluetooth just now.

291
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,070
Don't worry.

292
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,570
I didn't hear anything.

293
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:10,390
I know.

294
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,030
You're still up?

295
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,470
What's wrong?

296
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,740
Is something bothering you?

297
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:15,830
Grandma Li.

298
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,470
Two people in love

299
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,830
are on opposing sides

300
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,870
at work,

301
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,150
and they're facing

302
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,950
a conflict of interest.

303
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,230
One of them

304
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,030
found out about a flaw

305
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,710
in the other's company.

306
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,550
Professionally,

307
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:42,350
she should report it to her company

308
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,670
so that

309
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:45,910
her company

310
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,910
can have a better chance of winning.

311
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,390
But personally,

312
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,350
that's underhanded.

313
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,080
What do you think

314
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,150
the person who knows the flaw

315
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,550
should do?

316
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:02,380
Lin Xi.

317
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,710
Whether you win or lose

318
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:09,550
is not decided just by the look of it.

319
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,270
If you

320
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,750
win a victory

321
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:16,150
but feel miserable inside,

322
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:19,550
you actually lose.

323
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,550
Don't be held back

324
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,430
by the fear of loss.

325
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:34,990
Actually, all wars are fought to end wars.

326
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,030
So,

327
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,470
just follow

328
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,390
your heart.

329
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:43,070
All right.

330
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,830
Go to sleep. It's late.

331
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,470
Good night, Grandma Li.

332
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,310
Good night.

333
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:11,500
Can we fix the bug?

334
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,349
Director Dong said he'd come in three days.

335
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,430
See?

336
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:56,890
You can't do it without me.

337
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,510
What brought you here?

338
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,350
Sometimes,

339
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:07,070
it's fine

340
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,790
to be vulnerable.

341
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,910
Cheng Yao, I don't want

342
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,990
to talk about this matter anymore.

343
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,570
Let me take you somewhere.

344
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,070
I'm not going anywhere with you.

345
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,600
Grandaunt wants to see you.

346
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:24,910
Come.

347
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:31,110
Grandaunt.

348
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,830
Tong Xin is here.

349
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:34,470
Hey, Tong Xin.

350
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,030
Come in and have a seat.

351
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:39,000
Xixi and Yaoyao told me

352
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,730
that you've been working with big companies

353
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:45,550
at home and abroad for Yuyi's IPO.

354
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,150
I know you must be busy.

355
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,680
But I can't trust anyone else

356
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,590
to do this.

357
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,630
So I invited you here.

358
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,830
Grandma Li.

359
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,150
I'm glad to help.

360
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,670
What is it?

361
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:57,830
Here's the thing.

362
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,310
A publisher abroad

363
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,190
wants to publish a memoir

364
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,590
for an old friend of mine.

365
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,950
His son came to me

366
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:05,990
a while ago

367
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:07,230
and asked if I still had

368
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,390
his father's manuscripts.

369
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:10,870
I looked for them

370
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,000
and found many manuscripts.

371
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,590
Look.

372
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,470
But these manuscripts have no copies.

373
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,270
I'm worried that they may be lost

374
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,670
if I mail them.

375
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,630
I heard that you've been working

376
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:22,870
with big foreign companies.

377
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,780
If someone you know is going back to Britain,

378
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,230
can you ask them to bring these manuscripts

379
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:29,390
to my friend's son?

380
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,070
I see.

381
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,630
Of course.

382
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:34,430
Great.

383
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,190
Riston Hillis?

384
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,390
Is he the writer who won the Bram Stoker Award?

385
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:45,430
He was your friend?

386
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,450
He was not just her friend.

387
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,950
They were once lovers.

388
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,830
Really?

389
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:53,710
Of course.

390
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,970
Why would we lie to you?

391
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,070
Let me see.

392
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,480
Look.

393
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,860
[A Sign Over Half a Century]

394
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,310
Check the title page.

395
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:04,910
[Dedicated to her.
She is my muse of inspiration.]

396
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:07,880
My grandaunt was his muse.

397
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:09,550
My grandaunt

398
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:11,070
has quite a story to tell.

399
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:13,910
It's all in the past.

400
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,150
When I was in school,

401
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:16,870
I read this book,

402
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:18,150
A Sign Over Half a Century.

403
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,590
I was so touched

404
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:21,110
by this love story.

405
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:22,510
I never imagined

406
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:24,630
that I'd see the character in the book.

407
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,110
It's like a dream.

408
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:27,990
Grandaunt.

409
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,230
Tell her about it.

410
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:29,910
Your fan is curious

411
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,030
to know more about your story.

412
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,150
I'll go buy some fruits for you.

413
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,230
I'll leave you to talk.

414
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:33,870
Okay.

415
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:39,950
Fine.

416
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,150
It happened

417
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:44,350
many years ago anyway.

418
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,830
I can see

419
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:58,060
the breezy dome

420
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,740
of groves.

421
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,630
The shadow

422
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:05,590
of Deering's Woods.

423
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:09,150
And the friendships old

424
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:14,590
and the early loves. Come back

425
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,510
with a Sabbath sound

426
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:21,990
as of doves.

427
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,230
In 1963,

428
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:26,390
when I was 23,

429
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,550
I followed my father

430
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:30,110
to study in Britain.

431
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,990
At that time, my father

432
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,870
was a literature professor

433
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,990
at that university.

434
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:38,750
I met

435
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,750
the 31-year-old Hillis.

436
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,110
His father

437
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,670
was a sailor who came to Britain illegally.

438
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,590
He didn't have a proper job.

439
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,720
He was once married,

440
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:51,030
but his wife left him.

441
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,190
He had a four-year-old son

442
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:55,470
whose name was Joyce.

443
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:57,830
He wandered around

444
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,820
the campus all the time.

445
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,710
He thought himself talented

446
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:04,480
and was very arrogant.

447
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,950
Everyone called him crazy.

448
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,430
That's unbelievable.

449
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:10,470
Hillis

450
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:12,310
was such a talented writer.

451
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:14,950
At that time,

452
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:18,200
I was the only one who was willing to talk with him.

453
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:20,870
Over time, we fell in love.

454
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:24,510
The strongest objection

455
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:26,030
came from my father.

456
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:30,150
He recognized Hillis' talent

457
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:32,830
but doubted his integrity.

458
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,350
He refused to marry his daughter

459
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:37,430
to the son

460
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:40,070
of an undocumented sailor.

461
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,070
Not to mention that Hillis had a son.

462
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:43,910
Of course.

463
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,990
Another important reason

464
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:47,990
was that China was recruiting talent

465
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:52,310
at that time.

466
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:54,550
My father wanted to come back

467
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,750
to serve our home country.

468
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,030
So

469
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,200
you broke up with Hillis?

470
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,060
No.

471
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,510
We eloped.

472
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,670
We went to France

473
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:21,270
with his son Joyce.

474
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,230
At that time,

475
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:26,110
his creative work was on the upswing.

476
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:29,470
He wrote a lot of short stories.

477
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:31,310
Those short stories

478
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,270
turned out

479
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,070
to be the framework of his sagas.

480
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,670
Hillis

481
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:39,510
was good at writing

482
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:41,830
but bad at socializing.

483
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,110
I didn't think

484
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:46,030
it was gonna work,

485
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,230
so

486
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:50,310
I wrote critiques,

487
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:51,750
and in the meantime,

488
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,190
I played the role

489
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:55,150
of his literary agent.

490
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:57,430
I helped him

491
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,560
socialize with people and publish his works.

492
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:01,950
Gradually,

493
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,750
he got on the right track.

494
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,910
What happened later?

495
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,510
Why did you break up?

496
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,630
After my father returned to China,

497
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:11,950
he got ill very often.

498
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:14,480
No matter what differences we had,

499
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,670
he was still my father.

500
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:19,750
So,

501
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:22,630
I came back to meet my father.

502
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:24,430
In that era,

503
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:26,510
to leave meant never to come back.

504
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,550
But I had no choice.

505
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,190
Hillis and I made an agreement

506
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,390
that we'd never mention

507
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:36,340
each other's names again

508
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:39,590
and would keep that relationship

509
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:41,550
a secret

510
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:45,630
which would forever be buried in our hearts.

511
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:52,270
That's why Hillis

512
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,750
never got married,

513
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:56,070
and you…

514
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:08,310
24 years later,

515
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:09,950
I finally

516
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:12,350
got a chance to go abroad.

517
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:15,870
But what I saw

518
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:19,310
was his tombstone.

519
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,390
In front of his tombstone,

520
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:25,230
Joyce gave me those books

521
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:27,790
and manuscripts.

522
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,830
He told me

523
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:33,510
those were the letters his father wrote to me

524
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:36,390
in the past 24 years

525
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:39,030
which he didn't get to mail.

526
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,150
Joyce also told me

527
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:44,440
that after I left,

528
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,630
every book his father published

529
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:49,390
was dedicated

530
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:54,190
to his muse.

531
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:56,750
Hillis told him

532
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:59,030
that his muse

533
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:01,190
was

534
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:03,670
Aunt Rose.

535
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,480
Tong.

536
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:18,230
How much time

537
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:20,090
you can spend with the one you love

538
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:24,230
is decided by God.

539
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,950
When he gives you a chance

540
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:28,510
to be with the one you love,

541
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:31,110
you must seize it.

542
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:34,910
Because you never know

543
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:38,270
when you'll have to

544
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:40,500
say goodbye to him.

545
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:43,150
Every minute

546
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:46,910
you waste on hesitation

547
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:49,430
will become a painful regret

548
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:52,590
in the future.

549
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,230
Grandma Li.

550
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,910
Now I know why you

551
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:08,950
want me to do this thing for you.

552
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:15,070
But the obstacle between you and Hillis

553
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:17,230
was from Hillis.

554
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:20,530
The obstacle between Cheng Yao and me

555
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,830
is from me.

556
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:27,110
The biggest obstacle

557
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:29,750
is the worldly prejudice

558
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,110
that binds you.

559
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:33,030
But…

560
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,060
But

561
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,670
you think

562
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:36,870
because of a legal document,

563
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:39,270
you and Yaoyao have no future.

564
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,240
Tong.

565
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,220
The future

566
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:46,630
is made up of

567
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:47,830
every day at present.

568
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:51,730
You're worried that Yaoyao will regret being with you.

569
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,870
Yaoyao

570
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,150
will never regret the decisions

571
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,290
he made after careful consideration.

572
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,750
His parents

573
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,610
wanted him to major in economics,

574
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:04,440
but he insisted on learning a minor language.

575
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:05,830
Look at him now.

576
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,950
He's doing great at work.

577
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,750
People say

578
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:12,990
he has talent,

579
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,310
but

580
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:16,670
I know

581
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:20,070
how much effort he's put into it.

582
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:23,710
So I can tell you for sure

583
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:27,070
that he means it

584
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:30,400
when he says he loves you.

585
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:36,670
It's not that I don't believe him.

586
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,480
In our situation,

587
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:43,390
we can't just think about ourselves.

588
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:47,350
I'm divorced and have a son,

589
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,870
and Yaoyao's mother…

590
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:52,390
Tong, don't worry.

591
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:53,870
Yaoyao's mom

592
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:55,470
is open-minded.

593
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:57,780
She won't be biased against you

594
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:59,950
because of your past.

595
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,470
I've said everything I have to say.

596
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:05,700
You're a smart girl.

597
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:08,230
Think about it.

598
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:38,190
I don't have work tomorrow.

599
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,530
Do you want to hang out with me?

600
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:43,950
Sure.

601
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:45,400
Cheng Yao.

602
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:47,790
I don't want to set any rules

603
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:48,990
or make any promises.

604
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,830
But from this moment on,

605
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,950
I'll face up to

606
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:55,080
my feelings for you.

607
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,280
But you have to give me time.

608
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:00,990
As you wish.

609
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,070
See you tomorrow.

610
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,270

Are you here to work?

643
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:35,710
No, I…

644
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:37,360
I just wanted to dress formally

645
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,420
for our first date.

646
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:39,820
I see.

647
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:42,190
We're on different wavelengths today.

648
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:44,870
You decided to meet here.

649
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:46,270
Look around.

650
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:48,110
Don't you think

651
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,310
you're a misfit here?

652
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:56,470
I just thought

653
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:57,310
we'd look great together

654
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,750
if I tried your style.

655
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,920
I didn't expect you to change your style.

656
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,830
Do you want me

657
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:02,830
to go back and change?

658
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:03,710
No need for that.

659
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:05,300
I think we look great.

660
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,410
It's a mash-up.

661
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:08,990
Okay.

662
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:10,340
I feel comforted.

663
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,310
You're welcome.

664
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:14,790
Usually,

665
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:15,670
I come to places like this

666
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:17,110
with Peter.

667
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:19,490
It's the first time I've come here alone.

668
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:22,950
Fun fact:

669
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:25,150
I've never

670
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,430
come here

671
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:28,230
with girls older than me before.

672
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:30,670
So you've come here with girls younger than you?

673
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:31,950
No, no.

674
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:33,830
Let's go.

675
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:36,310

686
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:53,640

you must send it to me

You can choose any gift.

I'm not picky.

00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:58,590
How about we go boating?

Okay. No problem.

I need to find a portable charger.

741
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:08,350
I got you. I've brought one.

742
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:09,590
You can charge your phone on the boat.

743
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:10,120
Let's go.

744
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,780

What portable charger?

757
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:55,430
You said you have a portable charger.

758
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:56,630
I didn't say that.

759
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,870
Cheng Yao, stop kidding.

760
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:00,000
I'm not kidding.

761
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:01,110
I need to make

762
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:03,170
an important conference call later.

763
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:11,870
Let's go back.

764
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:14,070
At this speed,

765
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:14,710
it'll take more than ten minutes for us

766
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:15,870
to get back to the shore.

767
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:17,200
You won't miss the call.

768
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:30,470
What's wrong?

769
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,590
Close your eyes.

770
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:38,470
Why?

771
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:39,480
Close your eyes.

772
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:06,270
Do you know

773
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:07,870
who you reminded me of today?

774
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:09,790
Who?

775
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,230
My parents

776
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,690
when they took me to a park.

777
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:16,710
They were supposed

778
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:17,790
to play with me,

779
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:19,150
but in the end,

780
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,630
I was playing alone.

781
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:23,190
When we were in the park,

782
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,280
their phones kept

783
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,380
beeping and buzzing

784
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,590
ceaselessly.

785
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:28,590
I couldn't understand

786
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:29,790
why they were so busy

787
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:31,850
that they couldn't even take a break.

788
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:35,350
Listen.

789
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:37,390
Your company won't go bankrupt

790
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:39,230
just because you miss a message,

791
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:40,350
will it?

792
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:41,910
Besides,

793
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:43,150
your company has Xiao Yicheng.

794
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:44,680
Can't he share your burden?

795
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,050
Is he a freeloader?

796
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:47,550
He can spend time with Lin Xi.

797
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:49,150
Why can't you spend time with me?

798
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,950
You're right.

799
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,990
Cheng Yao, you have a point.

800
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:54,830
Can I open my eyes now?

801
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,230
Yes.

802
00:38:58,670 --> 00:38:59,730
I don't want it now.

803
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:00,750
Why?

804
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:03,430
My phone died.

805
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:04,510
You're right.

806
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:05,840
My phone needs rest.

807
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,190
So do I.

808
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,870
I'll have a good rest today.

809
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,950
And, from now on,

810
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,630
I'll push the pedals.

811
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:14,630
I doubt that.

812
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:15,230
What?

813
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:17,090
-I'm very strong.
-Go ahead then.

814
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,750
Did I cause you any trouble today?

815
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,390
No.

816
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:37,070
Tong Xin.

817
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:43,190
I think honesty is very important

818
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,550
in a relationship.

819
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:45,910
If I did something

820
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:46,910
that made you unhappy

821
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:47,950
or feel uncomfortable,

822
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:50,100
I hope you can tell me directly.

823
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,470
But Cheng Yao,

824
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:57,130
being in a relationship is a pleasant thing.

825
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:58,160
You don't have to

826
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:59,650
be so careful all the time.

827
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:01,230
Besides,

828
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:04,760
you should listen to your heart and enjoy the moment.

829
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:13,830
You're right.

830
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:14,830
Listen to my heart.

831
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:15,590
Let's go.

832
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,390
Yuyi's translation devices

833
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:28,950
were used for translation

834
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:30,550
in many important meetings.

835
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,830

836
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:35,100

Yuyi's interpretation device

840
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:15,350
is as professional as an interpreter

Yes, Director Dong.

96.3% of human doctors.

861
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:52,710
Amazing.

In addition to the virtual doctor,

medical image review,

three-dimensional sign language translation

867

It's still in the development stage.

871
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:07,230
Interesting.

872
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:09,030
Young man,

873
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:10,470
how old are you?

874
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,950
Thirty.

875
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:15,350
You're accomplished at a young age.

876
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:17,070
You flatter me, Director Dong.

877
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:18,730

Mr. Xiao.

What you've achieved

882
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:27,550
in the medical field is incredible.

883
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:29,400

in your machine translation.

Come on. Introduce it to me.

00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:34,470
This way, please.

887
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:35,350
This way.

888
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:47,910
So, free yourself.

889
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:51,510
Go explore the unknown

890
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:53,590
and enjoy the vast world.

891

Don't be afraid

00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:57,990
of different cultures.

00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:01,550
Just follow your heart.

894
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:03,380
Thank you.

895
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:08,230
When people from different countries

896
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:09,470
speak English,

897
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:10,430
they tend to inadvertently bring in

898
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:12,110
the accents of their native languages.

899
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:13,320
What you just heard

900
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,470
was an English speech

901
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:15,870
given by a Japanese.

902
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:18,830
Let's take the pronunciation of F as an example.

903
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:21,110
Because there is fu in Japanese,

904
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:23,470
F is often pronounced efu.

905
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:25,310
So when Japanese people say the word free,

906
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:27,240
they usually pronounce it "huli."

907
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:30,100
Yeah. That's right.

908
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:31,350
I've been to Japan.

909
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:33,190
They indeed have the kind of accent

910
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:34,510
you talked about.

911
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:36,950
Director Dong, look.

912
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:44,500

916

931
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:22,670
is your advantage over traditional translators

When translation systems

936
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:35,350
are on par,

937
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:36,550
I personally think

938
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:37,950
we should choose the solution

939
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:39,610
that's more cost-effective.

940
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:42,870
The cost of machine translation

941
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:44,450
is far lower than that of human translation.
