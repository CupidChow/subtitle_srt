00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,710
We are brothers.

196
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,630
Don't say that.

197
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:32,990
After your mother is done

198
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,050
with the check ups,

199
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,260
I'll arrange a hotel for you.

200
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,030
No need for that.

201
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,470
We can book one ourselves.

202
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,150
Sister-in-law,

203
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,010
you don't have to be so courteous.

204
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,110
Sir, this is your room card.

205
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,430
Room 1311.

206
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:48,720
This way, please.

207
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:49,550
Thank you.

208
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,890
Don't overthink about it.

209
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,080
Go have a rest.

210
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:57,830
Thank you.

211
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:10,880
Let me send you home.

212
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,390
You accompanied them to the hospital

213
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,190
the moment you got off the plane?

214
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,030
You were so busy that you don't even have time

215
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:22,030
to take a quick glance at your phone?

216
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,150
I'm sorry.

217
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,550
I guess

218
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:25,430
you've also forgotten that

219
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,470
today is my birthday

220
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,470
and we have a date at the restaurant.

221
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,030
Shasha.

222
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,110
Shasha!

223
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,550
Shasha, I can explain.

224
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,270
Shasha!

225
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,840
Hello?

226
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,510
Tian, you finally picked up.

227
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,590
Hurry and come to the office.

228
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,470
It's urgent.

229
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,430
Okay.

230
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,360
I'll be right there.

231
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,940
[Pantry]

232
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:08,950
Shasha.

233
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,990
- I can untie it for you.
- I've emailed you..

234
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:13,030
I've emailed you

235
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,560
the document you asked for.

236
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,270
About last night,

237
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:18,690
- it was my...
- Mr. Wei.

238
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:20,910
If there's nothing else,

239
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,010
I'll get going.

240
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:29,910
Just hit me with this.

241
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,150
Relief your anger.

242
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,350
As long as you can forgive me,

243
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,080
you can hit me however you want.

244
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,870
You don't understand at all.

245
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,550
Shasha.

246
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:53,120
What can I do to make you forgive me?

247
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:57,550
Shasha.

248
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:58,750
It's the weekend.

249
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,070
It's been a long time since we had a team dinner.

250
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,670
Let's have hotpot together.

251
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,030
Tian.

252
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,530
Let's go together.

253
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:05,830
Sure.

254
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,910
I have plans with Lin Xi today.

255
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:10,870
I'm not joining.

256
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,110
Okay.

257
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:17,990
Well,

258
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,010
I'll go browse the Internet then.

259
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,230
Shasha,

260
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,470
just give me ten minutes.

261
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,190
Okay?

262
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,070
Thank you.

263
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:57,910
I thought you asked me out

264
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:58,910
to get drunk.

265
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,310
Who says only alcohol is allowed in a bar?

266
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:03,550
Fine.

267
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,829
Whatever you say.

268
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,550
Is it true that

269
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,630
if there's only one party

270
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,750
contributing in a relationship,

271
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:31,880
they can't go far?

272
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:38,060
If this is a general question,

273
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,350
my answer would be

274
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:40,110
yes.

275
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,640
If this is about you and Wei Tian,

276
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,320
my answer is no.

277
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,110
Wei Tian

278
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:52,990
doesn't fall in love easily.

279
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,310
But when he does,

280
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:55,760
his feelings last long.

281
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,670
He's your friend.

282
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,150
Of course you'll defend him.

283
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:02,190
If you insist to decide on who's closer to me,

284
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,510
I would say my relationship with you

285
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,790
is far better than with him.

286
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:05,990
Why would I lie to you?

287
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,060
There's an old saying that goes,

288
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,790
"understanding is dependent on

289
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,960
proper communication and exchange."

290
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,310
Ask him if you have any question.

291
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:31,710
I'm going.

292
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,390
Let him pay.

293
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,240
No matter how angry you are,

294
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,000
you should still accept your birthday gift.

295
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,800
I made this myself.

296
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,910
What happened?

297
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:44,950
Zhang Hui

298
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:47,150
was my sergeant in the army.

299
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,470
One time,

300
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,110
we went to the mountains for training

301
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,770
and encountered a landslide.

302
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,510
We were all trapped there.

303
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,550
At night,

304
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,190
the temperature dipped.

305
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,390
I had hypothermia

306
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:03,760
and went into a coma.

307
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:06,390
He gave me his coat

308
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,330
and carried me down the mountain.

309
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:16,910
And then?

310
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,350
After that,

311
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:27,310
I stayed in the hospital for more than ten days.

312
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,870
My sergeant's mother

313
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,470
cooked soup for me every single day.

314
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,150
Eventually, our sergeant retired

315
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,230
and found a job

316
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,380
in a car repair shop.

317
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,390
Ever since I was discharged,

318
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,790
I've always invited him to come sightseeing in Xiahai.

319
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,250
He rejects me all the time.

320
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:48,550
I know

321
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,010
he doesn't want to trouble me.

322
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,510
But yesterday,

323
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:55,190
our prideful commander

324
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:55,950
gave me a call

325
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,070
and cried so hard.

326
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,200
I really can't be indifferent.

327
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:02,990
Shasha.

328
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,390
I'm sorry.

329
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:08,590
I broke my promise.

330
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:10,710
But

331
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:12,750
if you give me

332
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,080
another chance to choose between you two,

333
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:16,590
I would still

334
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,190
choose to go to the hospital.

335
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:30,630
I was wrong

336
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,160
for not texting you in advance.

337
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:46,790
Do you

338
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,910
perhaps have time tomorrow?

339
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,640
I'll come pick you up

340
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,870
tomorrow afternoon.

341
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:55,750
Pick me up? Where are we going?

342
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,150
What's wrong?

343
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,990
Why didn't you tell me earlier  that we're hiking?

344
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:10,590
If so, I won't be wearing this pair of high heels.

345
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,240
Let me carry you.

346
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,190
No, I can walk myself.

347
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:17,870
Come up.

348
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:24,630
Let's go.

349
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:34,510
Tian.

350
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,870
Why don't you put me down?

351
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,550
Do we look like we did

352
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:41,870
back in the old days?

353
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:53,940
No.

354
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:55,990
Why?

355
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:58,350
I was scared back then.

356
00:22:58,590 --> 00:22:59,680
But

357
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,510
I feel safe now.

358
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:05,670
Tian.

359
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:06,950
Why don't you put me down?

360
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,110
I really can walk.

361
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:11,830
Back then,

362
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,960
I could carry you down the mountain.

363
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,870
Now,

364
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,230
I can carry you up.

365
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:17,510
Let's go.

366
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,310
Hold on tight.

367
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,160
Where did you get the cake from?

368
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,190
You do remember

369
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,650
to make up for my birthday.

370
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:12,750
I brought this up

371
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:13,990
two hours ago.

372
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,710
You came up the hill

373
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,390
two hours ago?

374
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:18,790
Then why did you carry me?

375
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,340
Are you dumb?

376
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:21,230
Shasha.

377
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,030
I'm

378
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,960
not good at expressing myself,

379
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:28,150
especially...

380
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,350
I don't know how to say it.

381
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,990
Maybe in the future,

382
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,240
I would

383
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:36,390
still make mistakes sometimes,

384
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:37,990
and I may even...

385
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,030
Enough. I get it.

00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,040

♫Probe and approach with memories♫

388
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:01,870
Make a wish.

389
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:12,300
♫Distance is the slowly melting thin ice♫

♫Being loved by people I love makes me dizzy with happiness♫

394

408
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:51,240
This is my favorite birthday celebration

409
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,350

♫Love♫

411
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:08,910
"West Worthing".

412
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:11,270
This English noun is a

413
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,390
place name.

414
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:13,790
I think we should

415
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:15,520
translated it into "Xi Wo Xin".

416
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,390
I saw in an old book

417
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:21,790
that it was translated into "Xi Wo La Ding".

418
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,230
The translation of place names should still use

419
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:24,870
The Concise Dictionary of World Place Names as the standard,

420
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:26,930
instead of following what's common.

421
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,280
And I've already annotated

422
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,390
these few parts.

423
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:34,550
I think you should

424
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:36,030
consider them again.

425
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:36,620
Okay.

426
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:39,670
Mr Xu.

427
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:41,880
How is it going here?

428
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,830
You've been progressing slowly.

429
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:44,990
Is there any problem?

430
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:46,320
I may be able to help you.

431
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:49,790
Lin Xi.

432
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:51,710
Do you remember

433
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:53,590
the Nuo Prize winning book that

434
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:55,680
I've always liked reading?

435
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:57,910
The author only took 43 days

436
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:58,910
to complete

437
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:00,590
the first draft of the book.

438
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:02,680
But when the sinologists in Sweden

439
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,940
translated this book,

440
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,710
they spent six years.

441
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,990
So translation

442
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:10,440
is like dancing with a paper lock.

443
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,950
Every word and phase

444
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,750
must be used with cautious.

445
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:16,710
Got it.

446
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:22,030
I've sent you the revised manuscript.

447
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:22,640
Okay.

448
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:23,430
Sister Xi.

449
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,890
I'll give it to you next Monday.

450
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:25,510
Okay.

451
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:26,510
How much did you translate?

452
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:27,630
Send me parts of it first.

453
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:28,150
Okay.

454
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:41,990
How are you doing?

455
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:44,250
Any feedback on the translation script?

456
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:45,270
Not yet.

457
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:47,830
But I think I'll send it in a few days.

458
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:49,590
Sure.

459
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,710
After the project is over,

460
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:53,510
I'll bring you to the hot spring.

461
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:56,070
There are other things to do.

462
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,350
Wait a minute.

463
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:10,150
The Australian and New Zealand script has been rejected.

464
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:11,110
Rejected?

465
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,590
Ms. Lin, you're early.

466
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:22,970
Don't tell me you stayed up all night?

467
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:27,670
The Australian and New Zealand chapter was rejected again.

468
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:28,470
What?

469
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:31,630
It's been rejected twice.

470
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,430
I think the second script

471
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:34,750
is already perfect.

472
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:35,830
What

473
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,110
is Mr. Bob thinking?

474
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:39,790
I'm going out for a while.

476
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:06,390
What brings you here

477
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,310
and not in the office?

478
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:07,910
Did the company

479
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:08,670
called you just now?

480
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:09,400
Are you okay?

481
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:11,270
The company is fine,

482
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:13,440
but the phone call wasn't.

483
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,030
My parents will be visiting

484
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:17,870
Xiahai soon.

485
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:21,130
Could you do me the honour to have dinner with us?

486
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:24,030
To meet your parents?

487
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,340
Are you scared?

488
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:27,440
No.

489
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:29,070
Fine.

490
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:29,830
When they're here,

491
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:30,830
I'll let you know.

492
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,270
What do Uncle and Auntie like?

493
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:38,830
I can prepare in advance.

494
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:43,310
They like

495
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,880
a daughter-in-law.

496
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,800
Mr. Xiao is married?

497
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,670
Why didn't I know?

498
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:53,590
Where is she?

499
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,670
Hey.

500
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:57,680
You don't have to buy anything.

501
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,430
As long as you come,

502
00:32:58,430 --> 00:32:59,490
they will be happy.

503
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:02,630
Fine.

504
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:04,590
I still need to do some research here.

505
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:05,850
You can go back to work.

506
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:09,970

In terms of both wording

00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:18,110
and grammar,

511
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:19,030
I think

512
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:20,840
this script is almost perfect.

513
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:23,270
What exactly went wrong?

514
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,989
Could it be the translation?

515
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:31,590
Translation?

516
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:46,350
Xiao Yicheng.

517
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:49,550
Look at these cover.

518
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:51,110
Don't they feel weird?

[Bob Havertz] [Traveller]

520
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:01,740
[Bob Havertz]

521
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,180
They're all symmetrical.

522
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:08,550
Yes.

523
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:11,190
Look.

524
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:13,070
The illustrations in it

525
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:15,390
are all in this style.

526
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:17,230
OCD!

527
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:21,790
I remember there's this translator.

528
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:23,870
His criterion for scripts is

529
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:25,830
to always include page headers, page footers

530
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:26,550
and page numbers.

531
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:27,350
Even if only one of them is missing,

532
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:29,310
it will make him feel uncomfortable.

533
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:30,150
Yes.

534
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:31,070
Many scholars

535
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:32,400
have such weird habits.

536
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:35,030
So,

537
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,670
the problem of the script

538
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:37,670
is that

539
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:40,070
it make him feel uncomfortable.

540
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:43,150
It must be.

541
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:45,550
I'll go back now

542
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:46,750
to change the script

543
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,110
into a symmetrical form.

544
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,710
And I'll send it to him again.

545
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:56,870
Okay, then.

546
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:58,270
I'm leaving.

547
00:35:58,270 --> 00:35:58,910
I...

548
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:00,070
Hey.

549
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:19,190
I've accompanied you for so long.

550
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,920
Don't you want to repay me with something?

551
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,070
After I've sent the email,

552
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:26,150
I'll prepare supper for you.

553
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:27,510
Supper?

554
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:28,750
Is there

555
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,070
nothing else?

556
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:31,630
Like another type of reward?

557
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:32,960
Another type of reward?

558
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:36,790
About your gift,

559
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:38,550
I'll think about it on the way.

560
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:10,250
Reward!

561
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:25,270
This translation is too casual.

562
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:28,030
Would it be better to say

563
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:28,990
"The mountains are layered with emerald green,

564
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:31,390
and the flowers are as vibrant as brocade"?

565
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:36,070
This is good.

566
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,470
You're back.

567
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:40,660
I have good news.

568
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:42,400
The translation script for the Australian and New Zealand chapter

569
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,130
is approved.

570
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:44,830
Xi.

571
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,110
How did you change it?

572
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,720
Why did it get approved all of a sudden?

573
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,070
I remember the script from Team 1

574
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,750
was changed for five or six times.

575
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:51,990
I didn't do anything.

576
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:53,910
I just changed the format

577
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:54,710
of the script.

578
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,030
That's it?

579
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,030
That's it.

580
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:58,800
Maybe even Mr. Bob himeself

581
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,680
didn’t realize

582
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,590
about this.

583
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,000
Could you help to update

584
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,030
Teams 1 and 2?

585
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:06,360
So that they avoid doing useless work in the future.

586
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,200
Go.

587
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,070
Yeah. Go.

588
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:10,270
It's good to communicate tips.

589
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:13,230
Okay, I'll tell them now.

590
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,310
Lin Xi.

591
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:21,030
I used to think

592
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:23,230
you're a selfish and difficult person.

593
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,750
But after getting along with you these days,

594
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:27,950
I realised you're really a nice person.

595
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,600
I've came across a saying.

596
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,510
In this world,

597
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:33,950
30% of people

598
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:34,790
will have other falling in love with them

599
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:35,790
at first sight.

600
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:37,750
40% of people

601
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,150
needs to work hard

602
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,070
to make others fall in love with them

603
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:41,390
through personality charms.

604
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:42,950
As for the remaining 30%,

605
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:44,430
no matter what they do,

606
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:45,440
they can't change

607
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,300
others' prejudice against them.

608
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,550
It seems that in your eyes,

609
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,110
I'm part of that 40%.

610
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:54,870
Lin Xi.

611
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:58,480
Welcome to the Team 3 of the translation department.

612
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,620
[Birthday Banquet]

613
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:01,470
Dad.

614
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:02,830
Auntie Zhao

615
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:04,470
came to visit us a few days ago.

616
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:05,790
So I invited her

617
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:07,250
to your birthday banquet.

618
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:10,590
A nearby neighbour is better than a distant relative.

619
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:12,710
We used to get along with Aunt Zhao's family

620
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:14,350
like a real family.

621
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:15,390
Yes.

622
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:17,470
She's so enthusiastic.

623
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:19,280
She even said she would come earlier that day

624
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,590
to help us.

625
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,350
You can arrange it.

626
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:28,390
Grandpa.

627
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,390
Is there a problem?

628
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,590
Why isn't Xi's family here?

629
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:37,190
Dad.

630
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:39,590
You know Lin Xi's attitude.

631
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,190
Even if I invite her,

632
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,550
she might not come.

633
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:43,470
Mom.

634
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:45,190
Don’t say that.

635
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:51,630
Grandpa.

636
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:00,390
Look.

637
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:01,830
Grandpa is angry.

638
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:04,150
I'm just worried.

639
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:05,110
I'm worried that Lin Xi and the others

640
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,670
will mess things up when they're here.

641
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,470
If that happens,

642
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:09,730
your grandpa will still be the upset one.

643
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:13,190
I'm doing this out of consideration for everyone.

644
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:14,390
Chen.

645
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:15,910
Let's eat.

646
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:17,190
Okay.

647
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:28,950
Ling Feng.

648
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:30,810
Why are you still here?

649
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:33,440
I'm chatting with Chen Wen.

650
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,510
I'm sorry, Xi.

651
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:37,980
It's okay.

652
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,680
That's a different case.

653
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,110
How is she recently?

654
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:42,750
I don't know

655
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:43,960
what is she thinking?

656
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,110
She insists to be an English editor at a newspaper publisher.

657
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,500
Although it's stable,

658
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:48,510
the salary

659
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:50,240
is much worse than Huasheng's.

660
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:55,670
With her ability,

661
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:57,810
this is considered a waste of talent.

662
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:58,550
Forget it.

663
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:00,630
Maybe this is the most ideal job

664
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:02,550
in her opinion.

665
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:04,710
But the other interns

666
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:06,320
all majored in journalism.

667
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:07,880
She has no advantage at all.

668
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:10,620
Whether she can stay or not,

669
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:11,880
it's still uncertain.

670
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:14,790
Xi.

671
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:16,630
Can you write a recommendation letter

672
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:17,710
for Wen?

673
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,310
Please.

674
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:26,710
Don't tell her I wrote it.

675
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:28,510
Thank you, Xi.

676
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:33,390
I'm running late.

677
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:34,190
I'm running late.

678
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,250
Morning, Grandpa.

679
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:36,670
Auntie Wang. Milk, milk.

680
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:38,670
Slow down.

681
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:43,710
Shasha.

682
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:46,670
Grandpa.

683
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:52,450
I’ve sent out all of the invitation letters.

684
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:53,800
There's still one left.

685
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:59,980
[Birthday Banquet]

686
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:05,760
What do you mean?

687
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,630
The invitation letter to Grandpa's birthday banquet.

688
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:08,840
Open it first.

689
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:19,230
[Birthday Banquet]

690
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:21,960
[Presented to Gao Wenli's family]

691
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:27,910
Professor Gao wrote it himself

692
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:31,350
and this is the only copy.

693
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:32,630
You should know

694
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:34,240
what Grandpa means by this.

695
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:36,870
He and Mom

696
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:38,270
haven't met for 30 years.

697
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:41,000
Do you think it's appropriate for us to go there?

698
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,110
Shouldn't that be a bigger reason

699
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:43,870
to let Aunt meet Grandpa?

700
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:50,030
Wait.

701
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:51,670
This is the first time I see Grandpa

702
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:52,990
give in to anyone.

703
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:04,530
What's wrong?

704
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:07,310
I should ask you that.

705
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:09,430
What's wrong?

706
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:11,430
You seem distracted the entire day.

707
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:12,230
Tell me.
