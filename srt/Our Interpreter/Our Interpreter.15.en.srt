00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:54,950
Mr. Ding.

3
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,280
Mr. Mo.

4
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,200
Yes.

5
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,070
Mr. Gao... Place Mr. Gao in the middle.

6
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:00,710
Yes.

7
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:06,560
Ms. Tong.

8
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,310
Editor-in-Chief Chen.

9
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,240
I've informed

10
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,190
a few of my closest colleagues.

11
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,400
They know what to write.

12
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,150
Thank you.

13
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,800
These are some of the biggest names in the industry.

14
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,870
Will they come?

15
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:18,710
Lin Xi said they'll be here.

16
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,030
But it's already late.

17
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,120
Yes.

18
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,400
The press conference is about to start,

19
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,000
yet there's no sight of them.

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,590
The appearance of any one among the five of them

21
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,960
would be sufficient to blow up the stage.

22
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,020
Let's wait and see.

23
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,400
I will leave you to it.

24
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:32,800
Okay.

25
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,150
Director Lin.

26
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,470
Yuyi managed to hired someone from Huasheng

27
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,080
at this critical moment.

28
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,960
I wonder if they are

29
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,240
trying to make up for things.

30
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,430
I think it's because they are at their wits' end.

31
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,360
I think they called us here

32
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,750
to try and bribe us.

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,870
No way.

34
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,710
I attended the first generation's press conference.

35
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,680
Mr. Xiao is not that kind of person.

36
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,280
Xiao Yicheng is in a dead end.

37
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,680
Only by taking care of the media

38
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,079
can he make a comeback.

39
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,310
If he wants

40
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,400
to bribe us later,

41
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,560
you shouldn't stand on ceremony.

42
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,910
Let's get as much out of him as possible.

43
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:23,750
Do it if you want to,

44
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,210
but I don't want the money.

45
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,079
Let's listen to a recording first.

46
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,400
Yuyi managed to hired someone from Huasheng

47
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,079
at this critical moment.

48
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,079
I wonder if they are

49
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,310
trying to make up for things.

50
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,470
I think it's because they are at their wits' end.

51
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,430
I think they called us here

52
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,680
to try and bribe us.

53
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:48,800
No way.

54
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,710
I attended the first generation's press conference.

55
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,680
Mr. Xiao is not that kind of person.

56
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,400
Xiao Yicheng is in a dead end.

57
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,710
Only by taking care of the media

58
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,150
can he make a comeback.

59
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,240
If he wants

60
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,360
to bribe us later,

61
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,710
you shouldn't stand on ceremony.

62
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,030
Let's get as much out of him as possible.

63
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,800
Do it if you want to,

64
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,260
but I don't want the money.

65
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,910
There are many hidden microphones

66
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,710
in this conference room.

67
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:12,680
Everyone's conversations

68
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,120
can be recorded in real time.

69
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,000
Mr. Xiao,

70
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:18,070
that was our own private tirade.

71
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:19,310
Is that illegal?

72
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,040
If you, Mr. Xiao, feels that

73
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,800
our conversation has offended you,

74
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,070
we can apologize.

75
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,070
But today,

76
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,680
so many media outlets came

77
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,140
because we are here for Yuyi's explanation.

78
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,720
Everyone,

79
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,560
based on the recording

80
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,870
of the two reporters' conversation earlier,

81
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:38,600
can you tell

82
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,330
what are their personalities?

83
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,270
What does this mean?

84
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,240
Tian, do you understand?

85
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,560
Just wait and see.

86
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,430
One is conservative and cautious,

87
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,360
while the other has an active mind.

88
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,570
May I ask the both of you

89
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,310
to please read aloud

90
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,770
the content on the screen.

91
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,560
Today's dinner was so delicious.

92
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,040
My fingers were tingling with delight,

93
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,230
and I ate heartily.

94
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,510
The dinner is delicious.

95
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,310
I really enjoyed it.

96
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,440
I really enjoyed it.

97
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,360
Today's dinner was so delicious.

98
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,720
My fingers were tingling with delight,

99
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,950
and I ate heartily.

100
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,050
Wow, the dinner looks so good.

101
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,160
I just want to pig out and enjoy myself.

102
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,880
Shasha.

103
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,510
Why is it that

104
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,360
there are two translations

105
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,620
for the same sentence?

106
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,280
Perhaps it's black technology?

107
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,890
That's something.

108
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:41,390
This is personality-based translation.

109
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,270
Thank you to everyone in the media

110
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,390
for taking the time to come.

111
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,800
Yuyi officially launches

112
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,600
the second generation of our translation device.

113
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,270
It will match

114
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,190
the user's own personality

115
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,720
and their way of speech,

116
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,430
to produce accurate

117
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,120
and unique translations.

118
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,070
Mr. Xiao,

119
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,430
apart from

120
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,240
breakthroughs in the chip,

121
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,190
it looks like this version's design

122
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,510
has also changed.

123
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,870
Is there

124
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,840
any particular reason for this?

125
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,510
Editor-in-Chief Chen is quite dependable.

126
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,440
She even paved the way for Mr. Xiao.

127
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,680
Indeed.

128
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,120
It's easier for people

129
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,750
to communicate with each other.

130
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,190
While I'm talking,

131
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,150
you can also see

132
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,480
the words on the screen.

133
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,210
That's nice.

134
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,630
The translation device

135
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:30,290
is just a tool to aid us in life.

136
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,360
But I hope

137
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,190
it will become an alternate version of yourself,

138
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,480
where it can speak the world's languages

139
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,830
and think independently,

140
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,720
all while

141
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,450
conforming to your individual personality.

142
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,240
Hello, Mr. Xiao.

143
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,270
As far as I know,

144
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,390
Yuyi is currently deep in controversy.

145
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,630
Although you launched

146
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,560
your this personality-based translation as your trump card,

147
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,390
but what has been criticized by outsiders is that

148
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,040
you got Yuyi's translators

149
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,390
to impersonate as machine translators

150
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,870
at the first generation's press conference.

151
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:59,560
Mr. Xiao,

152
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,090
you can't just avoid the most pressing issue.

153
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,310
That's right.

154
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:05,680
Is that true?

155
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,070
Today,

156
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,920
Yuyi will bring you

157
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,050
a demonstration of live translation.

158
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,870
Huasheng will cooperate with Yuyi,

159
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:16,560
to have a battle

160
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,160
in personality-based translation.

161
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,360
I hope

162
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,600
the cameras of our media friends here

163
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,800
can be our witness.

164
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,950
Who knows if Yuyi

165
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,430
gave you guys the script in advance?

166
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,600
Who knows

167
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,600
what goes on behind the scenes here?

168
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,680
What if we were to supervise them?

169
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,159
They invited all of them here?

170
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:41,830
Yes.

171
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,000
Yes.

172
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,159
Look, it's Mo Xiu Qun.

173
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:51,560
Who...

174
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,760
Who are these people?

175
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:53,600
They are

176
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,730
masters in the translation industry.

177
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,390
Sorry, I'm late.

178
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,600
Grandpa?

179
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,750
If the five old folks here

180
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,210
supervise the challenge,

181
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,440
I am sure no one will

182
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,510
have any doubts regarding the fairness, right?

183
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,750
With the magnates of the translation industry

184
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,789
overseeing this,

185
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,360
we, as juniors, will be happy to accept any result.

186
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,960
If you still have any doubts,

187
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,620
it only shows that some people

188
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,200
have ulterior motives.

189
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,150
Yes.

190
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,080
With the five mentors here to supervise the challenge,

191
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,550
we definitely will be convinced.

192
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,020
Please have a seat.

193
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,550
To prove

194
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,480
the authenticity of our translation this time,

195
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,550
may we please have our mentors

196
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,320
to randomly choose a clip for us.

197
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,000
Professor Gao, please.

198
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,030
Let's choose from

199
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,790
Shen Congwen's works.

200
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,630
Professor Gao,

201
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,390
which piece do you prefer?

202
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,510
This one.

203
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,150
Okay.

204
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,320
The Yang family's mill is beside Shanzui Road,

205
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,790
one mile outside Buzi.

206
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,150
The location of Buzi is at a mountain bend.

207
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:06,150
The stream flows along the foot of the mountain.

208
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,150
It flows flatly,

209
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:10,000
but turns sharply at the bend near the mountain mouth.

210
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,910
Therefore,

211
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,550
someone leveraged it very early on

212
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,680
to build a stone mill

213
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,510
at the rapids.

214
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:18,870
Therefore,

215
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,840
someone leveraged it very early on

216
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,320
to build a stone mill at the rapids.

217
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,840
Yuyi's second generation translation device is indeed gotten faster.

218
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,600
That's really fast.

219
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:48,000
Yang's mill sits at the roadside down the mountain spur,

220
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,930
a few hundred yards away from town.

221
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,600
The fortified town nestles by a creek in the crook of the mountain.

222
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,640
The calm river flow drifting down the foothills

223
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:59,000
becomes a raging torrent

224
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,360
when it makes a turn at the spur,

225
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,390
of which

226
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,320
the locals have taken advantage of long ago

227
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,600
by building a stone mill

228
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,790
over the rapids.

229
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,750
This is an except

230
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,550
that

231
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,000
combines reality, dreams

232
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,480
and symbolism into one.

233
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,670
The language is simple,

234
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,420
and the syntax is concise.

235
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,370
At the same time,

236
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:42,870
it has a strong local flavor.

237
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,630
For example, the word "burg"

238
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:48,600
that was mentioned, is now rarely used.

239
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,510
So,

240
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:53,270
it's very difficult to translate.

241
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,400
Yuyi's second generation translation device

242
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,270
is quick-witted and speaks accurately.

243
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,030
It's pretty good.

244
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,050
As for Huasheng,

245
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,790
she is very particular

246
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,670
about her use of words during translation.

247
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,870
She also showed

248
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:13,110
the author's romanticism as much as possible.

249
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,480
Both have their own merits.

250
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:24,450
The younger generation is indeed respectable.

251
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,360
He should treat us.

252
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:08,840
Yes.

253
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,120
Gao must treat us today.

254
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,600
Yes.

255
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,440
Okay.

256
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,000
Yes.

257
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,440
Okay, let's have tea.

258
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,200
Tea is fine, too.

259
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,080
Mentors,

260
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,000
please wait.

261
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,790
Thank you so much

262
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,000
for coming out today

263
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,410
and speaking up for us.

264
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,550
Thank you so much.

265
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,930
You're welcome.

266
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,440
Your granddaughter is so outstanding.

267
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,640
She's just like you when you were young.

268
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,200
Enough, stop flattering her.

269
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,360
Let's go.

270
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,150
Yes.

271
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,390
In front of all of you professors,

272
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,440
I am just

273
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,970
making a fool out of myself.

274
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,720
Gao,

275
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,790
your granddaughter is young, beautiful,

276
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,520
outstanding, and even modest.

277
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:04,120
I envy you so much.

278
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,550
All right, let's go.

279
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,790
Okay, let's go.

280
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,190
We're leaving. Let's go.

281
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,600
Come back for dinner when you have the time.

282
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,150
Thank you, Grandpa.

283
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,600
Previously,

284
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:31,230
there was a press conference

285
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,750
where the organizer had offered a huge sum

286
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,030
to try and invite Professor Gao,

287
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,390
but he refused.

288
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,080
This time,

289
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,080
he did it for you.

290
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,320
Do you think we should celebrate

291
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,840
now that the crisis is over?

292
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,790
I've been working late lately.

293
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:00,480
I have no appetite.

294
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,390
You guys go ahead.

295
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,200
Me too.

296
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,120
I have to rush a manuscript,

297
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,380
so go ahead without me.

298
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,150
Since everyone is tired,

299
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,810
let's celebrate in a few days.

300
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:09,080
Wei, take the wheel.

301
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:11,600
Shasha, why don't you ride with me?

302
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,910
I have a question for Cheng Yao.

303
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:14,600
I'll ride with you guys.

304
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,390
Shasha,

305
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,390
what are you having for lunch?

306
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,320
I am not eating. I have no appetite.

307
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:22,240
Do you want to order something?

308
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,080
No need.

309
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,270
You want to produce a

310
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:33,150
48-hour documentary for Xiao?

311
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,320
Since the last press conference,

312
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,440
Yicheng's traffic data has been very high.

313
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,840
Instead of inviting a spokesperson,

314
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,840
why not let Yicheng

315
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,390
sell his own products?

316
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,630
Don't let him hear this,

317
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,390
or he will be proud again.

318
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:48,910
If there's no problem,

319
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,510
we are going to start preparing for it.

320
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:52,390
We should take advantage of the buzz

321
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,600
that the press conference has created,

322
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,670
and follow up with

323
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,670
an in-depth documentary.

324
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,390
The publicity will be great.

325
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,030
Well then, let me thank

326
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,240
Editor-in-Chief Chen in advance.

327
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,150
You're welcome.

328
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:01,840
Let's go.

329
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,200
As you expected,

330
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,120
the public's opinion

331
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,920
has completely turned towards Huasheng and Yuyi.

332
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,870
Yuyi's counterattack is harsh and cool.

333
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:16,790
Not bad.

334
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,790
I'm afraid

335
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,080
there's one more person to thank

336
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,540
for our success this time.

337
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,300
Professor Gao still cares about you.

338
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,440
Whether for business or private interests,

339
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,150
you should

340
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,680
make an effort to visit him.

341
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,270
Since did you become

342
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:39,480
an auntie from the neighborhood committee?

343
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,000
Don't you pride yourself on keeping your grudges clearly defined?

344
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,790
So what now?

345
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,660
Professor Gao doesn't count?

346
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,360
Got it.

347
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:54,960
By the way,

348
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,390
do you feel that

349
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,660
Shasha has been acting weird lately?

350
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,630
Really?

351
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,440
I think she keeps avoiding me.

352
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,310
Did you scold her?

353
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,710
You must have scared her.

354
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,310
I don't think so.

355
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,079
We're all working together.

356
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,720
If there's any problem,

357
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,030
we should talk it out.

358
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,359
How about I find some time and speak to her?

359
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:21,790
No need.

360
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,829
You're acting strange.

361
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,680
Since when did you care for

362
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,940
how your female subordinate is feeling?

363
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,270
You like her?

364
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,400
I...

365
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,880
have a girlfriend.

366
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,400
Your girlfriend?

367
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,070
Isn't she just a contractual girlfriend

368
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:38,030
to deal with your parents?

369
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,270
You've been together for six months,

370
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,590
yet you must have met only four times.

371
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,030
Of which, the three times you met

372
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,070
were to put on an act for your parents.

373
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,110
What's the point?

374
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,310
Lin Xi.

375
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,590
Don't talk nonsense.

376
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,990
It's not good for your cousin's reputation

377
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,970
when you say something like that.

378
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,310
What did I say?

379
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,080
I'm leaving.

380
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,590
What's wrong?

381
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,880
My shoes can't touch water.

382
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,640
It'll be ruined once the leather comes in contact with water.

383
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,200
Leather?

384
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,100
The sole of your shoes are made from leather?

385
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,590
How much is this?

386
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,830
Since when did you care for

387
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:56,090
how your female subordinate is feeling?

388
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,510
You like her?

389
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:13,960
I didn't mean that.

390
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,720
Any explanation is just a cover-up.

391
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:04,920
Xi.

392
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,830
-Auntie.
-You're here.

393
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,230
Is Professor Gao at home?

394
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,310
Your Grandpa is here.

395
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,240
By the way, your friend is here too.

396
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,070
Come in.

397
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,510
Actually,

398
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,830
the secret of Tai Chi

399
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,400
can be summarized into two sentences.

400
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,200
What's the point of going into details?

401
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,510
Simply live long, and never grow old.

402
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,680
Thank you.

403
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,640
I've previously learned Taiji for half a year,

404
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,500
but I barely scraped the surface.

405
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,550
Yes.

406
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:34,680
Lin Xi.

407
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,030
Professor Gao.

408
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:46,790
Have a seat.

409
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:53,960
Thank you

410
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,880
for helping us out,

411
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,790
and relieving us from this extreme emergency.

412
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,590
What?

413
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,480
You two

414
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,030
planned this beforehand?

415
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:04,200
Both of you have the same opening line.

416
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,680
Here, have some coffee.

417
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,480
Xi.

418
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,200
Is this for your Grandpa?

419
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,790
Professor Gao.

420
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,350
Open it and show us.

421
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,880
Let's take a look.

422
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,070
Did you two

423
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:41,200
truly did not discuss with each other?

424
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,960
This is an exclusive copy of the kung fu manual

425
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,000
which Xiao got for me.

426
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:52,960
Look.

427
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:56,920
This is the chemistry between Lin Xi and I.

428
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,790
This Tai Chi sword is only used

429
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:03,200
at the advanced Tai Chi course.

430
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,030
I am currently not there yet.

431
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,240
Professor Gao,

432
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,640
don't you have

433
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,200
Tai Chi sword lessons next year?

434
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,350
You can use it then.

435
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,030
Let's put it aside for now.

436
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,350
Xiao,

437
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,550
your device's new generation

438
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,010
includes personality-based translation.

439
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,640
That is very good.

440
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:30,400
Lin Xi inspired me.

441
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,200
However, machine translation

442
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,350
is just a form of support and foundation.

443
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:38,720
To get to faithfulness, expressiveness, and elegance,

444
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,180
we still require translators to translate.

445
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,280
I understand.

446
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,920
Let's not talk about anything else.

447
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,270
Let's just consider China's

448
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,750
poems, songs and fables.

449
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,470
Your translation device

450
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:51,160
may not be able to

451
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,920
precisely express its meaning,

452
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,750
right?

453
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,720
Yes.

454
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,450
We're still working hard on it.

455
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,790
Translation

456
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,240
is like Tai Chi.

457
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,570
It needs balance between Yin and Yang.

458
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:04,240
There needs to be a balance

459
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,700
between human and machine translation too.

460
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,920
Professor Gao,

461
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,750
from the start,

462
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,110
Mr. Xiao has collected

463
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,070
a vast amount of terminologies,

464
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,160
and parallel corpora

465
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,400
of various domains.

466
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,550
From words to sentences,

467
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:17,750
and then to articles,

468
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,440
he has already formed

469
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,920
a huge corpus.

470
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,880
So the machine translation system's

471
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,270
database

472
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,510
is very solid.

473
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:27,960
But I didn't

474
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,030
pit human and machine translation

475
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,270
against each other.

476
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:37,960
We still have work to do.

477
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,240
I'll take my leave first.

478
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,310
What?

479
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,870
You want to burn bridges?

480
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,550
That's not what I meant.

481
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,790
I'm doing this for your own good.

482
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,030
Yes, Lin Xi.

483
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,070
I think Professor Gao

484
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:51,330
has a very valid point.

485
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:53,160
I'm so enlightened.

486
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,720
Xi, look.

487
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,720
You have a lot to learn

488
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,400
from Mr. Xiao.

489
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:07,280
Professor Gao, I'm flattered.

490
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:08,590
We indeed

491
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:10,270
have some work to discuss.

492
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,720
We'll take our leave then.

493
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,000
OK.

494
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,830
See you.

495
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,680
We're off.

496
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,680
Where are you taking it to?

497
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,960
I am taking it to the storage room.

498
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,830
Don't touch it.

499
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,550
I'll handle it myself.

500
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:12,480
Tian, why are you here?

501
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,830
Xi said you're sick.

502
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,350
Why aren't you resting at home?

503
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,200
I'm fine.

504
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,240
But you look really pale.

505
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,310
Are you okay?

506
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,680
I'm fine.

507
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,280
Where's Shasha?

508
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,880
Shasha has trouble

509
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,590
with some of the translations,

510
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:35,920
she went to consult Mr. Xu from the translation department.

511
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,010
Generally, all's good.

512
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:44,160
It's best to make

513
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,160
the timing of the last sentence

514
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,160
a little clearer.

515
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:46,640
Okay.

516
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,440
That's all.

517
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,350
What if it's

518
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,440
this word?

519
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,030
Should I...

520
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:53,110
Shasha, come here.

521
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:55,960
Mr. Xu,

522
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,040
I'll ask you later.

523
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:57,640
Okay.

524
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,240
Have a seat.

525
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:12,350
How is Professor Chen's manuscript

526
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:12,790
coming along?

527
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:13,440
Soon.

528
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,350
Is there a problem?

529
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,680
It's been solved.

530
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:24,030
Is something bothering you recently?

531
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,350
N...No.

532
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,750
When something's wrong with the script,

533
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,830
you would rather ask Professor Chen Ji,

534
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,960
and consult Mr. Xu from the translation department,

535
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,160
instead of asking me.

536
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,950
Do you have a problem with me?

537
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,200
Shasha,

538
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,400
I'm

539
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:50,310
very straightforward.

540
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,480
If you feel that

541
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,610
I have offended you,

542
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,960
you... you have to tell me directly.

543
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,710
No, why would that be, Tian?

544
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:02,680
You've always looked after me...

545
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,480
[I mean], us.

546
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,510
If there's nothing else,

547
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:08,750
I'll get going.

548
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:18,830
Lin Xi is not home.

549
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:20,160
I'm here to look for you.

550
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,160
Come in.

551
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,020
Close the door.

552
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,350
Next time you come to our house,

553
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:31,150
remember to bring a pair of slippers for yourself.

554
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:45,510
Tell me, Mr. Xiao.

555
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,570
What's the matter?

556
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,550
I saw the live stream.

557
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,240
Thank you.

558
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,680
What live stream?

559
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,280
I don't understand what you're talking about.

560
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,270
You're the blogger who helped Yuyi

561
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:59,870
prove our innocence, right?

562
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,070
What are you thinking, Xiao Yicheng?

563
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,920
How could I be helping Yuyi prove its innocence?

564
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,320
I can't wait to step on it.

565
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,590
The blogger watch's color

566
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:15,240
and style,

567
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,840
is exactly the same as yours.

568
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:24,970
It's not surprising that people could be similiar,

569
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,760
hence we have the same watch.

570
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,880
Are you going to say that

571
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,550
you guys have the same account,

572
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:32,610
because someone stole your account?

573
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,860
That's also possible, no?

574
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:37,640
Are you that bent on

575
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,100
doing a good deed without leaving your name?

576
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,510
Xiao Yicheng, can you

577
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:46,440
not flatter yourself?

578
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:49,160
I am someone who stepped on Yuyi.

579
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,920
Besides,

580
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:53,310
right at this moment,

581
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,920
let me remind you

582
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,320
of my opinion once again.

583
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,720
Machine translation

584
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,750
can never beat human translation.

585
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,610
That blogger said the same thing.

586
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,550
What a coincidence.

587
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,330
Cheng Yao, have you ever thought about it?

588
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,710
Today,

589
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:16,030
they can use such a method

590
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,750
to attack machine translation.

591
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:18,640
Tomorrow, they can also do the same

592
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,970
for human translation.

593
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:32,790
Xiao Yicheng.

594
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,160
To resist internal chaos, we must first placate the outside world.

595
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,160
Take care of these guys first.

596
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,200
We'll settle our scores later.

597
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,510
So it's you, right?

598
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,200
Yes, it was me.

599
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,270
But I did so

600
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,920
just so that I could prove that

601
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,310
machine translation cannot fulfil the qualities of faithfulness, expressiveness, and elegance.

602
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:54,170
I was definitely not helping you.

603
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:57,510
Okay, regardless,

604
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:58,440
thank you.

605
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,000
I owe you a favor.

606
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,030
Wait.

607
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,360
I'm not done talking about what I just said.

608
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,350
Xiao Yicheng.

609
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:09,960
In my opinion,

610
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,860
you are an interesting opponent.

611
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,240
I couldn't stand those people

612
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,720
using such cheap and dirty tricks

613
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,920
to try and defeat you.

614
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,070
If you lose,

615
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,390
you can only lose

616
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:19,400
in my hands.

617
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,660
You must not give up so easily.

618
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,400
Don't worry.

619
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,000
Until I manage to chase Lin Xi,

620
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,310
I won't give up.

621
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,790
Xiao Yicheng,

622
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,800
I shouldn't have pitied you.

623
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:36,510
Cheng Yao,

624
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,200
at work,

625
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,480
we may perhaps

626
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:40,720
be good partners.

627
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,770
But when it comes to Lin Xi,

628
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,910
I'm definitely going to win.

629
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,960
Well then, let's go with what we've got.

630
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,690
I'm happy to fight till the end.

631
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Close the door.

632
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:12,450
There are countless people in the mortal world.

633
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,030
What?

634
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,960
You agree to join the competition?

635
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:29,440
That's great!

636
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:30,640
As long as you show up,

637
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,590
I'm sure you can kill that Waiwai's pride.

638
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,680
There are no tigers in the mountain.

639
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,790
Yet as a monkey, he dares to call himself king?

640
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:36,590
Let's end him!

641
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:38,830
By the way, Yao,

642
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,070
what made you

643
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,240
change your mind?

644
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,310
That Xiao Yicheng

645
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,550
thought tricking Lin Xi into the mountains

646
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,950
is considered romantic.

647
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:51,440
I

648
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,110
want to win the championship

649
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,030
on the court.

650
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,480
I want to confess to Lin Xi

651
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,600
in front of everyone.

652
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,060
I want Xiao Yicheng to know

653
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,240
what real romance is.

654
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,440
So, are you going to

655
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,960
confess your love

656
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:07,480
or battle it out against Xiao Yicheng?

657
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,560
Is there any difference?

658
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:12,240
Well, it seems like there's none.

659
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,700
What's the matter?

660
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,440
I have several meetings that day.

661
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,160
I don't think I can make it.

662
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:40,960
I know.

663
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,510
At 10 a.m. that day,

664
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:44,240
you have a contract signing with Maoye Group.

665
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,270
At 1 p.m. that day,

666
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:47,400
it's Mingxin Dairy Company's press conference.

667
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,350
But the press conference

668
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,870
will be over by 3 p.m.

669
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,590
From the press conference's venue

670
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,350
to my competition venue,

671
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,550
it only takes 18 minutes.

672
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,510
And my competition only

673
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,830
starts at 3:30p.m.

674
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,000
Lin Xi.

675
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:05,190
Skateboarding is my way of making friends.

676
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,680
We met

677
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,210
because of skateboarding.

678
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,760
No matter what happened before,

679
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,350
I don't want

680
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,610
to lose you as a friend.

681
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,680
So, I hope you can come.

682
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,050
I'll get going then.

683
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,240
Welcome to

684
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,680
the scene of

685
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,440
Haiwan Skateboarding Competition.

686
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,200
Let's have fun and go wild!

687
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,070
Cheer for your favorite skateboarder,

688
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,230
cheer for Waiwai,

689
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:37,160
and cheer for Cheng Yao, everbody!

690
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,110
Skateboarding

691
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:39,960
keeps us excited for the entire summer.

692
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,310
Come on, friends.

693
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,590
Let's cheer, everyone!

694
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,270
Warm up! Warm up!

695
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,480
Be cool!

696
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,960
Keep moving,

697
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,640
everyone!

698
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,830
This is the scene we've been looking forward to.

699
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:56,040
We want to see your most handsome self,

700
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,400
on this hottest day!

701
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,880
Let's have fun.

702
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,750
Give it up for our beloved skateboarding,

703
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:04,240
and cheer for our beloved players.

704
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,440
Cool!

705
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,480
Contestants,

706
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,190
charge ahead!

707
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,880
This is your time.

708
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:15,320
Today, let's get high together,

709
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,070
everyone!

710
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,030
Come on.

711
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,320
Warm up! Warm up!

712
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,230
Hurry up!

713
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,800
Move, everyone!

714
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,800
Yao, the competition is about to start.

715
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,280
Who are you looking for?

716
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:25,960
Let's get high, everyone.

717
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,000
Keep going.

718
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,670
It's almost time.

719
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:31,730
It's time to start.

720
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:33,880
The competition is about to begin.

721
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,590
Contestants, please get ready.

722
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:36,710
Yao, I'll go over first.

723
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:38,400
Come on, get ready.

724
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,670
That's good!

725
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:23,360
Go! Go! Go!

726
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:25,760
I thought

727
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,160
you wouldn't come today.

728
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,280
It's my friend's big day.

729
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,030
Of course I would come and support.

730
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:30,920
Great!

731
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:33,960
Is it going to start?

732
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,920
Hurry up and go.

733
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,110
All the best.

734
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,590
Cool!

735
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,840
Come on! Come on! Come on!

736
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,480
Great!

737
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,110
Lin Xi.

738
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,800
As a friend,

739
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,760
if I win the championship,

740
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:56,590
give me a gift.

741
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:05,400
Cheng Yao! Cheng Yao!

742
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:09,000
Cheng Yao! Cheng Yao!

743
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:09,920
So handsome.

744
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,820
Hurry up and go.

745
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,070
Okay, the first contestant, please get ready.

746
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:32,480
Here we go, everyone.

747
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,710
Come on, friends.

748
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:36,190
Charge ahead!

749
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:37,630
This is your time.

750
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,320
So cool. Come on!

751
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:54,000
Next up is...

752
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,360
Waiwai!

753
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,710
Waiwai's performance today is

754
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:02,400
very good.

755
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,260
He looks like he is in great shape.

756
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,440
That was great, my friends!

757
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,360
Yao.

758
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,290
Waiwai is doing pretty well today.

759
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:28,670
All the best.

760
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,400
The next contestant

761
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,230
is our champion,

762
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,400
Cheng Yao.

763
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,550
Cheng Yao!

764
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:38,630
Cheng Yao! Cheng Yao! Cheng Yao!

765
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,960
Yao!

766
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,710
Come on, Yao.

767
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,760
So cool! Come on! Come on!

768
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,190
Cool!

769
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:09,960
Okay.

770
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,800
Cheng Yao! Cheng Yao! Cheng Yao!

771
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,950
OK. Cheng Yao’s performance

772
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:33,840
is still very stable.

773
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:38,440
Good! Good!

774
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:40,880
Oh no, Cheng Yao fell down.

775
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,320
It seems like

776
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,550
he fell hard.

777
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,070
I wonder if he can

778
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,470
finish the competition.

779
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,110
Is he okay?

780
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:00,030
It seems to be a bad fall.

781
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,800
Come on! Come on!

782
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,860
Cheng Yao, come on!

783
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:15,440
Go! Go! Go!

784
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,880
You can do it.

785
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,560
Cheng Yao has got up.

786
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:22,670
Go! Go! Go!

787
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,840
Come on, Cheng Yao!

788
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,550
Come on, Cheng Yao!

789
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:34,320
Come on, Cheng Yao!

790
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,510
Come on, Cheng Yao!

791
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,280
Come on, Cheng Yao!

792
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,000
Come on, Cheng Yao!

793
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,030
Come on, Cheng Yao!

794
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:43,710
Cheng Yao, come on!

795
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,920
Go! Go! Go!

796
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,760
That's so cool!

797
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,000
This is our contestant from the previous competition,

798
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
and also our previous champion!

799
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,510
Cheng Yao is too strong,

800
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:02,360
everyone.

801
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:05,880
Great!

802
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,230
Come on.

803
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,000
Cheng Yao.

804
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,320
Let's welcome the champion, Cheng Yao.

805
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:22,960
Yao.

806
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:26,000
Bro,

807
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,590
that's pretty sick.

808
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:29,990
How could you win while being this injured?

809
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,540
You don't understand.

810
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,130
Congratulations.

811
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,840
Thank you.

812
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,880
So cool!

813
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,480
Next,

814
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,550
it's the most exciting moment for us all.

815
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:50,880
Let's welcome our champion

816
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,710
to leave behind

817
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:54,550
his medal of honor in the venue.

818
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:02,600
What does this mean?

819
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,430
This is akin to

820
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:04,230
leaving your handprint

821
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:05,480
on the Avenue of Stars.

822
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,480
A skateboard champion

823
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,960
can also leave their own mark.

824
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,070
I remember previously,

825
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,590
some left their handprint or footprint,

826
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:12,230
and someone even left their lip mark.

827
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:12,800
I wonder

828
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,800
what Cheng Yao will leave this year.

829
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,110
What is he doing? I don't understand.

830
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:42,590
What is this?

831
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,740
So she's the one whom he is confessing to.

832
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,480
Everyone.

833
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,630
Thank you

834
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:13,400
for coming to my championship today.

835
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,480
But the championship today

836
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,360
belongs to someone.

837
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,150
Without her,

838
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,600
I wouldn't have made it this far.

839
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,000
Lin Xi.

840
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:29,850
You promised to give me a gift.

841
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:32,030
The gift I want

842
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:34,440
is to make you

843
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,440
be my girlfriend.

844
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:45,440
Say yes! Say yes!

845
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:50,110
Cheng Yao.

846
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,280
I'm sorry.

847
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,610
Is it because of him?

848
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
I have something else on.

849
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:08,800
I have to go.

850
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:10,320
Congratulations.
