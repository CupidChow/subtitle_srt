00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:37,030
Other than Tian,

384
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,910
no one can help you win.

385
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,660
We are leaving first.

386
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,190
Let's go.

387
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,750
Use this to keep track of it.

388
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,510
-We will meet over there.
-Let’s go.

389
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,150
At 6 p.m.

390
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,420
Remember to remind everyone.

391
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,510
-Okay. No problem.
-Don’t forget.

392
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,350
Okay, bye bye.

393
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:54,990
Okay, bye bye.

394
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:55,470
Okay.

395
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,260
Wait for your mom here.

396
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,030
-Let’s go.
-Let’s go.

397
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,750
Hurry.

398
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:04,670
Go.

399
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,390
How about we team up?

400
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,790
-Go. Go.
-Okay.

401
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,109
Aunt Xixi,

402
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:10,470
can we be a team?

403
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,109
But...

404
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:14,099
Aunt Xixi,

405
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,310
don't you like me?

406
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,910
Of course I like you.

407
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:18,630
I like you the most.

408
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:19,430
Let's go then.

409
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:20,790
I’ll team up with him.

410
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,390
-Okay.
-Aunt Xixi.

411
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:21,710
All the best.

412
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:22,710
Let's go quickly.

413
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,260
Slowly.

414
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,960
Let's team up then?

415
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:27,310
Let's go.

416
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:27,839
Let's go.

417
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:35,350
I want to go to that castle.

418
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:36,950
To the castle?

419
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,750
You want to see the princess?

420
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,860
Boys also like to see princesses?

421
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,270
Does Aunt Xixi like to too?

422
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:46,550
I used to.

423
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,590
Used to?

424
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,150
You don't now?

425
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:53,350
It doesn't matter now.

426
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,930
Let's go. Let's go queue up if you like it.

427
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:57,950
What's wrong?

428
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,390
I don't know why.

429
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:02,230
I suddenly miss my mom.

430
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,790
I don't want to see the princess anymore.

431
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,320
I want to look for my mother.

432
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,590
Okay, let's go.

433
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,270
I'll go with you.

434
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,390
No need. Look.

435
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,550
You go ahead to see the princesses.

436
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,710
It's not a long walk, I can do this myself.

437
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:13,310
Bye bye.

438
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:15,390
Be careful!

439
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:44,000
What are you looking at?

440
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,390
Nothing.

441
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,200
Mommy! Mommy!

442
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:51,150
Here!

443
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,190
Sir, stop the car.

444
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:54,200
Bye.

445
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:54,630
Bye.

446
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:55,020
Here.

447
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,230
I got it, Mom.

448
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,590
Why are you back?

449
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:58,550
Of course

450
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:00,080
I have to team up with my mom.

451
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,390
All right.

452
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,230
You two are a team.

453
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:03,190
I'm leaving first.

454
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,470
Let's go together.

455
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,150
I'm injured.

456
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,350
I won't drag you down.

457
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,030
No.

458
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:13,230
You must come with us.

459
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,430
Why?

460
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,150
Because...

461
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,070
Peter.

462
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,060
Are you two hiding something

463
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:25,830
from me?

464
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,150
If you don't tell me,

465
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:28,190
I will not go.

466
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:29,750
Do you want to sit

467
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,270
or are you going to look for

468
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,070
Aunt Xixi when we have walked far out?

469
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,390
Godfather and Aunt Xixi

470
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:35,350
are a team.

471
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,910
You'll be extra if you go.

472
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,410
[Magic Castle]

473
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,190
Sorry!

474
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,040
[Magic Castle]

475
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,310
Why are you here?

476
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,110
Where should I be?

477
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,450
Aren't you on a business trip?

478
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:29,470
You really want me to go on a business trip today?

479
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,400
Your colleague said so.

480
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:35,310
How can I forget

481
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,850
such an important day?

482
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,080
You still remember?

483
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:42,990
Of course.

484
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,390
Tong Xin repeatedly reminded me

485
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:46,030
of our first teambuilding.

486
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,090
How could I forget?

487
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:52,680
Am I wrong?

488
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:56,710
No.

489
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,790
I also hope that through this

490
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,310
teambuilding, Huasheng and Yuyi's

491
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,270
cooperation can become smoother

492
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,190
in the future.

493
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,870
Nice clothes.

494
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,550
I left in a hurry this morning

495
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,150
so I just wore whatever.

496
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:20,510
Okay, let's go.

497
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:29,000
[Magic Castle]

498
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,460
Why are you standing there?

499
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,230
Let's queue.

500
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,010
I'm not queuing up.

501
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,830
I just want to rest here.

502
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:34,910
Rest here?

503
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:36,960
Why? I can't do that?

504
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:38,790
You can.

505
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:41,040
Accompany with me to queue up then.

506
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:44,050
You don't like to queue up, do you?

507
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,070
I changed.

508
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:47,560
I don't like to queue up.

509
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:50,910
You changed too?

510
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,990
I remember

511
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,550
you really liked

512
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:02,110
these fake princesses.

513
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,910
You even made me queue up.

514
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,960
You also wore this back then.

515
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:09,110
I thought you wore this

516
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,470
to reminisce the old memories with me.

517
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,160
Don't you not remember?

518
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,790
Do you want me to forget?

519
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,350
Xiao Yicheng,

520
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,810
what are you trying to say?

521
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:23,990
Teambuilding.

522
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,150
Let's go.

523
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,610
Otherwise, we'll be last.

524
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,910
Xiao Yicheng and Lin Xi are a team?

525
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:31,910
Isn't he not coming?

526
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,110
You heard it wrong.

527
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:40,630
I see.

528
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:41,950
It's not a teambuilding at all.

529
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,100
It's just creating an opportunity for them.

530
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:43,750
Right?

531
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,230
Working together,

532
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,430
we should build our unity too.

533
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:47,510
-Right? -Cut it out.

534
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:48,350
Cheng Yao, let...

535
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,430
Let me explain.

536
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,150
I don't think there's anything

537
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:50,910
to explain.

538
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:51,550
I thought

539
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:52,710
you were different from Xiao Yicheng.

540
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:53,350
In the end,

541
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:54,390
you praised me and comforted me

542
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:55,390
for him, right?

543
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:56,950
But it's not like that.

544
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,480
Did you drop something?

545
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,240
Yes.

546
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,160
It's broken.

547
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,430
This bracelet is my mom's treasure.

548
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,550
You big baddie.

549
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:24,750
Is this expensive?

550
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,790
I can save money to compensate you.

551
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:27,790
You can't afford it.

552
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,200
This is the only gift

553
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,390
my dad gave my mom.

554
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:31,430
Peter, stop it.

555
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,710
Let's count it as we're even now.

556
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,910
Let's go and check out the attractions.

557
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:45,970
You want my mom to come hold your hand?

558
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:50,070
Let's go.

559
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,350
Here.

560
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:20,630
Smile.

561
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:23,510
Okay.

562
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:24,190
Done.

563
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,260
Don't you want to take a photo?

564
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,030
One more.

565
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,070
Shasha, how about

566
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,510
I take a photo for you?

567
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:29,590
What do you think?

568
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:30,270
Let me see.

569
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:32,510
Are you afraid that I won't take it well?

570
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,110
No.

571
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,490
Do you only want the computer?

572
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:40,990
Don't worry.

573
