00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:14,850
Are you two taking turns to torture me?

192
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:16,930
You told him?

193
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:17,980
Told him what?

194
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,500
You had diarrhea?

195
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,940
I told him.

196
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:23,750
What's wrong?

197
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,580
He told me he loves me.

198
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:32,110
No wonder he kept tricking me into saying something before.

199
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,430
What did you say to him?

200
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,550
I refused.

201
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:43,590
Lin Xi.

202
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,270
These years,

203
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:47,590
many boys have chased you.

204
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,310
You thought some of them were tall.

205
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,840
You thought some of them were short.

206
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,870
Or you thought

207
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,470
their noses weren't straight enough.

208
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:54,630
You thought

209
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,470
their perfume smelt bad.

210
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,590
Do you feel

211
00:13:59,060 --> 00:13:59,750
that you've been treating them

212
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,990
with the same standards

213
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:01,870
as you treated Xiao Yicheng?

214
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,660
You still love him.

215
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,550
Maybe.

216
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,030
Maybe?

217
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,190
I really don't understand

218
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,790
what you're thinking.

219
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,870
For women

220
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:24,910
of my age,

221
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,740
love

222
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,870
only accounts for ten percent of life.

223
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,350
If the ten percent

224
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,310
affect

225
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,950
the remaining 90 percent,

226
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:35,550
it's not worth it.

227
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:38,990
You're thinking too much.

228
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,770
In order to make him go abroad that year,

229
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:47,070
I said some harsh words.

230
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,110
And also because of

231
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,230
our current working relationship,

232
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,190
there're many

233
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,150
uncertainties.

234
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,670
What do you mean

235
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,630
by uncertainties?

236
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,630
No matter how much people love each other,

237
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:06,590
they'll quarrel,

238
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,110
have misunderstandings,

239
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,590
and even break up.

240
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:14,990
But my current state

241
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,470
can't bear any changes.

242
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,230
The change you said

243
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:23,870
means

244
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:25,510
you're going to the UN?

245
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,960
That's just one of them.

246
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,400
Lin Xi.

247
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,030
I really don't understand

248
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,750
what you're thinking.

249
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:40,750
What

250
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:42,470
are you thinking...

251
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,990
Go to sleep.

252
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:09,630
No.

253
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:10,830
Come here.

254
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:11,870
Hurry up.

255
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,790
No. I'm not going to bed.

256
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,150
I'll say it again.

257
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,790
There's no ice cream.

258
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,630
No ice cream,

259
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:19,590
no sleep.

260
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:20,590
The Chinese doctor said

261
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:21,790
your airway isn't good.

262
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:22,990
You can't eat ice cream.

263
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,630
The American doctor said

264
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:25,670
it's okay.

265
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,510
Are you going to sleep?

266
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,070
No.

267
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:29,660
Fine.

268
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:31,390
I'm not going to bed.

269
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,070
Suit yourself.

270
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:32,950
Ice cream!

271
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:34,510
Ice cream!

272
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:46,230
Come in.

273
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:47,670
You're still up?

274
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,790
During the day, I reviewed the briefs

275
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,870
with some suppliers.

276
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:53,790
The dialect recognition ability test

277
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,390
of Yuyi Translator 2.0

278
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,010
hasn't been checked yet.

279
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,760
I need to run it.

280
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,110
You're running the program?

281
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,350
Isn't Marco in charge of

282
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:00,480
debugging programs?

283
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,080
Why are you doing it yourself?

284
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,550
Marco

285
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,109
sent me the content structure today.

286
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:07,109
I was supposed to

287
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,150
reply to him this afternoon.

288
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:10,109
But I was busy during the day.

289
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,310
A beta test will be arranged tomorrow.

290
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:12,829
If we ask him

291
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:14,230
to run it now,

292
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,310
the effect may not be perfect.

293
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:16,500
I have time to run it.

294
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,660
Do you regret it?

295
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:19,670
Regret what?

296
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,099
Out of anger,

297
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:22,609
you fired the agency.

298
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,200
If I hadn't dealt with it as a special case,

299
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,270
according to the normal procedures,

300
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,510
would the people from the company

301
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:29,990
have agreed?

302
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,150
If we delayed

303
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,590
until the bidding time,

304
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:34,510
we'd be very passive.

305
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,020
Right.

306
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:45,550
You're so tired.

307
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,510
But you're in a good mood.

308
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,550
Have you two made progress?

309
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,390
I told her I love her.

310
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:55,310
She agreed?

311
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,150
She refused.

312
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,300
Then why are you smiling?

313
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:02,720
I know

314
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:03,750
she still loves me.

315
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,240
So I can wait.

316
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,280
I'm going to bed first.

317
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,470
Good night, Mr. Xiao.

318
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,030
Bird's nest. Fish maw.

319
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,240
Shasha.

320
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:31,430
I put the bird's nest and fish maw

321
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:32,830
in the bag in the upper right corner.

322
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:33,630
Be careful

323
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:34,710
when you unpack.

324
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:35,710
Okay.

325
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,440
Soothing aromatherapy essential oil.

326
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,150
I put it

327
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,620
in the smallest bag.

328
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:41,590
Did you bring

329
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,470
your sunscreen?

330
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,230
Yes.

331
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,030
How many bottles?

332
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,030
Is it enough?

333
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,230
You have solar dermatitis.

334
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,390
Apply it more.

335
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,950
Don't expose yourself to the sun.

336
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,430
If it flares up,

337
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,750
it'll be troublesome.

338
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,270
You'll be out of town.

339
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:53,870
We won't be able

340
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,270
to take care of you.

341
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,920
Auntie Wang, don't worry.

342
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,580
As long as the sun isn't strong,

343
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,670
there won't be any problems.

344
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,830
Cold medicine.

345
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,110
Wait.

346
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,760
I have an important thing.

347
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,980
What else?

348
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,510
This.

349
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:15,830
You want to bring it?

350
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,080
Put it here.

351
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:23,990
Auntie.

352
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:24,710
Put that makeup bag

353
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:26,070
in my room later,

354
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:26,830
okay?

355
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,390
Be careful of sunshine.

356
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:31,830
Okay.

357
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:32,550
Be careful.

358
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,230
Got it.

359
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:34,350
Call me when you arrive.

360
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:34,870
Okay.

361
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:36,000
It's raining. Go inside.

362
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,990
-Okay.
-Bye-bye.

363
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:39,630
Let's go.

364
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:47,270
[Convey the City's Warmth and Build a Beautiful Home Together]

365
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,510
Tian.

366
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,810
That's all you have?

367
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,070
So many things?

368
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:17,970
We're going for seven days.

369
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,300
Hello.

370
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,270
We can do it ourselves.

371
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:21,870
Okay.

372
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,070
Thank you.

373
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,190
Let me do it.

374
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,030
Hello.

375
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,590
Is the luggage yours?

376
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,550
It's mine.

377
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,170
What's the thing shaped like a pillar inside?

378
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:54,390
A pillar?

379
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,510
What's that?

380
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:00,440
A mace or a billy club?

381
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:02,150
Please come

382
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:03,430
and check with me.

383
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:04,950
Okay.

384
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,300

00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:41,950
Sir,

577
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,500
one vanilla ice cream, please.

578
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:44,950
Hello.

579
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,630
Today is our shop's anniversary.

580
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:47,470
If both of you

581
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:48,550
are a couple,

582
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:50,310
we have an event today.

583
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:51,390
As long as you kiss,

584
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:52,150
you can get

585
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,430
our ice cream for free.

586
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,470
What are the rules?

587
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:58,270
A kiss on the forehead earns one scoop of ice cream.

588
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:00,590
If you kiss on the lips, you get two scoops of ice cream.

589
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:04,070
If you kiss for half a minute,

590
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:06,230
you get five free vouchers.

591
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:07,630
Then we must get

592
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:08,430
the biggest prize.

593
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:18,910
Okay.

594
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:19,470
That was good.

595
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,350
Wait a moment.

596
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:21,970
Okay.

597
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:39,680
♫When I meet the right person♫

598
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:43,910
♫I'll stop and wait♫

599
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:47,030
What's with that expression?

600
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,950
Is a single scoop not enough?

601
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:50,470
♫I'll be willing to give my all♫

602
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,990
How about five double-scoops?

603
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:54,660
♫To look into your gentle eyes♫

604
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:53,070
Xiao Yicheng.

605
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:54,470
I made it very clear

606
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:55,790
last night.

607
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:58,670
I just want to eat a single scoop of ice cream.

608
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,390
I don't have money with me.

609
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:01,990
You can pay by WeChat.

610
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:02,980
I don't have money in my WeChat either.

611
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:03,830
I'll pay for you.

612
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,340
Does this count as bribing the client?

613
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:20,910
I'm sorry.

614
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:21,790
I'm just kidding.

615
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:23,170
It wasn't funny.

616
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:27,350
You blushed just now.

617
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:28,870
If you kiss

618
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:30,270
any female employee from Party B,

619
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,950
she will definitely blush, okay?

620
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,350
Let me tell you.

621
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,590
I'm not an easy person.

622
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:37,990
How are you getting around?

623
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,190
Did you drive?

624
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:41,030
I am going green, so I'll take the subway.

625
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:41,950
Let me give you a ride.

626
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:42,750
No need.

627
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:47,630
Let me give you a ride.

628
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:48,550
No need.

629
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,590
How is my cousin?

630
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,840
It reminds me of a saying.

631
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,430
It wasn't naivety that defeated me,

632
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:02,400
it was innocence.

633
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,110
You must protect her these few days

634
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:06,270
during the Agricultural Product Trade Exhibition.

635
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,070
Otherwise, Professor Gao

636
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,310
won't let you go.

637
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:12,070
Okay.

638
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,030
What are you laughing at?

639
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,600
Nothing.

640
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:37,550
Thank you, Mr. Xiao.

641
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,390
I need to use the bathroom.

642
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:43,310
It's not convenient?

643
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,030
Follow me.

644
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:02,150
I forgot my keys.

645
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:06,020
It looks like Director Lin

646
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,590
doesn't want to let me in.

647
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:08,670
No, I really forgot my keys.

648
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:09,470
Look.

649
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,480
Why don't you...

650
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,510
If you're urgent,

651
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:13,520
you can go to the cafe downstairs

652
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,080
and use their washroom.

653
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,070
Sure.

654
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,270
Well,

655
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,790
since you don't have your keys either,

656
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:20,790
let's have supper together.

657
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,760
You're not willing?

658
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,790
Your dark eye circles

659
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,040
are pretty deep lately.

660
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:35,470
Don't move.

661
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:38,090
What's going on?

662
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:41,010
I've been working on tenders lately.

663
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:42,710
Who are you?

664
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,530
-It’s you.
-It’s you.

665
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:53,430
You've met him?

666
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:55,910
Don't you remember?

667
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:56,750
He's the one who

668
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:57,870
tried to pay me off.

669
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,750
He came to see you himself?

670
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:11,670
Well,

671
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:13,190
I'm going back to my room and start the upgrading.

672
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:14,830
I've been pressed to death.

673
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:15,550
I'm off.

674
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:23,760
You shall wear...

675
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:29,510
I'm not used to wearing hotel slippers.

676
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,030
Why don't you wear mine?

677
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,190
I don't wear shoes that are small.

678
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:39,909
Let me see if there's a pair of shoe covers.

679
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,510
The bathroom is on the left.

680
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:52,070
Well...

681
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,670
Why does Cheng Yao live here?

682
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:56,510
He's Grandma Li's grandson.

683
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:03,390
So, you guys are roommates?

684
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,290
Would you like something to drink?

685
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,670
Anything is fine.

686
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:15,750
Hello.

687
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,640
Why are you still here?

688
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:23,070
I need to talk to Lin Xi about something.

689
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:25,550
What is it?

690
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:27,430
Private matters.

691
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:28,880
What private matters?

692
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:30,290
Why should I tell you?

693
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:37,600
After you arrive,

694
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,630
meet with the organizing committee first.

695
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,740
As for Charlie,

696
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,650
it should be tomorrow morning.

697
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,800
I think Xixi's current call

698
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,140
will likely go on for a while more.

699
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,370
Mr. Xiao, why don't you leave first?

700
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:57,870
Mr. Xiao,

701
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,440
I have some

702
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,430
very important matters

703
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:01,960
to discuss with Xixi later.

704
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,350
As an outsider,

705
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:04,660
it's inconvenient to have you around.

706
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:21,510
Thank you.

707
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:24,110
By the way,

708
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,270
there's new information from Yuyi.

709
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:27,510
Did Tong Xin send it to you?

710
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:29,270
Let me check.

711
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:37,790
No, she didn't.

712
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:39,710
Well then,

713
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,910
let me show you.

714
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:43,910
If you have any questions,

715
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:44,990
you can ask me anytime.

716
00:37:58,370 --> 00:37:59,100
By the way,

717
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:00,860
Cheng Yao said

718
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,390
you guys have something very important

719
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:03,310
to talk about.

720
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:04,710
Am I disturbing you?

721
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:06,840
What is it?

722
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:10,390
No, nothing.

723
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:11,390
Nothing at all.

724
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:14,510
How scheming.

725
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,450
What tea?

726
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:21,650
Well, I wanted to ask you.

727
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,170
How about I get you something to drink?

728
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:24,630
Okay.

729
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:25,710
Me too.

730
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:57,940
There's more below.

731
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,220
Xixi.

732
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,700
Where is the milk frother?

733
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,950
It's in the cabinet below.

734
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,440
Really?

735
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,760
I don't see it.

736
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,230
Let me help you look for it.

737
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:13,910
Wait a minute.

738
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,470
I placed it here yesterday.

739
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:26,110
Here?

740
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:26,870
Isn't this it?

741
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:28,140
How about this?

742
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:29,510
I'll make you

743
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:30,710
the one I made for you last time.

744
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,750
-All right.
-Okay.

745
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,430
Here, the coffee is ready.

746
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:42,310
Be careful.

747
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,910
Excuse me.

748
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:45,790
Please.

749
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:46,790
Be careful.

750
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:48,430
Xixi, here.

751
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:49,190
This is for you.

752
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:50,860
Thank you.

753
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,070
Where's mine?

754
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:55,710
Just have mine instead.

755
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:56,190
Okay.

756
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,030
Wait.

757
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,000
Mr. Xiao, yours will have a special blend.

758
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,270
This cup is for Xixi.

759
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,230
Drink it while it’s hot.

760
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:10,350
Thank you.

761
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:11,990
Sorry to trouble you then.

762
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,190
Here.

763
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:22,750
This...

764
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:23,550
I think over here...

765
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:24,470
Look.

766
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,830
I took a look at this.

767
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:28,630
It does not have to be so complicated.

768
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:29,670
Okay.

769
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:30,830
I'll go back and tell them about it.

770
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:41,020
Why did Mr. Xiao scoot over again?

771
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:41,750
Mr. Xiao, be careful.

772
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:42,470
Be careful of the coffee.

773
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:43,390
Be careful.

774
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:46,470
Here, this is for you.

775
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:50,310
This...

776
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:54,270
You've lost your touch.

777
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:56,310
I initially wanted

778
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:57,270
to make a turmeric latte

779
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:58,630
for Mr. Xiao,

780
00:40:58,710 --> 00:40:59,960
and pull a nice latte art for him.

781
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,110
But my hands trembled,

782
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:02,590
and so,

783
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:03,470
it turned out like this.

784
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:05,190
But, it definitely does not affect the taste.

785
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:06,670
Mr. Xiao, do you mind?

786
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:07,670
I don't think so, right?

787
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:13,430
I haven't drink mine.

788
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:14,630
Have mine instead.

789
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:15,630
Okay.

790
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:18,790
This is good.

791
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:24,590
It's good.

792
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:27,990
Lin Xi.

793
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:29,550
Look at the last line.

794
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:32,410
We just added this.

795
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:33,830
Other companies feel that

796
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:34,870
the percentages are a bit high.

797
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,030
Lin Xi, what do you think?

798
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:39,350
It is a bit high,

799
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,630
but it's not that bad either.

800
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:44,060
Okay.

801
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:45,260
I'll tell them.

802
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:16,710
When they sat together

803
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:18,670
and shared food with each other,

804
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:20,510
the old man told the third child,

805
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:22,590
"You were really nice to me.

806
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,990
I want to tell you a secret."

807
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:28,830
The old man pointed to

808
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:31,030
an old and withered tree.

809
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:34,150
The old man said...

810
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:12,870
You're still checking up on Cheng Yao's information?

811
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,390
Didn't he reject you already?

812
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:20,230
It's called knowing yourself and knowing your enemy.

813
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:24,760
The opponent has made his move.

814
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:26,670
I can't just sit and do nothing.

815
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:27,470
Make yourself clear.

816
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:29,830
He's chasing Lin Xi.

817
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:32,480
To be exact,

818
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,030
he has already entered the house.

819
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,030
They're cohabiting already?

820
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:36,070
They're sharing rent.

821
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:38,830
It's rare to see you

822
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:40,230
so full of fighting spirit.

823
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:41,550
That's kind of nice.

824
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:47,500
[User's videos]

825
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,790
This kid is quite interesting.

826
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:50,510
His videos are very vivid.

827
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:54,870
It's just a trick.

828
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:56,910
Seriously.

829
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:58,550
You have no idea.

830
00:43:59,190 --> 00:43:59,870
Let me ask you.

831
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:02,590
Is Lin Xi considered a successful woman?

832
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,530
She's... very outstanding.

833
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:10,730
According to the data analysis

834
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,920
of a foreign relationship guide,

835
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:13,990
successful women

836
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:16,390
are more likely to be attracted to younger men.

837
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:18,300
Younger men are simple and cute.

838
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:19,750
They can give women

839
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,240
simple sweetness.

840
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:24,230
What magazine was that?

841
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:25,990
I have to file a complaint.

842
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:28,180
They clearly didn't do their research before publishing results.

843
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,320
Ridiculous.

844
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:31,590
You've stayed up for so many days.

845
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:32,360
Why are you still up?

846
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:34,550
Look at this.

847
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:36,190
What?
