00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:04,430
As I expected,

4
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:09,350
even though you can't replicate
the full Myriad Blight Formation,

5
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,760
you can still help me

6
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,590
draw power.

7
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,420
But this amount of power
still isn't enough.

8
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,800
I'll take you to the Dragon Cave

9
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,860

your fill of dragon power.

I was worried
the rain might start suddenly,

13
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,540
so I came to bring you an umbrella.

14

It's okay.

You've troubled yourself for me again.

00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:09,710
I've never seen you like this before,
Young Master Fugui,

17
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,680
and I never knew

18
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,800
that you actually knew
how to gather herbs.

Look at this Blood-Breaking Elixir Flower.

26
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,800
If it can fully mature,

27
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,710
it can save the lives of
more humans and demons.

28

29

Why do you ask, Young Master Fugui?

35
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,680
No matter how fine a sword is,

36
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,560
it will bear marks once it's been used.

37

00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:42,440
Uncle Hongye.

345
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,750
Qingtong.

346
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,410
Come with me.

347
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,000
This is ginseng tea.

348
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,860
It’s good for your health.

349
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:24,670
Thank you, Uncle Hongye.

350
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,440
Qingtong.

351
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,640
I used to think that

352
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,710
demons were just demons,

353
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:38,150
incapable of true feelings.

354
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:42,310
But I've learned

355
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,270
everything you've done for Hongye

356
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,920
during this time.

357
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,310
I was wrong.

358
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:56,890
Uncle Hongye, you weren't wrong.

359
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,160
There's no denying it.

360
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:04,640
That day,

361
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:08,030
I allowed them to hurt you.

362
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,790
Your scar should still be there.

363
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,130
I'm not offering you this cup of tea

364
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,720
to seek your forgiveness.

365
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,800
It's a sincere apology
from the bottom of my heart.

366
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:26,070
My scar has long been healed.

367
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,320
Uncle Hongye, you don't need to
worry about it.

368
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,680
Of course,

369
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,980
when it comes to Fugui,

370
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,920
I, as his father,

371
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:42,000
am the one who's truly unforgivable.

372
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,510
Father...

373
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,720
You two,

374
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,000
come with me.

375
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,160
There are

376
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,070
two masks here.

377
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:16,680
I don't know which one you prefer.

378
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:21,350
I personally prefer this one.

379
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,480
Alright.

380
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:34,160
I won't make things difficult for you.

381
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,640
This Jinlan Mask

382
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,960
was made personally by Huaizhu.

383
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,690
To have a true confidant in life

384
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,940
is like finding a sworn sibling,
also called "Jinlan".

385
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,750
Try it on.

386
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:54,960
So of course I prefer this one.

387
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:57,960
I know

388
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,080
you've been mocking my taste

389
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,000
for a long time.

390
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,510
Do you remember?

391
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:17,110
On your birthday,

392
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,200
you put on this mask

393
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:23,960
and asked me

394
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,920
about the story behind it,

395
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,590
and yet I

396
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:33,400
almost strangled you to death.

397
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,400
I want to know why!

398
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,030
Why did you do that?

399
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,480
That Hongye under the mask

400
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,540
is already dead!

401
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,590
He died beyond the circle,

402
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,910
under that black Grief Tree!

403
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,960
Your closest friends and loved ones

404
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,820
dying one by one before your eyes—

405
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,930
do you know what that sight is like?

406
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:01,010
That Hongye underneath the Jinlan Mask

407
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,930
lost because of his emotions.

408
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:05,590
He'll never forgive himself!

409
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:09,310
I won't allow you to follow in
his footsteps!

410
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,350
At that time,

411
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:19,070
you must have thought

412
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,960
that I hated you, right?

413
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,020
So

414
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,680
what did you think

415
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,880
I hated you for?

416
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,590
I thought

417
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:35,790
it was because Mother died because of me

418
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,240
that you hated me, Father.

419
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,550
I don't hate you at all.

420
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,070
When you put on that mask that day,

421
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,310
what I saw

422
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,510
was myself.

423
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,160
The one I wanted to strangle to death

424
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:11,110
was myself.

425
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,310
Because

426
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:26,590
I've never been able to forgive myself.

427
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,400
Why was it that the Mask Group
was nearly wiped out,

428
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,130
Quzhuo returned half-alive,

429
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,170
and yet only I came back unscathed?

430
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:37,110
Why did the crisis of the Yiqi Alliance

431
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:40,070
have to be resolved
at the cost of Huaizhu's life?

432
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,720
Why did the things we,
the older generation,

433
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,030
failed to accomplish

434
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,290
have to be achieved by sacrificing you

435
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:48,720
and putting you through so much pain?

436
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,310
That's why I hate.

437
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,240
I hate myself.

438
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,400
Back then,

439
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:14,240
everyone in our Mask Group

440
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:18,270
had made thorough preparations

441
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:22,410
before trying to break out of the circle.

442
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:25,960
But in the end,

443
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,960
we still lost.

444
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,730
The Black Fox is a master of
manipulating hearts.

445
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:36,920
Kinship, friendship, love—

446
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,750
she turns them all

447
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,080
into her blades.

448
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,310
In the end,

449
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,010
they all met their ruin beyond the circle.

450
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,480
At that time, I thought

451
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,900
it was love and attachment

452
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,930
that brought about our defeat.

453
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,160
Father, all this time,

454
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:12,040
you've made me keep my heart and body
in utter simplicity...

455
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:14,940
Because you feared
I'd be undone by emotions,

456
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,400
the same way you once were.

457
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,110
Fugui.

458
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,969
All I hoped for

459
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,320
was that you would return alive

460
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,620
after fighting the Black Fox
beyond the circle.

461
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,110
I naively thought

462
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,630
that as long as you could come back alive,

463
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,880
I could slowly make up for

464
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,230
everything I owed you.

465
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,070
But reality

466
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:07,030
proved me wrong.

467
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,630
Who in the world could return

468
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:14,890
those 20-some years
you spent in loneliness to you?

469
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:21,840
Why must you bear the burden of

470
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,550
my devotion to the Way, to duty,

471
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:28,800
and to all living beings?

472
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,360
I was wrong.

473
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,920
So very, utterly wrong.

474
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,000
Father...

475
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,190
Is this...

476
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,600
the Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai?

477
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,070
Young Master Fugui

478
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:13,280
has always wanted to visit
the Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai.

479
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,190
I wonder

480
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:18,000
if what I've woven looks anything like it.

481
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:19,320
It does.

482
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:25,280
It looks a lot like it.

483
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:28,920
Father!

484
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,760
Uncle Hongye!

485
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,550
Father.

486
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:32,710
It's...

487
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:33,910
It's nothing.

488
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,150
I'm fine.

489
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:39,920
Fugui.

490
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,110
Come with me

491
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,060
to the Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai,

492
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,590
will you?

493
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,710
Okay.
