00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,000
Young Master Fugui,

5
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,440
you're giving this sword to me?

6
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:19,840
Qingtong,

7
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,630
we each have

8
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,330
our own path to walk.

9
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,150
If fate allows,

10
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,170
we'll meet again.

11
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:27,350
I know

12
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,889
you have things you must do.

13
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:31,870
So do I.

14
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,310
I...

15
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,010
want to become a better version of myself.

16
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,430
Young Master Fugui,

17
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,630
let's say goodbye.

18
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,150
Tomorrow,

19
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,150
go back with me.

20
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,190
Go back where?

21
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,650
The Yiqi Alliance.

22
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,590
It's impossible for me
to take over the Zhang family.

23
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,450
But the Chief might at least let me

24
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,680
spend the rest of my life in comfort

25
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,670
and leisure in the Zhang family.

26
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,410
But what about them?

27
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,120
They don't have a life left to live.

28
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:13,680
Jiu

29
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,180
was a little demon
of the raccoon dog demon clan,

30
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:17,980
900 years old.

31
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,280
Because of its love for food and fun,

32
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,940
it accidentally cultivated
into a great demon.

33
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,870
The Wu couple—

34
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,960
one human and one demon.

35
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,520
They were once locked in a cage
and dunked in water.

36
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,290
The wife, a water-snake demon,

37
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,150
broke off her tail

38
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,960
to help her husband escape.

39
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:50,690
Qiu Hanlin,

40
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,750
a young master from a noble family

41
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,210
and Fuying's benefactor.

42
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,030
Fuying took human form

43
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,690
upon hearing his flute.

44
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,200
And it's not just these demons
I mentioned.

45
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,650
Many humans and demons in the village

46
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,910
don't have a future anymore.

47
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,430
And all of this

48
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,150
was because of me.

49
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,680
Do you still think

50
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,360
I can go back with you?

51
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,040
I understand.

52
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,310
But Zhang Qi,

53
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,430
Yiqi Alliance already knows

54
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,200
what happened in Peach Village.

55
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,390
This is the Ximen family's territory.

56
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:55,650
They won't allow Peach Village to exist.

57
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,670
Even if the Ximen family
doesn't kill them,

58
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,480
they're weak beings

59
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,560
rejected
by both the human and demon realms.

60
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,220
Where could they possibly go?

61
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,070
How can they live?

62
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,600
Tonight as I sit here,

63
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,750
I've cursed myself countless times

64
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,080
for being deceived by Qingli

65
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,920
and causing everyone's death.

66
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,950
How foolish

67
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,040
and unforgivable.

68
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:26,830
But Soldier,

69
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,290
I've always believed
Peach Village was never wrong.

70
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,630
We cultivate,

71
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,230
not to compromise with this chaotic world.

72
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,330
Whether human or demon,

73
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,390
strong or weak,

74
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,850
everyone deserves a home.

75
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,330
Even after all the betrayal

76
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,830
and slander,

77
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,280
you still don't regret it?

78
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,390
Do you know

79
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,159
how I purified the miasma
around Peach Village

80
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,190
back then?

81
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,040
You used miasma-repelling talismans,

82
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,700
linking them into a formation

83
00:06:15,159 --> 00:06:17,360
to keep it outside the village.

84
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,240
That's right.

85
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:21,310
I burned all 12 talismans

86
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,870
that could block the miasma.

87
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,480
Starting tomorrow,

88
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,040
the miasma will once again
shroud Dingling Mountain.

89
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,480
All paths leading to Peach Village

90
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,430
will be cut off.

91
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,360
The Ximen family

92
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,240
will never enter again.

93
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,270
But if so,

94
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,690
Peach Village
will also be covered in miasma.

95
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,800
Come with me.

96
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,240
You wrote this miasma-repelling talisman

97
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,480
with blood,

98
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,600
using this peach tree
as the formation's core

99
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,430
to activate this defense formation.

100
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,800
Since you want to protect Peach Village

101
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,200
and keep outsiders away,

102
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,000
why didn't you use
the 12 bamboo talismans?

103
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,430
There was no time.

104
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,300
The bamboo talismans' spiritual power
is limited.

105
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,500
It took me seven years to weave them into

106
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:45,830
a formation back then.

107
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,960
Without me maintaining it,

108
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,800
once their spiritual power fades,

109
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,600
the Ximen family
will surely enter Peach Village.

110
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,990
And I no longer have another seven years.

111
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,530
Talismans are Yin, and weapons are Yang.

112
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,800
Humans are the weapons
of heaven and earth.

113
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,370
If I offer my own flesh and blood
as a sacrifice,

114
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,680
Peach Village can be preserved forever,

115
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,850
free from the miasma's corrosion.

116
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,500
If you do that,

117
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,159
once the talisman is activated,

118
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
you'll die.

119
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,680
My dream

120
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,930
started here,

121
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,400
so it will also end here.

122
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,950
I won't fail Zhang Qi from back then.

123
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,460
Soldier,

124
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,880
I have no spiritual power left.

125
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,960
Could you please

126
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,280
activate the formation for me?

127
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,200
I know

128
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:24,110
I shouldn't have entrusted this to you,

129
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:27,270
but it's the only way
to protect Peach Village.

130
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,720
Forgive me.

131
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,540
I can only count on you now.

132
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,400
I understood.

133
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,760
You're a Soldier of the Yiqi Alliance.

134
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,630
By helping me
protect Peach Village this time,

135
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:44,210
you'll likely pay a heavy price
in the future.

136
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,870
As you said,

137
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,480
we cultivate,

138
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,910
not to compromise with this chaotic world.

139
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,000
Well then,

140
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,720
thank you.

141
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,510

But I don't think so!

00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,270
Zhang Qi was deceived,

to be the strongest blade
without right or wrong,

265
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:00,830
then what is wrong

266
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:03,040
is the idea of a Soldier itself.

I'm here to discuss with you.

268
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,480
Maybe killing alone

269
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,060
isn't our only option
for dealing with the Demon Realm.

Is Zhang Qi really the only thing

making you waver like this?

272

Father,

273
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,680
this isn't wavering.

274
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,040
It's just that I now understand

275
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,300
what wielding a sword truly means

276
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,160
as a Soldier.

277
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,720
Even under the pressure
of the Blue Sky Assembly's prophecy,

278
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,980
you will still do this?

279
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,880
Then what about me

280
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,920
and Wangquan family?

281
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,580
If Yiqi Alliance has no rules,

282
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:58,450
how will we ever lead others
against the demons?

283

I'll give you another chance.

are enough.

302

absolute loneliness and concentration.

keep him hanging until he does.

00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,070
are you giving up so easily?

341
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,720
I brought good news.

342
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,790
The Soldier

343
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,750
protected Peach Village.

344
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,510
Even heaven stands on my side.

345
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,550
I won't lose.

346
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:23,680
Good.

347
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,350
That's right.

348
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,550
Then let me...

349
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,350
help you.

350
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,200
You finally submitted to me,

351
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,790
Dragon Spine Sword.

352
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,920
It's my time to take the stage!

353
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,720
Masters, you've traveled through the night

354
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:37,160
[Do your best to kill demons.]

355
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,110
and must be exhausted.

356
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:39,200
Shall I arrange for you

357
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,900
to rest at the manor first?

358
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:42,790
The weather is changing,

359
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,800
and you're still thinking about rest, Fei?

360
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,880
It won't come to that.

361
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,430
Elders, please be patient
and wait a little longer.

362
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:54,550
[Elder of Yiqi Alliance,
Master of the Ximen family]

363
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,480
Our Chief

364
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:55,990
has always been fair.

365
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,310
I believe

366
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,830
he'll give you a satisfactory answer.

367
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,180
The Chief has arrived!

368
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,110
Elders,

369
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,350
you came in such force

370
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:26,110
and even brought your disciples—

371
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:27,810
what's the matter?

372
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,880
Chief,

373
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,140
do you really not know?

374
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,630
About the Blue Sky Assembly,

375
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,240
I've already discussed it

376
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,030
with you all,

377
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,790
and we've reached a consensus.

378
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:45,210
The Soldier

379
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,640
will never go astray.

380
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,030
Never go astray.

381
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,290
Then how do you explain

382
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,160
the incident in Peach Village?

383
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,590
That's right.

384
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:00,720
As we all know,

385
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,510
Peach Village in Dingling Mountain

386
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:04,370
is the Ximen family's territory.

387
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,900
But now, it has become a place
where humans and demons coexist.

388
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,510
I also heard that

389
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,720
the evil drug, Chakuwa,

390
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,240
originated from there.

391
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,400
The Soldier

392
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:20,030
actually blocked all paths
leading to Peach Village

393
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,550
to help those demons.

394
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,200
This is nothing less
than a slap in the face

395
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,600
to both the Ximen family
and Yiqi Alliance.

396
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,050
The Soldier's fault

397
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:31,310
was merely a moment of weakness,

398
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:35,090
and I've already punished him
according to our family law.

399
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:35,790
Chief.

400
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,750
Do you really think

401
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,590
a few lashes are enough to cover up

402
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,120
the Soldier's wrongdoing?

403
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,030
Quan Jingting,

404
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,920
why are you here

405
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,320
instead of at the Sword Tomb?

406
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,130
Since entering the Sword Tomb,

407
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,920
I've spent my days

408
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,550
with the ancestors.

409
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:04,830
But recently,

410
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:06,880
a voice

411
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:10,030
has been crying in my ears—

412
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,750
mournful

413
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,590
and sorrowful.

414
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:18,240
That was the voice
of the Wangquan ancestors crying.

415
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,350
They told me that

416
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,750
Yiqi Alliance will face a great calamity,

417
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,200
and that disaster

418
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,250
will come from the Soldier,

419
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,550
Wangquan Fugui.

420
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:29,480
How dare you!

421
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:32,350
What right do you have

422
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,970
to speak against the Soldier?

423
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,060
Under the guidance of the ancestors,

424
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,920
I obtained a peerless sword.

425
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:42,160
This sword

426
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,350
is my right.

427
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,480
What sword?

428
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,920
Nonsense!

429
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,680
Listen.

430
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:16,310
How sorrowful

431
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,750
this wailing sounds.

432
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:23,510
One misstep can lead to eternal regret.

433
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:25,570
Before the Soldier

434
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,110
commits an unforgivable sin,

435
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,240
the ancestors have asked me
to step forward

436
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,680
and uphold justice,

437
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,110
to make him turn back
before it's too late,

438
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:36,240
and to turn the tide.

439
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,750
What a joke.

440
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,160
How could the ancestors

441
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,880
let a man with wolfish ambitions

442
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,920
to take charge?

443
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,550
However ambitious I may be,

444
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:57,110
it's for Yiqi Alliance.

445
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,410
But what about you?

446
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:00,400
Back then,
you insisted on getting out of the circle

447
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,590
and caused the deaths
of so many young masters and elites.

448
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,960
But you gave birth to a Soldier

449
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,830
and now dominates Yiqi Alliance.

450
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,880
Everyone,

451
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:11,110
is the existence of the Soldier

452
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,070
really good

453
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:15,200
for Yiqi Alliance?

454
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,550
In the Peach Village incident,

455
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,550
the Soldier's mindset has changed.

456
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,480
Will the prophecy come true?

457
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:22,760
Everyone,

458
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:25,920
those who spend their days training hawks

459
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:28,870
will one day have their eyes
pecked out by the hawk.

460
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,750
Who hasn't been reckless in youth?

461
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:36,030
Hongye has been in charge of Yiqi Alliance
for many years

462
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,550
and his merits are undeniable.

463
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,110
We're arguing here today

464
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,550
only because we're worried the Soldier

465
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:44,080
will break the circle
and side with our enemy.

466
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,300
This magic tool is called Wuchen.

467
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,750
It can strip away all worldly thoughts

468
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,470
from the Soldier

469
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:53,830
and elevate him

470
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,330
into a merciless,
emotionless, and peerless blade.

471
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,720
Master,

472
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:01,070
he's trying to turn the Young Master

473
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:02,880
into a monster.

474
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,330
As long as I, Wangquan Hongye,
am still in the Yiqi Alliance,

475
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,430
no one can lay a finger on him.

476
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:14,350
I have overseen
Yiqi Alliance's punishments for years

477
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,550
and know the law well.

478
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,240
I understand

479
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,070
the bonds of family.

480
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,740
How about this?

481
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,790
Before sunset tomorrow

482
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,880
I hope the Soldier can mend his mistakes

483
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:32,280
and give us a satisfactory answer.

484
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,590
Otherwise,

485
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,760
don't blame Yiqi Alliance
for being ruthless.

486
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,270
Quan Jingting,

487
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,200
do you think this show of force

488
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,920
can bring down the Soldier?

489
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:36,210
Wangquan Hongye has been
in charge of Yiqi Alliance for years.

490
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:39,030
That's his son with Dongfang Huaizhu.

491
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
His heart

492
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,270
is not truly cold.

493
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,590
He will risk his life to protect his son.

494
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,480
I need another blade

495
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,510
to strike him and his son.

496
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,400
Good.

497
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:57,790
No wonder our Madam chose you.

498
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:01,070
Then I'll give you

499
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:03,550
the blade you want.

500
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:27,810
[Deer Village]

501
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:27,720
Sir,

502
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,400
I'm done looking.

503
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:28,960
How is it?

504
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:29,750
Are you satisfied?

505
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:30,640
It's very good.

506
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,110
Is it enough?

507
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,270
Yes.

508
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:44,450
Thank you, sir.

509
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,550
I have a question.

510
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,720
You're renting

511
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:50,600
two rooms for yourself—

512
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,550
isn't that a bit wasteful?

513
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,440
How about I switch it to a smaller one

514
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,270
so

515
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:58,070
the rent's cheaper?

516
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:58,880
No need.

517
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,740
Thank you, sir.

518
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:02,440
My sister will come in the future.

519
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,260
This big room

520
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,640
is for her.

521
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:07,730
Alright.

522
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,030
But let me remind you.

523
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,200
Don't run around,

524
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:13,840
especially to the east.

525
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,680
Whatever you do, don't go there.

526
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,640
What's wrong with the east?

527
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,350
Three hundred li east of Deer Village
is a city called Qianji City.

528
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:24,200
Its lord

529
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:26,960
is a devil in human skin.

530
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:28,929
They hunt demons everywhere.

531
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:31,440
Male or female,

532
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,510
old or young—

533
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,940
they take them all.

534
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:37,550
Let's not talk about these bad things.

535
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,360
Remember,

536
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,440
don't fall behind on your rent.

537
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,219
Thank you, sir.

538
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,190
I see.

539
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,800
Don't run around.

540
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,630
Okay. Bye, sir.

541
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,760
Sister,

542
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,480
we have a home now.

543
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,510
From now on

544
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,530
we don't have to be afraid.

545
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:04,710
Here.

546
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,440
Have some.

547
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:08,750
Thank you.

548
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:09,590
Here.

549
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:20,840
I know

550
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,480
you just lost your home.

551
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,070
But trust me.

552
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,210
Deer Village

553
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,800
will also be a wonderful place.

554
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:31,360
They are willing to accept everything.

555
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,960
Because my brother is there.

556
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,000
That place

557
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,320
will be your new home.

558
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,340
Thank you, Miss Qingtong.

559
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,900
Thank you, Miss Qingtong.

560
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,110
Great.

561
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:46,280
Eat up.

562
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,600
If your master were still alive,

563
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,230
he'd want you to pull yourself together,

564
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,320
live well,

565
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,630
and write more songs.

566
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:04,810
Here.

567
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,600
Eat something first.

568
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,320
Eat more.

569
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,530
We'll be on the road again soon.

570
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:29,590
Oh no.

571
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,960
Everyone, get up!

572
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,000
Follow me!

573
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:33,800
Hurry!

574
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,150
Hurry up!

575
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:36,920
Keep up!

576
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,530
Hurry up!

577
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:39,030
Hurry!

578
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,230
Hurry!

579
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:53,710
Run straight

580
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,800
along this road!

581
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,800
Catch all the demons.

582
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,800
Don't let a single one get away.

583
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:10,280
You're quite interesting.

584
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:11,550
No wonder

585
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,760
the Soldier took a liking to you.
