[Episode 14]

3
00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:11,759
Look.

4
00:02:12,789 --> 00:02:14,990
What a beautiful fish-shaped lantern.

5
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,259
Before today,

6
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:18,850
I never thought that besides sword skills,

7
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:21,850
I could actually
learn to make fish-shaped lanterns.

8
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,330
Yeah.

9
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,670
In fact, Young Master Fugui,

10
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,400
you've really changed.

11
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,080
At least, you smile more often

12
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,310
now.

13
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,800
I finally found you,

14
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,310
Soldier.

15
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:46,630
Take care.

16
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,470
Are you Quan Rumu,

17
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,520
the man
who's been looking for a dragon demon?

18
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,030
What?

19
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,670
Don't I look like it?

20
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,160
I'm indebted to Mr. Lei
from the Western Regions.

21
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,730
Since he personally asked me to help you,

22
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,660
I'll definitely render aid to you.

23
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,120
However,

24
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,590
you look like a weak scholar.

25
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,170
You don't seem like a friend of Mr. Lei's.

26
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,000
My friend,

27
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,410
you can't judge people

28
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,630
only by their looks.

29
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,780
Take you as an example.

30
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,610
Despite that stubbly beard,

31
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,610
I bet you're a female demon

32
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,410
in disguise of a man
in order to protect yourself.

33
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,480
Members of the All-Hear Sect,
including you,

34
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,840
have profound knowledge.

35
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,000
How can you not know
what I, Quan Rumu, look like?

36
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,430
Now, do I seem like

37
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:45,780
a friend of Mr. Lei's?

38
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,680
Long Weiyun last showed up

39
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,260
in Dingling Mountain.

40
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,310
Then, she disappeared.

41
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,310
No one has seen her ever since.

42
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,920
The right kind of demon power.

43
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,590
It's her.

44
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,310
As a human,

45
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,030
why are you so persistently

46
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,560
looking for a dragon demon?

47
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,770
Thank you for the information.

48
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,680
Goodbye.

49
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,840
Is he really that crazy man
who rose to fame

50
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,240
with a sword strike
in the Western Regions?

51
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,720
How come he's not intimidating at all?

52
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,430
Quan Rumu,

53
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,930
you haven't found Weiyun yet.

54
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,100
No matter what,

55
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,670
you must make it through.

Soldier,

58
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:29,160
how did it feel to have your heart
pierced by 10 thousand swords?

59
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,360
My name is Gukui.

60
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,680
I'm a clone
of Madam Black Fox in the circle.

61
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,240
Madam sent me here

62
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,240
because she feels very sorry
for what happened to you.

63
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:42,310
You've made great contributions
to Yiqi Alliance

64
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,270
only to

65
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,390
end up like this.

66
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,830
Now, demons hate you.

67
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,190
Humans also hate you.

68
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,159
Is it truly worthwhile for you

69
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:54,220
to protect this world of hypocrites?

70
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,480
Why not

71
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,830
join Madam's team?

72
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,860
As long as
you help Madam out of the circle

73
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,920
with an Earth-and-Heaven Strike,

74
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,800
the order of the world will be rebuilt.

75
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,060
When that happens,

76
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,430
Madam and you
will both be the rulers of this world.

77
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,040
All the humans and demons that hate you

78
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,170
will have to submit themselves to you.

79
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,240
This...

80
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:18,310
is what what's truly meant for you,
Wangquan Fugui.

81
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,970
Absorbing hatred
to control someone's mind...

82
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,390
Is this the power of the Black Fox?

83
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,030
Making me leave the mountain

84
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,830
and sowing hatred in my heart...

85
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,040
All that was part of your plan, right?

86
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,070
Why?

87
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,960
Why isn't there hatred
in your heart at all?

88
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,070
You've been slandered,

89
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:43,870
betrayed,

90
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,560
and had your heart pierced
by 10 thousand swords.

91
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,480
Why isn't there resentment in you?

92
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,390
I, Wanggquan Fugui, will never
surrender myself to anyone's control.

93
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,990
Want to get out of the circle?

94
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:54,500
Dream on.

95
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,070
You're not harboring any hatred

96
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,720
because you're not

97
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,630

Sooner or later,

you will take our side.

100
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,630
I'll be waiting for you at the extremity

101
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,510

Young Master Fugui.

104
00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:18,090
It's time to eat.

105
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,160
I spent a long time cooking this porridge.

106
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,120
Young Master Fugui,

107
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,320
eat it while it's hot.

108
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,160
You too.

109
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:28,600
Okay.

Young Master Fugui,

111
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:38,950
from now on,

112
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,750
please stay in the house for repercussion.

113
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,280
Don't go to the brook again.

114
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,600
It's too cold there.

115
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,600
Okay.

116
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,040
I know

117
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,270
you don't want me to see your wounds.

118
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:54,870
As it happens,

119

the house

120

needs to be furnished.

00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,120
I'll go out later,

122

while you heal yourself here.

123
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,600
Oh, right.

124
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,800
I bought this for you at the market.

125
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,780
They said this candy is sweet.

126

are you here
for medical advice or medicine?

130
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,950
Do you have the Reviving Powder?

131
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,160
If not, find some for me.

132
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,560
I'll pay big money for it.

133
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,430
I want it soon.

134
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,970
The Reviving Powder

135
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,840
must be used with caution.

136
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,840
Such a potent drug is usually taken
by those who want to see their families

137
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,150
for one last time
after their meridians have all been broken

138
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,360
on the battlefield.

139
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,750
It could shorten your life.

140
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,670
I need to take it

No need to observe me.

Just get me the medicine.

149
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,600
I'll be waiting for it in the log cabin
on the mountain.

150
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,410
Such powder comes from the Demon Realm.

is what's truly meant for you,

I'm the Black Fox's target.

164

I must restore my power

Young Master Fugui has prepared for this.

Mistress, I suggest

172
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,050
you leave as soon as possible.

173
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:14,150
You think I'd believe your lies?

174
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:17,110
You inferior No.12580.

175
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,550
I'm not inferior.

176
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,290
I have a name now.

177
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,240
It's "Qingtong."

178
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,840
When the Soldier named you that,

179
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,100
had he seen the spider's nest
you were born into?

180
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,750
Had he realized
how much dirty mud and water

181
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,670
you gulped down for survival?

182
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,750
Had he known
how you servilely begged for mercy

183
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,480
when you worked undercover

184
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,630
in Chuanshu?

185
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,630
I didn't servilely beg for mercy.

186
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,840
You're defending the Soldier

187
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,080
only to break free of your lowly station

188
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,320
and to leech off him.

189
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,430
It's not true!

190
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,690
Of course you wouldn't think it that way,

191
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,680
because you're even lying to yourself.

192
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,550
Ask yourself.

193
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,550
If he were just a rustic,

194
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,440
would you risk your life for him?

195
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:24,900
You wouldn't!

196
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:56,440
Qingtong...

197
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,730
You just took a human form not long ago.

198
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,080
I advise you not to act recklessly.

199
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,830
If you dare to stand in my way again,

200
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,000
I'll send you to hell right away!

201
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,150
Even if I have to die here today,

202
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,750
I won't let you get through!

203
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,480
I hate hypocrites most.

204
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,180
After destroying someone else's happiness,

205
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,710
you're here acting like
you're fully devoted to your loved one.

206
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,720
Save your breath.

207
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,410
As long as you step aside

208
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,960
admit you're faking
your affection for the Soldier,

209
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,490
and humbly beg for my mercy,

210
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,000
I'll spare your life.

211
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,010
Young Master Fugui hasn't recovered yet.

212
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,880
I'm afraid he's no match for her.

213
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,510
I must keep her here today,

214
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,410
even at the expense of my life.

215
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:10,000
You're actually attempting to explode
your demon core for the Soldier?

216
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,750
Not a chance!

217
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,790
Young Master Fugui!

218
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,750
Wangquan Fugui,

219
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:31,790
you're indeed severely injured,
and your power is weakened.

220
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:32,550
Very good.

221
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,400
I'll send you to the nether world

222
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:36,800
to meet my late husband!

223
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,070
We're trapped.

224
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,240
What should we do?

225
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,780
Hold your breath and concentrate.

226
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,380
Do as I say and break through.

227
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:02,900
Break!

228
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:33,390
How are you?

229
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,390
I'm fine.

230
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,600
Young Master Fugui,

231
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,530
are you alright?

232
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,360
I'm fine.

233
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,790
How ridiculous.

234
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,480
The mighty Soldier

235
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,440
has actually

236
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,150
reduced himself to protecting
an inferior little demon, a slave.

237
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,320
No.12580,

238
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,030
good for you.

239
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,330
Young Master Fugui!

240
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:58,910
Let me say this again.

241
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,240
Her name is not No.12580.

242
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,400
And she's by no means inferior.

243
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,360
Stop bluffing.

244
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,720
What can you do to me,

245
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,640
given your current condition?

246
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:10,910
Today,

247
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,960
I'll kill her in front of you,

248
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:16,360
so that you can feel the pain
of losing a loved one.

249
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,950
As long as
I have a nice sword in my hands,

250
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,000
nobody can hurt her.

251
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,720
Now that you've left the Wangquan Manor,

252
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,480
how would you get hold of a nice sword?

253
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,320
Can you

254
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,390
create a sword out of thin air?

255
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,010
How is it possible?

256
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,570
Your power is clearly weak.

257
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,600
Why are you still able to
harness the Purest Sun Flame?

258
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,480
Although my power is weak,

259
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,790
I'm still alive.

260
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:12,880
And I'm the Soldier

261
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,080
that you and your fellows fear most!

262
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:20,080
You actually forged a sword
by burning your life for her?

263
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,610
Since you have a death wish,

264
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:23,180
I might as well grant it!

265
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,000
Young Master Fugui!

266
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,570
Yes.

267
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,550
My love,

268
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:01,200
I failed to take revenge

269
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,960
on Wangquan Fugui for you.

270
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,830
I'm coming to meet you
in the nether world now.

271
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,640
Kill me.

272
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,650
When did my father kill your husband?

273
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,350
Your husband's name
isn't on the list of the demons

274
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:20,080
slayed by the Wangquan family.

275
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,160
Years ago, my husband

276
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:25,440
was killed by your father Wangquan Hongye.

277
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,830
I saw it with my own eyes.

278
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,000
After my husband
exploded his own golden core,

279
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:33,590
he lied to me

280
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,240
that he'd survive.

281
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,110
His words turned out to be a fib!

282
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:42,240
I must make the Wangquan family

283
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,030
pay a price!

284
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,540
I have a question.

285
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,550
When a spider senses danger,

286
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,600
would it enter a state
of suspended animation?

287
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,240
So what if it would?

288
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,830
It means that golden-core spider demon

289
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:03,400
would appear to be dead
in the past 20-odd years

290
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,660
after losing all his cultivation power.

291
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,350
Being blinded by hatred,

292
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,480
you certainly wouldn't think of that.

293
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,350
You...

294
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:13,510
You...

295
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,220
You're saying...

296
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,880
my husband is still alive?

297
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:22,030
Fortunately, you didn't throw away

298
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,240
this golden crown.

299
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,200
I'll lift the seal on your husband now.

300
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,730
Then you'll know the truth.

301
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,200
My love...

302
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,720
You punk,

303
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:58,510
I suffered so much because of you!

304
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:08,930
Soldier,

305
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,510
I apologize

306
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:15,170
for all my wrongdoing.

307
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,940
I'm ready to be punished.

308
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,000
Take my life...

309
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,630
as you please, Soldier.

310
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:26,960
I only hope

311
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:29,610
that you can spare my husband's life.

312
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,780
Your life as a demon

313
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,600
shouldn't be restricted to these things.

314
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,380
Your husband just woke up.

315
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,940
Take good care of him.

316
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,930
Live your life to the fullest.

317
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:46,160
You may leave now.

318
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,150
But remember, don't do evil again

319
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,800
in the future.

320
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,720
Soldier,

321
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,750
my husband and I owe you a huge favor.

322
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:04,010
If you ever need help,

323
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,350
just let that little spider...

324
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:11,260
I mean Qingtong,

325
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:15,500
send a message to the Silk Cave.

326
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,560
Qingtong,

327
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,970
your journey with the Soldier

328
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,600
is destined to be rough,

329
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:44,240
but also wonderful.

330
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,920
Anyway,

331
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,260
I wish you all the best.

332
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:05,920
Qingtong.

333
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:10,730
Why did you attempt to
explode your demon core?

334
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,030
I...

335
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,030
If I'm gone

336
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,880
one day,

337
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,510
will you wait for me

338
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,770
just like how Madam Yin

339
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,160
waited for her husband?

is for my cousin—

510
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:02,400
your own sister, Wangquan Zui.

511
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,400
Quan Jingting,

512
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,830
watch your words and actions.

513
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:10,550
My patience

514
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,310
has its limits.

515
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,720
Master,

516
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,790
I was born in the greatest
prestigious family in the world

517
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:22,590
and have always been loyal to it.

518
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,490
Yet Wangquan Hongye banished me
from the family

519
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,110
over a trivial matter,

520
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:29,440
stripped me of my family name,

521
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,500
and exiled me
to the Western Regions.

522
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:33,160
Even so,

523
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:37,510
I've always been defending
the Wangquan family.

524
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:39,310
In life or death,

525
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:41,110
I am a Wangquan.

526
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:42,720
But recently,

527
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,750
during my cultivation in the Sword Tomb,

528
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,000
I finally realized

529
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,470
that if I keep hiding the truth
for the sake of family ties

530
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,750
and self-interest,

531
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,720
the spirits of our heroic ancestors

532
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,310
and the wronged souls who died

533
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,570
will never forgive me.

534
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,640
So I came here today

535
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:02,030
to expose my own kin to uphold justice,

536
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:04,090
and to tell everyone in Yiqi Alliance

537
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:08,150
that the so-called Black Fox
beyond the circle

538
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:10,030
was nothing but a lie

539
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:11,830
fabricated by Wangquan Hongye.

540
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,160
Quan Jingting!

541
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,330
Do you know what you're talking about?

542
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,720
Of course I do.

543
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,310
Over 20 years ago, your father,

544
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:27,200
Wangquan Shouzhuo, lost control
while practicing swordsmanship,

545
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,480
putting Wangquan Manor
on the brink of collapse.

546
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,240
Seeing the family about to fall,

547
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,200
you made up a lie about a Black Fox

548
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,730
beyond the circle
bringing doom to the world.

549
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:35,670
Your purpose

550
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,790
was to make everyone believe you,
obey you,

551
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,880
and fight against an enemy
that never even existed!

552
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,110
Nonsense!

553
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:41,920
Guards!

554
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:42,720
Wangquan Hongye!

555
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,200
Yes!

556
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,930
You want to rule over everything!

557
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:49,050
But there are still people
who see the truth.

558
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,690
You used that lie as bait,

559
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,400
luring the young masters of every family

560
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,720
to follow you beyond the circle
on a dangerous quest,

561
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,580
slaying the so-called Black Fox.

562
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,080
And what was the result?

563
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,550
Look at the names on it.

564
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:04,790
Look.

565
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,880
Look at the names on it!

566
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,510
The young masters and elites
of every prestigious family,

567
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:12,200
and even your own sister,

568
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:13,960
Wangquan Zui,

569
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,610
all died beyond the so-called circle.

570
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,880
Quan Jingting,

571
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:19,590
are you crazy?

572
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:20,750
Zui

573
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,520
was my dearest sister.

574
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,270
Without sacrifice,

575
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:29,250
how could your lie be convincing?

576
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:33,150
Yet my innocent cousin Zui
ended up as nothing

577
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:37,720
more than a pawn in your grand ambition.

578
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,720
Quan Jingting!

579
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,160
Masters,

580
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:00,790
I came here today

581
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,710
not expecting to leave alive.

582
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,830
But can you...

583
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,780
really just stand by and watch him

584
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,880
cover up the truth
and silence those who speak it?

585
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,420
Well...

586
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:15,270
It's...

587
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,160
It's a lie?

588
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,680
What should we do?

589
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,960
How could it be?

590
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,640
There's no Black Fox?

591
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,000
It's all a lie?

592
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:23,160
There's no such thing as a Black Fox?

593
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,360
He's been deceiving us all these years?

594
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,500
Who has seen it?

595
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,920
No one has seen the Black Fox.

596
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,360
Yes.

597
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,110
No one.

598
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,670
The Black Fox doesn't even exist.

599
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:32,190
-He's been deceiving us all these years.
-Hongye's been deceiving us all these years?

600
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:32,920
He lied to us!

601
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:33,760
Masters,

602
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,699
many years ago,

603
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,860
I, Wangquan Hongye, did fail you.

604
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,070
But back then,

605
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,739
my brothers and sisters and I
fought the Black Fox

606
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:42,070
with everything we had,

607
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,360
and they died a heroic death.

608
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,960
Though I survived,

609
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,050
every day since has been agony.

610
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,480
I did my best

611
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:52,150
to take care of you.

612
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:56,030
And now you would let yourselves

613
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:01,150
be swayed by the words
of that despicable man, Quan Jingting?

614
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,440
Your so-called "care"—

615
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,250
is that when the Zhang family
has a talent like Zhang Qi,

616
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:09,980
you sent the Soldier to Peach Village
to have him killed?

617
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,510
Quan Jingting,

618
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,840
watch your tongue!

619
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:15,250
When Master sent the Soldier,

620
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,140
he repeatedly instructed him

621
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,280
to bring Zhang Qi back alive!

622
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,840
But he's dead now.

623
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:23,110
They can say

624
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:26,110
whatever they want.

625
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:27,800
What about you? With all your accusations,

626
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,710
do you even have proof?

627
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,480
Proof?

628
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,510
You want proof?

629
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:32,360
Alright.

630
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,150
Today,

631
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:38,190
I'll show you the proof.

632
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,880
Master Tianmen has arrived!

633
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:54,420
[Tianmen Wenlu,
Descendant of Taoist Tianmen]

634
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,670
I am Tianmen Wenlu,

635
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,530
son of the Taoist Tianmen.

636
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,150
Greetings, everyone.

637
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,960
Tianmen, there's no need for formality.

638
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,760
Let me ask you.

639
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,070
Over 20 years ago,

640
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,030
was it true as the rumor
in the martial world

641
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:06,840
that Wangquan Hongye led a group
across Heavenly Gate,

642
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,670
which your father guarded,

643
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,110
into the so-called world
beyond the circle?

644
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:12,670
Yes.

645
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,300
Eight people went out
and only two returned,

646
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:16,920
leaving

647
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,000
many dead there,

648
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,030
right?

649
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:20,960
Yes.

650
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,020
Over 20 years ago,

651
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,760
did Chief Wangquan claim

652
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,020
that everything he did

653
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,920
was to slay the Black Fox

654
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,440
and bring an end

655
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,640
to the Eternal Night?

656
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,000
No!

657
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:44,850
Before they went beyond the circle,

658
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:46,910
the Chief came to Heavenly Gate,

659
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,150
threatening and bribing my father

660
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:51,410
into setting up a Mind-losing Formation

661
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:54,190
in that so-called world beyond the circle.

662
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,920
That Mind-losing Formation

663
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:58,780
drove the young masters mad,

664
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:00,760
making them turn on and kill each other.

665
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,110
The so-called Black Fox

666
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,390
never existed at all!

667
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,150
It's been so many years.

668
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:11,550
We don't even know
what happened back then.

669
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:12,920
Tianmen,

670
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,960
do you know what you are talking about?

671
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,320
Of course I do.

672
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,480
I have evidence.

673
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,590
This

674
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,530
is a Mind-losing Talisman,

675
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,710
written in blood by the Chief himself

676
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:33,030
over 20 years ago.

677
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,230
There were seven of these talismans
in total.

678
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,280
Together,
they can form the Mind-losing Formation,

679
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,190
which can make people turn against
and kill each other—

680
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,510
but they won't harm

681
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,180
the one who created it.

682
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:47,290
The Mus are masters
of talisman arts.

683
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:50,370
Master Mu, please take a look.

684
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:00,790
This is indeed a Mind-losing Talisman.

685
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,590
Everyone, take a step back.

686
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,890
[Exterminate All Demons]

687
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:30,510
A blood spell

688
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:33,320
only protects its owner.

689
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,050
It truly was written

690
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:37,870
in the Chief's blood.

691
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,320
This is a frame-up!

692
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,670
A frame-up?

693
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,630
If it wasn't his blood,

694
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,110
who would have used it 20 years ago

695
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:45,810
to frame him?

696
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,510
If you weren't the mastermind,

697
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:49,760
why were you the only one who came back?

698
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,670
The Black Fox...

699
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:55,760
Quan Jingting,

700
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,110
you two are in league!

701
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,710
Listen, everyone.

702
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:02,710
Our Chief

703
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,960
is lying again.

704
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:07,630
But today,

705
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:09,990
no one will believe you anymore.

706
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:10,880
You...

707
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,280
are the one full of lies,

708
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:16,070
framing and slandering others!

709
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:16,670
Everyone,

710
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,380
please ask yourselves honestly

711
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:22,940
what kind of man Master truly is

712
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,150
and how much he has done
for Yiqi Alliance over the years.

713
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,950
And what sort of treacherous man

714
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,440
is Quan Jingting?

715
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:46,240
My father, Taoist Tianmen,

716
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,360
was a hero his whole life.

717
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:50,710
Since he was coerced by Wangquan Hongye,

718
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:52,530
he was haunted by his conscience

719
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,360
and died in depression.

720
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,110
Today,

721
00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:00,990
I'll clear my father's name with my blood!

722
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:03,280
Tianmen!

723
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,400
Tianmen Wenlu

724
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,550
proved the truth
of his words with his life!

725
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:12,590
Brothers, let's go!

726
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,320
Fei!

727
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,480
Stop!

728
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:38,280
Quan Jingting,

729
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,320
today it is not that I,
Wangquan Hongye, cannot fight,

730
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,070
but that I cannot bear
to see the people of Yiqi Alliance

731
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,400
slaughter each other.

732
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,110
Tingyun.

733
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:51,760
Master!

734
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,810
Drop your sword!

735
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:09,400
Cousin,

736
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,630
I won't let you die so easily.
