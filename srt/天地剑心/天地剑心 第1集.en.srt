unable to unleash
the Heaven-and-Earth Strike.

176
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,480
I

177
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,900
am nothing but a sword that kills demons.

178
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,480
Wangquan Manor
and the Demon‑Slaying Palanquin

[Wangquan]

[Grand Ambition Soaring to the Heavens]

183
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,070
the Soldier entered the city alone

184
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:46,030
and accomplished it in the time it takes
for a single incense stick to burn.

185
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:46,510
Yet

186
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,060
the Soldier still fell victim to a move.

[Steward of Wangquan Manor, Steward Fei]

188
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,330
The Demon King Huodou was no ordinary foe.

189
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,510
Young Master Fugui only brought
the First-Snow Sword with him this time.

190
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,770
That was already very impressive of him.

[Grand Ambition Soaring to the Heavens]

192
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,860
Being unable to protect yourself

193
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:10,830
shows that your strength
has yet to reach its peak.

194
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,640
You, as a Soldier,

195
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,040
have yet to unleash
the Heaven-and-Earth Strike.

196
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,790
You ought to reflect upon yourself.

197
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:18,830
That maybe true,

198
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,290
but our young master

199
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,880
has never been defeated.

200
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,780
That's only because the enemies he's faced
were never strong enough.

201
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,160
Now,

202

go back to the Cold Pool

203

and work on
strengthening your inner power.

204
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,590
That won't do.

205
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,970
Young Master is still injured,

206
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,240
and the wounds

207
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,480
look poisoned.

208
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,960
He needs to be treated first.

[Soldiers' Residence

with the compound surname Wangquan.

Wangquan Fugui.

215

Being unable to protect yourself

216
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:21,310
shows that your strength
has yet to reach its peak.

217
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,990
I was born of a concubine.

218
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,070
They say my mother possessed
immense spiritual power,

219
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,400
but she exhausted it all

220
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,270
giving birth to me.

221
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,960
I wasn't allowed to leave the house
as a child,

222
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,960
and every day, I had to spend 16 hours
cultivating my martial arts techniques.

223
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,880
When I was 12,

224
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,070
there was no one in the family

225
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,030
who could rival me except for Master.

226
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:55,760
From then on,

227
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,200
I started going to another place

228
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,400
outside the house,

229
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,530
which is the Palanquin.

230
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:06,920
And there was

231
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,580
another thing added to my life

232
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,960
aside from sleeping and cultivating,

233
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,600
which is slaying demons.

234
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,580
It's my destiny to draw my sword
and kill demons.

235

A Soldier is said to be

236
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,740
the sharpest sword of the Yiqi Alliance.

237
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,590

nor warmth.

Of course.

Weaving brocade from demon silk

is a required skill for us little spiders.

Isn't this a costume?

332
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,000
And

00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:18,600
it's the kind
that an old widow would wear.

If you can weave it,

343
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,510
I'll let you go.

344
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,000
Great!

345
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,360
Thank you, Lady Hero.

346
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,320
Lady Hero,

347
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,830
is that

348
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,680
a letter for your senior?

349
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:50,680
Yes.

350
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,960
I write one for him every year,
but he never reads them.

351
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,160
And he never allows anyone to
celebrate his birthday.

352
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,000
But it's okay.

353
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,270
Loving him

354
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,400
is my own business.

355
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,310
I'll keep writing them anyway.

356
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,350
I see.

357
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,820
How about I deliver the letter

358
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,270
for you this year?

359
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,200
My senior

360
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,590
is

361
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,680
a Soldier.

362
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,070
A Soldier?

363
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,310
You said he's a Soldier?

364
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,240
Then...

365
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:21,800
Will a Soldier

366
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,200
kill a poor little spider demon?

367
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:25,880
A poor,

368
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,790
injured little spider demon.

369
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,350
How unlucky.

370
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:03,370
The Soldier didn't notice me, did he?

371
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:07,960
Safe. Good.

372
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,070
Come on, No.12580.

373
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,410
Just drop the letter and leave,

374
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,540
and you'll be safe.

375
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:15,320
Alright.

376
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,350
I can do it.

377
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:19,680
I'm the best little spider of Silk Cave,

378
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,830
No.12580.

379
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,070
Delivering letters is

380
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,440
[To Senior]

381
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,260
a task I can handle effortlessly.

382
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:46,680
I'm so unlucky today.

383
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,270
Soldier?

384
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:01,960
Why

385
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,310
is she here?

386
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,410
There's a barrier in this yard.

387
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,750
How did you get in?

388
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,710
I didn't mean to barge in.

389
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,790
It was Lady Feng.

390
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,110
She gave me a pass

391
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,200
and asked me to deliver you a letter.

392
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,480
Please, Soldier.

393
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,680
Just accept it,

394
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,060
or I'll have to suffer when I get back.

395
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:30,410
[To Senior]

396
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:25,550
Don't go.

397
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,880
At least accept

398
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,400
Lady Feng's letter.

399
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,110
Hey!

400
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,350
I'll definitely die if I go back
like this.

401
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,270
No.12580.

402
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:36,160
The time for life or death has come.

403
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,020
I'll go all out.

404
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,210
[To Senior]

405
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,330
[To Senior]

406
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,190
[To Senior]

407
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:03,340
[To Senior]

408
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:09,480
Get out of here if you don't want to die!

409
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:12,270
Just give it a read! What's the big deal?

410
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:14,080
I'm sorry

411
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,720
for being a little loud,

412
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,440
but I've opened the letter for you.

413
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,310
Lady Feng asked to meet you

414
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,750
by the garden pond
on the night of the 3rd.

415
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,310
The 3rd.

416
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,480
It's tomorrow, you know?

417
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,200
I can read.

418
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,450
Promise me you'll be there.

419
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:27,550
Get out.

420
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:28,640
Got it.

421
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:33,960
What a beautiful sunset.

422
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,050
At this time of year,

423
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,270
the rhododendrons on Mount Baiwu

424
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,830
should be in full bloom.

425
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,830
It's a truly gorgeous sight.

426
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,000
I wonder

427
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:59,320
if I'll ever have the chance

428
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,510
to go back there.

429
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,240
All right.

430
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:03,040
Soldier.

431
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,040
I'm leaving.

432
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,440
Remember to go.

433
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,720
For this date with you, Lady Feng

434
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,310
prepared a really beautiful dress.

435
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,200
You must go.

436
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,350
Promise me, okay?

437
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,030
Bye.

438
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,440
A truly...

439
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,240
A truly gorgeous sight, is it?

440
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,310
Lady Feng.

441
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,480
You've put a bit too much makeup

442
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,270
on your face, don't you think?

443
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,440
It's okay.

444
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:37,640
As long as I like it.

445
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,960
Although I like Senior very much,

446
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,200
I won't change myself

447
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,240
because of him.

448
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,100
I'm the chief female disciple

449
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,710
of Wangquan Manor after all.

450
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:51,680
I'm off.

451
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:58,110
Always being herself.

452
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,480
That's great.

453
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,000
Why is Lady Feng back so soon?

454
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,680
You're back.

455
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,400
Lady Feng.

456
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,110
What happened?

457
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,630
Didn't you go to see your senior?

458
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:19,240
He didn't come.

459
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,830
He sent someone else there

460
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,000
and asked me

461
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,720
to practice my sword properly.

462
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,880
Your senior

463
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,870
has really gone a bit too far.

464
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:29,880
But it's okay.

465
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:31,830
My senior

466
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:35,960
must like someone who's particularly
good at swordsmanship.

467
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,200
I, Feng Tingyun,

468
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,790
will definitely become

469
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,750
the strongest swordsman

470
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,950
in the Yiqi Alliance—strongest of all!

471
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:46,400
I can do it!

472
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,640
I'm sure...

473
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,620
I'm sure...

474
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:52,590
I'm sure I can do it.

475
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,640
Lady Feng,

476
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,640
you're really incredible.

477
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,310
You're not discouraged at all.

478
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,640
Even after he treated you like that,

479
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,100
you're still so positive.

480
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,040
This won't do.

481
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,680
I can't just stand by and do nothing.

482
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,550
Logically speaking,

483
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,400
no one is allowed to touch

484
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:20,960
Master's Jinlan Mask.

485
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,480
But I

486
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,880
didn't see anything.

487
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:26,550
Mr. Fei.

488
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,800
This mask was a gift
from my mother to my father.

489
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,630
Although my mother passed away,

490
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:36,350
my father

491
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,880
has never forgotten her,
even for a moment.

492
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:42,590
How can you tell?

493
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:46,040
My father doesn't allow anyone
to touch this mask,

494
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,300
yet it remains spotless at all times.

495
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,160
So, Young Master,

496
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,070
please understand.

497
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,640
Master

498
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:58,040
isn't truly heartless toward you.

499
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,880
Today is my birthday,

500
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,750
but my father doesn't want to see me.

501
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:20,790
Because my birthday

502
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:25,750
is also the anniversary of mother's death.

503
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,030
Mr. Fei.

504
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,480
Does my father

505
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,440
really hate me?

506
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,310
Young Master,

507
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,640
please don't think that way.

508
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,510
Master just wants you

509
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:52,270
to not waste any time

510
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:55,510
and focus on your cultivation,
so you can unleash

511
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:58,310
the Heaven-and-Earth Strike
as soon as possible.

512
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,000
Mr. Fei.

513
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,160
Yes?

514
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:10,969
I want to know the story behind this mask.

515
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,510
As for Master's past,

516
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,880
I dare not

517
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,449
presume or make assumptions, either.

518
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,440
I see.

519
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:29,370
[In Memory of Beloved Wife
Dongfang Huaizhu]

520
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,190
With the talents of
the Yiqi Alliance perishing

521
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:31,190
and chaos rising in the Demon Realm,

522
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,150
I have a way

523
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:35,110
to turn the current situation around.

524
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:37,970
As long as
a woman of our Dongfang family is willing,

525
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:40,920
she can inherit her spiritual power
to her child.

526
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,960
And with the unique secret method
of the Wangquan family,

527
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,690
the child's innate sword spirit
can be awakened,

528
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,300
and the child will possess

529
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:51,550
the talents of both families.

530
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,400
And that child

531
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,250
will be a Soldier

532
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,560
of the Yiqi Alliance.

533
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,400
What will our child be like?

534
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,760
If it's a boy,

535
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,840
he'll be as kind as you.

536
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:06,920
If it's a girl,

537
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,920
she'll be as smart as you.

538
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,840
What will it take from you then?

539
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,020
Nothing, for the best.

540
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,110
Why?

541
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,590
I think

542
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,880
he'll be like his father,

543
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,850
chasing the endless night,

544
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,290
save all living beings,

545
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
and becoming an unparalleled hero.

546
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,550
Our child

547
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:29,960
will definitely become

548
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:33,160
the strongest swordsman in the world.

549
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:35,360
Huaizhu.

550
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,760
20 years have passed.

551
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,280
Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai
remains unchanged,

552
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,400
yet I

553
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:45,320
have grown old.

554
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,370
All these years,

555
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,410
in order to make Fugui
the strongest Soldier,

556
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,550
I

557
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:15,130
haven't been able to be a good father.

558
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,070
And yet, Fugui

559
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,980
has become more and more like
who I was back then.

560
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,600
That is the last thing I want to see.

561
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,880
Since he wouldn't meet with Lady Feng,

562
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,880
there must be someone
more important he needs to meet.

563
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:18,490
If you were against
a formidable adversary,

564
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:20,150
that brief lapse just now

565
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,750
would have been fatal to you.

566
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,160
Today is Mother's death anniversary.

567
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:28,030
So what?

568
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:30,590
I want to pay my respects to her.

569
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:31,650
Pay your respects?

570
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,670
What your mother's spirit in heaven
asks of you

571
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:37,000
is that you be able to unleash
the Heaven-and-Earth Strike!

572
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,590
Do you know
why you still haven't been able to

573
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:40,790
unleash the Heaven-and-Earth Strike?

574
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:42,940
Bring it on!

575
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,360
Soft-heartedness!

576
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,160
Attachments!

577
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:30,480
Unwillingness!

578
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,540
Those are all emotions

579
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,570
that a Soldier shouldn't have.

580
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,150
The weakness deep within your heart

581
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:48,630
is the reason why you can't unleash
the Heaven-and-Earth Strike!

582
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:49,480
Father, if I

583
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:52,000
treat your life like grass or trees

584
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,960
and kill you with my sword
without hesitation,

585
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:56,840
would you be satisfied?

586
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,110
I want to know why.

587
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:54,920
Wangquan Hongye.

588
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,880
All those tragedies

589
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,880
were caused by you.

590
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,070
You're the one who killed them.

591
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,880
You're the reason

592
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:06,570
why they all died tragic,
unnatural deaths.

593
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,110
Sometimes, the truth can end up

594
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:12,040
harming both others and yourself!

595
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,710
Why did you do that?

596
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,340
That Hongye under the mask

597
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,400
is already dead!

598
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,630
He died outside the circle,

599
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:27,550
under that black Grief Tree!

600
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:29,800
Your closest friends and loved ones

601
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,660
dying one by one before your eyes—

602
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,810
do you know what that sight is like?

603
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,160
That Hongye underneath the Jinlan Mask

604
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:38,890
lost because of his emotions.

605
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:41,360
He'll never forgive himself!

606
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:45,230
I won't allow you to follow in
his footsteps!

607
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:06,400
You should go.
