clashing with the spiritual blood
within you.

59
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,000
You need to expel the dragon power
from your body as soon as possible

why should I abandon it?

the human heart is dark,

Are you truly foolish or just pretending?

116

Let me give you a suggestion.

00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,910
If you can become the strongest ruler,

118
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,510
you'll be able
to control everything yourself.

119

By that time,

120
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,180
even the Black Fox
will have to submit to you.

174
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,080
-Fugui.
-Go, stand over there properly!

175
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,600
Go back!

176
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,000
Stand up!

177
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,360
Go back!

178
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:17,750
Stop!

179
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,790
All of you, go back!

180
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:19,450
Don't move!

181
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,340
Let them go!

182
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,270
How can you be so despotic

183
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,120
and rude?

184
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,030
What exactly do you want?

185
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,190
Young Master,

186
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:42,030
you disbanded Zelan Hall arbitrarily.

187
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,490
When Governor comes back,

188
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,080
how should we explain?

189
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,790
Apart from disbanding Zelan Hall,

190
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,550
I'll also reopen Asura Hall.

191
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:56,550
Jiang Bo.

192
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,990
Bring me the Soul-Devouring Umbrella.

193
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,840
No.

194
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,670
The Soul-Devouring Umbrella can absorb
the spiritual power of humans and demons.

195
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,320
It's been sealed and prohibited
under Governor's order,

196
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,580
never to be used again.

197
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,930
I'll grant those who obey my orders

198
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,790
dragon power to help them cultivate.

199
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,280
Those who disobey...

200
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,360
shall die.

201
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,880
The Soul-Devouring Umbrella?

202
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,620
[Soul-Devouring Umbrella]

203
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,810
It can not only disturb the user's minds,

204
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,790
but also transfer others' life force

205
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:41,830
to the user.

206
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,010
Young Master Fugui,

207
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,070
didn't I say long ago

208
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:49,570
these evil things must never be used?

209
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,130
Why have they been brought out again?

210
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,210
I asked Jiang Bo to bring them.

211
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,200
I've disbanded Zelan Hall

212
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,750
and reopened Asura Hall.

213
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,480
Young Master Fugui!

214
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:11,590
Don't.

215
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,160
Young Master Fugui,

216
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,640
if you use these evil things,

217
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,500
you will surely suffer backlash!

218
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:32,880
Backlash?

219
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:34,750
I have no taboos.

220
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,720
Why would I fear backlash?

221
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,350
Young Master Fugui!

222
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,880
Leave Qianji City quickly!

223
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,800
This place's no longer your Peach Village!

224
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,110
Deliver this demon core

225
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,310
to Young Master.

226
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:09,310
Boss,

227
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,320
do we really have to obey him?

228
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,580
With the Soldier's strength,

229
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,640
is there any room for us to struggle?

230
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,790
Let's survive first.

231
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,720
Fortunately,

232
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,040
this batch of demons is evil.

233
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:26,750
Mm.

234
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,110
Young Master,

235
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,240
according to your order,

236
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,110
I caught a group of evil demons nearby

237
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,070
and threw them into Asura Hall

238
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,730
to absorb their demon powers.

239
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,830
Their demon powers

240
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,160
will eventually transform
into spirit pearls

241
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,240
for your use.

242
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,730
Having their demon powers
absorbed at Asura Hall

243
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,320
must be very painful, right?

244
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:03,910
Young Master,

245
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,670
it's extremely painful.

246
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,550
It's just that this batch of evil demons
has quite strong demon powers.

247
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,920
It will take some time
to separate out their cries of agony

248
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,250
from the spirit pearls.

249
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,510
Someone will surely like

250
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,640
these cries of agony.

251
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,920
There's no need

252
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,630
to separate out these cries.

253
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,210
Yes.

254
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,310
Fan Yunfei,

255
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,960
come to Qianji City at once.

256
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,210
Congratulations, Madam.

257
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,270
Wangquan Fugui

258
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,830
has been completely influenced
by the Power of Hatred within him.

259
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,920
His temperament has changed drastically.

260
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,420
When he breaks the circle,

261
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,480
you can not only break free,

262
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,510
but also obtain a perfect body.

263
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,680
Interesting.

264
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,000
He took another step forward.

265
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,070
I'm very happy.

266
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:27,960
But

267
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,020
this is not enough.

268
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:31,680
I'll give him another push

269
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,030
to completely make him
the incarnation of the Power of Hatred.

270
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,400
Go tell Jiuwei

271
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,400
to find that person.

272
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,550
Make good use of him.

273
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,350
Yes.

274
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:52,530
[Here Lies Quan Rumu]

275
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:42,790
Master,

276
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,300
why have you become like this?

277
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:58,920
I'm fine.

278
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,640
I inhaled some Dragon Qi

279
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,400
when I killed Quan Jingting.

280
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,070
That's good then.

281
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,350
Master.

282
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,590
Your umbrella

283
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:17,350
looks like an evil object.

284
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:24,790
But how could that be?

285
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,280
It must be that I lack knowledge.

286
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,070
Master,

287
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:31,750
I already know

288
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,610
about what happened

289
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,110
to Chief Hongye and Celestial Master.

290
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,440
Master, don't be sad.

291
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,000
You still have me.

292
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:42,680
I'm

293
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,620
willing to fight
against the Black Fox with you.

294
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,160
Poor Dog.

295
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,000
Are you...

296
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,480
indebted to me?

297
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:54,400
Mm.

298
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:56,960
Then today,

299
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,900
I want to take something
as your repayment to me.

300
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,480
Are you willing?

301
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,400
Of course.

302
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,110
Master.

303
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,540
What are you doing?

304
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,440
Master.

305
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:42,510
Why?

306
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,880
Why?

307
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,400
Because I've finally understood

308
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,750
good...

309
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,880
can't triumph over evil.

310
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,230
Because neither you nor I

311
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,960
can be as ruthless

312
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:04,640
as the Black Fox,

313
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,750
destroying gods and Buddhas alike.

314
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,160
I don't believe

315
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:19,170
a single word you said.

316
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:22,830
You can take the Water-Control Orb,

317
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,240
but you must tell me the truth!

318
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,550
Master.

319
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,960
Master!

320
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,350
Master.

321
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,030
Fan Yunfei.

322
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:55,920
Why are you here?

323
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,110
Miss Qingtong.

324
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,260
Young Master Fugui...

325
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,970
took your Water-Control Orb?

326
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,310
Miss Qingtong,

327
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:24,030
why has Master become like this?

328
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,510
You must know the reason.

329
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,270
Tell me, okay?

330
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,090
There's no reason.

331
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,590
It's exactly what you saw.

332
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,350
Yunfei,

333
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,310
don't dwell on why Young Master Fugui

334
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,510
has become like this.

335
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:46,750
If you want to live,

336
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,570
leave this place quickly.

337
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,160
I won't leave.

338
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,830
If Master wants to take everything back

339
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:55,430
and take the Black Fox's Way,

340
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,750
just take my life as well.

341
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,920
Otherwise, I would rather die than leave!

342
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,800
Fan Yunfei!

343
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,680
I told you!

344
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,300
If you want to live,

345
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,440
leave now!

346
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:14,860
