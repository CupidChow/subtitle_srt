tomorrow.

00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,140
You go
attend the skill battles and buy time.

And I

8

will go to the Xiyun Hall to save them.

9
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:21,350
You must hang in there until I come back.

10
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,360
You have to do

11
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,640
what you asked for by yourself.

12
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,500
Here we are.

13
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,490
We've arrived.

do massages?

19

My legs hurt so much.

20
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,610
Could you give me a massage?

21

Huh?

22
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,020
Young Master Fugui doesn't know
how to massage.

23
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,030
But I can do it.

24
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,120
How about

Forget it.

How can you give a nice massage?

29

Y-You're too weak.

30

I don't need it.

31

You must know how

32
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,380

33
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,450
Read my fortune.

I feel like I'm having a tough year,

constantly dealing

Tell me.

38
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,710
What do you want to know?

39
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,840
Is it about your career

40
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,430
or marriage?
Why are you so annoying?

41
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,079
I don't want you to do it.

42

I want him to tell my fortune.

43
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,870
He's blind, typical of fortune-tellers!

44
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,670
Stop arguing.

45

He's not blind.

46

but why did you hit me?

164

It wasn't me.

165

And we'll give you a raise.

166

this is the demon brought here
and locked up by Master Quan, right?

178
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,090
Impossible.

179
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,270
The demons brought by Master Quan

180
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,730
are all locked in the cave.

181
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,390
And the cave

182
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,050
is covered by demon-subduing talismans.

183
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,910
How did he

184
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,240
get out?

185
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,080
These little demons

186
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,630
know sorcery more or less.

187
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,360
You can't underestimate them.

188
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,890
Thank you, miss.

189
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,950
Take him away.

190
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,220
Do not try to run again.

191
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:46,790
Go.

192
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:03,750
Yi.

193
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:04,840
Yi!

194
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,420
Stop slacking off.

195
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,750
You lazybones.

196
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,410
How can you earn your freedom?

197
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:12,790
Work harder.

198
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,810
Follow me to the stage.

199
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,320
Let's welcome the next challenger,

200
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,390
the Cold Jade Sword

201
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,520
from the Shi family,

202
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,200
Shi Tang.

203
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,030
Master,

204
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,640
the Soldier has reached the Xiyun Hall.

205
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:24,080
Mm.

206
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:37,610
Everything unfolded just as you predicted.

207
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,400
A father knows his son the best.

208
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:42,320
Rumu has been friends
with the Soldier since childhood.

209
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,000
He wouldn't hurt his friend

210
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,600
just because I forced him to.

211
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,320
He went to see the Soldier
without telling me.

212
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,630
But I knew it.

213
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,960
I didn't predict the future.

214
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,600
It's just
that human nature is unpredictable.

215
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,440
I just played along.

216
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,480
You lured the Soldier to my Xiyun Hall

217
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,150
and made me deal with him.

218
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:06,210
You also forced Rumu to attend
the Blue Sky Convention.

219
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,120
I suppose

220
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,750
the Soldier isn't

221
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,840
the only one you want to kill,

222
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,000
right?

223
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,960
He's been outshining me
in every aspect since childhood.

224
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,080
Yes,

225
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,910
Rumu might not be able

226
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,320
to kill the Soldier.

227
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,040
But what if the person I want Rumu to kill

228
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,790
is not the Soldier?

229
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,870
Split them up and destroy them separately.

230
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,530
What a good plan
to kill two birds with one stone.

231
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,150
Now it all depends on
whether the demon king you raise

232
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,120
can kill the Soldier.

233
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,360
Just rest assured.

234
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:11,390
Be g-gentle.

235
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,450
You, the one who came in with me,

236
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,790
your plan

237
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,740
is indeed quite smart.

238
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,790
If no one informed us

239
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:29,760
that someone'd definitely come
to rescue the prisoners today,

240
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,870
you'd

241
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,600
pull it off.

242
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,440
The Soldier is here!

243
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,700
Don't let him get away!

244
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,670
Hurry up!

245
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:39,910
Come on! Run!

246
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:40,510
Go!

247
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,120
Young lady,

248
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,630
how dare you, a little demon,

249
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,550
impersonate one of us?

250
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,320
Do you know

251
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,150
who we are?

252
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,840
Do you know

253
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,910
who we are?

254
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,770
You're demons, aren't you?

255
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:11,510
Oh,

256
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,080
young lady,

257
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,240
you know quite a lot.

258
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,750
What if

259
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,730
I'm not a "young lady" as you said?

260
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,860
You want to die?

261
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,610
Little spider?

262
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,630
Don't let her escape!

263
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,320
Kill her!

264
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,750
Who are you?

265
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,400
Be careful, Young Master Fugui.

266
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,000
They are the demon king.

267
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,000
"Young Master Fugui"?

268
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,150
I know only one powerful swordsman

269
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,360
called Fugui.

270
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,720
That is

271
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,720
Wangquan Fugui.

272
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,390
So the target

273
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,720
we're going to kill today

274
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,550
is the Soldier?

275
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,130
Young Master Fugui,

276
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,490
your eyes have really recovered?

277
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,200
Mm-hmm.

278
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,550
Young Master Fugui,

279
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,340
you're exactly the one

280
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,620
I've been waiting for.

281
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:24,480
Although the Musk Demon King is not
the strongest in the Demon Realm,

282
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,550
she excels in clones and poison.

283
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,050
Unless you kill the original,

284
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,910
the clones will never die.

285
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:35,720
This time,

286
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:38,510
there's no way he can survive.

287
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:59,790
And the musk demon's poisonous miasma.

288
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,440
Come on.

289
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,550
It's not only suffocating,

290
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,240
making him unable to control the sword,

291
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,720
but it can also
disturb the Soldier's senses.

292
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,870
In such a chaotic environment,

293
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,070
it's impossible for the Soldier

294
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,750
to find her.

295
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:13,670
Young Master Fugui,

296
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:14,930
this is poisonous fog.

297
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,960
Hold your breath.

298
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:23,349
No matter how strong a swordsman is,

299
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:24,920
he needs to breathe to wield his sword.

300
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,050
How many strikes can you pull off
if you hold your breath?

301
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,310
Soldier,

302
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:32,510
both of you will die in the miasma today!

303
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,590
I got her!

304
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:03,170
Young Master Fugui, are you alright?

305
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,110
Soldier,

306
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,350
it's not that easy to kill me.

307
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,160
As long as the real me is safe,

308
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,550
I will never die.

309
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:12,720
Today,

310
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,430
you're not getting away.

311
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,170
Let me do it!

312
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:15,920
Don't!

313
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,070
Master ordered us

314
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:36,790
to leave no survivors!

315
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:37,510
Kill them!

316
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,280
Let's go.

317
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,680
Thanks to you finding her location,

318
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,880
I was able to kill her.

319
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,070
How did you know

320
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:02,480
where that demon king's real body was?

321
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,050
Young Master Fugui,

322
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,200
actually, when that demon king

323
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,530
dragged me to the stage,

324
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,640
I already found something off about her.

325
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,400
So

326
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,070
I left something

327
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,440
on her.

328
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,720
I tied my gossamer

329
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,270
on her wrist.

330
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,160
Never thought

331
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,410
that would help me find her location.

332
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,480
Young Master Fugui,

333
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,030
I finally managed to help you.

334
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,030
Did I do a good job?

335
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,370
I owe you one.

336
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,000
But next time,
you should run away directly.

337
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,790
I don't want you to risk your life.

338
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,430
If I run away,

339
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:45,030
what about you, Young Master Fugui?

340
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,960
They knew I'd come to the Xiyun Hall
to save people.

341
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,270
They even got their own men killed

342
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,800
just to make sure I die here.

343
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,990
If Quan Jingting made Rumu take the pill

344
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,480
not for killing me,

345
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,750
then who is his target?

346
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,090
This pair of talismans

347
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:22,790
is an upgraded version
of the Demon-Taming Talisman.

348
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,550
I added something else

349
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,210
to the Dragon Tempering Pill.

350
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,240
No.

351
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,680
He's targeting my father this time.

352
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,010
Young Master Fugui,

353
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,810
you should hurry back now.

354
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:43,590
Okay.

355
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,770
I'll go back with my sword.

356
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,290
This is too dangerous.

357
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,850
Take care of yourself.

358
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,840
Don't come to meet me again.

359
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,830
I am Chi Yan.

360
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:01,070
Looking forward to a good match.

361
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:14,790
Rumu,

362
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,550
kill him.

363
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,400
Is Quan Rumu going crazy?

364
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,860
He wants to kill his rival?

365
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,480
Hongye.

366
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,160
He's mad.

367
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:30,920
Go

368
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,450
send someone to take Rumu away.

369
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,480
Uncle,

370
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,400
it's your turn now.

371
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,350
Go down!

372
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,720
Assassin!

373
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:08,840
Hurry!

374
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,090
Protect the Chief.

375
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,960
I've been waiting for you.

376
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,640
Rumu,

377
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,880
I order you

378
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,770
to kill Wangquan Hongye

379
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,200
at all costs.

380
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,200
Rumu!

381
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,930
Why is the Soldier still alive?

382
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,010
Fugui, take the sword!

383
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,110
Rumu!

384
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:58,790
Wake up!

385
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,280
Why is he emitting
such a strong demonic aura?

386
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:02,880
Father,

387
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:05,200
why can't I use the Divine Fire,

388
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,110
although I have
the Dongfang family's bloodline?

389
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,830
Maybe because your mother
had little spiritual power

390
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:13,070
[In Memory of Beloved Wife
Dongfang Huaizhu]

391
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,960
when she gave birth to you.

392
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:12,960
Why do you ask so?

393
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,720
Because I recently found
that all the flames

394
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,980
seem to be afraid of me.

395
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,640
But I can't control them.

396
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,120
The Dongfang Divine Fire

397
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,970
is the mightiest in the world.

398
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,400
Once the Divine Fire blazes,

399
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,350
all evil flees.

400
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:28,510
It's fine if you can't use that fire.

401
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,000
Without it,

402
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,550
your mother wouldn't have died.

403
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,830
Practice your swordplay harder.

404
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:34,760
and keep it pure.

405
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,400
Only in this way

406
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:38,520
can you forge the Heart of Sword

407
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:41,570
and complete the Heaven-and-Earth Strike.

408
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:55,530
The Dongfang Divine Fire is the nemesis
of all evil things.

409
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:56,070
Rumu,

410
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,030
I will keep you safe.

411
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:03,400
This is...

412
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,440
The aura of the Purest Sun Flame!

413
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,880
The Soldier is the Soldiers.

414
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,070
Hang in there.

415
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:19,160
Chief,

416
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:22,000
these people must've taken some evil drug.

417
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,460
It's extremely powerful,

418
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,680
making people lose their minds

419
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,680
and grow stronger

420
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,280
into a fighting machine.

421
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,000
Investigate these assassins' identities.

422
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,960
Their weapons,

423
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,030
clothes, and moves

424
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,050
will all leave some clues.

425
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,040
Understood.

426
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:43,680
Quzhuo,

427
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,340
you're a pro in elixirs and pills.

428
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,370
Come take a look.

429
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:48,200
Okay.

430
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:08,640
You...

431
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,000
Chief,

432
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,270
I'm guilty.

433
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,270
I was eager to win.

434
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,310
To help Rumu win the Blue Sky Convention,

435
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,570
I went to the Xiyun Hall

436
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,720
and bought the so-called elixir

437
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:34,430
that could improve power
from Elder Wangquan.

438
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:35,750
I didn't expect

439
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:38,010
that he'd attempt to kill you ruthlessly

440
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,930
with such a horrendous scheme!

441
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,970
This drug can indeed boost power.

442
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:43,880
Besides,

443
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,510
it's mixed with talismans that can control

444
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:47,750
a person's mind,
like the Demon-Taming Talisman.

445
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:50,160
It can deprive them of all senses,
make them feel no pain,

446
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,200
and turn them into a killing machine.

447
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,350
The master-talisman holder

448
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,610
should be at the scene.

449
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,350
Muhai,

450
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:57,610
go check it out.

451
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,030
Yes.

452
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Why did this thing

453
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:22,280
appear in our Yiqi Alliance again?

454
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,110
Wangquan Hongye,

455
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:28,440
I only sent a small gift into the circle.

456
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,480
Never thought

457
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,070
it could really lead to the infighting
within the Yiqi Alliance

458
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,330
and cause huge losses.

459
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,830
The Yiqi Alliance
that you desperately try to protect

460
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,240
looks pathetic.

461
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:40,240
You had a narrow escape today,

462
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,790
but the show

463
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,440
has just begun.

464
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:45,880
The drug they took

465
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:47,830
is called Chakuwa.

466
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,950
It's worth ten taels of gold.

467
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:54,240
I bought the Dragon Tempering Pill.
It's worth 1,000 taels of gold.

468
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,440
Did you participate in the chaos

469
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,200
caused by Wangquan Shouyi?

470
00:30:59,200 --> 00:30:59,750
No.

471
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,200
I just wanted Rumu to defeat the Soldier

472
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,680
and return to the Wangquan family.

473
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,790
Is that all?

474
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,070
Also,

475
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:17,790
I want to reclaim

476
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,240
my surname, Wangquan.

477
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:23,350
I admit

478
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:25,690
that I was used by Wangquan Shouyi

479
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,140
and almost had Rumu
make a terrible mistake.

480
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,880
If you must punish me,

481
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,880
please sentence me to death.

482
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,240
Rumu and I

483
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:40,840
just won't return to the Western Regions.

484
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,750
Because of Rumu,

485
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,860
I already gave you a chance

486
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,200
over ten years ago.

487
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,270
Then please

488
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,240
forgive Rumu one more time.

489
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,960
To atone for my sins, I'm willing

490
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,610
to enter and guard the Sword Tomb.

491
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,110
You may leave.

492
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:37,240
Quzhuo,

493
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:40,790
send someone to investigate the Xiyun Hall

494
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:42,720
and look for
Wangquan Shouyi's accomplices.

495
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,200
Okay.

496
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:50,040
Lock up Quan Jingting immediately

497
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,400
and escort him to guard the Sword Tomb.

498
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:12,750
Young Master Rumu will be fine

499
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:13,750
after he wakes up.

500
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,240
But,

501
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,570
Soldier, your injuries

502
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,310
should be

503
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,730
paid more attention to.

504
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,740
I got it. You may leave.

505
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:44,490
Hongye,

506
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:49,130
[Auspice from the East]

507
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,070
I've taken care

508
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,750
of both the Soldier and Rumu

509
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:50,410
and got them the best physician
of the Li family.

510
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,200
Now that things have come to this point,

511
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,240
let's cancel

512
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,380
tomorrow's mind battles.

513
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:01,070
When Rumu gets better,

514
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:01,830
we will

515
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,570
immediately return

516
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:04,850
to the Wangquan Manor.

517
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,160
Hongye,

518
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,760
aren't you going to check in on him?

519
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:11,000
Actually, the Soldier

520
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,830
is hurt worse than Rumu.

521
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:21,320
He

522
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,360
has his own way to go.

523
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,560
Spoiling him too much

524
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,000
will only harm him.

525
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:34,190
Young Master Fugui asked me to leave

526
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:36,070
because there was danger
in the Blue Sky Convention.

527
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:38,000
He was afraid
that I'd get dragged into it, too.

528
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,510
I wonder how he's doing right now.

529
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,040
I must go back to take a look.

530
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,010
Come out.

531
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,030
The courtyard

532
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,690
is full of wintersweet trees.

533
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,190
And today,

534
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,590
it happens to be snowing.

535
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,670
Would you like

536
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:07,870
to take a look with me?

537
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:08,920
No.

538
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:11,440

539
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,960

540
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:13,920
so...

541
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:17,440
So boring?

542
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,920
You want me to stay still here

543
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,850
and say thank you

544
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,960
to you?

545
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:22,630
Good idea.

546
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,130
I'm injured.

547
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,410
You stabbed me.

548
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:36,410
After having that little spider,

549
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,280
Fugui,

550
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:40,960
you've become a bit mischievous, I think.

551
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:43,810
Young Master Fugui...

552
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:45,800
Young Master Fugui!

553
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,610
Young Master Fugui.

554
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,110
Are you hurt?

555
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,770
Thank goodness.

556
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,440
Seeing you alright,

557
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,190
I can put my mind at ease.

558
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,630
There's an outsider here.

559
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:02,550
Be quiet.

560
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:13,630
I see.

561
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,030
Young Master Fugui,

562
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:17,710
I know you don't want me back

563
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,820
because you're afraid it's dangerous here.

564
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:22,190
But...

565
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,670
But we've agreed

566
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:27,320
that I'll only leave after I learn a set

567
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,720
of sword moves
to be able to protect myself.

568
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,230
I...

569
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,920
I haven't mastered it yet.

570
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,320
So...

571
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:35,880
So,

572
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,670
I can't leave.

573
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,030
C-Can I stay?

574
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,140
Little spider,

575
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,760
let me tell you another secret.

576
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:47,950
It can make you

577
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:50,030
stay here no matter what.

578
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,230
What secret?

579
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,190
Shut up.

580
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:54,760
No.

581
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:55,920
I must say it.

582
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,590
You could transform into a human,
all thanks to him.

583
00:36:58,590 --> 00:36:59,320
What he did

584
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,480
would shorten his life by ten years.

585
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:03,760
I don't know

586
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,840
why he did that.

587
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,190
Anyway, now we both

588
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:08,190
owe you our lives.

589
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:09,800
As the saying goes,

590
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,800
as long as you are thick-skinned,

591
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,510
you can let go of grudges and gratitude.

592
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:14,190
I'm not

593

As an outsider,

596
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,850
I'm leaving now.

Ten years?

598
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:39,480
But...

599
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,490
Young Master Fugui,

600
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:50,480
why?

601
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:56,160
Because I saw you striving to survive.

602
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,060
I don't want you to be crushed by fate.

603
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,480
But Young Master Fugui,

604
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:04,160
you'd lose ten years of your lifespan!

605
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,810
If it were other creatures,

606
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,740
I would also save them.

607
