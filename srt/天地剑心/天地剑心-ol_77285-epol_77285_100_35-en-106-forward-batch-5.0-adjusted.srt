00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:01,150
You gave me the name of Qingtong

4
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:03,640
and taught me swordsmanship

5
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:06,310
not to be anyone's pet.

6
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,280
You are

7
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,310
no longer who you used to be.

8
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,280
My Lady.

9
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,610
You know what Young Master can do.

10
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,800
We

11
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,150
can't compete with him.

12
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,440
What else did he order you to do,

13
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,870
besides shutting down Zelan Hall?

14
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,120
Young Master ordered us

15
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,460
to catch some demons outside the city

16
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,060
and throw them in Asura Hall.

17
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,870
Fortunately, they are

18
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,360
just evil demons.

19
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,730
Judging from the information,

20
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,240
because Quan Jingting
obtained the Myriad Blight Formation,

21
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,400
he rose again

22
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,750
and killed Young Master Rumu.

23
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,240
Yes.

24
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,560
Young Master killed Quan Jingting
in the Western Regions.

25

According to his 4 sword attendants,

26
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,880
they saw from afar

27
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,580
that the sky was full of
ferocious Dragon Qi.

28
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,680
Young Master may have been

29
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,710
affected by the ferocious Dragon Qi.

30
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,110
That's why he's changed.

31
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,930
The Dragon Qi has entered his body.

32
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,800
Not just that.

33
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,480
Young Master Fugui
once absorbed dragon power,

34
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,700
but it didn't affect him.

Yes, My Lady.

Since Young Master Fugui

has been possessed by Black Fox,

49
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,270
the demon core he absorbed

50
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,040
should be exactly the same

00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,520
as what Qingcheng absorbed.

that many demons are gathering
outside the city.

how painful it was

82
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:37,030
to be pierced by my own father?

If being Quan Jingting's son is my fault,

When he was alive, he told you

he would defeat Black Fox with you

104
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,630
wore a smile.

105

I were not your cousin,

I wouldn't have been possessed
by Black Fox,

The tree seed in my body

143

should be the only way
to break this impasse.

144

If I can refine the tree seed in my body,

what about the one beyond the circle?

146

Can that one be refined as well?

147
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:04,230
You just need to remember:

148
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,860
Love is the lifeline of those
who have the tree seed.

149

They grow for love.

With love,
there's no place they can't reach.

151

If they can turn the threads of love
into a mighty force,

though mountains collapse,
seas surge, and mists enshroud the way,

153

love shall be their blade

00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,240
if I don't leave here,

176
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:17,130
the next one

177
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,310
will be me, right?

178
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,790
How ridiculous.

179
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,960
I remember telling you

180
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,060
that we would journey together

181
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,890
and walk this path side by side.

182
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,450
I know it's useless to say more.

183
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,440
I'm willing to die.

184
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,240
But I will choose

185
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,010
the final destination.

186
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:31,860
Those with the tree seed

187
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,840
hold infinite Power of Love.

188
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,010
For those they love,

189
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,520
they'd give everything they have.

190
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:45,150
Turns out the secret of the tree seed
breaking the impasse

191
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,750
lies in giving up everything

192
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,260
for one's beloved ones.

193
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,610
Young Master Fugui,

194
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,260
thank you.

195
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,530
Thank you
for helping with my transformation

196
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,150
to let me feel

197
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,360
the sweetness

198
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,960
and joy as a human.

199
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:08,550
Thank you

200
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,310
for your warm accompany.

201
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,260
Over the journey,

202
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,660
I've been through countless hardships.

203
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,950
I watched precious emotions

204
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,850
flowing away from my fingertips.

205
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,880
I still remember

206
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:40,610
the pain of losing them.

207
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,020
Now,

208
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:48,310
I don't want to lose any family anymore.

209
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,960
You solved the problem yourself

210
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,400
and saved your brother.

211
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,480
Qingtong,

212
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,310
your efforts weren't in vain.

213
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,770
Well, Young Master Fugui,

214
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,920
shouldn't you

215
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,130
reward me with some candy?

216
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,240
I hope in the next life,

217
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:34,370
I can still have the candy
Young Master Fugui gives me.

218
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,750
Next,

219
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:24,590
I'll weave every view we share on the way

220
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,730
into a tapestry.

221
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,480
Deserts, snow,

222
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,790
mountains, and rivers

223
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,710
will no longer just be dreams.

224
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:34,400
Sure.

225
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,360
We promised to journey together.

226
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:40,920
No matter what happens,

227
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,070
I'll wait for you.

228
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,030
Okay.

229
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,030
It's a deal.

230
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,880
We'll journey together from now on.

231
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,240
Okay.

232
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,080
Turns out, before we knew it,

233
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:01,110
we've walked such a long way.

234
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,590
Unfortunately,

235
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:08,370
I can only accompany you here.

236
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,750
The sunset is beautiful.

237
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:27,760
Your last wish

238
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:29,720
has come true.

239
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:36,750
Yeah.

240
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:41,110
You may not know

241
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,510
how happy it is

242
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:50,400
to watch the sunset with you.

243
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,590
We agreed to journey together.

244
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,750
Unfortunately,

245
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,250
as we walk along,

246
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,760
there's no road ahead anymore.

247
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,590
I still remember

248
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,630
you once asked me

249
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,310
what I planned to do

250
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,400
in the future.

251
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,970
At that time,
I actually wanted to tell you

252
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:34,040
that I hoped you'd always be with me

253
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:40,000
in the future.

254
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,030
I even thought about

255
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,550
taking you free from chains

256
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,250
and running away

257
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,790
to a far-off place.

258
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,480
Just like the goose we saw,

259
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:56,920
from south to north,

260
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,240
we could spend seasons together

261
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,720
and enjoy the world's scenery.

262
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,070
What a pity.

263
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:24,880
The sun sinks.

264
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,410
Birds return to their nest.

265
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,030
And Little Spider

266
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,960
should go where she needs to.

267
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,200
You and I

268
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:49,290
started from Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai

269
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,280
and should end in the same place.

270
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,570
I came with you

271
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,880
to visit Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai,

272
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,590
and I have no regrets

273
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,350
in this life.

274
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,130
Young Master Fugui.

275
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,310
Can I hug you again?

276
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:22,550
But you said

277
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:25,590
I'm no longer

278
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:27,440
who I used to be.

279
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,070
Love that begins

280
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,070
must have an end.

281
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,880
Consider it

282
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,920
an end.

Thank you for what you've done for me.

I'll accept

Madam,

318
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,330
the Soldier killed his little spider

319
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,900
and took the Black Grief Tree in her body.

320
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:01,960
Now,

321
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,370
he's heading to the Heavenly Gate.

322
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,350
Good.

323
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,310
Very good.

324
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,700
Wangquan Fugui,

325
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,440
you're finally willing
to help me break the circle.

326
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,830
Once I'm out of trouble

327
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,200
and take his perfect body,

328
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:17,110
by then, all living beings
in the Six Realms

329
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:19,110
will crawl under my feet.

330
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:25,900
[Heavenly Gate]

331
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,550
Wangquan Fugui,

332
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:09,920
you're here.

333
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,710
You've finally become like me.

334
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,310
You have no emotions,

335
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,920
except for the hatred towards fate.

336
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,330
Guys!

337
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,270
Go to the barrier

338
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,580
and wait for Wangquan Fugui
to break the circle.

339
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,060
He who slays the dragon
becomes the evil dragon.

340
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,280
Senior Fugui.

341
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:39,310
We'd rather die than let you pass today!

342
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,570
Get into formation!

343
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:23,680
Senior Fugui!

344
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,110
No!

345
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:40,600
Not enough.

346
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:41,790
Not enough.

347
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:43,340
Wangquan Fugui,

348
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,440
go ahead.

349
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:46,510
Among 13 moves
of the Heaven-and-Earth Strike,

350
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:48,240
you've just wielded one move.

351
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,880
I'm waiting for you inside.

352
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,380
You're doing the right thing.

353
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,750
Wangquan Fugui,

354
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:15,120
it's about to succeed.

355
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,330
Try a bit harder.

356
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:19,240
My children will help you too.

357
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,110
Guys.

358
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,110
Break the circle!

359
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,510
Come, Wangquan Fugui.

360
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:54,930
Come to me.

361
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,650
I can't wait.

362
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,720
By the vastness of Heaven and Earth,

363
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,070
all within a single sword!

364
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,970
The barrier
of the Third Young Master of Aolai

365
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,210
has been broken.

366
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,400
Master.

367
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:12,670
Master!

368
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,320
Senior Fugui!
