unable to unleash
the Heaven-and-Earth Strike.

176
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,480
I

177
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,900
am nothing but a sword that kills demons.

178
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:42,480
Wangquan Manor
and the Demon‑Slaying Palanquin

[Wangquan]

[Grand Ambition Soaring to the Heavens]

183
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,070
the Soldier entered the city alone

184
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,030
and accomplished it in the time it takes
for a single incense stick to burn.

185
00:18:59,030 --> 00:18:59,510
Yet

186
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,060
the Soldier still fell victim to a move.

[Steward of Wangquan Manor, Steward Fei]

188
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,330
The Demon King Huodou was no ordinary foe.

189
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,510
Young Master Fugui only brought
the First-Snow Sword with him this time.

190
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,770
That was already very impressive of him.

[Grand Ambition Soaring to the Heavens]

192
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,860
Being unable to protect yourself

193
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:23,830
shows that your strength
has yet to reach its peak.

194
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,640
You, as a Soldier,

195
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,040
have yet to unleash
the Heaven-and-Earth Strike.

196
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,790
You ought to reflect upon yourself.

197
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:31,830
That maybe true,

198
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,290
but our young master

199
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,880
has never been defeated.

200
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,780
That's only because the enemies he's faced
were never strong enough.

201
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,160
Now,

202

and work on
strengthening your inner power.

204
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,590
That won't do.

205
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,970
Young Master is still injured,

206
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,240
and the wounds

207
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,480
look poisoned.

208
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,960
He needs to be treated first.

[Soldiers' Residence

with the compound surname Wangquan.

Wangquan Fugui.

215

Being unable to protect yourself

216
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:34,310
shows that your strength
has yet to reach its peak.

217
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,990
I was born of a concubine.

218
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,070
They say my mother possessed
immense spiritual power,

219
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,400
but she exhausted it all

220
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,270
giving birth to me.

221
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,960
I wasn't allowed to leave the house
as a child,

222
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,960
and every day, I had to spend 16 hours
cultivating my martial arts techniques.

223
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,880
When I was 12,

224
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,070
there was no one in the family

225
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,030
who could rival me except for Master.

226
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:08,760
From then on,

227
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,200
I started going to another place

228
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,400
outside the house,

229
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,530
which is the Palanquin.

230
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:19,920
And there was

231
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,580
another thing added to my life

232
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:23,960
aside from sleeping and cultivating,

233
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,600
which is slaying demons.

234
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,580
It's my destiny to draw my sword
and kill demons.

235
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,160
A Soldier is said to be

236
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,740
the sharpest sword of the Yiqi Alliance.

237
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,590

nor warmth.

Of course.

Weaving brocade from demon silk

is a required skill for us little spiders.

Isn't this a costume?

332

And

00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,600
it's the kind
that an old widow would wear.

If you can weave it,

343
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,510
I'll let you go.

344
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,000
Great!

345
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,360
Thank you, Lady Hero.

346
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,320
Lady Hero,

347
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,830
is that

348
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,680
a letter for your senior?

349
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:03,680
Yes.

350
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,960
I write one for him every year,
but he never reads them.

351
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,160
And he never allows anyone to
celebrate his birthday.

352
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,000
But it's okay.

353
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,270
Loving him

354
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,400
is my own business.

355
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,310
I'll keep writing them anyway.

356
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,350
I see.

357
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,820
How about I deliver the letter

358
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,270
for you this year?

359
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,200
My senior

360
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,590
is

361
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,680
a Soldier.

362
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,070
A Soldier?

363
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,310
You said he's a Soldier?

364
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,240
Then...

365
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,800
Will a Soldier

366
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,200
kill a poor little spider demon?

367
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:38,880
A poor,

368
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,790
injured little spider demon.

369
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,350
How unlucky.

370
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:16,370
The Soldier didn't notice me, did he?

371
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:20,960
Safe. Good.

372
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:23,070
Come on, No.12580.

373
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,410
Just drop the letter and leave,

374
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,540
and you'll be safe.

375
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:28,320
Alright.

376
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,350
I can do it.

377
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:32,680
I'm the best little spider of Silk Cave,

378
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:33,830
No.12580.

379
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,070
Delivering letters is

380
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,440
[To Senior]

381
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,260
a task I can handle effortlessly.

382
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:59,680
I'm so unlucky today.

383
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,270
Soldier?

384
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:14,960
Why

385
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,310
is she here?

386
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,410
There's a barrier in this yard.

387
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,750
How did you get in?

388
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,710
I didn't mean to barge in.

389
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,790
It was Lady Feng.

390
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,110
She gave me a pass

391
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,200
and asked me to deliver you a letter.

392
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,480
Please, Soldier.

393
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,680
Just accept it,

394
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,060
or I'll have to suffer when I get back.

395
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:43,410
[To Senior]

396
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,550
Don't go.

397
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,880
At least accept

398
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,400
Lady Feng's letter.

399
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,110
Hey!

400
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:46,350
I'll definitely die if I go back
like this.

401
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,270
No.12580.

402
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:49,160
The time for life or death has come.

403
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,020
I'll go all out.

404
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,210
[To Senior]

405
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,330
[To Senior]

406
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,190
[To Senior]

407
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:16,340
[To Senior]

408
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:22,480
Get out of here if you don't want to die!

409
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:25,270
Just give it a read! What's the big deal?

410
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:27,080
I'm sorry

411
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,720
for being a little loud,

412
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,440
but I've opened the letter for you.

413
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,310
Lady Feng asked to meet you

414
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,750
by the garden pond
on the night of the 3rd.

415
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:35,310
The 3rd.

416
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,480
It's tomorrow, you know?

417
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,200
I can read.

418
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,450
Promise me you'll be there.

419
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:40,550
Get out.

420
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:41,640
Got it.

421
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,960
What a beautiful sunset.

422
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,050
At this time of year,

423
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,270
the rhododendrons on Mount Baiwu

424
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,830
should be in full bloom.

425
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,830
It's a truly gorgeous sight.

426
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,000
I wonder

427
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,320
if I'll ever have the chance

428
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,510
to go back there.

429
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,240
All right.

430
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,040
Soldier.

431
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,040
I'm leaving.

432
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,440
Remember to go.

433
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,720
For this date with you, Lady Feng

434
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,310
prepared a really beautiful dress.

435
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,200
You must go.

436
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,350
Promise me, okay?

437
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,030
Bye.

438
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,440
A truly...

439
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:32,240
A truly gorgeous sight, is it?

440
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,310
Lady Feng.

441
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,480
You've put a bit too much makeup

442
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,270
on your face, don't you think?

443
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,440
It's okay.

444
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,640
As long as I like it.

445
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,960
Although I like Senior very much,

446
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,200
I won't change myself

447
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,240
because of him.

448
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,100
I'm the chief female disciple

449
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,710
of Wangquan Manor after all.

450
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:04,680
I'm off.

451
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:11,110
Always being herself.

452
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,480
That's great.

453
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,000
Why is Lady Feng back so soon?

454
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,680
You're back.

455
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,400
Lady Feng.

456
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,110
What happened?

457
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:29,630
Didn't you go to see your senior?

458
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,240
He didn't come.

459
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,830
He sent someone else there

460
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,000
and asked me

461
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,720
to practice my sword properly.

462
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,880
Your senior

463
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,870
has really gone a bit too far.

464
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:42,880
But it's okay.

465
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:44,830
My senior

466
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:48,960
must like someone who's particularly
good at swordsmanship.

467
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:51,200
I, Feng Tingyun,

468
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,790
will definitely become

469
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,750
the strongest swordsman

470
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,950
in the Yiqi Alliance—strongest of all!

471
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,400
I can do it!

472
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,640
I'm sure...

473
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,620
I'm sure...

474
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,590
I'm sure I can do it.

475
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,640
Lady Feng,

476
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,640
you're really incredible.

477
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,310
You're not discouraged at all.

478
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,640
Even after he treated you like that,

479
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,100
you're still so positive.

480
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,040
This won't do.

481
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,680
I can't just stand by and do nothing.

482
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,550
Logically speaking,

483
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,400
no one is allowed to touch

484
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:33,960
Master's Jinlan Mask.

485
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,480
But I

486
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,880
didn't see anything.

487
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,550
Mr. Fei.

488
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,800
This mask was a gift
from my mother to my father.

489
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,630
Although my mother passed away,

490
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:49,350
my father

491
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,880
has never forgotten her,
even for a moment.

492
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:55,590
How can you tell?

493
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,040
My father doesn't allow anyone
to touch this mask,

494
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,300
yet it remains spotless at all times.

495
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,160
So, Young Master,

496
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,070
please understand.

497
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,640
Master

498
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:11,040
isn't truly heartless toward you.

499
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,880
Today is my birthday,

500
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,750
but my father doesn't want to see me.

501
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:33,790
Because my birthday

502
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,750
is also the anniversary of mother's death.

503
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,030
Mr. Fei.

504
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,480
Does my father

505
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,440
really hate me?

506
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:53,310
Young Master,

507
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,640
please don't think that way.

508
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,510
Master just wants you

509
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:05,270
to not waste any time

510
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,510
and focus on your cultivation,
so you can unleash

511
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:11,310
the Heaven-and-Earth Strike
as soon as possible.

512
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,000
Mr. Fei.

513
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,160
Yes?

514
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,969
I want to know the story behind this mask.

515
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,510
As for Master's past,

516
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,880
I dare not

517
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,449
presume or make assumptions, either.

518
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:40,440
I see.

519
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:42,370
[In Memory of Beloved Wife
Dongfang Huaizhu]

520
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,190
With the talents of
the Yiqi Alliance perishing

521
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:44,190
and chaos rising in the Demon Realm,

522
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:46,150
I have a way

523
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:48,110
to turn the current situation around.

524
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:50,970
As long as
a woman of our Dongfang family is willing,

525
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,920
she can inherit her spiritual power
to her child.

526
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,960
And with the unique secret method
of the Wangquan family,

527
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,690
the child's innate sword spirit
can be awakened,

528
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,300
and the child will possess

529
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:04,550
the talents of both families.

530
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:06,400
And that child

531
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,250
will be a Soldier

532
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,560
of the Yiqi Alliance.

533
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,400
What will our child be like?

534
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,760
If it's a boy,

535
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,840
he'll be as kind as you.

536
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:19,920
If it's a girl,

537
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,920
she'll be as smart as you.

538
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,840
What will it take from you then?

539
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,020
Nothing, for the best.

540
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,110
Why?

541
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,590
I think

542
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,880
he'll be like his father,

543
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,850
chasing the endless night,

544
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,290
save all living beings,

545
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
and becoming an unparalleled hero.

546
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,550
Our child

547
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:42,960
will definitely become

548
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:46,160
the strongest swordsman in the world.

549
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:48,360
Huaizhu.

550
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,760
20 years have passed.

551
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,280
Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai
remains unchanged,

552
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,400
yet I

553
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:58,320
have grown old.

554
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,370
All these years,

555
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,410
in order to make Fugui
the strongest Soldier,

556
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,550
I

557
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:28,130
haven't been able to be a good father.

558
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,070
And yet, Fugui

559
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,980
has become more and more like
who I was back then.

560
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,600
That is the last thing I want to see.

561
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,880
Since he wouldn't meet with Lady Feng,

562
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,880
there must be someone
more important he needs to meet.

563
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:31,490
If you were against
a formidable adversary,

564
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,150
that brief lapse just now

565
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:35,750
would have been fatal to you.

566
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:39,160
Today is Mother's death anniversary.

567
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:41,030
So what?

568
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:43,590
I want to pay my respects to her.

569
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:44,650
Pay your respects?

570
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:46,670
What your mother's spirit in heaven
asks of you

571
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:50,000
is that you be able to unleash
the Heaven-and-Earth Strike!

572
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,590
Do you know
why you still haven't been able to

573
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:53,790
unleash the Heaven-and-Earth Strike?

574
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:55,940
Bring it on!

575
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,360
Soft-heartedness!

576
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,160
Attachments!

577
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:43,480
Unwillingness!

578
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,540
Those are all emotions

579
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,570
that a Soldier shouldn't have.

580
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,150
The weakness deep within your heart

581
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:01,630
is the reason why you can't unleash
the Heaven-and-Earth Strike!

582
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:02,480
Father, if I

583
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:05,000
treat your life like grass or trees

584
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,960
and kill you with my sword
without hesitation,

585
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:09,840
would you be satisfied?

586
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,110
I want to know why.

587
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:07,920
Wangquan Hongye.

588
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,880
All those tragedies

589
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,880
were caused by you.

590
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,070
You're the one who killed them.

591
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,880
You're the reason

592
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:19,570
why they all died tragic,
unnatural deaths.

593
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,110
Sometimes, the truth can end up

594
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:25,040
harming both others and yourself!

595
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,710
Why did you do that?

596
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,340
That Hongye under the mask

597
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,400
is already dead!

598
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,630
He died outside the circle,

599
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:40,550
under that black Grief Tree!

600
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:42,800
Your closest friends and loved ones

601
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,660
dying one by one before your eyes—

602
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,810
do you know what that sight is like?

603
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,160
That Hongye underneath the Jinlan Mask

604
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:51,890
lost because of his emotions.

605
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,360
He'll never forgive himself!

606
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:58,230
I won't allow you to follow in
his footsteps!

607
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:19,400
You should go.
