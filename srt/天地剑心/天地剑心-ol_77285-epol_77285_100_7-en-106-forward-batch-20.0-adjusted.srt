[Sword and Beloved]

2
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:10,460
[Episode 7]

3
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,770
Young Master Fugui,

4
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,980
please rest early.

5
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:23,560
Okay.

6
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,170
[Silk Cave]

7
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,240
This is the only way

8
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,960
to save Young Master Fugui.

9
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,400
It's weird.

10
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,960
Why did I fall asleep here?

11
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,630
Why am I so sleepy today?

12
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,590
You really poisoned him?

13
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:35,630
Yes.

14
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,800
I've used the Seven Bitterness you gave me

15
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,590
on Wangquan Fugui.

16
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,360
The Soldier treats you so well,
yet you poisoned him.

17
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,590
You must

18
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,430
really hate me, right?

19
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,240
I don't.

20
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,040
He's a Soldier, and I'm a demon.

21
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,710
This is my home.

22
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,190
You didn't lie to me?

23
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,470
Your intel network is everywhere.

24
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,079
I dare not lie to you.

25
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,530
At least you're still clear-headed.

26
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,000
I'll trust you this time.

27
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,170
Well, Mistress,

28
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,690
what about my brother?

29
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,150
Can you release him now?

30
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,280
His leg has been reattached.

31
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,190
He's

32
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,240
perfectly safe now.

33
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,600
Thank you, Mistress.

34
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,750
Mistress,

35
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,310
I have another request.

36
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,160
Go ahead.

37
00:04:38,269 --> 00:04:40,130
I was poisoned by that same toxin.

38
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:41,920
Please

39
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,590
give me the antidote.

40
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,630
What do you mean?

41
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,030
How did you get poisoned?

42
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,690
That Soldier is extremely vigilant.

43
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,870
So every time I poisoned him,

44
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,930
I had to try his food first.

45
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,390
You're indeed poisoned.

46
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,360
He actually made you test it?

47
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,750
Humans are all hypocrites.

48
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:21,720
Thank you, Mistress!

49
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,650
What's the rush?

50
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,600
I'll give you the antidote
after I get confirmation

51
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,600
that the Soldier is truly poisoned.

52
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,830
Thank you, Mistress.

53
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,160
I searched the entire Wangquan Manor
and found no trace of Qingtong.

54
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,490
And since this morning,

55
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,430
my qi and blood have been surging,

56
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,360
and my inner power has been draining—

57
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,600
almost depleted.

58
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,040
Where is the little spider?

59
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,800
Come out!

60
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,800
Senior Fugui,

61
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,480
do you know that little spider

62
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,140
was a spy sent by the Silk Cave?

63
00:06:14,159 --> 00:06:16,890
How could your inner power
be draining like this?

64
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,830
Someone poisoned you?

65
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,540
Ordinary poison doesn't work on you.

66
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,000
This is Gu poison.

67
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,190
Who could be so cruel?

68
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,040
It was that little spider, right?

69
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,830
Where is she?

70
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,000
Little spider, come out!

71
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,800
Stop yelling.

72
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:33,930
Qingtong has left.

73
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,560
Qingtong?

74
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,070
You even gave her a name?

75
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,720
Senior Fugui,

76
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:43,560
You and she...

77
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,310
I told you.

78
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,310
She has left.

79
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,240
I thought you were in the dark,

80
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:55,010
but it turns out you knew everything.

81
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,510
I'll have to tell Master.

82
00:06:58,630 --> 00:06:59,430
No.

83
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,520
I'll deal with the poison

84
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,630
in my body.

85
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,250
Then why didn't you let me tell Master?

86
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,380
She harmed you so much,

87
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,250
and you still want to protect her?

88
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,930
This is my business.

89
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,210
I'll take care of it myself.

90
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,120
You bastard.

91
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,630
Today is your death anniversary.

92
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,270
Back then,

93
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,950
you built the Silk Cave

94
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,260
to create the top intelligence network
in the Demon Realm.

95
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,600
So I followed your dying instructions

96
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,710
and have always protected the Silk Cave

97
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,070
you left behind well.

98
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,680
Back then,

99
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,159
you forcibly recruited people

100
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,490
to build this Silk Cave for my sake.

101
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,510
Wangquan Hongye

102
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,310
came to Mount Baiwu with his men

103
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,320
to hold you accountable.

104
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,750
It was the human race who started it,

105
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,750
yet they forced you
to destroy your own inner core

106
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,310
to stop the war.

107
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,950
But they promised

108
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,220
to only destroy your cultivation

109
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:34,770
and spare your body
so you could rebuild your cultivation.

110
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:37,930
And they sealed you

111
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,600
inside this golden crown.

112
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,690
Who would have known

113
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,000
that very night,

114
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,430
you would meet your end?

115
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,120
Good and evil always
come with consequences. I accept that.

116
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,200
I accept that!

117
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,440
But
they shouldn't have deceived me like that—

118
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,150
giving me hope

119
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,440
and then crushing it completely.

120
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,200
The Wangquan family

121
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:24,630
must

122
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,720
pay the price!

123
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,080
I want you—

124
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,120
Wangquan Hongye—

125
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,120
taste the pain

126
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,030
of losing your loved ones.

127
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,420
Master,

128
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:03,800
it's time to eat.

129
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,670
I've fallen to such a state,

130
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,600
yet you still serve me as you used to.

131
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,550
Sit.

132
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,250
Have a drink with me.

133
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:27,600
Lu,

134
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,790
when did you start working for me?

135
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,650
It was after you

136
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,350
went to the Western Regions,

137
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,480
at the screen wall of your residence.

138
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,270
Screen wall?

139
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,240
That half‑collapsed wall

140
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,540
buried in weeds?
You call that a screen wall?

141
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,510
I remember it clearly.

142
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,320
When I first arrived,

143
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,890
the whole residence was desolate.

144
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,720
There was only one bed

145
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,780
with 4 intact legs.

146
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,510
All the servants

147
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,370
were old, weak, ill, or disabled.

148
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,750
None of the disciples

149
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,360
listened to me.

150
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,790
Most of them were disciples

151
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,050
the Yiqi Alliance sent

152
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,480
to the Western Regions,

153
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,350
and all they wanted back then

154
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,710
was to embarrass you.

155
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,390
Do you know

156
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,240
why I chose you to be my attendant?

157
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,510
You're just a servant's son.

158
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,030
Yes.

159
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,320
You once said

160
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,440
I had the same

161
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,710
ambitious look in my eyes as you.

162
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:24,960
Yes.

163
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,390
Ambitious.

164
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,480
I was born in troubled times.

165
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,730
I want to be the one holding the knife,

166
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,170
not the meat on the chopping block.

167
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,980
Even back in the Western Regions,

168
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,030
I thought the same.

169
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,870
Without the Wangquan family name,

170
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,480
I still have my sword.

171
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,480
I can always fight my way out!

172
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:04,080
When the disciples didn't listen,

173
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,790
I killed some to warn others.

174
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,150
Demons ran rampant
across the Western Regions.

175
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:10,080
That was my chance to prove myself.

176
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,760
I was tougher than anyone else,

177
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,550
and I refused to lose.

178
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,960
But the result...

179
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,080
What was the result?

180
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,910
They set you up

181
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,390
and lured you
into the dragon demon's trap.

182
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,550
You almost died;

183
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,480
I was the one who carried you back.

184
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,320
I almost died...

185
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:38,550
In the ruined house
of the master of the Quan family,

186
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:40,550
they...

187
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,790
were all waiting for me to die.

188
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,840
He won't be able to make it this time.

189
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,200
This lunatic

190
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,600
who doesn't even care about his own child.

191
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,000
Heaven is punishing him.

192
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,600
Get lost!

193
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:05,870
Let's go.

194
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,550
I can't die.

195
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,390
I, Wangquan Jingting,

196
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,150
will not die...

197
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,080
in this godforsaken place.

198
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:36,230
Someone as vicious as you

199
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:38,840
would even frighten

200
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,360
the King of Hell.

201
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,020
Who are you?

202
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,910
Who the hell are you?

203
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:48,790
Come out!

204
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,720
I'll kill you!

205
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:10,420
[Taisui, a little black fox]

206
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,670
Wangquan Jingting,

207
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,080
your talent is mediocre.

208
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,200
How can you compare to Wangquan Hongye?

209
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,030
Talent?

210
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,600
Is talent everything?

211
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,120
I have something they don't!

212
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:27,080
What is that?

213
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,480
The willingness to sacrifice.

214
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,200
To become the strongest,

215
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,670
you'd give up everything—

216
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,630
conscience, love, family, right?

217
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,630
Am I right?

218
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,240
You hate him, don't you?

219
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,390
How about I take revenge for you?

220
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,120
Are you willing to give up everything

221
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,960
to follow our Madam?

222
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,510
The Black Fox Madam?

223
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,390
You do have some knowledge and courage.

224
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,120
The Madam said

225
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,720
you won't die,

226
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,930
and that she'll even give you
a great gift.

227
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,390
Wha-what gift?

228
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,550
Do you know the greatest secret

229
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,750
in the Western Regions?

230
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,790
The True Dragon Power.

231
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,030
That day,

232
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,720
she not only gave me power,

233
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,670
but also told me that

234
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,440
to obtain the True Dragon Power,

235
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,750
I must acquire a dragon scale,

236
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,550
a dragon spine, and a dragon core

237
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,600
that possess it.

238
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,390
So that's why

239
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,960
you were fighting the dragon clan
in the Western Regions?

240
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,270
What did you get?

241
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:54,480
The dragon clan has long declined.

242
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,720
Those with True Dragon Power

243
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,670
are extremely rare.

244
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,670
After years of searching,

245
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,840
I only obtained

246
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,580
a reverse dragon scale

247
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:13,150
and fused it into my arm.

248
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:16,840
Congratulations

249
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,370
on achieving it in one step.

250
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,720
I thought

251
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,720
I was sure to win.

252
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,990
But for the other two things,

253
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,140
I searched desperately for years

254
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,700
and finally got a piece of intelligence.

255
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,670
It says

256
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,910
the Wangquan family ancestors

257
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,960
had actually slain a true dragon

258
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,060
and forged a sword with its spine.

259
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:45,000
But the sword's murderous energy
was too strong,

260
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,030
so they sealed it

261
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,080
in the Sword Tomb.

262
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,080
That's why

263
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,510
you returned to the Wangquan family

264
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,080
under the pretext
of the Blue Sky Conference?

265
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,820
I was fully prepared.

266
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,030
If I won,

267
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,560
I would take the Sword Tomb;

268
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:11,320
if I lost,

269
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,000
I would guard it.

270
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,330
I was sure to win.

271
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,990
But that Soldier

272
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,380
actually destroyed my cultivation.

273
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:26,680
Wangquan Hongye,

274
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,000
Wangquan Fugui,

275
00:17:29,829 --> 00:17:30,680
you both

276
00:17:31,069 --> 00:17:32,829
must die!

277
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,680
This is Gu poison.

278
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,750
Who could be so cruel?

279
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:04,720
There are hundreds of spiders
in the Silk Cave.

280
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,720
We're all as worthless as weeds.

281
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,180
If I go back empty-handed,

282
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,470
I'll definitely die.

283
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,730
Do you really think

284
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,720
the Spiritual Stone's prophecy
won't come true?

285
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,270
I forgot to give you
a birthday gift yesterday.

286
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,400
This chrysanthemum

287
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,130
is for you, Young Master Fugui.

288
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,400
Wangquan Manor
and that Palanquin...

289
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,440
are your entire world.

290
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,900
Also, nobody knows

291
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,240
what you really want, Young Master Fugui.

292
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,920
You long to see the scenery outside

293
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,720
and to get out of that Palanquin.

294
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,850
I want to stay to repay your kindness.

295
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,350
I'll be your little spider

296
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,480
in life and in death.

297
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,130
Soft-heartedness!

298
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,070
Attachments!

299
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,480
Unwillingness!

300
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:44,990
Those are all emotions

301
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,920
that a Soldier shouldn't have.

302
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:48,960
The weakness deep within your heart

303
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,620
is the reason why you can't unleash
the Heaven-and-Earth Strike!

304
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,350
This Seven Bitterness poison
really is vicious.

305
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,550
It seems I can't remove it

306
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,590
by myself.

307
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,800
Only when one's heart is free of dust

308
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,000
can they see clearly.

309
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:14,920
Young Master Fugui,

310
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:17,830
though I'm a tiny low-grade spider demon,

311
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:18,510
I still

312
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,590
care about certain things

313
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,360
and certain people.

314
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,400
Can you help me save my brother?

315
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,680
I'm begging you.

316
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,630
Please, Young Master Fugui.

317
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,550
Truth can't be faked.

318
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,750
Qingtong must have been threatened
by Madam Yin

319
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,920
to poison me.

320
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
You did a good job.

321
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,830
The Soldier is truly poisoned.

322
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,760
It was your brilliant planning.

323
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:49,920
Your eyes are red.

324
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,710
Do you feel sorry for him?

325
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:54,830
Mistress,

326
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,350
I don't.

327
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,350
There's nothing wrong

328
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,080
with loyalty and devotion.

329
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,040
But you gave your heart
to the wrong person.

330
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,880
The Soldier is a bloodthirsty sword.

331
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,750
If you fall for him,

332
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,160
you'll surely die.

333
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,750
Since I, No.12580,

334
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,730
have completed my task,

335
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,700
can you give me the antidote
you promised me?

336
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,790
This is the only antidote

337
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,560
for the Seven Bitterness

338
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,960
in the entire world.

339
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,800
Remember to use your demon power
to absorb it as soon as possible.

340
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,470
Thank you, Mistress.

341
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,240
I will never forget

342
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,350
your great kindness.

343
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,610
What about my brother?

344
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,480
Since I said I'd spare him,

345
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,790
I will.

346
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:51,160
As for when

347
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,720
and how—

348
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,030
that's up to me.

349
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,350
If you're willing

350
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,580
to send my brother away,

351
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,830
I'm willing to stay

352
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,550
and serve you for life.

353
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,300
You are so capable.

354
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,250
Even the Soldier was manipulated by you.

355
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,350
How do I know you are sincere with me?

356
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,570
I, No.12580,

357
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:23,640
vow to serve you faithfully for life,
Mistress.

358
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,310
Good!

359
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,960
Then stay here in the Silk Cave

360
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,630
and keep me company forever.

361
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:38,000
Take her to see No.12581.

362
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,550
Soldier,

363
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,310
your death is near.

364
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,200
Let's go to Mount Baiwu.

365
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,850
Young Master,
we weren't informed of this mission.

366
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:03,480
Young Master,
should we report to the Master first?

367
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,480
Let's go to Mount Baiwu.

368
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:08,490
Yes.

369
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,790
This is...

370
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:49,710
♪ It was you who opened the world,
the times transparent ♪

371
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,710
♪ At sunrise, I open my eyes;

372
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,240
Young Master Fugui.

373
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:58,130
Your world
won't just be the Demon‑Slaying Palanquin,

374
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,960
and it will never be all darkness.

375

♪ If the light shines through the night ♪

376

will shine with countless stars,

378
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,290

♪ We never ask if fate is fair ♪

381
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,270
I...

382
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,810
can't just stand by and watch her die.

383
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:36,960
Sister.

384
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,880
Sister, you're finally awake.

385
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,880
You've been in a coma for a long time.

386
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,720
No.12581?

387
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,720
It's great to see you!

388
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,440
Turn around.

389
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,840
Let me take a look at you.

390
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,430
I'm fine, Sister.

391
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,880
Don't worry about me.

392
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,110
No.12581,

393
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,160
it must hurt, right?

394
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,880
I'm really fine.

395
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,480
You must be in pain too.

396
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:07,830
I'm fine.

397
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,720
As long as Qingcheng is fine.

398
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,400
What does

399
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,640
Qingcheng mean?

400
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,030
Remember,

401
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:20,030
from now on, this is your name.

402
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,160
In the world outside the cave,

403
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,480
everyone has a name.

404
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,520
I have one too.

405
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,270
My name is Qingtong.

406
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,240
A very good person

407
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,880
give me this name.

408
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:32,960
Okay.

409
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,830
I see.

410
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,110
Oh, right.

411
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,560
They said you were poisoned.

412
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,310
Mistress has given you the antidote.

413
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,590
Have you taken it?

414
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:42,920
No hurry.

415
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,510
Qingcheng.

416
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:45,960
Yes?

417
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,240
Are you ready

418
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,200
to leave here with me?

419
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:50,640
Leave here?

420
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,960
How?

421
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,310
I can take human form.

422
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,270
A human used a winged spirit pearl
to convert

423
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:02,920
his spiritual power into demon power
and gave it to me.

424
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,110
Now I'll give you

425
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,030
half of it.

426
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,510
Mistress,

427
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,240
we just discovered that No.12580

428
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,700
ran away with her brother.

429
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,550
What?

430
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,000
Ran away?

431
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,240
No.12580, you bitch!

432
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,970
There's one more thing.

433
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,640
The Soldier is on his way to Mount Baiwu.

434
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,270
Where are they heading?

435
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,550
It seems they're coming

436
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:41,070
toward our Silk Cave.

437
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:43,550
The Soldier came suddenly this time,

438
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:46,130
but he's already deeply poisoned

439
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,480
and no longer a threat.

440
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:48,920
Mistress,

441
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,530
shall we send people to hunt down No.12580

442
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,680
and No.12580?

443
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,410
Compared
with my blood feud against the Soldier,

444
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:57,960
they are nothing.

445
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,550
Forget her.

446
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,680
Round up everyone in Silk Cave
who can fight

447
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,880
and have them come with me

448
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,010
to kill the Soldier.

449
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,590
Yes.

450
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,360
Up ahead is Mount Baiwu.

451
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,210
Soldier, why did you come here?

452
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,270
Step back.

453
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:24,790
Well...

454
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,640
Yes.

455
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,550
Yes.

456
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,000
Come out!

457
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:48,350
You truly are a Soldier.

458
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,830
You are poisoned and still so arrogant.

459
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,680
Where is No.12580?

460
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,410
I have something to ask her.

461
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,510
As expected, whether human or demon,

462
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,680
no one can escape love.

463
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,530
Why are you looking for her?

464
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:08,070
That ungrateful bitch

465
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,750
has run off with her brother.

466
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,440
Are you saying

467
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:15,790
she and her brother have escaped?

468
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:19,880
Yes.

469
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,000
Soldiers,

470
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,380
does it hurt in your heart?

471
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:30,830
How does betrayal feel?

472
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,240
This little pain,

473
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:37,120
compared to my pain for losing my husband,

474
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:40,030
is nothing!

475
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,030
Today,

476
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:45,030
I will avenge my deceased husband.

477
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,790
Go!

478
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,160
Kill him.

479
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,510
Why?

480
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,550
You're poisoned.

481
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,760
Why can you still use your sword?

482
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:18,680
I am poisoned,

483
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:23,070
but I'm still more than capable
of dealing with you.

484
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,550
Anyone who doesn't want to die,

485
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:25,480
stand up!

486
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,030
Kill him!

487
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,590
What should we do?

488
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:30,000
He's a Soldier.

489
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,910
No one survives Wangquan Sword.

490
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,640
We'll die if we go.

491
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,040
We'll die too if we don't.

492
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,560
You're asking for death!

493
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,510
Soldier, save us!

494
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:48,830
Please!

495
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:50,270
Save us!

496
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,110
We were forced.

497
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,830
We don't want to die!

498
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,660
This seal has been lifted.

499
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,220
Whether you stay or go,

500
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,750
it's up to you.

501
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,070
Let's go!

502
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:22,960
This is...

503
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,340
the spiritual power
of the Dongfang family?

504
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:30,510
Now it's just you.

505
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,350
Don't bother the little spider anymore,

506
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,000
or...

507
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,930
you'll face the consequences.

508
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:42,880
Soldier,

509
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:45,150
this time I underestimated you.

510
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,310
Next time,

511
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:48,680
I will make the Wangquan family

512
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,720
pay.

513
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:13,410
Qingcheng.

514
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:14,690
Qingcheng!

515
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:17,940
Qing...

516
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:37,590
Sister.

517
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,660
[Qingcheng,
a spider demon in the Silk Cave]

518
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:44,200
Come here.

519
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,520
Come here.

520
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:48,920
Sister.

521
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,510
Our Qingcheng looks so handsome

522
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:52,400
in human form.

523
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:55,910
By the way,

524
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,640
this is for you.

525
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,650
All these years,

526
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,070
I've secretly collected many gems.

527
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,440
They're all here.

528
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,440
Keep it safe.

529
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,840
Sister, you're amazing.

530
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,030
Listen to me.

531
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:09,270
Later,

532
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:11,510
just go straight along that road.

533
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,000
Then you'll see a village.

534
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,400
It's Deer Village,
home of the deer demons.

535
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,110
They're not hostile to outsiders.

536
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,320
Give them

537
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,650
half of these gems.

538
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Use the other half

539
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,160
to buy some good food.

540
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:22,480
Okay.

541
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,640
Replenish your strength.

542
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,440
Got it?

543
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,220
Are you coming with me?

544
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,030
I...

545
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,050
have something else to do.

546
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,270
Once I'm done,

547
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,330
I'll go find you.

548
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,930
Sister, what else do you need to do?

549
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,640
By the way, where is the antidote?

550
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,440
Haven't you taken the antidote?

551
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:42,400
I...

552
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,480
Are you going to give the antidote
to the Soldier?

553
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,160
No.

554
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,110
Have you forgotten

555
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:52,960
how the people of the Yiqi Alliance

556
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,350
used to abuse us for fun?

557
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,480
They all deserve to die!

558
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,140
Qingcheng.

559
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,550
There are good and bad demons.

560
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:58,720
Humans are the same.

561
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,750
If the Soldier
hadn't passed his spiritual power to me,

562
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:02,720
how could the two of us

563
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,110
have taken human form?

564
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,680
If you give the antidote to the Soldier,

565
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,010
what will happen to you?

566
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:12,790
You promised me

567
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,680
you'd stay with me.

568
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,440
Qingcheng, listen to me.

569
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,680
Go to Deer Village now.

570
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,610
It's safe there.

571
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,000
Hurry up. Go!

572
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:25,000
I won't leave if you don't come.

573
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:32,960
Qingcheng,

574
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,720
promise me,

575
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:43,030
you must take good care of yourself.

576
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:48,750
Sister!

577
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,160
Young Master Fugui,

578
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,750
wait for me.

579
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:54,960
[Wangquan]

580
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,680
You demon,

581
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,180
how dare you come back?

582
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,240
Lady Feng.

583
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,640
Who's your Lady Feng?

584
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:10,270
Although Senior Fugui
has been covering for you

585
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:12,110
and denying that he was poisoned,

586
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,590
I'm not an idiot.

587
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,030
You must have something to do

588
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,840
with him being poisoned.

589
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,240
Lady Feng,

590
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:20,350
I'll explain

591
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,570
everything to you.

592
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,550
Look.

593
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,000
This is the antidote
for Young Master Fugui.

594
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,230
I came to deliver it.

595
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:29,960
Look.

596
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,219
You still dare to harm him?

597
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,070
Lady Feng,

598
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,960
this really is the antidote.

599
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:50,030
Lady Feng!

600
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,750
I'm sorry, Lady Feng.

601
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:14,510
Senior Feng,
how did this demon get in here?

602
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:15,360
Cut the crap.

603
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,550
Use the talisman!

604
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,090
You still won't give up?

605
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:39,070
Even if I have to die here today,

606
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,730
I must give this antidote
to Young Master Fugui.

607
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,490
Young Master Fugui...

Please, trust me.

She hurt you so much.

619

Why are you still protecting her?

620
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:36,510
I will

621
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,090
handle this myself.

622

Aren't you afraid I'll tell Master?

623
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,150
She has her reasons we don't know about.

624
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,410
I have to ask her first.

625
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:47,880
I don't care.

626
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,150
I will tell Master.

why?

Humans and demons have different paths.

632
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:35,750
Why are you so protective
of that spider demon?

633
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,800
Senior Fugui,

634
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,510

Just some minor injuries.

643

Anyway,

644

we spiders are ugly to begin with.

Madam Yin threatened you
with your brother.

647

That's why you poisoned me.

Yes.

Why didn't you tell me?

Because...

654
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:57,710
Because Madam Yin threatened

The gu has fully formed.

695
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,920
It's the right time to expel it.

696
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,510
But...

697
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,030
But your qi and blood

698
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:38,960
are in turmoil.

699
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:41,000
So you need my help.

700
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,240
That's right.

701
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,680
Seal my spiritual veins.

702
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:52,540
Rumu!

703
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:08,630
Again!

704
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,550
A sword forged to vanquish evil

705
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:43,080
has somehow gained warmth?

706
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,030
Wangquan Fugui has actually

707
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:49,280
fallen for a lowly little demon.

708
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,630
Once a person develops feelings,
they gain weaknesses.

709
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:55,360
How are my clones
inside the circle coming along?

710
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,710
Madam,

711
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,040
the nails have been planted.

712
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:00,960
Your four clones inside the circle—

713
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,840
Taisui, Gukui, Guifeng, and Jiuwei—

714
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,070
are all on standby.

715
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,360
Good.

716
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,400
It's time for Taisui to meet

717
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,960
our old friend from the Western Regions.
