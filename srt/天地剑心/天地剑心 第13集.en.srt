is still intact.

192
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,200
Seems like

193
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,320
this village

194
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,550
is safe for now.

195
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,680
Mrs. Qian.

196
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,790
Welcome, miss.

197
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,390
Are you here to get tonic?

198
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:47,790
Yeah.

199
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,720
Mrs. Qian,

200
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:51,430
these are the handkerchiefs you asked for.

201
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:52,720
So delicate.

202
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,240
It's just that our village is too remote.

203
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,000
Otherwise,

204
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,240
you'll definitely be known

205
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,790
for your embroidery.

206
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,800
Thank you for your support.

207
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:02,630
By the way,

208
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,750
is the medicine I asked for ready?

209
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,410
Yes, I'll get it for you.

210
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,890
You look even thinner, don't you?

211
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,540
How is your husband doing?

212
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,030
I think

213
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,200
he needs more time to recover.

214
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,510
It must be hard for you.

215
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,120
New Year's Eve is coming.

216
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,370
It's not easy for a woman
to support the family alone.

217
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:38,470
Mrs. Qian.

218
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,010
What are these?

219
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,590
These are glutinous rice balls.

220
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,440
It's New Year's Eve soon.

221
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,000
Every household in our village

222
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,150
will make some of them.

223
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,550
It's a symbol of reunion.

224
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,950
You should also make some

225
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,270
for auspices,

226
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,000
in the hope of your husband waking up soon

227
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,150
to reunite with you.

228
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,720
Mrs. Qian,

229
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,000
he's not my husband.

230
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,270
Not your husband?

231
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,750
Then who is he?

232
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,250
He's my savior.

233
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,210
Young Master Fugui.

234
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,000
I will light the way for others

235
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,640
just as you did for me.

236
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,270
For a demon's sake,

237
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,390
you won't even draw the Wangquan Sword.

238
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,240
Foolish!

239
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,550
You're unworthy of being a Wangquan.

240
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,240
Young Master Fugui,

241
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,510
I'm willing to see lush mountains,
amazing waters,

242
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,480
and snowy deserts with you.

243
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,440
Soldier!

244
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,880
If you want to leave,

245
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,920
you must return everything

246
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,720
you owe the Yiqi Alliance!

247
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,060
Kill him.

248
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,000
Kill him!

249
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:48,980
Kill him!

250
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,710
Kill him!

251
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:50,630
Kill him!

252
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,320
Kill him.

253
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,150
Kill him!

254
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:54,800
Qingtong!

255
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,510
This is

256
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,440
the Purest Sun Flame?

257
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,790
It's still here?

258
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,800
It seems that during my coma,

259
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:58,790
the spiritual fire in my body
protected my meridians

260
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,600
and removed that evil energy.

261
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,030
Mother,

262
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:05,589
so it was you

263
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,720
who's been protecting me.

264
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,320
Qingtong.

265
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,050
Young Master Fugui.

266
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,200
Young Master Fugui.

267
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,000
You're awake, Young Master Fugui.

268
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,550
I'm sorry.

269
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,080
Sorry, Young Master Fugui.

270
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,350
I'm just so happy to see you awake.

271
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,110
I hurt you without realizing it.

272
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:12,880
I'm sorry.

273
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:13,790
It's okay.

274
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,910
Young Master Fugui,

275
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,550
you must be hungry

276
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,730
after lying in bed for so long.

277
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:22,830
Just a moment.

278
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,640
I'll make some food for you.

279
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:26,220
I'll make some food for you.

280
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,290
Young Master Fugui,

281
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,770
how have your wounds

282
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,920
been healing?

283
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:41,670
It's fine.

284
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,500
I feel much better now.

285
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:46,890
That's good.

286
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,000
What's wrong?

287
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,480
Young Master Fugui,

288
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:02,920
I remember

289
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,550
I saw you with white hair

290
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,480
back then.

291
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,510
The white hair was probably caused
by the collision

292
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:16,920
between the invading demonic aura
and the spiritual blood in my body.

293
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,720
I probably
looked terrifying back then, right?

294
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,640
No way.

295
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,790
Young Master Fugui is

296
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,130
handsome in any way.

297
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,680
Oh, right, Young Master Fugui,

298
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,610
give me a second.

299
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,610
Young Master Fugui,

300
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,070
you were seriously injured

301
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,400
with your clothes torn.

302
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,480
I made you another suit.

303
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:45,830
Check this out

304
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,030
and see if you like it.

305
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,150
Qingtong.

306
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,570
I really like it.

307
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,160
Young Master Fugui,

308
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,770
tonight is New Year's Eve.

309
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,720
People usually make rice rolls.

310
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,480
How about

311
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,260
we make some together?

312
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,200
Sure.

313
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,030
This is...

314
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,810
The cobweb barrier was triggered.

315
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,040
The spies from the Silk Cave

316
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,680
caught up so quickly.

317
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:41,440
Looks like

318
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,030
I can't let my guard down.

319
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,030
Young Master Fugui has just recovered
from fatal injuries.

320
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:48,690
I'd better not tell him for now

321
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,260
so that he won't worry.

322
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,070
You've done the worst things,

323
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:10,880
yet you don't look guilty at all.

324
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,590
This is impressive.

325
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,240
Don't you feel

326
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,790
even a little guilty at all?

327
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,680
I just took back

328
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,590
what was supposed to be mine.

329
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:30,830
Why should I feel guilty?

330
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:34,730
The Soldier has left the Yiqi Alliance.

331
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,350
Are you planning

332
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:39,070
to stay in this shabby Sword Tomb forever?

333
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,720
Have you forgotten

334
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,510
what Wangquan Hongye did to you?

335
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,750
My Madam has a brilliant plan

336
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,720
that can help you kill

337
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,350
Wangquan Hongye.

338
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:57,030
I'm all ears.

339
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,200
Our Madam likes

340
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,530
the way you play along with the situation.

341
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,200
She asked me to tell you a story.

342
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,400
You probably know

343
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,240
that there's a giant Grief Tree in Tushan.

344
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:18,110
Our Madam was born in this tree.

345
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,720
Unlike other fox demons,

346
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,000
she was born completely black

347
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,760
with an innate affinity
to darkness and death.

348
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,750
The Elders of Tushan noticed the anomaly.

349
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,510
Through divination, they deduced

350
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:33,270
that she was born from the world's hatred,

351
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,640
an inborn evil being.

352
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,310
They believed that she'd destroy
the whole world in the future.

353
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:40,270
So, they confined her
to the Heartbreak Cliff of Tushan

354
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,480
and gave her a seed of the Grief Tree.

355
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,750
They said if she could grow a Grief Tree,

356
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,000
they'd free her.

357
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,150
In the end,

358
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,960
Madam used her own hatred

359
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,790
to nurture a huge Black Grief Tree

360
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,440
and found that her own strength

361
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,510
grew with the tree.

362
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,640
From then on, she started gathering
the hatred in the world to feed this tree.

363
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,720
Until that day,

364
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:03,310
Wangquan Hongye came with the Mask Group
from outside the circle.

365
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,940
With the mind-controlling dark power,

366
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:08,690
Madam killed
almost all the Mask Group members.

367
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,310
But unexpectedly,

368
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:13,200
Dongfang Huaizhu helped Wangquan Hongye
burn his life force

369
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,270
to pull off the Heaven-and-Earth Strike.

370
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,030
That strike

371
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,150
broke the Black Grief Tree,

372
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,240
cut off the source of Madam's power,

373
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,270
and destroyed her body

374
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,480
with only a single wisp of hatred left.

375
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,720
Wangquan Hongye felt so guilty

376
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:26,430
[Wangquan]

377
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,240
that he lost his Heart of Sword

378
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,840
and survived pathetically.

379
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,440
Madam had been hibernating for years.

380
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,960
And finally, she absorbed
the world's hatred through the Grief Tree

381
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,110
and woke up.

382
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,070
Because of Madam's resurrection,

383
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,240
the clones left outside the circle

384
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,680
have been revived.

385
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,720
And you

386
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,790
have a chance to take revenge.

387
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,880
I've heard about the story you told.

388
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:54,400
But even without the Heart of Sword,
Wangquan Hongye is still quite strong

389
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,480
with a firm grip on the Yiqi Alliance.

390
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,960
What's the point

391
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:00,920
of telling me this?

392
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:08,350
Back then,
Madam badly injured Wangquan Hongye

393
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:10,280
with the mind-controlling power.

394
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,070
She can still do the same now, of course.

395
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,720
Think about it.

396
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,780
Only Wangquan Hongye, Li Quzhuo,

397
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:19,110
and the Mask Group members

398
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:21,880
who died outside the circle
know Madam's existence there.

399
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,920
No one else

400
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,070
has really met Madam.

401
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:28,790
Wangquan Hongye has a scar.

402
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:30,720
All you need to do is

403
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,070
rub it in.

404
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:36,070
Now you should know what to do, huh?

405
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,110
These are rice balls, right?

406
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:42,830
Yes.

407
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,030
So what's the difference
between them and tangyuan?

408
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:47,070
These rice balls

409
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,480
are bigger.

410
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:49,880
The round ones

411
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:52,070
like this are sweet.

412
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,240
This one with a tip is

413
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,200
salty.

414
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,460
But don't worry, Young Master Fugui.

415
00:24:58,550 --> 00:24:59,310
I didn't add

416
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,030
any meat to the stuffing.

417
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:02,590
Mm.

418
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,880
It's okay even if there's meat.

419
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,540
From now on,

420
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,490
we don't have to eat vegetarian food only.

421
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,400
Young Master Fugui.

422
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,940
Do you want to give it a try?

423
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,640
It's said that making rice balls

424
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,640
is auspicious.

425
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:24,830
Okay.

426
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:25,680
Sure.

427
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,570
Let me teach you.

428
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,470
First, press it flat.

429
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:33,840
Like this.

430
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:46,930

Eat up.

Mm.

472
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,200
How's it, Young Master Fugui?

473
00:27:59,200 --> 00:27:59,860
Delicious.

474
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:03,850
Why aren't you eating?

475
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:04,720
Well,

476
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:05,840
I'll eat.

477
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:07,170
I'm eating.

478
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,530
Young Master Fugui,

479
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,400
you ate them all?

480
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:38,350
Yes.

481
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,400
Is there anything wrong?

482
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,400
Nothing.

483
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,200
Nothing.

484
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,640
Don't you feel anything wrong?

485
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:49,960
No.

486
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,750
It can't be.

487
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,920
It's said
that if you eat rice balls with coins,

488
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,720
you'll be lucky for a whole year.

489
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,560
If Young Master Fugui gets one,

490
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,730
he will be very happy for sure.

491
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,000
Could it be

492
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:14,710
that he swallowed it?

493
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,450
Young Master Fugui,

494
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,920
why is this coin in my bowl?

495
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,950
It seems that in the new year,

496
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:28,270
Qingtong,

497
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,680
you'll be lucky.

498
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,200
Did you switch the bowl

499
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,670
when I went to get the spoons?

500
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:38,880
Qingtong,

501
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:40,810
this is your good luck.

502
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,400
Then I will share it

503
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:50,730
with you, Young Master Fugui.

504
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,070
I hope you can be lucky

505
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:54,840
every day in the future.

506
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:01,270
Thanks.

507
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,370
Young Master Fugui,

508
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,440
have some more.

509
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,000
Maybe there are

510
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,610
still some with coins.

511
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:15,170
It's really lively when common folks

512
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,770
celebrate New Year's Eve.

513
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,400
Young Master Fugui,

514
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,660
why don't we go hang out

515
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:22,630
down the mountain after dinner?

516
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:23,200
Okay.

517
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,240
Great.

518
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:29,360
Eat up, Young Master Fugui.

519
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:30,160
Mm.

520
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:42,870
[Huadeng Village]

521
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:46,880
Young Master Fugui.

522
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,750
It's pretty lively here, isn't it?

523
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:49,200
Yes.

524
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,370
Look at these lanterns. So beautiful.

525
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,070
Come on! Faster!

526
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,200
Young Master Fugui.

527
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,480
Young Master Fugui, look!

528
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,440
What is that?

529
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:29,930
Are you okay?

530
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:30,720
I'm fine.

531
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:36,760
I'll go back now.

532
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,270
Miss, are you okay?

533
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,000
Did I hit you?

534
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,170
I'm fine.

535
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:43,910
Thank you.

536
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:46,670
Are you a visitor here?

537
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,970
We live on the mountain.

538
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,270
We heard the festive sound here

539
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,530
and came to have a look.

540
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,550
I see.

541
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,000
This is the Huadeng Village.

542
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,110
Since you two are rare guests,

543
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,480
would you like to drop by my house?

544
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,440
My name is Ma Xiaolian.

545
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,170
My father is the village head,
a hospitable host.

546
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:01,550
Mm.

547
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:01,920
Okay.

548
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:03,830
Thank you then.

549
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:04,240
Let's go.

550
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:04,640
Okay.

551
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:05,690
Let's go!

552
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,000
Our child

553
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,010
will definitely become

554
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,570
the strongest swordsman in the world.

555
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:05,350
Master.

556
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:17,110
Tingyun,

557
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,490
what are you doing here?

558
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:20,790
Master,

559
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:24,520
before Senior Fugui's departure,

560
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,200
you barely came here.

561
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,110
Senior Fugui's place

562
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:30,880
was dead silent

563
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,790
most of the time.

564
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,010
Now that Senior Fugui is gone,

565
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,790
you're here again.

566
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:45,440
Are you

567
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,550
missing him?

568
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,000
How's it?

569
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:02,790
-Pretty?
-Come on.

570
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:03,350
Here you are.

571
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,680
Drink it while it's hot.

572
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:05,800
Thank you.

573
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,940
Don't mention it, young man.

574
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:09,670
This is rice tea.

575
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,550
Try it.

576
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:12,800
It's sweet, fragrant, and delicious.

577
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,929
Young Master Fugui,

578
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:17,960
this rice tea tastes really good.

579
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,690
Give it a try.

580
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:19,670
Mm.

581
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,710
This young gentleman

582
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:28,190
really listens to his wife.

583
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,900
It's not like that, madam.

584
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,190
W-We...

585
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,920
Don't be shy, miss.

586
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,280
Mrs. Qian from the pharmacy said

587
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,670
that recently, a lady, who's so skilled

588
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:42,070
in embroidery and lives on the mountain,

589
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,150
often came to trade embroidery

590
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,590
for tonic from her.

591
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:48,710
That lady took care of her husband
day and night,

592
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,110
hoping that her husband

593
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,489
could get better soon.

594
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,320
Are you

595
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,880
that young lady?

596
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,000
I...

597
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,000
Don't be shy.

598
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,320
In my opinion,

599
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,230
God

600
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:04,670
must've been moved by your sincerity.

601
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:07,230
Judging by this gentleman's complexion,

602
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,030
he must've recovered very well!

603
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,320
Drink it while it's hot.

604
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:11,710
Mm.

605
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:14,880
Xiaolian.

606
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,080
The ritual's starting soon.

607
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,880
You should go prepare for it.

608
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:20,800
I almost forgot

609
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,290
this important matter.

610
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,320
This girl.

611
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,190
Madam.

612
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,710
The village is so bustling
and lively today.

613
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:31,880
Is there any event?

614
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,800
Yes.

615
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,940
Our village holds a ritual

616
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:37,400
on every New Year's Eve.

617
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,960
Everyone will light the lights
and stay up all night.

618
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:43,070
We'll pray to the River God

619
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,510
for a year

620
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:46,320
of good weather

621
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,880
and peace.

622
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:51,070
Our River God is amazing.

623
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:52,360
Thanks to him,

624
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:53,230
look,

625
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,880
we're finally leading

626
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,480
peaceful lives.

627
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:58,840
Madam,

628
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,240
can we

629
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:02,280
attend this ritual, too?

630
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,110
Of course.

631
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,920
The more people, the better.

632
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,760
We just want to be happy and lively.

633
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:09,920
Great.

634
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,510
Young Master Fugui,

635
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:12,150
try this.

636
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:13,230
It's sweet.

637
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:15,760
Drink it while it's hot.

638
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,190
Miss, look.

639
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,070
What kind of lantern is this?

640
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:21,200
It's a rolling lamp.

641
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,320
This year's ritual will be
opened by my performance.

642
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,400
Miss, let me show you.

643
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:24,840
Okay.

644
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:25,390
Let's go.

645
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:26,590
Young Master Fugui,

646
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:27,390
I'll go first.

647
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,150
Mm.

648
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:33,070
The rolling lamp is

649
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:35,150
also called an everlasting light.

650
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,320
Once you light it, you just can't land it.

651
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,870
Otherwise, the River God will be angry.

652
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,350
The ritual tonight

653
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,280
will be opened by Xiaolian.

654
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,760
Look how amazing she's doing.

655
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:51,670
Young man,

656
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:55,070
would you like
to make a fish lantern, too?

657
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:56,670
The fish lantern

658
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:58,320
can carry your wish.

659
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:00,760
If you offer it to the River God,

660
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:03,510
he will protect you.

661
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:04,760
Look,

662
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,550
I have all the materials.

663
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:07,530
I'll teach you.

664
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:08,550
Okay.

665
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,440

I can get drunk,

681
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,760
be sad,

682
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:12,840
and laugh

683
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,670
radiantly.

684
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:19,170
♪ We'll exchange courage
in the sea and wind ♪

685
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:17,760
I want to live freely like this.

686
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:25,730
♪ Through the dream, I'll meet you again ♪

687
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:32,810
♪ Not yet awake, but I believe I'm close ♪

688
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:39,850
♪ If we're destined to not be together ♪

689
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:46,700
♪ I'll meet you in the sky next time
to fly far away together ♪

690
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,150
If

691
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,320
I can make a wish,

692
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,550
I hope that from this moment on,

693
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,190
Young Master Fugui

694
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,540
will no longer be
disturbed by worldly affairs.

695
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:13,420
I hope he can be free,
travelling around the world

696
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,630
and pursuing what he wants.

697
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,960
The chicken is ready.

698
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,510
Coming.

699
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,030
The wine is here.

700
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,070
Young man,

701
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:40,030
would you like some rice wine?

702
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,320
Chief Ma,

703
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,400
Young Master Fugui never drinks.

704
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,440
I'll drink with you.

705
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,070
Hey.

706
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,280
How can men not drink?

707
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,360
Yes.

708
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,420
I usually don't dare to drink too much

709
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:53,710
because I'm afraid it might
mess things up.

710
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:57,030
Only during the Spring Festival
will I drink to my heart's content.

711
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:57,630
Young man,

712
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,780
will you have a few drinks with me?

713
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,400
This is our homemade rice wine.

714
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,800
It's really good.

715
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,190
Miss, young man, just try it.

716
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,080
-Then I'll give it a try.
-But...

717
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:09,960
Xiaolian, go get some big bowls.

718
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,290
-Yes, big bowls!
-Okay.

719
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,670
Come on.

720
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:13,030
Hurry.

721
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:14,360
Big bowls?

722
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,630
Madam,

723
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:20,760
Chief Ma,

724
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:22,070
do you all drink

725
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,230
with such big bawls here?

726
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,500
This is the real way to enjoy it, Miss.

727
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:27,280
Yes.

728
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,000
We all

729
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,430
drink with big bowls
and eat meat in big chunks.

730
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,000
Yes.

731
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,770
Today is New Year's Eve.

732
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,510
You two came to join us.

733
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,920
Our place is lively and buzzing

734
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,070
with festive vibes.

735
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,030
Let's drink together.

736
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:41,490
Come on.

737
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,760
Cheers.

738
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,130
Young Master Fugui,

739
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,670
how do you feel?

740
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,510
This wine is a little spicy.

741
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:08,600
I don't feel anything else.

742
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,000
He can drink.

743
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,930
I heard that my mother never got drunk.

744
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:15,070
Maybe I'm just like my mother.

745
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,630
Then let's have some more!

746
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:17,760
Come on, young man.

747
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,280
Cheers.

748
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:20,800
Young Master Fugui,

749
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,880
drink less.

750
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,220
Don't worry.

751
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,280
Xiaolian, do your best.

752
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,030
Yes.

753
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,060
Be careful!

754
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:11,750
Xiaolian,

755
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,590
are you okay?

756
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:13,550
I'm fine, miss.

757
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:15,440
But I sprained my ankle. I can't dance.

758
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,000
I need you to dance in my place.

759
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:17,590
But...

760
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:19,600
You can do it. I taught you just now.

761
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:22,440
Folks,

762
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:23,760
the rolling lamp didn't touch the ground.

763
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,190
Let's continue the ritual.

764
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:27,920
Okay.

765
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,320
Mm.

766
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:33,670
Mm.

767
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:00,960
Nice!

768
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,920
Bravo!

769
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:12,880
Nice!

770
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:42,360
Nice!

771
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,840
Bravo!

772
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:09,920
Bravo!

773
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:13,710
Nice!

774
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:15,360
Nice!

775
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:31,030
Nice!

776
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:36,190
Good show!

777
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:38,630
Bravo!

778
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,590
So beautiful.

779
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,670
Amazing!

780
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:53,810
It's so beautiful.

781
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:54,810
Yes.

782
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:31,760
Young Master Fugui,

783
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:33,760
have you really decided

784
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:35,990
to never return to the Wangquan Manor?

785
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:38,510
I used to only care

786
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:42,450
about drawing my sword and sheathing it.

787
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,680
I never thought
that I'd leave the Wangquan Manor.

788
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:48,250
But no matter what,

789
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,610
I, Wangquan Fugui, will never change.

790
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,280
I'm no longer

791
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,360
the Soldier deep inside.

792
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:57,880
Even without you,

793
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:01,130
I would have come this far.

794
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,570
But on this journey,

795
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:13,420
it's been better having you

796
00:46:15,550 --> 00:46:16,280
by my side.

797
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:26,110
Mm.

798
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:28,800
Look.

799
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,530
This fish lantern is so pretty.

800
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,190
Before today,

801
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:35,880
I never thought
that, besides learning swordsmanship,

802
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,340
I could also learn
how to make fish lanterns.

803
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:40,230
Yes.

804
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:41,840
So pretty.

805
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,360
Actually, Young Master Fugui,

806
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,440
you're not completely the same as before.

807
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,150
At least you

808
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:51,450
smile more now.

809
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:58,400
I finally found you,

810
00:46:58,880 --> 00:46:59,840
Soldier.
