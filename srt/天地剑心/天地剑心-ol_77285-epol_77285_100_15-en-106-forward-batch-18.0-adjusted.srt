[Episode 15]

3
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:18,760
Cousin.

4
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,310
I won't let you die so easily.

5
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,750
Young Master Fugui,

6
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,710
dinner's ready.

7
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,280
Mm.

8
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,750
You've come all this way.

9
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,280
Aren't you going to come in?

10
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,800
Young Master Rumu?

11
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,280
I rushed here

12
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,740
as soon as I heard the news.

13
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,890
I thought you'd be in some pitiful state—

14
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,460
but I didn't expect

15
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,030
your life here

16
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,030
to be much better
than at the Wangquan Manor.

17
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,310
You're really something.

18
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,520
Nothing can stump you.

19
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,720
Even when I hide here, you still find me.

20
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,150
After all, I'm

21
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,680
your only friend, aren't I?

22
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,580
Young Master Rumu,

23
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,920
I'll get another set of tableware for you.

24
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:48,910
Fugui,

25
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,120
this wine's no good.

26
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,650
Where did you buy it?

27
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:54,840
Forget it.

28
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,410
You don't drink anyway. Can't blame you.

29
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,150
Fugui,

30
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,079
how old are you now?

31
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,250
Still carving a wooden sword?

32
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,360
Fugui,

33
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:12,840
there's something

34
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,170
I've never figured out.

35
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,590
Tell me the truth.

36
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:18,520
Who drove you to this point?

37
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,520
Don't tell me...

38
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,080
it was my father.

39
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:54,240
I'm fine.

40
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,120
It's just an old injury.

41
00:04:58,990 --> 00:04:59,600
Fugui,

42
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,240
I'm really fine.

43
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,680
I've made it this far,

44
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,550
and every time, I've managed to
survive against all odds.

45
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,480
You...

46
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,600
You don't need to worry about me.

47
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,620
Why?

48
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,670
What do you mean, "why"?

49
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,780
All your meridians have been destroyed.

50
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,580
It obviously happened long ago.

51
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:19,750
Who hurt you?

52
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:22,720
Fugui,

53
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,370
you're the Soldier.

54
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,560
Calm down.

55
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,040
I'm asking you—

56
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,830
who did this to you?

57
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:32,710
Fugui,

58
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,720
before I answer,

59
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,560
let me tell you a story.

60
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,240
I haven't finished telling you the story

61
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,440
of me and Long Weiyun.

62
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,410
If you don't listen now,

63
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,830
you may not

64
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,720
get the chance again.

65
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,240
As you know,

66
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,700
after my father went to
the Western Regions,

67
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,500
he killed a lot of dragon demons.

68
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,909
But what you don't know is

69
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,230
that he also toyed with
a dragon demon's heart

70
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,000
and tortured her to death.

71
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,240
Later,

72
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,960
that dragon demon's daughter abducted me,

73
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,250
wanting to exchange me
for her mother's remains.

74
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,040
But my father...

75
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,600
he didn't care about my life at all.

76
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,750
So...

77
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,390
her plan failed.

78
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,720
Sister, help me.

79
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,040
Help me...

80
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:35,000
Help me...

81
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,600
Stop pretending.

82
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,120
Your own father doesn't care about you.

83
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,430
You think I would?

84
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,720
Help me...

85
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,840
Dragon demons are born
with the power to heal.

86
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:03,830
Funny enough,

87
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,750
my family couldn't help me

88
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,870
with my asthma,

89
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,409
but my family's enemy healed me.

90
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,870
After she cured my asthma,

91
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,620
she wanted to let me go.

92
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,470
But I, an abandoned child,

93
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,790
didn't want to return to that cold family,

94
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,560
so I shamelessly followed her.

95
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,070
And I stayed

96
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,920
for over 10 years.

97
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:29,060
She's cold on the outside,
yet warm on the inside.

98
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,780
No wonder you've never had

99
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,120
any prejudice against demons.

100
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,830
You mentioned it before.

101
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,310
Turns out you comprehended

102
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,850
your own Way of the Sword in the desert.

103
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,540
At that time,

104
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,870
after I comprehended
my own Way of the Sword,

105
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,600
the first thing I did for her...

106
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,800
was to return home

107
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,920
and retrieve her mother's remains.

108
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,310
Don't you want to know

109
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,310
where I've been these past few days?

110
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,460
Can you hold back from telling me?

111
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,950
I just went home,

112
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,510
stealing and forcing my way through...

113
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,870
to get...

114
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,650
what you wanted.

115
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,630
All that's left of your mother's remains

116
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,000
is her skull.

[Dragon Cave]

118
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:46,600
Mother,

119
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,430
you're finally able to return home.

120
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,270
Rest in peace

121
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,000
in the Dragon Cave.

122
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:16,690
What is this?

123
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:34,230
[Long Weiyun's Mother]

124
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,790
I scraped off your dragon scales

125
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,720
and absorbed them into my own body.

126
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,490
Look.

127
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,400
My left arm is now

128
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,590
impervious to all weapons.

129
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,920
Unfortunately, your scales can't
grow back.

130
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,440
But I heard that...

131
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,720
dragon horns...

132
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,390
can regrow when cut off.

133
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:35,450
That's Mother's memory
from when she was alive.

134
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,620
Quan Jingting,

135
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,750
you bastard.

136
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,200
Poor child,

137
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,510
you've suffered.

138
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:50,940
Who are you?

139
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,730
I'm the last dragon spirit

140
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,850
with memories in the Dragon Cave.

141
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:56,830
I've been waiting for you here

142
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,510
for many years,

143
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:01,870
just to give this Water-Control Orb
to you.

144
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,630
Water-Control Orb?

145
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,760
I've been searching for it for so long,

146
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,360
and it was actually here all along?

147
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,420
It was entrusted to me by your mother
when she was alive.

148
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,870
She told me not to give it to you

149
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,860
unless absolutely necessary.

150
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,000
But I died long ago,
and my spirit is weak.

151
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,660
I may dissipate at any moment.

152
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,080
Now

153
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,150
you're the last True Dragon of our clan.

154
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:29,310
This sacred relic of our clan

155
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,000
should be kept by you.

156
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,240
Remember,

157
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:35,390
though this Water-Control Orb
holds immense power,

158
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,510
until you have the strength to control it,

159
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,370
treasure your own life above all.

160
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,390
I only learned much later...

161
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,280
Weiyun's heart burned with vengeance,

162
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,120
so

163
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,190
she chose to forcefully absorb
that Water-Control Orb

164
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,990
to obtain the True Dragon Power.

165
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,720
The Water-Control Orb is

166
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,850
the greatest treasure
of the True Dragon Clan.

167
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:57,910
It can naturally absorb
all demon power for its own use.

168
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,280
Since ancient times,

169
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,880
this orb has absorbed
countless demon powers,

170
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,510
making it very unstable.

171
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,110
It's a double-edged sword.

172
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,720
To control it is
to command rain and storm;

173
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,230
to be controlled by it

174
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,680
is to fall into madness overnight.

175
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,120
I can't believe...

176
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,550
I failed to absorb it.

177
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,120
Ever since she found out

178
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,410
in the Dragon Cave what my father had done

179
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,390
to her mother,

180
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,150
Long Weiyun

181
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,020
hated me to the very core.

182
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,870
But I had no idea.

183
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,030
Until one day,

184
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,410
she suddenly asked me a question.

185
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:48,970
What kind of person

186
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,640
do you think your father is?

187
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,390
How should I...

188
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,360
answer that?

189
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,580
After all, he is my biological father.

190
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,140
Yes.

191
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,670
Do you like me?

192
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,510
What?

193
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,180
You... You...

194
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,180
You... I... I...

195
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:23,290
Weiyun...

196
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,050
I'll take you somewhere.

197
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:36,120
[Dragon Clan's Habitat]

198
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,320
There's such a beautiful place

199
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,600
in this desert.

200
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,060
I've never seen it before.

201
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,190
Do you know what this place used to be?

202
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:44,870
Was it a place

203
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,200
as beautiful as you are?

204
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,720
This was once our dragon clan's habitat.

205
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,630
Thousands of years ago,

206
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:57,060
this desert was once an oasis,
with clear skies and blue waters.

207
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:57,690
Later,

208
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:00,580
the oasis turned into a desert,

209
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,220
and our clan declined.

210
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:04,630
So our dragon demons became rare.

211
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:07,930
But our dragon clan
has always had a custom.

212
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:12,200
We bring the person we love,
who loves us in return...

213
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,910
to this place.

214
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:21,790
You haven't answered the question

215
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,080
I asked you at home.

216
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,360
Do you like me?

217
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,750
I-I do.

218
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,200
I like you.

219
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,920
What do you like about me?

220
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,450
I like the way you look
when you're lost in thought.

221
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,870
I like how you

222
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,340
have a cold expression

223
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,200
but a soft heart.

224
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,090
I like following behind you...

225
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,250
watching your back.

226
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:00,910
Anyway...

227
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,120
I like everything about you.

228
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:03,910
So much that

229
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,000
I'd do

230
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:06,510
anything for you.

231
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,640
I remember...

232
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,600
today is your birthday.

233
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,720
You even remember that?

234
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,180
How about I give you a gift?

235
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,120
Great!

236
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:29,920
Wait, Weiyun.

237
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,070
I also have a gift for you.

238
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:33,840
Look.

239
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,270
I searched for this flagon

240
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,130
for a long time.

241
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,270
I just hope...

242
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,320
every time you drink in the future,

243
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,910
you'll think of me.

244
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:46,510
Okay.

245
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:49,490
Weiyun,

246
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,490
it's your turn.

247
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,620
Should I close my eyes?

248
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,030
Wow...

249
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,300
It's so beautiful.

250
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:16,960
So beautiful.

251
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:27,840
Weiyun.

252
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,720
Can you...

253
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:31,530
promise me one thing?

254
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,240
Go ahead.

255
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,330
From now on, every year on my birthday,

256
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,010
will you make it snow for me?

257
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:43,320
Mm.

258
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,120
Okay.

259
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,170
Our dragon clan has now declined,

260
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,240
so

261
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,550
if you encounter
any difficulties absorbing

262
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,880
the Water-Control Orb,

263
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,360
you can use this.

264
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:19,790
Never forcefully absorb it,
or you'll lose your life.

265
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,270
This is the Love Gu
of the Southern Border.

266
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,550
It can only be planted on someone

267
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,109
who has deep feelings for you

268
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:29,109
and is devoted to you heart and soul.

269
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,589
From then on,

270
00:17:30,829 --> 00:17:33,200
they will bear all the pain for you

271
00:17:33,349 --> 00:17:34,790
and be controlled by you.

272
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:01,480
That day,

273
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:03,400
she planted the Love Gu on me,

274
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,440
wanting me to take on the pain

275
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,310
during the process of absorbing

276
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,640
the Water-Control Orb.

277
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,150
I understood her.

278
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,760
After all, I was Quan Jingting's son.

279
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,330
That surname,

280
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,120
etched into my blood,

281
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:16,920
was itself

282
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,460
an invisible harm to her.

283
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,490
And in my heart,

284
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:23,990
I too lived with that same torment.

285
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,350
I liked her,

286
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,230
so I didn't blame her.

287
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,750
I was willing to
bear all the pain for her.

288
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,510
The pain from the backlash

289
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,790
was actually easier to bear than
watching her forcibly swallow her hatred

290
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:36,720
all those years.

291
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,030
From now on...

292
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:15,400
never give your true heart
to the wrong person again.

293
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,400
The moment the Gu Mark disappeared,

294
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,010
I suddenly wanted to laugh.

295
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,930
It turned out she still didn't understand—

296
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:23,270
from the moment

297
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,920
she kidnapped me and healed my illness,

298
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,250
my life

299
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,800
had already belonged to her.

300
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,080
It's not worth it.

301
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,030
Why isn't it worth it?

302
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,280
You struggled so hard
to survive as a child...

303
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:44,770
yet you still mastered such swordsmanship.

304
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,400
With talent like yours,

305
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,470
you should never lay down your sword.

306
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:50,960
Ah.

307
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,010
I can accept you looking at me that way.

308
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,920
I'm a fool, and I know it.

309
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,440
Even so...

310
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,350
I never hated her.

311
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:01,750
How did you

312
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,600
find out about all this?

313
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,000
I only learned about it

314
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,080
much later from others.

315
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,790
I thought my father

316
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:15,430
had merely played with her mother's heart.

317
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,150
But who'd have known...

318
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,310
I underestimated him.

319
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,000
He somehow learned

320
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,600
that Weiyun possessed
the Water-Control Orb.

321
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,420
He also wanted that power.

322
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,560
And at that time, Long Weiyun

323
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:32,050
had just absorbed the Water-Control Orb

324
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,970
and couldn't fully control it.

325
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,890
He took advantage of it.

326
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,320
Quan Jingting,

327
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,510
today

328
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:43,180
I'll make you suffer a hundredfold
for what you did to my mother!

329
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,680
You dragon demons

330
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:49,830
are really stupid.

331
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,560
You actually walked into my trap.

332
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,360
Kill her!

333
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:57,720
Kill her!

334
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,960
You just said

335
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,910
you'd make me suffer a hundredfold
for the pain I caused your mother.

336
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:33,080
Do you know

337
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,300
how many times I cut off your mother's

338
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,400
dragon horns as they grew back,

339
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,070
huh?

340
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,440
You bastard!

341
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,880
I won't let you die so easily!

342
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:55,940
Do you know how miserably she screamed

343
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,950
when I scraped the scales from her body?

344
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:04,640
Quan Jingting!

345
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,720
