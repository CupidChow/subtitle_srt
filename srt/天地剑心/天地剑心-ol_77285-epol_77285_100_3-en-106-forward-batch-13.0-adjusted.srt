[Episode 3]

3
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,400
She's too badly injured

4
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,680
to be cured.

5
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,780
I can only revive her by refining my power

6
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,600
with this winged spirit pearl.

7
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,150
Perhaps...

8
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,190
this is God's will.

9
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,710
I'm not dead?

10
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,000
Young Master Fugui,

11
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,520
did you save my life?

12
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,280
Young Master Fugui,

13
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,360
why do you look so pale?

14
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,840
Are you injured?

15
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,630
I'll get you a towel.

16
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:00,630
No need.

17
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,190
I have a question for you.

18
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,720
What would you like to know?

19
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,630
Ask away.

20
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,040
Do you want to take a human form?

21
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,520
A human form?

22
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,750
Of course I do!

23
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,470
If I can transform into a human,

24
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,280
I'll become an invincible demon

25
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,080
that can cultivate much faster.

26
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,960
That way,

27
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,490
I can protect my younger brother.

28
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,560
There are usually over 100 little spiders
like you in a brood.

29
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,960
Don't you have other siblings?

30
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,160
My other siblings...

31
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,120
They all died.

32
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,000
Only No.12581 and I survived.

33
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,400
Though I'm a tiny low-grade spider demon,

34
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,430
I still

35
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,400
care about certain things

36
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,150
and certain people.

37
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,210
Young Master Fugui,

38
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,190
could you please help my brother out?

39
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,150
I'm begging you.

40
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,750
Please, Young Master Fugui.

41
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,890
Young Master Fugui...

42
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:55,940
Remember this:

43
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,700
you should make

44
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,700
your dreams come true on your own.

45
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,040
Make my dreams come true

46
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,710
on my own?

47
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,250
Young Master Fugui,

48
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,520
it's so cold outside today.

49
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,680
How am I able to fly?

50
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,150
Young Master Fugui,

51
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,160
you're amazing.

52
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,070
What pearl is this?

53
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,950
How beautiful.

54
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,370
It doesn't matter.

55
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,010
But this pearl can transform you
into a human.

00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,480
I'm a human now!

71
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,390
Young Master Fugui, look!

72
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,730
Young Master Fugui,

73
00:07:00,159 --> 00:07:01,720
these two human legs don't seem

74
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,430
able to give me as much support
as my eight spider legs could.

75
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,290
Stand up first.

76
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,960
Then see if you can walk.

77
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:07,510
Oh.

78
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,680
This is not a dream, is it?

79
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,190
Young Master Fugui,

80
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,120
pinch me now.

81
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,030
Hurry!

82
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:23,930
Go back in the room.

83
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,240
Young Master Fugui,

84
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,830
are you leaving for the morning practice?

85
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:27,690
I can go with...

86
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,200
Young Master Fugui,

87
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,760
go ahead and don't worry!

88
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:38,000
I'll get used to walking with two legs.

89
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,890
Now I finally know how the world looks

90
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,510
from this angle.

[Wangquan]

92
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,680
Master of the Quan family

93
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,140
from the Western Regions,

94
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,040
Quan Jingting, has arrived!

95
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,420
Dismissed, all of you.

96
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,310
Yes!

97
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,630
My dear cousin,

98
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,930
I don't think I came at the right time.

99
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,360
Is this

100
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,890
the morning practice?

101
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,000
It's been a long time
since I last practiced sword skills here.

102
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,059
I wonder if any progress has been made

103
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,990
in Wangquan Swordsmanship.

104
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:27,650
Wangquan Swordsmanship
is said to be the best in the world.

105
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,240
But it doesn't seem impressive now.

106
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,680
Isn't there anyone competent
in the Wangquan family now?

107
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,630
My dear cousin,

108
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,630
I haven't seen you for years.

109
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,240
You look haggard now.

110
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,550
Master Quan, you were expelled

111
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,950
from the Wangquan family
over a decade ago.

112
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,380
Then you changed your surname to "Quan."

113
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,360
Today, at the Wangquan Manor,

114
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,320
your role is a guest.

115
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,150
A guest

116
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,920
should show a guest's courtesy.

117
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,640
I, Quan Jingting,
from the Quan family in the border area,

118
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,000
am glad to meet you,
Chief of Yiqi Alliance.

119
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,750
Master Quan,

120
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,150
are you in town
for the Blue Sky Convention?

121
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:10,270
Of course.

122
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,530
The Blue Sky Convention

123
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,030
is a tryout for young people.

124
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,360
Where is your son Quan Rumu?

125
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,870
Rumu will go to the Li Residence himself

126
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,670
for the Blue Sky Convention.

127
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,840
Send Master Quan and other visitors

128
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,640
to the guest quarters for a rest.

129
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:58,870
Transferring spiritual power to her

130
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,930
must've caused quite an impact on me.

131
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,070
I was being too careless.

132
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,960
Young Master Fugui, you're back!

133
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,840
I've got used to walking with two legs.

134
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,360
Look!

135
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,970
Young Master Fugui,

136
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,670
what's going on with you?

137
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,360
I'm fine.

138
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,690
I just need to regulate my breathing.

139
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,240
The water is a bit dirty.

140
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,080
I'll take it out.

141
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,080
No need.

142
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,010
This dress is not a good fit for you.

143
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,800
Today, I finally saw
how good the Soldier could be.

144
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,280
Though he hasn't mastered
the Heaven-and-Earth Strike,

145
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,120
he's already stronger

146
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,210
than most others in the world.

147
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,840
Rumu won't stand a chance

148
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,600
of defeating him.

149
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,610
Master, do you have a plan?

150
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,600
Go tell that ungrateful son of mine

151
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,000
that he must win the Soldier

152
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,440
in the Blue Sky Convention,

153
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,360
even by devious means.

154
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,030
Yes.

155
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:39,200
I hear
that when regulating their breathing,

156
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,400
cultivators would enter
the Primary Circulation Phase.

157
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,550
Don't worry, Young Master Fugui.

158
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,480
I'll absolutely protect you well.

159
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,630
No.12580.

160
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,360
I'm here!

161
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,230
How did you reach this place?

162
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,790
No.12580,

163
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,510
I didn't expect you
to have truly taken a human form.

164
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:09,320
Did the Soldier
help you with the transformation?

165
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,720
He has so much trust in you

166
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,360
that he feels safe
to sit unconsciously before you.

167
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,510
You can kill him now.

168
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,080
Attack his Baihui acupoint.

169
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,910
That's the fatal weakness of all mankind.

170
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,200
You've transformed into a human.

171
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,960
You should know where Baihui acupoint is.

172
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,670
Take this.

173
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,240
Go.

174
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,120
Stick this needle deep into him.

175
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,650
Then he'll definitely die.

176
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,210
My job is to spy on the Soldier,

177
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,750
not to assassinate him.

178
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,360
Besides,

179
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,240
I've completed my task.

180
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,390
Mistress's ultimate goal is revenge.

181
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,240
If you kill the Soldier,

182
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,630
we'll be given the greatest credit.

183
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,510
You good-for-nothing,

184
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,240
will you do it or not?

185
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,370
I'll go if you don't.

186
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,240
No way!

187
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,240
You've indeed become disloyal to Mistress.

188
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,120
Are you taking the Soldier's side now?

189
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,720
I'll report it to Mistress right away.

190
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,450
She'll kill your brother then!

191
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:51,790
What are you doing?

192
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,630
Let me out!

193
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,200
Was it a thunder strike?

194
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,600
Now, I'll show you who is

195
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,670
a real good-for-nothing.

196
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,450
My goodness!

197
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,720
I feel so dizzy.

198
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:10,960
I'm telling you,

199
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,030
as long as I stay with Young Master Fugui

200
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,290
and keep cultivating,

201
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,480
it won't be long

202
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,270
before I become able
to rescue my brother on my own.

203
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,000
Mistress won't let it happen.

204
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,320
You and your brother

205
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,720
will die a tragic death!

206
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:23,550
You...

207
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,200
T-This...

208
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:28,530
It...

209
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,340
Since when did you become so good?

210
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,000
Let me out!

211
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:35,960
Let me out!

212
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,240
Just stay in.

213
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,040
Senior Fugui!

214
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,600
Are you in there?

215
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,000
It's Lady Feng.

216
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:22,349
How odd.

217
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,440
This is impossible.

218
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,310
How did Senior Fugui
lose so much spiritual power?

219
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:27,960
That Raccoon Dog Demon King

220
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,960
was no match for Senior Fugui at all.

221
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:32,480
Quan Jingting couldn't have caused
this much harm either.

222
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,280
Senior Fugui,

223
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,109
are you okay?

224
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:38,690
I'm fine.

225
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,750
Why did you never tell us

226
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,810
you had lost so much spiritual power?

227
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,950
But breaking that formation

228
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,200
was like giving Quan Jingting
a giant slap in the face.

229
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,530
You did a wonderful job.

230
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:56,770
Tingyun,

231
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,840
you're free to go if that's everything.

232
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,270
I know you haven't

233
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,730
fallen in love with me yet.

234
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:06,680
But it's okay.

235
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:07,790
I still think

236
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,480
in Yiqi Alliance, I'm the only one

237
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,940
who's good enough for you.

238
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,110
If one day,

239
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:16,240
someone who suits you better shows up,

240
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,030
I'll quit trying.

241
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,200
Senior Fugui,

242
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:28,640
have you seen

243
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,550
that little spider demon again,

244
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,680
the one that delivered letters for me?

245
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,440
No.

246
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,810
I promised to set her free that day.

247
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,140
She has never come to me again after that.

248
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,120
Actually, she's quite fun.

249
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,660
Too bad that she's a demon.

250
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:59,160
Humans and demons take different paths.

251
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,160
These two species can't be friends.

252
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,510
I'm clear about that.

253
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:09,960
Senior Fugui,

254
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,170
take a good rest.

255
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:28,390
Stop looking.

256
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,290
You fear her that much?

257
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,370
Judging from what Lady Feng said,

258
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,310
she definitely hates for a spider demon

259
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,400
to stick with you.

260
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:46,200
By the way, Young Master Fugui,

261
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,720
are you feeling better now?

262
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,160
Yes.

263
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:49,880
Oh.

264
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,680
That's great.

265
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,160
Young Master Fugui,

266
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,750
do I look better now as a human

267
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,600
than as a spider before?

268
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,440
Young Master Fugui,

269
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,750
does being quiet mean

270
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,080
your answer is "yes"?

271
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,580
Well, you don't think I look good.

272
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,450
Anyway, at least I don't seem ugly

273
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,110
in your eyes now, right?

274
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,070
So much noise.

275
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,480
Oh.

276
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:37,640
Young Master Fugui,

277
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,520
thank you for saving my life.

278
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,310
I swear I'll repay you.

279
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,450
I just didn't want you
to be trampled to death.

280
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:48,310
The wish to protect someone
motivated you to cling to life.

281
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,970
I wanted to help. That was all.

282
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,760
What's your plan for the future?

283
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,720
Young Master Fugui,

284
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,160
can you teach me a set of sword skills?

285
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,420
I hope to get stronger,

286
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,000
so as to protect those

287
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,970
I want to with my own strength.

288
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,240
It isn't hard to teach you
a set of sword skills.

289
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,500
But the dress you're in

290
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,710
is truly inappropriate.

291
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:21,200
Huh?

292
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,090
Young Master Fugui,

293
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:51,070
usually, on a snowy day like this,

294
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,880
even demons such as myself
wouldn't go out.

295
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,310
Wind, frost, rain, and snow

296
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,790
are all part of nature.

297
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:01,440
Severe weather helps with your study.

298
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,440
Is there anything

299
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,280
I can learn from the snow?

300
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,030
Young Master Fugui

301
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,880
is amazing!

302
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,830
Young Master Fugui,

303
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:03,830
what do you think?

304
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,240
Lift your right arm higher.

305
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,570
Align it with the sword.

306
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,070
Oh.

307
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,000
How strange.

308
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,090
Young Master Fugui,

309
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,350
why am I still not able
to release sword energy?

310
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:25,880
It takes more practice.

311
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,590
Okay.

312
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,030
Young Master Fugui,

313
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:50,790
look!

314
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,200
Such beautiful sunset glows.

315
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,890
Young Master Fugui, look at that!

316
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:14,720
They will disappear

317
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,570
in just a short moment.

318
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:22,920
They'll be gone in a short moment.

319
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:25,200
What a pity.

320
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,550
Young Master Fugui,

321
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,510
look over there!

322
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:36,790
A flock of birds!

323
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,570
What a lovely scene.

324
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:54,750
These birds

325
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:58,080
came earlier today than usual.

326
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,720
Young Master Fugui

327
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,290
has never once seen the world outside.

328
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,160
He'd even deeply cherish

329
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:10,350
the presence

330
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,750
of sunset glows and birds.

331
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,840
Those people
confine Young Master Fugui here,

332
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,830
making him cultivate every day.

333
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,460
But he's a human after all.

334
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,610
He feels lonely too.

335
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,200
This is odd.

336
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,640
Why am I feeling so angry?

337
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:29,880
Well,

338
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,880
I must do something
for Young Master Fugui.

339
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:55,650
♪ The wind secretly makes a home
on an unknown page of the story ♪

340
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:59,960
♪ As you flip a page,

00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,320
You claim your son Rumu to be able

509
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,760
to slay the Soldier.

510
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:05,490
Where is he now?

511
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,070
A hero is a product of his time.

512
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:14,270
That proverb is true.

513
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:17,070
But you have to show us

514
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,440
how your son Rumu

515
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:21,190
can manage to kill the Soldier.

516
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,480
Don't act so recklessly.

517
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,290
Young Master Fugui...

518
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,780
What are you trying to say?

519
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:59,150
Nobody knows how tender you are.

520
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,600
Tenderness is not what a Soldier needs.

521
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,230
Also, nobody knows

522
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,840
what you really want, Young Master Fugui.

523
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,280
Then what do you think I really want?

524
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,440
You long to see the scenery outside,

525
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,240
and to get out of that Palanquin.

526
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,560
Mr. Fei said you could

527
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:17,850
take a horse carriage,

528
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,530
instead of the Palanquin,

529
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,330
to the Blue Sky Convention.

530
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,000
That way, you can see the world outside.

531
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,020
Who would've known...

532
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,490
that you'd become temporarily blind?

533
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,550
How useless of me.

534
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,690
I can't protect anyone.

535
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:50,480
Why don't you be my eyes?

536
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:01,670
Though Young Master Fugui
can't go outside as he pleases,

537
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:02,510
I believe

538
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,960
he will see

539
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,560
the real Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai
one day,

540
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,220
and that he won't be this lonely forever.

541
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:11,150
Before that,

542
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:12,510
if possible,

543
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,710
I'd like to weave more prettier scenery

544
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:17,040
for Young Master Fugui.

545
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,230
Now, let me be

546
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:21,590
Young Master Fugui's eyes.

547
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:47,150
Sit tight.

548
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,010
Young Master Fugui,

549
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:56,000
yesterday,

550
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,700
I spent a whole night making this ribbon.

551
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:01,130
It's a perfect match for your outfit.

552
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,380
Young Master Fugui

553
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,740
deserves the best of everything.

554
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:08,910
Didn't you promise to be my eyes?

555
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,280
Oh.

556
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,000
Let me see.

557
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,010
Young Master Fugui,

558
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:19,710
those flying south in a line

559
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,360
are Datian birds, right?

560
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,280
Yes.

561
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,550
A young one just fell behind.

562
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:28,110
But it's catching up now.

563
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,860
How lovely this is.

564
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,190
They're all free and soaring.

565
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:41,150
I'm so happy to be

566
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,670
your eyes.

567
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:52,830
Everything outside must be beautiful,

568
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:53,800
because

569
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:55,760
you sound very happy.
