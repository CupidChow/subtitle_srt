00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:04,520
[Episode 2]

3
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,040
Huaizhu,

4
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,950
over these years,

5
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,510
Fugui has lost all the joys

6
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,000
a person should have,

7
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,630
yet I can't go soft on him.

8
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,000
I can't let down

9
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,130
everything you've done for me
and for the Yiqi Alliance.

10
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:30,590
A Soldier

11
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,120
is born only to slay demons.

12
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:42,800
Soldier,

13
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,680
wait.

14
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,240
It's me,

15
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,850
the little spider who sent you the letter.

16
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,900
This is horseweed.

17
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,710
It has a great hemostatic effect.

18
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,150
Here.

19
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:57,800
No need.

20
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,240
Your father was really mean

21
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,400
to you.

22
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,360
Plus,

23
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,750
it's your birthday.

24
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,120
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

25
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,310
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

26
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,570
I didn't see anything.

27
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,910
Take this.

28
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,280
It contains pinellia, Dahurian angelica,

29
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,080
dried beauveria, and cinnabar.

30
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,520
If you simmer it for six hours,

31
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,910
it's good for internal injuries too.

32
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:17,800
And...

33
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:19,800
Hey!

34
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,560
I haven't finished yet.

35
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,000
Why are you always like this?

36
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,960
Your closest friends and loved ones

37
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,910
dying one by one before your eyesâ€”

38
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,150
Do you know

39
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,120
what it's like?

40
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,760
The Hongye underneath the Jinlan Mask

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,660
lost because of his emotions.

42
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,000
He'll never forgive himself!

43
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,310
I won't allow you to follow in
his footsteps!

44
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,430
Father,

45
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,280
what exactly are you hiding?

46
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,680
This is...

47
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,510
the Black Grief Tree?

48
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,120
No.

49
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,510
It can't be.

50
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,190
I've already cut it down.

51
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,720
This is fake.

52
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,720
It's an illusion.

53
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,390
Really?

54
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,480
Wangquan Hongye,

55
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,870
long time no see.

56
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,070
Third Young Master of Aolai tried his best

57
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,480
to draw a circle

58
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,630
and protect you all,

59
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,360
but you all arrogantly left the circle

60
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,890
and got yourselves killed.

61
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,630
All these years,

62
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,750
you think you can change anything

63
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,270
by raising a Soldier?

64
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,630
Love is dying and hatred is rising
in the world.

65
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:21,690
The Black Grief Tree will
eventually come back to life.

66
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:22,870
And I

67
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,000
am waiting to meet Wangquan Fugui,

68
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,920
the blade you personally

69
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,070
sharpened.

70
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,510
It's a dream.

71
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,560
But why is my dream

72
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,850
always connected to the outer circle?

73
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,000
Could it be...

74
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,510
Wangquan Hongye,

75
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,680
did you dream of me again?

76
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,810
As long as there's hatred in the world,

77
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,240
you won't be able to really kill me.

78
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,430
Just wait

79
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,240
to pay with your blood.

80
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,560
Don't be shameless.

81
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,380
The Soldier
celebrated his birthday alone?

82
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,240
What kind of intelligence is this?

83
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,680
Madam Yin is not patient.

84
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,159
If she decides to
hold someone accountable,

85
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,510
can we take the responsibility?

86
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,390
If she did,

87
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,800
she'd go to you first.

88
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,050
Don't think I don't know

89
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,610
you credit yourself

90
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,830
for all my work.

91
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,750
So what?

92
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,600
Demons go by the law of
survival of the fittest.

93
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,600
Crushing you

94
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,600
is as easy as killing an ant.

95
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,750
Don't forget

96
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,390
that without me,

97
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,880
you can't even enter

98
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,750
the Soldier's home by yourself.

99
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:13,560
You...

100
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,440
How dare you threaten me?

101
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,340
I know what to do

102
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,330
about the Soldier.

103
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:19,800
Hey!

104
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,630
After I get the Soldier's intelligence,

105
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,190
I'll kill you!

106
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,310
Last night,

107
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,240
I dreamed about the outside again.

108
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,960
Ever since I returned from the outside

109
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,040
my consciousness has been
connected to the outside.

110
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,040
I can feel that...

111
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,190
it

112
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:40,750
is back.

113
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,160
Recently, hostility has increased

114
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,220
in the Demon Realm.

115
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,430
More and more murderers
have crossed the border.

116
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,360
I wonder

117
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,840
if it's related to the Black Fox.

118
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:56,800
So,

119
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:00,470
Fugui must master
the Heaven-and-Earth Strike quickly.

120
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,600
But Young Master Fugui

121
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,270
is already doing his best.

122
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,560
Let's not talk about this anymore.

123
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,390
How's the Li family preparing

124
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,990
for the Blue Sky Convention?

125
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,690
The Blue Sky Convention

126
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,860
is a grand event for the Yiqi Alliance

127
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,430
to select young talents.

128
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,240
This time,
the Peach Garden's Li family is hosting.

129
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,190
Master Li is the most reliable.

130
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,240
He has already sent out invitations

131
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,800
and has made all preparations

132
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,530
for the convention next month.

133
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,190
Quzhuo probably didn't expect

134
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,750
that one day,

135
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,920
he'd become the most reliable master
of the Li family.

136
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,870
His brother would be pleased

137
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,360
if he knew in heaven.

138
00:08:46,429 --> 00:08:46,870
Yes.

139
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,010
There's a guest

140
00:08:49,789 --> 00:08:51,320
not on the invitation list.

141
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:52,750
Who?

142
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:55,970
Fifteen years ago,

143
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,630
he practiced witchcraft
with his demon core.

144
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,720
After he was discovered,

145
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,600
you

146
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,640
took away his Wangquan surname

147
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:06,000
and exiled him to the Western Regions.

148
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,060
It's Quan Jingting, Master Quan.

149
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,840
It's my cousin?

150
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,030
I heard that he's very popular
among the people

151
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,650
after subduing demons

152
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,240
in the Western Regions

153
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,440
and also gained fans?

154
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,240
Yes.

155
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,960
He brought your previously
favorite nephew, Young Master Rumu,

156
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,910
with him.

157
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,750
I heard

158
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,930
they are on their way already.

159
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,150
Great!

160
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,960
Get out of the way!

161
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,320
Move!

162
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:01,970
Get lost!

163
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:02,800
Get lost!

164
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,240
I'm talking to you!

165
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:06,480
Get lost!

166
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,540
I'm talking to you!

167
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,920
Go over there!

168
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,360
You...

169
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:10,720
You...

170
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,510
Leave!

171
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,240
Let's go.

172
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,670
What are they carrying?

173
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,630
It looks heavy.

174
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,750
Who are these people?

175
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,600
Shush.

176
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:32,960
No matter who it is,

177
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,030
theyâ€™re not someone we should mess with.

178
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,120
Stop talking.

179
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,080
[Quan Jingting,
Master of the Frontier Quan Family]

180
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,080
Where is Wangquan Shouyi?

181
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,530
Why would the elder of the Wangquan family

182
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,630
be here

183
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,480
in my small tobacco house?

184
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,840
Stop pretending.

185
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,840
Do you think I don't know

186
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,440
who your true boss is

187
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,560
and what this tobacco house
is truly selling?

188
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,450
Extracting demon cores alive

189
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,960
and developing forbidden medicine...

190
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,220
You don't dare to sell it
under the Wangquan Manor's watch,

191
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,870
so you're selling it
in the Western Regions.

192
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,320
Do you need me to give

193
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,150
the evidence to Wangquan Hongye?

194
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,100
Are you afraid?

195
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,360
Let me show you something else.

196
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,240
Is that basalt?

197
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,000
It looks so powerful.

198
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,150
Whose swordsmanship is this?

199
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:15,750
Could it be

200
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,550
the Heaven-and-Earth Strike?

201
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,030
This...

202
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:17,960
This is...

203
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,630
My son, Rumu,

204
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,150
is an extraordinary genius.

205
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,600
Two years ago,

206
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,280
when he fought dragon demons alone
in the Western Regions

207
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,940
and performed this sword move...

208
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,360
It was already close to
the Heaven-and-Earth Strike.

209
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,870
I was the legitimate heir of Wangquan.

210
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,410
Many years ago,

211
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,960
just because of a small mistake,

212
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,440
Wangquan Hongye forced me
to change my surname to Quan

213
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,240
and exiled me
to the Western Regions.

214
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:18,320
The 15-year grudge
for having my surname takenâ€”

215
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,550
Iâ€™ve been waiting for this very day.

216
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,480
Wangquan Shouyi!

217
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,960
You coward!

218
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,800
Do you only dare to hide in this brothel,

219
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,360
smoking opium,

220
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,480
and cursing Wangquan Hongye
behind his back?

221
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,750
Elder Wangquan welcomes Master Quan.

222
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,480
Wangquan Shouyi.

223
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,550
Where are the people persecutred
by Wangquan Hongye

224
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,870
that you promised me you'd gather?

225
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,720
Technically,

226
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,030
I'm your uncle.

227
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:20,720
Right?

228
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,150
You have no manners at all.

229
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,750
My son Rumu

230
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:38,670
will kill the Soldier
during the Blue Sky Convention

231
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,330
and seize the Wangquan Sword.

232
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,690
The Yiqi Alliance has many fence-riders.

233
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,440
If my son takes the lead,

234
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:45,670
you command everyone

235
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:47,130
to follow me in revolting.

236
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,240
The Yiqi Alliance

237
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,440
will be in our hands.

238
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,790
What a foolish and simple plan.

239
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,030
I've always been simple
and straightforward.

240
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,980
What about you, Uncle?

241
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,840
If Wangquan Hongye found out
you developed evil medicine

242
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,960
and sold them,

243
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,520
have you ever thought

244
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,270
what would happen to you?

245
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,320
In the chess game of life,

246
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,130
there are no perfect plans.

247
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,750
Heroes are made by their times.

248
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,030
If we work together

249
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,440
and succeed,

250
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,550
the Yiqi Alliance

251
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,840
will be your cash cow.

252
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,390
If you can also

253
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:42,000
provide me a pill

254
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,150
to improve martial power

255
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,000
and my son takes it,

256
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,910
the plan will be even more perfect.

257
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:55,200
Even a vicious tiger doesn't eat its cubs.

258
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:58,120
I don't want your

259
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,580
tiny, disgusting things.

260
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,320
I know you have better ones.

261
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:17,910
Soldier.

262
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,510
You're back?

263
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:20,670
Here,

264
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:21,360
a towel.

265
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,990
I forgot to give you
a birthday gift yesterday.

266
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,200
This chrysanthemum

267
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,930
is for you, Young Master Fugui.

268
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,170
Aren't you afraid of me?

269
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:34,840
I'm not.

270
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:38,600
Really?

271
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,080
No need to scare me.

272
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,270
I know

273
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,330
you don't hurt the weak and innocent.

274
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,910
If you wanted to kill me,

275
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,120
you would have killed me

276
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,550
when you first met me.

277
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,240
Are you sure?

278
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,840
Is it because

279
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,480
you're a spy sent by the Silk Cave?

280
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,140
Soldier...

281
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,440
How...

282
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,270
How did you find out?

283
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,930
Madam Yin, Mistress of the Silk Cave,

284
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,030
hates me so much.

285
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,340
Over the years,

286
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,510
she's trained countless spiders

287
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,710
to spy on information

288
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,910
and even sent demons to kill me.

289
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,930
Her spiders can weave brocade

290
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,810
and send information
with the vibration of the webs.

291
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,540
They're even better at lying.

292
00:17:29,069 --> 00:17:30,670
You approached Feng Tingyun

293
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,740
to please her and send her letters

294
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,829
just to

295
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,400
help you get close to my residence.

296
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:37,680
Am I right?

297
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,480
You can leave now.

298
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:48,730
Soldier,

299
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,480
I beg you.

300
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:51,990
You've crossed the line.

301
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,550
Allowing you to leave

302
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,700
is the greatest leniency I can offer.

303
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,440
Please, Soldier.

304
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:59,350
There are thousands of spiders

305
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,440
in the Silk Cave.

306
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,960
Our lives are as worthless as weeds.

307
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,420
If I go back empty-handed,

308
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,750
I'll definitely die.

309
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,080
Soldier,

310
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,310
please have mercy.

311
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,440
Let me stay.

312
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:10,640
Soldier,

313
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,440
I realized that you love maps.

314
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,750
Do you want to go somewhere?

315
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,510
Soldier,

316
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,830
I can weave brocade paintings.

317
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,230
I've been to many places.

318
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,840
I can weave whatever scenery

319
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,310
you'd like to see.

320
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,240
Just let me stay.

321
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,480
That horrible male spider

322
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,550
hit me so hard.

323
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,440
No.12580,

324
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,550
when life and death are at stake,

325
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,110
you can't...

326
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,590
I'm...

327
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,440
I've fixed

328
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,640
your broken bones,

329
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,680
but your injury must be

330
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,110
treated with a medicine bath
for a few days.

331
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:26,920
Thank you.

332
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,110
I'm so small.

333
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:30,310
It must have taken a lot of effort

334
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,920
to bandage me so well.

335
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,840
I saw you in the Eastern City.

336
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,160
Eastern City?

337
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,310
Young Master,

338
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,910
someone used spider silk
to stop his bleeding.

339
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,270
Why did you save him?

340
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,960
Shouldn't demons hate humans?

341
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,310
I...

342
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,350
Forget it.

343
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:56,880
Soldier,

344
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,680
you let me stay

345
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,680
because of what I said, right?

346
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,490
Is there really some scenery
you want to see?

347
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:15,640
Soldier,

348
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,880
what are you looking at?

349
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:27,000
Have you been to the
Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai?

350
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,790
The Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai?

351
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,050
I've never been there.

352
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:32,310
But I've seen a bamboo forest by the water

353
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,640
with a pretty pavilion.

354
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:34,590
Maybe

355
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,920
they're about the same.

356
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,150
By the wayâ€”

357
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:45,510
It's so bitter.

358
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:49,720
Weave it.

359
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:50,960
Really?

360
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,440
You're letting me stay?

361
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,170
Don't worry.

362
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,880
I'll definitely weave it beautifully.

363
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,410
Soldier,

364
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,350
this medicine is too bitter.

365
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,480
Do you have candy?

366
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,510
No.

367
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:00,160
Oh.

368
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,550
Where should I sleep?

369
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,480
Wherever you want.

370
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,880
But for spiders
to spit out beautiful silk,

371
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,720
we must eat well, sleep well,

372
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,880
and be in a good mood.

373
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:15,170
This place is so comfortable.

374
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,280
I didn't know

375
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,350
you could fold paper boats.

376
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,250
I saw someone do it once.

377
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,440
Don't you sleep?

378
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,030
Your room is so shabby.

379
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,860
You don't even have a maid.

380
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,510
Isn't Wangquan Manor

381
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,910
the richest in the world?

382
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,920
Where is this
Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai

383
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,960
you mentioned?

384
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,370
Is it important to you?

385
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,400
Why are you leaving?

386
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,940
Are you going to sleep?

387
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,640
Then tonight,

388
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:41,790
I'll sleep here.

389
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,550
See you tomorrow.

390
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:46,880
Soldier,

391
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:48,770
good night.

392
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,000
I slept so well.

393
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,270
Good morning, Young Master Fugui.

394
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,200
You're up early.

395
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,110
Did you go practice your sword?

396
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,370
None of your business.

397
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,640
Young Master Fugui,

398
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,550
you must be tired from practicing.

399
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,480
Have some tea.

400
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:24,750
I guess

401
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,110
you don't like the title of Soldier.

402
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,130
Young Master Fugui,

403
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,160
one of my arms hasn't recovered.

404
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,030
The weaving may be slower.

405
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,750
Delaying things

406
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,360
won't get you any useful intelligence.

407
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,090
Go do your own thing.

408
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,960
But the medicine is really bitter.

409
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,830
Young Master Fugui,

410
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,360
do you really have no candy?

411
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,480
If there's candy,

412
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,500
I might weave the brocade faster.

413
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,070
By the way, Young Master Fugui,

414
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,600
has Lady Feng looked for me?

415
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,780
I've asked someone to inform Feng

416
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,110
that a spider

417
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,400
was chased away by me.

418
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,750
Actually, Lady Feng

419
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,310
is a nice person.

420
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,640
She's innocent yet confident.

421
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,110
Unlike me,

422
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:14,000
I have to put in all my effort
just to save my life.

423
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,510
In my opinion,

424
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:17,240
you two are a good match.

425
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,440
Why are you always cold to her?

426
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,070
I...

427
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,070
I'm sorry, Young Master Fugui.

428
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:21,720
I was wrong.

429
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,240
I'll shut up.

430
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,000
Iâ€™m leaving.

431
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:37,980
â™ª The past is mottled and worn,
a life bound by blades â™ª

432
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:44,280
â™ª This life, adrift and wasted,
still has my heart chasing the wind â™ª

433
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,020
â™ª I plant a tale deep within my soul â™ª

434
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:51,170
â™ª Even if, in the end â™ª

435
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:55,730
â™ª I can only sigh at fate's cruel jest â™ª

436
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:00,640
Young Master Fugui.

437
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,350
Look here.

438
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,480
There are many trees here.

439
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,030
The other side of the forest
is a mountain,

440
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:06,960
a big mountain range!

441
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,550
There are very, very high mountains,

442
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:11,110
with a big pool of water in the middle.

443
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:16,380
â™ª I once swore my sword would
sweep away all injustice â™ª

444
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,270
â™ª Yet returning, I wander through
rains of blood in search of old paths â™ª

445
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:24,110
â™ª Perhaps this life is but
a fleeting dream â™ª

446
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:28,250
â™ª I raise my sword to cleave
the mountain of destiny â™ª

447
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:30,500
â™ª Who will share this journey with me? â™ª

448
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:36,210
â™ª I've crossed thousands of peaks
and rivers wide â™ª

449
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:39,390
â™ª Unafraid as fate mocks
that I'm still young â™ª

450
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:41,920
â™ª Unafraid of countless swords
piercing my heart â™ª

451
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:47,870
â™ª Nor of the sword drawn,
pointing toward the abyss â™ª

452
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,840
â™ª Unafraid as old grudges
scatter to the wind â™ª

453
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,260
â™ª Unafraid to stand among the clouds â™ª

454
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:57,250
â™ª For my heart, Heaven and Earth
shall bear witness â™ª

455
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,210
â™ª Unafraid as fate mocks
that I'm still young â™ª

456
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:04,740
â™ª Unafraid of countless swords
piercing my heart â™ª

457
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:10,500
â™ª Nor of the sword drawn,
pointing toward the abyss â™ª

458
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:13,720
â™ª Unafraid as old grudges
scatter to the wind â™ª

459
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:16,250
â™ª Unafraid to stand among the clouds â™ª

460
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:20,230
â™ª For my heart, Heaven and Earth
shall bear witness â™ª

461
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,270
Young Master Fugui,

462
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,030
the brocade

463
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,030
is almost done.

464
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,350
Okay.

465
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,000
When it's done,

466
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,590
I should go.

467
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,330
Young Master Fugui,

468
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,070
you've been practicing swordsmanship
in the courtyard recently.

469
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,400
You do each move slowly.

470
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,190
Are you purposely showing me

471
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:59,880
so I have something to report
when I return?

472
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,210
Are you that confident?

473
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,030
Do you think

474
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,720
we'll never be your match?

475
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,110
In the Silk Cave,

476
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,270
everyone hates Soldiers.

477
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,590
When my little brother refused to sleep,

478
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,450
I would use Soldiers to scare him.

479
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,590
In our eyes,

480
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,680
Soldiers

481
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:21,440
are the most terrifying monsters.

482
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,720
Young Master Fugui, in your eyes...

483
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,790
what are we?

484
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:28,790
Demons.

485
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,720
But demons have different sizes.

486
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,830
Our kind

487
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,790
are the lowest-ranked demons

488
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:35,310
below the Demon King.

489
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,510
We live...

490
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:40,680
We live like this wild chrysanthemum,

491
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,200
in clusters.

492
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:43,960
If a big horse comes,

493
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,470
a huge patch can be killed at any moment.

494
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,380
Back then in the Eastern City,

495
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:50,880
I was also sent there

496
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,200
to follow you.

497
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,000
When I found that swordsman,

498
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,000
he was close to dying.

499
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,510
But I understood the look

500
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:03,550
in his eyes.

501
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,070
He wanted to live.

502
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:08,750
I've seen

503
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,960
that look in the eyes

504
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,600
of many of my friends.

505
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,770
When Soldiers come out,

506
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,320
you all kill
the most powerful demon kings.

507
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,000
You probably never know

508
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,750
that there are many

509
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,650
insignificant beings like us
beneath your feet.

510
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:29,240
Like this wild chrysanthemum,

511
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,750
we also want to live.

512
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,850
Young Master Fugui,

513
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,750
thank you

514
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,860
for giving me a chance to live.

515
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:41,830
Young Master Fugui.

516
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:42,480
Look.

517
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,000
Do I look like this wild chrysanthemum?

518
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,920
We'll be trampled to death anytime,

519
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,640
but

520
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,480
we both live happily.

521
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,240
Young Master Fugui,

522
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,170
you're actually

523
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:53,880
very lonely, right?

524
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,880
I know

525
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,070
you are

526
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,600
a very, very gentle person.

527
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:58,550
I hope

528
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,680
you can be happier too.

529
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:03,930
No matter what,

530
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,200
I will remember

531
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,300
the days I spent here with you.

532
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,440
The candy you gave me

533
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,960
was really sweet.

534
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,880
â™ª It was you who opened the world,
the times transparent â™ª

535
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:11,130
â™ª At sunrise, I open my eyes;
at moon-fall, I wait for an answer â™ª

536
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:17,080
â™ª If the light shines through the night â™ª

537
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,720
Young Master Fugui,

538
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,310
this painting

539
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,280
â™ª Dawn will awaken â™ª

540
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:22,030
is the most beautiful
Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai I've seen.

541
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:24,540
â™ª We never ask if fate is fair â™ª

542
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:25,880
Although you can't go out casually,

543
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,440
I believe

544
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:28,680
you will

545
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:31,760
â™ª You are the bright morning,
sinking into the sea â™ª

546
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,750
definitely see

547
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,880
the real Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai.

548
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,740
You won't be this lonely forever.

549
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,110
Before that,

550
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:38,440
â™ª I am the reflection
of the clear puzzle in the wind â™ª

551
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,610
if there is a chance,

552
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,270
I want to weave

553
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,640
more beautiful scenery

554
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,790
to show you.

555
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:46,570
â™ª If our so-called destiny
is to separate â™ª

556
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,510
Chrysanthemums
can't live past autumn,

557
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:46,960
but I will

558
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,400
try my best to live on.

559
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:52,760
â™ª We'll exchange courage
in the sea and wind â™ª

560
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,070
Let me

561
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,400
become your eyes.

562
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:59,320
â™ª Through the dream, I'll meet you again â™ª

563
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:55,920
Young Master Fugui,

564
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:57,550
goodbye.

565
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:06,400
â™ª Not yet awake, but I believe I'm close â™ª

566
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:07,400
I don't know what I got from the painting

567
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,430
of the Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai,

568
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:13,440
â™ª If weâ€™re destined to not be together â™ª

569
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:10,400
but I just...

570
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:13,160
love to look at it.

571
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,070
And...

572
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:20,290
â™ª Be each otherâ€™s star
and meet at the end of destiny â™ª

573
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,090
Young Master Fugui,

574
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,160
after I leave,

575
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,050
when will you forget me?

576
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,410
I almost forgot.

577
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,200
You have eidetic memory

578
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,550
You'll definitely remember me.

579
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,790
I can no longer

580
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,550
casually kill demons again.

581
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,000
Do demons

582
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,960
really all deserve to die?

583
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:48,160
You even learned his sword technique?

584
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:49,750
Not bad.

585
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,920
I also learned
Soldier's diet, daily routine,

586
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,960
and other habits.

587
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,880
Does he have any weaknesses,

588
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,510
such as

589
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:58,880
emotionally

590
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:00,960
or physically?

591
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,160
No.12580 is slow.

592
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,550
I couldn't find
any of his other weaknesses.

593
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:06,640
Please punish me.

594
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,160
Why would I punish you?

595
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:12,350
You successfully got close to the Soldier

596
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,400
and got such important information.

597
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,030
I should reward you instead.

598
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,680
Go ahead.

599
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,550
Give this medicine to your brother.

600
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:22,750
Thank you, Mistress.

601
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,310
I shall take my leave.

602
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,240
Mistress,

603
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,480
even with the Soldier's sword technique,

604
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,480
we still aren't his match.

605
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,570
Of course this intelligence is useless.

606
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,270
I didn't ask No.12580

607
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,920
to sneak into Wangquan Manor

608
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,880
for her to really gather intelligence.

609
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,430
I want her

610
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:49,240
to become the Soldier's weakness.

611
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,480
Go.

612
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,550
Investigate the Soldier's whereabouts.

613
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:53,480
At the right time,

614
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,550
arrange for the Soldier
to be reunited with his little spider.

615
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,640
Yes, ma'am.

616
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,480
Poor No.12580.

617
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,440
She doesn't know anything yet.

618
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,680
Young Master.

619
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,740
There's a new mission.

620
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,760
The Xin family

621
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,880
was forced by the Raccoon Dog Demon King

622
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,750
and had no choice

623
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,750
but to retreat into a land of miasma.

624
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,070
The Xin family's master

625
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,870
asked the Yiqi Alliance for help

626
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,350
to defeat this demon.

627
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:39,400
The raccoon dog demon clan isn't violent.

628
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,750
They've never crossed the border
since it was drawn.

629
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,110
Why have they

630
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,460
suddenly become radical?

631
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,200
The old Raccoon Dog Demon King

632
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,680
was kind and polite,

633
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,240
but recently,

634
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,960
the raccoon dog demon clan
had an internal conflict.

635
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,020
A fierce raccoon dog demon named Fu Li

636
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,680
killed the old king,

637
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,000
and got a winged spirit pearl
that can absorb human spiritual power

638
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,160
and help lower demons transform.

639
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,050
They used this pearl

640
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,480
to rampantly absorb the spiritual powers
of nearby human clans

641
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,550
for their own use.

642
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,550
The people suffered a lot.

643
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,960
That's why they're asking
the Yiqi Alliance for help.

644
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,680
Fu Li?

645
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:15,750
I remember her.

646
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:18,240
I read her information before.

647
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:18,960
Young Master,

648
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,090
you've worked hard.

649
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,480
You like flowers?

650
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,880
Then I will

651
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,400
send more here.

652
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,480
No need, Mr. Fei.

653
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,410
In a few days,

654
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,000
Yiqi Alliance

655
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,920
will hold the Blue Sky Convention.

656
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,750
Young Master,

657
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,200
you must win.

658
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:43,970
Then Master will allow you

659
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,640
to go travel about.

660
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,960
You won't have to keep looking at maps.

661
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,430
In the future, I won't look at

662
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,310
such useless things.

663
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,150
I don't mean to

664
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:05,310
reprimand you.

665
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,680
You are lonely.

666
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,070
The more one does,
the more mistakes one makes.

667
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:10,750
Anyway,

668
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,550
one thing.

669
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,830
Don't blame the Master.

670
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,680
If you want anything,

671
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,240
just tell me.

672
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:23,630
Okay, Mr. Fei.

673
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,440
Sister,

674
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,000
you did a great job,

675
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,440
so Mistress specially rewarded us.

676
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:35,150
Look.

677
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,290
We have meat for dinner these days.

678
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,920
You need to eat more.

679
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,550
Look how skinny you are now.

680
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:42,150
You're not as muscular as me.

681
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:45,110
It's because I was injured
by the Yiqi Alliance.

682
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:46,880
That's why I'm sickly and frail,

683
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,150
always a burden to you.

684
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,510
Actually, not everyone

685
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:52,080
in the Yiqi Alliance is bad.

686
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:54,800
You're so funny.

687
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,040
How can there be good humans?

688
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:58,760
Listen up.

689
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:00,480
Mistress's next mission

690
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,800
is to steal the winged spirit pearl
from the raccoon dog demon clan.

691
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,190
Anyone that I call out

692
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,699
must go on the mission.

693
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:07,760
No. 11788.

694
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,920
No. 12309.

695
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,590
No.12581.

696
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,320
You all will depart today.

697
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,190
Sister,

698
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,070
I'll get going.

699
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:19,710
Wait!

700
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,270
I'll go on his behalf.

701
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:54,070
You mere spider demons,

702
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:56,190
how dare you steal our magic weapon?

703
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,150
Do you want to die?

704
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,710
Am I going to die?

705
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:01,280
Demon King Fu Li,

706
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,930
come out to meet your death!

707
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,480
This is...

708
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,450
Young Master Fugui!

709
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:24,810
I've long heard of the name of
the Yiqi Alliance's Soldier.

710
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:27,250
I'll see what you're all about today!

711
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,510
You're playing tricks.

712
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,150
Come out!

713
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:09,760
[Raccoon Dog Demon King, Fu Li]

714
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,590
You are the Soldier?

715
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,630
Not that impressive.

716
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,230
Today, I'll use you as a sacrifice

717
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,260
to celebrate me leading
the raccoon dog demon clan.

718
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:40,150
The raccoon dog demon clan is the best
at transforming.

719
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:42,080
Young Master, you must be careful.

720
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:23,320
Soldier, die!

721
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:06,950
Young Master.

722
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:10,530
All the lower demons in Huangfeng Ridge
have been eliminated.

723
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,630
Return.

724
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:30,400
It's her.

725
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,840
Why is she here?

726
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,560
She's too badly injured

727
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:47,030
to be saved.

728
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,230
Young Master Fugui...

729
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:52,680
Young Master Fugui.

730
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:54,760
you probably never knew

731
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:56,480
there are many

732
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:58,800
insignificant beings like us
beneath your feet.

733
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,530
Like this wild chrysanthemum,

734
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,280
we also want to live.

735
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,570
Young Master Fugui,

736
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,550
thank you

737
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,620
for giving me a chance to live.

738
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,710
Unless...

739
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,660
I can only revive her by refining my power

740
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,490
with this winged spirit pearl.

741
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,230
Perhaps...

742
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,150
this is God's will.
