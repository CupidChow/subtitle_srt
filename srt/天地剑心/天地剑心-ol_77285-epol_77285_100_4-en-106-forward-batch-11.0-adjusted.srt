00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,960
You all know the rules now.

175
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,080
Today is the first day of the competition:

176
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,740
the Physical Combat Contest.

177
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,270
Rumu!

178
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,600
It's so difficult for me

179
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,730
to see you even once.

180
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,510
Father,

181
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,370
what are you talking about?

182
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,840
I was just heading to
the Blue Sky Convention.

183
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,030
Then why didn't you go there with me?

184
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:28,270
Well,

185
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,240
of all the vast lands beneath the sky,

186
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,750
the dullest place of all

187
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,270
is by your side, Father.

188
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,360
Your words

189
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:43,110
are breaking my heart.

190
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,120
My beloved father, you never do anything
for nothing.

191
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,720
Tell me,

192
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,930
you came specially to find me—

193
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,410
what do you want me to do?

194
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,970
These friends of mine think

195
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,850
that even though the Soldier is blind
for now,

196
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,290
he's still invincible.

197
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,910
So they want to see

198
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,390
your true strength.

199
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,580
The Soldier of Wangquan Manor...

200
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,390
Wangquan Fugui.

201
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:21,750
He shall challenge all of today's victors
in the Combat Contest.

202
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,480
This is a battle of honor.

203
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,320
The results

204
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:27,410
will not affect your advancement
to the next round.

205
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,720
Good luck, everyone.

206
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,600
Everyone,

207
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,240
please draw your swords!

208
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,000
Rumu.

209
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,050
You're in poor health.

210
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:13,030
After that strike, you won't be able
to exert any more strength.

211
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,750
Go back with me.

212
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,240
You are my son.

213
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,670
Why can't you just listen to me

214
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,150
and follow my will?

215
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,360
Would I harm you?

216
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:35,240
Everything I do and everything I get—

217
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,130
won't it all be yours in the future?

218
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,150
Father...

219
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,030
So it turns out you love me.

220
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,360
Fine.

221
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,320
How about I tell you

222
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,910
some stories about

223
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,430
how you, my real father, love me?

224
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:56,480
Back then,

225
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,510
you committed a grave error

226
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,240
by practicing forbidden arts.

227
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,910
You were expelled from Wangquan Manor

228
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,840
and exiled to the Western Regions.

229
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,750
You knew full well that I had asthma

230
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,910
and that in that place

231
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,440
I simply couldn't survive.

232
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,530
The Chief intended to keep me,

233
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,650
but at that time,

234
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,440
what did you say?

235
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,870
Rumu's asthma is severe.

236
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,140
[Young Quan Rumu]

237
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,210
If he goes with you
to the Western Regions,

238
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:29,770
[Grand Ambition Soaring to the Heavens]

239
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,890
with all that dust and sand,

240
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,470
I'm afraid he won't survive.

241
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,240
Let him stay.

242
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:32,790
No need.

243
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,520
Wherever I go,

244
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:35,510
he goes.

245
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:41,910
Jingting.

246
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,800
If Rumu goes with you,

247
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:46,670
he will die.

248
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,270
I won't leave him here with you.

249
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,630
Since he's my son,

250
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,120
in life he's mine,

251
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,460
and in death his ghost is mine too.

252
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,060
Just like that,

253
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:26,120
after we arrived in the Western Regions,

254
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,790
my asthma grew increasingly severe.

255
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,520
Even surviving was hard for me.

256
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,440
And you?

257
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,840
You began to ignore me,

258
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,030
killing demons everywhere

259
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,160
and making enemies.

260
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,870
Finally, one day,

261
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,730
someone captured me
as a hostage for revenge.

262
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,630
At that time, I knew

263
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,360
that taking me hostage was useless.

264
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,480
My life meant nothing

265
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,910
to you.

266
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,390
But what you did

267
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,240
was even worse than I imagined.

268
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,340
Quan Jingting!

269
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,600
I have your son!

270
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,880
Give me back my mother's bones!

271
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,770
That piece of trash is
of no use to me at all.

272
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,360
Kill him if you want!

273
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:16,870
Today...

274
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,480
I'm here to capture you!

275
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:31,750
After that,

276
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:35,050
I wandered through the desert
for over 10 years.

277
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,300
Did you ever look for me even once?

278
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,150
You didn't.

279
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,960
Did you care whether I lived or died?

280
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,840
You didn't.

281
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,120
But ever since I became famous
with one sword strike there,

282
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,080
you remembered

283
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,540
you still had a son like me.

284
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,250
You remembered to love me.

285
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,240
But how did you show this love?

286
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,500
For the sake of your ambition,

287
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,330
you took my friends as hostages

288
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,720
and forced me to work for you.

289
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:06,240
Father,

290
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,240
your love is

291
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,630
more poisonous than arsenic.

292
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:11,520
How dare you!

293
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,310
You have such strength

294
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,210
yet possess no grand ambition!

295
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,940
I've been working hard for so many years.

296
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,230
You are my son.

297
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,790
You should work for me.

298
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,480
Where have you imprisoned them?

299
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:38,400
Rest assured,

300
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,730
your gang of worthless friends

301
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,310
is very safe now.

302
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,720
As long as you obediently

303
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,590
go to the Blue Sky Convention
and defeat the Soldier,

304
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,070
I'll let them go.

305
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:50,830
However...

306
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,640
before that...

307
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,790
you have to take this first.

308
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,550
In this world,

309
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,550
what kind of father
would ask his son to take this?

310
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,350
This is just a pill

311
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,030
that can greatly boost
your spiritual power.

312
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,400
I want to ensure you win.

313
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,210
Even if I don't eat it...

314
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,210
I can still defeat the Soldier.

315
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,510
You think I'd believe you?

316
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,830
If I weren't holding the lives
of your worthless friends

317
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,350
you made in the Western Regions,

318
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:49,450
would you have obediently come with me
to the Blue Sky Convention?

319
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,480
I know you've been looking for them
these days.

320
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:53,400
Stop looking.

321
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:56,030
Even if you find them, it's useless.

322
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,370
What do you mean?

323
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,440
Do you know what that black liquid

324
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,680
is?

325
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,000
Crude oil.

326
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,590
With just a spark,

327
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,970
these worthless friends of yours

328
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,510
will be burned to ashes.

329
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,510
Let us go.

330
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:30,960
What do you want?

331
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,890
Don't come over!

332
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,930
Don't come over!

333
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,790
Mother!

334
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:35,960
What do you want?

335
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,480
Don't come any closer!

336
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,270
Let us go!

337
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,720
No!

338
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,200
No!

339
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,510
Father!

340
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,830
Mother!

341
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,000
No!

342
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,170
True Dragon Power?

343
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,310
You wretch,

344
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,650
say goodbye
to these worthless friends of yours.

345
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:15,920
Wait!

346
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,580
I'll eat it.

347
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,720
Now that's my good boy.

348
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,880
Today's Combat Contest is already over.

349
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,720
The evening banquet will start soon.

350
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,550
Go attend

351
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:14,880
and make up for

352
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,680
your willful absence earlier.

353
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,960
This is the chamber
specially prepared for you, Soldier.

354
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,240
There's also a side chamber inside

355
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,830
for your maid.

356
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,000
Thank you.

357
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:44,960
Young Master Fugui,

358
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,720
you must be very tired
from today's martial arts contest.

359
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,750
Rest for a bit.

360
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,750
You still have the banquet
to attend tonight.

361
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:50,200
Okay.

362
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:09,960
Come on.

363
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,480
To you.

364
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,750
This year's young competitors

365
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:28,590
are very good.

366
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:29,960
Hongye,

367
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,440
indeed, they're good.

368
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,400
But compared to us back in our day,

369
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,130
they still fall a little short.

370
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,350
Muhai,

371
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,940
let the banquet begin.

372
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:47,480
Everyone!

373
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,350
Didn't you say

374
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,900
you're hosting honored guests tonight?

375
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:53,920
Then why...

376
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,850
is there no seat for me?

377
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,810
Who might you be?

378
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,750
Good evening, Uncle.

379
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,270
I, Rumu, missed today's competition,

380
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:06,440
so I've come specially to ask you

381
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,370
for the qualification
for tomorrow's competition.

382
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,700
The Blue Sky Convention aims to
select future talents.

383
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,160
If you want to participate,

384
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,160
just ask them.

385
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,160
Everyone!

386
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,720
I'm Quan Rumu.

387
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,630
I've come a long way for this.

388
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:37,640
Please

389
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:38,920
do me a favor.

390
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,430
Today's banquet is only for

391
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,240
the winners of today's Combat Contest.

392
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,250
They have earned
the Soldier's recognition.

393
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,790
Rumu, you were absent today.

394
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,510
If the Chief allows it outright,

395
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,030
it would be unfair.

396
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:58,790
That's right.

397
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,480
Rumu.

398
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,810
Elder Shouyi is highly respected.

399
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:10,910
You have to prove yourself
with your strength.

400
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,750
I see.

401
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,000
Okay.

402
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,660
Then I'll trouble the Soldier

403
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,420
to come out for a fight.

404
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,190
Invite the Soldier over.

405
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,400
Tonight,

406
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,610
if you win the Soldier's approval,

407
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,730
you may compete tomorrow.

408
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,000
Cousin.

409
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:06,790
It's been a long time.

410
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,480
Why are you wearing a blindfold?

411
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,750
Are you blind?

412
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,370
Just a minor injury.

413
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Nothing serious.

414
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,340
[Auspice from the East]

415
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:24,930
See you at the arena tomorrow.

416
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:27,920
Okay.

417
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,920
Young people are

418
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,170
indeed hot-blooded and vigorous.

419
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,160
Just a small interlude.

420
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:39,110
Let's continue our banquet.

421
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:44,510
Cheers.

422
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,480
Who are you?

423
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,830
Judging from your swordsmanship,

424
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:21,680
miss, you're

425
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:24,200
a third-rate martial artist
in the alliance.

426
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:24,590
Miss,

427
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,790
how long have you been practicing
swordsmanship?

428
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:30,250
What's your relationship with the Soldier?

429
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,240
Why should I tell you?

430
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,030
You haven't practiced your swordsmanship

431
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,760
for more than a month, have you?

432
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,830
Your sword aura and inner breath

433
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,430
are just like the Soldier's.

434
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,150
I seem to...

435
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,660
have discovered a big secret.

436
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,010
What...

437
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,030
What secret?

438
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,550
You're not human.

439
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:55,160
Who exactly are you?

440
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,910
I can't sense your demonic aura.

441
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,440
Why don't you tell me

442
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,290
what kind of demon you are?

443
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:13,550
Fine.

444
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,440
I'll tell you.

445
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,200
I'm not a demon.

446
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,000
You're feistier than you look.

447
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,960
You're not thinking of

448
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,820
killing me to silence me, are you?

449
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,160
Fine.

450
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,540
I'll tell you another secret.

451
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:37,070
I'm the one...

452
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,720
who blinded the Soldier's eyes.

453
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:41,240
You...

454
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,350
You dare to hurt him?

455
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:45,640
What?

456
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,930
You're really going to kill me?

457
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:02,440
No need to fight.

458
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:03,590
He's not an enemy.

459
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,220
Young Master Fugui...

460
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,110
Aren't you blind?

461
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:08,830
How do you know it's me?

462
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,110
We crossed swords earlier.

463
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,640
Naturally, I know it's you.

464
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,350
Young Master Fugui,

465
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,070
do you know what he just said to me?

466
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:16,750
He said he's the one

467
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:17,750
who blinded you.

468
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,030
There's more to this matter.

469
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:21,230
He is indeed a friend.

470
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:23,960
In that case,

471
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,620
it's all a misunderstanding.

472
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,270
Fugui,

473
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,550
your girl's swordsmanship is

474
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,270
quite good.

475
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,750
Hey.

476
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:39,950
Don't talk nonsense.

477
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,680
Such a strong reaction.

478
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,830
You two

479
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:47,470
haven't gotten to
that stage yet, have you?

480
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,750
I...

481
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,510
I'm just

482
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:58,040
Young Master Fugui's maid.

483
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,840
Don't talk nonsense.

484
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:00,960
You should

485
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:03,990
learn to speak like a normal person now.

486
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,200
Then...

487
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:07,160
what are

488
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,640
the two of you, exactly?

489
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,270
Mind your own business.

490
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,270
How did things go?

491
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,030
It's all done.

492
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,270
I made an appointment with them

493
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,680
to meet by the river tonight.

494
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,740
Let's go there now.

495
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,110
What do you think?

496
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,470
What?

497
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,280
It's not for you.

498
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,720
You're the one who blinded

499
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,750
Young Master Fugui.

500
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,550
Who knows if you've poisoned it?

501
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,340
Young Master Fugui, here.

502
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,790
I already tried it.

503
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:00,750
Just drink it.

504
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,680
It's so cold even next to the bonfire.

505
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,080
I'll go move around a bit.

506
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,480
What are you doing?

507
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:26,510
Fugui,

You're so amazing!

skip on the water for so long?

514
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,840
Do you want to know...

515
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,550
our story?

516
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,720

00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:27,880
What barrier?

519
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:30,070
What "no outsiders" rule?

520
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,440
How exaggerated.

521
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,400
This lousy barrier—

522
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,110
I broke it

523
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,440
with ease.

524
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,610
The food is so plain.

525
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,920

Soldier,

529
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,790
why are you standing behind me

530
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,120
without making a sound?

531
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,790
Listening to sounds.

532
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,080
Listening to sounds?

533
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,140
You really aren't normal.

534
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,240
Ignore me.

535
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,370
I won't disturb you.

536
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,510
I just came in to look for something.

I'll leave once I find it.

Yes, yes.

540

the fastest every time.

You did that on purpose.

You saw through that?

545
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,000
Why do those sparring partners

546
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,200
take it so seriously?

547
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,920

I lived at

644

Wangquan Manor until I was 10.

645
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:18,570
I secretly became his friend
for half a year.

646

I don't know

647
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:22,790
if he made any other friends afterward.

00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,030

Since you are good friends,

653
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,440
why did you blind his eyes?

654
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,800
It's a long story.

655
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,280
I consented to it.

656
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:44,360
Not long after you transformed into
human form,

657
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,360
he came to me.

658
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:52,160
Come out.

659
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:58,930
That day,

660
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,000
you made a spinning stone skip

661
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,320
right in front of me.

662
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:04,910
Were you trying to tell me

663
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:06,630
that after seeing the world,

664
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,400
I still had to come back?

665
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,590
Although it's perfect for stone-skipping,

666
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,360
there are no lakes in the Western Regions.

667
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,820
I still never learned how.

668
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,680
It's been a long time,

669
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,590
Rumu.

670
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,590
I've returned it to its owner.

671
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:23,790
It's been a long time.

672
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,670
The reason I blinded his eyes

673
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,280
is that my friends' lives

674
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,680
are in my father's hands.

675
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,440
He used them to threaten me,

676
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,110
forcing me to use this filthy method

677
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,550
to ensure I could defeat him

678
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:35,920
at the Blue Sky Convention.

679
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,380
So I went to him in advance.

680
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:40,110
He asked me to blind his eyes

681
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,040
to keep my father satisfied.

682
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:44,160
And even if I hadn't done it,

683
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:45,800
my father would have used
other dirty means

684
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,930
against him anyway.

685
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,030
So,

686
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,610
we played along with my father,

687
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,150
taking advantage of the time he's pacified

688
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:55,280
to figure out how to rescue my friends.

689
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,400
Young Master Fugui

690
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,760
trusts you this much?

691
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:03,760
Your Fugui and I...

692
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:10,590
He hasn't received much affection.

693
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,480
So,

694
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,110
he will cherish it even more.

695
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:14,110
You talk too much.

696
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,070
Why haven't those raccoon dog demons
I asked you to find arrived yet?

697
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:17,710
He

698
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,110
sought us out to do work for him,

699
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:20,030
didn't give us a penny,

700
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:20,280
and...

701
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,960
and even threatened and intimidated us...

702
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,960
Aren't they here?

703
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,030
How can he do this?

704
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,410
You're having a little tea party here.

705
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,610
What's so good about roasted oranges?

706
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,000
Who... who's this?

707
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,920
Who are they?

708
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,030
He's blind?

709
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,550
Did you track that person?

710
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:35,630
Cut the crap!

711
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,560
Wh-Where's my braid?

712
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:41,550
Did you track the person?

713
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:42,750
Give me back my braid!

714
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,510
Oh,

715
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:46,360
so you didn't track him.

716
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:49,050
Little spider,

717
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,150
go burn it.

718
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:51,000
Oh.

719
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:51,590
Got it.

720
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,540
We tracked... we tracked him.

721
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,540
Why did you all come together?

722
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:59,090
Let me tell you,

723
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,360
we followed him all the way

724
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,840
to a place called Xiyun Hall.

725
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,000
He went in and never came out after that.

726
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,730
So that means

727
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,400
Xiyun Hall is very suspicious.

728
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,230
Suspicious, indeed.

729
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,510
Don't be

730
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:13,510
f-fooled by the name—

731
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,360
there are a lot of people

732
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:16,560
going in and out.

733
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:18,070
Besides,

734
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:18,970
let me tell you,

735
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,170
there must be

736
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,590
a cave there.

737
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:24,230
There's a cave in Xiyun Hall?

738
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,510
Yes.

739
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:28,230
And it's v-v-very big.

740
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,110
My father showed me

741
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,070
the place where they're imprisoned.

742
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:32,930
It's obviously

743
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:33,800
in a cave.

744
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,440
It should be that place.

745
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,230
Yes.

746
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,480
Th-That is the place.

747
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,960
Right there for sure.

748
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,840
Look, I've completed the task.

749
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:46,710
Please give me

750
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:47,630
my braid back.

751
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:49,360
I-I-I have to go home.

752
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,360
Well...

753
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,160
Mr. Piaopiao.

754
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:53,770
As the saying goes,

755
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:56,190
"When you help someone,
see it through to the end."

756
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:57,000
Could you please

757
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,330
take them there as well?

758
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:01,690
Then, when will this ever end?

759
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:02,400
Yeah.

760
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,340
Little spider.

761
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,030
Got it.

762
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,320
Go, go, go...

763
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,320
Fine, I'll go!

764
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:08,760
Why did I take on this task?

765
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,220
Gosh...

766
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:12,280
How far is Xiyun Hall from here?

767
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,410
I don't know about you guys,

768
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:16,320
but at my speed,

769
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,920
a round trip takes four... four h-hours.

770
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:36,590
Rumu,

771
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,840
you seem to have something on your mind.

772
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,640
This morning,

773
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,820
he forced me to take a pill.

774
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:43,230
He said

775
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:45,030
it would ensure I defeat you.

776
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:46,560
But I don't know what it was.

777
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:49,110
I have a bad feeling about it.

778
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:50,840
If I

779
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:53,080
do something out of line tomorrow,

780
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,920
don't hold back.

781
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,030
The world is vast,

782
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,440
I still have to find
a very important person,

783
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,040
and I don't want to die at all.

784
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:11,280
But if

785
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:13,170
something really goes wrong,

786
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:15,000
I still hope

787
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:17,390
I can die by your hand.

788
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,840
In my brief twenty-some years of life,

789
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,740
I don't have much I can't let go of.

790
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,130
There's only one thing
I want to ask of you.

791
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,230
If one day you meet a dragon demon

792
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:32,360
carrying a gourd etched with snowflakes,

793
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,280
please tell her

794
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:35,930
that I, Rumu...

795
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:38,920
never blamed her.

796
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:54,860
Master.

797
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,440
Wangquan Shouyi's men

798
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,880
have participated in
the Blue Sky Convention.

799
00:42:58,880 --> 00:42:59,840
Don't let

800
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:02,200
any of our men get involved.

801
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,490
Understood.

802
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:04,860
Master,

803
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:08,190
the Young Master and the Soldier
have known each other since childhood.

804
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:09,150
Do you truly believe

805
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:10,590
he can kill the Soldier?

806
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:19,440
Whether he can or not...

807
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:23,440
we'll find out tomorrow.

808
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,110
Rumu,

809
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,480
at tomorrow's Blue Sky Convention,

810
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,140
you and I will act separately.

811
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,430
You'll go participate in the Skill Contest
and stall for time,

812
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:44,030
while I'll

813
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,170
go to Xiyun Hall to save people.

814
00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:58,760
You must hold on until I return.

815
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:02,490
The matter you've entrusted to me

816
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,400
is still yours to complete.

817
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:07,440
Don't worry.

818
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:09,510
You won't die.

819
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,710
I won't let you die.
