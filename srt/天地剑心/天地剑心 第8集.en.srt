[Sword and Beloved]

2
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,400
[Episode 8]

3
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,510
A sword that's meant to slay demons

4
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,000
has somehow grown warm.

5
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,030
Wangquan Fugui has actually

6
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,190
fallen for a petty little demon.

7
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,430
Feelings make people weak.

8
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:18,030
Is my clone in the circle ready?

9
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,800
It's ready at any time.

10
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,280
Lady Feng?

11
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,170
Don't look at me like that.

12
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,560
Do you know

13
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,150
my senior will be in trouble
if you stay here?

14
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,350
You have two choices:

15
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:53,680
die

16
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,400
by my sword,

17
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,140
or leave right now!

18
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm dying anyway.

19
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,080
But there's still

20
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,710
one last thing I need to do.

21
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,360
I can't leave here yet.

22
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,010
What do you mean?

23
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,880
Lady Feng,

24
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,079
have you been to
the Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai?

25
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,000
Why are you asking that?

26
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,750
Just answer me.

27
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,480
Cut the crap!

28
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,750
I tried to get the antidote
from Madam Yin,

29
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,310
so

30
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,440
I took the Gu poison myself too.

31
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,680
I don't buy it.

32
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,790
You used such a foolish way
to get the antidote?

33
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,680
I'm just

34
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,030
a lowly spider demon.

35
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,360
I couldn't think of a better way.

36
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,030
But…

37
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,280
but I've done

38
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,680
all I could.

39
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,200
I have no regrets now.

40
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,800
Her spiritual power is heavily depleted,

41
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,170
but the poison in her body
is clearly gone.

42
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,720
Let me see how long you little spider
can keep pretending.

43
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,310
Lady Feng,

44
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,120
how much longer…

45
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,400
how much longer do I have left?

46
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,920
At most,

47
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,950
three days.

48
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,240
Three days?

49
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,390
So soon.

50
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,000
Looks like…

51
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,409
looks like I can't finish my embroidery.

52
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,480
Lady Feng,

53
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:43,510
have you ever been to
the Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai?

54
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,040
Can you take me there,

55
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,720
Lady Feng?

56
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,159
Let go!

57
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,720
Why ask that?

58
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,090
Because Young Master Fugui

59
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,560
always wants to know

60
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,090
what that place looks like.

61
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,360
Before I die,

62
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,690
I want to embroider that place for him.

63
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,390
If you take me there,

64
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,750
I can finish it sooner.

65
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,720
Aren't you afraid

66
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,880
I'll drop you mid-flight

67
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,410
and shatter you to pieces?

68
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,920
You won't.

69
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,160
You may be strict,

70
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,560
but you have a soft heart.

71
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,310
Lady Feng,

72
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,750
please, just once, take me there,

73
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,480
will you?

74
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,190
You've been cured of the poison.

75
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,310
Liar!

76
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,760
Don't try to look all pitiful before me.

77
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,720
Humans and demons walk different paths.

78
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,750
If you keep staying here,

79
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,240
you'll only bring my senior trouble.

80
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,950
I'll report you to Master!

81
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,120
Lady Feng.

82
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,310
Lady Feng!

83
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,980
The poison in me

84
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,480
has been neutralized?

85
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,430
This is all
just that little spider's ploy.

86
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,159
Feng Tingyun, don't be fooled.

87
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,510
She's a demon.

88
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,800
Once she's dead,

89
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,330
Senior Fugui will come back to his senses.

90
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:00,680
But

91
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,050
he's lived so lonely all his life.

92
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,290
Only lately has he begun to look happy.

93
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,040
Do I really…

94
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,360
have to do this?

95
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,720
Master.

96
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,000
Tingyun?

97
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,200
Why are you here?

98
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,480
You want to see me?

99
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,310
Master.

100
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,840
Is something troubling you?

101
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,510
Why are you hesitating?

102
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,950
That's not like you at all.

103
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,170
You know you can tell me anything.

104
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,680
Tingyun,

105
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,190
you want to see me?

106
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:10,990
Senior Fugui,

107
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,690
do you remember the first time we met?

108
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,160
I was nine.

109
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,000
My village was slaughtered by demons.

110
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,720
You saved me.

111
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,590
Of course I remember.

112
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,140
You rushed into the Palanquin

113
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,510
the moment it landed,

114
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,510
all covered in blood.

115
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,570
I was ridiculous, wasn't I?

116
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:41,750
No.

117
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,159
Not ridiculous at all.

118
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,450
You clearly told me where the demons were.

119
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,520
You were very brave.

120
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,360
Only you would think that way.

121
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,390
I think I fell for you right then.

122
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,490
I followed you every day in secret,

123
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,370
just to watch you practice your sword

124
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,050
and to copy your handwriting.

125
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,240
I dreamed that one day

126
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,720
I'd be as strong as you

127
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,360
and fight by your side.

128
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:22,750
Senior Fugui,

129
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,430
I know

130
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,510
you don't like me.

131
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,000
But what I don't understand is…

132
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,430
why her?

133
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,600
Why that frail spider demon?

134
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,120
Tingyun,

135
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:43,240
it's not what you think.

136
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,720
Every life in this world deserves respect.

137
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:48,720
I just…

138
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,570
didn't want her to be killed like that.

139
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,070
That's not it.

140
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,600
If it were really just about saving her,

141
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,750
if it were only sympathy,

142
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:01,720
then why didn't you

143
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,630
ever feel the same for me?

144
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,130
If I hadn't felt sympathy for you,

145
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,960
would you even be here now?

146
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,800
Senior Fugui,

147
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,790
I just want to know one thing today.

148
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,270
Do you…

149
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,270
like her?

150
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,310
Senior Fugui,

151
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,000
a demon

152
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,260
will always be a demon.

153
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,510
Humans and demons walk different paths.

154
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,240
Moreover, you're the Soldier.

155
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,330
There's no future between you and her.

156
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,550
I'll handle it

157
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,080
in my own way.

158
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,510
I'm leaving.

159
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,160
Senior Fugui.

160
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,030
Why aren't you ever afraid

161
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,010
I'll go tattling to Master?

162
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,140
Because you're Feng Tingyun.

163
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,640
Your sword essence is

164
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,750
free as the wind

165
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,060
and graceful as drifting clouds.

166
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,000
Master,

167
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,000
I like someone.

168
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,840
But he doesn't like me back.

169
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,000
Then, Tingyun,

170
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,200
how do you plan to handle it?

171
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:02,790
Let go,

172
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,270
or

173
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,670
keep chasing him?

174
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,630
Yeah.

175
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,610
Whether Senior Fugui likes me or not,

Go ahead.

183
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,390
You never took the antidote.

184
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,440
You gave it to me.

185
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,600
Right?

186
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,150
Yes.

187
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,350
Then what about your poison?

188
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,250
The poison in my body

189
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,360
has already been neutralized.

190
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,390
You solved the problem yourself

191
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,720
and saved your brother.

Then, Young Master Fugui,

195
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,000
shouldn't you

196
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,510
reward me with some candy?

197
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,620

How does it feel
to fail at the finish line?

208
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,620
It's all the Soldier's fault.

help me obtain the Dragon Spine Sword

211
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,330
to wash away this shame?

212
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,150
I want the entire Yiqi Alliance

213

to kneel before me.

214

of course.

216
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,000
But once you have the Dragon Spine Sword,

217
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,240
what will you do with it?

218
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,320
I'll make Wangquan Hongye and his son

219
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,670
pay the price.

220

But what Madam wants
is for Wangquan Fugui

Why did you go to Silk Cave
without approval?

Why didn't you slay the demons there?

wiping out the lesser demons in Silk Cave

234
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,160
would've been easy.

Why did you do something unnecessary?

236
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,490
It's said in the Demon Realm

Their lives

245
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,970

Compassion

271

00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,440
what about her?

349
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,270
She had a dream—

350
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,130
a beautiful one.

351
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,640
But that dream
shouldn't become her chains.

352
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,840
The deeper the dream,

353
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,330
the tighter the chains.

354
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,680
That's why I hope

355
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,200
she wakes up

356
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,160
and pursues her own path.

357
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:56,510
So,

358
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,060
you're going to send her away?

359
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,740
When the time is right.

360
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,530
Young Master Fugui,

361
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,800
I once dreamed of seeing

362
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:15,040
mountains and rivers and watching

363
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:17,110
snow fall on the desert with you.

364
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:18,160
That was

365
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,820
probably the biggest dream
I had for the future.

366
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,180
But I also understand—

367
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:24,510
I can't

368
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,550
be with you forever.

369
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,640
Humans and demons walk different paths.

370
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,750
If you keep staying here,

371
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,270
you'll only bring my senior trouble.

372
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:35,070
I will report you to Master!

373
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,590
There's a distinction
between good and evil.

374
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:41,990
And humans and demons aren't so different.

375
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,960
If I could wish for one thing,

376
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,510
I'd want

377
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,660
to create a small world
where humans and demons live together.

378
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,070
There,

379
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,590
humans and demons can be equal

380
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,110
and respect and love each other.

381
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,370
When that day comes,

382
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,810
Young Master Fugui

383
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,100
will be happy for me, won't he?

384
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,010
Rumu, let's talk about you.

385
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,110
Did you find the person
you were looking for?

386
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:12,880
Me?

387
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,010
I don't have much to say.

388
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,070
Forgot your own dying words

389
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,720
by the river, huh?

390
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:20,450
"If you ever

391
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,180
meet a dragon demon
with a snowflake gourd,

392
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,530
tell her this for me:

393
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:25,590
Rumu

394
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,400
never once

395
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,680
blamed her."

396
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,350
So cheesy.

397
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,350
No way I said that.

398
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,160
No way.

399
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:35,960
Mm.

400
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:36,920
Indeed.

401
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,830
Fugui, look at that cloud.

402
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,720
Doesn't it look like a dragon?

403
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,350
Nope.

404
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:45,960
If you talk like this,

405
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,900
we can't chat anymore.

406
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:50,550
Fine. It does.

407
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:53,400
Okay.

408
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,790
As you know,

409
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,510
my father went to the Western Regions.

410
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,590
For some reason,
he clashed with the dragon clan

411
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:01,450
and killed a lot of dragon demons.

412
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,790
One day,

413
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,410
a descendant of a dragon demon

414
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,790
kidnapped me.

415
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,400
Pretty lady,

416
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:23,510
why is this tree

417
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,160
half-dead and half-alive?

418
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:26,750
Did you tie that bell

419
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:27,790
on the branch?

420
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:28,960
It looks nice.

421
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,110
Why doesn't it ring, though?

422
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,200
How old are you?

423
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,310
13 years old.

424
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:38,920
I'm short now,

425
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,760
but my parents are both tall.

426
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,030
I'll be tall too.

427
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,000
Then you should realize

428
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,080
you've been kidnapped.

429
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,200
Yeah, I know.

430
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,590
And I also know you're super powerful.

431
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,320
You could kill me with one slap.

432
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:52,480
Then why…

433
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,070
Am I

434
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:58,350
too excited?

435
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,160
Should I be acting

436
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,310
more scared and nervous?

437
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,600
Did you bring that water

438
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,720
for me to drink?

439
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,250
You're talking so much,

440
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,100
so I guess you're not thirsty.

441
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,440
So not only are you pretty,

442
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:19,960
but you've also got a kind heart.

443
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,890
Just so you know,

444
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,800
if I have an asthma attack later,

445
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,160
don't panic.

446
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,870
It only lasts a little while.

447
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,750
I'll be fine.

448
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,470
Don't be afraid.

449
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,140
She was so unlucky to have kidnapped you.

450
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,070
Exactly.

451
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,750
She was so unlucky.

452
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,280
She kidnapped me

453
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,720
to trade for her mother's dragon scale.

454
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,790
But she didn't know

455
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,680
my father didn't care if I lived or died.

456
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,320
He even wanted to kidnap her.

457
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,510
So,

458
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,350
she took me and ran.

459
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:03,830
And then?

460
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,680
Then I

461
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:08,040
shamelessly followed her around.

462
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,160
She might

463
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,790
look fierce,

464
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,510
but deep down,

465
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:14,770
she was softer than anyone I had ever met.

466
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,080
Every time I had asthma,

467
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,000
she saved me.

468
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,290
She never said it out loud,

469
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:21,920
but I know—

470
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,420
she cared about me more than anyone else.

471
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,400
And slowly,

472
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,720
I started to have

473
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,240
different feelings for her.

474
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,700
And just like that,

475
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:35,790
we wandered together

476
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:36,960
for over ten years.

477
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,200
But how did you practice swordsmanship?

478
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,110
I chased her.

479
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,070
She got annoyed

480
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,020
and hid from me,

481
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,230
so I kept chasing her.

482
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,400
But she was too powerful,
and I couldn't catch up.

483
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,000
So,

484
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,590
I started training.

485
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,070
Unlike you,

486
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,090
I had no sword manuals.

487
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,490
I learned by imitation.

488
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,270
In the desert,

489
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,110
I watched how bugs took flight,

490
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,400
how cacti breathed,

491
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,240
and how lizards walked.

492
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,560
When the demon wind came,

493
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,830
I watched how bugs stayed grounded.

494
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,000
And from that,

495
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,030
I found my sword path.

496
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,000
So your Heart of Sword

497
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:20,170
comes from observing all things.

498
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,720
Half right.

499
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,350
I'll tell you…

500
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,400
the rest someday.

501
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,750
So in the end,

502
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,000
you two still got separated?

503
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,530
Why else do you think

504
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,900
I keep looking for her?

505
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,960
But it's okay.

506
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,630
I'll find her no matter what.

507
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,510
I'm off.

508
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:43,840
All right.

509
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:45,550
Take care.

510
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,240
Fugui,

511
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,920
the only "impossible" in this world

512
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,720
is the one we place on ourselves.

Yes.

00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:40,110
Then why do you look

523
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,070
unsettled, Fei?

524
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,380
The people from Xiyun Hall

525
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,960
were nearly all wiped out.

526
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:48,230
Thanks to Young Master Fugui's advice,

527
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,370
we found the person

528
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,040
who traded with Xiyun Hall.

529
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,750
He said

530
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:54,110
Chakuwa

531
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,330
was sold to him by a powerful demon.

532
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,640
A powerful demon?

533
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,200
Yes.

534
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,720
Who is it?

535
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,790
This demon was extremely cautious,

536
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,720
using a disguise during the trade.

537
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:04,950
We couldn't even tell

538
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,680
if it was male or female.

539
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,720
But the middleman

540
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,830
was clever too.

541
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:12,520
He left a tracking talisman on them

542
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,810
and found out where they were from.

543
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,680
Where?

544
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,650
Peach Village in Dingling Mountain.

545
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,440
That village is in a valley,

546
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:28,360
still part of
the Yiqi Alliance's territory.

547
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:31,960
The valley was shrouded
in miasma for years.

548
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,020
No one lived there.

549
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:35,250
I sent scouts to investigate.

550
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:38,830
They've just

551
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,400
sent word back.

552
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,270
Fei,

553
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,360
what's wrong this time?

554
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,880
Why are you hesitating?

555
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,640
Master,

556
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:53,680
do you remember Zhang Qi, the Black Sword?

557
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,680
Of course.

558
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:59,720
He's the heir of Zhang Zheng,
the former master of the Zhang family.

559
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,720
When he was young,

560
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,080
he had great insight.

561
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,550
Back when I lost

562
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,110
my Heart of Sword outside the circle
and returned,

563
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,440
he offered me guidance.

564
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:11,590
The miasma in that valley
in Dingling Mountain

565
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:12,720
has been dispelled.

566
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,240
A village has been built there

567
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,200
where humans and demons live together.

568
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,480
And the village chief is Zhang Qi.

569
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:27,840
[Peach Village]

570
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,170
You're back.

571
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,210
Mr. Zhang, you're back.

572
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,000
Yeah.

573
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,190
Mr. Zhang, you're back.

574
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:37,820
[Zhang Qi, the Black Sword,
master of the Zhang family]

575
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,550
Yeah.

576
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,010
Mr. Zhang, you're back.

577
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,880
Don't mention it.

578
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:43,550
Thank you.

579
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,880
Mr. Zhang, you're back.

580
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,160
Yeah.

581
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,110
Mr. Zhang, you're back!

582
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:52,830
Jiu.

583
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,830
Be careful.

584
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,530
[Jiu, a raccoon dog demon]

585
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,600
You're finally back.

586
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,720
Mr. Zhang, you're back.

587
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,000
Yeah.

588
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,720
Have you eaten yet?

589
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,480
I just made some rice cakes. Have a taste.

590
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:01,750
Thanks!

591
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:02,350
Nope,

592
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,200
he hasn't eaten.

593
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:05,960
Give all the food to me.

594
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,220
Give all the food to me.

595
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:08,720
Mr. Zhang,

596
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,720
these are balsam flower seeds.

597
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,520
Lady Qingli is sure to love them.

598
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:13,350
Thank you.

599
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,160
Give it to me. I'll carry it.

600
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,510
You must be exhausted, Mr. Zhang.

601
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:17,720
Go get some rest.

602
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,550
Step aside, everyone.

603
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:21,160
-Let Mr. Zhang go back to rest.
-I'll head up first.

604
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,000
Be careful.

605
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:32,880
[Qingli, a butterfly demon]

606
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,200
Qingli.

607
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:46,400
Qingli!

608
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,400
Mr. Zhang is back!

609
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,240
Look.

610
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:01,030
Here are lots of rice cakes
made by Granny Shui,

611
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,400
and flower seeds too.

612
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:04,880
These rice cakes look…

613
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,880
really tasty.

614
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,030
Except for the balsam flower seeds,

615
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:10,030
the rest is yours.

616
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,440
Really?

617
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,160
Then I won't refuse.

618
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:21,190
I'll leave you two alone now.

619
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,000
See you.

620
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,480
Qingli.

621
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:39,480
You've been gone for half a month.

622
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:43,310
This time,

623
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,440
I can only stay for one night.

624
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,640
I have to leave again tomorrow morning.

625
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:52,720
But don't worry.

626
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:53,720
I've nearly wrapped up

627
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,070
my family affairs.

628
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,400
When I go back this time,

629
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,510
I'll give back the Black Sword

630
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:59,440
and step down as the family master.

631
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,450
Then I'll never

632
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,640
leave you again.

633
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,400
Really?

634
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,310
When have I ever lied to you?

635
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,400
I'll be back

636
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,950
before the night peach blossoms bloom.

637
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:11,640
Okay.

638
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:17,030
I'll wait for you.

639
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,880
Young Master Rumu has left?

640
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:29,590
Yeah.

641
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,920
He's actually

642
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,640
a very good person.

643
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,530
Young Master Fugui,

644
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,920
try the peanuts.

645
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,120
They're really good.

646
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,110
If we made them into candy,

647
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,300
it'd be delicious!

648
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:48,640
What will you do next?

649
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:54,480
Actually,

650
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:58,270
last night, I overheard your conversation

651
00:33:58,550 --> 00:33:59,880
with Young Master Rumu.

652
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,440
Young Master Fugui…

653
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,800
Young Master.

654
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:06,890
It's Mr. Fei.

655
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,510
I'll take my leave now.

656
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:16,670
Mr. Fei.

657
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:17,710
How come you didn't bring

658
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,440
a new mission scroll this time?

659
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:23,070
Am I that grim in your eyes?

660
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,360
I don't just bring you new missions.

661
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:26,880
Here—

662
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,480
this is

663
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:30,840
what you requested.

664
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,840
See if it meets

665
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,969
your requirements.

666
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,770
Thank you, Mr. Fei.

667
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:40,840
This time, I didn't come

668
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,969
to tell you to slay any powerful demon.

669
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,020
But there is

670
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,110
a task.

671
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,400
The evil medicine, Chakuwa,

672
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,659
traced back to Zhang Qi's Peach Village,

673
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,000
but that doesn't mean

674
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,710
Zhang Qi himself made it.

675
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,000
That's true.

676
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,280
But both humans and demons
live in Peach Village.

677
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,740
It's the biggest suspect.

678
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:06,840
Zhang Qi is the son of Zhang Zheng.

679
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,030
And I believe

680
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:11,230
you know who Zhang Zheng is.

681
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,230
I do.

682
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:17,440
He was Father's sworn brother.

683
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,030
Yeah.

684
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,940
He died outside the circle

685
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,480
over 20 years ago.

686
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:23,880
That was

687
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,970
one of Father's deepest regrets.

688
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:31,400
It's not that Master is

689
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,930
covering for an old friend.

690
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,260
It's just that he and I

691
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:37,320
both know Zhang Qi,
the Black Sword, very well.

692
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,120
He would never

693
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:40,030
do such a thing.

694
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:41,920
So,

695
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,110
Master wants you

696
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:44,840
to go to Peach Village

697
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:46,440
and bring Zhang Qi back.

698
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,550
Understood.

699
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,210
I won't let anything happen to him.

700
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:56,630
I know,

701
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,320
Master is

702
00:35:58,590 --> 00:35:59,720
too strict with you,

703
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,960
but some pain...

704
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,690
he can only keep it bottled up inside,

705
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,470
unable to say it out loud.

706
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,480
Last night,

707
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,550
he was really upset.

708
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:16,030
I hope this time you'll return in triumph.

709
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,320
Don't…

710
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,030
disappoint him again.

711
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,080
Don't worry, Mr. Fei.

712
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:29,800
I know who I am.

713
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:31,440
And I know

714
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,220
why I was brought into this world.

715
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,070
Good.

716
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,590
Then I'll take my leave.

717
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:05,240
Young Master Fugui,

718
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,510
you've got a new mission?

719
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:10,410
You still haven't answered my question.

720
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,110
Just now, you asked me

721
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,440
what I plan to do next.

722
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:16,920
Actually,

723
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,870
I haven't figured it all out yet.

724
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:19,770
But for now,

725
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,080
I'll go find my younger brother.

726
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,510
As for the future,

727
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,550
I'm still not sure.

728
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:30,150
Then before you've found your path,

729
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,890
come with me
to Peach Village for the mission.

730
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:41,280
Lady Feng.

731
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:50,400
She went out.

732
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,000
Why are you here?

733
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,280
Lady Feng,

734
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,720
I came to bring you some clothes.

735
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,510
Mind your own business.

736
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,280
You're apparently up to no good.

737
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,840
Just get out!

738
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:27,920
Lady Feng,

739
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:29,320
I made

740
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:32,550
this new outfit for you by hand.

741
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,960
I hope you like it.

742
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,590
Stop.

743
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,070
This is

744
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,150
a lotus?

745
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:55,030
Yes.

746
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:02,840
I've gotten over Senior Fugui.

747
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:04,190
But that doesn't mean

748
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,520
you two can be together.

749
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,250
Don't worry, Lady Feng.

750
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:12,360
I've already decided to leave.

751
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:13,280
I won't

752
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:14,880
come back again.

753
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,130
I've thought carefully

754
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,440
about what you said.

755
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,880
My staying here would indeed

756
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,280
cause Young Master Fugui trouble.

757
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:22,960
Lady Feng,

758
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,280
please,

759
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,440
stay well.

760
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,450
Take good care of yourself.

761
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,440
I'm leaving.

762
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:38,800
Qingtong.

763
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,280
If only you weren't

764
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:45,840
a demon.

765
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,090
But if I weren't a demon,

766
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:56,670
maybe I never
would've met Young Master Fugui.

767
00:39:58,510 --> 00:39:59,360
Am I right?

768
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,300
In this world,
only power commands respect.

769
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:16,630
Only if I find the Dragon Spine Sword

770
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,110
can I crush the entire Wangquan family

771
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,480
beneath me.

772
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:26,070
Master, your courage is unmatched.

773
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,360
You're one in a million.

774
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,690
You mustn't give up now.

775
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:38,320
Lu,

776
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,280
I know

777
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:45,150
you followed me
into the Sword Tomb willingly.

778
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,900
That unfilial son of mine…

779
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,550
he'd rather see me dead.

780
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,320
Only you…

781
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:59,400
are truly loyal to me.

782
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,920
I will definitely help you

783
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:08,360
make it out alive.

784
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,070
Then serve me

785
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:16,110
with your whole heart, will you?

786
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:11,590
The Black Fox was right—

787
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:14,360
a true dragon craves blood.

788
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,550
You want blood?

789
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:19,200
I'll give you blood.

790
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:21,510
Wangquan Hongye,

791
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,070
I don't believe

792
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:26,360
I'll keep losing to you.

793
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:38,670
Quan Jingting,

794
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,880
your powers are gone.

795
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,800
Are you ready for the Dragon Sigh Sword

796
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,150
to enter your body

797
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:46,670
and penetrate your tendons?

798
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,880
It'll be a long and painful process.

799
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:53,400
You'll slowly become
half-human and half-demon.

800
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Those who stand in my way have to die.

801
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:59,320
Those who hold me back
have to be abandoned.

802
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:02,320
Do it now!

803
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,070
Remember your promise:

804
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,840
when the time is right,

805
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,760
push the Soldier

806
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:11,320
into darkness.

807
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:25,800
Raise the Palanquin.

808
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,190
We set off for Peach Village
in Dingling Mountain.
