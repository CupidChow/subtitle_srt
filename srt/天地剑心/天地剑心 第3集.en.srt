[Episode 3]

3
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,400
She's too badly injured

4
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:58,680
to be cured.

5
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,780
I can only revive her by refining my power

6
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,600
with this winged spirit pearl.

7
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,150
Perhaps...

8
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,190
this is God's will.

9
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,710
I'm not dead?

10
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,000
Young Master Fugui,

11
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,520
did you save my life?

12
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,280
Young Master Fugui,

13
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,360
why do you look so pale?

14
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,840
Are you injured?

15
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,630
I'll get you a towel.

16
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:47,630
No need.

17
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,190
I have a question for you.

18
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,720
What would you like to know?

19
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,630
Ask away.

20
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,040
Do you want to take a human form?

21
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,520
A human form?

22
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,750
Of course I do!

23
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,470
If I can transform into a human,

24
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,280
I'll become an invincible demon

25
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,080
that can cultivate much faster.

26
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,960
That way,

27
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,490
I can protect my younger brother.

28
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,560
There are usually over 100 little spiders
like you in a brood.

29
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,960
Don't you have other siblings?

30
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,160
My other siblings...

31
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,120
They all died.

32
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,000
Only No.12581 and I survived.

33
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,400
Though I'm a tiny low-grade spider demon,

34
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,430
I still

35
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,400
care about certain things

36
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,150
and certain people.

37
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,210
Young Master Fugui,

38
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,190
could you please help my brother out?

39
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,150
I'm begging you.

40
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,750
Please, Young Master Fugui.

41
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,890
Young Master Fugui...

42
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:42,940
Remember this:

43
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,700
you should make

44
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,700
your dreams come true on your own.

45
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,040
Make my dreams come true

46
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,710
on my own?

47
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,250
Young Master Fugui,

48
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,520
it's so cold outside today.

49
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,680
How am I able to fly?

50
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,150
Young Master Fugui,

51
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,160
you're amazing.

52
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,070
What pearl is this?

53
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,950
How beautiful.

54
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,370
It doesn't matter.

55
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,010
But this pearl can transform you
into a human.

00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,480
I'm a human now!

71
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,390
Young Master Fugui, look!

72
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,730
Young Master Fugui,

73
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:48,720
these two human legs don't seem

74
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,430
able to give me as much support
as my eight spider legs could.

75
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,290
Stand up first.

76
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,960
Then see if you can walk.

77
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:54,510
Oh.

78
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,680
This is not a dream, is it?

79
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,190
Young Master Fugui,

80
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,120
pinch me now.

81
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,030
Hurry!

82
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,930
Go back in the room.

83
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,240
Young Master Fugui,

84
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,830
are you leaving for the morning practice?

85
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,690
I can go with...

86
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,200
Young Master Fugui,

87
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,760
go ahead and don't worry!

88
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:25,000
I'll get used to walking with two legs.

89
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,890
Now I finally know how the world looks

90
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,510
from this angle.

[Wangquan]

92
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,680
Master of the Quan family

93
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,140
from the Western Regions,

94
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,040
Quan Jingting, has arrived!

95
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,420
Dismissed, all of you.

96
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,310
Yes!

97
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,630
My dear cousin,

98
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,930
I don't think I came at the right time.

99
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,360
Is this

100
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,890
the morning practice?

101
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,000
It's been a long time
since I last practiced sword skills here.

102
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,059
I wonder if any progress has been made

103
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,990
in Wangquan Swordsmanship.

104
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:14,650
Wangquan Swordsmanship
is said to be the best in the world.

105
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,240
But it doesn't seem impressive now.

106
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,680
Isn't there anyone competent
in the Wangquan family now?

107
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,630
My dear cousin,

108
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,630
I haven't seen you for years.

109
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,240
You look haggard now.

110
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,550
Master Quan, you were expelled

111
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,950
from the Wangquan family
over a decade ago.

112
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,380
Then you changed your surname to "Quan."

113
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,360
Today, at the Wangquan Manor,

114
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,320
your role is a guest.

115
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,150
A guest

116
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,920
should show a guest's courtesy.

117
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,640
I, Quan Jingting,
from the Quan family in the border area,

118
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,000
am glad to meet you,
Chief of Yiqi Alliance.

119
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,750
Master Quan,

120
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,150
are you in town
for the Blue Sky Convention?

121
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,270
Of course.

122
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,530
The Blue Sky Convention

123
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,030
is a tryout for young people.

124
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,360
Where is your son Quan Rumu?

125
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,870
Rumu will go to the Li Residence himself

126
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,670
for the Blue Sky Convention.

127
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,840
Send Master Quan and other visitors

128
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,640
to the guest quarters for a rest.

129
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:45,870
Transferring spiritual power to her

130
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,930
must've caused quite an impact on me.

131
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,070
I was being too careless.

132
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,960
Young Master Fugui, you're back!

133
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,840
I've got used to walking with two legs.

134
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,360
Look!

135
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,970
Young Master Fugui,

136
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,670
what's going on with you?

137
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,360
I'm fine.

138
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,690
I just need to regulate my breathing.

139
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,240
The water is a bit dirty.

140
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,080
I'll take it out.

141
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,080
No need.

142
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,010
This dress is not a good fit for you.

143
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,800
Today, I finally saw
how good the Soldier could be.

144
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,280
Though he hasn't mastered
the Heaven-and-Earth Strike,

145
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,120
he's already stronger

146
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,210
than most others in the world.

147
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,840
Rumu won't stand a chance

148
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,600
of defeating him.

149
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,610
Master, do you have a plan?

150
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,600
Go tell that ungrateful son of mine

151
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,000
that he must win the Soldier

152
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,440
in the Blue Sky Convention,

153
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,360
even by devious means.

154
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,030
Yes.

155
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,200
I hear
that when regulating their breathing,

156
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,400
cultivators would enter
the Primary Circulation Phase.

157
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,550
Don't worry, Young Master Fugui.

158
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,480
I'll absolutely protect you well.

159
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,630
No.12580.

160
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,360
I'm here!

161
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,230
How did you reach this place?

162
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,790
No.12580,

163
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,510
I didn't expect you
to have truly taken a human form.

164
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,320
Did the Soldier
help you with the transformation?

165
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,720
He has so much trust in you

166
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,360
that he feels safe
to sit unconsciously before you.

167
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,510
You can kill him now.

168
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,080
Attack his Baihui acupoint.

169
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,910
That's the fatal weakness of all mankind.

170
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,200
You've transformed into a human.

171
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,960
You should know where Baihui acupoint is.

172
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,670
Take this.

173
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,240
Go.

174
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,120
Stick this needle deep into him.

175
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,650
Then he'll definitely die.

176
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,210
My job is to spy on the Soldier,

177
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,750
not to assassinate him.

178
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,360
Besides,

179
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,240
I've completed my task.

180
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,390
Mistress's ultimate goal is revenge.

181
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,240
If you kill the Soldier,

182
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,630
we'll be given the greatest credit.

183
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:26,510
You good-for-nothing,

184
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,240
will you do it or not?

185
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,370
I'll go if you don't.

186
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,240
No way!

187
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,240
You've indeed become disloyal to Mistress.

188
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,120
Are you taking the Soldier's side now?

189
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,720
I'll report it to Mistress right away.

190
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,450
She'll kill your brother then!

191
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:38,790
What are you doing?

192
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,630
Let me out!

193
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,200
Was it a thunder strike?

194
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,600
Now, I'll show you who is

195
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,670
a real good-for-nothing.

196
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,450
My goodness!

197
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:51,720
I feel so dizzy.

198
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:57,960
I'm telling you,

199
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,030
as long as I stay with Young Master Fugui

200
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,290
and keep cultivating,

201
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,480
it won't be long

202
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,270
before I become able
to rescue my brother on my own.

203
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,000
Mistress won't let it happen.

204
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,320
You and your brother

205
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,720
will die a tragic death!

206
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:10,550
You...

207
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,200
T-This...

208
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:15,530
It...

209
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,340
Since when did you become so good?

210
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,000
Let me out!

211
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:22,960
Let me out!

212
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,240
Just stay in.

213
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,040
Senior Fugui!

214
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,600
Are you in there?

215
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,000
It's Lady Feng.

216
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,349
How odd.

217
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,440
This is impossible.

218
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,310
How did Senior Fugui
lose so much spiritual power?

219
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:14,960
That Raccoon Dog Demon King

220
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,960
was no match for Senior Fugui at all.

221
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,480
Quan Jingting couldn't have caused
this much harm either.

222
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,280
Senior Fugui,

223
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,109
are you okay?

224
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:25,690
I'm fine.

225
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,750
Why did you never tell us

226
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,810
you had lost so much spiritual power?

227
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,950
But breaking that formation

228
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,200
was like giving Quan Jingting
a giant slap in the face.

229
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,530
You did a wonderful job.

230
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:43,770
Tingyun,

231
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,840
you're free to go if that's everything.

232
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,270
I know you haven't

233
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,730
fallen in love with me yet.

234
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:53,680
But it's okay.

235
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:54,790
I still think

236
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,480
in Yiqi Alliance, I'm the only one

237
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,940
who's good enough for you.

238
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,110
If one day,

239
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:03,240
someone who suits you better shows up,

240
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,030
I'll quit trying.

241
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,200
Senior Fugui,

242
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:15,640
have you seen

243
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,550
that little spider demon again,

244
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,680
the one that delivered letters for me?

245
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,440
No.

246
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,810
I promised to set her free that day.

247
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,140
She has never come to me again after that.

248
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,120
Actually, she's quite fun.

249
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,660
Too bad that she's a demon.

250
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,160
Humans and demons take different paths.

251
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,160
These two species can't be friends.

252
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,510
I'm clear about that.

253
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:56,960
Senior Fugui,

254
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,170
take a good rest.

255
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,390
Stop looking.

256
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,290
You fear her that much?

257
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,370
Judging from what Lady Feng said,

258
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,310
she definitely hates for a spider demon

259
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,400
to stick with you.

260
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:33,200
By the way, Young Master Fugui,

261
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,720
are you feeling better now?

262
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,160
Yes.

263
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:36,880
Oh.

264
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,680
That's great.

265
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,160
Young Master Fugui,

266
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,750
do I look better now as a human

267
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,600
than as a spider before?

268
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,440
Young Master Fugui,

269
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,750
does being quiet mean

270
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,080
your answer is "yes"?

271
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,580
Well, you don't think I look good.

272
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:13,450
Anyway, at least I don't seem ugly

273
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,110
in your eyes now, right?

274
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,070
So much noise.

275
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,480
Oh.

276
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:24,640
Young Master Fugui,

277
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,520
thank you for saving my life.

278
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,310
I swear I'll repay you.

279
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,450
I just didn't want you
to be trampled to death.

280
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:35,310
The wish to protect someone
motivated you to cling to life.

281
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,970
I wanted to help. That was all.

282
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,760
What's your plan for the future?

283
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,720
Young Master Fugui,

284
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,160
can you teach me a set of sword skills?

285
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,420
I hope to get stronger,

286
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,000
so as to protect those

287
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,970
I want to with my own strength.

288
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,240
It isn't hard to teach you
a set of sword skills.

289
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,500
But the dress you're in

290
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,710
is truly inappropriate.

291
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:08,200
Huh?

292
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,090
Young Master Fugui,

293
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:38,070
usually, on a snowy day like this,

294
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,880
even demons such as myself
wouldn't go out.

295
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,310
Wind, frost, rain, and snow

296
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,790
are all part of nature.

297
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,440
Severe weather helps with your study.

298
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,440
Is there anything

299
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,280
I can learn from the snow?

300
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,030
Young Master Fugui

301
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,880
is amazing!

302
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,830
Young Master Fugui,

303
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:50,830
what do you think?

304
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,240
Lift your right arm higher.

305
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,570
Align it with the sword.

306
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,070
Oh.

307
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,000
How strange.

308
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,090
Young Master Fugui,

309
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:11,350
why am I still not able
to release sword energy?

310
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,880
It takes more practice.

311
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,590
Okay.

312
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,030
Young Master Fugui,

313
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:37,790
look!

314
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,200
Such beautiful sunset glows.

315
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,890
Young Master Fugui, look at that!

316
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,720
They will disappear

317
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,570
in just a short moment.

318
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,920
They'll be gone in a short moment.

319
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,200
What a pity.

320
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:21,550
Young Master Fugui,

321
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:22,510
look over there!

322
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:23,790
A flock of birds!

323
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,570
What a lovely scene.

324
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,750
These birds

325
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,080
came earlier today than usual.

326
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,720
Young Master Fugui

327
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,290
has never once seen the world outside.

328
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,160
He'd even deeply cherish

329
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:57,350
the presence

330
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,750
of sunset glows and birds.

331
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,840
Those people
confine Young Master Fugui here,

332
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,830
making him cultivate every day.

333
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,460
But he's a human after all.

334
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,610
He feels lonely too.

335
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,200
This is odd.

336
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,640
Why am I feeling so angry?

337
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:16,880
Well,

338
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,880
I must do something
for Young Master Fugui.

339
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:42,650
♪ The wind secretly makes a home
on an unknown page of the story ♪

340
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:46,960
♪ As you flip a page,

00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:48,320
You claim your son Rumu to be able

509
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,760
to slay the Soldier.

510
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:52,490
Where is he now?

511
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,070
A hero is a product of his time.

512
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:01,270
That proverb is true.

513
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:04,070
But you have to show us

514
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,440
how your son Rumu

515
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:08,190
can manage to kill the Soldier.

516
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,480
Don't act so recklessly.

517
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,290
Young Master Fugui...

518
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,780
What are you trying to say?

519
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:46,150
Nobody knows how tender you are.

520
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,600
Tenderness is not what a Soldier needs.

521
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,230
Also, nobody knows

522
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:54,840
what you really want, Young Master Fugui.

523
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,280
Then what do you think I really want?

524
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,440
You long to see the scenery outside,

525
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,240
and to get out of that Palanquin.

526
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,560
Mr. Fei said you could

527
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:04,850
take a horse carriage,

528
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:06,530
instead of the Palanquin,

529
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,330
to the Blue Sky Convention.

530
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,000
That way, you can see the world outside.

531
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,020
Who would've known...

532
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,490
that you'd become temporarily blind?

533
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,550
How useless of me.

534
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,690
I can't protect anyone.

535
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:37,480
Why don't you be my eyes?

536
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:48,670
Though Young Master Fugui
can't go outside as he pleases,

537
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:49,510
I believe

538
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,960
he will see

539
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,560
the real Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai
one day,

540
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:56,220
and that he won't be this lonely forever.

541
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:58,150
Before that,

542
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:59,510
if possible,

543
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,710
I'd like to weave more prettier scenery

544
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:04,040
for Young Master Fugui.

545
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,230
Now, let me be

546
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:08,590
Young Master Fugui's eyes.

547
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:34,150
Sit tight.

548
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,010
Young Master Fugui,

549
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:43,000
yesterday,

550
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,700
I spent a whole night making this ribbon.

551
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:48,130
It's a perfect match for your outfit.

552
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,380
Young Master Fugui

553
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,740
deserves the best of everything.

554
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:55,910
Didn't you promise to be my eyes?

555
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,280
Oh.

556
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,000
Let me see.

557
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,010
Young Master Fugui,

558
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:06,710
those flying south in a line

559
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,360
are Datian birds, right?

560
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,280
Yes.

561
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,550
A young one just fell behind.

562
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:15,110
But it's catching up now.

563
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,860
How lovely this is.

564
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,190
They're all free and soaring.

565
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,150
I'm so happy to be

566
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,670
your eyes.

567
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:39,830
Everything outside must be beautiful,

568
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:40,800
because

569
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:42,760
you sound very happy.
