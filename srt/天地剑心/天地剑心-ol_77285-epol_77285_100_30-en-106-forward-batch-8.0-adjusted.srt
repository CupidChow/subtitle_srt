[Sword and Beloved]

2
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:58,700
[Episode 30]

3
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,400
We made it.

4
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,040
Miss Long.

5
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,590
Thank you.

6
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,560
Where is Rumu?

7
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,790
Celestial Master...

8
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,760
He's still with Gulizan.

9
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,490
Let's go.

10
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,970
Celestial Master,

11
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,210
may misfortunes never befall you.

12
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,079
The peace of the Western Regions

13
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:40,280
needs to be maintained by the four of us.

14
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:49,140
Celestial Master?

15
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,290
What happened?

16
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,360
Nothing.

17
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,030
I...

18
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,360
I was being too anxious.

19
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,630
What kind of stunt is he pulling?

20
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,190
We can't let this situation go on.

21
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,310
I've heard that in the Western Regions,

22
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,030
there's a mouth-to-mouth
energy transferring method.

23
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,360
It may help him restore spiritual energy

24
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,310
and wake him up.

25
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,840
Good job,

26
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,990
my dear disciple.

27
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,630
Poor Dog,

28
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:23,560
are you sure of that?

29
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,470
Yes, I'm sure.

30
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:27,150
Master and I read about the secret art
of the Western Regions.

31
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,010
The book does record
this method.

32
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:33,910
Miss Long,

33
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,400
don't members of the Dragon Clan
all have good medical skills?

34
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,329
Why don't you...

35
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,150
Miss Long,

36
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,520
at this point,

37
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,160
there isn't a better option.

38
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,240
What’s wrong, Miss Long?

39
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,800
You two…

40
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,120
I got it.

41
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,649
Poor Dog, come out with me.

42
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,570
Why do you have to be so nosy?

43
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,870
Stop looking at them!

44
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,750
I'm not!

45
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:23,850
Weiyun,

46
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,800
what

47
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,560
was ringing just now?

48
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,550
Nothing was ringing.

49
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,180
You heard it wrong.

50
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,780
Was that so?

51
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,490
But I heard it

52
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,630
quite clearly.

53
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,650
Now that you've recovered,

54
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:44,710
I should get going.

55
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,750
Weiyun!

56
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,630
Weiyun!

57
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,610
Where are you going?

58
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,720
The task I promised to tackle with you
has been completed.

59
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,120
Of course I'm leaving for
where I should be.

60
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,190
Miss Long,

61
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,450
where are you heading?

62
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,970
Are you leaving right now?

63
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,000
Yes.

64
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:07,560
To celebrate the victory against Gulizan

65
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,750
and the fact

66
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,870
that we can continue defending
the Western Regions,

67
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,390
Xueyang is holding a party
at the military camp tonight.

68
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:13,830
Right.

69
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,510
Won't it be nice to drink,
sing, and watch the moon

70
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,210
together?

71
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:18,870
Yeah, Weiyun.

72
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,720
Don't you want to go with me

73
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,920
and make friends with the like-minded?

74
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,430
That's right, Miss Long.

75
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,720
We've just built good rapport
between each other.

76
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,190
Why not stay and celebrate

77
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,480
with us tonight?

78
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:30,870
Please stay.

79
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,600
-Come on!
-Come on!

80
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,800
Fill up your glasses.

81
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,720
To the four of us

82
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,360
defeating Gulizan with concerted efforts

83
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,950
and safeguarding the peace
of the Western Regions.

84
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:18,830
Cheers!

85
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,480
Cheers!

86
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,680
Cheers, Miss Long.

87
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,340
Bottoms up.

88
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,070
Weiyun,

89
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,060
I've never seen you

90
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:42,430
smile so happily.

91
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,870
Given General Li's utter hospitality,

92
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,510
I surely must enjoy this party.

93
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,040
Don't read too much into it.

94
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,090
In addition,

95
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,270
after tonight,

96
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,120
you'll have to stop following me.

97
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,190
How can I stop?

98
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:04,720
Come on.

99
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,190
Let's drink.

100
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:06,950
Come on, have a drink.

101
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:07,430
Let's drink.

102
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,160
Drink up.

103
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,470
There's a hot pot here?

104
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,680
What a great atmosphere tonight!

105
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,070
Why not dance with us?

106
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,160
Let's do it!

107
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,890
Come with me!

108
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:17,680
Guys!

109
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,040
Move!

110
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,120
Boss is joining us!

111
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:19,750
I can't dance.

112
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,600
-Go. What do you mean you can't dance?
-Miss Long, come along.

113
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,360
No more dawdling. Hurry!

114
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,820
I've never danced before.

115
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,630
Let's go!

116
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,180
Come on.

117
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,120
Let's

118
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,240
dance!

119
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,080
Weiyun,

120
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,690
I saw a bracelet on the way here.

121
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,150
I thought it'd definitely

122
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,150
look great on you.

123
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,770
Weiyun, in your heart,

124
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,630
I'm never the only one.

125
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:48,330
But I won't forget each and every word

126
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,790
you've said.

127
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,650
Are you alright?

128
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:39,920
Young Master Fugui,

129
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,670
suppose

130
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,270
we become stronger

131
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,860
through cultivation,

132
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,030
but only end up

133
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,150
losing the person we care most about.

134
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,630
Then what's the meaning

135
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,960
of our cultivation?

136
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,030
As Zhang Qi once said,

137
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,510
making a compromise

138
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:22,290
with this chaotic world
shouldn't be the purpose of cultivation.

139
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:23,440
Qingtong,

140
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,030
rebuild the Peach Village here.

141
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:29,530
Let all the helpless souls adrift
in troubled times

142
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,270
have a place to call home.

143
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:46,750
This is a proclamation from the governor
of Qianji City to the world—

144
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,360
This city invites

145
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:50,140
[Edict]

146
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,290
those of insight and vision to come

147
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:54,050
and inaugurate a prosperous era
where humans and demons coexist.

148
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,960
From today on,

149
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,200
all the humans and demons

150
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,720
that choose to settle in Qianji City

151
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,080
will be considered comrades

152
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,540
and protected by the city.

153
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,140
With Master by Miss Qingtong's side,

154
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,560
Qianji City will surely become
the best city of all times.

155
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,010
Poor Dog.

156
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,390
We must work hard too.

157
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:17,390
Yes,

158
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,360
My Love!

159
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,910
Aren't you silly?

160
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:32,180
[Edict]

161
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,730
Master,

162
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,790
Senior Fugui and Qingtong
have made huge contributions.

163
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:33,670
They not only found

164
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,750
the culprit
behind the Night of Frost's Descent

165
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,880
and thus solved Elder Shouren's case,

166
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:38,910
but also

167
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,600
destroyed the Myriad Blight Formation
in time

168
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,060
to prevent a catastrophe.

169
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,000
It takes actual actions to create

170
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,880
a prosperous and peaceful era.

171
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,390
It has to be like this,

172
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:55,550
starting from a small city.

173
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,550
As long as

174
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,840
there's hope in the heart,

175
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,850
even a single spark
can start a prairie fire.

176
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,080
Master,

177
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,230
put your mind at ease.

178
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,010
Everything is looking up.

179
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,090
Young Master Fugui.

180
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:42,840
Yes?

181
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,420
It's late at night.

182
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,450
Still working on the compass?

183
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,980
I'm doing okay.

184
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,810
Did you drink alcohol?

185
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,650
Is the smell too strong?

186
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,240
I did drink a bit.

187
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,440
Are there no humans or demons

188
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,250
migrating to Qianji City?

189
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:17,910
There are.

190
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,080
It's just not that many.

191
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,040
Every now and then,
there comes a new resident.

192
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,600
One is a boar demon

193
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,400
that weighs over 100 kilograms.

194
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,530
He eats 20 steamed buns in one meal.

195
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,910
Everything takes time.

196
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,960
Zhang Qi spent seven years

197
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,170
building up the Peach Village.

198
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,840
To build Qianji City

199
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,090
into a shelter like the Peach Village,

200
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,180
there's still a long way for you to go.

201
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,030
Got it.

202
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,330
Young Master Fugui,

203
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,720
how's it going with the study
of the magic tool

204
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,320
that can track the Black Fox?

205
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,190
I guess I've made some progress.

206
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:01,120
If this compass is successfully developed,

207
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,180
it'll detect the Black Fox's energy.

208
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,680
But before that,

209
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,860
there's a long way for me to go too.

210
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,360
Hangover cures

211
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,790
are all bitter.

212
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,830
You solved the problem yourself

213
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,200
and saved your brother.

214
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,320
Qingtong,

215
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,120
your efforts weren't in vain.

216
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,580
Then, Young Master Fugui,

217
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,600
shouldn't you

218
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,080
reward me with some candy?

219
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,330
The candy has indeed

220
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,880
made me feel better.

221
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,290
The mission was already completed.

222
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,870
Yet you're still following me.

223
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:41,550
Why?

224
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:43,670
I'm here

225
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,000
to verify one thing.

226
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:49,150
I know

227
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,150
the Dragon Bone Bell rings

228
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,000
when you fall in love.

229
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,630
Previously, at the Li Army's camp,

230
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,150
I heard the bell ring.

231
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,760
Very clearly.

232
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:06,330
You heard an imaginary sound.

233
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:08,690
I don't believe it.

234
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:09,650
How about this?

235
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,490
Let me take a look at the bell

236
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:12,730
for confirmation.

237
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,609
Why would I let you?

238
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:18,109
You dare not do it.

239
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:21,690
Because I said it right, didn't I?

240
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,109
Do you hear it?

241
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:37,830
It's not ringing.

242
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,470
Will you just give up?

243
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,730
It shouldn't be like this.

244
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:05,790
I know what the problem is!

245
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,240
This must be it—

246
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,070
I don't look cool enough
in this posture right now.

247
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,000
Give me a moment.

248
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,210
What about now?

249
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:27,830
Has the bell rung?

250
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,440
I'll adjust my posture.

251
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,440
One, two, three!

252
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,400
Now,

253
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,920
it should be ringing.

254
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,070
T-The bell

255
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,160
must be broken.

256
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,200
Or perhaps...

257
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,510
it has been affected

258
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,510
by today's

259
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:08,960
bad weather.

260
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:09,880
Right?

261
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:12,720
Right.

262
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:17,590
Weiyun,

263
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,640
look!

264
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,240
Auspicious iridescent clouds!

265
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,480
So beautiful.

266
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,880
It's said

267
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,200
that such clouds come with good news.

268
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,830
Does it mean...

269
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,310
we...

270
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:01,640
Anyway,

271
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,840
I've thought it through.

272
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,400
From now on,

273
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,110
I will never part with you again.

274
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,770
It was my fault for stupidly

275
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,590
saying

276
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,530
that I'd leave you alone

277
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:15,880
and set you free.

278
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,750
I was being foolish.

279
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,640
I said that nonsense

280
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,170
in the moment of silliness.

281
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:22,550
Weiyun...

282
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,510
Weiyun!

283
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,270
Weiyun!

284
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,160
I will wait till the bell rings again!

285
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:35,400
I'll keep waiting and waiting

286
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,590
right here!

287
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:03,750
-You...
-I...

288
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:06,920
You...

289
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,780
Weiyun, you...

290
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:11,960
What's up?

291
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,030
T-There are shooting stars.

292
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:16,800
Come with me!

293
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,960
Weiyun, look.

294
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,450
A shower of shooting stars.

295
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:33,050
Oh, right.

296
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:35,110

How dare you run?

414
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,990
Chongming bird demons
and members of prestigious families,

415
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:53,850
why are you chasing after a child?

416
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:55,750
That boy

417
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,400
is the son
of a Chongming bird demon and my senior.

418
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:00,570
He shouldn't live!

419
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,350
We the Chongming bird demons
are highly talented.

420
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,640
How can we let humans
take advantage of us?

421
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,100
It's against nature to let

422
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,790
this half-human half-demon live!

423
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:10,590
Nature?

424
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:13,160
Don't try to frame it on the nature.

425
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:15,470
Girl demon,

426
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:16,890
do you have a death wish or what?

427
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:19,600
Qianji City is a shelter
for humans and demons in need.

428
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,830
Killings are to be avoided here.

429
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,830
If you don't want to lose your lives,

430
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,440
scram now.

431
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,070
You are

432
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,440
the Qianji City Lord?

433
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,920
So what if I am?

434
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,400
You cowards!

435
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:37,310
Powerful though Qianji City is,

436
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,280
it's not invincible, is it?

437
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,920
Guys, charge!

438
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,810
Young Master Fugui,

439
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:05,360
let's take the boy back.

440
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:13,960
Little Bun,

441
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,440
cry if you want.

442
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,480
I can't cry.

443
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,240
When I cry,

444
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,640
blood appears.

445
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,920
Then they'll recognize me.

446
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:32,990
It's indeed a feature

447
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,490
of Chongming bird demons.

448
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,430
Tell me.

449
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,510
Where is your father?

450
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:43,750
He...

451
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,680
was beaten

452
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,740
to death by bad people.

453
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,120
Sir,

454
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,790
why do they dislike me?

455
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:55,590
Is it because I don't behave well enough?

456
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:56,440
I swear

457
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,310
I'll eat carrots from now on.

458
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,830
I won't be picky anymore.

459
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,420
You've behaved well enough, Little Bun.

460
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,430
Those bad guys just enjoy

461
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,070
bullying you.

462
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,250
Go to sleep.

463
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,550
Don't worry.

464
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,440
I'm here for you.

465
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:16,510
But I'm scared.

466
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:18,310
Sir,

467
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,240
can you

468
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,270
sing me to sleep?

469
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,590
I'm not

470
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,640
much good at singing.

471
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,110
How about I recite

472
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,360
some lines from a sword manual instead?

473
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:34,830
Okay.

474
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,940
"Spread your arms like a phoenix
to intimidate the enemy."

475
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,500
"Aim for the shoulders
and attack from both sides."

476
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,370
“Make your sword move
like dancing snowflakes.”

477
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:48,280
"With that you can fend off
many an opponent."

478
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,750
"Charge with an elegant gait
as you launch a fatal strike "

479
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:55,280
"Blades will meet in a shower of sparks
as bright as moonlight."

480
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,160
Qingcheng,

481
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,830
do you see?

482
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,510
Our ideal of a home

483
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:24,750
is being built little by little.

484
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:26,920
I will try my best.

485
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:29,070
The coexistence of humans and demons

486
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,000
won't be a dream.

487
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,310
I didn't expect Young Master Fugui

488
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:43,400
to lull the boy to sleep by reciting lines

489
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,530
from a sword manual.

490
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,620
Is this nerve-soothing soup?

491
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,200
Yes.

492
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,160
Chongming bird demons
get frightened easily.

493
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,960
I'm afraid
regular nerve-soothing soup won't do.

494
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,270
Look,

495
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,590
tomorrow,

496
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,650
I'll go collect some other herbs.

497
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,200
Okay.

498
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:42,590
Master.

499
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:50,240
The medicine prescribed by Dr. Xin

500
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,070
is indeed very potent.

501
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,280
I can't believe I just fell asleep.

502
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,640
Is it time to set out

503
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,550
for the selection of a new alliance chief?

504
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,350
Yes, Master.

505
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,550
But I have a report to make now.

506
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:10,440
Go ahead.

507
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,550
A few days ago,

508
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:14,790
the young master saved a kid
that's half human and half demon.

509
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:15,440
The news

510
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,370
has been spread to both realms.

511
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:32,480
Is he

512
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:35,030
still in Qianji City?

513
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,440
Yes.

514
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:42,230
The peach blossoms in the Peach Village

515
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,790
have been truly deeply rooted

516
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,030
in his heart.

517
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:48,680
Master,

518
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,160
since you've decided

519
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,070
to pass the position of chief
to a promising young member

520
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,240
of Yiqi Alliance,

521
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:55,610
why not ask the young master to come back?

522
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,160
Those stubborn old men
who were against him

523
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,310
have all gone by now.

524
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,880
I have

525
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,200
devoted my entire life to Yiqi Alliance.

526
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,070
But, Shuang,

527
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:16,920
right now,

528
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,070
I just want to be a selfish father

529
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:24,750
and let Fugui

530
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,830
grow the peach blossom in his heart.

531
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:30,920
Isn't it nice?

532
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,510
Maybe not meeting

533
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:42,350
with each other again is the best ending

534
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:44,080
for him and me as father and son.

535
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,110
Soldier,

536
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,340
do you admit your mistake?

537
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:13,640
I did nothing wrong.

538
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,880
If he doesn't admit,

539
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,480
keep him hanging until he does.

540
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,010
Father, don't blame yourself.

541
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:26,150
I've long anticipated and prepared

542
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:28,409
for everything that has happened today.

543
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,710
I just hope you can understand

544
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,030
the Way I deem right.

545
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:37,230
Fugui,

546
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:41,070
it seems our last parting
has turned out to be forever.

547
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,190
I may not

548
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,760
live to see

549
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,219
the day you practice the Way
with your sword.

550
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,760
[In the spring of that year,]

551
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,000
[Wangquan Hongye
the chief of Yiqi Alliance]

552
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,150
[voluntarily stepped down
from his position]

553
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:56,949
[and let the young members
compete for it fairly.]

554
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:59,590
[After 3 contests in
physical strength, skills, and willpower,]

555
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:01,550
[Dongfang Yuechu stood out]

556
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:03,320
[and became the new chief.]

557
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:06,630
[Wangquan]

558
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,890
[Meanwhile,
the legendary mysterious Qianji City]

559
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:10,510
[became a real shelter
for humans and demons in trouble.]

560
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,110
Quan Jingting,

561
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,920
Gulizan lost.

562
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,230
Madam Black Fox is very disappointed.

563
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:20,920
What?

564
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,960
Madam has thought of me again,

565
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,360
her indispensable aide?

566
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,190
Quan Jingting,

567
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:34,730
Madam is giving you a chance
to make up for your mistake.

568
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:38,110
Though Gulizan's body and soul
have vanished,

569
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:39,920
she did leave something behind.

570
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,190
You'll regain your power with its help.

571
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,110
But you must

572
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:45,760
clear all the barriers

573
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,280
for Madam.

574
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:53,110
How thoughtful and farsighted Madam is.

575
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,960
I promise I won't let her down.

576
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,340
Whether I can change my fate or not

577
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,550
depends on this one move.

578
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:43,960
As I expected,

579
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:48,760
you can't recreate
a complete Myriad Blight Formation,

580
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,320
but you can

581
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,150
assist me in absorbing power.

582
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:58,550
The power is not enough, though.

583
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,590
I'll take you to the Dragon Cave

584
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,420
where you can take in
plenty of dragon power.

585
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:09,150
I, Quan Jingting,

586
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,440
will rise again.

587
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:19,070
My rebellious son...
