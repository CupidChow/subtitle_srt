[Sword and Beloved]

2
00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:05,430
[Episode 17]

3
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:11,560
I, Fei Tianqing,

4
00:02:12,509 --> 00:02:15,350
the fifth-generation steward
of the Wangquan Manor,

5
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,680
am not competent enough

6
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,790
and can only walk you so far, Master.

7
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,360
I didn't fail
the Wangquan family after all.

8
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:42,960
Rumu,

9
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,590
she's the one you kept telling me about—

10
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,400
Long Weiyun.

11
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,870
Young Master Fugui,

12
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,620
your spiritual power…

13
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,000
is running low.

14
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,430
It took me so much effort

15
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,630
to get
this body you care so much about.

16
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,560
How could I possibly give up?

17
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,120
You once said

18
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,190
you would never bow to threats, right?

19
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,360
Well then,

20
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,079
what if I use this body

21
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,840
to kill your woman

22
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,430
and your cousin?

23
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,300
Would there still be

24
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,680
no hatred
in your heart?

25
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,540
Rumu!

26
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,810
Young Master Rumu!

27
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,350
Since your cousin

28
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,380
can't feel the hatred in his heart,

29
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:15,520
then…

30
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,170
you'll die first!

31
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:22,520
Weiyun,

32
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:25,020
if this were in the past,

33
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,090
I wouldn't have minded if you killed me.

34
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,520
But not this time.

35
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:52,560
Fugui.

36
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,040
Rumu,

37
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,520
I've only trapped her temporarily.

38
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,550
To purge the Black Fox's demonic aura
from her body,

39
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,880
she has to do it herself.

40
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:10,900
Let me try.

41
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,630
I'll use my spider silk
to enter her consciousness

42
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,830
and try to wake her up.

43
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,390
Be careful.

44
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:17,920
Okay.

45
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,920
Don't worry.

46
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,480
Long Weiyun.

47
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,190
Long Weiyun.

48
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:00,890
Long Weiyun.

49
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,590
I don't want to owe you.

50
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,310
I don't want to owe you.

51
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,430
I don't want to owe you.

52
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,750
I don't want to owe you.

53
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,430
I don't want to owe you.

54
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,720
Long Weiyun.

55
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,600
I don't want to owe you.

56
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,360
Long Weiyun.

57
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,390
Long Weiyun…

58
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,710
I don't want to owe you.

59
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,480
Oh no.

60
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,480
In her consciousness,

61
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,310
I can't touch her.

62
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,510
Quan Rumu,

63
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,870
I've searched
the Human and Demon Realms both

64
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,730
and still found no way to save you.

65
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:55,600
Why?

66
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,750
I don't want to owe you.

67
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,210
Long Weiyun,

68
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,090
Young Master Rumu isn't dead.

69
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,310
He's right outside.

70
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,480
If you come out with me,

71
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,630
you'll see him.

72
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,159
Long Weiyun.

73
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,210
Long Weiyun.

74
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,080
Qingtong,

75
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,600
time is running out.

76
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,730
Wake her up quickly.

77
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,870
"Having basked in morning dew,

78
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,360
Rumu could die at dusk without regret."

79
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,000
Rumu?

80
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,750
Young Master Fugui.

81
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,240
Yes?

82
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,430
What does this mean?

83
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,250
Why is
Young Master Rumu's

84
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,950
name on it?

85
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,310
"Having basked in morning dew,
one could die at dusk without regret."

86
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,110
It's like these little flowers—

87
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,240
once the most beautiful rain
has touched their petals,

88
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,440
it no longer matters how long they live.

89
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,140
Young Master Rumu wrote this?

90
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,430
So,

91
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,750
this line is

92
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,800
about his story?

93
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,750
Quan Rumu...

94
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,120
I don't want to owe you.

95
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,950
I don't want to owe you.

96
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,000
"Having basked in morning dew,

97
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,110
Rumu could die at dusk without regret."

98
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,390
"Having basked in morning dew,

99
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,510
Rumu could die at dusk without regret."

100
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,750
"Having basked in morning dew,

101
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,510
Rumu could die at dusk without regret."

102
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,360
"Having basked in morning dew…"

103
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,310
"Having basked…"

104
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:43,000
"Having basked in morning dew…"

105
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,680
"Rumu can die…

106
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,789
at dusk without regret."

107
00:08:49,909 --> 00:08:50,640
Long Weiyun.

108
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,850
Long Weiyun.

109
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,080
Who are you?

110
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,600
What does this poem mean?

111
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,120
"Having basked in morning dew,

112
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,960
one could die at dusk without regret."

113
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,690
Long Weiyun,

114
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,770
Young Master Rumu was never dead.

115
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,790
What's more,

116
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,120
he never once hated you.

117
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,390
Morning dew…

118
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,150
Rumu…

119
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,870
He actually never hated me?

120
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,670
How could there be such a fool
in this world?

121
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,750
Long Weiyun.

122
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:47,970
Your love and hate

123
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,800
shouldn't be controlled by someone else.

124
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,200
I am Long Weiyun, a True Dragon.

125
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:18,840
How could I let

126
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:22,590
an evil creature like you
decide who I hate or love?

127
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:08,390
Black Fox,

128
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,720
you're not

129
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,470
escaping today.

130
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,250
This is impossible.

131
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,150
I'm a clone of Madam,
born from pure hatred.

132
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,120
I have no physical form.

133
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,920
How could you possibly catch me?

134
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,910
Are you her only clone

135
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,320
in the circle?

136
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:30,030
Why would I tell you Madam's secret?

137
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,600
I know what you're thinking.

138
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:34,150
You want to save

139
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:37,010
that cold and heartless father of yours,
don't you?

140
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,000
How laughable.

141
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,840
The world has failed you,

142
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,870
and you still want to turn back?

143
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:47,030
You're such a fool.

144
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,480
Wangquan Fugui, listen well.

145
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,960
Those who love are destined
to be let down.

146
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,270
Only hatred

147
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,510
is eternal.

148
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,750
Wangquan Fugui,

149
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:17,150
you can't escape from Madam.

150
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:47,960
Well,

151
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:49,480
look.

152
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,030
It's almost dawn.

153
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,200
Lately,

154
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,070
every time I fall asleep,

155
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,630
I'm afraid

156
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,410
I won't see the sun rise again.

157
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,300
Weiyun,

158
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,960
you'll watch the sunrise

159
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,150
with me, won't you?

160
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,390
You always told me

161
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,170
to keep moving forward.

162
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,890
Since that's the case,

163
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,270
tell me—

164
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:20,670
how did

165
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,180
the Black Fox take over your body?

166
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,030
And why

167
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,620
did you come to Luming Valley?

168
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,380
Does it really matter?

169
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,960
It does.

170
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,480
I wanted to bring you back to life.

171
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,810
I didn't want to owe you.

172
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,930
I've traveled all over
the Human and Demon Realms,

173
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:45,260
but every healer I saw said
the same thing—

174
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,690
you were beyond saving.

175
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,240
They say,

176
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,000
don't force what fate has not allowed.

177
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,360
My asthma—

178
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:55,790
if not for you,

179
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,750
I wouldn't have lasted long anyway.

180
00:13:58,910 --> 00:13:59,630
Quan Rumu,

181
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,220
remember this:

182
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,630
you can die from asthma

183
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,050
but not from trying to save me.

184
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,030
Later,

185
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,740
that evil creature came to me.

186
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,630
It said there was a way to save you.

187
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,330
Since you and Wangquan Fugui are related,

188
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,480
if I took his sword meridian

189
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,700
and used it
to reconnect your broken meridians,

190
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,840
you could live.

191
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,150
And you believed such a lie?

192
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:40,320
Everyone in the dragon clan
is trained in medicine.

193
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,790
The moment it said it,

194
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,240
I knew it was true.

195
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,600
It's just
I'd never thought of it before.

196
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,360
You know me.

197
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,080
You know

198
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,670
I'd never accept that.

199
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,270
Of course I know.

200
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,120
But deep down,
a voice told me

201
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:03,720
that maybe

202
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,320
I could kill that person

203
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,780
and force you to accept it.

204
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,080
Maybe...

205
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,460
I could finally repay everything
I owe you.

206
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:14,440
And from then on,

207
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,600
we'd be even.

208
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,000
That's how...

209
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,340
that evil thing took over my body.

210
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,630
Weiyun,

211
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:37,720
as you know,

212
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:38,630
I…

213
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,820
I know what you want to say.

214
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,750
You never once resented me.

215
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,490
Everything you did for me...

216
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,240
you did willingly.

217
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:53,360
But Quan Rumu,

218
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,030
by now you should know

219
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:57,910
what your deranged father

220
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,390
did to my mother.

221
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,600
The depth of my hatred for him

222
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:04,230
is matched only by the pain

223
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,120
your kindness causes me.

224
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,960
Some rifts in this world

225
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,030
just can't be bridged.

226
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,030
So, Rumu,

227
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:24,440
let me go

228
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,600
and move on.

229
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,120
I owe Wangquan Fugui a debt.

230
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,390
My dragon scale is proof.

231
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,790
He may ask one favor of me.

232
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,310
No matter what it is,

233
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,600
I will see it done.

234
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,330
Young Master Fugui,

235
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:54,910
do you think

236
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,000
the knot between them

237
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,160
could be untied if Quan Jingting

238
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,440
were dead?

239
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,500
There's another way to resolve this.

240
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,350
But the time isn't right yet.

241
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,320
Fugui.

242
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:15,000
I'll help you send the Black Fox back.

243
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
You must never
return

244
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,260
to the Wangquan Manor.

245
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,480
What suppresses and binds the Black Fox

246
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,339
is the power of my Dongfang Blood.

247
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,619
Once it leaves my control,

248
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,200
you won't be able to suppress it.

249
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:28,270
Fine.

250
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,109
Then send the Black Fox

251
00:17:30,109 --> 00:17:31,510
near the Wangquan Manor.

252
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:32,829
Leave the rest

253
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:33,680
to me.

254
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,720
Young Master.

255
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,109
Young Master.

256
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,460
-Mr. Fei?
-I finally found you.

257
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,050
Mr. Fei?

258
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:40,569
What's wrong?

259
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,480
Young Master,

260
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,480
there are a few words
I must say to you alone.

261
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,550
Young Master,

262
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,720
I finally saw you again.

263
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,590
Mr. Fei,

264
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,790
what happened to you?

265
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,510
Mr. Fei!

266
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,750
Master...

267
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,030
Mr. Fei,

268
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,000
don't talk yet.

269
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,640
I already know.

270
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,680
Young Master,

271
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:20,560
the sword...

272
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,880
take it.

273
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,110
Young Master,

274
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,270
I

275
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,720
won't make it.

276
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,070
Mr. Fei,

277
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,110
that's nonsense.

278
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,310
Hang in there.

279
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:15,590
Young Master,

280
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:20,070
don't blame Master.

281
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:24,270
He has his own burdens to bear.

282
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,070
I understand.

283
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,350
Good.

284
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,400
Don't be too hard on yourself.

285
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:39,000
Even with countless burdens,

286
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,750
Madam,

287
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,030
Master,

288
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,640
and I

289
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,550
all just want you…

290
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:59,720
to find happiness in the end.

291
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,720
I've always known—

292
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,880
you care for me the most.

293
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,750
The spring flowers
on the hills are so fragrant.

294
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,200
The sorbet in summer is sweet.

295
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,070
Autumn fruits are all over the mountain.

296
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:28,830
And in winter,
nothing beats a pot of warm wine.

297
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,680
All these things...

298
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,830
Young Master,

299
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,830
you must

300
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,960
try them all.

301
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,270
Young Master Fugui,

302
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,640
y-you were so well-fed

303
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,350
when you were little.

304
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,480
Why have you

305
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,270
become so thin?

306
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,480
Mr. Fei,

307
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,720
since I was little,

308
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,720
you've always cared for me the most.

309
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,200
In this life, I have no way to repay you.

310
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,700
So in the next life…

311
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,110
let me serve you well.

312
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:18,830
Fugui,

313
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,720
we're close to the manor now.

314
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,900
Give that evil thing to me.

315
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,560
I can keep it under control.

316
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,650
Will you come back?

317
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,280
Of course I will.

318
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,280
I will come back.

319
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:50,790
No, you won't.

320
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,200
You just want to go back
and die with Quan Jingting.

321
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,950
That way, Long Weiyun could move on,

322
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,550
and you'd pay for Quan Jingting's sins

323
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,680
with your own life.

324
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,680
Am I right?

325
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,110
But Rumu,

326
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,270
you're his son,

327
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,990
and you're also my dear cousin.

328
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,560
None of this is your fault.

329
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,270
Fugui,

330
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:19,680
you…

331
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,070
He's noisy.

332
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,280
I've sealed his acupoints.

333
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,420
Keep a close eye on him.

334
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,440
Young Master Fugui,

335
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,590
I know I can't go with you.

336
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,590
But you're going there alone…

337
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,350
Don't worry.

338
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:44,200
I've already contacted
the Li Family of Peach Garden.

339
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,160
They've rallied
several prestigious families.

340
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,510
They'll be here soon.

341
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:50,850
Qingtong,

342
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,240
after I leave,

343
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,370
take Rumu to the Cold Pool first

344
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:55,500
and then return here

345
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,880
to meet up with me.

346
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:04,920
Young Master Fugui,

That's right.

518
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,510
The Yiqi Alliance cannot tolerate
such a threat.

519
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,280
Right.

520
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,590
He burned his life
with his spiritual blood.

521
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:28,590
His heart blood is already drained.

522
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:29,920
Do you

523
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:31,750
have any conscience?

524
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,480
Chief,

525
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:35,730
just now, we were blinded by lies,

526
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,800
believed Quan Jingting's slanders,

527
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,760
and wronged you.

528
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,480
But

529
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,670
it's because Quan Jingting was possessed
by the Black Fox

530
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,440
that such chaos erupted.

531
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,840
If one day,

532
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:48,400
as the rumors say,
the Soldier himself

533
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,360
is possessed by the Black Fox...

534
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,150
The Soldier

535
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,700
will never be possessed by the Black Fox!

536
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,880
Not today.

537
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,070
But what about tomorrow?

538
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,000
Or the day after?

539
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,230
If one day,

540
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,930
the Soldier does turn to the Black Fox,

541
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:03,400
who among us here today

542
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,000
could possibly resist
his Heaven-and-Earth Strike?

543
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
All of you

544
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,670
turned against the Soldier
when countless swords

545
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:10,730
pierced his heart.

546
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,360
That's why you're scared now.

547
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:12,760
You...

548
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,560
Everyone…

549
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:19,070
what the Soldier has done today

550
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,360
restores honor to the Chief's name.

551
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,190
It is touching

552
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,150
and commendable.

553
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:26,320
But what Master Ximen said

554
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,440
has a point.

555
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:31,850
We can't ignore
Third Young Master's prophecy.

556
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,840
The Soldier has now unleashed
the Heaven-and-Earth Strike.

557
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,150
Chief is his father,

558
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,230
so his feelings are understandable.

559
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:39,590
But

560
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,620
as the Chief of the Yiqi Alliance,

561
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,920
you should put

562
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,960
the good of all

563
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:54,720
before family ties.

564
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,760
Chief, you should put the good of all

565
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,710
before family ties.

566
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:09,400
You're...

567
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,550
you're forcing me!

568
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,660
Step aside! All of you!

569
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:14,550
Master.

570
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,960
I have something to tell you.

571
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,570
I'm Wangquan Fugui.

572
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,150
Greetings, Master.

573
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:42,960
Fugui,

574
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:44,480
ignore them.

575
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:46,480
Let's go.

576
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,670
Father, I'm bidding you farewell.

577
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:52,730
But before I leave,

578
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,800
I have to finish one thing.

579
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:23,960
The Wangquan family

580
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:26,680
must not fail the people of this world.

581
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,280
Today,

582
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:34,800
I'll remove the Soldier's sword meridian

583
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,760
to prevent future troubles!

584
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,890
I've made up my mind.

585
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,400
Do it now.
