[Episode 3]

3
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,400
She's too badly injured

4
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:12,680
to be cured.

5
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,780
I can only revive her by refining my power

6
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,600
with this winged spirit pearl.

7
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,150
Perhaps...

8
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,190
this is God's will.

9
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,710
I'm not dead?

10
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,000
Young Master Fugui,

11
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,520
did you save my life?

12
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,280
Young Master Fugui,

13
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,360
why do you look so pale?

14
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,840
Are you injured?

15
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,630
I'll get you a towel.

16
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:01,630
No need.

17
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,190
I have a question for you.

18
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,720
What would you like to know?

19
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,630
Ask away.

20
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,040
Do you want to take a human form?

21
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,520
A human form?

22
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,750
Of course I do!

23
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,470
If I can transform into a human,

24
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,280
I'll become an invincible demon

25
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,080
that can cultivate much faster.

26
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,960
That way,

27
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,490
I can protect my younger brother.

28
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,560
There are usually over 100 little spiders
like you in a brood.

29
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,960
Don't you have other siblings?

30
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,160
My other siblings...

31
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,120
They all died.

32
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,000
Only No.12581 and I survived.

33
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,400
Though I'm a tiny low-grade spider demon,

34
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,430
I still

35
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,400
care about certain things

36
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,150
and certain people.

37
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:45,210
Young Master Fugui,

38
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,190
could you please help my brother out?

39
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,150
I'm begging you.

40
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,750
Please, Young Master Fugui.

41
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,890
Young Master Fugui...

42
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:56,940
Remember this:

43
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,700
you should make

44
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,700
your dreams come true on your own.

45
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,040
Make my dreams come true

46
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,710
on my own?

47
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,250
Young Master Fugui,

48
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,520
it's so cold outside today.

49
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,680
How am I able to fly?

50
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,150
Young Master Fugui,

51
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,160
you're amazing.

52
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,070
What pearl is this?

53
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,950
How beautiful.

54
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,370
It doesn't matter.

55
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,010
But this pearl can transform you
into a human.

00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,480
I'm a human now!

71
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,390
Young Master Fugui, look!

72
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,730
Young Master Fugui,

73
00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:02,720
these two human legs don't seem

74
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,430
able to give me as much support
as my eight spider legs could.

75
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,290
Stand up first.

76
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,960
Then see if you can walk.

77
00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:08,510
Oh.

78
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,680
This is not a dream, is it?

79
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,190
Young Master Fugui,

80
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,120
pinch me now.

81
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,030
Hurry!

82
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:24,930
Go back in the room.

83
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,240
Young Master Fugui,

84
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,830
are you leaving for the morning practice?

85
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,690
I can go with...

86
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,200
Young Master Fugui,

87
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,760
go ahead and don't worry!

88
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,000
I'll get used to walking with two legs.

89
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,890
Now I finally know how the world looks

90
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,510
from this angle.

[Wangquan]

92

Master of the Quan family

93
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,140
from the Western Regions,

94
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,040
Quan Jingting, has arrived!

95
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,420
Dismissed, all of you.

96
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,310
Yes!

97
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,630
My dear cousin,

98
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,930
I don't think I came at the right time.

99
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,360
Is this

100
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,890
the morning practice?

101
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,000
It's been a long time
since I last practiced sword skills here.

102
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,059
I wonder if any progress has been made

103
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,990
in Wangquan Swordsmanship.

104
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:28,650
Wangquan Swordsmanship
is said to be the best in the world.

105
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,240
But it doesn't seem impressive now.

106
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,680
Isn't there anyone competent
in the Wangquan family now?

107
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,630
My dear cousin,

108
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,630
I haven't seen you for years.

109
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,240
You look haggard now.

110
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,550
Master Quan, you were expelled

111
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,950
from the Wangquan family
over a decade ago.

112
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,380
Then you changed your surname to "Quan."

113
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,360
Today, at the Wangquan Manor,

114
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,320
your role is a guest.

115
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,150
A guest

116
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,920
should show a guest's courtesy.

117
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,640
I, Quan Jingting,
from the Quan family in the border area,

118
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,000
am glad to meet you,
Chief of Yiqi Alliance.

119
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,750
Master Quan,

120
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,150
are you in town
for the Blue Sky Convention?

121
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:11,270
Of course.

122
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,530
The Blue Sky Convention

123
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,030
is a tryout for young people.

124
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,360
Where is your son Quan Rumu?

125
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,870
Rumu will go to the Li Residence himself

126
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,670
for the Blue Sky Convention.

127
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,840
Send Master Quan and other visitors

128
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,640
to the guest quarters for a rest.

129
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:59,870
Transferring spiritual power to her

130
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,930
must've caused quite an impact on me.

131
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:04,070
I was being too careless.

132
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,960
Young Master Fugui, you're back!

133
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,840
I've got used to walking with two legs.

134
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,360
Look!

135
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,970
Young Master Fugui,

136
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,670
what's going on with you?

137
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,360
I'm fine.

138
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,690
I just need to regulate my breathing.

139
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,240
The water is a bit dirty.

140
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,080
I'll take it out.

141
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,080
No need.

142
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,010
This dress is not a good fit for you.

143
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,800
Today, I finally saw
how good the Soldier could be.

144
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,280
Though he hasn't mastered
the Heaven-and-Earth Strike,

145
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,120
he's already stronger

146
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,210
than most others in the world.

147
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,840
Rumu won't stand a chance

148
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,600
of defeating him.

149
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,610
Master, do you have a plan?

150
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,600
Go tell that ungrateful son of mine

151
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,000
that he must win the Soldier

152
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,440
in the Blue Sky Convention,

153
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,360
even by devious means.

154
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,030
Yes.

155
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:40,200
I hear
that when regulating their breathing,

156
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,400
cultivators would enter
the Primary Circulation Phase.

157
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,550
Don't worry, Young Master Fugui.

158
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,480
I'll absolutely protect you well.

159
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,630
No.12580.

160
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,360
I'm here!

161
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,230
How did you reach this place?

162
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,790
No.12580,

163
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,510
I didn't expect you
to have truly taken a human form.

164
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,320
Did the Soldier
help you with the transformation?

165
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,720
He has so much trust in you

166
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,360
that he feels safe
to sit unconsciously before you.

167
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,510
You can kill him now.

168
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,080
Attack his Baihui acupoint.

169
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,910
That's the fatal weakness of all mankind.

170
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,200
You've transformed into a human.

171
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,960
You should know where Baihui acupoint is.

172
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,670
Take this.

173
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,240
Go.

174
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,120
Stick this needle deep into him.

175
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,650
Then he'll definitely die.

176
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,210
My job is to spy on the Soldier,

177
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,750
not to assassinate him.

178
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:33,360
Besides,

179
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,240
I've completed my task.

180
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,390
Mistress's ultimate goal is revenge.

181
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,240
If you kill the Soldier,

182
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,630
we'll be given the greatest credit.

183
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,510
You good-for-nothing,

184
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,240
will you do it or not?

185
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,370
I'll go if you don't.

186
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,240
No way!

187
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,240
You've indeed become disloyal to Mistress.

188
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,120
Are you taking the Soldier's side now?

189
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,720
I'll report it to Mistress right away.

190
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,450
She'll kill your brother then!

191
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:52,790
What are you doing?

192
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:53,630
Let me out!

193
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,200
Was it a thunder strike?

194
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,600
Now, I'll show you who is

195
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,670
a real good-for-nothing.

196
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,450
My goodness!

197
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,720
I feel so dizzy.

198
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,960
I'm telling you,

199
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,030
as long as I stay with Young Master Fugui

200
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,290
and keep cultivating,

201
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,480
it won't be long

202
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,270
before I become able
to rescue my brother on my own.

203
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,000
Mistress won't let it happen.

204
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,320
You and your brother

205
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,720
will die a tragic death!

206
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:24,550
You...

207
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:29,200
T-This...

208
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:29,530
It...

209
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,340
Since when did you become so good?

210
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,000
Let me out!

211
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:36,960
Let me out!

212
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,240
Just stay in.

213
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,040
Senior Fugui!

214
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,600
Are you in there?

215
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,000
It's Lady Feng.

216
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,349
How odd.

217
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,440
This is impossible.

218
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,310
How did Senior Fugui
lose so much spiritual power?

219
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:28,960
That Raccoon Dog Demon King

220
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,960
was no match for Senior Fugui at all.

221
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,480
Quan Jingting couldn't have caused
this much harm either.

222
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,280
Senior Fugui,

223
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,109
are you okay?

224
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:39,690
I'm fine.

225
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,750
Why did you never tell us

226
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,810
you had lost so much spiritual power?

227
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,950
But breaking that formation

228
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,200
was like giving Quan Jingting
a giant slap in the face.

229
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,530
You did a wonderful job.

230
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:57,770
Tingyun,

231
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,840
you're free to go if that's everything.

232
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,270
I know you haven't

233
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,730
fallen in love with me yet.

234
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:07,680
But it's okay.

235
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:08,790
I still think

236
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,480
in Yiqi Alliance, I'm the only one

237
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,940
who's good enough for you.

238
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,110
If one day,

239
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,240
someone who suits you better shows up,

240
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,030
I'll quit trying.

241
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,200
Senior Fugui,

242
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:29,640
have you seen

243
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,550
that little spider demon again,

244
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,680
the one that delivered letters for me?

245
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,440
No.

246
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,810
I promised to set her free that day.

247
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,140
She has never come to me again after that.

248
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,120
Actually, she's quite fun.

249
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,660
Too bad that she's a demon.

250
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:00,160
Humans and demons take different paths.

251
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,160
These two species can't be friends.

252
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,510
I'm clear about that.

253
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,960
Senior Fugui,

254
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,170
take a good rest.

255
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:29,390
Stop looking.

256
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,290
You fear her that much?

257
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,370
Judging from what Lady Feng said,

258
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,310
she definitely hates for a spider demon

259
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,400
to stick with you.

260
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,200
By the way, Young Master Fugui,

261
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,720
are you feeling better now?

262
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,160
Yes.

263
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:50,880
Oh.

264
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,680
That's great.

265
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,160
Young Master Fugui,

266
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,750
do I look better now as a human

267
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,600
than as a spider before?

268
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,440
Young Master Fugui,

269
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,750
does being quiet mean

270
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,080
your answer is "yes"?

271
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,580
Well, you don't think I look good.

272
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,450
Anyway, at least I don't seem ugly

273
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,110
in your eyes now, right?

274
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,070
So much noise.

275
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,480
Oh.

276
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,640
Young Master Fugui,

277
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,520
thank you for saving my life.

278
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,310
I swear I'll repay you.

279
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,450
I just didn't want you
to be trampled to death.

280
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:49,310
The wish to protect someone
motivated you to cling to life.

281
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,970
I wanted to help. That was all.

282
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,760
What's your plan for the future?

283
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,720
Young Master Fugui,

284
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,160
can you teach me a set of sword skills?

285
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,420
I hope to get stronger,

286
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,000
so as to protect those

287
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,970
I want to with my own strength.

288
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,240
It isn't hard to teach you
a set of sword skills.

289
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,500
But the dress you're in

290
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,710
is truly inappropriate.

291
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,200
Huh?

292
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,090
Young Master Fugui,

293
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:52,070
usually, on a snowy day like this,

294
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,880
even demons such as myself
wouldn't go out.

295
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,310
Wind, frost, rain, and snow

296
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,790
are all part of nature.

297
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:02,440
Severe weather helps with your study.

298
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,440
Is there anything

299
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,280
I can learn from the snow?

300
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,030
Young Master Fugui

301
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:44,880
is amazing!

302
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,830
Young Master Fugui,

303
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:04,830
what do you think?

304
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,240
Lift your right arm higher.

305
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,570
Align it with the sword.

306
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,070
Oh.

307
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,000
How strange.

308
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,090
Young Master Fugui,

309
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:25,350
why am I still not able
to release sword energy?

310
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:26,880
It takes more practice.

311
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,590
Okay.

312
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,030
Young Master Fugui,

313
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:51,790
look!

314
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,200
Such beautiful sunset glows.

315
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,890
Young Master Fugui, look at that!

316
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:15,720
They will disappear

317
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,570
in just a short moment.

318
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,920
They'll be gone in a short moment.

319
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,200
What a pity.

320
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:35,550
Young Master Fugui,

321
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:36,510
look over there!

322
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:37,790
A flock of birds!

323
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,570
What a lovely scene.

324
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,750
These birds

325
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,080
came earlier today than usual.

326
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,720
Young Master Fugui

327
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,290
has never once seen the world outside.

328
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,160
He'd even deeply cherish

329
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:11,350
the presence

330
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,750
of sunset glows and birds.

331
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,840
Those people
confine Young Master Fugui here,

332
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:20,830
making him cultivate every day.

333
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,460
But he's a human after all.

334
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,610
He feels lonely too.

335
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,200
This is odd.

336
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,640
Why am I feeling so angry?

337
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:30,880
Well,

338
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,880
I must do something
for Young Master Fugui.

339
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:56,650
♪ The wind secretly makes a home
on an unknown page of the story ♪

340
00:25:56,950 --> 00:26:00,960
♪ As you flip a page,

00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:02,320
You claim your son Rumu to be able

509
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,760
to slay the Soldier.

510
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:06,490
Where is he now?

511
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,070
A hero is a product of his time.

512
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,270
That proverb is true.

513
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:18,070
But you have to show us

514
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,440
how your son Rumu

515
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:22,190
can manage to kill the Soldier.

516
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,480
Don't act so recklessly.

517
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:48,290
Young Master Fugui...

518
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,780
What are you trying to say?

519
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:00,150
Nobody knows how tender you are.

520
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,600
Tenderness is not what a Soldier needs.

521
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,230
Also, nobody knows

522
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,840
what you really want, Young Master Fugui.

523
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,280
Then what do you think I really want?

524
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,440
You long to see the scenery outside,

525
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,240
and to get out of that Palanquin.

526
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,560
Mr. Fei said you could

527
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:18,850
take a horse carriage,

528
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:20,530
instead of the Palanquin,

529
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,330
to the Blue Sky Convention.

530
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,000
That way, you can see the world outside.

531
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,020
Who would've known...

532
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,490
that you'd become temporarily blind?

533
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,550
How useless of me.

534
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,690
I can't protect anyone.

535
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:51,480
Why don't you be my eyes?

536
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:02,670
Though Young Master Fugui
can't go outside as he pleases,

537
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:03,510
I believe

538
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,960
he will see

539
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,560
the real Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai
one day,

540
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,220
and that he won't be this lonely forever.

541
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:12,150
Before that,

542
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:13,510
if possible,

543
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,710
I'd like to weave more prettier scenery

544
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:18,040
for Young Master Fugui.

545
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,230
Now, let me be

546
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:22,590
Young Master Fugui's eyes.

547
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:48,150
Sit tight.

548
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,010
Young Master Fugui,

549
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:57,000
yesterday,

550
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,700
I spent a whole night making this ribbon.

551
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:02,130
It's a perfect match for your outfit.

552
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,380
Young Master Fugui

553
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,740
deserves the best of everything.

554
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:09,910
Didn't you promise to be my eyes?

555
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:11,280
Oh.

556
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,000
Let me see.

557
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,010
Young Master Fugui,

558
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,710
those flying south in a line

559
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,360
are Datian birds, right?

560
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,280
Yes.

561
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,550
A young one just fell behind.

562
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:29,110
But it's catching up now.

563
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,860
How lovely this is.

564
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,190
They're all free and soaring.

565
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:42,150
I'm so happy to be

566
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,670
your eyes.

567
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:53,830
Everything outside must be beautiful,

568
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:54,800
because

569
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:56,760
you sound very happy.
