[Episode 19]

3
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,430
Pass a message to Madam Yin for me.

4
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,280
Tell her

5
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,820
I need her help
finding out where Young Master Fugui is.

6
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,509
There must be something wrong
with the Qianji City.

7
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:13,310
Qingcheng seems to be
taking good care of me,

8
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,320
but actually,

9
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,840
he's locked me up and deprived me

10
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,680
of freedom.

11
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,710
I need to get out of here
as soon as possible

12
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,310
and find Young Master Fugui.

13
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,240
Come on, mind your hands.

14
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,840
Good boy.

15
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,680
Sir.

16
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,910
I'm already drawing the second one.

17
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,310
Let me see.

18
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,030
Well done.

19
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,079
Hello.

20
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,840
I heard
the fish lanterns you sell are amazing.

21
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:47,540
Even the strongest wind
can't blow them out.

22
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,240
My dad is a porter.

23
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,630
Sometimes he has to deliver goods
to a faraway place.

24
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:54,540
It's super windy at night.

25
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,520
I want to get him a lantern

26
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,190
so that Dad can come back home early.

27
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,470
Okay.

28
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,480
Then give me a moment.

29
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,430
Okay.

30
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,120
I drew this, too.

31
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:12,750
Look.

32
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,400
Is this one okay?

33
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,910
Yes.

34
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,680
Wow.

35
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,600
But I have nothing to pay you.

36
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,579
Not even a sweet potato.

37
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,530
It doesn't matter.

38
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,680
I think your bouquet is

39
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,960
so beautiful.

40
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,750
Can you give it to me?

41
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,910
Can this really do?

42
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,030
Of course.

43
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,240
Thank you, sir.

44
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,030
Bye.

45
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,030
Bye.

46
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,680
In the Sandstorm Town
of the Western Regions,

47
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,610
I sell paper lanterns for a living.

48
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,180
I call myself Wang.

49
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,360
They call me Lantern Wang.

50
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,190
As I've been
living a plain life since childhood,

51
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,190
I don't need much.

52
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:04,960
So it's not hard

53
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,840
to get by.

54
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,280
I thought this simple life

55
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,430
would calm me down.

56
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,820
But somehow,

57
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,580
when night falls

58
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,850
and I see the light in every household,

59
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:25,910
my heart

60
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,000
also flickers with them.

61
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,430
My mind drifts back to the days

62
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,120
in the Huadeng Village.

63
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,360
They were simple,

64
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:36,560
delightful,

65
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:38,040
full of bliss

66
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,070
and company.

67
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,430
At dusk every day,

68
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,920
I'll try to restore some inner power

69
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,450
to ensure that I can survive normally

70
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,120
rather than rely on others.

71
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,830
But deep down inside, I know

72
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,480
the real reason why I do this.

73
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,370
Although I care about Qingtong's safety,

74
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,480
I'm also aware

75
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,080
that potential threats still loom large
in the Western Regions.

76
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,640
And restricted by this binding spell,

77
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,170
I can only keep my longing

78
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,310
to myself.

79
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,640
The first priority now is

80
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,540
to find out where the Water-Control Orb is

81
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,210
and figure out a solution.

82
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,070
Recently,

83
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,600
an uninvited guest came to my house.

84
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,600
A corsac fox.

85
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:51,930
You must be hungry.

86
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,920
As a corsac fox with strong demon power,

87
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,870
you should've been able
to transform into a human.

88
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,040
You came to my place

89
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,560
because of this pot of daisies, right?

90
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,120
What?

91
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,770
You don't like the food?

92
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:23,980
Stop howling.

93
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,950
I don't have meat at home.

94
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,080
Just make do with it.

95
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,290
I thought
it was just asking for some food.

96
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,890
But because I refused to feed it meat,

97
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,310
it's now holding a grudge against me

98
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,510
and sticking around.

99
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,280
Sir,

100
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,560
pick whatever you like.

101
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,310
I have the best meat.

102
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,950
I don't want meat

103
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,270
for myself.

104
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,070
Which piece

105
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,800
is the freshest?

106
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:56,510
This...

107
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,090
This one.

108
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,630
Please get me three catties.

109
00:06:58,630 --> 00:06:59,240
Okay.

110
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,250
Have you heard that?

111
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,680
The royal corsac fox family is

112
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,480
looking for the Second Prince,
who's been missing.

113
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,600
It's been years,
and they never looked for him.

114
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,680
Can they find him now?

115
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,510
Who knows?

116
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,570
The Second Prince?

117
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,920
Could it be

118
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,750
him?

122

Your Majesty,

123
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,970
if you keep worrying like this,

124
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,360
you're going to crash out.

[Imperial Preceptor
of the Corsac Fox State, Western Regions]

126
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,170
You should at least eat something.

127
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,120
At my age,

128
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:47,070
the only thing I can't let go of

129
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,310
is chopsticks.

130
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,560
Give it a try.

131
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,400
Your Majesty!

132
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,070
Your Majesty,

133
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:07,930
we've found clues
about where the Second Prince is.

134
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,600
Send troops there now.

135
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,270
Yes.

136
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,290
What is it this time?

137
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:26,320
I need garlic.

138
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,700
I forgot it.

139
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,910
Are you from the Thousand Silk Cave?

140
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,230
You mean

141
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,030
my sister summoned you

142
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:05,400
and asked you
to find out where the Soldier is?

143
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,230
As you can see,

144
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,020
my sister is back with me.

145
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,320
Tell Madam Yin

146
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,510
that from today onwards,
the Silk Cave and Qianji City

147
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:20,000
had better not interfere with each other.

148
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,160
I-I will pass on the message.

149
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,160
Don't move!

150
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,360
Is the Soldier

151
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:30,410
of the Yiqi Alliance alive or dead?

152
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,030
He's still alive,

153
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,840
yet with his sword meridian cut off,

154
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,700
his power lost,

155
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,360
and himself
exiled to the Western Regions.

156
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,840
The Western Regions?

157
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,720
Will you tell my sister

158
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,270
that the Soldier is still alive?

159
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:49,810
No,

160
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,180
I will never tell her.

161
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,480
Please trust me.

163
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,750
why did you

164
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,570
dress me up in such a fancy way?

165
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,410
Sister, you know what?

166
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,270
This is the scene

167
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,130
I've been dreaming of many times.

168
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,120
I even carefully

169
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,870
decorated this room for you.

170
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,340
Do you like it, Sister?

171
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:47,530
Qingcheng,

172
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,600
you should first tell me

173
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,440
how you became like this.

174
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,750
And what's going on

175
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,870
with this Qianli City?

176
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,150
Looks like you've finally started
to care about me, Sister.

177
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,240
In your heart,

178
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,240
I'm never your only one.

179
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,080
But I won't forget

180
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,400
every word you said.

181
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,590
Everything about you

182
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,910
matters so much to me.

183
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,180
Sister, do you know

184
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,080
what kind of monster

185
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,810
the former Qianji City Lord is?

186
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,890
[The Former Qianji City Lord]

187
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,320
He was cruel

188
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,540
and bloodthirsty.

189
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,360
He hunted demons
and absorbed their demon power

190
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,030
to boost his own strength.

191
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,000
That day, he captured all the demons

192
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,530
in the Deer Village
to absorb the demon power.

193
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:35,390
I was

194
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:37,910
one of them.

195
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,240
I've absorbed all his demon power.

196
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,790
Yet he's still alive.

197
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,360
What an excellent body.

198
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,030
Hush.

199
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,080
Don't move.

200
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,440
Let's continue the game.

201
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,120
This is called

202
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,850
the Bone-Refining Demonic Gu.

203
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,110
It will

204
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,880
make your body strong

205
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,720
and unbreakable.

206
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:35,880
Qingcheng,

207
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,390
how did you break free from him?

208
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,760
What else could I do?

209
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,600
I killed him.

210
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,030
As for how I did it,

211
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,630
I'll tell you later.

212
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,270
Qingcheng,

213
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,310
I'm sorry.

214
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,990
I failed to well protect you.

215
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,290
I'm sorry.

216
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,550
Sister.

217
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,670
I know

218
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,690
that the Soldier is very important to you.

219
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,750
But I still hope

220
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,550
you can give me a share
of your love for the Soldier,

221
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,580
even if it's just a little.

222
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,340
I've sent people to look for the Soldier.

223
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,740
I hope you can understand

224
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,310
that no matter what you want to do,

225
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,240
this Qianji City

226
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,360
will always have your back.

227
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,240
Sister,

228
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,720
have a good rest.

229
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:04,750
Did you find him?

230
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,320
No, no.

231
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,380
What about you?

232
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:07,780
We didn't find them.

233
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,470
What should we do now?

234
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,640
We'll probably be sentenced to death.

235
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,170
Over there.

236
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,150
Look!

237
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:22,960
Keep your voice down.

238
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,690
Keep it down.

239
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,080
Okay.

240
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,250
Let's go.

241
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:28,030
Go.

242
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:28,790
Let's go.

243
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,150
Robbery!

244
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,950
Take your valuable possessions

245
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,600
and come with me.

246
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:15,920
Where...

247
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,260
Where are we going?

248
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,790
I, the Boss,

249
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,750
am a heroine.

250
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,750
Due to some luck recently,

251
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,910
I got an incredible magic tool.

252
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,370
So I've decided

253
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:30,190
[Female Bandit from the Western Regions]

254
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,810
to rob the rich and help the people.

255
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,200
A magic tool?

256
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,900
Could it be that the Water-Control Orb is
in her hands?

257
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,030
Is there anyone who wants to follow me?

258
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,960
Is she asking for money or food?

259
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,790
Does she

260
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,730
want money or grain?

261
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,790
Is she asking for grain?

262
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,150
I don't get what she means.

263
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:46,870
No idea.

264
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,440
Ignorance is so scary.

265
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,750
I mean,

266
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,910
I'll take

267
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,570
your money.

268
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,950
I want the strong guys, too.

If you volunteer to join us,

270
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,800
you will suffer less.

271
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,660
Do you understand?

272
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,200
You fierce woman!

00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,050
How dare you plunder it?

276
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,840
-Yeah.
-That's right.

277
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,390
The Li Army won't let you go!

278
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:14,480
It's so hard to reason with you.

279
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,660
What are you doing?

280
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,320
Let go of me! Let go!

281
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,240
Stop it.

282
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:31,960
What did you say?

283
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,390
You guys went

284
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,050
a bit too far, don't you think?

285
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,720
Interesting.

286
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:46,960
Da.

287
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:47,720
Yes.

288
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,340
Take him with us.

289
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:49,910
Yes.

290
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,910
That's good.

291
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:56,240
I can go with them to find out
where the Water-Control Orb is.

We forcibly transformed him
into a human with the talisman.

298

He will be mad for sure when he wakes up.

Yes.

Don't be scared, Yunfei.

Can you tell me

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,680
why you've been wandering outside

since you don't want to tell me,

00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,160
I'll just take a guess.

After you were born,

326

you kept sticking around him..

327
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,680
Maybe because

328
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,640
of his mother's lowly background,

329
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,830

348
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,730
Yes.

349
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,000
Yunfei,

350
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,070
I'm leaving.

351
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,520
I've always known

352
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,290
that you could have transformed
into a human long ago.

353
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,000
Am I right?

354
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,130
You're afraid that your existence

355
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,290
might make me lose everything.

356
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,420
That's why you refuse to transform.

357
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:36,640
Right?

358
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,070
Silly boy.

359
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,370
There are things

360
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,480
that you can't

361
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:52,270
change easily.

362
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,510
That's fine.

363
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,480
From now on,

364
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,200
Yunfei, you don't

365
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,080
have to always let me get the upper hand.

366
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,110
So,

367
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,730
you ran away from the imperial palace
for the sake of Yunhai?

368
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,240
You haven't come back even once
for so many years, right?

369
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,350
I did come back

370
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,780
on the day my brother passed away.

371
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,880
It's all my fault for being useless.

372
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,640
It's not your fault.

373
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,830
I heard

374
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,550
that he got backstabbed.

375
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:37,790
So he

376
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:41,750
chose to take the enemy down with him.

377
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,960
It's all because

378
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,110
I was so old and dumb

379
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:50,880
that I couldn't even protect my son.

380
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,340
Now that your brother is gone,

381
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:56,880
and you refuse to come back,

382
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:59,590
I'm the only one left,

383
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,270
long in tooth, living all alone.

384
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,070
If your brother Yunhai were still alive,

385
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:08,600
he would definitely
feel heartbroken for me.

386
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:14,030
My days are really numbered.

387
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,750
Yunfei.

388
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,400
Yunfei.

389
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,510
Yunfei!

390
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,830
Yunfei.

391
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:34,880
Yunfei,

392
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:37,270
I am really old now.

393
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:41,400
You have to succeed to the throne
in the future.

394
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,920
Are you willing to take on

395
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,750
your human form for me?

396
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:19,110
[Fan Yunfei, the Second Prince
of Corsac Fox State, Western Regions]

397
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,110
Yunfei!

398
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,880
You've transformed into a human now.

399
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,510
Get up.

400
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,880
You need to quit this habit.

401
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,220
You can't eat this.

402
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,550
I hereby announce

403
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,310
that from today on,

404
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,560
you're the only prince
of the Corsac Fox State.

405
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,090
On your wedding day,

406
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,640
you'll
succeed to the throne automatically.

407
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:08,790
Boy,

408
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:10,970
you won't be so cruel

409
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,750
to see your old father

410
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,420
spend his final days
on the throne, will you?

411
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,350
I

412
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,070
still have many dreams

413
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,720
to fulfill.

414
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:21,960
Well...

415
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:22,790
Well done!

416
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,590
The Prince said yes!

417
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,480
Your Highness, you're so filial

418
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,890
and agreed so easily!

419
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,110
No...

420
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,480
No matter what,

421
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,430
you and your brother are the same,

422
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:33,550
both responsible

423
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,400
and devoted to your family.

424
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,270
I...

425
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,070
I...

426
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,200
I understand.

427
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,550
You will surely retrieve
the sacred relic of our clan,

428
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:42,720
the Water-Control Orb,

429
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,400
right?

430
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:44,640
What?

431
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,270
Orb?

432
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,270
Prince Yunfei agreed!

433
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,590
His Highness will go to the enemy's camp

434
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,640
and take back our clan's sacred relic,
the Water-Control Orb!

435
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,000
The Corsac Fox Clan will achieve
great rejuvenation!

436
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,440
Bring back the sacred relic

437
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,750
for the great rejuvenation!

438
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,030
Bring back the sacred relic

439
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,270
for the great rejuvenation!

440
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:01,590
Bring back...

441
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,070
Stop.

442
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,030
I only said

443
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,130
five words in total.

444
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,390
I'm counting.

445
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:11,990
But it doesn't matter
how many words you said.

446
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:13,400
According to reliable sources,

447
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,070
the sacred relic

448
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:16,030
fell into the hands
of a fierce female bandit.

449
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,510
Your Highness,
as wise and powerful as you are,

450
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,240
it'll be a piece of cake for you.

451
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,030
Boy,

452
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,400
you've grown up.

453
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:25,120
It's time to shoulder responsibilities.

454
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:26,160
I'll leave this

455
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,510
to you.

456
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:30,450
Imperial Preceptor,

457
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:32,550
is the braised camel meat ready?

458
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:33,000
Oh, right.

459
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,440
Can't cook it for too long.

460
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,200
Braised camel meat

461
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,550
won't taste good if overcooked.

462
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,030
Yes.

463
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,160
That's why

464
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:44,890
I didn't want

465
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,860
to transform into a human.

466
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,880
General Li Xueyang is here.

467
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,540
General Li!

468
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:57,440
General Li,

469
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,550
you must help us.

470
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,680
General Li.

471
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,400
Please help us!

472
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:04,310
Did they leave anything behind?

473
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:06,640
The female bandit didn't leave anything.

474
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,240
This is her subordinate's belt.

475
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,030
Taling talisman!

476
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:27,920
Thank you, General Li.

477
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,200
Thank you, General.

478
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,920
Thank you, General.

479
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:39,570
I'm leaving first.

480
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:41,110
Wait for my locating signal.

481
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:41,670
Yes!

482
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,110
Giddy-up!

483
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,480
Yunfei,

484
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,110
I know you want to break in

485
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,160
and take back the Water-Control Orb.

486
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:55,760
But that is

487
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,960
a waste of your beauty.

488
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,640
What is the principle
of our Corsac Fox State?

489
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,110
Rather stay alive kneeling

490
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,170
than die standing.

491
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,210
Slyness and deceit are what

492
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,110
keep the fox spirit lasting forever.

493
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,440
Slyness is

494
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,270
our nature.

495
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,110
Why act so recklessly?

496
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:15,920
Go.

497
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,910
[Bandit Camp]

498
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,200
Go faster!

499
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,030
Stop there.

500
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,350
Stop.

501
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:32,510
Who are you?

502
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,480
We are corsac foxes
from the nearby village.

503
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,550
We specially offer a beauty

504
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:37,510
to your boss.

505
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:38,790
Hope she can show mercy

506
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,050
and spare our village.

507
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:41,730
Let's go.

508
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:47,350
You do look quite good.

509
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,240
Take him away.

510
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:51,070
Harder.

511
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:52,000
Boss,

512
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:54,370
I've brought you the person you want.

513
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,110
Get up.

514
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:06,360
Hurry up.

515
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,260
Come over here.

516
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,270
Quite handsome.

517
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:30,400
You may all leave.

518
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,200
You touched me.

519
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,310
Interesting.

520
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:02,480
Let me see how long you can hide.

521
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,550
Boss,

522
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:06,800
the Corsac Fox Village
just offered a beauty.

523
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,010
Should we let him in?

524
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,240
Bring him in.

525
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:11,620
Go over there.

526
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,880
Why is he also here?

527
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,840
This demonic aura...

528
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,750
Is he that poor dog?

529
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,200
Beauty,

530
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,590
what's your name?

531
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,960
Fan.

532
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,030
Beauty Fan?

533
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:41,840
Come on, come over here.

534
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,200
Don't go.

535
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:46,880
It's okay.

536
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,420
It's me, that poor dog.

537
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,550
I'll use my demon power
and wisdom to save you

538
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:53,550
-What are you two whispering about?
-and protect you.

539
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,070
I wanted

540
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,830
to take both of you in.

541
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:02,110
But you don't appreciate it!

542
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,400
I don't like it.

543
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,200
Guards!

544
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,310
Yes.

545
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,160
Send him away

546
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,810
to do hard labor with those slaves.

547
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,000
Go.

548
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:16,550
Beauty Fan.

549
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,000
Come here.

550
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,310
Look at you.

551
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:33,790
What a lucky guy.

552
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,480
How about I give you a chance tonight?

553
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,000
Give me a chance?

554
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:45,750
Go!

555
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:49,200
Hurry up!

556
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,030
Hurry!

557
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,000
Look.

558
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,260
Another captive here.

559
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,440
Who can save us?

560
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:22,880
Leopard demon,

561
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,210
you're quite powerful.

562
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,920
Do you want to get out of here?

563
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,590
Yes.

564
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:29,080
My meridians have been sealed.

565
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:31,550
Otherwise, how could these bastards

566
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:32,680
get the better of me?

567
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,780
Fight your way out.

568
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:39,920
Yes.

569
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,000
Whoever stops me will die!

570
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:52,920
Kill!

571
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,770
We can finally get out of here.

572
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:07,790
Take three steps back and block the way.

573
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,320
Lower left, attack the leg.

574
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:10,850
Kick away the weapon.

575
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,400
Side kick with the right leg.

576
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,310
Charge forward with the round blade.

577
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:13,920
Break!

578
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:35,080
-Thank you for saving us.
-Thank you, sir.

579
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:55,540
[Asura Hall, Qianji City]

580
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:29,240
You're such a good liar.

581
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:32,530
Why didn't you tell your sister directly

582
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,730
that you managed to kill
that old Qianji City Lord

583
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:37,270
thanks to me?

584
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:52,680
You're going to die soon.

585
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:55,590
And your body will be taken over.

586
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,510
I can't die.

587
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,090
If my sister can't find me,

588
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,000
she will be worried.

589
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,200
Ridiculous.

590
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,510
You're not related to Qingtong.

591
00:34:08,969 --> 00:34:11,030
Why would she be concerned about you?

592
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,880
I told you before

593
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:15,320
that she only cares about the Soldier.

594
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,820
You're no more than a loser
abandoned by her,

595
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,030
weak

596
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:20,230
and lowly.

597
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:23,969
You're talking nonsense.

598
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,880
Didn't you promise

599
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:29,070
to give me power?

600
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:31,440
Power?

601
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,440
Power needs a source.

602
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:34,800
Your desire,

603
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,030
pain,

604
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,510
and hatred

605
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:40,190
must be extreme

606
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,510
and crazy enough.

607
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,800
You lied to me.

608
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:46,510
You all lied to me.

609
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,670
I'll kill you.

610
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,710
I'll kill all of you.

611
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:57,480
My sister belongs to me!

612
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,280
That's right.

613
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,320
Let me take over

614
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:06,030
the last part of your nirvana.

615
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,490
As long as my sister can stay,

616
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:15,070
what's the big deal about telling a lie?

617
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:16,630
Your sister is not a fool.

618
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,030
Your little trick

619
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,590
can't keep your sister

620
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,190
by your side forever.

621
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:24,920
Then I'll do whatever it takes

622
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:29,150
to cut off every way she could leave me.
