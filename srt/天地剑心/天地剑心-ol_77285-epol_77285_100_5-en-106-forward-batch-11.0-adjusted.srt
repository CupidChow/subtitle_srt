tomorrow.

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,140
You go
attend the skill battles and buy time.

And I

8

will go to the Xiyun Hall to save them.

9
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,350
You must hang in there until I come back.

10
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,360
You have to do

11
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,640
what you asked for by yourself.

12
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,500
Here we are.

13
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,490
We've arrived.

do massages?

19

My legs hurt so much.

20
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,610
Could you give me a massage?

21

Huh?

22
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,020
Young Master Fugui doesn't know
how to massage.

23
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,030
But I can do it.

24
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,120
How about

Forget it.

How can you give a nice massage?

29

Y-You're too weak.

30

I don't need it.

31

You must know how

32
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,380

33
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,450
Read my fortune.

I feel like I'm having a tough year,

constantly dealing

Tell me.

38
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,710
What do you want to know?

39
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,840
Is it about your career

40
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,430
or marriage?
Why are you so annoying?

41
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,079
I don't want you to do it.

42

I want him to tell my fortune.

43
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,870
He's blind, typical of fortune-tellers!

44
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:54,670
Stop arguing.

45

He's not blind.

46

but why did you hit me?

164

It wasn't me.

165

And we'll give you a raise.

166

this is the demon brought here
and locked up by Master Quan, right?

178
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,090
Impossible.

179
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,270
The demons brought by Master Quan

180
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,730
are all locked in the cave.

181
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,390
And the cave

182
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,050
is covered by demon-subduing talismans.

183
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,910
How did he

184
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,240
get out?

185
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,080
These little demons

186
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,630
know sorcery more or less.

187
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,360
You can't underestimate them.

188
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,890
Thank you, miss.

189
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:43,950
Take him away.

190
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,220
Do not try to run again.

191
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:47,790
Go.

192
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:04,750
Yi.

193
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:05,840
Yi!

194
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,420
Stop slacking off.

195
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,750
You lazybones.

196
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,410
How can you earn your freedom?

197
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:13,790
Work harder.

198
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,810
Follow me to the stage.

199
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,320
Let's welcome the next challenger,

200
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,390
the Cold Jade Sword

201
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,520
from the Shi family,

202
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,200
Shi Tang.

203
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,030
Master,

204
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,640
the Soldier has reached the Xiyun Hall.

205
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:25,080
Mm.

206
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,610
Everything unfolded just as you predicted.

207
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,400
A father knows his son the best.

208
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:43,320
Rumu has been friends
with the Soldier since childhood.

209
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,000
He wouldn't hurt his friend

210
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,600
just because I forced him to.

211
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,320
He went to see the Soldier
without telling me.

212
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,630
But I knew it.

213
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,960
I didn't predict the future.

214
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,600
It's just
that human nature is unpredictable.

215
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,440
I just played along.

216
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,480
You lured the Soldier to my Xiyun Hall

217
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,150
and made me deal with him.

218
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:07,210
You also forced Rumu to attend
the Blue Sky Convention.

219
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,120
I suppose

220
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,750
the Soldier isn't

221
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,840
the only one you want to kill,

222
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,000
right?

223
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,960
He's been outshining me
in every aspect since childhood.

224
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,080
Yes,

225
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,910
Rumu might not be able

226
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,320
to kill the Soldier.

227
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,040
But what if the person I want Rumu to kill

228
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:39,790
is not the Soldier?

229
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,870
Split them up and destroy them separately.

230
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,530
What a good plan
to kill two birds with one stone.

231
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,150
Now it all depends on
whether the demon king you raise

232
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:52,120
can kill the Soldier.

233
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,360
Just rest assured.

234
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,390
Be g-gentle.

235
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,450
You, the one who came in with me,

236
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,790
your plan

237
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,740
is indeed quite smart.

238
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,790
If no one informed us

239
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:30,760
that someone'd definitely come
to rescue the prisoners today,

240
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,870
you'd

241
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,600
pull it off.

242
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,440
The Soldier is here!

243
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,700
Don't let him get away!

244
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,670
Hurry up!

245
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:40,910
Come on! Run!

246
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:41,510
Go!

247
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,120
Young lady,

248
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,630
how dare you, a little demon,

249
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,550
impersonate one of us?

250
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,320
Do you know

251
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,150
who we are?

252
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,840
Do you know

253
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,910
who we are?

254
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,770
You're demons, aren't you?

255
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:12,510
Oh,

256
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,080
young lady,

257
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,240
you know quite a lot.

258
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,750
What if

259
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,730
I'm not a "young lady" as you said?

260
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,860
You want to die?

261
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,610
Little spider?

262
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,630
Don't let her escape!

263
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,320
Kill her!

264
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,750
Who are you?

265
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,400
Be careful, Young Master Fugui.

266
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,000
They are the demon king.

267
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,000
"Young Master Fugui"?

268
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,150
I know only one powerful swordsman

269
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,360
called Fugui.

270
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,720
That is

271
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,720
Wangquan Fugui.

272
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,390
So the target

273
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,720
we're going to kill today

274
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,550
is the Soldier?

275
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,130
Young Master Fugui,

276
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,490
your eyes have really recovered?

277
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,200
Mm-hmm.

278
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,550
Young Master Fugui,

279
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,340
you're exactly the one

280
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,620
I've been waiting for.

281
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:25,480
Although the Musk Demon King is not
the strongest in the Demon Realm,

282
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,550
she excels in clones and poison.

283
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,050
Unless you kill the original,

284
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,910
the clones will never die.

285
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,720
This time,

286
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,510
there's no way he can survive.

287
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,790
And the musk demon's poisonous miasma.

288
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:01,440
Come on.

289
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,550
It's not only suffocating,

290
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,240
making him unable to control the sword,

291
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,720
but it can also
disturb the Soldier's senses.

292
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,870
In such a chaotic environment,

293
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,070
it's impossible for the Soldier

294
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,750
to find her.

295
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:14,670
Young Master Fugui,

296
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:15,930
this is poisonous fog.

297
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,960
Hold your breath.

298
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:24,349
No matter how strong a swordsman is,

299
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:25,920
he needs to breathe to wield his sword.

300
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,050
How many strikes can you pull off
if you hold your breath?

301
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,310
Soldier,

302
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,510
both of you will die in the miasma today!

303
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,590
I got her!

304
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:04,170
Young Master Fugui, are you alright?

305
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,110
Soldier,

306
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,350
it's not that easy to kill me.

307
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,160
As long as the real me is safe,

308
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,550
I will never die.

309
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:13,720
Today,

310
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,430
you're not getting away.

311
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,170
Let me do it!

312
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:16,920
Don't!

313
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,070
Master ordered us

314
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:37,790
to leave no survivors!

315
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:38,510
Kill them!

316
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,280
Let's go.

317
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,680
Thanks to you finding her location,

318
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,880
I was able to kill her.

319
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,070
How did you know

320
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,480
where that demon king's real body was?

321
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,050
Young Master Fugui,

322
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,200
actually, when that demon king

323
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,530
dragged me to the stage,

324
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,640
I already found something off about her.

325
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,400
So

326
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,070
I left something

327
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,440
on her.

328
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,720
I tied my gossamer

329
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,270
on her wrist.

330
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,160
Never thought

331
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:28,410
that would help me find her location.

332
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,480
Young Master Fugui,

333
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,030
I finally managed to help you.

334
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,030
Did I do a good job?

335
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,370
I owe you one.

336
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,000
But next time,
you should run away directly.

337
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,790
I don't want you to risk your life.

338
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,430
If I run away,

339
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:46,030
what about you, Young Master Fugui?

340
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,960
They knew I'd come to the Xiyun Hall
to save people.

341
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,270
They even got their own men killed

342
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,800
just to make sure I die here.

343
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,990
If Quan Jingting made Rumu take the pill

344
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,480
not for killing me,

345
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,750
then who is his target?

346
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,090
This pair of talismans

347
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:23,790
is an upgraded version
of the Demon-Taming Talisman.

348
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,550
I added something else

349
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,210
to the Dragon Tempering Pill.

350
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,240
No.

351
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,680
He's targeting my father this time.

352
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,010
Young Master Fugui,

353
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:41,810
you should hurry back now.

354
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:44,590
Okay.

355
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,770
I'll go back with my sword.

356
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:48,290
This is too dangerous.

357
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,850
Take care of yourself.

358
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,840
Don't come to meet me again.

359
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,830
I am Chi Yan.

360
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:02,070
Looking forward to a good match.

361
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:15,790
Rumu,

362
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,550
kill him.

363
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,400
Is Quan Rumu going crazy?

364
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,860
He wants to kill his rival?

365
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,480
Hongye.

366
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,160
He's mad.

367
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:31,920
Go

368
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,450
send someone to take Rumu away.

369
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,480
Uncle,

370
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,400
it's your turn now.

371
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,350
Go down!

372
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,720
Assassin!

373
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:09,840
Hurry!

374
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,090
Protect the Chief.

375
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,960
I've been waiting for you.

376
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,640
Rumu,

377
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,880
I order you

378
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,770
to kill Wangquan Hongye

379
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,200
at all costs.

380
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,200
Rumu!

381
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,930
Why is the Soldier still alive?

382
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,010
Fugui, take the sword!

383
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,110
Rumu!

384
00:24:59,270 --> 00:24:59,790
Wake up!

385
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,280
Why is he emitting
such a strong demonic aura?

386
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:03,880
Father,

387
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:06,200
why can't I use the Divine Fire,

388
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,110
although I have
the Dongfang family's bloodline?

389
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,830
Maybe because your mother
had little spiritual power

390
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:14,070
[In Memory of Beloved Wife
Dongfang Huaizhu]

391
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,960
when she gave birth to you.

392
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:13,960
Why do you ask so?

393
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,720
Because I recently found
that all the flames

394
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,980
seem to be afraid of me.

395
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,640
But I can't control them.

396
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,120
The Dongfang Divine Fire

397
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,970
is the mightiest in the world.

398
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,400
Once the Divine Fire blazes,

399
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,350
all evil flees.

400
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,510
It's fine if you can't use that fire.

401
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,000
Without it,

402
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,550
your mother wouldn't have died.

403
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,830
Practice your swordplay harder.

404
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:35,760
and keep it pure.

405
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,400
Only in this way

406
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,520
can you forge the Heart of Sword

407
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:42,570
and complete the Heaven-and-Earth Strike.

408
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:56,530
The Dongfang Divine Fire is the nemesis
of all evil things.

409
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:57,070
Rumu,

410
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:59,030
I will keep you safe.

411
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,400
This is...

412
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,440
The aura of the Purest Sun Flame!

413
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,880
The Soldier is the Soldiers.

414
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,070
Hang in there.

415
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:20,160
Chief,

416
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:23,000
these people must've taken some evil drug.

417
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,460
It's extremely powerful,

418
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,680
making people lose their minds

419
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,680
and grow stronger

420
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,280
into a fighting machine.

421
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,000
Investigate these assassins' identities.

422
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,960
Their weapons,

423
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,030
clothes, and moves

424
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,050
will all leave some clues.

425
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,040
Understood.

426
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:44,680
Quzhuo,

427
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,340
you're a pro in elixirs and pills.

428
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,370
Come take a look.

429
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:49,200
Okay.

430
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:09,640
You...

431
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,000
Chief,

432
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:24,270
I'm guilty.

433
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,270
I was eager to win.

434
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,310
To help Rumu win the Blue Sky Convention,

435
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,570
I went to the Xiyun Hall

436
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,720
and bought the so-called elixir

437
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:35,430
that could improve power
from Elder Wangquan.

438
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:36,750
I didn't expect

439
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:39,010
that he'd attempt to kill you ruthlessly

440
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,930
with such a horrendous scheme!

441
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,970
This drug can indeed boost power.

442
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:44,880
Besides,

443
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,510
it's mixed with talismans that can control

444
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,750
a person's mind,
like the Demon-Taming Talisman.

445
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:51,160
It can deprive them of all senses,
make them feel no pain,

446
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,200
and turn them into a killing machine.

447
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,350
The master-talisman holder

448
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,610
should be at the scene.

449
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,350
Muhai,

450
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:58,610
go check it out.

451
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:00,030
Yes.

452
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Why did this thing

453
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:23,280
appear in our Yiqi Alliance again?

454
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,110
Wangquan Hongye,

455
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:29,440
I only sent a small gift into the circle.

456
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,480
Never thought

457
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,070
it could really lead to the infighting
within the Yiqi Alliance

458
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,330
and cause huge losses.

459
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,830
The Yiqi Alliance
that you desperately try to protect

460
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:38,240
looks pathetic.

461
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:41,240
You had a narrow escape today,

462
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,790
but the show

463
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,440
has just begun.

464
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:46,880
The drug they took

465
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:48,830
is called Chakuwa.

466
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,950
It's worth ten taels of gold.

467
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:55,240
I bought the Dragon Tempering Pill.
It's worth 1,000 taels of gold.

468
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,440
Did you participate in the chaos

469
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,200
caused by Wangquan Shouyi?

470
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:00,750
No.

471
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,200
I just wanted Rumu to defeat the Soldier

472
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,680
and return to the Wangquan family.

473
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,790
Is that all?

474
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:16,070
Also,

475
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:18,790
I want to reclaim

476
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,240
my surname, Wangquan.

477
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:24,350
I admit

478
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,690
that I was used by Wangquan Shouyi

479
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:30,140
and almost had Rumu
make a terrible mistake.

480
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,880
If you must punish me,

481
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,880
please sentence me to death.

482
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,240
Rumu and I

483
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:41,840
just won't return to the Western Regions.

484
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,750
Because of Rumu,

485
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,860
I already gave you a chance

486
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,200
over ten years ago.

487
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,270
Then please

488
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:04,240
forgive Rumu one more time.

489
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,960
To atone for my sins, I'm willing

490
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:10,610
to enter and guard the Sword Tomb.

491
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,110
You may leave.

492
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,240
Quzhuo,

493
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:41,790
send someone to investigate the Xiyun Hall

494
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:43,720
and look for
Wangquan Shouyi's accomplices.

495
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,200
Okay.

496
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:51,040
Lock up Quan Jingting immediately

497
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:55,400
and escort him to guard the Sword Tomb.

498
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,750
Young Master Rumu will be fine

499
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:14,750
after he wakes up.

500
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,240
But,

501
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,570
Soldier, your injuries

502
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,310
should be

503
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,730
paid more attention to.

504
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,740
I got it. You may leave.

505
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:45,490
Hongye,

506
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:50,130
[Auspice from the East]

507
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:47,070
I've taken care

508
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,750
of both the Soldier and Rumu

509
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:51,410
and got them the best physician
of the Li family.

510
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,200
Now that things have come to this point,

511
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:56,240
let's cancel

512
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,380
tomorrow's mind battles.

513
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:02,070
When Rumu gets better,

514
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:02,830
we will

515
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,570
immediately return

516
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:05,850
to the Wangquan Manor.

517
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,160
Hongye,

518
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:09,760
aren't you going to check in on him?

519
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:12,000
Actually, the Soldier

520
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,830
is hurt worse than Rumu.

521
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:22,320
He

522
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,360
has his own way to go.

523
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,560
Spoiling him too much

524
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,000
will only harm him.

525
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:35,190
Young Master Fugui asked me to leave

526
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:37,070
because there was danger
in the Blue Sky Convention.

527
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:39,000
He was afraid
that I'd get dragged into it, too.

528
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,510
I wonder how he's doing right now.

529
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:42,040
I must go back to take a look.

530
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,010
Come out.

531
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,030
The courtyard

532
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:03,690
is full of wintersweet trees.

533
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,190
And today,

534
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:06,590
it happens to be snowing.

535
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,670
Would you like

536
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:08,870
to take a look with me?

537
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:09,920
No.

538
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:12,440

539
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,960

540
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:14,920

541
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:18,440
So boring?

542
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,920
You want me to stay still here

543
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,850
and say thank you

544
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,960
to you?

545
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:23,630
Good idea.

546
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,130
I'm injured.

547
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:29,410
You stabbed me.

548
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,410
After having that little spider,

549
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:38,280
Fugui,

550
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:41,960
you've become a bit mischievous, I think.

551
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,810
Young Master Fugui...

552
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:46,800
Young Master Fugui!

553
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,610
Young Master Fugui.

554
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,110
Are you hurt?

555
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,770
Thank goodness.

556
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,440
Seeing you alright,

557
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,190
I can put my mind at ease.

558
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,630
There's an outsider here.

559
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,550
Be quiet.

560
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:14,630
I see.

561
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,030
Young Master Fugui,

562
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:18,710
I know you don't want me back

563
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,820
because you're afraid it's dangerous here.

564
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:23,190
But...

565
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,670
But we've agreed

566
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,320
that I'll only leave after I learn a set

567
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,720
of sword moves
to be able to protect myself.

568
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,230
I...

569
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,920
I haven't mastered it yet.

570
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,320
So...

571
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:36,880
So,

572
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,670
I can't leave.

573
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,030
C-Can I stay?

574
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,140
Little spider,

575
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,760
let me tell you another secret.

576
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:48,950
It can make you

577
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,030
stay here no matter what.

578
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,230
What secret?

579
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:53,190
Shut up.

580
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:55,760
No.

581
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:56,920
I must say it.

582
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,590
You could transform into a human,
all thanks to him.

583
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:00,320
What he did

584
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,480
would shorten his life by ten years.

585
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:04,760
I don't know

586
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,840
why he did that.

587
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:08,190
Anyway, now we both

588
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,190
owe you our lives.

589
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:10,800
As the saying goes,

590
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,800
as long as you are thick-skinned,

591
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,510
you can let go of grudges and gratitude.

592
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:15,190
I'm not

593

As an outsider,

596
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,850
I'm leaving now.

598
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,480
But...

599
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,490
Young Master Fugui,

600
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:51,480
why?

601
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:57,160
Because I saw you striving to survive.

602
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,060
I don't want you to be crushed by fate.

603
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,480
But Young Master Fugui,

604
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,160
you'd lose ten years of your lifespan!

605
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,810
If it were other creatures,

606
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,740
I would also save them.

607
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,700
There's nothing wrong
