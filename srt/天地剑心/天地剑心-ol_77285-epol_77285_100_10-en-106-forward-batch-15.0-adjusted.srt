[Episode 10]

3
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,860
"Little Deer"?

4
00:02:11,509 --> 00:02:13,240
You mean Lu Shu, the deer demon?

5
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:14,789
Did he...

6
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,890
come from Xishu a year ago?

7
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:18,760
Yes.

8
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:21,720
He's been lying.

9
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,680
The forests in Xishu have withered,

10
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,540
so all the deer demons
have already left that place.

11
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,890
I'll send someone to
trace his whereabouts.

12
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,690
Soldier, I want to ask you something.

13
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,920
If we can find
the true culprit behind this,

14
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,520
could you spare Qi

15
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,410
and everyone in Peach Village,
humans and demons alike?

16
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,480
Qi hasn't done anything wrong.

17
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,910
I don't have to be with him.

18
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,120
He is...

19
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,750
the gentlest, kindest man
I've ever met in this world.

20
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,000
It's time.

21
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:09,960
Qingli,

22
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,190
you need to prepare for the ceremony.

23
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,360
No matter the outcome,

24
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,240
everyone has been looking forward to it
for so long.

25
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,280
Don't let them miss

26
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,610
the night peach blossoms blooming today.

27
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,590
Okay.

28
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,540
Come on.

29
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:28,960
Here.

30
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,310
Thank you.

31
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:32,410
Here.

32
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,140
Take it.

33
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,000
Thank you.

34
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,390
Here's to you.

35
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,000
Here.

36
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,360
Here.

37
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,470
Thank you.

38
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:42,960
Here.

39
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:43,630
Take it.

40
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,230
Thank you.

41
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,470
Yours.

42
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,680
You're welcome.

43
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:50,530
Here you go.

44
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:51,870
Here.

45
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,270
I have one too.

46
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,360
Take it.

47
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,470
You are...

48
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,030
Lu Shu?

49
00:03:59,190 --> 00:03:59,630
Yes.

50
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,840
Here, have some more.

51
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:02,960
Have some more.

52
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,560
Thank you.

53
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,400
Here you go.

54
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,079
Yours.

55
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,030
Thank you.

56
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:07,590
For you.

57
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:07,960
Here.

58
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,750
Young Master Fugui,

59
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:12,550
I found Lu Shu.

60
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,620
He's right among them.

61
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,870
Qingli is here!

62
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:21,870
The fairy is here.

63
00:05:06,159 --> 00:05:07,600
The night peach blossoms bloom.

64
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,950
The prayer begins.

65
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,820
The full moon hangs in the sky.

66
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,160
We pray for humans and demons to coexist

67
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,120
and for there to be no more divisions
of race or class in this world.

68
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,560
We pray for humans and demons to coexist

69
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,270
and for there to be no more divisions
of race or class in this world.

70
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,830
Colorful butterflies dance.

71
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,950
We pray for peaceful years

72
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:36,070
and for there to be
no more killing in the world.

73
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,270
We pray for peaceful years

74
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,800
and for there to be
no more killing in the world.

75
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,660
May humans and demons coexist...

76
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,070
and no more killing.

77
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,270
So beautiful.

78
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,160
So beautiful.

79
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,290
Our wishes will surely come true.

80
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,790
The Night Peach Tree blooms.

81
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,750
I pray that all people and demons

82
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,810
may have their wishes fulfilled.

83
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:31,200
They say that Qingli is a butterfly demon.

84
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,190
Whenever her demon power is at its peak

85
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,390
during the full moon,

86
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,820
she can summon swarms of butterflies...

87
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,890
and make this Night Peach Tree bloom.

88
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,040
These are just

89
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,970
peach blossoms conjured by magic.

90
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,360
It's just that they want to believe

91
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,800
the flowers have truly bloomed.

92
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,750
They're all people
who've experienced despair,

93
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,950
who couldn't believe

94
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,030
there could be a paradise

95
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,430
in this world

96
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,409
where we could make a home.

97
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,770
But, Young Master Fugui...

98
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,159
Look.

99
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,270
In this Peach Village,

100
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,670
humans and demons alike,

101
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:12,750
strong or weak,

102
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:15,950
can live well,

103
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,430
do what they like,

104
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,560
and live...

105
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,460
the life they want to live.

106
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,010
Unfortunately...

107
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,830
What?

108
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:37,830
Nothing.

109
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,170
Young Master Fugui,

110
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,200
look over there!

111
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,630
That one is Lu Shu.

112
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,740
Rest here for a moment.

113
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,840
Okay.

114
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,360
You are Lu Shu?

115
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,530
You gave the villagers

116
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,090
the seeds for this flower, didn't you?

117
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:14,870
Tell me!

118
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,700
What's your relationship with Chakuwa?

119
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,200
Lu Shu.

120
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,080
Who are you really?

121
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,510
What exactly is

122
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,370
that coreless red flower?

123
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,030
A teleportation talisman.

124
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,440
Since you were already prepared
to run away,

125
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,300
why did you still want to fight me?

126
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,000
Tell me.

127
00:09:59,150 --> 00:09:59,670
Oh no,

128
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,670
it's a diversion tactic.

129
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:21,130
Why hasn't Young Master Fugui
come back yet?

130
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,720
Little spider.

131
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,360
My stomach hurts so much.

132
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:30,000
I feel like something's churning inside.

133
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,150
You probably just ate too much.

134
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,870
You glutton.

135
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,750
Jiu.

136
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,270
Jiu?

137
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:45,790
Jiu...

138
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,700
What happened?

139
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,240
Wake up.

140
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,000
Wake up!

141
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,390
Man.

142
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,240
Man!

143
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:10,870
Wake up!

144
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:14,760
Granny Shui.

145
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,050
Granny Shui?

146
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,120
Granny Shui?

147
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,550
Qi.

148
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,440
Qi.

149
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,510
Qingli?

150
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,390
Qingli?

151
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:45,950
Why are you...

152
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,890
Why did they...

153
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,190
Why did they all pass out?

154
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,750
They're all tired.

155
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,080
You're tired too.

156
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,770
You should take a rest.

157
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,680
Don't be afraid.

158
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,670
Soon,

159
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,150
you'll truly belong to me.

160
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,350
After preparing for so long,

161
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,060
it's finally the season
to harvest Chakuwa.

162
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,560
Qingtong.

163
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,560
Qingtong?

164
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,030
Zhang Qi.

165
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,550
Zhang Qi?

166
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:36,910
Qingli.

167
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:38,510
Come out.

168
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,270
You're the one who made the Chakuwa,

169
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,440
aren't you?

170
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:45,960
Come out!

171
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,080
Mr. Zhang took Chakuwa

172
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,390
and inhaled the phosphorus powder.

173
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,650
He's under my control.

174
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,270
Now,

175
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,670
he's completely mine.

176
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,870
Ah.

177
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,750
Soldier, you really are dull.

178

00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,800
and slaughtered at will.

348
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:49,790
Be they human

349
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:50,750
or demon,

350
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,110
among all the beings under the heavens—

351
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:56,370
who is truly fated to be trapped in
this cycle of suffering?

352
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,680
It's time.

353
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,680
It's time to end all of this.

354
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,260
You've figured it out?

355
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,810
Young Master Fugui.

356
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:07,110
Do you like Peach Village?

357
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,410
I like this place very much.

358
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,000
Yesterday, I saw you sitting in

359
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,170
Mr. Zhang's courtyard,
reading those books.

360
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,470
I started to imagine.

361
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,540
I imagined that...

362
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:24,030
if it were our home,

363
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:27,250
I'd raise a bunch of ducklings

364
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,460
and grow all kinds of flowers and plants.

365
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,950
How wonderful that would be.

366
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:35,550
Unfortunately,

367
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:38,070
everything changed overnight.

368
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,590
Everyone has been separated by death.

369
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:41,990
We've lost our family...

370
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,880
and loved ones.

371
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,480
Nothing left.

372
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,030
Qingtong.

373
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,590
I have something for you.

374
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:12,000
What is this?

375
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:24,710
[Dust-Seeker]

376
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,250
The Dust-Seeker Sword?

377
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,030
You're small in stature.

378
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:29,720
This sword

379
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:30,830
suits you.

380
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,440
This sword...

381
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:39,800
You're giving this to me,
Young Master Fugui?

382
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:42,960
Come with me.

383
00:32:58,510 --> 00:32:59,480
I promised

384
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,750
to teach you swordsmanship
sufficient for self-protection.

385
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,950
Today, I'll teach you the final lesson.

386
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,420
And the answer you seek

387
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,310
lies in the next move.

388
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,030
Now, I'll cross swords with you.

389
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,960
You need to feel it with your heart.

390
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,640
Do you see that ray of light?

391
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,310
Tell me,

392
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:19,960
what's in the light?

393
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,240
In the light,

394
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,460
there's swirling dirt everywhere.

395
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,480
That's dust.

396
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,590
Dust dances with the light,

397
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,310
revealing where the light comes from.

398
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,240
And with a sword,

399
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:39,170
what matters isn't the technique

400
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,500
but the sword essence.

401
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:46,960

402

Why rise with the wind even
when your life is as fragile as grass?

407
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:11,240

to the ground?
