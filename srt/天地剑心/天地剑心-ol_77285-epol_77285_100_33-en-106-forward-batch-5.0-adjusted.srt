00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,789

Just add a little bait as a lure,

10
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,490
and this compass will be able
to track the Black Fox.

The Wangquan Sword
and the Purest Sun Flame

be easily borrowed from Fan Yunfei.

Why is my sword meridian weakening?

17
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,680
Your sword meridian
is in Young Master Rumu.

18
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,960
He's in the prime of his life;

19
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,620
this shouldn't be happening.

20
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,150

three sword attendants at once.

We'll set off immediately.

24
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:38,840
Yes.

What a pity—

she willingly let me

35
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,870
break her dragon horns

36
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,120
and peel off her dragon scales.

37
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,480
How tragically beautiful that was.

38
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,240
Back then, I should have

39
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,740
killed you with my sword!

40
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,630
How dare you talk to me like that?

41
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,190
Fine.

42
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,580
You care about her, right?

43
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,360
Then I'll, right in front of you,

44
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,560
with my own hands,

45

Impossible.

53
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,680
How could you

54

be stronger than my True Dragon Power?

55
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,800

heartless, and loveless—

60
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,800

69
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:48,260
when you kill,
always make sure to finish your enemy off.

and hope that one day

100

I can marry Long Weiyun as my wife.
