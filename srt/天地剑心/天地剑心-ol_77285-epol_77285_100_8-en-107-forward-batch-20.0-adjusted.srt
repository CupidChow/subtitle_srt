[Sword and Beloved]

2
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,400
[Episode 8]

3
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,510
A sword that's meant to slay demons

4
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,000
has somehow grown warm.

5
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,030
Wangquan Fugui has actually

6
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,190
fallen for a petty little demon.

7
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,430
Feelings make people weak.

8
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,030
Is my clone in the circle ready?

9
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,800
It's ready at any time.

10
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,280
Lady Feng?

11
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,170
Don't look at me like that.

12
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,560
Do you know

13
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,150
my senior will be in trouble
if you stay here?

14
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,350
You have two choices:

15
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:13,680
die

16
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,400
by my sword,

17
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,140
or leave right now!

18
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm dying anyway.

19
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,080
But there's still

20
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,710
one last thing I need to do.

21
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,360
I can't leave here yet.

22
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,010
What do you mean?

23
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,880
Lady Feng,

24
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,079
have you been to
the Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai?

25
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,000
Why are you asking that?

26
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,750
Just answer me.

27
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,480
Cut the crap!

28
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,750
I tried to get the antidote
from Madam Yin,

29
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,310
so

30
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,440
I took the Gu poison myself too.

31
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,680
I don't buy it.

32
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,790
You used such a foolish way
to get the antidote?

33
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,680
I'm just

34
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,030
a lowly spider demon.

35
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,360
I couldn't think of a better way.

36
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,030
But…

37
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,280
but I've done

38
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,680
all I could.

39
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,200
I have no regrets now.

40
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,800
Her spiritual power is heavily depleted,

41
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,170
but the poison in her body
is clearly gone.

42
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,720
Let me see how long you little spider
can keep pretending.

43
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,310
Lady Feng,

44
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,120
how much longer…

45
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,400
how much longer do I have left?

46
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,920
At most,

47
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,950
three days.

48
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,240
Three days?

49
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,390
So soon.

50
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,000
Looks like…

51
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,409
looks like I can't finish my embroidery.

52
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,480
Lady Feng,

53
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,510
have you ever been to
the Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai?

54
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,040
Can you take me there,

55
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,720
Lady Feng?

56
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,159
Let go!

57
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,720
Why ask that?

58
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,090
Because Young Master Fugui

59
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,560
always wants to know

60
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,090
what that place looks like.

61
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,360
Before I die,

62
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,690
I want to embroider that place for him.

63
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,390
If you take me there,

64
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,750
I can finish it sooner.

65
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,720
Aren't you afraid

66
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,880
I'll drop you mid-flight

67
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,410
and shatter you to pieces?

68
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:28,920
You won't.

69
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,160
You may be strict,

70
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,560
but you have a soft heart.

71
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,310
Lady Feng,

72
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,750
please, just once, take me there,

73
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,480
will you?

74
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,190
You've been cured of the poison.

75
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,310
Liar!

76
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,760
Don't try to look all pitiful before me.

77
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,720
Humans and demons walk different paths.

78
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,750
If you keep staying here,

79
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,240
you'll only bring my senior trouble.

80
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,950
I'll report you to Master!

81
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,120
Lady Feng.

82
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,310
Lady Feng!

83
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,980
The poison in me

84
00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:04,480
has been neutralized?

85
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,430
This is all
just that little spider's ploy.

86
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,159
Feng Tingyun, don't be fooled.

87
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,510
She's a demon.

88
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:15,800
Once she's dead,

89
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,330
Senior Fugui will come back to his senses.

90
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:20,680
But

91
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,050
he's lived so lonely all his life.

92
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,290
Only lately has he begun to look happy.

93
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,040
Do I really…

94
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,360
have to do this?

95
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,720
Master.

96
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,000
Tingyun?

97
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,200
Why are you here?

98
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,480
You want to see me?

99
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,310
Master.

100
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,840
Is something troubling you?

101
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,510
Why are you hesitating?

102
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,950
That's not like you at all.

103
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,170
You know you can tell me anything.

104
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:24,680
Tingyun,

105
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,190
you want to see me?

106
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:30,990
Senior Fugui,

107
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,690
do you remember the first time we met?

108
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,160
I was nine.

109
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:41,000
My village was slaughtered by demons.

110
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,720
You saved me.

111
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,590
Of course I remember.

112
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,140
You rushed into the Palanquin

113
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,510
the moment it landed,

114
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,510
all covered in blood.

115
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,570
I was ridiculous, wasn't I?

116
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:01,750
No.

117
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,159
Not ridiculous at all.

118
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,450
You clearly told me where the demons were.

119
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,520
You were very brave.

120
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,360
Only you would think that way.

121
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,390
I think I fell for you right then.

122
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,490
I followed you every day in secret,

123
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,370
just to watch you practice your sword

124
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,050
and to copy your handwriting.

125
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,240
I dreamed that one day

126
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,720
I'd be as strong as you

127
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,360
and fight by your side.

128
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:42,750
Senior Fugui,

129
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,430
I know

130
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,510
you don't like me.

131
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:49,000
But what I don't understand is…

132
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,430
why her?

133
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,600
Why that frail spider demon?

134
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,120
Tingyun,

135
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:03,240
it's not what you think.

136
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,720
Every life in this world deserves respect.

137
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:08,720
I just…

138
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,570
didn't want her to be killed like that.

139
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,070
That's not it.

140
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,600
If it were really just about saving her,

141
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,750
if it were only sympathy,

142
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:21,720
then why didn't you

143
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,630
ever feel the same for me?

144
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,130
If I hadn't felt sympathy for you,

145
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,960
would you even be here now?

146
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,800
Senior Fugui,

147
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,790
I just want to know one thing today.

148
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,270
Do you…

149
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,270
like her?

150
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,310
Senior Fugui,

151
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,000
a demon

152
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,260
will always be a demon.

153
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,510
Humans and demons walk different paths.

154
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,240
Moreover, you're the Soldier.

155
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,330
There's no future between you and her.

156
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,550
I'll handle it

157
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,080
in my own way.

158
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,510
I'm leaving.

159
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,160
Senior Fugui.

160
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,030
Why aren't you ever afraid

161
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,010
I'll go tattling to Master?

162
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,140
Because you're Feng Tingyun.

163
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,640
Your sword essence is

164
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,750
free as the wind

165
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,060
and graceful as drifting clouds.

166
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,000
Master,

167
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,000
I like someone.

168
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,840
But he doesn't like me back.

169
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,000
Then, Tingyun,

170
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,200
how do you plan to handle it?

171
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:22,790
Let go,

172
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,270
or

173
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,670
keep chasing him?

174
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,630
Yeah.

175
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,610
Whether Senior Fugui likes me or not,

Go ahead.

183
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,390
You never took the antidote.

184
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,440
You gave it to me.

185
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,600
Right?

186
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,150
Yes.

187
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,350
Then what about your poison?

188
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,250
The poison in my body

189
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,360
has already been neutralized.

190
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,390
You solved the problem yourself

191
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,720
and saved your brother.

Then, Young Master Fugui,

195
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,000
shouldn't you

196
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,510
reward me with some candy?

197
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,620
I don't have any candy.

How does it feel
to fail at the finish line?

208
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,620
It's all the Soldier's fault.

help me obtain the Dragon Spine Sword

211
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,330
to wash away this shame?

212
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,150
I want the entire Yiqi Alliance

213
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,910
to kneel before me.

214
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,720
There is a way,

of course.

216
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,000
But once you have the Dragon Spine Sword,

217
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,240
what will you do with it?

218
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,320
I'll make Wangquan Hongye and his son

219
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,670
pay the price.

220
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,080
But what Madam wants
is for Wangquan Fugui

222

Why did you go to Silk Cave
without approval?

226
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,970
Why didn't you slay the demons there?

wiping out the lesser demons in Silk Cave

234
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,160
would've been easy.

Why did you do something unnecessary?

236
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,490
It's said in the Demon Realm

Their lives

245
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,970
shouldn't be taken.

You're willing to damage your reputation

Compassion

271
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,450
only makes you weak!

But now,
I feel

it's meaningless
to draw my sword for that.

00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,440
what about her?

349
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,270
She had a dream—

350
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,130
a beautiful one.

351
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,640
But that dream
shouldn't become her chains.

352
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,840
The deeper the dream,

353
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,330
the tighter the chains.

354
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:09,680
That's why I hope

355
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,200
she wakes up

356
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,160
and pursues her own path.

357
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:16,510
So,

358
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,060
you're going to send her away?

359
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,740
When the time is right.

360
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,530
Young Master Fugui,

361
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,800
I once dreamed
of seeing

362
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:35,040
mountains and rivers and watching

363
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:37,110
snow fall on the desert with you.

364
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:38,160
That was

365
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,820
probably the biggest dream
I had for the future.

366
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,180
But I also understand—

367
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:44,510
I can't

368
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,550
be with you forever.

369
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,640
Humans and demons walk different paths.

370
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,750
If you keep staying here,

371
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,270
you'll only bring my senior trouble.

372
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:55,070
I will report you to Master!

373
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:59,590
There's a distinction
between good and evil.

374
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,990
And humans and demons aren't so different.

375
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,960
If I could wish for one thing,

376
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,510
I'd want

377
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,660
to create a small world
where humans and demons live together.

378
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,070
There,

379
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,590
humans and demons can be equal

380
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:18,110
and respect and love each other.

381
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,370
When that day comes,

382
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,810
Young Master Fugui

383
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,100
will be happy for me, won't he?

384
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,010
Rumu, let's talk about you.

385
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,110
Did you find the person
you were looking for?

386
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:32,880
Me?

387
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,010
I don't have much to say.

388
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,070
Forgot your own dying words

389
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,720
by the river, huh?

390
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,450
"If you ever

391
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,180
meet
a dragon demon
with a snowflake gourd,

392
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,530
tell her this for me:

393
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:45,590
Rumu

394
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,400
never once

395
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,680
blamed her."

396
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,350
So cheesy.

397
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,350
No way I said that.

398
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,160
No way.

399
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:55,960
Mm.

400
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:56,920
Indeed.

401
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,830
Fugui, look at that cloud.

402
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,720
Doesn't it look like a dragon?

403
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,350
Nope.

404
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,960
If you talk like this,

405
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,900
we can't chat anymore.

406
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,550
Fine. It does.

407
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:13,400
Okay.

408
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,790
As you know,

409
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,510
my father went to the Western Regions.

410
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:19,590
For some reason,
he clashed with the dragon clan

411
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:21,450
and killed a lot of dragon demons.

412
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,790
One day,

413
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,410
a descendant of a dragon demon

414
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,790
kidnapped me.

415
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,400
Pretty lady,

416
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:43,510
why is this tree

417
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,160
half-dead and half-alive?

418
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:46,750
Did you tie that bell

419
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:47,790
on the branch?

420
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:48,960
It looks nice.

421
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:52,110
Why doesn't it ring, though?

422
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,200
How old are you?

423
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,310
13 years old.

424
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:58,920
I'm short now,

425
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,760
but my parents are both tall.

426
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,030
I'll be tall too.

427
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:05,000
Then you should realize

428
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,080
you've been kidnapped.

429
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,200
Yeah, I know.

430
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,590
And I also know you're super powerful.

431
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,320
You could kill me with one slap.

432
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:12,480
Then why…

433
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,070
Am I

434
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,350
too excited?

435
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,160
Should I be acting

436
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:22,310
more scared and nervous?

437
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,600
Did you bring that water

438
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,720
for me to drink?

439
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,250
You're talking so much,

440
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,100
so I guess you're not thirsty.

441
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,440
So not only are you pretty,

442
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:39,960
but you've also got a kind heart.

443
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,890
Just so you know,

444
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,800
if I have an asthma attack later,

445
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,160
don't panic.

446
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,870
It only lasts a little while.

447
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,750
I'll be fine.

448
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,470
Don't be afraid.

449
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,140
She was so unlucky to have kidnapped you.

450
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,070
Exactly.

451
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,750
She was so unlucky.

452
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,280
She kidnapped me

453
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:11,720
to trade for her mother's dragon scale.

454
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,790
But she didn't know

455
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,680
my father didn't care if I lived or died.

456
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,320
He even wanted to kidnap her.

457
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,510
So,

458
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,350
she took me and ran.

459
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:23,830
And then?

460
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,680
Then I

461
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:28,040
shamelessly followed her around.

462
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,160
She might

463
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,790
look fierce,

464
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,510
but deep down,

465
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:34,770
she was softer than anyone I had ever met.

466
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,080
Every time I had asthma,

467
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,000
she saved me.

468
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,290
She never said it out loud,

469
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:41,920
but I know—

470
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,420
she cared about me more than anyone else.

471
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,400
And slowly,

472
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,720
I started to have

473
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,240
different feelings for her.

474
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,700
And just like that,

475
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:55,790
we wandered together

476
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:56,960
for over ten years.

477
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:59,200
But how did you practice swordsmanship?

478
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,110
I chased her.

479
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,070
She got annoyed

480
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,020
and hid from me,

481
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,230
so I kept chasing her.

482
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,400
But she was too powerful,
and
I couldn't catch up.

483
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,000
So,

484
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,590
I started training.

485
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,070
Unlike you,

486
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,090
I had no sword manuals.

487
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,490
I learned by imitation.

488
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,270
In the desert,

489
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,110
I watched how bugs took flight,

490
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,400
how cacti breathed,

491
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,240
and how lizards walked.

492
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,560
When the demon wind came,

493
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,830
I watched how bugs stayed grounded.

494
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,000
And from that,

495
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,030
I found my sword path.

496
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,000
So your Heart of Sword

497
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:40,170
comes from observing all things.

498
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,720
Half right.

499
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:46,350
I'll tell you…

500
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,400
the rest someday.

501
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,750
So in the end,

502
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,000
you two still got separated?

503
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,530
Why else do you think

504
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,900
I keep looking for her?

505
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,960
But it's okay.

506
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:00,630
I'll find her no matter what.

507
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,510
I'm off.

508
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:03,840
All right.

509
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:05,550
Take care.

510
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,240
Fugui,

511
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,920
the only "impossible" in this world

512
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,720
is the one we place on ourselves.

You may go now.

Yes.

You have?

522
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,110
Then why do you look

523
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,070
unsettled, Fei?

524
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,380
The people from Xiyun Hall

525
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,960
were nearly all wiped out.

526
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:08,230
Thanks to Young Master Fugui's advice,

527
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,370
we found the person

528
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,040
who traded with Xiyun Hall.

529
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,750
He said

530
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,110
Chakuwa

531
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,330
was sold to him by a powerful demon.

532
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,640
A powerful demon?

533
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,200
Yes.

534
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,720
Who is it?

535
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,790
This demon was extremely cautious,

536
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:23,720
using a disguise during the trade.

537
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:24,950
We couldn't even tell

538
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,680
if it was male or female.

539
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:28,720
But the middleman

540
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,830
was clever too.

541
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:32,520
He left a tracking talisman on them

542
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,810
and found out where they were from.

543
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,680
Where?

544
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:38,650
Peach Village in Dingling Mountain.

545
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,440
That village is in a valley,

546
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:48,360
still part of
the Yiqi Alliance's territory.

547
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:51,960
The valley was shrouded
in miasma for years.

548
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,020
No one lived there.

549
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,250
I sent scouts to investigate.

550
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:58,830
They've just

551
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,400
sent word back.

552
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,270
Fei,

553
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,360
what's wrong this time?

554
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:07,880
Why are you hesitating?

555
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,640
Master,

556
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,680
do you remember Zhang Qi, the Black Sword?

557
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,680
Of course.

558
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:19,720
He's the heir of Zhang Zheng,
the former master of the Zhang family.

559
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,720
When he was young,

560
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,080
he had great insight.

561
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,550
Back when I lost

562
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,110
my Heart of Sword outside the circle
and returned,

563
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,440
he offered me guidance.

564
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:31,590
The miasma in that valley
in Dingling Mountain

565
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:32,720
has been dispelled.

566
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:35,240
A village has been built there

567
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,200
where humans and demons live together.

568
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,480
And the village chief is Zhang Qi.

569
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,840
[Peach Village]

570
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,170
You're back.

571
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,210
Mr. Zhang, you're back.

572
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,000
Yeah.

573
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,190
Mr. Zhang, you're back.

574
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,820
[Zhang Qi, the Black Sword,
master of the Zhang family]

575
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,550
Yeah.

576
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,010
Mr. Zhang, you're back.

577
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,880
Don't mention it.

578
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:03,550
Thank you.

579
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:04,880
Mr. Zhang, you're back.

580
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,160
Yeah.

581
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,110
Mr. Zhang, you're back!

582
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:12,830
Jiu.

583
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,830
Be careful.

584
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,530
[Jiu, a raccoon dog demon]

585
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,600
You're finally back.

586
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,720
Mr. Zhang, you're back.

587
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,000
Yeah.

588
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,720
Have you eaten yet?

589
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,480
I just made some rice cakes. Have a taste.

590
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:21,750
Thanks!

591
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:22,350
Nope,

592
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,200
he hasn't eaten.

593
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:25,960
Give all the food to me.

594
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,220
Give all the food to me.

595
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:28,720
Mr. Zhang,

596
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,720
these are balsam flower seeds.

597
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,520
Lady Qingli is sure to love them.

598
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:33,350
Thank you.

599
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,160
Give it to me. I'll carry it.

600
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,510
You must be exhausted, Mr. Zhang.

601
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:37,720
Go get some rest.

602
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,550
Step aside, everyone.

603
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:41,160
-Let Mr. Zhang go back to rest.
-I'll head up first.

604
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,000
Be careful.

605
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:52,880
[Qingli, a butterfly demon]

606
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,200
Qingli.

607
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,400
Qingli!

608
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,400
Mr. Zhang is back!

609
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,240
Look.

610
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:21,030
Here are lots of rice cakes
made by Granny Shui,

611
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,400
and flower seeds too.

612
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:24,880
These rice cakes look…

613
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:26,880
really tasty.

614
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:29,030
Except for the balsam flower seeds,

615
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,030
the rest is yours.

616
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,440
Really?

617
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,160
Then I won't refuse.

618
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,190
I'll leave you two alone now.

619
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,000
See you.

620
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,480
Qingli.

621
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,480
You've been gone for half a month.

622
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:03,310
This time,

623
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,440
I can only stay for one night.

624
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,640
I have to leave again tomorrow morning.

625
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:12,720
But don't worry.

626
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:13,720
I've nearly wrapped up

627
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,070
my family affairs.

628
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,400
When I go back this time,

629
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,510
I'll give back the Black Sword

630
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:19,440
and step down as the family master.

631
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:20,450
Then I'll never

632
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,640
leave you again.

633
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,400
Really?

634
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,310
When have I ever lied to you?

635
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,400
I'll be back

636
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,950
before the night peach blossoms bloom.

637
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:31,640
Okay.

638
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:37,030
I'll wait for you.

639
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:48,880
Young Master Rumu has left?

640
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:49,590
Yeah.

641
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,920
He's actually

642
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,640
a very good person.

643
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,530
Young Master Fugui,

644
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,920
try the peanuts.

645
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,120
They're really good.

646
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,110
If we made them into candy,

647
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,300
it'd be delicious!

648
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,640
What will you do next?

649
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,480
Actually,

650
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:18,270
last night, I overheard your conversation

651
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:19,880
with Young Master Rumu.

652
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,440
Young Master Fugui…

653
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:23,800
Young Master.

654
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:26,890
It's Mr. Fei.

655
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,510
I'll take my leave now.

656
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:36,670
Mr. Fei.

657
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:37,710
How come you didn't bring

658
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,440
a new mission scroll this time?

659
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:43,070
Am I that grim in your eyes?

660
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,360
I don't just bring you new missions.

661
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:46,880
Here—

662
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,480
this is

663
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:50,840
what you requested.

664
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,840
See if it meets

665
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,969
your requirements.

666
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:57,770
Thank you, Mr. Fei.

667
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:00,840
This time,
I didn't come

668
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,969
to tell you to slay any powerful demon.

669
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,020
But there is

670
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,110
a task.

671
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,400
The evil medicine, Chakuwa,

672
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,659
traced back to Zhang Qi's Peach Village,

673
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,000
but that doesn't mean

674
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,710
Zhang Qi himself made it.

675
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:17,000
That's true.

676
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:22,280
But both humans and demons
live in Peach Village.

677
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,740
It's the biggest suspect.

678
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:26,840
Zhang Qi
is the son of Zhang Zheng.

679
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,030
And I believe

680
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:31,230
you know who Zhang Zheng is.

681
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,230
I do.

682
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,440
He was Father's sworn brother.

683
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,030
Yeah.

684
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,940
He died outside the circle

685
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,480
over 20 years ago.

686
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:43,880
That was

687
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,970
one of Father's deepest regrets.

688
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,400
It's not that Master
is

689
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,930
covering for an old friend.

690
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,260
It's just that
he and I

691
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:57,320
both know Zhang Qi,
the Black Sword, very well.

692
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,120
He would never

693
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,030
do such a thing.

694
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:01,920
So,

695
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,110
Master wants you

696
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,840
to go to Peach Village

697
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:06,440
and bring Zhang Qi back.

698
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,550
Understood.

699
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,210
I won't let anything happen to him.

700
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:16,630
I know,

701
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,320
Master is

702
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:19,720
too strict with you,

703
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:21,960
but some pain...

704
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,690
he can only keep it bottled up inside,

705
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,470
unable to say it out loud.

706
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,480
Last night,

707
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,550
he was really upset.

708
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:36,030
I hope this time
you'll return in triumph.

709
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,320
Don't…

710
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,030
disappoint him again.

711
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,080
Don't worry, Mr. Fei.

712
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,800
I know who I am.

713
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:51,440
And I know

714
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,220
why I was brought into this world.

715
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,070
Good.

716
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,590
Then I'll take my leave.

717
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,240
Young Master Fugui,

718
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,510
you've got a new mission?

719
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:30,410
You still haven't answered my question.

720
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,110
Just now, you asked me

721
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:34,440
what I plan to do next.

722
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,920
Actually,

723
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:38,870
I haven't figured it all out yet.

724
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:39,770
But for now,

725
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,080
I'll go find my younger brother.

726
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:44,510
As for the future,

727
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,550
I'm still not sure.

728
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:50,150
Then before you've found your path,

729
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,890
come with me
to Peach Village for the mission.

730
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:01,280
Lady Feng.

731
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,400
She went out.

732
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,000
Why are you here?

733
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,280
Lady Feng,

734
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,720
I came to bring you some clothes.

735
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,510
Mind your own business.

736
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,280
You're apparently up to no good.

737
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,840
Just get out!

738
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:47,920
Lady Feng,

739
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:49,320
I made

740
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:52,550
this new outfit for you by hand.

741
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,960
I hope you like it.

742
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,590
Stop.

743
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,070
This is

744
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,150
a lotus?

745
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:15,030
Yes.

746
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,840
I've gotten over Senior Fugui.

747
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,190
But that doesn't mean

748
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:25,520
you two can be together.

749
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,250
Don't worry, Lady Feng.

750
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:32,360
I've already decided to leave.

751
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:33,280
I won't

752
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:34,880
come back again.

753
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,130
I've thought carefully

754
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,440
about what you said.

755
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:40,880
My staying here
would indeed

756
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,280
cause Young Master Fugui trouble.

757
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:42,960
Lady Feng,

758
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,280
please,

759
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,440
stay well.

760
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,450
Take good care of yourself.

761
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,440
I'm leaving.

762
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:58,800
Qingtong.

763
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,280
If only you weren't

764
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:05,840
a demon.

765
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,090
But if I weren't a demon,

766
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:16,670
maybe I never
would've met Young Master Fugui.

767
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,360
Am I right?

768
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,300
In this world,
only power commands respect.

769
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:36,630
Only if I find the Dragon Spine Sword

770
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,110
can I crush the entire Wangquan family

771
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,480
beneath me.

772
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:46,070
Master, your courage is unmatched.

773
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,360
You're one in a million.

774
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,690
You mustn't give up now.

775
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:58,320
Lu,

776
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,280
I know

777
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:05,150
you followed me
into the Sword Tomb willingly.

778
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,900
That unfilial son of mine…

779
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,550
he'd rather see me dead.

780
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,320
Only you…

781
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:19,400
are truly loyal to me.

782
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,920
I will definitely help you

783
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:28,360
make it out alive.

784
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:34,070
Then serve me

785
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:36,110
with your whole heart, will you?

786
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:31,590
The Black Fox was right—

787
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:34,360
a true dragon craves blood.

788
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,550
You want blood?

789
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:39,200
I'll give you blood.

790
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:41,510
Wangquan Hongye,

791
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,070
I don't believe

792
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:46,360
I'll keep losing to you.

793
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:58,670
Quan Jingting,

794
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,880
your powers are gone.

795
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,800
Are you ready for the Dragon Sigh Sword

796
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,150
to enter your body

797
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:06,670
and penetrate your tendons?

798
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,880
It'll be a long and painful process.

799
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:13,400
You'll slowly become
half-human and half-demon.

800
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Those who stand in my way have to die.

801
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:19,320
Those who hold me back
have to be abandoned.

802
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:22,320
Do it now!

803
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,070
Remember your promise:

804
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,840
when the time is right,

805
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,760
push the Soldier

806
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:31,320
into darkness.

807
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:45,800
Raise the Palanquin.

808
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,190
We set off for Peach Village
in Dingling Mountain.
