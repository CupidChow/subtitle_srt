[Episode 14]

3
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:53,759
Look.

4
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:56,990
What a beautiful fish-shaped lantern.

5
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,259
Before today,

6
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:00,850
I never thought that besides sword skills,

7
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:03,850
I could actually
learn to make fish-shaped lanterns.

8
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,330
Yeah.

9
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,670
In fact, Young Master Fugui,

10
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,400
you've really changed.

11
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,080
At least, you smile more often

12
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,310
now.

13
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,800
I finally found you,

14
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,310
Soldier.

15
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:28,630
Take care.

16
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,470
Are you Quan Rumu,

17
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,520
the man
who's been looking for a dragon demon?

18
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,030
What?

19
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,670
Don't I look like it?

20
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:51,160
I'm indebted to Mr. Lei
from the Western Regions.

21
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,730
Since he personally asked me to help you,

22
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,660
I'll definitely render aid to you.

23
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,120
However,

24
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,590
you look like a weak scholar.

25
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,170
You don't seem like a friend of Mr. Lei's.

26
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,000
My friend,

27
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,410
you can't judge people

28
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,630
only by their looks.

29
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,780
Take you as an example.

30
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,610
Despite that stubbly beard,

31
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,610
I bet you're a female demon

32
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,410
in disguise of a man
in order to protect yourself.

33
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,480
Members of the All-Hear Sect,
including you,

34
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,840
have profound knowledge.

35
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,000
How can you not know
what I, Quan Rumu, look like?

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,430
Now, do I seem like

37
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:27,780
a friend of Mr. Lei's?

38
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,680
Long Weiyun last showed up

39
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,260
in Dingling Mountain.

40
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,310
Then, she disappeared.

41
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,310
No one has seen her ever since.

42
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,920
The right kind of demon power.

43
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,590
It's her.

44
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,310
As a human,

45
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,030
why are you so persistently

46
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,560
looking for a dragon demon?

47
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,770
Thank you for the information.

48
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,680
Goodbye.

49
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,840
Is he really that crazy man
who rose to fame

50
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,240
with a sword strike
in the Western Regions?

51
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,720
How come he's not intimidating at all?

52
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,430
Quan Rumu,

53
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,930
you haven't found Weiyun yet.

54
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,100
No matter what,

55
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,670
you must make it through.

Soldier,

58
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:11,160
how did it feel to have your heart
pierced by 10 thousand swords?

59
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,360
My name is Gukui.

60
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,680
I'm a clone
of Madam Black Fox in the circle.

61
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,240
Madam sent me here

62
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,240
because she feels very sorry
for what happened to you.

63
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:24,310
You've made great contributions
to Yiqi Alliance

64
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,270
only to

65
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,390
end up like this.

66
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,830
Now, demons hate you.

67
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,190
Humans also hate you.

68
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,159
Is it truly worthwhile for you

69
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:36,220
to protect this world of hypocrites?

70
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,480
Why not

71
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,830
join Madam's team?

72
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,860
As long as
you help Madam out of the circle

73
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,920
with an Earth-and-Heaven Strike,

74
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,800
the order of the world will be rebuilt.

75
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,060
When that happens,

76
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,430
Madam and you
will both be the rulers of this world.

77
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,040
All the humans and demons that hate you

78
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,170
will have to submit themselves to you.

79
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,240
This...

80
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,310
is what what's truly meant for you,
Wangquan Fugui.

81
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,970
Absorbing hatred
to control someone's mind...

82
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,390
Is this the power of the Black Fox?

83
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,030
Making me leave the mountain

84
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,830
and sowing hatred in my heart...

85
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,040
All that was part of your plan, right?

86
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,070
Why?

87
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,960
Why isn't there hatred
in your heart at all?

88
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,070
You've been slandered,

89
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:25,870
betrayed,

90
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,560
and had your heart pierced
by 10 thousand swords.

91
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,480
Why isn't there resentment in you?

92
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,390
I, Wanggquan Fugui, will never
surrender myself to anyone's control.

93
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,990
Want to get out of the circle?

94
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:36,500
Dream on.

95
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,070
You're not harboring any hatred

96
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,720
because you're not

97
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,630
in complete despair yet!

98

Sooner or later,

99
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,040
you will take our side.

100
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,630
I'll be waiting for you at the extremity

101
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,510
of hatred!

102

Young Master Fugui.

104
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:00,090
It's time to eat.

105
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,160
I spent a long time cooking this porridge.

106
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,120
Young Master Fugui,

107
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,320
eat it while it's hot.

108
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,160
You too.

109
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:10,600
Okay.

110

Young Master Fugui,

111
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:20,950
from now on,

112
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,750
please stay in the house for repercussion.

113
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,280
Don't go to the brook again.

114
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,600
It's too cold there.

115
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,600
Okay.

116
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,040
I know

117
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,270
you don't want me to see your wounds.

118
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:36,870
As it happens,

119
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,159
the house

120
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,680
needs to be furnished.

121
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,120
I'll go out later,

122
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,900
while you heal yourself here.

123
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,600
Oh, right.

124
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,800
I bought this for you at the market.

125
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,780
They said this candy is sweet.

126
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,159

are you here
for medical advice or medicine?

130
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,950
Do you have the Reviving Powder?

131
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,160
If not, find some for me.

132
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,560
I'll pay big money for it.

133
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,430
I want it soon.

134
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,970
The Reviving Powder

135
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,840
must be used with caution.

136
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,840
Such a potent drug is usually taken
by those who want to see their families

137
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,150
for one last time
after their meridians have all been broken

138
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,360
on the battlefield.

139
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,750
It could shorten your life.

140
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,670
I need to take it

141

for one last time.

143
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,680
No need to observe me.

148
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,840
Just get me the medicine.

149
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,600
I'll be waiting for it in the log cabin
on the mountain.

150
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,410
Such powder comes from the Demon Realm.

Okay.

I'll put the word out right away.

I've bought many things today.

is what's truly meant for you,

I'm the Black Fox's target.

164
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,530
I must restore my power
as soon as possible.

Today,
I'm here to kill you and the Soldier.

170

Young Master Fugui has prepared for this.

171
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,880
Mistress, I suggest

172
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,050
you leave as soon as possible.

173
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,150
You think I'd believe your lies?

174
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,110
You inferior No.12580.

175
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,550
I'm not inferior.

176
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,290
I have a name now.

177
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,240
It's "Qingtong."

178
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,840
When the Soldier named you that,

179
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,100
had he seen the spider's nest
you were born into?

180
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,750
Had he realized
how much dirty mud and water

181
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,670
you gulped down for survival?

182
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:24,750
Had he known
how you servilely begged for mercy

183
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,480
when you worked undercover

184
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,630
in Chuanshu?

185
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:32,630
I didn't servilely beg for mercy.

186
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,840
You're defending the Soldier

187
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,080
only to break free of your lowly station

188
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,320
and to leech off him.

189
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,430
It's not true!

190
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,690
Of course you wouldn't think it that way,

191
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,680
because you're even lying to yourself.

192
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,550
Ask yourself.

193
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,550
If he were just a rustic,

194
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,440
would you risk your life for him?

195
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:06,900
You wouldn't!

196
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:38,440
Qingtong...

197
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,730
You just took a human form not long ago.

198
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,080
I advise you not to act recklessly.

199
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,830
If you dare to stand in my way again,

200
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,000
I'll send you to hell right away!

201
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,150
Even if I have to die here today,

202
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,750
I won't let you get through!

203
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,480
I hate hypocrites most.

204
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,180
After destroying someone else's happiness,

205
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:07,710
you're here acting like
you're fully devoted to your loved one.

206
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,720
Save your breath.

207
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,410
As long as you step aside

208
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:17,960
admit you're faking
your affection for the Soldier,

209
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,490
and humbly beg for my mercy,

210
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,000
I'll spare your life.

211
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,010
Young Master Fugui hasn't recovered yet.

212
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,880
I'm afraid he's no match for her.

213
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,510
I must keep her here today,

214
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,410
even at the expense of my life.

215
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:52,000
You're actually attempting to explode
your demon core for the Soldier?

216
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,750
Not a chance!

217
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,790
Young Master Fugui!

218
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,750
Wangquan Fugui,

219
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:13,790
you're indeed severely injured,
and your power is weakened.

220
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:14,550
Very good.

221
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,400
I'll send you to the nether world

222
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:18,800
to meet my late husband!

223
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,070
We're trapped.

224
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,240
What should we do?

225
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,780
Hold your breath and concentrate.

226
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,380
Do as I say and break through.

227
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:44,900
Break!

228
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:15,390
How are you?

229
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:17,390
I'm fine.

230
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,600
Young Master Fugui,

231
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,530
are you alright?

232
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,360
I'm fine.

233
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,790
How ridiculous.

234
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,480
The mighty Soldier

235
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,440
has actually

236
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,150
reduced himself to protecting
an inferior little demon, a slave.

237
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,320
No.12580,

238
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,030
good for you.

239
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,330
Young Master Fugui!

240
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:40,910
Let me say this again.

241
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,240
Her name is not No.12580.

242
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,400
And she's by no means inferior.

243
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,360
Stop bluffing.

244
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,720
What can you do to me,

245
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,640
given your current condition?

246
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:52,910
Today,

247
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,960
I'll kill her in front of you,

248
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:58,360
so that you can feel the pain
of losing a loved one.

249
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,950
As long as
I have a nice sword in my hands,

250
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,000
nobody can hurt her.

251
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,720
Now that you've left the Wangquan Manor,

252
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,480
how would you get hold of a nice sword?

253
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,320
Can you

254
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:14,390
create a sword out of thin air?

255
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,010
How is it possible?

256
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,570
Your power is clearly weak.

257
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,600
Why are you still able to
harness the Purest Sun Flame?

258
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,480
Although my power is weak,

259
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,790
I'm still alive.

260
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,880
And I'm the Soldier

261
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,080
that you and your fellows fear most!

262
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:02,080
You actually forged a sword
by burning your life for her?

263
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,610
Since you have a death wish,

264
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,180
I might as well grant it!

265
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,000
Young Master Fugui!

266
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,570
Yes.

267
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,550
My love,

268
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,200
I failed to take revenge

269
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,960
on Wangquan Fugui for you.

270
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,830
I'm coming to meet you
in the nether world now.

271
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:54,640
Kill me.

272
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,650
When did my father kill your husband?

273
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,350
Your husband's name
isn't on the list of the demons

274
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,080
slayed by the Wangquan family.

275
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,160
Years ago, my husband

276
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:07,440
was killed by your father Wangquan Hongye.

277
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,830
I saw it with my own eyes.

278
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,000
After my husband
exploded his own golden core,

279
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:15,590
he lied to me

280
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,240
that he'd survive.

281
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,110
His words turned out to be a fib!

282
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:24,240
I must make the Wangquan family

283
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,030
pay a price!

284
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,540
I have a question.

285
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,550
When a spider senses danger,

286
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,600
would it enter a state
of suspended animation?

287
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,240
So what if it would?

288
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,830
It means that golden-core spider demon

289
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,400
would appear to be dead
in the past 20-odd years

290
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,660
after losing all his cultivation power.

291
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,350
Being blinded by hatred,

292
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:52,480
you certainly wouldn't think of that.

293
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,350
You...

294
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:55,510
You...

295
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,220
You're saying...

296
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,880
my husband is still alive?

297
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,030
Fortunately, you didn't throw away

298
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,240
this golden crown.

299
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,200
I'll lift the seal on your husband now.

300
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,730
Then you'll know the truth.

301
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,200
My love...

302
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,720
You punk,

303
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:40,510
I suffered so much because of you!

304
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:50,930
Soldier,

305
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,510
I apologize

306
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,170
for all my wrongdoing.

307
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,940
I'm ready to be punished.

308
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,000
Take my life...

309
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,630
as you please, Soldier.

310
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,960
I only hope

311
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,610
that you can spare my husband's life.

312
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,780
Your life as a demon

313
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:21,600
shouldn't be restricted to these things.

314
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,380
Your husband just woke up.

315
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,940
Take good care of him.

316
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,930
Live your life to the fullest.

317
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,160
You may leave now.

318
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,150
But remember, don't do evil again

319
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,800
in the future.

320
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,720
Soldier,

321
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,750
my husband and I owe you a huge favor.

322
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,010
If you ever need help,

323
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,350
just let that little spider...

324
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:53,260
I mean Qingtong,

325
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,500
send a message to the Silk Cave.

326
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,560
Qingtong,

327
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,970
your journey with the Soldier

328
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,600
is destined to be rough,

329
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,240
but also wonderful.

330
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,920
Anyway,

331
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,260
I wish you all the best.

332
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:47,920
Qingtong.

333
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:52,730
Why did you attempt to
explode your demon core?

334
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:57,030
I...

335
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,030
If I'm gone

336
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,880
one day,

337
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,510
will you wait for me

338
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,770
just like how Madam Yin

339
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:08,160
waited for her husband?

is for my cousin—

510
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:44,400
your own sister, Wangquan Zui.

511
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,400
Quan Jingting,

512
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,830
watch your words and actions.

513
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:52,550
My patience

514
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,310
has its limits.

515
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:58,720
Master,

516
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,790
I was born in the greatest
prestigious family in the world

517
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:04,590
and have always been loyal to it.

518
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,490
Yet Wangquan Hongye banished me
from the family

519
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,110
over a trivial matter,

520
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,440
stripped me of my family name,

521
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,500
and exiled me
to the Western Regions.

522
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:15,160
Even so,

523
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:19,510
I've always been defending
the Wangquan family.

524
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,310
In life or death,

525
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:23,110
I am a Wangquan.

526
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:24,720
But recently,

527
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,750
during my cultivation in the Sword Tomb,

528
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:29,000
I finally realized

529
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,470
that if I keep hiding the truth
for the sake of family ties

530
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:33,750
and self-interest,

531
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,720
the spirits of our heroic ancestors

532
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,310
and the wronged souls who died

533
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,570
will never forgive me.

534
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,640
So I came here today

535
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:44,030
to expose my own kin to uphold justice,

536
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:46,090
and to tell everyone in Yiqi Alliance

537
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:50,150
that the so-called Black Fox
beyond the circle

538
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:52,030
was nothing but a lie

539
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,830
fabricated by Wangquan Hongye.

540
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,160
Quan Jingting!

541
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,330
Do you know what you're talking about?

542
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,720
Of course I do.

543
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,310
Over 20 years ago, your father,

544
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:09,200
Wangquan Shouzhuo, lost control
while practicing swordsmanship,

545
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,480
putting Wangquan Manor
on the brink of collapse.

546
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,240
Seeing the family about to fall,

547
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,200
you made up a lie about a Black Fox

548
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,730
beyond the circle
bringing doom to the world.

549
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:17,670
Your purpose

550
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,790
was to make everyone believe you,
obey you,

551
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:21,880
and fight against an enemy
that never even existed!

552
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,110
Nonsense!

553
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:23,920
Guards!

554
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:24,720
Wangquan Hongye!

555
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,200
Yes!

556
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,930
You want to rule over everything!

557
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:31,050
But there are still people
who see the truth.

558
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,690
You used that lie as bait,

559
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,400
luring the young masters of every family

560
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,720
to follow you beyond the circle
on a dangerous quest,

561
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,580
slaying the so-called Black Fox.

562
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,080
And what was the result?

563
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,550
Look at the names on it.

564
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:46,790
Look.

565
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,880
Look at the names on it!

566
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,510
The young masters and elites
of every prestigious family,

567
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:54,200
and even your own sister,

568
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:55,960
Wangquan Zui,

569
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,610
all died beyond the so-called circle.

570
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,880
Quan Jingting,

571
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:01,590
are you crazy?

572
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:02,750
Zui

573
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,520
was my dearest sister.

574
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,270
Without sacrifice,

575
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:11,250
how could your lie be convincing?

576
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:15,150
Yet my innocent cousin Zui
ended up as nothing

577
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,720
more than a pawn in your grand ambition.

578
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,720
Quan Jingting!

579
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,160
Masters,

580
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,790
I came here today

581
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,710
not expecting to leave alive.

582
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,830
But can you...

583
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,780
really just stand by and watch him

584
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,880
cover up the truth
and silence those who speak it?

585
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,420
Well...

586
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:57,270
It's...

587
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:59,160
It's a lie?

588
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,680
What should we do?

589
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,960
How could it be?

590
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,640
There's no Black Fox?

591
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,000
It's all a lie?

592
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:05,160
There's no such thing as a Black Fox?

593
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,360
He's been deceiving us all these years?

594
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,500
Who has seen it?

595
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:09,920
No one has seen the Black Fox.

596
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,360
Yes.

597
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,110
No one.

598
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:12,670
The Black Fox doesn't even exist.

599
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:14,190
-He's been deceiving us all these years.
-Hongye's been deceiving us all these years?

600
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:14,920
He lied to us!

601
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:15,760
Masters,

602
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,699
many years ago,

603
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,860
I, Wangquan Hongye, did fail you.

604
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,070
But back then,

605
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,739
my brothers and sisters and I
fought the Black Fox

606
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:24,070
with everything we had,

607
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,360
and they died a heroic death.

608
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,960
Though I survived,

609
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,050
every day since has been agony.

610
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,480
I did my best

611
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:34,150
to take care of you.

612
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:38,030
And now you would let yourselves

613
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:43,150
be swayed by the words
of that despicable man, Quan Jingting?

614
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,440
Your so-called "care"—

615
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,250
is that when the Zhang family
has a talent like Zhang Qi,

616
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:51,980
you sent the Soldier to Peach Village
to have him killed?

617
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:53,510
Quan Jingting,

618
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:54,840
watch your tongue!

619
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:57,250
When Master sent the Soldier,

620
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,140
he repeatedly instructed him

621
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,280
to bring Zhang Qi back alive!

622
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,840
But he's dead now.

623
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,110
They can say

624
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:08,110
whatever they want.

625
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,800
What about you? With all your accusations,

626
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,710
do you even have proof?

627
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:11,480
Proof?

628
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,510
You want proof?

629
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:14,360
Alright.

630
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,150
Today,

631
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:20,190
I'll show you the proof.

632
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,880
Master Tianmen has arrived!

633
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:36,420
[Tianmen Wenlu,
Descendant of Taoist Tianmen]

634
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,670
I am Tianmen Wenlu,

635
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:36,530
son of the Taoist Tianmen.

636
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:39,150
Greetings, everyone.

637
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,960
Tianmen, there's no need for formality.

638
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,760
Let me ask you.

639
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,070
Over 20 years ago,

640
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,030
was it true as the rumor
in the martial world

641
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:48,840
that Wangquan Hongye led a group
across Heavenly Gate,

642
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,670
which your father guarded,

643
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,110
into the so-called world
beyond the circle?

644
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:54,670
Yes.

645
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,300
Eight people went out
and only two returned,

646
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:58,920
leaving

647
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,000
many dead there,

648
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,030
right?

649
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:02,960
Yes.

650
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,020
Over 20 years ago,

651
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,760
did Chief Wangquan claim

652
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,020
that everything he did

653
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,920
was to slay the Black Fox

654
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,440
and bring an end

655
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,640
to the Eternal Night?

656
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,000
No!

657
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,850
Before they went beyond the circle,

658
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,910
the Chief came to Heavenly Gate,

659
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,150
threatening and bribing my father

660
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:33,410
into setting up a Mind-losing Formation

661
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:36,190
in that so-called world beyond the circle.

662
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,920
That Mind-losing Formation

663
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,780
drove the young masters mad,

664
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:42,760
making them turn on and kill each other.

665
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,110
The so-called Black Fox

666
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,390
never existed at all!

667
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,150
It's been so many years.

668
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:53,550
We don't even know
what happened back then.

669
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,920
Tianmen,

670
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,960
do you know what you are talking about?

671
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,320
Of course I do.

672
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,480
I have evidence.

673
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,590
This

674
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,530
is a Mind-losing Talisman,

675
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,710
written in blood by the Chief himself

676
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,030
over 20 years ago.

677
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,230
There were seven of these talismans
in total.

678
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,280
Together,
they can form the Mind-losing Formation,

679
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,190
which can make people turn against
and kill each other—

680
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,510
but they won't harm

681
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,180
the one who created it.

682
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:29,290
The Mus are masters
of talisman arts.

683
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:32,370
Master Mu, please take a look.

684
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,790
This is indeed a Mind-losing Talisman.

685
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,590
Everyone, take a step back.

686
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,890
[Exterminate All Demons]

687
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,510
A blood spell

688
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:15,320
only protects its owner.

689
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,050
It truly was written

690
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:19,870
in the Chief's blood.

691
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,320
This is a frame-up!

692
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,670
A frame-up?

693
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:24,630
If it wasn't his blood,

694
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:26,110
who would have used it 20 years ago

695
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,810
to frame him?

696
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,510
If you weren't the mastermind,

697
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,760
why were you the only one who came back?

698
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:35,670
The Black Fox...

699
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:37,760
Quan Jingting,

700
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,110
you two are in league!

701
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,710
Listen, everyone.

702
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:44,710
Our Chief

703
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:46,960
is lying again.

704
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:49,630
But today,

705
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,990
no one will believe you anymore.

706
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:52,880
You...

707
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,280
are the one full of lies,

708
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:58,070
framing and slandering others!

709
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:58,670
Everyone,

710
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,380
please ask yourselves honestly

711
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,940
what kind of man Master truly is

712
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,150
and how much he has done
for Yiqi Alliance over the years.

713
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,950
And what sort of treacherous man

714
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,440
is Quan Jingting?

715
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,240
My father, Taoist Tianmen,

716
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,360
was a hero his whole life.

717
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:32,710
Since he was coerced by Wangquan Hongye,

718
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,530
he was haunted by his conscience

719
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,360
and died in depression.

720
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,110
Today,

721
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:42,990
I'll clear my father's name with my blood!

722
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,280
Tianmen!

723
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,400
Tianmen Wenlu

724
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,550
proved the truth
of his words with his life!

725
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:54,590
Brothers, let's go!

726
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,320
Fei!

727
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,480
Stop!

728
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,280
Quan Jingting,

729
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:25,320
today it is not that I,
Wangquan Hongye, cannot fight,

730
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,070
but that I cannot bear
to see the people of Yiqi Alliance

731
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:29,400
slaughter each other.

732
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,110
Tingyun.

733
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:33,760
Master!

734
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,810
Drop your sword!

735
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:51,400
Cousin,

736
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,630
I won't let you die so easily.
