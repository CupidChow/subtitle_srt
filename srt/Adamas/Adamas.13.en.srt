00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,428
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:56,511 --> 00:00:58,972
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:01,224 --> 00:01:02,350
Mr. Lee.

4
00:01:03,477 --> 00:01:06,605
I am your defense attorney.

5
00:01:10,317 --> 00:01:11,943
I have one twisted fate.

6
00:01:14,696 --> 00:01:18,158
I became a prosecutor to prevent
any more victims like my father.

7
00:01:18,742 --> 00:01:21,244
But now, I'm about to defend
my father's killer.

8
00:01:22,496 --> 00:01:25,290
- I refuse your help.
- You don't have the right to do that.

9
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:29,878
I know you were falsely accused,
and I'll help you clear your name.

10
00:01:30,504 --> 00:01:33,340
But to do that,
you need to tell me the truth.

11
00:01:34,382 --> 00:01:36,426
Once we face the truth,

12
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:40,347
we won't be able to go back.

13
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:43,683
We've come too far to go back.

14
00:01:45,852 --> 00:01:46,895
Right?

15
00:01:50,398 --> 00:01:53,109
I'm going to make sure
that everyone knows you're innocent.

16
00:01:53,193 --> 00:01:55,445
Why are you doing this
when I didn't even ask for it?

17
00:01:55,529 --> 00:01:57,364
I refused to acknowledge...

18
00:01:59,699 --> 00:02:02,452
that my biological father
killed my father, Song Soonho.

19
00:02:07,249 --> 00:02:09,084
- How...
- Did I know?

20
00:02:12,045 --> 00:02:13,713
That you were my real father?

21
00:02:16,633 --> 00:02:18,051
I'm not interested in that.

22
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:21,304
Tell me something that intrigues me.

23
00:02:21,388 --> 00:02:23,306
For example, who killed him?

24
00:02:24,683 --> 00:02:26,560
They say the truth lies in the past.

25
00:02:27,727 --> 00:02:30,397
So let's dig into that past.

26
00:02:33,942 --> 00:02:35,360
You haven't changed...

27
00:02:36,987 --> 00:02:37,987
at all.

28
00:02:53,003 --> 00:02:54,671
- Run!
- Hey!

29
00:02:56,506 --> 00:02:58,592
You darn scumbags!

30
00:02:59,384 --> 00:03:02,053
Gosh, those... Darn it.

31
00:03:03,346 --> 00:03:04,973
Hey, you're with them, right?

32
00:03:05,056 --> 00:03:06,224
- Who are they?
- Let me go.

33
00:03:06,308 --> 00:03:08,518
Why should I? I know you're with them.

34
00:03:08,602 --> 00:03:10,186
You should be apologizing to me.

35
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,950
- What's wrong with you?
- Don't play dumb.

36
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,524
- I'm not with them.
- How are you so brazen?

37
00:03:15,108 --> 00:03:16,318
You saw me?

38
00:03:16,818 --> 00:03:18,612
Yes, I did.

39
00:03:19,487 --> 00:03:22,741
But I couldn't recognize you.

40
00:03:22,824 --> 00:03:27,078
I only realized it was you
after I saw your mother.

41
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:29,581
- Let me go. It wasn't me.
- Say that you're sorry!

42
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,541
- You little scumbag.
- Calm down.

43
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,501
Suhyeon, are you okay?

44
00:03:33,585 --> 00:03:35,837
Hey, lady. Educate your son properly.

45
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:38,048
He's already stealing
other people's belongings.

46
00:03:38,548 --> 00:03:39,716
Who? Him?

47
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:41,639
That's not true, Mom.
I was only looking at it.

48
00:03:42,135 --> 00:03:43,261
Don't you dare lie.

49
00:03:43,345 --> 00:03:45,639
I know they're your friends!

50
00:03:45,722 --> 00:03:47,807
Come on! They're not my friends!

51
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:51,770
I don't want to hear it. I know
you've been looking at that every day.

52
00:03:51,853 --> 00:03:53,373
And today, you were going to steal it.

53
00:03:53,605 --> 00:03:55,148
- Do as you please.
- What?

54
00:03:55,231 --> 00:03:57,400
- Call the cops if you want.
- Suhyeon!

55
00:03:57,484 --> 00:04:00,111
- That little...
- I'm sorry, ma'am.

56
00:04:00,195 --> 00:04:02,238
What is he going to become
when he grows up?

57
00:04:02,322 --> 00:04:05,867
Unbelievable. Kids like him
will only end up stealing things.

58
00:04:05,951 --> 00:04:07,577
- Jeez.
- What did you say?

59
00:04:08,203 --> 00:04:11,331
Excuse me. What did you just say?

60
00:04:11,915 --> 00:04:14,125
- What?
- He said he didn't do it.

61
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:16,795
Why do you keep accusing him
when he said he was innocent?

62
00:04:16,878 --> 00:04:20,215
Look at you.
The least you could do is apologize.

63
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:22,759
- Kneel. Kneel instead.
- What did you say?

64
00:04:22,842 --> 00:04:25,637
You should apologize
for your son's wrongdoing!

65
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,806
Your son did something wrong.

66
00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:30,016
So how dare you act so shamelessly?

67
00:04:30,517 --> 00:04:32,644
How dare you when your son stole from me?

68
00:04:32,727 --> 00:04:34,521
Do you think... Who are you?

69
00:04:34,604 --> 00:04:36,356
- That's enough.
- What do you...

70
00:04:37,816 --> 00:04:38,733
That's enough.

71
00:04:38,817 --> 00:04:40,026
I...

72
00:04:41,736 --> 00:04:44,030
Fine, I'll stop.

73
00:04:44,489 --> 00:04:45,657
Jeez.

74
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,993
Consider yourself lucky. Gosh.

75
00:04:49,494 --> 00:04:50,704
Thank you.

76
00:05:14,644 --> 00:05:15,770
Aren't you...

77
00:05:22,694 --> 00:05:24,029
Hey...

78
00:05:26,948 --> 00:05:28,241
Why are you here?

79
00:05:29,284 --> 00:05:31,327
- Youngsin.
- Don't call my name.

80
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,788
We broke up long ago.

81
00:05:34,372 --> 00:05:36,374
I followed you here to tell you that.

82
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,877
Leave. I have nothing more to say.

83
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,253
That boy...

84
00:05:43,548 --> 00:05:44,548
It's him, right?

85
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,011
No.

86
00:05:49,429 --> 00:05:51,181
He has nothing to do with you.

87
00:05:52,807 --> 00:05:53,808
I'm sorry.

88
00:05:54,434 --> 00:05:57,645
I only did that back then to protect you.

89
00:05:57,729 --> 00:05:58,772
Protect me?

90
00:05:59,898 --> 00:06:01,316
From whom?

91
00:06:01,816 --> 00:06:03,818
Who in the world are they?

92
00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:08,281
It's all a lie.

93
00:06:10,742 --> 00:06:11,993
I had no idea

94
00:06:13,244 --> 00:06:14,996
what you did for a living

95
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,665
until I saw you on the news.

96
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:22,003
They said you were a thief,

97
00:06:22,087 --> 00:06:24,297
and everything just made perfect sense.

98
00:06:24,964 --> 00:06:26,049
I see.

99
00:06:27,217 --> 00:06:31,346
"So that's why he said
he didn't have any friends or family."

100
00:06:32,055 --> 00:06:35,266
He was only trying to hide the fact

101
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:38,728
"that he was nothing but a thief."

102
00:06:43,775 --> 00:06:45,443
So why did you come here now?

103
00:06:46,277 --> 00:06:47,737
I didn't have any other intentions.

104
00:06:47,821 --> 00:06:51,699
I just wanted to watch you from afar
and see how you were doing.

105
00:06:51,783 --> 00:06:52,783
No.

106
00:06:54,702 --> 00:06:55,995
You don't need to do that.

107
00:06:56,996 --> 00:06:59,457
Just consider us dead.

108
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:00,875
I don't want my son to know

109
00:07:01,876 --> 00:07:04,337
that his father is a thief.

110
00:07:04,838 --> 00:07:06,589
Don't you ever come here again.

111
00:07:12,595 --> 00:07:13,595
Honey.

112
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:22,480
Excuse me.

113
00:07:27,318 --> 00:07:28,862
MOVING SERVICE

114
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:43,042
Didn't you call a mover?

115
00:07:44,794 --> 00:07:46,045
Oh.

116
00:07:50,633 --> 00:07:51,843
Gosh.

117
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,764
Twins?

118
00:07:57,557 --> 00:07:59,517
Suhyeon is the older one.

119
00:08:00,101 --> 00:08:02,478
Woosin is the younger one.

120
00:08:03,563 --> 00:08:05,064
You look like a happy family.

121
00:08:06,524 --> 00:08:09,652
That's when I learned that you were twins.

122
00:08:10,904 --> 00:08:13,448
I've never met your brother, Woosin,

123
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,285
but I'm sure you two look very alike.

124
00:08:20,288 --> 00:08:22,832
Gosh, you really look like a prosecutor.

125
00:08:24,751 --> 00:08:26,628
Really? So it's a success.

126
00:08:28,713 --> 00:08:30,816
SONG SUHYEON
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

127
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,135
Woosin, I need youto pretend
to be me and meet someone.

128
00:09:20,181 --> 00:09:21,474
Hello, ma'am.

129
00:09:22,141 --> 00:09:23,309
I'd like to use

130
00:09:24,227 --> 00:09:26,104
this room for the time being.

131
00:09:26,896 --> 00:09:28,398
Are you feeling ill?

132
00:09:29,232 --> 00:09:31,317
Director Eun didn't mention anything.

133
00:09:31,401 --> 00:09:32,860
Please don't tell my father.

134
00:09:34,237 --> 00:09:36,447
A VIP is going to use this room.

135
00:09:37,031 --> 00:09:38,031
Yes, ma'am.

136
00:09:39,367 --> 00:09:41,286
May I ask who's coming?

137
00:09:45,623 --> 00:09:48,209
I'm sorry, ma'am. I'll get the room ready.

138
00:09:51,004 --> 00:09:52,547
- Sir.
- Yes?

139
00:09:56,092 --> 00:09:57,218
Please be discreet.

140
00:09:58,636 --> 00:10:00,305
This is related to Haesong.

141
00:10:02,974 --> 00:10:04,100
Yes, ma'am.

142
00:10:05,518 --> 00:10:07,186
This is the twelve o'clock news.

143
00:10:07,687 --> 00:10:09,439
Tomorrow is the election.

144
00:10:09,522 --> 00:10:11,774
Due to the weekend, however,

145
00:10:11,858 --> 00:10:15,069
we predict many individualswill
be going on a trip.

146
00:10:15,486 --> 00:10:17,697
Worried about the low turnout,

147
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:20,908
the partiesare encouraging people to vote.

148
00:10:22,368 --> 00:10:26,039
Let's put aside our sentiments
and only look at the facts.

149
00:10:26,914 --> 00:10:30,710
In short, after you saw
how happy our family was,

150
00:10:31,169 --> 00:10:34,714
you were planning to leave
like a true man would.

151
00:10:35,631 --> 00:10:36,799
So you decided to move,

152
00:10:36,883 --> 00:10:40,136
and it just so happened
that my father was the mover.

153
00:10:40,762 --> 00:10:41,762
In that case,

154
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:46,893
how in the world did my father
fall victim to murder?

155
00:10:51,272 --> 00:10:52,523
Mr. Lee.

156
00:10:54,525 --> 00:10:55,610
It was all

157
00:10:56,903 --> 00:10:58,279
due to my greed.

158
00:10:59,364 --> 00:11:01,949
I thought my disappearing
would fix everything.

159
00:11:02,033 --> 00:11:05,578
But then I had to face
the wretched reality.

160
00:11:06,662 --> 00:11:09,374
I felt bad that your family
was struggling to make ends meet.

161
00:11:09,874 --> 00:11:11,793
And it broke my heart...

162
00:11:13,586 --> 00:11:14,754
that I couldn't help either.

163
00:11:42,615 --> 00:11:43,866
You again?

164
00:11:55,962 --> 00:11:59,298
It must pain you to be abandoned.

165
00:12:00,591 --> 00:12:01,843
You never drink.

166
00:12:01,926 --> 00:12:03,010
Leave...

167
00:12:04,303 --> 00:12:05,721
before I kill you.

168
00:12:11,227 --> 00:12:12,353
Sir.

169
00:12:13,855 --> 00:12:16,524
Don't you think this situation is unfair?

170
00:12:17,191 --> 00:12:18,443
You were used.

171
00:12:18,609 --> 00:12:20,987
You should take your revenge
on the damn bastards.

172
00:12:21,904 --> 00:12:25,199
That diamond arrow is 300 carats.

173
00:12:25,283 --> 00:12:26,367
The price

174
00:12:26,617 --> 00:12:29,704
is much higher than what you can fathom.

175
00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:31,873
I'll give you half of the share.

176
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:34,375
Take that and flee to the Philippines.

177
00:12:34,459 --> 00:12:36,294
Even Haesong won't be able to find you.

178
00:12:36,377 --> 00:12:37,920
They have over 7,000 islands.

179
00:12:38,713 --> 00:12:39,755
You know that.

180
00:12:46,095 --> 00:12:47,847
The unveiling is around the corner.

181
00:12:48,055 --> 00:12:50,141
They'll move it to the venue
the night before.

182
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,101
I'll take care of security.

183
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:55,188
You can sneak in during a shift change.

184
00:12:55,271 --> 00:12:56,939
I have the floor plan for the safe too.

185
00:12:59,984 --> 00:13:03,654
Sir, you should start afresh.

186
00:13:03,738 --> 00:13:06,073
I promise that your future will be rosy.

187
00:13:13,581 --> 00:13:14,582
So tell me.

188
00:13:26,511 --> 00:13:27,553
When's the date?

189
00:13:30,973 --> 00:13:32,058
Thank you.

190
00:13:32,808 --> 00:13:33,935
So?

191
00:13:37,396 --> 00:13:40,233
Why did my father have to die
because of your scheme?

192
00:13:51,994 --> 00:13:53,162
That was tasty.

193
00:13:54,038 --> 00:13:55,665
Let's begin now that you're done.

194
00:13:56,499 --> 00:13:57,583
All right.

195
00:13:58,751 --> 00:14:00,586
After being kidnapped,

196
00:14:00,753 --> 00:14:02,713
they put that explosive vest on you

197
00:14:02,797 --> 00:14:04,423
and sent you to the SIH?

198
00:14:05,758 --> 00:14:07,593
Who kidnapped you?

199
00:14:08,636 --> 00:14:10,763
Where should I begin?

200
00:14:12,306 --> 00:14:14,267
I'll start from the very beginning.

201
00:14:14,892 --> 00:14:18,563
So everything happened
due to an incident from 22 years ago.

202
00:14:18,646 --> 00:14:21,691
Hold on. Twenty-two years ago?

203
00:14:22,441 --> 00:14:24,443
- Correct.
- So in 2000?

204
00:14:24,527 --> 00:14:26,737
That's right. The summer of 2000.

205
00:14:26,821 --> 00:14:28,155
How old were you back then?

206
00:14:30,575 --> 00:14:31,701
Seven.

207
00:14:36,539 --> 00:14:37,623
By the way,

208
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:40,668
you keep cutting me off.

209
00:14:42,044 --> 00:14:43,337
You don't want my statement?

210
00:14:44,171 --> 00:14:46,799
- What are you talking...
- Detective Nam.

211
00:14:50,845 --> 00:14:51,887
Did you see that?

212
00:14:51,971 --> 00:14:55,516
He kept interrupting me from testifying.

213
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,603
I'm going to get a copy of this.

214
00:15:08,154 --> 00:15:09,234
VIDEO FROM HAESONG CEREMONY

215
00:15:12,366 --> 00:15:13,200
UPLOADING

216
00:15:13,284 --> 00:15:15,161
THE PAGE YOU ARE LOOKING FOR
CANNOT BE FOUND

217
00:15:19,999 --> 00:15:21,709
I think Haesong has made a move.

218
00:15:23,169 --> 00:15:25,171
Probably.

219
00:15:25,254 --> 00:15:27,673
I was prepared for this.

220
00:15:29,467 --> 00:15:30,676
Contact the media.

221
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,472
But sir. There's no point
if they won't publish it.

222
00:15:34,555 --> 00:15:35,973
Call them to the SIH.

223
00:15:36,057 --> 00:15:37,725
Tell them it's an important announcement.

224
00:15:38,392 --> 00:15:39,477
Which is...

225
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,729
Tell them it's about the suicide bombing.

226
00:15:46,567 --> 00:15:48,402
- A press conference?
- Yes.

227
00:15:48,986 --> 00:15:50,488
Mr. Ha told me.

228
00:15:52,114 --> 00:15:54,116
Unbelievable. Ha Woosin?

229
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,703
He came by yesterday on the pretext
of meeting with the chairman.

230
00:15:58,287 --> 00:16:01,165
They must've sent him
because he's their only way in.

231
00:16:01,248 --> 00:16:03,751
We need to be cautious for the time being.

232
00:16:04,335 --> 00:16:06,212
I was also told

233
00:16:06,587 --> 00:16:07,838
to lie low.

234
00:16:07,922 --> 00:16:10,341
Mr. Kang has no choice now.

235
00:16:10,424 --> 00:16:12,927
He'll reveal all of his cards
and take the bull by the horns.

236
00:16:14,095 --> 00:16:15,513
The SIH will be exposed.

237
00:16:15,596 --> 00:16:18,891
They'll reveal what the SIH did
and why they were after Haesong.

238
00:16:21,435 --> 00:16:23,604
- Are you saying...
- My task here is over.

239
00:16:24,522 --> 00:16:27,441
We'll end the secret investigation
and do an open investigation.

240
00:16:27,525 --> 00:16:29,360
It'll be an all-out war.

241
00:16:31,862 --> 00:16:33,489
We'll take a big hit.

242
00:16:33,572 --> 00:16:35,074
We have no time.

243
00:16:35,157 --> 00:16:38,244
We need to make a move
before the VIP steps down.

244
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:41,497
Jeez. What's that?

245
00:16:43,999 --> 00:16:45,209
What?

246
00:16:47,253 --> 00:16:48,629
There are people watching.

247
00:17:01,475 --> 00:17:03,686
- Get going then.
- All right.

248
00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:06,564
Take better care of yourself.
You look haggard.

249
00:17:06,647 --> 00:17:07,732
You look even scarier.

250
00:17:08,733 --> 00:17:10,401
Be safe, okay?

251
00:17:10,484 --> 00:17:11,819
Got it.

252
00:17:13,237 --> 00:17:15,197
- Hey, let's go.
- Yes, sir.

253
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:27,960
Mr. Choi, we have an emergency.

254
00:17:45,269 --> 00:17:46,520
Hello, sir.

255
00:17:47,021 --> 00:17:48,981
You need to come with me.

256
00:17:49,565 --> 00:17:51,942
Where are we going all of a sudden, sir?

257
00:17:54,028 --> 00:17:55,070
Fishing.

258
00:18:09,585 --> 00:18:13,464
I'm sorry, sir,
but I'm terrible at fishing.

259
00:18:15,424 --> 00:18:16,717
It's simple.

260
00:18:18,177 --> 00:18:21,472
You just need to determine
when to reel it in.

261
00:18:22,473 --> 00:18:26,101
You throw the bait and wait endlessly.

262
00:18:27,478 --> 00:18:28,521
Yes, sir.

263
00:18:28,604 --> 00:18:30,898
Has it been three years
since you came to Haesongwon?

264
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:35,528
How about working directly under me now?

265
00:18:38,781 --> 00:18:42,326
I'll do my utmost
if you just give me the chance, sir.

266
00:18:42,409 --> 00:18:43,619
Chance?

267
00:18:47,373 --> 00:18:48,791
Chance.

268
00:18:50,501 --> 00:18:51,669
Hmm...

269
00:19:13,691 --> 00:19:14,692
Where's Mr. Jeong?

270
00:19:14,775 --> 00:19:16,068
He's inside, sir.

271
00:19:18,445 --> 00:19:19,445
Let's go.

272
00:20:14,418 --> 00:20:16,003
Junkyung.

273
00:20:16,712 --> 00:20:20,466
Did you propose
stealing the Adamas to Lee Changwoo?

274
00:20:25,346 --> 00:20:26,597
Why?

275
00:20:36,732 --> 00:20:39,318
How would I dare
to do something like that, sir?

276
00:20:39,401 --> 00:20:41,820
No, sir. You're mistaken.

277
00:20:41,904 --> 00:20:43,864
This is a misunderstanding.

278
00:20:44,156 --> 00:20:47,952
All I wanted to do was retrieve
the Adamas that he had stolen.

279
00:20:49,036 --> 00:20:52,081
Sir.

280
00:20:52,164 --> 00:20:53,207
Sir.

281
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:57,461
You bastard. Have you gone insane?

282
00:20:58,545 --> 00:21:00,339
Stop yapping and be quiet.

283
00:21:00,422 --> 00:21:02,216
You're going to die soon anyway.

284
00:21:02,299 --> 00:21:03,509
Damn it.

285
00:21:04,051 --> 00:21:06,095
You little bastard.

286
00:21:12,017 --> 00:21:13,268
Sir!

287
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,400
Sir!

288
00:21:19,483 --> 00:21:23,862
I did propose stealing the Adamas to him!

289
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,589
That's right.

290
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:45,384
I did say that.

291
00:21:45,467 --> 00:21:49,013
I said that
because I was blinded by greed.

292
00:21:49,388 --> 00:21:52,349
And I've been regretting it

293
00:21:52,433 --> 00:21:54,059
for the past 22 years.

294
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:58,272
Sir, please spare me this once.

295
00:21:59,898 --> 00:22:01,734
I do want to spare you.

296
00:22:04,611 --> 00:22:06,613
But you should tell me the truth first.

297
00:22:06,697 --> 00:22:10,576
Yes, sir.
I'll tell you nothing but the truth.

298
00:22:10,659 --> 00:22:14,997
I had gone to Lee Changwoo's place
to find the Adamas.

299
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:24,965
Sir.

300
00:22:27,092 --> 00:22:28,302
The door was open.

301
00:22:43,609 --> 00:22:44,777
Sir?

302
00:23:14,723 --> 00:23:16,892
Mr. Kim, I'm here.

303
00:23:17,142 --> 00:23:19,353
The chairman will call you. Hurry.

304
00:23:19,812 --> 00:23:21,271
You need to find the Adamas first.

305
00:23:21,688 --> 00:23:22,815
Yes, sir.

306
00:23:25,442 --> 00:23:27,820
Damn it.

307
00:24:23,834 --> 00:24:26,503
What? You're not Lee Changwoo.

308
00:24:26,879 --> 00:24:29,214
No wonder. Damn.

309
00:24:29,923 --> 00:24:31,258
I'm screwed.

310
00:25:09,838 --> 00:25:11,048
Yes, sir.

311
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,091
I got it.

312
00:25:13,675 --> 00:25:14,801
I'm on my way.

313
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,394
I saw him.

314
00:25:25,979 --> 00:25:29,316
His sleeves were drenched in blood.

315
00:25:30,442 --> 00:25:31,526
It was him.

316
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:35,280
He was the one who kidnapped
and put the explosive vest on me.

317
00:25:37,199 --> 00:25:38,951
Did you see his face clearly?

318
00:25:40,285 --> 00:25:41,912
And you still remember him?

319
00:25:42,579 --> 00:25:43,580
Exactly.

320
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:48,961
I just can't forget his face.

321
00:25:57,928 --> 00:25:59,179
Dad.

322
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,015
Yes? What is it?

323
00:26:02,099 --> 00:26:05,435
He was drenched in blood.

324
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:06,687
What? Blood?

325
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:09,314
Yes. I saw it.

326
00:26:09,398 --> 00:26:11,358
Where? Where is he?

327
00:27:23,055 --> 00:27:24,056
Over there!

328
00:27:28,602 --> 00:27:29,853
Hey! Stop!

329
00:27:53,752 --> 00:27:55,712
Stay still. Damn it.

330
00:28:04,513 --> 00:28:06,306
It was all his doing.

331
00:28:06,389 --> 00:28:07,766
He knew I'd be coming,

332
00:28:07,849 --> 00:28:10,352
so he placed the fake Adamas there.

333
00:28:10,936 --> 00:28:13,480
So you retrieved the fake Adamas

334
00:28:14,231 --> 00:28:15,649
that he had put there?

335
00:28:15,732 --> 00:28:16,775
Yes, sir.

336
00:28:17,067 --> 00:28:20,612
I just wanted to return the Adamas to you

337
00:28:20,821 --> 00:28:22,322
and put an end to everything.

338
00:28:22,405 --> 00:28:25,659
But there was a witness.

339
00:28:26,326 --> 00:28:28,966
Are you the one who called?
Could you please explain what happened?

340
00:28:29,496 --> 00:28:31,748
Someone drenched in blood...

341
00:28:31,832 --> 00:28:33,542
- Drenched in blood?
- Yes.

342
00:28:40,882 --> 00:28:43,468
Damn it. Everything is screwed up.

343
00:28:47,764 --> 00:28:49,307
Chairman Kwon

344
00:28:49,975 --> 00:28:52,811
didn't know that it was fake.

345
00:28:52,894 --> 00:28:55,147
That's why you made a false confession?

346
00:28:56,314 --> 00:28:57,774
Because that was the safest bet.

347
00:28:59,276 --> 00:29:00,694
Had Chairman Kwon known the truth,

348
00:29:02,404 --> 00:29:05,407
he would've come after you two.
Just like now.

349
00:29:12,873 --> 00:29:16,209
I truly had no idea that it was fake, sir.

350
00:29:16,835 --> 00:29:17,919
You didn't?

351
00:29:18,003 --> 00:29:20,463
- No, sir. I don't know anything.
- Junkyung.

352
00:29:20,547 --> 00:29:23,425
I swear. I don't know anything, sir!

353
00:29:23,508 --> 00:29:24,968
- You don't?
- No, sir.

354
00:29:25,051 --> 00:29:27,804
Lee Changwoo. That jerk knows everything.

355
00:29:27,888 --> 00:29:30,473
I'm certain. Please believe me.

356
00:29:33,101 --> 00:29:34,101
I do.

357
00:29:36,396 --> 00:29:37,731
I do believe you.

358
00:29:37,814 --> 00:29:39,149
Thank you, sir.

359
00:29:39,816 --> 00:29:41,109
I don't think you know anything.

360
00:29:45,405 --> 00:29:46,531
But what a pity.

361
00:29:52,078 --> 00:29:53,413
I would've spared you...

362
00:29:55,123 --> 00:29:57,542
had you known something.

363
00:29:59,211 --> 00:30:01,755
- Pardon?
- What's the point of sparing you

364
00:30:03,256 --> 00:30:06,426
when you don't even know
where the real Adamas is?

365
00:30:12,098 --> 00:30:13,099
Mr. Choi.

366
00:30:14,434 --> 00:30:15,434
Yes, sir.

367
00:30:16,645 --> 00:30:17,812
This is your chance.

368
00:30:21,358 --> 00:30:23,693
Sir!

369
00:30:24,819 --> 00:30:27,322
Sir! Please spare me!

370
00:30:29,658 --> 00:30:30,658
Damn it!

371
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:32,577
Sir!

372
00:30:32,661 --> 00:30:34,204
Sir!

373
00:30:46,341 --> 00:30:47,341
Congrats.

374
00:30:48,134 --> 00:30:51,054
You get to take the team leader down.
It's quite a feat.

375
00:30:51,137 --> 00:30:52,973
It wasn't me!

376
00:30:53,056 --> 00:30:55,809
It wasn't me! Sir!

377
00:30:55,892 --> 00:30:57,519
You bastard!

378
00:31:26,172 --> 00:31:27,173
Damn it.

379
00:31:31,428 --> 00:31:33,013
What are you guys doing?

380
00:31:34,264 --> 00:31:36,599
You're whispering in front of me?

381
00:31:45,317 --> 00:31:47,444
So this is what you're saying.

382
00:31:47,527 --> 00:31:50,739
You witnessed a murder 22 years ago.

383
00:31:51,323 --> 00:31:52,324
Correct.

384
00:31:52,532 --> 00:31:54,284
And the culprit kidnapped you?

385
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:57,871
- Correct.
- And made you wear that explosive vest?

386
00:31:58,788 --> 00:31:59,873
Correct.

387
00:32:00,707 --> 00:32:02,584
What does that have to do with Haesong?

388
00:32:02,792 --> 00:32:06,713
Because that man works for Haesong.

389
00:32:06,838 --> 00:32:07,881
I see.

390
00:32:08,882 --> 00:32:12,177
Don't tell me that the man you saw

391
00:32:13,345 --> 00:32:15,430
was Chairman Kwon Jaekyu.

392
00:32:19,476 --> 00:32:20,810
Detective.

393
00:32:22,896 --> 00:32:24,856
Are you even willing to investigate this?

394
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:37,118
Ms. Kim, we have two hypotheses

395
00:32:37,202 --> 00:32:39,579
about the terror bombing.

396
00:32:39,996 --> 00:32:42,374
The culprit of that murder you witnessed

397
00:32:42,457 --> 00:32:44,000
was Lee Changwoo.

398
00:32:44,084 --> 00:32:45,710
He was falsely accused.

399
00:32:45,794 --> 00:32:47,587
He wasn't the one I saw.

400
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:50,965
Are you just saying that
because of Song Suhyeon?

401
00:32:52,217 --> 00:32:54,552
Because Lee Changwoo
is his biological father?

402
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:57,972
- What?
- Was this all Song Suhyeon's idea?

403
00:32:58,056 --> 00:32:59,349
Did he want to involve Haesong?

404
00:33:00,141 --> 00:33:04,020
Right. Coincidentally, he even appeared
at the terror bombing scene.

405
00:33:04,396 --> 00:33:06,356
Was it truly a coincidence,
or was it planned?

406
00:33:09,734 --> 00:33:12,487
What a load of bull.
As if we'd make such a plan.

407
00:33:14,364 --> 00:33:17,325
So no? Then here's the second hypothesis.

408
00:33:17,784 --> 00:33:19,285
Who is Hwang Byungchul?

409
00:33:19,619 --> 00:33:21,663
He is the biggest opponent
of the current president.

410
00:33:21,746 --> 00:33:24,958
And Kang Hyukpil
is a close associate of the president.

411
00:33:25,417 --> 00:33:26,835
We've confirmed that Kang

412
00:33:26,918 --> 00:33:29,879
warned Candidate Hwang about the bombing
and told him to evacuate.

413
00:33:29,963 --> 00:33:31,756
And the latter rushed toward his car.

414
00:33:32,382 --> 00:33:35,135
But the bomb was in the car.

415
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:39,013
That means Kang was the one
who lured Hwang to his vehicle.

416
00:33:41,266 --> 00:33:42,725
Don't be unreasonable.

417
00:33:42,809 --> 00:33:43,893
Ms. Kim.

418
00:33:44,894 --> 00:33:46,729
This is what we're curious about.

419
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:50,984
We're not interested in a murder
witnessed by a little girl 22 years ago,

420
00:33:51,443 --> 00:33:53,323
but in the mastermind
behind the terror bombing.

421
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,405
Was it Prosecutor Song

422
00:33:56,281 --> 00:33:57,949
or Mr. Kang?

423
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,414
What a bunch of lunatics.

424
00:34:05,999 --> 00:34:07,792
Are you serious?

425
00:34:21,764 --> 00:34:23,266
- Let's go.
- Sir.

426
00:34:23,892 --> 00:34:26,853
What if Haesong claims that
we accused them before checking our facts?

427
00:34:26,936 --> 00:34:28,062
Then I'll take the fall.

428
00:34:39,657 --> 00:34:43,161
KOREAN SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS HEADQUARTERS

429
00:34:48,416 --> 00:34:51,753
I heard the SIH was making
an important announcement, so I came.

430
00:34:52,003 --> 00:34:54,672
I'm personally interested
in what it may be.

431
00:34:54,756 --> 00:34:59,093
Right. To make it easier for you,

432
00:34:59,677 --> 00:35:03,431
I've already handed out
the press release to the journalists.

433
00:35:08,061 --> 00:35:11,064
I heard there's a connection
between the cabin explosion in Mount Goduk

434
00:35:11,147 --> 00:35:14,817
and the terror bombing
that occurred recently.

435
00:35:22,242 --> 00:35:23,660
I heard the two explosives...

436
00:35:26,204 --> 00:35:27,956
were similar.

437
00:35:38,675 --> 00:35:40,969
Would you like to talk in private?

438
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:42,929
Or should I continue?

439
00:35:49,185 --> 00:35:51,688
Ms. Kwon sure isn't photogenic.

440
00:35:56,734 --> 00:35:58,027
It's the SIH's doing, isn't it?

441
00:35:58,611 --> 00:36:00,989
You're so predictable. How tacky.

442
00:36:02,115 --> 00:36:05,660
Mr. Kang Hyukpil.

443
00:36:06,202 --> 00:36:08,830
How do you think the public will react
once they find out

444
00:36:09,789 --> 00:36:11,749
that the explosives came from the SIH?

445
00:36:11,833 --> 00:36:14,252
How will you prove that it was us?

446
00:36:14,335 --> 00:36:16,838
Our infiltration team
doesn't exist on paper.

447
00:36:16,921 --> 00:36:18,965
Your men who died in that cabin

448
00:36:19,048 --> 00:36:21,551
may be disguised
as innocent victims for now.

449
00:36:22,051 --> 00:36:25,680
But how long do you think it'll take
for us to frame them

450
00:36:25,888 --> 00:36:27,265
as being heinous terrorists?

451
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:30,518
Then do that.

452
00:36:30,602 --> 00:36:31,769
Well, aren't you a tough guy.

453
00:36:34,731 --> 00:36:35,940
I'm so intimidated.

454
00:36:37,317 --> 00:36:41,279
I'm not ignorantly
threatening to eliminate the SIH.

455
00:36:41,988 --> 00:36:43,781
Let's settle this politically.

456
00:36:44,365 --> 00:36:47,452
Discreetly disband your infiltration team.

457
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:52,123
That's not up to me to decide.

458
00:36:52,248 --> 00:36:55,835
I'm aware of that. Of course I am.

459
00:36:56,336 --> 00:36:59,380
I know you're nothing but a mere puppet.

460
00:37:00,465 --> 00:37:01,465
You're just...

461
00:37:03,217 --> 00:37:04,719
a chess piece.

462
00:37:11,726 --> 00:37:13,019
Take it.

463
00:37:13,102 --> 00:37:14,102
BAEK MINSEOK

464
00:37:18,483 --> 00:37:19,963
Will you reject the president's call?

465
00:37:20,943 --> 00:37:24,238
Don't act like you're strangers.
I know you talk to each other every day.

466
00:37:33,206 --> 00:37:34,540
Hello, sir.

467
00:37:41,381 --> 00:37:42,548
Understood, sir.

468
00:37:45,635 --> 00:37:47,470
Do you finally get it?

469
00:37:49,389 --> 00:37:50,807
It's the president's call.

470
00:37:54,811 --> 00:37:56,104
Resign from your position.

471
00:37:59,107 --> 00:38:01,609
Use this to buy yourself...

472
00:38:01,693 --> 00:38:03,319
ONE BILLION WON

473
00:38:04,612 --> 00:38:05,988
a decent suit.

474
00:38:09,659 --> 00:38:12,036
As for the reason for your resignation,

475
00:38:12,578 --> 00:38:15,540
we'll come up with a valid one.

476
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:24,215
You should be thankful
that it's ending with only you resigning.

477
00:38:24,298 --> 00:38:25,633
You should know that.

478
00:38:43,985 --> 00:38:46,404
Okay. Let me in on it.

479
00:38:46,487 --> 00:38:48,448
What will happen to Ms. Kwon?

480
00:38:48,531 --> 00:38:49,741
I don't know.

481
00:38:49,824 --> 00:38:53,286
Come on. You're the only one who knows

482
00:38:53,369 --> 00:38:55,204
how the chairman truly feels.

483
00:38:56,622 --> 00:38:59,333
Wait. Come on, now.

484
00:38:59,917 --> 00:39:03,713
Once she's fired,
I'll become the head butler.

485
00:39:04,297 --> 00:39:06,966
So of course I should be aware
of everything under this roof.

486
00:39:08,509 --> 00:39:10,011
Ms. Yoon.

487
00:39:10,636 --> 00:39:13,931
Watch the news. It'll come out soon.

488
00:39:14,807 --> 00:39:15,725
The news?

489
00:39:15,808 --> 00:39:18,227
How long do you think
they'll keep her alive?

490
00:39:31,282 --> 00:39:32,533
Are you okay?

491
00:39:33,117 --> 00:39:34,410
Bring me the key.

492
00:39:36,078 --> 00:39:37,622
I made a mistake, didn't I?

493
00:39:39,081 --> 00:39:41,375
- Pardon?
- About Mr. Lee.

494
00:39:42,794 --> 00:39:44,253
Is it bothering you, sir?

495
00:39:44,837 --> 00:39:46,714
I should've fed him dinner.

496
00:39:47,715 --> 00:39:50,092
I should've killed him

497
00:39:50,176 --> 00:39:52,845
when he was on a full stomach.

498
00:42:19,617 --> 00:42:22,244
I'll bring out your meal
once Mr. Kwon arrives.

499
00:42:22,828 --> 00:42:23,829
No, I want it now.

500
00:42:24,455 --> 00:42:27,166
I can't stomach anything
if he's in front of me.

501
00:42:28,209 --> 00:42:29,543
Yes, ma'am.

502
00:42:29,627 --> 00:42:32,296
MR. JEONG
WE GOT HER

503
00:42:43,516 --> 00:42:45,142
Where are you taking me?

504
00:42:45,476 --> 00:42:47,770
I was told to escort you to the VIP room.

505
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:04,704
All right. This is the final question.

506
00:43:05,663 --> 00:43:07,665
Where is the real Adamas?

507
00:43:11,794 --> 00:43:12,920
Mr. Lee.

508
00:43:13,337 --> 00:43:16,132
You wouldn't hand over the goods
without getting paid first.

509
00:43:20,803 --> 00:43:22,221
I have nothing more to say.

510
00:43:22,304 --> 00:43:23,389
Where did you stash it?

511
00:43:23,472 --> 00:43:26,517
Get home safe. It was nice meeting you.

512
00:43:30,229 --> 00:43:32,314
Chairman Kwon won't let you off the hook.

513
00:43:35,484 --> 00:43:37,361
You don't know him that well.

514
00:43:37,945 --> 00:43:40,865
He never kills anyone
he needs something from.

515
00:43:42,533 --> 00:43:44,577
I'm living proof of that.

516
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,621
What about Woosin and me?

517
00:43:49,373 --> 00:43:51,083
I know Chairman Kwon.

518
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:53,878
As soon as he gets his hands
on the real Adamas,

519
00:43:54,628 --> 00:43:55,921
he will...

520
00:43:58,090 --> 00:43:59,508
kill us all.

521
00:44:06,057 --> 00:44:07,475
You're so stubborn.

522
00:44:08,309 --> 00:44:10,061
So you're the one I take after.

523
00:44:11,562 --> 00:44:12,563
Fine.

524
00:44:13,689 --> 00:44:14,815
I hope today...

525
00:44:17,526 --> 00:44:19,195
isn't the last day

526
00:44:20,112 --> 00:44:21,739
I see you alive.

527
00:44:26,702 --> 00:44:27,828
See you again.

528
00:45:13,749 --> 00:45:15,417
Take a seat.

529
00:45:17,253 --> 00:45:18,754
Are you going to just stand there?

530
00:45:18,963 --> 00:45:21,048
I don't have much to say.

531
00:45:22,049 --> 00:45:23,551
But you must want to chat.

532
00:45:34,895 --> 00:45:36,814
Don't look at me like that.

533
00:45:37,022 --> 00:45:39,191
You were planning on killing me
from the beginning.

534
00:45:40,317 --> 00:45:43,529
After that, you were going
to hand over the fake Adamas

535
00:45:43,612 --> 00:45:45,823
to Chairman Kwon.

536
00:45:46,782 --> 00:45:49,493
You needed to buy time
before fleeing the country.

537
00:45:49,952 --> 00:45:53,581
Even if he found out,
you could've just put the blame

538
00:45:53,664 --> 00:45:55,249
on me.

539
00:45:56,625 --> 00:46:01,213
I wouldn't have been able to defend myself
since I'd be dead and long gone.

540
00:46:03,132 --> 00:46:04,383
However,

541
00:46:05,634 --> 00:46:07,386
I'm still alive and well.

542
00:46:08,429 --> 00:46:10,097
And the Adamas is gone.

543
00:46:11,223 --> 00:46:12,766
A piece of advice for my dear junior.

544
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:16,770
You won't last in Team A for long
if you keep this up.

545
00:46:19,315 --> 00:46:21,025
That's why I'm here.

546
00:46:21,775 --> 00:46:24,820
To retrieve the Adamas and to kill you.

547
00:46:25,404 --> 00:46:27,573
If you don't tell me where it is,

548
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,618
- that seat will be your deathbed.
- And then?

549
00:46:32,453 --> 00:46:34,288
How will you find the Adamas?

550
00:46:40,377 --> 00:46:41,503
You're right.

551
00:46:43,088 --> 00:46:44,256
Fine, then.

552
00:46:45,257 --> 00:46:47,417
If that's what you want,
then I'll grant you your wish.

553
00:46:47,927 --> 00:46:50,179
Have fun rotting in jail.

554
00:46:50,763 --> 00:46:52,932
Whether it be 10 or 20 years,

555
00:46:53,015 --> 00:46:55,226
you'll never be released

556
00:46:55,726 --> 00:46:57,186
unless you tell me where it is.

557
00:46:58,187 --> 00:47:01,065
Let's see how long you'll hold out,
my dear senior.

558
00:47:02,024 --> 00:47:03,442
Keep this in mind.

559
00:47:04,276 --> 00:47:05,319
I will never

560
00:47:06,362 --> 00:47:08,364
go down alone.

561
00:47:08,989 --> 00:47:11,492
I won't be lonely after I die...

562
00:47:12,952 --> 00:47:14,370
since I'll have you by my side.

563
00:47:54,201 --> 00:47:55,202
Let's go.

564
00:48:04,086 --> 00:48:06,922
So you're a prosecutor?

565
00:48:08,215 --> 00:48:09,215
Hold on, please.

566
00:48:11,135 --> 00:48:12,928
YOU BETTER PUT ON A GOOD ACT

567
00:48:13,012 --> 00:48:15,014
I JUST MET IM DUKSOO

568
00:48:15,597 --> 00:48:16,724
Mr. Im Duksoo.

569
00:48:19,018 --> 00:48:20,138
I'm Prosecutor Song Suhyeon.

570
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:22,813
Sure.

571
00:48:23,939 --> 00:48:24,857
What do you want?

572
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:26,483
I'm here

573
00:48:27,776 --> 00:48:30,446
regarding the Kangchun Penitentiary
Massacre that you committed.

574
00:48:40,581 --> 00:48:43,459
I read your statement thoroughly
and listened to your deposition.

575
00:48:43,542 --> 00:48:46,003
- But?
- I'm confused about a few things.

576
00:48:46,712 --> 00:48:48,630
I'd appreciate your cooperation.

577
00:48:49,548 --> 00:48:52,676
Which parts are you confused about?

578
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:55,262
I believe I gave a detailed statement.

579
00:48:56,388 --> 00:48:58,807
That is exactly what I find odd.

580
00:49:00,142 --> 00:49:02,186
- What?
- This is my take on it.

581
00:49:02,853 --> 00:49:06,023
You were providing detailed information,
not just a statement.

582
00:49:06,106 --> 00:49:09,151
As if you were directing
the investigation.

583
00:49:12,863 --> 00:49:16,283
You're really pushing my buttons.

584
00:49:16,367 --> 00:49:19,036
Is this what I get for cooperating?

585
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:21,914
Do I look like I'm lying to you?

586
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:24,540
This is unexpected.

587
00:49:25,584 --> 00:49:26,460
What is?

588
00:49:26,543 --> 00:49:29,296
Anyone with a strong sense
of self-assurance like you

589
00:49:29,671 --> 00:49:32,007
wouldn't care what others think.

590
00:49:32,591 --> 00:49:34,301
You wouldn't try to persuade me like this.

591
00:49:35,052 --> 00:49:37,221
Your statements on your previous crimes

592
00:49:37,304 --> 00:49:40,474
were very meticulous and precise.

593
00:49:42,226 --> 00:49:43,560
You only stated the facts.

594
00:49:44,937 --> 00:49:47,856
So why is this statement different?

595
00:49:48,357 --> 00:49:50,025
Both your statement

596
00:49:50,692 --> 00:49:52,277
and the deposition say the same things.

597
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:54,947
"I'm telling the truth."

598
00:49:56,448 --> 00:49:57,533
"Please trust me."

599
00:49:58,867 --> 00:50:00,411
It's as if you're pleading.

600
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:04,373
What are you going on about?

601
00:50:06,333 --> 00:50:07,709
Let's keep this short.

602
00:50:08,794 --> 00:50:10,087
Questions.

603
00:50:11,255 --> 00:50:12,255
Sure.

604
00:50:14,508 --> 00:50:16,385
What was your motive for the crime?

605
00:50:16,468 --> 00:50:20,097
As a death-row inmate, killing a few more
wouldn't change anything.

606
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:22,391
There was something unusual
about one of your victims.

607
00:50:23,725 --> 00:50:24,977
The one with the slit throat.

608
00:50:26,019 --> 00:50:27,396
That annoying bastard.

609
00:50:27,479 --> 00:50:30,441
The autopsy report said
that it was done postmortem.

610
00:50:31,525 --> 00:50:32,568
To just him.

611
00:50:34,236 --> 00:50:35,236
Why?

612
00:50:37,197 --> 00:50:38,991
I told you. He annoyed me.

613
00:50:39,074 --> 00:50:41,160
He was always bragging
about how well-off he was.

614
00:50:41,243 --> 00:50:43,370
It irritated the living hell out of me.

615
00:50:44,496 --> 00:50:46,707
Not because you needed
to make sure he was dead?

616
00:50:48,584 --> 00:50:51,587
He was the financial advisor
of an investment company.

617
00:50:52,212 --> 00:50:53,380
A subsidiary of Haesong.

618
00:50:59,386 --> 00:51:00,721
He was the target, wasn't he?

619
00:51:02,306 --> 00:51:03,640
What are you talking about?

620
00:51:03,724 --> 00:51:05,100
Simply put,

621
00:51:06,351 --> 00:51:08,896
did Haesong order the hit?

622
00:51:14,443 --> 00:51:16,153
I believe your son took the reward.

623
00:51:16,236 --> 00:51:17,821
You crazy, little...

624
00:51:17,905 --> 00:51:20,741
He made a hefty sum from shares
in a matter of hours.

625
00:51:24,828 --> 00:51:27,915
What I'm trying to say is that I know

626
00:51:28,415 --> 00:51:29,958
what you know.

627
00:51:35,297 --> 00:51:36,297
Hey.

628
00:51:37,674 --> 00:51:39,134
You're making a mistake right now.

629
00:51:40,636 --> 00:51:41,636
I know.

630
00:51:41,678 --> 00:51:45,474
They'll be informed of our meeting
and what we talked about.

631
00:51:45,557 --> 00:51:47,351
They'll probably kill you.

632
00:51:52,606 --> 00:51:56,109
I'm not too desperate
about getting out of here alive anyway.

633
00:51:56,193 --> 00:51:59,279
Well, how about your son?

634
00:52:10,999 --> 00:52:14,461
The Kangchun Penitentiary case.
Suhyeon was right.

635
00:52:17,172 --> 00:52:18,882
SUHYEON

636
00:52:19,883 --> 00:52:21,551
- Yes?
- How did it go?

637
00:52:21,802 --> 00:52:23,679
Haesong is definitely involved.

638
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:27,933
There's more to this than
Haesongsimply supporting Hwang's pledge

639
00:52:28,016 --> 00:52:29,476
regarding the death penalty.

640
00:52:29,559 --> 00:52:32,104
The victim was too involved with Haesong.

641
00:52:33,188 --> 00:52:34,648
Haesong doesn't have coincidences.

642
00:52:35,232 --> 00:52:36,566
How did you find out about this?

643
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:39,528
A prosecutor named Han
was in charge of the Kangchun case.

644
00:52:40,279 --> 00:52:42,322
I used him to get into ARES.

645
00:52:42,406 --> 00:52:45,158
Come on. Of course I know.

646
00:52:45,242 --> 00:52:48,787
How could Haesong have anything
to do with that heinous crime?

647
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:51,707
He was trying to show
his loyalty to Haesong.

648
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:53,333
But he was demoted instead.

649
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:55,335
He should've just feigned ignorance.

650
00:52:55,544 --> 00:52:56,795
So I was looking into that...

651
00:53:04,386 --> 00:53:05,679
Woosin.

652
00:53:07,597 --> 00:53:08,598
What is it?

653
00:53:08,682 --> 00:53:09,766
Let's talk again later.

654
00:53:17,232 --> 00:53:18,525
Suhyeon.

655
00:53:58,231 --> 00:53:59,274
Who are you?

656
00:54:00,692 --> 00:54:01,692
Sun.

657
00:54:09,534 --> 00:54:11,495
Die.

658
00:54:11,578 --> 00:54:12,578
Die!

659
00:54:16,792 --> 00:54:18,377
It's you who will die.

660
00:54:19,044 --> 00:54:20,629
But not today.

661
00:54:20,712 --> 00:54:21,755
Shut up.

662
00:54:25,258 --> 00:54:28,678
Did the Adamas have traces
of Song Soonho's blood

663
00:54:28,762 --> 00:54:30,597
or didn't it?

664
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,182
You little...

665
00:54:45,779 --> 00:54:46,780
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

666
00:54:46,863 --> 00:54:48,198
BLOOD ANALYSIS ON NEXT PAGE

667
00:54:48,281 --> 00:54:49,491
BLOOD ANALYSIS RESULT

668
00:54:49,574 --> 00:54:50,968
NO BLOOD ON THE ARROWHEAD OR THE SHAFT

669
00:54:50,992 --> 00:54:53,703
Your dad's blood wasn't on it.

670
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:00,335
I heard the chairman gave you two days

671
00:55:01,586 --> 00:55:04,297
to find the real Adamas.

672
00:55:06,716 --> 00:55:07,926
You have one day left.

673
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:10,178
See you tomorrow.

674
00:55:13,181 --> 00:55:14,516
Do you think I'll let you go?

675
00:55:16,726 --> 00:55:18,770
Where did you get the audacity
to come here alone?

676
00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:24,860
He said not today.

677
00:55:25,777 --> 00:55:27,654
Wait one more day,

678
00:55:27,737 --> 00:55:29,698
and I'll kill you.

679
00:55:32,117 --> 00:55:33,201
What's wrong?

680
00:55:34,578 --> 00:55:35,871
Too scared to kill me right now?

681
00:55:38,081 --> 00:55:39,666
Do you have time for this?

682
00:55:40,584 --> 00:55:42,461
You should go to Kim Seohee.

683
00:55:50,051 --> 00:55:51,178
What did you say?

684
00:55:56,099 --> 00:55:57,267
The interrogation is over.

685
00:55:57,350 --> 00:55:59,811
We've confirmed that you were kidnapped,

686
00:55:59,895 --> 00:56:02,665
and we've found a key suspect
who's responsible for the terror bombing.

687
00:56:02,689 --> 00:56:05,025
A key suspect? Who?

688
00:56:06,026 --> 00:56:08,066
That's confidential
since we're still investigating.

689
00:56:08,111 --> 00:56:09,696
Do you expect me to believe that?

690
00:56:10,906 --> 00:56:12,949
You should just go while we let you.

691
00:56:13,033 --> 00:56:15,535
What about Mr. Lee Changwoo's case?

692
00:56:15,619 --> 00:56:17,537
That doesn't fall within our jurisdiction.

693
00:56:17,621 --> 00:56:18,705
Wait.

694
00:56:20,499 --> 00:56:21,917
I'm Prosecutor Song from the SIH.

695
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,710
- Prosecutor Song.
- Let's go.

696
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:29,883
What was that?

697
00:56:34,095 --> 00:56:37,349
BREAKING NEWS
KANG HYUKPIL OF THE SIH RESIGNS

698
00:56:39,809 --> 00:56:40,894
Let's go.

699
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:53,073
Thanks.

700
00:56:54,074 --> 00:56:56,618
Thank the person who saved you, not me.

701
00:57:12,217 --> 00:57:13,217
You're late.

702
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:15,178
I was busy.

703
00:57:17,347 --> 00:57:18,431
What do you want?

704
00:57:19,849 --> 00:57:21,518
Why were you at the studio apartment?

705
00:57:22,602 --> 00:57:23,645
Oh, that?

706
00:57:24,229 --> 00:57:25,355
"Oh, that?"

707
00:57:26,481 --> 00:57:29,359
I doubt you thought I wouldn't know.

708
00:57:29,943 --> 00:57:31,403
What's up your sleeve?

709
00:57:34,406 --> 00:57:36,992
For the Adamas. I want to find it.

710
00:57:39,411 --> 00:57:40,412
What are you doing?

711
00:57:42,539 --> 00:57:44,249
Why would you do that?

712
00:57:45,834 --> 00:57:47,335
Because I want it.

713
00:57:55,802 --> 00:57:56,803
Hyesoo.

714
00:57:57,596 --> 00:57:59,514
Do you even know what you're saying?

715
00:58:00,515 --> 00:58:01,891
You want the Adamas?

716
00:58:01,975 --> 00:58:03,935
Not the Adamas, but Haesong.

717
00:58:07,981 --> 00:58:11,026
I'm considering
becoming Haesong's successor.

718
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:14,070
I don't see a reason why I can't.

719
00:58:18,241 --> 00:58:19,909
You're adorable.

720
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:23,204
I see. This must be why
Minjo loved you so dearly.

721
00:58:23,288 --> 00:58:24,789
Keep yapping.

722
00:58:25,749 --> 00:58:28,293
In the end,
I'll take everything away from you.

723
00:58:30,712 --> 00:58:32,756
Whether it be Haesong or the Adamas,

724
00:58:35,258 --> 00:58:36,968
you won't get any of Minjo's things.

725
00:58:41,598 --> 00:58:45,018
Is that so? Then good luck with that.

726
00:58:45,894 --> 00:58:48,855
But you know what? You should hurry.

727
00:58:51,191 --> 00:58:54,653
Because I'll be getting my hands
on the Adamas today.

728
00:58:57,697 --> 00:58:58,697
Today?

729
00:59:01,409 --> 00:59:02,410
Today.

730
00:59:14,798 --> 00:59:17,342
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE

731
00:59:21,346 --> 00:59:22,639
Where are we going?

732
00:59:27,644 --> 00:59:29,145
Where are we going?

733
00:59:58,550 --> 01:00:01,177
TO WOOSIN
I'M AT THE SIH. WHERE ARE YOU?

734
01:00:05,682 --> 01:00:08,643
What's going on? Are they packing up?

735
01:00:09,644 --> 01:00:11,146
Things don't look good here.

736
01:00:17,569 --> 01:00:19,320
- What are you doing?
- Can't you see?

737
01:00:20,363 --> 01:00:22,657
Exactly. Why are you packing up?

738
01:00:23,241 --> 01:00:25,201
The infiltration team was disbanded today.

739
01:00:25,285 --> 01:00:26,411
Disbanded?

740
01:00:26,995 --> 01:00:28,121
It's the higher-up's order.

741
01:00:29,122 --> 01:00:31,082
Higher-up? President Baek?

742
01:00:34,711 --> 01:00:37,213
So? You're just going
to let go of everything?

743
01:00:37,297 --> 01:00:38,673
Are you serious?

744
01:00:38,757 --> 01:00:41,801
I lost. I've been defeated.

745
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:44,262
Why the sudden change of heart?

746
01:00:44,345 --> 01:00:45,785
Are you trying to save yourself now?

747
01:00:45,847 --> 01:00:47,491
I wouldn't have begun
if that was the case.

748
01:00:47,515 --> 01:00:48,516
Then what is it?

749
01:00:51,227 --> 01:00:52,270
I told you.

750
01:00:54,397 --> 01:00:55,607
It's my defeat.

751
01:00:56,566 --> 01:00:59,319
Do you know how many of my colleagues
died without being recognized?

752
01:01:00,111 --> 01:01:01,404
Twenty-three.

753
01:01:02,781 --> 01:01:05,575
Some of them were very young
and had blind trust in me.

754
01:01:05,658 --> 01:01:08,203
Then there were others
who were like family to me.

755
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:16,211
I don't want
any more blood on my hands. That's all.

756
01:01:25,553 --> 01:01:26,971
I'M AT THE SIH.
WHERE ARE YOU?

757
01:01:30,892 --> 01:01:33,019
According to an internal source,

758
01:01:33,102 --> 01:01:35,772
Director Kang Hyukpil, who
was involved in this incident,

759
01:01:35,855 --> 01:01:37,482
stepped down from his position.

760
01:01:37,565 --> 01:01:40,235
- He resigned? What is this nonsense?
- Sergeant Ko Chulmin

761
01:01:40,318 --> 01:01:42,445
was a whistleblowerwho
opposed the SIH's wrongdoings.

762
01:01:42,529 --> 01:01:45,031
His suicide note revealed his
discontenttoward its corruption

763
01:01:45,114 --> 01:01:47,450
and pointed the finger at Kang.

764
01:01:47,534 --> 01:01:49,494
- A suicide note?
- It has been revealed

765
01:01:49,577 --> 01:01:51,788
that he decided to endhis
and his family's lives

766
01:01:51,871 --> 01:01:54,415
due to the immense stress.

767
01:01:54,999 --> 01:01:58,461
Meanwhile, the police have yetto
make an official announcement.

768
01:01:58,545 --> 01:02:01,673
They are currently looking into the case

769
01:02:01,756 --> 01:02:03,466
based on Sergeant Ko's suicide note.

770
01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:05,343
Some are criticizing the police

771
01:02:05,426 --> 01:02:07,971
for defending their own people.

772
01:02:08,263 --> 01:02:11,474
The bereaved family and civic
groupsbelieve Kang's voluntary resignation

773
01:02:11,558 --> 01:02:13,893
is proof of admission of guilt

774
01:02:13,977 --> 01:02:16,938
and have demandeda thorough investigation.

775
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:31,160
Do you still believethat
justice will prevail?

776
01:02:32,161 --> 01:02:33,663
I've failed.

777
01:02:34,330 --> 01:02:37,709
I should've been more evil than the worst.

778
01:02:38,209 --> 01:02:42,255
I should've known that being
the lesser evil wouldn't have worked.

779
01:02:43,464 --> 01:02:45,425
I should've just killed Kwon Jaekyu.

780
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:55,203
Gunshots were heard upstairs.

781
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:23,480
Die.

782
01:04:25,942 --> 01:04:27,068
Damn it.

783
01:04:38,204 --> 01:04:39,872
- Sir!
- Sir!

784
01:04:39,956 --> 01:04:41,416
- Search the room!
- Sir!

785
01:04:42,041 --> 01:04:43,459
- Here!
- Call the police!

786
01:04:44,043 --> 01:04:46,921
Call an ambulance!
The chairman is injured!

787
01:04:52,677 --> 01:04:53,677
Over here!

788
01:05:02,937 --> 01:05:04,105
It's all over now.

789
01:05:04,939 --> 01:05:06,107
Not yet.

790
01:05:06,190 --> 01:05:07,942
Can you dispatch your men right now?

791
01:05:08,609 --> 01:05:12,030
Prosecutor Song, I have no power now.
I need to pack up by the end of the night.

792
01:05:12,113 --> 01:05:14,574
Mr. Kang, I have no time
to console you right now.

793
01:05:14,657 --> 01:05:16,010
"By the end of the night," was it?

794
01:05:16,034 --> 01:05:17,827
That means you still have power for now.

795
01:05:19,287 --> 01:05:20,538
Do your job until the end.

796
01:05:24,917 --> 01:05:26,419
Woosin isn't picking up.

797
01:05:26,502 --> 01:05:28,087
We must find him.

798
01:05:31,591 --> 01:05:33,384
WOOSIN

799
01:05:34,385 --> 01:05:35,428
Help me.

800
01:05:47,690 --> 01:05:49,108
Mr. Lee.

801
01:05:50,985 --> 01:05:52,111
Mr. Lee.

802
01:05:53,488 --> 01:05:55,239
Wake up, Mr. Lee.

803
01:06:13,925 --> 01:06:15,343
Are you awake?

804
01:06:29,816 --> 01:06:31,150
Where are we?

805
01:06:31,984 --> 01:06:33,611
In some kind of a shipping container.

806
01:06:36,030 --> 01:06:39,951
They're going to kill us.

807
01:06:40,451 --> 01:06:42,411
This shipping container...

808
01:06:43,204 --> 01:06:45,456
They'll probably dispose of our bodies

809
01:06:46,582 --> 01:06:48,417
in the ocean.

810
01:06:49,252 --> 01:06:50,711
Leaving no trace behind.

811
01:06:51,504 --> 01:06:52,922
It's Team A's...

812
01:06:54,423 --> 01:06:56,092
classic move.

813
01:07:01,139 --> 01:07:03,057
That's why Lee Changwoo

814
01:07:04,058 --> 01:07:07,019
will have no choice but to talk.

815
01:07:07,687 --> 01:07:09,647
If not, his son will die before his eyes.

816
01:07:10,148 --> 01:07:11,357
What choice does he have?

817
01:07:14,819 --> 01:07:16,028
Uninterested?

818
01:07:16,612 --> 01:07:19,240
Then why are you still here?

819
01:07:40,303 --> 01:07:42,263
YOON JIN

820
01:07:42,346 --> 01:07:44,586
COME TO EUNKOOK MEDICAL CENTER
THE CHAIRMAN HAS BEEN SHOT

821
01:07:48,686 --> 01:07:49,686
Damn it.

822
01:08:08,414 --> 01:08:09,457
Father.

823
01:08:10,958 --> 01:08:12,001
Father.

824
01:08:15,379 --> 01:08:20,718
HAESONGWON

825
01:08:22,511 --> 01:08:24,972
Something terrible happened!
The chairman...

826
01:08:39,904 --> 01:08:41,113
Please...

827
01:08:43,616 --> 01:08:45,076
Please...

828
01:08:46,953 --> 01:08:48,371
Please...

829
01:08:53,334 --> 01:08:54,418
Die.

830
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:09,225
No one...

831
01:09:11,477 --> 01:09:13,104
is going to die tonight.

832
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:20,653
Suhyeon will come.

833
01:09:28,244 --> 01:09:29,704
It's a bioimplant GPS.

834
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:32,415
I already got one.

835
01:09:33,541 --> 01:09:35,710
- Me?
- What is the easiest way

836
01:09:35,793 --> 01:09:37,503
to make Mr. Lee talk?

837
01:09:40,339 --> 01:09:41,339
Us.

838
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:44,719
One of us will have to become a hostage.

839
01:09:47,596 --> 01:09:49,640
If things go awry,
at least they'll find our bodies.

840
01:10:06,449 --> 01:10:08,075
Let's text each other every hour.

841
01:10:08,868 --> 01:10:10,161
If we don't get a text, then...

842
01:10:26,052 --> 01:10:27,303
What have...

843
01:10:29,055 --> 01:10:30,389
you two done?

844
01:10:31,599 --> 01:10:32,975
Hang in there.

845
01:10:34,852 --> 01:10:36,020
We need someone

846
01:10:37,063 --> 01:10:39,023
who knows Team A the best.

847
01:10:39,815 --> 01:10:41,442
And that's you.

848
01:10:47,281 --> 01:10:49,158
You're not going back to prison.

849
01:11:13,391 --> 01:11:14,975
The new master wants to see us.

850
01:11:15,810 --> 01:11:17,853
Team A as your partner?

851
01:11:18,479 --> 01:11:20,815
Team A's partner is the owner of Haesong.

852
01:11:21,399 --> 01:11:22,775
So he managed to survive.

853
01:11:23,442 --> 01:11:26,445
To take Team A down, I got
kidnapped, wore an explosive vest,

854
01:11:26,529 --> 01:11:28,280
and had multiple brushes with death.

855
01:11:28,364 --> 01:11:29,824
After all that I went through,

856
01:11:30,866 --> 01:11:32,906
that man turned out to be
a former Team A agent too.

857
01:11:33,953 --> 01:11:35,121
Find the Adamas...

858
01:11:36,122 --> 01:11:37,873
while I take Team Leader Lee down.

859
01:11:37,957 --> 01:11:40,126
Where is the Adamas?
