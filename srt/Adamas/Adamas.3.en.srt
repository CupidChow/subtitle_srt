ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:51,555 --> 00:00:53,975
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:54,725 --> 00:00:57,065
(suspenseful music)

5
00:01:19,295 --> 00:01:20,915
WOOSIN: I'm going to steal the Adamas.

6
00:01:21,005 --> 00:01:23,215
To reveal that it was used for the murder,

7
00:01:23,295 --> 00:01:26,045
the autopsy result and Adamas
must be collated.

8
00:01:26,135 --> 00:01:29,015
Would Haesong cooperate? No, never.

9
00:01:30,175 --> 00:01:31,225
Are you out of your mind?

10
00:01:31,305 --> 00:01:32,635
You need to help me.

11
00:01:36,895 --> 00:01:37,725
He's insane.

12
00:01:37,815 --> 00:01:39,815
(tense music)

13
00:01:47,985 --> 00:01:49,325
HYESOO: It wasn't me.

14
00:01:50,075 --> 00:01:51,655
I didn't recommend you.

15
00:02:04,295 --> 00:02:05,135
(door opens)

16
00:02:10,305 --> 00:02:13,015
-Mr. Choi.
-Don't look too surprised.

17
00:02:13,135 --> 00:02:15,805
I just wanted to talk to you in private.

18
00:02:16,805 --> 00:02:18,105
Sure.

19
00:02:18,685 --> 00:02:20,525
I need you to leave this house.

20
00:02:21,105 --> 00:02:22,235
This is an ultimatum.

21
00:02:23,775 --> 00:02:26,235
I have no plans to do that,
let alone empty-handed.

22
00:02:26,315 --> 00:02:27,945
Continue being cheeky,
and you'll get hurt.

23
00:02:28,575 --> 00:02:30,325
Much more than you think.

24
00:02:30,405 --> 00:02:32,195
I'm hot-tempered, you see.

25
00:02:33,455 --> 00:02:35,115
You're so predictable.

26
00:02:35,615 --> 00:02:38,125
Judging by how you're threatening me,
you must be in a rush.

27
00:02:38,205 --> 00:02:39,705
I won't tolerate you anymore.

28
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:43,125
I could easily

29
00:02:44,835 --> 00:02:46,125
get rid of you…

30
00:02:46,215 --> 00:02:47,135
(thuds)

31
00:02:47,215 --> 00:02:49,215

36
00:02:57,555 --> 00:02:58,475
(grunts)

37
00:02:58,555 --> 00:02:59,475
What's going on?

38
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:01,145
(gasps)

39
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:03,935
(ominous music)

40
00:03:04,025 --> 00:03:05,485
-Ms. Kwon.
-(Woosin gasps for air)

41
00:03:08,195 --> 00:03:10,695
I can't breathe, Mr. Choi…

42
00:03:11,575 --> 00:03:12,485
(gasps)

43
00:03:13,075 --> 00:03:14,075
That…

44
00:03:15,285 --> 00:03:16,365
That…

45
00:03:17,325 --> 00:03:18,575
(Woosin grunts)

46
00:03:19,915 --> 00:03:21,245
That…

47
00:03:21,415 --> 00:03:22,915
Get it together! Exactly which one?

48
00:03:24,545 --> 00:03:26,545
(tense music)

49
00:03:37,845 --> 00:03:39,645
That's vitamin K, right?

50
00:03:40,605 --> 00:03:43,015
Vitamin K is an antidote for rat poison.

51
00:03:43,105 --> 00:03:45,065
You'd know if you've read my book.

52
00:03:45,145 --> 00:03:48,485
The character's lover was fed
rat-poisoned food every day.

53
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:51,195
And the character
ate some too to avoid suspicion,

54
00:03:51,275 --> 00:03:53,825
but also took some vitamin K, an antidote…

55
00:03:53,905 --> 00:03:55,155
(chuckles)

56
00:03:55,245 --> 00:03:56,615
…in order to live.

57
00:03:59,745 --> 00:04:00,995
Are you toying with me?

58
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:03,165
It was a test.

59
00:04:04,915 --> 00:04:07,255
You're not the only one
who can sound someone out.

60
00:04:07,335 --> 00:04:08,925
You little scumbag!

61
00:04:09,585 --> 00:04:11,635
Curse at me all you want,

62
00:04:11,795 --> 00:04:14,095
but you still won't intimidate me.

63
00:04:14,175 --> 00:04:16,425
Your decisions
are what show your true nature.

64
00:04:16,515 --> 00:04:19,305
Your true colors are revealed
depending on what decisions you make

65
00:04:19,385 --> 00:04:21,935
during certain situations.

66
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:28,855
You chose to save me which means

67
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:30,655
you can't kill me.

68
00:04:34,235 --> 00:04:35,485
(bottle rattles, thuds)

69
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:36,695
Cut this nonsense.

70
00:04:38,705 --> 00:04:40,535
I chose not to kill you because

71
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:45,335
I didn't see the need to go that far
just to kick you out of here.

72
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:48,715
I'm going to kick you
out of this house effortlessly.

73
00:04:48,795 --> 00:04:50,925
Will you grab me by the collar
and drag me out?

74
00:04:53,965 --> 00:04:55,635
(breathes heavily)

75
00:04:56,385 --> 00:04:57,465
No.

76
00:04:58,475 --> 00:05:00,055
I won't lay a hand on you.

77
00:05:01,555 --> 00:05:03,055
You're not my target.

78
00:05:06,565 --> 00:05:08,565
(tense music)

79
00:05:10,815 --> 00:05:12,355
I'm not your target?

80
00:05:14,775 --> 00:05:18,155
MR. CHOI:
Right. She should've arrived by now.

81
00:05:19,575 --> 00:05:23,875
You must know best
what your Achilles' heel is.

82
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:30,585
REPORTER:
Kim's wife, Im, got into a car accident

83
00:05:30,665 --> 00:05:34,175
and couldn't sustain her life
without any help.

84
00:05:34,965 --> 00:05:38,465
The police are assuming
that Kim was exhausted

85
00:05:38,635 --> 00:05:40,635
from nursing his wife that he ended up

86
00:05:40,805 --> 00:05:42,935
murdering her and taking his own life

87
00:05:43,015 --> 00:05:45,095
-by jumping from their apartment.
-He killed himself?

88
00:05:47,815 --> 00:05:49,815
(sighs)
Suhyeon.

89
00:05:51,775 --> 00:05:53,605
REPORTER:
The police find it highly probable…

90
00:05:53,695 --> 00:05:54,655
It can't be.

91
00:05:54,735 --> 00:05:57,235
…that these circumstances
were the cause of this incident.

92
00:05:57,865 --> 00:05:59,535
They're investigating the details

93
00:05:59,615 --> 00:06:02,655
by interviewing the bereaved
and witnesses.

94
00:06:03,615 --> 00:06:04,785
Who are you?

97
00:06:21,805 --> 00:06:23,055
Ms. Kim.

98
00:06:24,595 --> 00:06:25,555
Why are you…

99
00:06:26,265 --> 00:06:27,645
(sobs)

100
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:33,695
Ms. Kim.

(sobs)

102
00:06:38,235 --> 00:06:39,485
It's all my fault.

103
00:06:41,035 --> 00:06:43,905
Did something happen? What do you mean?

104
00:06:46,035 --> 00:06:47,245
I am…

105
00:06:49,035 --> 00:06:50,665
to blame.

106
00:06:50,745 --> 00:06:53,415
I took you to their house.

107
00:06:55,295 --> 00:06:57,175
What are you talking about?

108
00:07:00,135 --> 00:07:01,345
My parents…

109
00:07:03,805 --> 00:07:05,095
passed away.

110
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:09,435
REPORTER: I'm Reporter Seo Yeonjin,
reporting from the crime scene.

111
00:07:10,225 --> 00:07:12,355
The neighbors have testified
that the couple loved each other dearly

112
00:07:12,435 --> 00:07:15,145
and are heartbroken over this incident.

113
00:07:15,895 --> 00:07:17,945
After the police investigated
the crime scene…

114
00:07:18,025 --> 00:07:19,275
Are you saying…

115
00:07:22,785 --> 00:07:23,865
they were your parents?

116
00:07:25,495 --> 00:07:27,495

128
00:08:58,585 --> 00:09:00,835
He's still safe for now.
We're just tailing him.

129
00:09:02,635 --> 00:09:03,925
You're watching him?

130
00:09:04,005 --> 00:09:05,635
Don't be so relieved just yet.

131
00:09:06,425 --> 00:09:08,385
Keep in mind that we can always

132
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:09,885
kill him or let him live.

133
00:09:11,055 --> 00:09:12,435
Stay away from him this instant.

134
00:09:12,515 --> 00:09:14,305
Shouldn't you have expected this much

135
00:09:14,395 --> 00:09:16,725
when you blackmailed
the Special Investigations Headquarters?

136
00:09:17,475 --> 00:09:20,815
People around you will face harm
instead of you.

137
00:09:24,985 --> 00:09:26,485
Let me tell you something right now.

138
00:09:27,485 --> 00:09:29,035
You're making a mistake.

139
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:35,285
(door opens, closes)

140
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,705
You should've braced yourself

141
00:09:38,795 --> 00:09:40,545
if you threw the first punch.

142
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:46,255
Don't worry, Mom.
I'm eating well and doing great.

143
00:09:46,845 --> 00:09:48,715
How's Dad doing?

144

Your dad?

-Eating well?
-(chuckles)

147
00:09:56,305 --> 00:09:59,315
DONGRIM'S MOM:
Jeez, your dad misses you so much.

148
00:09:59,395 --> 00:10:02,355
Tell him I miss him too. Okay.

149
00:10:03,445 --> 00:10:05,525
I need to use the phone.
It's an emergency.

150
00:10:06,275 --> 00:10:08,195
-But still--
-Dongrim.

Please stop the car.

-You can go back home.

162

Calm down. This is dangerous.

170
00:11:59,345 --> 00:12:00,895
SUHYEON: You came to me for help.

171
00:12:03,185 --> 00:12:04,685
But now, you don't want my help?

172
00:12:04,775 --> 00:12:08,145
I told you.
I'll take care of this on my own.

173
00:12:11,365 --> 00:12:13,615
I shouldn't have come to you
in the first place.

174
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:17,615
Ms. Kim.

175
00:12:19,415 --> 00:12:21,415
You think it wasn't suicide, right?

176
00:12:25,455 --> 00:12:27,125
Isn't that why you came to see me?

177
00:12:32,045 --> 00:12:34,055
(somber music)

178
00:12:35,925 --> 00:12:38,805
I know that you're confused and scared.

179
00:12:38,885 --> 00:12:41,305
But let's remain levelheaded.

180
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:43,435
We need to understand what's going on.

181
00:12:45,855 --> 00:12:47,735
(sobs)

182
00:12:48,945 --> 00:12:49,945
(sighs)

183
00:12:51,445 --> 00:12:52,945
I don't know what came over me.

184
00:12:54,985 --> 00:12:57,235
I must've been out of my mind
for a minute.

185
00:13:04,245 --> 00:13:08,375
I just couldn't trust anyone
in this situation.

186
00:13:11,425 --> 00:13:12,505
SUHYEON: I understand.

187
00:13:14,005 --> 00:13:16,805
Let's dig into this together.

188
00:13:23,265 --> 00:13:24,855
I'm sorry about what happened.

189
00:13:27,565 --> 00:13:28,685
(sighs)

190
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:33,275
They didn't commit suicide.
They would never.

191
00:13:34,655 --> 00:13:35,735
I'm sure of it.

192
00:13:37,155 --> 00:13:39,155
(solemn music)

193
00:13:41,995 --> 00:13:42,825
(music stops)

194
00:13:42,915 --> 00:13:44,785
MR. CHOI:
Shouldn't you have expected this much

195
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:47,375
when you blackmailed
the Special Investigations Headquarters?

196
00:13:47,455 --> 00:13:50,545
People around you will face harm
instead of you.

197
00:13:57,095 --> 00:13:58,805
You've got beef with Mr. Choi, don't you?

198
00:14:00,675 --> 00:14:02,055
Did you guys fight?

199
00:14:03,055 --> 00:14:05,725
Right. I get it.

200
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:09,475
You have a knack for upsetting others.

201
00:14:09,565 --> 00:14:13,275
Looking like a psychopath,
your words are merciless.

202
00:14:13,855 --> 00:14:15,605
But you only state the facts.

203
00:14:16,525 --> 00:14:18,155
It really gets to us, you know?

204
00:14:18,235 --> 00:14:19,785
-Lee Dongrim.
-Yes?

205
00:14:20,825 --> 00:14:21,825
Leave this house.

206
00:14:21,905 --> 00:14:24,075
Oh, come on.

207
00:14:24,165 --> 00:14:25,285
I'm not joking around.

208
00:14:27,245 --> 00:14:29,625
To be honest,

209
00:14:30,955 --> 00:14:33,085
I need some extra cash.

210
00:14:33,965 --> 00:14:36,545
I know I should listen to you.

211
00:14:36,885 --> 00:14:39,175
But my dad will be getting
a liver transplant soon.

212
00:14:40,055 --> 00:14:41,555
I need more money for the surgery.

213
00:14:44,185 --> 00:14:45,185
I didn't know that.

214
00:14:45,265 --> 00:14:46,145
(chuckles)

215
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:50,855
Okay, I'll chip in.

216
00:14:51,525 --> 00:14:53,735
-What?
-I'll give you as much money as you need,

217
00:14:53,815 --> 00:14:55,105
so leave first thing tomorrow.

218
00:14:56,275 --> 00:14:57,655
But why would you…

219
00:15:01,945 --> 00:15:05,535
Well, if that's what you want, then okay.

220
00:15:12,795 --> 00:15:15,505
(door opens, closes)

221
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:24,175
WOOSIN: Lieutenant Choi.

222
00:15:32,475 --> 00:15:34,025
Oh, my mistake.

223
00:15:35,895 --> 00:15:37,065
I meant Mr. Choi.

224
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:41,195
-So you're putting up a fight.
-Are you afraid?

225
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:44,155
If you wish to keep my mouth shut,
leave Suhyeon alone.

226
00:15:44,245 --> 00:15:46,455
I have cards up my sleeve too, you know.

227
00:15:46,535 --> 00:15:48,245
Telling Chairman Kwon the truth?

228
00:15:48,325 --> 00:15:50,075
That I'm actually an undercover cop?

229
00:15:50,165 --> 00:15:52,995
Bring it on.
Let's see who goes down first.

230
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,455
You're wrong.

231
00:15:56,005 --> 00:15:58,215
I'm talking about
the Special Investigations Headquarters.

232
00:15:58,295 --> 00:15:59,255
What are you getting at?

233
00:15:59,335 --> 00:16:02,135
That's the reason why
you want me to leave.

234
00:16:02,965 --> 00:16:06,055
They want to question me
about how I found out about you.

235
00:16:06,135 --> 00:16:08,555
A slip of the tongue,
and I could put all of you in danger.

236
00:16:10,055 --> 00:16:11,435
You're digging your own grave.

237
00:16:12,515 --> 00:16:14,185
Are you begging to be killed tonight?

238
00:16:14,855 --> 00:16:16,275
I met an ally.

239
00:16:17,775 --> 00:16:18,985
Give me some time.

240
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:24,445
Are they willing to help you
steal the Adamas this instant?

241
00:16:24,615 --> 00:16:25,575
No.

242
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:29,615
I need their help with something else.

243
00:16:30,165 --> 00:16:32,165
(sly music)

244
00:16:47,555 --> 00:16:49,185
(sly music fades)

245
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:54,935
(knocking on door)

246
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:57,355
(door opens, closes)

247
00:17:02,735 --> 00:17:04,155
Ms. Kwon.

248
00:17:05,075 --> 00:17:06,695
I said leave me alone.

249
00:17:07,655 --> 00:17:10,075
Will you really not see him off today?

250
00:17:10,365 --> 00:17:13,375
But you've never missed a day.

251
00:17:13,955 --> 00:17:16,375
The chairman seems to be waiting for you.

252
00:17:17,045 --> 00:17:18,915
(tray clatters)

253
00:17:19,795 --> 00:17:24,545
He wanted you to have this, so drink up.

254
00:17:25,005 --> 00:17:28,175
He wanted you to have this

255
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:30,555
because he knew you had a weak knee.

256
00:17:30,635 --> 00:17:31,935
Here.

257
00:17:32,935 --> 00:17:33,935
(sighs)

258
00:17:43,275 --> 00:17:44,905
PREMIUM SUPPLEMENT FOR JOINT HEALTH

259
00:17:52,915 --> 00:17:56,585
(slurping)

260
00:18:03,085 --> 00:18:05,085
(mellow music)

261
00:18:12,305 --> 00:18:14,015
Gosh, this is pretty.

262
00:18:14,685 --> 00:18:15,805
You're prettier, Hyesoo.

263
00:18:24,735 --> 00:18:25,985
(knocking on door)

264
00:18:39,835 --> 00:18:40,835
(doorknob clicks)

265
00:18:41,755 --> 00:18:43,755
(sly music)

266
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:11,115
DONGRIM:
I bet there's no other assistant like me.

267
00:19:11,405 --> 00:19:13,365
-(keyboard clacking)
-I could've just left like you told me to,

268
00:19:13,575 --> 00:19:15,825
but I insisted on finishing my work first.

269
00:19:16,325 --> 00:19:18,125
I'm such a professional.

270
00:19:19,745 --> 00:19:23,705
Mr. Ha, I understand that memoirs
are supposed to be sugarcoated,

271
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:25,915
but he's gone too far
about his son's married life.

272
00:19:26,005 --> 00:19:27,585
Rumor has it that
it was a marriage of convenience,

273
00:19:27,675 --> 00:19:30,755
and she was supposed to wed someone else.
Why sugarcoat it into a love story?

274
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:33,215
(door slams)

275
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:35,305
(approaching footsteps)

276
00:19:38,185 --> 00:19:39,395
We need to talk.

277
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:42,145
Sure. Dongrim.

278
00:19:46,235 --> 00:19:48,655
Right. I'll be outside.

279
00:19:55,745 --> 00:19:56,745
(door closes)

280
00:19:58,705 --> 00:20:00,995
What is this? Is this a joke?

281
00:20:02,705 --> 00:20:04,755
Certainly not. It's blackmail.

282
00:20:04,835 --> 00:20:07,625
Like it says,
I have the letter that you sent.

283
00:20:07,715 --> 00:20:09,005
Do you remember that?

284
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,135
So what do you want from me?

285
00:20:11,215 --> 00:20:12,545
I had asked for your help.

286
00:20:12,635 --> 00:20:14,805
And I said no.

287
00:20:14,885 --> 00:20:16,845
I can't help you steal the Adamas.

288
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:19,185
I never asked you to do that.

289
00:20:20,895 --> 00:20:21,935
Is that so?

290
00:20:22,975 --> 00:20:25,145
Then how can I help you?

291
00:20:26,815 --> 00:20:29,025
There's a reason why
you wrote me that letter.

292
00:20:29,105 --> 00:20:30,695
Yes. I wanted you to reveal the truth.

293
00:20:30,775 --> 00:20:33,275
You had nothing to do
with the case from 22 years ago,

294
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:36,155
yet you wrote to me
without asking for anything in return.

295
00:20:36,245 --> 00:20:37,655
-That's unbelievable.
-I don't care.

296
00:20:37,745 --> 00:20:39,415
You know the real killer.

297
00:20:40,995 --> 00:20:42,995
(tense music)

298
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:47,205
Who is it?

299
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:54,385
This is my answer.

300
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:02,975
If you want to threaten me,
do it properly.

301
00:21:11,105 --> 00:21:13,775
(door opens, closes)

302
00:21:16,655 --> 00:21:18,325
(sighs)

303
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:25,375
AGENT KIM: Are you setting a snare?

304
00:21:26,455 --> 00:21:27,795
That's illegal.

305
00:21:28,545 --> 00:21:30,415
-Then report me.
-(chuckles)

306
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,635
You've been going
into the woods often lately.

307
00:21:35,215 --> 00:21:37,465
I think you're working overtime too.

308
00:21:38,175 --> 00:21:39,885
Then you should be
the new chief of security.

309
00:21:39,975 --> 00:21:41,885
Maybe I should.
(chuckles)

310
00:21:44,895 --> 00:21:45,935
Goodbye, sir.

311
00:21:51,355 --> 00:21:53,985
MR. CHOI: I knew it.
There's something you haven't told me.

312
00:21:55,155 --> 00:21:57,445
Well? I'm all ears.

313
00:21:58,235 --> 00:22:01,035
Twenty-two years ago,
a murder occurred in May.

314
00:22:01,535 --> 00:22:02,865
Nice opening.

315
00:22:03,205 --> 00:22:05,455
The culprit was caught
and given the death sentence.

316
00:22:05,665 --> 00:22:07,665
But the murder weapon disappeared.

317
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:10,505
It disappeared?

318
00:22:10,585 --> 00:22:12,165
I believe it was the Adamas.

319
00:22:13,215 --> 00:22:14,715
WOOSIN: That's why I want to steal it.

320
00:22:15,425 --> 00:22:17,845
I'll know for sure once it's collated
with the autopsy results.

321
00:22:19,675 --> 00:22:21,055
But why would you do that?

322
00:22:24,015 --> 00:22:25,515
My father was the victim.

323
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:28,225
I see.

324
00:22:28,725 --> 00:22:31,145
I get that, but I still have a question.

325
00:22:32,895 --> 00:22:35,275
Why go through this trouble
if the killer was caught?

326
00:22:35,445 --> 00:22:36,815
The real killer is someone else.

327
00:22:37,275 --> 00:22:39,405
Who do you think took the murder weapon?

328
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,325
This is intriguing.

329
00:22:44,825 --> 00:22:48,375
The one who has the Adamas
is the real killer or knows who it is.

330
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:53,215
Your ally must have the answer.

331
00:22:55,465 --> 00:22:57,545
The answer is obvious.

332
00:23:00,425 --> 00:23:01,425
Hold on.

333
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:04,685
May, 22 years ago?

334
00:23:14,355 --> 00:23:15,235
Have a seat.

335
00:23:16,355 --> 00:23:18,115
I prefer to stand.

336
00:23:18,775 --> 00:23:20,195
Should I keep standing too?

337
00:23:22,155 --> 00:23:23,155
(clears throat)

338
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:36,875
It doesn't look infected.

339
00:23:37,795 --> 00:23:39,335
It must've hurt a lot.

340
00:23:40,095 --> 00:23:41,255
That's okay.

341
00:23:41,595 --> 00:23:44,635
My body will be useless once I die.
What's the point of cherishing it?

342
00:23:45,805 --> 00:23:48,595
I admit that I was
too worked up yesterday.

343
00:23:49,225 --> 00:23:50,685
You were right.

344
00:23:51,435 --> 00:23:54,525
There's something about the way he smiles.

345
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:57,605
He reminds me of Minjo.

346
00:23:59,155 --> 00:24:03,235
Minjo took after his mom
and had a bright smile.

347
00:24:04,325 --> 00:24:06,195
It was soft too.

348
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:11,705
Mr. Ha exudes a similar aura.

349
00:24:12,955 --> 00:24:15,415
That must've pulled at my heartstrings.

350
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:19,925
See? I know you, sir.

351
00:24:21,135 --> 00:24:25,015
And yet, you were only upset with me
and even hurt me.

352
00:24:25,095 --> 00:24:27,015
Please understand me.

353
00:24:27,095 --> 00:24:29,515
You've lost a child too.

354
00:24:30,095 --> 00:24:33,105
We've experienced the same loss,
so can't you empathize with me?

355
00:24:35,935 --> 00:24:39,565
Of course I am grateful to have you.

356
00:24:40,695 --> 00:24:43,405
I know you wouldn't hesitate
to sacrifice yourself

357
00:24:43,485 --> 00:24:45,825
to save me through thick and thin.

358
00:24:46,905 --> 00:24:49,075
KWON: You're like my heart.

359
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:52,375
After all,

360
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:54,875
I owe you my life.

361
00:24:55,295 --> 00:24:57,455
(sobbing)

362
00:24:59,005 --> 00:25:00,085
(knocking on door)

363
00:25:01,085 --> 00:25:02,465
Come in.

364
00:25:04,385 --> 00:25:05,305
(Ms. Kwon sniffles)

365
00:25:10,265 --> 00:25:11,595
Should I come back later?

366
00:25:11,685 --> 00:25:16,475
It's okay. There's nothing you can't say
in front of Ms. Kwon.

367
00:25:17,475 --> 00:25:18,645
Master.

368
00:25:25,485 --> 00:25:26,985
What is it?

369
00:25:30,995 --> 00:25:32,705
I have something to tell you, sir.

370
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:40,375
(elevator dings)

371
00:25:47,465 --> 00:25:49,465
(suspenseful music)

372
00:26:03,485 --> 00:26:05,615
BANKBOOK

373
00:26:06,115 --> 00:26:07,655
CASE SUMMARY

374
00:26:14,995 --> 00:26:16,785
There's no trace of resistance.

375
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,625
And I doubt the police made the bed.

376
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:22,125
(suspenseful music)

377
00:26:38,015 --> 00:26:38,975
-Sleeping pills.
-(gasps)

378
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:41,225
Jeez, did I startle you?

379
00:26:41,315 --> 00:26:43,445
Mr. Gong, please.

380
00:26:43,525 --> 00:26:47,865
Our colleagues do call me the assassin.

381
00:26:47,945 --> 00:26:50,445
-Assassin, my foot.
-I'm just joking.

382
00:26:51,695 --> 00:26:52,865
What did the police say?

383
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:56,285
She was given sleeping pills
and was smothered with a pillow.

384
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:57,575
How humane, right?

385
00:26:57,705 --> 00:26:59,705
That's why they think the husband did it.

386
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:01,835
Look at how he got his accounts in order.

387
00:27:01,915 --> 00:27:05,045
This is what people
who are about to commit suicide do.

388
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:08,175
My expertise of ten years tells me
that this is certainly a suicide case.

389
00:27:08,675 --> 00:27:11,515
He didn't even scream
while he was falling.

390
00:27:12,095 --> 00:27:15,135
Sir, why are you
digging into this case so much?

391
00:27:16,345 --> 00:27:18,515
-Was he unconscious?
-Sorry?

392
00:27:18,605 --> 00:27:21,265
Hitting the ground head first
must've covered up any head injuries.

393
00:27:21,855 --> 00:27:23,855
The police have concluded it as suicide.

394
00:27:24,025 --> 00:27:26,855
Mr. Gong, I will never commit suicide.

395
00:27:27,155 --> 00:27:30,615
If the police claim that I killed myself,
you'd better look into it.

396
00:27:30,695 --> 00:27:32,735
Don't let me get cremated.
Just bury my body.

397
00:27:32,825 --> 00:27:34,035
An autopsy may be needed.

398
00:27:34,115 --> 00:27:35,495
I prefer that too.

399
00:27:35,575 --> 00:27:37,365
I'm too scared to get cremated.

400
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:39,375
Right. Did you get what I asked for?

401
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:42,375
Right. One second, sir.

402
00:27:43,955 --> 00:27:46,715
Apparently, this brand is the best.

403
00:27:53,265 --> 00:27:54,515
ARES
WARNING EXTREME DANGER

404
00:27:54,595 --> 00:27:56,555
-TEAM LEADER LEE: He's a prosecutor?
-CHIEF JEONG: Yes, sir.

405
00:27:56,635 --> 00:27:58,135
PERSONAL INFORMATION
SONG SUHYEON

406
00:27:59,555 --> 00:28:01,225
He's the prosecution's nuisance.

407
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:03,435
He doesn't hesitate
to disobey his superiors if need be.

408
00:28:03,525 --> 00:28:05,485
They can't touch him.

409
00:28:05,565 --> 00:28:06,695
What a distinct character.

410
00:28:07,275 --> 00:28:10,115
Seeing that he hasn't gotten sacked,
he must be the ace.

411
00:28:10,195 --> 00:28:11,945
The prosecutors' office
is chaotic these days.

412
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:14,695
Those for and against the president
are at each other's throats.

413
00:28:15,575 --> 00:28:17,495
If we provoke him…

414
00:28:17,575 --> 00:28:19,825
The likes of him don't sit still if we do.

415
00:28:20,785 --> 00:28:22,785
And we happened to provoke him.

416
00:28:23,295 --> 00:28:26,255
Gosh. This is going to be a nuisance.

417
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:27,835
Do you think he'll be suspicious?

418
00:28:29,335 --> 00:28:30,965
Kim Wonjoong and his wife

419
00:28:31,045 --> 00:28:33,385
committed suicide
the very day he visited them.

420
00:28:34,215 --> 00:28:37,635
If he's a competent prosecutor,
I'm sure he feels something is off.

421
00:28:38,975 --> 00:28:41,015
Then I'll come up with a scenario.

422
00:28:45,475 --> 00:28:47,185
-Mr. Lee!
-MANAGER LEE: Yes?

423
00:28:49,985 --> 00:28:51,905
-TEAM LEADER LEE: Mr. Jeong.
-Yes, sir.

424
00:28:52,905 --> 00:28:55,235
I may lose my position to you
in the near future.

425
00:28:57,865 --> 00:28:59,155
You can be the new team leader.

426
00:28:59,785 --> 00:29:01,245
I'm sorry, sir.

427
00:29:02,455 --> 00:29:03,785
Forget the scenario.

428
00:29:04,415 --> 00:29:07,955
It'll obviously look fishy
if Song Suhyeon dies as well.

429
00:29:09,005 --> 00:29:09,965
Yes, sir.

430
00:29:11,795 --> 00:29:14,045
-Did you call for me, sir?
-TEAM LEADER LEE: Yes.

431
00:29:14,675 --> 00:29:16,845
Keep an eye on Song Suhyeon.

432
00:29:17,515 --> 00:29:18,345
Sorry?

433
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:20,765
He seems to be a hotshot.

434
00:29:21,225 --> 00:29:24,055
So we should play on his level,
don't you think?

435
00:29:26,475 --> 00:29:29,275
Mr. Lee, can I entrust you with this task?

436
00:29:30,985 --> 00:29:34,405
Of course, sir.
I'm actually a natural at field work.

437
00:29:41,325 --> 00:29:43,075
Sir, do you really think he'll be okay?

438
00:29:43,705 --> 00:29:46,665
-I don't think he's ready to--
-(book slams)

439
00:29:49,085 --> 00:29:50,625
You're really pressing my buttons today.

440
00:29:51,755 --> 00:29:52,795
I'm sorry, sir.

441
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:55,095
He's just keeping an eye on him.

442
00:29:56,255 --> 00:29:57,135
Yes, sir.

443
00:30:03,015 --> 00:30:04,345
Mr. Seo.

444
00:30:05,105 --> 00:30:07,435
This isn't right. He's not ready for this.

445
00:30:07,515 --> 00:30:08,775
It's our team leader's command.

446
00:30:12,525 --> 00:30:14,775
Still, he can't favor him
just because they're brothers--

447
00:30:17,985 --> 00:30:19,195
Say that again.

448
00:30:20,115 --> 00:30:21,035
I'm sorry, sir.

449
00:30:22,035 --> 00:30:24,365
What about the daughter?
Did you follow up with her yet?

450
00:30:25,705 --> 00:30:27,165
What is it?

451
00:30:27,915 --> 00:30:30,005
I already gave my testimony yesterday.

452
00:30:30,085 --> 00:30:31,295
You see…

453
00:30:32,295 --> 00:30:34,715
It does look like
your father committed suicide

454
00:30:34,795 --> 00:30:37,215
after murdering your mother.

455
00:30:37,385 --> 00:30:41,095
But personally speaking,
I feel like his motive was too weak.

456
00:30:42,175 --> 00:30:45,015
I heard your parents
loved each other dearly.

457
00:30:46,145 --> 00:30:48,895
Yes. They did.

458
00:30:48,975 --> 00:30:51,395
But he did struggle a lot.

459
00:30:52,485 --> 00:30:54,645
He had been taking care of her
for the past 22 years.

460
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:58,115
So I understand the decision he made.

461
00:30:59,865 --> 00:31:00,785
Ah.

462
00:31:02,245 --> 00:31:03,365
I see.

463
00:31:04,455 --> 00:31:06,455
(indistinct chatter)

464
00:31:11,045 --> 00:31:13,915
MAN: He doesn't deserve to be buried
with our ancestors after what he did.

465
00:31:14,255 --> 00:31:15,255
It'll only bring bad luck.

466
00:31:15,335 --> 00:31:18,045
WOMAN: Be quiet. Seohee can hear you.

467
00:31:19,215 --> 00:31:21,055
MAN: Let's end this funeral service today.

468
00:31:21,255 --> 00:31:23,675
WOMAN: Goodness, can you please stop?

469
00:31:23,765 --> 00:31:25,555
(solemn music)

470
00:31:25,635 --> 00:31:26,685
SUHYEON: Are you okay?

471
00:31:35,025 --> 00:31:36,445
I told you not to come.

472
00:31:41,485 --> 00:31:44,695
I thought it was only right
to offer my condolences.

473
00:31:50,415 --> 00:31:52,125
WOOSIN: You know the real killer.

474
00:31:52,705 --> 00:31:53,705
Who is it?

475
00:31:56,125 --> 00:31:58,125
(paper rustles)

476
00:32:02,135 --> 00:32:03,635
(paper rustles)

477
00:32:10,145 --> 00:32:10,975
(thuds)

478
00:32:11,765 --> 00:32:12,975
(sighs)

479
00:32:14,475 --> 00:32:15,815
She's going to regret this.

480
00:32:19,235 --> 00:32:20,235
What is that?

481
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:21,615
The chairman's interview notes.

482
00:32:21,695 --> 00:32:24,445
I've organized them. You just need
to show him and get his confirmation.

483
00:32:25,405 --> 00:32:26,655
Thanks.

484
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:30,035
I'll get going then.
I'm going to leave after a shower.

485
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:31,915
Okay.

486
00:32:35,795 --> 00:32:38,085
It's so hard to leave you behind.
(clicks tongue)

487
00:32:40,885 --> 00:32:42,925
I should find you a good woman to marry.

488
00:32:45,345 --> 00:32:47,175
You'll end up like Ms. Kwon.

489
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:48,305
Just leave.

490
00:32:48,385 --> 00:32:51,345
Having no kids or a husband
has turned her into a cranky lady.

491
00:32:51,435 --> 00:32:52,895
Do you think she's ever dated anyone?

492
00:32:52,975 --> 00:32:53,935
-Maybe a divorcée?
-Go.

493
00:32:54,065 --> 00:32:55,645
-Judging by her awful temper--
-Jeez.

494
00:32:55,725 --> 00:32:56,775
DONGRIM: Oh, my goodness!

495
00:32:58,105 --> 00:33:00,695
Why are you so surprised to see me?

496
00:33:01,155 --> 00:33:02,655
Because you barged in here.

497
00:33:02,735 --> 00:33:03,985
I understand.

498
00:33:04,075 --> 00:33:06,485
I just caught you bad-mouthing me.

499
00:33:07,115 --> 00:33:08,445
Did you hear that?

500
00:33:12,205 --> 00:33:14,875
By the way, have you ever dated before?

501
00:33:14,955 --> 00:33:17,335
-What kind of nonsense is that?
-I guess she has. Bye.

502
00:33:24,965 --> 00:33:25,965
What brings you here?

503
00:33:26,055 --> 00:33:28,635
(clears throat)
It's nothing much.

504
00:33:29,265 --> 00:33:31,555
I've been too harsh on you.

505
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:32,975
Are you apologizing to me?

506
00:33:33,185 --> 00:33:34,015
You wish.

507
00:33:34,105 --> 00:33:36,765
Our beef has only troubled the master.

508
00:33:36,855 --> 00:33:39,185
Let's just put an end to this.
You'll be leaving soon anyway.

509
00:33:39,775 --> 00:33:42,315
Sure. I hope we get along
during my remaining time here.

510
00:33:43,775 --> 00:33:45,025
Your remaining time here?

511
00:33:45,945 --> 00:33:47,695
All right. Sure.

512
00:33:48,905 --> 00:33:50,155
Right.

513
00:33:51,115 --> 00:33:53,365
Shouldn't you say your goodbyes?

514
00:33:54,035 --> 00:33:56,705
-Goodbyes?
-You haven't heard yet?

515
00:33:57,125 --> 00:33:59,045
The chairman will be leaving.

516
00:33:59,125 --> 00:34:02,925
I don't know what's gotten into Ms. Hyesoo
but they'll be going on a trip together.

517
00:34:03,795 --> 00:34:07,095
(chuckles)

518
00:34:07,175 --> 00:34:08,965
(Ms. Kwon humming)

519
00:34:14,305 --> 00:34:16,305
(tense music)

520
00:34:30,495 --> 00:34:31,695
Hey.

521
00:34:33,325 --> 00:34:34,245
We need to talk.

522
00:34:34,325 --> 00:34:35,705
Not now. Later.

523
00:34:35,785 --> 00:34:37,205
Right now.

524
00:34:47,045 --> 00:34:49,845
Why did you bring me here?
I'm a bit busy right now.

525
00:34:50,675 --> 00:34:52,925
This helicopter
is a peculiarity of Haesong.

526
00:34:53,515 --> 00:34:57,185
It is the only group that is affiliated
with the country's biggest arms dealer.

527
00:34:57,265 --> 00:34:58,435
Were you aware of that?

528
00:34:58,515 --> 00:35:00,565
If you're talking about ARES,
I roughly know about it.

529
00:35:00,645 --> 00:35:02,855
(scoffs)
You're right.

530
00:35:03,525 --> 00:35:05,065
MR. CHOI: They manufacture everything

531
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:07,485
from self-defense gadgets
to military arms.

532
00:35:07,565 --> 00:35:10,695
Thanks to that, this mansion
has a cutting-edge security system.

533
00:35:11,535 --> 00:35:14,745
All the employees have registered
their physical characteristics.

534
00:35:15,325 --> 00:35:16,415
Yes, I did as well.

535
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:20,165
MR. CHOI: It's more than just
security measures. They can identify you.

536
00:35:20,245 --> 00:35:23,335
We all have our own serial numbers.

537
00:35:24,715 --> 00:35:25,585
They're watching us.

538
00:35:26,175 --> 00:35:27,255
Our every single move.

539
00:35:28,755 --> 00:35:30,045
MR. CHOI: From up there.

540
00:35:30,675 --> 00:35:31,715
Do you get it?

541
00:35:32,885 --> 00:35:34,885
(upbeat music)

542
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:41,605
(tense music)

543
00:35:46,025 --> 00:35:47,735
MR. CHOI: Biometrics AI.

544
00:35:48,945 --> 00:35:49,985
The eye in the sky.

545
00:35:51,825 --> 00:35:53,195
They can see our every move.

546
00:35:53,865 --> 00:35:55,325
And I'm no exception.

547
00:36:05,045 --> 00:36:06,835
I'm so full.

548
00:36:16,635 --> 00:36:17,935
AGENT PARK: That's Mr. Choi.

549
00:36:18,015 --> 00:36:19,185
Who's that next to him?

550
00:36:20,395 --> 00:36:22,515
Let me see their serial number.

551
00:36:25,735 --> 00:36:26,985
It's Mr. Ha.

552
00:36:32,275 --> 00:36:33,235
(inhales sharply)

553
00:36:33,325 --> 00:36:36,575
Does this mean you want to
hop into the same boat with me?

554
00:36:37,155 --> 00:36:39,955
You must be overly eager, seeing how
you're getting ahead of yourself.

555
00:36:40,035 --> 00:36:40,955
Then why tell me this?

556
00:36:42,245 --> 00:36:45,415
You think Chairman Kwon is responsible
for your father's murder, don't you?

557
00:36:46,415 --> 00:36:47,505
What's your take?

558
00:36:48,085 --> 00:36:49,045
He's a key suspect.

559
00:36:49,425 --> 00:36:52,635
If the Adamas was the murder weapon,
then its owner must be the suspect.

560
00:36:53,295 --> 00:36:55,345
We have the same target.
Chairman Kwon Jaekyu.

561
00:36:56,515 --> 00:36:57,925
Don't be foolish.

562
00:36:58,595 --> 00:36:59,885
Your father's death took place

563
00:36:59,975 --> 00:37:01,845
before August of 2000,

564
00:37:01,935 --> 00:37:03,515
before the statute of limitations
for murder was abolished.

565
00:37:03,605 --> 00:37:07,025
Simply put, the statute of limitations
for his case has run out.

566
00:37:07,105 --> 00:37:09,315
Chairman Kwon could confess to it

567
00:37:09,395 --> 00:37:10,735
and still not get punished.

568
00:37:10,815 --> 00:37:12,615
Yet you came here.

569
00:37:14,655 --> 00:37:16,195
What are you scheming?

570
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:20,705
It hasn't run out yet.

571
00:37:21,665 --> 00:37:24,165
-What?
-The chairman was overseas for some time.

572
00:37:24,745 --> 00:37:26,085
There are still 18 days left.

573
00:37:27,085 --> 00:37:28,795
Do you want to know something else?

574
00:37:28,875 --> 00:37:31,505
My father's case from 22 years ago
was the only murder

575
00:37:32,085 --> 00:37:34,925
that Lee Changwoo had ever committed.

576
00:37:36,425 --> 00:37:37,765
Lee Changwoo.

577
00:37:37,845 --> 00:37:40,135
Lee Changwoo and Chairman Kwon.

578
00:37:41,015 --> 00:37:42,395
It's a fascinating combination.

579
00:37:42,515 --> 00:37:45,305
The key to this case
is their point of contact.

580
00:37:46,685 --> 00:37:49,645
I think we can help each other out.

581
00:37:51,025 --> 00:37:52,855
You want me to help you steal the Adamas

582
00:37:53,485 --> 00:37:55,235
so you can compare it
to the autopsy report?

583
00:37:55,315 --> 00:37:58,655
If the murder weapon is a match,
I can request a retrial.

584
00:37:58,735 --> 00:37:59,785
What if it doesn't?

585
00:38:00,365 --> 00:38:01,615
-Then--
-Then…

586
00:38:04,285 --> 00:38:05,745
our team's project will fall through.

587
00:38:05,835 --> 00:38:08,875
We're up against a much more
powerful force than you think.

588
00:38:08,955 --> 00:38:10,715
I can't help you
merely based on a suspicion.

589
00:38:12,965 --> 00:38:15,925
(scoffs)
What exactly is this project?

590
00:38:16,005 --> 00:38:18,715
You've been here for two years now
but still haven't completed it.

591
00:38:19,305 --> 00:38:21,475
-Isn't it right to give up?
-Shut it.

592
00:38:21,555 --> 00:38:23,845
Bring me proof
that it's linked to Chairman Kwon.

593
00:38:23,935 --> 00:38:25,225
If not, just leave

594
00:38:25,305 --> 00:38:28,355
before I end your brother's life.

595
00:38:35,485 --> 00:38:36,985
SUHYEON: This is a taser.

596
00:38:37,485 --> 00:38:38,905
Keep it with you just in case.

597
00:38:39,405 --> 00:38:40,995
The precautions are written on the back.

598
00:38:41,075 --> 00:38:42,455
Prosecutor Song.

599
00:38:45,535 --> 00:38:46,785
Why are you doing this?

600
00:38:52,755 --> 00:38:53,875
I understand.

601
00:38:55,045 --> 00:38:57,675
I must look like a lunatic. But you see…

602
00:39:02,385 --> 00:39:03,725
Your parents met untimely deaths

603
00:39:04,635 --> 00:39:06,515
after I visited them.

604
00:39:07,605 --> 00:39:10,105
You know very well
that they wouldn't have committed suicide.

605
00:39:11,185 --> 00:39:12,485
Then who could it have been?

606
00:39:13,815 --> 00:39:15,235
Who could've killed them?

607
00:39:20,405 --> 00:39:22,195
My father's killer…

608
00:39:26,745 --> 00:39:28,875
murdered your parents too.

609
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:31,705
That's my conclusion.

610
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:36,125
It sounds too far-fetched.

611
00:39:36,215 --> 00:39:38,585
The murderer watched my parents
for the past 22 years

612
00:39:39,005 --> 00:39:41,385
and only killed them
because you visited them?

613
00:39:42,465 --> 00:39:43,595
That's right.

614
00:39:47,015 --> 00:39:49,355
-And you know that.
-I do.

615
00:39:50,605 --> 00:39:52,105
That's why I'm acting like this.

616
00:39:56,855 --> 00:39:58,315
I'm afraid you'll die as well.

617
00:40:03,905 --> 00:40:06,745
-Ms. Kim.
-A detective visited me again today.

618
00:40:07,865 --> 00:40:10,205
I told him
that my parents committed suicide

619
00:40:11,585 --> 00:40:14,045
in case their killer was watching me.

620
00:40:16,125 --> 00:40:19,215
Well done.
It's better to be safe than sorry.

621
00:40:19,295 --> 00:40:21,755
So you should stop here as well.

622
00:40:23,425 --> 00:40:25,175
Or you could be in serious peril.

623
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:29,095
I'm sorry for barging into your house.

624
00:40:29,725 --> 00:40:32,855
But I'll take care of this
from now on. Goodbye.

625
00:40:33,435 --> 00:40:34,645
Ms. Kim Seohee.

626
00:40:40,655 --> 00:40:43,155
You decided to dig into my father's case
from 22 years ago

627
00:40:43,235 --> 00:40:45,995
because you knew
that your father gave false testimony.

628
00:40:46,785 --> 00:40:49,285
You didn't turn a blind eye to it,
and I won't either.

629
00:40:52,285 --> 00:40:53,665
It's my turn now.

630
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:57,375
I will catch them no matter what.

631
00:40:59,795 --> 00:41:01,965
So let's do this together.

632
00:41:10,805 --> 00:41:12,185
I saw him.

633
00:41:13,305 --> 00:41:14,605
You saw him? Who?

634
00:41:14,685 --> 00:41:15,895
The man.

635
00:41:16,855 --> 00:41:18,735
The man who killed your father.

636
00:41:25,195 --> 00:41:26,695
SEOHEE: Your father...

637
00:41:27,905 --> 00:41:29,455
went into that house alone.

638
00:41:42,885 --> 00:41:44,295
I definitely saw him.

639
00:41:46,215 --> 00:41:48,385
YOUNG SEOHEE: Aren't you bored too?

640
00:41:50,805 --> 00:41:52,345
When is Mom coming?

641
00:41:54,935 --> 00:41:58,065
Don't you wish she'd get here quickly?

642
00:41:58,855 --> 00:42:00,315
SEOHEE: I was in the car as well.

643
00:42:00,395 --> 00:42:01,605
Should we go see her?

644
00:42:15,955 --> 00:42:17,955
(suspenseful music)

645
00:42:34,555 --> 00:42:38,265
-Dad.
-Yes? What is it?

646
00:42:42,275 --> 00:42:43,525
What is it, Seohee?

647
00:42:44,905 --> 00:42:46,065
I'm the witness.

648
00:42:55,535 --> 00:42:57,495
Song Suhyeon is speaking with Kim Seohee.

649
00:42:58,785 --> 00:42:59,745
Hey.

650
00:43:00,415 --> 00:43:03,665
Seeing how he came all the way here,
I doubt he'll back away that easily.

651
00:43:03,755 --> 00:43:06,005
He's desperate to get killed.

652
00:43:06,465 --> 00:43:08,925
(scoffs)
All right. Keep an eye on him for now.

653
00:43:09,675 --> 00:43:10,635
Bye.

654
00:43:13,975 --> 00:43:16,895
The victim's son has met
with the witness' daughter.

655
00:43:17,935 --> 00:43:19,435
I wonder how this will end.

656
00:43:21,975 --> 00:43:23,145
What did Seohee say?

657
00:43:23,525 --> 00:43:25,485
She seemed to believe that it was suicide.

658
00:43:25,565 --> 00:43:27,655
I don't think
there's anything to worry about.

659
00:43:27,735 --> 00:43:28,865
Okay.

660
00:43:29,365 --> 00:43:32,195
Then we just need to take care
of the prosecutor.

661
00:43:32,535 --> 00:43:34,115
-Yes, sir.
-(chuckles)

662
00:43:34,205 --> 00:43:35,535
-Good work.
-Thank you, sir.

663
00:43:36,745 --> 00:43:37,875
Mr. Ha.

664
00:43:41,665 --> 00:43:44,295
He's not here. I was going to say goodbye.

665
00:43:53,885 --> 00:43:57,515
He must've forgotten
to check with the chairman.

666
00:43:57,595 --> 00:43:59,355
Who will help him once I'm gone?

667
00:44:07,315 --> 00:44:08,855
How is it going?

668
00:44:11,445 --> 00:44:12,535
(mouths)

669
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:22,545
(soft pop)

670
00:44:25,875 --> 00:44:27,005
Hello, sir.

671
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:30,505
Aren't you Mr. Ha's pupil?

672
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:32,005
Yes, sir.

673
00:44:33,555 --> 00:44:36,095
What were you doing in my office?

674
00:44:36,175 --> 00:44:38,845
Come and go as you wish,
and you'll be in a pickle.

675
00:44:40,765 --> 00:44:43,435
The interview notes. I've organized them
and put them on your desk.

676
00:44:43,685 --> 00:44:45,315
We need your confirmation.

677
00:44:47,145 --> 00:44:49,275
He must've been uninformed.

678
00:44:50,865 --> 00:44:52,405
Sorry? What do you mean?

679
00:44:59,155 --> 00:45:01,455
What exactly did your husband say again?

680
00:45:07,335 --> 00:45:09,215
Have you gone crazy? Lower your voice.

681
00:45:09,295 --> 00:45:12,215
"Lee Changwoo isn't the real killer,
and the murder weapon was the Adamas."

682
00:45:12,295 --> 00:45:13,135
Is that what he said?

683
00:45:13,715 --> 00:45:14,635
All that I know was in that letter.

684
00:45:14,715 --> 00:45:17,095
So that's all he said?
Nothing about the killer?

685
00:45:17,175 --> 00:45:18,675
-That's right.
-You're lying.

686
00:45:19,845 --> 00:45:21,305
You know who the killer is.

687
00:45:21,395 --> 00:45:23,015
Isn't it obvious?

688
00:45:23,105 --> 00:45:24,645
-I don't know.
-Chairman Kwon.

689
00:45:26,815 --> 00:45:28,025
It's him.

690
00:45:31,065 --> 00:45:32,355
The owner of the Adamas.

691
00:45:34,695 --> 00:45:36,695
I thought he was the real killer.

692
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:40,155
That's your reason?

693
00:45:40,245 --> 00:45:41,785
If not, just say that I'm wrong.

694
00:45:41,865 --> 00:45:44,335
Then I'll omit him
from my list of suspects.

695
00:45:44,415 --> 00:45:46,335
-I don't know anything.
-You don't?

696
00:45:46,415 --> 00:45:49,625
You're avoiding answering
a simple yes-or-no question,

697
00:45:49,715 --> 00:45:51,295
meaning you're deliberately
hiding something.

698
00:45:51,375 --> 00:45:53,335
And that means that
you expected me to ask you this

699
00:45:53,425 --> 00:45:55,385
and that you understand the question.

700
00:45:58,845 --> 00:46:00,595
You know the truth.

701
00:46:09,225 --> 00:46:10,565
Ms. Eun.

702
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:13,775
The way you address someone
shows how close you are to them.

703
00:46:14,775 --> 00:46:17,525
You've never addressed
the chairman as Father.

704
00:46:17,615 --> 00:46:21,075
You always address him as the chairman,
and I sense animosity toward him.

705
00:46:22,115 --> 00:46:23,745
You want him to get caught, don't you?

706
00:46:28,545 --> 00:46:30,965
I don't know for sure
if he was the killer or not.

707
00:46:32,675 --> 00:46:34,545
HYESOO: But this is what my husband said.

708
00:46:36,095 --> 00:46:39,005
"My father killed someone with the Adamas.
And Lee Changwoo…

709
00:46:39,925 --> 00:46:41,345
was the one who took the fall."

710
00:46:44,475 --> 00:46:45,805
I knew it.

711
00:46:46,145 --> 00:46:47,685
That's all I know.

712
00:46:47,765 --> 00:46:50,935
The rest is up to you to find out,
so leave me out of this.

713
00:46:51,565 --> 00:46:52,855
I'm afraid I can't do that.

714
00:46:54,355 --> 00:46:55,445
What do you mean?

715
00:46:55,525 --> 00:46:57,405
I happen to need your help with something.

716
00:46:57,485 --> 00:46:59,655
-I refuse.
-Find out who recommended me.

717
00:46:59,735 --> 00:47:01,655
It'll be easier for you to find out.

718
00:47:02,075 --> 00:47:04,285
I need to know who it is to brace myself.

719
00:47:04,365 --> 00:47:06,825
I need to know
why I was called here. Right?

720
00:47:06,915 --> 00:47:08,085
I said no.

721
00:47:08,835 --> 00:47:10,955
(suspenseful music)

722
00:47:14,125 --> 00:47:15,375
I recorded everything

723
00:47:16,135 --> 00:47:18,425
that you just said.

724
00:47:23,385 --> 00:47:25,135
I wonder what the chairman
will think of this.

725
00:47:26,685 --> 00:47:27,895
Start unpacking.

726
00:47:31,645 --> 00:47:33,235
Do you think you can stop him?

727
00:47:39,025 --> 00:47:40,365
Go to his office.

728
00:47:41,285 --> 00:47:42,945
That's where the bomb will go off.

729
00:47:44,955 --> 00:47:46,165
KWON: Yes, Hyunjo.

730
00:47:47,665 --> 00:47:50,205
Ms. Yoon told me.

731
00:47:51,665 --> 00:47:53,295
This is an extremely important matter.

732
00:47:53,375 --> 00:47:56,505
Make sure this information doesn't leak.

733
00:47:57,755 --> 00:47:58,885
(knocking on door)

734
00:48:04,845 --> 00:48:06,725
KWON: I'll stop by your office soon.

735
00:48:07,685 --> 00:48:09,855
There's something
I need to tell you as well.

736
00:48:10,145 --> 00:48:11,475
HYUNJO: Yes, Father.

737
00:48:11,565 --> 00:48:12,435
Bye.

738
00:48:22,485 --> 00:48:23,945
HYUNJO: I'm sorry.

739
00:48:24,285 --> 00:48:26,365
It was rude of me to keep you waiting.

740
00:48:26,575 --> 00:48:28,825
No, sir. Not at all.

741
00:48:28,915 --> 00:48:30,325
-(chuckles)
-(sighs)

742
00:48:31,495 --> 00:48:33,415
How are you feeling?

743
00:48:34,585 --> 00:48:35,955
My boys were a bit harsh, right?

744
00:48:36,545 --> 00:48:38,425
Jeez, that must've really hurt.

745
00:48:39,635 --> 00:48:42,135
It's all my fault, sir.

746
00:48:42,635 --> 00:48:44,055
I'm deeply reflecting on myself.

747
00:48:44,555 --> 00:48:46,385
This is how my father is.

748
00:48:46,555 --> 00:48:50,145
If he senses arrogance in someone,
he doesn't hesitate to crush them.

749
00:48:50,805 --> 00:48:51,725
(Hyunjo clicks tongue)

750
00:48:51,805 --> 00:48:53,185
What can you do?

751
00:48:53,765 --> 00:48:56,485
Please understand, okay?

752
00:48:57,645 --> 00:48:59,145
(groans)

753
00:48:59,235 --> 00:49:01,485
Yes, sir. Of course.

754
00:49:01,565 --> 00:49:04,865
(both laugh)

755
00:49:06,325 --> 00:49:07,825
What were we talking about again?

756
00:49:08,705 --> 00:49:12,785
Right. It was about ARES
laying a golden egg--

757
00:49:12,875 --> 00:49:14,745
Yes, I remember now.

758
00:49:15,045 --> 00:49:17,005
Keep reading page seven.

759
00:49:18,545 --> 00:49:19,585
Yes, sir.

760
00:49:22,585 --> 00:49:24,095
"As for the United States--"

761
00:49:24,175 --> 00:49:25,715
HYUNJO: No, no, no.

762
00:49:26,885 --> 00:49:28,055
Just with your eyes.

763
00:49:30,055 --> 00:49:32,225
I see. Yes, sir.

764
00:49:36,185 --> 00:49:37,725
Listen to me as you read that.

765
00:49:38,315 --> 00:49:41,655
Those are your top priorities
once you become President.

766
00:49:42,235 --> 00:49:45,615
You'll be quite busy
assisting Haesong for the next five years.

767
00:49:46,235 --> 00:49:49,075
You'd better brace yourself.

768
00:49:50,455 --> 00:49:51,455
Yes, sir.

769
00:49:53,705 --> 00:49:57,745
But how did you come up with such ideas?

770
00:49:58,795 --> 00:50:01,625
You're incredibly revolutionary.

771
00:50:04,005 --> 00:50:07,055
And we'll be together
throughout the revolution.

772
00:50:07,555 --> 00:50:09,845
Here's to the beginning of your reign!

773
00:50:11,185 --> 00:50:15,935
(both laughing)

774
00:50:16,015 --> 00:50:17,565
I don't understand, sir.

775
00:50:18,225 --> 00:50:19,935
You're pulling the plug on your memoir?

776
00:50:20,605 --> 00:50:23,565
Hyesoo wanted to fly out
to our villa in Venice.

777
00:50:24,275 --> 00:50:26,775
She's going to stay there this summer.

778
00:50:28,365 --> 00:50:30,695
That was when
I was reminded of my late son.

779
00:50:31,745 --> 00:50:33,915
He sure loved that place.

780
00:50:34,995 --> 00:50:38,165
So I'm thinking about
making a trip there myself.

781
00:50:40,005 --> 00:50:41,215
In that case,

782
00:50:41,795 --> 00:50:44,715
we'll resume the memoir
after you return from your trip.

783
00:50:44,795 --> 00:50:46,715
I'm afraid it won't be anytime soon.

784
00:50:47,845 --> 00:50:48,845
Maybe next year.

785
00:50:51,135 --> 00:50:52,725
I'm sad too.

786
00:50:53,135 --> 00:50:57,055
I was counting down the days
until I could read my memoir.

787
00:51:00,145 --> 00:51:01,145
Sir.

788
00:51:02,815 --> 00:51:04,025
Am I the problem?

789
00:51:04,105 --> 00:51:06,615
(laughs)
No.

790
00:51:07,315 --> 00:51:10,945
The presidential election would be over
by the time I return from Venice.

791
00:51:11,535 --> 00:51:13,905
KWON: I'll be too busy with work.

792
00:51:13,995 --> 00:51:16,245
There's something
I've always considered as my life's work.

793
00:51:16,955 --> 00:51:18,745
I need to complete it.

794
00:51:18,835 --> 00:51:22,005
It can't be helped. Please do understand.

795
00:51:25,925 --> 00:51:28,465
MS. KWON: Pack enough water kimchi
and soy sauce marinated crab.

796
00:51:28,545 --> 00:51:30,555
He must eat well even when he's abroad.

797
00:51:30,755 --> 00:51:32,015
Yes, ma'am.

798
00:51:36,475 --> 00:51:38,435
I guess we're parting ways already.

799
00:51:39,225 --> 00:51:41,315
It's so sad to say goodbye.

800
00:51:41,395 --> 00:51:47,025
(cackling)

801
00:51:48,115 --> 00:51:51,235
(cackling continues)

802
00:51:53,245 --> 00:51:54,245
(door opens)

803
00:51:57,535 --> 00:51:58,575
Mr. Ha?

804
00:52:01,625 --> 00:52:02,625
You haven't left?

805
00:52:03,955 --> 00:52:06,045
I wanted to say goodbye before leaving.

806
00:52:06,545 --> 00:52:08,795
-Is something wrong?
-(sighs)

807
00:52:08,885 --> 00:52:10,845
The chairman is pulling the plug
on the memoir.

808
00:52:10,925 --> 00:52:12,135
(thuds)

809
00:52:12,215 --> 00:52:15,425
Does that mean
I'll only get paid half the amount?

810
00:52:15,515 --> 00:52:18,345
No, I'll give you the full amount.

811
00:52:18,975 --> 00:52:20,605
You need it for your father's surgery.

812
00:52:21,355 --> 00:52:22,975
Thank you.

813
00:52:24,025 --> 00:52:25,855
The chairman must be very busy.

814
00:52:25,935 --> 00:52:27,525
I heard he's preparing a new business.

815
00:52:27,605 --> 00:52:29,025
A new business?

816
00:52:30,405 --> 00:52:31,235
Who said that?

817
00:52:32,115 --> 00:52:33,365
Ms. Yoon.

818
00:52:33,865 --> 00:52:35,745
DONGRIM: I didn't know she was deaf.

819
00:52:35,905 --> 00:52:38,495
But I know sign language
because of my dad.

820
00:52:40,995 --> 00:52:42,535
KWON: How is it going?

821
00:52:57,475 --> 00:52:58,305
(soft pop)

822
00:52:59,515 --> 00:53:00,895
DONGRIM:
Hwang Byungchul from New Future Party

823
00:53:00,975 --> 00:53:02,475
and Haesong must be doing something.

824
00:53:02,555 --> 00:53:05,645
That geezer promised to provide the police
with arms if he becomes President.

825
00:53:06,145 --> 00:53:06,985
Automatic pistols.

826
00:53:08,395 --> 00:53:10,735
-Are you sure?
-I was there.

827
00:53:15,785 --> 00:53:17,405
Automatic pistols?

828
00:53:18,155 --> 00:53:20,115
Does that mean
they'll get rid of blank ammunition?

829
00:53:23,625 --> 00:53:24,915
Strengthening governmental power?

830
00:53:25,875 --> 00:53:27,205
But why Haesong?

831
00:53:29,925 --> 00:53:31,545
MR. CHOI:
This is a peculiarity of Haesong.

832
00:53:31,925 --> 00:53:35,055
It is the only group that is affiliated
with the country's biggest arms dealer.

833
00:53:37,925 --> 00:53:40,265
There's something
I've always considered as my life's work.

834
00:53:40,845 --> 00:53:42,475
I need to complete it.

835
00:53:44,305 --> 00:53:45,685
Weapons business.

836
00:53:45,765 --> 00:53:49,315
You're right. He's planning to slowly
make firearms accessible to all.

837
00:53:49,395 --> 00:53:50,275
Isn't that crazy?

838
00:53:50,355 --> 00:53:52,735
Everyone will purchase one for themselves.

839
00:53:52,815 --> 00:53:55,695
Everyone is so hot-tempered
so massacres are just waiting to happen.

840
00:53:55,775 --> 00:53:58,575
I bet you'll buy one too and shoot me.

841
00:54:05,205 --> 00:54:07,585
He's not listening. He never listens.

842
00:54:07,665 --> 00:54:08,505
Bye.

843
00:54:22,725 --> 00:54:25,605
(chuckles)
What should we do?

844
00:54:26,475 --> 00:54:28,015
That was supposed to be confidential.

845
00:54:31,445 --> 00:54:35,525
Well, I wasn't trying to spy on you.

846
00:54:36,115 --> 00:54:37,905
I just saw you two.

847
00:54:39,365 --> 00:54:42,245
And I happen to know sign language.

848
00:54:42,995 --> 00:54:44,415
I'm sorry, sir.

849
00:54:46,375 --> 00:54:47,375
It's okay, Dongrim.

850
00:54:47,455 --> 00:54:50,205
We still told him even though
you found out accidentally.

851
00:54:50,795 --> 00:54:53,215
By the way, shouldn't you get going now?

852
00:54:53,965 --> 00:54:55,135
Right.

853
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:58,635
Sir, thank you for everything.

854
00:54:59,595 --> 00:55:00,965
We'll be on our way then.

855
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:06,895
No.

856
00:55:07,685 --> 00:55:10,605
This isn't something
to brush off that easily.

857
00:55:11,855 --> 00:55:12,735
Sorry?

858
00:55:12,815 --> 00:55:15,945
You found out
about Haesong supporting Candidate Hwang

859
00:55:16,445 --> 00:55:17,905
and the firearms.

860
00:55:18,405 --> 00:55:22,155
If word gets out,
this will critically affect the election.

861
00:55:22,745 --> 00:55:23,995
It'll be irreparable.

862
00:55:25,955 --> 00:55:29,455
You don't need to worry about that.
We will both be tight-lipped about it.

863
00:55:29,955 --> 00:55:31,955
Yes, sir. I promise.

864
00:55:32,045 --> 00:55:33,165
You promise?

865
00:55:34,465 --> 00:55:36,045
How naive.

866
00:55:36,715 --> 00:55:38,675
Verbal promises

867
00:55:38,755 --> 00:55:41,595
are only valid among friends.

868
00:55:42,715 --> 00:55:44,845
Then what would you like us to do?

869
00:55:45,805 --> 00:55:47,145
Knowing too much is a sin.

870
00:55:49,555 --> 00:55:51,565
(ominous music)

871
00:55:54,275 --> 00:55:55,775
I'm still thinking…

872
00:55:57,525 --> 00:55:59,735
about what to do with you.

873
00:56:07,615 --> 00:56:09,665
(suspenseful music)

874
00:56:25,805 --> 00:56:27,185
I'm afraid you'll have to die.

875
00:56:27,265 --> 00:56:30,015
(tense music)

876
00:56:46,405 --> 00:56:47,995
(chuckles)

877
00:56:48,575 --> 00:56:49,665
I'm just joking.

878
00:56:52,455 --> 00:56:53,915
KWON: Let's do this.

879
00:56:54,835 --> 00:56:57,545
You are forbidden from leaving this house

880
00:56:58,625 --> 00:57:00,885
until the presidential election is over.

881
00:57:04,175 --> 00:57:05,385
(sighs)

882
00:57:14,565 --> 00:57:16,185
DONGRIM: "I'm afraid you'll have to die."

883
00:57:17,235 --> 00:57:18,895
Gosh, I almost peed my pants.

884
00:57:19,025 --> 00:57:21,945
How could he say such a frightening thing
in a sophisticated manner?

885
00:57:22,235 --> 00:57:24,525
He should've just sworn at us.
That was terrifying.

886
00:57:25,035 --> 00:57:26,325
Anyway, you heard him, right?

887
00:57:26,405 --> 00:57:28,995
We can only leave
once the election comes to an end.

888
00:57:29,365 --> 00:57:31,575
So don't tell me to go home anymore.

889
00:57:31,665 --> 00:57:33,075
I can't even if I want to.

890
00:57:40,255 --> 00:57:41,795
What should I do with him?

891
00:57:43,345 --> 00:57:44,465
SUHYEON: Do I know you?

892
00:57:45,465 --> 00:57:47,555
You haven't called once,
so I thought you were dead.

893
00:57:48,135 --> 00:57:49,555
I called you yesterday.

894
00:57:49,635 --> 00:57:52,435
You did? Oh, was that you?

895
00:57:52,515 --> 00:57:54,355
I didn't recognize the number,
so I thought it was a spam call.

896
00:57:54,435 --> 00:57:57,355
Where in the world are you?

897
00:57:57,435 --> 00:57:58,855
Are you having that much fun?

898
00:57:58,935 --> 00:58:00,355
It's pretty much heaven here.

899
00:58:01,195 --> 00:58:02,855
I should keep traveling
until the day I die.

900
00:58:03,775 --> 00:58:04,775
How are you?

901
00:58:04,865 --> 00:58:07,285
Is this really you?

902
00:58:07,575 --> 00:58:09,075
You're asking me how I'm doing?

903
00:58:09,945 --> 00:58:12,205
By the way, you know what?

904
00:58:16,495 --> 00:58:18,415
(clicks tongue)
Never mind.

905
00:58:19,585 --> 00:58:20,835
I'm busy. Bye.

906
00:58:21,415 --> 00:58:22,505
How did it go?

907
00:58:23,255 --> 00:58:25,175
It's finished, sir.

908
00:58:25,755 --> 00:58:26,805
Thank you.

909
00:58:32,345 --> 00:58:34,345
(breathes deeply)

910
00:58:36,765 --> 00:58:38,435
(sighs heavily)

911
00:58:42,775 --> 00:58:44,775
(solemn music)

912
00:58:50,365 --> 00:58:51,285
(knocking on door)

913
00:58:51,365 --> 00:58:53,285
-Are you in?
-Police.

914
00:58:53,365 --> 00:58:55,325
-(knocking continues)
-Honey.

915
00:58:55,415 --> 00:58:57,205
(breathes deeply)

916
00:58:57,285 --> 00:58:59,995
Seohee, do you remember what I told you?

917
00:59:00,505 --> 00:59:03,795
You didn't see anything that night, okay?

918
00:59:03,925 --> 00:59:04,835
YOUNG SEOHEE: Okay.

919
00:59:04,925 --> 00:59:07,925
Good. What a good girl.

920
00:59:10,715 --> 00:59:11,885
Dad.

921
00:59:13,225 --> 00:59:14,265
(door opens)

922
00:59:27,195 --> 00:59:28,695
That's him.

923
00:59:29,405 --> 00:59:31,235
He's the man I saw that day.

924
00:59:32,075 --> 00:59:33,785
When the police came to our house,

925
00:59:34,285 --> 00:59:36,205
my dad told them
that he was the one who saw him.

926
00:59:41,705 --> 00:59:44,505
He probably did that to protect you.

927
00:59:47,715 --> 00:59:49,095
What's our next move?

928
00:59:49,845 --> 00:59:51,005
I know someone...

929
00:59:52,385 --> 00:59:54,425
who might know this man.

930
01:00:07,565 --> 01:00:08,905
(car engine starts)

931
01:00:12,735 --> 01:00:14,745
(suspenseful music)

932
01:00:15,705 --> 01:00:17,115
MS. LEE: I'm at the funeral home.

933
01:00:17,205 --> 01:00:19,825
That reporter's parents passed away.

934
01:00:26,875 --> 01:00:28,175
Sir.

935
01:00:31,045 --> 01:00:33,465
Are you sure?
Someone's tailing Song Suhyeon?

936
01:00:36,015 --> 01:00:37,185
It's them.

937
01:00:38,805 --> 01:00:40,855
MS. KWON: You're not going on that trip?

938
01:00:41,015 --> 01:00:43,225
No, it just turned out that way.

939
01:00:44,025 --> 01:00:45,735
I don't see the need to do that, sir.

940
01:00:45,815 --> 01:00:47,315
What can I do?

941
01:00:47,735 --> 01:00:51,195
It's not like I can bury Mr. Ha
and his pupil somewhere.

942
01:00:51,695 --> 01:00:54,945
I'll have to keep them here
until the election is over.

943
01:00:56,195 --> 01:00:57,285
In the meantime,

944
01:00:58,455 --> 01:01:01,575
I can finish my memoir.

945
01:01:07,005 --> 01:01:12,385
(grunting, panting)

946
01:01:12,465 --> 01:01:15,595
(screams)

947
01:01:15,675 --> 01:01:17,975
How dare you?

948
01:01:18,425 --> 01:01:20,845
What gives you the right?

949
01:01:21,225 --> 01:01:23,395
How dare you control my master?

950
01:01:23,475 --> 01:01:26,145
That little scumbag!

951
01:01:26,225 --> 01:01:28,695
(growling)

952
01:01:28,775 --> 01:01:30,315
I ought to kill him!

953
01:01:30,605 --> 01:01:32,905
That rat deserves to die!

954
01:01:32,985 --> 01:01:38,365
(panting)

955
01:01:44,205 --> 01:01:46,625
(tense music)

956
01:01:50,675 --> 01:01:54,175
MS. KWON: "The letter you sent me."

957
01:02:01,765 --> 01:02:03,935
(tense music continues)

958
01:02:09,895 --> 01:02:10,985
MR. CHOI: What did you say?

959
01:02:11,605 --> 01:02:14,695
Did you know that
they are aiming to legalize firearms?

960
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:17,195
(scoffs)
What are you?

961
01:02:17,905 --> 01:02:19,245
How much do you know?

962
01:02:19,325 --> 01:02:21,955
Once Candidate Hwang gets elected,
they'll begin that project.

963
01:02:22,575 --> 01:02:24,785
You'll have to complete your mission
before the election,

964
01:02:24,875 --> 01:02:26,375
but you're running out of time.

965
01:02:28,335 --> 01:02:30,585
I won't let that happen.
We'll stop him at all costs.

966
01:02:30,665 --> 01:02:31,835
Of course you should.

967
01:02:31,925 --> 01:02:35,175
That's why we should make our move
on Chairman Kwon.

968
01:02:37,465 --> 01:02:39,635
Do you think it'll all be over
once you catch him?

969
01:02:40,135 --> 01:02:42,685
What did he do? What can you prove?

970
01:02:43,185 --> 01:02:46,015
Do you think the police
and the prosecution failed to catch him

971
01:02:46,225 --> 01:02:48,015
because we were incompetent?

972
01:02:48,105 --> 01:02:51,735
I see. So that's your conclusion?
You can't catch him?

973
01:02:51,855 --> 01:02:53,105
Don't be reckless.

974
01:02:53,655 --> 01:02:55,235
You don't know Haesong's true face.

975
01:02:55,945 --> 01:02:57,275
Legalizing firearms?

976
01:02:57,365 --> 01:02:59,365
That's a cakewalk for them.

977
01:02:59,655 --> 01:03:01,785
They've won over
the media and politics already.

978
01:03:02,995 --> 01:03:05,875
Their only hurdle is public opinion.

979
01:03:06,665 --> 01:03:09,745
Haesong will do everything they can
to win over the public.

980
01:03:09,955 --> 01:03:12,375
They won't hesitate
to subject our society to chaos.

981
01:03:12,585 --> 01:03:14,295
They'll make it necessary for civilians

982
01:03:14,925 --> 01:03:16,835
to carry a gun to the grocery store.

983
01:03:20,135 --> 01:03:22,305
What is it?
Do you find it hard to believe?

984
01:03:22,385 --> 01:03:25,475
Not at all.
This is all possible for those bastards.

985
01:03:27,975 --> 01:03:29,065
Bastards?

986
01:03:30,605 --> 01:03:32,145
It's not just Chairman Kwon?

987
01:03:35,195 --> 01:03:37,695
The chairman doesn't get blood
on his own hands.

988
01:03:37,865 --> 01:03:39,115
He unleashes his hounds.

989
01:03:39,615 --> 01:03:41,785
If we fail to catch those bastards,

990
01:03:42,195 --> 01:03:43,745
we'll never get to the chairman.

991
01:03:44,405 --> 01:03:46,365
So that's why you've gone undercover.

992
01:03:47,575 --> 01:03:49,495
This is why you've been trying
to win their trust.

993
01:03:49,585 --> 01:03:52,205
This is the two-year-long project
that you've been carrying out.

994
01:03:54,585 --> 01:03:58,045
Mr. Choi, you're trying to
get into that team, aren't you?

995
01:04:02,635 --> 01:04:04,515
(sighs)
Team A.

996
01:04:07,095 --> 01:04:09,105
(ominous music)

997
01:04:15,105 --> 01:04:17,065
MR. CHOI:
Haesong's professional troubleshooters.

998
01:04:17,905 --> 01:04:19,525
No one ever survived.

999
01:04:20,825 --> 01:04:23,615
A civilian like you should back off.
You could easily get killed.

1000
01:04:26,245 --> 01:04:28,035
WOOSIN: Team A.

1001
01:04:28,365 --> 01:04:31,665
We need to get to them
to eventually catch the chairman

1002
01:04:32,085 --> 01:04:34,375
since the latter
doesn't get his hands dirty.

1003
01:04:35,255 --> 01:04:37,965
But my father's case is different.

1004
01:04:38,965 --> 01:04:41,795
It's directly linked to the chairman.

1005
01:04:42,595 --> 01:04:44,215
-What's your proof?
-I have none.

1006
01:04:44,305 --> 01:04:45,385
(Mr. Choi scoffs)

1007
01:04:46,725 --> 01:04:47,765
However…

1008
01:04:50,305 --> 01:04:51,605
someone did testify.

1009
01:04:52,935 --> 01:04:55,395
HYESOO: I don't know for sure
if he was the killer or not.

1010
01:04:57,145 --> 01:04:59,195
But this is what my husband said.

1011
01:05:00,155 --> 01:05:01,365
Eun Hyesoo?

1012
01:05:03,075 --> 01:05:05,365
HYESOO:
"My father killed someone with the Adamas.

1013
01:05:06,035 --> 01:05:09,075
And Lee Changwoo was the one
who took the fall."

1014
01:05:10,955 --> 01:05:12,955
(tense music)

1015
01:05:22,755 --> 01:05:25,595
(metal screeching)

1016
01:05:25,675 --> 01:05:26,515
(music stops)

1017
01:05:27,475 --> 01:05:31,395
CHANGWOO: So what if he's a prosecutor?
I'm not at his beck and call.

1018
01:05:53,495 --> 01:05:54,585
(door closes)

1019
01:05:55,415 --> 01:05:57,045
(door lock rattles)

1020
01:06:06,135 --> 01:06:09,095
I'm Prosecutor Song Suhyeon from
the Central District Prosecutors' Office.

1021
01:06:11,435 --> 01:06:12,645
Hello, sir.

1022
01:06:14,055 --> 01:06:16,645
Why did you want to see me?

1023
01:06:17,685 --> 01:06:19,315
I need your help, Mr. Lee.

1024
01:06:22,355 --> 01:06:24,065
My help?

1025
01:06:26,525 --> 01:06:29,285
Let's see.

1026
01:06:31,825 --> 01:06:33,415
I'm working on a case.

1027
01:06:33,495 --> 01:06:36,205
And I think you may recognize the suspect.

1028
01:06:37,955 --> 01:06:41,715
That's strange. I've cut ties with society
after being incarcerated.

1029
01:06:42,965 --> 01:06:44,005
It's this man.

1030
01:06:49,885 --> 01:06:51,225
Do you recognize him?

1031
01:06:55,645 --> 01:06:57,105
No, I don't.

1032
01:06:58,975 --> 01:07:00,225
You don't?

1033
01:07:01,395 --> 01:07:02,395
CHANGWOO: No, sir.

1034
01:07:05,405 --> 01:07:08,325
Then do you recognize me?
We've met before.

1035
01:07:18,835 --> 01:07:19,995
I'm not sure.

1036
01:07:21,415 --> 01:07:23,045
I don't quite remember.

1037
01:07:24,005 --> 01:07:26,005
Twenty-two years is a long time.

1038
01:07:28,005 --> 01:07:29,715
But the memory is still vivid for me.

1039
01:07:33,635 --> 01:07:36,725
You killed my father.

1040
01:07:39,185 --> 01:07:41,185
(somber music)

1041
01:07:44,195 --> 01:07:45,695
It's good to see you again.

1042
01:07:49,525 --> 01:07:51,235
-REPORTER 1: Let's go!
-REPORTER 2: They're coming out!

1043
01:07:51,325 --> 01:07:53,745
-REPORTER 3: Did you act alone?
-REPORTER 4: Let's go.

1044
01:07:53,825 --> 01:07:57,115
REPORTER 5:
What was the motive for your murder?

1045
01:07:57,205 --> 01:07:59,745
Please tell us your motive!

1046
01:08:00,795 --> 01:08:03,205
YOUNG SUHYEON:
You murderer! Remember my face!

1047
01:08:03,335 --> 01:08:06,045
Because I'll make you pay!

1048
01:08:07,125 --> 01:08:08,385
POLICE: Get him away from here!

1049
01:08:09,595 --> 01:08:10,965
You murderer!

1050
01:08:11,055 --> 01:08:13,595
(camera shutters clicking)

1051
01:08:19,055 --> 01:08:20,305
All right.

1052
01:08:21,475 --> 01:08:22,775
Let's get back to the subject.

1053
01:08:23,605 --> 01:08:24,935
Who is this?

1054
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:28,735
I don't know.

1055
01:08:30,655 --> 01:08:32,285
Then I'll change the question.

1056
01:08:33,115 --> 01:08:35,365
Who took the murder weapon?

1057
01:08:37,995 --> 01:08:39,165
Why would you ask me that?

1058
01:08:39,245 --> 01:08:40,285
You don't know that either?

1059
01:08:42,665 --> 01:08:45,755
I don't. I really don't know.

1060
01:08:46,875 --> 01:08:48,215
Are you sure he didn't take it?

1061
01:08:50,045 --> 01:08:52,345
No, sir. I don't know him.

1062
01:08:52,425 --> 01:08:55,385
This case occurred 22 years ago,
and I already confessed to it.

1063
01:08:55,465 --> 01:08:57,265
It was a false confession.

1064
01:08:59,645 --> 01:09:00,725
Why would I…

1065
01:09:03,565 --> 01:09:04,525
do that?

1066
01:09:08,395 --> 01:09:10,275
Because you wanted
to protect this bastard!

1067
01:09:10,865 --> 01:09:11,905
Damn it!

1068
01:09:12,365 --> 01:09:13,735
(loud clank)

1069
01:09:15,365 --> 01:09:17,285
Because he was an accomplice!

1070
01:09:24,335 --> 01:09:26,665
(breathes heavily)

1071
01:09:29,005 --> 01:09:29,835
(thuds)

1072
01:09:29,925 --> 01:09:32,045
(closing theme music)

1073
01:09:50,645 --> 01:09:51,905
HYESOO: You must've forgotten…

1074
01:09:51,985 --> 01:09:53,025
SECURITY CONTROL ROOM

1075
01:09:53,115 --> 01:09:54,655
…that you threatened me.

1076
01:09:54,735 --> 01:09:57,155
SEOHEE: I should go into the tiger's den
if I want to catch it.

1077
01:09:57,235 --> 01:09:59,745
I refuse to tremble in fear,
not knowing who it is.

1078
01:10:00,325 --> 01:10:02,915
I'll reveal everything
you're hiding one by one.

1079
01:10:03,665 --> 01:10:06,795
You should hurry
if you want to catch the real killer.

1080
01:10:07,375 --> 01:10:10,045
A composite sketch artist?
It was the daughter.

1081
01:10:10,755 --> 01:10:13,005
All right, let's do this.

1082
01:10:13,675 --> 01:10:16,215
WOOSIN: I'm going to start a fire today.
