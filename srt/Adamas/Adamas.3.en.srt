1
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:06,006
(theme music)

2
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,463
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,965
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,052
(suspenseful music)

5
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:15,909
WOOSIN: <i>I'm going to steal the Adamas.</i>

6
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:18,203
To reveal that it was used for the murder,

7
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:21,039
the autopsy result and Adamas
must be collated.

8
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:24,000
Would Haesong cooperate? No, never.

9
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,211
Are you out of your mind?

10
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,629
You need to help me.

11
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:32,717
He's insane.

12
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,803
(tense music)

13
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,312
HYESOO: <i>It wasn't me.</i>

14
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,648
<i>I didn't recommend you.</i>

15
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,120
(door opens)

16
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,002
-Mr. Choi.
-Don't look too surprised.

17
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,797
I just wanted to talk to you in private.

18
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,091
Sure.

19
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,510
I need you to leave this house.

20
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,220
This is an ultimatum.

21
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:21,224
I have no plans to do that,
let alone empty-handed.

22
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:22,934
Continue being cheeky,
and you'll get hurt.

23
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,311
Much more than you think.

24
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,188
I'm hot-tempered, you see.

25
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,108
You're so predictable.

26
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:33,111
Judging by how you're threatening me,
you must be in a rush.

27
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,696
I won't tolerate you anymore.

28
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,116
I could easily

29
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,119
get rid of you…

30
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,120
(thuds)

31
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:44,205
(ominous music)

32
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,333
(glass clinks)

33
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,460
(gasps)

34
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,337
(groans)

35
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:52,463
(mutters)

36
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:53,464
(grunts)

37
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:54,465
What's going on?

38
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,134
(gasps)

39
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:58,928
(ominous music)

40
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,471
-Ms. Kwon.
-(Woosin gasps for air)

41
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,685
I can't breathe, Mr. Choi…

42
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,478
(gasps)

43
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:09,063
That…

44
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,357
That…

45
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,568
(Woosin grunts)

46
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,237
That…

47
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:17,906
Get it together! Exactly which one?

48
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,534
(tense music)

49
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,631
That's vitamin K, right?

50
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,009
Vitamin K is an antidote for rat poison.

51
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:40,053
You'd know if you've read my book.

52
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:43,473
The character's lover was fed
rat-poisoned food every day.

53
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,184
And the character
ate some too to avoid suspicion,

54
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:48,811
but also took some vitamin K, an antidote…

55
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,146
(chuckles)

56
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,606
…in order to live.

57
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:55,985
Are you toying with me?

58
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,154
It was a test.

59
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,242
You're not the only one
who can sound someone out.

60
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,910
You little scumbag!

61
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,621
Curse at me all you want,

62
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:09,082
but you still won't intimidate me.

63
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:11,417
Your decisions
are what show your true nature.

64
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:14,295
Your true colors are revealed
depending on what decisions you make

65
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,923
during certain situations.

66
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,846
You chose to save me which means

67
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,640
you can't kill me.

68
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,478
(bottle rattles, thuds)

69
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:31,688
Cut this nonsense.

70
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,525
I chose not to kill you because

71
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:40,321
I didn't see the need to go that far
just to kick you out of here.

72
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:43,700
I'm going to kick you
out of this house effortlessly.

73
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,910
Will you grab me by the collar
and drag me out?

74
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,623
(breathes heavily)

75
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,458
No.

76
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,044
I won't lay a hand on you.

77
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,047
You're not my target.

78
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,553
(tense music)

79
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,348
I'm not your target?

80
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:13,146
MR. CHOI:
<i>Right. She should've arrived by now.</i>

81
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:18,860
You must know best
what your Achilles' heel is.

82
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,575
REPORTER:
<i>Kim's wife, Im, got into a car accident</i>

83
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:29,162
<i>and couldn't sustain her life
without any help.</i>

84
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:33,458
<i>The police are assuming
that Kim was exhausted</i>

85
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,626
<i>from nursing his wife that he ended up</i>

86
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:37,920
<i>murdering her and taking his own life</i>

87
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,089

Suhyeon.

89
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,598
REPORTER:
<i>The police find it highly probable…</i>

90
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:49,640
It can't be.

91
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:52,226
<i>…that these circumstances
were the cause of this incident.</i>

92
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,520
<i>They're investigating the details</i>

93
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:57,648
<i>by interviewing the bereaved
and witnesses.</i>

94
00:05:58,608 --> 00:05:59,776
Who are you?

95
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:03,154
(suspenseful music)

96
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,248
(sighs)

97
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,044
Ms. Kim.

98
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:20,546
Why are you…

99
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:22,632
(sobs)

100
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:28,679
Ms. Kim.

101
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,682
(sobs)

102
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,477
It's all my fault.

103
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,898
Did something happen? What do you mean?

104
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:42,235
I am…

105
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,655
to blame.

106
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,408
I took you to their house.

107
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:52,161
What are you talking about?

108
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,332
My parents…

109
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,086
passed away.

110
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,424
REPORTER: <i>I'm Reporter Seo Yeonjin,
reporting from the crime scene.</i>

111
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,343
<i>The neighbors have testified

112
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,138
<i>and are heartbroken over this incident.</i>

113
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,932
<i>After the police investigated
the crime scene…</i>

114
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,267
Are you saying…

115
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,855
they were your parents?

116
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,483
(tense music)

117
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,129
Dad.

118
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,644
Mom.

119
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,234
(gasps)

120
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:12,450
SEOHEE: Dad.

121
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:14,410

(solemn music)

128
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:55,826
He's still safe for now.
We're just tailing him.

129
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,913
You're watching him?

130
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,623
Don't be so relieved just yet.

131
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,376
Keep in mind that we can always

132
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:04,877
kill him or let him live.

133
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,421
Stay away from him this instant.

134
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,298
Shouldn't you have expected this much

135
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,717
when you blackmailed
the Special Investigations Headquarters?

136
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:15,805
People around you will face harm
instead of you.

137
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,477
Let me tell you something right now.

138
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,021
You're making a mistake.

139
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,278
(door opens, closes)

140
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:32,697
You should've braced yourself

141
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,533
if you threw the first punch.

142
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:41,247
Don't worry, Mom.
I'm eating well and doing great.

143
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,708
How's Dad doing?

144
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,334
(chuckles)
Your dad?

145
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:47,587
How is he?

146
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:51,215
-Eating well?
-(chuckles)

147
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:54,302
DONGRIM'S MOM:
<i>Jeez, your dad misses you so much.</i>

148
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:57,346
Tell him I miss him too. Okay.

149
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,516
I need to use the phone.
It's an emergency.

150
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,185
-But still--
-Dongrim.

151
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,772
Here.

152
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:13,654
(line ringing)

153
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:18,909

(engine revs)

160
00:10:58,574 --> 00:10:59,784
Please stop the car.

161
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,871
-Sorry?
-You can go back home.

162
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:05,581
I'll take care of this.

163
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,003
(sighs)

164
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,257
Please pull over.

165
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,641
(sighs)

166
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,354
-What are you doing?
-Pull over.

167
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:32,066
-Right now!
-Ms. Kim, please calm down.

168
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:35,069
Calm down. This is dangerous.

169
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,407
(sighs)

170
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:55,881
SUHYEON: You came to me for help.

171
00:11:58,175 --> 00:11:59,677
But now, you don't want my help?

172
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,139
I told you.
I'll take care of this on my own.

173
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,602
I shouldn't have come to you
in the first place.

174
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:12,606
Ms. Kim.

175
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,402
You think it wasn't suicide, right?

176
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,116
Isn't that why you came to see me?

177
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:29,039
(somber music)

178
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,794
I know that you're confused and scared.

179
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,297
But let's remain levelheaded.

180
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,424
We need to understand what's going on.

181
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,720
(sobs)

182
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:44,930
(sighs)

183
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,933
I don't know what came over me.

184
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:52,229
I must've been out of my mind
for a minute.

185
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:03,365
I just couldn't trust anyone
in this situation.

186
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,495
SUHYEON: I understand.

187
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:11,791
Let's dig into this together.

188
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:19,840
I'm sorry about what happened.

189
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:23,677
(sighs)

190
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:28,265
They didn't commit suicide.
They would never.

191
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,726
I'm sure of it.

192
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,146
(solemn music)

193
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:37,817
(music stops)

194
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,777
MR. CHOI:
<i>Shouldn't you have expected this much</i>

195
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,363
<i>when you blackmailed
the Special Investigations Headquarters?</i>

196
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:45,533
<i>People around you will face harm
instead of you.</i>

197
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,791
You've got beef with Mr. Choi, don't you?

198
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,044
Did you guys fight?

199
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:00,714
Right. I get it.

200
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:04,468
You have a knack for upsetting others.

201
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:08,264
Looking like a psychopath,
your words are merciless.

202
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,599
But you only state the facts.

203
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,143
It really gets to us, you know?

204
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,770
-Lee Dongrim.
-Yes?

205
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:16,814
Leave this house.

206
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,066
Oh, come on.

207
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,276
I'm not joking around.

208
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,613
To be honest,

209
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:28,075
I need some extra cash.

210
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,537
I know I should listen to you.

211
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,164
But my dad will be getting
a liver transplant soon.

212
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,542
I need more money for the surgery.

213
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,170
I didn't know that.

214
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,130
(chuckles)

215
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,843
Okay, I'll chip in.

216
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,721
-What?
-I'll give you as much money as you need,

217
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,097
so leave first thing tomorrow.

218
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,641
But why would you…

219
00:14:56,937 --> 00:15:00,524
Well, if that's what you want, then okay.

220
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:10,492
(door opens, closes)

221
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,168
WOOSIN: Lieutenant Choi.

222
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,011
Oh, my mistake.

223
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,056
I meant Mr. Choi.

224
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:36,185
-So you're putting up a fight.
-Are you afraid?

225
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,146
If you wish to keep my mouth shut,
leave Suhyeon alone.

226
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:41,440
I have cards up my sleeve too, you know.

227
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,233
Telling Chairman Kwon the truth?

228
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,069
That I'm actually an undercover cop?

229
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:47,988
Bring it on.
Let's see who goes down first.

230
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,449
You're wrong.

231
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:53,202
I'm talking about
the Special Investigations Headquarters.

232
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,244
What are you getting at?

233
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:57,122
That's the reason why
you want me to leave.

234
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:01,043
They want to question me
about how I found out about you.

235
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,545
A slip of the tongue,
and I could put all of you in danger.

236
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,423
You're digging your own grave.

237
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,176
Are you begging to be killed tonight?

238
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,261
I met an ally.

239
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:13,973
Give me some time.

240
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:19,436
Are they willing to help you
steal the Adamas this instant?

241
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:20,562
No.

242
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,608
I need their help with something else.

243
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,152
(sly music)

244
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,169
(sly music fades)

245
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:49,925
(knocking on door)

246
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,344
(door opens, closes)

247
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,143
Ms. Kwon.

248
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,687
I said leave me alone.

249
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:05,065
Will you really not see him off today?

250
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:08,360
But you've never missed a day.

251
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:11,363
The chairman seems to be waiting for you.

252
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,907
(tray clatters)

253
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:19,538
He wanted you to have this, so drink up.

254
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:23,167
He wanted you to have this

255
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,544
because he knew you had a weak knee.

256
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:26,920
Here.

257
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:28,922
(sighs)

258
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,892
PREMIUM SUPPLEMENT FOR JOINT HEALTH

259
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,570
(slurping)

260
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,079
(mellow music)

261
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,004
Gosh, this is pretty.

262
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:10,798
You're prettier, Hyesoo.

263
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:20,974
(knocking on door)

264
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:35,823
(doorknob clicks)

265
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,742
(sly music)

266
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,103
DONGRIM:
I bet there's no other assistant like me.

267
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,355
-(keyboard clacking)
-I could've just left like you told me to,

268
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,816
but I insisted on finishing my work first.

269
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,110
I'm such a professional.

270
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:18,699
Mr. Ha, I understand that memoirs
are supposed to be sugarcoated,

271
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:20,909
but he's gone too far
about his son's married life.

272
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,578
Rumor has it that
it was a marriage of convenience,

273
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:25,747
and she was supposed to wed someone else.
Why sugarcoat it into a love story?

274
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,208
(door slams)

275
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,294
(approaching footsteps)

276
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,381
We need to talk.

277
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,134
Sure. Dongrim.

278
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,640
Right. I'll be outside.

279
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:51,732
(door closes)

280
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,986
What is this? Is this a joke?

281
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,740
Certainly not. It's blackmail.

282
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:02,618
Like it says,
I have the letter that you sent.

283
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,994
Do you remember that?

284
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,121
So what do you want from me?

285
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,539
I had asked for your help.

286
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,791
And I said no.

287
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,835
I can't help you steal the Adamas.

288
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,171
I never asked you to do that.

289
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:16,924
Is that so?

290
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:20,135
Then how can I help you?

291
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:24,014
There's a reason why
you wrote me that letter.

292
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,682
Yes. I wanted you to reveal the truth.

293
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,268
You had nothing to do
with the case from 22 years ago,

294
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:31,146
yet you wrote to me
without asking for anything in return.

295
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,648
-That's unbelievable.
-I don't care.

296
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,399
You know the real killer.

297
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:37,986
(tense music)

298
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,199
Who is it?

299
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:49,373
This is my answer.

300
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,965
If you want to threaten me,
do it properly.

301
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,767
(door opens, closes)

302
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,313
(sighs)

303
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,362
AGENT KIM: Are you setting a snare?

304
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,781
That's illegal.

305
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,409
-Then report me.
-(chuckles)

306
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,621
You've been going
into the woods often lately.

307
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:32,457
I think you're working overtime too.

308
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,876
Then you should be
the new chief of security.

309
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,878
Maybe I should.
(chuckles)

310
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:40,924
Goodbye, sir.

311
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,974
MR. CHOI: <i>I knew it.
There's something you haven't told me.</i>

312
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,436
Well? I'm all ears.

313
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:56,023
Twenty-two years ago,
a murder occurred in May.

314
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:57,858
Nice opening.

315
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:00,444
The culprit was caught
and given the death sentence.

316
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,654
But the murder weapon disappeared.

317
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,490
It disappeared?

318
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,159
I believe it was the Adamas.

319
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:09,703
WOOSIN: That's why I want to steal it.

320
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,831
I'll know for sure once it's collated
with the autopsy results.

321
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,043
But why would you do that?

322
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,505
My father was the victim.

323
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,216
I see.

324
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:26,136
I get that, but I still have a question.

325
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:30,265
Why go through this trouble
if the killer was caught?

326
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:31,808
The real killer is someone else.

327
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,394
Who do you think took the murder weapon?

328
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,316
This is intriguing.

329
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:43,362
The one who has the Adamas
is the real killer or knows who it is.

330
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:48,200
Your ally must have the answer.

331
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,537
The answer is obvious.

332
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:56,416
Hold on.

333
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,669
May, 22 years ago?

334
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:10,222
Have a seat.

335
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,100
I prefer to stand.

336
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,185
Should I keep standing too?

337
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:18,146
(clears throat)

338
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,868
It doesn't look infected.

339
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,329
It must've hurt a lot.

340
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,248
That's okay.

341
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:39,626
My body will be useless once I die.
What's the point of cherishing it?

342
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:43,588
I admit that I was
too worked up yesterday.

343
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:45,674
You were right.

344
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:49,511
There's something about the way he smiles.

345
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,597
He reminds me of Minjo.

346
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:58,228
Minjo took after his mom
and had a bright smile.

347
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:01,189
It was soft too.

348
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,695
Mr. Ha exudes a similar aura.

349
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,407
That must've pulled at my heartstrings.

350
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:14,911
See? I know you, sir.

351
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:20,000
And yet, you were only upset with me
and even hurt me.

352
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,002
Please understand me.

353
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:24,504
You've lost a child too.

354
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:28,091
We've experienced the same loss,
so can't you empathize with me?

355
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:34,556
Of course I am grateful to have you.

356
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:38,393
I know you wouldn't hesitate
to sacrifice yourself

357
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,812
to save me through thick and thin.

358
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,065
KWON: You're like my heart.

359
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,360
After all,

360
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:49,863
I owe you my life.

361
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,449
(sobbing)

362
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,076
(knocking on door)

363
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:57,454
Come in.

364
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:00,290
(Ms. Kwon sniffles)

365
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:06,588
Should I come back later?

366
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:11,468
It's okay. There's nothing you can't say
in front of Ms. Kwon.

367
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:13,637
Master.

368
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:21,978
What is it?

369
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,692
I have something to tell you, sir.

370
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,367
(elevator dings)

371
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,459
(suspenseful music)

372
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:00,600
BANKBOOK

373
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,644
CASE SUMMARY

374
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,778
There's no trace of resistance.

375
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:13,613
And I doubt the police made the bed.

376
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:17,117
(suspenseful music)

377
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:33,967
-Sleeping pills.
-(gasps)

378
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,219
Jeez, did I startle you?

379
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:38,430
Mr. Gong, please.

380
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:42,851
Our colleagues do call me the assassin.

381
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:45,437
-Assassin, my foot.
-I'm just joking.

382
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:47,856
What did the police say?

383
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:51,276
She was given sleeping pills
and was smothered with a pillow.

384
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,569
How humane, right?

385
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,696
That's why they think the husband did it.

386
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,823
Look at how he got his accounts in order.

387
00:26:56,906 --> 00:27:00,035
This is what people
who are about to commit suicide do.

388
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:03,163
My expertise of ten years tells me
that this is certainly a suicide case.

389
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:06,499
He didn't even scream
while he was falling.

390
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:10,128
Sir, why are you
digging into this case so much?

391
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:13,506
-Was he unconscious?
-Sorry?

392
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,259
Hitting the ground head first
must've covered up any head injuries.

393
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:18,845
The police have concluded it as suicide.

394
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:21,848
Mr. Gong, I will never commit suicide.

395
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,602
If the police claim that I killed myself,
you'd better look into it.

396
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,729
Don't let me get cremated.
Just bury my body.

397
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,022
An autopsy may be needed.

398
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:30,482
I prefer that too.

399
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:32,359
I'm too scared to get cremated.

400
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:34,361
Right. Did you get what I asked for?

401
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:37,364
Right. One second, sir.

402
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:41,701
Apparently, this brand is the best.

403
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:49,501
ARES
WARNING EXTREME DANGER

404
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:51,544
-TEAM LEADER LEE: He's a prosecutor?
-CHIEF JEONG: Yes, sir.

405
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,129
PERSONAL INFORMATION
SONG SUHYEON

406
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:56,216
He's the prosecution's nuisance.

407
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:58,426
He doesn't hesitate
to disobey his superiors if need be.

408
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,470
They can't touch him.

409
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:01,680
What a distinct character.

410
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:05,100
Seeing that he hasn't gotten sacked,
he must be the ace.

411
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,935
The prosecutors' office
is chaotic these days.

412
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:09,688
Those for and against the president
are at each other's throats.

413
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:12,482
If we provoke him…

414
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:14,818
The likes of him don't sit still if we do.

415
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,779
And we happened to provoke him.

416
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:21,241
Gosh. This is going to be a nuisance.

417
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:22,826
Do you think he'll be suspicious?

418
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:25,954
Kim Wonjoong and his wife

419
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:28,373
committed suicide
the very day he visited them.

420
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:32,627
If he's a competent prosecutor,
I'm sure he feels something is off.

421
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:36,005
Then I'll come up with a scenario.

422
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:42,178
-Mr. Lee!
-MANAGER LEE: Yes?

423
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,891
-TEAM LEADER LEE: Mr. Jeong.
-Yes, sir.

424
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,228
I may lose my position to you
in the near future.

425
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,149
You can be the new team leader.

426
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:56,234
I'm sorry, sir.

427
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:58,778
Forget the scenario.

428
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:02,949
It'll obviously look fishy
if Song Suhyeon dies as well.

429
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:04,951
Yes, sir.

430
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:09,038
-Did you call for me, sir?
-TEAM LEADER LEE: Yes.

431
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:11,833
Keep an eye on Song Suhyeon.

432
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,334
Sorry?

433
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,754
He seems to be a hotshot.

434
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:19,048
So we should play on his level,
don't you think?

435
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:24,262
Mr. Lee, can I entrust you with this task?

436
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:29,392
Of course, sir.
I'm actually a natural at field work.

437
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,067
Sir, do you really think he'll be okay?

438
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:41,654
-I don't think he's ready to--
-(book slams)

439
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,617
You're really pressing my buttons today.

440
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:47,786
I'm sorry, sir.

441
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:50,079
He's just keeping an eye on him.

442
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:52,123
Yes, sir.

443
00:29:58,004 --> 00:29:59,339
Mr. Seo.

444
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:02,425
This isn't right. He's not ready for this.

445
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:03,760
It's our team leader's command.

446
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,766
Still, he can't favor him
just because they're brothers--

447
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,187
Say that again.

448
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:16,022
I'm sorry, sir.

449
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:19,359
What about the daughter?
Did you follow up with her yet?

450
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:22,153
What is it?

451
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,989
I already gave my testimony yesterday.

452
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,282
You see…

453
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:29,702
It does look like
your father committed suicide

454
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:32,205
after murdering your mother.

455
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:36,084
But personally speaking,
I feel like his motive was too weak.

456
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:40,004
I heard your parents
loved each other dearly.

457
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,883
Yes. They did.

458
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:46,386
But he did struggle a lot.

459
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,639
He had been taking care of her
for the past 22 years.

460
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:53,101
So I understand the decision he made.

461
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:55,770
Ah.

462
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,356
I see.

463
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,442
(indistinct chatter)

464
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,908
MAN: He doesn't deserve to be buried
with our ancestors after what he did.

465
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,243
It'll only bring bad luck.

466
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:13,037
WOMAN: Be quiet. Seohee can hear you.

467
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,040
MAN: Let's end this funeral service today.

468
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:18,668
WOMAN: Goodness, can you please stop?

469
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:20,545
(solemn music)

470
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:21,671
SUHYEON: Are you okay?

471
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,431
I told you not to come.

472
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:39,689
I thought it was only right
to offer my condolences.

473
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:47,113
WOOSIN: <i>You know the real killer.</i>

474
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:48,698
Who is it?

475
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:53,119
(paper rustles)

476
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:58,625
(paper rustles)

477
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:05,965
(thuds)

478
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:07,967
(sighs)

479
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:10,803
She's going to regret this.

480
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:15,224
What is that?

481
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:16,601
The chairman's interview notes.

482
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:19,437
I've organized them. You just need
to show him and get his confirmation.

483
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:21,648
Thanks.

484
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:25,026
I'll get going then.
I'm going to leave after a shower.

485
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:26,903
Okay.

486
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:33,076
It's so hard to leave you behind.
(clicks tongue)

487
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,914
I should find you a good woman to marry.

488
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,168
You'll end up like Ms. Kwon.

489
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:43,294
Just leave.

490
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:46,339
Having no kids or a husband
has turned her into a cranky lady.

491
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:47,882
Do you think she's ever dated anyone?

492
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:48,925
-Maybe a divorcée?
-Go.

493
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,635
-Judging by her awful temper--
-Jeez.

494
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:51,761
DONGRIM: Oh, my goodness!

495
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:55,682
Why are you so surprised to see me?

496
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,642
Because you barged in here.

497
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:58,977
I understand.

498
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,479
I just caught you bad-mouthing me.

499
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,439
Did you hear that?

500
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:09,862
By the way, have you ever dated before?

501
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:12,323
-What kind of nonsense is that?
-I guess she has. Bye.

502
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:20,957
What brings you here?

503
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,626
(clears throat)
It's nothing much.

504
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:26,546
I've been too harsh on you.

505
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:27,964
Are you apologizing to me?

506
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,007
You wish.

507
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,759
Our beef has only troubled the master.

508
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,178
Let's just put an end to this.
You'll be leaving soon anyway.

509
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:37,306
Sure. I hope we get along
during my remaining time here.

510
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:40,018
Your remaining time here?

511
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:42,687
All right. Sure.

512
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:45,148
Right.

513
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:48,359
Shouldn't you say your goodbyes?

514
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,696
-Goodbyes?
-You haven't heard yet?

515
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:54,032
The chairman will be leaving.

516
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:57,910
I don't know what's gotten into Ms. Hyesoo
but they'll be going on a trip together.

517
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:02,081
(chuckles)

518
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,958
(Ms. Kwon humming)

519
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,299
(tense music)

520
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,689
Hey.

521
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:29,233
We need to talk.

522
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:30,693
Not now. Later.

523
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:32,195
Right now.

524
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:44,832
Why did you bring me here?
I'm a bit busy right now.

525
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:47,919
This helicopter
is a peculiarity of Haesong.

526
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:52,173
It is the only group that is affiliated
with the country's biggest arms dealer.

527
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:53,424
Were you aware of that?

528
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,551
If you're talking about ARES,
I roughly know about it.

529
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:57,845
(scoffs)
You're right.

530
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,056
MR. CHOI: They manufacture everything

531
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:02,475
from self-defense gadgets
to military arms.

532
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:05,686
Thanks to that, this mansion
has a cutting-edge security system.

533
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:09,732
All the employees have registered
their physical characteristics.

534
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:11,400
Yes, I did as well.

535
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:15,154
MR. CHOI: <i>It's more than just
security measures. They can identify you.</i>

536
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:18,324
<i>We all have our own serial numbers.</i>

537
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,576
They're watching us.

538
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,245
Our every single move.

539
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:25,039
MR. CHOI: From up there.

540
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:26,707
Do you get it?

541
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,877
(upbeat music)

542
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:36,592
(tense music)

543
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:42,723
MR. CHOI: <i>Biometrics AI.</i>

544
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:44,976
<i>The eye in the sky.</i>

545
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,187
<i>They can see our every move.</i>

546
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:50,314
<i>And I'm no exception.</i>

547
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:01,826
I'm so full.

548
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:12,920
AGENT PARK: That's Mr. Choi.

549
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,172
Who's that next to him?

550
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:17,508
Let me see their serial number.

551
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,971
It's Mr. Ha.

552
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:28,227
(inhales sharply)

553
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:31,564
Does this mean you want to
hop into the same boat with me?

554
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,942
You must be overly eager, seeing how
you're getting ahead of yourself.

555
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:35,943
Then why tell me this?

556
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:40,406
You think Chairman Kwon is responsible
for your father's murder, don't you?

557
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:42,491
What's your take?

558
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:44,035
He's a key suspect.

559
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:47,622
If the Adamas was the murder weapon,
then its owner must be the suspect.

560
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,333
We have the same target.
Chairman Kwon Jaekyu.

561
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,919
Don't be foolish.

562
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:54,879
Your father's death took place

563
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:56,839
before August of 2000,

564
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,507
before the statute of limitations
for murder was abolished.

565
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:02,011
Simply put, the statute of limitations
for his case has run out.

566
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:04,305
Chairman Kwon could confess to it

567
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:05,723
and still not get punished.

568
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:07,600
Yet you came here.

569
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:11,187
What are you scheming?

570
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:15,691
It hasn't run out yet.

571
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:19,153
-What?
-The chairman was overseas for some time.

572
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:21,072
There are still 18 days left.

573
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,783
Do you want to know something else?

574
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:26,494
My father's case from 22 years ago
was the only murder

575
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,914
that Lee Changwoo had ever committed.

576
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:32,750
Lee Changwoo.

577
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:35,127
Lee Changwoo and Chairman Kwon.

578
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:37,380
It's a fascinating combination.

579
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:40,299
The key to this case
is their point of contact.

580
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,637
I think we can help each other out.

581
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:47,848
You want me to help you steal the Adamas

582
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:50,226
so you can compare it
to the autopsy report?

583
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:53,646
If the murder weapon is a match,
I can request a retrial.

584
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:54,772
What if it doesn't?

585
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:56,607
-Then--
-Then…

586
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,736
our team's project will fall through.

587
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,864
We're up against a much more
powerful force than you think.

588
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,700
I can't help you
merely based on a suspicion.

589
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,913
(scoffs)
What exactly is this project?

590
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:13,708
You've been here for two years now
but still haven't completed it.

591
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,460
-Isn't it right to give up?
-Shut it.

592
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,838
Bring me proof
that it's linked to Chairman Kwon.

593
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,214
If not, just leave

594
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:23,342
before I end your brother's life.

595
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:31,976
SUHYEON: This is a taser.

596
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:33,894
Keep it with you just in case.

597
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:35,980
The precautions are written on the back.

598
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:37,440
Prosecutor Song.

599
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:41,777
Why are you doing this?

600
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:48,868
I understand.

601
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:52,663
I must look like a lunatic. But you see…

602
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:58,711
Your parents met untimely deaths

603
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,505
after I visited them.

604
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,092
You know very well
that they wouldn't have committed suicide.

605
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,470
Then who could it have been?

606
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:10,222
Who could've killed them?

607
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:17,188
My father's killer…

608
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,861
murdered your parents too.

609
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:26,697
That's my conclusion.

610
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:31,118
It sounds too far-fetched.

611
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,579
The murderer watched my parents
for the past 22 years

612
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:36,374
and only killed them
because you visited them?

613
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:38,584
That's right.

614
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:44,340
-And you know that.
-I do.

615
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:47,093
That's why I'm acting like this.

616
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:53,307
I'm afraid you'll die as well.

617
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:01,732
-Ms. Kim.
-A detective visited me again today.

618
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:05,194
I told him
that my parents committed suicide

619
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:09,031
in case their killer was watching me.

620
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:14,203
Well done.
It's better to be safe than sorry.

621
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:16,747
So you should stop here as well.

622
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,167
Or you could be in serious peril.

623
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:24,088
I'm sorry for barging into your house.

624
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:27,842
But I'll take care of this
from now on. Goodbye.

625
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,635
Ms. Kim Seohee.

626
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:38,144
You decided to dig into my father's case
from 22 years ago

627
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:40,980
because you knew
that your father gave false testimony.

628
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:44,275
You didn't turn a blind eye to it,
and I won't either.

629
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,654
It's my turn now.

630
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:52,366
I will catch them no matter what.

631
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,954
So let's do this together.

632
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,173
I saw him.

633
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,592
You saw him? Who?

634
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:10,885
The man.

635
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,721
The man who killed your father.

636
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:21,687
SEOHEE: <i>Your father...</i>

637
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,440
<i>went into that house alone.</i>

638
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,288
<i>I definitely saw him.</i>

639
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:43,375
YOUNG SEOHEE: Aren't you bored too?

640
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:47,338
When is Mom coming?

641
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:53,052
Don't you wish she'd get here quickly?

642
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,304
SEOHEE: <i>I was in the car as well.</i>

643
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:56,597
Should we go see her?

644
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,947
(suspenseful music)

645
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:33,259
-Dad.
-Yes? What is it?

646
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:38,514
What is it, Seohee?

647
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,058
I'm the witness.

648
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:52,486
Song Suhyeon is speaking with Kim Seohee.

649
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:54,738
Hey.

650
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:58,659
Seeing how he came all the way here,
I doubt he'll back away that easily.

651
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:00,995
He's desperate to get killed.

652
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:03,914
(scoffs)
All right. Keep an eye on him for now.

653
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:05,624
Bye.

654
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:11,880
The victim's son has met
with the witness' daughter.

655
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:14,425
I wonder how this will end.

656
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:18,137
What did Seohee say?

657
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:20,472
She seemed to believe that it was suicide.

658
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:22,641
I don't think
there's anything to worry about.

659
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:23,851
Okay.

660
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:27,187
Then we just need to take care
of the prosecutor.

661
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:29,106
-Yes, sir.
-(chuckles)

662
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:30,524
-Good work.
-Thank you, sir.

663
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:32,860
Mr. Ha.

664
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:39,283
He's not here. I was going to say goodbye.

665
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:52,504
He must've forgotten
to check with the chairman.

666
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:54,340
Who will help him once I'm gone?

667
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:03,849
How is it going?

668
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:07,519
(mouths)

669
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:17,529
(soft pop)

670
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:21,992
Hello, sir.

671
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:25,496
Aren't you Mr. Ha's pupil?

672
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:26,997
Yes, sir.

673
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:31,085
What were you doing in my office?

674
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:33,837
Come and go as you wish,
and you'll be in a pickle.

675
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:38,425
The interview notes. I've organized them
and put them on your desk.

676
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,302
We need your confirmation.

677
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:44,264
He must've been uninformed.

678
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,393
Sorry? What do you mean?

679
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:56,443
What exactly did your husband say again?

680
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:04,201
Have you gone crazy? Lower your voice.

681
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:07,204
"Lee Changwoo isn't the real killer,
and the murder weapon was the Adamas."

682
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:08,122
Is that what he said?

683
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:09,623
All that I know was in that letter.

684
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:12,084
So that's all he said?
Nothing about the killer?

685
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:13,669
-That's right.
-You're lying.

686
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:16,296
You know who the killer is.

687
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,006
Isn't it obvious?

688
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,633
-I don't know.
-Chairman Kwon.

689
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:23,011
It's him.

690
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:27,349
The owner of the Adamas.

691
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:31,687
I thought he was the real killer.

692
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:35,149
That's your reason?

693
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:36,775
If not, just say that I'm wrong.

694
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:39,319
Then I'll omit him
from my list of suspects.

695
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,321
-I don't know anything.
-You don't?

696
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:44,616
You're avoiding answering
a simple yes-or-no question,

697
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,285
meaning you're deliberately
hiding something.

698
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:48,328
And that means that
you expected me to ask you this

699
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:50,372
and that you understand the question.

700
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:55,586
You know the truth.

701
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:05,554
Ms. Eun.

702
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:08,766
The way you address someone
shows how close you are to them.

703
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:12,519
You've never addressed
the chairman as Father.

704
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:16,064
You always address him as the chairman,
and I sense animosity toward him.

705
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:18,734
You want him to get caught, don't you?

706
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:25,949
I don't know for sure
if he was the killer or not.

707
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:29,536
HYESOO: But this is what my husband said.

708
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:33,999
"My father killed someone with the Adamas.
And Lee Changwoo…

709
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:36,335
was the one who took the fall."

710
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:40,798
I knew it.

711
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:42,674
That's all I know.

712
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:45,928
The rest is up to you to find out,
so leave me out of this.

713
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:47,846
I'm afraid I can't do that.

714
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:50,432
What do you mean?

715
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:52,392
I happen to need your help with something.

716
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:54,645
-I refuse.
-Find out who recommended me.

717
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:56,647
It'll be easier for you to find out.

718
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:59,274
I need to know who it is to brace myself.

719
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:01,819
I need to know
why I was called here. Right?

720
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:03,070
I said no.

721
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:05,948
(suspenseful music)

722
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:10,369
I recorded everything

723
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,413
that you just said.

724
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:20,128
I wonder what the chairman
will think of this.

725
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:22,881
Start unpacking.

726
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:28,220
Do you think you can stop him?

727
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,352
Go to his office.

728
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,938
That's where the bomb will go off.

729
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,149
KWON: Yes, Hyunjo.

730
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:45,195
Ms. Yoon told me.

731
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:48,282
This is an extremely important matter.

732
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:51,493
Make sure this information doesn't leak.

733
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:53,871
(knocking on door)

734
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:01,712
KWON: I'll stop by your office soon.

735
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:04,840
There's something
I need to tell you as well.

736
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:06,466
HYUNJO: <i>Yes, Father.</i>

737
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:07,426
Bye.

738
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:18,937
HYUNJO: I'm sorry.

739
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:21,356
It was rude of me to keep you waiting.

740
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,817
No, sir. Not at all.

741
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:25,319
-(chuckles)
-(sighs)

742
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:28,405
How are you feeling?

743
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:30,949
My boys were a bit harsh, right?

744
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:33,410
Jeez, that must've really hurt.

745
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:37,122
It's all my fault, sir.

746
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:39,041
I'm deeply reflecting on myself.

747
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:41,376
This is how my father is.

748
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:45,130
If he senses arrogance in someone,
he doesn't hesitate to crush them.

749
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:46,715
(Hyunjo clicks tongue)

750
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:48,175
What can you do?

751
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:51,470
Please understand, okay?

752
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:54,139
(groans)

753
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:56,475
Yes, sir. Of course.

754
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:59,853
(both laugh)

755
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:02,814
What were we talking about again?

756
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:07,778
Right. It was about ARES
laying a golden egg--

757
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:09,738
Yes, I remember now.

758
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:11,990
Keep reading page seven.

759
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:14,576
Yes, sir.

760
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:19,081
"As for the United States--"

761
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:20,707
HYUNJO: No, no, no.

762
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:23,043
Just with your eyes.

763
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:27,214
I see. Yes, sir.

764
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:32,719
Listen to me as you read that.

765
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:36,640
Those are your top priorities
once you become President.

766
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:40,602
You'll be quite busy
assisting Haesong for the next five years.

767
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:44,064
You'd better brace yourself.

768
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,441
Yes, sir.

769
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:52,739
But how did you come up with such ideas?

770
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:56,618
You're incredibly revolutionary.

771
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:02,040
And we'll be together
throughout the revolution.

772
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:04,835
Here's to the beginning of your reign!

773
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:10,924
(both laughing)

774
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,551
I don't understand, sir.

775
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:14,928
You're pulling the plug on your memoir?

776
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:18,557
Hyesoo wanted to fly out
to our villa in Venice.

777
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:21,768
She's going to stay there this summer.

778
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:25,689
That was when
I was reminded of my late son.

779
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:28,900
He sure loved that place.

780
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:33,155
So I'm thinking about
making a trip there myself.

781
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,199
In that case,

782
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:39,703
we'll resume the memoir
after you return from your trip.

783
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:41,705
I'm afraid it won't be anytime soon.

784
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:43,832
Maybe next year.

785
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:47,711
I'm sad too.

786
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:52,049
I was counting down the days
until I could read my memoir.

787
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:56,136
Sir.

788
00:50:57,804 --> 00:50:59,014
Am I the problem?

789
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:01,600
(laughs)
No.

790
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:05,937
The presidential election would be over
by the time I return from Venice.

791
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:08,899
KWON: I'll be too busy with work.

792
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:11,234
There's something
I've always considered as my life's work.

793
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:13,737
I need to complete it.

794
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:16,990
It can't be helped. Please do understand.

795
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:23,455
MS. KWON: Pack enough water kimchi
and soy sauce marinated crab.

796
00:51:23,538 --> 00:51:25,540
He must eat well even when he's abroad.

797
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:27,000
Yes, ma'am.

798
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:33,423
I guess we're parting ways already.

799
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:36,301
It's so sad to say goodbye.

800
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:42,015
(cackling)

801
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:46,228
(cackling continues)

802
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,231
(door opens)

803
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:53,568
Mr. Ha?

804
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:57,614
You haven't left?

805
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:01,034
I wanted to say goodbye before leaving.

806
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:03,787
-Is something wrong?
-(sighs)

807
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:05,831
The chairman is pulling the plug
on the memoir.

808
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:07,124
(thuds)

809
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:10,418
Does that mean
I'll only get paid half the amount?

810
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:13,338
No, I'll give you the full amount.

811
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:15,590
You need it for your father's surgery.

812
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:17,968
Thank you.

813
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:20,846
The chairman must be very busy.

814
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:22,514
I heard he's preparing a new business.

815
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:24,015
A new business?

816
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:26,226
Who said that?

817
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:28,353
Ms. Yoon.

818
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:30,730
DONGRIM: <i>I didn't know she was deaf.</i>

819
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:33,483
<i>But I know sign language
because of my dad.</i>

820
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:37,529
KWON: How is it going?

821
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:53,295
(soft pop)

822
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:55,881
DONGRIM:
<i>Hwang Byungchul from New Future Party</i>

823
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:57,465
<i>and Haesong must be doing something.</i>

824
00:52:57,549 --> 00:53:00,635
That geezer promised to provide the police
with arms if he becomes President.

825
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:01,970
Automatic pistols.

826
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:05,724
-Are you sure?
-I was there.

827
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:12,397
Automatic pistols?

828
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:15,108
Does that mean
they'll get rid of blank ammunition?

829
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:19,905
Strengthening governmental power?

830
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:22,199
But why Haesong?

831
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:26,536
MR. CHOI:
This is a peculiarity of Haesong.

832
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:30,040
It is the only group that is affiliated
with the country's biggest arms dealer.

833
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:35,253
There's something
I've always considered as my life's work.

834
00:53:35,837 --> 00:53:37,464
I need to complete it.

835
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:40,675
Weapons business.

836
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:44,304
You're right. He's planning to slowly
make firearms accessible to all.

837
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:45,263
Isn't that crazy?

838
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:47,724
Everyone will purchase one for themselves.

839
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:50,685
Everyone is so hot-tempered
so massacres are just waiting to happen.

840
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:53,563
I bet you'll buy one too and shoot me.

841
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:02,572
He's not listening. He never listens.

842
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:03,490
Bye.

843
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:20,590
(chuckles)
What should we do?

844
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:23,009
That was supposed to be confidential.

845
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:30,517
Well, I wasn't trying to spy on you.

846
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,894
I just saw you two.

847
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:37,232
And I happen to know sign language.

848
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:39,401
I'm sorry, sir.

849
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:42,362
It's okay, Dongrim.

850
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:45,198
We still told him even though
you found out accidentally.

851
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:48,201
By the way, shouldn't you get going now?

852
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:50,120
Right.

853
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:53,623
Sir, thank you for everything.

854
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:55,959
We'll be on our way then.

855
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:01,881
No.

856
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:05,593
This isn't something
to brush off that easily.

857
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:07,721
Sorry?

858
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:10,932
You found out
about Haesong supporting Candidate Hwang

859
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:12,892
and the firearms.

860
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:17,147
If word gets out,
this will critically affect the election.

861
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:18,982
It'll be irreparable.

862
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:24,446
You don't need to worry about that.
We will both be tight-lipped about it.

863
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:26,948
Yes, sir. I promise.

864
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:28,158
You promise?

865
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:31,036
How naive.

866
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:33,663
Verbal promises

867
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:36,583
are only valid among friends.

868
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:39,836
Then what would you like us to do?

869
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:42,130
Knowing too much is a sin.

870
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:46,551
(ominous music)

871
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:50,764
I'm still thinking…

872
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:54,726
about what to do with you.

873
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:04,652
(suspenseful music)

874
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:22,170
I'm afraid you'll have to die.

875
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:25,006
(tense music)

876
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:42,982
(chuckles)

877
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:44,651
I'm just joking.

878
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:48,905
KWON: Let's do this.

879
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:52,534
You are forbidden from leaving this house

880
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:55,870
until the presidential election is over.

881
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:00,375
(sighs)

882
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:11,177
DONGRIM: "I'm afraid you'll have to die."

883
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:13,888
Gosh, I almost peed my pants.

884
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:16,933
How could he say such a frightening thing
in a sophisticated manner?

885
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:19,519
He should've just sworn at us.
That was terrifying.

886
00:57:20,019 --> 00:57:21,312
Anyway, you heard him, right?

887
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:23,982
We can only leave
once the election comes to an end.

888
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:26,568
So don't tell me to go home anymore.

889
00:57:26,651 --> 00:57:28,069
I can't even if I want to.

890
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:36,786
What should I do with him?

891
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:39,456
SUHYEON: <i>Do I know you?</i>

892
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:42,542
You haven't called once,
so I thought you were dead.

893
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:44,544
I called you yesterday.

894
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:47,422
You did? Oh, was that you?

895
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:49,340
I didn't recognize the number,
so I thought it was a spam call.

896
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:52,343
Where in the world are you?

897
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:53,845
Are you having that much fun?

898
00:57:53,928 --> 00:57:55,346
It's pretty much heaven here.

899
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:57,849
I should keep traveling
until the day I die.

900
00:57:58,766 --> 00:57:59,767
How are you?

901
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:02,270
Is this really you?

902
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:04,063
You're asking me how I'm doing?

903
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:07,192
By the way, you know what?

904
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,406
(clicks tongue)
Never mind.

905
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:15,825
I'm busy. Bye.

906
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:17,494
How did it go?

907
00:58:18,244 --> 00:58:20,163
It's finished, sir.

908
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:21,789
Thank you.

909
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:29,339
(breathes deeply)

910
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:33,426
(sighs heavily)

911
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:39,766
(solemn music)

912
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:46,272
(knocking on door)

913
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:48,274
-Are you in?
-Police.

914
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:50,318
-(knocking continues)
-Honey.

915
00:58:50,401 --> 00:58:52,195
(breathes deeply)

916
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:54,989
Seohee, do you remember what I told you?

917
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:58,785
You didn't see anything that night, okay?

918
00:58:58,910 --> 00:58:59,827
YOUNG SEOHEE: Okay.

919
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:02,914
Good. What a good girl.

920
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:06,876
Dad.

921
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:09,254
(door opens)

922
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:23,685
That's him.

923
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:26,229
He's the man I saw that day.

924
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:28,773
When the police came to our house,

925
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:31,192
my dad told them
that he was the one who saw him.

926
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:39,492
He probably did that to protect you.

927
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:44,080
What's our next move?

928
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:45,999
I know someone...

929
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:49,419
who might know this man.

930
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:03,891
(car engine starts)

931
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:09,731
(suspenseful music)

932
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:12,108
MS. LEE: I'm at the funeral home.

933
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:14,819
That reporter's parents passed away.

934
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:23,161
Sir.

935
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:28,458
Are you sure?
Someone's tailing Song Suhyeon?

936
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:32,170
It's them.

937
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:35,840
MS. KWON: You're not going on that trip?

938
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:38,217
No, it just turned out that way.

939
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:40,720
I don't see the need to do that, sir.

940
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:42,305
What can I do?

941
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:46,184
It's not like I can bury Mr. Ha
and his pupil somewhere.

942
01:00:46,684 --> 01:00:49,937
I'll have to keep them here
until the election is over.

943
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:52,273
In the meantime,

944
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:56,569
I can finish my memoir.

945
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:07,372
(grunting, panting)

946
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:10,583
(screams)

947
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,960
How dare you?

948
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:15,838
What gives you the right?

949
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:18,383
How dare you control my master?

950
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:21,135
That little scumbag!

951
01:01:21,219 --> 01:01:23,680
(growling)

952
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:25,306
I ought to kill him!

953
01:01:25,598 --> 01:01:27,892
That rat deserves to die!

954
01:01:27,975 --> 01:01:33,356
(panting)

955
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:41,614
(tense music)

956
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:49,163
MS. KWON: "The letter you sent me."

957
01:01:56,754 --> 01:01:58,923
(tense music continues)

958
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:05,972
MR. CHOI: What did you say?

959
01:02:06,597 --> 01:02:09,684
Did you know that
they are aiming to legalize firearms?

960
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:12,186
(scoffs)
What are you?

961
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:14,230
How much do you know?

962
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:16,941
Once Candidate Hwang gets elected,
they'll begin that project.

963
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:19,777
You'll have to complete your mission
before the election,

964
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:21,362
but you're running out of time.

965
01:02:23,322 --> 01:02:25,575
I won't let that happen.
We'll stop him at all costs.

966
01:02:25,658 --> 01:02:26,826
Of course you should.

967
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:30,163
That's why we should make our move
on Chairman Kwon.

968
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:34,625
Do you think it'll all be over
once you catch him?

969
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:37,670
What did he do? What can you prove?

970
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:41,007
Do you think the police
and the prosecution failed to catch him

971
01:02:41,215 --> 01:02:43,009
because we were incompetent?

972
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:46,721
I see. So that's your conclusion?
You can't catch him?

973
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:48,097
Don't be reckless.

974
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:50,224
You don't know Haesong's true face.

975
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:52,268
Legalizing firearms?

976
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:54,353
That's a cakewalk for them.

977
01:02:54,645 --> 01:02:56,773
They've won over
the media and politics already.

978
01:02:57,982 --> 01:03:00,860
Their only hurdle is public opinion.

979
01:03:01,652 --> 01:03:04,739
Haesong will do everything they can
to win over the public.

980
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:07,366
They won't hesitate
to subject our society to chaos.

981
01:03:07,575 --> 01:03:09,285
They'll make it necessary for civilians

982
01:03:09,911 --> 01:03:11,829
to carry a gun to the grocery store.

983
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:17,293
What is it?
Do you find it hard to believe?

984
01:03:17,376 --> 01:03:20,463
Not at all.
This is all possible for those bastards.

985
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:24,050
Bastards?

986
01:03:25,593 --> 01:03:27,136
It's not just Chairman Kwon?

987
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:32,683
The chairman doesn't get blood
on his own hands.

988
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:34,101
He unleashes his hounds.

989
01:03:34,602 --> 01:03:36,771
If we fail to catch those bastards,

990
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:38,731
we'll never get to the chairman.

991
01:03:39,398 --> 01:03:41,359
So that's why you've gone undercover.

992
01:03:42,568 --> 01:03:44,487
This is why you've been trying
to win their trust.

993
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:47,198
This is the two-year-long project
that you've been carrying out.

994
01:03:49,575 --> 01:03:53,037
Mr. Choi, you're trying to
get into that team, aren't you?

995
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:59,502
(sighs)
Team A.

996
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:04,090
(ominous music)

997
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:12,056
MR. CHOI:
<i>Haesong's professional troubleshooters.</i>

998
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:14,517
<i>No one ever survived.</i>

999
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:18,604
A civilian like you should back off.
You could easily get killed.

1000
01:04:21,232 --> 01:04:23,025
WOOSIN: Team A.

1001
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:26,654
We need to get to them
to eventually catch the chairman

1002
01:04:27,071 --> 01:04:29,365
since the latter
doesn't get his hands dirty.

1003
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:32,952
But my father's case is different.

1004
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:36,789
It's directly linked to the chairman.

1005
01:04:37,582 --> 01:04:39,208
-What's your proof?
-I have none.

1006
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:40,376
(Mr. Choi scoffs)

1007
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:42,753
However…

1008
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:46,591
someone did testify.

1009
01:04:47,925 --> 01:04:50,386
HYESOO: <i>I don't know for sure
if he was the killer or not.</i>

1010
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:54,181
<i>But this is what my husband said.</i>

1011
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:56,350
Eun Hyesoo?

1012
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:00,354
HYESOO:
<i>"My father killed someone with the Adamas.</i>

1013
01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:04,066
<i>And Lee Changwoo was the one
who took the fall."</i>

1014
01:05:05,943 --> 01:05:07,945
(tense music)

1015
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:20,583
(metal screeching)

1016
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:21,500
(music stops)

1017
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:26,380
CHANGWOO: So what if he's a prosecutor?
I'm not at his beck and call.

1018
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:49,570
(door closes)

1019
01:05:50,404 --> 01:05:52,031
(door lock rattles)

1020
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:04,085
I'm Prosecutor Song Suhyeon from
the Central District Prosecutors' Office.

1021
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:07,630
Hello, sir.

1022
01:06:09,048 --> 01:06:11,634
Why did you want to see me?

1023
01:06:12,677 --> 01:06:14,303
I need your help, Mr. Lee.

1024
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:19,058
My help?

1025
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:24,271
Let's see.

1026
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:28,401
I'm working on a case.

1027
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:31,195
And I think you may recognize the suspect.

1028
01:06:32,947 --> 01:06:36,701
That's strange. I've cut ties with society
after being incarcerated.

1029
01:06:37,952 --> 01:06:38,995
It's this man.

1030
01:06:44,875 --> 01:06:46,210
Do you recognize him?

1031
01:06:50,631 --> 01:06:52,091
No, I don't.

1032
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:55,219
You don't?

1033
01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:57,388
CHANGWOO: No, sir.

1034
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:03,310
Then do you recognize me?
We've met before.

1035
01:07:13,821 --> 01:07:14,989
I'm not sure.

1036
01:07:16,407 --> 01:07:18,034
I don't quite remember.

1037
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:20,995
Twenty-two years is a long time.

1038
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:24,707
But the memory is still vivid for me.

1039
01:07:28,627 --> 01:07:31,714
You killed my father.

1040
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:36,177
(somber music)

1041
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:40,681
It's good to see you again.

1042
01:07:44,518 --> 01:07:46,228
-REPORTER 1: <i>Let's go!</i>
-REPORTER 2: <i>They're coming out!</i>

1043
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:48,731
-REPORTER 3: Did you act alone?
-REPORTER 4: Let's go.

1044
01:07:48,814 --> 01:07:52,109
REPORTER 5:
What was the motive for your murder?

1045
01:07:52,193 --> 01:07:54,737
Please tell us your motive!

1046
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:58,199
YOUNG SUHYEON:
You murderer! Remember my face!

1047
01:07:58,324 --> 01:08:01,035
Because I'll make you pay!

1048
01:08:02,119 --> 01:08:03,370
POLICE: Get him away from here!

1049
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:05,956
You murderer!

1050
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,584
(camera shutters clicking)

1051
01:08:14,048 --> 01:08:15,299
All right.

1052
01:08:16,467 --> 01:08:17,760
Let's get back to the subject.

1053
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:19,929
Who is this?

1054
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:23,724
I don't know.

1055
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:27,269
Then I'll change the question.

1056
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:30,356
Who took the murder weapon?

1057
01:08:32,983 --> 01:08:34,151
Why would you ask me that?

1058
01:08:34,235 --> 01:08:35,277
You don't know that either?

1059
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:40,741
I don't. I really don't know.

1060
01:08:41,867 --> 01:08:43,202
Are you sure he didn't take it?

1061
01:08:45,037 --> 01:08:47,331
No, sir. I don't know him.

1062
01:08:47,414 --> 01:08:50,376
This case occurred 22 years ago,
and I already confessed to it.

1063
01:08:50,459 --> 01:08:52,253
It was a false confession.

1064
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:55,714
Why would I…

1065
01:08:58,551 --> 01:08:59,510
do that?

1066
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:05,266
Because you wanted
to protect this bastard!

1067
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:06,892
Damn it!

1068
01:09:07,351 --> 01:09:08,727
(loud clank)

1069
01:09:10,354 --> 01:09:12,273
Because he was an accomplice!

1070
01:09:19,321 --> 01:09:21,657
(breathes heavily)

1071
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:24,827
(thuds)

1072
01:09:24,910 --> 01:09:27,037
(closing theme music)

1073
01:09:45,639 --> 01:09:46,891
HYESOO: <i>You must've forgotten…</i>

1074
01:09:46,974 --> 01:09:48,017
SECURITY CONTROL ROOM

1075
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:49,643
<i>…that you threatened me.</i>

1076
01:09:49,727 --> 01:09:52,146
SEOHEE: <i>I should go into the tiger's den
if I want to catch it.</i>

1077
01:09:52,229 --> 01:09:54,732
I refuse to tremble in fear,
not knowing who it is.

1078
01:09:55,316 --> 01:09:57,902
I'll reveal everything
you're hiding one by one.

1079
01:09:58,652 --> 01:10:01,780
You should hurry
if you want to catch the real killer.

1080
01:10:02,364 --> 01:10:05,034
A composite sketch artist?
It was the daughter.

1081
01:10:05,743 --> 01:10:07,995
All right, let's do this.

1082
01:10:08,662 --> 01:10:11,207
WOOSIN: <i>I'm going to start a fire today.</i>
