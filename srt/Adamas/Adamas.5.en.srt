00:00:00,086 --> 00:00:05,960
ADAMAS

00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,420
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,960
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,420
OPERATOR: <i>The fire extinguishing system
is being activated.</i>

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,800
(suspenseful music)

6
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,940
Found it.

7
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:45,820
(panting)

8
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,610
Stop the system immediately.

9
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,080
Someone's still in there.
(panting)

10
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,950
AGENT KIM: <i>Stop the system.</i>

11
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,660
<i>Mr. Ha is still in the house.</i>

12
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:55,410
-Shut it down!
-Yes, sir.

13
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,090
(hissing stops)

14
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:03,800
Mr. Ha!

15
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,590
Mr. Ha.

16
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,590
-MR. CHOI: Mr. Ha!
-DONGRIM: Mr. Ha!

17
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,510
MR. CHOI: What happened?

18
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,600
-Call a doctor!
-DONGRIM: Mr. Ha!

19
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,760
Open your eyes!

20
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:13,850
Move.

21
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,810
Mr. Ha.

22
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,440
Mr. Ha, wake up!

23
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,610
MR. CHOI: What happened?
Where's the doctor?

24
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:24,820
AGENT: He's on his way.

25
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,170
(ominous music)

26
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,430
(door lock clicks)

27
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,180
(shower running)

28
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,580
(tense music)

29
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,880
(suspenseful music)

30
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,180
(grunts)

31
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:41,560
(grunting continues)

32
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,490
(train whooshing)

33
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,250
AT 11 TONIGHT. UNDER THE SOUTHERN PIER
OF DANGSAN RAILWAY BRIDGE

34
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:49,630
(foreboding music)

35
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,550
(music fades)

36
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,220
Have I been stood up?

37
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,020
Ms. Kim.

38
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,320
Why are you here?

39
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,950
I sent that text.

40
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,040
What do you mean?

41
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,170
MS. LEE: I got him.

42
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,380
He has no fingerprints.

43
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,510
It won't be easy to identify him.

44
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,380
And Song Suhyeon?

45
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,140
Seohee will take care of him.

46
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,560
I lured you to this open area

47
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,310
to see if anyone was tailing you.
You're all clear.

48
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,900
Hold on. Are you saying I was your bait?

49
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,650
-It was simply a mission.
-What mission?

50
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,280
Are you kidding me?

51
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,150
I told you I visited Lee Changwoo
on purpose. It was a success.

52
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,320
A success?

53
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,950
You need to be more detailed than that.

54
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:03,160
Stop making me angry
by talking so vaguely!

55
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,210
I got him.

56
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,870
Who exactly?

57
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,630
The man who was tailing you.

58
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,130
The one who tried to kill me. I got him.

59
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,760
Unbelievable.

60
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,970
Don't be too offended. I was bait as well.

61
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,220
You too? Then who was the mastermind?

62
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,480
I'd like to introduce you to some people.

63
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,780
(tense music)

64
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:45,910
What are you looking at?

65
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,330
God, you're making me see red.

66
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:54,380
Who are you exactly? Tell me!

67
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,800
Come with me if you want to find out.

68
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,950
Are you sure
we don't need to go to the hospital?

69
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:23,740
I'm okay.

70
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:26,120
The doctor who came by said I was fine.

71
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,410
I can't believe that woman, Ms. Kwon.
She's frightening.

72
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,540
How could she not send you to the hospital
in a life-and-death situation?

73
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,540
(chuckles)

74
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,170
Did you forget?

75
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:39,300
They're holding us hostage
until the election is over.

76
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,970
(knocking on door)

77
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,090
(door opens)

78
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,060
(door closes)

79
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:55,770
I have a few questions to ask you
as the chief of security.

80
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,480
Sure.

81
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:02,030
Dongrim, can you get me a warm cup of tea?

82
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,070
Okay.

83
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:12,620
(door opens, closes)

84
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,250
So?

85
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,590
Did you find the Adamas?

86
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,420
No.

87
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:22,010
It was all in vain.
Everything we did was for nothing.

88
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,640
But…

89
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,140
I think I found it.

90
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,640
You found it?

91
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,350
The halogen gas…

92
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:36,480
was being sucked into the ceiling.

93
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,530
The Adamas… is up there.

94
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,610
-Are you sure?
-Yes, 100%.

95
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,910
I finally realized...

96
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:51,410
why the carpet was placed there.

97
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,420
WOOSIN: <i>It was the same pattern</i>

98
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
<i>and design…</i>

99
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:01,630
(audience applauding)

100
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,630
<i>…as the carpet that was used
on the day the Adamas</i>

101
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,510
<i>was first revealed.</i>

102
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,720
<i>That's why</i>

103
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,560
<i>he has the same carpet in his office.</i>

104
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,440
<i>He just can't let go
of the euphoria he felt that day.</i>

105
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:18,650
<i>As someone who enjoys
having ultimate power,</i>

106
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,610
<i>that day must've felt like
his coronation ceremony.</i>

107
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,950
<i>The Adamas is his crown.</i>

108
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,120
(sighs)

109
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,210
Now that we know where it is,

110
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,840
we just need to set a date
and carry it out.

111
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,420
You're going to get back at it
despite almost getting killed today?

112
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,220
I knew what I was getting myself into.

113
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,470
But let's make it quick.

114
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,180
Like Ms. Yoon today,

115
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:54,140
I don't like it when others are put
in danger because of me.

116
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:57,230
That's rich coming from someone
who's going to steal the Adamas.

117
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,650
Lighten up. Everyone is safe.

118
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,740
There's something that bothers me.

119
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:09,070
I lost the voice recorder.

120
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:11,530
(Dongrim sighs)

121
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,250
What should I do?

122
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,630
This is driving me crazy.

123
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,430
MS. KWON: Mr. Ha sure is one-of-a-kind.

124
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:35,390
He didn't hesitate to go back
into the house like a true man.

125
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:38,850
Treat him well. He's your savior.

126
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:43,520
What is it?

127
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:47,990
(signing)
You knew I was at the heliport.

128
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:52,370
Were you really trying to kill him?

129
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,580
Are you worried about him

130
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,750
or your plan falling through?

131
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:01,330
I heard you were the one
who recommended him to our master.

132
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,460
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

133
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,630
(dramatic music)

134
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,800
Was it because of Ms. Hyesoo?

135
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,300
Because he resembles Mr. Minjo?

136
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,890
I can see right through you.

137
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,820
Do you think

138
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,780
Hyesoo will have an affair with him?

139
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,700
Do you think she will get a divorce?

140
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:37,330
(clicks tongue)
Jeez, you're such an idiot.

141
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:52,930
(foreboding music)

142
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,480
(sniffles)

143
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:07,860
(sighs)

144
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,720
(sniffles, sighs)

145
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:53,030
(panting)

146
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,700
(clicking tongue)

147
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:05,580
What will you do about this situation?

148
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,710
They even got Mr. Lee's composite sketch.

149
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:14,090
Father decided to retire,

150
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,890
yet you can't wrap up such an old case.

151
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:20,680
Do you think he'll let
someone like you take over? Do you?

152
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,980
Haesong's 80th-anniversary ceremony
is just around the corner.

153
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,070
What was his name? Song Suhyeon?

154
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,690
Will you let that lousy prosecutor
ruin everything for you?

155
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:36,660
All of this happened
because you trusted Mr. Lee.

156
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,200
Hyunjo.

157
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:48,670
Kwon Hyunjo.

158
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:50,920
You need to do it.

159
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,710
Put an end to this once and for all.

160
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,800
Okay?

161
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,510
(breathes heavily)

162
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:07,440
(line ringing)

163
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:08,850
Ms. Jang.

164
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,610
I have a discreet favor to ask of you.

165
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:46,270
SUHYEON: That took long enough.
Can I take this off now?

166
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,190
(tense music)

167
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:56,860
Who are you guys?

168
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,990
-They're--
-I wasn't asking you.

169
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,120
I was a bit rude
for our first encounter, wasn't I?

170
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,160
Are you the head here?

171
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,840
It must've been an uncomfortable trip.
But please do understand.

172
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,420
I couldn't risk exposing
our safe house to a stranger.

173
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:19,300
That's enough.
Let's just introduce ourselves.

174
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,140
Sure.

175
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:25,770
Prosecutor Song Suhyeon,
I'm Kang Hyukpil of the SIH.

176
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,640
Special Investigations Headquarters?

177
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,400
(gasps)

178
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,240
(breathing heavily)
Dongrim.

179
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,450
Mr. Ha.

180
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,040
Please forgive me.

181
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:01,750
For what?

182
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,880
(Dongrim sniffling)

183
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,170
Are you crying?

184
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,470
WOOSIN: So you stole it?

185
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:11,930
Yes,

186
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,600
when you were unconscious.

187
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,560
Why?

188
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,190
Lee Dongrim.

189
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,360
So I could give it to Ms. Kwon.

190
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:25,900
What?

191
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,480
She wanted me to find out
what you were up to.

192
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,900
-(sighs)
-And I agreed to help her.

193
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:34,450
She said she'd let me leave this place
if I helped her.

194
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,490
I had no choice.

195
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,240
She was lying.

196
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:41,410
No one leaves
without the chairman's permission.

197
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,290
Then what should I do? I need to leave.

198
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:48,000
But you didn't leave
when I told you to, so why?

199
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,590
My dad might pass away.

200
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,470
What do you mean?

201
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,300
He may be in need...

202
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:59,020
of an urgent liver transplant.

203
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,430
But he can't get one without me.

204
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:04,060
I've been taking supplements

205
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,560
and working out regularly.

206
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,690
I've been taking great care of my health.

207
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,030
You're…

208
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,610
his donor, aren't you?

209
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:21,000
Mr. Ha, please help me.

210
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,710
I need to leave this house, so please.

211
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,130
(somber music)

212
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:53,570
Mr. Kwon picked them out himself.

213
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:56,160
Aren't they just perfect
for tonight's dinner?

214
00:16:56,570 --> 00:17:00,990
Every single one is so luxurious.

215
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,670
This one looks good.

216
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:08,540
Do you like it? Will you go with this one?

217
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,460
Sure.

218
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,010
MS. OH: This one.

219
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:50,380
PUT IT ON THIS EVENING
I CAN'T WAIT

220
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,460
(mellow music)

221
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,940
He's got a cute side, that one.

222
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,770
-(knocking on door)
-Come in.

223
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,270
(door opens)

224
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,860
(heels clacking)

225
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:16,780
(door closes)

226
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,450
Visiting me at this hour?

227
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,250
What do you want?

228
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:38,550
I've decided on the D-day.

229
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,590
When is it?

230
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,180
Tonight.

231
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:48,390
-Why are you rushing it?
-What's the point of delaying it?

232
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,480
It's going to be easier than we thought.

233
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,560
How so?

234
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:54,860
You weren't certain
the Adamas was here, were you?

235
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,650
-Why not?
-Because there was no security system.

236
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,610
Exactly. Had there been
a cutting edge security system

237
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,410
inside the mansion as well,

238
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,120
then you would've known about it.

239
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,910
The door to Kwon Minjo's room,
which was locked,

240
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,290
had a keyhole. Old school.

241
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:12,250
I'm sure the Adamas' security system
isn't that strict either.

242
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,630
So that's why you think it'll be easy?
That's hard to believe.

243
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:19,300
Look at the furniture arrangement
in the chairman's office. It's obvious.

244
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:23,220
The center of that big room is empty

245
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,760
solely for him to appreciate the Adamas.

246
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,180
He's very sensitive to visual stimuli.

247
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,640
WOOSIN: <i>And that's proven
by how he exhibits</i>

248
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:33,100
<i>his priceless artworks
instead of storing them somewhere.</i>

249
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:36,070
Plus, he makes his judgments

250
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,320
based on what he's seen.

251
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,700
He looks like a decent guy.

252
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,610
What do you think?

253
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,780
Isn't it splendid yet graceful?

254
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:48,660
Imagine a first date.

255
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:52,670
Someone who's sensitive to hearing
will remember conversations the most.

256
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,540
Someone who's sensitive to smells
will remember an individual's scent.

257
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:59,630
And someone who's sensitive to visuals
will remember their clothing or smile.

258
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:01,840
The chairman values what he sees.

259
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:05,720
And his office is the most ideal place
where he can appreciate the Adamas.

260
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,430
Fine. That's all great.

261
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:12,940
But how do we lower it from the ceiling?

262
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,230
He likes having ultimate power.

263
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,320
Where does the king reside?

264
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,780
On the throne.

265
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,950
It's on his desk.

266
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,410
So there must be a switch there?

267
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,160
Do you want to bet?

268
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,750
If it's not a simple switch,
then we may need a passcode.

269
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,750
That's even better.

270
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:38,540
WOOSIN: <i>It'll be easy to compile the
combination once we find out the numbers.</i>

271
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,340
<i>We should be able to specify
the first digit.</i>

272
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:44,090
<i>The first and second digits
have a psychological link.</i>

273
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:47,140
I have more than enough information
when it comes to him.

274
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,560
Okay. Let me report this to headquarters.

275
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,730
They're dealing with an issue
at the moment.

276
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,480
What issue?

277
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:56,940
Your brother…

278
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,980
is at the SIH safe house.

279
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:13,370
He's as stubborn as a mule.
I wish I could give him a good beating.

280
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,250
Why must I join hands with you?

281
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,380
(scoffs)

282
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:26,800
I explained it to you all night long.

283
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,300
Should I do it all over again?

284
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:31,560
Okay. So you know me through Woosin,

285
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,350
and you know Ms. Kim through me.

286
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:36,310
Then you learned
of her parents' mysterious deaths.

287
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:38,020
Then you noticed someone tailing me,

288
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,820
so you told her the truth
and asked her for help. I get all that.

289
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,940
But I'm confused
about what comes after that.

290
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,690
Lee Changwoo is innocent?

291
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,660
That's why you're getting involved?

292
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:52,330
Correct. That's when
we struck a deal with your brother.

293
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:55,000
That lunatic…

294
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,040
He's not on a trip but instead at that
mansion to write the chairman's memoir?

295
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,000
He's stealing what? The Adamas?
(scoffs)

296
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,130
So what if that is the murder weapon?
The case is 22 years old.

297
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,510
(Suhyeon laughs)
Really…

298
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:15,350
The SIH reached out to him
and offered to catch our father's killer?

299
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:19,400
Look, Mr. Kang. What is your true motive?

300
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,650
You didn't tell me that last night.
What is it?

301
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,320
Answer me!

302
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:31,320
What an unbelievable bastard.

303
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,620
Kwon Jaekyu.

304
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:42,170
Your brother thinks he was the killer.

305
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,500
If the Adamas is indeed
the murder weapon that disappeared,

306
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:48,340
then Chairman Kwon has to be involved.

307
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,260
Ah.
(fingers snap)

308
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:56,520
But that's what Woosin thinks.
What about you guys?

309
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,560
You couldn't have been persuaded
by just that.

310
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:02,060
We have a credible testimony.

311
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:04,020
-Testimony?
-HYUKPIL: An audio recording.

312
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:07,110
Haesong's daughter-in-law.

313
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:12,700
That's why we thought he must be involved.

314
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:16,490
(clicks tongue)

315
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,580
I guess it's safe to say
that we're on the same page.

316
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,460
I hope we get along.

317
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,630
You freaking wish.

318
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:37,430
(epic music)

319
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,930
SUHYEON: That lunatic!

320
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:46,860
SEOHEE: What's wrong?

321
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:48,860
Prosecutor Song.

322
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,740
SUHYEON: Move.

323
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:59,450
I was told not to let you go outside, sir.

324
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,540
Let me go.

325
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,460
Cut that nonsense and move aside.

326
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,500
I can't, sir.

327
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:06,460
(scoffs)
Open the door.

328
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,710
Don't do this. Calm down!

329
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,420
Calm down? How can I when my brother
is going to steal the Adamas?

330
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,430
He could end up behind bars.

331
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:16,220
God, that idiot!

332
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,260
He must be aware of that.

333
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,970
I'm sure he has thought this through.

334
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,730
Do you really think he has?

335
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:23,390
He didn't even tell me about this!

336
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,770
Will you seriously keep this up?

337
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,940
They explained it to you
numerous times yesterday.

338
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:31,110
I can't believe them. No, I refuse to.

339
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,570
Chairman Kwon is the killer?
Don't make me laugh.

340
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,320
Then who was that man you saw?

341
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,120
That's something I must find out!

342
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,450
Don't you get it?

343
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,450
They're using Woosin.

344
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,040
They don't care who the real killer is.

345
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,710
They just want to tie
the chairman to this.

346
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:48,500
But that idiot has no idea
and is inside that mansion!

347
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:51,840
I can involve anyone
in order to catch the real culprit,

348
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,010
not just Chairman Kwon.

349
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:57,930
I won't hesitate to join hands
with anyone, not just the SIH!

350
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:03,600
Are you worried about your brother?

351
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:08,060
That's not the point.
I will catch the killer at all costs.

352
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:09,770
So…

353
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,570
Hey, step aside.

354
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,740
I told you to move. Open the door.

355
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,160
Open the door!

356
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:22,660
Darn it.

357
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,210
Blood?

358
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:30,880
(scoffs)
Hey. You hit me first, okay?

359
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,010
Jeez.

360
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,890
Prosecutor Song!

361
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:45,230
(gunshot)

362
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,940
MR. CHOI: They'll suspect us
if we're always together.

363
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,860
I said I was teaching you how to hunt,
so I need to make it look like I am.

364
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,610
Are we there yet?

365
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,570
We're almost there.

366
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,620
By the way,
will you be able to persuade him?

367
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,740
Your brother had a fit all night

368
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:05,830
even though they explained everything.

369
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,750
He'll understand once I talk to him.

370
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:11,170
Jeez.

371
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:14,050
(panting)

372
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:27,850
We're here.

373
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:41,410
(Woosin sighs)

374
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,040
(pants)
A satellite phone.

375
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,380
Must you go this far?

376
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:09,770
(groans)
Darn it! That hurts so much.

377
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:11,560
Sir.

378
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:13,020
Tonight is D-day?

379
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:16,480
I'm not sure.
We've encountered something unexpected.

380
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:18,690
Unexpected? Is it bad?

381
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,110
HYUKPIL: <i>It's actually to our advantage.</i>

382
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,660
Is Mr. Ha with you?

383
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,570
He needs to clear some things up here.

384
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,370
Woosin.

385
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:29,330
You lunatic!

386
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:31,460
SUHYEON:
<i>Get out of that house this instant!</i>

387
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,670
Did you hear that? He's all yours.

388
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:38,170
(panting)

389
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,600
(clears throat)

390
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,930
It's me.

391
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:54,440
Are you insane?
Who are you to meddle in this?

392
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,730
SUHYEON: <i>I'm the prosecutor.</i>

393
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:58,480
<i>I will catch our father's killer, okay?</i>

394
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:00,940
So why are you getting involved?

395
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,490
The statute of limitations hasn't run out.

396
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:08,120
Chairman Kwon spent
a lot of time overseas.

397
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,290
WOOSIN: <i>We have 16 days.</i>

398
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:14,540
<i>If the Adamas was the murder weapon,</i>

399
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:17,000
I can have Chairman Kwon stand trial.

400
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:18,050
(scoffs)

401
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:20,050
(grunts)

402
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,010
SUHYEON: <i>What if he isn't the killer?</i>

403
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,350
What if it wasn't him?

404
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,720
There's a witness.

405
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:34,900
A witness?

406
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:38,150
SUHYEON: <i>The man the witness saw
that night wasn't him.</i>

407
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,860
It was someone else.

408
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:44,450
This means even if the Adamas
is proven to be the murder weapon,

409
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:47,570
it doesn't directly connect him
to the murder.

410
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,160
<i>We can apply for a retrial
with the newly discovered evidence.</i>

411
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,000
But that doesn't mean
Chairman Kwon will stand trial

412
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,830
because that man could be the real killer.

413
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,000
<i>All right. You want to catch the killer?</i>

414
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,340
<i>Then we need corroborating evidence.</i>

415
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:04,970
First, we need to find out
the relationship between the two.

416
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:06,550
And that's my job, okay?

417
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,890
So stay out of this. If you can't,

418
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:10,810
then just stop. Don't do anything.

419
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:12,560
<i>I'll look into it.</i>

420
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:14,730
Suhyeon--

421
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:16,560
Stop acting recklessly!

422
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,320
Are you worried about me?

423
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,070
(groans)

424
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,620
SUHYEON: What a load of nonsense.

425
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,950
I was going to turn myself in
after stealing the Adamas.

426
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,870
I'm sure my actions
would be somewhat extenuated.

427
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:37,290
I joined hands with the police
for a reason, you know?

428
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,590
Let's talk in person soon.

429
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:42,300
Hey, Woosin.

430
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,470
(grunts)

431
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,970
Taesung, let's put a halt
to the Adamas mission.

432
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:52,100
HYUKPIL: <i>We got something on our end.</i>

433
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:55,180
If we can get more information,
it'll be easier on your part as well.

434
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,060
Keep it up.

435
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,400
-(electricity crackling)
-(groaning)

436
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:06,530
(coughs)

437
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:09,450
Name.

438
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:20,540
-(electricity crackling)
-(groaning)

439
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:28,630
Name.

440
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,720
(breathes shakily)

441
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:38,480
CHIEF JEONG: He should be reporting
back to us every six hours.

442
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,100
But we can't reach him ever since he said

443
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:43,400
he was entering Kim Seohee's house.

444
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,820
I believe
there are external factors at play.

445
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:49,530
Song Suhyeon.

446
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:52,620
Didn't you say
he and that reporter disappeared too?

447
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,580
Yes, sir. They could be involved,

448
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,200
but the prosecution hasn't made
any moves so far.

449
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:01,040
It's too clean-cut for Song Suhyeon
to have done this single-handedly.

450
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,340
You're certain someone's helping him,
but you don't know who?

451
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,050
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

452
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:10,590
(sighs)

453
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:14,850
But how?

454
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:17,970
How did Mr. Lee end up offsite?

455
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:22,310
He volunteered.
He wanted to prove himself to you.

456
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:29,070
(clicks tongue)

457
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,240
What about the rescue team?

458
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,240
They're ready.

459
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:37,200
(drawer clatters)

460
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:44,290
Let's go.

461
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:46,800
(action music)

462
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:08,480
WOOSIN:
<i>The statute of limitations hasn't run out.</i>

463
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,440
<i>We have 16 days.</i>

464
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,360
Chairman Kwon could be the killer.

465
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,240
(knocking on door)

466
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:31,760
I thought you'd decline, but you're being
awfully meticulous with that.

467
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,510
It could leave a scar.

468
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:37,050
You don't need any stitches.
And the back of your neck is fine too.

469
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,510
That stings.

470
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:41,140
You're okay, right?

471
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,730
Of course not.

472
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:45,600
He put his entire weight into it.

473
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:46,940
Not that.

474
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,650
About Lee Changwoo.

475
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:53,110
I was taken aback.

476
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:57,870
But if he really is innocent,
then there's no need to hate him.

477
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:01,160
He must feel more wronged than I do.

478
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,580
But why the long face?

479
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,920
Are you worried about your brother?

480
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:11,760
That too, and I just don't get it.

481
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:15,340
He was reckless enough
to put his entire life at stake.

482
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:20,850
He's not even our real dad.

483
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,020
Ah.

484
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,730
Am I a terrible son for thinking this way?

485
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:32,940
Woosin used to always be levelheaded
no matter the situation.

486
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:36,150
But to hear that he put everything
on the line and went there

487
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,610
just feels off.

488
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,740
(Suhyeon sighs)

489
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:44,870
To be honest,
there's something I find odd as well.

490
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:47,710
It's about Lee Changwoo.

491
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:51,800
Why did he confess to it
if he wasn't the real killer?

492
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:55,970
At first, I thought he was threatened
to confess to the murder.

493
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:58,510
But when I met him…

494
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:00,220
Enough!

495
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:03,520
I said I'm the culprit. I did it.

496
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,980
SEOHEE: <i>He was adamant.</i>

497
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,850
He made me wonder
if he was the real killer.

498
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:13,190
He's been protecting the accomplice
for the past 22 years.

499
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:15,780
Why would he keep his mouth shut

500
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:18,240
for all those years?

501
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:23,450
(sighs)
This isn't easy at all.

502
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,370
What happened to that guy?

503
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,920
That guy?

504
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:32,420
Oh, him? He's being interrogated.

505
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:35,920
(electricity crackling)

506
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:39,880
Jeez, I can't believe these people.

507
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,270
-(electricity crackling)
-(groaning)

508
00:34:57,490 --> 00:35:00,860
This isn't right. You're torturing him.

509
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:04,280
We're questioning him.
And nudging him just a bit.

510
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:05,450
Sir.

511
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:08,580
He won't die. We have our boundaries.

512
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:12,130
That's not the issue here.
How can the police be doing this?

513
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:14,340
You aided and abetted
in illegal kidnapping.

514
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,630
All right. Calm down.

515
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:22,010
How much longer will you keep that up
to get him to talk?

516
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:26,470
I heard he remained
tight-lipped all night.

517
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,180
Then isn't it game over?

518
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:30,850
You should let me take over.

519
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,230
This isn't an interrogation.

520
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,280
You'll be wasting your time.

521
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,450
Telling Prosecutor Song to just watch

522
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:42,990
seems to be a waste of manpower.

523
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:53,120
Go to Kang. I'll take over from here.

524
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,930
He's Mr. Kang to you.

525
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:08,010
(chuckles)
Yes, ma'am.

526
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:10,770
Go to Mr. Kang.

527
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,560
That little…

528
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,440
(door slams)

529
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,530
You know me, right?

530
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,450
Right?

531
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,920
Being tight-lipped won't end this torture.

532
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:36,750
Are you dead or alive?

533
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,340
So you're alive.

534
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:48,390
Those people have no plans to kill you.

535
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:51,850
They'll keep you alive until you tell them
what they want to hear.

536
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:54,100
They'll keep toying with this.

537
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:01,820
But I'm different.

538
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,990
There's nothing I want to hear from you.

539
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:08,450
I just want to verify
if what I know is true.

540
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:10,870
But I can't show you all my cards.

541
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:13,830
I'll just have to match mine with yours.

542
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:17,380
Simply put, I'm not going to be barbaric.

543
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:21,050
I just hope you'll repay my kindness.

544
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,930
Is this Chairman Kwon's doing?

545
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,350
Chairman Kwon Jaekyu.

546
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:34,980
-(fingers snap)
-Haesong Group.

547
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:42,820
Come on. He wouldn't do
something like this himself.

548
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:47,160
And who is he?

549
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:48,870
He's the hitman, right?

550
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:54,870
I don't know.

551
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:56,960
First response.

552
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:58,540
Is he on your team?

553
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,670
You guys are really organized and skilled.

554
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,420
That means you have an organization.
Could you have done this alone?

555
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,470
-(groans)
-You must move as a team.

556
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:15,480
And you guys are responsible
for killing Ms. Kim's parents, right?

557
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:21,150
I doubt you committed the murders

558
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:23,520
and cleaned up after yourself
single-handedly.

559
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:26,820
You must have a task force team
and a clear-out team.

560
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:29,860
What was it again?

561
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:32,450
You know Lee Changwoo's case, right?

562
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:36,200
It's been 22 years already.
It has a long history.

563
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:37,910
You guys did that.

564
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:40,960
I got this sketch from that incident.

565
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,710
I really don't know.

566
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:48,470
Second response.

567
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:51,050
(breathes heavily)

568
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:55,310
You're reacting to him.
I wonder who he is.

569
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:05,530
I'm certain. The man in the composite
and Chairman Kang are related.

570
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:10,030
So he's still working for the chairman
to this day.

571
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:11,990
<i>Where's home?</i>

572
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,660
Where do you live?

573
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:18,250
Are your parents alive?

574
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,710
Do you have siblings?

575
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,500
Third response.

576
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:33,140
(soft chuckle)

577
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:38,560
Stress.

578
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,440
Done.

579
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:49,070
This is all the time I have.

580
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,410
The technician will return
and resume the party.

581
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,200
Wait.

582
00:39:57,330 --> 00:39:59,330
(suspenseful music)

583
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:07,170
Do you have something to say?

584
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,800
What…

585
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:28,980
What time is it?

586
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:34,320
(chortles)

587
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,040
You little bastard.

588
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:43,210
HYUKPIL: <i>Darn it.</i>

589
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,920
Jeez, we're done for.

590
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:50,380
He endured 12 hours of torture.

591
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:53,260
Goodness, he wouldn't fall for mind games.

592
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:56,470
Why do you think
he suddenly asked about the time?

593
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:58,350
HYUKPIL: It's a diversion of sorts.

594
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:00,720
Telling us that torturing him is useless.

595
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:04,270
No. He seemed desperate.

596
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:07,810
Why was the time important?

597
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,360
It's like a time bomb.

598
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:13,360
He'll succeed as long as
he stays there until the bomb goes off.

599
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,200
But since he's not a bomber,

600
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:17,870
he's probably keeping track of time.

601
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:21,330
Keeping track? What does that mean?

602
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:23,290
He has hope. Look.

603
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:25,420
SUHYEON: He's conscious of his breathing.

604
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:30,800
That just shows that
he's trying to control himself.

605
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:35,470
SUHYEON: <i>He's already made up his mind
about whether to resist or surrender.</i>

606
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:39,680
Since he chose the former,
he'll remain tight-lipped

607
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,140
as long as he has hope.

608
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,600
What hope?

609
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,480
What do you think,
given that he's been abducted?

610
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:52,020
Don't worry, sir.
I'm sure Mr. Lee is hanging in there.

611
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:53,650
Seeing how our headquarters is safe,

612
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:55,700
he must be keeping his mouth shut.

613
00:41:57,490 --> 00:41:59,820
SUHYEON: <i>He believes his colleagues
will come to his rescue.</i>

614
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,200
That's what's keeping him alive.

615
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,330
That's false hope.

616
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:07,170
This safe house isn't so easy to find.

617
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:10,040
And what if time runs out?

618
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:12,380
What could be on the other end of that?

619
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:14,420
Suicide.

620
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:18,130
In the end, we're the ones
who are being chased by time, not him.

621
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:22,600
If he kills himself,
we won't get anything out of it.

622
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,190
HYESOO: <i>I don't know for sure
if he was the killer or not.</i>

623
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:30,560
<i>But this is what my husband said.</i>

624
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:35,190
<i>"My father killed someone with the Adamas.
And Lee Changwoo…</i>

625
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:37,450
<i>was the one who took the fall."</i>

626
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,200
(beeps)

627
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:45,870
SUHYEON: <i>The man the witness saw
that night wasn't him.</i>

628
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:47,250
<i>It was someone else.</i>

629
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:50,580
Chairman Kwon...

630
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:54,210
may not be the killer.

631
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,380
(knocking on door)

632
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:57,090
(door opens)

633
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,890
Mr. Ha?

634
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:14,230
I wanted to get you out of here,
but I think it'll be difficult.

635
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:16,650
Why?

636
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:20,400
It's a long story. But first,

637
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:26,080
I'll ask someone I know
to move your father to a safer hospital

638
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:28,870
so that Ms. Kwon
can't threaten you anymore.

639
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:33,130
They're with the police,
so don't worry and just trust them.

640
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:36,000
The election will be over soon,
and you'll be out in no time.

641
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:39,130
But my dad has moved hospitals already.

642
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:41,840
Where to?

643
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:43,550
Eunkook Medical Center.

644
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:47,060
Ms. Eun seems like a decent person.

645
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,360
What do you want?

646
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:01,900
I have a favor to ask of you.

647
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:10,750
I told her Ms. Kwon
was keeping my dad hostage,

648
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:11,790
and she helped me out.

649
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:14,750
You made a mistake.

650
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:18,670
What? Did I do something wrong?

651
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:21,470
No. We can talk later.

652
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:23,010
Mr. Ha!

653
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,150
I like your dress.

654
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:38,230
He got it for me,
but it wasn't to my liking.

655
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,570
I'm glad it looks good on you.

656
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:51,330
Such a hopeless romantic.

657
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:56,580
We need to talk.

658
00:44:57,290 --> 00:45:00,340
Right now? As you can see,
I'm on my way out.

659
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:01,590
It won't take long.

660
00:45:07,273 --> 00:45:09,983
Master, make sure you take
your medication on time.

661
00:45:10,233 --> 00:45:12,193
Don't skip any meals either.

662
00:45:12,273 --> 00:45:13,903
-(sighs)
-Force yourself to eat

663
00:45:13,983 --> 00:45:16,703
even if you don't have an appetite, okay?

664
00:45:17,323 --> 00:45:18,663
All right.

665
00:45:26,623 --> 00:45:27,463
Where's Hyesoo?

666
00:45:42,643 --> 00:45:45,683
Just cut to the chase.
The chairman is waiting for me.

667
00:45:49,023 --> 00:45:51,363
-Ms. Eun.
-You want to know who recommended you?

668
00:45:51,943 --> 00:45:53,443
I'm looking into it, so don't rush me.

669
00:45:53,523 --> 00:45:54,863
No, it's about Dongrim's father.

670
00:45:56,493 --> 00:45:59,363
-Ah.
-Thank you for helping,

671
00:46:00,163 --> 00:46:01,743
but he'll move to another hospital.

672
00:46:02,913 --> 00:46:05,873
What for?
Our hospital is the best one out there.

673
00:46:05,953 --> 00:46:07,253
I'll take care of it.

674
00:46:07,333 --> 00:46:08,583
DONGRIM: No!

675
00:46:09,413 --> 00:46:11,083
Why would you decide on your own?

676
00:46:11,833 --> 00:46:14,753
-Were you eavesdropping?
-You left in a hurry, so I followed you.

677
00:46:14,843 --> 00:46:16,133
My dad isn't going anywhere.

678
00:46:17,213 --> 00:46:18,803
-Dongrim.
-What?

679
00:46:21,893 --> 00:46:23,183
Excuse me, gentlemen.

680
00:46:25,263 --> 00:46:27,813
The reason why I helped him
is quite simple.

681
00:46:28,563 --> 00:46:29,643
The Adamas.

682
00:46:32,943 --> 00:46:34,233
You're familiar with it.

683
00:46:35,073 --> 00:46:37,573
Everyone knows
about that arrow with a diamond tip.

684
00:46:37,653 --> 00:46:38,653
Lee Changwoo.

685
00:46:42,323 --> 00:46:44,373
Is he also famous?

686
00:46:45,493 --> 00:46:48,293
-That's--
-You heard the voice recorder, didn't you?

687
00:46:49,413 --> 00:46:52,043
-I was just--
-You must've realized it too.

688
00:46:53,753 --> 00:46:56,133
I realized the moment he came
and asked for my help at night.

689
00:46:56,213 --> 00:46:58,053
He must've heard everything.
"He must think

690
00:46:58,133 --> 00:47:00,763
that we're on the same side."

691
00:47:01,883 --> 00:47:03,183
But Dongrim,

692
00:47:04,263 --> 00:47:05,763
you were mistaken.

693
00:47:07,143 --> 00:47:09,983
I'll take great care of your father.

694
00:47:11,233 --> 00:47:13,733
But if you let Ms. Kwon
control you once again,

695
00:47:18,033 --> 00:47:19,653
I'll kill your father.

696
00:47:19,743 --> 00:47:22,203
(tense music)

697
00:47:26,583 --> 00:47:28,623
Goodbye, then. I have dinner plans.

698
00:47:37,753 --> 00:47:40,423
What's going on?
What is she talking about?

699
00:47:41,213 --> 00:47:42,843
-Dongrim.
-Let go of me!

700
00:47:43,473 --> 00:47:45,343
Don't try to squirm your way out of this.

701
00:47:45,433 --> 00:47:47,013
I have the right to know!

702
00:47:47,103 --> 00:47:50,143
My dad's life is on the line.
What on earth are you two scheming?

703
00:48:09,913 --> 00:48:11,243
-Ms. Kwon.
-What?

704
00:48:11,833 --> 00:48:13,833
Ms. Hyesoo isn't in her room either.

705
00:48:14,123 --> 00:48:15,213
Is that so?

706
00:48:22,883 --> 00:48:24,093
(panting)

707
00:48:32,023 --> 00:48:33,483
You were already here.

708
00:48:33,563 --> 00:48:36,023
Yes, I rushed a bit.

709
00:48:36,103 --> 00:48:37,023
Mm.

710
00:48:38,443 --> 00:48:39,983
(helicopter engine starts)

711
00:48:58,383 --> 00:48:59,713
DONGRIM: You've gone insane.

712
00:49:00,423 --> 00:49:03,593
-Lee Dongrim.
-I don't know. I didn't hear anything.

713
00:49:05,303 --> 00:49:06,683
You're the one who wanted to know.

714
00:49:06,763 --> 00:49:09,263
(gasps)
So it's my fault?

715
00:49:09,343 --> 00:49:11,643
That was before I knew
that you were committing theft.

716
00:49:11,723 --> 00:49:14,393
DONGRIM: I don't want
to end up behind bars. Why should I?

717
00:49:15,023 --> 00:49:17,483
All because of your late father?

718
00:49:20,613 --> 00:49:23,483
I take back what I just said. I'm sorry.

719
00:49:24,823 --> 00:49:26,653
I didn't want to get you involved.

720
00:49:26,903 --> 00:49:29,493
That's why I tried
to make you leave this place.

721
00:49:30,993 --> 00:49:32,413
-But things--
-Ah.

722
00:49:33,493 --> 00:49:34,743
I'm starving.

723
00:49:36,373 --> 00:49:38,753
I'm famished.

724
00:49:38,833 --> 00:49:40,543
(approaching footsteps)

725
00:49:42,463 --> 00:49:43,713
What are you guys up to?

726
00:49:45,553 --> 00:49:47,013
We were discussing our dinner menu.

727
00:49:47,093 --> 00:49:50,143
Gosh, you looked pretty serious
to be discussing the dinner menu.

728
00:49:50,223 --> 00:49:53,263
Because we should be.
We all eat three meals a day.

729
00:49:53,353 --> 00:49:54,353
Right.

730
00:49:55,183 --> 00:49:57,643
Mr. Ha, I have a question.

731
00:49:58,233 --> 00:50:02,063
I heard <i>Persona Non Grata</i>
was based on a true story.

732
00:50:03,023 --> 00:50:05,233
Yes, it is, although I dramatized it.

733
00:50:05,823 --> 00:50:08,743
Does that mean
the lead character is a real person?

734
00:50:12,493 --> 00:50:13,533
Am I wrong?

735
00:50:14,953 --> 00:50:16,953
You're probably right.

736
00:50:23,293 --> 00:50:24,793
Yes, he really exists.

737
00:50:25,383 --> 00:50:27,463
So he's a real police officer?

738
00:50:28,053 --> 00:50:31,013
No wonder. Mr. Choi said

739
00:50:31,093 --> 00:50:35,393
it was a term for a police whistleblower.

740
00:50:36,313 --> 00:50:37,473
MR. CHOI: Mr. Kim.

741
00:50:38,773 --> 00:50:40,773
-Yes, sir?
-Playing hooky?

742
00:50:41,653 --> 00:50:42,483
No, sir.

743
00:50:43,863 --> 00:50:45,323
Patrol area three.

744
00:50:47,233 --> 00:50:48,653
I need to speak with you.

745
00:50:49,953 --> 00:50:52,073
I heard your new character loves to hunt.

746
00:50:55,333 --> 00:50:56,703
I have some advice for you.

747
00:51:00,123 --> 00:51:02,293
WOOSIN: Go ahead. What is it?

748
00:51:03,633 --> 00:51:09,263
There's a security button that has never
been pressed under the Chairman's desk.

749
00:51:09,843 --> 00:51:10,763
A security button?

750
00:51:11,763 --> 00:51:13,933
MR. CHOI:
<i>You know that button that banks have.</i>

751
00:51:14,473 --> 00:51:16,013
<i>The emergency SOS button.</i>

752
00:51:16,103 --> 00:51:18,933
He had that installed
under his desk from the start. But…

753
00:51:19,933 --> 00:51:21,853
the fact that
it never set off an alarm means…

754
00:51:21,943 --> 00:51:25,023
There was either no emergency situation
or that button was for something else.

755
00:51:25,613 --> 00:51:27,363
But if it's indeed a security button…

756
00:51:33,823 --> 00:51:37,873
(alarm beeping)

757
00:51:37,953 --> 00:51:39,583
WOOSIN: <i>Then I'll be caught red-handed.</i>

758
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:41,083
It's a 50-50 chance.

759
00:51:41,913 --> 00:51:43,673
It could be the device
that lowers the Adamas…

760
00:51:44,793 --> 00:51:45,963
or it could be an alarm.

761
00:51:48,553 --> 00:51:50,633
I'm going to steal it tonight.

762
00:51:50,713 --> 00:51:52,223
Darn it.

763
00:51:52,423 --> 00:51:54,973
I only told you so that
you wouldn't rush it and ruin everything.

764
00:51:55,593 --> 00:51:56,553
Wait for HQ's orders.

765
00:51:56,643 --> 00:51:58,353
No, it needs to happen today.

766
00:51:59,723 --> 00:52:01,643
Will Ms. Kwon ever be away again?

767
00:52:02,683 --> 00:52:06,613
Do well while I'm gone.
Check up on the rest of the maids too.

768
00:52:06,693 --> 00:52:09,323
Don't worry, ma'am.

769
00:52:13,533 --> 00:52:16,243
Especially that writer.
Watch him at all times.

770
00:52:17,533 --> 00:52:18,783
Yes, ma'am.

771
00:52:22,083 --> 00:52:24,213
(engine starts)

772
00:52:35,303 --> 00:52:36,183
Mr. Choi.

773
00:52:37,013 --> 00:52:39,183
Neither Ms. Kwon nor Chairman Kwon
is home today.

774
00:52:39,263 --> 00:52:41,223
-This is our chance.
-No.

775
00:52:43,483 --> 00:52:44,353
Then I'll do it alone.

776
00:52:45,393 --> 00:52:46,853
We need permission from headquarters!

777
00:52:52,233 --> 00:52:53,533
Don't be mistaken.

778
00:52:53,613 --> 00:52:57,283
Joining hands with the SIH doesn't mean
I'll be following their orders.

779
00:52:59,623 --> 00:53:00,913
Tonight.

780
00:53:06,373 --> 00:53:07,293
(sighs)

781
00:53:13,513 --> 00:53:14,423
(gags)

782
00:53:23,563 --> 00:53:27,353
(sighs)
Don't worry. I'm not pregnant.

783
00:53:29,853 --> 00:53:31,403
I just felt nauseous.

784
00:53:53,713 --> 00:53:55,213
Curse me if you want.

785
00:53:55,803 --> 00:53:57,303
I don't know sign language anyway.

786
00:54:02,803 --> 00:54:03,643
(door slams)

787
00:54:10,103 --> 00:54:12,653
-(slurping)
-(utensils clanking)

788
00:54:23,073 --> 00:54:24,283
Hyunjo.

789
00:54:24,873 --> 00:54:25,913
Yes, sir.

790
00:54:25,993 --> 00:54:28,583
How are the plans
for the 80th-anniversary ceremony going?

791
00:54:28,663 --> 00:54:30,583
Will everything go as planned?

792
00:54:30,673 --> 00:54:33,713
(sighs)
Of course. Don't worry.

793
00:54:33,793 --> 00:54:35,553
Make sure everything goes well.

794
00:54:36,383 --> 00:54:39,843
It'll be my retirement ceremony
as well as your inauguration ceremony.

795
00:54:39,923 --> 00:54:41,223
HYUNJO: Yes, Father.

796
00:54:43,433 --> 00:54:44,553
Inauguration?

797
00:54:44,643 --> 00:54:47,223
Yes. I'm going to officially announce him

798
00:54:47,313 --> 00:54:49,103
as my successor that day.

799
00:54:53,483 --> 00:54:54,363
I see.

800
00:54:56,983 --> 00:54:58,233
Won't you congratulate me?

801
00:55:00,403 --> 00:55:01,573
Congratulations.

802
00:55:02,283 --> 00:55:03,243
(Kwon grunts)

803
00:55:04,533 --> 00:55:06,033
(groans)

804
00:55:06,123 --> 00:55:08,503
Am I having problems again?

805
00:55:09,083 --> 00:55:12,003
Father, what's wrong? Are you okay?

806
00:55:12,083 --> 00:55:13,753
Yes, I'm fine.

807
00:55:13,833 --> 00:55:16,753
KWON: Don't make a fuss.
(groans)

808
00:55:24,223 --> 00:55:25,803
I listened to you

809
00:55:25,893 --> 00:55:28,893
and sent Ms. Kwon on an errand.

810
00:55:29,563 --> 00:55:31,313
HYUNJO: I heard.

811
00:55:31,733 --> 00:55:34,313
I bet the house feels pretty vacant.

812
00:55:36,113 --> 00:55:37,863
(Kwon groans softly)

813
00:55:50,203 --> 00:55:52,253
MR. CHOI:
<i>Once Ms. Oh does the final check,</i>

814
00:55:52,543 --> 00:55:55,003
<i>the maids are forbidden
from entering the third floor.</i>

815
00:55:58,803 --> 00:56:00,803
(sly music)

816
00:56:42,803 --> 00:56:43,973
This is it.

817
00:56:45,093 --> 00:56:46,263
MR. CHOI: <i>It's a 50-50 chance.</i>

818
00:56:46,843 --> 00:56:48,603
<i>It could be the device
that lowers the Adamas…</i>

819
00:56:51,313 --> 00:56:52,723
<i>or it could be an alarm.</i>

820
00:57:01,613 --> 00:57:03,363
What? Tonight?

821
00:57:03,863 --> 00:57:06,113
What could I do?
He was adamant about doing it himself.

822
00:57:06,453 --> 00:57:09,913
Since today is the day you collect money,
it wouldn't look odd to see you here.

823
00:57:10,283 --> 00:57:12,043
Hold on.

824
00:57:13,543 --> 00:57:15,373
What if Mr. Ha gets caught?

825
00:57:16,293 --> 00:57:18,833
Then radio the others.

826
00:57:18,923 --> 00:57:22,093
Ask for backup.
We need to leave an official record.

827
00:57:23,093 --> 00:57:26,053
Go inside the mansion and arrest him.

828
00:57:27,843 --> 00:57:29,843
-Arrest him?
-We need to cut him off.

829
00:57:31,643 --> 00:57:32,723
(man sighs)

830
00:57:32,813 --> 00:57:35,643
MAN: Then it'd be difficult
for his actions to be extenuated.

831
00:57:35,733 --> 00:57:38,023
Why should I care?

832
00:57:38,103 --> 00:57:41,523
No one should find out
that we're connected.

833
00:57:49,993 --> 00:57:51,033
Let's put on a show.

834
00:57:52,453 --> 00:57:54,623
-What show?
-You guys can't kill him.

835
00:57:55,453 --> 00:57:56,913
He knows that too.

836
00:57:57,003 --> 00:58:00,043
But not me. He knows nothing about me.

837
00:58:01,043 --> 00:58:01,883
So?

838
00:58:02,633 --> 00:58:04,633
-Prosecutor Song.
-It's just a show.

839
00:58:04,713 --> 00:58:07,843
A fake. Do you not have anesthetics?

840
00:58:09,343 --> 00:58:10,393
Do you?

841
00:58:25,233 --> 00:58:28,443
Do you know what this is?
A muscle relaxant.

842
00:58:29,073 --> 00:58:30,663
Once I inject you with this,

843
00:58:30,743 --> 00:58:33,283
your muscles will gradually relax.

844
00:58:36,333 --> 00:58:38,003
How can I cover that up…

845
00:58:46,303 --> 00:58:49,473
Your diaphragm,
which helps you breathe, will also relax.

846
00:58:57,103 --> 00:59:00,393
<i>Ultimately, you'll suffocate to death.</i>

847
00:59:03,193 --> 00:59:05,523
But you'll get the full experience

848
00:59:06,113 --> 00:59:07,573
since you'll be awake.

849
00:59:13,613 --> 00:59:14,703
Zoom in on camera three.

850
00:59:21,583 --> 00:59:25,673
Blink your eyes
if you remember who he is, okay?

851
00:59:28,883 --> 00:59:30,133
Before it's too late, okay?

852
00:59:45,483 --> 00:59:48,113
Hey, what are you doing?

853
00:59:48,193 --> 00:59:50,903
What am I doing? I'm doing my utmost best.

854
00:59:51,443 --> 00:59:53,993
What? Stop that.

855
00:59:54,073 --> 00:59:55,493
Stop that. Damn it!

856
00:59:55,573 --> 00:59:57,203
Don't do that.

857
00:59:57,283 --> 00:59:58,703
Don't do what?

858
01:00:00,293 --> 01:00:02,003
I don't care if you die.

859
01:00:02,083 --> 01:00:04,253
I'm sure the SIH would feel differently

860
01:00:05,003 --> 01:00:07,793
since they're trying
to connect this to Chairman Kwon.

861
01:00:10,213 --> 01:00:13,843
But I'm just after my father's killer.

862
01:00:16,553 --> 01:00:20,523
And what does that have to do with me?

863
01:00:24,693 --> 01:00:26,193
Hey, don't do it.

864
01:00:27,313 --> 01:00:28,403
Don't do it.

865
01:00:33,033 --> 01:00:34,863
Prosecutor Song isn't bad.

866
01:00:35,153 --> 01:00:36,533
He almost had me fooled.

867
01:00:37,913 --> 01:00:39,453
Why am I so tense?

868
01:00:40,163 --> 01:00:41,243
Darn it.

869
01:00:41,953 --> 01:00:42,913
Sir.

870
01:00:43,913 --> 01:00:45,003
I'm not sure about this.

871
01:00:45,623 --> 01:00:48,043
Maybe I should've done it instead.
What if he really dies?

872
01:00:54,673 --> 01:00:55,883
What do you mean?

873
01:00:56,933 --> 01:00:58,683
Isn't that just an anesthetic?

874
01:01:00,723 --> 01:01:02,523
(tense music)

875
01:01:06,483 --> 01:01:09,613
What have you done?

876
01:01:11,823 --> 01:01:13,483
Do you think he could fool him
with a fake?

877
01:01:16,823 --> 01:01:19,663
Are you telling me that
it really is a muscle relaxant?

878
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:21,703
Even truth serum didn't work on him.

879
01:01:21,783 --> 01:01:23,243
He needs to experience near-death--

880
01:01:23,333 --> 01:01:24,583
SEOHEE: Are you insane?

881
01:01:25,163 --> 01:01:27,583
Prosecutor Song isn't aware of this.

882
01:01:29,333 --> 01:01:30,753
MANAGER LEE: God damn it.

883
01:01:33,213 --> 01:01:35,383
(Manager Lee breathing heavily)

884
01:01:36,093 --> 01:01:37,133
(whimpers)

885
01:01:47,143 --> 01:01:49,063
(gasps)

886
01:02:01,203 --> 01:02:03,203
(tense music)

887

(gasping)

888
01:02:23,183 --> 01:02:26,393
The security team isn't moving.
That means it wasn't an alarm.

889
01:02:32,613 --> 01:02:34,613

01:03:26,623 --> 01:03:27,833
Where…

893
01:03:40,763 --> 01:03:41,973
Ms. Kwon.

894
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:54,943
Ms. Jang, please hurry.

895
01:03:55,023 --> 01:03:56,523
The sooner, the better.

896
01:03:57,113 --> 01:03:58,693
I'll do my best, ma'am.

897
01:04:01,033 --> 01:04:02,903
It is marvelous.

898
01:04:23,883 --> 01:04:25,223
He's getting rid of the evidence.

899
01:04:33,683 --> 01:04:36,603
(closing theme music)

MS. LEE: <i>Justice?</i>

902
01:04:52,373 --> 01:04:54,713
<i>Even if he's the scumbag
who killed your parents?</i>

903
01:04:54,793 --> 01:04:56,253
WOOSIN: <i>Something doesn't feel right.</i>

904
01:04:56,333 --> 01:04:58,293

906
01:05:02,053 --> 01:05:04,053
HYUKPIL: <i>Did they survive it?
Or were they spared?</i>

907
01:05:04,553 --> 01:05:06,723
SUHYEON:
<i>They're the ones who raided the SIH.</i>

908
01:05:07,763 --> 01:05:11,353
