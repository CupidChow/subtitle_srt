ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:48,468 --> 00:00:50,928
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,388
<i>The fire extinguishing system
is being activated.</i>

4
00:01:07,608 --> 00:01:08,908
Found it.

5
00:01:17,868 --> 00:01:19,578
Stop the system immediately.

6
00:01:19,668 --> 00:01:22,048
Someone's still in there.

7
00:01:22,128 --> 00:01:23,918
<i>Stop the system.</i>

8
00:01:24,008 --> 00:01:25,628
<i>Mr. Ha is still in the house.</i>

9
00:01:26,258 --> 00:01:27,378
- Shut it down!
- Yes, sir.

10
00:01:34,718 --> 00:01:35,768
Mr. Ha!

11
00:01:36,348 --> 00:01:37,558
Mr. Ha.

12
00:01:37,938 --> 00:01:39,558
- Mr. Ha!
- Mr. Ha!

13
00:01:39,648 --> 00:01:40,648
What happened?

14
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:43,568
- Call a doctor!
- Mr. Ha!

15
00:01:43,648 --> 00:01:44,728
Open your eyes!

16
00:01:44,818 --> 00:01:45,818
Move.

17
00:01:46,568 --> 00:01:47,778
Mr. Ha.

18
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,408
Mr. Ha, wake up!

19
00:01:53,828 --> 00:01:55,578
What happened?
Where's the doctor?

20
00:01:55,658 --> 00:01:56,788
He's on his way.

21
00:03:37,388 --> 00:03:40,218
AT 11 TONIGHT. UNDER THE SOUTHERN PIER
OF DANGSAN RAILWAY BRIDGE

22
00:04:26,768 --> 00:04:28,188
Have I been stood up?

23
00:04:40,908 --> 00:04:41,988
Ms. Kim.

24
00:04:43,078 --> 00:04:44,288
Why are you here?

25
00:04:47,168 --> 00:04:48,918
I sent that text.

26
00:04:52,798 --> 00:04:54,008
What do you mean?

27
00:04:56,678 --> 00:04:58,138
I got him.

28
00:05:03,218 --> 00:05:04,348
He has no fingerprints.

29
00:05:04,928 --> 00:05:06,478
It won't be easy to identify him.

30
00:05:07,058 --> 00:05:08,348
And Song Suhyeon?

31
00:05:08,438 --> 00:05:10,108
Seohee will take care of him.

32
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:13,528
I lured you to this open area

33
00:05:13,608 --> 00:05:16,278
to see if anyone was tailing you.
You're all clear.

34
00:05:17,158 --> 00:05:19,868
Hold on. Are you saying I was your bait?

35
00:05:19,948 --> 00:05:22,618
- It was simply a mission.
- What mission?

36
00:05:23,118 --> 00:05:24,248
Are you kidding me?

37
00:05:24,948 --> 00:05:28,118
I told you I visited Lee Changwoo
on purpose. It was a success.

38
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:29,288
A success?

39
00:05:29,878 --> 00:05:31,918
You need to be more detailed than that.

40
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:35,128
Stop making me angry
by talking so vaguely!

41
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:37,178
I got him.

42
00:05:38,128 --> 00:05:39,838
Who exactly?

43
00:05:41,548 --> 00:05:43,598
The man who was tailing you.

44
00:05:44,018 --> 00:05:47,098
The one who tried to kill me. I got him.

45
00:05:47,688 --> 00:05:48,728
Unbelievable.

46
00:05:49,518 --> 00:05:52,938
Don't be too offended. I was bait as well.

47
00:05:53,688 --> 00:05:56,188
You too? Then who was the mastermind?

48
00:05:58,778 --> 00:06:00,448
I'd like to introduce you to some people.

49
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:17,878
What are you looking at?

50
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:22,298
God, you're making me see red.

51
00:06:24,138 --> 00:06:26,348
Who are you exactly? Tell me!

52
00:06:29,058 --> 00:06:30,768
Come with me if you want to find out.

53
00:06:51,998 --> 00:06:53,918
{\an8}Are you sure
we don't need to go to the hospital?

54
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:55,708
{\an8}I'm okay.

55
00:06:55,798 --> 00:06:58,088
{\an8}The doctor who came by said I was fine.

56
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:01,378
{\an8}I can't believe that woman, Ms. Kwon.
She's frightening.

57
00:07:01,468 --> 00:07:04,508
{\an8}How could she not send you to the hospital
in a life-and-death situation?

58
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,138
{\an8}Did you forget?

59
00:07:08,348 --> 00:07:11,268
{\an8}They're holding us hostage
until the election is over.

60
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:27,738
I have a few questions to ask you
as the chief of security.

61
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,448
Sure.

62
00:07:30,748 --> 00:07:33,998
Dongrim, can you get me a warm cup of tea?

63
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,078
Okay.

64
00:07:45,218 --> 00:07:46,218
So?

65
00:07:47,218 --> 00:07:49,558
Did you find the Adamas?

66
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:51,428
No.

67
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:53,978
It was all in vain.
Everything we did was for nothing.

68
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:55,608
But…

69
00:07:57,858 --> 00:07:59,108
I think I found it.

70
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:01,608
You found it?

71
00:08:01,688 --> 00:08:03,318
The halogen gas…

72
00:08:05,358 --> 00:08:08,448
was being sucked into the ceiling.

73
00:08:09,408 --> 00:08:12,498
The Adamas… is up there.

74
00:08:13,498 --> 00:08:15,578
- Are you sure?
- Yes, 100%.

75
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:18,878
I finally realized...

76
00:08:19,998 --> 00:08:23,378
why the carpet was placed there.

77
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:28,388
<i>It was the same pattern</i>

78
00:08:28,968 --> 00:08:30,968
<i>and design…</i>

79
00:08:33,678 --> 00:08:35,638
<i>…as the carpet that was used
on the day the Adamas</i>

80
00:08:36,348 --> 00:08:37,478
<i>was first revealed.</i>

81
00:08:39,358 --> 00:08:40,688
<i>That's why</i>

82
00:08:41,358 --> 00:08:43,528
<i>he has the same carpet in his office.</i>

83
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:46,408
<i>He just can't let go
of the euphoria he felt that day.</i>

84
00:08:47,158 --> 00:08:50,618
<i>As someone who enjoys
having ultimate power,</i>

85
00:08:51,908 --> 00:08:54,578
<i>that day must've felt like
his coronation ceremony.</i>

86
00:08:56,538 --> 00:08:58,918
<i>The Adamas is his crown.</i>

87
00:09:06,468 --> 00:09:08,178
Now that we know where it is,

88
00:09:09,388 --> 00:09:11,808
we just need to set a date
and carry it out.

89
00:09:11,888 --> 00:09:15,388
You're going to get back at it
despite almost getting killed today?

90
00:09:15,478 --> 00:09:17,188
I knew what I was getting myself into.

91
00:09:17,478 --> 00:09:19,438
But let's make it quick.

92
00:09:20,188 --> 00:09:22,148
Like Ms. Yoon today,

93
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:26,108
I don't like it when others are put
in danger because of me.

94
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:29,198
That's rich coming from someone
who's going to steal the Adamas.

95
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:33,618
Lighten up. Everyone is safe.

96
00:09:35,198 --> 00:09:36,708
There's something that bothers me.

97
00:09:38,418 --> 00:09:41,038
I lost the voice recorder.

98
00:09:45,838 --> 00:09:47,218
What should I do?

99
00:09:52,678 --> 00:09:54,598
This is driving me crazy.

100
00:10:01,648 --> 00:10:04,398
Mr. Ha sure is one-of-a-kind.

101
00:10:04,898 --> 00:10:07,358
He didn't hesitate to go back
into the house like a true man.

102
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:10,818
Treat him well. He's your savior.

103
00:10:14,658 --> 00:10:15,658
What is it?

104
00:10:16,498 --> 00:10:19,958
You knew I was at the heliport.

105
00:10:20,038 --> 00:10:24,338
Were you really trying to kill him?

106
00:10:24,918 --> 00:10:26,548
Are you worried about him

107
00:10:26,628 --> 00:10:28,718
or your plan falling through?

108
00:10:30,548 --> 00:10:33,298
I heard you were the one
who recommended him to our master.

109
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,428
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

110
00:10:39,808 --> 00:10:41,768
Was it because of Ms. Hyesoo?

111
00:10:42,348 --> 00:10:45,268
Because he resembles Mr. Minjo?

112
00:10:49,108 --> 00:10:51,858
I can see right through you.

113
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:55,788
Do you think

114
00:10:55,868 --> 00:10:58,748
Hyesoo will have an affair with him?

115
00:11:02,418 --> 00:11:04,668
Do you think she will get a divorce?

116
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:09,298
Jeez, you're such an idiot.

117
00:12:34,298 --> 00:12:37,548
What will you do about this situation?

118
00:12:38,348 --> 00:12:40,678
They even got Mr. Lee's composite sketch.

119
00:12:43,058 --> 00:12:46,058
Father decided to retire,

120
00:12:46,598 --> 00:12:48,858
yet you can't wrap up such an old case.

121
00:12:48,938 --> 00:12:52,648
Do you think he'll let
someone like you take over? Do you?

122
00:12:56,488 --> 00:12:58,948
Haesong's 80th-anniversary ceremony
is just around the corner.

123
00:12:59,948 --> 00:13:02,038
What was his name? Song Suhyeon?

124
00:13:02,788 --> 00:13:05,658
Will you let that lousy prosecutor
ruin everything for you?

125
00:13:05,748 --> 00:13:08,628
All of this happened
because you trusted Mr. Lee.

126
00:13:11,088 --> 00:13:12,168
Hyunjo.

127
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,638
Kwon Hyunjo.

128
00:13:21,558 --> 00:13:22,888
You need to do it.

129
00:13:24,218 --> 00:13:25,678
Put an end to this once and for all.

130
00:13:26,728 --> 00:13:27,768
Okay?

131
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:40,818
Ms. Jang.

132
00:13:41,828 --> 00:13:44,578
I have a discreet favor to ask of you.

133
00:14:14,818 --> 00:14:18,238
That took long enough.
Can I take this off now?

134
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:28,958
Who are you guys?

135
00:14:29,418 --> 00:14:31,958
- They're...
- I wasn't asking you.

136
00:14:35,088 --> 00:14:37,088
I was a bit rude
for our first encounter, wasn't I?

137
00:14:38,718 --> 00:14:40,128
Are you the head here?

138
00:14:42,218 --> 00:14:45,808
It must've been an uncomfortable trip.
But please do understand.

139
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,388
I couldn't risk exposing
our safe house to a stranger.

140
00:14:48,478 --> 00:14:51,268
That's enough.
Let's just introduce ourselves.

141
00:14:52,018 --> 00:14:53,108
Sure.

142
00:14:54,438 --> 00:14:57,738
Prosecutor Song Suhyeon,
I'm Kang Hyukpil of the SIH.

143
00:14:59,028 --> 00:15:00,608
Special Investigations Headquarters?

144
00:15:23,588 --> 00:15:26,468
Dongrim.

145
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:28,678
Mr. Ha.

146
00:15:29,848 --> 00:15:31,268
Please forgive me.

147
00:15:32,978 --> 00:15:33,978
For what?

148
00:15:36,188 --> 00:15:37,398
Are you crying?

149
00:15:41,238 --> 00:15:42,698
So you stole it?

150
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:44,278
Yes,

151
00:15:44,738 --> 00:15:46,828
when you were unconscious.

152
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:48,788
Why?

153
00:15:52,538 --> 00:15:53,538
Lee Dongrim.

154
00:15:54,998 --> 00:15:56,588
So I could give it to Ms. Kwon.

155
00:15:57,288 --> 00:15:58,128
What?

156
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,708
She wanted me to find out
what you were up to.

157
00:16:00,798 --> 00:16:03,128
And I agreed to help her.

158
00:16:03,798 --> 00:16:06,678
She said she'd let me leave this place
if I helped her.

159
00:16:07,598 --> 00:16:08,718
I had no choice.

160
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,468
She was lying.

161
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,638
No one leaves
without the chairman's permission.

162
00:16:14,648 --> 00:16:17,518
Then what should I do? I need to leave.

163
00:16:17,608 --> 00:16:20,228
But you didn't leave
when I told you to, so why?

164
00:16:21,488 --> 00:16:23,818
My dad might pass away.

165
00:16:24,738 --> 00:16:25,738
What do you mean?

166
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:27,528
He may be in need...

167
00:16:28,658 --> 00:16:31,248
of an urgent liver transplant.

168
00:16:32,368 --> 00:16:33,658
But he can't get one without me.

169
00:16:34,158 --> 00:16:36,288
I've been taking supplements

170
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:38,788
and working out regularly.

171
00:16:39,128 --> 00:16:40,918
I've been taking great care of my health.

172
00:16:40,998 --> 00:16:42,258
You're…

173
00:16:45,178 --> 00:16:46,838
his donor, aren't you?

174
00:16:50,138 --> 00:16:53,228
Mr. Ha, please help me.

175
00:16:54,808 --> 00:16:56,938
I need to leave this house, so please.

176
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:25,798
Mr. Kwon picked them out himself.

177
00:17:26,298 --> 00:17:28,388
Aren't they just perfect
for tonight's dinner?

178
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:33,218
Every single one is so luxurious.

179
00:17:36,268 --> 00:17:37,898
This one looks good.

180
00:17:38,018 --> 00:17:40,768
Do you like it? Will you go with this one?

181
00:17:41,688 --> 00:17:42,688
Sure.

182
00:17:45,238 --> 00:17:46,238
This one.

183
00:18:18,518 --> 00:18:22,608
PUT IT ON THIS EVENING
I CAN'T WAIT

184
00:18:39,078 --> 00:18:41,168
He's got a cute side, that one.

185
00:18:41,748 --> 00:18:43,998
Come in.

186
00:18:50,048 --> 00:18:51,678
Visiting me at this hour?

187
00:19:02,348 --> 00:19:03,478
What do you want?

188
00:19:09,438 --> 00:19:10,778
I've decided on the D-day.

189
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:13,818
When is it?

190
00:19:15,278 --> 00:19:16,408
Tonight.

191
00:19:18,038 --> 00:19:20,618
- Why are you rushing it?
- What's the point of delaying it?

192
00:19:20,998 --> 00:19:22,708
It's going to be easier than we thought.

193
00:19:22,788 --> 00:19:23,788
How so?

194
00:19:23,878 --> 00:19:27,088
You weren't certain
the Adamas was here, were you?

195
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,878
- Why not?
- Because there was no security system.

196
00:19:31,008 --> 00:19:33,838
Exactly. Had there been
a cutting edge security system

197
00:19:33,928 --> 00:19:35,638
inside the mansion as well,

198
00:19:35,718 --> 00:19:37,348
then you would've known about it.

199
00:19:38,018 --> 00:19:40,138
The door to Kwon Minjo's room,
which was locked,

200
00:19:40,228 --> 00:19:41,518
had a keyhole. Old school.

201
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:44,538
I'm sure the Adamas' security system
isn't that strict either.

202
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:47,858
So that's why you think it'll be easy?
That's hard to believe.

203
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:51,528
Look at the furniture arrangement
in the chairman's office. It's obvious.

204
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:55,448
The center of that big room is empty

205
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,988
solely for him to appreciate the Adamas.

206
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,408
He's very sensitive to visual stimuli.

207
00:20:00,498 --> 00:20:02,868
<i>And that's proven
by how he exhibits</i>

208
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,328
<i>his priceless artworks
instead of storing them somewhere.</i>

209
00:20:05,998 --> 00:20:08,298
Plus, he makes his judgments

210
00:20:08,378 --> 00:20:10,548
based on what he's seen.

211
00:20:10,628 --> 00:20:13,928
He looks like a decent guy.

212
00:20:14,428 --> 00:20:15,838
What do you think?

213
00:20:15,928 --> 00:20:19,008
Isn't it splendid yet graceful?

214
00:20:19,598 --> 00:20:20,888
Imagine a first date.

215
00:20:20,968 --> 00:20:24,898
Someone who's sensitive to hearing
will remember conversations the most.

216
00:20:24,978 --> 00:20:27,768
Someone who's sensitive to smells
will remember an individual's scent.

217
00:20:27,858 --> 00:20:31,858
And someone who's sensitive to visuals
will remember their clothing or smile.

218
00:20:32,358 --> 00:20:34,068
The chairman values what he sees.

219
00:20:34,648 --> 00:20:37,948
And his office is the most ideal place
where he can appreciate the Adamas.

220
00:20:39,868 --> 00:20:41,658
Fine. That's all great.

221
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:45,168
But how do we lower it from the ceiling?

222
00:20:46,248 --> 00:20:47,488
He likes having ultimate power.

223
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,548
Where does the king reside?

224
00:20:51,628 --> 00:20:53,008
On the throne.

225
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:56,178
It's on his desk.

226
00:20:57,508 --> 00:20:59,638
So there must be a switch there?

227
00:21:00,258 --> 00:21:01,388
Do you want to bet?

228
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:04,978
If it's not a simple switch,
then we may need a passcode.

229
00:21:05,058 --> 00:21:06,978
That's even better.

230
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:10,768
<i>It'll be easy to compile the
combination once we find out the numbers.</i>

231
00:21:10,858 --> 00:21:12,618
<i>We should be able to specify
the first digit.</i>

232
00:21:12,648 --> 00:21:16,318
<i>The first and second digits
have a psychological link.</i>

233
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:19,368
I have more than enough information
when it comes to him.

234
00:21:19,448 --> 00:21:21,788
Okay. Let me report this to headquarters.

235
00:21:22,488 --> 00:21:24,958
They're dealing with an issue
at the moment.

236
00:21:25,498 --> 00:21:26,708
What issue?

237
00:21:28,168 --> 00:21:29,168
Your brother…

238
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,208
is at the SIH safe house.

239
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:45,598
He's as stubborn as a mule.
I wish I could give him a good beating.

240
00:21:52,568 --> 00:21:54,478
Why must I join hands with you?

241
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:59,028
I explained it to you all night long.

242
00:22:00,368 --> 00:22:01,568
Should I do it all over again?

243
00:22:01,618 --> 00:22:03,788
Okay. So you know me through Woosin,

244
00:22:03,868 --> 00:22:05,578
and you know Ms. Kim through me.

245
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:08,538
Then you learned
of her parents' mysterious deaths.

246
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:10,248
Then you noticed someone tailing me,

247
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:14,048
so you told her the truth
and asked her for help. I get all that.

248
00:22:14,128 --> 00:22:16,168
But I'm confused
about what comes after that.

249
00:22:16,258 --> 00:22:17,918
Lee Changwoo is innocent?

250
00:22:18,008 --> 00:22:19,888
That's why you're getting involved?

251
00:22:20,758 --> 00:22:24,558
Correct. That's when
we struck a deal with your brother.

252
00:22:24,638 --> 00:22:27,228
That lunatic…

253
00:22:28,268 --> 00:22:31,324
He's not on a trip but instead at that
mansion to write the chairman's memoir?

254
00:22:31,348 --> 00:22:33,228
He's stealing what? The Adamas?

255
00:22:34,148 --> 00:22:37,358
So what if that is the murder weapon?
The case is 22 years old.

256
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,738
Really…

257
00:22:42,908 --> 00:22:47,578
The SIH reached out to him
and offered to catch our father's killer?

258
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:51,628
Look, Mr. Kang. What is your true motive?

259
00:22:53,628 --> 00:22:56,878
You didn't tell me that last night.
What is it?

260
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,548
Answer me!

261
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:03,548
What an unbelievable bastard.

262
00:23:07,888 --> 00:23:08,888
Kwon Jaekyu.

263
00:23:12,018 --> 00:23:14,398
Your brother thinks he was the killer.

264
00:23:14,978 --> 00:23:17,728
If the Adamas is indeed
the murder weapon that disappeared,

265
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:20,568
then Chairman Kwon has to be involved.

266
00:23:22,698 --> 00:23:24,488
Ah.

267
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:28,748
But that's what Woosin thinks.
What about you guys?

268
00:23:29,288 --> 00:23:31,788
You couldn't have been persuaded
by just that.

269
00:23:32,918 --> 00:23:34,288
We have a credible testimony.

270
00:23:34,378 --> 00:23:36,248
- Testimony?
- An audio recording.

271
00:23:37,998 --> 00:23:39,338
Haesong's daughter-in-law.

272
00:23:40,968 --> 00:23:44,928
That's why we thought he must be involved.

273
00:23:51,348 --> 00:23:54,808
I guess it's safe to say
that we're on the same page.

274
00:23:56,478 --> 00:23:57,688
I hope we get along.

275
00:24:03,488 --> 00:24:04,858
You freaking wish.

276
00:24:11,578 --> 00:24:13,158
That lunatic!

277
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,088
What's wrong?

278
00:24:20,088 --> 00:24:21,088
Prosecutor Song.

279
00:24:26,928 --> 00:24:27,968
Move.

280
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,678
I was told not to let you go outside, sir.

281
00:24:31,768 --> 00:24:32,768
Let me go.

282
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:34,688
Cut that nonsense and move aside.

283
00:24:34,768 --> 00:24:35,768
I can't, sir.

284
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:38,688
Open the door.

285
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:40,938
Don't do this. Calm down!

286
00:24:41,028 --> 00:24:44,648
Calm down? How can I when my brother
is going to steal the Adamas?

287
00:24:44,738 --> 00:24:46,658
He could end up behind bars.

288
00:24:46,738 --> 00:24:48,448
God, that idiot!

289
00:24:48,948 --> 00:24:50,488
He must be aware of that.

290
00:24:50,578 --> 00:24:52,198
I'm sure he has thought this through.

291
00:24:52,288 --> 00:24:53,958
Do you really think he has?

292
00:24:54,038 --> 00:24:55,618
He didn't even tell me about this!

293
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:57,998
Will you seriously keep this up?

294
00:24:58,128 --> 00:25:00,168
They explained it to you
numerous times yesterday.

295
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:03,338
I can't believe them. No, I refuse to.

296
00:25:03,508 --> 00:25:06,798
Chairman Kwon is the killer?
Don't make me laugh.

297
00:25:06,888 --> 00:25:08,548
Then who was that man you saw?

298
00:25:08,638 --> 00:25:10,348
That's something I must find out!

299
00:25:10,428 --> 00:25:11,678
Don't you get it?

300
00:25:11,768 --> 00:25:13,678
They're using Woosin.

301
00:25:13,768 --> 00:25:15,324
They don't care who the real killer is.

302
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:16,994
They just want to tie
the chairman to this.

303
00:25:17,018 --> 00:25:20,728
But that idiot has no idea
and is inside that mansion!

304
00:25:21,398 --> 00:25:24,068
I can involve anyone
in order to catch the real culprit,

305
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:26,238
not just Chairman Kwon.

306
00:25:26,318 --> 00:25:30,158
I won't hesitate to join hands
with anyone, not just the SIH!

307
00:25:34,038 --> 00:25:35,828
Are you worried about your brother?

308
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:40,288
That's not the point.
I will catch the killer at all costs.

309
00:25:40,878 --> 00:25:41,998
So…

310
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:44,798
Hey, step aside.

311
00:25:48,128 --> 00:25:50,968
I told you to move. Open the door.

312
00:25:51,048 --> 00:25:52,388
Open the door!

313
00:25:53,558 --> 00:25:54,888
Darn it.

314
00:25:58,228 --> 00:25:59,438
Blood?

315
00:25:59,518 --> 00:26:03,108
Hey. You hit me first, okay?

316
00:26:06,988 --> 00:26:08,238
Jeez.

317
00:26:13,028 --> 00:26:14,118
Prosecutor Song!

318
00:26:20,128 --> 00:26:22,168
They'll suspect us
if we're always together.

319
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:26,088
I said I was teaching you how to hunt,
so I need to make it look like I am.

320
00:26:27,628 --> 00:26:28,838
Are we there yet?

321
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:30,798
We're almost there.

322
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,848
By the way,
will you be able to persuade him?

323
00:26:34,508 --> 00:26:35,968
Your brother had a fit all night

324
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:38,078
even though they explained everything.

325
00:26:38,808 --> 00:26:40,978
He'll understand once I talk to him.

326
00:26:42,358 --> 00:26:43,398
Jeez.

327
00:26:59,078 --> 00:27:00,078
We're here.

328
00:27:18,308 --> 00:27:21,268
A satellite phone.

329
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:30,608
Must you go this far?

330
00:27:38,408 --> 00:27:41,998
Darn it! That hurts so much.

331
00:27:42,618 --> 00:27:43,788
Sir.

332
00:27:43,878 --> 00:27:45,248
Tonight is D-day?

333
00:27:46,038 --> 00:27:48,708
I'm not sure.
We've encountered something unexpected.

334
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:50,918
Unexpected? Is it bad?

335
00:27:51,008 --> 00:27:52,338
<i>It's actually to our advantage.</i>

336
00:27:52,428 --> 00:27:53,888
Is Mr. Ha with you?

337
00:27:53,968 --> 00:27:55,798
He needs to clear some things up here.

338
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:58,598
Woosin.

339
00:27:59,598 --> 00:28:01,558
You lunatic!

340
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:03,688
<i>Get out of that house this instant!</i>

341
00:28:06,058 --> 00:28:07,898
Did you hear that? He's all yours.

342
00:28:18,908 --> 00:28:20,158
It's me.

343
00:28:23,408 --> 00:28:26,668
Are you insane?
Who are you to meddle in this?

344
00:28:26,748 --> 00:28:27,958
<i>I'm the prosecutor.</i>

345
00:28:28,038 --> 00:28:30,708
<i>I will catch our father's killer, okay?</i>

346
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:33,168
So why are you getting involved?

347
00:28:34,008 --> 00:28:35,718
The statute of limitations hasn't run out.

348
00:28:37,848 --> 00:28:40,348
Chairman Kwon spent
a lot of time overseas.

349
00:28:42,308 --> 00:28:43,518
<i>We have 16 days.</i>

350
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:46,768
<i>If the Adamas was the murder weapon,</i>

351
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:49,228
I can have Chairman Kwon stand trial.

352
00:28:54,738 --> 00:28:56,238
<i>What if he isn't the killer?</i>

353
00:28:57,528 --> 00:29:00,578
What if it wasn't him?

354
00:29:01,538 --> 00:29:02,948
There's a witness.

355
00:29:06,038 --> 00:29:07,128
A witness?

356
00:29:07,998 --> 00:29:10,378
<i>The man the witness saw
that night wasn't him.</i>

357
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:12,088
It was someone else.

358
00:29:12,588 --> 00:29:16,678
This means even if the Adamas
is proven to be the murder weapon,

359
00:29:16,758 --> 00:29:19,798
it doesn't directly connect him
to the murder.

360
00:29:19,888 --> 00:29:22,388
<i>We can apply for a retrial
with the newly discovered evidence.</i>

361
00:29:22,468 --> 00:29:26,228
But that doesn't mean
Chairman Kwon will stand trial

362
00:29:26,308 --> 00:29:29,058
because that man could be the real killer.

363
00:29:29,648 --> 00:29:31,248
<i>All right. You want to catch the killer?</i>

364
00:29:31,688 --> 00:29:33,568
<i>Then we need corroborating evidence.</i>

365
00:29:33,648 --> 00:29:37,198
First, we need to find out
the relationship between the two.

366
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:38,778
And that's my job, okay?

367
00:29:38,868 --> 00:29:41,118
So stay out of this. If you can't,

368
00:29:41,198 --> 00:29:43,038
then just stop. Don't do anything.

369
00:29:43,118 --> 00:29:44,788
<i>I'll look into it.</i>

370
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:46,958
Suhyeon...

371
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:48,788
Stop acting recklessly!

372
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:53,548
Are you worried about me?

373
00:29:59,008 --> 00:30:00,848
What a load of nonsense.

374
00:30:00,928 --> 00:30:03,178
I was going to turn myself in
after stealing the Adamas.

375
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:06,098
I'm sure my actions
would be somewhat extenuated.

376
00:30:06,808 --> 00:30:09,518
I joined hands with the police
for a reason, you know?

377
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:12,818
Let's talk in person soon.

378
00:30:12,898 --> 00:30:14,528
Hey, Woosin.

379
00:30:19,028 --> 00:30:22,198
Taesung, let's put a halt
to the Adamas mission.

380
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:24,328
<i>We got something on our end.</i>

381
00:30:24,408 --> 00:30:27,408
If we can get more information,
it'll be easier on your part as well.

382
00:30:28,288 --> 00:30:29,288
Keep it up.

383
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:41,798
Name.

384
00:30:59,898 --> 00:31:00,898
Name.

385
00:31:07,618 --> 00:31:10,708
He should be reporting
back to us every six hours.

386
00:31:10,788 --> 00:31:13,328
But we can't reach him ever since he said

387
00:31:13,418 --> 00:31:15,628
he was entering Kim Seohee's house.

388
00:31:17,048 --> 00:31:19,048
I believe
there are external factors at play.

389
00:31:20,258 --> 00:31:21,758
Song Suhyeon.

390
00:31:22,718 --> 00:31:24,848
Didn't you say
he and that reporter disappeared too?

391
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:26,808
Yes, sir. They could be involved,

392
00:31:26,928 --> 00:31:29,428
but the prosecution hasn't made
any moves so far.

393
00:31:30,178 --> 00:31:33,268
It's too clean-cut for Song Suhyeon
to have done this single-handedly.

394
00:31:33,348 --> 00:31:36,568
You're certain someone's helping him,
but you don't know who?

395
00:31:37,358 --> 00:31:39,278
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

396
00:31:45,658 --> 00:31:47,078
But how?

397
00:31:48,538 --> 00:31:50,198
How did Mr. Lee end up offsite?

398
00:31:51,208 --> 00:31:54,538
He volunteered.
He wanted to prove himself to you.

399
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,468
What about the rescue team?

400
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:06,548
They're ready.

401
00:32:15,518 --> 00:32:16,518
Let's go.

402
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:40,708
<i>The statute of limitations hasn't run out.</i>

403
00:32:41,338 --> 00:32:42,668
<i>We have 16 days.</i>

404
00:32:43,508 --> 00:32:45,588
Chairman Kwon could be the killer.

405
00:33:00,398 --> 00:33:03,988
I thought you'd decline, but you're being
awfully meticulous with that.

406
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:05,738
It could leave a scar.

407
00:33:05,818 --> 00:33:09,278
You don't need any stitches.
And the back of your neck is fine too.

408
00:33:09,368 --> 00:33:10,738
That stings.

409
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:13,368
You're okay, right?

410
00:33:14,288 --> 00:33:15,958
Of course not.

411
00:33:16,038 --> 00:33:17,828
He put his entire weight into it.

412
00:33:17,918 --> 00:33:19,168
Not that.

413
00:33:19,788 --> 00:33:20,878
About Lee Changwoo.

414
00:33:23,878 --> 00:33:25,338
I was taken aback.

415
00:33:26,008 --> 00:33:30,098
But if he really is innocent,
then there's no need to hate him.

416
00:33:30,718 --> 00:33:33,388
He must feel more wronged than I do.

417
00:33:35,428 --> 00:33:36,808
But why the long face?

418
00:33:37,728 --> 00:33:39,148
Are you worried about your brother?

419
00:33:40,648 --> 00:33:43,988
That too, and I just don't get it.

420
00:33:44,568 --> 00:33:47,568
He was reckless enough
to put his entire life at stake.

421
00:33:51,778 --> 00:33:53,078
He's not even our real dad.

422
00:33:55,368 --> 00:33:56,368
Ah.

423
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:00,958
Am I a terrible son for thinking this way?

424
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:05,168
Woosin used to always be levelheaded
no matter the situation.

425
00:34:05,798 --> 00:34:08,378
But to hear that he put everything
on the line and went there

426
00:34:08,628 --> 00:34:09,838
just feels off.

427
00:34:13,508 --> 00:34:17,098
To be honest,
there's something I find odd as well.

428
00:34:18,638 --> 00:34:19,938
It's about Lee Changwoo.

429
00:34:20,018 --> 00:34:24,028
Why did he confess to it
if he wasn't the real killer?

430
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:28,198
At first, I thought he was threatened
to confess to the murder.

431
00:34:29,198 --> 00:34:30,738
But when I met him…

432
00:34:31,318 --> 00:34:32,448
Enough!

433
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:35,748
I said I'm the culprit. I did it.

434
00:34:36,788 --> 00:34:38,208
<i>He was adamant.</i>

435
00:34:38,288 --> 00:34:41,078
He made me wonder
if he was the real killer.

436
00:34:42,588 --> 00:34:45,418
He's been protecting the accomplice
for the past 22 years.

437
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:48,008
Why would he keep his mouth shut

438
00:34:48,258 --> 00:34:50,468
for all those years?

439
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,678
This isn't easy at all.

440
00:34:58,308 --> 00:34:59,598
What happened to that guy?

441
00:35:00,188 --> 00:35:01,188
That guy?

442
00:35:01,688 --> 00:35:04,648
Oh, him? He's being interrogated.

443
00:35:08,238 --> 00:35:12,108
Jeez, I can't believe these people.

444
00:35:29,718 --> 00:35:33,088
This isn't right. You're torturing him.

445
00:35:33,178 --> 00:35:36,508
We're questioning him.
And nudging him just a bit.

446
00:35:36,598 --> 00:35:37,678
Sir.

447
00:35:37,768 --> 00:35:40,808
He won't die. We have our boundaries.

448
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:44,358
That's not the issue here.
How can the police be doing this?

449
00:35:44,438 --> 00:35:46,568
You aided and abetted
in illegal kidnapping.

450
00:35:47,648 --> 00:35:49,858
All right. Calm down.

451
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:54,238
How much longer will you keep that up
to get him to talk?

452
00:35:56,778 --> 00:35:58,698
I heard he remained
tight-lipped all night.

453
00:35:58,788 --> 00:36:00,408
Then isn't it game over?

454
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:03,078
You should let me take over.

455
00:36:06,168 --> 00:36:07,458
This isn't an interrogation.

456
00:36:07,548 --> 00:36:09,508
You'll be wasting your time.

457
00:36:09,588 --> 00:36:12,678
Telling Prosecutor Song to just watch

458
00:36:12,758 --> 00:36:15,218
seems to be a waste of manpower.

459
00:36:22,598 --> 00:36:25,348
Go to Kang. I'll take over from here.

460
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:36,158
He's Mr. Kang to you.

461
00:36:38,078 --> 00:36:40,238
Yes, ma'am.

462
00:36:41,038 --> 00:36:42,998
Go to Mr. Kang.

463
00:36:45,748 --> 00:36:46,788
That little…

464
00:36:58,178 --> 00:36:59,758
You know me, right?

465
00:37:00,848 --> 00:37:01,848
Right?

466
00:37:03,228 --> 00:37:06,148
Being tight-lipped won't end this torture.

467
00:37:07,438 --> 00:37:08,978
Are you dead or alive?

468
00:37:13,488 --> 00:37:14,568
So you're alive.

469
00:37:17,198 --> 00:37:20,618
Those people have no plans to kill you.

470
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:24,078
They'll keep you alive until you tell them
what they want to hear.

471
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:26,328
They'll keep toying with this.

472
00:37:32,758 --> 00:37:34,048
But I'm different.

473
00:37:34,968 --> 00:37:37,218
There's nothing I want to hear from you.

474
00:37:37,928 --> 00:37:40,678
I just want to verify
if what I know is true.

475
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:43,098
But I can't show you all my cards.

476
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:46,058
I'll just have to match mine with yours.

477
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:49,608
Simply put, I'm not going to be barbaric.

478
00:37:50,608 --> 00:37:53,278
I just hope you'll repay my kindness.

479
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,158
Is this Chairman Kwon's doing?

480
00:38:03,288 --> 00:38:04,578
Chairman Kwon Jaekyu.

481
00:38:05,538 --> 00:38:07,208
Haesong Group.

482
00:38:11,208 --> 00:38:15,048
Come on. He wouldn't do
something like this himself.

483
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:19,388
And who is he?

484
00:38:19,888 --> 00:38:21,098
He's the hitman, right?

485
00:38:25,978 --> 00:38:27,098
I don't know.

486
00:38:27,178 --> 00:38:29,188
First response.

487
00:38:29,938 --> 00:38:30,938
Is he on your team?

488
00:38:32,108 --> 00:38:35,898
You guys are really organized and skilled.

489
00:38:35,988 --> 00:38:38,668
That means you have an organization.
Could you have done this alone?

490
00:38:40,988 --> 00:38:43,698
You must move as a team.

491
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:47,708
And you guys are responsible
for killing Ms. Kim's parents, right?

492
00:38:51,378 --> 00:38:53,378
I doubt you committed the murders

493
00:38:53,458 --> 00:38:55,748
and cleaned up after yourself
single-handedly.

494
00:38:56,338 --> 00:38:59,048
You must have a task force team
and a clear-out team.

495
00:39:01,178 --> 00:39:02,178
What was it again?

496
00:39:03,098 --> 00:39:04,678
You know Lee Changwoo's case, right?

497
00:39:04,758 --> 00:39:08,428
It's been 22 years already.
It has a long history.

498
00:39:08,518 --> 00:39:10,138
You guys did that.

499
00:39:11,438 --> 00:39:13,188
I got this sketch from that incident.

500
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:17,938
I really don't know.

501
00:39:19,238 --> 00:39:20,698
Second response.

502
00:39:24,578 --> 00:39:27,538
You're reacting to him.
I wonder who he is.

503
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:37,758
I'm certain. The man in the composite
and Chairman Kang are related.

504
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:42,258
So he's still working for the chairman
to this day.

505
00:39:42,968 --> 00:39:44,218
<i>Where's home?</i>

506
00:39:45,848 --> 00:39:46,888
Where do you live?

507
00:39:49,138 --> 00:39:50,478
Are your parents alive?

508
00:39:51,688 --> 00:39:52,938
Do you have siblings?

509
00:39:57,268 --> 00:39:58,728
Third response.

510
00:40:09,658 --> 00:40:10,788
Stress.

511
00:40:16,588 --> 00:40:17,668
Done.

512
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:21,298
This is all the time I have.

513
00:40:21,468 --> 00:40:24,638
The technician will return
and resume the party.

514
00:40:26,428 --> 00:40:27,428
Wait.

515
00:40:37,978 --> 00:40:39,398
Do you have something to say?

516
00:40:41,988 --> 00:40:43,028
What…

517
00:41:00,048 --> 00:41:01,208
What time is it?

518
00:41:10,388 --> 00:41:12,268
You little bastard.

519
00:41:14,098 --> 00:41:15,438
<i>Darn it.</i>

520
00:41:17,268 --> 00:41:19,148
Jeez, we're done for.

521
00:41:20,438 --> 00:41:22,608
He endured 12 hours of torture.

522
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:25,488
Goodness, he wouldn't fall for mind games.

523
00:41:25,568 --> 00:41:28,698
Why do you think
he suddenly asked about the time?

524
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:30,578
It's a diversion of sorts.

525
00:41:31,158 --> 00:41:32,948
Telling us that torturing him is useless.

526
00:41:33,998 --> 00:41:36,498
No. He seemed desperate.

527
00:41:38,578 --> 00:41:40,038
Why was the time important?

528
00:41:40,128 --> 00:41:41,588
It's like a time bomb.

529
00:41:42,878 --> 00:41:45,588
He'll succeed as long as
he stays there until the bomb goes off.

530
00:41:45,668 --> 00:41:47,428
But since he's not a bomber,

531
00:41:48,218 --> 00:41:50,098
he's probably keeping track of time.

532
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:53,558
Keeping track? What does that mean?

533
00:41:53,638 --> 00:41:55,518
He has hope. Look.

534
00:41:55,598 --> 00:41:57,648
He's conscious of his breathing.

535
00:41:59,978 --> 00:42:03,028
That just shows that
he's trying to control himself.

536
00:42:04,608 --> 00:42:07,698
<i>He's already made up his mind
about whether to resist or surrender.</i>

537
00:42:09,448 --> 00:42:11,908
Since he chose the former,
he'll remain tight-lipped

538
00:42:12,408 --> 00:42:13,408
as long as he has hope.

539
00:42:15,288 --> 00:42:16,828
What hope?

540
00:42:17,788 --> 00:42:19,708
What do you think,
given that he's been abducted?

541
00:42:21,378 --> 00:42:24,248
Don't worry, sir.
I'm sure Mr. Lee is hanging in there.

542
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:25,898
Seeing how our headquarters is safe,

543
00:42:25,958 --> 00:42:27,928
he must be keeping his mouth shut.

544
00:42:29,718 --> 00:42:32,048
<i>He believes his colleagues
will come to his rescue.</i>

545
00:42:32,848 --> 00:42:34,428
That's what's keeping him alive.

546
00:42:35,348 --> 00:42:36,558
That's false hope.

547
00:42:37,058 --> 00:42:39,398
This safe house isn't so easy to find.

548
00:42:39,478 --> 00:42:42,268
And what if time runs out?

549
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:44,608
What could be on the other end of that?

550
00:42:45,438 --> 00:42:46,648
Suicide.

551
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:50,358
In the end, we're the ones
who are being chased by time, not him.

552
00:42:51,568 --> 00:42:54,828
If he kills himself,
we won't get anything out of it.

553
00:42:57,748 --> 00:43:00,418
<i>I don't know for sure
if he was the killer or not.</i>

554
00:43:00,998 --> 00:43:02,788
<i>But this is what my husband said.</i>

555
00:43:04,288 --> 00:43:07,418
<i>"My father killed someone with the Adamas.
And Lee Changwoo…</i>

556
00:43:08,088 --> 00:43:09,678
<i>was the one who took the fall."</i>

557
00:43:15,598 --> 00:43:18,098
<i>The man the witness saw
that night wasn't him.</i>

558
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:19,478
<i>It was someone else.</i>

559
00:43:21,438 --> 00:43:22,808
Chairman Kwon...

560
00:43:23,858 --> 00:43:26,438
may not be the killer.

561
00:43:31,908 --> 00:43:33,118
Mr. Ha?

562
00:43:43,458 --> 00:43:46,458
I wanted to get you out of here,
but I think it'll be difficult.

563
00:43:48,008 --> 00:43:49,008
Why?

564
00:43:49,798 --> 00:43:52,628
It's a long story. But first,

565
00:43:54,468 --> 00:43:58,308
I'll ask someone I know
to move your father to a safer hospital

566
00:43:59,218 --> 00:44:01,098
so that Ms. Kwon
can't threaten you anymore.

567
00:44:02,188 --> 00:44:05,358
They're with the police,
so don't worry and just trust them.

568
00:44:05,808 --> 00:44:08,228
The election will be over soon,
and you'll be out in no time.

569
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:11,358
But my dad has moved hospitals already.

570
00:44:13,198 --> 00:44:14,198
Where to?

571
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:15,818
Eunkook Medical Center.

572
00:44:16,658 --> 00:44:19,288
Ms. Eun seems like a decent person.

573
00:44:29,548 --> 00:44:30,588
What do you want?

574
00:44:32,718 --> 00:44:34,128
I have a favor to ask of you.

575
00:44:40,058 --> 00:44:42,978
I told her Ms. Kwon
was keeping my dad hostage,

576
00:44:43,058 --> 00:44:44,058
and she helped me out.

577
00:44:45,648 --> 00:44:46,978
You made a mistake.

578
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:50,898
What? Did I do something wrong?

579
00:44:51,688 --> 00:44:53,698
No. We can talk later.

580
00:44:54,198 --> 00:44:55,238
Mr. Ha!

581
00:45:05,168 --> 00:45:06,378
I like your dress.

582
00:45:07,378 --> 00:45:10,458
He got it for me,
but it wasn't to my liking.

583
00:45:11,628 --> 00:45:13,798
I'm glad it looks good on you.

584
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:23,558
Such a hopeless romantic.

585
00:45:27,768 --> 00:45:28,808
We need to talk.

586
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:32,568
Right now? As you can see,
I'm on my way out.

587
00:45:32,648 --> 00:45:33,818
It won't take long.

588
00:45:38,948 --> 00:45:41,658
Master, make sure you take
your medication on time.

589
00:45:41,908 --> 00:45:43,868
Don't skip any meals either.

590
00:45:43,948 --> 00:45:45,578
Force yourself to eat

591
00:45:45,658 --> 00:45:48,378
even if you don't have an appetite, okay?

592
00:45:48,998 --> 00:45:50,338
All right.

593
00:45:58,298 --> 00:45:59,298
Where's Hyesoo?

594
00:46:14,318 --> 00:46:17,358
Just cut to the chase.
The chairman is waiting for me.

595
00:46:20,698 --> 00:46:23,038
- Ms. Eun.
- You want to know who recommended you?

596
00:46:23,618 --> 00:46:25,138
I'm looking into it, so don't rush me.

597
00:46:25,198 --> 00:46:26,538
No, it's about Dongrim's father.

598
00:46:28,168 --> 00:46:31,038
- Ah.
- Thank you for helping,

599
00:46:31,838 --> 00:46:33,418
but he'll move to another hospital.

600
00:46:34,588 --> 00:46:37,548
What for?
Our hospital is the best one out there.

601
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:38,928
I'll take care of it.

602
00:46:39,008 --> 00:46:40,258
No!

603
00:46:41,088 --> 00:46:42,758
Why would you decide on your own?

604
00:46:43,508 --> 00:46:46,428
- Were you eavesdropping?
- You left in a hurry, so I followed you.

605
00:46:46,518 --> 00:46:47,808
My dad isn't going anywhere.

606
00:46:48,888 --> 00:46:50,478
- Dongrim.
- What?

607
00:46:53,568 --> 00:46:54,858
Excuse me, gentlemen.

608
00:46:56,938 --> 00:46:59,488
The reason why I helped him
is quite simple.

609
00:47:00,238 --> 00:47:01,318
The Adamas.

610
00:47:04,618 --> 00:47:05,908
You're familiar with it.

611
00:47:06,748 --> 00:47:09,248
Everyone knows
about that arrow with a diamond tip.

612
00:47:09,328 --> 00:47:10,328
Lee Changwoo.

613
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:16,048
Is he also famous?

614
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:19,968
- That's...
- You heard the voice recorder, didn't you?

615
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:23,718
- I was just...
- You must've realized it too.

616
00:47:25,428 --> 00:47:27,828
I realized the moment he came
and asked for my help at night.

617
00:47:27,888 --> 00:47:29,728
He must've heard everything.
"He must think

618
00:47:29,808 --> 00:47:32,438
that we're on the same side."

619
00:47:33,558 --> 00:47:34,858
But Dongrim,

620
00:47:35,938 --> 00:47:37,438
you were mistaken.

621
00:47:38,818 --> 00:47:41,658
I'll take great care of your father.

622
00:47:42,908 --> 00:47:45,408
But if you let Ms. Kwon
control you once again,

623
00:47:49,708 --> 00:47:51,328
I'll kill your father.

624
00:47:58,258 --> 00:48:00,298
Goodbye, then. I have dinner plans.

625
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:12,098
What's going on?
What is she talking about?

626
00:48:12,888 --> 00:48:14,518
- Dongrim.
- Let go of me!

627
00:48:15,148 --> 00:48:17,018
Don't try to squirm your way out of this.

628
00:48:17,108 --> 00:48:18,688
I have the right to know!

629
00:48:18,778 --> 00:48:21,818
My dad's life is on the line.
What on earth are you two scheming?

630
00:48:41,588 --> 00:48:42,918
- Ms. Kwon.
- What?

631
00:48:43,508 --> 00:48:45,508
Ms. Hyesoo isn't in her room either.

632
00:48:45,798 --> 00:48:46,888
Is that so?

633
00:49:03,698 --> 00:49:05,158
You were already here.

634
00:49:05,238 --> 00:49:07,698
Yes, I rushed a bit.

635
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:08,778
Mm.

636
00:49:30,058 --> 00:49:31,388
You've gone insane.

637
00:49:32,098 --> 00:49:35,268
- Lee Dongrim.
- I don't know. I didn't hear anything.

638
00:49:36,978 --> 00:49:38,358
You're the one who wanted to know.

639
00:49:38,438 --> 00:49:40,938
So it's my fault?

640
00:49:41,018 --> 00:49:43,318
That was before I knew
that you were committing theft.

641
00:49:43,398 --> 00:49:46,068
I don't want
to end up behind bars. Why should I?

642
00:49:46,698 --> 00:49:49,158
All because of your late father?

643
00:49:52,288 --> 00:49:55,158
I take back what I just said. I'm sorry.

644
00:49:56,498 --> 00:49:58,328
I didn't want to get you involved.

645
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:01,168
That's why I tried
to make you leave this place.

646
00:50:02,668 --> 00:50:04,088
- But things...
- Ah.

647
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:06,418
I'm starving.

648
00:50:08,048 --> 00:50:10,428
I'm famished.

649
00:50:14,138 --> 00:50:15,388
What are you guys up to?

650
00:50:17,228 --> 00:50:18,688
We were discussing our dinner menu.

651
00:50:18,768 --> 00:50:21,818
Gosh, you looked pretty serious
to be discussing the dinner menu.

652
00:50:21,898 --> 00:50:24,938
Because we should be.
We all eat three meals a day.

653
00:50:25,028 --> 00:50:26,028
Right.

654
00:50:26,858 --> 00:50:29,318
Mr. Ha, I have a question.

655
00:50:29,908 --> 00:50:33,738
I heard <i>Persona Non Grata</i>
was based on a true story.

656
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:36,908
Yes, it is, although I dramatized it.

657
00:50:37,498 --> 00:50:40,418
Does that mean
the lead character is a real person?

658
00:50:44,168 --> 00:50:45,208
Am I wrong?

659
00:50:46,628 --> 00:50:48,628
You're probably right.

660
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:56,468
Yes, he really exists.

661
00:50:57,058 --> 00:50:59,138
So he's a real police officer?

662
00:50:59,728 --> 00:51:02,688
No wonder. Mr. Choi said

663
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:07,068
it was a term for a police whistleblower.

664
00:51:07,988 --> 00:51:09,148
Mr. Kim.

665
00:51:10,448 --> 00:51:12,448
- Yes, sir?
- Playing hooky?

666
00:51:13,328 --> 00:51:14,328
No, sir.

667
00:51:15,538 --> 00:51:16,998
Patrol area three.

668
00:51:18,908 --> 00:51:20,328
I need to speak with you.

669
00:51:21,628 --> 00:51:23,748
I heard your new character loves to hunt.

670
00:51:27,008 --> 00:51:28,378
I have some advice for you.

671
00:51:31,798 --> 00:51:33,968
Go ahead. What is it?

672
00:51:35,308 --> 00:51:40,938
There's a security button that has never
been pressed under the Chairman's desk.

673
00:51:41,518 --> 00:51:42,518
A security button?

674
00:51:43,438 --> 00:51:45,608
<i>You know that button that banks have.</i>

675
00:51:46,148 --> 00:51:47,688
<i>The emergency SOS button.</i>

676
00:51:47,778 --> 00:51:50,608
He had that installed
under his desk from the start. But…

677
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:53,528
the fact that
it never set off an alarm means…

678
00:51:53,618 --> 00:51:56,698
There was either no emergency situation
or that button was for something else.

679
00:51:57,288 --> 00:51:59,038
But if it's indeed a security button…

680
00:52:09,628 --> 00:52:11,258
<i>Then I'll be caught red-handed.</i>

681
00:52:11,338 --> 00:52:12,758
It's a 50-50 chance.

682
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:15,388
It could be the device
that lowers the Adamas…

683
00:52:16,468 --> 00:52:17,638
or it could be an alarm.

684
00:52:20,228 --> 00:52:22,308
I'm going to steal it tonight.

685
00:52:22,388 --> 00:52:23,898
Darn it.

686
00:52:24,098 --> 00:52:26,658
I only told you so that
you wouldn't rush it and ruin everything.

687
00:52:27,268 --> 00:52:28,268
Wait for HQ's orders.

688
00:52:28,318 --> 00:52:30,028
No, it needs to happen today.

689
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:33,318
Will Ms. Kwon ever be away again?

690
00:52:34,358 --> 00:52:38,288
Do well while I'm gone.
Check up on the rest of the maids too.

691
00:52:38,368 --> 00:52:40,998
Don't worry, ma'am.

692
00:52:45,208 --> 00:52:47,918
Especially that writer.
Watch him at all times.

693
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:50,458
Yes, ma'am.

694
00:53:06,978 --> 00:53:07,978
Mr. Choi.

695
00:53:08,688 --> 00:53:10,858
Neither Ms. Kwon nor Chairman Kwon
is home today.

696
00:53:10,938 --> 00:53:12,898
- This is our chance.
- No.

697
00:53:15,158 --> 00:53:16,158
Then I'll do it alone.

698
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:18,548
We need permission from headquarters!

699
00:53:23,908 --> 00:53:25,208
Don't be mistaken.

700
00:53:25,288 --> 00:53:28,958
Joining hands with the SIH doesn't mean
I'll be following their orders.

701
00:53:31,298 --> 00:53:32,588
Tonight.

702
00:53:55,238 --> 00:53:59,028
Don't worry. I'm not pregnant.

703
00:54:01,528 --> 00:54:03,078
I just felt nauseous.

704
00:54:25,388 --> 00:54:26,888
Curse me if you want.

705
00:54:27,478 --> 00:54:28,978
I don't know sign language anyway.

706
00:54:54,748 --> 00:54:55,958
Hyunjo.

707
00:54:56,548 --> 00:54:57,588
Yes, sir.

708
00:54:57,668 --> 00:55:00,258
How are the plans
for the 80th-anniversary ceremony going?

709
00:55:00,338 --> 00:55:02,258
Will everything go as planned?

710
00:55:02,348 --> 00:55:05,388
Of course. Don't worry.

711
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:07,228
Make sure everything goes well.

712
00:55:08,058 --> 00:55:11,518
It'll be my retirement ceremony
as well as your inauguration ceremony.

713
00:55:11,598 --> 00:55:12,898
Yes, Father.

714
00:55:15,108 --> 00:55:16,228
Inauguration?

715
00:55:16,318 --> 00:55:18,898
Yes. I'm going to officially announce him

716
00:55:18,988 --> 00:55:20,778
as my successor that day.

717
00:55:25,158 --> 00:55:26,158
I see.

718
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:29,908
Won't you congratulate me?

719
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:33,248
Congratulations.

720
00:55:37,798 --> 00:55:40,178
Am I having problems again?

721
00:55:40,758 --> 00:55:43,678
Father, what's wrong? Are you okay?

722
00:55:43,758 --> 00:55:45,428
Yes, I'm fine.

723
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:48,428
Don't make a fuss.

724
00:55:55,898 --> 00:55:57,478
I listened to you

725
00:55:57,568 --> 00:56:00,568
and sent Ms. Kwon on an errand.

726
00:56:01,238 --> 00:56:02,988
I heard.

727
00:56:03,408 --> 00:56:05,988
I bet the house feels pretty vacant.

728
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:23,928
<i>Once Ms. Oh does the final check,</i>

729
00:56:24,218 --> 00:56:26,678
<i>the maids are forbidden
from entering the third floor.</i>

730
00:57:14,478 --> 00:57:15,648
This is it.

731
00:57:16,768 --> 00:57:17,938
<i>It's a 50-50 chance.</i>

732
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:20,318
<i>It could be the device
that lowers the Adamas…</i>

733
00:57:22,988 --> 00:57:24,398
<i>or it could be an alarm.</i>

734
00:57:33,288 --> 00:57:35,038
What? Tonight?

735
00:57:35,538 --> 00:57:37,788
What could I do?
He was adamant about doing it himself.

736
00:57:38,128 --> 00:57:41,588
Since today is the day you collect money,
it wouldn't look odd to see you here.

737
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:43,718
Hold on.

738
00:57:45,218 --> 00:57:47,048
What if Mr. Ha gets caught?

739
00:57:47,968 --> 00:57:50,508
Then radio the others.

740
00:57:50,598 --> 00:57:53,768
Ask for backup.
We need to leave an official record.

741
00:57:54,768 --> 00:57:57,728
Go inside the mansion and arrest him.

742
00:57:59,518 --> 00:58:01,518
- Arrest him?
- We need to cut him off.

743
00:58:04,488 --> 00:58:07,318
Then it'd be difficult
for his actions to be extenuated.

744
00:58:07,408 --> 00:58:09,698
Why should I care?

745
00:58:09,778 --> 00:58:13,198
No one should find out
that we're connected.

746
00:58:21,668 --> 00:58:22,708
Let's put on a show.

747
00:58:24,128 --> 00:58:26,298
- What show?
- You guys can't kill him.

748
00:58:27,128 --> 00:58:28,588
He knows that too.

749
00:58:28,678 --> 00:58:31,718
But not me. He knows nothing about me.

750
00:58:32,718 --> 00:58:33,718
So?

751
00:58:34,308 --> 00:58:36,308
- Prosecutor Song.
- It's just a show.

752
00:58:36,388 --> 00:58:39,518
A fake. Do you not have anesthetics?

753
00:58:41,018 --> 00:58:42,068
Do you?

754
00:58:56,908 --> 00:59:00,118
Do you know what this is?
A muscle relaxant.

755
00:59:00,748 --> 00:59:02,338
Once I inject you with this,

756
00:59:02,418 --> 00:59:04,958
your muscles will gradually relax.

757
00:59:08,008 --> 00:59:09,678
How can I cover that up…

758
00:59:17,978 --> 00:59:21,148
Your diaphragm,
which helps you breathe, will also relax.

759
00:59:28,778 --> 00:59:32,068
<i>Ultimately, you'll suffocate to death.</i>

760
00:59:34,868 --> 00:59:37,198
But you'll get the full experience

761
00:59:37,788 --> 00:59:39,248
since you'll be awake.

762
00:59:45,288 --> 00:59:46,378
Zoom in on camera three.

763
00:59:53,258 --> 00:59:57,348
Blink your eyes
if you remember who he is, okay?

764
01:00:00,558 --> 01:00:01,808
Before it's too late, okay?

765
01:00:17,158 --> 01:00:19,788
Hey, what are you doing?

766
01:00:19,868 --> 01:00:22,578
What am I doing? I'm doing my utmost best.

767
01:00:23,118 --> 01:00:25,668
What? Stop that.

768
01:00:25,748 --> 01:00:27,168
Stop that. Damn it!

769
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:28,878
Don't do that.

770
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:30,378
Don't do what?

771
01:00:31,968 --> 01:00:33,678
I don't care if you die.

772
01:00:33,758 --> 01:00:35,928
I'm sure the SIH would feel differently

773
01:00:36,678 --> 01:00:39,468
since they're trying
to connect this to Chairman Kwon.

774
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:45,518
But I'm just after my father's killer.

775
01:00:48,228 --> 01:00:52,198
And what does that have to do with me?

776
01:00:56,368 --> 01:00:57,868
Hey, don't do it.

777
01:00:58,988 --> 01:01:00,078
Don't do it.

778
01:01:04,708 --> 01:01:06,538
Prosecutor Song isn't bad.

779
01:01:06,828 --> 01:01:08,208
He almost had me fooled.

780
01:01:09,588 --> 01:01:11,128
Why am I so tense?

781
01:01:11,838 --> 01:01:12,918
Darn it.

782
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:14,628
Sir.

783
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:16,678
I'm not sure about this.

784
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:19,718
Maybe I should've done it instead.
What if he really dies?

785
01:01:26,348 --> 01:01:27,558
What do you mean?

786
01:01:28,608 --> 01:01:30,358
Isn't that just an anesthetic?

787
01:01:38,158 --> 01:01:41,288
What have you done?

788
01:01:43,498 --> 01:01:45,178
Do you think he could fool him
with a fake?

789
01:01:48,498 --> 01:01:51,338
Are you telling me that
it really is a muscle relaxant?

790
01:01:51,418 --> 01:01:53,378
Even truth serum didn't work on him.

791
01:01:53,458 --> 01:01:54,918
He needs to experience near-death...

792
01:01:55,008 --> 01:01:56,258
Are you insane?

793
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:59,258
Prosecutor Song isn't aware of this.

794
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:02,428
God damn it.

795

The security team isn't moving.

I'll do my best, ma'am.

It is marvelous.

{\an8}<i>Did they survive it?
Or were they spared?</i>

811
01:05:36,228 --> 01:05:38,398
{\an8}<i>They're the ones who raided the SIH.</i>

812
01:05:39,438 --> 01:05:43,028
