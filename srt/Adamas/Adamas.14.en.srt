1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:05,852
ADAMAS

2
00:00:13,959 --> 00:00:16,252
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:16,336 --> 00:00:18,880
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:18,964 --> 00:00:20,966
(tense music)

5
00:00:33,353 --> 00:00:36,356
(revving)

6
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:38,233
What…

7
00:00:39,526 --> 00:00:41,194
have you two done?

8
00:00:41,778 --> 00:00:43,154
Hang in there.

9
00:00:44,614 --> 00:00:45,740
We need someone

10
00:00:46,574 --> 00:00:48,660
who knows Team A the best.

11
00:00:49,536 --> 00:00:51,204
And that's you.

12
00:00:52,747 --> 00:00:55,792
I don't understand.

13
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:57,711
You're not going back to prison.

14
00:01:03,008 --> 00:01:05,385
Whatever your plan may be,
just don't do it.

15
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,512
It'll only put you in more danger.

16
00:01:07,595 --> 00:01:09,806
Once our relationship with you
was revealed,

17
00:01:10,765 --> 00:01:14,019
I didn't think we'd be safe anymore.

18
00:01:14,102 --> 00:01:15,812
And they actually made a move.

19
00:01:18,273 --> 00:01:19,858
I guess they figured

20
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:23,236
that Suhyeon and I are

21
00:01:24,404 --> 00:01:25,947
your Achilles' heel.

22
00:01:27,365 --> 00:01:30,618
What are you going to do?

23
00:01:31,286 --> 00:01:32,954
We will find the Adamas

24
00:01:33,455 --> 00:01:34,914
before Chairman Kwon does.

25
00:01:35,457 --> 00:01:37,375
What are you planning to do with it?

26
00:01:38,043 --> 00:01:40,128
(door opens)

27
00:01:49,596 --> 00:01:51,723
Did you enjoy your father-son reunion?

28
00:01:53,767 --> 00:01:56,311
Cho, you little…

29
00:01:56,394 --> 00:01:58,146
It's not that I like doing this.

30
00:01:58,563 --> 00:02:00,023
I'm just doing my job.

31
00:02:00,648 --> 00:02:02,400
I've grown attached to you from hatred

32
00:02:03,693 --> 00:02:07,155
so I'd feel bad to beat you up.

33
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,867
So instead of you today…

34
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,047
Let's get started, all right?

35
00:02:27,842 --> 00:02:29,177
How much more do we have to go?

36
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,470
SEOHEE: About five kilometers.

37
00:02:30,553 --> 00:02:32,180
Would it be Chairman Kwon's doing?

38
00:02:32,263 --> 00:02:34,599
He gave Woosin two days
to find the Adamas.

39
00:02:35,809 --> 00:02:37,894
There's still some time left, so why…

40
00:02:51,282 --> 00:02:52,283
Cho.

41
00:02:55,203 --> 00:02:56,246
Don't do this.

42
00:02:57,622 --> 00:02:58,873
Where's the Adamas?

43
00:02:58,957 --> 00:03:00,208
I said I don't know.

44
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,418
Go ask Lee Junkyung.

45
00:03:06,339 --> 00:03:07,423
Cho.

46
00:03:08,258 --> 00:03:13,388
(breathing heavily)

47
00:03:13,471 --> 00:03:14,722
-CHANGWOO: Cho!
-(Woosin groans)

48
00:03:19,644 --> 00:03:21,396
We're almost there. Drive faster.

49
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:22,522
Woosin…

50
00:03:23,731 --> 00:03:25,024
Please just stay alive.

51
00:03:26,985 --> 00:03:27,986
(groans)

52
00:03:28,069 --> 00:03:29,737
Where is the Adamas?

53
00:03:29,821 --> 00:03:31,072
You'll regret this later.

54
00:03:32,198 --> 00:03:33,324
Stop it.

55
00:03:35,326 --> 00:03:38,496
Cho!

56
00:03:43,376 --> 00:03:45,336
Think about your son.

57
00:03:46,754 --> 00:03:48,506
Where is the Adamas?

58
00:03:53,887 --> 00:03:56,222
(Woosin groaning)

59
00:03:59,392 --> 00:04:00,560
The signal is gone.

60
00:04:09,861 --> 00:04:10,737
(Cho grunts)

61
00:04:17,785 --> 00:04:19,787
(grunting)

62
00:04:30,423 --> 00:04:31,716
(tires screech)

63
00:04:41,142 --> 00:04:42,518
Let's split up.

64
00:04:42,727 --> 00:04:43,895
Let's go this way.

65
00:04:43,978 --> 00:04:45,438
-We'll go that way.
-Okay.

66
00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:04,791
He passed out.

67
00:05:13,049 --> 00:05:14,759
Your son passed out.

68
00:05:16,678 --> 00:05:19,430
It's because you won't tell me.

69
00:05:20,848 --> 00:05:22,558
Where is the Adamas?

70
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:25,520
(metal clinks)

71
00:05:27,188 --> 00:05:28,231
(gasps)

72
00:05:34,195 --> 00:05:35,363
(breathing heavily)

73
00:05:57,677 --> 00:05:59,012
Where are you, Woosin?

74
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:02,932
Prosecutor Song.

75
00:06:09,564 --> 00:06:10,815
I think we found him.

76
00:06:19,032 --> 00:06:21,492
EMERGENCY CONVOY

77
00:06:25,663 --> 00:06:26,748
(gasps)

78
00:06:29,334 --> 00:06:30,335
He's not in here.

79
00:06:31,836 --> 00:06:32,837
The guards are all dead.

80
00:06:34,881 --> 00:06:36,799
We found the prison guards dead
in the convoy.

81
00:06:37,091 --> 00:06:38,468
He might be somewhere nearby.

82
00:06:39,344 --> 00:06:40,762
(metal clanks)

83
00:06:50,396 --> 00:06:51,481
(clanking continues)

84
00:06:52,357 --> 00:06:53,399
One,

85
00:06:53,983 --> 00:06:54,942
two…

86
00:07:01,616 --> 00:07:03,034
(Changwoo grunts)

87
00:07:14,545 --> 00:07:15,755
Lee Changwoo.

88
00:07:18,841 --> 00:07:19,967
What happened?

89
00:07:23,679 --> 00:07:25,932
What are you doing? Who is that?

90
00:07:26,474 --> 00:07:27,558
It's a guy from Team A.

91
00:07:28,643 --> 00:07:29,685
He's dead.

92
00:07:34,148 --> 00:07:37,068
(groaning)

93
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:44,033
(Cho grunting)

94
00:07:45,535 --> 00:07:46,619
(groans)

95
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:54,043
(groaning continues)

96
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:55,795
(Woosin grunts)

97
00:08:00,383 --> 00:08:01,509
(groans)

98
00:08:13,896 --> 00:08:19,861
(Cho grunting)

99
00:08:25,533 --> 00:08:26,617

REPORT ON INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM

102
00:08:56,522 --> 00:09:02,987
(phone buzzing)

103
00:09:04,572 --> 00:09:05,490
Hello?

104
00:09:07,867 --> 00:09:09,243
Taesung shot who?

105
00:09:13,164 --> 00:09:14,790
Chairman Kwon was attacked.

106
00:09:25,301 --> 00:09:26,969
(Hyunjo panting)

107
00:09:27,053 --> 00:09:27,887
Sir.

108
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,722
How could you let this happen?

109
00:09:31,432 --> 00:09:33,267
-Hey.
-I apologize.

110
00:09:33,351 --> 00:09:34,769
Apologizing isn't enough.

111
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:37,271
I'm going to kill that bastard Choi.

112
00:09:39,357 --> 00:09:40,691
I made sure this didn't get out.

113
00:09:40,775 --> 00:09:44,487
It's not good at all for the company
if the chairman's condition goes public.

114
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:45,947
Good job.

115
00:09:47,698 --> 00:09:49,283
Make sure this doesn't get out.

116
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:50,409
Yes, sir.

117
00:09:54,205 --> 00:09:55,206
How did the operation go?

118
00:09:55,289 --> 00:09:56,749
It went well.

119
00:09:56,832 --> 00:09:57,833
(panting)

120
00:09:58,501 --> 00:09:59,669
Good.

121
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:02,755
Good job.

122
00:10:05,508 --> 00:10:08,511

(monitor beeping)

124
00:10:15,768 --> 00:10:16,727
(clears throat)

125
00:10:18,938 --> 00:10:22,108
Don't worry, Hyunjo.

126
00:10:22,775 --> 00:10:25,486
We'll prepare for the next operation
as we see how he recovers.

127
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:27,113
DIRECTOR EUN: He's over the hump.

128
00:10:28,948 --> 00:10:30,908
HYUNJO: He cannot pass away now.

129
00:10:31,242 --> 00:10:33,619
Of course not.
I'll do my best to save him.

130
00:10:33,703 --> 00:10:35,496
You don't have to do your best.

131
00:10:37,081 --> 00:10:38,249
What was that?

132
00:10:40,251 --> 00:10:42,211
All I need is for him to be breathing.

133
00:10:43,129 --> 00:10:44,839
The succession isn't a done deal.

134
00:10:46,966 --> 00:10:47,842
Okay.

135
00:10:58,853 --> 00:11:01,063
What took you so long to come?

136
00:11:01,147 --> 00:11:03,232
Ms. Yoon is acting like
she's the daughter-in-law

137
00:11:03,316 --> 00:11:05,401
as if she will take your place

138
00:11:05,484 --> 00:11:07,486
as soon as your father-in-law dies.

139
00:11:08,696 --> 00:11:09,989
I bet.

140
00:11:11,198 --> 00:11:14,827
You aren't thinking about doing
anything stupid, are you?

141
00:11:15,411 --> 00:11:18,497
Father, the chairman's office
is unoccupied.

142
00:11:19,457 --> 00:11:20,833
She can take my place.

143
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,129
Let's call an emergency board meeting.

144
00:11:25,212 --> 00:11:27,256
I have to finalize the succession.

145
00:11:28,507 --> 00:11:32,470
I'll have it arranged right away.
By the way, Hyunjo…

146
00:11:37,183 --> 00:11:38,059
(Hyunjo scoffs)

147
00:11:38,976 --> 00:11:41,729
Why didn't you just come
after Father passed away?

148
00:11:44,732 --> 00:11:46,359
So he managed to survive.

149
00:11:47,652 --> 00:11:49,070
Watch your mouth, Eun Hyesoo.

150
00:11:49,153 --> 00:11:50,696
You're still his daughter-in-law.

151
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,739
This is unexpected.

152
00:11:52,531 --> 00:11:56,118
I thought you wanted him dead
more than anyone else.

153
00:11:56,744 --> 00:12:00,665
(scoffs)
You're really clueless, aren't you?

154
00:12:00,748 --> 00:12:02,124
Once he passes away,

155
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,377
I'll have no reason to spare you.

156
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,629
You're the one who's clueless.

157
00:12:07,213 --> 00:12:09,465
HYESOO: It'll be most dangerous for you,
Kwon Hyunjo.

158
00:12:09,548 --> 00:12:11,008
Will you be all right on your own?

159
00:12:11,467 --> 00:12:14,011
People were submissive to you

160
00:12:14,095 --> 00:12:16,097
only because of your father.

161
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,473
You know that.

162
00:12:18,974 --> 00:12:20,017
Don't you agree, Ms. Yoon?

163
00:12:22,603 --> 00:12:24,522
I'll take care of those who rebel

164
00:12:25,314 --> 00:12:27,316
one after another.

165
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,902
Your turn will come soon.

166
00:12:33,489 --> 00:12:35,241
I'll be ready for it.

167
00:12:35,324 --> 00:12:36,325
(scoffs)

168
00:12:37,076 --> 00:12:39,328
Stop messing with me and get lost.

169
00:12:41,914 --> 00:12:42,998
Why?

170
00:12:45,584 --> 00:12:46,794
Are you afraid of me?

171
00:12:55,052 --> 00:12:58,347
Hey! I'll make sure to kill you!

172
00:12:58,931 --> 00:13:00,266
HYUNJO: I'll kill you first!

173
00:13:01,517 --> 00:13:02,560
Damn it!

174
00:13:06,397 --> 00:13:07,690
He's scared.

175
00:13:09,567 --> 00:13:12,820
That little…
(breathing heavily)

176
00:13:16,365 --> 00:13:18,826
Why now of all times?

177
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:20,578
Damn it.

178
00:13:28,794 --> 00:13:31,422
It's not the time for this.
You must make a move first.

179
00:13:32,423 --> 00:13:34,049
Take control of Team A.

180
00:13:40,014 --> 00:13:42,558
CHIEF JEONG:
Yes, sir. I've been brought up to speed.

181
00:13:43,225 --> 00:13:44,852
The guards are on standby.

182
00:13:47,104 --> 00:13:49,231
Yes, sir.
We'll go straight to the hospital.

183
00:13:50,274 --> 00:13:51,275
Yes, sir.

184
00:13:59,366 --> 00:14:01,702
DEPUTY PARK:
His name is Choi Taesung, an ex-cop.

185
00:14:01,786 --> 00:14:03,120
There's nothing shady about him.

186
00:14:03,204 --> 00:14:06,123
I wonder why that crazy punk
suddenly shot the chairman.

187
00:14:06,207 --> 00:14:09,710
Right. I guess I'm grateful to him though.

188
00:14:10,294 --> 00:14:12,630
He's the one who threw me
in the water, right?

189
00:14:16,425 --> 00:14:18,385
(panting)

190
00:14:20,387 --> 00:14:23,516
I was going to kill him,
but the heavens helped him.

191
00:14:24,266 --> 00:14:27,770
Link him to another case
and put out an APB on him.

192
00:14:27,937 --> 00:14:30,064
And look more into him.

193
00:14:30,731 --> 00:14:31,941
Yes, sir.

194
00:14:36,695 --> 00:14:37,696
(sighs)

195
00:14:41,617 --> 00:14:44,161
What about Sun?
Should I call her in and take care of her?

196
00:14:44,245 --> 00:14:47,331
Not yet. Keep her out in the field.

197
00:14:47,414 --> 00:14:49,124
And don't let her know that I'm alive.

198
00:14:49,667 --> 00:14:50,960
Yes, sir.

199
00:15:00,135 --> 00:15:02,471
The new master wants to see us.

200
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,391
We should go see him then.

201
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:10,729
I need to ask him
why he decided to spare me too.

202
00:15:10,813 --> 00:15:14,233
What happened at the reservoir…
You know it wasn't personal, right?

203
00:15:15,651 --> 00:15:19,071
I do. It'd be very bad if it was.

204
00:15:19,154 --> 00:15:21,532
Oh, jeez. Are you dwelling on it?

205
00:15:22,449 --> 00:15:23,909
The situation asked for it.

206
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:27,746
You know our job is to follow orders.

207
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,039
(Chief Jeong clears throat)

208
00:15:37,006 --> 00:15:38,799
You could've at least let me know.

209
00:15:40,342 --> 00:15:42,469
Then I would've played along.

210
00:15:47,975 --> 00:15:48,976
(scoffs)

211
00:15:54,398 --> 00:15:55,608
Oh, right.

212
00:15:56,442 --> 00:15:57,526
Mr. Jeong.

213
00:16:08,787 --> 00:16:10,080
(elevator dings)

214
00:16:22,551 --> 00:16:24,678
Don't let anyone in and stay on guard.

215
00:16:26,263 --> 00:16:28,265
(suspenseful music)

216
00:16:57,962 --> 00:16:59,964
(suspenseful music continues)

217
00:17:07,638 --> 00:17:08,973
-HYUKPIL: Taesung.
-(gasps)

218
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:14,103
EUNKOOK MEDICAL CENTER ENTRANCE

219
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:17,940
MR. CHOI: What is this?

220
00:17:18,607 --> 00:17:20,609
It's a new ID.
Use this to leave the country.

221
00:17:21,485 --> 00:17:22,403
(scoffs)

222
00:17:23,821 --> 00:17:24,905
No.

223
00:17:24,989 --> 00:17:27,992
Haesong will try to kill you first
whether Chairman Kwon wakes up or not.

224
00:17:28,075 --> 00:17:30,911
Actually, Team A might be
on the move already.

225
00:17:32,454 --> 00:17:34,206
This country isn't a place

226
00:17:34,289 --> 00:17:36,500
where you can be safe
after shooting Kwon Jaekyu.

227
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:37,501
(scoffs)

228
00:17:38,377 --> 00:17:40,546
I was prepared to die
when I pulled the trigger.

229
00:17:42,131 --> 00:17:43,716
And you want me to give up like this?

230
00:17:44,633 --> 00:17:46,760
-You'll end up dying for nothing.
-Mr. Kang.

231
00:17:46,844 --> 00:17:48,178
We are an organization. Follow my order.

232
00:17:48,262 --> 00:17:51,557
Sergeant Ko was killed.
Along with his entire family!

233
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,725
(Mr. Choi scoffs)

234
00:17:54,601 --> 00:17:55,936
Aren't you angry at all?

235
00:17:56,603 --> 00:17:59,148
We're always on the losing end,
always failing, and getting killed!

236
00:18:00,232 --> 00:18:03,193
Have you gotten used to it?

237
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:08,198
Do you know why Sergeant Ko died?

238
00:18:10,325 --> 00:18:12,411
He recently submitted a report
on Lee Changwoo.

239
00:18:12,494 --> 00:18:13,579
I heard it was your order.

240
00:18:14,246 --> 00:18:16,248
(somber music)

241
00:18:16,832 --> 00:18:18,250
He dug too deep,

242
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,377
knowing that his identity
could be exposed.

243
00:18:21,587 --> 00:18:23,422
I think that's how they got him.

244
00:18:29,011 --> 00:18:31,805
Yes. Not rage…

245
00:18:33,265 --> 00:18:35,267
but the sense of guilt
that you're feeling right now.

246
00:18:37,644 --> 00:18:39,521
I've felt it countless times.

247
00:18:39,605 --> 00:18:40,856
Have I gotten used to it?

248
00:18:44,443 --> 00:18:45,569
Of course not.

249
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:48,572
I just hold it in.

250
00:18:56,705 --> 00:18:57,748
(Hyukpil sighs)

251
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,250
Taesung.

252
00:19:01,502 --> 00:19:02,753
Let's stop now.

253
00:19:05,089 --> 00:19:07,466
If we don't stop here,
they will kill you too.

254
00:19:07,549 --> 00:19:09,218
I don't want to see you die as well.

255
00:19:15,265 --> 00:19:16,391
Hyukpil.

256
00:19:19,061 --> 00:19:20,729
I'm doing this for them.

257
00:19:22,481 --> 00:19:23,732
Those who died.

258
00:19:27,736 --> 00:19:31,949
If we just stop here,
their sacrifices will have been in vain.

259
00:19:34,118 --> 00:19:35,577
This is not revenge.

260
00:19:39,123 --> 00:19:41,041
It's the duty of those
who have yet to die.

261
00:19:51,051 --> 00:19:54,179
Has Mr. Kang decided
to take all the blame?

262
00:19:54,763 --> 00:19:55,848
Yes.

263
00:19:55,931 --> 00:19:59,059
They'll probably come up with anything
to send him to jail.

264
00:19:59,393 --> 00:20:02,187
I guess, like always.

265
00:20:04,398 --> 00:20:05,858
(tires screeching)

266
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:11,238
(guns cock)

267
00:20:12,906 --> 00:20:14,908
(suspenseful music)

268
00:20:19,246 --> 00:20:20,247
Hey!

269
00:20:20,998 --> 00:20:21,999
Sir.

270
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,209
(in English) Long time no see.

271
00:20:25,002 --> 00:20:26,128
(in Korean) What happened?

272
00:20:26,879 --> 00:20:28,338
A final gift from Mr. Kang.

273
00:20:31,175 --> 00:20:32,176
Go to headquarters.

274
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,389
Everything about the infiltration team
was cleaned out.

275
00:20:37,681 --> 00:20:39,349
I left four of the trustworthy ones.

276
00:20:39,933 --> 00:20:41,727
Since we have to protect
Prosecutor Song too.

277
00:20:42,686 --> 00:20:44,438
-Hyukpil.
-Go wrap it up.

278
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,585
I didn't think I'd see you again here.

279
00:21:18,055 --> 00:21:20,599
Right. In the end,

280
00:21:21,725 --> 00:21:23,936
you took it this far.

281
00:21:24,019 --> 00:21:24,937
It was

282
00:21:26,104 --> 00:21:28,065
because of you, Mr. Lee.

283
00:21:28,148 --> 00:21:31,276
I believed
that you were wrongfully charged.

284
00:21:31,443 --> 00:21:32,569
I followed that belief.

285
00:21:34,905 --> 00:21:35,948
However…

286
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,033
CHANGWOO: It's a guy from Team A.

287
00:21:39,368 --> 00:21:40,494
He's dead.

288
00:21:41,161 --> 00:21:42,663
SEOHEE: <i>Just who are you?</i>

289
00:21:43,664 --> 00:21:45,040
Who are you?

290
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:47,251
I did

291
00:21:48,335 --> 00:21:50,128
warn you from the start.

292
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,922
I told you to stop.

293
00:21:54,508 --> 00:21:55,759
Answer me.

294
00:21:57,469 --> 00:21:58,971
I have the right to know.

295
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:11,233
(whining)

296
00:22:31,586 --> 00:22:33,338
How long do we have to keep this up?

297
00:22:43,098 --> 00:22:44,057
(scoffs)

298
00:22:46,727 --> 00:22:47,602
(Suhyeon sighs)

299
00:22:50,522 --> 00:22:51,565
(door opens)

300
00:23:04,995 --> 00:23:06,455
Why didn't you tell me?

301
00:23:06,955 --> 00:23:09,333
-Tell you what?
-That Lee Changwoo was part of Team A.

302
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:13,378
How could you hide that from me?

303
00:23:14,379 --> 00:23:16,715
I found out yesterday.
I just didn't have the time to--

304
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:18,258
You should've told me right away.

305
00:23:19,509 --> 00:23:21,261
You should've told me at least.

306
00:23:22,387 --> 00:23:24,931
I put everything on the line
to prove his innocence.

307
00:23:25,015 --> 00:23:27,100
Even my parents died along the way.

308
00:23:27,434 --> 00:23:30,520
Nevertheless, I didn't give up
because I knew I was right.

309
00:23:30,604 --> 00:23:32,439
-Ms. Kim.
-To take Team A down,

310
00:23:32,522 --> 00:23:34,232
I got kidnapped, wore an explosive vest,

311
00:23:34,316 --> 00:23:37,611
and had multiple brushes with death.
After all that I went through,

312
00:23:39,946 --> 00:23:41,948
that man turned out to be
a former Team A agent too.

313
00:23:42,532 --> 00:23:44,743
Calm down, Ms. Kim.
You've never been wrong.

314
00:23:45,369 --> 00:23:46,953
Everything started with Team Leader Lee,

315
00:23:47,037 --> 00:23:49,206
and this won't end unless we get him.

316
00:23:49,289 --> 00:23:50,916
Why must we get Lee?

317
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:55,379
For your real father's sake?

318
00:23:57,631 --> 00:24:00,926
Did you keep this from me too?
Did you just not have the time to tell me?

319
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,638
It didn't matter.

320
00:24:06,181 --> 00:24:07,891
I have only one father.

321
00:24:07,974 --> 00:24:10,227
And I'm trying to get the man
who actually killed him

322
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:12,437
by making use of Team Leader Lee
and Lee Changwoo.

323
00:24:13,271 --> 00:24:14,398
My real father?

324
00:24:16,274 --> 00:24:18,568
That doesn't mean anything to me now.

325
00:24:33,542 --> 00:24:35,252
Prosecutor Song is right.

326
00:24:36,128 --> 00:24:38,213
I will do what I can

327
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:42,259
and once everything is over,
I'll go back to where I belong.

328
00:24:42,342 --> 00:24:44,761
To prison? Of course.

329
00:24:45,262 --> 00:24:46,888
I'm going to reveal it all.

330
00:24:46,972 --> 00:24:49,474
Just what you did under Chairman Kwon.

331
00:24:51,143 --> 00:24:52,602
MR. CHOI: I was looking for you guys.

332
00:24:56,648 --> 00:24:57,983
Lieutenant Choi Taesung?

333
00:24:58,442 --> 00:25:00,193
That's right, Prosecutor Song.

334
00:25:01,403 --> 00:25:04,030
You must be Ms. Kim Seohee.

335
00:25:07,451 --> 00:25:08,535
And you're Lee Changwoo?

336
00:25:09,786 --> 00:25:11,496
MR. CHOI: You're like a deity to me.

337
00:25:12,038 --> 00:25:14,833
A savior who suddenly showed up
to my rescue.

338
00:25:17,752 --> 00:25:20,297
As you probably heard,
the SIH was disbanded.

339
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,966
A few of my juniors and you three

340
00:25:23,049 --> 00:25:25,677
are the only ones left.
And I'll be joining you as of today.

341
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:31,975
(Mr. Choi sighs)
So what's the plan?

342
00:25:32,601 --> 00:25:33,518
(Suhyeon scoffs)

343
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:40,859
Mr. Lee knows more about Team A
than any of us here.

344
00:25:41,234 --> 00:25:44,529
SUHYEON: We'll start from the past
to find any possible clues.

345
00:25:44,613 --> 00:25:47,115
Team A's black site is what we're after.

346
00:25:47,449 --> 00:25:50,368
By the way, how did you come here?

347
00:25:50,827 --> 00:25:52,037
Did Haesongwon fire you?

348
00:25:52,829 --> 00:25:54,289
I left before they fired me.

349
00:25:55,665 --> 00:25:57,209
I shot Chairman Kwon.

350
00:25:59,586 --> 00:26:01,129
I failed to kill him though.

351
00:26:02,297 --> 00:26:03,715
You shot him?

352
00:26:03,798 --> 00:26:05,550
I should have done it sooner.

353
00:26:05,634 --> 00:26:07,177
I should have just gunned them all down.

354
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,262
(tense music)

355
00:26:14,434 --> 00:26:15,393
(grunts)

356
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:22,943
(breathing heavily)

357
00:26:29,199 --> 00:26:31,535
MR. CHOI: Don't just stand there.
Each of you try holding one.

358
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,495
You have to get used to it now.

359
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,542
What do you suggest we do with these guns?

360
00:26:38,625 --> 00:26:40,919
What else would you do with guns
other than kill people?

361
00:26:42,796 --> 00:26:45,131
MR. CHOI:
If you feel unsure, back out now.

362
00:26:47,968 --> 00:26:51,054
In our line of work,
we have to cross the line sometimes.

363
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:53,932
Think about what happened
every time we hesitated.

364
00:26:56,726 --> 00:26:58,770
That is why Mr. Kang failed.

365
00:26:59,354 --> 00:27:01,481
He acted like Team A to get them.

366
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:04,067
The SIH has to be themselves.

367
00:27:07,696 --> 00:27:08,780
What, by following the law?

368
00:27:09,364 --> 00:27:11,032
MR. CHOI: Would that make us be ourselves?

369
00:27:11,741 --> 00:27:15,412
We risked our lives to get them,
and they were freed for lack of evidence.

370
00:27:15,495 --> 00:27:17,872
We took them to court,
and they were found not guilty.

371
00:27:18,999 --> 00:27:21,418
In the meantime, my colleagues got killed,

372
00:27:21,501 --> 00:27:23,086
and the team was disbanded completely.

373
00:27:23,587 --> 00:27:25,088
I'm done with that.

374
00:27:26,214 --> 00:27:27,716
-That's enough.
-Prosecutor Song.

375
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,886
Make a choice.

376
00:27:33,138 --> 00:27:36,099
Go back to being a prosecutor
who cares so much about the law,

377
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:38,059
or join hands with me.

378
00:27:43,148 --> 00:27:44,316
Prosecutor Song.

379
00:27:51,823 --> 00:27:52,741
SUHYEON: I know.

380
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,036
I understand what you mean, Ms. Kim.

381
00:27:57,454 --> 00:27:59,789
But these people are ready
to cross the line.

382
00:27:59,873 --> 00:28:02,250
And you're against it.
That's the only difference.

383
00:28:02,334 --> 00:28:04,169
In the end, we share the same purpose.

384
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:08,632
So are you saying we should all join hands
and cross the line together?

385
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:11,259
Yes, if we must.

386
00:28:12,886 --> 00:28:14,596
Once we do, there will be no turning back.

387
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:16,014
We've tried everything else.

388
00:28:16,097 --> 00:28:17,807
-If there's another way--
-WOOSIN: There is.

389
00:28:21,394 --> 00:28:22,562
There is another way.

390
00:28:27,203 --> 00:28:30,373
It's very simple. We just need to get Lee.

391
00:28:30,957 --> 00:28:32,834
-Then the retrial--
-That bastard is dead.

392
00:28:34,252 --> 00:28:35,587
I threw him in the water myself.

393
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:36,921
No.

394
00:28:37,922 --> 00:28:39,215
He's still alive.

395
00:28:40,049 --> 00:28:41,384
HYESOO: <i>Lee Changwoo.</i>

396
00:28:41,468 --> 00:28:42,844
Don't you want to save him?

397
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,054
How?

398
00:28:45,138 --> 00:28:47,056
You'll have to tell me.

399
00:28:48,308 --> 00:28:49,934
You seem to know how.

400
00:28:51,728 --> 00:28:54,606
The real culprit must be caught
in order to save Lee Changwoo.

401
00:28:54,689 --> 00:28:56,774
You don't mean I should catch him, do you?

402
00:28:59,027 --> 00:29:01,905
Chairman Kwon destroyed the Adamas
that had the bloodstain on it.

403
00:29:02,489 --> 00:29:05,033
All the case materials are gone too.
Now the only thing left is…

404
00:29:05,116 --> 00:29:07,452
-The real culprit.
-That's right.

405
00:29:07,952 --> 00:29:11,331
Chairman Kwon will try to kill
Team Leader Lee.

406
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,167
You have to save him.

407
00:29:17,337 --> 00:29:20,006
Save him and hand him over to me.

408
00:29:23,676 --> 00:29:24,802
I made a deal.

409
00:29:24,886 --> 00:29:26,930
Are you crazy?

410
00:29:27,013 --> 00:29:29,265
Why did you let him survive
when he fully deserved to die?

411
00:29:29,349 --> 00:29:30,558
SUHYEON: Just why?

412
00:29:31,059 --> 00:29:32,769
Let go of me. You crazy fool.

413
00:29:32,852 --> 00:29:35,563
You should've just left him to die!

414
00:29:35,647 --> 00:29:37,941
If he's dead, the real culprit
will never be revealed.

415
00:29:38,024 --> 00:29:41,027
If killing him was enough, I wouldn't have
gone to that house in the first place.

416
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:43,821
Shut up.
That bastard killed so many people.

417
00:29:43,905 --> 00:29:46,366
So we must get him
and make him pay the price.

418
00:29:46,449 --> 00:29:50,078
You stopped him
from paying the price, you idiot!

419
00:29:50,578 --> 00:29:52,247
Let go. Let go of me.

420
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:53,623
SUHYEON: Let go!

421
00:29:57,377 --> 00:29:59,128
-Let go of me!
-Calm down!

422
00:29:59,963 --> 00:30:01,297
How can I calm down now?

423
00:30:01,381 --> 00:30:03,716
-Let go. I'm going to teach him a lesson.
-Prosecutor Song.

424
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,969
If you don't stop,
I'll take you out of our operation!

425
00:30:08,054 --> 00:30:09,847
-What?
-Listen carefully.

426
00:30:09,931 --> 00:30:11,683
That reporter is right.

427
00:30:11,766 --> 00:30:14,477
We're about to cross
the point of no return.

428
00:30:14,561 --> 00:30:18,189
You could get killed,
but you could kill someone too.

429
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:19,440
Are you okay with that?

430
00:30:20,358 --> 00:30:22,819
Are you asking
if I'm okay with killing people?

431
00:30:25,071 --> 00:30:26,948
Of course I'm not okay with it.

432
00:30:33,204 --> 00:30:34,581
Will you stop hugging me now?

433
00:30:36,249 --> 00:30:37,166
Damn it.

434
00:30:42,005 --> 00:30:46,092
All right, let's do this.
We have to see it through.

435
00:30:47,051 --> 00:30:48,219
Gosh, it's hot.

436
00:30:49,512 --> 00:30:51,222
You made a mistake.

437
00:30:51,806 --> 00:30:53,600
You should've killed him when you could.

438
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,269
Where is the Adamas?

439
00:30:56,352 --> 00:30:57,854
Did that woman tell you

440
00:30:57,937 --> 00:31:01,357
that she'd hand Team Leader Lee over
in exchange for the Adamas?

441
00:31:01,941 --> 00:31:04,736
No, she's going to kill you.

442
00:31:04,819 --> 00:31:06,487
That's not going to happen.

443
00:31:06,571 --> 00:31:08,281
Do you trust her?

444
00:31:09,532 --> 00:31:11,159
We will find the Adamas

445
00:31:11,242 --> 00:31:13,870
once Team A is destroyed.

446
00:31:14,746 --> 00:31:16,331
CHANGWOO: It won't be too late.

447
00:31:16,789 --> 00:31:20,209
But now, it will only make things
more dangerous.

448
00:31:20,293 --> 00:31:23,504
(breathing heavily)

449
00:31:25,048 --> 00:31:26,007
(Woosin groans)

450
00:31:32,639 --> 00:31:34,724
Hold on. Wait, Mr. Ha.

451
00:31:35,433 --> 00:31:37,852
Don't come close to me. Stay away.

452
00:31:42,482 --> 00:31:44,359
Tell us where the Adamas is.

453
00:31:44,442 --> 00:31:46,694
-Mr. Ha.
-I'm only trying to end this fight.

454
00:31:46,778 --> 00:31:48,946
What are you doing? Put the gun down.

455
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:51,741
That gun is loaded.
Please calm down, Mr. Ha.

456
00:31:57,413 --> 00:32:01,125
If it were someone from Team A
pointing this gun at you,

457
00:32:03,294 --> 00:32:04,962
you'd be dead already.

458
00:32:06,464 --> 00:32:09,258
Are you going to let this repeat
over and over again?

459
00:32:12,053 --> 00:32:13,262
There will be a moment

460
00:32:14,263 --> 00:32:17,141
when someone points a gun at Suhyeon.

461
00:32:19,352 --> 00:32:21,604
Why don't you know that? Why?

462
00:32:22,105 --> 00:32:24,107
(suspenseful music)

463
00:32:28,695 --> 00:32:29,946
Put the gun down.

464
00:32:33,366 --> 00:32:35,243
Lee Changwoo, put the gun down.

465
00:32:35,326 --> 00:32:36,994
Where is the Adamas?

466
00:32:37,078 --> 00:32:38,788
(gunshot)

467
00:32:39,455 --> 00:32:40,748
Why that darn…

468
00:32:45,002 --> 00:32:46,045
What's going on?

469
00:32:50,633 --> 00:32:51,718
(panting)

470
00:32:54,846 --> 00:32:55,972
Did you just shoot Woosin?

471
00:32:58,099 --> 00:33:01,561
This is what we're going to do.

472
00:33:08,735 --> 00:33:11,738
You don't have to prove yourself
because we already know you're a bad guy.

473
00:33:12,947 --> 00:33:14,907
So knock it off, damn it.

474
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,292
Jeez.

475
00:33:26,878 --> 00:33:30,047
Woosin and Ms. Kim, stay out of this.

476
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:33,426
-Prosecutor Song.
-Can you hold a gun?

477
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:41,184
You told me
the path I chose was the right one.

478
00:33:42,018 --> 00:33:44,395
Let's each do what we can.

479
00:33:45,146 --> 00:33:46,439
I'll back out here.

480
00:33:53,988 --> 00:33:55,031
SUHYEON: Woosin.

481
00:33:59,327 --> 00:34:01,412
Don't be upset
over your older brother telling you off.

482
00:34:02,789 --> 00:34:04,582
I sent a voice recording to your phone.

483
00:34:04,665 --> 00:34:06,000
The interview with Lee Changwoo.

484
00:34:07,335 --> 00:34:08,711
Are you really going to stay?

485
00:34:09,796 --> 00:34:12,632
If he had hidden the Adamas,
it must have been that night.

486
00:34:13,257 --> 00:34:16,594
Find the Adamas
while I take Team Leader Lee down.

487
00:34:25,937 --> 00:34:26,938
Prosecutor Song.

488
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:31,192
(somber music)

489
00:34:40,201 --> 00:34:41,369
Take care of yourself.

490
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,086
I'll see you again.

491
00:34:55,466 --> 00:34:57,468
(somber music continues)

492
00:35:13,025 --> 00:35:14,318
We're from the head office.

493
00:35:14,402 --> 00:35:17,321
We'll be guarding the chairman
as of this moment.

494
00:35:39,635 --> 00:35:43,472
What on earth is going on?

495
00:36:12,293 --> 00:36:13,544
CHIEF JEONG: We brought him.

496
00:36:23,012 --> 00:36:24,221
Good job.

497
00:36:26,015 --> 00:36:27,808
You two can wait outside for a bit.

498
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,061
Pardon?

499
00:36:30,645 --> 00:36:32,605
I have something to talk about with him.

500
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:36,692
Yes, ma'am.

501
00:36:43,532 --> 00:36:46,619
Should I thank you first?
You saved my life.

502
00:36:47,703 --> 00:36:49,205
The pleasure is mine.

503
00:36:49,997 --> 00:36:52,416
You could be saving me someday.

504
00:36:53,834 --> 00:36:55,002
By that, you mean…

505
00:36:55,086 --> 00:36:57,546
Chairman Kwon tried to get rid of Team A.

506
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,632
He probably thought they were dangerous

507
00:36:59,715 --> 00:37:02,385
because they'd get out of control
once his son took over.

508
00:37:02,468 --> 00:37:04,804
-You saw through him.
-But I'm different.

509
00:37:05,221 --> 00:37:08,683
I'll accept Team A as my partner.

510
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:11,477
(chuckles)

511
00:37:15,147 --> 00:37:17,316
Team A as your partner?

512
00:37:17,775 --> 00:37:20,820
Team A's partner is the owner of Haesong.

513
00:37:21,862 --> 00:37:23,906
-You know that, don't you?
-Yes.

514
00:37:24,573 --> 00:37:25,908
That's why I called you in.

515
00:37:27,702 --> 00:37:29,829
TEAM LEADER LEE:
You want me to kill Chairman Kwon?

516
00:37:29,912 --> 00:37:30,913
HYESOO: No.

517
00:37:32,832 --> 00:37:34,333
If it were Chairman Kwon I wanted dead,

518
00:37:35,292 --> 00:37:37,378
I wouldn't have to step in.

519
00:37:42,049 --> 00:37:44,677
Then who do you want me to kill?

520
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,388
What do you think
the biggest threat to Haesong is?

521
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,181
It's…

522
00:37:52,893 --> 00:37:54,186
Wow.

523
00:37:58,024 --> 00:37:59,108
The SIH?

524
00:37:59,567 --> 00:38:01,485
I want them gone without a trace

525
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:05,614
as soon as possible.

526
00:38:07,074 --> 00:38:10,119
(laughing)

527
00:38:10,202 --> 00:38:13,706
But why must I do that?

528
00:38:13,789 --> 00:38:17,126
I know I should repay you,
but you're asking for too much.

529
00:38:18,127 --> 00:38:20,629
I'm not that faithful, you see.

530
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:25,426
What is it that you want?

531
00:38:26,302 --> 00:38:27,344
I'm not sure.

532
00:38:30,264 --> 00:38:31,766
(sighs)

533
00:38:32,308 --> 00:38:33,350
There is

534
00:38:34,602 --> 00:38:37,396
this bastard I'm dying to kill.

535
00:38:39,065 --> 00:38:40,107
Oh.

536
00:38:41,525 --> 00:38:43,694
Maybe you can help me.

537
00:38:45,905 --> 00:38:47,031
That's easy.

538
00:38:50,367 --> 00:38:52,411
I need to check one last thing.

539
00:38:55,581 --> 00:38:58,584
Team A was obviously involved
in Minjo's death.

540
00:39:00,127 --> 00:39:01,337
Who was it?

541
00:39:03,589 --> 00:39:05,424
The one who got the order
from Kwon Hyunjo.

542
00:39:09,595 --> 00:39:12,723
That order wasn't
officially given to Team A.

543
00:39:13,224 --> 00:39:16,894
The order to kill
Chairman Kwon's dearest second son

544
00:39:16,977 --> 00:39:19,855
was given directly by Kwon Hyunjo

545
00:39:20,689 --> 00:39:24,860
to the one who could neglect all this
without reporting it to the chairman.

546
00:39:29,949 --> 00:39:31,033
Sun.

547
00:39:39,083 --> 00:39:40,751
Is he alive or dead?

548
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:42,169
Hey.

549
00:39:43,379 --> 00:39:44,672
Come out.

550
00:39:54,473 --> 00:39:57,059
Why did you ask for me?
He's half dead already.

551
00:39:57,476 --> 00:39:59,603
You can easily kill him yourself.

552
00:39:59,687 --> 00:40:01,856
Stop talking like a lunatic.

553
00:40:02,106 --> 00:40:03,065
Do something for me.

554
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,409
-I don't want to.
-(scoffs)

555
00:40:14,118 --> 00:40:15,828
You'd better think carefully.

556
00:40:15,911 --> 00:40:17,079
Mr. Lee is dead.

557
00:40:17,163 --> 00:40:19,790
Mr. Jeong may be back in league
with Eun Hyesoo anytime.

558
00:40:20,875 --> 00:40:22,334
That woman is going to kill you.

559
00:40:22,418 --> 00:40:26,046
Oh, I can't wait.
She's pretty when she gets mad.

560
00:40:27,548 --> 00:40:31,343
But she might kill you first.

561
00:40:31,427 --> 00:40:32,303
(Hyunjo scoffs)

562
00:40:32,887 --> 00:40:33,971
She can't kill me.

563
00:40:34,054 --> 00:40:35,764
You asked for me
because you're scared, no?

564
00:40:36,348 --> 00:40:38,017
No, I won't do it.

565
00:40:42,396 --> 00:40:43,856
Are you crazy? Should I kill you now?

566
00:40:43,939 --> 00:40:45,024
Yoon Sun!

567
00:40:47,985 --> 00:40:49,445
Help us.

568
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:53,866
(scoffs)

569
00:41:00,122 --> 00:41:02,291
Look who's crazier.

570
00:41:04,585 --> 00:41:06,629
You really have lost your mind,
haven't you?

571
00:41:06,712 --> 00:41:07,546
Help you?

572
00:41:11,383 --> 00:41:12,927
Did you help me then?

573
00:41:14,386 --> 00:41:17,056
SUN: <i>After deciding that
we should die together,</i>

574
00:41:17,139 --> 00:41:18,641
<i>you gave us milk laced with pesticides.</i>

575
00:41:19,058 --> 00:41:21,977
<i>But you got scared and backed away.</i>

576
00:41:25,356 --> 00:41:28,192
Help me, Jin.

577
00:41:29,068 --> 00:41:30,194
Please.

578
00:41:30,277 --> 00:41:32,154
SUN: <i>Did you help Yoon Mi</i>

579
00:41:32,947 --> 00:41:34,448
<i>as she lay there dying?</i>

580
00:41:39,036 --> 00:41:42,206
I'm sorry. Back then…

581
00:41:43,916 --> 00:41:45,876
I can help you with only one thing.

582
00:41:47,711 --> 00:41:49,129
Your death.

583
00:41:52,758 --> 00:41:53,842
Don't forget.

584
00:41:58,472 --> 00:42:01,141
I'll give you anything you want.

585
00:42:08,565 --> 00:42:09,733
Anything I want?

586
00:42:09,817 --> 00:42:11,151
Whatever it is.

587
00:42:17,157 --> 00:42:18,867
No going back on your word.

588
00:42:24,707 --> 00:42:25,874
CASE NUMBER

589
00:42:25,958 --> 00:42:27,960
MAN: This is everything we have on Team A.

590
00:42:28,502 --> 00:42:30,754
It's more than I thought.

591
00:42:30,838 --> 00:42:32,047
Not at all.

592
00:42:32,298 --> 00:42:34,717
They hardly leave any trace.

593
00:42:35,592 --> 00:42:37,011
And Haesong is behind them,

594
00:42:37,094 --> 00:42:39,513
so we couldn't even access
many of the materials.

595
00:42:39,596 --> 00:42:41,807
So if we dig into these again,

596
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:45,394
we can find the black site
that you know of, is that right?

597
00:42:45,477 --> 00:42:47,521
Yes, probably.

598
00:42:47,604 --> 00:42:49,273
It has to be a must, not an assumption.

599
00:42:50,316 --> 00:42:52,985
We're running out of time and chances.

600
00:42:53,068 --> 00:42:56,280
Mr. Lee Changwoo was one of them
more than 30 years ago.

601
00:42:56,363 --> 00:42:58,782
It wouldn't be easy to get
any meaningful information from him.

602
00:43:02,411 --> 00:43:03,704
I see you're all here.

603
00:43:07,291 --> 00:43:10,127
Has there been any progress?
Are these about Team A?

604
00:43:11,378 --> 00:43:12,838
It's a lot.

605
00:43:14,048 --> 00:43:15,758
You guys must've worked really hard.

606
00:43:15,841 --> 00:43:18,177
You twins have the same rude attitude.

607
00:43:20,179 --> 00:43:21,055
(table pounds)

608
00:43:22,014 --> 00:43:23,307
What's that?

609
00:43:23,766 --> 00:43:25,351
I was going to stay with Woosin

610
00:43:26,977 --> 00:43:28,312
because I was worried.

611
00:43:31,231 --> 00:43:33,233
But it looks like I'll be staying here.

612
00:43:40,991 --> 00:43:41,950
SUHYEON: Put these on.

613
00:43:45,454 --> 00:43:47,831
You shouldn't go after Team A
in those dirty clothes.

614
00:44:06,642 --> 00:44:08,143
Where is the Adamas?

615
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,937
(gunshot)

616
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:10,938
(groans)

617
00:44:23,742 --> 00:44:26,912
That looks painful.
Maybe you should go see a doctor.

618
00:44:28,997 --> 00:44:30,374
It's bearable.

619
00:44:30,457 --> 00:44:32,209
You need to treat your wounds properly.

620
00:44:32,292 --> 00:44:34,545
I'm really okay. By the way,

621
00:44:34,628 --> 00:44:37,965
we may find it uncomfortable,
but it'd be safe to be together.

622
00:44:38,048 --> 00:44:39,967
That way, Suhyeon would be at ease too.

623
00:44:40,801 --> 00:44:42,719
All right, I'll stay with you.

624
00:44:50,394 --> 00:44:52,396
Mr. Ha, why are you so late?

625
00:44:52,479 --> 00:44:55,107
(Dongrim gasps)
DONGRIM: Mr. Ha!

626
00:44:57,401 --> 00:44:59,236
-Let's go inside.
-Okay.

627
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:03,198
(Dongrim groans)

628
00:45:06,869 --> 00:45:09,079
(water running)

629
00:45:12,624 --> 00:45:13,542
(groans)

630
00:45:16,462 --> 00:45:17,588
(groaning continues)

631
00:45:22,551 --> 00:45:24,553
(solemn music)

632
00:45:34,146 --> 00:45:35,272
(sighs)

633
00:45:39,526 --> 00:45:43,530
SUHYEON: <i>How in the world did my father
fall victim to murder?</i>

634
00:45:45,949 --> 00:45:47,284
<i>Mr. Lee.</i>

635
00:45:48,702 --> 00:45:49,870
CHANGWOO: <i>It was all</i>

636
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:52,456
<i>due to my greed.</i>

637
00:45:54,708 --> 00:45:57,586
The black site manages their funds
as follows.

638
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:01,673
They found an organization
and shower it with donations.

639
00:46:01,757 --> 00:46:04,760
Half of the money is used
to maintain Team A's base.

640
00:46:04,843 --> 00:46:07,763
And the other half is used to construct
a building under Haesong's name.

641
00:46:07,846 --> 00:46:10,098
The black site doesn't last long
for security reasons.

642
00:46:10,182 --> 00:46:11,725
They don't stay for long in one place.

643
00:46:11,808 --> 00:46:13,310
Once the building is done
serving its purpose,

644
00:46:13,393 --> 00:46:16,522
they bribe someone with it
in case it's worthy.

645
00:46:16,605 --> 00:46:18,857
Otherwise, they blow it up.

646
00:46:20,275 --> 00:46:23,487
They often set up a base
in a prayer house before

647
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:26,823
because it was in a secluded area

648
00:46:27,783 --> 00:46:29,076
with lots of strangers coming by.

649
00:46:30,536 --> 00:46:33,705
SUHYEON: <i>My father went to that house
because of the picture?</i>

650
00:46:34,122 --> 00:46:35,958
<i>Why didn't you tell the truth?</i>

651
00:46:36,041 --> 00:46:38,502
<i>The real culprit could've been caught,
so why?</i>

652
00:46:39,878 --> 00:46:41,964
CHANGWOO: <i>Chairman Kwon</i>

653
00:46:42,047 --> 00:46:44,508
<i>didn't know that it was fake.</i>

654
00:46:46,051 --> 00:46:48,136
SUHYEON:
<i>All right. This is the final question.</i>

655
00:46:49,596 --> 00:46:51,348
<i>Where is the real Adamas?</i>

656
00:47:06,196 --> 00:47:07,948
I brought this from home.

657
00:47:12,286 --> 00:47:13,537
Do you want some?

658
00:47:19,167 --> 00:47:22,004
(grunts)
Now I feel less sleepy.

659
00:47:24,423 --> 00:47:25,716
REPORT ON LEE CHANGWOO

660
00:47:25,799 --> 00:47:28,844
WRITTEN BY KO CHULMIN

661
00:47:30,929 --> 00:47:32,472
BURGLARY OF DIRECTOR GENERAL'S RESIDENCE

662
00:47:32,556 --> 00:47:33,890
SUHYEON: This is a recent report.

663
00:47:35,267 --> 00:47:36,560
It's about Lee Changwoo.

664
00:47:40,314 --> 00:47:41,648
Is all this true?

665
00:47:44,901 --> 00:47:46,778
BURGLARY OF SANGSU BANK
PRESIDENT'S RESIDENCE

666
00:47:49,406 --> 00:47:50,991
It's quite close to the truth.

667
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,244
-Who reported this?
-He's dead.

668
00:47:54,828 --> 00:47:56,163
Team A killed him.

669
00:47:57,914 --> 00:48:00,626
Maybe he dug too deep
and ended up getting caught.

670
00:48:01,126 --> 00:48:03,086
Or this report itself

671
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:06,173
could've been leaked from here.

672
00:48:07,341 --> 00:48:09,551
-You mean the SIH?
-SUHYEON: That's plausible.

673
00:48:10,135 --> 00:48:12,179
Mr. Kang's press conference
was classified info too.

674
00:48:12,262 --> 00:48:14,056
No one knew about it except for the SIH.

675
00:48:14,848 --> 00:48:16,892
Are you saying
there is a spy within the SIH?

676
00:48:26,026 --> 00:48:27,527
Don't look at one another like that.

677
00:48:27,611 --> 00:48:29,279
It's not entirely impossible.

678
00:48:30,906 --> 00:48:33,992
The infiltration agents
usually stay unidentified

679
00:48:34,618 --> 00:48:36,495
just like Mr. Park and me.

680
00:48:37,412 --> 00:48:39,790
That's why I told him
to keep it from headquarters.

681
00:48:39,873 --> 00:48:41,875
Why did he report this
when he was told not to?

682
00:48:44,461 --> 00:48:48,256
Maybe Sergeant Ko was trying to report

683
00:48:48,882 --> 00:48:53,220
something more than just
Lee Changwoo's past.

684
00:48:58,183 --> 00:48:59,559
What's wrong with the page numbers?

685
00:49:07,651 --> 00:49:10,779
The page numbers are mixed up.

686
00:49:21,456 --> 00:49:23,291
<i>Persona Non Grata.</i>

687
00:49:24,209 --> 00:49:25,335
What?

688
00:49:26,044 --> 00:49:29,756
I must say
this Ha Woosin guy is quite bold.

689
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:32,175
I was so curious about him

690
00:49:32,259 --> 00:49:33,969
that I even bought his book to read.

691
00:49:34,052 --> 00:49:35,929
BY HA WOOSIN

692
00:49:36,012 --> 00:49:37,180
MR. CHOI: <i>Mr. Ha's novel.</i>

693
00:49:37,264 --> 00:49:40,183
Sergeant Ko was reading that book
the last time I met him.

694
00:49:41,143 --> 00:49:44,396
The main characters in the story
exchanged messages in code.

695
00:49:46,481 --> 00:49:51,528
"Three, seven, one, six, zero,
one, two, nine, zero, four, three."

696
00:49:56,158 --> 00:49:58,744
SUHYEON: "Three, seven, one, two, nine."

697
00:50:02,372 --> 00:50:03,874
Latitude and longitude.

698
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,795
-Check the location.
-MAN: Yes, sir.

699
00:50:22,142 --> 00:50:23,101
I found it.

700
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:31,318
Something's off.

701
00:50:33,278 --> 00:50:35,906
WOOSIN:
<i>Lee Changwoo left the ceremony first.</i>

702
00:50:36,698 --> 00:50:39,868
<i>But when he arrived at his house,</i>

703
00:50:42,287 --> 00:50:44,247
<i>Mr. Lee was already there waiting for him.</i>

704
00:50:44,915 --> 00:50:46,666
<i>Lee Changwoo arrived</i>

705
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:49,294
<i>a long time after Mr. Lee
murdered my father.</i>

706
00:50:50,253 --> 00:50:52,714
<i>What took him so long?
Did he stop by somewhere?</i>

707
00:51:09,815 --> 00:51:11,817
(tense music)

708
00:51:46,768 --> 00:51:48,019
That figurine.

709
00:51:54,442 --> 00:51:56,361
(door opens)

710
00:52:11,293 --> 00:52:13,545
(Dongrim sighs)
DONGRIM: This won't do.

711
00:52:15,547 --> 00:52:17,799
He really needs to go to a hospital.

712
00:52:17,883 --> 00:52:19,342
That stubborn fool.

713
00:52:21,052 --> 00:52:22,637
What does he think he is, a doctor?

714
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:42,866
It wasn't a dream.

715
00:52:44,701 --> 00:52:45,827
Jeez!

716
00:52:46,912 --> 00:52:48,204
What are you doing there?

717
00:52:48,288 --> 00:52:49,706
Oh, did I startle you?

718
00:52:49,789 --> 00:52:52,042
-Yes, of course.
-Sorry.

719
00:52:52,542 --> 00:52:53,668
Where's Mr. Ha?

720
00:52:54,252 --> 00:52:55,629
He stepped outside just now.

721
00:52:55,712 --> 00:52:56,630
To go where?

722
00:52:57,213 --> 00:52:58,340
I'm not sure.

723
00:53:02,928 --> 00:53:05,639
But what's your relationship with Mr. Ha?

724
00:53:06,598 --> 00:53:07,724
We don't have one.

725
00:53:09,059 --> 00:53:12,604
Mr. Ha wouldn't let
just any woman stay at his place.

726
00:53:13,188 --> 00:53:15,065
I'm acquaintances with his brother.

727
00:53:15,649 --> 00:53:16,483
I see.

728
00:53:18,443 --> 00:53:20,570
Then what's your relationship
with Prosecutor Song?

729
00:53:25,033 --> 00:53:26,117
We just…

730
00:53:28,286 --> 00:53:30,121
make each other worry.

731
00:53:33,959 --> 00:53:37,253
BYUNGCHUL: <i>I'm telling you I'm the victim.</i>

732
00:53:37,504 --> 00:53:39,255
<i>Who wouldn't run away</i>

733
00:53:39,339 --> 00:53:41,841
<i>from a bomb explosion?</i>

734
00:53:42,509 --> 00:53:46,096
<i>I instructed my aide</i>

735
00:53:46,179 --> 00:53:51,017
<i>to evacuate the citizens safely.</i>

736
00:53:51,226 --> 00:53:54,187
<i>And whose car exploded?</i>

737
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:55,605
Where are you going?

738
00:53:55,689 --> 00:53:57,607
BYUNGCHUL: <i>I'm the victim.</i>

739
00:53:57,691 --> 00:54:00,235
<i>-I'm the victim, all right?</i>
-Is she done eating?

740
00:54:04,572 --> 00:54:06,700
Hello, Mr. Hwang. This is Kim Seohee.

741
00:54:06,783 --> 00:54:08,535
It's just as I texted.

742
00:54:08,618 --> 00:54:11,538
I'll give you an important tip
about Chairman Kwon.

743
00:54:12,872 --> 00:54:14,958
Let's meet. We'll talk in person.

744
00:54:21,047 --> 00:54:22,340
(tires screech)

745
00:54:26,052 --> 00:54:28,054
(tense music)

746
00:55:05,216 --> 00:55:09,095
RESTRICTED AREA
RISK OF COLLAPSE

747
00:55:13,058 --> 00:55:16,603
A secluded tourist inn
where no one would think of staying.

748
00:55:18,063 --> 00:55:20,899
I wonder what they did
in this disguised base.

749
00:55:20,982 --> 00:55:24,402
If this is their base, there should be
a large space hidden in the basement.

750
00:55:25,612 --> 00:55:27,447
I think this place was abandoned
a long time ago.

751
00:55:27,530 --> 00:55:28,740
Let's take a look.

752
00:55:29,074 --> 00:55:31,743
Sergeant Ko must've reported it
because there was something inside.

753
00:55:34,771 --> 00:55:36,898
(clanking)

754
00:55:51,538 --> 00:55:53,540
(suspenseful music)

755
00:56:10,181 --> 00:56:13,226
Come here.
I found the stairs to the basement.

756
00:56:23,194 --> 00:56:24,821
(clangs)

757
00:56:42,881 --> 00:56:45,633
(sighs)
Are you kidding me? What's this place for?

758
00:56:54,601 --> 00:56:55,435
The stairs.

759
00:57:35,892 --> 00:57:37,685
-Protect him.
-MAN: Yes, sir.

760
00:57:38,395 --> 00:57:39,687
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

761
00:57:48,113 --> 00:57:49,114
Prosecutor Song.

762
00:57:50,281 --> 00:57:51,616
Stay behind me.

763
00:58:00,291 --> 00:58:03,002
(sighs)
Man, this is nerve-racking.

764
00:58:06,923 --> 00:58:08,091
They've entered the building.

765
00:58:12,137 --> 00:58:13,138
(sighs)

766
00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:16,433
(metals clanking)

767
00:58:18,768 --> 00:58:24,816
(phone buzzing)

768
00:58:25,733 --> 00:58:28,987
Lee Changwoo's not here. We lost him.

769
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:30,447
Damn it!

770
00:58:30,530 --> 00:58:32,740
(breathing heavily)

771
00:58:32,824 --> 00:58:34,075
Nothing's working out.

772
00:58:39,539 --> 00:58:41,291
He didn't even hit him much.

773
00:58:45,211 --> 00:58:47,005
That guy is quite skilled.

774
00:58:56,764 --> 00:59:01,561
(monitor beeping)

775
00:59:03,313 --> 00:59:05,190
We've been ordered to keep everyone out.

776
00:59:10,987 --> 00:59:11,863
Apologies.

777
00:59:18,536 --> 00:59:19,787
(Hyunjo sighs)

778
00:59:22,332 --> 00:59:23,791
(groans)

779
00:59:26,628 --> 00:59:27,712
(phone buzzes)

780
00:59:27,795 --> 00:59:30,924
YOON JIN: WHAT'S GOING ON?
THEY'RE BLOCKING THE CHAIRMAN'S ROOM.

781
00:59:32,425 --> 00:59:33,510
(breathing heavily)

782
00:59:39,307 --> 00:59:40,934
You're awake.

783
00:59:42,685 --> 00:59:45,271
-(Kwon grunts)
-I was so worried

784
00:59:46,105 --> 00:59:47,482
you might die peacefully.

785
00:59:57,617 --> 01:00:00,703
Don't worry about Haesong.
I'll keep it safe.

786
01:00:03,665 --> 01:00:04,624
Hyesoo.

787
01:00:05,959 --> 01:00:07,460
Calm down.

788
01:00:11,089 --> 01:00:13,174
Someone's dying to see you.

789
01:00:14,676 --> 01:00:16,135
You've got to meet her.

790
01:00:18,304 --> 01:00:19,681
What…

791
01:00:24,769 --> 01:00:25,770
(Kwon grunts)

792
01:00:28,523 --> 01:00:30,525
(solemn music)

793
01:00:38,199 --> 01:00:39,075
(grunts)

794
01:00:41,661 --> 01:00:42,829
(metal clanks)

795
01:00:49,544 --> 01:00:50,753
KWON: No…

796
01:00:52,672 --> 01:00:54,591
MS. KWON: My son's heart.

797
01:00:56,593 --> 01:00:58,177
It would only be right

798
01:00:59,512 --> 01:01:01,055
that I stop this heart

799
01:01:02,473 --> 01:01:05,893
from beating, wouldn't it?

800
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:08,438
(grunts)

801
01:01:09,647 --> 01:01:10,648
Ms. Kwon…

802
01:01:11,232 --> 01:01:14,485
Do you have any last words?

803
01:01:15,528 --> 01:01:17,113
(gasps, coughs)

804
01:01:17,822 --> 01:01:18,781
(chuckles)

805
01:01:19,490 --> 01:01:20,867
Go on and speak.

806
01:01:21,909 --> 01:01:23,036
Don't do this.

807
01:01:24,787 --> 01:01:25,705
(Kwon grunts)

808
01:01:28,291 --> 01:01:30,710
No one will come to save you.

809
01:01:33,504 --> 01:01:34,422
(gasps)

810
01:01:37,675 --> 01:01:39,010
Die!

811
01:01:39,427 --> 01:01:40,803
(grunts)

812
01:01:42,388 --> 01:01:43,556
(coughs)

813
01:01:47,810 --> 01:01:48,895
(sobs)

814
01:01:52,482 --> 01:01:54,275
Soonyi.

815
01:01:55,943 --> 01:01:57,403
Don't call my name.

816
01:01:57,987 --> 01:02:00,865
(monitor beeping rapidly)

817
01:02:05,578 --> 01:02:06,621
KWON: Go ahead.

818
01:02:08,247 --> 01:02:09,791
Stab me.

819
01:02:11,626 --> 01:02:12,502
You…

820
01:02:14,212 --> 01:02:15,713
You deserve to do that.

821
01:02:23,471 --> 01:02:25,932
You're treating me like your servant
until the end.

822
01:02:26,891 --> 01:02:30,019
Do I need permission even to kill you?

823
01:02:31,604 --> 01:02:33,022
-(Ms. Kwon grunts)
-(groans)

824
01:02:33,106 --> 01:02:37,110
(monitor beeping rapidly)

825
01:02:48,454 --> 01:02:50,915
(sobbing)

826
01:02:51,833 --> 01:02:55,211
(monitor beeping continuously)

827
01:03:04,595 --> 01:03:10,226
(wailing)

828
01:03:22,530 --> 01:03:27,660
(wailing continues)

829
01:03:27,744 --> 01:03:30,663
(muffled sob)

830
01:04:04,113 --> 01:04:05,239
Ms. Kwon.

831
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:17,126
Snap out of it.

832
01:04:17,835 --> 01:04:19,670
I still need you.

833
01:04:33,309 --> 01:04:36,646
I saw you on the news.
You lost your strings, didn't you?

834
01:04:37,438 --> 01:04:38,356
But you know

835
01:04:38,439 --> 01:04:40,733
such a report can't be aired
unless Haesong allows it.

836
01:04:41,359 --> 01:04:43,361
They're determined
to make you lose the election.

837
01:04:43,444 --> 01:04:46,280
Are you here to tell me
what I already know?

838
01:04:47,323 --> 01:04:50,117
You said you have an important tip
about Chairman Kwon.

839
01:04:52,286 --> 01:04:53,830
He got shot.

840
01:04:57,375 --> 01:04:59,627
He's currently in the VIP room
of this hospital.

841
01:05:01,963 --> 01:05:03,256
You're lying.

842
01:05:03,339 --> 01:05:05,466
Why aren't you in a VIP room?

843
01:05:06,050 --> 01:05:07,218
-Because--
-Because of Chairman Kwon,

844
01:05:07,301 --> 01:05:09,387
the whole ward was emptied out.

845
01:05:09,971 --> 01:05:13,307
You often visited him in the hospital,
so you must know.

846
01:05:17,186 --> 01:05:18,771
He got shot three times.

847
01:05:21,816 --> 01:05:24,443
Is he going to die?

848
01:05:28,573 --> 01:05:30,241
This is nonsense.

849
01:05:35,496 --> 01:05:36,497
Mr. Hwang.

850
01:05:36,581 --> 01:05:39,458
Haesong never takes back
the trash they discard.

851
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:43,379
-What?
-Oh, I take back the word "trash."

852
01:05:44,755 --> 01:05:47,008
(sighs)
Now is your chance.

853
01:05:47,091 --> 01:05:48,885
Before Chairman Kwon wakes up…

854
01:05:48,968 --> 01:05:51,846
Before Kwon Hyunjo regains control,
you must make a decision.

855
01:05:51,929 --> 01:05:55,808
You can't get back on your feet anyway,
as long as Haesong remains undiminished.

856
01:05:56,392 --> 01:05:57,977
Why don't you throw a big blow at Haesong

857
01:05:58,060 --> 01:05:59,645
and become a national hero?

858
01:06:05,151 --> 01:06:07,904
Even if you do this, I won't be fooled.

859
01:06:07,987 --> 01:06:10,948
Even if you do this,
Haesong won't spare you.

860
01:06:14,327 --> 01:06:17,038
I'll be waiting for your call.
But I can't give you much time.

861
01:06:20,666 --> 01:06:21,751
Ms. Kim.

862
01:06:23,878 --> 01:06:26,589
I'll give it some thought
and get back to you.

863
01:06:29,675 --> 01:06:30,718
Sure.

864
01:06:39,310 --> 01:06:41,312
(eerie music)

865
01:06:58,371 --> 01:06:59,747
(elevator dings)

866
01:07:09,674 --> 01:07:10,633
(door opens)

867
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:14,512
What in the world?

868
01:07:15,221 --> 01:07:16,180
(gasps)

869
01:07:17,223 --> 01:07:19,475
-What happened?
-I killed him.

870
01:07:22,144 --> 01:07:23,187
Hyesoo.

871
01:07:23,854 --> 01:07:25,982
Why?

872
01:07:26,065 --> 01:07:27,108
Haesong…

873
01:07:28,526 --> 01:07:29,860
is mine now.

874
01:07:35,992 --> 01:07:38,494
It's not odd for a patient in the ICU

875
01:07:39,495 --> 01:07:40,830
to die after surgery.

876
01:07:41,998 --> 01:07:43,332
Isn't that right, Father?

877
01:07:57,555 --> 01:07:59,306
(clanks)

878
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:41,682
(suspenseful music)

879
01:08:57,281 --> 01:08:59,325
-SUHYEON: <i>We found something.</i>
-Let's go.

880
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:24,225
(gasps)

881
01:09:37,988 --> 01:09:39,990
(eerie music)

882
01:09:51,710 --> 01:09:53,712
(closing theme music)

883
01:10:06,725 --> 01:10:08,310
POLICE:
<i>We're from Kangchun Police Station.</i>

884
01:10:08,394 --> 01:10:11,313
<i>We think that there may be
someone helping him.</i>

885
01:10:11,397 --> 01:10:13,190
SEOHEE: <i>What's wrong is wrong.</i>

886
01:10:13,274 --> 01:10:15,025
<i>Don't try too hard to forgive him.</i>

887
01:10:16,026 --> 01:10:18,863
I gave you what you wanted,
so I should get what I want.

888
01:10:18,946 --> 01:10:20,739
The bastard that killed my brother.

889
01:10:20,823 --> 01:10:21,866
HYUNJO: <i>Father.</i>

890
01:10:21,949 --> 01:10:23,033
HYESOO: <i>Are you mourning?</i>

891
01:10:23,117 --> 01:10:25,161
SUN: <i>So what's the next order?</i>

892
01:10:25,244 --> 01:10:26,162
HYUNJO: <i>Kill them.</i>

893
01:10:26,745 --> 01:10:28,622
SUHYEON: <i>I've found a way to lure Team A.</i>

894
01:10:28,706 --> 01:10:30,457
<i>There are two ways to enter
the basement floor of the funeral hall.</i>

895
01:10:30,541 --> 01:10:32,418
