He fooled me?

How dare he…

6
00:02:11,527 --> 00:02:13,154
Go bring the real Adamas.

Got that?

00:02:24,457 --> 00:02:25,750
I'm talking about Lee Changwoo.

10
00:02:38,304 --> 00:02:40,098
I think we're done talking.

11
00:02:44,727 --> 00:02:45,770
Jeez.

00:02:47,605 --> 00:02:49,315

What?

Mr. Kang, hurry up and let his camp know.

<i>Hwang Byungchul wasn't at the ceremony.</i>

29
00:04:39,342 --> 00:04:42,053
He should've pushed everything aside
to be there,

30

but he wasn't invited.

31
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,848
It must've been intentional.

32
00:04:46,432 --> 00:04:48,518
They wanted him
to be somewhere else at the time.

33
00:04:55,024 --> 00:04:57,527
Gather our people immediately.
We must go to Sangam Market.

Mr. Hwang.

48
00:06:22,445 --> 00:06:25,198
What's wrong? I'm in the middle
of communicating with my supporters.

49
00:06:28,868 --> 00:06:30,203
What?

50

Excuse me?

55
00:07:09,492 --> 00:07:10,952
Should we evacuate the people?

56
00:07:11,035 --> 00:07:13,329
No way. If we let them know,
things could get too crazy

57
00:07:13,412 --> 00:07:14,330
for us to get out of here.

Hey, go start the engine already.

65
00:08:15,808 --> 00:08:16,767
Yes, sir. Hurry up!
Now!

66
00:08:22,356 --> 00:08:23,649
Hwang Byungchul is the target.

67
00:08:24,734 --> 00:08:25,860
Let's go!

68
00:08:29,113 --> 00:08:31,407

Right.

103
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,113
Long time no see.

104

What brings you here all of a sudden?

If you're talking about Ms. Yoon,
she's inside.

You've become so mean.

110
00:11:39,136 --> 00:11:41,305
Is it because of Minjo's death?

Those mean words
make you look even prettier.

The suicide bombing has become a fact.

But I'm glad you're safe.

That's good enough.

I'm sorry for your trouble.

125
00:13:20,738 --> 00:13:22,698
And thank you for being alive.

126

-What?
-Is that all?

128
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,208
Say a little more.

129
00:13:33,292 --> 00:13:35,502
I barely managed to survive.

130
00:13:40,382 --> 00:13:42,801
You're lying in bed handcuffed.
How can you be smiling?

131
00:13:42,885 --> 00:13:45,220
I even put on an explosive vest.

132
00:13:45,804 --> 00:13:47,181
I've got to stay strong.

133
00:13:53,103 --> 00:13:54,188
Ms. Kim.

134
00:13:55,898 --> 00:13:57,066
Listen carefully.

135
00:13:57,566 --> 00:14:00,819
Narcotics were found in your blood.

136
00:14:02,029 --> 00:14:02,988
What?

137
00:14:12,581 --> 00:14:13,791
Oh.

138
00:14:14,792 --> 00:14:16,377
Then the police might think

139
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:19,880
that I committed it under the influence.

140
00:14:20,464 --> 00:14:23,550
No, no one thinks you committed it alone.

141
00:14:23,634 --> 00:14:25,469
They think someone pulled the strings.

142
00:14:26,178 --> 00:14:28,222
Naturally, they will dig
into who's behind it.

143
00:14:32,935 --> 00:14:33,769
What?

144
00:14:33,852 --> 00:14:36,355
To reveal that I was kidnapped,

145
00:14:37,773 --> 00:14:39,858
I must single out Team A.

146
00:14:40,401 --> 00:14:44,363
But then the SIH will inevitably
be brought up to the surface.

147
00:14:44,446 --> 00:14:46,448
Will they be safe?

148
00:14:46,532 --> 00:14:48,075
Don't worry.

149
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:51,412
They already got dragged out
even if not for you.

150
00:14:52,204 --> 00:14:53,664
It's already begun.

KOREAN SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS HEADQUARTERS

152

At 7:23 p.m. yesterday,

153
00:15:07,302 --> 00:15:10,347
the suspect showed up in a suicide vest
at the lobby of this building.

154
00:15:10,431 --> 00:15:13,559
We immediately called in
the Explosive Ordnance Disposal Team

155
00:15:13,642 --> 00:15:16,729
and the bomb was deactivated
safely at 10:46 p.m.

156
00:15:16,812 --> 00:15:18,105
The bomb will be

157
00:15:18,188 --> 00:15:20,816
analyzed thoroughly in a safe location.

158
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:22,568
Afterward, we will organize a task force

159
00:15:22,651 --> 00:15:25,029
to focus on investigating the case.

160
00:15:25,112 --> 00:15:27,489
Sir, there has been a report
that this culprit has something

161
00:15:27,573 --> 00:15:30,826
to do with the terrorist attack
at Candidate Hwang's campaign rally.

162
00:15:30,909 --> 00:15:32,369
Is it true?

163
00:15:32,453 --> 00:15:35,539
What's your stance about Hwang's argument?
Do you think it's credible?

164
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:40,044
That matter
is currently under investigation.

165
00:15:40,461 --> 00:15:44,339
It certainly was a conspiracy
to assassinate me!

166
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:48,427
Just three days
before the presidential election,

167
00:15:48,969 --> 00:15:51,638
this kind of terrorist attack took place.

168
00:15:51,764 --> 00:15:55,100
It means they thought

169
00:15:55,184 --> 00:15:56,852
I was likely to be elected

170
00:15:56,977 --> 00:16:00,814
and pulled this despicable scheme
to stop me from becoming president.

171
00:16:00,898 --> 00:16:01,774
STRONGLY CLAIMS ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT

172
00:16:01,857 --> 00:16:07,362
I know there's a mastermind behind this.

173
00:16:09,281 --> 00:16:10,491
Are you sure?

174
00:16:10,574 --> 00:16:12,826
Was the call really
from Kang Hyukpil of the SIH?

175
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,411
Yes, I'm sure.

176
00:16:14,495 --> 00:16:15,621
Good.

177
00:16:16,455 --> 00:16:19,416
It's going to make a nice picture
with just a little touch.

178
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:21,752
You know who Mr. Kang is.

179
00:16:22,252 --> 00:16:24,213
He works for the president.

180
00:16:24,713 --> 00:16:27,800
This is going to be the perfect chance
to wipe them all out.

181
00:16:30,052 --> 00:16:33,972
Please understand that we can't share
any more details about the investigation.

182
00:16:34,556 --> 00:16:35,724
That's all for today.

183
00:16:37,643 --> 00:16:39,436
Mr. Kang, wait.
Mr. Kang.

184
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,605
-Mr. Kang.
Just a moment.

185
00:16:42,898 --> 00:16:44,650
It won't end only with you.

186
00:16:45,484 --> 00:16:47,402
Everyone in this field
knows who is behind you.

187
00:16:49,238 --> 00:16:51,573
They will use me to go after the VIP?

188
00:16:51,657 --> 00:16:55,077
It's an undeniable fact that the VIP
is connected to the SIH.

189
00:16:55,577 --> 00:16:57,538
Consequentially, the SIH is intact

190
00:16:57,621 --> 00:16:59,623
while Hwang's side was bombed.

191
00:17:00,749 --> 00:17:02,376
They could take the fall for this.

192
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:04,336
Mr. Kang, that bomb.

193
00:17:05,796 --> 00:17:07,840
You know where it came from
if it was Team A's doing.

194
00:17:11,093 --> 00:17:13,762
Compare it with every bomb
produced by ARES.

195
00:17:13,846 --> 00:17:15,305
See if any component matches.

196
00:17:17,015 --> 00:17:19,268
That's why they needed me.

197
00:17:19,768 --> 00:17:20,978
The target was

198
00:17:21,854 --> 00:17:24,356
Hwang Byungchul,
whom I went after obsessively.

199
00:17:25,315 --> 00:17:28,193
They'll tie in the SIH too.

200
00:17:29,903 --> 00:17:33,866
Darn it, that sure was a fatal blow.

201
00:17:36,118 --> 00:17:37,369
We'll fight right back.

202
00:17:38,871 --> 00:17:40,914
Tell the police the truth.

203
00:17:41,915 --> 00:17:43,959
-The truth?
-About my father's case.

204
00:17:45,043 --> 00:17:47,212
That you witnessed the case,

205
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:50,299
and the Adamas
is the missing murder weapon.

206
00:17:51,258 --> 00:17:54,219
You tried to look into it,
and some unidentified people…

207
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,388
Are you following?

208
00:17:56,555 --> 00:17:58,265
You want to drag Chairman Kwon into it?

209
00:18:04,688 --> 00:18:07,774
A TERRORIST ATTACK TAKES PLACE
AT CANDIDATE HWANG'S CAMPAIGN RALLY

210
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:23,332
Mr. Lee ordered it.

211
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,919
You weren't aware of it?

212
00:18:31,673 --> 00:18:34,426
Hyunjo gave his permission, I heard.

213
00:18:48,482 --> 00:18:50,025
May I leave?

214
00:19:09,544 --> 00:19:10,545
I apologize.

215
00:19:11,713 --> 00:19:13,465
I thought this would make way

216
00:19:14,091 --> 00:19:16,301
for the legalization of firearms--

217
00:19:16,385 --> 00:19:17,594
Shut it!

218
00:19:20,764 --> 00:19:21,765
Father.

219
00:19:24,768 --> 00:19:26,019
You fool.

220
00:19:29,773 --> 00:19:31,566
-Sun?
Yes.

221
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,652
The chairman summoned her himself.

222
00:19:35,112 --> 00:19:35,946
Really?

223
00:19:36,571 --> 00:19:39,992
Will it be okay? He might get furious
about this incident.

224
00:19:41,702 --> 00:19:42,661
It will be okay.

225
00:19:43,745 --> 00:19:45,831
-Pardon?
-The chairman would know

226
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:50,043
why his stupid son needs me.

227
00:19:51,211 --> 00:19:54,589
He caused a huge mess out of things,
and the world's going crazy about it.

228
00:19:56,049 --> 00:19:57,551
Somebody has to clean that up

229
00:19:58,719 --> 00:20:00,137
for his sake, you know.

230
00:20:03,849 --> 00:20:06,476
<i>Everyone else knows
that Mr. Lee made a fool out of you.</i>

231
00:20:07,394 --> 00:20:09,813
Your dog attacked you,

232
00:20:09,896 --> 00:20:12,107
but you don't even know
that you were attacked.

233
00:20:12,774 --> 00:20:14,651
How can you become the owner of Haesong

234
00:20:14,735 --> 00:20:16,945
when you can't even
control your underlings?

235
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:18,155
How dare you!

236
00:20:21,533 --> 00:20:24,703
Father, it was all for your sake.

237
00:20:25,746 --> 00:20:27,164
Those rats from the SIH

238
00:20:27,247 --> 00:20:29,583
dared to dig into your past.

239
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,918
-I wanted to wipe them all out--
-So,

240
00:20:32,502 --> 00:20:34,379
are they gone?

241
00:20:35,922 --> 00:20:37,841
-It's not over yet.
-Enough!

242
00:20:40,635 --> 00:20:41,803
What happened in the past

243
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:44,723
isn't yours to meddle with.

244
00:20:50,187 --> 00:20:51,355
The Adamas

245
00:20:54,524 --> 00:20:56,109
is already broken.

246
00:21:00,155 --> 00:21:01,990
The murder weapon doesn't exist anymore.

247
00:21:04,743 --> 00:21:07,579
The Adamas is broken?
What do you mean by that?

248
00:21:13,168 --> 00:21:16,004
I don't understand. Why would it break?

249
00:21:17,047 --> 00:21:18,465
How could a diamond…

250
00:21:28,725 --> 00:21:30,685
The Adamas is a fake?

251
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:34,314
Then where is the real one?

252
00:21:37,317 --> 00:21:38,151
Father.

253
00:21:38,235 --> 00:21:40,028
Only Lee Changwoo would know.

254
00:21:41,071 --> 00:21:44,199
That bastard switched it?

255
00:21:44,282 --> 00:21:46,618
At that time 22 years ago?

256
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:54,626
So?

257
00:21:55,877 --> 00:21:56,795
What do you mean, so?

258
00:21:56,878 --> 00:21:58,547
That bastard is still alive.

259
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:02,259
He dared mess with the Adamas,
and you're keeping him alive?

260
00:22:02,342 --> 00:22:03,885
-Then should I kill him?
-Of course!

261
00:22:04,469 --> 00:22:05,804
He deserves to die countless times.

262
00:22:05,887 --> 00:22:09,057
Then how will we find the real one?

263
00:22:11,059 --> 00:22:13,145
We must find the real Adamas

264
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:15,564
and bring it here.

265
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,490
It wasn't a coincidence

266
00:22:28,076 --> 00:22:29,327
Mr. Ha came to this house.

267
00:22:34,207 --> 00:22:35,876
I'd like to write a memoir.

268
00:22:36,751 --> 00:22:38,462
Ms. Yoon, check if there's

269
00:22:38,962 --> 00:22:41,673
anyone eligible to ghostwrite it.

270
00:22:45,302 --> 00:22:46,678
The name is Ha Woosin.

271
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:14,206
Hey, sis.

272
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:16,208
Hi.

273
00:23:17,292 --> 00:23:18,376
Have you been well?

274
00:23:21,505 --> 00:23:23,715
It's been a while,
but you don't seem glad to see me.

275
00:23:24,508 --> 00:23:26,218
I thought about you often.

276
00:23:31,681 --> 00:23:33,433
Every time I kill someone,

277
00:23:34,017 --> 00:23:35,936
I imagine it's you.

278
00:23:38,813 --> 00:23:39,648
Sis.

279
00:23:40,857 --> 00:23:42,234
You must be happy.

280
00:23:43,068 --> 00:23:45,320
At your happiest moment,

281
00:23:47,155 --> 00:23:50,075
we'll meet again.

282
00:24:07,509 --> 00:24:10,387
<i>The Adamas is already broken.</i>

283
00:24:11,346 --> 00:24:13,056
<i>The murder weapon doesn't exist anymore.</i>

284
00:24:13,139 --> 00:24:14,558
It was a fake.

285
00:24:15,183 --> 00:24:17,352
<i>We must find the real Adamas</i>

286
00:24:18,103 --> 00:24:19,646
<i>and bring it here.</i>

287
00:24:21,982 --> 00:24:23,858
He spared Ha Woosin's life

288
00:24:25,735 --> 00:24:27,571
to find the Adamas.

289
00:24:41,293 --> 00:24:42,419
Mr. Ha.

290
00:24:46,506 --> 00:24:47,882
Mr. Ha.

291
00:24:50,343 --> 00:24:51,511
Mr. Ha?

292
00:24:54,264 --> 00:24:55,265
Mr. Ha.

293
00:24:56,933 --> 00:24:58,351
Where did he go?

294
00:25:03,815 --> 00:25:05,108
DONGRIM

295
00:25:07,277 --> 00:25:09,738
Mr. Ha, where are you?
Nothing happened to you, right?

296
00:25:09,821 --> 00:25:11,448
Jeez, talk quietly.

297
00:25:12,657 --> 00:25:13,575
Thank goodness.

298
00:25:13,658 --> 00:25:15,910
I was startled because you weren't home.

299
00:25:15,994 --> 00:25:17,871
<i>I thought Chairman Kwon
had killed you already.</i>

300
00:25:17,954 --> 00:25:19,372
What are you doing at my place?

301
00:25:19,956 --> 00:25:21,583
I was scared to be home alone.

302
00:25:21,666 --> 00:25:23,043
What if they come to retaliate?

303
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:26,921
Didn't you think
it'd be more dangerous there?

304
00:25:27,005 --> 00:25:28,798
<i>Still, there's strength in numbers.</i>

305
00:25:28,882 --> 00:25:32,260
If something happens,
I'll call the police while you face them.

306
00:25:32,344 --> 00:25:34,012
Or should I be with my parents
at the hospital?

307
00:25:34,095 --> 00:25:35,555
Suit yourself.

308
00:25:35,639 --> 00:25:37,057
<i>Where are you, by the way?</i>

309
00:25:37,641 --> 00:25:39,517
It's dangerous to be alone. Come home.

310
00:25:39,601 --> 00:25:41,686
Sleep on the couch, not the bed.

311
00:25:46,691 --> 00:25:48,652
Where are you?
Should I go to where you are?

312
00:25:48,735 --> 00:25:50,278
I said, not the bed.

313
00:25:54,407 --> 00:25:56,201
He's just so fearless.

314
00:25:58,578 --> 00:26:01,164
Goodness, I'm tired.

315
00:26:33,321 --> 00:26:34,447
How did it go?

316
00:26:35,115 --> 00:26:36,408
The signal is blocked.

317
00:26:36,491 --> 00:26:37,909
It's the same for mine.

318
00:26:37,992 --> 00:26:39,452
They blocked it intentionally.

319
00:26:40,203 --> 00:26:42,080
It's a means to protect
the infiltration agents.

320
00:26:42,163 --> 00:26:45,333
After what happened at the ceremony,
this place is almost unapproachable now.

321
00:26:46,584 --> 00:26:47,794
What are you going to do?

322
00:26:48,962 --> 00:26:51,965
The headquarters will do their work,
and we'll do ours.

323
00:26:52,966 --> 00:26:54,551
We've got an unexpected problem here too.

324
00:26:55,093 --> 00:26:57,887
Ask me any questions.
I'll tell you everything.

325
00:26:59,639 --> 00:27:02,767
Lee Changwoo murdered
Song Soonho 22 years ago,

326
00:27:02,851 --> 00:27:05,353
but it was actually Chairman Kwon.
Is that what you're saying?

327
00:27:05,603 --> 00:27:06,730
That's right.

328
00:27:09,065 --> 00:27:10,400
Can you prove it?

329
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:15,029
An arrest warrant might be issued
with Ms. Kwon's testimony.

330
00:27:15,113 --> 00:27:16,906
The arrowhead is broken,

331
00:27:19,826 --> 00:27:21,119
<i>but there may be a bloodstain</i>

332
00:27:21,745 --> 00:27:23,413
<i>left inside the arrow shaft.</i>

333
00:27:24,164 --> 00:27:28,001
If it turns out to be Song Soonho's blood,
the game will be over.

334
00:27:28,793 --> 00:27:30,211
Even if there isn't any blood,

335
00:27:30,295 --> 00:27:32,505
we can compare the evidence
with the scar on his skeleton.

336
00:27:33,548 --> 00:27:35,675
-Okay.
-I've still got a chance.

337
00:27:37,051 --> 00:27:37,969
<i>Mr. Choi.</i>

338
00:27:42,474 --> 00:27:43,683
What is it, Mr. Lee?

339
00:27:44,267 --> 00:27:45,226
<i>Mr. Ha is here.</i>

340
00:27:49,397 --> 00:27:50,857
He wants to meet the chairman.

341
00:28:24,766 --> 00:28:28,228
I need to talk to the chairman in private.
Will you give us some space?

342
00:28:29,687 --> 00:28:32,065
How dare you--

343
00:28:32,148 --> 00:28:34,692
Hyunjo, he's my guest.

344
00:28:48,122 --> 00:28:51,334
I met the man you sent.

345
00:28:54,712 --> 00:28:56,840
And I received your message.

346
00:29:01,094 --> 00:29:03,721
How similar. Those eyes…

347
00:29:19,195 --> 00:29:20,947
What are you doing? This is rude.

348
00:29:25,493 --> 00:29:26,953
That writer is here.

349
00:29:32,917 --> 00:29:34,085
Aren't you glad?

350
00:29:34,168 --> 00:29:35,628
You two seemed quite close.

351
00:29:35,712 --> 00:29:38,882
I know you aren't jealous,
so what's the meaning of this?

352
00:29:42,594 --> 00:29:44,053
You're a smart woman.

353
00:29:44,888 --> 00:29:46,598
Did you really not know?

354
00:29:47,515 --> 00:29:50,685
Why that writer came to this house.

355
00:29:54,314 --> 00:29:57,817
Maybe he approached you.

356
00:29:59,569 --> 00:30:01,404
A lonely woman

357
00:30:01,613 --> 00:30:03,489
is such easy prey.

358
00:30:05,825 --> 00:30:06,826
You have a point.

359
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:10,038
But sadly, he's not interested in me.

360
00:30:10,121 --> 00:30:11,331
Although I am.

361
00:30:13,499 --> 00:30:15,084
Don't blame me.

362
00:30:16,502 --> 00:30:18,755
It was Ms. Yoon who recommended him.

363
00:30:21,341 --> 00:30:23,718
Shouldn't you be busy right now?

364
00:30:24,218 --> 00:30:26,763
Ms. Kwon seemed to know something.

365
00:30:28,222 --> 00:30:30,391
I wonder what she will say to the police.

366
00:30:34,103 --> 00:30:36,105
Your father was just like you.

367
00:30:37,273 --> 00:30:39,776
Being a hound didn't suit him.

368
00:30:41,444 --> 00:30:43,446
Just what happened?

369
00:30:45,281 --> 00:30:46,699
I was betrayed.

370
00:30:49,285 --> 00:30:50,286
Me.

371
00:30:51,371 --> 00:30:53,289
You're becoming more popular by the day.

372
00:30:53,873 --> 00:30:57,043
The media are calling you
a Robin Hood figure.

373
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:00,338
The notorious thief
is now a national star.

374
00:31:00,588 --> 00:31:02,715
Thanks to it, anything you steal

375
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,926
gets branded to be dirty
and corrupt right away.

376
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:09,430
The management support department
will be expanded to a specialized team.

377
00:31:10,598 --> 00:31:12,100
Of course, you'll be in charge.

378
00:31:16,938 --> 00:31:17,897
Sir.

379
00:31:18,773 --> 00:31:21,609
I'd like to stop here.

380
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,821
I think this is where my part ends.

381
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:28,324
Is it because of that woman?

382
00:31:30,118 --> 00:31:31,494
Is she pregnant or something?

383
00:31:34,122 --> 00:31:36,416
I didn't know it was twins.

384
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,002
He wanted to leave, didn't he?

385
00:31:43,923 --> 00:31:48,094
I'm certain that I've been
more loyal to you than anyone else.

386
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,555
I did everything you asked.

387
00:31:51,264 --> 00:31:52,598
And I carried it out.

388
00:31:53,683 --> 00:31:54,767
Now,

389
00:31:56,519 --> 00:31:57,812
I'd like to be forgotten.

390
00:31:59,731 --> 00:32:01,649
Would you be forgotten
just because I forget you?

391
00:32:02,817 --> 00:32:04,777
The whole organization remembers you.

392
00:32:05,361 --> 00:32:08,698
Everyone we've discarded
was sent to their grave, right?

393
00:32:09,449 --> 00:32:11,200
-Sir.
-No exceptions are allowed.

394
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:14,871
-Sir.
-Go back.

395
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:55,661
Please promise me

396
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:58,623
just one thing.

397
00:32:59,707 --> 00:33:00,541
That you will

398
00:33:02,001 --> 00:33:03,419
end it with me.

399
00:33:21,145 --> 00:33:22,939
You should've shot me.

400
00:33:24,232 --> 00:33:25,775
Then I would've

401
00:33:27,693 --> 00:33:29,445
wanted to kill you.

402
00:33:31,322 --> 00:33:33,366
The police will receive an anonymous tip.

403
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:36,160
You will be arrested red-handed next time.

404
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:39,497
Fifteen years should be enough.

405
00:33:39,664 --> 00:33:41,958
By then, I might be able

406
00:33:43,709 --> 00:33:45,294
to forget you.

407
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:51,342
Did you want to spare his life?

408
00:33:56,597 --> 00:33:59,392
Even you figured that out.
I wonder why your father couldn't.

409
00:34:00,393 --> 00:34:02,645
Rotting in prison for 15 years,

410
00:34:04,689 --> 00:34:06,691
he probably got an urge to take revenge.

411
00:34:08,651 --> 00:34:10,528
How could he steal the Adamas?

412
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:16,033
I tried to keep my promise
at that time as well.

413
00:34:16,242 --> 00:34:17,702
By killing him only.

414
00:34:18,286 --> 00:34:19,287
Instead,

415
00:34:20,413 --> 00:34:22,498
Song Soonho ended up dying.

416
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:27,336
Your father gained a lot from this anyway.

417
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:29,255
For 22 years,

418
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:32,717
he deceived me completely.

419
00:34:34,927 --> 00:34:36,345
Now you should

420
00:34:38,472 --> 00:34:40,141
pay off that debt.

421
00:34:45,688 --> 00:34:47,690
So you planned it all from the start.

422
00:34:49,692 --> 00:34:51,319
You lured me into this house,

423
00:34:52,403 --> 00:34:55,031
knowing that I'd try to steal the Adamas.

424
00:34:59,035 --> 00:35:00,745
All to find the real Adamas.

425
00:35:03,789 --> 00:35:06,167
-But just one thing.

426
00:35:07,793 --> 00:35:09,921
Ms. Kwon's actions were unexpected.

427
00:35:11,964 --> 00:35:15,509
It was 22 years ago.
At around 3 a.m. on May 5…

428
00:35:16,177 --> 00:35:19,513
Jeez, that's a horrible nightmare.

429
00:35:19,597 --> 00:35:22,934
It wasn't a dream. Hyunjo and I saw it.

430
00:35:23,684 --> 00:35:25,102
Our father

431
00:35:26,729 --> 00:35:30,441
killed someone with the Adamas.

432
00:35:32,652 --> 00:35:34,612
What are you talking about?

433
00:35:34,695 --> 00:35:37,531
Lee Changwoo. His name was Lee Changwoo.

434
00:35:37,615 --> 00:35:38,532
Lee Changwoo.

435
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:43,955
You heard this?

436
00:35:45,539 --> 00:35:46,999
I clearly did.

437
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:49,252
At that time, I didn't understand.

438
00:35:52,046 --> 00:35:53,798
ROBIN HOOD LEE CHANGWOO
KILLS A MAN IN HIS 40S

439
00:35:53,881 --> 00:35:56,259
<i>But the next day,
I saw the newspaper and realized</i>

440
00:35:56,342 --> 00:35:59,262
that the Adamas
was the missing murder weapon.

441
00:35:59,345 --> 00:36:02,390
That Chairman Kwon ordered
Lee Changwoo to kill that man.

442
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:06,185
Lee Changwoo
was his devoted right-hand man.

443
00:36:07,937 --> 00:36:11,274
Don't tell me
you actually think Father killed him.

444
00:36:11,357 --> 00:36:13,109
I think it's plausible enough.

445
00:36:13,985 --> 00:36:14,902
What about you?

446
00:36:14,986 --> 00:36:18,030
You're crossing the line here, fearlessly.

447
00:36:21,993 --> 00:36:24,245
I've got nothing to fear.

448
00:36:25,037 --> 00:36:26,372
A coward is

449
00:36:28,207 --> 00:36:29,959
rather a word to describe you.

450
00:36:31,961 --> 00:36:35,840
You've always been scared of your father.

451
00:36:39,385 --> 00:36:40,469
I see.

452
00:36:41,554 --> 00:36:45,474
That's why you're asking me
these leading questions.

453
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:48,185
You're even recording this conversation.

454
00:36:48,269 --> 00:36:50,021
NEW RECORDING

455
00:36:50,104 --> 00:36:51,230
Right?

456
00:36:53,774 --> 00:36:56,485
Please, Hyesoo.

457
00:36:56,569 --> 00:36:57,945
Please don't do this.

458
00:36:58,029 --> 00:37:00,948
If you keep acting up,
Father will kill you for real.

459
00:37:11,083 --> 00:37:12,335
Is this funny to you?

460
00:37:13,377 --> 00:37:15,421
The chairman can't kill me.

461
00:37:17,423 --> 00:37:20,885
Because I'm the only one
who reminds him of Minjo.

462
00:37:25,514 --> 00:37:27,433
He had to kill

463
00:37:28,726 --> 00:37:31,228
his most beloved son himself.

464
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,774
And I'm the woman that son loved.

465
00:37:36,901 --> 00:37:40,112
I'm better than you,
the stupid and pathetic replacement.

466
00:37:41,405 --> 00:37:42,656
No?

467
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:46,369
Right.

468
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:48,704
Minjo is the reason

469
00:37:48,788 --> 00:37:50,373
you're still alive.

470
00:37:52,875 --> 00:37:55,920
Hyesoo, who do you think
would suffer the most

471
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:58,714
if you're alive?

472
00:38:00,758 --> 00:38:02,385
-What are you saying?
-Me.

473
00:38:04,637 --> 00:38:05,638
What?

474
00:38:06,722 --> 00:38:08,015
Do you still not get it?

475
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:10,226
You are my cross.

476
00:38:10,309 --> 00:38:12,061
A cross I must bear.

477
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:17,441
As the price of killing Minjo.

478
00:38:21,153 --> 00:38:23,989
I killed Minjo.

479
00:38:25,282 --> 00:38:27,743
It wasn't Father. It was me, you idiot.

480
00:38:32,456 --> 00:38:34,375
Oh, I guess you really didn't know.

481
00:38:35,918 --> 00:38:38,754
Oh, it's a shame
others can't see this face.

482
00:38:45,594 --> 00:38:48,556
Let go of me. Let go!

483
00:38:52,935 --> 00:38:55,729
Why?

484
00:38:56,313 --> 00:38:58,065
Why did you kill Minjo? Why?

485
00:38:58,149 --> 00:39:00,067
Go blame Father.

486
00:39:00,151 --> 00:39:03,529
He's the one who made me do it!

487
00:39:20,045 --> 00:39:22,089
As a father, I cannot forgive you,

488
00:39:22,756 --> 00:39:24,800
but good job eliminating your enemy

489
00:39:26,594 --> 00:39:28,179
to survive.

490
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:31,849
<i>That was</i>

491
00:39:32,641 --> 00:39:35,102
the first time he ever complimented me.

492
00:39:35,686 --> 00:39:37,188
If Minjo had taken over Haesong,

493
00:39:38,022 --> 00:39:39,648
would he have kept me alive?

494
00:39:40,733 --> 00:39:41,609
No.

495
00:39:44,153 --> 00:39:45,779
He would've killed me first.

496
00:39:46,739 --> 00:39:50,075
So take it out on him.

497
00:39:50,576 --> 00:39:52,119
Ask him why

498
00:39:53,746 --> 00:39:56,207
he made me kill Minjo.

499
00:40:03,797 --> 00:40:05,716
What can Ms. Kwon do?

500
00:40:06,759 --> 00:40:07,927
What did she witness?

501
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:12,181
Even without Ms. Kwon's testimony,
it will eventually be revealed that

502
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:14,767
the Adamas was used for the murder.

503
00:40:17,436 --> 00:40:20,439
But can it specify that I'm the culprit?

504
00:40:21,065 --> 00:40:24,109
It can't prove that I was there.

505
00:40:28,364 --> 00:40:30,074
I guess you got my point.

506
00:40:31,992 --> 00:40:33,202
I'll give you two days.

507
00:40:34,036 --> 00:40:36,121
Find the real Adamas.

508
00:40:42,127 --> 00:40:43,546
What if I refuse?

509
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:46,382
You will be safe.

510
00:40:47,841 --> 00:40:49,802
Because your brother will replace you.

511
00:41:03,899 --> 00:41:06,485
Are you crazy? How could you
meet the chairman in this situation?

512
00:41:06,569 --> 00:41:09,071
It was the only way to come here
without being suspected.

513
00:41:09,238 --> 00:41:10,489
I came here to meet you.

514
00:41:11,699 --> 00:41:12,700
Me?

515
00:41:13,409 --> 00:41:16,120
You have the video of Ms. Kwon
from the ceremony?

516
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:20,541
Did the SIH send you?

517
00:41:20,624 --> 00:41:22,418
Yes, Suhyeon asked me.

518
00:41:22,793 --> 00:41:24,587
I think he's planning something
with the SIH.

519
00:41:40,102 --> 00:41:42,229
MR. LEE

520
00:41:43,355 --> 00:41:44,732
See? He won't pick up.

521
00:41:44,815 --> 00:41:46,859
You were the target.

522
00:41:46,984 --> 00:41:48,485
I figured that out

523
00:41:48,569 --> 00:41:51,405
and stopped you with my car.
That's how you survived.

524
00:41:51,488 --> 00:41:53,073
That can't be true.

525
00:41:53,782 --> 00:41:55,409
Why would Haesong…

526
00:41:55,492 --> 00:41:58,203
I saw candidate number five
at the ceremony.

527
00:41:59,288 --> 00:42:01,081
You didn't even get invited, did you?

528
00:42:02,082 --> 00:42:05,711
That's because I had
important business to attend to…

529
00:42:05,794 --> 00:42:08,047
Oh, come on.

530
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:10,758
You're a politician,
but you're so clueless about politics.

531
00:42:11,508 --> 00:42:14,011
Anyone can see you've been tossed out.

532
00:42:14,094 --> 00:42:17,264
Haesong obviously held
two cards in their hands. One in each.

533
00:42:19,308 --> 00:42:21,685
You ran away alone
when you heard about the bomb, didn't you?

534
00:42:21,769 --> 00:42:23,812
If that goes public,
your ratings will hit rock bottom.

535
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:28,150
So what do you say?
Should we have a go at it?

536
00:42:29,485 --> 00:42:30,653
Are you threatening me?

537
00:42:30,944 --> 00:42:33,697
No, I'm asking for your cooperation.

538
00:42:39,703 --> 00:42:43,248
Jeez, you're being faithful
even in this situation.

539
00:42:43,874 --> 00:42:45,626
You sure are manly.

540
00:42:47,544 --> 00:42:49,421
Are you trying to mess with me?

541
00:42:49,505 --> 00:42:51,340
No, Haesong is.

542
00:42:53,342 --> 00:42:55,469
You could've died.

543
00:42:59,515 --> 00:43:01,850
-Hold on…
-What?

544
00:43:03,852 --> 00:43:06,063
I'm alive.

545
00:43:07,356 --> 00:43:09,942
If their plan was to kill me,

546
00:43:10,025 --> 00:43:11,902
I should be dead.

547
00:43:14,071 --> 00:43:16,615
-That's because I managed to save--
-No.

548
00:43:17,324 --> 00:43:19,910
Even if I had survived it,

549
00:43:19,993 --> 00:43:22,496
I should be dead by now.

550
00:43:24,123 --> 00:43:25,499
Is it hard to understand?

551
00:43:26,291 --> 00:43:29,878
All right, let's say you did save me.

552
00:43:29,962 --> 00:43:32,089
In return for your kindness,

553
00:43:32,381 --> 00:43:34,717
I will give you a tip.

554
00:43:37,136 --> 00:43:39,596
I was not the target.

555
00:43:41,265 --> 00:43:43,392
-Sir.
-You heard me.

556
00:43:49,022 --> 00:43:53,402
We'll never see each other again, will we?

557
00:43:53,902 --> 00:43:56,780
PROSECUTOR SONG SUHYEON

558
00:44:10,919 --> 00:44:12,254
Damn it.

559
00:44:16,717 --> 00:44:18,260
I was wrong about the bomb.

560
00:44:19,011 --> 00:44:20,512
<i>We can't get Haesong with it.</i>

561
00:44:33,192 --> 00:44:36,695
SEARCH RESULTS FOR "BOMB"
NO MATCH

562
00:44:42,826 --> 00:44:45,454
Sir, we got the trace results on the bomb.

563
00:44:46,038 --> 00:44:49,625
The components didn't match
any of those from ARES.

564
00:44:50,292 --> 00:44:51,543
Well,

565
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:54,922
the components
and the manufacturing method match ours.

566
00:45:04,139 --> 00:45:06,266
<i>The police have begun their investigation,</i>

567
00:45:06,391 --> 00:45:08,310
<i>and they're expected
to resolve the question</i>

568
00:45:08,393 --> 00:45:10,896
<i>about whether there is a mastermind
behind the culprit</i>

569
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:12,648
<i>as Candidate Hwang claims.</i>

570
00:45:12,731 --> 00:45:14,900
<i>The Election Polling Committee
of the New Future Party</i>

571
00:45:14,983 --> 00:45:17,361
<i>demanded a strict police investigation,
arguing that this was</i>

572
00:45:17,486 --> 00:45:19,696
<i>a systematic attack
against the strong candidate.</i>

573
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:23,325
<i>But the police have decided to continue
with the unbiased investigation</i>

574
00:45:23,408 --> 00:45:26,954
<i>since it's only a suspicion so far.</i>

575
00:45:29,122 --> 00:45:30,249
We've arrived.

576
00:45:31,458 --> 00:45:32,501
Okay.

577
00:45:33,335 --> 00:45:34,253
Should I escort you?

578
00:45:34,336 --> 00:45:35,963
No, wait here.

579
00:45:36,505 --> 00:45:37,464
Yes, sir.

580
00:45:56,441 --> 00:45:57,776
You're late again.

581
00:45:58,569 --> 00:45:59,736
There was a lot of traffic.

582
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,446
What would you like to have?

583
00:46:03,532 --> 00:46:05,075
Go ahead and stuff yourself.

584
00:46:07,911 --> 00:46:09,413
But the steak is good.

585
00:46:11,164 --> 00:46:12,374
What did the chairman say?

586
00:46:15,377 --> 00:46:16,420
Well…

587
00:46:17,963 --> 00:46:20,716
Are you trying to save your breath,
or are you keeping something from me?

588
00:46:21,341 --> 00:46:22,801
Either way, it's a waste of time.

589
00:46:24,761 --> 00:46:25,971
Be careful.

590
00:46:26,889 --> 00:46:28,515
You seem to have lost his favor.

591
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:29,933
Oh.

592
00:46:37,566 --> 00:46:39,651
So it's not horrible, right?

593
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:42,738
I told you to be careful.

594
00:46:43,947 --> 00:46:44,907
What?

595
00:47:00,672 --> 00:47:04,217
I already warned you before,
but you're just too careless.

596
00:47:04,301 --> 00:47:05,969
You damn brat…

597
00:47:25,781 --> 00:47:27,240
Oh, goodness.

598
00:47:31,453 --> 00:47:33,830
Jeez, damn it.

599
00:47:38,835 --> 00:47:41,588
PRESIDENT KWON HYUNJO
GWANGJANG-DONG. AT 11 TOMORROW

600
00:47:52,265 --> 00:47:53,141
That little…

601
00:47:57,521 --> 00:47:59,856
Damn it…

602
00:48:08,031 --> 00:48:10,242
You son of a…

603
00:48:13,870 --> 00:48:14,913
You…

604
00:48:53,618 --> 00:48:56,038
My Children's Day gift from Dad.

605
00:48:56,121 --> 00:48:57,622
Silly him.

606
00:48:58,623 --> 00:48:59,708
Where is he?

607
00:49:00,292 --> 00:49:02,711
I don't know.
I just found this on the floor.

608
00:49:05,297 --> 00:49:08,216
Did he go somewhere?
I bet he went to work.

609
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,803
How else do you think
he got that expensive toy?

610
00:49:12,679 --> 00:49:14,056
We're not well off.

611
00:49:42,292 --> 00:49:43,335
Hey.

612
00:49:46,963 --> 00:49:48,340
You're late.

613
00:49:49,132 --> 00:49:51,635
Why are you alone?
Didn't the SIH get you anyone?

614
00:49:51,718 --> 00:49:53,345
It'd only be a nuisance.

615
00:49:54,805 --> 00:49:56,389
What about you? Is it okay to be alone?

616
00:49:56,807 --> 00:49:58,975
Chairman Kwon said he wouldn't kill me.

617
00:49:59,059 --> 00:50:01,436
Did he say he'd kill me then?

618
00:50:03,855 --> 00:50:05,273
So he did.

619
00:50:06,399 --> 00:50:08,485
Fine, let him kill me.

620
00:50:10,278 --> 00:50:11,404
How is Ms. Kim doing?

621
00:50:11,488 --> 00:50:13,198
She'll be taken
to the police station soon.

622
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:16,993
She might be safer there for now.

623
00:50:17,994 --> 00:50:18,995
How did it go?

624
00:50:24,251 --> 00:50:25,252
Here.

625
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:29,506
Okay.

626
00:50:30,090 --> 00:50:32,509
The SIH is going to cook it up nicely.

627
00:50:34,219 --> 00:50:35,303
By the way…

628
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:39,641
…let me ask you something.

629
00:50:42,269 --> 00:50:44,354
You were after the retrial from the start,
weren't you?

630
00:50:44,437 --> 00:50:45,689
Not catching the real culprit.

631
00:50:50,694 --> 00:50:51,778
Why?

632
00:50:54,531 --> 00:50:56,324
Because Lee Changwoo is innocent.

633
00:50:56,533 --> 00:50:58,076
So why?

634
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,370
His innocence has nothing to do with you.

635
00:51:01,246 --> 00:51:03,748
Finding out who actually killed Father
should come first.

636
00:51:03,832 --> 00:51:06,835
What was so important
about stealing the Adamas for the retrial?

637
00:51:07,085 --> 00:51:10,964
And now the Adamas is destroyed,
so the murder weapon no longer exists.

638
00:51:11,047 --> 00:51:12,424
How will you do the retrial?

639
00:51:14,551 --> 00:51:15,969
What is it?

640
00:51:17,137 --> 00:51:19,014
What is it that I don't know?

641
00:51:19,181 --> 00:51:20,765
What are you keeping from me?

642
00:51:23,351 --> 00:51:24,644
Hey.

643
00:51:25,478 --> 00:51:26,605
Suhyeon.

644
00:51:27,189 --> 00:51:28,106
What is it?

645
00:51:31,401 --> 00:51:32,777
About our real father…

646
00:51:34,362 --> 00:51:35,363
Our real father?

647
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:38,074
He is…

648
00:51:41,369 --> 00:51:42,370
Darn it.

649
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,544
<i>Ms. Kwon, your statement isn't credible.</i>

650
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,964
<i>It's all just an assumption, not a fact.</i>

651
00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:04,309
I will avenge you, son.

652
00:52:05,393 --> 00:52:07,729
I will make sure to take revenge for you.

653
00:52:11,441 --> 00:52:12,734
You have a visitor.

654
00:52:16,112 --> 00:52:18,156
POLICE CHIEF'S OFFICE

655
00:52:40,553 --> 00:52:44,140
You're here to see me at this hour?
I wonder what you're trying to pull.

656
00:52:48,353 --> 00:52:49,771
Speak.

657
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:53,316
-Kwon.
-Don't treat me like I'm your butler!

658
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,693
It gives me the creeps.

659
00:52:54,776 --> 00:52:56,778
I'm not your servant anymore.

660
00:52:56,861 --> 00:52:58,196
Are you going to end it like this?

661
00:53:00,323 --> 00:53:03,743
After what you did at the ceremony,
are you just going to give up?

662
00:53:05,787 --> 00:53:06,997
Kwon Jaekyu.

663
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:09,791
Think about what he did to your son.

664
00:53:11,209 --> 00:53:14,838
Don't you dare speak of my son.
You know nothing!

665
00:53:14,921 --> 00:53:16,214
He wasn't brain-dead.

666
00:53:18,591 --> 00:53:20,427
Your son was alive.

667
00:53:23,638 --> 00:53:26,474
He made it look like
he was brain-dead and took…

668
00:53:26,558 --> 00:53:28,435
Shut up.

669
00:53:28,518 --> 00:53:30,270
He took a heart out of a man
who was still alive.

670
00:53:31,604 --> 00:53:32,647
I said, shut up.

671
00:53:33,231 --> 00:53:35,191
Shut up!

672
00:53:43,450 --> 00:53:44,701
Help me.

673
00:53:45,952 --> 00:53:48,246
You know everything about Chairman Kwon.

674
00:53:48,747 --> 00:53:50,457
Tell me what I should do.

675
00:53:53,168 --> 00:53:54,502
I will destroy

676
00:53:56,629 --> 00:53:57,797
Chairman Kwon…

677
00:54:01,718 --> 00:54:03,094
and Haesong.

678
00:54:15,273 --> 00:54:17,609
My father hardly drinks,

679
00:54:17,692 --> 00:54:19,903
but there was one time
when he got really drunk.

680
00:54:20,403 --> 00:54:23,615
He was so delighted that
he had finally become one of your people.

681
00:54:26,284 --> 00:54:28,078
At that time, he told me

682
00:54:28,161 --> 00:54:31,247
that you offered him a gift
to mark the occasion.

683
00:54:34,084 --> 00:54:35,752
And you needed a name

684
00:54:36,669 --> 00:54:37,670
from him.

685
00:54:39,130 --> 00:54:41,466
He shouldn't have told you that.

686
00:54:41,549 --> 00:54:44,511
I have never called you Father.

687
00:54:45,261 --> 00:54:46,846
But if I become one of your people,

688
00:54:48,264 --> 00:54:49,849
I may be able to.

689
00:54:52,769 --> 00:54:53,770
Really?

690
00:54:55,563 --> 00:54:56,731
If that's what you say…

691
00:55:07,367 --> 00:55:08,493
Do you mean this?

692
00:55:09,077 --> 00:55:10,036
Yes.

693
00:55:11,496 --> 00:55:13,790
Because he killed Minjo.

694
00:55:18,795 --> 00:55:21,506
KWON HYUNJO

695
00:55:23,383 --> 00:55:24,676
Will you accept it?

696
00:55:27,137 --> 00:55:28,388
It's too late.

697
00:55:30,807 --> 00:55:32,976
Hyunjo has already paid the price.

698
00:55:40,525 --> 00:55:42,277
Did you have fun with Eun Hyesoo?

699
00:55:43,653 --> 00:55:44,654
Pardon?

700
00:55:46,781 --> 00:55:49,451
You've been her spy,

701
00:55:50,493 --> 00:55:53,037
leaking company information
here and there.

702
00:55:54,706 --> 00:55:55,915
Well, that's--

703
00:55:55,999 --> 00:55:59,210
I must say, you're unexpectedly smart.

704
00:56:00,962 --> 00:56:02,213
Right.

705
00:56:04,299 --> 00:56:07,719
You're supposed to jump back and forth

706
00:56:11,097 --> 00:56:14,392
and see whose bandwagon is better.

707
00:56:16,269 --> 00:56:17,395
Right?

708
00:56:21,816 --> 00:56:23,485
I saw Yoon Sun at Haesongwon.

709
00:56:26,571 --> 00:56:28,198
Did she get an order
to finish off Mr. Lee?

710
00:56:29,574 --> 00:56:30,909
Is she going to kill him?

711
00:56:32,911 --> 00:56:36,289
Yes, he's already been taken care of.

712
00:56:43,171 --> 00:56:44,923
<i>I gave him a punishment.</i>

713
00:56:45,507 --> 00:56:47,217
To see you all his life

714
00:56:48,343 --> 00:56:49,844
and remember Minjo.

715
00:56:52,472 --> 00:56:53,848
What else could I have done?

716
00:56:54,432 --> 00:56:56,559
He's the only heir of Haesong.

717
00:56:59,145 --> 00:57:01,606
Tell me when you come to miss Minjo.

718
00:57:04,192 --> 00:57:05,902
I'll send you to him myself.

719
00:57:11,282 --> 00:57:12,367
Hyesoo.

720
00:57:19,082 --> 00:57:21,042
That's not how you bargain with someone.

721
00:57:26,673 --> 00:57:28,091
You want to be one of my people?

722
00:57:29,717 --> 00:57:31,386
If you want something,

723
00:57:31,469 --> 00:57:34,722
you need to offer what the other wants.
That's how you make a deal.

724
00:57:39,227 --> 00:57:40,603
What do you want?

725
00:57:44,023 --> 00:57:45,567
What can you offer?

726
00:57:58,037 --> 00:57:59,247
I'll give you

727
00:58:01,791 --> 00:58:03,084
what you want.

728
00:58:10,133 --> 00:58:13,678
Following the all-night investigation,
a strict interrogation is ongoing.

729
00:58:13,761 --> 00:58:15,555
The identity of the female suspect

730
00:58:15,638 --> 00:58:17,765
has yet to be released.

731
00:58:17,849 --> 00:58:19,892
WHAT'S YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH CANDIDATE HWANG?

732
00:58:23,354 --> 00:58:25,148
I told you already.

733
00:58:25,231 --> 00:58:27,942
I have no hard feelings
against Hwang Byungchul.

734
00:58:28,026 --> 00:58:31,321
Your past articles say otherwise.

735
00:58:31,404 --> 00:58:33,615
They are full of hatred.

736
00:58:34,407 --> 00:58:37,493
And Candidate Hwang sued you
once every quarter.

737
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:41,873
That's because he's just too filthy.

738
00:58:42,582 --> 00:58:43,916
Look.

739
00:58:44,584 --> 00:58:46,127
I was kidnapped.

740
00:58:47,712 --> 00:58:49,088
-You were kidnapped?
-Yes.

741
00:58:49,964 --> 00:58:51,299
They plotted this incident

742
00:58:51,382 --> 00:58:55,428
to link me to Hwang Byungchul.

743
00:58:55,511 --> 00:58:56,763
Mm…

744
00:58:57,430 --> 00:58:58,264
I see.

745
00:58:58,348 --> 00:58:59,766
What was the purpose then?

746
00:58:59,849 --> 00:59:01,142
Lee Changwoo the notorious thief.

747
00:59:01,225 --> 00:59:03,811
I witnessed

748
00:59:03,895 --> 00:59:05,313
the only murder he committed.

749
00:59:05,813 --> 00:59:07,815
I kept digging into that case,

750
00:59:07,899 --> 00:59:09,859
and they did this to me.

751
00:59:09,942 --> 00:59:11,444
To silence me.

752
00:59:14,322 --> 00:59:17,408
How great are these people
that they plotted a bombing attack?

753
00:59:17,492 --> 00:59:18,701
It makes no sense.

754
00:59:18,785 --> 00:59:21,537
Haesong Group. Chairman Kwon Jaekyu.

755
00:59:22,413 --> 00:59:23,665
Does it make sense now?

756
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:28,461
Fine.

757
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:32,882
All right, but why did you go to the SIH?

758
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:40,598
Because those who kidnapped me
made me go there.

759
00:59:45,436 --> 00:59:46,604
Kang Hyukpil.

760
00:59:49,273 --> 00:59:50,358
Don't you know him?

761
00:59:53,277 --> 00:59:54,195
I don't.

762
00:59:54,779 --> 00:59:56,614
Don't you think this will take a while?

763
00:59:57,198 --> 00:59:58,658
Let's eat first.

764
00:59:59,117 --> 01:00:00,535
I'll have <i>galbitang.</i>

765
01:00:01,202 --> 01:00:02,245
Jeez.

766
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:05,707
An extra-large, please.

767
01:00:06,582 --> 01:00:08,292
<i>You were right, Prosecutor Song.</i>

768
01:00:08,376 --> 01:00:10,753
They copied a core component of ours.

769
01:00:10,837 --> 01:00:12,880
If this goes public,

770
01:00:13,673 --> 01:00:15,133
it will get out of control.

771
01:00:15,216 --> 01:00:16,843
We saw it coming.

772
01:00:17,468 --> 01:00:20,555
What they want is an all-out war
with everything on the line.

773
01:00:22,223 --> 01:00:24,767
I'm ready for it. What about you?

774
01:00:35,945 --> 01:00:37,488
With everything on the line?

775
01:00:38,698 --> 01:00:39,991
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

776
01:00:40,074 --> 01:00:42,368
You're finally at work.

777
01:00:42,952 --> 01:00:46,330
I thought you defected to North Korea
instead of being on sick leave.

778
01:00:46,414 --> 01:00:50,334
Come on, sir. Must you welcome me back
in such a lame way?

779
01:00:50,418 --> 01:00:52,253
Just get out and do your job, punk.

780
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:56,841
Prosecutor Han was demoted
to the Chuncheon district office,

781
01:00:56,924 --> 01:00:59,302
so the Kangchun case
has lost its direction.

782
01:00:59,677 --> 01:01:01,137
You should take over.

783
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:04,307
I'm not interested
in what was once someone else's.

784
01:01:04,390 --> 01:01:05,558
What am I, a beggar?

785
01:01:05,641 --> 01:01:07,101
What did you say?

786
01:01:08,186 --> 01:01:09,353
Help me with this.

787
01:01:10,354 --> 01:01:13,316
-Hey!
-The sooner, the better.

788
01:01:26,954 --> 01:01:29,832
Should I serve our guest
a cup of coffee or something?

789
01:01:29,916 --> 01:01:31,292
What would you like, ma'am?

790
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:33,878
Do you not want anything to drink?

791
01:01:40,301 --> 01:01:42,553
I'll be outside.

792
01:01:54,482 --> 01:01:56,150
Haesong must be watching you.

793
01:01:56,234 --> 01:01:57,610
It's too late to play it safe.

794
01:01:58,861 --> 01:01:59,946
I'm not afraid of dying.

795
01:02:01,531 --> 01:02:02,532
What do you want?

796
01:02:03,115 --> 01:02:06,160
Chairman Kwon kept you alive
for a reason, didn't he?

797
01:02:06,869 --> 01:02:07,787
What is the reason?

798
01:02:08,996 --> 01:02:10,957
It has nothing to do with you, Ms. Eun.

799
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:12,750
It'll have something to do with me now.

800
01:02:14,627 --> 01:02:17,004
Does he want you to find the real Adamas?

801
01:02:22,885 --> 01:02:23,719
So he does.

802
01:02:24,971 --> 01:02:26,138
Do you know why

803
01:02:27,056 --> 01:02:29,433
Chairman Kwon is trying
to find the Adamas?

804
01:02:31,269 --> 01:02:34,272
He thinks the owner of Haesong
should have it.

805
01:02:34,355 --> 01:02:35,982
It's such an old-fashioned idea.

806
01:02:36,983 --> 01:02:39,861
As if it's a crown or a royal seal…
Isn't that ridiculous?

807
01:02:39,944 --> 01:02:41,320
What is your point?

808
01:02:41,404 --> 01:02:42,530
The Adamas.

809
01:02:45,032 --> 01:02:46,576
Bring it to me.

810
01:02:47,827 --> 01:02:49,704
Chairman Kwon said that

811
01:02:49,787 --> 01:02:52,707
if you want to bargain with someone,
you need to offer what they want.

812
01:02:57,169 --> 01:02:59,297
So do you plan to give him the Adamas?

813
01:03:00,381 --> 01:03:01,716
No.

814
01:03:03,175 --> 01:03:04,302
Are you curious?

815
01:03:05,845 --> 01:03:07,096
What do you say?

816
01:03:09,098 --> 01:03:10,391
Are you interested?

817
01:03:13,227 --> 01:03:15,146
I'll give you what you want.

818
01:03:18,983 --> 01:03:20,860
-What I want?
-Lee Changwoo.

819
01:03:25,031 --> 01:03:26,699
Don't you want to save him?

820
01:03:34,832 --> 01:03:36,334
Bring it to me.

821
01:04:04,654 --> 01:04:07,365
What brings you here this time?

822
01:04:08,366 --> 01:04:10,618
I told you never to come again.

823
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:14,830
How have you been?

824
01:04:16,082 --> 01:04:18,084
Well, forget about catching up.

825
01:04:19,877 --> 01:04:21,087
I'll just get to the point.

826
01:04:24,215 --> 01:04:25,758
I know

827
01:04:26,884 --> 01:04:28,260
who you are.

828
01:04:29,470 --> 01:04:30,638
What do you

829
01:04:32,598 --> 01:04:34,475
know about me?

830
01:04:34,558 --> 01:04:35,768
You know Team A, don't you?

831
01:04:36,394 --> 01:04:39,730
A secret organization
that deals with dirty work for Haesong.

832
01:04:39,814 --> 01:04:43,693
You were once a member of its predecessor,
the Management Support Team.

833
01:04:44,694 --> 01:04:46,237
An ace at that.

834
01:04:47,613 --> 01:04:49,782
The organization discarded you

835
01:04:49,991 --> 01:04:52,243
by having you get arrested
for nine charges of theft,

836
01:04:52,994 --> 01:04:55,121
and you were stuck in jail for 15 years.

837
01:04:56,580 --> 01:05:00,626
It's not that I want to hear an epic tale
about the great notorious thief.

838
01:05:02,461 --> 01:05:04,296
What I want to know is…

839
01:05:05,297 --> 01:05:06,549
<i>Suhyeon.</i>

840
01:05:07,883 --> 01:05:09,343
About our real father…

841
01:05:10,136 --> 01:05:11,053
Our real father?

842
01:05:11,137 --> 01:05:13,264
Yes, we never talked about it,

843
01:05:13,347 --> 01:05:17,393
but you knew our biological father
was someone else, didn't you?

844
01:05:19,145 --> 01:05:22,481
Yes, I eventually figured it out
as I grew up.

845
01:05:24,191 --> 01:05:26,193
I happened to overhear
our parents' conversation too.

846
01:05:27,361 --> 01:05:28,946
Why are you suddenly bringing that up?

847
01:05:30,906 --> 01:05:32,867
Mom left a message before she died.

848
01:05:34,452 --> 01:05:37,329
-What do you mean?
-Lee Changwoo was falsely charged.

849
01:05:41,417 --> 01:05:42,626
He is…

850
01:05:44,045 --> 01:05:45,254
That man is…

851
01:05:47,673 --> 01:05:49,008
Darn it.

852
01:05:52,636 --> 01:05:53,846
…our biological father.

853
01:06:03,773 --> 01:06:04,690
Prosecutor Song.

854
01:06:08,027 --> 01:06:10,821
What is it that you want to know?

855
01:06:11,405 --> 01:06:12,531
What was that?

856
01:06:20,372 --> 01:06:22,249
Less than a month

857
01:06:22,333 --> 01:06:24,710
after you finished serving 15 years
in prison,

858
01:06:25,836 --> 01:06:28,672
you murdered my father.

859
01:06:34,053 --> 01:06:37,014
I really don't see
why we're back on this topic.

860
01:06:37,431 --> 01:06:38,349
It's all over.

861
01:06:38,432 --> 01:06:39,975
Because you're not the real culprit.

862
01:06:41,811 --> 01:06:44,188
-Prosecutor.
-Because I must catch the real culprit.

863
01:06:44,271 --> 01:06:47,191
-Prosecutor Song.
-Because I'll defend you from now on.

864
01:06:50,611 --> 01:06:52,029
He's crazy.

865
01:06:52,113 --> 01:06:53,280
CHIEF PROSECUTOR YANG WOOKJIN

866
01:06:53,364 --> 01:06:54,281
Darn him!

867
01:06:55,991 --> 01:06:59,161
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

868
01:07:00,412 --> 01:07:01,580
Mr. Lee.

869
01:07:03,624 --> 01:07:06,544
I am your defense attorney.

870
01:07:32,862 --> 01:07:35,322
<i>I'm going to make sure
that everyone knows you're innocent.</i>

871
01:07:36,949 --> 01:07:39,410
How about working directly under me now?

872
01:07:40,244 --> 01:07:41,829
<i>The mastermind behind the terror bombing.</i>

873
01:07:42,872 --> 01:07:44,540
<i>Was it Prosecutor Song</i>

874
01:07:44,623 --> 01:07:46,000
<i>or Mr. Kang?</i>

875
01:07:46,625 --> 01:07:50,045
<i>I heard the SIH was making
an important announcement, so I came.</i>

876
01:07:50,713 --> 01:07:52,006
Do you have time for this?

877
01:07:53,507 --> 01:07:55,426
<i>What will happen to Ms. Kwon?</i>

878
01:07:56,010 --> 01:07:57,178
<i>Please…</i>

879
01:07:59,096 --> 01:08:00,014
die.
