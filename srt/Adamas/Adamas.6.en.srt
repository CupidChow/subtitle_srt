1
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,463
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,965
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:14,976
He's getting rid of the evidence.

4
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,393
Gosh, that wakes me up.

5
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,938
Wait, the chairman's office?

6
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:47,190
But the chairman's not here.

7
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,817
Oh, it's...

8
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:50,944
It's Ms. Oh.

9
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:56,366
Jeez, I told her to be right on time
at ten, but she's late again.

10
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,618
Hey.

11
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,621
Let me take a ten-minute break.

12
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,249
Sure, go ahead.

13
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:37,948
It's not there?

14
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,618
The Adamas is gone?

15
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:43,872
Then where could it be?

16
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:47,667
Ms. Kwon. I think she took it with her.

17
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,127
So you're saying...

18
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,297
This is driving me nuts.

19
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:56,342
Okay, then we're on standby.

20
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,846
Headquarters might be able
to get some info for us. Let's wait.

21
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:03,016
Apparently, they've caught a big fish.

22
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,101
Hey, don't do it.

23
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,056
Sir.

24
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,059
I'm not sure about this.

25
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,924
Maybe I should've done it instead.
What if he really dies?

26
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,277
What do you mean?

27
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,696
Isn't that just an anesthetic?

28
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:08,456
What have you done?

29
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,793
Do you think he could fool him
with a fake?

30
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,548
Are you telling me that
it really is a muscle relaxant?

31
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,550
Even truth serum didn't work on him.

32
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:22,470
- He needs to experience near-death...
- Are you insane?

33
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,556
Prosecutor Song isn't aware of this.

34
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:26,975
Darn...

35
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,148
It will paralyze his respiratory muscles
only for a moment.

36
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,942
If it goes south,
I'll take responsibility.

37
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:37,277
Responsibility?

38
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,613
What, do you have a knack
for bringing the dead back to life?

39
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:42,949
I thought you were just,
so how could you...

40
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:45,368
Go talk about justice somewhere else!
This isn't it!

41
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,370
Yes, that's exactly what I'm going to do.

42
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,788
You lunatics.

43
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:57,755
Ms. Kim.

44
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,049
- Let go!
- Ms. Kim.

45
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,093
Let go of me.

46
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,266
Calm down.

47
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,571
Justice? What do you think that is?

48
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:24,073
Showing mercy even to murderers?

49
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:27,160
Whatever you say
can't justify this situation.

50
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,329
Even if he's the scumbag
who killed your parents?

51
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:34,417
You can't let him die
when you let your parents die?

52
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:37,962
My justice
is to be the lesser evil if I must.

53
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:39,797
To defeat the worst.

54
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:44,052
You blame us
because we're doing what you can't do.

55
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:45,762
Is that your justice?

56
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:49,974
That's too easy, isn't it?

57
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:56,814
Just go take a walk.

58
00:05:58,274 --> 00:05:59,692
Leave this up to us.

59
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,878
<i>Even if he's the scumbag
who killed your parents?</i>

60
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,430
They captured who?

61
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:32,892
The punk who tailed Prosecutor Song.
He tried to hurt the female reporter too.

62
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:34,268
He's being interrogated now.

63
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,770
Mr. Choi.

64
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,775
Something doesn't feel right.

65
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:42,360
What do you mean?

66
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,320
They captured him?

67
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,531
Captured...

68
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,912
I planted a GPS biochip in my left hand.

69
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,791
<i>In case something happens to me
while trying to steal the Adamas.</i>

70
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,627
<i>Worst case, I wanted
my dead body to be found</i>

71
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,379
<i>so that Chairman Kwon could be arrested.</i>

72
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:05,800
But the guy being held captive
isn't the man in the composite.

73
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:08,177
And his age doesn't match
the case from 22 years ago.

74
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,638
I don't know
how he's related to the culprit,

75
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:12,723
but he must have a connection
to the chairman.

76
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,183
Do you think such a guy

77
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:18,271
would move around
without any protective means?

78
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,404
Hey.

79
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,114
Hey.

80
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:31,909
What's wrong with you?

81
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,453
Hey!

82
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,483
The SIH is in danger.

83
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,443
Hey!

84
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,213
We got a signal 200 meters ahead.

85
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:28,591
The four of you, go this way.
The rest will go around through the woods.

86
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,384
- Let's hurry.
- Don't we need masks?

87
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:31,968
No.

88
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,160
Even if he's the scumbag
who killed your parents?

89
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,121
This isn't right.

90
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,626
This is wrong.
I have to let Song Suhyeon know.

91
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,341
What was that?

92
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,723
Are you kidding me?

93
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,766
If he dies, it's murder!

94
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,686
We can't afford to be picky here.
What a gentleman.

95
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,730
Is this how the SIH works?
Dirtying their hands?

96
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:08,649
If you're unhappy with what we do,
get off our ship. I'm the captain.

97
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:12,320
Sure, captain. Just give me
the damn antidote. Bastard!

98
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,490
Mr. Kang, we have a Code Gray situation.

99
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:17,950
Where?

100
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,368
The vigilance team radioed us.

101
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:23,372
Code Gray?

102
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,707
Security risks have appeared.

103
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,428
Kim Seohee?

104
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,807
Four men, all armed with guns.

105
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,894
- Communication's been cut off.
- And the other teams?

106
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,729
I think Bravo and Charlie are down too.

107
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,815
We can't confirm
how many attacked those teams.

108
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:02,995
They aren't wearing masks.

109
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:10,503
They plan to kill us all.

110
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,321
Darn it, why is it so slow?

111
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:43,911
They destroyed the mobile base station
and attacked the vigilance team first.

112
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:44,994
Armed with guns?

113
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:48,416
- Sir.
- Damn it, it's Team A.

114
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:49,625
Team A?

115
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,210
Let's pull out. Issue a Code Black.

116
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,129
Code Black.

117
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,306
Please...

118
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:11,188
Ms. Kim. Where's Ms. Kim?

119
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,189
It's too late.

120
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,525
They came from the direction
Ms. Kim was headed.

121
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,194
- Prosecutor Song!
- Prosecutor Song!

122
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:18,654
Darn it.

123
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,238
Let's go.

124
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,282
No one's at the backup point.

125
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,618
Gosh, they ran off.

126
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,495
Should we keep him alive to get some info?

127
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,414
No, we've already got a girl.

128
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:21,509
Find Mr. Lee.

129
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:22,802
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

130
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,154
What is it?

131
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:29,285
Is it too bright?

132
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,460
Why did they have to make me watch her?

133
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,088
While they're having all the fun.

134
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,800
I thought I'd work up a sweat
for a change.

135
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,218
That girl totally ruined it.

136
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:12,328
Darn it.

137
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,801
Prosecutor Song.

138
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,053
I almost couldn't find you.

139
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:37,895
Run.

140
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,648
Damn it...

141
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:12,012
Listen carefully.
When I give you a sign, run forward.

142
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,347
I'll be right behind you.

143
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,516
What about you?
It'll be dangerous for you.

144
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,226
Then will you run behind me?

145
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:20,145
No time to argue.
Just run when I give you the sign.

146
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,107
One.

147
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,525
Come out.

148
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:25,818
Two.

149
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:27,069
Aren't you going to run?

150
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,152
Three.

151
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,746
Don't stop. Keep running.

152
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:58,976
Joonho.

153
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,272
Joonho.

154
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,149
It's me. Wake up.

155
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:08,485
Joonho? Your brother's here.

156
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:10,654
Wake up.

157
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,238
Hey.

158
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:15,117
Open your eyes.

159
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,076
Joonho.

160
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:20,080
Hey, punk. Your brother's here.

161
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,458
Wake up!

162
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,042
Joonho!

163
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,004
- Gosh.
- This.

164
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,884
Damn it.
Hey, take him to the hospital now.

165
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,009
Yes, sir.

166
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:37,139
Those bastards.

167
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:53,655
Sir, take a look at this.

168
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,416
Son of a gun.

169
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:07,961
- What's going on?
- The laptop...

170
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:11,256
Bastards. I'm going to kill them all.

171
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,346
- It's a time bomb.
- So what?

172
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,847
- A bomb!
- Let go!

173
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,433
- We have to go!
- Get off me!

174
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,060
- Let go.
- Come to your senses!

175
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,646
- Song Suhyeon, I'm going to kill you.
- Mr. Lee.

176
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,940
You bastard.

177
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,691
Song Suhyeon!

178
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:42,955
Let's go.

179
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:04,017
Ms. Jang? You mean that famous...

180
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:06,854
Right, I contacted her myself.

181
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,733
Because of the Adamas.

182
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:17,614
What are you going to do?

183
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,204
I'm going to bury the past.

184
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,213
Sleeping?

185
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,635
About that ghostwriter.

186
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:42,222
My father is quite fond of him.

187
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,808
What's your take?

188
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:48,020
There must be a reason.

189
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:52,566
I'm not sure. I'm not really interested.

190
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,613
I'm a bit curious.

191
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,702
<i>You can't reach them?</i>

192
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,287
I think they were raided.

193
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,667
There's no time to waste, Mr. Ha.
We must get out of here now.

194
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:12,886
I'm telling you,
there's no time to hesitate.

195
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,505
Where did they move the Adamas to?

196
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:16,924
In this situation?

197
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,884
No, why? For what reason?

198
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,512
I'm sure there's a reason.
I must figure it out.

199
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:25,057
So, you will stay here in this house?

200
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:26,552
Should I leave empty-handed?

201
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,852
Are you insane? They got to the SIH.

202
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:30,687
They'll find us out in no time.

203
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,147
So, will you leave?

204
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,526
Neither can I.

205
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:45,827
You know we're in a dangerous situation.

206
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,579
We can't be sure how things are outside.

207
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,498
It'd be reckless to just leave.

208
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:54,086
Let's try to hold out
until we get back in touch with the SIH.

209
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,343
Will you be okay?

210
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,014
I'm talking about Prosecutor Song.

211
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,425
You must be worried about him.

212
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,437
He will be fine.

213
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,649
He can take care of himself.

214
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:22,781
- Thank you.
- No problem.

215
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:26,243
HOMESTEAD GRAPES AND APPLES

216
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,370
It's Woosin's place.

217
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,184
Face recognition?

218
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,769
That's high-tech.

219
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,896
He's very particular, you see.

220
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,358
Still, you two must be quite close.
Your face is in the system.

221
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:01,403
Well, we kept in touch.

222
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:02,987
Let's go inside.

223
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:09,578
This place is under the publisher's name,
so I think it'd be safer than home.

224
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:14,708
Shouldn't we go
to the head office of the SIH?

225
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,087
The infiltration team
doesn't exist on paper,

226
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,531
so we can't get their help anyway.

227
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,300
Let's rest here for now.

228
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,388
My.

229
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:31,767
Wow.

230
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:36,271
Your brother must love himself dearly.

231
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:39,149
Well, he's a weirdo.

232
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,740
The bathroom is that way. Go straight.

233
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:48,533
Okay.

234
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,260
He passed away.

235
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,682
I tried my best to save him,
but when he got here, he was already...

236
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:13,850
Get out.

237
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,118
Rest in peace.

238
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:33,870
I will...

239
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:37,374
I will make sure...

240
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:45,257
I don't know what to say.

241
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:47,175
Song Suhyeon has a brother, right?

242
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,511
Yes, a twin brother.

243
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:50,846
Get him.

244
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:56,184
I must return the favor.

245
00:23:58,603 --> 00:23:59,855
Yes, sir.

246
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,994
Idiot.

247
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,420
I'm sorry, sir.

248
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:33,180
You lost Kim Seohee?

249
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:35,432
There was a sudden attack from behind...

250
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:41,563
You little punk.
Is that all you have to say?

251
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,235
Sir.

252
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:07,005
Trace Song Suhyeon's every move
and locate him.

253
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,507
Yes, sir.

254
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:14,221
And

255
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:16,056
call Sun.

256
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:23,188
What is this?

257
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:36,535
Don't be intimidated, Kim Seohee.

258
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,915
- Yes?
- I put some clothes outside the door.

259
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:43,458
Okay.

260
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,711
<i>A fire broke out
at a privately owned cabin,</i>

261
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:49,422
<i>causing the death of five members
of a mountain cycling club.</i>

262
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,841
- Prosecutor Song.
- Ms. Kim.

263
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:54,427
<i>This was once a cabin
in Cheongpa-gun, Ganggyeong-do.</i>

264
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:58,306
<i>It was burned down due to the fire
and now its structure hardly remains.</i>

265
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:01,434
<i>The fire department in Cheongpa
presumes that the fire was caused</i>

266
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:03,520
<i>by a liquefied petroleum gas explosion.</i>

267
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,356
<i>It is highly probable
that leftover gas leaked</i>

268
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:08,233
<i>from an abandoned gas pipe
behind the cabin,</i>

269
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:11,152
<i>resulting in this gas explosion.</i>

270
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:13,863
<i>Due to this accident,
31-year-old Kim and four others</i>

271
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:17,075
<i>were taken to a nearby hospital,
but they ended up passing away.</i>

272
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:25,702
We confirmed they're alive through CCTV
footage from a training center nearby,

273
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,753
and currently analyzing the footage
to figure out where they went.

274
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:32,048
We'll hurry,
since Team A will be after them too.

275
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:34,342
I bet they will.

276
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:36,928
But I wonder.

277
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:40,181
Did they survive it? Or were they spared?

278
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:44,603
Are you suggesting
that Team A didn't kill them on purpose?

279
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,980
This could be their bait to get us.

280
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,899
Once you locate the two,
don't contact them but wait.

281
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,735
Until they make a move first.

282
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,155
Yes, sir. Then what about Ha Woosin?

283
00:26:56,865 --> 00:27:00,785
Now that they know about Prosecutor Song,
Mr. Ha will inevitably be in danger.

284
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:02,161
Should we extract him?

285
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:07,459
Leave him be. The more decoys, the better.

286
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:09,586
It will give us a better chance
to catch our target.

287
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:11,921
But sir...

288
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:14,007
Be generous with the condolence money
for our guys.

289
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:18,887
Yes, sir.

290
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:32,733
Lee Dongrim.

291
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:37,238
Don't try to get friendly with me.
It's not going to work.

292
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,032
Are you out to mess up my life too?

293
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,786
You sound cranky,
but your face makes it obvious.

294
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:44,954
That you like me.

295
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,791
Me? No.

296
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:48,874
Yes.

297
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,586
Or why did you even play
the voice recorder you stole?

298
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,546
You could've handed it
to Ms. Kwon right away.

299
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:56,104
- That's...
- Before you handed it to her,

300
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:58,718
you wanted to delete anything important.

301
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,932
But it was more serious than you thought.

302
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:06,101
So you brought it back to me.

303
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,354
What? So what?

304
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:11,147
Whatever I do, just feign ignorance.

305
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,066
I won't cause you any harm.

306
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:14,150
You already...

307
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,611
You've already caused me enough harm.

308
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,312
Should I get you something more?

309
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:30,375
How did it go?

310
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:31,918
I got in touch with them.

311
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:34,671
How's Suhyeon?

312
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,381
He's all right.

313
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,174
He's unharmed.

314
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:40,218
That's good to hear.

315
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:43,555
Yes, it's good.

316
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:46,391
But we still have a problem to solve.

317
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:48,893
I have no idea why the Adamas disappeared
and where it went.

318
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:53,815
I plan to sneak
into the chairman's office again.

319
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:57,444
- Again?
- I need to find the Adamas.

320
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,195
And I have something to check.

321
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:01,823
Going all out, are you?

322
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:05,076
The surveillance system
is on 24 hours a day.

323
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,871
So how, in broad daylight at that?

324
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,081
Are you sure it's 24 hours?

325
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:13,585
It can't be flying in the sky
all day long.

326
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,503
It needs time to recharge.

327
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:21,468
You'll sneak in when it lands to recharge?

328
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:22,802
That'd be too short.

329
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,304
Ms. Oh is coming.

330
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:39,360
Ms. Oh.

331
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,738
You should be more punctual.

332
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,072
What?

333
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,450
You did your final check
after ten o'clock again.

334
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:48,161
If Ms. Kwon finds out,
we're the ones who'll get in trouble.

335
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,622
What are you talking about?

336
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:53,458
Last night. Mr. Kim told me.

337
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:57,003
Someone was in the chairman's office.
So I asked who it was,

338
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,338
and he said it was you.

339
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:04,260
Am I wrong?

340
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:07,347
You're right.

341
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:10,600
I loafed around a little
because Ms. Kwon isn't here. Sorry.

342
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,563
Let's see...

343
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:23,279
<i>Mr. Kim lied.</i>

344
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,240
<i>Why?</i>

345
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:49,472
- Father?
- The sun's been up for hours.

346
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,017
Have you gone senile?

347
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:56,104
You shouldn't come into my bedroom
unnoticed like this.

348
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,730
Stop complaining and wake up.

349
00:30:57,814 --> 00:31:00,149
I don't want to. I'm still sleepy.

350
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:01,568
How can you be so carefree?

351
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:03,451
You've been married
for more than three years.

352
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:04,973
How come you aren't pregnant yet?

353
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:08,950
What if your husband ends up
having a son out of wedlock?

354
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:12,412
That would be great news.

355
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:14,706
Hyesoo.

356
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:22,797
I don't want anyone else
to live in this nightmare.

357
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,340
Especially not my child.

358
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,342
You won't give the Kwons an heir?

359
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:27,468
I won't.

360
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:30,430
I need something to live for, don't I?

361
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:37,520
Wash up. We're having lunch
with your father-in-law.

362
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,337
You look pretty.

363
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:06,090
The bride in white.

364
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,802
Minjo would've been delighted to see you.

365
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,347
Ah.

366
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:15,058
He might be watching from above, right?

367
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:19,479
This marriage is nothing
but a business transaction.

368
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:24,609
Consider it marketing
on your father's behalf.

369
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,569
Just keep your promise.

370
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:29,238
What promise? Divorce?

371
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,690
I said I'll divorce you
as soon as my father passes away.

372
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,705
So use your time to pray
instead of hating me.

373
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:39,582
Pray for him to die soon.

374
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,292
I still don't get it.

375
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:43,962
Why you want to marry me.

376
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:47,006
Do you still not get it?

377
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:49,968
I can't marry anyone
just because I want to.

378
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,720
Not unless it's what my father wants.

379
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:57,600
- So why would the chairman...
- This is your problem.

380
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,437
You're too complicated.

381
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:04,732
Why do you even ask?

382
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:08,653
If I tell you, will you choose
not to walk down the aisle?

383
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:15,159
My father has no mercy for things that
displease him, not even his children.

384
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,369
So how dare you...

385
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:29,424
Smile.

386
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,550
It's a happy day.

387
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,641
Anyway, just come.

388
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,810
I'm telling you to come.

389
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,898
Before you lose his favor even more,

390
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,776
you have to keep seeing him.

391
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:31,903
Yes.

392
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:37,116
What's taking her so long?

393
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:44,832
Where's Hyesoo?

394
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,834
She left just now.

395
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:48,544
Why that...

396
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:52,507
LEGALIZATION OF FIREARMS
MARKETING PROPOSAL

397
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:04,727
This is like a disease.

398
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:07,939
Why am I in love with you?

399
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:39,137
Should we grab lunch? Whatever you like.

400
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,265
I have to be with the chairman.

401
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:46,144
I just came to see you before I left.

402
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,897
I hate this.

403
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:57,488
Let's have lunch next time.
We'll have something you like.

404
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:05,788
My father's doing this on purpose.

405
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:08,082
Always keeping you by his side.

406
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:09,917
It's to punish me.

407
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,980
How's your hip joint?

408
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:32,899
It's all right.

409
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,526
You have to recover soon
so we can drink together.

410
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:36,861
Of course.

411
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:39,989
How is your hospital doing?

412
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:42,283
It's doing well, thanks to you.

413
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:49,540
How do you like the sashimi?

414
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:51,834
It's good.

415
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:54,420
It's natural saw-edged perch
from Jeju Island.

416
00:36:58,257 --> 00:36:59,675
Are you trying to take credit?

417
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:05,348
If I do, will you give me credit?

418
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:09,143
This is what I like about you.

419
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:12,271
You don't get intimidated
even when you're with me.

420
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:15,566
I guess we've done enough catching up.

421
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:17,818
What is it you had to say?

422
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:19,862
Well...

423
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:32,041
<i>Vote, vote</i>

424
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:35,127
<i>For Hwang Byungchul the lawful president</i>

425
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,714
How unnecessary.

426
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,092
I apologize

427
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:43,928
for not telling you in advance.

428
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:46,304
Byungchul!

429
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:48,975
Come say hello to him.

430
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:06,242
How have you been, Mr. Chairman?

431
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:22,173
Does it hurt?

432
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:26,887
No, it's all right.

433
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:29,223
Sit comfortably.

434
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:32,351
Oh, sure. Well, then...

435
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:43,237
Seeing you reminds me of the past.

436
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,698
There was a dog I used to adore
when I was younger.

437
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:49,285
You're just like that dog.

438
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,164
Oh, really?

439
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:57,084
Wow, that's an honor. It was meant to be.

440
00:38:57,752 --> 00:39:01,964
It must've had quite the pedigree.

441
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:03,799
No, it was just a mutt.

442
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,426
Pardon?

443
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,640
Mutts are adorable.

444
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,476
They're smart too.

445
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,895
Here's what I think.

446
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,897
Dogs are family.

447
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,982
They eat and live with you.

448
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:23,944
Think about how people have raised dogs.

449
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:25,654
The dogs are fed

450
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:28,574
the owner's leftovers.

451
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:31,702
Yes, right. Of course.

452
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:35,164
But my dog was special because

453
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,709
he refused to eat unless I fed him.

454
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:44,715
So naturally,
I couldn't help but adore him.

455
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:46,300
Mr. Eun.

456
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,347
- Have it.
- Thank you, sir.

457
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,059
Mr. Hwang.

458
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,644
Yes, sir.

459
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:20,376
Thank you.

460
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:40,062
Make sure to behave
when you take the presidency.

461
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:44,150
And please take great care
of my son-in-law, Mr. Kwon.

462
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:47,193
Of course.

463
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,947
I'll serve him with my utmost.

464
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,123
Mr. Hwang,

465
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:02,585
I'm going to give you a gift.

466
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,169
A gift?

467
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:06,464
No, thank you. It's all right.

468
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:07,715
Don't refuse.

469
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:10,634
I've given it to every one of my people.

470
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,928
If that's the case...

471
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,556
I'll gratefully receive it.

472
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:17,183
I need a name from you.

473
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:18,809
A name?

474
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,561
You know,

475
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,856
the name of the person
you wish would disappear.

476
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:27,442
Pardon?

477
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:29,487
Whom should I kill for you?

478
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:39,622
Hello, sir.

479
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,958
Have you eaten?

480
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,793
- Gosh.
- Is he out of his mind?

481
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:46,587
How dare he skip work without notice?

482
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:50,382
- Darn... Is he trying to sock it to me?
- No, wait.

483
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:53,469
I know he's protesting
because I tried to dump

484
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:55,846
- the Kangchun case trial on him.
- Absolutely not.

485
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:58,766
Sir, look. I glued it back together.

486
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:02,102
Song Suhyeon rejected that case,

487
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:04,313
and I ended up getting told off.

488
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:07,316
The deputy head humiliated me
for not keeping my juniors under control.

489
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:09,235
How dare he skip work.

490
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:10,402
And two days at that!

491
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:12,404
Tell me about it. Not even a day, but two.

492
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:15,950
I wonder if he's sick
or if something happened to him.

493
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:18,035
Look at you.

494
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:20,829
I'll go get him right away.

495
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:23,207
Mr. Gong.

496
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,085
Tell Prosecutor Song.

497
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:27,753
The Kangchun case

498
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:30,381
was passed on to Prosecutor Han
a long time ago,

499
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:32,591
so he needs to come to work.

500
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:36,720
If he's absent again tomorrow,
I will just...

501
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:38,722
Darn it.

502
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,435
Are you leaving, sir?

503
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:47,147
- Goodbye.
- Move!

504
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:52,278
He's like a lunatic.

505
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:57,157
Goodness gracious.

506
00:42:58,117 --> 00:42:59,201
Mr. Gong, it's me.

507
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:00,953
<i>Where are you, Prosecutor Song?</i>

508
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:04,582
If you weren't going to come in,
you should've at least let me know.

509
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:06,292
<i>How could you keep me waiting?</i>

510
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:08,252
<i>I wondered what happened to you.</i>

511
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:10,462
<i>I couldn't even sleep all night!</i>

512
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:11,880
Mr. Gong.

513
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:12,965
Yes?

514
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:17,136
Investigation records? Lee Changwoo?

515
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:20,180
You know, right?
The culprit of my father's case.

516
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:22,641
Why do you ask all of a sudden...

517
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,852
Secure all the materials of that case.

518
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:28,939
Please hurry.
The retention period might expire soon.

519
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:31,275
I'll call you again later.

520
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:45,956
NEW FUTURE PARTY
HWANG BYUNGCHUL

521
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:02,806
Kim Seohee.

522
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:16,195
Song Suhyeon is there too.

523
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:24,078
<i>Where did you go without telling me?</i>

524
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:26,580
Why? Did you think I ran away alone?

525
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:29,667
How funny. Is that a joke?

526
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,543
I went to call Mr. Gong.

527
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:33,170
In case the phone here was tapped.

528
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:34,880
Why did you call him?

529
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:38,175
I'm going to check the past case records.

530
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:42,554
The past records might hold a clue.
Or there could be something I missed.

531
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:47,142
Look, I'm guessing...

532
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:51,605
that Lee Changwoo stole the Adamas.

533
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,148
I thought the same.

534
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:54,817
The notorious thief, Lee Changwoo.

535
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,236
He was once known
for stealing from the powerful.

536
00:44:57,319 --> 00:45:00,447
Right? Otherwise, why would he
be involved with Chairman Kwon?

537
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:01,931
There's no connection between them.

538
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:03,450
It's plausible enough.

539
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:07,329
Lee Changwoo stole the Adamas,

540
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:09,456
and while Haesong
was trying to retrieve it,

541
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,667
my father got killed by mistake.

542
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:15,921
Ten days before the incident,

543
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:18,590
<i>Lee Changwoo moved into that house.</i>

544
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:20,259
- No.
- Gosh, leave it be.

545
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:23,387
- I'll carry the rest.
<i>- My father was the mover.</i>

546
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:25,222
Goodness.

547
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:27,433
- It's fine.
<i>- According to the landlady,</i>

548
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:30,269
<i>Lee Changwoo didn't know
he had to pay the monthly rent in advance.</i>

549
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:33,439
<i>He rushed to pay up on moving day</i>

550
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:35,482
<i>and he didn't have enough left
for the moving fee.</i>

551
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:38,444
A hundred thousand won.

552
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:42,614
<i>My father went to demand that money</i>

553
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,659
<i>and ended up getting killed.</i>

554
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:48,787
I can't be sure about the details though.

555
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:50,706
Prosecutor Song.

556
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:55,669
Chairman Kwon probably doesn't know
about your relationship with Mr. Ha.

557
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:58,922
That must be why he hired Mr. Ha
as his ghostwriter.

558
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:00,632
He's safe for now.

559
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:02,009
I know.

560
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:06,972
Had he sensed a problem,
he wouldn't have let him into the house.

561
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:09,475
Then what's with the face?

562
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:12,811
I can't stop thinking
that Woosin isn't himself.

563
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:14,980
He always weighs the losses and gains

564
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:17,566
to make the least risky decision.

565
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:21,945
I just don't understand why
he's recklessly giving his all this time.

566
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,032
Why?

567
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:29,703
Is it what you mentioned last time?
Because he wasn't your biological father?

568
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:31,705
No, not that.

569
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:35,709
It'd be hard to understand
even if he was our real father.

570
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:38,670
Could stealing the Adamas be
an easy way to get Chairman Kwon?

571
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:42,216
Besides, the man you saw.

572
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:46,261
Right. If that man is the real culprit,

573
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:48,055
Chairman Kwon isn't.

574
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:49,640
Woosin must know that.

575
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:52,643
So why is he still in that house?

576
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:54,895
Why is he so hung up on this case?

577
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:58,440
As far as I know,
he isn't an emotional guy.

578
00:46:58,524 --> 00:46:59,775
This time, why...

579
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:04,321
Maybe he feels the same as you do.

580
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:07,407
He's serious about this case.

581
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:11,745
Whether Chairman Kwon is culprit or not,
whoever the culprit may be...

582
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:15,582
he wants to catch them no matter what.

583
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:19,878
I...

584
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:24,341
I'm indebted to our father.

585
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:44,361
Dad?

586
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:46,947
Awesome!

587
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:57,082
Is your dad home?

588
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:58,709
Mom, check this out.

589
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:01,086
Gosh. What is this, Suhyeon?

590
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:03,839
My Children's Day gift from Dad.

591
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,384
Silly him.

592
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:09,302
Where is he?

593
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:13,223
I don't know.
I just found this on the floor.

594
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:16,935
Did he go somewhere?

595
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:19,104
I bet he went to work.

596
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:23,817
How else do you think
he got that expensive toy?

597
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:26,069
We're not well off.

598
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:30,240
He's out working as a chauffeur.

599
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:34,161
Song Suhyeon, you're not a kid anymore.

600
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:36,538
- No, I...
- When will you grow up?

601
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:38,290
Woosin.

602
00:48:44,379 --> 00:48:45,505
It's okay, Suhyeon.

603
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:48,884
Woosin's just worried about your dad.

604
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:50,427
Go to bed now.

605
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:51,637
No, Mom.

606
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,347
Woosin's right.

607
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,140
I'm going to wait for Dad.

608
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:57,809
I want to apologize to him.

609
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:20,999
Honey!

610
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:35,180
- Honey!
- Dad...

611
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:44,855
Mom, why are you crying?

612
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:48,235
- Honey...
- Dad...

613
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:51,071
Honey...

614
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:54,491
What happened?

615
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,828
<i>That night, our father didn't come back.</i>

616
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:00,622
<i>For 100,000 won.</i>

617
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:05,544
<i>He went to get that unpaid money and...</i>

618
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:10,841
It's obvious why he needed the money.

619
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:14,553
If he just hadn't gone
to get that money...

620
00:50:18,223 --> 00:50:22,519
If I hadn't asked him
to buy that action figure,

621
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:25,272
he'd probably be...

622
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:29,067
So,

623
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:31,653
do you blame yourself?

624
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:39,369
Prosecutor Song,

625
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:44,583
do you remember what you said

626
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:50,005
when I blamed myself
for my parents' death?

627
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:57,220
Don't feel guilty.

628
00:50:58,096 --> 00:51:00,766
Why should victims suffer in pain

629
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:04,269
when those guilty are doing just fine?

630
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:07,439
You are innocent.

631
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:11,151
Let me tell you exactly the same.

632
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:14,029
So let us

633
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:17,240
stop feeling guilty,

634
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:19,409
stay strong,

635
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:21,661
and not give up.

636
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:27,000
We will catch them,

637
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:29,836
no matter what.

638
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:35,258
I have something to tell you.

639
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:41,515
Team A.

640
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:54,528
Song Suhyeon.

641
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:04,287
Mr. Lee.

642
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:10,252
We cremated your brother's body,
by the book.

643
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:13,046
Well done.

644
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:16,925
Did you look
into Song Suhyeon's twin brother?

645
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:19,052
Yes, we got right to it.

646
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,513
But there's no trace of him.

647
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:25,976
What do you mean?
He lives with Song Suhyeon.

648
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:29,312
He did until recently,
but he disappeared soon after.

649
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:32,899
These guys are ridiculous.

650
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,361
What's his name again?

651
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:37,904
Song Woosin.

652
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:40,323
He's a mystery writer
who goes by the pen name Ha Woosin.

653
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:42,409
He's quite well-known.

654
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:43,702
Ha Woosin.

655
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,289
I guess he got it from his mom's surname.

656
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:48,873
Ha Youngsin.

657
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:51,459
You see, she died not long ago.

658
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:54,743
So we'd skipped looking into the parents,
but this time, we discovered something.

659
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:56,715
Look here.

660
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:58,175
FEBRUARY 2, 1986

661
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,845
AUGUST 23, 1990

662
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:04,181
It seems
Song Soonho isn't their real father.

663
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:05,264
What?

664
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:07,475
Not their real father?

665
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:14,733
Then why are these bastards
making such a fuss?

666
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:16,741
Apparently,
Song Soonho was very good to them.

667
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:19,196
Not even those around them
knew they weren't blood-related.

668
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:35,170
Sir, about Sun...

669
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:38,673
I gave him the order, but I don't think
he should mark Song Suhyeon.

670
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:40,467
He's uncontrollable.

671
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,719
He doesn't listen to me
and often goes off the rails...

672
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:44,137
He's in this game.

673
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,932
- Pardon?
- This writer.

674
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:49,100
He disappeared around the time

675
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:51,304
Song Suhyeon started
digging into their father's case.

676
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:53,521
I'm sure there's something.

677
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:57,192
The SIH is behind them.

678
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:01,321
The SIH...

679
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:08,245
- Mr. Jeong.
- Yes, sir.

680
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:13,625
Gosh, I'm so full.

681
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:17,462
Still, some things should not be skipped.

682
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:20,340
But why would he get involved himself?

683
00:54:20,465 --> 00:54:21,665
He has his prosecutor brother.

684
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:26,179
The Adamas or whatever. I don't care.

685
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:27,703
It's not like he's going to sell it.

686
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:36,189
Wait. If it turns out that it wasn't used
for the murder, can we sell it?

687
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:47,242
Ms. Oh? Couldn't you have knocked?

688
00:54:51,204 --> 00:54:55,542
Oh, this is...
The chairman gave it to Mr. Ha.

689
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:57,877
And Mr. Ha said I could have it.

690
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,838
It's true. I heard it's good for joints.

691
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:00,964
Where's Mr. Ha?

692
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:03,173
What?

693
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:05,176
He's probably in the study.

694
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,434
What's with that lady? How annoying.

695
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:24,696
<i>There are times when it lands
on the station to recharge its battery.</i>

696
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,825
<i>At nine and three. Twice each
in the morning and afternoon.</i>

697
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:32,912
<i>Once it's fully recharged, it operates
automatically again for six hours.</i>

698
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:34,816
<i>A full charge takes five minutes.</i>

699
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:38,585
<i>The surveillance system
shuts down at 55 minutes.</i>

700
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:40,211
<i>So you have until three o'clock.</i>

701
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:49,596
- Mr. Lee.
- Yes?

702
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,265
- Go buy me a pack of cigarettes.
- Yes, sir.

703
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:54,224
You know what I smoke?

704
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:56,644
Yes, sir. I do.

705
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:43,942
JANG YOUNGJA

706
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:45,819
Patti Jang?

707
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:56,162
Welcome.

708
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,872
It's been a while, Ms. Jang.

709
00:56:57,956 --> 00:57:01,626
Yes, it's the first time since you placed
the order for your wedding rings.

710
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:03,211
Mr. Kwon visited from time to time.

711
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:05,588
He cares a lot about his mistress.

712
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:10,969
How may I help you today?

713
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:13,596
We'll be celebrating
the company's 80th anniversary soon.

714
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,223
For the jewelry I'll wear that day.

715
00:57:15,306 --> 00:57:17,016
Oh, right.

716
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,893
Ms. Kwon told me.

717
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:21,396
Your husband is to be inaugurated
as the new chairman.

718
00:57:21,729 --> 00:57:22,897
Congratulations.

719
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:25,984
- Can you show me some options?
- Of course.

720
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:32,657
This way.

721
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:37,036
Thank you.

722
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:45,628
You must be busy with the Adamas.

723
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:50,049
Not at all. I just strive to do my best.

724
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:54,387
You're famous for your resetting skills.

725
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:57,348
I have to start from the design,

726
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:59,476
so I'm brainstorming
in many different ways.

727
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:02,645
Since it's not any ordinary diamond.

728
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:05,273
Then is the Adamas here?

729
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:09,861
No, Haesong moved it.

730
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:11,696
Didn't you know?

731
00:58:12,363 --> 00:58:14,949
I heard it's being stored
somewhere in secret.

732
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:18,328
I'll probably be sent there in secret too.

733
00:58:20,371 --> 00:58:22,749
I hardly get involved
in the company's affairs.

734
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:25,418
I like this one.

735
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:27,295
Indeed.

736
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:30,006
That piece was made
with Canadian diamonds.

737
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:32,634
It has been the center of attention
this season.

738
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:50,063
What is this place?

739
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:20,051
Ms. Kwon's room?

740
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:31,020
RAT CATCH

741
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:32,355
Rat poison.

742
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:08,099
Is he her son?

743
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:34,083
High school days...

744
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:40,631
The year 2012?

745
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:23,424
Why is he in Ms. Kwon's room?

746
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:26,093
Why isn't he coming out of there?

747
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:29,197
Mr. Ha?

748
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:34,912
I'm here to interview the chairman.

749
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:37,707
I forgot that he's away.

750
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:40,585
What are you doing here?

751
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:44,922
Oh, Ms. Oh wanted to see me.

752
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:47,133
Ms. Oh?

753
01:04:49,468 --> 01:04:51,137
You two are already here.

754
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:54,390
Mr. Ha, you weren't
in your room or the study.

755
01:04:54,473 --> 01:04:56,350
So I wondered where you were.

756
01:04:57,101 --> 01:04:58,686
Did you tell him, Mr. Kim?

757
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,063
Well...

758
01:05:06,527 --> 01:05:08,696
Yes, I escorted him here.

759
01:05:08,779 --> 01:05:10,406
Mm. Good job.

760
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:14,577
Why did you want to see me, Ms. Oh?

761
01:05:23,669 --> 01:05:26,631
Mr. Ha, Mr. Kim,

762
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:29,592
and Ms. Oh.

763
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:35,556
Take a seat.

764
01:05:40,686 --> 01:05:42,980
What's there to talk about
in the chairman's office?

765
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:46,192
We'll be in trouble
if the chairman finds out.

766
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:51,113
If you're well aware of it,
why did you do that?

767
01:05:56,911 --> 01:05:58,412
What were you doing here

768
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:01,457
at 10 p.m. yesterday?

769
01:06:11,592 --> 01:06:13,886
Hey, Mr. Jeong. How did it go?

770
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:18,933
<i>Yes, Mr. Lee.</i>

771
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:21,936
I've secured
the Lee Changwoo case materials.

772
01:06:23,688 --> 01:06:25,690
LEE CHANGWOO MURDER CASE

773
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:33,239
What... Are these it?

774
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:35,741
SINCHON COLLEGE GIRL MURDER CASE

775
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:40,496
Where did it go?

776
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:44,041
Yes, good job. See you at the office.

777
01:06:48,129 --> 01:06:50,131
NEW EDITION / PRICE 16,000 WON

778
01:06:50,214 --> 01:06:52,216
PERSONA NON GRATA
WRITER HA WOOSIN

779
01:06:53,926 --> 01:06:55,219
<i>Team A?</i>

780
01:06:55,302 --> 01:06:57,263
They're the ones who raided the SIH.

781
01:06:57,346 --> 01:07:00,558
I'm sure Mr. Kang called them that...
Team A.

782
01:07:00,641 --> 01:07:04,311
So the SIH knew who they were.

783
01:07:04,395 --> 01:07:05,521
I think so.

784
01:07:06,105 --> 01:07:08,291
They might not have been sure
the man from the composite

785
01:07:08,315 --> 01:07:09,775
was part of that team, though.

786
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:11,110
Find Mr. Lee.

787
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:12,403
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

788
01:07:15,114 --> 01:07:17,074
The others called them sir. I think he's...

789
01:07:17,158 --> 01:07:18,284
The leader.

790
01:07:22,955 --> 01:07:23,955
Who is it?

791
01:07:24,832 --> 01:07:26,083
I'm not expecting anyone.

792
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:48,022
What do we do?

793
01:08:16,425 --> 01:08:17,425
<i>It's a bribe.</i>

794
01:08:17,468 --> 01:08:19,762
Are you trying to buy me off with this?

795
01:08:19,845 --> 01:08:22,681
I know what I saw.
They called him their leader.

796
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:23,891
<i>Dispose of the rest.</i>

797
01:08:23,974 --> 01:08:26,602
The father couldn't
differentiate the twins?

798
01:08:26,685 --> 01:08:29,271
<i>I think Ms. Kwon's late son
is her weakness.</i>

799
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:32,608
<i>The reason why Ms. Yoon
recommended you. To steal my husband.</i>

800
01:08:32,691 --> 01:08:34,527
<i>And you know who the targets are?</i>

801
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:35,486
<i>Kill them no matter what.</i>

802
01:08:35,569 --> 01:08:36,487
<i>Hi, Prosecutor Song.</i>

803
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:38,155
<i>I've read all your books.</i>

804
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:40,199
<i>I'm not Kwon Minjo.</i>

805
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:41,575
<i>I can't be his substitute.</i>

806
01:08:42,159 --> 01:08:43,744
<i>Aren't we after the same thing?</i>
