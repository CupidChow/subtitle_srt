1
00:00:46,008 --> 00:00:48,428
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:48,508 --> 00:00:50,928
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:15,618 --> 00:01:16,938
He's getting rid of the evidence.

4
00:01:43,318 --> 00:01:44,358
Gosh, that wakes me up.

5
00:01:45,028 --> 00:01:46,898
Wait, the chairman's office?

6
00:01:47,818 --> 00:01:49,158
But the chairman's not here.

7
00:01:49,238 --> 00:01:50,778
Oh, it's...

8
00:01:51,818 --> 00:01:52,908
It's Ms. Oh.

9
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:58,328
Jeez, I told her to be right on time
at ten, but she's late again.

10
00:01:58,408 --> 00:02:00,578
Hey.

11
00:02:02,338 --> 00:02:03,588
Let me take a ten-minute break.

12
00:02:04,798 --> 00:02:06,208
Sure, go ahead.

13
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:39,908
It's not there?

14
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:42,578
The Adamas is gone?

15
00:02:44,418 --> 00:02:45,838
Then where could it be?

16
00:02:46,498 --> 00:02:49,628
Ms. Kwon. I think she took it with her.

17
00:02:49,718 --> 00:02:51,088
So you're saying...

18
00:02:52,928 --> 00:02:54,258
This is driving me nuts.

19
00:02:56,008 --> 00:02:58,308
Okay, then we're on standby.

20
00:02:59,058 --> 00:03:01,808
Headquarters might be able
to get some info for us. Let's wait.

21
00:03:02,228 --> 00:03:04,978
Apparently, they've caught a big fish.

22
00:03:05,478 --> 00:03:07,068
Hey, don't do it.

23
00:03:45,018 --> 00:03:46,018
Sir.

24
00:03:46,978 --> 00:03:48,018
I'm not sure about this.

25
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,889
Maybe I should've done it instead.
What if he really dies?

26
00:03:56,698 --> 00:03:58,238
What do you mean?

27
00:03:58,828 --> 00:04:00,658
Isn't that just an anesthetic?

28
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:10,418
What have you done?

29
00:04:11,628 --> 00:04:13,758
Do you think he could fool him
with a fake?

30
00:04:16,758 --> 00:04:19,508
Are you telling me that
it really is a muscle relaxant?

31
00:04:19,598 --> 00:04:21,518
Even truth serum didn't work on him.

32
00:04:21,598 --> 00:04:24,438
- He needs to experience near-death...
- Are you insane?

33
00:04:25,018 --> 00:04:27,518
Prosecutor Song isn't aware of this.

34
00:04:27,808 --> 00:04:28,938
Darn...

35
00:04:33,778 --> 00:04:36,108
It will paralyze his respiratory muscles
only for a moment.

36
00:04:36,198 --> 00:04:37,964
If it goes south,
I'll take responsibility.

37
00:04:37,988 --> 00:04:39,238
Responsibility?

38
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:42,578
What, do you have a knack
for bringing the dead back to life?

39
00:04:43,118 --> 00:04:44,908
I thought you were just,
so how could you...

40
00:04:44,998 --> 00:04:47,328
Go talk about justice somewhere else!
This isn't it!

41
00:04:47,418 --> 00:04:49,338
Yes, that's exactly what I'm going to do.

42
00:04:49,418 --> 00:04:50,748
You lunatics.

43
00:04:58,638 --> 00:04:59,718
Ms. Kim.

44
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,008
- Let go!
- Ms. Kim.

45
00:05:04,058 --> 00:05:05,058
Let go of me.

46
00:05:08,938 --> 00:05:10,228
Calm down.

47
00:05:20,948 --> 00:05:23,538
Justice? What do you think that is?

48
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:26,038
Showing mercy even to murderers?

49
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:29,128
Whatever you say
can't justify this situation.

50
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,288
Even if he's the scumbag
who killed your parents?

51
00:05:33,088 --> 00:05:36,378
You can't let him die
when you let your parents die?

52
00:05:37,048 --> 00:05:39,928
My justice
is to be the lesser evil if I must.

53
00:05:40,508 --> 00:05:41,758
To defeat the worst.

54
00:05:42,888 --> 00:05:46,018
You blame us
because we're doing what you can't do.

55
00:05:46,598 --> 00:05:47,728
Is that your justice?

56
00:05:50,648 --> 00:05:51,938
That's too easy, isn't it?

57
00:05:57,358 --> 00:05:58,778
Just go take a walk.

58
00:06:00,238 --> 00:06:01,658
Leave this up to us.

59
00:06:18,418 --> 00:06:20,838
<i>Even if he's the scumbag
who killed your parents?</i>

60
00:06:29,478 --> 00:06:31,398
They captured who?

61
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:34,858
The punk who tailed Prosecutor Song.
He tried to hurt the female reporter too.

62
00:06:35,108 --> 00:06:36,228
He's being interrogated now.

63
00:06:37,738 --> 00:06:38,738
Mr. Choi.

64
00:06:41,448 --> 00:06:42,738
Something doesn't feel right.

65
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:44,328
What do you mean?

66
00:06:44,908 --> 00:06:46,288
They captured him?

67
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,498
Captured...

68
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:54,878
I planted a GPS biochip in my left hand.

69
00:06:55,378 --> 00:06:58,758
<i>In case something happens to me
while trying to steal the Adamas.</i>

70
00:06:59,128 --> 00:07:01,588
<i>Worst case, I wanted
my dead body to be found</i>

71
00:07:01,678 --> 00:07:03,338
<i>so that Chairman Kwon could be arrested.</i>

72
00:07:04,678 --> 00:07:07,768
But the guy being held captive
isn't the man in the composite.

73
00:07:07,848 --> 00:07:10,138
And his age doesn't match
the case from 22 years ago.

74
00:07:10,808 --> 00:07:12,598
I don't know
how he's related to the culprit,

75
00:07:12,688 --> 00:07:14,688
but he must have a connection
to the chairman.

76
00:07:14,938 --> 00:07:16,148
Do you think such a guy

77
00:07:17,278 --> 00:07:20,238
would move around
without any protective means?

78
00:07:27,368 --> 00:07:28,368
Hey.

79
00:07:30,078 --> 00:07:31,078
Hey.

80
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:33,868
What's wrong with you?

81
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,418
Hey!

82
00:08:04,158 --> 00:08:05,448
The SIH is in danger.

83
00:08:07,408 --> 00:08:08,408
Hey!

84
00:08:25,178 --> 00:08:27,178
We got a signal 200 meters ahead.

85
00:08:27,678 --> 00:08:30,558
The four of you, go this way.
The rest will go around through the woods.

86
00:08:30,808 --> 00:08:32,348
- Let's hurry.
- Don't we need masks?

87
00:08:32,928 --> 00:08:33,928
No.

88
00:08:55,748 --> 00:08:58,128
Even if he's the scumbag
who killed your parents?

89
00:08:59,878 --> 00:09:01,088
This isn't right.

90
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:05,588
This is wrong.
I have to let Song Suhyeon know.

91
00:09:12,308 --> 00:09:13,308
What was that?

92
00:09:59,648 --> 00:10:00,688
Are you kidding me?

93
00:10:01,358 --> 00:10:02,728
If he dies, it's murder!

94
00:10:03,318 --> 00:10:05,648
We can't afford to be picky here.
What a gentleman.

95
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:07,698
Is this how the SIH works?
Dirtying their hands?

96
00:10:07,778 --> 00:10:10,608
If you're unhappy with what we do,
get off our ship. I'm the captain.

97
00:10:10,698 --> 00:10:14,288
Sure, captain. Just give me
the damn antidote. Bastard!

98
00:10:16,828 --> 00:10:18,458
Mr. Kang, we have a Code Gray situation.

99
00:10:18,538 --> 00:10:19,918
Where?

100
00:10:19,998 --> 00:10:21,328
The vigilance team radioed us.

101
00:10:24,338 --> 00:10:25,338
Code Gray?

102
00:10:25,418 --> 00:10:26,668
Security risks have appeared.

103
00:10:38,268 --> 00:10:39,388
Kim Seohee?

104
00:10:41,728 --> 00:10:43,768
Four men, all armed with guns.

105
00:10:44,438 --> 00:10:46,914
- Communication's been cut off.
- And the other teams?

106
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:48,688
I think Bravo and Charlie are down too.

107
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:51,778
We can't confirm
how many attacked those teams.

108
00:11:02,498 --> 00:11:04,958
They aren't wearing masks.

109
00:11:11,218 --> 00:11:12,468
They plan to kill us all.

110
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,288
Darn it, why is it so slow?

111
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:45,878
They destroyed the mobile base station
and attacked the vigilance team first.

112
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:46,958
Armed with guns?

113
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,378
- Sir.
- Damn it, it's Team A.

114
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:51,588
Team A?

115
00:11:51,668 --> 00:11:53,178
Let's pull out. Issue a Code Black.

116
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,088
Code Black.

117
00:12:04,938 --> 00:12:06,268
Please...

118
00:12:10,568 --> 00:12:13,148
Ms. Kim. Where's Ms. Kim?

119
00:12:13,238 --> 00:12:14,148
It's too late.

120
00:12:14,238 --> 00:12:16,488
They came from the direction
Ms. Kim was headed.

121
00:12:16,908 --> 00:12:19,158
- Prosecutor Song!
- Prosecutor Song!

122
00:12:19,578 --> 00:12:20,618
Darn it.

123
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,198
Let's go.

124
00:13:03,698 --> 00:13:05,248
No one's at the backup point.

125
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:07,578
Gosh, they ran off.

126
00:13:07,668 --> 00:13:09,458
Should we keep him alive to get some info?

127
00:13:11,088 --> 00:13:12,378
No, we've already got a girl.

128
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,468
Find Mr. Lee.

129
00:13:23,558 --> 00:13:24,768
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

130
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,118
What is it?

131
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:31,248
Is it too bright?

132
00:14:38,838 --> 00:14:40,428
Why did they have to make me watch her?

133
00:14:41,138 --> 00:14:43,058
While they're having all the fun.

134
00:14:44,678 --> 00:14:46,768
I thought I'd work up a sweat
for a change.

135
00:14:46,848 --> 00:14:48,178
That girl totally ruined it.

136
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,288
Darn it.

137
00:15:27,058 --> 00:15:29,768
Prosecutor Song.

138
00:15:29,848 --> 00:15:31,018
I almost couldn't find you.

139
00:15:38,818 --> 00:15:39,858
Run.

140
00:15:41,318 --> 00:15:42,608
Damn it...

141
00:16:10,888 --> 00:16:13,978
Listen carefully.
When I give you a sign, run forward.

142
00:16:14,058 --> 00:16:15,308
I'll be right behind you.

143
00:16:15,398 --> 00:16:17,478
What about you?
It'll be dangerous for you.

144
00:16:17,688 --> 00:16:19,188
Then will you run behind me?

145
00:16:19,818 --> 00:16:22,108
No time to argue.
Just run when I give you the sign.

146
00:16:24,068 --> 00:16:25,068
One.

147
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,488
Come out.

148
00:16:26,908 --> 00:16:27,778
Two.

149
00:16:27,868 --> 00:16:29,028
Aren't you going to run?

150
00:16:29,118 --> 00:16:30,118
Three.

151
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:39,708
Don't stop. Keep running.

152
00:16:59,938 --> 00:17:00,938
Joonho.

153
00:17:04,068 --> 00:17:05,238
Joonho.

154
00:17:05,318 --> 00:17:07,108
It's me. Wake up.

155
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:10,448
Joonho? Your brother's here.

156
00:17:11,408 --> 00:17:12,618
Wake up.

157
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,198
Hey.

158
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:17,078
Open your eyes.

159
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:19,038
Joonho.

160
00:17:19,918 --> 00:17:22,048
Hey, punk. Your brother's here.

161
00:17:23,128 --> 00:17:24,418
Wake up!

162
00:17:25,008 --> 00:17:26,008
Joonho!

163
00:17:27,178 --> 00:17:28,968
- Gosh.
- This.

164
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:33,848
Damn it.
Hey, take him to the hospital now.

165
00:17:33,968 --> 00:17:34,968
Yes, sir.

166
00:17:37,058 --> 00:17:39,098
Those bastards.

167
00:17:53,078 --> 00:17:55,618
Sir, take a look at this.

168
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,378
Son of a gun.

169
00:18:07,668 --> 00:18:09,928
- What's going on?
- The laptop...

170
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:13,218
Bastards. I'm going to kill them all.

171
00:18:17,728 --> 00:18:19,308
- It's a time bomb.
- So what?

172
00:18:19,388 --> 00:18:20,808
- A bomb!
- Let go!

173
00:18:20,898 --> 00:18:23,398
- We have to go!
- Get off me!

174
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:25,028
- Let go.
- Come to your senses!

175
00:18:25,148 --> 00:18:27,608
- Song Suhyeon, I'm going to kill you.
- Mr. Lee.

176
00:18:27,688 --> 00:18:29,908
You bastard.

177
00:18:29,988 --> 00:18:31,658
Song Suhyeon!

178
00:18:43,918 --> 00:18:44,918
Let's go.

179
00:19:02,898 --> 00:19:05,978
Ms. Jang? You mean that famous...

180
00:19:06,068 --> 00:19:08,818
Right, I contacted her myself.

181
00:19:12,408 --> 00:19:13,698
Because of the Adamas.

182
00:19:18,328 --> 00:19:19,578
What are you going to do?

183
00:19:24,328 --> 00:19:26,168
I'm going to bury the past.

184
00:19:34,178 --> 00:19:35,178
Sleeping?

185
00:19:38,638 --> 00:19:40,598
About that ghostwriter.

186
00:19:41,478 --> 00:19:44,188
My father is quite fond of him.

187
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:46,768
What's your take?

188
00:19:48,358 --> 00:19:49,988
There must be a reason.

189
00:19:51,528 --> 00:19:54,528
I'm not sure. I'm not really interested.

190
00:19:58,118 --> 00:19:59,578
I'm a bit curious.

191
00:20:04,418 --> 00:20:05,668
<i>You can't reach them?</i>

192
00:20:05,748 --> 00:20:07,248
I think they were raided.

193
00:20:09,838 --> 00:20:12,628
There's no time to waste, Mr. Ha.
We must get out of here now.

194
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:14,848
I'm telling you,
there's no time to hesitate.

195
00:20:16,008 --> 00:20:17,468
Where did they move the Adamas to?

196
00:20:17,548 --> 00:20:18,888
In this situation?

197
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,848
No, why? For what reason?

198
00:20:21,978 --> 00:20:24,478
I'm sure there's a reason.
I must figure it out.

199
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:27,018
So, you will stay here in this house?

200
00:20:27,398 --> 00:20:28,518
Should I leave empty-handed?

201
00:20:28,568 --> 00:20:30,818
Are you insane? They got to the SIH.

202
00:20:31,228 --> 00:20:32,648
They'll find us out in no time.

203
00:20:32,738 --> 00:20:34,108
So, will you leave?

204
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:38,488
Neither can I.

205
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,788
You know we're in a dangerous situation.

206
00:20:47,878 --> 00:20:49,538
We can't be sure how things are outside.

207
00:20:49,628 --> 00:20:51,458
It'd be reckless to just leave.

208
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:56,048
Let's try to hold out
until we get back in touch with the SIH.

209
00:21:01,968 --> 00:21:03,308
Will you be okay?

210
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:07,978
I'm talking about Prosecutor Song.

211
00:21:10,188 --> 00:21:11,388
You must be worried about him.

212
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,398
He will be fine.

213
00:21:15,778 --> 00:21:17,608
He can take care of himself.

214
00:21:23,368 --> 00:21:24,748
- Thank you.
- No problem.

215
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:28,208
HOMESTEAD GRAPES AND APPLES

216
00:21:29,078 --> 00:21:30,338
It's Woosin's place.

217
00:21:51,108 --> 00:21:53,148
Face recognition?

218
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:54,728
That's high-tech.

219
00:21:55,358 --> 00:21:56,858
He's very particular, you see.

220
00:21:56,948 --> 00:22:00,318
Still, you two must be quite close.
Your face is in the system.

221
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:03,368
Well, we kept in touch.

222
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:04,948
Let's go inside.

223
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:11,538
This place is under the publisher's name,
so I think it'd be safer than home.

224
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:16,668
Shouldn't we go
to the head office of the SIH?

225
00:22:19,258 --> 00:22:21,048
The infiltration team
doesn't exist on paper,

226
00:22:21,138 --> 00:22:22,498
so we can't get their help anyway.

227
00:22:23,048 --> 00:22:25,268
Let's rest here for now.

228
00:22:29,308 --> 00:22:30,348
My.

229
00:22:32,228 --> 00:22:33,728
Wow.

230
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:38,238
Your brother must love himself dearly.

231
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:41,108
Well, he's a weirdo.

232
00:22:46,158 --> 00:22:48,708
The bathroom is that way. Go straight.

233
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:50,498
Okay.

234
00:23:07,768 --> 00:23:09,228
He passed away.

235
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:14,648
I tried my best to save him,
but when he got here, he was already...

236
00:23:14,808 --> 00:23:15,818
Get out.

237
00:23:31,918 --> 00:23:33,078
Rest in peace.

238
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:35,838
I will...

239
00:23:38,128 --> 00:23:39,338
I will make sure...

240
00:23:45,428 --> 00:23:47,218
I don't know what to say.

241
00:23:47,428 --> 00:23:49,138
Song Suhyeon has a brother, right?

242
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,478
Yes, a twin brother.

243
00:23:51,558 --> 00:23:52,808
Get him.

244
00:23:56,608 --> 00:23:58,148
I must return the favor.

245
00:24:00,568 --> 00:24:01,818
Yes, sir.

246
00:24:13,538 --> 00:24:15,958
Idiot.

247
00:24:24,008 --> 00:24:25,388
I'm sorry, sir.

248
00:24:33,888 --> 00:24:35,148
You lost Kim Seohee?

249
00:24:35,228 --> 00:24:37,398
There was a sudden attack from behind...

250
00:24:40,068 --> 00:24:43,528
You little punk.
Is that all you have to say?

251
00:24:47,948 --> 00:24:49,198
Sir.

252
00:25:05,678 --> 00:25:08,968
Trace Song Suhyeon's every move
and locate him.

253
00:25:10,468 --> 00:25:11,468
Yes, sir.

254
00:25:15,058 --> 00:25:16,188
And

255
00:25:16,768 --> 00:25:18,018
call Sun.

256
00:25:24,068 --> 00:25:25,148
What is this?

257
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:38,498
Don't be intimidated, Kim Seohee.

258
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:43,878
- Yes?
- I put some clothes outside the door.

259
00:25:44,378 --> 00:25:45,418
Okay.

260
00:25:45,968 --> 00:25:48,678
<i>A fire broke out
at a privately owned cabin,</i>

261
00:25:48,758 --> 00:25:51,388
<i>causing the death of five members
of a mountain cycling club.</i>

262
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:53,808
- Prosecutor Song.
- Ms. Kim.

263
00:25:53,888 --> 00:25:56,388
<i>This was once a cabin
in Cheongpa-gun, Ganggyeong-do.</i>

264
00:25:56,478 --> 00:26:00,268
<i>It was burned down due to the fire
and now its structure hardly remains.</i>

265
00:26:00,688 --> 00:26:03,398
<i>The fire department in Cheongpa
presumes that the fire was caused</i>

266
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:05,488
<i>by a liquefied petroleum gas explosion.</i>

267
00:26:05,988 --> 00:26:08,318
<i>It is highly probable
that leftover gas leaked</i>

268
00:26:08,408 --> 00:26:10,198
<i>from an abandoned gas pipe
behind the cabin,</i>

269
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:13,118
<i>resulting in this gas explosion.</i>

270
00:26:13,328 --> 00:26:15,828
<i>Due to this accident,
31-year-old Kim and four others</i>

271
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:19,038
<i>were taken to a nearby hospital,
but they ended up passing away.</i>

272
00:26:24,588 --> 00:26:27,668
We confirmed they're alive through CCTV
footage from a training center nearby,

273
00:26:27,718 --> 00:26:30,718
and currently analyzing the footage
to figure out where they went.

274
00:26:31,428 --> 00:26:34,008
We'll hurry,
since Team A will be after them too.

275
00:26:35,178 --> 00:26:36,308
I bet they will.

276
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:38,888
But I wonder.

277
00:26:39,768 --> 00:26:42,148
Did they survive it? Or were they spared?

278
00:26:43,648 --> 00:26:46,568
Are you suggesting
that Team A didn't kill them on purpose?

279
00:26:46,648 --> 00:26:48,948
This could be their bait to get us.

280
00:26:49,738 --> 00:26:51,868
Once you locate the two,
don't contact them but wait.

281
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:53,698
Until they make a move first.

282
00:26:54,328 --> 00:26:57,118
Yes, sir. Then what about Ha Woosin?

283
00:26:58,828 --> 00:27:02,748
Now that they know about Prosecutor Song,
Mr. Ha will inevitably be in danger.

284
00:27:03,128 --> 00:27:04,128
Should we extract him?

285
00:27:06,878 --> 00:27:09,418
Leave him be. The more decoys, the better.

286
00:27:09,508 --> 00:27:11,548
It will give us a better chance
to catch our target.

287
00:27:12,718 --> 00:27:13,888
But sir...

288
00:27:13,968 --> 00:27:15,968
Be generous with the condolence money
for our guys.

289
00:27:19,558 --> 00:27:20,848
Yes, sir.

290
00:27:33,698 --> 00:27:34,698
Lee Dongrim.

291
00:27:36,158 --> 00:27:39,198
Don't try to get friendly with me.
It's not going to work.

292
00:27:39,498 --> 00:27:40,998
Are you out to mess up my life too?

293
00:27:42,458 --> 00:27:44,748
You sound cranky,
but your face makes it obvious.

294
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:46,918
That you like me.

295
00:27:47,588 --> 00:27:49,758
Me? No.

296
00:27:49,838 --> 00:27:50,838
Yes.

297
00:27:51,048 --> 00:27:53,548
Or why did you even play
the voice recorder you stole?

298
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:55,508
You could've handed it
to Ms. Kwon right away.

299
00:27:56,428 --> 00:27:58,068
- That's...
- Before you handed it to her,

300
00:27:58,098 --> 00:28:00,678
you wanted to delete anything important.

301
00:28:03,768 --> 00:28:05,898
But it was more serious than you thought.

302
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:08,068
So you brought it back to me.

303
00:28:09,528 --> 00:28:11,318
What? So what?

304
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:13,108
Whatever I do, just feign ignorance.

305
00:28:13,198 --> 00:28:15,028
I won't cause you any harm.

306
00:28:15,108 --> 00:28:16,118
You already...

307
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:18,578
You've already caused me enough harm.

308
00:28:22,998 --> 00:28:24,278
Should I get you something more?

309
00:28:30,878 --> 00:28:32,338
How did it go?

310
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:33,878
I got in touch with them.

311
00:28:35,638 --> 00:28:36,638
How's Suhyeon?

312
00:28:37,218 --> 00:28:38,348
He's all right.

313
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:40,138
He's unharmed.

314
00:28:41,138 --> 00:28:42,178
That's good to hear.

315
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,518
Yes, it's good.

316
00:28:46,268 --> 00:28:48,358
But we still have a problem to solve.

317
00:28:48,438 --> 00:28:50,858
I have no idea why the Adamas disappeared
and where it went.

318
00:28:53,568 --> 00:28:55,778
I plan to sneak
into the chairman's office again.

319
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,408
- Again?
- I need to find the Adamas.

320
00:28:59,948 --> 00:29:01,158
And I have something to check.

321
00:29:02,288 --> 00:29:03,788
Going all out, are you?

322
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:07,038
The surveillance system
is on 24 hours a day.

323
00:29:07,128 --> 00:29:09,838
So how, in broad daylight at that?

324
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:12,048
Are you sure it's 24 hours?

325
00:29:13,628 --> 00:29:15,548
It can't be flying in the sky
all day long.

326
00:29:16,428 --> 00:29:17,468
It needs time to recharge.

327
00:29:20,388 --> 00:29:23,428
You'll sneak in when it lands to recharge?

328
00:29:23,768 --> 00:29:24,768
That'd be too short.

329
00:29:24,848 --> 00:29:26,268
Ms. Oh is coming.

330
00:29:38,988 --> 00:29:41,328
Ms. Oh.

331
00:29:42,118 --> 00:29:43,698
You should be more punctual.

332
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:45,038
What?

333
00:29:45,118 --> 00:29:47,418
You did your final check
after ten o'clock again.

334
00:29:47,498 --> 00:29:50,128
If Ms. Kwon finds out,
we're the ones who'll get in trouble.

335
00:29:51,288 --> 00:29:52,588
What are you talking about?

336
00:29:52,668 --> 00:29:55,418
Last night. Mr. Kim told me.

337
00:29:55,508 --> 00:29:58,968
Someone was in the chairman's office.
So I asked who it was,

338
00:29:59,048 --> 00:30:00,298
and he said it was you.

339
00:30:05,218 --> 00:30:06,228
Am I wrong?

340
00:30:08,268 --> 00:30:09,308
You're right.

341
00:30:09,518 --> 00:30:12,568
I loafed around a little
because Ms. Kwon isn't here. Sorry.

342
00:30:15,608 --> 00:30:17,528
Let's see...

343
00:30:22,448 --> 00:30:25,238
<i>Mr. Kim lied.</i>

344
00:30:27,208 --> 00:30:28,208
<i>Why?</i>

345
00:30:48,598 --> 00:30:51,438
- Father?
- The sun's been up for hours.

346
00:30:53,608 --> 00:30:54,978
Have you gone senile?

347
00:30:55,568 --> 00:30:58,068
You shouldn't come into my bedroom
unnoticed like this.

348
00:30:58,148 --> 00:30:59,698
Stop complaining and wake up.

349
00:30:59,778 --> 00:31:02,118
I don't want to. I'm still sleepy.

350
00:31:02,198 --> 00:31:03,528
How can you be so carefree?

351
00:31:03,618 --> 00:31:05,418
You've been married
for more than three years.

352
00:31:05,618 --> 00:31:06,938
How come you aren't pregnant yet?

353
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:10,918
What if your husband ends up
having a son out of wedlock?

354
00:31:11,918 --> 00:31:14,378
That would be great news.

355
00:31:15,668 --> 00:31:16,668
Hyesoo.

356
00:31:22,008 --> 00:31:24,758
I don't want anyone else
to live in this nightmare.

357
00:31:24,848 --> 00:31:26,308
Especially not my child.

358
00:31:26,758 --> 00:31:28,308
You won't give the Kwons an heir?

359
00:31:28,388 --> 00:31:29,428
I won't.

360
00:31:30,018 --> 00:31:32,398
I need something to live for, don't I?

361
00:31:36,768 --> 00:31:39,488
Wash up. We're having lunch
with your father-in-law.

362
00:32:03,128 --> 00:32:04,298
You look pretty.

363
00:32:06,428 --> 00:32:08,058
The bride in white.

364
00:32:09,718 --> 00:32:11,768
Minjo would've been delighted to see you.

365
00:32:13,138 --> 00:32:14,308
Ah.

366
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:17,018
He might be watching from above, right?

367
00:32:19,358 --> 00:32:21,438
This marriage is nothing
but a business transaction.

368
00:32:22,698 --> 00:32:26,568
Consider it marketing
on your father's behalf.

369
00:32:27,238 --> 00:32:28,528
Just keep your promise.

370
00:32:28,618 --> 00:32:31,198
What promise? Divorce?

371
00:32:34,418 --> 00:32:36,658
I said I'll divorce you
as soon as my father passes away.

372
00:32:37,168 --> 00:32:39,668
So use your time to pray
instead of hating me.

373
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:41,548
Pray for him to die soon.

374
00:32:41,628 --> 00:32:43,258
I still don't get it.

375
00:32:44,298 --> 00:32:45,928
Why you want to marry me.

376
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,968
Do you still not get it?

377
00:32:49,678 --> 00:32:51,928
I can't marry anyone
just because I want to.

378
00:32:52,928 --> 00:32:54,688
Not unless it's what my father wants.

379
00:32:56,478 --> 00:32:59,568
- So why would the chairman...
- This is your problem.

380
00:33:01,438 --> 00:33:03,398
You're too complicated.

381
00:33:05,398 --> 00:33:06,698
Why do you even ask?

382
00:33:07,488 --> 00:33:10,618
If I tell you, will you choose
not to walk down the aisle?

383
00:33:13,788 --> 00:33:17,128
My father has no mercy for things that
displease him, not even his children.

384
00:33:17,208 --> 00:33:18,328
So how dare you...

385
00:33:30,388 --> 00:33:31,388
Smile.

386
00:33:32,518 --> 00:33:33,518
It's a happy day.

387
00:34:20,098 --> 00:34:22,608
Anyway, just come.

388
00:34:22,938 --> 00:34:24,778
I'm telling you to come.

389
00:34:26,738 --> 00:34:28,858
Before you lose his favor even more,

390
00:34:29,158 --> 00:34:31,738
you have to keep seeing him.

391
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:33,868
Yes.

392
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,078
What's taking her so long?

393
00:34:45,878 --> 00:34:46,798
Where's Hyesoo?

394
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:48,798
She left just now.

395
00:34:49,468 --> 00:34:50,508
Why that...

396
00:34:51,088 --> 00:34:54,468
LEGALIZATION OF FIREARMS
MARKETING PROPOSAL

397
00:35:05,398 --> 00:35:06,688
This is like a disease.

398
00:35:08,318 --> 00:35:09,898
Why am I in love with you?

399
00:35:38,388 --> 00:35:41,098
Should we grab lunch? Whatever you like.

400
00:35:41,768 --> 00:35:44,228
I have to be with the chairman.

401
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:48,108
I just came to see you before I left.

402
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:51,858
I hate this.

403
00:35:53,948 --> 00:35:59,448
Let's have lunch next time.
We'll have something you like.

404
00:36:05,918 --> 00:36:07,748
My father's doing this on purpose.

405
00:36:08,338 --> 00:36:10,048
Always keeping you by his side.

406
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:11,878
It's to punish me.

407
00:36:31,278 --> 00:36:32,948
How's your hip joint?

408
00:36:33,698 --> 00:36:34,858
It's all right.

409
00:36:35,528 --> 00:36:37,488
You have to recover soon
so we can drink together.

410
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:38,828
Of course.

411
00:36:40,658 --> 00:36:41,948
How is your hospital doing?

412
00:36:42,038 --> 00:36:44,248
It's doing well, thanks to you.

413
00:36:48,538 --> 00:36:51,508
How do you like the sashimi?

414
00:36:52,548 --> 00:36:53,798
It's good.

415
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,388
It's natural saw-edged perch
from Jeju Island.

416
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,638
Are you trying to take credit?

417
00:37:04,478 --> 00:37:07,308
If I do, will you give me credit?

418
00:37:07,898 --> 00:37:11,108
This is what I like about you.

419
00:37:11,818 --> 00:37:14,238
You don't get intimidated
even when you're with me.

420
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:17,528
I guess we've done enough catching up.

421
00:37:18,568 --> 00:37:19,778
What is it you had to say?

422
00:37:20,828 --> 00:37:21,828
Well...

423
00:37:30,878 --> 00:37:34,008
<i>Vote, vote</i>

424
00:37:34,508 --> 00:37:37,088
<i>For Hwang Byungchul the lawful president</i>

425
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:40,678
How unnecessary.

426
00:37:42,058 --> 00:37:43,058
I apologize

427
00:37:43,768 --> 00:37:45,888
for not telling you in advance.

428
00:37:47,268 --> 00:37:48,268
Byungchul!

429
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,938
Come say hello to him.

430
00:38:04,578 --> 00:38:08,208
How have you been, Mr. Chairman?

431
00:38:23,138 --> 00:38:24,138
Does it hurt?

432
00:38:25,848 --> 00:38:28,848
No, it's all right.

433
00:38:29,848 --> 00:38:31,188
Sit comfortably.

434
00:38:31,268 --> 00:38:34,318
Oh, sure. Well, then...

435
00:38:43,028 --> 00:38:45,198
Seeing you reminds me of the past.

436
00:38:45,288 --> 00:38:47,658
There was a dog I used to adore
when I was younger.

437
00:38:48,788 --> 00:38:51,248
You're just like that dog.

438
00:38:53,128 --> 00:38:55,128
Oh, really?

439
00:38:55,838 --> 00:38:59,048
Wow, that's an honor. It was meant to be.

440
00:38:59,718 --> 00:39:03,928
It must've had quite the pedigree.

441
00:39:04,428 --> 00:39:05,758
No, it was just a mutt.

442
00:39:06,268 --> 00:39:07,388
Pardon?

443
00:39:11,438 --> 00:39:13,608
Mutts are adorable.

444
00:39:13,688 --> 00:39:15,438
They're smart too.

445
00:39:15,518 --> 00:39:17,858
Here's what I think.

446
00:39:18,238 --> 00:39:19,858
Dogs are family.

447
00:39:19,948 --> 00:39:21,948
They eat and live with you.

448
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:25,908
Think about how people have raised dogs.

449
00:39:26,488 --> 00:39:27,618
The dogs are fed

450
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:30,538
the owner's leftovers.

451
00:39:31,538 --> 00:39:33,668
Yes, right. Of course.

452
00:39:34,078 --> 00:39:37,128
But my dog was special because

453
00:39:38,048 --> 00:39:40,668
he refused to eat unless I fed him.

454
00:39:43,388 --> 00:39:46,678
So naturally,
I couldn't help but adore him.

455
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,268
Mr. Eun.

456
00:39:51,768 --> 00:39:53,308
- Have it.
- Thank you, sir.

457
00:39:55,688 --> 00:39:57,018
Mr. Hwang.

458
00:39:57,528 --> 00:39:58,608
Yes, sir.

459
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:22,338
Thank you.

460
00:40:39,568 --> 00:40:42,028
Make sure to behave
when you take the presidency.

461
00:40:43,068 --> 00:40:46,118
And please take great care
of my son-in-law, Mr. Kwon.

462
00:40:48,158 --> 00:40:49,158
Of course.

463
00:40:49,658 --> 00:40:51,908
I'll serve him with my utmost.

464
00:41:01,088 --> 00:41:02,088
Mr. Hwang,

465
00:41:02,718 --> 00:41:04,548
I'm going to give you a gift.

466
00:41:05,128 --> 00:41:06,128
A gift?

467
00:41:06,468 --> 00:41:08,428
No, thank you. It's all right.

468
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:09,678
Don't refuse.

469
00:41:10,138 --> 00:41:12,598
I've given it to every one of my people.

470
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,888
If that's the case...

471
00:41:16,148 --> 00:41:17,518
I'll gratefully receive it.

472
00:41:17,688 --> 00:41:19,148
I need a name from you.

473
00:41:19,688 --> 00:41:20,768
A name?

474
00:41:20,858 --> 00:41:22,528
You know,

475
00:41:23,108 --> 00:41:25,818
the name of the person
you wish would disappear.

476
00:41:28,408 --> 00:41:29,408
Pardon?

477
00:41:30,198 --> 00:41:31,448
Whom should I kill for you?

478
00:41:40,168 --> 00:41:41,588
Hello, sir.

479
00:41:42,798 --> 00:41:44,918
Have you eaten?

480
00:41:45,298 --> 00:41:46,758
- Gosh.
- Is he out of his mind?

481
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:48,548
How dare he skip work without notice?

482
00:41:49,638 --> 00:41:52,348
- Darn... Is he trying to sock it to me?
- No, wait.

483
00:41:52,428 --> 00:41:55,428
I know he's protesting
because I tried to dump

484
00:41:55,518 --> 00:41:57,808
- the Kangchun case trial on him.
- Absolutely not.

485
00:41:57,898 --> 00:42:00,728
Sir, look. I glued it back together.

486
00:42:01,768 --> 00:42:04,068
Song Suhyeon rejected that case,

487
00:42:04,148 --> 00:42:06,278
and I ended up getting told off.

488
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:09,278
The deputy head humiliated me
for not keeping my juniors under control.

489
00:42:09,368 --> 00:42:11,198
How dare he skip work.

490
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:12,368
And two days at that!

491
00:42:12,448 --> 00:42:14,368
Tell me about it. Not even a day, but two.

492
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:17,918
I wonder if he's sick
or if something happened to him.

493
00:42:17,998 --> 00:42:19,998
Look at you.

494
00:42:20,748 --> 00:42:22,798
I'll go get him right away.

495
00:42:24,088 --> 00:42:25,168
Mr. Gong.

496
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:28,048
Tell Prosecutor Song.

497
00:42:28,628 --> 00:42:29,718
The Kangchun case

498
00:42:29,798 --> 00:42:32,348
was passed on to Prosecutor Han
a long time ago,

499
00:42:32,968 --> 00:42:34,558
so he needs to come to work.

500
00:42:35,138 --> 00:42:38,688
If he's absent again tomorrow,
I will just...

501
00:42:39,478 --> 00:42:40,688
Darn it.

502
00:42:43,608 --> 00:42:45,398
Are you leaving, sir?

503
00:42:47,488 --> 00:42:49,108
- Goodbye.
- Move!

504
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:54,238
He's like a lunatic.

505
00:42:57,448 --> 00:42:59,118
Goodness gracious.

506
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:01,168
Mr. Gong, it's me.

507
00:43:01,248 --> 00:43:02,928
<i>Where are you, Prosecutor Song?</i>

508
00:43:02,998 --> 00:43:06,548
If you weren't going to come in,
you should've at least let me know.

509
00:43:06,628 --> 00:43:08,258
<i>How could you keep me waiting?</i>

510
00:43:08,338 --> 00:43:10,218
<i>I wondered what happened to you.</i>

511
00:43:10,298 --> 00:43:12,428
<i>I couldn't even sleep all night!</i>

512
00:43:12,508 --> 00:43:13,848
Mr. Gong.

513
00:43:13,928 --> 00:43:14,928
Yes?

514
00:43:16,388 --> 00:43:19,098
Investigation records? Lee Changwoo?

515
00:43:19,178 --> 00:43:22,148
You know, right?
The culprit of my father's case.

516
00:43:22,728 --> 00:43:24,608
Why do you ask all of a sudden...

517
00:43:24,688 --> 00:43:26,818
Secure all the materials of that case.

518
00:43:27,608 --> 00:43:30,898
Please hurry.
The retention period might expire soon.

519
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:33,238
I'll call you again later.

520
00:43:43,918 --> 00:43:47,918
NEW FUTURE PARTY
HWANG BYUNGCHUL

521
00:44:03,478 --> 00:44:04,768
Kim Seohee.

522
00:44:16,198 --> 00:44:18,158
Song Suhyeon is there too.

523
00:44:23,208 --> 00:44:26,038
<i>Where did you go without telling me?</i>

524
00:44:26,128 --> 00:44:28,548
Why? Did you think I ran away alone?

525
00:44:29,128 --> 00:44:31,628
How funny. Is that a joke?

526
00:44:31,718 --> 00:44:33,508
I went to call Mr. Gong.

527
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:35,138
In case the phone here was tapped.

528
00:44:35,218 --> 00:44:36,848
Why did you call him?

529
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:40,138
I'm going to check the past case records.

530
00:44:41,598 --> 00:44:44,518
The past records might hold a clue.
Or there could be something I missed.

531
00:44:46,688 --> 00:44:49,108
Look, I'm guessing...

532
00:44:50,358 --> 00:44:53,568
that Lee Changwoo stole the Adamas.

533
00:44:53,648 --> 00:44:55,108
I thought the same.

534
00:44:55,198 --> 00:44:56,778
The notorious thief, Lee Changwoo.

535
00:44:56,868 --> 00:44:59,198
He was once known
for stealing from the powerful.

536
00:44:59,278 --> 00:45:02,408
Right? Otherwise, why would he
be involved with Chairman Kwon?

537
00:45:02,498 --> 00:45:03,898
There's no connection between them.

538
00:45:03,958 --> 00:45:05,418
It's plausible enough.

539
00:45:07,288 --> 00:45:09,288
Lee Changwoo stole the Adamas,

540
00:45:09,378 --> 00:45:11,418
and while Haesong
was trying to retrieve it,

541
00:45:11,508 --> 00:45:13,628
my father got killed by mistake.

542
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:17,888
Ten days before the incident,

543
00:45:18,888 --> 00:45:20,608
<i>Lee Changwoo moved into that house.</i>

544
00:45:20,848 --> 00:45:22,218
- No.
- Gosh, leave it be.

545
00:45:22,308 --> 00:45:25,348
- I'll carry the rest.
<i>- My father was the mover.</i>

546
00:45:25,438 --> 00:45:27,188
Goodness.

547
00:45:27,268 --> 00:45:29,398
- It's fine.
<i>- According to the landlady,</i>

548
00:45:29,478 --> 00:45:32,228
<i>Lee Changwoo didn't know
he had to pay the monthly rent in advance.</i>

549
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:35,398
<i>He rushed to pay up on moving day</i>

550
00:45:35,488 --> 00:45:37,448
<i>and he didn't have enough left
for the moving fee.</i>

551
00:45:39,318 --> 00:45:40,408
A hundred thousand won.

552
00:45:41,948 --> 00:45:44,578
<i>My father went to demand that money</i>

553
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:47,618
<i>and ended up getting killed.</i>

554
00:45:49,038 --> 00:45:50,748
I can't be sure about the details though.

555
00:45:51,628 --> 00:45:52,668
Prosecutor Song.

556
00:45:53,758 --> 00:45:57,628
Chairman Kwon probably doesn't know
about your relationship with Mr. Ha.

557
00:45:58,428 --> 00:46:00,888
That must be why he hired Mr. Ha
as his ghostwriter.

558
00:46:01,468 --> 00:46:02,598
He's safe for now.

559
00:46:02,678 --> 00:46:03,968
I know.

560
00:46:05,428 --> 00:46:08,938
Had he sensed a problem,
he wouldn't have let him into the house.

561
00:46:09,938 --> 00:46:11,438
Then what's with the face?

562
00:46:12,768 --> 00:46:14,778
I can't stop thinking
that Woosin isn't himself.

563
00:46:14,858 --> 00:46:16,948
He always weighs the losses and gains

564
00:46:17,028 --> 00:46:19,528
to make the least risky decision.

565
00:46:20,118 --> 00:46:23,908
I just don't understand why
he's recklessly giving his all this time.

566
00:46:25,998 --> 00:46:26,998
Why?

567
00:46:27,748 --> 00:46:31,668
Is it what you mentioned last time?
Because he wasn't your biological father?

568
00:46:32,248 --> 00:46:33,668
No, not that.

569
00:46:35,048 --> 00:46:37,668
It'd be hard to understand
even if he was our real father.

570
00:46:37,758 --> 00:46:40,638
Could stealing the Adamas be
an easy way to get Chairman Kwon?

571
00:46:40,718 --> 00:46:44,178
Besides, the man you saw.

572
00:46:45,268 --> 00:46:48,228
Right. If that man is the real culprit,

573
00:46:48,308 --> 00:46:50,018
Chairman Kwon isn't.

574
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:51,608
Woosin must know that.

575
00:46:51,688 --> 00:46:54,608
So why is he still in that house?

576
00:46:54,688 --> 00:46:56,858
Why is he so hung up on this case?

577
00:46:56,938 --> 00:47:00,408
As far as I know,
he isn't an emotional guy.

578
00:47:00,488 --> 00:47:01,738
This time, why...

579
00:47:04,328 --> 00:47:06,288
Maybe he feels the same as you do.

580
00:47:07,788 --> 00:47:09,368
He's serious about this case.

581
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:13,708
Whether Chairman Kwon is culprit or not,
whoever the culprit may be...

582
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:17,548
he wants to catch them no matter what.

583
00:47:20,718 --> 00:47:21,838
I...

584
00:47:24,428 --> 00:47:26,308
I'm indebted to our father.

585
00:47:45,278 --> 00:47:46,328
Dad?

586
00:47:47,658 --> 00:47:48,908
Awesome!

587
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:59,048
Is your dad home?

588
00:47:59,628 --> 00:48:00,668
Mom, check this out.

589
00:48:01,258 --> 00:48:03,048
Gosh. What is this, Suhyeon?

590
00:48:03,138 --> 00:48:05,798
My Children's Day gift from Dad.

591
00:48:07,678 --> 00:48:09,348
Silly him.

592
00:48:10,268 --> 00:48:11,268
Where is he?

593
00:48:12,638 --> 00:48:15,188
I don't know.
I just found this on the floor.

594
00:48:17,648 --> 00:48:18,898
Did he go somewhere?

595
00:48:20,068 --> 00:48:21,068
I bet he went to work.

596
00:48:22,988 --> 00:48:25,778
How else do you think
he got that expensive toy?

597
00:48:26,658 --> 00:48:28,038
We're not well off.

598
00:48:30,118 --> 00:48:32,208
He's out working as a chauffeur.

599
00:48:33,828 --> 00:48:36,128
Song Suhyeon, you're not a kid anymore.

600
00:48:36,628 --> 00:48:38,498
- No, I...
- When will you grow up?

601
00:48:39,088 --> 00:48:40,258
Woosin.

602
00:48:46,338 --> 00:48:47,468
It's okay, Suhyeon.

603
00:48:47,968 --> 00:48:50,848
Woosin's just worried about your dad.

604
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:52,388
Go to bed now.

605
00:48:52,478 --> 00:48:53,598
No, Mom.

606
00:48:53,688 --> 00:48:55,308
Woosin's right.

607
00:48:55,898 --> 00:48:57,108
I'm going to wait for Dad.

608
00:48:57,608 --> 00:48:59,778
I want to apologize to him.

609
00:49:21,628 --> 00:49:22,958
Honey!

610
00:49:34,848 --> 00:49:37,148
- Honey!
- Dad...

611
00:49:45,818 --> 00:49:46,818
Mom, why are you crying?

612
00:49:47,448 --> 00:49:50,198
- Honey...
- Dad...

613
00:49:51,278 --> 00:49:53,038
Honey...

614
00:49:55,118 --> 00:49:56,458
What happened?

615
00:49:57,788 --> 00:49:59,788
<i>That night, our father didn't come back.</i>

616
00:50:01,458 --> 00:50:02,588
<i>For 100,000 won.</i>

617
00:50:04,588 --> 00:50:07,508
<i>He went to get that unpaid money and...</i>

618
00:50:10,508 --> 00:50:12,808
It's obvious why he needed the money.

619
00:50:14,638 --> 00:50:16,518
If he just hadn't gone
to get that money...

620
00:50:20,188 --> 00:50:24,478
If I hadn't asked him
to buy that action figure,

621
00:50:25,858 --> 00:50:27,238
he'd probably be...

622
00:50:30,028 --> 00:50:31,028
So,

623
00:50:32,158 --> 00:50:33,618
do you blame yourself?

624
00:50:39,458 --> 00:50:41,328
Prosecutor Song,

625
00:50:42,128 --> 00:50:46,548
do you remember what you said

626
00:50:47,918 --> 00:50:51,968
when I blamed myself
for my parents' death?

627
00:50:57,518 --> 00:50:59,188
Don't feel guilty.

628
00:51:00,058 --> 00:51:02,728
Why should victims suffer in pain

629
00:51:03,228 --> 00:51:06,228
when those guilty are doing just fine?

630
00:51:07,778 --> 00:51:09,398
You are innocent.

631
00:51:11,238 --> 00:51:13,118
Let me tell you exactly the same.

632
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:15,988
So let us

633
00:51:17,198 --> 00:51:19,208
stop feeling guilty,

634
00:51:19,958 --> 00:51:21,368
stay strong,

635
00:51:22,378 --> 00:51:23,628
and not give up.

636
00:51:27,508 --> 00:51:28,968
We will catch them,

637
00:51:30,588 --> 00:51:31,798
no matter what.

638
00:51:35,468 --> 00:51:37,218
I have something to tell you.

639
00:51:42,398 --> 00:51:43,478
Team A.

640
00:51:54,818 --> 00:51:56,488
Song Suhyeon.

641
00:52:05,038 --> 00:52:06,248
Mr. Lee.

642
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:12,218
We cremated your brother's body,
by the book.

643
00:52:13,798 --> 00:52:15,008
Well done.

644
00:52:15,968 --> 00:52:18,888
Did you look
into Song Suhyeon's twin brother?

645
00:52:19,428 --> 00:52:21,018
Yes, we got right to it.

646
00:52:21,098 --> 00:52:23,478
But there's no trace of him.

647
00:52:24,478 --> 00:52:27,938
What do you mean?
He lives with Song Suhyeon.

648
00:52:28,018 --> 00:52:31,278
He did until recently,
but he disappeared soon after.

649
00:52:33,528 --> 00:52:34,858
These guys are ridiculous.

650
00:52:36,828 --> 00:52:38,328
What's his name again?

651
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:39,868
Song Woosin.

652
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:42,288
He's a mystery writer
who goes by the pen name Ha Woosin.

653
00:52:42,368 --> 00:52:44,368
He's quite well-known.

654
00:52:44,458 --> 00:52:45,668
Ha Woosin.

655
00:52:47,588 --> 00:52:49,248
I guess he got it from his mom's surname.

656
00:52:49,838 --> 00:52:50,838
Ha Youngsin.

657
00:52:50,878 --> 00:52:53,428
You see, she died not long ago.

658
00:52:53,508 --> 00:52:56,708
So we'd skipped looking into the parents,
but this time, we discovered something.

659
00:52:57,388 --> 00:52:58,678
Look here.

660
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:00,138
FEBRUARY 2, 1986

661
00:53:00,768 --> 00:53:03,808
AUGUST 23, 1990

662
00:53:03,888 --> 00:53:06,169
It seems
Song Soonho isn't their real father.

663
00:53:06,228 --> 00:53:07,228
What?

664
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:09,438
Not their real father?

665
00:53:12,318 --> 00:53:16,698
Then why are these bastards
making such a fuss?

666
00:53:16,908 --> 00:53:18,708
Apparently,
Song Soonho was very good to them.

667
00:53:18,738 --> 00:53:21,158
Not even those around them
knew they weren't blood-related.

668
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:37,138
Sir, about Sun...

669
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:40,638
I gave him the order, but I don't think
he should mark Song Suhyeon.

670
00:53:41,388 --> 00:53:42,428
He's uncontrollable.

671
00:53:42,518 --> 00:53:44,678
He doesn't listen to me
and often goes off the rails...

672
00:53:44,768 --> 00:53:46,098
He's in this game.

673
00:53:47,148 --> 00:53:48,898
- Pardon?
- This writer.

674
00:53:49,398 --> 00:53:51,068
He disappeared around the time

675
00:53:51,148 --> 00:53:53,268
Song Suhyeon started
digging into their father's case.

676
00:53:53,318 --> 00:53:55,488
I'm sure there's something.

677
00:53:57,658 --> 00:53:59,158
The SIH is behind them.

678
00:54:02,038 --> 00:54:03,288
The SIH...

679
00:54:08,248 --> 00:54:10,208
- Mr. Jeong.
- Yes, sir.

680
00:54:14,168 --> 00:54:15,588
Gosh, I'm so full.

681
00:54:17,508 --> 00:54:19,428
Still, some things should not be skipped.

682
00:54:20,008 --> 00:54:22,308
But why would he get involved himself?

683
00:54:22,428 --> 00:54:23,628
He has his prosecutor brother.

684
00:54:24,598 --> 00:54:28,138
The Adamas or whatever. I don't care.

685
00:54:28,228 --> 00:54:29,668
It's not like he's going to sell it.

686
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:38,148
Wait. If it turns out that it wasn't used
for the murder, can we sell it?

687
00:54:47,248 --> 00:54:49,208
Ms. Oh? Couldn't you have knocked?

688
00:54:53,168 --> 00:54:57,508
Oh, this is...
The chairman gave it to Mr. Ha.

689
00:54:57,628 --> 00:54:59,838
And Mr. Ha said I could have it.

690
00:54:59,928 --> 00:55:01,798
It's true. I heard it's good for joints.

691
00:55:01,888 --> 00:55:02,928
Where's Mr. Ha?

692
00:55:04,138 --> 00:55:05,138
What?

693
00:55:05,968 --> 00:55:07,138
He's probably in the study.

694
00:55:12,108 --> 00:55:14,398
What's with that lady? How annoying.

695
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:26,658
<i>There are times when it lands
on the station to recharge its battery.</i>

696
00:55:27,248 --> 00:55:30,788
<i>At nine and three. Twice each
in the morning and afternoon.</i>

697
00:55:31,418 --> 00:55:34,878
<i>Once it's fully recharged, it operates
automatically again for six hours.</i>

698
00:55:35,458 --> 00:55:36,778
<i>A full charge takes five minutes.</i>

699
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:40,548
<i>The surveillance system
shuts down at 55 minutes.</i>

700
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:42,178
<i>So you have until three o'clock.</i>

701
00:55:49,388 --> 00:55:51,558
- Mr. Lee.
- Yes?

702
00:55:52,148 --> 00:55:54,228
- Go buy me a pack of cigarettes.
- Yes, sir.

703
00:55:55,188 --> 00:55:56,188
You know what I smoke?

704
00:55:57,398 --> 00:55:58,608
Yes, sir. I do.

705
00:56:43,448 --> 00:56:45,908
JANG YOUNGJA

706
00:56:46,488 --> 00:56:47,778
Patti Jang?

707
00:56:57,208 --> 00:56:58,128
Welcome.

708
00:56:58,208 --> 00:56:59,838
It's been a while, Ms. Jang.

709
00:56:59,918 --> 00:57:03,588
Yes, it's the first time since you placed
the order for your wedding rings.

710
00:57:03,678 --> 00:57:05,178
Mr. Kwon visited from time to time.

711
00:57:05,258 --> 00:57:07,548
He cares a lot about his mistress.

712
00:57:11,388 --> 00:57:12,928
How may I help you today?

713
00:57:13,268 --> 00:57:15,558
We'll be celebrating
the company's 80th anniversary soon.

714
00:57:15,648 --> 00:57:17,188
For the jewelry I'll wear that day.

715
00:57:17,268 --> 00:57:18,978
Oh, right.

716
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:20,858
Ms. Kwon told me.

717
00:57:21,068 --> 00:57:23,358
Your husband is to be inaugurated
as the new chairman.

718
00:57:23,698 --> 00:57:24,858
Congratulations.

719
00:57:25,698 --> 00:57:27,948
- Can you show me some options?
- Of course.

720
00:57:33,498 --> 00:57:34,618
This way.

721
00:57:37,668 --> 00:57:38,998
Thank you.

722
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:47,588
You must be busy with the Adamas.

723
00:57:48,178 --> 00:57:52,018
Not at all. I just strive to do my best.

724
00:57:53,268 --> 00:57:56,348
You're famous for your resetting skills.

725
00:57:57,228 --> 00:57:59,308
I have to start from the design,

726
00:57:59,398 --> 00:58:01,438
so I'm brainstorming
in many different ways.

727
00:58:02,028 --> 00:58:04,608
Since it's not any ordinary diamond.

728
00:58:04,938 --> 00:58:07,238
Then is the Adamas here?

729
00:58:08,908 --> 00:58:11,828
No, Haesong moved it.

730
00:58:12,408 --> 00:58:13,658
Didn't you know?

731
00:58:14,328 --> 00:58:16,908
I heard it's being stored
somewhere in secret.

732
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:20,288
I'll probably be sent there in secret too.

733
00:58:22,338 --> 00:58:24,708
I hardly get involved
in the company's affairs.

734
00:58:26,338 --> 00:58:27,378
I like this one.

735
00:58:27,968 --> 00:58:29,258
Indeed.

736
00:58:29,838 --> 00:58:31,968
That piece was made
with Canadian diamonds.

737
00:58:32,058 --> 00:58:34,598
It has been the center of attention
this season.

738
01:00:50,988 --> 01:00:52,028
What is this place?

739
01:01:20,808 --> 01:01:22,018
Ms. Kwon's room?

740
01:01:31,028 --> 01:01:32,988
RAT CATCH

741
01:01:33,068 --> 01:01:34,318
Rat poison.

742
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:10,058
Is he her son?

743
01:02:34,508 --> 01:02:36,048
High school days...

744
01:02:41,218 --> 01:02:42,598
The year 2012?

745
01:03:23,548 --> 01:03:25,388
Why is he in Ms. Kwon's room?

746
01:03:26,518 --> 01:03:28,058
Why isn't he coming out of there?

747
01:04:30,158 --> 01:04:31,158
Mr. Ha?

748
01:04:35,378 --> 01:04:36,878
I'm here to interview the chairman.

749
01:04:38,048 --> 01:04:39,668
I forgot that he's away.

750
01:04:41,378 --> 01:04:42,548
What are you doing here?

751
01:04:43,048 --> 01:04:46,888
Oh, Ms. Oh wanted to see me.

752
01:04:47,968 --> 01:04:49,098
Ms. Oh?

753
01:04:51,428 --> 01:04:53,098
You two are already here.

754
01:04:54,058 --> 01:04:56,358
Mr. Ha, you weren't
in your room or the study.

755
01:04:56,438 --> 01:04:58,318
So I wondered where you were.

756
01:04:59,068 --> 01:05:00,648
Did you tell him, Mr. Kim?

757
01:05:01,488 --> 01:05:03,028
Well...

758
01:05:08,488 --> 01:05:10,658
Yes, I escorted him here.

759
01:05:10,748 --> 01:05:12,368
Mm. Good job.

760
01:05:14,288 --> 01:05:16,538
Why did you want to see me, Ms. Oh?

761
01:05:25,628 --> 01:05:28,598
Mr. Ha, Mr. Kim,

762
01:05:30,558 --> 01:05:31,558
and Ms. Oh.

763
01:05:36,228 --> 01:05:37,518
Take a seat.

764
01:05:42,648 --> 01:05:45,008
What's there to talk about
in the chairman's office?

765
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:48,158
We'll be in trouble
if the chairman finds out.

766
01:05:49,738 --> 01:05:53,078
If you're well aware of it,
why did you do that?

767
01:05:58,878 --> 01:06:00,378
What were you doing here

768
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:03,418
at 10 p.m. yesterday?

769
01:06:13,558 --> 01:06:15,848
Hey, Mr. Jeong. How did it go?

770
01:06:19,858 --> 01:06:20,898
<i>Yes, Mr. Lee.</i>

771
01:06:21,568 --> 01:06:23,898
I've secured
the Lee Changwoo case materials.

772
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:27,658
LEE CHANGWOO MURDER CASE

773
01:06:33,198 --> 01:06:35,198
What... Are these it?

774
01:06:35,288 --> 01:06:37,708
SINCHON COLLEGE GIRL MURDER CASE

775
01:06:41,288 --> 01:06:42,458
Where did it go?

776
01:06:42,958 --> 01:06:46,008
Yes, good job. See you at the office.

777
01:06:50,088 --> 01:06:52,098
NEW EDITION / PRICE 16,000 WON

778
01:06:52,178 --> 01:06:54,178
PERSONA NON GRATA
WRITER HA WOOSIN

779
01:06:55,888 --> 01:06:57,178
<i>Team A?</i>

780
01:06:57,268 --> 01:06:59,228
They're the ones who raided the SIH.

781
01:06:59,308 --> 01:07:02,518
I'm sure Mr. Kang called them that...
Team A.

782
01:07:02,608 --> 01:07:06,278
So the SIH knew who they were.

783
01:07:06,358 --> 01:07:07,488
I think so.

784
01:07:08,068 --> 01:07:10,254
They might not have been sure
the man from the composite

785
01:07:10,278 --> 01:07:11,738
was part of that team, though.

786
01:07:11,818 --> 01:07:13,078
Find Mr. Lee.

787
01:07:13,158 --> 01:07:14,368
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

788
01:07:17,078 --> 01:07:19,038
The others called them sir. I think he's...

789
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:20,248
The leader.

790
01:07:24,918 --> 01:07:25,918
Who is it?

791
01:07:26,798 --> 01:07:28,048
I'm not expecting anyone.

792
01:07:48,858 --> 01:07:49,988
What do we do?

793
01:08:18,388 --> 01:08:19,388
<i>It's a bribe.</i>

794
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:21,728
Are you trying to buy me off with this?

795
01:08:21,808 --> 01:08:24,648
I know what I saw.
They called him their leader.

796
01:08:24,728 --> 01:08:25,914
<i>Dispose of the rest.</i>

797
01:08:25,938 --> 01:08:28,568
The father couldn't
differentiate the twins?

798
01:08:28,648 --> 01:08:31,238
<i>I think Ms. Kwon's late son
is her weakness.</i>

799
01:08:31,318 --> 01:08:34,568
<i>The reason why Ms. Yoon
recommended you. To steal my husband.</i>

800
01:08:34,658 --> 01:08:36,554
<i>And you know who the targets are?</i>

801
01:08:36,578 --> 01:08:37,448
<i>Kill them no matter what.</i>

802
