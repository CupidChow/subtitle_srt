1
00:00:51,008 --> 00:00:53,428
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:55,930
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:42,018
IN THE NAME OF MOTHER

4
00:01:55,948 --> 00:01:58,451
We've titled the slogan as My First Gun.

5
00:01:58,534 --> 00:02:01,913
We have various colors in mind
from black to pink and pastel tones,

6
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:04,749
including products for women.

7
00:02:04,832 --> 00:02:06,584
To make the product more approachable,

8
00:02:06,667 --> 00:02:09,212
we're planning to come up
with a series of friendly commercials.

9
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,631
And by hiring trendy celebrities
to model our products,

10
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:14,717
we will make them look like fashion items.

11
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,303
This kind of approach is expected

12
00:02:17,386 --> 00:02:20,973
to blunt the repulsion against firearms
in the primary sense.

13
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:24,268
We've benchmarked
the gun culture in the States.

14
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:26,145
If we can actualize it here,

15
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,439
Haesong's future
will become even brighter.

16
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:32,860
"My First Gun."

17
00:02:35,404 --> 00:02:36,239
I like it.

18
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,199
Oh, thank you.

19
00:02:39,116 --> 00:02:40,117
All right.

20
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,662
Let's shake up this country!

21
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,246
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

22
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:47,624
Oh, right.

23
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:50,962
About the preparations
for the 80th-anniversary ceremony,

24
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:53,339
my father entrusted
the whole process to Ms. Kwon.

25
00:02:53,422 --> 00:02:56,884
I'd like the company
to support her properly.

26
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:59,720
Of course. It will be
the chairman's retirement ceremony.

27
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:04,350
Gosh, this idiot.

28
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,696
It will be my inauguration ceremony.

29
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,996
It's not bad.

30
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:26,873
Proceed with it.

31
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:29,834
Yes, sir.
Why don't you have lunch with me?

32
00:03:30,626 --> 00:03:31,919
No, thanks.

33
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,046
Will you return right away?

34
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,465
It feels suffocating in Seoul.

35
00:03:38,342 --> 00:03:41,095
Father, about the Adamas...

36
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:44,849
I think we should station more guards
with Ms. Jang.

37
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,143
You know, it was stolen once...

38
00:03:47,226 --> 00:03:49,729
Don't mention what happened in the past.
You might jinx it.

39
00:03:52,064 --> 00:03:53,064
I'm sorry.

40
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:57,278
I'm just bothered by what that prosecutor
is up to these days.

41
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,739
I heard from Mr. Lee.

42
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:01,866
Mr. Lee?

43
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:04,160
He didn't tell me about meeting you.

44
00:04:04,243 --> 00:04:05,786
He came in a rush.

45
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:08,455
I see.

46
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:13,753
Father. Actually,
Mr. Lee isn't who he used to be.

47
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:14,879
Hyunjo.

48
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:21,636
Don't try to see what's under the surface.

49
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:23,721
Stay out of it.

50
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:46,160
- Mr. Jeong.
- Yes, sir.

51
00:04:46,243 --> 00:04:48,996
Beef up security on Ms. Jang's side.

52
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,708
Yes, sir. I'll let Mr. Lee know
and assign them right away.

53
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,837
I'm giving you the order.

54
00:04:58,172 --> 00:04:59,799
Why would you bring up Mr. Lee here?

55
00:05:00,841 --> 00:05:01,884
Pardon?

56
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:07,223
Yes, sir.

57
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:15,481
How much longer will you stay
in his shadow?

58
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,318
Team A needs a change.

59
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,029
A young leader.

60
00:05:26,033 --> 00:05:28,452
Are that prosecutor
and female reporter still alive?

61
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,706
Isn't that wrong?

62
00:05:33,165 --> 00:05:34,208
I'm sorry, sir.

63
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:39,255
Don't be sorry.

64
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,757
I hate it when people are sorry.

65
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,720
I'll take care of them soon.

66
00:05:47,596 --> 00:05:48,723
Do you mean it?

67
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:57,273
If they manage to survive again,
you will have to stand in

68
00:05:57,606 --> 00:05:59,316
for that target, okay?

69
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,964
I've gathered some material on the case.

70
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,592
I also snuck a copy
of the case record just in case.

71
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,178
Isn't that illegal?

72
00:06:28,345 --> 00:06:30,097
Look who's talking.

73
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:42,735
What on earth?

74
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,863
They came by.

75
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:59,335
They're gone.
All the records I've gathered.

76
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,755
I doubt this was the only place
they ransacked.

77
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,192
Who are you?

78
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,075
Are you Mr. Gong Daechul?

79
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,160
Do you know me?

80
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,496
Where's Song Suhyeon?

81
00:07:38,165 --> 00:07:40,876
Out of the blue?
I don't know where he is. How would I?

82
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:46,590
There's no trace of him packing.
It means he didn't plan on hiding.

83
00:07:57,601 --> 00:07:58,769
Too bad.

84
00:08:01,021 --> 00:08:04,608
If you don't know,
it'll be a headache for both of us.

85
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,745
I can't visit him?

86
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:19,165
That's what the law says, mister.

87
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:22,126
In exceptional cases, the prison chief

88
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,461
may prohibit visitations.

89
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,839
Look how gutsy you are,

90
00:08:26,922 --> 00:08:29,508
explaining the law to a prosecutor.

91
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:33,679
A prosecutor?

92
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,360
- The punishment room?
- Yes.

93
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:49,778
There was a report

94
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:53,282
that he took narcotics
that were smuggled in.

95
00:08:53,365 --> 00:08:56,076
He's in solitary
until the investigation is over.

96
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:59,163
So you locked him up
and are forbidding visitations?

97
00:08:59,246 --> 00:09:02,666
If anyone's unhappy with it,
they'll file an administrative litigation.

98
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,668
To revoke his punishment.

99
00:09:07,087 --> 00:09:10,174
Did the prosecution ask for a prohibition
on visitation regarding this case?

100
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,843
I doubt it.

101
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,930
You haven't even made an official request
to investigate it.

102
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,683
I have full authority over this matter.

103
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:23,020
So the prison is conducting
the investigation? And you are the judge?

104
00:09:23,103 --> 00:09:24,396
No.

105
00:09:24,563 --> 00:09:26,482
Well, that's...

106
00:09:26,565 --> 00:09:28,192
Let me make it clear for you.

107
00:09:28,275 --> 00:09:31,028
Criminally speaking,
you're abusing your authority here.

108
00:09:31,111 --> 00:09:33,364
You are keeping an inmate
from exercising his rights.

109
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:36,408
You want me to list all the ways
you're violating criminal law?

110
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:39,912
What do you say?

111
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:47,670
My point here is,
let me speak with Lee Changwoo in person.

112
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,589
What's taking him so long?

113
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:52,925
What is this, a family reunion?

114
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,594
Ten minutes should be enough for a visit.

115
00:09:58,722 --> 00:10:00,432
Why would it snow in April?

116
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,978
So much for a car wash.

117
00:10:04,728 --> 00:10:06,188
He refused to meet you.

118
00:10:07,439 --> 00:10:09,733
Did you specifically tell him my name?

119
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:10,943
Yes.

120
00:10:11,735 --> 00:10:12,861
Gosh.

121
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,906
Let's go to the punishment room.

122
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,576
I'll go there myself.

123
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,081
What?

124
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,501
Read this first.

125
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:31,796
What is this?

126
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,717
Inmate 1014 wrote it himself.

127
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:40,347
PROSECUTOR SONG, I DON'T WANT TO MEET YOU
DON'T EVER COME AGAIN

128
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:43,434
Prosecutor, what should we do?

129
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:47,104
It's not like we can force him
to meet you against his will.

130
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:54,778
Don't smirk, all right?

131
00:11:53,128 --> 00:11:54,546
Good job.

132
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,592
Whatever that prosecutor says,
don't give him a reaction.

133
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,470
Spare yourself, okay?

134
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:06,433
It won't do you any good
to antagonize Team A.

135
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:26,203
You...

136
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,540
Darn those bastards!

137
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:31,875
Hey!

138
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:34,545
Watch your temper already.

139
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:37,506
Why would you kick my precious baby?

140
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:38,590
What?

141
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:41,093
It's still just a toddler.

142
00:12:41,468 --> 00:12:42,970
This is no time to joke around.

143
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:44,554
Gosh.

144
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:47,433
Honey, use your brain.

145
00:12:48,016 --> 00:12:49,560
Why would they stop your visit?

146
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,687
Because they know it'll work against them.

147
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:57,067
To shut Lee Changwoo up?
Does that mean he knows something?

148
00:12:57,901 --> 00:12:58,986
Bingo.

149
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:00,696
Ah.

150
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:04,324
Well, I should give it my best shot then.

151
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,160
Yes, it's me.

152
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:09,788
What?

153
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,668
- The Lee Changwoo case files are all gone.
- It makes no sense!

154
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:17,004
How could they vanish from the archive?

155
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,047
They didn't vanish.

156
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:22,759
We used an external cleaning service
when we changed archive rooms.

157
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:26,597
And they burned those records
with some other trash by mistake.

158
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,765
It's driving me crazy too.

159
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:32,352
But everything else is there.
Are you sure no one took them?

160
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,188
Look here.

161
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:37,316
You shouldn't say such a thing.

162
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,193
Why are you trying to cover it up?

163
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:42,571
Then what else can we do?

164
00:13:42,654 --> 00:13:45,657
Arrest that poor cleaning lady?

165
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:46,950
Put her in cuffs?

166
00:13:47,784 --> 00:13:51,872
Look, that case was closed
a long time ago, so the record...

167
00:13:51,955 --> 00:13:53,540
You call that an excuse?

168
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,876
Goodness.

169
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:00,631
Whatever. Go write an article
about this if you want.

170
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,341
Suit yourself.

171
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,384
Hey, let's go.

172
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:07,387
Jeez, she's just unbelievable.

173
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,184
Ms. Kim.

174
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,521
Take this.

175
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,193
Hello. Did you hear what happened?

176
00:14:21,276 --> 00:14:25,113
Forget everything else
but the autopsy report...

177
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,490
Even if we get the Adamas,

178
00:14:26,573 --> 00:14:29,034
we need that report
to make the comparison.

179
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,621
AUTOPSY REPORT

180
00:14:33,997 --> 00:14:36,083
- I appreciate your hard work.
- Oh, Mr. Lee.

181
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:39,836
Where's Mr. Jeong?

182
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,382
I ordered him to shred these himself.

183
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:45,342
Oh, Mr. Kwon summoned him.

184
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,053
- Mr. Kwon?
- Yes, sir.

185
00:14:50,597 --> 00:14:52,057
He must be pissed.

186
00:14:52,849 --> 00:14:56,228
Seeing that he skipped me
and summoned Mr. Jeong directly.

187
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:00,816
Mr. Lee.

188
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,069
I did what you asked
and put it on your desk.

189
00:15:35,475 --> 00:15:38,854
I don't know anything. I really don't.

190
00:15:39,771 --> 00:15:44,109
Prosecutor Song asked me
for the Lee Changwoo case records,

191
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,861
but then,

192
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:48,530
they disappeared.

193
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:52,075
He didn't answer his phone,

194
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,036
so I came here, that's all.

195
00:15:57,789 --> 00:15:59,583
- Mister.
- Yes?

196
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:02,419
Look at me.

197
00:16:08,383 --> 00:16:10,093
I said, look at me.

198
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:21,063
Do you think I'm asking where he is

199
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,566
because I really don't know?

200
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:30,405
He has probably heard by now
that the case records have disappeared.

201
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,949
So where would he go next?

202
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,751
He'd probably visit his father's grave.

203
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,757
The scar left in his father's skeleton

204
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,344
could replace the missing autopsy report.

205
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,434
If you already knew, why did you...

206
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,856
I ask you questions,

207
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,900
and you can't answer them.

208
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,404
That way,

209
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:12,781
I can justify myself.

210
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,243
A reason to make a move.

211
00:17:33,009 --> 00:17:34,052
Mister.

212
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:36,805
Bite down on this.

213
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,615
Our only hope is my father's grave.

214
00:17:56,908 --> 00:17:57,951
For another autopsy?

215
00:17:58,034 --> 00:18:01,163
There should be a scar.
It was stuck in his left eye.

216
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:04,750
Thank goodness you buried him
in a family gravesite.

217
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,293
Your ancestors must be helping.

218
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:10,714
Darn, they even got rid
of the case records.

219
00:18:10,797 --> 00:18:13,300
Fine, let's fight dirty.

220
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:48,460
Ms. Oh.

221
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:55,300
I have a favor to ask of you.

222
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:59,095
Officially or unofficially?

223
00:19:00,972 --> 00:19:02,974
The latter.

224
00:19:03,558 --> 00:19:04,558
Go on.

225
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,021
I'd like you to get me my bag.

226
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:09,730
Your bag?

227
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:12,400
Yes, the one I brought
when I came to this house.

228
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,612
Oh, they must've taken it from you
for security purposes.

229
00:19:15,695 --> 00:19:17,614
Personal belongings
are not allowed in here.

230
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:19,574
But why?

231
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:24,621
Well, I need it for something.

232
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:29,042
I'm not close
with any security guards here.

233
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,546
Sure.

234
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:37,217
I shouldn't turn down your request.

235
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:38,969
Thank you.

236
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,061
Between us...

237
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,206
I'm not sure if this is okay.

238
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,458
Don't you want to stop being a house dog?

239
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:14,337
I promised I'd get you a job
at the head office if you listen to me.

240
00:20:18,216 --> 00:20:19,259
Yes, ma'am.

241
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,803
At your service.

242
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:34,399
Ms. Oh.

243
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,569
Make sure you keep your promise.

244
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:38,945
Just wait.

245
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,417
Eighteen.

246
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,342
Twenty.

247
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:10,851
Do you drink that often?

248
00:21:11,394 --> 00:21:12,394
This?

249
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,439
It's good to drink anytime.

250
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,361
I got one for you.

251
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,155
No, thanks.

252
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:23,739
Have it.

253
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:39,464
I hope Ms. Kwon likes your novel.

254
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:44,177
By the way, why are you suddenly
so hung up on her son?

255
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,013
I thought Chairman Kwon killed my father.

256
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,725
Leaving out the time he spent abroad,

257
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:54,145
the statute of limitations was in effect,
so I thought it was worth a shot. But...

258
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,522
But the witness showed up.

259
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,732
Right, Mr. Lee.

260
00:21:58,274 --> 00:22:01,236
If he is the culprit, Chairman Kwon isn't.

261
00:22:01,736 --> 00:22:04,990
Then I wondered
what there could be to punish him with.

262
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,073
Ah.

263
00:22:06,449 --> 00:22:09,035
You want to tie him
to the death of Ms. Kwon's son?

264
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,871
As the culprit of another murder case.

265
00:22:13,581 --> 00:22:14,666
I like that.

266
00:22:17,293 --> 00:22:20,880
It'd be insurance and a means
to tear apart Ms. Kwon and the chairman.

267
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,924
If her loyalty is tested,

268
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:26,011
she will ease her blind suspicion
against me.

269
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,230
Let me see.

270
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:40,525
What could be in here?

271
00:22:41,609 --> 00:22:44,154
Why the sudden need for his bag?

272
00:22:45,321 --> 00:22:47,907
What's gotten into him?

273
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:53,663
What is this? In the Name of Mother?

274
00:22:58,585 --> 00:22:59,711
A novel?

275
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:02,047
You wrote a story about her son?

276
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,882
Just a few pages.

277
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,762
Ms. Kwon's son attempted suicide
and was declared brain-dead.

278
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:13,933
Then his heart was transplanted
to Chairman Kwon. Isn't it dramatic?

279
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,187
I wonder how she'll react to that story.

280
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,815
She'll deny it vehemently.

281
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,863
And she'll try to see if it's true.

282
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:32,494
"After painstaking
deliberation, Duke Alfonso"

283
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:35,121
decided to choose his nanny's only son

284
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:37,707
"as the suitable donorfor
the heart transplant."

285
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:43,755
"'It's easier to make a
donorthan to wait for one.'"

286
00:23:44,422 --> 00:23:46,341
Looking at his doctor, Allen,

287
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:50,470
the duke made a cold smile.

288
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:54,891
Dr. Allen was satisfied with
the conditionand that night,

289
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:59,104
"he declared a young man
in a comabrain-dead."

290
00:24:04,984 --> 00:24:08,321
"A loyal nanny would be willing"

291
00:24:09,864 --> 00:24:13,201
"to offer her child's heart to her master."

292
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:18,790
No...

293
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,709
No.

294
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,003
No, it can't be.

295
00:24:24,879 --> 00:24:25,880
No!

296
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,174
You want to study abroad?

297
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:30,718
I put you through college.
Wasn't that enough?

298
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,887
Stop dreaming
and just learn to work under me!

299
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:35,890
You want me to be a servant like you?

300
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,600
A servant? You brat.

301
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:40,353
Let go.

302
00:24:40,436 --> 00:24:43,398
Mother, you care more about the chairman
than me, don't you?

303
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:47,485
Of course. I care about the master
way more than you.

304
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:50,029
Master this, master that!

305
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:53,533
I'm going to leave.
I'd die before I live the way you do.

306
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:57,036
What? You won't live like I do?

307
00:24:57,745 --> 00:25:00,498
Fine, die.

308
00:25:00,748 --> 00:25:03,251
Die, you brat.
How could you say that to your mother?

309
00:25:03,334 --> 00:25:06,129
Just go die.

310
00:25:06,212 --> 00:25:08,173
Die!

311
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:26,191
Hoon!

312
00:25:26,774 --> 00:25:29,569
Hoon! Oh, no.

313
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:35,450
Hoon!

314
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:41,873
Hoon...

315
00:26:05,813 --> 00:26:09,317
Please... do as I say.

316
00:26:09,692 --> 00:26:12,654
But, how could I possibly take his heart?

317
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:16,991
Master, please.

318
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:19,661
Only then

319
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:24,165
will I be able to think
Hoon is alive and well by my side.

320
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:47,438
Ms. Kwon will realize
that the story is about her.

321
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,068
She'll no longer feel
as devoted to the chairman.

322
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,029
It could be dangerous.

323
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,281
What if she talks to him about this?

324
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,742
No, she could never.

325
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:01,911
Why is that?

326
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:05,373
It'd be a bigger loss for Ms. Kwon.

327
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:08,084
Chairman Kwon
wouldn't keep her by his side.

328
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:12,338
Ms. Kwon is quick-witted enough
to know that.

329
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:15,466
True.

330
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:18,094
They would suspect each other.

331
00:27:18,177 --> 00:27:20,263
She'd wonder if he killed her son,

332
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,348
and he'd wonder if she suspects him.

333
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:24,517
A difference in opinion.

334
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,479
It's the beginning of distrust.

335
00:27:29,313 --> 00:27:31,232
I have a question.

336
00:27:33,067 --> 00:27:34,777
You once said...

337
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:37,089
I need to find out where it's stored
as soon as possible.

338
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:38,257
Before the recrafting begins.

339
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:39,615
Should I look into it?

340
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:41,576
No. Leave it up to us.

341
00:27:43,494 --> 00:27:44,704
"Us."

342
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:49,167
Is there someone else
helping you other than me?

343
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:56,424
- No.
- In this house or outside?

344
00:27:58,259 --> 00:27:59,259
There's no one else.

345
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:05,558
There isn't.

346
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:14,984
You say there isn't anyone,
but I think otherwise.

347
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,445
What do you call this kind of situation?

348
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:21,491
A difference in opinion.

349
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:26,704
The beginning of distrust.

350
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:30,999
Ms. Eun.

351
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,835
You drew the line first.

352
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:35,129
"I'm not Kwon Minjo."

353
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:37,298
"I'm not interested
in punishing the chairman."

354
00:28:37,381 --> 00:28:39,717
"We're not after the same thing."
You said so.

355
00:28:43,262 --> 00:28:44,639
Did you change your mind?

356
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:51,104
What a shame.

357
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:08,496
It's a lie! A lie...

358
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,293
Ha Woosin...

359
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:30,017
We've started our process to win her over

360
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,894
by trying to separate her
and the chairman.

361
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:34,438
But she isn't showing any response yet.

362
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,150
We'll see how it goes and act accordingly.

363
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:38,234
Okay.

364
00:29:39,026 --> 00:29:42,446
We're also taking two measures
in case Mr. Ha's plan falls through.

365
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:45,700
We're trying to figure out
where Ms. Jang, the jewelry designer, is.

366
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:47,425
We were too focused on the task at hand.

367
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:51,414
Team A took Lee Changwoo's case file.

368
00:29:51,497 --> 00:29:54,167
What? Even the autopsy report?

369
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:58,004
What on earth?
Then all this would've been for nothing.

370
00:29:58,087 --> 00:29:59,964
Now the remaining option is...

371
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:16,731
Something's off.

372
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:19,734
It hasn't taken root yet.

373
00:30:20,234 --> 00:30:21,360
It was planted recently.

374
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,865
What, those punks already came here?

375
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,159
And dug up this grave to...

376
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,161
To vandalize his body.

377
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:34,999
I'm getting the creeps.

378
00:30:35,499 --> 00:30:37,001
Wait, let me think.

379
00:30:37,668 --> 00:30:40,463
Now, even if we get our hands
on the Adamas,

380
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,560
we won't have anything to compare it with.

381
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:44,550
This is terrible.

382
00:30:45,551 --> 00:30:47,637
How are we going to prove
it was used for the murder?

383
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,681
Was it Woosin?

384
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:52,600
What?

385
00:30:52,683 --> 00:30:54,936
This grave isn't my father's.

386
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,856
- What?
- An old man lived alone in our village.

387
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,316
My father buried him here.

388
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,569
He'd tidy up the grave
and hold a memorial service for him.

389
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,947
The gravestone was switched.

390
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,952
He knew Haesong would damage the body.

391
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:14,330
Since the strongest evidence
in a murder case

392
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,540
is the victim himself.

393
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,962
But who? Who expected
this would happen and changed gravestones?

394
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:22,672
Isn't it obvious?

395
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,718
This one is my father's.

396
00:31:47,029 --> 00:31:48,698
I'll make sure to catch the culprit.

397
00:31:50,908 --> 00:31:52,410
For you, Father.

398
00:31:54,745 --> 00:31:56,122
And for him.

399
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,334
PUNISHMENT

400
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:04,005
Whatever that prosecutor says,
don't give him a reaction.

401
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:06,007
Spare yourself, okay?

402
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:08,926
It won't do you any
goodto antagonize Team A.

403
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:15,182
We're good for the time being.

404
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:18,311
Team A would believe
that they damaged the body.

405
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,147
That punk. He's always one step ahead.

406
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:22,398
You mean your brother?

407
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,401
If he were a soccer player,
he would've made it big.

408
00:32:26,652 --> 00:32:29,989
By the way, what's your name?
I don't even know your name yet.

409
00:32:30,614 --> 00:32:32,700
In my line of work,
we don't introduce ourselves.

410
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:37,288
We don't know when we'll die,
so it's no use making friends.

411
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,874
It's not like we'll die together.

412
00:32:40,082 --> 00:32:42,585
Just call me "Mr. Baek."

413
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:46,630
I'm sheepish with calling you Mr. Baek.

414
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:50,426
Want a beating, honey?

415
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:53,054
How about just Baek?

416
00:32:54,096 --> 00:32:56,182
Baek? It's not bad.

417
00:32:58,809 --> 00:33:00,269
I'm hearing something.

418
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:04,690
Hear what?

419
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,359
I think a phone's ringing.

420
00:33:25,002 --> 00:33:26,002
Should I open it?

421
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:41,435
Oh, my.

422
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,932
Those crazy bastards...

423
00:34:20,015 --> 00:34:22,351
- No, wait.
- Let go of me.

424
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:36,949
Pick up.

425
00:34:39,201 --> 00:34:40,911
Pick up the phone.

426
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:54,467
Who are you?

427
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:57,470
Who... Who are you?

428
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,055
Who are you?

429
00:35:05,102 --> 00:35:06,145
Sun.

430
00:35:16,363 --> 00:35:17,363
Boom.

431
00:35:30,252 --> 00:35:34,131
You at least needed to know
who was killing you.

432
00:35:36,091 --> 00:35:39,011
Now I feel bad.

433
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,183
Mr. Ha.

434
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:48,020
We have a serious problem.

435
00:35:52,691 --> 00:35:54,401
I think Ms. Kwon has finally gone insane.

436
00:35:54,568 --> 00:35:56,820
She's yelling out loudly, asking for you.

437
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:58,697
She's absolutely lost her mind.

438
00:36:00,574 --> 00:36:03,869
Her eyes are flipping out
as if she's ready to kill someone.

439
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:08,082
Just what have you done this time?
I feel so anxious

440
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:11,335
that it's killing me, seriously.

441
00:36:22,179 --> 00:36:23,222
Ms. Kwon?

442
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:29,562
Ms. Kwon.

443
00:36:31,605 --> 00:36:33,023
Did you ask for me?

444
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,068
Mr. Ha.

445
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,905
I didn't like you from the start.

446
00:36:40,739 --> 00:36:42,950
Your eyes told me
that you were hiding something.

447
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:45,703
Those eyes bothered me.

448
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:49,164
I'm hiding something? Me?

449
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:51,542
Your true motive for coming to this house.

450
00:36:53,627 --> 00:36:55,087
I'm not really following.

451
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:59,508
Drop your clumsy act.

452
00:37:01,343 --> 00:37:03,929
You came here
to write a story about my son.

453
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:05,806
You needed information to do that.

454
00:37:09,768 --> 00:37:10,894
Ah.

455
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:13,105
Ah.

456
00:37:13,188 --> 00:37:14,607
Ah?

457
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:18,277
Let me explain.

458
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,279
No, you don't have to.

459
00:37:20,779 --> 00:37:24,199
I've read your incredulous story.

460
00:37:26,076 --> 00:37:28,537
You've read it?
You mean the manuscript in my bag?

461
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:29,705
Yes.

462
00:37:30,914 --> 00:37:31,914
Ah.

463
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,293
So you have.

464
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,137
I guess I can't hide it anymore.

465
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:49,391
You're right. I came to this house

466
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:51,894
because of what happened to your son.

467
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:56,815
It's quite interesting.

468
00:37:58,734 --> 00:37:59,985
Interesting?

469
00:38:00,819 --> 00:38:04,031
Is it fun to gossip
about someone else's deceased child?

470
00:38:04,114 --> 00:38:05,616
Yes, to the public.

471
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,869
In the house of a well-known family,

472
00:38:08,952 --> 00:38:11,413
a young, healthy man attempted suicide.

473
00:38:11,997 --> 00:38:14,077
He was declared brain-dead
and his organ was donated.

474
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:17,127
Coincidentally, the recipient was...

475
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:18,837
What are you trying to say?

476
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:24,009
My interest in your son's story

477
00:38:24,718 --> 00:38:27,721
simply started from my imagination
as a writer.

478
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:31,767
What if it was not suicide,

479
00:38:32,726 --> 00:38:33,811
but murder?

480
00:38:38,023 --> 00:38:40,442
In murder cases, the primary suspect...

481
00:38:42,027 --> 00:38:46,281
is usually the one who gains the most
from the victim's death.

482
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:47,991
If so,

483
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:50,703
who would the culprit be?

484
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,251
The question triggered my imagination.

485
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:23,610
You sure are a funny guy.

486
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:27,990
You're trying to harass me
with my son's story.

487
00:39:28,073 --> 00:39:31,118
Because I treat you like an eyesore.

488
00:39:31,326 --> 00:39:34,037
Too bad. It's not going to work.

489
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:38,083
- You're mistaken. I only...
- Listen.

490
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:44,381
I no longer feel attached to him.

491
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:47,926
I don't know what you heard,
but don't try to pull any tricks on me.

492
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:51,680
Ms. Kwon.

493
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,015
Shut your mouth and listen!

494
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:58,729
The master gave me full authority
over the 80th-anniversary ceremony.

495
00:39:59,062 --> 00:40:00,689
His retirement ceremony, to be exact.

496
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:01,899
Me...

497
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:05,235
He chose me, Kwon Soonyi,

498
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:08,238
out of all those important people
at the company.

499
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:09,448
Do you hear me?

500
00:40:10,073 --> 00:40:12,075
Whatever you came here to do,

501
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:14,953
I have no time or energy to care, got it?

502
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:20,959
Leave this house immediately.

503
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:25,589
That's not my choice to make.

504
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:30,677
You already know. I can't do that
without the chairman's permission.

505
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:31,804
Really?

506
00:40:32,554 --> 00:40:34,723
Then I'll tell him myself.

507
00:40:35,682 --> 00:40:36,517
Tell him what?

508
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:40,354
Don't waste your effort and pack up
while I'm giving you the chance.

509
00:40:43,982 --> 00:40:45,275
The master

510
00:40:46,443 --> 00:40:49,238
has nothing to do with my son's death.

511
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:00,332
Me First Principle.

512
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:04,169
Your words tend to indicatea
psychological distance.

513
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:05,730
WORDS OF IMPORTANCE COME FIRST IN ORDER

514
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:08,590
For example, you mentionsomeone
closer to you before the other.

515
00:41:09,716 --> 00:41:10,884
The master

516
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:14,179
has nothing to do with my son's death.

517
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:18,100
She cares about Chairman
Kwonmore deeply than I thought.

518
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:19,917
But when she talks about her son...

519
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:24,439
I no longer feel attached to him.

520
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,781
She doesn't even say his name.

521
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:38,120
Then why...

522
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,395
does she keep his photos?

523
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,148
It shows an attachment.

524
00:42:14,781 --> 00:42:16,283
A sense of guilt?

525
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:50,901
SEOUL BUKANG HIGH SCHOOL

526
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,698
What? How dare you...

527
00:42:57,491 --> 00:43:00,744
You'll tell the chairman
why I actually came here?

528
00:43:01,411 --> 00:43:03,372
No, you can't.

529
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:06,124
- What?
- How will you put it?

530
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:08,328
"He says you have something
to do with my son's death,

531
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:10,253
and he's writing a novel about it."

532
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:13,882
- Shut up.
- I wonder how he will respond.

533
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:16,468
Will he care about me suspecting him?

534
00:43:16,551 --> 00:43:19,680
Or will he care about how you see it?

535
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,765
- I said, shut up.
- I'm curious myself.

536
00:43:21,848 --> 00:43:23,058
What do you think?

537
00:43:23,141 --> 00:43:24,685
- You...
- You've never suspected him?

538
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:27,896
No! I had never suspected him even once.

539
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:31,024
That's the past tense. What about now?

540
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:37,698
Stop running your mouth.

541
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,200
What do you even know?

542
00:43:40,867 --> 00:43:42,911
You don't know anything!

543
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:43,995
Ms. Kwon.

544
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:46,665
So what are you trying to say?

545
00:43:46,748 --> 00:43:50,669
That the master deliberately took
my son's heart?

546
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:55,173
Why?

547
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:59,928
Why now?

548
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:08,562
"Why now?"

549
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,151
You mean...

550
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:20,406
Get out.

551
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:24,786
Get out!

552
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:41,344
She knew.

553
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:51,313
No.

554
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:55,400
No!

555
00:44:56,693 --> 00:44:59,321
No...

556
00:45:01,239 --> 00:45:04,326
No, he didn't.

557
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:07,287
He didn't.

558
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:09,748
He did not.

559
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:17,172
IN THE NAME OF MOTHER

560
00:45:38,401 --> 00:45:40,487
What if it was not suicide,

561
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:42,739
but murder?

562
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:46,284
In murder cases, the primary suspect...

563
00:45:46,743 --> 00:45:50,956
is usually the one who gains
the mostfrom the victim's death.

564
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:52,999
If so,

565
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:55,252
who would the culprit be?

566
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:56,837
Nonsense.

567
00:45:58,046 --> 00:45:59,464
It's all nonsense.

568
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:03,969
Ms. Kwon told you outright
to leave this house?

569
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:06,262
Yes.

570
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,014
Oh, dear.

571
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:11,226
What are you going to do now?
She isn't going to sit back.

572
00:46:13,728 --> 00:46:16,408
I mean, if she kicks you out,
you won't be able to steal the Adamas.

573
00:46:16,481 --> 00:46:18,316
Then all your efforts
will have been in vain.

574
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:20,152
What will you do?

575
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:23,029
Say something!

576
00:46:28,034 --> 00:46:30,579
All right. Given what's happened,

577
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:32,622
we will steal the Adamas today.

578
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,459
What? We?

579
00:46:37,043 --> 00:46:38,043
Yes.

580
00:46:38,336 --> 00:46:39,462
I'll keep watch.

581
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:42,257
Let's get it over with
before Ms. Kwon kicks us out.

582
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:44,551
Don't worry too much.

583
00:46:46,052 --> 00:46:47,345
I'm sorry,

584
00:46:48,513 --> 00:46:49,598
but we can't do that.

585
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,058
The Adamas isn't here.

586
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:56,146
What? It's not here?

587
00:46:56,229 --> 00:46:58,231
No, Ms. Kwon snuck it out.

588
00:47:00,483 --> 00:47:01,483
Oh.

589
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:03,820
Then why are we still here?

590
00:47:04,237 --> 00:47:05,357
We should leave immediately.

591
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:07,365
Chairman Kwon won't let us.

592
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:10,160
We should run away or something.
There's no reason to be here.

593
00:47:10,243 --> 00:47:11,953
The Adamas is outside!

594
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:18,335
You're right. The Adamas isn't here,
so there's no reason to stay.

595
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:20,503
Now you're talking.

596
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:22,797
Should we make a run for it?

597
00:47:23,381 --> 00:47:24,758
Is that the only way?

598
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:26,050
That's our best option.

599
00:47:26,092 --> 00:47:27,761
The 36th stratagem.

600
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:33,141
Ms. Jang.

601
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:35,727
What?

602
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:06,132
Done.

603
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:10,804
I'll be able to start recasting soon.

604
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:22,565
We should run away or something.
There's no reason to be here.

605
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:24,442
The Adamas is outside!

606
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:25,526
Dongrim...

607
00:48:26,569 --> 00:48:27,570
you're a genius.

608
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:36,913
Gosh, this is so annoying.

609
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:38,498
What is it?

610
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:40,190
It's a notice from the head office.

611
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:46,006
What a nuisance. This is so annoying.

612
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,008
What is it?

613
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:50,760
The 80th-anniversary ceremony
will be held here.

614
00:48:53,179 --> 00:48:54,931
It's going to be tough.

615
00:48:55,181 --> 00:48:58,268
With all those reporters,
broadcasting people, and VIPs coming here.

616
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:02,480
They want the highest level
of security, darn it.

617
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:05,692
Why do they even bother
holding a ceremony at home?

618
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:09,279
Where's the chief?
I need to report this to him.

619
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:12,282
He's outside with Mr. Ha.

620
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:15,118
Again?

621
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:18,913
Are they soulmates or what?
They're always together.

622
00:49:19,497 --> 00:49:20,540
Tell me about it.

623
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:23,752
They're really, really suspicious.

624
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:28,006
Darn it, this is not good at all.

625
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,009
After all that ruckus,
she's been quiet all day.

626
00:49:32,093 --> 00:49:33,720
Ms. Kwon is incredible.

627
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:37,390
Maybe she trusts the chairman that firmly.

628
00:49:37,974 --> 00:49:40,268
Are you sure you got her weak spot?

629
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:41,895
About her dead son.

630
00:49:41,978 --> 00:49:43,813
I bet she was furious.

631
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:45,732
And then scared.

632
00:49:45,815 --> 00:49:48,568
She must fear Chairman Kwon
since she knows him so well.

633
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:51,738
Ultimately,
she decided that I was an enemy.

634
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:54,199
She needed a villain of some sort.

635
00:49:56,409 --> 00:49:59,287
Anyway, about Ms. Jang...

636
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:03,291
Don't rush me. The SIH is tracking her.

637
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:07,087
What if we spread word
that she knows where the Adamas is?

638
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:09,589
Every thief in the country
might be tempted.

639
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:11,573
It's worth tens of billions of won.

640
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:13,802
They would go crazy.

641
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:16,208
A lot of them are waiting
for a chance to hit the jackpot.

642
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:20,600
But why?
Team A will hear about it for sure.

643
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:22,227
Then they'll tighten security.

644
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:24,020
That's the point.

645
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:26,815
Ms. Jang will be ruled out immediately.

646
00:50:28,274 --> 00:50:30,235
Right. In that case,

647
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:33,196
they will think she spilled the beans.

648
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:37,409
The ceremony is around the corner
and to hire another designer and such...

649
00:50:37,992 --> 00:50:40,078
They will be short on time,
so in the end...

650
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:42,862
They'll have to skip the recrafting
and reveal it as is.

651
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:45,166
You'll stop them
from damaging the evidence?

652
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:47,585
Yes, and create a new plan
at the same time.

653
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:48,669
As in?

654
00:50:48,711 --> 00:50:51,840
They will try to move the Adamas
to a safe place right away.

655
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:54,467
They'll probably send it back here.

656
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:58,304
- Here?
- The ceremony will take place here anyway.

657
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:00,598
Who said that?

658
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:01,766
Ms. Kwon.

659
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:07,313
The chairman gave her full authority.
What else could it mean?

660
00:51:42,515 --> 00:51:44,142
Did you ask for me, ma'am?

661
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:47,854
The 80th-anniversary ceremony.

662
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,732
Yes, ma'am.

663
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:58,239
It must be perfect without any mistakes.

664
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:02,577
Yes, of course. Don't worry.

665
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:06,039
I'll be the one throwing the master
his retirement ceremony.

666
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,250
I'll do it, no matter what.

667
00:52:13,379 --> 00:52:14,379
It's a bad idea.

668
00:52:15,256 --> 00:52:18,092
Is it necessary
to bring the Adamas back into this house?

669
00:52:18,676 --> 00:52:19,969
Do you have another idea?

670
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:24,515
No, I'm just saying
it's better to handle it outside.

671
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:26,643
And I mean it when I say

672
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:29,437
Team A is frightening.

673
00:52:31,856 --> 00:52:33,233
Did something happen?

674
00:52:34,567 --> 00:52:37,904
They took all the records
on Lee Changwoo's case.

675
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:43,076
Let's just call it quits here.

676
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:47,121
It's not so bad to give up casually
when Ms. Kwon kicks you out.

677
00:52:49,165 --> 00:52:50,917
I should trust the SIH and withdraw?

678
00:52:54,545 --> 00:52:55,630
You got me wrong.

679
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:58,007
In the worst-case scenario,

680
00:52:58,633 --> 00:53:00,176
we can't protect you.

681
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:03,304
Don't trust the SIH.

682
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:05,515
Do you understand?

683
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:27,787
Mr. Choi.

684
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:35,878
You lost track of Ms. Jang, didn't you?

685
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:37,630
I'm not even surprised.

686
00:53:38,172 --> 00:53:40,967
It wouldn't be easy to locate her
with Haesong's tight protection.

687
00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:42,385
I said I'd take care of it.

688
00:53:42,468 --> 00:53:45,346
Do what I say with Ms. Jang
and have the SIH

689
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:48,975
dig into Lee Changwoo.

690
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:53,146
What? What are you saying now?

691
00:53:53,229 --> 00:53:54,480
Think about it.

692
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:58,318
An organization powerful enough
to get rid of police files.

693
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:00,653
Why are they doing nothing
about the root of all this?

694
00:54:01,904 --> 00:54:03,281
Lee Changwoo, the notorious thief.

695
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:06,034
Do you know why he got that nickname?

696
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:12,999
That ex-cop seems a bit dangerous.

697
00:54:26,637 --> 00:54:27,889
Mr. Ha.

698
00:54:28,514 --> 00:54:30,433
Your enemy isn't in front of you
but behind you.

699
00:54:58,294 --> 00:54:59,670
Ms. Ha Youngsin?

700
00:55:03,257 --> 00:55:04,384
I am...

701
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:09,222
here to tell you something.

702
00:55:20,983 --> 00:55:23,027
About the man who killed Song Soonho.

703
00:55:27,698 --> 00:55:28,741
I...

704
00:55:30,868 --> 00:55:32,370
I don't know anything.

705
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:37,041
Lee Changwoo didn't do it.

706
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:43,172
The real culprit is someone else.

707
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:55,059
How did you know?

708
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:06,612
Please leave him alone now.

709
00:56:07,905 --> 00:56:09,532
Stop harassing him.

710
00:56:10,575 --> 00:56:12,493
Just what are you trying
to plot this time?

711
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:16,038
You locked him up in prison for 22 years.

712
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:20,793
Now... Now, please...

713
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:23,629
Please stop... Stop.

714
00:56:31,053 --> 00:56:32,597
Are you okay? Ma'am?

715
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:37,810
We need help here!

716
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:39,270
What is going on?

717
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,939
Ma'am!

718
00:56:42,023 --> 00:56:44,066
- Hurry and call her guardian.
- Okay.

719
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:46,486
Are you okay, ma'am? Ma'am.

720
00:57:04,879 --> 00:57:07,548
It's me. Look into something for me.

721
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:09,383
As soon as possible.

722
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:15,931
Yes, ma'am.

723
00:57:29,570 --> 00:57:31,948
DO NOT ENTER

724
00:57:42,291 --> 00:57:43,834
There's one more person here!

725
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:17,024
NAMDEOK POLICE STATION CAR EXPLOSION
CAR PLATE: 19J 4694

726
00:58:20,204 --> 00:58:21,664
Mr. Baek's plate number showed up.

727
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:24,375
In a car explosion case
by Namdeok Police Station.

728
00:58:24,458 --> 00:58:25,458
Explosion?

729
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:27,920
Yes, the case was reported just now.

730
00:58:32,216 --> 00:58:33,593
- That way?
- Yes.

731
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:40,850
Lift him.

732
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:43,394
- All right.
- Let's hurry.

733
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:47,857
- Get the defibrillator. Hurry.
- Yes, doctor.

734
00:59:10,212 --> 00:59:11,672
Gosh, I'm so full.

735
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:14,759
You're late.

736
00:59:17,136 --> 00:59:18,679
I had to eat dinner.

737
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:22,350
It's so dirty. Clean up the car, will you?

738
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:29,315
Your breath stinks.

739
00:59:30,941 --> 00:59:32,401
Just what did you eat?

740
00:59:32,985 --> 00:59:33,985
Hey.

741
00:59:35,112 --> 00:59:37,823
You've got a foul mouth.

742
00:59:44,830 --> 00:59:45,831
Is this funny to you?

743
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:51,879
Let's respect each other. This is work.

744
00:59:52,421 --> 00:59:55,091
Show some respect. I'm older than you.

745
00:59:58,678 --> 01:00:00,054
Mister.

746
01:00:02,223 --> 01:00:03,224
I mean, darling.

747
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:06,519
Do you know why I work alone?

748
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:12,066
I killed all those
who used to work with me.

749
01:00:17,196 --> 01:00:18,614
Let's get along, all right?

750
01:00:23,869 --> 01:00:25,287
Are you threatening me?

751
01:00:25,579 --> 01:00:27,748
I've been in the field
for three years, you bi...

752
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:39,802
You wuss.

753
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:43,681
It was the back of the knife.

754
01:00:52,273 --> 01:00:53,482
What's the status?

755
01:01:03,325 --> 01:01:05,536
I saw them enter the building.

756
01:01:06,370 --> 01:01:09,540
They haven't come back outside yet, ma'am.

757
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:14,545
Then they'll be out soon.

758
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:17,923
Since they heard about the explosion,

759
01:01:18,924 --> 01:01:21,594
they will probably make a move.

760
01:01:27,224 --> 01:01:30,144
Two people died and one survived.

761
01:01:30,227 --> 01:01:31,979
He's being taken to a nearby hospital.

762
01:01:32,646 --> 01:01:34,940
- Which hospital?
- We don't know yet.

763
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:37,109
Call me. We'll take off first. Let's go.

764
01:01:38,444 --> 01:01:41,822
They knew where Prosecutor Song was.
They probably know where Ms. Kim is too.

765
01:01:43,532 --> 01:01:44,575
It's dangerous to go out.

766
01:01:44,658 --> 01:01:46,619
- But Prosecutor Song...
- Wait.

767
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:52,999
"Wait"?

768
01:01:55,461 --> 01:01:57,463
Are you even curious about his condition?

769
01:01:58,047 --> 01:01:59,298
Aren't you worried about him?

770
01:01:59,381 --> 01:02:02,343
It's not for my safety
that you're stopping me from going out.

771
01:02:02,426 --> 01:02:06,013
You're only trying to prevent me
from leaking where this place is.

772
01:02:06,096 --> 01:02:07,807
Is that more important
than someone's life?

773
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:10,059
Well, not to me.

774
01:02:10,142 --> 01:02:11,560
- Ms. Kim.
- Let go.

775
01:02:11,644 --> 01:02:13,562
- Think rationally.
- Let go!

776
01:02:13,646 --> 01:02:15,231
I'm being more rational than anyone.

777
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:18,734
You're crazy. You're out of your mind.

778
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:20,778
You're no different from Team A.

779
01:02:20,861 --> 01:02:24,114
You should be saving people.
Save their lives.

780
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:27,243
Charging 150 joules.

781
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:29,411
Charged. Clear!

782
01:02:31,288 --> 01:02:34,959
He's dying. Do you hear me?

783
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:37,085
Mr. Kang.

784
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:43,843
God damn it.

785
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:46,762
- Charging 200 joules.
- 200 joules.

786
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:48,222
Charged. Clear!

787
01:02:50,307 --> 01:02:51,892
- Charging 250 joules.
- 250 joules.

788
01:02:52,184 --> 01:02:54,144
Charged. Clear.

789
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:08,909
THE UNIDENTIFIED SURVIVOR
WAS TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL BUT DIED

790
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:19,169
Goodbye, Song Suhyeon.

791
01:03:19,253 --> 01:03:22,089
This is why I love twins.

792
01:03:22,423 --> 01:03:25,426
Even if one dies, the other is alive.

793
01:03:28,512 --> 01:03:31,015
Goodness!

794
01:03:33,225 --> 01:03:34,977
DNA TEST RESULTS

795
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:37,271
They're Lee Changwoo's sons.

796
01:03:37,605 --> 01:03:39,106
This is just unbelievable.

797
01:03:40,024 --> 01:03:42,359
How can it possibly be?

798
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:59,084
Gosh, I'm hungry. What time is it?

799
01:04:00,044 --> 01:04:01,044
Mr. Ha.

800
01:04:02,838 --> 01:04:04,381
Now it's become certain.

801
01:04:05,090 --> 01:04:07,217
They're keeping him alive.

802
01:04:09,303 --> 01:04:10,303
Why?

803
01:04:12,556 --> 01:04:13,724
Mr. Ha.

804
01:04:16,393 --> 01:04:17,311
Mr. Ha.

805
01:04:17,394 --> 01:04:18,394
Yes?

806
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:20,648
I'm hungry. Let's go eat.

807
01:04:21,315 --> 01:04:22,316
Oh, okay.

808
01:04:41,251 --> 01:04:43,837
You're having a late dinner. Same here.

809
01:04:45,589 --> 01:04:47,675
I see. Enjoy.

810
01:04:52,888 --> 01:04:55,015
- But why are you eating here?
- Dongrim.

811
01:04:56,934 --> 01:04:58,310
It seems you're about finished.

812
01:04:58,894 --> 01:05:00,771
No, I'm going to have another plate.

813
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:13,617
Right, I should stop eating.
Eating light is the key to longevity.

814
01:05:25,129 --> 01:05:26,547
There are many watching eyes.

815
01:05:27,631 --> 01:05:31,135
Exactly. Secret conversations
wouldn't keep them in the dark.

816
01:05:33,721 --> 01:05:35,347
I've given it some thought.

817
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:38,767
The chairman didn't kill your father.

818
01:05:43,022 --> 01:05:44,565
What are you doing?

819
01:05:44,648 --> 01:05:46,650
If he was the real culprit,

820
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:50,154
he wouldn't be keeping Lee Changwoo alive.

821
01:05:56,660 --> 01:05:58,120
You knew.

822
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:01,498
Did you deceive me?

823
01:06:10,549 --> 01:06:12,009
Not from the beginning.

824
01:06:13,594 --> 01:06:14,845
It just sort of happened.

825
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:19,224
Actually,

826
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:21,602
it doesn't matter who the culprit is.

827
01:06:22,102 --> 01:06:25,355
I don't care
who they turn into the culprit.

828
01:06:26,899 --> 01:06:28,817
You just need the Adamas?

829
01:06:30,569 --> 01:06:32,237
Because my purpose is a retrial.

830
01:06:33,113 --> 01:06:34,323
But...

831
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:39,286
there is something I don't understand
no matter how much I think about it.

832
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:46,293
What is it?

833
01:06:48,253 --> 01:06:50,631
The reason why
they're keeping Lee Changwoo alive.

834
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:01,058
It was worth waiting 22 years.

835
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:04,186
Lee Changwoo.

836
01:07:04,895 --> 01:07:06,855
Wait for me, you bastard.

837
01:07:16,156 --> 01:07:17,533
Mr. Cho!

838
01:07:19,409 --> 01:07:21,870
Mr. Cho!

839
01:07:26,708 --> 01:07:28,836
Are you crazy? Be quiet.

840
01:07:28,919 --> 01:07:30,462
You work for Team A?

841
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:31,630
Shut the hell up!

842
01:07:35,175 --> 01:07:37,010
PUNISHMENT

843
01:07:40,055 --> 01:07:41,098
Why you...

844
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:43,141
My dear junior.

845
01:07:45,936 --> 01:07:46,936
What?

846
01:07:51,191 --> 01:07:52,442
Go and tell

847
01:07:54,111 --> 01:07:55,612
Mr. Lee.

848
01:08:00,659 --> 01:08:02,828
That Lee Changwoo... No.

849
01:08:07,541 --> 01:08:09,001
His senior...

850
01:08:12,462 --> 01:08:13,547
wishes to see him.

851
01:08:33,984 --> 01:08:35,485
At one o'clock sharp,

852
01:08:35,569 --> 01:08:37,905
an e-mail is scheduled to
be sentto each media outlet.

853
01:08:38,488 --> 01:08:39,990
It's for his next piece.

854
01:08:40,574 --> 01:08:42,326
To write a story about Haesongwon.

855
01:08:42,409 --> 01:08:45,245
Rumor has it thatMs. Jang
knows where the Adamas is.

856
01:08:45,746 --> 01:08:48,081
She must realize the
loveshe had for her son

857
01:08:48,749 --> 01:08:51,126
so that her animosityagainst
Chairman Kwon can grow.

858
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:54,004
Suicide? No, it was murder.

859
01:08:54,588 --> 01:08:56,798
We're not friends, but
we're not enemies either.

860
01:08:57,382 --> 01:08:58,800
Is that where the Adamas is?

861
01:08:58,884 --> 01:09:00,052
Let's raid Ares immediately.

862
01:09:00,636 --> 01:09:01,970
We're back to square one.
