1
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,470
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,972
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:42,060
IN THE NAME OF MOTHER

4
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,493
We've titled the slogan as My First Gun.

5
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:01,955
We have various colors in mind
from black to pink and pastel tones,

6
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,791
including products for women.

7
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:06,626
To make the product more approachable,

8
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:09,254
we're planning to come up
with a series of friendly commercials.

9
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:11,673
And by hiring trendy celebrities
to model our products,

10
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:14,759
we will make them look like fashion items.

11
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:17,345
This kind of approach is expected

12
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:21,015
to blunt the repulsion against firearms
in the primary sense.

13
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:24,310
We've benchmarked
the gun culture in the States.

14
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,187
If we can actualize it here,

15
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,481
Haesong's future
will become even brighter.

16
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,902
"My First Gun."

17
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:36,281
I like it.

18
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:38,241
Oh, thank you.

19
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,160
All right.

20
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,704
Let's shake up this country!

21
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,288
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

22
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,666
Oh, right.

23
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:51,004
About the preparations
for the 80th-anniversary ceremony,

24
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:53,381
my father entrusted
the whole process to Ms. Kwon.

25
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:56,926
I'd like the company
to support her properly.

26
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,762
Of course. It will be
the chairman's retirement ceremony.

27
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:04,392
Gosh, this idiot.

28
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,738
It will be my inauguration ceremony.

29
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,038
It's not bad.

30
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:26,915
Proceed with it.

31
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:29,876
Yes, sir.
Why don't you have lunch with me?

32
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:31,961
No, thanks.

33
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,088
Will you return right away?

34
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,507
It feels suffocating in Seoul.

35
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:41,137
Father, about the Adamas...

36
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,891
I think we should station more guards
with Ms. Jang.

37
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,185
You know, it was stolen once...

38
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,771
Don't mention what happened in the past.
You might jinx it.

39
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,106
I'm sorry.

40
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:57,320
I'm just bothered by what that prosecutor
is up to these days.

41
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,781
I heard from Mr. Lee.

42
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,908
Mr. Lee?

43
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:04,202
He didn't tell me about meeting you.

44
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,828
He came in a rush.

45
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,497
I see.

46
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:13,795
Father. Actually,
Mr. Lee isn't who he used to be.

47
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:14,921
Hyunjo.

48
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,678
Don't try to see what's under the surface.

49
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:23,763
Stay out of it.

50
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,202
- Mr. Jeong.
- Yes, sir.

51
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,038
Beef up security on Ms. Jang's side.

52
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,750
Yes, sir. I'll let Mr. Lee know
and assign them right away.

53
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:56,879
I'm giving you the order.

54
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:59,841
Why would you bring up Mr. Lee here?

55
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:01,926
Pardon?

56
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,265
Yes, sir.

57
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,523
How much longer will you stay
in his shadow?

58
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,360
Team A needs a change.

59
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,071
A young leader.

60
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:28,494
Are that prosecutor
and female reporter still alive?

61
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,748
Isn't that wrong?

62
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:34,250
I'm sorry, sir.

63
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,297
Don't be sorry.

64
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,799
I hate it when people are sorry.

65
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,762
I'll take care of them soon.

66
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:48,765
Do you mean it?

67
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,315
If they manage to survive again,
you will have to stand in

68
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:59,359
for that target, okay?

69
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:22,006
I've gathered some material on the case.

70
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,634
I also snuck a copy
of the case record just in case.

71
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,220
Isn't that illegal?

72
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,139
Look who's talking.

73
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,777
What on earth?

74
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:45,905
They came by.

75
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:59,377
They're gone.
All the records I've gathered.

76
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,797
I doubt this was the only place
they ransacked.

77
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,234
Who are you?

78
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,117
Are you Mr. Gong Daechul?

79
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,202
Do you know me?

80
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,538
Where's Song Suhyeon?

81
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,918
Out of the blue?
I don't know where he is. How would I?

82
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:46,632
There's no trace of him packing.
It means he didn't plan on hiding.

83
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:58,811
Too bad.

84
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:04,650
If you don't know,
it'll be a headache for both of us.

85
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,787
I can't visit him?

86
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,207
That's what the law says, mister.

87
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,168
In exceptional cases, the prison chief

88
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,504
may prohibit visitations.

89
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,881
Look how gutsy you are,

90
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:29,550
explaining the law to a prosecutor.

91
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,721
A prosecutor?

92
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,402
- The punishment room?
- Yes.

93
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,820
There was a report

94
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:53,324
that he took narcotics
that were smuggled in.

95
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:56,118
He's in solitary
until the investigation is over.

96
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:59,205
So you locked him up
and are forbidding visitations?

97
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:02,708
If anyone's unhappy with it,
they'll file an administrative litigation.

98
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,710
To revoke his punishment.

99
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:10,216
Did the prosecution ask for a prohibition
on visitation regarding this case?

100
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:12,885
I doubt it.

101
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,972
You haven't even made an official request
to investigate it.

102
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,725
I have full authority over this matter.

103
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:23,062
So the prison is conducting
the investigation? And you are the judge?

104
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,438
No.

105
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,524
Well, that's...

106
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:28,234
Let me make it clear for you.

107
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:31,070
Criminally speaking,
you're abusing your authority here.

108
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,406
You are keeping an inmate
from exercising his rights.

109
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:36,450
You want me to list all the ways
you're violating criminal law?

110
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:39,954
What do you say?

111
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:47,712
My point here is,
let me speak with Lee Changwoo in person.

112
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,631
What's taking him so long?

113
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,967
What is this, a family reunion?

114
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,636
Ten minutes should be enough for a visit.

115
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,474
Why would it snow in April?

116
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:04,020
So much for a car wash.

117
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,230
<i>He refused to meet you.</i>

118
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,775
Did you specifically tell him my name?

119
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:10,985
Yes.

120
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:12,903
Gosh.

121
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:15,948
Let's go to the punishment room.

122
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,619
I'll go there myself.

123
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,123
What?

124
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,543
Read this first.

125
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:31,838
What is this?

126
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,759
Inmate 1014 wrote it himself.

127
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:40,389
PROSECUTOR SONG, I DON'T WANT TO MEET YOU
DON'T EVER COME AGAIN

128
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,476
Prosecutor, what should we do?

129
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:47,146
It's not like we can force him
to meet you against his will.

130
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,820
Don't smirk, all right?

131
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,588
Good job.

132
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:58,634
Whatever that prosecutor says,
don't give him a reaction.

133
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,512
Spare yourself, okay?

134
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:06,475
It won't do you any good
to antagonize Team A.

135
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,245
You...

136
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,582
Darn those bastards!

137
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:31,917
Hey!

138
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,587
Watch your temper already.

139
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:37,548
Why would you kick my precious baby?

140
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:38,632
What?

141
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,135
It's still just a toddler.

142
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,012
This is no time to joke around.

143
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,596
Gosh.

144
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,475
Honey, use your brain.

145
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,602
Why would they stop your visit?

146
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,729
Because they know it'll work against them.

147
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:57,109
To shut Lee Changwoo up?
Does that mean he knows something?

148
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,028
Bingo.

149
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,738
Ah.

150
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:04,366
Well, I should give it my best shot then.

151
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,202
Yes, it's me.

152
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,830
What?

153
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,710
- The Lee Changwoo case files are all gone.
- It makes no sense!

154
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,046
How could they vanish from the archive?

155
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,089
They didn't vanish.

156
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:22,802
We used an external cleaning service
when we changed archive rooms.

157
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:26,639
And they burned those records
with some other trash by mistake.

158
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,808
It's driving me crazy too.

159
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:32,394
But everything else is there.
Are you sure no one took them?

160
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,230
Look here.

161
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,358
You shouldn't say such a thing.

162
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,235
Why are you trying to cover it up?

163
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:42,613
Then what else can we do?

164
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:45,699
Arrest that poor cleaning lady?

165
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:46,992
Put her in cuffs?

166
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:51,914
Look, that case was closed
a long time ago, so the record...

167
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,582
You call that an excuse?

168
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,918
Goodness.

169
00:13:56,502 --> 00:14:00,673
Whatever. Go write an article
about this if you want.

170
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,383
Suit yourself.

171
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,426
Hey, let's go.

172
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:07,429
Jeez, she's just unbelievable.

173
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,226
Ms. Kim.

174
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:15,563
Take this.

175
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,235
Hello. Did you hear what happened?

176
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:25,155
Forget everything else
but the autopsy report...

177
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,532
Even if we get the Adamas,

178
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:29,076
we need that report
to make the comparison.

179
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,663
AUTOPSY REPORT

180
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,125
- I appreciate your hard work.
- Oh, Mr. Lee.

181
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,879
Where's Mr. Jeong?

182
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:43,424
I ordered him to shred these himself.

183
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:45,384
Oh, Mr. Kwon summoned him.

184
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,095
- Mr. Kwon?
- Yes, sir.

185
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,099
He must be pissed.

186
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:56,270
Seeing that he skipped me
and summoned Mr. Jeong directly.

187
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,858
Mr. Lee.

188
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,111
I did what you asked
and put it on your desk.

189
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:38,896
I don't know anything. I really don't.

190
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:44,151
Prosecutor Song asked me
for the Lee Changwoo case records,

191
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:45,903
but then,

192
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,572
they disappeared.

193
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:52,117
He didn't answer his phone,

194
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,078
so I came here, that's all.

195
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,625
- Mister.
- Yes?

196
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,461
Look at me.

197
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,135
I said, look at me.

198
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,105
Do you think I'm asking where he is

199
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,608
because I really don't know?

200
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:30,447
He has probably heard by now
that the case records have disappeared.

201
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,992
So where would he go next?

202
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,793
He'd probably visit his father's grave.

203
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,799
The scar left in his father's skeleton

204
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,386
could replace the missing autopsy report.

205
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:59,476
If you already knew, why did you...

206
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,898
I ask you questions,

207
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:06,942
and you can't answer them.

208
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,446
That way,

209
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:12,823
I can justify myself.

210
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,285
A reason to make a move.

211
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,094
Mister.

212
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,847
Bite down on this.

213
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,657
<i>Our only hope is my father's grave.</i>

214
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:57,993
For another autopsy?

215
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:01,205
There should be a scar.
It was stuck in his left eye.

216
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,792
Thank goodness you buried him
in a family gravesite.

217
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,335
Your ancestors must be helping.

218
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:10,756
Darn, they even got rid
of the case records.

219
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,342
Fine, let's fight dirty.

220
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:48,502
Ms. Oh.

221
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,342
I have a favor to ask of you.

222
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,138
Officially or unofficially?

223
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,016
The latter.

224
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,600
Go on.

225
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,063
I'd like you to get me my bag.

226
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:09,772
Your bag?

227
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,442
Yes, the one I brought
when I came to this house.

228
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:15,654
Oh, they must've taken it from you
for security purposes.

229
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,656
Personal belongings
are not allowed in here.

230
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,616
But why?

231
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,663
Well, I need it for something.

232
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,084
I'm not close
with any security guards here.

233
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:32,588
Sure.

234
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:37,259
I shouldn't turn down your request.

235
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,011
Thank you.

236
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,103
Between us...

237
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,248
I'm not sure if this is okay.

238
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,500
Don't you want to stop being a house dog?

239
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:14,379
I promised I'd get you a job
at the head office if you listen to me.

240
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:19,301
Yes, ma'am.

241
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:21,845
At your service.

242
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,441
Ms. Oh.

243
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,611
Make sure you keep your promise.

244
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:38,987
Just wait.

245
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:53,459
Eighteen.

246
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:01,384
Twenty.

247
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:10,893
Do you drink that often?

248
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:12,436
This?

249
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,481
It's good to drink anytime.

250
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,403
I got one for you.

251
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,197
No, thanks.

252
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:23,781
Have it.

253
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:39,506
I hope Ms. Kwon likes your novel.

254
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:44,219
By the way, why are you suddenly
so hung up on her son?

255
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,055
I thought Chairman Kwon killed my father.

256
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,767
Leaving out the time he spent abroad,

257
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:54,187
the statute of limitations was in effect,
so I thought it was worth a shot. But...

258
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:55,564
But the witness showed up.

259
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,774
Right, Mr. Lee.

260
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:01,278
If he is the culprit, Chairman Kwon isn't.

261
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:05,032
Then I wondered
what there could be to punish him with.

262
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,115
Ah.

263
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:09,077
You want to tie him
to the death of Ms. Kwon's son?

264
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,913
As the culprit of another murder case.

265
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:14,708
I like that.

266
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,922
It'd be insurance and a means
to tear apart Ms. Kwon and the chairman.

267
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,966
If her loyalty is tested,

268
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:26,053
she will ease her blind suspicion
against me.

269
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,272
Let me see.

270
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,567
What could be in here?

271
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:44,196
Why the sudden need for his bag?

272
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,949
What's gotten into him?

273
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,705
What is this? <i>In the Name of Mother?</i>

274
00:22:58,627 --> 00:22:59,753
<i>A novel?</i>

275
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,089
You wrote a story about her son?

276
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:03,924
Just a few pages.

277
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,804
Ms. Kwon's son attempted suicide
and was declared brain-dead.

278
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,975
Then his heart was transplanted
to Chairman Kwon. Isn't it dramatic?

279
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:17,229
I wonder how she'll react to that story.

280
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:20,857
She'll deny it vehemently.

281
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:26,905
<i>And she'll try to see if it's true.</i>

282
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:32,536
<i>"After painstaking deliberation,
Duke Alfonso</i>

283
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:35,163
<i>decided to choose his nanny's only son</i>

284
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:37,749
<i>as the suitable donor
for the heart transplant."</i>

285
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,797
<i>"'It's easier to make a donor
than to wait for one.'</i>

286
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:46,383
<i>Looking at his doctor, Allen,</i>

287
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:50,512
<i>the duke made a cold smile.</i>

288
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:54,933
<i>Dr. Allen was satisfied with the condition
and that night,</i>

289
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:59,146
<i>he declared a young man in a coma
brain-dead."</i>

290
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:08,363
<i>"A loyal nanny would be willing</i>

291
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:13,243
<i>to offer her child's heart to her master."</i>

292
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,832
No...

293
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,751
No.

294
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:24,045
No, it can't be.

295
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:25,922
No!

296
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,216
You want to study abroad?

297
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,760
I put you through college.
Wasn't that enough?

298
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,929
Stop dreaming
and just learn to work under me!

299
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,932
You want me to be a servant like you?

300
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,642
A servant? You brat.

301
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,395
Let go.

302
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:43,440
Mother, you care more about the chairman
than me, don't you?

303
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:47,527
Of course. I care about the master
way more than you.

304
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:50,071
Master this, master that!

305
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:53,575
I'm going to leave.
I'd die before I live the way you do.

306
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,078
What? You won't live like I do?

307
00:24:57,787 --> 00:25:00,540
Fine, die.

308
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,293
Die, you brat.
How could you say that to your mother?

309
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:06,171
Just go die.

310
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:08,215
Die!

311
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,233
Hoon!

312
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:29,611
Hoon! Oh, no.

313
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,492
Hoon!

314
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:41,915
Hoon...

315
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:09,359
Please... do as I say.

316
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:12,696
But, how could I possibly take his heart?

317
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,033
Master, please.

318
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:19,703
Only then

319
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:24,207
will I be able to think
Hoon is alive and well by my side.

320
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:47,480
Ms. Kwon will realize
that the story is about her.

321
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:52,110
She'll no longer feel
as devoted to the chairman.

322
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,071
It could be dangerous.

323
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:57,324
What if she talks to him about this?

324
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,784
No, she could never.

325
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:01,953
Why is that?

326
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:05,415
It'd be a bigger loss for Ms. Kwon.

327
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,126
Chairman Kwon
wouldn't keep her by his side.

328
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,380
Ms. Kwon is quick-witted enough
to know that.

329
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,508
True.

330
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:18,136
They would suspect each other.

331
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:20,305
She'd wonder if he killed her son,

332
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,390
and he'd wonder if she suspects him.

333
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,559
A difference in opinion.

334
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:28,521
It's the beginning of distrust.

335
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,274
I have a question.

336
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:34,819
You once said...

337
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:37,131
I need to find out where it's stored
as soon as possible.

338
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,299
Before the recrafting begins.

339
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,658
Should I look into it?

340
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,618
No. Leave it up to us.

341
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:44,746
"Us."

342
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:49,209
Is there someone else
helping you other than me?

343
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:56,466
- No.
- In this house or outside?

344
00:27:58,301 --> 00:27:59,301
There's no one else.

345
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:05,600
There isn't.

346
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:15,026
You say there isn't anyone,
but I think otherwise.

347
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,487
What do you call this kind of situation?

348
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:21,533
A difference in opinion.

349
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:26,746
The beginning of distrust.

350
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,041
Ms. Eun.

351
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,877
You drew the line first.

352
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,171
"I'm not Kwon Minjo."

353
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:37,340
"I'm not interested
in punishing the chairman."

354
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:39,759
"We're not after the same thing."
You said so.

355
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:44,681
Did you change your mind?

356
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,146
What a shame.

357
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:08,538
It's a lie! A lie...

358
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:14,335
Ha Woosin...

359
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,059
We've started our process to win her over

360
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,936
by trying to separate her
and the chairman.

361
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,481
But she isn't showing any response yet.

362
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:37,192
We'll see how it goes and act accordingly.

363
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,276
Okay.

364
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:42,489
We're also taking two measures
in case Mr. Ha's plan falls through.

365
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:45,742
We're trying to figure out
where Ms. Jang, the jewelry designer, is.

366
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,467
We were too focused on the task at hand.

367
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:51,456
Team A took Lee Changwoo's case file.

368
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:54,209
What? Even the autopsy report?

369
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:58,046
What on earth?
Then all this would've been for nothing.

370
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:00,006
Now the remaining option is...

371
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,773
Something's off.

372
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:19,776
It hasn't taken root yet.

373
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:21,402
It was planted recently.

374
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:25,907
What, those punks already came here?

375
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,201
And dug up this grave to...

376
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,203
To vandalize his body.

377
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,041
I'm getting the creeps.

378
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:37,043
Wait, let me think.

379
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:40,505
Now, even if we get our hands
on the Adamas,

380
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:42,602
we won't have anything to compare it with.

381
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,592
This is terrible.

382
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,679
How are we going to prove
it was used for the murder?

383
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:50,723
Was it Woosin?

384
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:52,642
What?

385
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:54,978
This grave isn't my father's.

386
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,898
- What?
- An old man lived alone in our village.

387
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,358
My father buried him here.

388
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:03,611
He'd tidy up the grave
and hold a memorial service for him.

389
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,989
The gravestone was switched.

390
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,994
He knew Haesong would damage the body.

391
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:14,372
Since the strongest evidence
in a murder case

392
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,583
is the victim himself.

393
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:21,004
But who? Who expected
this would happen and changed gravestones?

394
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:22,714
Isn't it obvious?

395
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:27,760
This one is my father's.

396
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,740
I'll make sure to catch the culprit.

397
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,452
For you, Father.

398
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:56,164
And for him.

399
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:00,376
PUNISHMENT

400
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:04,047
<i>Whatever that prosecutor says,
don't give him a reaction.</i>

401
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,049
<i>Spare yourself, okay?</i>

402
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:08,968
<i>It won't do you any good
to antagonize Team A.</i>

403
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,224
<i>We're good for the time being.</i>

404
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:18,353
Team A would believe
that they damaged the body.

405
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:21,189
That punk. He's always one step ahead.

406
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:22,440
You mean your brother?

407
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:25,443
If he were a soccer player,
he would've made it big.

408
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:30,031
By the way, what's your name?
I don't even know your name yet.

409
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:32,742
In my line of work,
we don't introduce ourselves.

410
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:37,330
We don't know when we'll die,
so it's no use making friends.

411
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:39,916
It's not like we'll die together.

412
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,627
Just call me "Mr. Baek."

413
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:46,673
I'm sheepish with calling you Mr. Baek.

414
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,468
Want a beating, honey?

415
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:53,096
How about just Baek?

416
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:56,224
Baek? It's not bad.

417
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:00,311
I'm hearing something.

418
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:04,732
Hear what?

419
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,401
I think a phone's ringing.

420
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:26,044
Should I open it?

421
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,477
Oh, my.

422
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:19,974
Those crazy bastards...

423
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,393
- No, wait.
- Let go of me.

424
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:36,991
Pick up.

425
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,953
Pick up the phone.

426
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:54,509
Who are you?

427
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:57,512
Who... Who are you?

428
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:00,098
Who are you?

429
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:06,187
Sun.

430
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:17,405
Boom.

431
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:34,173
You at least needed to know
who was killing you.

432
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:39,053
Now I feel bad.

433
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:44,225
Mr. Ha.

434
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,062
We have a serious problem.

435
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:54,443
I think Ms. Kwon has finally gone insane.

436
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,863
She's yelling out loudly, asking for you.

437
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,739
She's absolutely lost her mind.

438
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:03,911
Her eyes are flipping out
as if she's ready to kill someone.

439
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:08,124
Just what have you done this time?
I feel so anxious

440
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,377
that it's killing me, seriously.

441
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:23,264
Ms. Kwon?

442
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:29,604
Ms. Kwon.

443
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:33,065
Did you ask for me?

444
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,110
Mr. Ha.

445
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:39,947
I didn't like you from the start.

446
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:42,992
Your eyes told me
that you were hiding something.

447
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:45,745
Those eyes bothered me.

448
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:49,207
I'm hiding something? Me?

449
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,584
Your true motive for coming to this house.

450
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:55,129
I'm not really following.

451
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,550
Drop your clumsy act.

452
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,971
You came here
to write a story about my son.

453
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,848
You needed information to do that.

454
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:10,937
Ah.

455
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,147
Ah.

456
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,649
Ah?

457
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,319
Let me explain.

458
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,321
No, you don't have to.

459
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:24,242
I've read your incredulous story.

460
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:28,579
You've read it?
You mean the manuscript in my bag?

461
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:29,747
Yes.

462
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:31,957
Ah.

463
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,335
So you have.

464
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:45,179
I guess I can't hide it anymore.

465
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:49,433
You're right. I came to this house

466
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,936
because of what happened to your son.

467
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:56,857
It's quite interesting.

468
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,027
Interesting?

469
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:04,073
Is it fun to gossip
about someone else's deceased child?

470
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:05,658
Yes, to the public.

471
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,911
In the house of a well-known family,

472
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:11,455
a young, healthy man attempted suicide.

473
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:14,119
He was declared brain-dead
and his organ was donated.

474
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:17,169
Coincidentally, the recipient was...

475
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,879
What are you trying to say?

476
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:24,051
My interest in your son's story

477
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,763
simply started from my imagination
as a writer.

478
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:31,809
What if it was not suicide,

479
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:33,853
but murder?

480
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:40,484
In murder cases, the primary suspect...

481
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:46,324
is usually the one who gains the most
from the victim's death.

482
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,034
If so,

483
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:50,745
who would the culprit be?

484
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,293
The question triggered my imagination.

485
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:23,652
You sure are a funny guy.

486
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:28,032
You're trying to harass me
with my son's story.

487
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:31,160
Because I treat you like an eyesore.

488
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:34,080
Too bad. It's not going to work.

489
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:38,125
- You're mistaken. I only...
- Listen.

490
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:44,423
I no longer feel attached to him.

491
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:47,968
I don't know what you heard,
but don't try to pull any tricks on me.

492
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:51,722
Ms. Kwon.

493
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,057
Shut your mouth and listen!

494
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:58,771
The master gave me full authority
over the 80th-anniversary ceremony.

495
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,731
His retirement ceremony, to be exact.

496
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:01,941
Me...

497
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:05,277
He chose me, Kwon Soonyi,

498
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:08,280
out of all those important people
at the company.

499
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,490
Do you hear me?

500
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,118
Whatever you came here to do,

501
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:14,995
I have no time or energy to care, got it?

502
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,001
Leave this house immediately.

503
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,631
That's not my choice to make.

504
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:30,719
You already know. I can't do that
without the chairman's permission.

505
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:31,846
Really?

506
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:34,765
Then I'll tell him myself.

507
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:36,559
Tell him what?

508
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:40,396
Don't waste your effort and pack up
while I'm giving you the chance.

509
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:45,317
The master

510
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:49,280
has nothing to do with my son's death.

511
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:00,374
<i>Me First Principle.</i>

512
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:04,211
<i>Your words tend to indicate
a psychological distance.</i>

513
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,772
WORDS OF IMPORTANCE COME FIRST IN ORDER

514
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:08,632
<i>For example, you mention
someone closer to you before the other.</i>

515
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:10,926
<i>The master</i>

516
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:14,221
has nothing to do with my son's death.

517
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:18,142
<i>She cares about Chairman Kwon
more deeply than I thought.</i>

518
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:19,959
<i>But when she talks about her son...</i>

519
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:24,482
I no longer feel attached to him.

520
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,823
She doesn't even say his name.

521
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:38,162
Then why...

522
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:03,437
<i>does she keep his photos?</i>

523
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,190
It shows an attachment.

524
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:16,325
A sense of guilt?

525
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:50,943
SEOUL BUKANG HIGH SCHOOL

526
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,740
What? How dare you...

527
00:42:57,533 --> 00:43:00,786
You'll tell the chairman
why I actually came here?

528
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:03,414
No, you can't.

529
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:06,166
- What?
- How will you put it?

530
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,370
"He says you have something
to do with my son's death,

531
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,296
and he's writing a novel about it."

532
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:13,924
- Shut up.
- I wonder how he will respond.

533
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:16,510
Will he care about me suspecting him?

534
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:19,722
Or will he care about how you see it?

535
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:21,807
- I said, shut up.
- I'm curious myself.

536
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:23,100
What do you think?

537
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:24,727
- You...
- You've never suspected him?

538
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:27,938
No! I had never suspected him even once.

539
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:31,066
That's the past tense. What about now?

540
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:37,740
Stop running your mouth.

541
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,242
What do you even know?

542
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:42,953
You don't know anything!

543
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:44,037
Ms. Kwon.

544
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,707
So what are you trying to say?

545
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:50,711
That the master deliberately took
my son's heart?

546
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:55,215
Why?

547
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:59,970
Why now?

548
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:08,604
"Why now?"

549
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:14,193
You mean...

550
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:20,448
Get out.

551
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:24,828
Get out!

552
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,387
She knew.

553
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:51,355
No.

554
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:55,442
No!

555
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:59,363
No...

556
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:04,368
No, he didn't.

557
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,329
He didn't.

558
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:09,790
He did not.

559
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:17,214
IN THE NAME OF MOTHER

560
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:40,529
<i>What if it was not suicide,</i>

561
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:42,781
<i>but murder?</i>

562
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:46,326
<i>In murder cases, the primary suspect...</i>

563
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:50,998
<i>is usually the one who gains the most
from the victim's death.</i>

564
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,041
<i>If so,</i>

565
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:55,294
<i>who would the culprit be?</i>

566
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:56,879
Nonsense.

567
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:59,506
It's all nonsense.

568
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:04,011
Ms. Kwon told you outright
to leave this house?

569
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:06,304
Yes.

570
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:08,056
Oh, dear.

571
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,268
What are you going to do now?
She isn't going to sit back.

572
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:16,451
I mean, if she kicks you out,
you won't be able to steal the Adamas.

573
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:18,358
Then all your efforts
will have been in vain.

574
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:20,194
What will you do?

575
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,071
Say something!

576
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:30,621
All right. Given what's happened,

577
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,664
we will steal the Adamas today.

578
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:36,502
What? We?

579
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:38,085
Yes.

580
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:39,505
I'll keep watch.

581
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:42,299
Let's get it over with
before Ms. Kwon kicks us out.

582
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:44,593
Don't worry too much.

583
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:47,387
I'm sorry,

584
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:49,640
but we can't do that.

585
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:52,100
The Adamas isn't here.

586
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:56,188
What? It's not here?

587
00:46:56,271 --> 00:46:58,273
No, Ms. Kwon snuck it out.

588
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:01,526
Oh.

589
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:03,862
Then why are we still here?

590
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:05,399
We should leave immediately.

591
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:07,407
Chairman Kwon won't let us.

592
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:10,202
We should run away or something.
There's no reason to be here.

593
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:11,995
The Adamas is outside!

594
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:18,377
You're right. The Adamas isn't here,
so there's no reason to stay.

595
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,546
Now you're talking.

596
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:22,840
Should we make a run for it?

597
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:24,800
Is that the only way?

598
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:26,092
That's our best option.

599
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:27,803
The 36th stratagem.

600
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:33,183
Ms. Jang.

601
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:35,769
What?

602
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,174
Done.

603
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:10,846
I'll be able to start recasting soon.

604
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:22,608
<i>We should run away or something.
There's no reason to be here.</i>

605
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:24,484
<i>The Adamas is outside!</i>

606
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:25,568
Dongrim...

607
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:27,613
you're a genius.

608
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:36,955
Gosh, this is so annoying.

609
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:38,540
What is it?

610
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:40,232
It's a notice from the head office.

611
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:46,048
What a nuisance. This is so annoying.

612
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:48,050
What is it?

613
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:50,802
The 80th-anniversary ceremony
will be held here.

614
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:54,973
It's going to be tough.

615
00:48:55,223 --> 00:48:58,310
With all those reporters,
broadcasting people, and VIPs coming here.

616
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:02,522
They want the highest level
of security, darn it.

617
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:05,734
Why do they even bother
holding a ceremony at home?

618
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:09,321
Where's the chief?
I need to report this to him.

619
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:12,324
He's outside with Mr. Ha.

620
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:15,160
Again?

621
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:18,956
Are they soulmates or what?
They're always together.

622
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:20,582
Tell me about it.

623
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:23,794
They're really, really suspicious.

624
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:28,048
Darn it, this is not good at all.

625
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:31,051
After all that ruckus,
she's been quiet all day.

626
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:33,762
Ms. Kwon is incredible.

627
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:37,432
Maybe she trusts the chairman that firmly.

628
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:40,310
Are you sure you got her weak spot?

629
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:41,937
About her dead son.

630
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:43,855
I bet she was furious.

631
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:45,774
And then scared.

632
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:48,610
She must fear Chairman Kwon
since she knows him so well.

633
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:51,780
Ultimately,
she decided that I was an enemy.

634
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:54,241
She needed a villain of some sort.

635
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:59,329
Anyway, about Ms. Jang...

636
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:03,333
Don't rush me. The SIH is tracking her.

637
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:07,129
What if we spread word
that she knows where the Adamas is?

638
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:09,631
Every thief in the country
might be tempted.

639
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:11,615
It's worth tens of billions of won.

640
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:13,844
They would go crazy.

641
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:16,250
A lot of them are waiting
for a chance to hit the jackpot.

642
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:20,642
But why?
Team A will hear about it for sure.

643
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:22,269
Then they'll tighten security.

644
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:24,062
That's the point.

645
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:26,857
Ms. Jang will be ruled out immediately.

646
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:30,277
Right. In that case,

647
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:33,238
they will think she spilled the beans.

648
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:37,451
The ceremony is around the corner
and to hire another designer and such...

649
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:40,120
They will be short on time,
so in the end...

650
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,904
They'll have to skip the recrafting
and reveal it as is.

651
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,208
You'll stop them
from damaging the evidence?

652
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:47,627
Yes, and create a new plan
at the same time.

653
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:48,711
As in?

654
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:51,882
They will try to move the Adamas
to a safe place right away.

655
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:54,509
They'll probably send it back here.

656
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:58,346
- Here?
- The ceremony will take place here anyway.

657
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:00,640
Who said that?

658
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:01,808
Ms. Kwon.

659
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:07,355
The chairman gave her full authority.
What else could it mean?

660
00:51:42,557 --> 00:51:44,184
Did you ask for me, ma'am?

661
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,896
The 80th-anniversary ceremony.

662
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:50,774
Yes, ma'am.

663
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:58,281
It must be perfect without any mistakes.

664
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:02,619
Yes, of course. Don't worry.

665
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:06,081
I'll be the one throwing the master
his retirement ceremony.

666
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:09,292
I'll do it, no matter what.

667
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:14,421
It's a bad idea.

668
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:18,135
Is it necessary
to bring the Adamas back into this house?

669
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:20,011
Do you have another idea?

670
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,558
No, I'm just saying
it's better to handle it outside.

671
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:26,685
And I mean it when I say

672
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:29,479
Team A is frightening.

673
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:33,275
Did something happen?

674
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:37,946
They took all the records
on Lee Changwoo's case.

675
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:43,118
Let's just call it quits here.

676
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:47,164
It's not so bad to give up casually
when Ms. Kwon kicks you out.

677
00:52:49,207 --> 00:52:50,959
I should trust the SIH and withdraw?

678
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:55,672
You got me wrong.

679
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,049
In the worst-case scenario,

680
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:00,218
we can't protect you.

681
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:03,346
Don't trust the SIH.

682
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:05,557
Do you understand?

683
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:27,829
Mr. Choi.

684
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,921
You lost track of Ms. Jang, didn't you?

685
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:37,672
I'm not even surprised.

686
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:41,009
It wouldn't be easy to locate her
with Haesong's tight protection.

687
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:42,427
I said I'd take care of it.

688
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:45,388
Do what I say with Ms. Jang
and have the SIH

689
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:49,017
dig into Lee Changwoo.

690
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:53,188
What? What are you saying now?

691
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:54,522
Think about it.

692
00:53:54,856 --> 00:53:58,360
An organization powerful enough
to get rid of police files.

693
00:53:58,443 --> 00:54:00,695
Why are they doing nothing
about the root of all this?

694
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:03,323
Lee Changwoo, the notorious thief.

695
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:06,076
Do you know why he got that nickname?

696
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:13,041
That ex-cop seems a bit dangerous.

697
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,931
Mr. Ha.

698
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:30,475
Your enemy isn't in front of you
but behind you.

699
00:54:58,336 --> 00:54:59,713
Ms. Ha Youngsin?

700
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,426
I am...

701
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:09,264
here to tell you something.

702
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:23,069
About the man who killed Song Soonho.

703
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:28,783
I...

704
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:32,412
I don't know anything.

705
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:37,083
Lee Changwoo didn't do it.

706
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:43,214
The real culprit is someone else.

707
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:55,101
How did you know?

708
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,654
Please leave him alone now.

709
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:09,574
Stop harassing him.

710
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:12,535
Just what are you trying
to plot this time?

711
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:16,081
You locked him up in prison for 22 years.

712
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:20,835
Now... Now, please...

713
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:23,671
Please stop... Stop.

714
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:32,639
Are you okay? Ma'am?

715
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:37,852
We need help here!

716
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:39,312
What is going on?

717
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:41,981
Ma'am!

718
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:44,109
- Hurry and call her guardian.
- Okay.

719
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:46,528
Are you okay, ma'am? Ma'am.

720
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:07,590
It's me. Look into something for me.

721
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:09,426
As soon as possible.

722
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:15,973
Yes, ma'am.

723
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,990
DO NOT ENTER

724
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:43,877
There's one more person here!

725
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:17,066
NAMDEOK POLICE STATION CAR EXPLOSION
CAR PLATE: 19J 4694

726
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:21,706
Mr. Baek's plate number showed up.

727
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:24,417
In a car explosion case
by Namdeok Police Station.

728
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:25,501
Explosion?

729
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:27,962
Yes, the case was reported just now.

730
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:33,635
- That way?
- Yes.

731
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:40,892
Lift him.

732
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:43,436
- All right.
- Let's hurry.

733
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:47,899
- Get the defibrillator. Hurry.
- Yes, doctor.

734
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:11,714
Gosh, I'm so full.

735
00:59:13,758 --> 00:59:14,801
You're late.

736
00:59:17,178 --> 00:59:18,721
I had to eat dinner.

737
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:22,392
It's so dirty. Clean up the car, will you?

738
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:29,357
Your breath stinks.

739
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:32,443
Just what did you eat?

740
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:34,027
Hey.

741
00:59:35,154 --> 00:59:37,865
You've got a foul mouth.

742
00:59:44,872 --> 00:59:45,873
Is this funny to you?

743
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:51,921
Let's respect each other. This is work.

744
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:55,133
Show some respect. I'm older than you.

745
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,096
Mister.

746
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:03,266
I mean, darling.

747
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:06,561
Do you know why I work alone?

748
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:12,108
I killed all those
who used to work with me.

749
01:00:17,238 --> 01:00:18,656
Let's get along, all right?

750
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:25,330
Are you threatening me?

751
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:27,790
I've been in the field
for three years, you bi...

752
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:39,844
You wuss.

753
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:43,723
It was the back of the knife.

754
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:53,524
What's the status?

755
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:05,578
I saw them enter the building.

756
01:01:06,412 --> 01:01:09,582
They haven't come back outside yet, ma'am.

757
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:14,587
Then they'll be out soon.

758
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:17,965
Since they heard about the explosion,

759
01:01:18,966 --> 01:01:21,636
they will probably make a move.

760
01:01:27,266 --> 01:01:30,186
Two people died and one survived.

761
01:01:30,269 --> 01:01:32,021
He's being taken to a nearby hospital.

762
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:34,982
- Which hospital?
- We don't know yet.

763
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:37,151
Call me. We'll take off first. Let's go.

764
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:41,864
They knew where Prosecutor Song was.
They probably know where Ms. Kim is too.

765
01:01:43,574 --> 01:01:44,617
It's dangerous to go out.

766
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:46,661
- But Prosecutor Song...
- Wait.

767
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:53,041
"Wait"?

768
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:57,505
Are you even curious about his condition?

769
01:01:58,089 --> 01:01:59,340
Aren't you worried about him?

770
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:02,385
It's not for my safety
that you're stopping me from going out.

771
01:02:02,468 --> 01:02:06,055
You're only trying to prevent me
from leaking where this place is.

772
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:07,849
Is that more important
than someone's life?

773
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:10,101
Well, not to me.

774
01:02:10,184 --> 01:02:11,602
- Ms. Kim.
- Let go.

775
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:13,604
- Think rationally.
- Let go!

776
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:15,273
I'm being more rational than anyone.

777
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:18,776
You're crazy. You're out of your mind.

778
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:20,820
You're no different from Team A.

779
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:24,157
You should be saving people.
Save their lives.

780
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:27,285
Charging 150 joules.

781
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:29,454
Charged. Clear!

782
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:35,001
He's dying. Do you hear me?

783
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:37,127
Mr. Kang.

784
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:43,885
God damn it.

785
01:02:44,886 --> 01:02:46,804
- Charging 200 joules.
- 200 joules.

786
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:48,264
Charged. Clear!

787
01:02:50,349 --> 01:02:51,934
- Charging 250 joules.
- 250 joules.

788
01:02:52,226 --> 01:02:54,187
Charged. Clear.

789
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:08,951
THE UNIDENTIFIED SURVIVOR
WAS TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL BUT DIED

790
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:19,212
Goodbye, Song Suhyeon.

791
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:22,131
This is why I love twins.

792
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:25,468
Even if one dies, the other is alive.

793
01:03:28,554 --> 01:03:31,057
Goodness!

794
01:03:33,267 --> 01:03:35,019
DNA TEST RESULTS

795
01:03:35,102 --> 01:03:37,313
They're Lee Changwoo's sons.

796
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:39,148
This is just unbelievable.

797
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:42,401
How can it possibly be?

798
01:03:56,207 --> 01:03:59,126
Gosh, I'm hungry. What time is it?

799
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:01,086
Mr. Ha.

800
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,423
<i>Now it's become certain.</i>

801
01:04:05,132 --> 01:04:07,260
<i>They're keeping him alive.</i>

802
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:10,345
<i>Why?</i>

803
01:04:12,598 --> 01:04:13,766
Mr. Ha.

804
01:04:16,435 --> 01:04:17,353
Mr. Ha.

805
01:04:17,436 --> 01:04:18,436
Yes?

806
01:04:18,729 --> 01:04:20,690
I'm hungry. Let's go eat.

807
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:22,358
Oh, okay.

808
01:04:41,294 --> 01:04:43,880
You're having a late dinner. Same here.

809
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:47,717
I see. Enjoy.

810
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:55,057
- But why are you eating here?
- Dongrim.

811
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:58,352
It seems you're about finished.

812
01:04:58,936 --> 01:05:00,813
No, I'm going to have another plate.

813
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:13,659
Right, I should stop eating.
Eating light is the key to longevity.

814
01:05:25,171 --> 01:05:26,589
There are many watching eyes.

815
01:05:27,673 --> 01:05:31,177
Exactly. Secret conversations
wouldn't keep them in the dark.

816
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:35,389
I've given it some thought.

817
01:05:36,307 --> 01:05:38,809
The chairman didn't kill your father.

818
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:44,607
What are you doing?

819
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:46,692
If he was the real culprit,

820
01:05:48,402 --> 01:05:50,196
he wouldn't be keeping Lee Changwoo alive.

821
01:05:56,702 --> 01:05:58,162
You knew.

822
01:06:00,164 --> 01:06:01,540
Did you deceive me?

823
01:06:10,591 --> 01:06:12,051
Not from the beginning.

824
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:14,887
It just sort of happened.

825
01:06:18,182 --> 01:06:19,266
Actually,

826
01:06:19,892 --> 01:06:21,644
it doesn't matter who the culprit is.

827
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:25,398
I don't care
who they turn into the culprit.

828
01:06:26,941 --> 01:06:28,859
You just need the Adamas?

829
01:06:30,611 --> 01:06:32,279
Because my purpose is a retrial.

830
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:34,365
But...

831
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:39,328
there is something I don't understand
no matter how much I think about it.

832
01:06:45,292 --> 01:06:46,335
What is it?

833
01:06:48,295 --> 01:06:50,673
The reason why
they're keeping Lee Changwoo alive.

834
01:06:58,723 --> 01:07:01,100
It was worth waiting 22 years.

835
01:07:03,102 --> 01:07:04,228
Lee Changwoo.

836
01:07:04,937 --> 01:07:06,897
Wait for me, you bastard.

837
01:07:16,198 --> 01:07:17,575
Mr. Cho!

838
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:21,912
Mr. Cho!

839
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:28,878
Are you crazy? Be quiet.

840
01:07:28,961 --> 01:07:30,504
You work for Team A?

841
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:31,672
Shut the hell up!

842
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:37,053
PUNISHMENT

843
01:07:40,097 --> 01:07:41,140
Why you...

844
01:07:42,183 --> 01:07:43,183
My dear junior.

845
01:07:45,978 --> 01:07:46,978
What?

846
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:52,485
Go and tell

847
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:55,654
Mr. Lee.

848
01:08:00,701 --> 01:08:02,870
That Lee Changwoo... No.

849
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:09,043
His senior...

850
01:08:12,505 --> 01:08:13,589
wishes to see him.

851
01:08:34,026 --> 01:08:35,528
<i>At one o'clock sharp,</i>

852
01:08:35,611 --> 01:08:37,947
<i>an e-mail is scheduled to be sent
to each media outlet.</i>

853
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:40,032
<i>It's for his next piece.</i>

854
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:42,368
<i>To write a story about Haesongwon.</i>

855
01:08:42,451 --> 01:08:45,287
<i>Rumor has it that
Ms. Jang knows where the Adamas is.</i>

856
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:48,124
<i>She must realize the love
she had for her son</i>

857
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:51,168
<i>so that her animosity
against Chairman Kwon can grow.</i>

858
01:08:51,752 --> 01:08:54,046
<i>Suicide? No, it was murder.</i>

859
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:56,841
<i>We're not friends,
but we're not enemies either.</i>

860
01:08:57,424 --> 01:08:58,843
<i>Is that where the Adamas is?</i>

861
01:08:58,926 --> 01:09:00,094
<i>Let's raid Ares immediately.</i>

862
01:09:00,678 --> 01:09:02,012
<i>We're back to square one.</i>
